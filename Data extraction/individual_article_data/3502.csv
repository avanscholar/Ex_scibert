0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is the most promising in the succession of fuel evolution, with several technical, socio-economic and environmental benefits to its credit. It has the highest energy content per unit weight of any known fuel (142kJ/g or 61,000Btu/lb) and can be transported for domestic/industrial consumption through conventional means. H2 gas is safer to handle than domestic natural gas. H2 is now universally accepted as an environmentally safe, renewable energy resource and an ideal alternative to fossil fuels that doesn't contribute to the greenhouse effect. The only carbon-free fuel, H2 upon oxidation produces water alone. H2 can be used either as the fuel for direct combustion in an internal combustion engine or as the fuel for a fuel cell. The largest users of H2, however, are the fertilizer and petroleum industries with, respectively, 50% and 37% [1]. Sales of H2 have increased by 6% annually in the last five years, which is closely related to the increased use of H2 in refineries as a result of stricter standards for fuel quality. Presently, hydrogen is produced 40% from natural gas, 30% from heavy oils and Naphtha, 18% from coal, and 4% from electrolysis [2,3]. Biohydrogen has gained attention due to its potential as a sustainable alternative to the conventional methods for H2 production. It gives unassailable flexibility for a sustainable energy system, considering the present energy crisis and environmental tribulations. Biological processes, unlike their chemical or electrochemical counterparts, are catalyzed by microorganisms in an aqueous environment at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, these techniques are well suited for decentralized energy production in small-scale installations in locations where biomass or wastes are available, thus avoiding energy expenditure and costs for transport. In addition, these are becoming important mainly due to utilize renewable energy resources. These processes are usually carried out by different anaerobic bacteria and/or algae. The characteristics of these microorganisms widely differ from each other with respect to substrates and process conditions. The merits and demerits of the processes have already been discussed [4,5]. The major objective of the advancement of the biohydrogen production processes is to improve the hydrogen yield to make the process economically viable. The present paper deals with the present state of art of biohydrogen research considering different approaches like use of hybrid bioreactor using dark and photo-fermentation processes as well as bioelectrochemical assisted bioreactor, development of microbial consortium, genetic modification of the microorganisms, metabolic engineering, etc."
1,Basic concepts,"Biological hydrogen production processes can be classified as follows: • Biophotolysis of water using green algae and blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) Direct biophotolysis Indirect biophotolysis • Photodecomposition of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria; • Dark fermentation of organic compounds; and • Hybrid systems Use of fermentative and photosynthetic bacteria, Use of bioelectrochemical assisted bioreactor."
2,Biophotolysis of water using green algae and blue-green algae (cyanobacteria),"2.1 Biophotolysis of water using green algae and blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) Green algae and blue-green algae split water molecules into hydrogen ion and oxygen via direct and indirect biophotolysis. 2.1.1 Direct biophotolysis The conversion of water to hydrogen by green algae may be represented by the following general reaction: (1) 2H2O+light energy→2H2 +O2 The well-known H2-producing green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, under anaerobic conditions, can either generate H2 or use H2 as an electron donor [6]. The generated hydrogen ions are converted into hydrogen gas in the medium with electrons (donated by reduced ferredoxin) by hydrogenase enzyme present in the cells. Light energy absorbed by photosystem II (PSII) generates electrons which are transferred to ferredoxin using light energy absorbed by photosystem I (PSI). A reversible hydrogenase accepts electrons directly from the reduced ferredoxin to generate H2 in presence of hydrogenase, as follows: This enzyme is very sensitive to O2. Hydrogenase activity has also been observed in other green algae like Scenedesmus obliquus [6], Chlorococcum littorale [5], Platymonas subcordiformis [5] and Chlorella fusca [6]. On the other hand, there are several green algae types that do not have hydrogenase activity such as Dunaliella salina and Chlorella vulgaris [5]. 2.1.2 Indirect biophotolysis The general reaction for hydrogen formation from water by cyanobacteria can be represented by following reactions: (3) 12H2O+6CO2 +light energy→C6H12O6 +6O2 and (4) C6H12O6 +12H2O+light energy→12H2 +6CO2 Cyanobacteria are also known as blue-green algae, cyanophyceae or cyanophytes. It is a large and diverse group of photoautotrophic microorganism. Cyanobacteria contain photosynthetic pigments, such as chl a, carotenoids and phycobiliproteins, and can perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Morphologically these organisms fall into a diverse group that includes unicellular, filamentous and colonial species. Hydrogen is produced both by hydrogenase and nitrogenase enzymes. Within the filamentous cyanobacteria, vegetative cells may develop into structurally modified and functionally specialized cells. The nutritional requirements of cyanobacteria are simple: air (N2 and O2), water, mineral salts and light. Hydrogen producing cyanobacteria may be either nitrogen fixing or non-nitrogen fixing. The examples of nitrogen fixing organisms are non-marine Anabaena sp., marine cyanobacteria Calothrix sp., Oscillatoria sp. Non-nitrogen fixing organisms are Synechococcus sp., Gloebacter sp. and Anabaena sp. They are found suitable for higher hydrogen evolution as compared to other cyanobacteria species [5–8]. Heterocystous filamentous Anabaena cylindrica is a well-known hydrogen producing cyanobacterium [5]. But, Anabaena variabilis has received more attention in recent years, because of higher hydrogen yield [9]. Hydrogen production by vegetative cells can take two routes [9]: A. Heterocystous nitrogen fixing bacteria: B. Nonheterocystous nitrogen fixing bacteria: The growth conditions for Anabaena are simple which include nitrogen free media, illumination, CO2 and N2. Nitrogenase plays important role for the hydrogen generation. Activity of the nitrogenase is inhibited by oxygen. Hydrogen production takes place under anaerobic conditions. Some cultures require CO2 during hydrogen evolution phase, although CO2 is reported to give some inhibition effects on photo-production of H2. Lower CO2 concentrations (4–18% w/v) have been reported to increase cell density during growth phase, resulting in higher hydrogen evolution in the later stage. Simple sugars have been found suitable for hydrogen production. Recently more emphasis has been given to increase hydrogenase activity and bidirectional hydrogenase deficient mutants of Anabaena sp. to increase the rate of hydrogen production. However, at the present time the rate of hydrogen production by Anabaena sp. is considerably lower than that obtained by dark or photo-fermentations [5–9]. With dinitrogen (7) N2 +8H+ +8e− +16ATP→2NH3 +H2 +16ADP+16Pi or, without dinitrogen (8) 8H+ +8e− +16ATP→4H2 +16ADP+16Pi"
3,Photodecomposition of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria,"2.2 Photodecomposition of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria H2 production by purple non-sulfur bacteria is mainly due to the presence of nitrogenase under nitrogen-deficient conditions using light energy and reduced compounds (organic acids). The reaction is as follows: (9) CH3COOH+2H2O+light energy→4H2 +2CO2 Photosynthetic bacteria have long been studied for their capacity to produce significant amounts of hydrogen [10]. The advantage of their use is in the versatile metabolic capabilities of these organisms and the lack of Photosystem II (PSII), which automatically eliminates the difficulties associated with O2 inhibition of H2 production. Phototrophic bacteria require organic or inorganic electron source to drive their photosynthesis. They can utilize a wide range of cheap compounds. These photoheterotrophic bacteria have been found suitable to convert light energy into H2 using organic wastes as substrate [10–12] in batch processes [13], continuous cultures [14], or immobilized whole cell system using different solid matrices like carrageenan [15], agar gel [16], porous glass [12], and polyurethane foam [11]. The overall biochemical pathways for the photo-fermentation process can be expressed as follows: Certain photoheterotrophic bacteria within the superfamily Rhodospirillaceae can grow in the dark using CO as the sole carbon source to generate ATP with the simultaneous release of H2 and CO2 [6]. The oxidation of CO to CO2 with the release of H2 occurs via a water gas shift reaction as shown below: (11) CO+H2O→CO2 +H2"
4,Fermentative hydrogen production from organic compounds,"2.3 Fermentative hydrogen production from organic compounds Dark hydrogen fermentation is a ubiquitous phenomenon under anoxic conditions (i.e., no oxygen present as an electron acceptor). When bacteria grow on organic substrates (heterotrophic growth), these substrates are degraded by oxidation to provide building blocks and metabolic energy for growth. This oxidation generates electrons which need to be disposed of to maintain electrical neutrality. In oxic environments, oxygen is reduced and water is the product. In anoxic environments, other compounds, e.g., protons, which are reduced to molecular hydrogen (H2), need to act as electron acceptor [4,7]. In the hydrogen fermentation process, glucose is initially converted to pyruvate by the glycolytic pathways. This is oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which can be converted to acetyl phosphate and results in the generation of ATP and the excretion of acetate. Pyruvate oxidation to acetyl-CoA requires ferredoxin (Fd) reduction. Reduced Fd is oxidized by hydrogenase which generates Fd(ox) and releases electrons to produce molecular hydrogen [17,18]. The overall reaction of the process can be described as follows: (12) Pyruvate+CoA+2Fd(ox)→acetyl-CoA+2Fd(red)+CO2 (13) 2H+ +Fd(red)→H2 +Fd(ox) Anaerobic fermentation enables the mass production of hydrogen via relatively simple processes from a wide spectrum of potentially utilizable substrates, including refuse and waste products. Moreover, fermentative hydrogen production generally proceeds at a higher rate and does not rely on the availability of light sources. Carbohydrates, mainly glucose, are the preferred carbon sources for fermentation processes, which predominantly give rise to acetic and butyric acids together with hydrogen gas [18], as follows: (14) C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 (15) C6H12O6 +2H2O→CH3CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 The end-products of glucose fermentation by anaerobic and facultative anaerobic chemoheterotrophs, e.g., clostridia and enteric bacteria, are produced through pyruvate. Facultative anaerobic bacteria give 2mol of hydrogen per mol of glucose, whereas strictly anaerobic bacteria give four. Facultative anaerobes are less sensitive to oxygen, and are sometimes able to recover hydrogen production activity after accidental oxygen damage to them by rapidly depleting oxygen present in the broth. As a consequence, a facultative anaerobe is considered a better microorganism than a strict anaerobe to carry out fermentative hydrogen production process [19]. One of the main constraints of fermentative biohydrogenation process is the lower yield of hydrogen, maximally 4mol/mol glucose, compared with other processes (Table 1 ). A yield of 2mol H2/mol glucose was reported for butyrate fermentation [20]. However, by a modification of fermentation pathways only a maximum of 4mol H2/mol glucose can be expected from ideal acetate fermentation. This yield is too low to be economically viable as an alternative to existing chemical or electrochemical processes of hydrogen generation [21]. Therefore, the ultimate goal, and challenge, for fermentative hydrogen research and development focuses essentially on attaining higher yields of hydrogen. The present review provides a critical discussion of the various practical and theoretical approaches towards improvement of overall yield of hydrogen in fermentative process. 2.3.1 Hybrid system using fermentative and photosynthetic bacteria The microbial production of hydrogen by fermentation can be broadly classified into two main categories. One category, light independent bacteria could provide an integrated system for maximizing the hydrogen yield [22]. In such a system, the anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrate (or organic wastes) produces intermediates, such as low molecular weight organic acids, which are then converted into hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria in the second step in a photo-bioreactor. The overall reactions of the process can be represented as: (1) Stage I. Dark fermentation (facultative anaerobes): (16) C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 (2) Stage II. Photo-fermentation (photosynthetic bacteria): (17) 2CH3COOH+4H2O→8H2 +4CO2 So, theoretically it is evident that using glucose as the sole substrate in dark anaerobic fermentation, where acetic acid is the predominant metabolite product, a total of 12mol hydrogen could be expected in a combined process from one mol of glucose. Lee et al. studied the combination of purple non-sulfur (PNS) photosynthetic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria for the efficient conversion of wastewater into hydrogen [23]. In this study, effluents from three carbohydrate-fed reactors (CSTR, UASB) have been used for hydrogen production. In another study, Kim et al. combined dark fermentation with photo-fermentation to improve hydrogen productivity from food processing wastewater and sewage sludge [24]. Nath et al. using glucose as a substrate in the dark fermentation process have reported similar studies, and the spent medium from this process has been used as a substrate for anoxygenic phototrophic PNS bacteria for hydrogen production in photo-fermentation [18]. 2.3.2 Hybrid system using bioelectrochemical assisted bioreactor Microbial fuel cell (MFC) produces protons and electrons due to the oxidation of organic matter by the bacteria [25,26]. Protons diffuse through the electrolyte towards the cathode. The electrons travel around a circuit to the cathode, producing current. At the cathode oxygen reacts with the electrons and protons to form a reduced compound, such as water. In a bioelectrochemically assisted microbial reactor (BEAMR), hydrogen is evolved at the cathode by eliminating oxygen at the cathode, and adding a small voltage to the circuit [27] as follows: Geobacter or Shewanella sps. or Rhodoferax ferrireducens (18) C6H12O6 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 +2CH3COOH (19) Anode: CH3COOH+2H2O→2CO2 +8e− +8H+ (20) Cathode: 8H+ 8e− →4H2 The voltage at pH 7 that is required to produce hydrogen is theoretically −0.61V (V Cat; versus Ag/AgCl). The anode potential produced by the oxidation of the organic matter by the bacteria is approximately −0.50V (V an), so that the minimum theoretical applied voltage is 0.11V (V app = V an − V Cat). In practice, the minimum applied voltage to produce hydrogen from the bioelectrolysis of acetate has been found to be more than 0.25V due to ohmic resistance and electrode over potential [27] which is still substantially less than the 1.8–2.0V needed for hydrogen production via water electrolysis (alkaline conditions). The BEAMR and MFC systems share many similar characteristics and, therefore, many findings for improving electricity generation in MFCs should be applicable for increasing hydrogen production in the BEAMR system. The BEAMR process differs from MFC with respect to loss of hydrogen due to its diffusion from the cathode chamber through the cation exchange membrane (CEM) into the anode chamber. In addition, in the BEAMR process there is no potential for loss of substrate resulting from aerobic growth of bacteria due to oxygen diffusion into the anode chamber from the cathode chamber. This could allow higher Columbic efficiencies (CEs) in the BEAMR than in the MFC, but it could also affect redox conditions in the anode chamber (and the development of the bacterial community), and therefore the performance of the system."
5,Major progress in biological hydrogen production processes,"Research work in biological hydrogen production has been carried out in different areas, which are broadly classified as follows: • Development of microbial consortium, • Genetic modification of the microorganisms, • Metabolic engineering, • Effect on physico-chemical parameters, • Performances of different bioreactors, and • Use of cheaper raw material as substrate."
6,Development of microbial consortium,"3.1 Development of microbial consortium Different microorganisms participate in the biological hydrogen generation system such as green algae, cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae), photosynthetic bacteria and fermentative bacteria [4,5]. Intensive research work has been done to find out the suitability of different microorganisms for the hydrogen generation (Table 2 ). The hydrogen production by green algae could be considered as an economical and sustainable method, in terms of water utilization as a renewable resource and recycling CO2, a greenhouse gas. However, strong inhibition effect of generated oxygen on hydrogenase is the major bottleneck for the process. It has been reported that inhibition of the hydrogenase by oxygen can be partially overcome by cultivation of algae under sulfur deprivation for 2–3 days to provide anaerobic conditions under the light [5,8]. Major drawbacks of this process are low hydrogen production potential and inability to use organic wastes. The hydrogenase activity of the C. reinhardtii [200nmol/(gchl ah)] is higher than Scenedesmus sp. [150nmol/(gchl ah)] [6]. Rates of hydrogen production by photoheterotrophic bacteria are higher in the case of immobilized cells than that of the suspended cells. Continuous cultures of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata have been reported to produce H2 at rates 80ml to 100ml H2/(l of cultureh) and 40–50ml H2/(l of cultureH), respectively [7]. Major drawbacks of the photo-biological hydrogen production processes are: 1. Presence of H2-uptake enzyme, Ni–Fe hydrogenase, 2. O2 toxicity to Fe-hydrogenase and nitrogenase, 3. Requirement of light source, and 4. Scaling up problems. Different strategies have been taken to improve hydrogen production of these organisms. Photosynthetic bacteria can use different organic matter as substrate. So, this can not only be used for the hydrogen generation, but also for the bioremediation of the wastewater containing organic matters. Fermentative microorganisms such as Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Clostridium sp., Bacillus sp., etc. are found very effective for the hydrogen generation within short time as compared to photo-biological processes [34–39]. E. cloacae can tolerate little oxygen concentration because O2 favors the growth of the cells, but not the hydrogen production. The pH of the fermentation broth in case of aerobic growth will increase after 10h of fermentation, but in case of anaerobic growth it will maintain the decline profile. This organism has been successfully used for the continuous production of hydrogen [35]."
7,Genetic modification of the microorganisms,"3.2 Genetic modification of the microorganisms Knowledge on molecular fundamentals of H2 production and utilization in biological system is very much important for the basic and applied research. A tentative mechanism has been proposed for the high H2-yielding microbial strain, E. cloacae IIT-BT 08, for the transfer of electron donor to H-cluster without the mediation of the F-cluster present in hydrogenase coded gene [40–42]. Several research works have reported the use of genetically modified microorganisms. Two groups of enzymes participate in biological hydrogen metabolism: nitrogenases and hydrogenases. Nitrogenase produces H2 as the byproduct of N2-fixation period. In order to maintain the N2-fixation reaction in the desired direction, nitrogenase produces H2 in excess, which then diffuses out of the cell. Hydrogenase is the key enzyme in the biological hydrogen production processes. Major genetically modified research work is concentrated in two major areas: one is development of H2-uptake Ni–Fe hydrogenase negative mutants and the second is to produce oxygen tolerant enzymes [6,43]."
8,Metabolic engineering,"3.3 Metabolic engineering Much progress has been made in the elucidation of gene expression, structure and regulation of nitrogenase and hydrogenase. No practical and economically competitive process for the continuous production of biological H2 has been available in the market. One of the difficulties is due to the fact that H2 output represents an energy loss for the cell, and that microbial metabolic network has evolved for rationalization of energy use and optimization of specific growth rate. The study of the physiology of genetically modified photosynthetic microorganisms has shown that electron flux could be redirected to the bidirectional hydrogenase in an ndhB mutant of Synechocystis, and that a change in carbon metabolism in mutants of Rhodobacter capsulatus unable to grow photoautotrophically could affect the flow of reducing equivalents from organic substrates to nitrogenase. Increasing the flux through an existing pathway or redirecting enzyme catalyzed reactions is an approach referred to as metabolic engineering [44]."
9,Effect of physico-chemical parameters,"3.4 Effect of physico-chemical parameters Temperature, pH and medium composition play very important roles for the H2 production. Fermentative bacteria usually produces hydrogen under acidic conditions (pH 4.5–6.5), but photosynthetic bacteria works well at pH above 7 [6,9,28–33]. In case PNS photosynthetic bacteria the energy conversion efficiency is inversely proportional to the intensity of light [18]. Malate and glutamate play important roles in this fermentation process. The initial acetic acid concentration present in the spent medium of dark fermentation process has a profound effect on hydrogen production. Acetate concentration up to 55mM is found non-toxic to the photo-fermentation of hydrogen [18]. The effect of several physico-chemical parameters on the photo-biological processes has already been reported [4]. Substrate concentration affects the fermentative H2-production processes to a great extent. Glucose concentration of 1% (w/v) is found suitable [35]. Partial pressure of H2 effects the efficiency of the process to a great extends [45]. H2 production is found to be increased through redirection of metabolic pathways by blocking formation of alcohol and some organic acids in E. cloacae [46]. The fermentative H2 reduction is carried out at different temperatures: 20, 30, 35 and 55°C [47]. Higher temperatures tend to improve the H2 yield."
10,Performances of different bioreactors,"3.5 Performances of different bioreactors Different types of bioreactors have been used for biological H2-production processes, e.g. multi-layer bioreactor, UASB, rhomboidal reactor, etc. (Table 3 ). Different solid matrices are used for the immobilization of whole cells. Major problem lies on the gas-hold up, which decreases the working volume of the reactor to a great extend. This can be partially overcome by using rhomboidal bioreactors [57]. Light distribution in the photo-biological reaction can be improved by using a multi-layer photo-bioreactor [48]. The conversion efficiencies of a BEAMR can be as high as 92±6.3% with acetate, while in MFCs this varies from 10% to 78% using mixed cultures and acetate. It cannot be predicted based on MFC tests what the minimum suitable applied voltage will be for hydrogen generation in a BEAMR process for different substrates, or how current density might be affected by the applied voltage in these systems [27]."
11,Use of cheaper raw materials as substrate,"3.6 Use of cheaper raw materials as substrate Cost of the raw materials play a very important role for the overall economy of the hydrogen generation process. Different waste materials have been successfully used in different processes for the hydrogen generation (Table 4 ). Starch based wastewater has great potentiality for the H2 production [47,59]. The major problem of using industrial wastewater is the presence of components in the reaction mixture. Recently, the author observed that sewage sludge in combination with molasses improves the hydrogen yield of the process to a great extend (data not published yet). Ruminococcus albus has been found suitable for the production of H2 from energy crop such as sweet sorghum by utilizing its free sugar, cellulose and hemicelluloses [67]. H2 yield is varied from 0.47 to 2.52mol/mol glucose in continuous and batch experiments, respectively. Microcrystalline cellulose [68] and corn stover biomass pretreated with a steam-explosion process are found suitable substrates for the hydrogen production [69]. The H2 yields of 2.84 and 3.0 are obtained using the mixed sugar present in the hydrolysates derived from neutral and acidic steam explosion, respectively. Delignified wood fiber is found to produce an average yield of 1.6mol H2/mol glucose by Clostridium thermocellum 27405 in a batch system [70]"
12,Performance of two-stage processes,"3.7 Performance of two-stage processes H2 production could be significantly improved by using two-stage processes (Table 5 ). Hydrogen production with glucose by using co-immobilized cultures of a lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus delbrueckii NBRC13953, and a photosynthetic bacterium, R. sphaeroides RV, in agar gels have been studied. The maximum yield of the two-stage process is 7.1mol H2/mol glucose under illuminated conditions [71]. In another study, the hydrogen yield has been found to be 5.3mol H2/mol glucose in a two-stage process using E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 and R. sphaeroides [18]."
13,Pilot plant studies,"Very little information is available on the pilot plant studies for the biological H2 production. A pilot plant of 1.48m3 capacity has been studied continuously for 200 days. The hydrogen bio-producing reactor (HBR) system has been operated under the organic loading rates (OLR) of 3.11–85.57kg COD/m3 d with molasses as the substrate. Both biogas and hydrogen yields increase with OLR at the range of 3.11–68.21kg COD/m3 d, but decrease at high OLR (68.21–85.57kg COD/md). The biogas is mainly composed of CO2 and H2 with the percentage of H2 ranging from 40% to 52% in biogas. A maximum hydrogen production rate of 5.57m3 H2/m3 d, with a specific hydrogen production rate of 0.75m3 H2/kg MLVSS d, has been obtained in the reactor [75]. The hydrogen yield is 26.13mol/kg COD removed within OLR range of 35–55kg COD/m3 d. In addition, it has been reported that the hydrogen yield is affected by the presence of ethanol and acetate in the liquid phase, and the maximum hydrogen production rate occurred while the ratio of ethanol to acetate was close to 1. Ethanol-type fermentation was favorable for hydrogen production [79]. One pilot plant of capacity 800l is in operation at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur using immobilized whole cell (E. cloacae IIT-BT 08) bioreactor (Fig. 1 ). The rate of H2 production of the reactor is comparable with that of the bench scale data (77.3mmol H2/lh) [57]."
14,Conclusion,"Biohydrogen production has been established as a prospective alternative and integral component of green sustainable energy. A challenging problem in establishing biohydrogen as a source of energy from the renewable substrate and environmentally friendly immobilized solid matrices is the generation of large quantities of hydrogen gas. However, two major aspects need indispensable optimization, viz., a suitable renewable biomass/wastewater and ideal microbial consortia that can convert this biomass efficiently to hydrogen. E. cloacae IIT-BT 08 has greater potentiality for the hydrogen production. Comparative studies on the available processes indicate that biohydrogen production requires greater improvement on the process mainly with respect to hydrogen yield from the cheaper raw materials (Table 6 )."
15,Future goal,"Significant progress on biological hydrogen production processes has already been carried out by several research groups, but still the economy of the process is not attractive as compared to the conventional H2-production processes. The following points require immediate attention: I. Improvement of H2 yield of the processes using cheaper raw materials, II. Development of mixed microbial consortia or metagenomic approaches may be used to develop efficient microbial strains for the better utilization of industrial wastewater, which has different carbon content, III. In two-stage processes, the major bottleneck lies on the photo-fermentation process. Improvement of these processes surely will improve overall hydrogen yield as well as economy of the process."
