0,Introduction,"Particulate matters (PMs) emitted by CI engines is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as “carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)” (Pan et al., 2021a). With the gradual enhancement of people's environmental protection awareness, higher requirements and stricter emission regulations have been put forward for the equipment that affects the ecological environment, such as CI engines (Pan et al., 2021b; Wei et al., 2021a). It has been recognized that soot emissions have been a major problem that limiting the further development of CI engines, due to their unfriendly characteristics, such as causing respiratory diseases and air pollution (Wei et al., 2021b). Reducing soot emissions has become an important research direction and an important issue that needs to be solved urgently. Recently, the emergence of alternative energy provides new ideas for the development of engines, especially the addition of alcohols into fuels as alternative energy, because of its clean, renewable, and easy preparation characteristics (Shi et al., 2021; Pan et al., 2020). Studies (Rosa et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2019a) have found that the addition of short-chain alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, can reduce the soot emission from engines. Zhang et al. (2016) found that the blends of long-chain alcohols with diesel lowered the boiling point and viscosity of the blends, thus promoting evaporation of the fuel. And they concluded that the blending of long-chain alcohols (butanol and octanol) resulted in a significant reduction in soot emissions along with a slight increase in thermal efficiency. All these researches mean that the use of alcohols accomplishes the objective of low soot emissions, while maintaining the high BTE. However, it also should be pointed out that the long-chain alcohols have better auto-ignition ability and higher flame speed than short-chain alcohols (Cheung et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2018). Although alcohols, either long-chain or short-chain could simultaneously achieve the target of lower soot emissions than diesel fuels. The reason would be attributed to the different physicochemical properties of fuels. Carbon chain length has a great influence on physicochemical properties of alcohols, such as low heat value, density, and viscosity. The CC, CH, and CO bonds with different position absorb various levels of calories to breakage and recombine to release intermediate products, which substantially act on the properties of exhaust soot and ultimately on the reactivity (Le et al., 2019). Here, properties included in morphology, nanostructure, and surface functional groups (Kelesidis and Pratsinis, 2019). Soot aggregates emitted from engines are mostly chain-like or grape-like, which constituted largely by spherical particulate matter with 15–70 nm diameters (Zhu et al., 2005; Neer and Koylu, 2006) and undergoes six general steps-fuel pyrolysis, nucleation, coalescence, surface growth, agglomeration, and oxidation, all happen in little milliseconds (Kennedy, 1997). Changes to fuel with different carbon chain would trace the different formation and oxidation routes of soot, leading to the differences in morphology, nanostructure, and surface chemistry of soot in turn (Hurt et al., 2000; Vander Wal and Tomasek, 2004). Alfè et al. (2009) proposed that there was a structure-property relationship on physicochemical properties of soot. They concluded that the fuel had a great impact on chemical properties and spectral features of soot. Studies (Le et al., 2019; Vander Wal and Tomasek, 2003; Song and Lee, 2007; Yehliu et al., 2012; Song et al., 2002) have also confirmed that fuel structure affects the morphology, nanostructure, and surface chemistry of diesel soot. To understand the physicochemical properties of soot more fully, a study of different short and long-chain alcohols is indispensable. The oxidation property is an important property, which has a great influence on consumption and emission of soot particles. Aiming to reach the ultra-low emission targets, the diesel particles filter (DPF) is an excellent choice to decrease soot emissions, because of its convenience and high efficiency. Soot emitted from CI engines is collected in the inner wall of the DPF, when the engine is operating. In order to keep the high efficiency and security of DPF, the regeneration is accepted by means of oxidation and combustion (Allansson et al., 2002). However, fuel composition and engine operating conditions have a significant effect on oxidation performance (Yehliu et al., 2012; Al-Qurashi and Boehman, 2008). Wei et al. (2020a) studied the relationship between methanol content and soot oxidation. They found that with the increase in methanol, the apparent reactive energy of soot decreased. Qian et al. (2020) executed the impact of different loads, speeds, and dimethoxymethane concentration on soot nanostructure and oxidation properties, and they found that the fuels played a predominant role in the inception and precursor of soot formation, and the apparent reactive energy increased with an increase in dimethoxymethane concentration. It can be observed that with the selection of different fuels, different trends of oxidation may occur under the same working conditions. The properties of the soot particle itself are direct factors affecting the oxidation performance of the particle, such as the morphology and nanostructure of the particles. It was found that when the morphology of particle agglomerates was more chain-like, it can increase the contact area with oxygen, thus increasing the oxidation rate of the particles (Wang et al., 2019). In addition, the oxidation property also has a connection with the nanostructure of particle. It was found that amorphous carbon or less ordered soot had higher oxidation activity (lower reactive energy), compared with ordered soot (Dresselhaus et al., 1996; Rosner and Allendor, 1968). Moreover, the degree of disordered soot particle represents the absence of carbon atoms on the surface of particles. Thereby, the soot with higher disorder degree can combine more functional groups in the process of soot formation (Walker Jr et al., 1991; Goethel and Yang, 1989). As well, it was also found out that amorphous carbon can provide more adsorption sites for oxidation, so as to increase the oxidation activity of soot (Hess and Herd, 2018). Su et al. (2004) found a special fullerene-like structure in the primary particles emitted by CI engines. The temperature-programmed oxidation test results showed that there were more curved carbon layers in such a fullerene-like structure, which made the particles more accessible to be oxidized. Therefore, the oxidation characteristics of particles are closely related to their morphology and nanostructure. On the other hand, the oxygenated surface functional groups (SFGs) are also another critical factor affecting the oxidation activity of soot particles. It was found that oxygenated SFGs adsorbed on the surface of soot, such as carboxyl SFGs (-COOH) and carbonyl SFGs (-OH), can increase the oxidation activity of soot particles (Smith and Chughtai, 1995). This is because SFGs at the edge or defect on the soot surface are more likely to react with oxygen during oxidation. Müller et al. (2005) found that the oxygenated SFGs on the surface of primary particles are very active oxidation reaction centers, which can occur earlier than the carbon atoms in microcrystals at a lower temperature. Maricq (2007) found that SFGs such as hydrocarbon, carbon, and oxygen contained in soot could reduce the reactive energy of oxidation reaction and increase its oxidation activity. Su et al. (2004) compared the relationship between the oxygenated SFGs and oxidation activity of gasoline soot, diesel soot, and hexadechenodium soot, and they believed that the difference in the composition of SFGs on the surface of the three kinds of soot was the main reason for the different initial oxidation temperature. In summary, the factors affecting the oxidation properties of particles include not only the morphology and nanostructure, but also the oxygenated SFGs. Substantially, the use of different types of fuels in diesel engines will emit particle with different physicochemical properties, which affects the reactivity of the particles. However, studies on the effect of alcohol/diesel blends with different carbon chain lengths on particle properties have not been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, alcohols with different chain lengths, including methanol, n-butanol and n-octanol, were selected at two operating loads (0.6 MPa and 1. 2 MPa), and pure diesel fuel was used as the reference fuel. In addition, the oxygen content of the blended fuels was kept consistent to eliminate the effect of oxygen concentration on the particle characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of alcohol fuels with different chain lengths on the suppression of exhaust soot emissions as well as the physicochemical properties (morphology, nanostructure and oxygenated SFG) and reactivity of the soot particle. Therefore, this experiment can provide not only the theoretical guidance for the application of oxygenated fuel in practice, but also provide important reference value for the improvement of post-treatment equipment of soot particles."
1,Test equipment and methods,
2,Test engines,"2.1 Test engines In this investigation, the soot samples are collected from exhaust gases emitted by a four-cylinder, turbocharged CI engine (YC4Y22). The specific parameters of engines can be seen in Table 1 . The operation equipment and flow diagram can get it from Fig. 1 . As the soot samples have been collecting, the inlet air pressure and temperature are controlled to 0.15 MPa and 30 ± 1 °C, respectively. The oil and cooling water temperature are maintained to 84 ± 2 °C by a heat exchanger. In the test, the eddy current dynamometer (PowerLink Pulian) controlled the engine speed at 1400 rpm, and the brake mean effective pressures (BMEP) at 0.6 MPa and 1.2 MPa. ETAS INCA6.2 software is used to adjust the parameters of the electronic control system to change the parameters such as fuel injection timing (−3 °CA ATDC) and fuel injection pressure (120 MPa) for the BMEP of 0.6 MPa and 1.2 MPa. In terms of emission, the AVL415 smoke tester is used to measure the smoke emissions, and the emission quality of carbon smoke could be calculated by this parameter with the uncertainty of ±0.1%."
3,Test fuels,"2.2 Test fuels Alcohol fuels of different carbon chain lengths, including methanol, n-butanol and n-octanol, are selected for the test fuels in this paper, and pure diesel is used as the reference fuel. The properties of fuels can be seen in Table 2 . To eliminate the influence of different oxygen concentration on particle properties of blends, the oxygen content of the three blends is kept at about 5%. When preparing the blending fuel, the alcohol is first mixed with diesel fuel in an ultrasonic vibration apparatus. Then, a magnetic stirrer installed in the fuel tank is used for further stirring to obtain the unstratified mixed fuel. It is worth noting that the mixed fuel has been prepared before the experimental test to ensure the homogeneity of the mixture. Moreover, the properties of blending fuels could obtain from Table 3 . It should be noted that these properties of fuels are a relative parameter obtained by volume ratio, only partial consideration."
4,Sample analysis and collection,"2.3 Sample analysis and collection The collection of particles is carried out after the engine operating conditions have reached a stable level. As shown in Fig. 1, after the exhaust gas flows out of the exhaust pipe, it first enters the diluter, which dilutes the original exhaust gas with a dilution ratio of 10:1 to 20:1 (depending on the engine operating conditions) and reduces its temperature to below 50 °C. In addition, a vacuum pump is connected the downstream of the diluter to adsorb the exhaust gas on the TEM microgrid. It is used to analyze the morphology and nanostructure. Using the same method, a Teflon filter paper (EMFAB TX40HI20-WW, diameter 47 mm, produced by PALLFLEX) is used to collect the particles. Soot that adsorbed onto Teflon filter paper includes large amounts of unburned organic matters on the surface, which would bring errors in the analysis of oxidation property and oxygenated SFGs. Therefore, this sample is immersed in a dichloromethane solution, ultrasonically treated and centrifuged to obtain soot free of ash and organic matter. It is used for functional groups and oxidation property analysis. 2.3.1 Morphology and nanostructure parameters Morphology and nanostructures of soot sample are extracted by HRTEM (Philips TecnaiF20). And TEM images with point resolution and line resolution of 0.248 nm and 0.102 nm can be obtained at 200 kV. The device can obtain two kinds of images. The first one is TEM image with a scale of 100 nm after magnification of 20,000 times, which is used to analyze morphology and calculate the primary particle diameter (d p ) of soot particle. The second is HRTEM image with a scale of 10 nm after 40,000 times magnification, which is used to analyze the nanostructure parameters. Moreover, the uncertainties of the experiment (95% confidence interval) were estimated to be less than 15% of the primary particle diameter, and less than 20% of the nanostructure parameters and fractal dimensions, mainly due to the limited number of soot particles measured, the sampling process, and the deviation of image analysis. More information can be seen in the study (Qian et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). 2.3.2 Oxygenated SFGs of primary particles X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a device capable of analyzing the atomic or molecular electron energy of soot particles. It can obtain the element information and combination state of 3–92 elements in the periodic table of substances, and also obtain the information of oxygenated SFGs and hybrid forms on the surface of soot particles. The equipment used in this experiment is phi-1600ESCA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, which is produced by Perkin-Elmer Company in the United States. Voltage 15 kV, resolution 0.7 eV, X-ray source Al Ka (H = 1486.6 eV)/Mg Ka (HV = 1486.6 EV) double cathode target, power 400 W. This experiment mainly analyzes the information of oxygenated SFGs and its hybrid orbital, which can be directly analyzed by using the pre-treated dried soot particles. 2.3.3 Soot oxidation reaction of primary particles The thermogravimetric analyzer is a kind of equipment that using the relationship between the temperature and mass change of soot to explore the oxidation properties. The sample is oxidized to obtain the weight loss curve of the sample with the change of temperature, so as to carry out the next analysis. A Mettler-Toledo TGA/DSC1 device equipped with a platinum crucible is used for thermogravimetric analysis. In the experiment, the oxidation gas is pure oxygen (purity of 99.99%) with a flow rate of 40 ml/min. Meanwhile, in the experiment, the internal temperature is heated from 50 °C to 900 °C at a heating rate of 15 °C/min to obtain the thermogravimetric curve. Then, calculate the activation energy (E a ) according to the TGA curve (Liang et al., 2020). The uncertainty of each condition is kept below 5%. More information can obtain from literature (Wang et al., 2019)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The soot emissions of different fuels,"3.1 The soot emissions of different fuels Fig. 2 shows in-cylinder pressure (ICP), heat release rate (HRR), and the soot emissions for different fuels at different load conditions. It can be seen from Fig. 2a and b that under 0.6 MPa and 1.2 MPa load, compared with D100 fuel, the ignition start time of the mixed fuel is delayed, and the ignition start time of NB25 fuel is the latest. In addition, the NB25 fuel has the highest peak ICP. This is because the cetane number of the mixed fuel is lower than that of D100 (see Table 3), so the ignition delay (ID) time is prolonged (Pan et al., 2019b). In addition, compared with M10 fuel, NB25 fuel has the higher viscosity (see Table 3), which is not conducive to the atomization of the fuel and causes the ID time to be prolonged (Ghadikolaei et al., 2018). Moreover, compared with NO45 fuel, the NB25 fuel has a higher heat of evaporation (see Table 3), which will cause a lot of calories in the cylinder to be absorbed, which will reduce the temperature in the cylinder during the compression process, resulting in a prolonged ID time (Shahir et al., 2015). Therefore, the ID time of NB25 fuel is the longest, which is conducive to the mixing of fuel and air, improves the combustion process, and makes the peak ICP the highest (Ma et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021c). It can also be seen that the peak HRR of NB25 fuel and NO45 fuel is reduced under 1.2 MPa load. This is because the peak ICP of NB25 fuel and NO45 fuel is far from the top dead center under 1.2 MPa load, which leads to a decrease in the combustion rate and a longer combustion duration, resulting in a decrease in the peak HRR (Ghadikolaei et al., 2019). From Fig. 2c, it can be observed that with the use of alcohols, the soot emission has been greatly reduced. For example, the soot emission of M10, NB25, and NO45 reduces by 67.5%, 64.8%, and 72.9%, respectively, in the load of 1.2 MPa. There are many factors that affect soot emissions. Firstly, the addition of high content of aromatic-free fuels reduces the formation of soot precursors (Chen et al., 2012). Moreover, the OH groups in alcohols can limit the growth of precursors (Chen et al., 2013), which reduces the rate of soot nucleation, and ultimately leads to a reduction in the soot emissions from the blending fuels (Gleason et al., 2021). And then, it is found that the use of alcohols lowers the cetane number (see Table 3), leading to a longer ignition delay time (Fang et al., 2013). This can be observed from Fig. 2a and b, the ID time of the blending fuel is significantly longer than that of the D100 fuel. Thereby, the local equivalence ratio is improved, due to its high proportion of premixed phase, which results in a great reduction of soot formation (Ma et al., 2021). Moreover, the oxygen atoms in the mixed fuel can effectively reduce the occurrence of local oxygen-deficient areas in the cylinder, thereby improving the combustion process and reducing the generation of soot (Kumar et al., 2020). However, although the oxygen content of the three blended fuels is the same, the impact on soot emissions is different. When the NB25 and NO45 fuel are used, the soot emission increases in different degrees than that of M10 fuel. This is because when the carbon chain length increases, the total carbon number in the cylinder will increase, which will promote the formation of soot (McEnally and Pfefferle, 2011)."
7,Soot oxidation performance of different fuels,"3.2 Soot oxidation performance of different fuels Fig. 3a and b display the changes of mass loss curves for soot particles with various fuels under different loads conditions. It can be seen that the oxidation temperature of all soot particles begins from 450 °C to 700 °C, while the oxidation property of different fuels is different under two loads. Generally, three oxidation temperatures such as initial oxidation temperature (T i ), the maximum oxidation rate temperature (T max ) and burnout temperature (T h ) are used to evaluate the oxidation activity of soot. Among them, the T i is defined as the temperature when the soot sample reaches 10% mass loss, the T max is defined as the temperature corresponding to the maximum mass loss rate, and the T h is defined as the temperature when the soot sample reaches 90% mass loss (Liu et al., 2021). And the three oxidation temperatures extracted from the mass loss curve are shown in Table 4 . The oxidation performance of soot can also be quantified by apparent activation energy (E a ). The higher the E a is, the harder the soot oxidization. Fig. 3c shows the changes of E a with different fuel soot particles. As shown in Table 4, at low load, the soot of M10 has the lowest oxidation temperature, followed by NB25, NO45 and D100. In addition, at high load conditions, the soot of M10 is similarly oxidized first, followed by D100, NB25 and NO45. It can also be seen in Fig. 3c, the M10 soot has the lowest E a , irrespective of the operating condition. Moreover, with the use of short-chain to long-chain alcohols, the E a increases significantly. It can be concluded that with the use of short-chain to long-chain alcohols, the soot is harder to oxidize, which means soot with lower oxidation activity. In addition, it also should be pointed out that the structure of alcohols has a great influence on the oxidation property, although the three mixed fuels have the same oxygen contents. Moreover, from Table 4 and Fig. 3c, the trend of the soot oxidation performance with load varies for different fuels. When the load increases from 0.6 MPa to 1.2 MPa, the oxidation temperature and the E a of D100 soot both decrease, indicating that the soot oxidation activity increases. However, for the soot of M10, NB25 and NO45, the oxidation temperature and E a increase as the load increases. This phenomenon was also found by Wei et al. (2020a). They concluded that the increase in load could promote the nucleation and growth of soot, but the presence of alcohol fuels promoted the oxidation of soot, which exacerbated the soot deactivation and led to an increase in E a . From the above analysis, it can be seen that the oxidation activity of soot varies with the fuel type and working conditions. It is well known that the oxidation performance is closely related to the morphology, nanostructure and oxygenated SFGs of soot. Therefore, what is the most critical factor affecting the oxidation performance of soot has become a question that needs to be addressed."
8,Soot morphology and fractal features of different fuels,"3.3 Soot morphology and fractal features of different fuels 3.3.1 Soot morphology of different fuels The morphology of the particles affects the atmospheric transport properties, optical properties, and toxicological effects of the particles, for example, by controlling deposition, light scattering, and depth of penetration into the lung, respectively (Chakrabarty et al., 2006). Morphology of soot with different fuels has been confirmed that the particles are composed of dozens, hundreds of quasi-spherical primary particles, mainly in the shape of clusters, balls, and chains like branches irregulars (Neer and Koylu, 2006; Song and Lee, 2007; Yehliu et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2020a; Qian et al., 2020; Hess and Herd, 2018), as can be seen from Fig. 4 . It is also stated that the primary particles of aggregates overlap with each other (Wei et al., 2020a; Qian et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019), leading to a various compactness. Furthermore, it can be seen from the Fig. 4, the boundaries of aggregates are relatively transparent, in comparison with center section of aggregates. And the boundaries of individual primary particles are also more pronounced. This is due to the large unburned HC and free radicals in the surface of soot (Wang, 2011). It can also be observed from Fig. 4 that with the use of alcohols, the number of primary particles in the form of aggregates decreases and the size of the aggregates becomes smaller relative to diesel. That may be because the appearance of atom oxygen can improve local equivalence ratio, resulting in a decreased emission of soot (seen Fig. 2). Therefore, the reduction in collisions between particles results in less aggregate formation. Moreover, the aromatic hydrocarbon of fuels could promote the aggregation of primary particles, and then the larger size of aggregates is formed (Anna et al., 2009). However, the addition of alcohols reduces the proportion of aromatic hydrocarbon, leading to a decreased aggregate size with blending fuels. With an increase in loads, the aggregate size of soot particles increases, and there are more primary particles, as displayed in Fig. 4. It is noticed that the air-fuel ratio in the cylinder decreases with increase of load, so that the particle precursors generated by combustion increase, leading to the increase of the primary particles participating in aggregation (Qian et al., 2020). The fractal dimension (D f ) is usually used to represent the geometry of the aggregates. The smaller the D f , the smaller the overlap between the primary particles and the looser the agglomerates (R. Zhang et al., 2017). It is observed that the D f of diesel is between 2.0 and 2.2, and that of blended fuel is between 1.7 and 2.0. The results are similar to those of other researchers (Zhu et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2020a; Qian et al., 2020; Wang, 2011). From Fig. 5 , the D f of the blended fuel is significantly lower than that of pure diesel. Moreover, the D f first decreases and then increases with the use of short-chain to long-chain alcohols, and the NB25 soot has the smallest D f , irrespective of loads. The reason should be that the addition of alcohol will increase the oxygen content, thus reducing the soot formation (see Fig. 2), which will lead to a lower degree of aggregation between primary particles and thus a lower D f (Mühlbauer et al., 2016). In addition, the combined effects of low cetane number, high viscosity, and high heat of evaporation of NB25 fuel (see Table 3) resulted in the longest ignition delay (see Fig. 2). As a result, the combustion phase is delayed and the overall agglomeration time of particles is reduced, leading to a lower D f (Wei and Wang, 2021). Compared to the other blends, the NO45 has the highest viscosity, which will deteriorate the atomization process and make the soot precursor generation increase. Moreover, the higher number of carbon atoms in the molecular structure of NO45 will also contribute to the generation of soot precursors (Alexandrino et al., 2016). These factors will enhance the soot aggregation process, leading to an increase in the D f of NO45 soot. It is also interesting to note from Fig. 5 that the value of D f reduces as the increased loads, which means the degree of overlap reduces and the lower compactness of agglomerates have been obtained. The reason would be that the decrease in air to fuel ratio increases the concentration of soot, resulting in limited ballistic collisions within aggregates (Wei et al., 2020b). Thereby, the D f drops (Wei et al., 2020b; Ruiz et al., 2015; Lapuerta et al., 2007)."
9,Primary particle diameter,"3.4 Primary particle diameter Fig. S1 and Fig. 6 show the distribution of the primary particle diameter (d p ) and the mean value of d p , respectively. As can be seen from Fig. S1, the d p shows a single peak distribution in the range of 5 to 45 nm. From the Fig. 6, with the addition of alcohols, the tendency that the d p decreases can be observed compared to pure diesel. That may be due to the appearance of OH radical, which in turn promoted the combustion reaction (Ghadikolaei et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2012). At this moment, the surface growth reaction of particle, hydrogen absorption-carbon addition (HACA), is suppressed (Hua et al., 2020), leading to a decreased d p of particles, especially the preliminary stage of soot formation. Moreover, the reduction of the proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons in the blended fuel, and the improvement in the fuel-gas mixing process due to the longer ignition delay will result in the reduction of soot precursors, leading to the inhibition of the growth process of the primary particle and thus the decrease of d p . However, the mean value of d p is increased with the addition of short-chain to long-chain alcohols from M10 to NO45, eventually close to that of diesel fuels. Although the oxygen content of the three mixed fuels is the same, methanol has the shortest carbon chain length, and OH radicals are more easily decomposed from the molecules, promoting the oxidation of particles. Therefore, the M10 soot has the smallest mean value of d p (Ghadikolaei et al., 2018). In addition, due to the increase in the number of carbon atoms in the fuel structure of NB25 and NO45, the overall number of carbon atoms in the combustion environment will increase (McEnally and Pfefferle, 2011), resulting in a facilitation of the surface growth process of soot, which leads to an increase in the mean value of d p for soot of NB25 and NO45 compared to that of M10 soot. As the load increases, the proportion of larger value of d p increases as seen in Fig. S1 and the mean value of d p increases as seen in Fig. 6, irrespective of fuels. The value of d p is the result of competition between soot oxidation and surface growth (Wei et al., 2020b). When the engine is running under high load, the high-temperature environment in the cylinder can promote the soot oxidation reaction, thus inhibiting the growth of primary particles, resulting in a lower d p (Lee et al., 2002). However, under high load conditions, the air-fuel ratio in the cylinder is relatively low, and an oxygen-deficient environment will promote the generation of soot precursors. Moreover, the high temperature environment will also promote the pyrolysis of the fuel, leading to an increase in precursors (Lu et al., 2012). The increase in soot precursors will provide raw material for the surface growth of particles, leading to the production of primary particles with larger d p (Cheung et al., 2011). It can be seen that the surface growth rate of the particles exceeds the oxidation rate under the current experimental conditions, resulting in an increase in d p with increasing load."
10,Nanostructure of soot particles,"3.5 Nanostructure of soot particles As is shown in Fig. 7 , the morphologies of primary particles of different fuels are mostly spherical, but a few are elliptic or irregular in shape. The primary particles contain a lot of long or short layered structures, which are called microcrystals. It should be pointed out that most primary particles present a classical characteristic, “inner core – out shell” structure (Ishiguro et al., 1997). Ishiguro et al. (1997) concluded that the structure of soot could be divided into two parts: the inner is composed of disordered ultra-fine carbon with diameter of 4–6 nm, as can be seen from Figs. 7(a, b). The outer is made up of microcrystals with sp2 CC hybridization mostly. Hurt et al. (2000) addressed the origin of shell-core nanostructure of primary particle, and proposed that the structure of shell-core is the equilibrium configuration of planar polyaromatic clusters. It also can be observed that primary particles contain swirling multicellular structures. The structure is formed when the initial carbon from multiple fuel pyrolysis clumps together and is wrapped around by rapid surface growth. Some primary particles show uniform distribution of amorphous internal morphology, and some display alternate morphology of ordered microcrystal region and disordered microcrystal region. Therefore, the ultimate nanostructure of primary particles is determined by the collision condensation and surface reaction of particles during the formation process (Vander Wal and Tomasek, 2003, 2004; Alfè et al., 2009). Due to the difference in microcrystal composition, parameters such as fringe length (L a ), fringe separation distance (d), and fringe tortuosity (T f ) are defined to describe the fringe characteristics of primary particles (Wei et al., 2020a; Qian et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2013). The L a represents the fringe length of primary particles. The reduction of L a indicates that the internal molecular bonding is less continuous, which also means that there are more boundary defects in primary particles, thereby enhancing the oxidation of soot (Vander Wal et al., 2004). The d represents the distance between two adjacent ordered microcrystal layers in the primary particles. The larger d indicates that the internal structure of primary particles is looser, indicating that there are more isolated microcrystal layers, and the more boundary defects between the microcrystal layers (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, a larger d can promote the oxidation reaction at the edge (Vander Wal and Mueller, 2006). The T f represents the degree of curvature of the microcrystal in the nanostructure of the primary particles. It is the ratio of the size of a microcrystal to the linear distance between two endpoints of the microcrystal (Wal, 2005). The larger T f could expose more individual atoms, which is in favor of oxidizing (Li et al., 2011). The Figs. S2–S4 in the Supplementary materials displays the distribution of L a , d, and T f , respectively, and Fig. 8 shows the mean values of L a , d, and T f . From Fig. 8, it can be seen that the ranges of L a , d and T f are 1.0 nm–1.5 nm, 0.36 nm–0.40 nm and 1.2–1.5 under the two loading conditions, respectively. It can be seen that among all the fuels, the M10 soot has the smallest L a , and the largest d and T f . Therefore, it has the highest oxidation activity, that is, the lowest activation energy, which can be corroborated in Fig. 3. This is because, compared with pure diesel, the oxidation effect of OH in M10 fuel reduces the generation of soot precursors, resulting in the inhibition of the growth of microcrystal layers, which reduces the ordering of microcrystals, resulting in a decrease of L a and an increase of d and T f (Xu et al., 2013). In addition, compared with the long-chain alcohol fuels, the M10 fuel has the shortest carbon chain length, which is more favorable for OH decomposition and enhances the oxidation of soot precursors. Moreover, the M10 fuel has the lowest viscosity, leading to a better atomization process, which reduces the generation of precursors. These factors inhibit the growth of soot microcrystalline layers, resulting in the M10 soot has the smallest L a , and the largest d and T f (Tree and Svensson, 2007; Y. Zhang et al., 2017). However, as the use of alcohols from M10 to NO45, the L a increases, both the d and T f reduce, which means a less defected primary particle is formed. The reason would be that to maintain the oxygen contents in the blending fuels, the proportion of alcohols is increased, such as 25% butanol and 45% octanol. Study has found that aromatic hydrocarbons are more likely to produce small molecular groups such as acetylene and propargyl than normal alkanes, which contributes to the formation of C5 ring structure (Howard, 1991). The increase of C5 structure causes the internal microcrystal bending of primary particles (Vander Wal and Tomasek, 2003), thus increasing the extrinsic defects of the particles. Therefore, the high content of alcohol reduces the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons, resulting in a decrease in extrinsic defects, leading to a reduction in the reactivity of the particles. For the same fuel, it can be seen from Figs. S2–S4 that the L a , d and T f vary greatly with the load. As the load increases, the proportion of microcrystal with larger L a and smaller d and T f increases. It is also observed that as the load increases, the mean value of L a increases and both d and T f decrease. That is, the higher load makes the soot more regular and less oxidation active, which may be attributed to the higher in-cylinder temperature. First of all, Vander et al. (Vander Wal and Tomasek, 2003) believed that under high-temperature environment, the fuel tended to be cracked into small molecular fragments (such as C2H2). And the addition action of small molecular fragments such as C2H2 made the surface of the growing PAHs have more active sites, which were easy to participate in the thermodynamic reaction and finally generate a more stable and orderly carbon layer structure under the high-temperature conditions (Al-Qurashi et al., 2011). On the other hand, the higher temperature and pressure not only enhance the oxidation reaction of the surface microcrystal of newly formed primary particles, but also promote the process of transforming the C5 structure that causes microcrystal bending to a more regular C6 structure (Howard, 1991). As a result, the structure of soot is more orderly at high load."
11,Oxygenated surface functional groups of primary particles,"3.6 Oxygenated surface functional groups of primary particles The XPS not only be used to analyze the distribution of elements, functional groups, and the degree of hybridization of carbon atoms on the surface of primary particles, but also can provide information such as the composition and content of the surface elements of soot particles (Parent et al., 2016). According to the type of carbon hybridization and the different surface functional groups, the carbon peak is resolved into six peaks, the peak position is around 283.6 eV, 284.4 eV, 285.1 eV, 285.9 eV, 286.7 eV, and 289.2 eV, representing sp., sp2, sp3, CO, CO, and COO, respectively (Gaddam and Vander Wal, 2013) (see Fig. 9 ). As can be seen from Fig. 9, sp2 and sp3 hybridization are the main forms of carbon atoms in the particles emitted by CI engines, and the sp2 is the most important form. The ratio of sp3 and sp2 content is usually used to characterize the structural characteristics of particles (Gaddam and Vander Wal, 2013). The increase of sp3 content means the increase of the disorder degree of particles. In addition, the percentage content of the oxygenated functional groups (CO, CO, and COO) on the surface of the soot particles can also be obtained through the deconvolution of the C1s peak (Vander Wal et al., 2011). The oxygenated surface functional groups (SFGs) are intermediate products in the oxidation reaction of soot particles with OH and O, and may be decomposed into CO2 and CO during combustion process (Williams, 2008). Fig. 10 shows the contents of oxygenated SFGs such CO, CO, and COO with different fuels. From Fig. 10, the proportion of CO, CO, and COO accounts for 1%–7%, 1%–12%, and 0.5%–3.5%, respectively. And in most working conditions, the concentration of CO is the highest, followed by CO and COO SFGs in the exhaust soot particles. Compared with CO and COO, more CO groups are produced in the exhaust gases, which means the CO groups have higher thermodynamic stability (Vander Wal et al., 2010). As well, it also indicates that the CO groups are harder to oxidize during the combustion process. It is obvious from Fig. 10 that the proportion of all oxygenated SFGs increases with increasing load. This may because under high load, the high-temperature and high-pressure environment in the cylinder promote the reaction of the particles with OH and O, which results in the generation of more oxygenated SFGs intermediates (Liu et al., 2016). Moreover, the concentration of oxygenated SFGs on the particle surface depends on the result of the competition between the rate of oxidation group generation and the rate of group consumption (Vander Wal et al., 2011). Therefore, the differences in physicochemical properties of different fuels lead to the irregular variation of oxygenated SFGs."
12,Soot oxidation reactivity correlation analysis,"3.7 Soot oxidation reactivity correlation analysis In order to explore the key physicochemical parameters affecting soot oxidation activity, Fig. 11 shows the relationship between apparent activation energy (E a ) and parameters such as fractal dimension (D f ), primary particle diameter (d p ), nanostructure (L a, d, T f ) and oxygenated SFGs (CO, CO, and COO). As can be seen from Fig. 11a, in terms of soot morphology, the d p has a high linear correlation with the E a , with an R2 of 0.52. This is because, a smaller d p implies an increase in the specific surface area of the aggregates, which facilitates oxygen penetration and thus enhances the oxidation of soot (Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, it can also be seen from Fig. 11a that the D f has almost no correlation with the oxidation activity of soot, which is consistent with the conclusion of Wei et al. (2020b). From Fig. 11b, the nanostructure of soot has a close linear correlation with E a . The corresponding R2 of L a , d and T f reaches 0.60, 0.71 and 0.66, respectively. It can be seen from the fitting line that, with the decrease of L a and the increase of d and T f , the E a significantly decreases, indicating the increase of oxidation activity. The specific reasons have been described above. As can be seen from Fig. 11c, the oxygenated SFGs have almost no linear correlation with Ea. The results propose a stronger support that the nanostructure of soot is more influence than oxygenated SFGs in leading soot oxidation behavior in this investigation. Although it is not consistent with Song et al. (2006), who believes that the oxygenated SFGs have a greater influence than the structure and size distribution. But it coincides with the study of Yehliu et al. (2012), who indicates that there no relation between soot reactivity and oxygenated SFGs, but shows a strong correlation of reactivity and nanostructure."
13,Conclusion,"The oxidation property, morphology, nanostructure, and oxygenated SFGs of exhaust soot have conducted comprehensively, some conclusion can be obtained with methanol, n-butanol, n-octanol and diesel fuels. 1. The alcohol-diesel blends can significantly reduce soot emissions. Compared with pure diesel, the soot emissions of M10, NB25 and NO45 are reduced by 67.5%, 64.8% and 72.9%, respectively, when the BMEP = 1.2 MPa. 2. The oxidation temperature of all soot particles emitted from exhaust gases begins from 450 °C to 700 °C. When the load is low, the soot of M10 is the first to oxidize, followed by NB25, NO45 and D100, but when the load is high, the M10 soot is the first to oxidize, followed by D100, NB25, and NO45. 3. The use of alcohol fuels reduces the D f of soot compared to pure diesel fuel, and the NB25 soot has the smallest D f , which means that the soot has the loosest agglomerates structure. Moreover, the D f decreases with increasing load, irrespective of the fuel. 4. The d p of different fuels presents a single peak distribution with the range from 5 to 45 nm. Compared with pure diesel, the addition of alcohol can significantly reduce the mean value of d p . However, with the use of short-chain to long-chain alcohols, the mean value of the d p increases, eventually close to that of diesel fuel. 5. With the use of short-chain to long-chain alcohols, the L a of the microcrystal increases, while the d and T f decrease, implying a decrease in boundary defects, which is not favorable for soot oxidation. 6. In terms of oxygenated SFGs, the proportion of CO, CO, and COO accounts for 1%–7%, 1%–12%, and 0.5%–3.5%, respectively. The CO groups have a relatively high thermodynamic stability with respect to the groups of CO and COO. 7. The d p and the nanostructure of soot is more influence than D f and oxygenated SFGs in leading soot oxidation behavior in this investigation. In particular, the d of microcrystals has very significant linear correlation with the oxidation activity of soot. Based on the results of current work, the soot oxidation reactivity is dominated by the primary particle diameter and the nanostructure of soot. This research can provide a theoretical reference for the collaborative control of particulate emissions through in-cylinder combustion and diesel particulate filtration technology. In future studies, more work should be devoted on the influence of the alcohol with different carbon chain length on graphitization degree and aliphatic CH of diesel engine exhaust soot. Meanwhile, research on the influence of alcohol isomers on the properties of particles should be carried out. Also, a method of Partial least squares (PLS) or principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to elucidate the relationship between the oxidation reactivity and physicochemical properties of soot particles, based on more data (various fuel blending and operation conditions) available."
