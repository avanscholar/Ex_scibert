0,Introduction,"Skin is the largest organ of the human body and plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis and preventing microbial invasion [1,2]. However, skin damage causes bacterial infection, tissue dehydration, and serious secondary trauma [3–5]. The high-water content, excellent biocompatibility, and porous 3D structure of hydrogels make them ideal wound dressings to treat skin damage. Yet, poor mechanical properties, lack of antibacterial properties, and complicated preparation methods limit their application as wound dressings. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels see significant use as wound dressings because of their small-molecule permeability, low interfacial tension, soft consistency, transparency, and antibiotic release control [6,7]. Although tacky mechanical properties limited their potential as wound dressings, fillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene oxide, and bacterial cellulose [8–10] can improve the mechanical properties of PVA. In contrast to other fillers, bacterial cellulose (BC) has more obvious advantages which include: naturally occurring, biodegradation, and a nano-fibrous structure. The mechanical characteristics of a PVA hydrogel can be enhanced based on the nano-fibrous structure of BC and the formation of hydrogen bonds between BC and PVA. Importantly, BC hydrogels have high bioactivities, which promote migration of epithelial and fibroblast cells that leads to the acceleration of tissue formation [11]. As expected in wound treatments, BC hydrogels showed high exudate absorption capacities, effective moisture maintenance, and significant healing rate improvements [12]. Moreover, BC hydrogels, like PVA hydrogels, lack antibacterial abilities, which limits their application as a wound dressing. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have a range of antibacterial activities and have been widely used in wound dressings. Introducing AgNPs into a hydrogel not only improves its antibacterial properties but can also enhance its mechanical characteristics to an extent. Toxic chemical reductants were originally used to improve the preparation efficiency of silver nanoparticles, imposing a potentially negative impact on the cell and its tissue. Compared with toxic chemical reductants, natural compounds such as glucose [13] and polyphenol compounds [14] are also used as AgNP reducing agents. To that end, we examined PVA and BC as green reducing agents for AgNPs preparation. To this day, chemical cross-linking methods are commonly used to prepare PVA hydrogels. Reagents such as formaldehyde [15], glutaraldehyde [16], epichlorohydrin [17], carbonized diimine [18], transglutaminase [19], maleic anhydride [20], and genipin [21] all possess high cytotoxicity and complicate hydrogel preparation. Compared with other chemical methods, physical cross-linking depends primarily on the formation of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds and avoids the drawbacks of chemical cross-linking. The BC polymer contains multiple hydroxy groups that interact with hydroxyl groups on PVA to form the hydrogen bonds necessary for hydrogel synthesis. Taken together, this study developed a novel green preparation method of silver-carrying bacterial cellulose. BC and PVA reduced nano silver in the NaOH/urea green solvent system and the hydrogel was prepared using a freeze-thaw technique that results in significant loading of silver onto composite materials and overcomes the disadvantages of chemical reducing and cross-linking agents. This material is inexpensive, with high mechanical properties, distinctive antibacterial properties, efficient biocompatibility, and effective promotion in wound healing."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Glucose, disodium hydrogen phosphate, citric acid, silver nitrate, sodium hydroxide, urea were purchased from China National Pharmaceutical Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd. Peptone, yeast extract, Agar, PVA (molecular weight 205 KD) were purchased from Sigma company. A CCK8 kit, DMEM medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA digestion solutions were all purchased from Solarbio Technology Beijing Co., Ltd. Hematoxylin-eosin/HE (H&E) Staining Kit, 4% Paraformaldehyde, 5% Bovine Serum Albumin, and CD31 Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd., US. All chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. Acetobacter xylinum (ATCC 53582, Manassas, VA, US), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and L929 mouse skin fibroblasts were all obtained from ATCC, the Global Bioresource Center."
3,Preparation of BC,"2.2 Preparation of BC Acetobacter xylinum (ATCC 53582, Manassas, VA, US) was cultured in an HS medium [22]. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.4 and underwent fermentation at 28 °C for 7–10 days. The upper BC film was collected and placed in a 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution at 80 °C for 40 min to remove the residual medium and other impurities remaining on the film surface [23]. The BC film was repeatedly rinsed with distilled water until the pH was 7.0. The film was freeze-dried for preservation."
4,Preparation of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-AgNPs composite hydrogels,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-AgNPs composite hydrogels The BC dry film was converted into BC powder via mechanical grinding and then sieving through a 200-mesh filter. A 2.0 g sample of BC powder was added slowly to a precooled solution (48 g NaOH, urea, H2O mixture (7:12:81, w/w) at −12 °C for 30 min) and stirred mechanically for 5 min at 2000 r/min to make a transparent BC solution [24]. Solutions containing PVA (10%) and different amounts of AgNO3 (0, 1, 2, and 4 mM) were added to the BC solutions (1:1, v/v) and stirred at 60 °C for 1 h. The solutions were transferred to Petri dishes and underwent four additional freeze-thaw cycles (8 h, −20 °C; 3 h, room temperature) to form the hydrogels. Table 1 details the specific reaction conditions. The hydrogels were washed repeatedly with distilled water until the pH reached 7.0. The hydrogels were abbreviated as PVA/BC, PVA/BC-Ag1, PVA/BC-Ag2, and PVA/BC-Ag3."
5,Hydrogel characterization,"2.4 Hydrogel characterization The physicochemical compositions of the hydrogel samples were characterized by SEM (Zeiss ULTRA Plus, Germany), FTIR (Thermo Nicolet iS10, USA), XRD (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Germany), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi, England)."
6,Mechanical properties test,"2.5 Mechanical properties test The hydrogel samples were cut into 12 cm × 2 cm rectangular cubes. A universal testing machine (Shimadzu AGS-X 500 N, Japan) determined the tensile strength and elongation breaking points of the hydrogels. The test temperature was 25 °C, the humidity was 25%, and the tensile rate was 20 mm/min. Each sample was tested three times and took the mean as the result."
7,Water binding characteristics,"2.6 Water binding characteristics PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were dried, weighed, and placed in an SBF solution. After water absorption and expansion at 37 °C for 24 h, filter paper absorbed the residual SBF solution and the mass of the wet sample was determined. The swelling rate (SR) was calculated using Eq. (1): (1) SR % = W T − W 0 W 0 × 100 % where W0 and WT represent the sample weights before and after water absorption, respectively. The water retention ability of the samples was also evaluated. The initial weights (Wd) of all PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were determined, then soaked in SBF solution at 37 °C for 24 h. The samples were wiped with filter paper to remove excess water. The samples were centrifuged at 500 r/min for ~5 min, removed and reweighed (Ww) temperature at predetermined intervals. Each sample was measured three times. Moisture retention capability (MRC) was calculated using Eq. (2): (2) MRC % = W w − W d W d × 100 %"
8,Antimicrobial activity of composite hydrogels,"2.7 Antimicrobial activity of composite hydrogels The antimicrobial properties of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were tested using previously published literature methods [25]. E. coli and S. aureus were inoculated into the LB medium and placed on a shaking table at 37 °C for 4 h. The two strains were subsequently diluted to 106 CFU/mL with the medium. The PVA/BC, PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels with 1 cm diameters were placed in a shaking bacterium tube containing 10 mL diluent and cultured at 37 °C for an additional 6 h. A 100 μL hydrogel-treated bacterial solution was taken and coated on an LB solid medium. Bacterial strain growth was observed after standing culture at 37 °C for 24 h, and the bacterial inhibition rate was calculated using the PVA/BC hydrogel diluted bacterial solution as the control group. The bacteriostatic rate (R) can be calculated according to Eq. (3): (3) R % = C 0 − C T C 0 × 100 % C0 and CT represent the number of bacteria in PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels treatment groups after 24 h, respectively. Each experiment was performed in triplicate to ensure data accuracy. E. coli and S. aureus were co-cultured with PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels for 6 h. After bacteria isolation, cell viability was observed via live/dead assays and the integrity of the cell membrane was observed by laser confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SPE) [26]."
9,In vitro cytotoxicity study,"2.8 In vitro cytotoxicity study 2.8.1 Culture of L929 cells L929 mouse skin fibroblasts were used to evaluate the biocompatibility of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels according to ISO 10993-5:2009 guidelines. Healthy cells were cultured in DMEM complete medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamate, 4.5 g/L glucose and 1% fungal antibiotics) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and saturated humidity. The cells were arranged into 3 × 104/mL single-cell suspensions in the new medium for the following experiments. 2.8.2 Cytotoxicity of composite hydrogels on L929 cells in vitro Cell activity was measured by the CCK-8 method. PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were cut into discs with a diameter of 0.75 cm, sterilized with ethylene oxide (100%) at a relative humidity of 50 °C for 2 h, then desorbed at 37 °C for 3 days. The discs were placed in 12-well plates supplemented with culture medium and incubated for 24 h; a 2 mL single-cell suspension (concentration 3 × 104/mL) was added into each well and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and saturated humidity for 1, 2, and 4 days. The medium was changed every two days. A 200 μL aliquot of CCK-8 was added into each well after replacing the medium and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Absorbances at 450 nm were measured using a microplate microscope (MULTISKAN MK3, Thermo, USA). The pores containing only L929 cells without hydrogels were used as the control group and the cell survival rate (CSR) was calculated according to Eq. (4): (4) CSR % = A sample − A blank A control − A blank × 100 % A (sample): Absorbance of pores with cells, CCK-8 solution and hydrogels; A (blank): Absorbance of pores with medium, CCK-8 solution, without cells; A (control): Absorbance of pores with cells, CCK-8 solution, without adding hydrogels. 2.8.3 The morphological observation of L929 cells on the hydrogels After the cell suspensions were inoculated with hydrogels for 1, 2 and 4 days, hydrogel discs were gently collected and subsequently washed with sterile PBS. The samples were dyed in the dark for 20 min using an AO/EB staining dye. The hydrogel discs were washed with sterile PBS three times, and the cell growth state was observed by laser confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SPE) [27]."
10,Study on wound healing,"2.9 Study on wound healing The wound healing abilities of PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were evaluated using male Kunming mice (weighing 25–30 g, purchased from Lanzhou Veterinary Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences). The animals were randomly divided into four groups, including a control group (without any treatment), a PVA/BC hydrogel group and two PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel groups. Three parallel experiments were conducted for each group. All animals were separately reared and the bedding material changed every day. All animals had free access to food and water and followed guidelines established by the Animal Ethics, Care and Use Committee of Basic Medical College of Lanzhou University. All animal experiments strictly adhered to the guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals to minimize injury and pain. All animal execution procedures followed the Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2020 Edition). PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were sterilized by the method described in Section 2.8.2. All operations were performed in the operating room to ensure aseptics and antisepsis. The mice were fully anesthetized (1% pentobarbital intraperitoneal injection), the hair on the operated area was removed and washed three times with an alcohol/chlorhexidine mixture. The skin was removed with a scalpel to create a 1 cm × 1 cm artificial wound. The wound surfaces in the hydrogel groups were covered with a 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm composite material and fixed with medical sterile rubbers and gauzes; the control group received no treatment. All animals were fully awake 1–3 h after the operation, free movement and no pain response. The dressings were changed every three days. The animals were observed after the operation, and wound recoveries and infections were recorded. At the end of the experiments, all animals were anesthetized and euthanized in accordance with the protocol approved by the Animal Ethics, Care and Use Committee of Basic Medical College of Lanzhou University. We measured the wound area after 5, 10, and 15 days; the wound healing rate (WHR) was calculated using Eq. (5): (5) WHR % = A 0 − A t A 0 × 100 % A0 represents the original wound size, and At represents the wound size on day ‘t’."
11,Histological and immunohistochemically analyses,"2.10 Histological and immunohistochemically analyses The mice were anesthetized and euthanized, and wound skins obtained on days 5, 10, and 15 were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 μm thick tissue sections. The slices were stained with H&E and observed by an inverted microscope (Nikon TS2, Japan). Healing tissues taken on day 15 were conducted with immunohistochemically staining for angiogenesis detection. The slices were sealed in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibody CD31 (Boster Biological Technology). After incubation with secondary antibodies for 2 h, images were captured randomly in the location of the wound healing area and were observed with an inverted microscope (Nikon TS2, Japan) with a magnification of 200 ×. Finally, three fields were randomly chosen in each sample to count and analyze for positive expression of CD31 using the software Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) [28]. The specific process was to convert the image into 8-bit, adjust the threshold, remove the background, determine the cell contour, and automatically analyze and count the positive cells."
12,Statistical analyses,2.11 Statistical analyses All data were collected as mean ± SD values and statistically analyzed with Spass17.0 software. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) determined differences between all data groups. The levels of significant were set at *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.
13,Results and discussion,
14,Hydrogel synthesis,"3.1 Hydrogel synthesis To prepare PVA/BC-Ag antibacterial hydrogels, BC solutions were prepared by adding BC to a green sodium hydroxide/solution, PVA solutions with different amounts of AgNO3 were introduced into the BC solutions and heated at 60 °C to promote the formation of AgNPs. To synthesize the hydrogel, we adopted a physical cross-linking method rather than a chemical cross-linking method to avoid the potential toxicity of some chemicals to cells. Scheme 1 depicts the detailed preparation process."
15,3D network morphology of the hydrogels,"3.2 3D network morphology of the hydrogels SEM characterized the microstructures of the samples. Fig. 1 a shows the micromorphology of the PVA/BC hydrogel as well as the interwoven fiber network structure of BC and PVA that formed uniform honeycomb pores with diameters from 1 to 2 μm. Fig. 1b, c and d shows SEM images of the PVA/BC-Ag composite hydrogels with different silver contents. Compared with the PVA/BC hydrogel, the pore structure of the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels contained more irregularly serrated and wedge-shaped structures. The surface became more irregular and the pore diameters of the honeycomb structures increased to approximately 3–5 μm. These honeycomb structures made the hydrogels more conducive to oxygen exchange, moisture maintenance and cell adhesion and growth [29]. Fig. 1e–h shows optical images of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels with different silver contents, the hydrogel color deepened with increasing levels of AgNPs and confirmed that AgNPs were successfully introduced into the hydrogels."
16,Construction and characterization of the composite hydrogel,"3.3 Construction and characterization of the composite hydrogel Fig. 2 a shows FTIR spectra of BC, PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag. The wide peak between 3300 and 3400 cm−1 corresponds to a stretching vibration caused by intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds of -OH [30]. The peak around 2920 cm−1 is the tensile vibration of CH bonds, the peak at 1630 cm−1 is the symmetric stretching of an -OH group. The peak at 1420 cm−1 was attributed to a symmetric bending vibration of CH, the peak at 1080 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of CO bonds [31]. The absorption peaks ~840 and 910 cm−1 are characteristic absorption peaks of glucose glycoside bonds [32]. Compared with BC and PVA, in the spectra of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag, stretching vibration peaks caused by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds ~3300–3400 cm−1 became wider and moved towards lower wavenumbers, which indicated the formation of hydrogen bonds by interactions between BC and PVA [33]. The hydroxyl peaks of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag composites were 3403 cm−1 and 3397 cm−1, respectively, which indicated the addition of Ag enhanced the cross-linking effect [34]. Fig. 2b shows the UV–Vis spectra of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag nanocomposites. BV/PVA had no absorption peaks between 300 and 600 nm, but PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels had a typical absorption peak near 425 nm. The absorption peak strength increased with increasing silver nitrate levels in the reaction system, confirmed the presence of additional AgNPs, and agreed with previous literature reports [35–37]. Fig. 2c shows the XRD patterns of BC, PVA, and PVA/BC hydrogels. The BC film showed three characteristic peaks at 14.60°, 16.82°, and 22.78°, which corresponded to the (110), (110), and (200) crystal surfaces of bacterial cellulose, and belong to the crystalline structure of cellulose I (JCPDS no. 50-2241) [38,39]. For PVA, there are two strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.7° and 40.6°, corresponding to the (101) and (200) crystal faces of PVA and were assigned to the PVA crystal structure (JCPDS no .53-1487) [40]. The XRD peaks of PVA/BC hydrogels at 12.03 and 21.05° correspond to the crystalline structure of cellulose II, indicating that BC dissolves, regenerates, then produces a lower type II cellulose [17]. Fig. 2d shows the XRD diagram of the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel. The peaks at 12.06° and 19.6° are characteristic cellulose and PVA peaks. New peaks occur at 37.95, 44.13, 64.25, and 77.12° that correspond to the crystal lattice (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of silver elements. These results agree with the standard powder diffraction peaks of AgNPs (JCPDS no. 89-3722) and confirmed the incorporation of silver nanoparticles into the PVA/BC three-dimensional network [41,42]. Meanwhile, the intensity of the AgNPs diffraction peaks increased with additional AgNO3, which indicated that AgNPs came from the reduction of AgNO3 via the reductive role of BC and PVA."
17,XPS analyses of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag,"3.4 XPS analyses of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag The elemental compositions of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with results shown in Fig. 3 . The XPS survey scan results showed that PVA/BC was mainly composed of carbon and oxygen. Compared with PVA/BC, the PVA/BC-Ag spectrum showed incorporation of Ag into the composite, which indicated that AgNPs were successfully introduced into the PVA/BC hydrogels (Fig. 3a, b). Fig. 3c and d depicts the high-resolution Ag3d spectra of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag. There is no obvious peak in PVA/BC, indicating there was no Ag present in PVA/BC. The bimodal peaks near 368.25 eV and 374.27 eV in the PVA /BC-Ag hydrogel correspond to the binding energies of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 of AgNPs, respectively [43,44]. This also confirmed the successful reduction of silver in the PVA/BC system and agreed with X-ray diffraction and UV–Vis results. Production of AgNPs may be attributed to BC and PVA acting as reducing agents in an alkaline environment. In the sodium hydroxide/urea system, BC and PVA contain many hydroxyl groups with some reductive abilities that can efficiently reduce silver ions into AgNPs [23,45]."
18,Mechanical properties of the wound dressing,"3.5 Mechanical properties of the wound dressing Good mechanical properties have an important influence on the application of hydrogels. In practical applications, the wound surface will conform to the movements in the human body, thus wound dressings require better mechanical properties, especially tensile properties. Fig. 4 shows the mechanical properties of PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels. The stress-at-break and maximum elongation-at-break of PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels improved relative to PVA/BC. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of PVA/BC-AgNPs initially increased, then decreased with increasing amounts of AgNPs. Also, the AgNPs were dispersed uniformly within the PVA/BC hydrogel, enhanced the crosslinking between PVA and BC and improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogels [46]. However, additional increases in the amount of added AgNPs resulted in the formation of a large number of AgNP particles due to their tendency to agglomerate and affected the formation of hydrogel network and the mechanical properties [47]. The enhancement of nanosilver on the mechanical properties of PVA hydrogels has been observed by others, though these hydrogels were prepared by solvent casting and CaCl2 crosslinking [46,48–50]. In this study, PVA did not form a gel after the freeze-thawing method. However, the tensile strength and elongation-at-break of the PVA/BC hydrogel formed by freeze-thaw crosslinking after regeneration were 51.68 kPa and 159.70%, respectively. Notably, the tensile strength and elongation-at-break for the PVA/BC-Ag2 hydrogel reached 89.2 kPa and 215.6%, respectively, after compounding with nanosilver. These improvements corresponded to increases of 34.98% and 72.53% as compared to the PVA/BC hydrogel. Unlike pure BC (23.24 MPa, 15.03%), the tensile strength of the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel decreased, and the elongation-at-break increased significantly [51]. The elongation of the skin was approximately 70% in the flexible zones [52]. In general, these PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels can be used as an antibacterial dressing in the most flexible zones."
19,Water absorption and retention analysis,"3.6 Water absorption and retention analysis An ideal hydrogel wound dressing should possess the following characteristics to promote wound healing. On one hand, it should have good adsorption to ensure timely absorption of excess liquid on the wound surface. On the other hand, a moist gel should form on the wound surface and create a moist environment to avoid hydrogel adherence to the wound [53,54]. Therefore, BC, PVA/BC, and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were immersed in an SBF solution for 24 h to study their water absorption capacity. As shown in Fig. 5 a, PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels showed certain water absorption performance after the addition of PVA. Compared with PVA/BC, PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels absorbed better than the PVA/BC hydrogel and may be due to pore enlargement and superior water holding capacity of AgNP-containing hydrogels [46]. The swelling rate of PVA/BC-Ag3 reached 1604.9 ± 58.2%, which was significantly higher than PVA and chitosan [55]. The high swelling rate of PVA/BC-Ag3 ensures a high absorption ability to the exudate. Fig. 5b shows the results of water retention measurements on PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels. The water retention capacity of the hydrogels decreased over time. Specifically, the PVA/BC group had a water retention capacity of ~24.19%, which was larger than PVA/BC-Ag-1 (20.84%), PVA/BC-Ag-2 (17.49%) and PVA/BC-Ag-3 (12.38%) hydrogels after air exposure for 6 h. In contrast to the PVA/BC hydrogel, the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel has a higher porosity, which facilitated the escape of moisture during dehydration [56]. Overall, the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels had porous structures, high swelling capacities, and good water retention abilities that helped absorb the exudate and kept the wound surface moist and make them potential materials for wound dressing uses."
20,Antibacterial activity assessment,"3.7 Antibacterial activity assessment The antibacterial activity of the hydrogels was studied via co-culturing the most common skin infected species (E. coli and S. aureus) with the hydrogels, bacterial growth was observed by a plate counting method. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the PVA/BC hydrogel does not possess antibacterial activity. PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels showed antibacterial ability that increased with increasing levels of AgNPs. The bactericidal rates of PVA/BC-Ag1 against E. coli and S. aureus were 65.63 ± 2.63% and 51.17 ± 1.49%, respectively. PVA/BC-Ag3 had 99.72 ± 0.14% and 99.38 ± 0.48% antibacterial rates against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively (Fig. 6b). There was a significant difference between the PVA/BC and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel groups (P<0.01). The antibacterial properties of the hydrogels were evaluated using fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide (FDA/PI) fluorescent staining. Living bacteria stained by FDA fluoresce green, while dead bacteria stained by PI fluoresce red [57]. As shown in Fig. 6c, most bacteria were stained green rather than red for PVA/BC, which indicated the PVA/BC hydrogel had low antibacterial ability. For PVA/BC-Ag3, most bacteria were stained red and clearly indicated the bacteria were effectively killed. These results were consistent with results observed by plate counting and further confirmed the introduction of AgNPs into the hydrogel effectively conferred antibacterial properties to the hydrogel."
21,Hydrogel cytotoxicity measurement,"3.8 Hydrogel cytotoxicity measurement Antibacterial activity and biocompatibility are important metrics used to evaluate the use of hydrogels as wound dressings [29]. According to ISO 10993-5:2009, hydrogel materials were cultured with cells for at least 24 h; when cell viability exceeds 75%, the material is deemed to have no cytotoxicity [58]. Biocompatibility was evaluated by culturing L929 cells with hydrogels at specified times (1, 2, and 4 days), and the cell viability was subsequently determined by the CCK-8 method (Fig. 7 ). The cell survival rate slowly increased with prolonged culture time and ranged from 96% to 134%, which was significantly higher than 75%. After four days of culture, the survival rates of L929 cells on PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels were higher than the PVA/BC hydrogel and control group, and the PVA/BC-Ag3 hydrogel had the highest survival rate of L929 cells. There was a significant difference between the control group and the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01), which may be due to the pore diameter enlargement that resulted in a three-dimensional environment for cell adhesion and nutrient transportation, and facilitated the growth of L929 cells [59,60]. The CCK8 results were further confirmed by AO/EB staining. As shown in Fig. 8 , the cell density of the PVA/BC-Ag3 hydrogel increased as the coculture time increased, was significantly higher than the other hydrogels by day 4, and consistent with CCK-8 results. No obvious red fluorescence was observed in Fig. 8 for any group and suggested the viability of L929 cells with PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels was not due to the amount of AgNPs, and PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels have good cytocompatibility [61,62]."
22,In vivo evaluation of wound healing,"3.9 In vivo evaluation of wound healing As shown in Fig. 9 a, a 1 cm × 1 cm thick wound was made on the back of the mouse. A skin healing model was established. The wound-healing effect was studied by the hydrogels covering treatment. All animals had good appetites, normal weight growth and wound healing. The wound closure rate was measured after treatment for 5, 10, 15 days; those results are shown in Fig. 9b. After five days, the wound contraction of the control group was only 7.71 ± 0.57%. For the PVA/BC, PVA/BC-Ag1, and PVA/BC-Ag3 groups, the wound contraction was 17.50 ± 1.73%, 23.72 ± 2.44%, and 26.62 ± 2.65%, respectively. After 10 days, the control group showed a contraction of 14.59 ± 1.99%, while the PVA/BC, PVA/BC-Ag1, and PVA/BC-Ag3 groups had contractions of 35.02 ± 2.22%, 53.13 ± 3.74%, and 66.69 ± 2.42%, respectively. After 15 days, the contraction of the control group was 47.74 ± 4.13% while for the PVA/BC, PVA/BC-Ag1, and PVA/BC-Ag3 groups, their contractions were 61.13 ± 5.37%, 77.62 ± 3.59%, and 97.89 ± 0.97, respectively. There was a significant difference between the control group, the PVA/BC group and the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The wounds treated by PVA/BC-Ag composite hydrogels showed better wound healing rates relative to the control and the PVA/BC groups, indicating that PVA/BC-Ag was more conducive to wound healing after the addition of AgNPs. Hydrogels provide a relatively suitable environment and a porous 3D structure that facilitates wound healing [63]. In addition, silver loading confers high antibacterial properties to the hydrogels, which leads to the effective killing of bacteria and prevents wound infection [64]. Silver nanoparticles may also have anti-inflammatory effects that increase re-epithelialization rates [65]. The PVA/BC-Ag3 hydrogel had the highest antibacterial activity, the largest porosity, the largest pore size, and the highest wound healing rate. These results suggest that PVA/BC-Ag3 could be applied as a substitute biomaterial for skin wounds."
23,Histochemical staining,"3.10 Histochemical staining The healing tissues after days 5, 10, and 15 were stained by H&E to evaluate wound healing. All experimental groups showed an early inflammatory reaction after treatment for five days (Fig. 10 ). The inflammatory reaction in the control group and the PVA/BC group was more severe than in other groups. In the control group, there were many inflammatory and necrotic cells, parts of fibrin clots, vascular dilatations, and erythrocyte extravasations. This confirmed that hydrogels loaded with AgNPs can effectively reduce the wound inflammatory response [66]. Only a thin epidermis formed at the wound edge of the control group after 10 days. An incomplete serrated epidermis appeared on the wound surface in the PVA/BC group. In comparison with the PVA/BC group, the epidermis became thicker, and more glandular tissue and new blood vessels appeared. After 15 days, all experimental groups developed an intact epidermis, but the control group showed an uneven and relatively thin epidermis. For the PVA/BC-Ag1 and PVA/BC-Ag3 groups, more mature, flat, and thickened epidermis layers formed in addition to more glands and blood vessels. These results showed the PVA/BC-Ag hydrogel has a promising future in wound dressing. Neovascularization plays an important role in wound healing. Poor angiogenesis may lead to venous insufficiency, delay wound healing or form chronic wounds. In our study, we used CD31 immunohistochemically staining to observe and evaluate angiogenesis during wound healing [66]. As shown in Fig. 11 a, after 15 days of treatment, expression of CD31 in the PVA/BC-Ag3 hydrogel group was significantly higher than the other groups, which indicated more angiogenesis occurred in those wounds and differed significantly as compared to the control group (P<0.01). The PVA/BC-Ag3 hydrogel promoted wound healing by promoting angiogenesis and the formation of the hair follicle (Fig. 10). It is an ideal substitute material for artificial skin wounds."
24,Conclusions,"This study provided a new method for the preparation of nano silver bacterial cellulose wound dressings. The special preparation process and structural characteristics conferred high porosity, excellent mechanical properties, outstanding water absorption and retention capacity to the hydrogel. This ensured adherence to the wound surface adapted to various movements of the body, absorbed excess exudates, maintained a moist environment, and provided the best environmental conditions for wound healing. Antibacterial tests confirmed PVA/BC-Ag displayed significant antibacterial properties towards both gram-negative (E. coli) and gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria. Compared with PVA/BC hydrogels, PVA/BC-Ag hydrogels promoted the growth and development of new blood vessels and significantly accelerated wound healing with their combined antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. Taken together, this work provides a simple, effective, safe and environmentally friendly method for the design of nano-silver antibacterial hydrogels to promote the healing of infected wounds."
