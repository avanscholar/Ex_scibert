1,Engine,"1.1 Engine A naturally aspirated, direct injection compression ignition engine was used (Fig. 1 ). The engine cylinder pressure was continuously measured at every 0.2 crank angle degrees (CAD) using a piezoelectric transducer (Kistler 6056AU38) located in an engine glow plug adapter and connected to a charge amplifier (Kistler 5011). The cylinder gas pressure measured by the piezoelectric transducer required a reference absolute pressure and this was provided once per engine cycle at the bottom dead centre (induction stroke) by a piezoresistive pressure transducer (Druck PTX 7517-3257) located in the engine intake manifold 160mm upstream of the intake valve. A shaft encoder, having a resolution of 0.2 CAD, was used to trigger the data acquisition system (DAQ) by means of a reference signal at top dead centre (TDC). The DAQ also clocked the sampling of the cylinder gas pressure at every 0.2 CAD. One hundred consecutive engine cycles were recorded for subsequent heat release rate analysis. The experimental set-up for combustion studies is shown Fig. 1. Some of the investigated fuel molecules were only available in small quantities (<200ml) due to their high purchase cost. Therefore, an ultralow volume fuel system, which allows comprehensive testing with fuel samples as small as 120ml, was used (item labelled 1 in Fig. 1). The fuel system was originally designed by Schönborn et al. [18] and later modified by Hellier et al. [19]. Additionally, knowledge of the fuel flow rate consumed by the engine was required for analysis to allow the calculation of the fraction of premixed air–fuel mixture combusted. This required two separate fuel flow measurements; first, the high pressure fuel flow rate supplied to the fuel injector itself and secondly, the low pressure fuel spill flow rate from the fuel injector. The slip flow, comprising of about 45% of the fuel flow rate to the injector, was subtracted from the flow rate to the injector so as to give the net fuel rate injected into the engine combustion chamber. In order to measure the flow rate to the injector a flow measurement system was designed and implemented (labelled 2 in Fig. 1). At the beginning of an experiment, the sample fuel was transferred to the low volume fuel system by means of a funnel and the flow measurement system piston was pushed to the right with high pressure air, so as to allow the rod (labelled 3 in Fig. 1) attached to the piston of the flow measuring system to come into contact with the fuel system’s two pistons (labelled 4 in Fig. 1). This arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. During an experiment, common rail diesel fuel pressure pushed the fuel system pistons (labelled 4 in Fig. 1) to the left, thereby creating the necessary injection pressure for the fuel sample. These pistons (labelled 4 in Fig. 1) also pushed the flow measurement system piston (labelled 5 in Fig. 1) to the left and this movement was recorded by the ultrasonic proximity sensor (labelled 6 in Fig. 1), which allowed calculation of volumetric sample fuel flow rate to the injector. The injector spill was measured with a precision mass balance, so that the net flow rate of the fuel sample to the engine combustion chamber could be established."
2,Exhaust gas emissions analysis,"1.2 Exhaust gas emissions analysis The exhaust gas from combustion experiments was sampled unfiltered 180mm downstream of the exhaust valve and the gas sample was fed via heated lines (80°C) to two analysers. A MEXA 9100HEGR system was used to determine the concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), oxygen (O2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburned hydrocarbons. The exhaust particle size distribution as well as the total mass and number of particles per unit volume of exhaust gas were measured using a Cambustion DMS 500 differential mobility spectrometer. A particle density of 1.77g/cm3 was assumed [20]."
3,Experimental conditions,"1.3 Experimental conditions All the combustion experiments were conducted with a fixed injection timing of 7.5 CAD before top dead centre (TDC), engine speed of 1200rpm, 600bar injection pressure, and 4bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). Each test day was started and ended with a reference diesel fuel test, so as to detect any day to day drift in the experimental equipment and instrumentation. Additionally, the reference diesel fuel tests were used to generate a historic record of day to day variations in the results obtained with the same fuel and same experimental procedures. When considering the repeatability of emission measurements, the mean value for NO x was 918ppm, standard deviation of mean 28.6 and standard error of mean 7.2. The corresponding values for particulate matter mass were 0.0552μg/cc, 0.00716 and 0.00179; for the number of particulates 57.6∗106N/cc, 6.96∗106 and 1.74∗106. Most of the combustion experiments were conducted with the test fuels maintained at ambient conditions (305±3K). For the tests with fuel molecules which had melting points above this temperature, the fuel in the injection system and the supply pipes was heated to 343±3K. The test temperature for each fuel experiment can be seen in Table A1. To determine the effect on combustion and exhaust emissions of heating a fuel from 305K to 343K, three molecules were tested at both temperatures (undecane, 1-decanol and 1-undecanol). The 38K rise in temperature caused only a small decrease in ignition delay (0, 0.23, 0.06 CAD, respectively). By comparison, the day-to-day standard deviation of ignition delay with reference diesel fuel was found to be 0.1 CAD. Therefore, the changes in ignition delay caused by varying the fuel temperature by 38K were deemed to be of low significance. Nevertheless, differences in fuel temperatures are noted in the results section for information, where applicable."
4,Data analysis,"1.4 Data analysis The key indicators used in this study to evaluate combustion development were the ignition delay and the amount of fuel burned during the premixed combustion phase. In addition the gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions were used in the evaluation of the performance of each fuel. Ignition delay was defined as the time between the start of injection and the start of combustion; the start of combustion was calculated from the in-cylinder gas pressure data as being the timing of the initial minimum cumulative heat release rate value. The start of injection was deemed to be the start of the electronic signal to the engine injector, which is known from previous studies to occur before the appearance of fuel spray from the injector nozzle by approximately 257μs (2 CAD). The start and end of the premixed combustion phase were determined from the heat release rate record. The amount of energy released during the premixed phase was calculated by integrating the heat release rate between the start and the end of the premixed combustion phase. The percentage of the total energy released during premixed combustion was calculated using the measured fuel flow rate supplied to the engine and the fuel lower heating value."
5,Fuel molecules investigated,1.5 Fuel molecules investigated Seventeen alcohols and nine hydrocarbons of various chain lengths from C8 to C16 were studied experimentally. The molecular structures of these fuel molecules are shown in Table 1 and the physical properties of the fuel molecules investigated are listed in Table A1 [21–25]. The purpose of the experiments was to investigate the effects of the following molecular structural features on combustion and exhaust emissions: (a) Adding a hydroxyl group to an alkane. (b) Position of a hydroxyl group within the fuel molecule. (c) Degree of unsaturation in alcohol molecule. (d) Degree of branching in alcohol molecule.
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of fuel molecular structure on ignition delay,"2.1 Effect of fuel molecular structure on ignition delay 2.1.1 Effect of the carbon chain length Fig. 2 a shows the ignition delay for primary and secondary alcohols and for comparison the delays for alkanes and the reference diesel fuel. The figure shows that ignition delay became lower with increasing carbon chain length for both the hydrocarbons and the alcohols. It is suggested that this increase in ignition delay occurs due to the changes in the rate of hydrogen abstraction and the ability of the fuel molecule to isomerize. According to Westbrook [17] compression ignition in engines in the temperature range of 850K to 1200K occurs principally through the H 2 O 2-mechanism This mechanism involves the production of two hydroxyl radicals (OH) for each hydrogen radical consumed, and it therefore leads to a rapid increase in the radical pool. The availability of hydrogen radicals, through abstraction from the fuel molecule, is therefore of key importance to the H 2 O 2-mechanism. In general, hydrogen abstraction from hydrocarbon chain occurs, firstly, from the weakest C-H bonds. In the case of alkanes H-abstraction is easiest from the tertiary carbon atoms, followed by the secondary and the primary carbon atoms [16].One could, therefore, expect that as the chain length increases and, consequently, the number of secondary carbon atoms increases, the ease of H-abstraction from the longer chain molecule would generally increase. It is suggested that this is reflected in the progressive shortening of ignition delay with longer chain molecules shown in Fig. 2a. The fuel radical that remains after H-abstraction is oxidized and then undergoes isomerization, leading to branching reactions which enhance radical pool formation further. Isomerization occurs through transition rings, with six-membered transition rings being a preferred state [16,17]. As the fuel molecule chain length increases, the propensity of the molecule to form six-membered transition rings and to isomerize increases. It is therefore suggested that this improved propensity to isomerize results in further shortening of the ignition delay for longer molecules, seen in Fig. 2a. 2.1.2 Effect of the hydroxyl group Primary alcohols (R-CH2-OH) are observed from Fig. 2a to have higher ignition delays than corresponding alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms. One way to explain the greater resistance of primary alcohols to ignition, compared to that of the corresponding alkane, is to consider a primary alcohol as an alkane with the primary hydrogen atom substituted by a hydroxyl group. This is illustrated for Octane and 1-Octanol in Fig. 3 . As it will become apparent from the following discussion, the introduction of the hydroxyl group at the end of the molecule has significant knock-on effects on the adjacent carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds, weakening some of them and strengthening some others. Consider, first, the bonding strength between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl group. Referring to Fig. 3, the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group (labelled x in 1-Octanol) is more difficult to abstract than the corresponding hydrogen atom in the alkane molecule (labelled y in Octane). As a result, the hydrogen radical pool associated with compression-ignition of the alcohol becomes somewhat smaller than that of the corresponding alkane, and the compression-ignition delay can be expected to increase somewhat [1]. Next, consider the carbon chain and the abstraction of the six hydrogen atoms labelled z in 1-Ocatanol (Fig. 3). The presence of the OH group (rather that the corresponding y H-atom in Octane Fig. 3), makes the abstraction of these six hydrogen atoms more difficult that the abstraction of the corresponding hydrogen atoms in the alkane molecule; this resistance to hydrogen abstraction is related to the progressive weakening of the C-C bonds of the 3 carbon atoms adjacent to the carbon onto which the OH group is bonded. As a result, one would expect the ignition delay to, again, increase somewhat. Lastly, the introduction of the OH group has one converse effect in lowering the compression-ignition delay, by weakening the two H-C bonds of the primary carbon atom (labelled a in 1-Octanol Fig. 3). The changes in H-C bond strengths described above were demonstrated by Heufer et al. [4] using shock tube and RCM experiments conducted with n-pentanol and n-hexanol. Additionally, this order of the H-C bond strengths was supported by the experimental study of 1-hexanol combustion in an opposed-flow diffusion flame conducted by Yeung and Thomson [26]. As mentioned previously, the ease or otherwise of hydrogen abstraction controls the magnitude of the hydrogen radical pool and, thereby, affects the period of the compression-ignition delay. There is also another way in which the presence of the hydroxyl group affects ignition delay. That is the ability of a fuel radical to initiate the further branching reactions through isomerization. It has been demonstrated [27,28] that the reaction between an α-hydroxyalkyl radical (R⋅-CHOH) (formed through hydrogen abstraction from alpha carbon atom) with oxygen may produce an aldehyde (R-CHO) and an HO 2 radical. Hence, the oxidation of an α-hydroxyalkyl radical appears to lead mainly to chain propagation reactions, instead of chain branching reactions through isomerization, as is the case with alkanes. This suppresses the low temperature reactivity of primary alcohols and lengthens their ignition delay further, in comparison to alkanes. 2.1.3 Position of the hydroxyl group Fig. 2a shows that the secondary alcohols (R-CHOH-CH3) have slightly longer ignition delays than the primary alcohols. It should be noted that these secondary alcohols have the hydroxyl group bonded to the second carbon atom of the carbon chain. The longer delays of secondary alcohols are believed to be partly due to the substitution of a secondary hydrogen atom by the hydroxyl group. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 for 1-Octanol and 2-Octanol. Based on the results of Heufer et al. [4] and Yeung and Thomson [26], the hydroxyl group can be expected to: weaken the C-H bond for the alpha carbon atom (labelled c in 2-Octanol Fig. 3); strengthen the C-H bonds for the adjacent primary carbon atoms (labelled b in 2-Octanol Fig. 3); and strengthen the C-H bond for the three neighbouring secondary carbon atoms, making their hydrogen atoms more difficult to abstract (labelled p in 2-Octanol Fig. 3). Therefore, taken together, the effect of the OH group is to make the overall H-abstraction from secondary alcohols more difficult than from primary alcohols and reduces the rate of radical pool formation. As a result of the smaller pool of hydrogen radicals available for further reactions the duration of ignition delay for secondary alcohols is longer in comparison to that for primary alcohols. Next, consider the ability of a secondary alcohol radical, which is formed in the H-abstraction, to initiate further branching reactions through isomerization. According to Sarathy et al. [27], oxidation of a secondary alcohol radical after H abstraction from the alpha carbon atom usually produces a methyl ketone and an HO 2 radical. This leads to lower reactivity of the secondary alcohols compared to that of alkanes. However, no comprehensive comparison between the duration of further reactions of the methyl ketone and an aldehyde, which is formed during the oxidation of a corresponding primary alcohol radical, was available in the literature. Therefore, it remains unclear whether changes in the ability of a fuel molecule to isomerise contributed to the change in ignition delay observed between secondary and primary alcohols in Fig. 2a. The effect of moving a hydroxyl group further along the carbon chain of alcohols beyond the first and second carbon atoms of the chain was investigated with molecules of three different chain lengths. Fig. 2b shows the effect of moving a hydroxyl group along the carbon chain of an Octanol from the first carbon atom in the chain to the second and then to the third carbon atom. Similarly, a hydroxyl group was moved from the first carbon of a Nonanol to the second and to the fifth carbon; and, in the case of Undecane, from the first carbon to the second carbon. It was observed that moving the hydroxyl group towards the centre of the carbon chain increased the ignition delay, as can be seen from Fig. 2b. It is suggested that this greater resistance to ignition is due to reduced length of the un-substituted carbon chains on either side of the hydroxyl group. These shorter carbon chains have a higher number of secondary carbons that are affected by the hydroxyl group, which will result in slower overall H-abstraction and thus in longer ignition delay. Additionally, the ability of a fuel molecule to form six-membered transition rings and go through isomerization reactions, decreases with the reducing length of the un-substituted carbon chains. 2.1.4 Degree of unsaturation To assess the effect on ignition delay of unsaturation in an alcohol both saturated and unsaturated C8, C10 and C11 alcohols were tested. For comparison, two alkenes, namely 1-Octene and 1-Decene were tested and their ignition delays compared to those of the corresponding saturated hydrocarbons, namely Octane and Decane. The alkenes were observed from Fig. 4 a to have longer ignition delays than the alkanes of same carbon chain length. This result is supported by several previous studies, for example those of Vanhove et al. [29] and Mehl et al. [30]. One way to explain the increase in ignition delay caused by the addition of a double bond is to consider the changes in the C-H bond strengths of the neighbouring carbon atoms. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 for Octane and 1-Octene. A double bond affects the C-H bond strengths of both the three vinylic (labelled v in 1-Octene Fig. 3) and the two allylic carbon atoms (labelled al in 1-Octene Fig. 3). The vinylic C-H bonds are stronger than the corresponding C-H bonds of an alkane, which makes the H-abstraction from these sites more difficult and, thereby, increases the ignition delay of alkenes compared to alkanes. In the case of allylic C-H bonds the C-H bonds are weaker than the corresponding C-H bonds of an alkane and hence the H-abstraction is less difficult than from the corresponding carbon atom of an alkane. This makes the allylic C-H bond the favoured site for H-abstraction from alkenes. Superficially this may appear to make compression ignition easier and shorten the ignition delay. However, the chemistry is complicated by the oxidation of hydrocarbon radicals left after the abstraction of the allylic hydrogen atoms. The oxidation reactions results in intermediate alkylperoxy radicals with weak C-O2 bonds. Due to the weak C-O2 bonds, the alkylperoxy radicals dissociate easily back to hydrocarbon radicals and molecular oxygen, instead of initiating the isomerization reaction sequence that leads to further branching reactions in the case of alkane radicals. Therefore, the dissociation of the alkylperoxy radicals decreases the formation rate of the radical pool significantly, during alkene compression-ignition, compared to compression ignition of the corresponding alkane. Hence the relatively easy H-abstraction from an allylic site does not decrease the ignition delay of an alkene compared to an alkane, but rather increases it somewhat. These changes in C-H bond strengths of an alkene have been observed for example through kinetic modelling by Westbrook et al. [31]. The effect of unsaturation in alcohols on ignition delay was investigated though comparison of the following pairs: 3-Octanol and 1-Octen-3-ol and 1-undecanol and 10-Undecen-1-ol, as shown in Fig. 4b. Adding one double bond to the alcohol structure increased the ignition delay for the C8 alcohol, as was expected based on the previous comparisons between C8 and C10 hydrocarbons. Fig. 4b shows that the increase in the alcohol chain length from C8 to C11 reduces the ignition delay substantially, from about 8 CAD to approximately 5 CAD. Fig. 4b also shows that adding a double bond to the undecanol alcohol had no effect on ignition delay. It is therefore possible that the longer chain length of the C11 alcohol compared to that for the C8 alcohol eliminates any additional impact that the addition of a double bond might have on ignition delay. The effect of potential interaction between the hydroxyl group and a double bond was investigated further by comparing the ignition delays of several C8 and C10 molecules. This was carried out by comparing Octane with 1-Octene and 1-Octanol; and by a similar comparison of the corresponding C10 molecules in Fig. 4a. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that adding a double bond to the primary carbon atom of Octane to form 1-Octene increases the ignition delay less than the addition of a hydroxyl group to form 1-Octanol. This result is also confirmed in Fig. 4a in the case of Decane, where the addition of a double bond to the first carbon atom of Decane increases the ignition delay less than the addition of a hydroxyl group. Interestingly, adding a hydroxyl group to the first carbon atom of 3-Octanol to form a 1-Octen-3-ol results in a significantly higher ignition delay than for any of the other molecule configurations. Similarly high ignition delay is observed for 1-Decen-3-ol. Taken together, these results suggest that the two structural features, degree of unsaturation and a hydroxyl group, when combined tend to increase the ignition delay of a fuel molecule very substantially. 2.1.5 Degree of branching Fig. 4c shows that the addition of two methyl branches to 1-Octanol to form 3,7-Dimethyl-1-octanol increases the ignition delay. This result was expected based on several previous studies regarding alkane branching, such as those of Silke et al. [32] and Ribaucour et al. [33] with RCMs. The longer ignition delays of branched molecules can be explained by the stabilizing effect of branching due to greater electron delocalisation, as was shown among others by the calculations of Kemnitz et al. [34]. The greater stability of the fuel molecule results in slower H-abstraction in addition to the smaller number of secondary hydrogen atoms available for abstraction in branched molecule compared to straight chain molecules. Additionally, according to Ribaucour et al. [33], branching inhibits isomerization by reducing the number of sites available for transition ring formation. Both of these changes in low temperature combustion kinetics will result in slower formation of a radical pool large enough to sustain ignition and, therefore, increase the ignition delay of branched molecules compared to that of the straight chain molecules with same carbon chain length. Returning to Fig. 4c, the figure does not show the same trend of increased ignition delay when two branches are added to 3-Octanol to form 3,7-Dimethyl-3-octanol. Instead, Fig. 4c shows a decrease in ignition delay which can be explained by a two-stage pattern of ignition of 3,7-Dimethyl-3-octanol. Although the first ignition occurred early at 7.70 CAD, the second, main ignition occurred later, resulting in a significant increase in ignition delay to about 13.5 CAD, which falls into line of a trend of branching increasing the ignition delay. The rather long ignition delay of 13.5 CAD, corresponding to the second main ignition, is believed to arise because the hydroxyl group in 3,7-Dimethyl-3-octanol is bonded to the same carbon atom as the methyl group. As a result, there is one less secondary hydrogen atom available for H-abstraction compared to 3,7-Dimethyl-1-octanol, reducing the hydrogen radical pool and thus delaying the main ignition. Furthermore, a hydroxyl group in the middle of the carbon chain is likely to hinder the isomerization reactions more than when the hydroxyl group is bonded to the end of the carbon chain. These two effects are expected to have hindered the growth of the radical pool, causing the ignition delay to increase."
8,Effect of fuel molecular structure on heat release rate,"2.2 Effect of fuel molecular structure on heat release rate The rate at which energy is released during combustion can have a significant effect on engine performance, affecting such aspects as thermal efficiency and formation of pollutant emissions [35]. The three key parameters of heat release are as follows: the fraction of the total energy released during the premixed combustion phase; the peak value of the heat release rate (pHRR); and the timing of the pHRR. Fig. 5 shows the effect of ignition delay on these three parameters for all of the investigated molecules, excluding 3,7-Dimethyl-3-octanol and 1-Octen-3-ol. These two molecules were excluded due to their unusually long ignition delays and double-ignition. Fig. 5a shows that the ignition delay has a strong positive correlation with the fraction of the fuel burnt in the premixed phase, as one would expect, since longer delays result in a greater amount of premixed fuel–air mixture, which combusts rapidly after ignition. With the experiments conducted with fixed injection timing of 7.5 CAD and ignition delays changing from about 4 to 8 CAD, much of the rapid premixed phase combustion takes place close to TDC, in near constant-volume conditions. It is therefore not surprising that Fig. 5b shows that longer ignition delay, and therefore greater amounts of rapidly combusted premixed mixture, resulted in higher peak heat release rates. The moderate slope of this peak HRR curve for ignition delays longer than 7 CAD is probably due to the peak HRR occurring further away from TDC (as shown in Fig. 5c), during the expansion stroke and increasing in-cylinder volume."
9,Effect of fuel molecular structure on exhaust gas emissions,"2.3 Effect of fuel molecular structure on exhaust gas emissions 2.3.1 Nitrogen oxides NO x emissions form mainly according to the Zeldovich mechanism, which is exponentially highly dependent on in-cylinder temperature and less so on the availability of oxygen [36]. In general, higher in-cylinder temperatures and higher availability of oxygen increase the formation rate of NO x emissions. Longer ignition delays are observed from Fig. 6 a to result in higher average in-cylinder temperatures, for the reasons discussed in the previous section. It is therefore somewhat surprising that the generally positive correlation between the NO x emissions and the maximum average in-cylinder temperature of Fig. 6b shows a significant amount of scatter when all of the investigated molecules are considered together. However, when molecules were split into subgroups based on their molecular structure strong positive correlations were observed for hydrocarbons, primary alcohols and secondary alcohols. When all the data was considered together, considerable scatter was also observed for the correlation between NO x emissions and ignition delay (Fig. 6c), as well as between NO x emissions and premixed phase (Fig. 6d) for all molecules; whereas strong correlations were observed within the subgroups from both of these figures. The strong correlations when subgroups shown in Fig. 6 are considered, suggest that the molecular fuel structure has a significant effect on NO x emissions through other factors than the maximum average in-cylinder temperature and ignition delay. A similar observation could also be made from Fig. 7 a, which shows no conclusive correlations between NO x and adiabatic flame temperatures for the tested molecules. However, if the data point for Octane with an unexpectedly high NO x value (847ppm) was excluded from Fig. 7a, a weak positive correlation (R-square of 0.24) would be observed for the alkane molecules. A weak positive correlation (R-square of 0.33) was also observed for the tested alcohols (Fig. 7a). (The adiabatic flame temperatures were calculated for a stoichiometric mixture at constant pressure assuming no dissociation [37]). Following on from the somewhat unexpected weak correlations between NO x and maximum average in-cylinder temperature and adiabatic flame temperature when all molecules were considered together and the strong correlations within subgroups, further analysis of the data was carried out. Fig. 7b shows a tendency for NO x to decrease with increasing carbon chain length, and thus with decreasing ignition delay, for molecules with chain lengths shorter than 11 carbon atoms. For molecules with 12 or more carbon atoms the NO x concentration is seen in Fig. 7b to stay the same. The combustion experiments for molecules with carbon chain length of more than 12 carbon atoms were conducted under heated conditions in order to ensure that they remained in liquid phase and flowed freely. Therefore, it is possible that any tendency towards lower NO x due to increasing chain length may have been offset by somewhat increased NO x due to the increased fuel temperature. Fig. 7b also shows that primary and secondary alcohols had higher NO x emissions than alkanes. This result is contradictory with several previous studies, which have shown that an increased ethanol or butanol percentage in alcohol–diesel blends resulted in lower in-cylinder temperatures and lower NO x emissions, ascribed by various investigations to the higher heat of vapourization of alcohols [11,38–40]. The higher NO x emissions of alcohols compared to those of alkanes shown in Fig. 7b could perhaps be explained by the higher in-cylinder temperatures of alcohols compared to those for the alkanes having the same carbon chain length. The shorter ignition delays of alkanes compared to those for the alcohols (Fig. 2) resulted in combustion for alkanes starting a few CAD before TDC. In the case if the alcohols, their longer ignition delays resulted in ignition and premixed combustion occurring closer to TDC, causing somewhat higher combustion temperatures. The enhanced supply by the alcohols of oxygen molecules into the combustion zone might have also raised NO x . The location of a hydroxyl functional group within an alcohol molecule was observed to affect NO x exhaust emissions. Fig. 8 a shows that NO x emissions were reduced when moving the hydroxyl group along the carbon chain towards the centre of molecule. In the case of Undecanol, which had the shortest ignition delay, it is suggested that the slight NO x reduction was due to the decrease in maximum average in-cylinder temperature (Fig. 8b) and possibly lower adiabatic flame temperatures (Fig. 8c). In the case of Octanol and Nonanol there is less clarity as to the reason why the NO x decreased when the hydroxyl group was located progressively towards the middle of the molecule (Fig. 8a). There is a strong suggestion in Fig. 8c that this was due to reduced adiabatic flame temperature. However, the experimental values of maximum average in-cylinder temperature show increasing average temperature (Fig. 8b), while NO x emission was reducing (Fig. 8a). A possible but rather tentative explanation for the decrease in NO x for Octanol and Nonanol, despite rising average in-cylinder temperature, is the following. Fig. 2b shows that for 2- and 3-Octanol the ignition delay rose by 1 CAD to 8 CAD after TDC (ATDC) and for 5-Nonanol by about 2.5 CAD to 8.5 CAD ATDC. For these molecules, therefore, ignition occurred after TDC, when the in-cylinder air and turbulence levels would have been rising, due to interacting swirl and reverse squish [35], as the piston started to recede away from the cylinder head. It is therefore possible that flame quenching locally due to cooler air entrainment, resulted in NO x reduction, despite the rising in-cylinder global average in-cylinder temperature. Fig. 9 a shows that higher degree of molecule unsaturation resulted in higher NO x levels for 10-Undecen-1-ol compared to 1-Undecanol. This could possibly be explained by the higher values of both adiabatic flame temperature (Fig. 9b) and maximum in-cylinder temperature (Fig. 9c) of 10-Undecen-1-ol. Considering 1-Octen-3-ol, Fig. 9a shows that introducing a single double bond to the 3-Octanol to form 1-Octen-3-ol reduced the NO x level to almost zero. Fig. 9c shows that this reduction in NO x could perhaps be explained by a very large reduction in the average in-cylinder temperature, from about 1600K to about 1475K. In turn, the large reduction in average temperature was the result of very late main ignition (4 CAD ATDC, as shown in Fig. 4b) and slow combustion taking place during the engine expansion stroke. Fig. 10 a shows that adding two methyl group branches to 1-Octanol to form 3,7-Dimethyl-1-octanol slightly decreases the NO x emissions despite the increase in maximum average in-cylinder temperature (Fig. 10b). The increase in maximum average in-cylinder temperature was caused by the longer ignition delay and the larger premixed combustion phase. It is possible, that the decrease in adiabatic flame temperature (Fig. 10c) may have had an impact in regarding the NO x emissions. The significant decrease in NO x emissions when comparing 3-Octanol and 3,7-Dimethyl-3-octanol (Fig. 10a) is very likely to have been due to the late ignition of 3,7-Dimethyl-3-octanol. The late ignition resulted in a low maximum in-cylinder temperature (Fig. 10b) which, combined with lower adiabatic flame temperature (Fig. 10c), could have caused the reduced NO x emission. 2.3.2 Particulate matter Particulate matter emissions are formed in locally fuel-rich regions in the combustion chamber and comprise mainly of agglomerated solid carbonaceous material and organic compounds. Larger particulates are formed when small nucleus particles (diameter 0–50nm) combine together to form accumulation particles (diameter 50–1000nm), which in turn may form larger agglomerates [41]. Three main factors controlling particulate matter formation are the local fuel/air stoichiometry, percentage of fuel that burns during the premixed combustion phase, and the in-cylinder temperature. All three factors, in turn, are significantly affected by the ignition delay: longer ignition delay allows the formation of a leaner and larger premixed fraction, which leads to a larger fraction of the fuel being burned instantaneously close to TDC, resulting in increased in-cylinder temperature. Higher premixed fraction combusted at high temperature generally leads to formation of fewer and smaller particulates, due to fewer fuel-rich pockets and limited time available for soot formation and growth (Fig. 11 a). Conversely, smaller premixed phase will increase diffusion burning which is slower, exposes rich mixture regions to high temperature and provides more time for particle agglomeration and growth, leading to smaller number of larger particles. Higher in-cylinder temperature generally leads to formation of fewer particulates due to accelerated oxidation, but can also lead to higher formation rate of particulates in the rich core of the spray (Fig. 11b) by speeding up pyrolysis and soot formation reactions in this oxygen-deficient region. Put together, these factors generally appear to lead to smaller and more numerous particles when ignition delay is longer and, hence, the premixed combustion fraction is greater (Fig. 11). In this study, the non-oxygen bearing hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes), were observed from Fig. 12 a to produce a greater mass concentration of particulates than the alcohols. This result was also observed by several other investigations, e.g. Xue et al. [42] and Wei et al. [12], who have reported reduced particulate emissions with alcohol fuels compared to hydrocarbon fuels. However, despite the lower overall mass concentration of particulates, Fig. 12b indicates that the alcohols produce, in general, more but smaller particles than the hydrocarbons. Possible reasons for the smaller particulates of alcohols are their longer ignition delays and greater premixed fractions compared to hydrocarbons. Fig. 13 a shows that moving a hydroxyl group towards the centre of the molecule resulted in a very strong tendency for the number of nucleation particles to increase. It is possible to ascribe this increase in the number of nucleation particles to the longer ignition delays and to a greater fraction of the fuels burnt in the premixed combustion mode. Fig. 13b shows that adding a double bond to the C8 alcohols caused increased mass and number of particulates. In the case of 1-octen-3-ol, two-stage ignition was observed with a small premixed phase and a prolonged diffusion combustion phase, which could have increased both the number and size of the particulates. In the case of 10-undecen-1-ol, no significant change in the mass of particulates was observed although there was a small rise in particulate number density. A possible explanation for the smaller rise in particulate concentration with the C11 alcohols, in comparison with the results for C8 alcohols, would be the significantly longer chain length of the C11 alcohol: due to the longer chain length, the relative increase in ignition delay with the increasing degree of unsaturation was smaller for the C11 alcohol than for the C8 alcohol. Increased methyl group branching is shown in Fig. 13c to have led to lower number concentration of particulates. It is possible that this is due to abnormally late combustion and partial burning taking place at low temperatures. The lower combustion temperature reduced the rate of the time-consuming processes required for soot formation."
10,Conclusions,"The hydroxyl group in a wide variety of alcohol molecules was observed to have a significant effect on compression ignition delay and exhaust emissions. The key results were as follows: 1. Compared to alkanes, alcohols had longer ignition delays, which lead to larger premixed phases and higher maximum average in-cylinder temperatures. Higher in-cylinder temperatures tended to increase the NO x emissions; larger premixed phases resulted in lower mass of particulate emissions and higher particle number emissions for alcohols compared to alkanes. 2. Moving a hydroxyl group towards the centre of the alcohol carbon chain resulted in longer ignition delays. NO x emissions decreased with increasing ignition delay, despite the increasing maximum average in-cylinder temperatures. This reduction in NO x emissions was suggested to be caused by both the decrease in adiabatic flame temperatures and the later combustion. Although the maximum average in-cylinder temperature increased with increasing ignition delay, the later combustion was assumed to result in a shorter overall time during which the in-cylinder temperature remained high, partly due to the possible flame quenching. The shorter duration of high in-cylinder temperature lead to formation of less NO x . Longer ignition delays resulted in formation of greater number of small nucleation particulates, as was expected due to the larger premixed phases. 3. Higher degree of unsaturation led to longer ignition delays. NO x emissions increased due to increases in both the maximum average in-cylinder temperatures and the adiabatic flame temperatures. As expected, the number of small nucleation particulate emissions was observed to increase with increasing ignition delay. 4. Higher degree of branching in alcohols increased the ignition delay. NO x emissions decreased slightly despite the increase in both premixed phase and the maximum average in-cylinder temperature, perhaps partly due to decrease in adiabatic flame temperature. The number of particulate matter particles increased slightly with increasing ignition delay. It is suggested that the observed increase in ignition delay for alcohols compared to the delay for alkanes was mainly due to the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom present in alcohols, compared to that of carbon and hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbon molecules. This higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom makes the overall hydrogen abstraction more difficult and decreases the ability of fuel molecules to initiate further branching reactions through isomerization. The differences in NO x emissions were suggested to be caused mainly by the changes in the rate of rapid thermal NO x formation. When considering the particulate matter emissions, the number of particles in the exhaust gas was observed to decrease with increasing magnitude of premixed phase, and the mass of particulates to increase with increasing in-cylinder temperature. It can be concluded that, both adding a hydroxyl group and moving it along the carbon chain of a hydrocarbon fuel molecule can be used to alter the combustion profile and the exhaust gas emissions of a fuel. It should also be noted that a slight trade-off between the NO x emissions and particulate matter emissions was observed with the hydroxyl group addition to a hydrocarbon; the NO x emissions generally increased, whereas the particulate matter emissions decreased."
