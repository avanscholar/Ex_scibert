0,Introduction,"In recent years, new alternatives for the controlled administration of active substances have been discovered that promise to increase the effectiveness of the active substance. Nano-systems promise a specific and controlled means of delivery; however it is necessary to improve design and performance, in terms of the charge/vehicle ratio limits for the release of high doses of drugs [1]. Transdermal patches (TPs) can hold higher drug doses than nanosystems [2] and this delivery system is more efficient, while also ensuring host stability [3]. These patches employ a dermal system to diffuse an active substance through the dermis. TPs have also been developed in order to supply drugs to treat and control diseases such as pain and Alzheimer's [4,5]. The absorption of active substances from TPs is independent of food intake and the effectiveness of the drug increases because interaction with other substances in the gastrointestinal tract is reduced [6]. Sustained release of the active substance is the most important advantage of TPs, as a constant plasma concentration of the drug within the therapeutic ranges is ensured, whereas oral administration usually results in fluctuations in plasma concentration [7,8]. Based on these properties, we propose that TPs can also be used for the release of energy supplements. Electrospinning to obtain polymeric fibers offers flexibility for the control of composition, fiber diameter, large surface area, porosity, and can also be aligned or misaligned. Thus the appropriate combination of these characteristics ensures the implementation of a pharmacological system, capable of releasing an active principle, in a controlled and specific way. A wide range of bio-polymers have been employed in electrospinning; the Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is notable for its excellent biomedical applications (embolic agent) and because it can easily be processed using this technique [9,10]. The electrospun polymer PVA comprises a good alternative for the design of nanomaterials, as it exhibits water solubility, very good cell compatibility, and low cytotoxicity [11,12]. It is also biodegradable when in contact with sweat produced during hard workouts, causing the sports supplement to be released. The main challenge of the integration of CM in PVA nanofibers is to encapsulate multidose and release it in a controlled and specific way. CM is a supplement that increases strength and improves physical endurance [13]. It is a mixture of the non-essential amino acid (l-Citrulline) and a carboxylic acid (Malate) [14], meaning that it interacts during the Krebs cycle and increases energy production. CM is a metabolite of the urea cycle that neutralizes muscle pain during exercise by reducing the amount of lactate, ammonium and acidosis, generated during anaerobic movements, while also improving muscle function [13,15]. [14] demonstrated that frequent CM consumption increases physical recovery by up to 98% after intense training. Exercise supplements are typically consumed orally, a procedure that requires up to 2 h for them to metabolize and for effects to be felt [16]. Therefore, we consider that CM in TPs is a viable alternative for administering exercise supplements by means of transdermal release and may be more effective and efficient for delivering the supplement under real conditions of sports practice; thus our main aim in this work is to characterize its properties. Currently, theoretical computational methods are being applied to the study of a wide variety of compounds [17–23] in order to design drugs and predict electronic and geometric properties, as well as molecular reactivity and molecular interactions in several materials. This is the theme of the present study."
1,Methodology,"Initially, an aqueous solution containing 10, 12 and 14% (w/v) of polyvinyl alcohol (weight-average molecular weight 89,000; 99% hydrolyzed) was prepared. The polymeric solution was emptied into a plastic syringe (BD®, 5 mL, 12.46 mm in diameter) and placed in the electrospinning device. We applied a voltage of 20 ± 1 kV, at a release rate of 3.6 mL/h and a working distance of 12 cm between the needle and the conductive cooper collector in order to produce the transdermal patches (TPs). The PVA-CM fibers were produced under the same conditions as the PVA reference and 10, 14, and 20% (w/v) of Malate Citrulline (1:1; Primaforce®) and then mixed with PVA before electrospinning the fibers. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the formation of PVA nanofibers and PVA with CM. Likewise, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to elucidate the mechanism of molecular interaction between the supplement and polymer. Polymer degradation was quantified with reference to PVA-CM weight loss in a physiological fluid. For this purpose, the polymer was weighed after drying at room temperature for at least 20 h. For delivery tests, a sample of PVA-CM, 0.5 cm in diameter, was placed in water (pH 7.2) at 37 °C, using a dialysis cellulose membrane. Aliquots of the solution were taken to measure the absorption at 229 nm every 15 min in an UV–Vis spectrophotometer. CM delivery concentration was calculated based on a calibration curve. The Korsmeyer-Peppas [24] mechanism was used in order to determine the kinetics of supplement release, as expressed in equation (1). This is a logarithmic relationship that computes the fraction of drug released vs. logarithm of time, in order to calculate the release exponent ( n ). (1) F = M t M ∞ = K t n F is the fraction of drug released at time t, M t is the amount of drug released at time t, M ∞ is the total amount of drug in dosage form, K is the kinetic constant, t is the time and n is the diffusion of release exponent. Firstly, a semi-empirical conformational analysis was performed using Spartan 02 for the theoretical simulations [25]. The most stable conformers were optimized by using Gaussian 09 density functional theory (DFT) [26], with Becke's three-parameter exchange and functional correlation, LeeYang-Parr hybrid (B3LYP) [27–29] and the 6–311 ++G (d, p) base set that includes divided and diffuse border functions. [27,30–32] [51–53]. Interaction energies from the hydrogen bond in the materials studied were calculated by subtracting the energy of the isolated molecules from the total energy complex. Furthermore, the respective vibrational frequencies were calculated, using the DFT (B3LYP/6–311++G (d,p) for all structures, except for the interaction of Citrulline Malate with PVA (for which the base set 6-311 + G (d,p) was used). Previous reports of the infrared spectra, obtained using DFT calculations, provided excellent vibrational bands for organic compounds and these results were used to eliminate uncertainties in the fundamental assignments, in experimental infrared spectra [33–35]. We assessed molecular interaction stability in terms of frontier orbitals and calculated their energy and molecular electrostatic maps. The highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap was presented as a parameter used to describe molecular stability [36]; R [17]. Based on this method, values for orbital energy and the surface of frontier orbitals were also calculated. Molecular electrostatic potential maps (MEPs) were obtained for the target molecules, in order to complete electronic analyses, because of the importance of these results in terms of the biological system studied [37,38]. Free energies and equilibrium constant for molecules and interactions were calculated from thermochemical analyses of the system, assuming 298 K, 1 atm of pressure and the principal isotope for each element [39,40] obtained from the frequency results of the same theory. The zero point correction to the electronic energy (ZPE) was used to calculate the values of enthalpy and Gibbs free energy [41,42]; meanwhile equilibrium constants were calculated using the equation; [43–45]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,PVA films,"3.1 PVA films The electrospun PVA film had an average thickness of 0.15 ± 0.01 nm and a diameter of 3.5 ± 0.2 cm (Fig. 1 e) Film morphology consisted of random uniform fibers of nanometric size, whose shape and number depended on PVA concentration. The structure manifested joints and crosses between fibers, resulting in a highly porous membrane (Fig. 1a–c). Fiber diameter increased linearly between 150 and 183 nm, together with an increase in concentration of PVA, as shown in Fig. 1d. The beam becomes unstable as PVA concentration increases, creating more defects."
4,PVA with citrulline malate films,"3.2 PVA with citrulline malate films By adding Citrulline (C) to the 10% (w/v) PVA precursor solution, the electrospun fibers developed uniform morphology and a smooth surface, with an average diameter of 311 ± 30 nm (Fig. 2 a). Likewise, fibers with 10% (w/v) Malate (M) resulted in irregular morphology, where protruding beads and agglomerations did not permit the development of defect free nanofibers. It can thus be assumed that the defects were due to the presence of Malate, which modified tension at the solution surface, making it more sensitive to the applied voltage. Thus, the polymer jet was discontinuous, resulting in the formation of drops and short fibers as shown in Fig. 2b [46,47]. The addition of Citrulline Malate (CM) to the PVA fibers did alter film morphology, depending on concentration and applied voltage. After addition of 10 and 14% (w/v) of CM, uniform smooth surface fibers were obtained (Fig. 3 A and B), with an average fiber diameter of 262 nm and 287 nm for 10% (w/v) and 14% (w/v) of CM. Fibers with 20% (w/v) of CM (Fig. 3c) had an average diameter of 323 nm. These developed a web-like morphology due to the increase in CM concentration. Interactive molecular forces also increased, reducing mutual repulsion, so that the emerging jet increased in diameter. The increase in viscosity caused beam instability, as the initial flexion began at a greater distance, rather than at the mouthpiece. Therefore, beam trajectory decreased and solvent evaporation (water) and beam elongation were affected, resulting in a different morphology [46]. By Increasing the voltage to 30 KV, “bead defects” resulted (Fig. 3d), due to beam destabilization during the electrospinning process [48,49]. Fiber diameter increased linearly with CM, from 168 nm to 396 nm (Fig. 3e). The increase in diameter was an indication of CM integration within the polymeric fibers [46,47]. The morphology became denser and web-like, as apparent in the SEM images of fibers obtained with a precursor solution of 12% (w/v) PVA in Fig. 4 . In the X-ray diffraction pattern of PVA (Fig. 5 ), a broad peak diffracted at 2θ = 19.5° can be observed, characteristic of a low crystallinity polymer, considered appropriate for a TP. When CM is incorporated (14% (w/v)), the diffraction pattern becomes characteristic of a polymer with greater crystallinity, as the monoclinical crystallographic form originates from both malic acid and Citrulline. In the case of films with 20% (w/v) of CM, some crystalline peaks decrease in intensity, while others are enhanced, most probably due to morphological changes in both samples (see Fig. 3b and c). PVA is one of the main candidates for drug release, due to its relatively low crystallinity that facilitates release, due to molecules which are entangled and amorphous, rather than ordered. A high degree of crystallinity would trap the chemical agents within the semicrystalline structure, affecting the liberation process (Peppas & Tennenhouse, 2004). Although not discussed here, storage and loss modulus decreased when applied temperature and mechanical stress increased. The storage modulus represents the elastic component, which is related to the stiffness of the resulting product [50]. Therefore, a decrease in temperature should lead to an increase in stiffness. Fig. 6 a shows the change in Tan Delta, indicating a pseudo-thermodynamic transition (Tg) decrease with increase in CM and a consequent decrease in stiffness, related to the amorphous portions. This occurs despite the increase in stiffness due to the crystalline components. A 10 °C change in Tg is observed in Fig. 6b in the concentration range studied here [51,52]."
5,Spectroscopic properties,"3.3 Spectroscopic properties Both the infrared and Raman spectra were calculated and compared to the experimental patterns, in order to elucidate the chemical interactions between PVA and CM and confirm the proposed band assignation. Experimental infrared spectra are shown in Fig. 7 a. In PVA, the OH stretching vibration band of the hydroxyl groups appears at 3290 cm−1. The vibration band at 2908 cm−1 is due to the CH asymmetric stretching vibration and the 1431 cm−1 band corresponds to the C–H bending vibration of CH2. The C–H deformation vibration appears at 1311 cm−1 and the band at 1076 cm−1 is assigned to the C–O stretching bond of acetyl groups. The vibration band at 840 cm−1 is due to C–C stretching vibration [53]. Once malic acid is incorporated into PVA (PVA-M), the two main malic acid bands appear at 1230 and 1720 cm−1, corresponding to the C–O and CO vibration, respectively. As for Citrulline integration onto polymeric film (PVA-C), the carbonyl group (CO) and the amide/amine groups (N–H) vibrate at 1600 and 1650 cm−1, respectively [54,55]. Bands from all components overlap in the PVA-CM spectra. In the theoretical IR spectra (Fig. 7b), bands corresponding to hydroxyl groups fall between 3800 and 3700 cm−1 and the alkyl chain was at 3000 cm−1 in all PVA composites. However, in the experimental spectrum, these bands had broader impact, apparently as a result of hydrogen bond formation [56]. Furthermore, the theoretical calculation was made considering individual molecules, making the corresponding bands sharper in the predicted spectrum. The theoretical infrared spectrum of PVA with Malic acid (PVA-M) showed that carbonyl group bands of carboxylic acid were located between 1800 and 1781 cm−1. The carboxyl group vibration band displaces towards lower wavenumbers. This variation was associated with hydrogen bond formation and consequently the lower stretching energy for the CO bond. The calculated infrared band for PVA with Citrulline (PVA-C) reveals hydroxide bands from carboxylic acid and alcohol to PVA and Citrulline at 3740 to 3503 cm−1; also observed at lower wavenumbers. In addition, the CO bands of carboxyl and amide group were more resolved and exhibited a shift, which can be attributed to hydrogen bond formation. Vibration bands corresponding to N–H bond, from the amine and amide group bands, were observed at 1667 to 1624 cm−1. The results concurred with the experimental spectrum, although wavenumber variations in infrared bands between theoretical and experimental results were attributed to an overestimation of the theoretical result, inherent in the calculation. The calculated infrared spectrum of PVA-CM displayed the same bands as those observed in the experimental results. The theoretical spectrum showed bands attributed to hydroxyl groups of PVA and d-malic acid and to carboxyl O–H bonds, within the range of 3800–3500 cm−1. The N–H amide and amine bonds were observed in 3570 to 3470 cm−1, concurring with previous reports [57]. However, these bands were broader in the experimental spectrum and remained unresolved. Three vibration bands associated with CO bonds to carboxyl groups and the amide group were observed at 1787-1729 cm−1. These three bands were also present in the experimental spectrum. Finally, a band at 1646-1643 cm−1 was assigned to the bonds related to amine and amine groups. The presence of new, or the elimination of old bands is not evident, so we can assume that no chemical reaction takes place after the electrospinning process. Nonetheless, the decrease in the 3350 cm−1 band of OH groups suggests that an interaction takes place, which causes the formation of hydrogen bonds [55,58]. The experimental Raman spectrum of PVA in Fig. 8 a shows the band assigned to the vibration of aliphatic C–H at 2900 cm−1, concurring with previous works [55]. The CO bond, due to the carboxyl group of malic acid and to amide from Citrulline, appears at 1700-1780 cm−1. The H–N bond related to the amine and amide group vibrates at 3330 to 3450 cm−1 from Citrulline- Fig. 8b shows the Raman calculated spectrum for all chemicals and the results concur with those reported in other investigations [54,55,58], although, once again, wavenumber values were relatively overestimated by the theoretical method. As for the interaction models, the results for PVA-d-malic acid show the corresponding bands of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in PVA and malic acid at wavenumbers between 3752 and 3176 cm−1, followed by bands at 3104-2931 cm−1, attributed to the C–H bond from PVA and malic acid. Lastly, the bands at 1786 and 1783 cm−1 correspond to the CO bands of carboxyl groups of malic acid, showing a shift at lower wavenumbers, in comparison with pure d-Malic acid, as a consequence of hydrogen bond formation. In the case of PVA-l-Citrulline, the bands at 3818-3587 cm−1 were attributed to the H–O bonds, followed by the bands at 3513-3480 cm−1, which were assigned to the H–N amine and amide group of l-Citrulline. The C–H bonds, corresponding to l-citruline and PVA were observed at 3104-2937 cm−1. Bands at 1774.18 cm−1 and 1721.5 cm−1 were attributed to carbonyl groups of carboxylic acid and amide respectively, the last bands showed a shift to lower wavenumbers in comparison with the experimental materials, which as mentioned previously were the result of hydrogen bonding."
6,Citrulline malate delivery,"3.4 Citrulline malate delivery In the following, release characteristics are characterized, and Fig. 9 presents CM release results, as a function of time. As expected, time release depends on CM concentration within fibers. With 10% (w/v) of CM encapsulated, total time release was approximately 21 h, but when encapsulation increased to 20%, the time decreased to 11.5 h. Therefore, the greater the concentration, the shorter the time release. Interestingly, during the first 4 h there is almost the same CM release, regardless of concentration. Overall, these results suggest that as concentration increases, CM becomes more superficially integrated. The Korsmeyer Pepas model [24] appears to represent the energy supplement release mechanism, depicted in equation (1) and described in the methodology. The logarithmic relationship between the amount of drug released vs. the logarithm of time, for PVA with 20% of Citrulline Malate, was plotted as a fraction. The release exponent (n) was 1.14, indicating the controlled release of supplement that would result in stable concentration in the body. According to this model, n > 0.89 corresponds to super case-II transport, where the relaxation mechanism is associated with stress and the glassy state-transition is caused by the swelling of PVA chains, in contact with water or biological fluids [59,60]. Fig. 10 shows PVA weight loss in contact with a physiological fluid, together with the release of CM. Considering the transitions in the plot, the degradation of PVA can be divided into 4 stages: the first occurs within 1 h, where water diffuses through the polymer matrix around the alcohol group of the PVA chains, causing hydrogel swelling [61]. During this process, there is a change in volume, causing a burst release, when the 50% (w/v) of CM trapped in the polymeric chains is released. During the second stage, oligomers autocatalyze the polymer hydrolysis reaction, allowing the extra release of 16% CM. During the third stage, the polymeric mass decreases due to the oligomers moving out of the PVA matrix. Besides this, water diffuses into the voids created by oligomer removal, which in turn encourages oligomer diffusion that creates additional voids and so on. At this point, almost 100% of CM has been released. During the last stage, the polymeric matrix becomes porous and the total degradation of polymeric mass takes place [62]."
7,Theoretical interaction,"3.5 Theoretical interaction The development of pharmaceutical Nanosystems based on polymeric matrix requires a thorough knowledge of polymer-drug interactions [9,63,64]. In this sense, the use of theoretical-computational tools provides a competent approach for studying these materials. Likewise, theoretical calculation has made it possible to corroborate the experimental results and the UV-VIS, Raman, Infrared and NMR spectra also assist by assigning the correct band and signal to the widely differing material [41,65–67]. Considering the novel material design based on PVA-Citrulline Malate, theoretical-computational methods were employed to complement molecular characterization. Determinations at the theoretical level made it possible to verify the reactivity of the molecules, in order to also analyze their intermolecular interactions [68–71]. The structure and interaction of PVA with Malate, Citrulline and Citrulline Malate were simulated by theoretical computational chemistry. In this sense, the chemical structures were optimized by density functional theory (DFT), using the B3LYP functional and 6–311++G (d,p) basis set [20,72]. Because the target material was prepared by the addition of Citrulline and malic acid to the PVA-matrix, three interaction possibilities were considered. Two of these involved the molecules of Citrulline and malic acid with PVA and the third, the interaction of the two molecules with PVA. The optimized structures are presented in Fig. 11 . Structure (c) shows that the non-covalent interactions discussed here mainly constitute hydrogen bonds, formed between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the carboxylic groups of Malic acid and Citrulline. In the case of PVA-malic acid, four hydrogen bonds were identified. Likewise, the interaction between PVA-Citrulline generated three hydrogen bonds, but these were weaker in terms of interaction energy (Table 1 ) than those obtained in the PVA–malic acid model. When Citrulline Malate interacted with PVA, the same hydrogen bonds are obtained, although the distance between the hydrogen donor and acceptor increased. Furthermore, a new hydrogen bond is observed between one of the carboxylic groups of malic acid and the amine group of Citrulline. The stability and interaction force between PVA, Citrulline and malic acid were considered by calculating interaction energies, the results of which are summarized in Table 1. In these results, energy values fall within the range of those previously considered; the greatest value was observed for Citrulline Malate -PVA, followed by PVA-malic acid and finally the lowest energetic interaction was for PVA-Citrulline. We determined thermodynamic parameters, such as Gibbs free energy of formation, and used these to obtain the free energies involved in the drug release process and also the equilibrium constant values in gas phase. The results are summarized in Table 2 . Thermodynamic parameters indicate that the dissociation process of the PVA with Citrulline and malic acid are spontaneous, indicating a trend in the delivery of these compounds. This agrees with the experimental results, where the greater value is associated with the delivery of malic acid. The Interaction with malic acid rendered Gibbs free energy negative and a greater equilibrium constant value, signaling a strong trend to release this compound from the obtained material. Some properties for molecular reactivity were also calculated, including molecular electrostatic potential and molecular orbitals. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) map is frequently used to predict molecular reactivity in biological studies. In other studies, this property has been used as an indicator of reactivity regions in target molecules, with the purpose of studying electron-donor and electron-acceptor interactions. The MEP property was calculated in the present study, using B3LYP/6–311++G (d,p) theory. The color maps in Fig. 12 indicate a color range from +6.6 × 10−2 (deepest blue) to −6.6 × 10−2 (deepest red), showing high electronic density sites in red, electrophilic sites in blue, together with the potential values in the highest electron density sites. The malic acid and Citrulline interactions with PVA show the highest electronic density values located in oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups (the values range from −0.0395 to −0.0711). The highest electronic deficiencies in the target molecules are located at H–O (+0.0275 to +0.0762) (the hydrogen atom bonded at the carboxyl group). It is necessary to enhance the presence of another electron density deficiency (at hydrogen to amine and amide group). The lowest electronic density in the interaction PVA-Citrulline Malate was placed in the carboxyl group of Citrulline moiety (+0.0794), whereas high electronic density was placed in the carbonyl group of the amide group (−0.0602). This takes place as a consequence of the delocalization effect of the electron pair of nitrogen atoms. It is important to emphasize that these atoms would participate in non-covalent interactions with some receptor amino acid residues. The contours of the frontier molecular orbitals for the molecules studied are shown in Table 3 and Figs. 13 and 14 . The value of EHomo is related to the ability of the molecule to donate electrons; the d-Malic acid (−8.0) and the interaction PVA-Malic acid (−7.4) show the highest values and the best electron-donor capacity. Evidently, the EHOMO surface was located around the amide group of Citrulline with the PVA-Citrulline interaction being the moiety, though in the case of the PVA-Malate interaction, the homo orbital was located in the hydroxyl groups of the PVA model. The PVA-Citrulline Malate models showed HOMO in the same motif as the PVA-Citrulline interaction. Regarding the LUMO orbital, the interaction between PVA-Citrulline Malate and PVA-Citrulline showed the highest energy values and the molecule with the best electron accepting capacity (−1.365 and −1.192 eV). In these cases, the orbital was located around the group Citrulline carboxyl, in due structure."
8,Conclusions,"A transdermal system was developed to release sports energy enhancement supplement, employing the electrospinning technique. The integration of citrulline malate (CM) into PVA fiber caused a change in morphology and an increase in fiber diameter. FTIR results enabled us to conclude that a chemical reaction between the components is lacking. X-ray diffraction patterns indicated an enhancement in PVA crystallinity, although the effect was not considered important enough to affect CM release. CM concentration in the PVA fibers caused a decrease in the glass transition temperature. This was attributed to amorphous portions of the PVA-CM system, which are proportionately greater, decreasing stiffness in spite of the crystallinity effect. Time release depended on CM concentration. The spun fibers released CM in a controlled manner for 11.5 h with a transport type II (Korsmeyer-Peppas) release mechanism. Contrastingly, the PVA-CM degradation facilitated the delivery of supplement. A four stage degradation mechanism was proposed, for which it was determined that during the first 100 min, a linear burst release of 50% supplement, would favor a fast-acting effect. Theoretical calculations made it possible to establish an appropriate model for interaction between PVA/malic acid/Citrulline and CM. After modeling, the infrared and Raman spectra concurred with experimental results, the stability of interactions were evaluated by thermochemical parameters and GAP energy, indicating the greater capacity on the part of the system to deliver the Citrulline Malate, malic acid and l-Citrulline, concurring with experimental results. Finally, Intermolecular interactions were verified with molecular orbitals and electrostatic potential maps."
