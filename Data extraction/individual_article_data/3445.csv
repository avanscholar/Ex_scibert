0,Introduction,"With increasing consumption of fossil energy and emission of greenhouse gas, hydrogen, a clean and zero-carbon emission energy, is of great importance for sustainable environment [1]. To develop hydrogen energy, it is necessary to produce hydrogen from sustainable energy. Currently, hydrogen is mostly produced from fossil energy, which causes massive emission of CO2 as well as other serious environmental problems [2]. In contrast, biomass is considered as cheap and renewable energy, and the energy provided by biomass accounts for 10%–14% of the world’s overall consumption [3]. Among the biomass waste, the amount of rice husk was produced about annual 140 million tons [4]. Using rice husk as a raw material for hydrogen production not only reduces solid waste but also has no carbon emission over the whole life cycle of energy system [5]. Gasification is one of the most effective methods to convert biomass to hydrogen rich syngas. Syngas can be further applied in the chemical industry for producing fuels, such as methanol, hydrocarbons, ethanol, etc [6]. However, gasification process would produce the by-products, such as NOx, SOx and tar. Among them, the existence of tar is a major challenge because it has disadvantageous impacts on the equipment stable running, limiting the application of biomass gasification [7]. Therefore, the removal of tar is necessary. Tar is a complex mixture of condensable hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbon and other oxygen-containing organic molecules, which are produced by the pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [8]. Catalytic steam reforming of tar is one of effective methods, which can selectively convert tar to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons and useful gases (H2 and CO) with less energy consumption [9]. Generally, the two routes were researched in catalyst reforming of tar for hydrogen production on a single reactor. In the first route, tar model compounds were studied, such as toluene [10], phenol [11], naphthalene [12], acetic acid [13], alcohol [14], glycerol [15], etc. In the second route, the biomass pyrolysis was studied as real tar, which is considered meaningful for developing biomass gasification. However, the production of tar and catalyst reforming are carried out at the same time on a single reactor, resulting in difficult separation of catalysts and unclear reforming process for hydrogen production. Furthermore, gasification operation conditions affect the type of tar, such as process temperature, feedstock composition, gasifier pressure, residence time, etc [16,17]. Double reactor, which tar formed and catalytic reforming are separated, is more effective to control these two processes. Many catalysts were employed in tar reforming, such as Ru, Pt, Ni, Fe, Co, etc. Ni-based catalysts were widely studied due to some merits, such as improving water gas shift (WGS) reaction as Eq. (1), easy regeneration and low cost [18]. (1) C O + H 2 O = C O 2 + H 2 However, sintering and poisoning of Ni, and carbon deposition would cause such catalyst deactivation [19]. Many methods were adopted, such as bimetal, support and synthesis method to improve catalytic stability [20]. Introducing support enhances the surface of active phase, changes the distribution of product and improves the thermal stability [21]. Many supports have been studied, such as γ-Al2O3, alkaline oxide (MgO and CaO), oxygen affinities (CeO2, Fe2O3, MnOX and La2O3), and zeolites (SBA-15, ZSM-5 and MCM-41). Compared with other supports, zeolites are crystalline inorganic materials with well-ordered microspores and large surface [22]. Their unique structure determines catalytic properties [23,24]. MCM-41 is one type of mesoporous silica materials with large surface area, narrow aperture distribution, and good thermal stability [25]. It can increase the probability of surface reaction regarding its long-range, ordered hexagonal structure [25]. Hence, MCM-41 support is considered as an ideal candidate. Tian et al. [26] suggested that the Ni/MCM-41 could resist carbon deposition and sintering of metal due to the formation of the mesoporous channels with strong metal-support interaction. Perovskite is an octahedrons oxide whose general formula is ABO3. The A-site in structure function as a support, such as alkaline earth or lanthanide metal while the B-site is active point, such as transition metal. Compared with common metal oxides, perovskite shows special ability in oxygen migration and storage owing to the unique structure [5]. Oemar et al. [27] demonstrated that lattice oxygen in perovskite can enhance the adsorption ability of oxygen, which is attributed to oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface, and oxygen vacancy would promote WGS reaction. Therefore, perovskite can be used as both oxygen carrier and catalyst [28,29]. Ni-based bulk perovskite was widely reported in tar reforming. However, bulk perovskite of oxidation and catalytic activity could be inhibited compared with disperse perovskite on support. The supported perovskite has high specific surface area and thermal stability [30]. Based on the above analysis, the double fixed-bed system was developed in this study for steam reforming of in-situ tar and LaNiO3 perovskite catalyst supported on MCM-41 with different mole amounts (0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1) was employed. The operation conditions, such as reforming temperature and steam/carbon mass ratio, and stability of catalytic test by cycling five-time, were studied for the hydrogen rich syngas production. In addition, different characterization analyses including XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, XPS, TG-DTG and GC-MC were conducted to fresh and spent catalysts, in order to research catalyst’s physiochemical properties and their effects on steam reforming of in-situ tar."
1,Experiment,
2,Support preparation,"2.1 Support preparation MCM-41 nanoparticles was synthesized according to literature procedure [31]. In brief, 6.4 mL of deionized water, 0.9 g of ethanol, 0.28 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 0.02 g of diethanolamine (DEA) were mixed and stirred at 40 °C. After 30 min, 0.73 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added into mixed solution within 2 min under vigorous stirring, and continuous stirring 2 h. Then, the mixed solution was cooled to room temperature. The obtained solution was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol. The CTAB was removed by mixture of ethanol and hydrochloric acid (volume ratio 60 mL: 4 mL) under conditions of reflux, stir and 80 °C. The MCM-41 was obtained after centrifugation and washing with ethanol. In the end, the MCM-41 was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h with ramp of 10 °C/min."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The LaNiO3/MCM-41 catalyst was synthesized via sol-gel method. The synthesis process is described as follows. The 0.5 g MCM-41 support was dissolved into 20 mL ethanol under stirring. Then, the reagent of La (NO3)3·6H2O, Ni (NO3)2·6H2O and citric acid was added according to the mole ratio of total metal and citric acid 1:2. The mixture solution was stirred at room temperature till ethanol volatilization and sol was formed. The sol was dried at 100 °C about 24 h and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h with 5 °C/min, followed by calcination at 800 °C for 5 h. The obtained catalysts were crashed and sieved into particles of 106–120 μm. Catalyst samples, XmolLaNiO3/0.5gMCM-41(X = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1), were synthesized by the same method and were denoted as 0.025LN/MCM, 0.05LN/MCM, 0.075LN/MCM and 0.1LN/MCM, respectively. The LaNiO3 catalyst was also synthesized by the sol-gel method and was calcined by the same method. The sample of LaNiO3 was denoted as LN."
4,Biomass preparation,"2.3 Biomass preparation Rice husk from Jiangsu, China was selected as a type of biomass to produce in-situ tar. Rice husk need pretreatment before producing in-situ tar as follows. It was dried at 105 °C for 24 h to exclude interfere of self-water. Then, rice husk was crashed and sieved into particles of 180–250 μm as raw material. The ultimate and proximate analysis of rice husk was shown in Table 1 [32]. These investigation standards are American Society for Testing and Materials D1102-84(2007) method."
5,Catalyst test,"2.4 Catalyst test Catalyst steam reforming of in-situ tar was investigated for hydrogen rich syngas production using (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM and LN catalysts samples in a double fixed-bed system as shown in Fig. 1 . In first-stage fixed-bed (320 mm × Φ 27 mm), 2 g rice husk was loaded into a quartz boat, and it was quickly pyrolyzed at 450 °C for producing in-situ tar under heating center of the quartz tube (500 mm × Φ30 mm). The selection of pyrolysis temperature was illustrated in the supplementary data as shown in Fig. S1. In second-stage fixed-bed (320 mm × Φ 31 mm), the 0.25 g of catalyst sample was loaded in a quartz tube (500 mm × Φ 20 mm) for studying steam reforming of in-situ tar, and the position of catalyst sample was consistent with temperature sensor the central of reactor. The reforming reaction conditions are 500 °C-900 °C, steam/carbon mass ratio (S/C = 0.6–1) and reforming time (40 min). In order to study the catalyst’s stability, cycle test was carried out at optimum conditions of hydrogen production. Every experiment, the catalyst was kept in second-stage fixed-bed without any other changes while just fresh rice husk was introduced in first-stage fixed-bed. The spent catalyst was cycled five-time, and every cycled gas and liquid samples were investigated three times at least and the average results were obtained. In this progress, Ar gas (100 mL/min) was used as carrier gas and protect gas to exclude air at the beginning, and water was vaporized at 200 °C in preheater before entering second-stage fixed-bed in the vapor state. The quartz wool was covered on reactor of inlet and outlet to ensure reaction temperature uniformed. The produced gas was dried and cooled with anhydrous calcium chloride and condenser, respectively. Then, produced gas was collected by collecting bag and detected on gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Every production gas was investigated three times at least, and the results were averaged. H2, CO and CH4 were analyzed by a TDX-01 column while CO2 was analyzed by a Porapak Q column. The liquid products from condenser were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS: ThermoFisher). In each run, the ethyl acetate as solvent extract organic production on mix liquefied, and the extractions were analyzed by AB-5MS capillary column. The samples were investigated three times, and results were averaged."
6,Data definition,"2.5 Data definition The gas composition was denoted as Eq. (2). (2) G a s c o m p o s i t i o n ( % ) = X i X H 2 + X C O + X C H 4 + X C O 2 × 100 % where X i is volume concentration fraction of component i. Low heating value (LHV) of gas product (kJ/Nm3) was denoted as Eq. (3). (3) L H V ( k J / N m 3 ) = 126.4 C C O + 108.0 C H 2 + 358.2 C C H 4 Where C C O , C H 2 and C C H 4 are concentration of CO, H2 and CH4, respectively. Gas yield was denoted as Eq. (4). (4) G a s y i e l d ( N m 3 / k g ) = V t M × Y i where V t is the total volume of the produced gas at normal condition (m3) and M is the mass of rice husk (kg), and Y i are gas composition of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4, respectively. H2/CO was denoted as Eq. (5). (5) H 2 / C O = N H 2 N C O where N H 2 and N C O is mole amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Notable, the LN on (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts are 0.138 g, 0.178 g, 0.197 g, 0.208 g respectively, while LN without loading is 0.25 g. In order to determine the influence of loading amount on gas distribution, the standard of 0.25 g, the same as the amount of catalyst, was used to calculate gas production."
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization Crystal phases of the fresh (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts, LN and spent catalysts after steam reforming at 500°C-900 °C were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD: X′ Pert Pro MPD) using Cu Ka radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. These samples were scanned at 2θ angle from 20° to 80° with a scanning rate of 2°/min. Whereas, the MCM-41 support was scanned at 2θ angle from 0° to 10°. The type of carbon deposition was investigated by Thermo-gravimetry analysis (TGA: NETZSCH STA449F3). In each run, the spent LN/MCM catalyst sample about 10 mg after first-time and five-time were tested at 30°C-1000 °C with ramp of 10 °C/min and air flow 50 mL/min. Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Horiba LabRAMHR-800 Raman spectrometer equipped. It’s the excitation wavelength is 532 nm and CCD detector is 1024 × 256 pixels. Elemental analysis of oxygen in the perovskite was carried out by a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS,Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD) using amonochromatized Al kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV photons) operated at a constant dwell time of 100 ms and pass energy of 40 eV. Binding energies of the analyzed elements were referenced to the C 1s hydrocarbon peak at 284.8 eV. A high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 200, FEI, Netherlands) was applied to test the surface morphology of fresh LN/MCM and LN catalysts, and spent LN/MCM catalyst after first-time and five-time. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the catalysts sample were determined with BET test analysis using TriStar II Series device and with nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at −196 °C."
8,Results and discussion,
9,N2-absorption-desorption isotherms,"3.1 N2-absorption-desorption isotherms The textural properties of fresh MCM-41 support, (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM and LN catalysts were employed using N2-adsorption-desorption isotherms method. The results of textural properties were summarized in Table 2 . As can be seen in Table 2, the MCM-41 support shows maximum specific surface area. On the other hand, the (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts of surface area, pore volume and pore diameter were decreased from 553.2 m2/g to 111.4 m2/g, from 1.218 cm3/g to 0.468 cm3/g and from 5.95 nm to 3.56 nm, respectively. The decrease of pore volume reveals the inside pores of MCM-41 support could be occupied by LaNiO3 molecule because it could occupy the mesopores without any constrictions [33]. However, the LN catalyst shows minimum surface area and pore volume, and increased pore diameter. Fig. 2 shows N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution. The (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts sharp enhancement in absorption and desorption volumes were registered in the relative pressure P/P0 range of 0.5–0.9, suggesting uniformity of pore size distribution of each mesoporous silica. The (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts exhibit type IV isotherms according to IUPAC classification, indicating a mesoporous structure as shown in Fig. 2(a). Similar result has been observed in literature [34,35]. Pore size distribution of MCM-41 support and (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts are in a narrow range of 3–6 nm, indicative of the dominant mesoporous structure, consistent with the small angle of XRD characterization."
10,XRD analysis,"3.2 XRD analysis The XRD patterns of (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts with small-angle are shown in Fig. 3 (a). The XRD pattern of MCM-41 support shows three peaks at 2θ = 2.1°, 3.9° and 4.4°, respectively. It was attributed to (100), (110) and (220) lattice plane which is related to the hexagonal symmetry lattice, indicating the highly ordered and hexagonal mesoporous structure of MCM-41 [36,37]. Loading of LN catalyst had significant effects on the pore structure of MCM-41support. The lattice plane of (100), (110) and (220) diffraction peaks shows a decrease with increasing load amount of LN catalyst in intensity. Especially, the lattice plane (100) shows obvious decrease. It could be attributed that the partial pore was blocked due to the high-loading, causing the decline in long-range order of hexagonal arrange as reported by Wang et al. [33]. However, compared with XRD patterns of MCM-41support, (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts shows the same lattice plane. These results illustrate that the pore structure was well maintained at different loading amount of LN catalysts. The high angle XRD patterns of catalyst samples are shown in Fig. 3(b). The 2θ peaks of LN catalyst show 22.87°, 32.89°, 47.73°, 59.61°, 70.24° and 78.7°, respectively. Compared with LN catalyst (PDF-33-0711), the diffraction peak of (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM is similar and no other crystalline phase is observed [38], which was revealed the LN catalyst was highly dispersed in MCM-41 support. However, the diffraction peak of 0.025LN/MCM shows decline in intensity. The MCM-41 support possessed larger pore size and volume in result of N2 adsorption-desorption (in Section 3.1). An amount of LN catalyst could stay inside pore. Hence, the response of diffraction peak was decreased."
11,Catalytic steam reforming of in-situ tar in double fixed-bed,"3.3 Catalytic steam reforming of in-situ tar in double fixed-bed 3.3.1 Effect of loading amount of LaNiO3 on gas distribution (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts was compared with effect of loading amount on gas distribution at 700 °C and S/C (0.8). The hydrogen gas composition enhanced from 31.4% to 57.9% due to increase loading amount of LN catalyst as shown in Fig. 4 (a). However, the hydrogen gas composition of LN catalyst is 49.0%. These results illustrated that MCM-41 supported LaNiO3 catalyst can enhance hydrogen production. From SEM (In Section 3.6) and BET (In Section 3.1) results, it could be attributed that (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts shows a lot of porous and higher relative specific surface, compared with LN catalyst. Herein, MCM-41 support increase distribution of LN catalyst to improve the contact area and ensure enough reaction time, which is one of the effective factors of catalyst activity [21]. In order to explain the effect of a catalyst for steam reforming of in-situ tar, the blank experiment was investigated. The in-situ tar produced by the pyrolysis of rice husk contains a large amount of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide while hydrogen is contrary as shown in Fig. 4(b). Steam participate in WGS reaction, is one of the important roles for hydrogen production, which was considered as a production way of hydrogen [39]. Chew et al. [40] suggested the effect of steam for hydrogen rich gas production on gasification biomass, and the yield of hydrogen shows obviously improvement at 900 °C. This trend is similar to our work. However, the gas yield of hydrogen and H2/CO shows slightly improvement from 1.37 Nm3/kg to 1.68 Nm3/kg and from 0.20 to 0.23, respectively. It could be attributed to the stable organic compound in tar, such as phenol, benzene, etc, and higher flow of carrier gas, causing the low conversion of tar without catalyst and short contact time. Compared with catalytic steam reforming of in-situ tar, the gas yield of hydrogen and H2/CO was obviously improved whatever catalyst was loaded. It was illustrated that the LN shows good catalytic performance for hydrogen rich gas production. 3.3.2 Effect of reforming temperature on gas distribution Temperature of steam reforming is one of important factors to influence gas distribution. The reaction balance could be broken due to difference of endothermic or exothermic reactions. The 0.1LN/MCM was further studied on steam reforming of in-situ tar based on production of hydrogen rich gas (in Section3.3.1). The variation range of LHV ranges from 489.6 KJ/Nm3 to 3740.0 KJ/Nm3 with the increase of temperature as shown in Fig. 5 (a). Li et al. [41] suggested rice husk gasification with steam, and the LHV shows higher (over 10000KJ/Nm3) than it at 900 °C. Pyrolysis temperature can also change the gas distribution, which further affect LHV, and pyrolysis temperature of rice husk over 800 °C was considered as pyrolysis completed [42]. Compared with our work, the rice husk was pyrolyzed at 450 °C, which may be the reason to show lower LHV. For the gas composition as shown Fig. 5(a), the hydrogen gas shows the major gas composition. These results are similar to Akubo et al. reported [43], which was used as 10 wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. It is different that the hydrogen composition is higher at the same conditions, which could be attributed to the structure of 0.1LN/MCM. The gas yield of hydrogen shows maximum 61.9 Nm3/kg at temperature 800 °C, and Yao et al. [44]shows the same results. In theory, the higher temperature is good for breaking a chemical bond to form small molecule of easier reaction. In contrary, the gas yield decreased at 900 °C, particularly, the gas yield of hydrogen shows obviously decrease. It could be attributed that the perovskite structure was destructed at 900 °C as shown in Fig. 6 Compared with fresh 0.1LN/MCM catalyst, the diffraction peak of LaNiO3 perovskite can be detected after reforming 500°C–800 °C. In contrast, the diffraction peak of LaNiO3 perovskite disappeared after reforming at 900 °C. A number of other peaks were detected, such as La2O2CO3, Ni and La2NiO4, which could be attributed to destroy the structure of perovskite. However, the structure of perovskite is important to catalyze steam reforming of in-situ tar because oxygen vacancies can catalysis WGS reaction to produce hydrogen rich gas [45]. In in-situ tar reforming for hydrogen rich syngas production process, the LaNiO3 could be reduced by hydrogen gas produced. Then, produced La2O3 can react with CO2 to form La2O2CO3 at higher temperature, which is regarded as decarbonation reaction, decreasing catalyst’s carbon deposition. Furthermore, The La2O2CO3 can be reduced to La2O3 by carbon [46]. Cheng et al. [47] demonstrated the La2O3 with NiO in steam conditions will be re-oxide to LaNiO3. However, in this process, the lattice distortion and lattice re-organization can exist at a higher temperature, causing structure formation from LaNiO3 to La2NiO4, which cause reforming activity to decrease [47]. In order to determine that the hydrogen production was suitable with 0.1LN/MCM catalyst at 800 °C and S/C (0.8), the (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM and LN catalysts were further studied in that condition. 0.1LN/MCM catalyst still shows the best hydrogen yield (61.9 Nm3/Kg) and LHV (3740 KJ/Nm3) as presented in Fig. S2. Compared with the results of the (0.025–0.1) LN/MCM catalysts at 700 °C and S/C (0.8) in Section 3.3.1, the gas yield and LHV shows increase. The results revealed that the reforming temperature was significant fact for hydrogen-rich syngas production, and the 0.1LN/MCM catalyst displays best catalytic activity at 800 °C and S/C (0.8). 3.3.3 Effect of S/C ratio on gas distribution The effect of S/C ratio was studied based on production of hydrogen rich gas (In Section 3.3.2). Hydrogen is the main component on gas composition as shown Fig. 7 (a). LHV was enhanced with increasing of S/C ratio, which maximum value is 3740.0 KJ/Nm3 on S/C (0.8). The gas yield of hydrogen is varied from 34.3 Nm3/kg to 61.9 Nm3/kg as shown in Fig. 7(b). The amount of steam can improve WGS reaction and partially decompose deposited carbon, resulting in improving the hydrogen yield and remain catalyst’s activity. However, the higher S/C ratio shows lower LHV and hydrogen yield. It was attributed that the excessive steam could carry amounts of heat, decreasing reaction temperature and changing chemical reactions. In the previous work [48], the different ratio of steam and bio-char was studied via ANSYS, which was stimulated reaction temperature of furnace. Excessive steam decreases center temperature of furnace while outlet temperature increases. Similarly, the excessive steam, namely, higher S/C ratio, could change temperature of reactor to influence endothermic reaction, such as Eqs. (6)–(8). Hence, the higher S/C decreases the production of hydrogen on steam reforming of tar. (6) C H 4 + H 2 O = 3 H 2 + C O (7) C + C O 2 = 2 C O"
12,Cycle test in double fixed-bed,"3.4 Cycle test in double fixed-bed 3.4.1 Gas analysis The 0.1LN/MCM was used to studied behavior of cycles based on optimum conditions for producing hydrogen rich syngas at 800 °C and S/C (0.8). Fig. 8 (a) shows gas composition in every cycle display same trend which hydrogen gas is the main component, and LHV vary from 3740.0 kJ/Nm3 to 3899.9 kJ/Nm3. In cycle process, the gas yield of hydrogen and carbon dioxide show decrease from 61.9 Nm3/kg to 48.6 Nm3/kg and from 15.6 Nm3/kg to 11.2 Nm3/kg, respectively. Whereas, the gas yield of carbon monoxide displays an increase from 25.1 Nm3/kg to 33.6 Nm3/kg. The results illustrate that the carbon deposited could be decreased activity of Ni. The Ni shows higher catalysis activity of C–H bond, which is prone to produce hydrogen gas [49]. However, the surface of 0.1LN/MCM catalyst after five-time cycles shows amorphous carbon which is easily removed, keeping catalyst activity (In Section 3.5). The blank experiment without 0.1LN/MCM catalyst on the same conditions was demonstrated whether 0.1LN/MCM catalyst lost activity after five-time cycles. Compared with 0.1LN/MCM catalyst steam reforming of in-situ tar, the gas yield without 0.1LN/MCM catalyst significantly decrease. The gas yield in every cycle displays higher than it on the blank experiment. Hence, the 0.1LN/MCM catalyst shows good stability after five-time cycles. 3.4.2 Liquid analysis The identification of the major components on steam reforming of in-situ tar after cycling with and without 0.1LN/MCM catalyst were displayed by GC-MS at 800 °C and S/C (0.8), and the results are present in Table 3 . As shown in Table 3, the major production of steam reforming of in-situ tar is phenol and phenol, 3-methyl on with and without 0.1LN/MCM catalyst. The composition of in-situ tar mainly include phenols compound, which is attributed that lignin is the major composition on rice husk [50]. Lignin pyrolysis produces mainly, CO, C1–C3 hydrocarbons, phenols, etc, and phenol as tar model compound to catalyze steam reforming for hydrogen production were many reported [51–53]. From liquid production result, the content of phenol show obviously decrease by 3.13% after 1st reaction, which is explained that 0.1LN/MCM catalyst is effective to convert phenols compound. Phenol is adsorbed due to the interaction of aromatic –OH group and π-electron system on the perovskite oxide, and the steam dissociate to hydroxyl group over the perovskite oxide surface for the adsorption phenol by Baamran et al. reported [54]. Phenol adsorbed over the perovskite oxide surface occur interaction due to several successive steps, resulting in break phenol ring and format small molecule, such as H2, CO, CO2, etc [55]. The 0.1LN/MCM catalyst after five-time cycles at the same conditions also shows higher catalyst activity for conversion phenols compound than without catalyst. Though, the activity of 0.1LN/MCM displays slightly decrease with the increasing cycle number, which could be attributed to carbon deposition and it can cover activity site, decreasing catalystic activity. 0.1LN/MCM catalyst keeps catalyst activity after five-time cycles, compared with no catalyst. These results were corresponded to gas distribution on steam reforming of in-situ tar (in Section 3.4.1)."
13,Carbon deposition analysis,"3.5 Carbon deposition analysis The weight loss curves of spent 0.1LN/MCM catalyst after first-time and five-time cycles on optimum conditions were shown in Fig. 9 (a)-(b), respectively. In this process, the curve was shown two stages. a) The curve increased slightly before 450 °C. b) The curve decreased rapidly after 450 °C, which is attributed to decompose carbon deposition. The metal Ni separated from 0.1LN/MCM catalyst could be oxidized under air condition in stage (a). Li et al. [56] shows the same results. From the DTG profiles, 0.1LN/MCM catalyst after first-time and five-time cycles appears one weight loss peak, which is attributed to decompose carbon deposition. These temperatures of weight loss peaks are 539.8 °C and 541.5 °C, respectively. Koike et al. [57] suggested that the amorphous carbon can be decomposed at a lower temperature while graphitic carbon is contrary. These peaks should be attributed to amorphous carbon species on the spent 0.1LN/MCM catalyst surface. In order to further explain type of carbon, Fig. 9(c) shows the Raman spectral after cycling samples. One peak at 1342 cm−1 (D-peak) is ascribed to the amorphous carbon and one peak at 1580 cm−1 (G-peak) is ascribed to the graphitic carbon [58]. The intensity of IG/ID can be evaluated the structure of surface carbon due to order of graphitic carbon structure, and the IG/ID value represents the degree of order. From these results, the IG/ID is slightly enhanced from 0.77 to 0.79, indicating the surface carbon deposition could trend to produce graphitic carbon after five-time cycles. Hence, the temperature of loss weight is increased due to graphitic carbon with better thermo-oxidative stability [59]. However, the value of IG/ID is less than 1 after first-time and five-time cycles, suggesting most amorphous carbon is produced. Amorphous carbon species are prone to easily gasify in oxide agent, such as steam, resulting in the retention of catalytic activity the 0.1LN/MCM catalyst [60]. Whereas, Kelarakis et al. [61] suggested the amorphous carbon could be converted to graphitic carbon because it was gasified in time. It was illustrated that the MCM-41supported LaNiO3 could suppress the production of graphitic carbon, compared with previous work [13]."
14,SEM analysis,"3.6 SEM analysis Surface electrical microscope was used to evaluate morphology of LN and 0.1LN/MCM catalyst as shown in Fig. 10 a-b. There are only few pores on the surface of LN catalyst while pore of 0.1LN/MCM catalyst shows a significant enhancement. Hence, 0.1LN/MCM catalyst reveals a higher specific surface area and pore volume, which result was illustrated in Section 3.1. Fig. 10(b) shows partial agglomerates spots on outside pore. It could be attributed to migration of the LN species out of the supports during the calcination procedure [62]. The fresh 0.1LN/MCM catalyst was analyzed by EDX mapping to evaluate surface (O, Si, La and Ni) and atom ratio as shown Fig. 10 c-d. From this result, the approximate La/Ni atom ratio was 1:1 and elements uniformly distribute. Fig. 10 e-f shows surface morphology of spent 0.1LN/MCM catalyst after first-time and five-time cycles. The pore structure was not destroyed after first-time cycle. The results showed that the structure was stable and kept higher catalyst activity. Also, Fig. 10(f) shows spent 0.1LN/MCM catalyst after five-time cycles. Its surface pore was blocked due to carbon deposition which is mainly amorphous carbon after first-time and five-time cycles as shown in Section 3.5. The amorphous carbon can be removed, such as Eq. (8), which is beneficial to prevent the deactivation of the catalyst to some extent [63]. Hence, the catalyst activity of in-situ tar reforming was kept after five-time cycles.

15,XPS analysis,"3.7 XPS analysis The XPS analysis of fresh LN and 0.1LN/MCM catalysts was conducted to characterize chemical status of O. As shown in Fig. 11 , there were three peaks observed in the O 1s. 528.6 eV and 529.6 eV are attributed to lattice oxygen (O2−, Oβ). 530.0 eV–533.0 eV which is assigned to the different adsorbed oxygen species [64]. Compared with the LN catalyst, the 0.1LN/MCM catalyst shows other peaks centered at around binding energy 533.10 eV–533.23 eV, which is corresponding to oxygen of Si–O–Si [65]. The peak centered on lattice oxygen slight shift towards the high binding energy, which could be due to the connection with Si. Yang et al. [66] suggested the MoO3/MCM-41 shows the same results. The peak shift is found to form Mo–O–Si bond. Similarly, the M-O-Si (M = La and Ni) could be formed. Compared with the fresh 0.1LN/MCM catalyst, the 0.1LN/MCM catalyst after first-time and five-time cycles shows three peaks. However, the peak area ratio of lattice oxygen with fresh 0.1LN/MCM and 0.1LN/MCM after five-time cycles catalyst is decreased from 36.9% to 1.9% as shown in Table S1. This results illustrated the lattice oxygen participates in steam reforming of in-situ tar. Huang et al. [67] suggested that lattice oxygen can release oxygen [O] to oxidize carbon as Eq. (9). Hence, the surface carbon deposition could be removed to keep catalyst’s activity after five-time cycles. (9) C + 2 [ O ] → C O 2"
16,Conclusions,"The double fixed-bed system was developed and employed in steam reforming of in-situ tar for hydrogen rich syngas production. In the first-stage fixed-bed, the rice husk pyrolysis format in-situ tar at 450 °C. Simultaneously, the conditions of steam reforming reaction were studied in second-stage fixed-bed, such as different loading mole amount of XLaNiO3/MCM-41 catalysts (X = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1), reforming temperature (500 °C–900 °C) and S/C (0.6–1). These results revealed the 0.1LaNiO3/MCM-41 catalyst displayed a good performance of gas yield of hydrogen (61.9 Nm3/kg), LHV (3740.0KJ/Nm3) and H2/CO (2.4) at 800 °C and S/C (0.8). The results were attributed that the 0.1LaNiO3/MCM-41 shows good dispersion and stable structure. Under this condition and after five-time cycles, 0.1LaNiO3/MCM-41 showed a stable hydrogen composition of around 50%, and 0.1LaNiO3/MCM-41 effectively catalyzed the phenol compound in in-situ tar. Furthermore, 0.1LaNiO3/MCM-41 catalyst remained catalytic activity after five-time cycles. It was attributed that the carbon deposition was mostly amorphous, and lattice oxygen released for removing deposited carbon was a possible reason for 0.1LaNiO3/MCM-41 catalyst’s stable catalytic performance."
