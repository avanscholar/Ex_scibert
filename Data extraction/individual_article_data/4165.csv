0,Introduction,"To meet the ever-increasing energy and environmental crisis, exploring renewable and efficient fuel sources (e.g., H2) to replace traditional unsustainable fossil-fuels has nowadays gained tremendous interest. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) from water splitting process driven by solar light is regarded as a promising technology for solving global energy problem with zero pollution [1]. However, a variety of existing photocatalysts suffer from drawbacks of poor visible light absorption and rapid recombination of photo-generated charges, in turn resulting in limited solar-to-hydrogen efficiency [2–4]. In this respect, seeking highly-efficient and cost-effective photocatalyst remains key to boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. It is well known that nanostructured CdS possesses favorable photocatalytic water splitting capability because of its superb visible-light absorption. However, cadmium metal is not satisfactory from eco-friendliness. In addition, most of the cadmium-containing materials were devised to be integrated with noble metals, thereby impeding their practical applications. Unlike CdS, non-heavy-metal based ZnS has received enormous research attention to date owing to its environmental benignancy and relatively narrow band gap energy [5]. Nevertheless, existing drawbacks pertaining to low visible light absorption and small surface areas are still evident. Thus, it is desirable to rationally modify pristine ZnS via teaming up with other emerging materials for seeking the improvement of its PHE efficiency [6–9]. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the exploration of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbide, nitride, and carbonitride materials (labeled as MXene) because of their conspicuous merits such as hydrophilic surface nature and large surface area and so on [10,11]. In general, MXene is represented by the formula as Mn+1AXn, where M is an early transition metal, A is 13 or 14 group element, X is either C and/or N, and n is between 1 and 3. Of particular note, the prevailing MXene, titanium carbide (Ti3C2), can be fabricated by simply etching away the Al from the Ti3AlC2 precursor in a solution of HF or LiF-HCl to produce accordion-like Ti3C2TX layers (T denotes OH, O, and/or F groups), followed by sonication-assisted exfoliation to generate thin layers [12–14]. Benefited from the successful realization, earth-abundant, ultrathin Ti3C2 MXene offers key advantages in the field of degradation [15], energy storage [16], electrocatalytic oxygen/hydrogen evolution [17,18], electromagnetic absorption applications [19] and PHE. For instance, Zhang et al. designed a d-Ti3C2/TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites that displayed a superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (1.62 mmol g−1 h−1) driven by a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter [20]. Peng and colleagues found that the ternary Cu/TiO2@Ti3C2Tx showed high H2 production rate of 860 μmol g−1 h−1 as compared to its bare counterparts upon solar light irradiation [21]. Along this line, the direct synergy of Ti3C2 nanosheets and ZnS nanoparticles into comprehensive photocatalyst is meaningful to enhance the PHE activity due to that the exfoliated 2D Ti3C2 nanosheets have the excellent optical properties to improve the visible light absorption and high electrical conductivity to promote the charge transfer [22,23]. In this contribution, we report facile synthesis of an innovative ZnS/Ti3C2 hybrid photocatalyst that exhibits favorable photocatalytic H2 production efficiency. The as-synthesized hybrid shows a significantly enhanced hydrogen generation rate of 502.6 μmol g−1 h−1, which remains 4-fold higher than that of bare ZnS. The photocatalytic activity of hybrid catalyst involving Ti3C2 MXene with favorable conductivity outperforms that of an ZnS/graphene counterpart. This study is anticipated to shed further light on the design of cost-effective and environmentally-benign MXene-based photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H2 production in a practical fashion."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of Ti3C2 nanosheets,"2.1 Preparation of Ti3C2 nanosheets We attempted to fabricate accordion-like Ti3C2T X nanoparticles via a liquid-phase exfoliation method [24]. Briefly, 2 g Ti3AlC2 (400 mesh, purchased from jilin 11 Technology Co., Ltd.) was slowly added into 40 mL hydrofluoric acid solution (HF, Sinopharm Co., China) under 200 rpm magnetic stirring at 25 °C for 24 h. The suspension was subsequently centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min to remove the soluble fluorides. The supernatant was removed and deionized water was repeatedly 5–6 times applied until the pH of the supernatant was close to 6.0. Collected sediment (denoted as Ti3C2TX) was dried in a vacuum oven at 35 °C for 24 h. Further, a desired amount of Ti3C2TX was immersed in 40 mL of de-aerated water and sonicated for 4 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min, the sediment was dried (denoted as Ti3C2sed) and the supernatant suspension was collected (denoted as Ti3C2 nanosheets). The concentration of the obtained Ti3C2 nanosheets in the aqueous solution was determined to be 5 g L−1."
3,Preparation of ZnS/Ti3C2,"2.2 Preparation of ZnS/Ti3C2 Fig. 1 illustrates the preparation procedure of ZnS/Ti3C2, encompassing sequential steps of diluted HF etching, ultrasonic exfoliation, and solvothermal reaction. 0.02 mol TAA was dissolved into 50 mL of ethanol-glycerol mixture by magnetic stirring at room temperature for 5 min. After a certain amount of Ti3C2 nanosheets in aqueous solution and 0.01 mol ZnCl2 were added into the suspension under magnetic stirring. The mixture was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 10 h. By natural cooling down to room temperature, the resulting sample was washed three times alternately using deionized water and alcohol, dried in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain the final product. The mass ratios of Ti3C2 to ZnS were designed at 0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.5 wt%, in response, the obtained samples were labeled as ZT0, ZT0.15, ZT0.5, ZT0.75, ZT1 and ZT1.5, respectively. ZnS/RGO was obtained following the identical protocol except for replacing Ti3C2 by RGO. For comparison, ZTtwo catalyst was fabricated via physically mixing ZnS and Ti3C2 nanosheets at the equal proportion with that in ZT0.75."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Zeiss SUPRA40), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were employed to characterize the morphological and elemental features of photocatalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker-D8-AXS diffraction instrument was utilized to characterize the crystallographic properties of photocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted with the aid of an ESCALA 260 Xi system. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Spectrum 400 spectrometer (NEXUS) in the range of 500–4000 cm−1 using KBr as a reference. To probe the UV–Vis absorption properties (200–800 nm), UV–vis-DRS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) was employed. Room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on powder samples by using a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (FP-6500, Japan) under the excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The time-resolved and steady-state photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Analytical Instrument FLS 980 Spectrophotometer. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface areas (SBET) and pore volume (PV) of the samples were evaluated by N2 adsorption/desorption on a BELSORP-miniII gas adsorption apparatus (Japan). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were conducted on Perkin Elmer Pyris 6 TG-DTA analyzer in an N2 ambient with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out on a Zennium IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany). Transient photocurrent responses (TPC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were accordingly performed. The preparation method of the working electrode was described in our previous study [25]. A platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode in the electrochemical analyzer system, respectively. 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as electrolyte. 300 W Xe lamp was applied as the light source."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE),"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) The photocatalytic reaction was performed in Labsolar-III (Beijing Perfectlight) under 300 W Xe lamp. The reaction cell consists of a 100 mL quartz vessel that was suitable for vertical illumination. Simultaneously, circulating the water filter maintained the temperature of the solution at room temperature and purging the argon gas removed the air in the reactor. In all tests, 50 mg catalyst was suspended in 80 mL solution (lactic acid:water = 1:4, v/v) by magnetic stirring. The reaction was carried out for successive 5 h and the amount of hydrogen evolved was analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
7,Results and discussions,"Fig. 2 a shows the XRD patterns of Ti3C2TX and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The reference signals of Ti3AlC2 precursor at 13.2°, 38.9°, 48.6° and 56.8° disappear for the etched products; in addition, the peaks for the (0 0 4) and (1 0 1) planes have a slight shift due to the etching effect [26]. The maintenance of the (0 0 2) plane and the broadening of the (1 0 5) plane also suggest that the host layer is well-preserved with no evident oxidation and shrinkage of the crystalline sizes. As for the hybrids, all the XRD patterns in Fig. 2b show the typical diffraction pattern of standard wurtzite ZnS phase (JCPDS No. 39-1363) [27]. No obvious diffraction signals of Ti3C2 can be observed, which is attributed to the low dosing content of MXene. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 3 a displays the morphology of pure Ti3C2TX, showing an accordion-like layered structure. This is derived from the loss of Al layer within the pristine Ti3AlC2 precursor (Fig. S1a). Close-up SEM image of Ti3C2TX exhibits the 2D nature of the exfoliated layer with thicknesses of ca. 50 nm, in good agreement with the previous reported result obtained on a basis of packed Ti3AlC2 (Fig. S1b) [28]. Fig. S1c displays the SEM image of Ti3C2sed, evidencing that the sediment is 2D few layer nanoflakes with large diameter. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Ti3C2 nanosheets is presented in Fig. 3b, which explicitly fairly manifests the formation of thin pieces. Figs. S2 and 3c depict the TEM image of pristine ZnS (ZT0) and the SEM image of ZT0.75 (representing the ZnS/Ti3C2 hybrid with the weight ratio Ti3C2 of 0.75%). It can be observed that ZT0.75 presents a uniform smoother microsphere structure with sizes ranging between 2 and 3 μm, whilst ZT0 has a rougher surface with sizes ∼1 μm, which manifests that the introduction of Ti3C2 nanosheets promotes particles nucleation. As shown in Fig. 3d, corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of ZT0.75 illustrates the interplanar lattice fringes of 0.312 nm and 0.261 nm, which accords well with the (0 0 8) plane of wurtzite phase ZnS and (2 0 2) plane of Ti3C2, respectively [29]. This serves as a direct evidence of successful incorporation of ZnS and Ti3C2 to form ZT0.75 composite. Moreover, the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX) curve of ZT0.75 in Fig. S1d corroborates the presence of Zn, S, Ti and C elements. The chemical compositions of obtained products were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectra are collected, revealing no observable difference between ZT0 and ZT0.75 (Fig. 4 a). With respect to the Zn 2p and S 2p spectra, the main peaks of ZT0 slightly shift to higher binding energies as compared to those of ZT0.75, which could be attributed to the interfacial connection between Ti3C2 and ZnS (Fig. 4b and c). In addition, Ti 2p spectrum of ZT0.75 in Fig. 4d displays signals with the binding energies locating at 454.8 eV, 460.0 eV, 461.8 eV and 464.5 eV, which can be assigned to TiC 2p3/2, TiO 2p3/2, TiC 2p1/2 and TiO 2p1/2, respectively [30], but the Ti 2p spectrum of bare Ti3C2 nanosheets (Fig. S3) indicates TiC 2p1/2 at 458.0 eV, this shift suggests the strong interaction and possible charge transfer between Ti3C2 nanosheets and ZnS. The O 1s spectrum of ZT0.75 in Fig. 4e exhibits three convoluted peaks, corresponding to the signal from adsorbed H2O (533.2 eV), adsorbed oxygen (531.9 eV), and TiO (529.9 eV), respectively. Fig. 4f presents the high-resolution F 1s spectrum of ZT0.75, showing negligible content of F element (684.3 eV) that is in sharp contrast to the scenario of Ti3C2 nanosheets. This is possibly due to the fact that -F termination is replaced by O/OH termination on Ti3C2 after the hydrothermal treatment [31]. The chemical structure and oxidization states with respect to the series of as-prepared ZT0-ZT1.5 were further probed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The collected spectra of all the samples display characteristic stretching vibration modes at 1398 and 1063 cm−1, which can be ascribed to shifted thiocarbonyl of thioacetamide (Fig. S4) [32]. Besides, due to the high dispersion and low content (0.75 wt%) of Ti3C2 nanosheets, no diffraction peaks of Ti3C2 could be observed in ZT0.75. The broad absorption at ∼3435 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching mode of OH of intercalated water. The optical property of as-obtained photocatalysts was systematically characterized by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 5 a shows that the light-harvesting capability of ZT0.75 is appealing in the range of 200–350 nm. Nevertheless, the absorption intensity in the visible light region (λ > 400 nm) increases with the dosing of Ti3C2 in the composites due to the inherent absorption of Ti3C2 nanosheets. It is noted that all samples display an absorption peak at ca. 450 nm, implying favorable visible-light absorption performance. The band gap energy (Eg) of samples could be calculated by a modified Kubelka-Munk equation: (1) α hv = A ( hv - E g ) 2 where α is the absorption coefficient, hv is the photon energy, A is a constant and Eg is the band gap (eV) [33]. The Eg value of ZT0 and ZT0.75 can hence be estimated at approx. 3.35 and 3.29 eV, respectively (Fig. S5a). Obviously, a narrower Eg is observed for the hybrids due to the introduction of Ti3C2. The valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS) were further employed to probe the valence band potential (EVB) of ZT0 and ZT0.75 samples. As shown in Fig. S5b, the positions of VB of ZT0 and ZT0.75 are found to be at 2.25 and 1.29 eV vs NHE, respectively. By further utilizing the following equation [34]: (2) E CB = E VB - E g the conduction band potential (ECB) of ZT0 and ZT0.75 can be determined to be −1.10 and −2.00 eV vs NHE, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed to determine the total weight loss of our samples in terms of temperature change. Fig. 5b shows that an initial slight weight loss (1–2%) step occurs at around 250 °C, which could be ascribed to the evaporation of surface moisture. Subsequently, the mass of samples stays almost constant from 250 to 650 °C region. When the temperature reaches 800 °C, the weight loss of ZT0, ZT0.15 and ZT0.5 is ∼7%, whereas the weight loss of ZT0.75, ZT1 and ZT1.5 is ∼5%, which might be attributed to that a small quantity of Ti3C2 nanosheets conversed into titanium oxide [18]. Fig. 6 presents the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore-size distribution curves of ZT0-ZT1.5. These samples exhibit the similar IV-typed isotherms with a well-defined H3 hysteresis looping feature, demonstrating the presence of mesoporous structures (Fig. 6a). Calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method [35], ZT0.75 has the largest pore size (15.96 nm) and volume (0.18 cm3 g−1), stemming from the self-assembly process of Ti3C2 nanosheets to alter the surface morphology of ZnS. It is worth-noting that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area value of as-prepared samples decreases from 111.64 m2 g−1 to 54.48 m2 g−1 with the augmented dosage of Ti3C2 (from 0 to 1.5%) (Table S1). In particular, the BET surface area of ZT0.75 is 84.72 m2 g−1. Our results indicate that excessive Ti3C2 loading would reduce the specific surface area of hybrid due to the aggregation of Ti3C2 on the surface of ZnS. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore-size distribution curves (Fig. S6) of Ti3C2 nanosheets show that it is mesoporous structure. The photocatalytic H2 production activity of as-prepared samples (50 mg) was accordingly examined in 80 mL solution (lactic acid:water = 1:4; v:v) under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation. The hydrogen production rate of ZnS markedly improves upon the incorporation of Ti3C2 nanosheets. As displayed in Fig. 7 a, ZT0.75 achieves the highest hydrogen production yield of 502.6 μmol g−1 h−1, almost 4-fold as compared with that of bare ZnS. It is evident that ZT0.75 also outperforms most of other photocatalysts previously reported (Table S2). Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity of the hybrids shows retarded performance by further increasing the loading content of Ti3C2, possibly because of the blockage of surface-active sites and the loss of light absorption. Fig. 7b draws the comparison of H2 production rates between different catalysts. Firstly, in the absence of any photocatalyst, the system shows a nil H2 evolution under the identical photocatalytic condition, implying that only water and sacrificial agent possess no activity. Secondly, to verify whether a physical combination of Ti3C2 and ZnS would gain a profound H2 production, a simple mixture of the two components (ZTtwo) was used for the experiment. It can be observed that an H2 production rate of 326.6 μmol g−1 h−1 is realized. Of particular note, our designed ZT0.75 manifests a remarkable H2 production capability of 502.6 μmol g−1 h−1, much higher as compared with that of the ZTtwo sample. This indicates that the physical mixture would have a poor interface between Ti3C2 and ZnS, which is not beneficial to the synergetic effect mediated from the two components. Thirdly, ZnS/RGO (with 0.75 wt% graphene dosage) further exhibits lower photocatalytic performance of 404.2 μmol g−1 h−1, suggesting that the ultrathin MXene nanosheet indeed possess favorable capacity of charge shuttling in comparison with RGO. In this respect, the reproducibility and stability of H2 production by ZT0.75 were evaluated via cyclic photocatalytic experiments under the same reaction conditions. Fig. 7c displays that little deterioration of photocatalytic activity can be observed after five cycles. Post-mortem probing over the crystal structure also shows no apparent changes as compared to that before the cycling test (Fig. S7). Our results corroborate that the as-prepared ZT0.75 possesses superb photo-stability toward the photocatalytic H2 production. Moreover, comparative H2 production tests were carried out involving ZT0 and ZT0.75 catalysts without/with the presence of different types of scavengers such as lactic acid (LA), triethanolamine (TEOA), and methanol (MeOH) (Fig. 7 and S8). Evidently, LA as a sacrificial agent presents higher activity for H2 production than that of TEOA and MeOH. It is also noted that the H2 production rates of both ZT0 and ZT0.75 in the absence of any sacrificial agent are substantially declined, implying the key roles played by the sacrificial agents in the photocatalytic H2 evolution with regards to facilitating the charge separation and migration. Fig. 8 a manifests the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) profiles of ZT0 and ZT0.75 electrodes measured in 0.5 M NaSO4 with an AC potential of 10 mV. It is evident that a lower charge transfer resistance is registered for the ZT0.75 as compared with that of ZT0, revealing that the incorporation of Ti3C2 nanosheets with ZnS is beneficial to the charge shuttle [36]. In addition, ZT0.75 displays augmented transient photocurrent response (TPC) intensity in comparison with the ZT0 (Fig. 8b), corroborating that ZnS/Ti3C2 hybrid facilitates the separation of the photoinduced carriers [37]. The electrocatalytic H2 evolution activity of ZT0 and ZT0.75 was also measured by the linear sweep voltammetry. As shown in Fig. S9, ZT0.75 electrode shows a higher current density and a lower over-potential than that of ZT0 electrode during the whole polarization range. These investigations suggest that the ZnS/Ti3C2 hybrid possesses efficient charge transfer and separation efficiency at its interface, corresponding to an advanced photocatalytic performance. The optical properties of as-obtained photocatalysts were systematically characterized by room-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy (RT-PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TR-PL). RT-PL spectra of ZT0-ZT1.5 at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm show that the emission band of all the samples ranges from 425 to 650 nm (Fig. 8c). The emission intensity of the samples significantly decreases after the decoration of Ti3C2, where ZT0.75 presents the lowest PL intensity as compared with that of others. It is hence expected that ZT0.75 has a low electron-hole recombination rate, thereby corresponding to a higher PHE activity. Fig. 8d further shows the TR-PL spectra of ZT0 and ZT0.75 to check the charge transfer performance. The emission decay curves are fitted well with a double-exponential function and the decay time are shown in Table S3. It is evident that ZT0.75 displays an increased average lifetime (τ) as compared to ZT0, indicating that the in-situ decoration of Ti3C2 is beneficial to the effective charge transfer from ZnS to Ti3C2 nanosheets and prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers [38]. On the basis of the experimental results and the discussions aforementioned, a mechanism discussion with respect to the advanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity for ZnS/Ti3C2 is attempted in Scheme 1 . Upon sunlight irradiation, electrons are excited from the VB to the CB of ZnS, leaving the photo-induced holes in the VB [39,40]. The presence of ultrathin Ti3C2 nanosheets would aid to suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs by functioning as electron traps. On one side, owing to the tight interface generated in-situ between ZnS and Ti3C2, the CB electrons of ZnS can rapidly shuttle to the surface of Ti3C2 possessing excellent conductivity, thereby further reducing H+ to H2. On the other side, the holes accumulating at the VB of ZnS could react with the lactic acid solution."
8,Conclusions,"In conclusion, ZnS/Ti3C2 hybrids have been fabricated via a facile solvothermal method. The optimized ZT0.75 photocatalyst demonstrated a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rate (502.6 μmol g−1 h−1) upon solar irradiation as compared with that of bare ZnS (124.9 μmol g−1 h−1). The in-situ incorporation of 2D MXene Ti3C2 as an active co-catalyst has steadily led to a rapid charge shuttle, suppressed charge recombination rate, enhanced photocatalytic performance, and favorable photo-stability. Our study offers a new route toward the rational design of hybrid photocatalyst for innovative energy conversion and catalysis applications."
