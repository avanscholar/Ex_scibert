0,Introduction,"The production of liquid fuels and chemicals via the conversion of biomass resources is a promising way to relieve energy crisis caused by the depletion of petroleum storage [1,2]. Recently, lipid-based biomass is of great interest due to its ability to be transformed into sulfur-, nitrogen-free liquid fuels and oxygenated chemicals [3,4]. Biodiesel, converted from fatty acids or triglycerides through transesterification, is a potential alternative for liquid fuel because of its biodegradability and domestic availability [5,6]. However, compared with petroleum-based diesel fuel, the drawbacks such as higher viscosity, lower energy density and poorer chemical stability of biodiesel limit its use in diesel engines [7–9]. Thus, catalytic hydrogenation of natural oil derived fatty acids or esters to diesel-like alkanes or value-added fatty alcohols is a key process for lightening the burdens on fossil fuel marketing [10–14]. Additionally, fatty alcohols produced from natural lipids are valuable chemicals with high biodegradability. Together with their derivatives (alcohols, ketones and aldehydes), they are important sources for the manufacture of cosmetics and consumer chemicals [13,15,16]. Conventional sulfide metal (e.g., NiMo and CoMo sulfides) catalysts are widely used in hydroprocessing of triglycerides, vegetable oils or fats to liquid alkanes [17], but the problem of sulfur leaching makes the process less environmentally feasible [8,18]. Researchers have recently developed noble metal (e.g., Pt, Pd and Ru) catalysts, with high activity and stability in hydrodeoxygenation [19–21]. Besides, sulfur-free, non-noble metal (e.g., Ni, Co and Fe) catalysts are also preferable for hydrogenation of natural oils due to their low cost and high activity [22]. Lately, nickel-based catalysts showed excellent activity and selectivity for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of natural oils and fats [23,24]. Recent researches studied a series of nickel-based catalysts on the hydrogenation of fatty acids and microalgae oil into alkanes with high yield and selectivity [25–27]. However, Ni-based catalysts usually showed high deoxygenation activity of fatty acid at a relatively high temperature (≥260 °C), which probably led to undesired side reactions and coke formation. Cobalt, as a kind of low-cost transition metal, shows even higher activity than nickel for HDO reactions [28]. It is reported that Co supported on natural clay had remarkable selectivity in HDO of methyl oleate to n-octadecane (90%) [8]. Also, Co-doped MoO2/CNTs catalyst was highly active and stable for HDO of palmitic acid at a low temperature of 180 °C. Co ion could significantly improve the catalytic performance by incorporating into the MoO2 lattice [28]. Although there are some researches focusing on the hydrogenation of fatty acid to alcohol or alkanes over Co-based catalysts, the conversion of fatty acid to either alcohol or alkanes over Co-based catalyst with tunable selectivity is merely reported. On the other hand, the production of fatty alcohols is usually conducted under severe conditions (250–350 °C and 10–20 MPa) over commercial Cu-Cr-based catalysts [29]. Although a good selectivity of alcohol is obtained, the environmental risk by the use of Cr, severe conditions and high energy consumption make the process less attractive [30]. Thus, seeking for a low cost and environmentally benign catalyst for hydrogenation of biomass derived molecules into target products with high selectivity under mild conditions is pressingly required. Recently, researchers found that Co-based monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were active for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acid to related alcohol [31–35]. It was reported that magnetic-recoverable cobalt catalysts exhibited high selectivity to octadecanol (91.9%) from oleic acid hydrogenation. The co-existence of metallic Co and Coδ+ species might influence the performance for hydrogenation of oleic acid synergistically [36]. Song and co-workers reported the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to alcohols with high selectivity over cobalt oxide catalysts [37]. It was found that cobalt monoxide was the active phase for hydrogenation of carboxylic acids. Reducible metal oxide supports (WO3, TiO2, ZrO2, MoOx, etc.) are usually applied for hydrogenation of fatty acid because of their ability to activate carbonyl group by the oxygen vacancies [38]. Among the reducible metal oxide supports, zirconia has excellent redox properties, high thermal stability and resistance of carbon deposition due to the equilibrated amount of acidic (Zr4+–O2−) and basic (OH groups and adsorbed O2−) sites and abundant oxygen vacancies [39]. For the mechanism of fatty acid deoxygenation, the followings are proposed. The oxygen vacancies on ZrO2 support adsorbed the fatty acid and facilitated the activation of H2. Fatty acid was then converted into aldehyde via elimination of the oxygen atom to form a ketene species. Then the aldehyde intermediate was hydrogenated to fatty alcohol or decarbonylated into alkane with the incorporation of metal sites [25,40]. However, mechanistic aspects of the specific performance of both the metal and the oxygen vacancy sites on the selective deoxygenation of fatty acid to fatty alcohol and alkane need more understanding. Catalysts with low cost and controllable selectivity for target products are highly desirable for the conversion of bio-based molecules. Herein, we developed a novel and highly efficient catalytic system using Co/ZrO2 catalyst for the conversion of biodiesel derived ethyl palmitate to fatty alcohol or diesel-range alkanes with high tunable selectivity. This work offers an approach to produce value-added chemicals and liquid fuel from sustainable resources."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemicals were acquired commercially and used directly without further treatment: ethyl palmitate (damas-deta, ≥ 98%), 1-hexadecanol (TCI, ≥ 98%), palmitic acid (damas-beta, ≥ 98%), 2-ethylbutyric acid (TCI, ≥ 98%), n-decane (TCI, ≥ 99%), n-undecane (TCI, ≥ 99%), n-dodecane (TCI, ≥ 99%), n-tridecane (TCI, ≥ 99%), n-tetradecane (TCI, ≥ 99%), n-pentadecane (TCI, ≥ 99%), n-hexadecane (TCI, ≥ 99%), ZrOCl2·8H2O (damas-beta, ≥ 98%), Co(NO3)·6H2O(damas-beta, ≥ 99%) and heptane (KESHI, AR grade)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The schematic diagram of the catalyst preparation procedure was depicted in Scheme 1 . Cobalt supported on ZrO2 was prepared using incipient-wetness impregnation method. For the preparation of ZrO2 support, ZrOCl2·8H2O (30 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of ultrapure water. The precipitation of zirconia precursor was performed by adding ammonia solution at a pH of 9.5 under stirring. After stirring for another 1 h, the resultant was transferred into a pressurized bottle (250 mL) and maintained at 140 °C for 24 h. Afterwards, the mixture was filtered, and then the obtained solid fraction was washed with ultrapure water several times (to remove residual Cl−) until pH = 7, dried at 80 °C overnight and calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h. The as-prepared ZrO2 powder was impregnated by aqueous solution, with designed amount of Co(NO3)2 dissolved, followed by drying at 80 °C overnight and subsequently calcination in air at 600 °C for 4 h. Finally, the sample was reduced in a H2 flow (50 mL min−1) at 600 °C for 4 h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The metal loading of the catalyst was measured by an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, Spectro, Kleve, Germany). Before analysis, 10 mg of sample was dissolved in freshly prepared aqua regia and diluted to 100 mL with ultrapure water. The BET specific area of the sample was analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption at −196 °C using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 analyzer. Prior to analysis, 100 mg of sample was activated in vacuum at 300 °C for 2 h. The pore volume (Vp) and average pore diameter (Dp) of the samples were calculated using the BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) method. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), hydrogen chemisorption and desorption, and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia or carbon dioxide (NH3/CO2-TPD) of the samples were conducted by a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. For temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis, 100 mg of sample was heated in argon at 150 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 50 °C for pretreatment. Then the sample was reduced in a 10% hydrogen-argon gas mixture (50 mL min−1) with temperature ramping at 5 °C min−1 to 950 °C and maintained at 950 °C for another 10 min. For hydrogen chemisorption and desorption tests, the catalyst sample was pre-reduced in a 10% hydrogen-argon gas mixture at 500 °C for 1 h and subsequently purged by argon at 500 °C for another 1 h, followed by cooled down to 50 °C. The hydrogen chemisorption of the reduced sample was performed at 50 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the sample was purged with Ar (0.5 h) to remove the physisorbed hydrogen molecules. H2-TPD was conducted from 50 °C to 950 °C at 10 °C min−1 under argon atmosphere (50 mL min−1). For NH3/CO2-TPD test, the reduced catalyst was treated in He at 500 °C for 1 h. NH3 or CO2 was adsorbed at 100 or 50 °C for 1 h, respectively. Subsequently, the physisorbed ammonia or carbon dioxide was removed by helium. The TPD experiment was performed under He (25 mL min−1) from 100 to 600 °C or 50 to 500 °C with the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to desorb NH3 or CO2, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the samples was conducted by an Empyrean diffractometer (PANalytical B.V.) equipped with monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation. The XRD patterns were obtained over the scan range from 10 to 80° with the step size of 0.026°. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements were carried out on an Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer (Kratos, the United Kingdom) equipped with Al-Kα radiation. The binding energy of C 1 s peak was set to 284.6 eV for surface-charging corrections. Peak fitting of all spectra was conducted by fixing % Lorentzian-Gaussian to 20%. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution (HR) TEM images of the catalyst samples were acquired from a TECNAI G2-20 TWIN (FEI, German) equipment working at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and EDS analysis of catalyst samples were conducted on a JSM-7500F (JEOL, Japan) equipment equipped with a backscatter electron probe. Accelerating voltage: 0.1–30 kV. The contact angle tests were performed on a contact angle goniometer (Krüss, DSA30, Germany). The 1H NMR spectra of ethyl palmitate and liquid products obtained at different reaction temperature were measured by using a Bruker AVANCE-II 600 MHz spectrometer. The solvent of the product solution was removed by rotatory evaporation. The products were dissolved in CDCl3 (99.8%, with 0.03 v/v% DMS) for NMR analysis. The parameters of 1H NMR measurements were set in the following way: pulse program for acquisition, zg30; P1, 9.7 μs; PLW1, 18 W; AQ, 4.09 s; D1, 1.0 s; DS, 2; and NS, 16."
5,Hydrogenation process,"2.4 Hydrogenation process The catalytic performance tests for hydrogenation of ethyl palmitate (to be the model of biodiesel and natural triglycerides) and other substrates were carried out in a 50 mL autoclave reactor. Typically, reactant (0.2 g), catalyst (0.1 g), and solvent (heptane, 25 mL) were loaded into the autoclave and the inside atmosphere was replaced by hydrogen with initial pressure at 2 MPa. The stirring rate was set at 600 rpm. The reaction time was recorded when the reactor was heated to the designated temperature. Afterwards, the gas and liquid products were manually collected for further analysis. The used catalysts were recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration, and washed with 5 mL heptane for 6 times. Finally, the used catalysts were tested again for the ethyl palmitate hydrogenation reaction under the same reaction conditions."
6,Analysis method,"2.5 Analysis method The quantitative analysis of liquid products was conducted by a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, Fuli 9790). A DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was applied to separate different compounds. N2 was the carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1. The temperature program was set in the following way: from 100 to 250 °C ramped at 10 °C min−1, and hold at 250 °C for 10 min. The temperature of both injector and detector was kept at 280 °C. Besides, 2-ethylbutyric acid was used as the internal standard to quantify the amount of compounds in liquid products. The conversion of reactant, reaction rate and yields of products, as well as the turnover frequency (TOF, in units or moles reactant per mole of Co at the surface per hour, abbreviated to h−1) were calculated by the following equations: (1) c o n v e r s i o n % = 1 - m o l e s o f f i n a l r e a c t a n t m o l e s o f i n i t i a l r e a c t a n t × 100 % (2) y i e l d % = m o l e s o f e a c h p r o d u c t m o l e s o f i n i t i a l r e a c t a n t × 100 % (3) i n i t i a l r e a c t i o n r a t e m m o l g c a t - 1 h - 1 = m o l e s o f i n i t i a l r e a c t a n t - m o l e s o f f i n a l r e a c t a n t a t 0.5 h r e a c t i o n t i m e 0.5 h × m a s s o f c a t a l y s t (4) TOF h - 1 = i n i t i a l r e a c t i o n r a t e × m o l e c u l a r w e i g h t o f C o C o l o a d i n g × d i s p e r s i o n o f C o (5) d i s p e r s i o n o f C o % = 6.59 s a v e r a g e d i a m e t e r of C o The initial reaction rate and TOF were measured at the reaction time at 0.5 h, where dispersion of Co was calculated from the average cobalt diameter of catalysts estimated by TEM. In formula (5), s represented the site density in atoms nm−2, the value 6.59 was obtained from calculation by assuming spherical metal Co crystallites of uniform diameter, where s = 14.6 atoms nm−2 for supported cobalt crystallites (fcc) [41,42]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physicochemical properties,"3.1 Physicochemical properties Textural properties of the support and catalysts were displayed in Table 1 . The N2 adsorption isotherms of ZrO2 support and Co/ZrO2 catalysts (Fig. 1 ) were all type IV (IUPAC), pointing to typical mesoporous materials. The ZrO2 support had a relatively high BET surface area of 174.9 m2 g−1, pore volume of 0.35 cm3 g−1 and average pore diameter of 8.0 nm. The BET surface area and pore volume slightly increased after loading of 5 wt% of Co, and then decreased with the Co loading rising from 10 wt% to 20 wt%. However, the average pore diameter exhibited a different trend, which decreased to 7.6 nm with 5% Co loading but increased from 8.3 to 8.8 nm with further rise of Co loading. This was possibly due to the fact that the cobalt particles initially coated on the macropores, making the Dp decrease at first, while high loading of Co might block the small pores and then the average pore diameter increased. XRD patterns of ZrO2 support and calcined samples were displayed in Fig. 2 A. The support exhibited the pure tetragonal crystal phase of ZrO2 (JCPDS 80–2155, t-ZrO2), evidenced by the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30.3, 35.1, 50.4, 60.0 and 63.0°. Besides, the peaks ascribed to Co3O4 (JCPDS 42–1467) located at 19.0, 31.4, 36.9, 44.9, 59.4 and 65.3° could be clearly observed, the intensity of which increased with the rise of cobalt loading. Fig. 2B exhibited the XRD patterns of the reduced samples. The Co0 (1 1 1) peak at 44.2° was too weak to be identified for reduced Co/ZrO2 samples, whereas Co3O4 (3 1 1) lattice plane at 36.9° still existed in the reduced samples, but the peak intensity was much weaker compared with that of the calcined samples. This indicated that Co3O4 could not be reduced fully to Co0 in the reduction process, and the metallic cobalt was highly dispersed on the partly reduced Co/ZrO2 samples. After the catalysts were used, the intensity of the diffraction peak at 36.9° (Co3O4) further decreased and disappeared, while a weak peak at 42.4° represented the lattice plane of CoO (2 0 0) (JCPDS 43–1004) appeared, suggesting the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO during the reaction process. (Fig. 2C). Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was applied to analyze the reduction behavior of the calcined samples. From the XRD results above, Co species existed on the calcined samples prepared by impregnation method were typical of supported Co3O4. In Fig. S1, two characteristic reduction peaks of Co3O4 could be observed. The reduction peak at lower temperature (305–315 °C) was assigned to the transformation of Co3O4 to CoO, which exhibited higher reduction temperature than that of unsupported Co3O4 [43]. It was indicated that the interaction between Co3O4 and ZrO2 support made part of Co3O4 hard to be reduced. This supported the results in the XRD patterns. The latter reduction peak at 327 to 350 °C indicated the reduction of CoO to Co0 [43,44]. Besides, there existed some overlaps between the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, and CoO to Co0 especially with lower cobalt loading (i.e., 5 and 10 wt% Co). With higher Co loaded, the reduction temperature of CoO to metallic Co increased, and thus two distinct peaks appeared. According to Lukashuk et al. [45], the reduction of Co3O4 to Co0 tended to be a one-step process around 290 °C. However, the results of the present work exhibited some variations, probably due to the interaction between Co species and ZrO2. The acidity and basicity of ZrO2 and Co/ZrO2 were measured by the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2, respectively. The profiles of TPD results were depicted in Fig. 3 . In general, the NH3 desorption peak below 200 °C was ascribed to weak acid sites, and between 200 and 350 °C to moderate acid sites, while higher than 350 °C to strong acid sites [46]. Furthermore, the desorption peak of CO2 at 80–150 °C was assigned to weak basic sites (OH groups), and between 150 and 300 °C to moderate basic sites (Zr4+–O2− pairs), whereas higher than 300 °C to strong basic sites (adsorbed O2− species) [39,47,48]. Peak fitting of the profiles was conducted by Gaussian deconvolution method. As shown in Table 2 , the amount of acid and base sites of the support was nearly identical at 0.66 and 0.52 mmol gcat −1, respectively, demonstrating similar acidity and basicity of ZrO2. Besides, the moderate and strong acid sites, moderate and strong basic sites were mainly present on the ZrO2 support. After cobalt loaded, the concentration of both acid and base site increased at first with 5 wt% of Co loading and then gradually decreased as the Co content increased. This suggested that the loaded Co particles interacted and blocked both the acid and base sites (moderate and strong sites), making the site concentration go down. TEM images of reduced Co/ZrO2 samples were depicted in Fig. 4 and the particle size distribution of Co on different catalysts was shown in Fig. S2. Since the average particle diameter of t-ZrO2 was 9–11 nm from XRD results (Table 1), the relatively larger and irregular features on a lighter background in the images were assigned to the ZrO2 particles, while the much smaller and darker particles on the ZrO2 support were attributed to metallic Co particles. From the TEM micrographs, Co particles with spherical shape and narrow size distribution were observed, supporting a relative high dispersion of cobalt. Furthermore, the average particle diameter of Co increased from 4.7 to 6.3 nm with the rise of Co loading on Co/ZrO2 catalysts, resulting in a decrease in the dispersion of Co particles (Table 1). High resolution TEM micrograph of 15Co/ZrO2 (Fig. 4D) exhibited small crystalline clusters with lattice fringes of 0.186 nm, 0.301 nm and 0.267 nm, which were close to the Co (2 0 0), t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) and t-ZrO2 (0 0 2) planes on the Co/ZrO2 sample, respectively. Nevertheless, a small part of agglomerated particles was observed in Fig. 4E, which was due to the high loading of 20Co/ZrO2 sample (18.7 wt%). H2-TPD of the support and Co/ZrO2 catalysts was carried out to measure the active sites on the surface (Fig. 5 ). The intensive peak at 105 °C of the reduced ZrO2 support was attributed to the desorption of H2 of the formed Zr-H and ZrOH species [49,50]. Since the peak near 105 °C could also be assigned to H2 desorption from metallic cobalt [51], the peak observed near 105 °C on Co/ZrO2 could be attributed to H2 desorption from both Co and ZrO2 support, whereas the peak observed at 815 °C could be attributed to the adsorbed Hδ− from heterolytic dissociation of H2 on the coordinatively unsaturated Zr3+ and O2− ions in adjacent surface sites, forming Zr3+-Hδ− and Zr4+-O-Hδ+ species [18,52]. This peak could only be observed on the H2-TPD results of reduced Co/ZrO2 samples, and the intensity of which increased with the rise of cobalt loading. It was indicated that the loaded cobalt species could promote the reduction of ZrOH forming oxygen vacancies by more favorable H2 dissociative-adsorption and faster H migration [18,53]. Meanwhile, the Zr4+ in the ZrO2 lattice could be partially reduced to Zr3+, which might adsorb dissociated negatively charged Hδ− [18,52]. Thus, the increase in the peak intensity at 815 °C might be ascribed to growing amount of Zr3+ and oxygen vacancies on the ZrO2 support with the rise of cobalt loading. From the above results, H2-TPD was not suitable for measuring the amount of surface cobalt on ZrO2 support. The XPS results of ZrO2 support and Co/ZrO2 catalysts were illustrated in Fig. 6 and the details of binding energies and relative content for different species of Co, Zr and O were summarized in Table S1, Table S2 and Table S3, respectively. The Co 2p3/2 spectra were decomposed into three main peaks assigned to metallic Co (~778.3 eV), Co3+ (779.9 eV) and Co2+ (781.5 eV), and two shake-up satellites related to these species (~786 and 789 eV), respectively. The main state of surface Co was Co2+, which accounted for over 50% of the whole cobalt species (Table S1). The existence of Co2+ and Co3+ was ascribed to the unreduced Co3O4 or the oxidized-Co0 exposed in air, which further confirmed the above XRD results. Interestingly, the binding energy of Co0 2p3/2 for the 15 and 20Co/ZrO2 (777.8 eV) was lower than that of unsupported metallic Co (778.3 eV), suggesting the electron-rich metallic Co on these Co/ZrO2 catalysts. The Co nanoparticles were rich with negative charge because of the existence of oxygen vacancies of the partially reduced ZrO2 support. The Zr 3d spectra were fitted into two doublets related to Zr4+ of lattice ZrO2 (with Zr 3d5/2 BE = 182.1 eV and spin–orbit splitting 2.43 eV) and Zr3+ of oxygen-deficient phase from partial reduction of Zr4+ [54,55]. With the rise of Co loading, the content of Zr3+ species showed an upward trend with the rise of cobalt content (see Table S2). This demonstrated that the addition of cobalt to zirconia facilitated the reduction of the lattice phase to oxygen deficient phase [18], as confirmed by the H2-TPD results above. The O 1 s spectra of catalysts could be deconvoluted into two peaks with BE of 529.8 eV and 531.3 eV attributed to the oxygen of ZrO2 lattice and the surface oxygen species of Co-O and Zr-OH, respectively [18,56]. The relative content of lattice oxygen decreased whereas that of surface oxygen increased (Table S3). This further proved the existence and increase of oxygen vacancies of the Co/ZrO2 catalysts with the rise of Co content."
9,Catalytic performance of Co/ZrO2 on the hydrogenation of ethyl palmitate,"3.2 Catalytic performance of Co/ZrO2 on the hydrogenation of ethyl palmitate The contact angle measurement of ZrO2 support and Co/ZrO2 catalyst was conducted to test the dispersion capability of the catalysts in solvent (Fig. S3). The contact angles between heptane, and ZrO2 support and Co/ZrO2 catalyst were approximately 15°, suggesting good affinity of the catalysts and the heptane solvent. The catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl palmitate (EP) over ZrO2 and Co/ZrO2 with different Co loadings was performed at 240 °C with 2 MPa H2 in an autoclave (Table 3 ). Without Co loaded, the EP conversion over ZrO2 were low (12.5%), with only 0.2% of hexadecanol and 2.3% of palmitic acid formed. The reaction rate rose up from 2.1 to 7.6 mmol gcat −1h−1 with the increase of Co loading from 5% to 15%, but decreased to 4.9 mmol gcat −1h−1 when the Co loading was 20%. Similarly, the turnover frequency (TOF) of 15Co/ZrO2, calculated from the initial reaction rate and the amount of surface Co atoms, was the highest at 18.3 h−1 among the catalysts with different Co loadings. This was attributed to more active phases (e.g., Co atoms) being preferentially exposed with the increase of Co content. However, a drop in the conversion rate and TOF value could be seen on 20Co/ZrO2, resulting from the partly agglomeration of Co particles. In terms of the conversion of EP, 5Co/ZrO2 and 10Co/ZrO2 showed little deoxygenation ability. Few deoxygenation products (i.e., alkanes and alcohols) were obtained. With the increase of Co loading to 15%, n-heptadecane (54.3%), n-hexadecane (11.9%) and cracking alkanes (C10-C14, 15.5%) were the main products, while i-pentadecane (methyltetradecane) and palmityl palmitate contributed only small amounts. Additionally, slightly higher yields of alkanes were achieved over 20Co/ZrO2. The ZrO2 support had little effect on the conversion of EP without cobalt. However, significant increase of the conversion and deoxygenation efficiency could be observed with appropriate amount of Co loaded. The sudden rise in the deoxygenation ability for 15Co/ZrO2 might be attributed to the increase in the amount of surface Co and more active oxygen vacancies observed in XPS results (Fig. 5). It could be indicated that the catalytic activity for deoxygenation of EP was strongly affected by the cobalt loading, and there might be a threshold cobalt content between 10 and 15 wt% which was good for EP deoxygenation at 240 °C. Cobalt and ZrO2 support might have synergistic effect on the deoxygenation of EP by the metal-support interaction with each other to achieve a better dispersion of metal particles, and forming oxygen vacancies to adsorb the reactant molecules, finally resulting in high activity on deoxygenation. The low rate and TOF but high deoxygenation efficiency of 20Co/ZrO2 were probably due to the fact that the higher amount of surface Co and oxygen vacancies of ZrO2 (Table S4) on the catalyst than that of 15Co/ZrO2 showed better deoxygenation ability on the conversion of both reactant and reaction intermediates. Having identified 15Co/ZrO2 as the most active catalyst among the prepared in this work for deoxygenation of EP, the effect of reaction temperature on the conversion of EP was explored (see Fig. 7 ). The results indicated that the temperature facilitated the reaction and influenced the distribution of products. The conversion of EP increased from 33.8% to 100% by rising the reaction temperature from 180 to 220 °C and above. Palmitic acid was detected at 180 °C (3.2%), and then disappeared with the increase in temperature. The yield of hexadecanol grew up initially, reaching the maximum at 220 °C (65.3%), and then decreased dramatically and disappeared at 240 °C. The selectivity of hexadecanol was the highest at 200 °C, with only trace alkanes formed. In contrast, the concentration of pentadecane and hexadecane gradually increased with the rise of temperature to 240 °C, but decreased slightly from 240 to 260 °C. Besides, cracked alkanes (C10-C14) showed an upward trend over 180–260 °C. At 240 °C, a maximum yield of alkanes (81.7%) was obtained. The results above indicated that the hydrogenation of EP was a temperature-sensitive reaction: the formation of hexadecanol was favored at lower temperatures (e.g., 200–220 °C), while higher temperatures (e.g., ≥ 240 °C) promoted the deoxygenation of the oxygenates to alkanes, and the cracking of which generated shorter-chain alkanes. That is, the formation of 1-hexadecanol was faster than its further conversion below 240 °C. The 1H NMR spectra of EP and liquid products were displayed in Fig. 8 . The peaks at 0.88 ppm were assigned to H in –CH3 of the aliphatic chain, while the band at 1.05–1.46 ppm could be attributed to the proton in –CH2- group of the aliphatic chain or –CH3 of the ethyl group in EP. These peaks could be observed in all samples due to the existence of the protons in either substrate (EP) or products (1-hexadecanol or alkanes). Besides, the peaks between 1.5 and 1.7 ppm changed gradually with the increase of temperature. The intensity of the peak at 1.61 ppm ascribed to the Hβ in the aliphatic chain of EP went weak and finally disappeared at 220 °C, accompanied by the gradual appearance and disappearance of the peaks near 1.55 ppm assigned to –OH or Hβ in 1-hexadecanol with the increase of temperature. Also, the characteristic peaks of the Hα and the proton in –OCH2- (2.28 and 4.12 ppm) of EP disappeared gradually with the rise of reaction temperature, indicating the conversion of EP. It could be observed that the change in the peak at 3.63 ppm assigned to the Hα of 1-hexadecanol was also in accordance with the results in Fig. 7. In short, all the proton signals of 1H NMR spectra corresponded well with the product distribution in Fig. 7. Since a maximum yield of alkanes were obtained at 240 °C, the variation of reaction time on the conversion of EP at 240 °C was conducted and illustrated in Fig. 9 A. Initially, only a small amount of palmitic acid was formed at 1 h. As the reaction time increased, the amount of 1-hexadecanol gradually grew up and reached to the peak (62.5%) at 6 h. Subsequently, the yield of 1-hexadecanol declined and disappeared, accompanied by the fully conversion of EP at 8 h. The yields of hydrocarbons (pentadecane, hexadecane and cracking alkanes) increased slowly and continuously, reaching their peak at the reaction time of 8 h. It was implied that EP could be hydrogenated to 1-hexadecanol, then deoxygenated to hexadecane and pentadecane, or hydrolyzed to palmitic acid. Besides, ethanol obtained from hydrogenolysis of ester was detected in the liquid products. Except for H2, only CH4 was detected in the gaseous phase, which was formed by the methanation of CO and CO2 with H2 or the cracking of C15/C16 alkanes [25]. The recyclability test of 15Co/ZrO2 for the conversion of EP were performed at identical condition (240 °C, 8 h) (Fig. 10 A). After each run, the catalyst was filtrated and washed with solvent for several times. The results showed that there was almost no change in the conversion of EP and slight increase in the yield of alkanes within three runs, indicating the stability of the catalysts. The slight increase of the alkanes yield could be attributed to the deposition of some high boiling point products remaining on the recycled catalyst surface. In the recycling experiments, the high boiling point products would be dissolved in solvents because of the high reaction temperature (240 °C), which would lead to the slight increase of alkane yield. Based on the XPS characterization of recycled catalyst, it was shown that the relative content of Co2+ species showed an upward trend after the recyclability test, while that of Co3+ species decreased (Fig. 10B and Table S5), which could also be observed in XRD results (Fig. 2C). Besides, the relative content of Zr3+ species of the recycled catalyst increased, accompanied by the decrease in the relative content of Zr4+ species (Fig. 10C and Table S6). This indicated the Co3+ and Zr4+ was gradually reduced to Co2+ and Zr3+ during each reaction process. As shown in Fig. 10D, slight agglomeration of the recycled catalysts could be observed in the TEM image, making the average particle size of Co increase from 5.5 nm (fresh) to 6.5 (recycled) (Fig. S4). Additionally, the recycled catalyst showed no significant change from SEM images and the corresponding element mapping compared with fresh 15Co/ZrO2 (Fig. 10E and F). However, the relative content of C rise from 7.14 wt% (fresh 15Co/ZrO2) to 12.86 wt% (recycled 15Co/ZrO2), as shown in the EDS results (Fig. S5 and Table S7), which suggested that some carbon species were deposited on the catalyst surface after recyclability test [57]. The increase in carbon content could be ascribed to the deposition of the high boiling point products, which was in accordance with the activity results in Fig. 10A. In short, slight reduction and agglomeration of the catalyst could be observed after the recycling experiments, but this seemed to have little influence on the catalytic activity. On the basis of the above results, it was found that high selectivity to hexadecanol was obtained at 200 and 220 °C on 15Co/ZrO2. To obtain fatty alcohol with a higher yield and selectivity, optimizations of reaction time at 220 and 200 °C were conducted (Fig. 9B and C and Table S8). At 200 °C (Fig. 9C), palmitic acid was formed with quite low yield initially, and subsequently decreased and disappeared at 8 h. The yield of 1-hexadecanol continued to grow with increase of reaction time, achieving a maximum yield at 85.7% with the time of 24 h. However, hydrocarbons remained at a very low level (<5%), ascribed to the low reaction temperature. The hydrogenation behavior of EP at 220 °C (Fig. 9B) exhibited a similar trend compared with that at 200 °C, with higher yield to hydrocarbons (18.7%) but lower to alcohol (65.3%). The results demonstrated that 200 °C was a favorable temperature for hydrogenation of EP to get 1-hexadecanol with high selectivity."
10,Mechanism of ethyl palmitate deoxygenation,"3.3 Mechanism of ethyl palmitate deoxygenation 3.3.1 Reaction network To understand the reaction network of ethyl palmitate deoxygenation, 1-hexadecanol was used as a substrate over 15Co/ZrO2 at 240 °C (Fig. 11 A). Mixtures of pentadecane, hexadecane, cracking alkanes were obtained as the products. Only small amount of hexadecanal (<1%) was detected within the reaction time of 30 min. The full conversion of 1-hexadecanol only required<2 h. After 2 h, the yields of alkanes increased slowly, reaching the maximum at 69.0%, 14.1% and 9.8% with the reaction time of 8 h for pentadecane, hexadecane and cracking alkanes, respectively (total yield of alkanes, 93%). The higher yields compared to that obtained from conversion of EP were ascribed to the transesterification of EP and 1-hexadeanol to form palmityl palmitate. Hexadecane was formed through dehydration-hydrogenation of hexadecanol (hexadecanol → hexadecene → hexadecane), while the existence of pentadecane and small concentration of hexadecanal suggested the dehydrogenation of hexadecanol and decarbonylation (DCO) of the formed aldehyde (hexadecanol → hexadecanal → pentadecane). To further confirm these steps, the hydrogenation of hexadecanal was performed (Fig. 11B). It was observed that hexadecanal was easily converted into hexadecanol (major product) even at low temperatures (e.g., 180 °C), whereas only a small amount of pentadecane and hexadecane was formed at the same time. Pentadecane was formed with higher yield compared with hexadecane, which indicated that decarbonylation of aldehyde was the major route for alkane formation. The decrease in the amount of hexadecanol accompanied by a slight rise in the yield of hexadecane suggested that the dehydration-hydrogenation of hexadecanol occurred. The ratio of C15/C16 alkane obtained from deoxygenation of hexadecanol was close to that obtained from deoxygenation of EP, which meant that 1-hexadecanol obtained from hydrogenation of EP went through dehydrogenation-hydrogenation followed by DCO route to form C15 alkane or HDO route to form C16 alkanes. From the results above, it was concluded that the main reaction pathway (see Scheme 2 ) for ethyl palmitate hydrogenation over Co/ZrO2 proceeded initially via hydrogenation of ester by cleavage of the C-O bond to aldehyde (in equilibrium with alcohol) and ethanol, followed by the DCO of the formed aldehyde to pentadecane and CO (major route). Also, the obtained alcohol could go through the dehydration-hydrogenation route to form hexadecane, which was in parallel to DCO. The reaction temperature strongly influenced the selectivity of the reaction. Lower temperatures (below 220 °C) only yielded alcohol as the main product, which showed the high hydrogenation ability but low activity for C–C scission. At higher temperatures (e.g., 240 °C), alkanes were the main products, suggesting higher activity on C–C and C-O bonds cleavage over the catalyst. The reason why lower temperature inhibited the formation of alkanes was kinetically explained by the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the two steps (Fig. S6). The Ea for the conversion of EP was lower than that of hexadecanol. Therefore, more energy was needed in the latter step, resulting in the requirement of higher temperature for the formation of alkanes. Moreover, shorter-chain alkanes were produced from the cracking of C15/C16 alkanes by the Lewis acid site of ZrO2. The fatty ester could also be hydrolyzed with the formed water to obtained small amount of palmitic acid, which further went through the deoxygenation route. CO, CO2 and H2 underwent methanation forming water and methane. The latter could be directly used as gas fuel or for further conversion. The abundant concentration of CH4 in the gaseous phase pointed that Co/ZrO2 was also suitable for hydrogenation of CO and CO2. 3.3.2 Synergistic effect of Co and t-ZrO2 support The results of XPS analysis showed the existence of oxygen vacancies on the ZrO2 surface. The formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide support helped the activation of the reactant molecules such as H2, CO2 and fatty acid, and stabilization of the reaction intermediate [18,58,59]. Also, it was proved by DFT study that Co/ZrO2 catalysts showed high promotion effect of H2 adsorption- dissociation, and faster hydrogen transfer on the catalyst surface [53]. Therefore, the mechanism for the deoxygenation of EP synergistically catalyzed by the Co and ZrO2 was proposed (Scheme 3 ). In the catalyst surface, H2 was dissociated into two H atoms to be adsorbed on Co site, and then migrated to Zr3+ site (see H2-TPD results) [52]. Initially, ethyl palmitate could be adsorbed at the oxygen vacancy forming carboxylate intermediate (I1). The -OC2H5 group was removed by the subsequent H atom attack to break C-O bond, yielding η(C)-acyl species (I2) and ethanol [60]. The acyl intermediate on the active center could be further converted via two parallel ways: one way was hydrodeoxygenation into alcohol via the formation of an aldehyde intermediate (I3); the other way was activation of β-C–H bond (I4) of the acyl intermediate (I2), followed by C–C cleavage to produce CO and alkane moieties, and then hydrogenation to produce Cn-1 alkane [61]. Since the apparent activation energy (Ea) for the conversion of hexadecanol was far higher than that of EP (Fig. S6), the C–C cleavage might need higher energy [62], thus higher reaction temperature was needed for decarbonylation of aldehyde to produce Cn-1 alkane."
11,Conclusions,"Overall, a catalytic system for transformation of ethyl palmitate to alkanes or fatty alcohol with temperature-tuned selectivity was developed over zirconia supported cobalt catalyst. The activity of Co/ZrO2 catalysts depended on proportion of the exposed metallic cobalt atoms and the amount of oxygen vacancies on ZrO2 support. The selectivity to alkanes or alcohol could be controlled by varying reaction temperature. Over 15Co/ZrO2, the highest yield of alkanes (~82%, including pentadecane, hexadecane and cracking alkanes) was achieved at 240 °C, 8 h, 2 MPa H2, while 1-hexadecanol with the highest yield of 85.7% was obtained at 200 °C, 24 h, 2 MPa H2. The dominant route for the deoxygenation of fatty ester to alkanes on Co/ZrO2 was decarbonylation (DCO), whereas small fraction of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and cracking also existed. Furthermore, a decrease in hydrogenation temperature blocked the DCO and HDO processes, generating the fatty alcohol intermediate with high yield and selectivity. Co and ZrO2 catalyzed the deoxygenation of fatty ester synergistically. Acyl intermediate was formed from the fatty ester at the oxygen vacancy site of ZrO2 together with the assistance of Co site. C16 alcohol and Cn-1 alkane were generated via two parallel pathways: hydrodeoxygenation on the oxygen vacancy site and decarbonylation on the Co site, respectively."
