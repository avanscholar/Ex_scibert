0,Introduction,"Conventional energy resources such as coal, petroleum products, etc., which are being used to meet most of the world's energy requirements, have been depleted to a great extent. Driven by the need for cleaner air and reduced oil dependence, the interest in alternative fuels for energy production has increased rapidly in recent years. H2 has been identified as a potentially important energy vector. It is used extensively as fuel because it produces a high energy yield (122 kJ g−1), is pollution free and is easily storable. H2 is typically obtained from petroleum and natural gas steam reforming, a process which is not sustainable in the long term and merely displaces the ultimate source of energy to a different point in the value chain. In recent years, much attention has been paid to develop other approaches to produce H2 from renewable resources to avoid the production of greenhouse gases by fossil fuels. Photocatalytic water-splitting using TiO2 for hydrogen production offers a promising alternative to produce hydrogen by solar energy [1–6] due to its favourable electronic energy band structure and its high photo-chemical stability. Nano-sized TiO2 photocatalytic water-splitting technology has great potential for low-cost, environmentally friendly solar-hydrogen production to support the future hydrogen economy [7,8]. Presently, solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency is too low for the technology to be economically sound. The main barriers are the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs as well as backward reaction and the poor activation of TiO2 by visible light. Direct splitting of water into H2 and O2 has a very low efficiency due to rapid reverse reaction and higher hydrogen production can be obtained by addition of “sacrificial reagents,” which act like reducing agents that facilitate water reduction by the photoelectrons from the conduction band [9,10]. These substances are oxidized to products that are less reactive toward hydrogen. In addition, as it is not generated in the medium, the reduction reaction of O2 which competes with the reduction of water is inhibited. It is therefore of interest to combine photocatalytic production of hydrogen with degradation of pollutants to achieve cost-efficient and sustainable processes. Methanol is a volatile organic compound (VOCs) widely used as an industrial solvent and a reagent to prepare a vast variety of chemicals. Methanol achieves a toxic level of concentration in the air at room temperature and overexposure leads to nausea, loss of coordination and somnolence [11]. Its use as a sacrificial agent in hydrogen production reaction serves a double purpose: (1) H2 production is considerably increased, and (2) as a result of the methanol degradation that occurs in the process, this harmful material is decomposed/mineralized into less toxic substances. The photocatalysts prepared for the present study were synthesized with a sol–gel method which was followed by either hydrothermal treatment or a simple heat-soaking calcination process. The synthesis routes were based on minor modifications of a previously described route [12]. The photoactivity of these materials was tested against hydrogen production and compared with that obtained from the commercial photocatalysts Millenium PC50 (ML), Hombikat UV100 (HB), Kronos vlp7000 (KR), Degussa P25 (DP) and Kemira 650 (KM). The aim was to establish a criterion for the selection of TiO2 which could then be modified in future studies to increase photoactivity."
1,Experimental,
2,Equipment and methods,"2.1 Equipment and methods BET surface area, pore volume and pore size measurements were carried out by N2 adsorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics 2010 instrument. XRD patterns were recorded on a Siemens D-501 diffractometer equipped with a Ni filter and graphite monochromator using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) to determine phase composition of the samples. Crystal sizes were estimated from line broadening of the corresponding X-ray diffraction peaks by using the Scherrer equation. UV–Vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 5 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere using PTFE (poly-tetra-fluoroethylene) as reference to study light absorption properties of the samples. Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded and band-gaps were calculated by the Kubelka-Munk function, according to the Tandon-Gupta method [13]. The morphology of the samples was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Zeiss EM 910 instrument equipped with a ProScan slow-scan CCD Camera and Soft Imaging System software. The structural characteristics and phase composition of the samples were also investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) green laser (λ = 532 nm) as excitation source. The laser beam was focused onto the samples by means of a 10 × 0.25 BD lens, while the laser power density was kept at low levels (5 mW μm−2) to avoid local heating of the samples. For FTIR experiments, a Nicolet iS10 spectrophotometer with DTGS detector was used. Operating parameters were: intervals of 4000–1000 cm−1, a 4 cm−1 resolution with 32 scans and a mirror velocity of 0.6329 cm s−1. These analyses were performed by placing films of the photocatalysts between two CaF2 windows. Aggregate size distribution in aqueous suspension was determined through measurements with a Beckman Coulter LS 13 320 instrument. The apparent quantum efficiencies (QEs) were calculated following J. Yu et al. [14]. An Ocean Optics HR2000 + spectrometer was used for the measurement of incident photons in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm."
3,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.2 Photocatalytic experiments A critical ingredient of any photocatalytic experiment is the light source. This must be clearly established in order for other experiments to be comparable. In our case, the light source was a set of two Solarium Philips HB175 lamps, each equipped with 4 15W Philips CLEO florescent tubes. Emission spectrum was 300–400 nm with a maximum peak at 365 nm. The lamps were externally arranged around the reactor tube in such a way that the incident photon flux was maximized. The photoreactor was a home-made design with200 mL of aqueous suspension containing 25% methanol and a photocatalyst concentration of 1 g L−1. The pH value of the aqueous suspension was set to 5 by means of an NaOH solution. The photoreactor was operated in continuous mode by using N2 as inert “dragging” gas (3.8 mL min−1), at 1 bar and room temperature. This nitrogen flow, controlled with mass-flow measurement systems, was used to displace the hydrogen produced by photo-splitting from the photoreactor headspace towards the GC measuring system. Hydrogen production was monitored for 8 h through analysis in a gas chromatograph (Varian 3600) equipped with an injection valve (VALCO type), a Molsieve5A column and a TCD detector. Chromatography peak areas were converted into hydrogen flux measurements through a previously obtained calibration line, recorded under the same conditions. Final mineralization degree and pH were measured by means of a Crison Basic20 pH-meter and a ShimadzuTOC-VCSN Total Organic Carbon analyser. Suspension concentrations of formaldehyde and formic acid were quantitatively measured by spectrophotometry [15,16]."
4,Photocatalyst synthesis and preparation,"2.3 Photocatalyst synthesis and preparation The photocatalysts were synthesized following a sol–gel procedure based on a previous work of the authors [12]. A mixture of ethanol and titaniumtert-butoxide in molar relation 50:3.5 was released drop-by-drop onto an ethanol-water mixture with 9.83 × 10−2 M citric acid. The suspension was then stirred for 30 min and kept in the dark for a period of 48 h. The photocatalyst was then dried at 105 °C for 24 h. After this ageing and drying treatment, the dry powder was sieved through a 63 μm mesh. As a final step, various batches were separated from the raw powder and subjected to 3 h of calcination at a variety of temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 900 °C. A 2 °C·min−1 heating ramp was programmed. The resulting photocatalysts were designated as SGx, where x is the calcination temperature. Another set of batches from the raw powder was subjected not to calcination but to a mild hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 24 h. The photocatalyst obtained in this way was designated HT."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"XRD, Raman, BET and diffuse reflectance","3.1 XRD, Raman, BET and diffuse reflectance Table 1 shows the characterization results of the home-made and commercial photocatalysts used for this study. Anatase and rutile were the only detected phases, with no trace of brookite found. The majority of the commercial photocatalysts used in this study consisted entirely of anatase phase, except for the DP (anatase:rutile, 80:20) and KM (100% rutile). In terms of surface properties, KR and HB had similar surface areas, and were the largest among those measured:259 and 202 m2 g−1,respectively. Another similarity between these photocatalysts was the anatase phase crystal size, below 10 nm in both cases, although slightly smaller for the KR (7 nm). One should bear in mind that KR is a commercially available carbon-doped photocatalyst, typically displaying 0.4–0.8% (by weight) elemental carbon at the surface, according to the corresponding patent [17]. The measured band-gap in this study was 3.24 eV, essentially similar to that of HB. This seems to indicate that surface carbon is not modifying the gap. However, an improvement in higher-wavelength absorption for the carbon-doped KR photocatalyst was detected. Again following the statements in the maker's patent, the 500 nm and 600 nmKubelka-Munkfunction (F(R ∞ )) are 50% and 20%of its value at 400 nm, respectively. In the case of ML and DP, despite ML being 100% anatase and DP an 80:20 anatase:rutile mixture, both photocatalysts display similarities:the specific surface area is smaller than those for KR and HB (and in the same order of magnitude for both photocatalysts), and anatase crystal size is 21 and 23 nm, respectively. As for the home-made photocatalysts, specifically the SGx series synthesized through the sol–gel technique followed by calcination, increased calcination temperature led as expected to reduced specific surface area, reduced proportion of the anatase phase, and increased crystal size in both the anatase and rutile phases. Initial specific surface area was 390 m2 g−1, and the strongest reduction of close to 85% occurred with calcination at 400 °C. Higher temperatures led to slower reductions in surface area. The photocatalyst sample synthesized and calcined at 900 °C had a specific surface area close to1.0 m2 g−1. However, the hydrothermal treatment did not entail such a dramatic reduction in surface area: the specific surface area of the hydrothermally treated sample, the HT photocatalyst,was224.2 m2 g−1. XRD analysis showed that synthesis gave rise to an amorphous phase that crystallized after thermal treatment. Anatase crystallinity increased with temperature and the average crystallite size also increased, from 13 nm to 38 nm at 650 °C. At this temperature, a small amount of rutile (4%) began to appear along with the main anatase phase. The value of this rutile-inception temperature is consistent with the so-called rutilization temperatures, which have been observed and reported in the literature for TiO2-based photocatalysts synthesized in the absence of organic/inorganic inhibitors or additives which promote and stabilize one or the other phase [18,19]. It was detected that an increase in calcination temperature correlated to increased percentage of rutile phase. This percentage increased steadily until reaching 94% at 800 °C and 100% at 900 °C. In contrast, the hydrothermal sample maintained a 100% anatase composition and the smallest crystal size of all synthesized samples (6 nm). These characteristics, together with a large surface area, represent similarities between our HT photocatalyst and the commercial KR. However, although hydrothermal treatment is intended to achieve higher crystallinity at lower temperatures and with smaller particle size, without detrimental effects upon the specific surface area values [20], crystallinity (for the achieved particle size) is still low when compared to the KR material, according to the (101) anatase diffraction peak intensities (I[101]KR/I[101]HT = 1.61). The phase composition of the photocatalysts was also qualitatively investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 A shows the Raman spectra of SGx and HT photocatalysts at 532 nm. It can be seen that samples HT and SGx (up to 650 °C) exhibit the characteristic Raman-active phonons of the anatase TiO2phase, at approximately 144 (E g ), 197 (E g ), 396 (B 1g ), 516 (A 1g + B 1g ), and 638 cm−1 (E g ) [21]. The intensity of the bands corresponding to the anatase phase increased with calcination temperature and with crystal size, showing good linear correlation with the XRD-calculated crystal size (Fig. 1B). It is further noted, for the SGx series, that the shift and width of the E g anatase mode at 144 cm−1 varies with the anatase crystal size (Fig. 1C). The frequency shift fell linearly up to anatase sizes of 45 nm. Above this crystal size, there was no measurable modification. Peak broadening fell rapidly until crystal sizes of around 33 nm, while for larger sizes the rate of decrease was less pronounced. It can be seen that photocatalyst SG700 marks the border where both frequency shift and peak broadening cease to occur. At 700 °C, along with the anatase bands, a weaker contribution of the most intense rutile modes is observable at ∼445 (E g ) and 610 cm−1 (A 1g) [22]. In addition, even at 900 °C, the peak anatase vibrational mode at 144 cm−1 can be detected, although with a reduced intensity. It is therefore concluded that minor discrepancies exist in a routine application of the Raman and XRD techniques, most notably for the SGx series. Raman spectroscopy seems more sensitive to the anatase phase and less sensitive to the rutile phase, as evidenced by the lack of Raman detection of rutile until temperatures equal to or above 700 °C, whereas XRD shows the appearance of rutile from 650 °C. In addition, Raman spectroscopy still shows some traces of anatase in the SG900 sample, while XRD solely identifies rutile. It should be mentioned that Raman spectroscopic techniques for crystal-composition analysis of TiO2-based photocatalyst powder samples have been applied in the literature only in a qualitative or semi-quantitative sense: in the end, any attempt to perform quantitative analysis ultimately relies upon XRD-based reference standards [23–25]. Table 1 shows bandgap values for both the commercial and the synthesized photocatalysts. These values are in agreement with both, the evolution of phase ratio and the crystalline size. Note that the SG series starts with a high bandgap (3.4 eV) and, as crystallization proceeds, the value stabilizes around the well-known 3.2 eV (for pure anatase photocatalysts). This value is consistent with those of the 100% anatase commercial samples. Once the rutile phase starts to appear at higher calcination temperatures, a decrease in the bandgap is observed down to 2.98 eV for the SG900 photocatalyst, which is similar to the 100% rutile KM (3.0 eV). These values are consistent with published results for both anatase and rutile (3.23 eV and 3.02 eV, respectively) [26–28].It can be predicted that mixed photocatalysts, with anatase-rutile mixtures, will show intermediate bandgap values. The HT photocatalyst shows a bandgap that is similar to those of the SG700 and SG750, a fact that can be attributed to the smaller crystalline sizes and, therefore, larger discretization of the energy levels [29]. With respect to average pore volumes (Table 1), the SGx series starts with an average value of 0.608 cm3 g−1, which then abruptly falls to 0.344 cm3 g−1 at 400 °C calcination. It is noticeable that the decrease in pore volume is larger when the hydrothermal treatment is applied (hydrothermal samples show a pore volume similar to that of the SG500). Pore volumes fell with calcination temperature, reaching minimum values below 0.1 cm3 g−1 for temperatures above 700 °C. Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the home-made TiO2 photocatalysts. The isotherm corresponding to the HT sample is of type IV according to the IUPAC classification [30]. The existence of microporosity (<2 nm pore diameter) is demonstrated at low relative pressures (P/P o) due to the relatively high values of nitrogen adsorbed volume. Additionally, a hysteresis loop (type 2) is observed in the relative pressure range of 0.4–0.8 with a sloping adsorption branch and a sharp desorption branch indicating a wide distribution of “ink-bottle” type pores, in other words pores with narrow necks and wider bodies. In the case of the SGx series, it is more difficult to unequivocally identify the adsorption/desorption curves with one of the types as determined in the IUPAC. The SG sample isotherm could be associated with a combination of types I and IV. At low relative pressure the isotherm displays a high adsorption volume indicating the presence of microporosity in the photocatalyst, while at high relative pressures the presence of a hysteresis loop is observed which shows mesoporosity [31]. The shape of the hysteresis loop is of the type H3 which corresponds to slit-shaped pores. The calcined samples of the SGx series could present a type III isotherm corresponding to little developed pore structures. However, a hysteresis loop is observed, the start of which moves at higher relative pressures as the calcination temperature rises. The area of the hysteresis loop gets smaller and smaller and the isotherms are less and less significant suggesting the collapse of mesoporosity. Fig. 3 shows the pore size distribution estimated from the adsorption–desorption isotherms for different samples. In the SGx series, despite the consistent pore volume reduction, it can be seen that the first samples in the series maintain a most probable pore diameter of 3.5 nm, which is slightly smaller than that measured for the HT photocatalyst sample (4.0 nm). A comparison with the commercial photocatalysts revealed that the largest pore volume corresponded to the KR sample, yielding 0.392 cm3 g−1, closely followed by HB and ML. Average pore volume for the DP sample was half that value. The KM photocatalyst sample showed negligible porosity, a feature shared with the SGx photocatalysts which exhibited a high rutile percentage (SG800and SG900). Note that the KR and HB photocatalyst samples displayed a narrow pore size distribution, with a most probable pore diameter of around 3.3 nm. By contrast, the distributions for ML and DP are not so narrow, with 7.4 nm and 2.5 nm as most probable pore diameters, respectively."
7,TEM characterization studies,"3.2 TEM characterization studies Fig. 4 shows TEM images of some of the synthesized photocatalysts. For the SGx series, a progressive increase in particle size with calcination temperature is observable. For the HT sample and the low temperature SGx samples (below 600 °C), the particles are almost spherical in shape, and their size concurs with the XRD data. For higher temperatures, however, particle size distribution becomes increasingly heterogeneous, and a higher crystallinity structure is clearly observed (e.g. at 700 °C). What can be seen is the thermodynamically stable anatase shape: a truncated square bipyramidal morphology with a square base in which the exposed surface faces are mainly (101) and (001) [32–34]. With calcination temperatures of 750 °C and above, this morphology dominates, with a return to an increased homogeneity in particle size, in good agreement with XRD results. Although the images of the commercial photocatalysts are not presented in this study, all of them displayed spherical morphology, and the sequence in their particle sizes was consistent with the XRD measurements, as can be seen in Table 1. In particular, HB and KR showed rather small particle sizes, followed by DP and ML and, finally, KM."
8,Aggregate size,"3.3 Aggregate size Fig. 5 shows aggregate size distribution for some of the photocatalysts synthesized in this work. It can be seen that the most probable diameter for the aggregates throughout the SGx series is close to 40 μm. The distribution narrows around this value with increasing temperatures, up to a calcination temperature of 700 °C. From SG750, sample in which the presence of rutile is considerable (34%), a widening of the distribution and larger dispersion of aggregate sizes can be seen again. Note that the HT photocatalyst sample shows a distribution which is very similar to that of SG400. In terms of aggregate size distribution for the commercial photocatalysts used in this study, Fig. 6 shows a trend to smaller sizes (when compared to our photocatalysts), with typical aggregate diameters ranging from 0.8 μm for KM samples up to 4.5 μm for DP samples. Note that the sizes remain below 30 μm, with the exception of the HB sample. The HB photocatalyst shows a bimodal distribution, with a first set of aggregates averaging around 1–2 μm, and another set around 60 μm. The larger average aggregate size of our photocatalysts, when compared to the commercial samples used in this study, is clearly advantageous, conferring a higher sedimentation speed and facilitating separation from any reaction suspension: the home-made photocatalysts are easier to separate from the reaction media in the final post-treatment step after the photocatalytic reaction."
9,FTIR spectra,"3.4 FTIR spectra A critical factor in the physicochemical behaviour of TiO2-based photocatalysts is the nature and spatial distribution of surface hydroxyl groups [35–37]. These active groups act, on the one hand, as adsorption centres for additives, intermediates, and/or products, promoting stronger and faster adsorption. Additionally, the surface hydroxyl groups are precursors of hydroxyl radicals, which are in turn responsible for the processes of oxidative photodegradation. A number of studies have shown that analysing surface distribution of hydroxyl groups provides relevant clues to the morphology and, specifically, the faceting of the TiO2 particles [33]. For example, in the (001) crystal face of the anatase phase [32,34], two distinctive hydroxyl bands are observable: (1) one attributed to isolated hydroxyls, which can be detected at larger wavenumbers (3698 cm−1); and (2) another band that correlates to hydroxyl groups placed in equilibrium positions close to each other, which emerges at shorter wavenumbers (3660 or 3675 cm−1). Isolated hydroxyls have been related to surface defects or oxygen vacancies [38]. Along with these features, a wide band lying between 3690 and 3000 cm−1 can be attributed to undissociated water molecules, adsorbed onto the (101) crystal face through hydrogen bonds or Ti4+cations [33,39,40]. In order to compare surface distribution of hydroxyl groups corresponding to the different photocatalysts synthesized here, as well as the commercial samples, Fig. 7 shows the corresponding FTIR spectra measured in the range 4000–1000 cm−1. In all the commercial photocatalysts, the so-called water-band can be seen at 1640 cm−1. In addition, a wide band in the range 3690–3000 cm−1 is apparent, and can be attributed to aggregated (not isolated) hydroxyl groups, or to the presence of adsorbed water molecules. The higher wavenumber band corresponding to isolated hydroxyl groups (3698 cm−1) can only be observed in the cases of the DP and ML samples. For the home-made photocatalysts, the sample corresponding to the SG series shows downwards shifted bands, due to some organic precursor residues (used during synthesis) at the surface. These bands disappear upon calcination although a new band appears that is attributable to adsorbed CO2 (2350 cm−1) [41,42] and which remains until 650 °C calcination temperature. The hydrothermally treated sample, HT, also shows bands that can be associated with organic residues, although not with carbonates. All samples analysed in the SGx series that included post-treatment calcination exhibited all three typical bands: the water-band, the non-isolated (vicinal) hydroxyls, and the isolated hydroxyls; this agrees with the morphology observed by TEM images. Note, however, that the hydrothermal sample lacks the isolated hydroxyl band, which could indicate a smaller amount of surface defects or oxygen vacancies when compared with the SGx series."
10,Photoactivity,"3.5 Photoactivity Methanol was selected as sacrificial reagent due to its well-documented record of good results [4,5,43]. In addition, methanol results in greater efficiency when compared with other compounds [44]. In a water-alcohol mixture, methanol is a satisfactory hole-scavenger and, in addition, it undergoes a relatively rapid and irreversible oxidation. This allows for a direct reaction mechanism, with oxidation taking place directly through the photogenerated holes, instead of forcing an intermediate step with hydroxyl radicals [45,46]. Methanol oxidation potential is 0.02 V, lower than the corresponding water value E O 2 / H 2 O 0 = 1.23 V , pH = 0 . In the present study, high methanol concentrations were used to facilitate comparison with results published in the literature, where similar concentrations have been used [6,47,48]. Fig. 8 shows H2 production for the commercial and home-made photocatalysts, as well as the formaldehyde concentration remaining in the suspension after 8 h of photocatalytic reaction. It can be seen in Fig. 8A that the KR sample displays a much higher H2 production than any other tested photocatalyst: 21.90 μmol h−1 (2.18% QE). Sample KM, on the other hand, showed no production at all and has not been represented. The ordering with respect to hydrogen production was: KR > HB > DP > ML > KM This sequence coincides with that of generated formaldehyde. Fig. 8B shows the same information as Fig. 8A, but in relation to the photocatalysts produced during this study. The amorphous sample without thermal post-treatment is not represented as it did not yield any photocatalytic activity. Sample SG400 produced 3.37 μmol h−1 (0.34% QE). The series trend is that of a progressive reduction until sample SG600 where the trend reverses and production increases. A production peak is reached for SG700with a value of 10.74 μmol h−1 (1.07% QE). For samples treated at a higher temperature, a severe decrease in production can be observed, down to a value of 0.49 μmol h−1 (0.05% QE) for the SG900. Formaldehyde concentration, in the case of the photocatalysts synthesized for the purpose of this study, exhibits a distinctive behaviour. A maximum production of this intermediary is reached with sample SG400 (close to 30 ppm in suspension). Formaldehyde production consistently decreases for higher calcination temperatures until reaching a minimum at 600 °C (close to 8 ppm), after which it increases again for the samples calcined at 650 and 700 °C (10 and 23 ppm, respectively), coinciding with the higher hourly production rate (10.74 μmol h−1 for SG700). Samples with higher calcination temperatures produced less formaldehyde as well as less hydrogen. This pattern in photogenerated formaldehyde production indicates kinetics of methanol photo-oxidation that vary with the structural features of the photocatalyst material. Note that, in all cases, total formaldehyde concentration in solution is small (below 35 ppm). The HT samples produced hydrogen at an hourly rate midway between the corresponding figures for SG700 and SG750, 9.39 μmol h−1 (0.94% QE), and yielded formaldehyde concentrations similar to that of SG400. Mineralization was not detected during the 8hourlong experiment for either the commercial or synthesized photocatalysts. Measurable changes in pH (initially set at 5 ± 0.5) were not detected either, due to excess sacrificial agent."
11,Discussion,"Photocatalytic activity depends on numerous parameters including specific surface area, crystal size, crystalline phase structure, pore size and distribution, hydroxyl content, etc. However, in this study hydrogen production capacity showed a strong correlation with crystal structure and this seems to be the most determining factor. The sample obtained after the sol–gel process without post-treatment, either calcination or hydrothermal, shows no photocatalytic activity as a result of its amorphous structure [49]. Within the SGx series, three clearly distinctive classes of material appear. For calcination temperatures between 400 °C and 600 °C, where photocatalysts are 100% anatase, a slight decrease in the hydrogen production rate is observed with increasing temperature, a decrease that correlates with the decrease in specific surface area and increase in crystal size and crystallinity. A compromise between specific surface area and crystallinity is therefore important in order to obtain higher photocatalytic activity [50]. From 650 °C, where rutile phase appears, the hydrogen production rate increases again, reaching a maximum at 700 °C with an 88:12 anatase-rutile ratio. This is consistent with results in the literature where anatase-rutile mixtures with low proportion of rutile usually yield higher photoactivity [12,29,51,52]. It thus seems logical that the SG700 photocatalyst displayed the highest hydrogen production rate. A fall in the production rate was observed for the sample calcined at750 °C and, as the photocatalyst rutile proportion rose, the decrease in hydrogen production was more and more apparent. This could be due to an inhibition in proton photoreduction induced by the presence of the rutile phase. A carefully balanced amount of rutile phase is necessary, with any excess or defect clearly affecting hydrogen production capacity. The trend just described is consistent with formaldehyde production rates. There is, however, a relevant quantitative difference between hydrogen and formaldehyde photogeneration. This variation is minimum for those photocatalysts with low rutile content, SG700 and SG750, and maximum for photocatalysts with the lowest and highest calcination temperatures, 100% anatase and 100% rutile respectively. This shows that methanol photo-oxidation kinetics depend on the specific photocatalyst. Note also that only two of the tested photocatalysts yielded measurable levels of formic acid in the remaining suspension: the commercial KR and the synthesized HT, both showing similar formaldehyde generation (close to 30 ppm). Formic acid concentrations were 4.0 ppm and 1.9 ppm, for KR and HT respectively. It must be stressed that suspension pH was observed to be a relevant factor in the heterogeneous photocatalytic process, directly affecting photocatalyst stability and available redox processes [3]. In this set of experiments, the chosen pH value = 5 is close to the zero charge potential (zcp) of the SGx series synthesized photocatalysts (6.5–6.9), while zcp was 3.7 for the HT series. It is worth noting that no measurable change in pH was detected during the 8 h of the test, clearly suggesting that mineralization of the sacrificial agent was far from complete and CO2 production almost negligible. In summary, the SG700 yielded the highest hydrogen production rate of all the photocatalysts synthesized for the purpose of this study, closely followed by HT, both rates being higher than the rates for any of the commercial photocatalysts with the exception of the KR sample, which demonstrated the highest hydrogen production capability of all the tested samples. Our HT sample, despite displaying a slightly smaller hydrogen production capacity when compared with SG700, is clearly competitive from a practical and economic point of view, as it does not require such an energy intensive production process as SG700."
12,Conclusions,"Hydrogen production by photo-splitting using synthesized TiO2-based photocatalysts compares well with the commercial photocatalysts used in this study. The Kronos vlp7000, characterized by surface carbon doping, gave the highest hydrogen production rate. It can be concluded from the present study that those photocatalysts with a balanced amount of rutile and anatase phases (with a reduced percentage of rutile) and a polyhedral particle shape (truncated bipyramid), along with those photocatalysts with 100% anatase, high surface area, and small crystal size, yield the highest photoactivity for hydrogen production. Further research will be undertaken on surface carbon incorporation in order to improve photocatalyst performance for hydrogen production through water photo-splitting."
