0,Introduction,"Due to their high specific surface area, hierarchical porous textures, cost-effective and good corrosion resistance [1–4], porous carbon-supported transition-metal catalysts have been widely researched to replace high cost noble-metal-based electrocatalysts (e.g. Pt and Ir oxides) in fuel cells and metal–air batteries [5–9]. Recently, pyrolysis of metal-polymer complex is manifested to be an powerful and judicious strategy to construct porous carbon-based nanomaterials for high-performance electrocatalysis [10–14]. For example, Lin et al. reported a simple thermal annealing to fabricate Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles as hihgly efficient electrocatalysts for oxgen evolution by using a three-dimensional diamondoid framework Co-MOF as precursor [15]. Han et al. synthesized hierarchical porous tubular nanostructures composed of core-shell nanoparticles with Co-Co9S8 as core and N, S codoped carbon (Co-Co9S8@SN-CNT) as shell as a trifunctional catalyst for hydrogen/oxygen electrocatalysis by using one-dimensional cobalt-based metal organic framework as self-template precursor [16]. Likely, we also reported an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst composed of cobalt-based nanostructured metal phases (Co, Co3O4 and CoS x particles) supported on N, S codoped porous carbon submicrospheres (Co-NTMCs@NSC) through pyrolysis of the organometal precursor of Co(II)-chelated thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin and polydopamine (Co-TEFR@PDA) [17]. Although remarkable electrocatalysis has been made, it always causes the formation of different metal nanoparticles mixture embedded in porous carbon, which may suffer from the challenges of compromised individual performance or even selective removal of inert metal nanoparticles, leading to the loss of the catalytic activity and concurrently complicating the fundamental research [18]. Furthermore, the development of a single electrocatalyst that integrates trifunctional catalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen reduction reaction (HER) is significant to effectively simplify the components integration and markedly reduce fabrication cost. Herein, we develop a selective leaching method to synthesis Co9S8 particles incorporated in nitrogen, sulfur codoped porous carbon nanosheets (Co9S8@PNSC) by the pyrolysis of the assembled hybrid of silica, Co(II)-chelated thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (Co-TEFR) and polydopamine (PDA), and the followed etching treatment with NH4HF2. In this process, the novel etching reagent could remove the silica and selectively etch the Co particle in the hybrid-derived precursor, silica-containing and Co/Co9S8 particles embedded carbonaceous nanosheet (silica-Co/Co9S8@PNSC), achieving the final catalyst Co9S8@PNSC with high specific surface area, abundant hierarchical porosity and active nanoparticles. As a consequence, the resultant nanocomposite exhibits highly efficient ORR activity (E1/2 = +0.845 V) and remarkable electrocatalysis toward oxygen/hydrogen production with overpotential of 314 mV for OER and 192 mV for HER at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline media, comparable to and even superior to the catalytic activity of other trifunctional electrocatalysts reported in recent literature (Table S1). When applied as air−cathode for Zn−air batteries, the Co9S8@PNSC-assembled device shows a higher power density (203 mW cm−2) and better cycling stability than commerical Pt/C-based one."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Thiourea (99%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (99.99%), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (99%), ethylenediamine (99.5%), formaldehyde solution (37%) and dopamine hydrochloride (98%) were purchased from Aladdin. All reagents were analytical grade and utilized as received without any purification."
3,Preparation of Co9S8@PNSC,"2.2 Preparation of Co9S8@PNSC Brieftly, 0.5 g of thiourea (TU) and 0.2 g of Co(NO3)2•6H2O were dissolved in 40.0 mL of deionized water to obtain a clear and transparent solution, followed by the solw addition of 0.40 mL of ethylenediamine (En) and 1.44 mL of formalin (CH2O, 37 wt.%) under vigorous stirring at atmosphere temperature. Subsequently, 5.0 mL of dopamine aqueous solution (40.0 mg mL−1) was immediately added into the above mixture with magnetic stirring for 2 h. Next, 0.2 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added drop and drop. Upon further stirring for 24 h, the precipiate in the reaction mixture was obtained by centrifugation, and then sequentially purified with ultrapure water and alcohol. Subsequently, the dry precipitate was calcined at 800°C in Ar/H2 atmosphere to afford the composite (denoted as silica-Co/Co9S8@PNSC). Finally, silica-Co/Co9S8@PNSC was soaked in 4.0 M NH4HF2 aqueous solution at room temperature to leach silica and concurrently selectively remove Co particles, leading to the final product Co9S8@PNSC. For comparison, control samples Co/CoO/CoS x @PNSC and PNSC were preparation in the same manner either without the addition of TEOS or leaching with 10 wt.% HF in deionized water, respectively."
4,Electrochemistry,"2.3 Electrochemistry A CHI 750E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., China) was utilized to carry out electrochemical experiments. The ORR measurements were performed within a standard three-electrode configuration using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) as working electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt foil were empolyed as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials calibrated by the Ag/AgCl electrode were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Prior to measurement, a homogeneous catalyst ink with a 2.0 mg mL−1 of concentration was prepared by the dispersion of as-prepared sample into 1 mL of Nafion/ethanol (0.05 wt.%) solution under ultrasonication treatment. The ink was then dropcast onto the GEC surface and dried under ambient conditions. The catalyst loading on the GCE was 204 μg cm−2 unless otherwise indicated. In ORR measurement, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was determined in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a potential sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 under different electrode rotation rates of 400 to 2500 rpm. The long-term durability was detected at +0.50 V at 900 rpm rotation speed via amperometric i−t curve. Furthermore, the electron transfer number (n) and the corresponding H2O− yield were determined by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) n = I Disk I Ring / N + I Disk (2) H 2 O − = 200 I Ring / N I Ring / N + I Disk where N is the current collection efficiency on RRDE (0.37 in the present work) and I Disk and I Ring are referred to the disk and ring currents, respectively. As for electrochemical OER and HER measurements, catalysts loaded on carbon cloth (0.25 cm2) and an Ag/AgCl electrode with saturated KCl were utilized as the working and reference electrodes, respectively. Whereas, Pt foil and carbon rod were employed as the counter electrode for OER and HER measurements, respectively. The catalyst loading was set at 0.404 mg cm−2. All LSVs were recorded in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance test was conducted at +1.55 V and −0.280 V for OER and HER, respectively, with an AC amplitude of 5 mV from the frequency range of 105 Hz to 0.01 Hz. Unless stated otherwise, all the potentials for OER and HER are referred to RHE and have been iR-corrected according to the following equation: E c o m p e n s a t e d = E m e a s u r e d − i R u where E compensated is iR-corrected potential, E measured is experimentally measured potential, and R u is the compensated resistance."
5,Rechargeable Zn–Air battery,"2.4 Rechargeable Zn–Air battery Rechargeable Zn–air battery was assembled by employing a polishing zinc plate as the anode, and the composite loaded on the hydrophobic side of carbon cloth was utilized as a breathable electrode and an aqueous solution containing 6.0 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(Ac)2•2H2O was filled as working electrolyte. Prior to the home-made device, 3.0 mg mL−1 of ink was prepared by the dispersion of electrocatalyst into Nafion/ethanol solution (0.5 wt%) under sonication. Subsequently, the above ink was dropcast onto hydrophobic carbon cloth to achieve breathable electrode with the electrocatalyst loading of 2.0 mg cm−2."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization SEM and TEM measurements were conducted on a ZEISS field-emission electron microscope and a Tecnai G2-F20 microscope with the equipment of an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector, respectively. XRD profiles were recorded on a Bruker D8 instrument with Cu Kα radiation. XPS measurements were conducted on a Phi X-tool instrument. The BET surface area and the corresponding pore size distribution was defined by measuring N2 isotherms at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. Raman spectrum was acquried with a RENISHAW in Via instrument using an Ar laser source."
7,Results and discussion,"It should be mentioned that, in our previous study, the coordinated polymer could be assembled with polydopamine to form spherical composite [17]. Interestingly, as shown in Figure S1, the morphology of the coordinated polymer Co-TEFR can be changed into quasi-circular structure with rough edge and multi-heteroatoms by increasing the feeding amount of ethylenediamine, which acts as a strong alkalinity supplier, chelates with metal ions and results in other formation pathway [19,20]. Regarding the advantage of two-dimension carbon nanosheet (e.g. high specific surface area, enhanced accessible active site and rapid mass/ charge transfer), the resultant carbon-based electrocatalyst derived from the sheet-like composite may exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance [21–23]. This consideration is the motive of the present work. The synthesis process of the typical sample Co9S8@PNSC is schematically shown in Scheme 1, where composite nanosheet precursor is firstly fabricated by cooperative assembly of sheet-like Co-thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (Co-TEFR), polydopamine (PDA) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) [24]. Subsequently, the assembled composites are pyrolyzed in Ar/H2 atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h and then etched by 4 M NH4HF2 to obtain the final product Co9S8@PNSC. During the post treatment, different etching agents (HF and NH4HF2) are used to remove the inert constituent such as silica template. The resultant materials are firstly characterized by XRD profiles. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the metallic Co (PDF#15-0806) and crystalline Co9S8 nanoparticles (PDF#19-0364) are observed for the pristine sample silica-Co/Co9S8@PNSC without etching while the Co9S8 nanocrystalline is only identified in Co9S8@PNSC etching by NH4HF2. However, after post treatment by HF, no diffraction peak is found in PNSC, which can also be supported by TEM image (Fig. S2). In addition, XPS survey spectra of different samples are also investigated in Fig. 1b, where the silica peak is obviously identified for the pristine sample silica-Co/Co9S8@PNSC while the Co electron is not detected in the PNSC, signifying the selective etching of NH4HF2 for metal Co besides silica template. These findings can be further supported by N2 adsorption/ desorption isotherm measurement (Fig. S3), in which the dominated mesopore sizes and extra specific surface area can be produced by the etching of silica template and metal nanoparticles. Specifically, Co9S8@PNSC shows a BET surface area up to 886 m2 g−1, as listed in Table 1 , which is somewhat smaller than that of PNSC (1197 m2 g−1) but larger than that of silica-Co/Co9S8@PNSC (295 m2 g−1). The extra BET area and the reserved Co9S8 nanoparticles may remarkably facilitate to the electrolyte diffusion and electrocatalytic activity, respectively [25–27]. The SEM image of the precursor composite silica-Co-TEFR@PDA is shown in Fig. 2 a, where the circular-like nanosheet with uniform size and high dispersity can be clearly observed. After carbonization and post treatment, the Co9S8@PNSC retains a similar circular-like nanosheet with the average diameter of ~220 nm and thickness of ~30 nm (Fig. 2b and c). These findings can be further visualized by TEM images in Fig. 2d, where the thickness of the nanosheet is in the range of 27 ~ 31 nm. Furthermore, in the TEM image with high magnification (Fig. 2e), one can see that the abundant porous structure and ultrasmall dark spot which is assigned to Co9S8 nanoparticles for Co9S8@PNSC. Meanwhile, in HR-TEM image (Fig. 2f), the dominated pore sizes are determined to be ~3 nm while the metal nanoparticle sizes are measured to be ~5 nm. Besides, in the corresponding HR-TEM images of the selective region (Fig. 2g and h), lattice fringes with an interspacing of 0.176 and 0.286 nm are well resolved, in agreement with the (440) and (222) planes of crystalline Co9S8, respectively. Meanwhile, the short-range defective graphite layer structure can be clearly found in the region close to Co9S8 nanoparticles. In addition, elemental mapping measurements (Fig. 2i) reveal the even distribution of C, N, O, S and Co elements on the sheet-like catalyst. Apart from the electrocatalytic activity of defective structure, the two-dimensional sheet and porous textures are advantageous to the accessibility to active sites and the transportation of intermediate products, while Co9S8 nanoparticles with small sizes can also serve as catalytic sites which plays a positive impact on electrocatalysis [28]. In order to investigate the influence of TEOS on the formation of this circular-like porous carbon nanosheet containing Co9S8 nanoparticles, a control sample, N, S codoped porous carbonaceous nanosheet containing metallic Co particles (referred to Co/CoO/CoS x @PNSC), was prepared without the addition of TEOS. It should be noted that, in the absence of TEOS, the obtained sample exhibits a similar sheet-like morphology but the sizes and structure of the particles are changed into 30 nm and the mixture crystalline of Co and CoO as well as graphite layers, respectively (Fig. S4a-d). However, the metallic Co particles are still detected and remained in the counterpart after the same etching manner by NH4HF2 (Fig. S5), which is mainly due to the protection of graphite carbon for the particles [29]. Combing the TEM findings, it can be reasonably concluded that the addition of TEOS not only effectively confines the aggregation of metal nanoparticles, but plays a crucial role in achieving the particles crystalline and defective graphitic layers [30,31], both of which are significant to boost electrocatalysis [30]. Fig. 3 a shows the Raman spectrum of Co9S8@PNSC which possess two distinct peaks of D and G bands. The G band at 1592 cm−1 refers to the E2g mode in graphitic carbon materials, while D band is derived from the A1g mode for defective carbons [32]. Furthermore, the D band can be fitted into four peaks by Gaussian-Lorentzian numerical simulation, in which the D peak is wide and the ratio of ID1/IG is 1.14, indicative of the existence of disordered graphite lattice in the carbon-based material [33]. The findings are well consistent with the HR-TEM result. The defective structure can modulate the electronic and surface properties of the catalysts, mainly facilitating an improved electrocatalysis [34–36]. Besides, from the EDS spectrum of the typical sample Co9S8@PNSC depicted in Fig. 3b, in which the C, N, O, S and Co elements are obviously resolved and the coressponding atomic fraction is listed in Table 1. XPS technique is further employed to identify the surface composition of the nanomaterials. As shown in Fig. 4 a, deconvolving the core-level XPS spectrum of C 1s electron for Co9S8@PNSC yields five peaks at 284.1, 284.6, 285.3, 286.0 and 288.2 eV, corresponding to C−S [37], C=C (sp2), C−C (sp3) [38], C−N and C=O species. The formation of C−S moiety further demonstrates that the S heteroatoms are successfully retained in carbon matrix. As for deconvolution of the core-level XPS spectrum of N 1s electron (Fig. 3d), dominated two peaks are in the range beween 396.0 and 402.0 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N (~398.2 eV) and graphitic N (~401.1 eV) [39–42]. The core-level XPS spectrum of O 1s electron (Fig. S6) can be fitted into C=O (531.1 eV), C–O–C (532.1 eV) and C–OH (533.1 eV), indicative of the absence of Co–O species. Beides, S 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2e) can be deconvoluted into five well-defined peaks at 161.5, 162.4, 163.4 164.6 and 168.7 eV, which are assigned to the S 2p1/2, S 2p3/2, C−S, C=S and the SO4 2− derived from surface oxidation, respectively. In Fig. 3f, the deconvolution fitting of Co 2p electron gives three pairs of peaks, among which the peaks at 778.5 and 795.8 eV may be ascribed to Co2+, while a pair of peaks at 781.6 and 797.7 eV may orignate from Co3+, as well as the rest located at 786.0 and 803.2 eV are satellite peaks. According to the integrated peak areas, the molar ratio of Co2+/Co3+ is calculated to be ~8.9, implying the successful reservation of the Co9S8 nanoparticles in the carbonaceous materials after etching treatment by NH4HF2. The catalytic activities of the nanocomposites toward ORR are first evaluated by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). As shown in Fig. 4a, all catalysts show an abrupt current increase, indicating the remarkable performance toward oxygen reduction. However, the half-wave potential vary among different catalysts, at +0.845 V for Co9S8@PNSC, +0.832 V for Co/CoO/CoS x @PNSC, and +0.770 V for PNSC. Hence, it can be found that the PNSC with defective structure and N, S dopants possesses obvious ORR performance while the leaching of Co9S8 results in the deterioration of ORR performance, suggesting that the Co9S8 particles and the defective carbonaceous structure have a positive impact on the catalytic ORR activity. Previous literature have been reported that the defective carbon structure near to metal particles has a charge polarization for the promotion of the electrocatalytic process [43]. Hence, it may be reasonably concluded that the remarkble ORR catalytic activity of Co9S8@PNSC mainly originate from the synergistic effect of the heteroatoms-doped and defect carbon and Co9S8 particles. The ORR measurement indicate the best electrocatalytic activity for Co9S8@PNSC, much comparable to that of Pt/C electrode (+0.847 V). Nevertheness, Co9S8@PNSC displays a remarkble limiting current density of 5.221 mA cm−2 at +0.500 V, as compared to Pt/C catalyst (4.80 mA cm−2). Besides, the cathodic current of Co9S8@PNSC close to +0.800V shows a distinct tendency to abruptly increased and then fall, which mainly ascribe to the existence of abundant interconnected porosity caused by the etching of metallic Co and the gap of the aggregation of circular-like nanosheet [44]. The corresponding Tafel plots are depicted in Fig. 4b, in which the slopes are calculated to be 80 and 86 mV dec−1 for Co9S8@PNSC and Pt/C, respectively. These highly comparable slopes suggest that the reaction kinetic on the Co9S8@PNSC is analogous to that proceeding on Pt/C during ORR electrocatalysis, that is, the first-electron reduction of oxygen dominates the entire ORR kinetics [45]. Fig. 4c shows the electron transfer number (n) and the generated peroxide species (H2O−) yields for the typical sample Co9S8@PNSC and commercial Pt/C. It can be observed that the n values of Co9S8@PNSC sample is close to 4 over a definite potential region from +0.2 to +0.8 V, even higher than that of Pt/C at high potential region such as +0.75 V, implying a higher selectivity toward 4e− reduction of oxygen for Co9S8@PNSC. Similarly, the H2O− yield of Co9S8@PNSC is very clese to that of Pt/C, confirming that Co9S8@PNSC material could serve as an efficient catalyst toward ORR. What's more, the corresponding Koutecky-Levich plots for Co9S8@PNSC and commercial Pt/C (Fig. S7) exhibit a high linear trend in the potential range of +0.570 to +0.730 V, indicating that a first-order reaction kenetics with regard to the oxygen concentration in the electrolyte is adopted. Furthermore, durability of nanocomposite-modified electrode is an crucial parameter for electrocatalysis. Fig. 4d shows the amoperometric i−t curves with continuous operation for 40000 s. One can find that Co9S8@PNSC can maintains 83.8% of its initial current, higher than the commercial Pt/C (69.6%), confirming that Co9S8@PNSC possesses higher working stability than Pt/C. Tolerance to crossover effect is another important issue for evaluating ORR electrocatalysts. On the basis of this consideration, methanol is used as a illustrated fuel to analyze and compare the studies. As shown in Fig. S8, upon the addition of 1 M methanol into electrolyte, one can find that a sharp decrease of current density is observed for the Pt/C electrode while only slight fluctuation and no apparent current change are found for the Co9S8@PNSC electrode. Theses results obviously suggest that Co9S8@PNSC catalyst possess a higher tolerance to crossovered methanol than Pt/C. Previous literatures have been reported that the metallic Co9S8 composites can efficiently catalyze ORR and OER [46–48]. Hence, the OER activity of different samples are investigated in 1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5 a, a sharply increase of voltammetric currents are observed for all the investigated samples, suggesting an apparent OER catalytic performance. Specifically, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, Co9S8@PNSC shows the lowest overpotential (EOER, 10) of only 314 mV, as compared with 418 mV for Co/Co9S8@PNSC, 519 mV for PNS and 323 mV for IrO2 catalyst. Additionally, from the corresponding Tafel plots depicted in Fig. 5b, Co9S8@PNSC shows a moderate slope of 169 mV dec−1, a value that is higher than that of IrO2 (102 mV dec−1), but lower than the 171 mV dec−1 for Co/Co9S8@PNSC and 191 mV dec−1 for PNSC. Furthermore, comparison with the typical sample Co9S8@PNSC, the PNSC catalyst with removal of the Co9S8 nanoparticles lost the prominent OER activity, directly proving that Co9S8 nanoparticles are benefcial for promoting OER electrocatalytic activities. Additionally, the key parameters of overpotential and Tafel plots for different catalysts toward OER are summarized in Fig. 5c for comparison, visually demonstrating the remakable OER electrocatalysis for Co9S8@PNSC among the series. Besides, charge transfer resistant (Rct) is effectively estimated to elucidate the OER catalytic kinetics of different catalysts through electrochemical impedance test. As shown in Fig. 5d, the smallest semicircle is observed for Co9S8@PNSC than other catalysts Co/Co9S8@PNSC, PNSC and commercial IrO2 in alkaline electrolyte, indicating the lowest charge transfer resistance for Co9S8@PNSC amony these catalysts. To further account for the remakable OER performance for Co9S8@PNSC, electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is a significant indicator and estimated by the calculation of the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) from the CVs at different potential region from +0.950 and +1.050 V. As shown in Fig. 5e and S9, a Cdl value of Co9S8@PNSC is determined to be 20.9 mF cm−2, much higher than that of Co/Co9S8@PNSC (6.4 mF cm−2), and PNSC (16.8 mF cm−2) in 1 M KOH solution. To sum up, Co9S8@PNSC electrocatalyst have the lowest charge transter resistance and much larger ECSA, which are advantageous to the electron transpor and the exposure of the electrocatalytically active sites, respectively, endowing the superior OER electrocatalytic performance for Co9S8@PNSC. Chronoamperometric response further demonstrates the higher lifespan for Co9S8@PNSC than commercial IrO2 catalyst. From Fig. 5f, after continuous measurement for about 11 h, Co9S8@PNSC retained 82.5% of its initial value, while IrO2 gradually decrease to ~64.7% under the same conditions. The degradation of OER performance for Co9S8@PNSC sample is mainly owing to the slow loss of electrocatalysts arising from the peeling effect of accumulated O2 bubbles on electrode surface (inset to Fig. 5f). Many studies have suggested that Co9S8 can gradually transform into cobalt oxyhydrates under OER conditions [49–51], which are the true catalytically active species for the OER. To understand the possible active sites of Co9S8@PNSC for the OER, we performed XRD measurement after the chronoamperometric OER test (Fiugre S10), where visible peaks for Co(OH)2 are observed in post-OER Co9S8@PNSC. Thus, a cobalt oxyhydrates is more likely to be the actual active species for remarkable OER activity. Additionally, the catalytic activity of Co9S8@PNSC for HER electrocatalysis was further conducted in 1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 6 , to afford the current density of 10 mA cm−2, Co9S8@PNSC requires an overpotential of 192 mV, which is somewhat larger than the 35 mV for Pt/C but much less than 317 mV for PNSC and 239 mV for Co/CoO/CoS x @PNSC. In addition, From Fig. 6b, the Tafel slope for Co9S8@PNSC is determined to be 86 mV dec−1, which is close to that of Pt/C (55 mV dec−1). This observation indicates that the HER process on Co9S8@PNSC follow a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism [52,53]. The above results can be more clearly presented by the histogram comparison in Fig. 6c. Noted that, the electrocatalytic HER activity of Co9S8@PNSC is superior to the PNSC catalyst, obviously demonstrating that Co9S8 nanoparticles are advantageous to boost HER performance. EIS measurements are further conducted to probe the electron transfer property of the electrocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 6d, the typical Co9S8@PNSC sample exhibits the smallest semicircle among the series but a slightly higher Rct than that of commercial Pt/C. This finding indicates the favourable charge transfer for Co9S8@PNSC, which markedly facilitate the HER process. In addition, the long-term durability is another important criterion to estimate an electrocatalyst performance. It is noteworthy that, after 40,000 s chronoamperometric measurement, as shown in Fig. 6e, 90.6% of relative current density is retained for Co9S8@PNSC, which is larger than that of Pt/C (82.3%), signifying the high HER stability of Co9S8@PNSC. The superior operational stability can be further supported by accelerated durability test (ADT) in Fig. 6f, where the Co9S8@PNSC shows a negligible negative shift after 2000 cycles. Afer the HER, the crystal structure of Co9S8@PNSC remains unchanged, as evident from XRD with no apparent variation (Fig. S11), suggesting good durability of the Co9S8@PNSC nanomaterial itself under HER conditions. The OER and HER electrocatalysis of different composites are also conducted in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solutions (Fig. S12), and the corresponding results suggest that the overall OER and HER electrocatalysis activities of present electrocatalysts are more efficient in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution than those observed in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Consequently, the resultant Co9S8@PNSC exhibits efficient ORR activity and remarkable electrocatalysis toward oxygen/hydrogen production in alkaline media, comparable to and even superior to those of the currently reported Co9S8-based composites and other trifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S1). Among these literatures, the heteroatoms-doped carbon/ Co9S8 hybrids as low-cost electrocatalysts generally show outstanding bifunctional activities [54–57]. Taking a Co9S8-based catalyst reported by Gao's work as a typical sample [57], they employed a simple method to fabricate Co9S8/N, S codoped honeycomb-structured porous carbon (Co9S8/NSC) in situ composites, which was composed of monodisperse Co9S8 particles and three-dimensional interconnected network as well as N, S heteroatoms-doped carbon matrix, hence endowing the highly efficient ORR/ OER electrocatalysis of the catalyst. Differently, in this study, a selective etching route is successfully developed to construct a remarkable trifunctional electrocatalyst (Co9S8@PNSC), which consisted of small Co9S8 nanoparticles with a diameter of about 5 nm (Fig. 3) and heteroatoms-doped defective carbon substrate as well as two-dimensional quasi-circular nanosheet with high specific surface area and hierarchical porosity (Table 1 and Fig. S4). The hierarchical porous architectures with abundant meso-/ macro-pores, derived from the intrinsic mesopore and extra macropore of the gap between the nanosheet, ensure the fast mass transportation and maximum accessibility to the active sites. The ultrafine Co9S8 nanoparticles entrapped by N, S codoped and defective carbon allow the improvement of electrical conductivity and maximize the utilization of active sites. These characteristics contribute to the remarkable oxygen/ hydrogen electrocatalysis for Co9S8@PNSC. The above results display that Co9S8@PNSC can efficiently catalyzed the ORR and OER [58], which can be applied in oxygen reversible electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. As illustrated in Fig. 7 a, a home-made device of Zn-air battery is fabricated to further investigate the catalytic activity of Co9S8@PNSC. In Fig. 7b, the battery using Co9S8@PNSC as the air cathode shows an open-circuit voltage of 1.466 V and the discharge potential of 1.255 V at 10 mA cm−2, in which the former is well consistent with the value determined by using the multimeter. From the discharge polarization curves shown in Fig. 7c, it can be seen that the device with Co9S8@PNSC based electrode displays a higher discharge potentials, large than commerical Pt/C-based one at different current densities such as 0.98 V vs. 0.94 V at 100 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the Co9S8@PNSC displays a maximum power density of 203 mW cm−2, also much higher than that of Pt/C-modified battery (132 mW cm−2). In addition, the charge–discharge cycles of the catalysts-assembled Zn–air batteries are set at current density of 10 mA cm−2 with the intervals for 5 min. As depicted in Fig. 7d, the initial voltage gap of Co9S8@PNSC and Pt/C is about 0.852 V and 0.942 V, respectively. After 12 h, the voltage gap is gradually increased to 0.920 V for Co9S8@PNSC, much lower than that of Pt/C-assembled device (1.391 V). These observations indicate that a remarkble cycle stability of Co9S8@PNSC in rechargeable Zn–air batteries."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, nitrogen, sulfur codoped porous carbon nanosheet incorporated with Co9S8 particles (Co9S8@PNSC) are successfully synthesized by the pyrolysis of the sheet-like composite precursor and followed selective etching treatment with NH4HF2. The resulting Co9S8@PNSC electrocatalyst comprises abundant porosity and defective graphitic structure as well as catalytically active Co9S8 particles, dramatically boosting ORR, OER and HER electrocatalysis. Specifically, Co9S8@PNSC displays a E1/2 of +0.845 V, strong methanol tolerant capability and remarkble stability for ORR. It also exhibits an efficient OER and HER electrocatalytic performance, with an overpotential of 314 mV and −192 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and outstanding durability, respectively. When applied in rechargeable Zn–air battery, the Co9S8@PNSC-based device displays high power density (203 mW cm−2) and favorable charge–discharge reversibility with small variant of voltage gap after 12 h operation. The nanomaterial preparation strategy presented here may be expolited for the synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts for diverse applications."
