0,Introduction,"The development of sustainable and environmentally benign resources for the production of liquid transportation fuels (biofuels) is of great current interest to alleviate the dependence on petroleum and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse and noxious gases such as CO, CO2, NOx and SOx [1]. Biomass, as only green and renewable carbon resources, has been successfully applied as the alternative feedstocks to pendulum in the production of biofuels including bioethanol [2] and biodiesel [3–5]. Owing to enormous market requirement, lignocellulosic biomass-derived “second generation” biofuels or “oxygenate fuel additives” such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [6], 5-ethoxymethylfurfural [7], alkyl levulinates [8,9] and glycerides [10,11], have emerged more recently. Another attractive biofuel production process is fast pyrolysis of waste agricultural/forestry biomass coupled with catalytic upgrading, which offers potential economic and environmental benefits for sustainable production of biofuels in a large scale [12–14,17]. Pyrolysis biofuel is a complex mixture of numerous low vapor pressure compounds including acetic acid (1–10 wt%) and water decomposed from hemicellulose, furanic compounds derived from cellulose as well as phenolic compounds produced from decomposition of more stable lignin fraction [17]. Consequently, direct application of fast pyrolysis biofuels is impeded by their high oxygen content (20–50 wt%) and strong acidity (pH = 2.5–3) with associated high water content (10–60 wt%), which render them undesirable properties such as low heating value, immiscibility with hydrocarbon fuels, thermal and chemical instability as well as corrosiveness. The upgrading of crude pyrolysis biofuels prior to catalytic hydrotreating demands reducing acidity and oxygen content to a large extent, and thereby improving the stability and decreasing hydrogen consumption in subsequent refining steps. For this purpose, catalytic esterification of acetic acid with methanol or ethanol is a common strategy to reduce the acidity and viscosity of pyrolysis biofuels [18,19]. However, oxygen content of crude pyrolysis biofuels is unaltered. In order to eliminate both water and ester continuously and thereby decreasing oxygen content, alcohols with boiling points higher than water are preferred to avoid alcohol loss by evaporation. Therefore, PrSO3H/SBA-15-, resin- or zeolite-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol, o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol or anisyl alcohol has been studied [15–17,20]. The resulting aromatic esters may find broad applications in pharmaceutical and agrochemicals fields [21]. The main problems faced to the above process are the formation of coke and instability of the solid acid catalysts in aqueous environments, and therefore the development of robust, efficient and recyclable solid acids with high catalytic activity and selectivity as well as outstanding water tolerance is still a challenge. In the search for efficient and recyclable solid acids for esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol in a simulated pyrolysis biofuel environment by using toluene as the representatives of non-polar lignin derivatives, we devote to develop heterogeneous Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (IL)-based catalysts. Brønsted acidic ILs are most promising in terms of efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass/derivatives to biofuels and chemicals [9]. However, separation of ILs from the reaction media and recyclability is a problem because they show excellent miscibility with various organic solvents. Chemical immobilization of acidic ILs on suitable supports is the foremost strategy to solve the separation and recovery problems of acidic ILs [22–24]. In the present work, the Brønsted acidic ionic liquid functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres, [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs (C3 = PrSO3H, Im = imidazolium cation), are demonstrated following a novel preparation route combined in situ fabrication of chloropropyl functionalized organosilica hollow nanospheres supports and subsequent successive functionalization by imidazole, 1,3-propane sultone and trifluoromethane sulfonic acid. The resulting [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs possess unique characteristics such as extremely small size, hollow interiors, opening and permeable thin shells and large BET surface area, and they can serve as the nanoreactors for esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol. Accordingly, the diffusion distance of the reactants/products is shortened, and the accessibility of the reactants to acidic ILs is improved, offering significant advantages for the target reaction. Additionally, owing to the presence of bridging ethyl groups in silica/carbon framework, the surface of [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs is hydrophobic partly, and diffusion of water molecules yielded during biomass pyrolysis and esterification procedures to the interior of hollow nanospheres will be hindered greatly. This excellent water tolerance is expected to speed the esterification reaction. During the catalytic studies, the influence of various important experimental parameters including reaction temperature, benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio and water content on the catalytic activity and selectivity of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol are evaluated. The esterification activity of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs is also compared with periodic mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si as well as commercially available p-toluenesulfonic acid, Amberlyst-15 resin and HY zeolite."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Chloropropyl functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres (PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs) P123 (0.38 g) and TMB (0.5 mL) was dissolved successively in an aqueous HCl solution (1.9 mol L−1, 15.1 mL) at room temperature under stirring. The resultant homogeneous mixture was heated to 40 °C, and then BTMSE (0.6 mL) was added dropwise. After stirring for 45 min, CPTES (0.06, 0.13 and 0.2 mL, respectively, to adjust Cl content in the support and thereby –SO3H group loading in the product) was added dropwise. The suspension was continuously stirred at 40 °C for 24 h followed by aging at 100 °C for another 24 h. The white powder thus obtained was dried at 80 °C for 12 h and 100 °C for 2 h. Finally, the PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs was recovered after removing P123 and TMB by boiling ethanol washing for 3 times, and each time performed for 6 h. The initial molar composition of P123: HCl: TMB: BTMSE: CPTES in the preparation system was 1: 439: 55: 37: (4, 8 and 12). PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs can also be prepared following the above procedures but changing the initial molar composition of P123: HCl: TMB: BTMSE: CPTES in the preparation system to 1: 278: 55: 28: 6 (initial HCl concentration was 1.6 mol L−1). 2.1.2 Brønsted acidic IL functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres ([C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs) As-prepared PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs was dispersed in an imidazole (17, 36.8 and 56.6 mg, respectively)-containing toluene solution (10 mL) at 110 °C, and the mixture was continuously stirred for 24 h. Afterwards, the mixture was centrifuged, and the separated powder was washed with dichloromethane for three times. The dried powder was dispersed in toluene solution (10 mL), and then 1,3-propane sultone was added (0.023, 0.05 and 0.075 mL, respectively). The resulting mixture was kept at refluxing temperature for 8 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid was added (0.023, 0.05 and 0.075 mL, respectively) and the mixture was heated to 60 °C for 12 h. The light yellow dispersion thus obtained was centrifuged, and the separated product was firstly washed with hot toluene and then dichloromethane for several times until the adsorbed acidic ILs was removed completely. The product was dried at 80 °C for 6 h and then 100 °C for 2 h. The final product was denoted as [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Six HNSs, where C3 refers to PrSO3H, and x represents –SO3H loading (%) in the product. Herein, x = 4.5, 6.0 and 8.4 (%), respectively, determined by ICP-OES (Table 1 ). 2.1.3 Periodic mesostructured Brønsted acidic IL functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica nanopores ([C3Im][SO3CF3]-2Dhex) At first, periodic mesostructured chloropropyl functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica (PrCl-Si(Et)Si-2Dhex) was prepared. Typically, P123 (0.5 g) was dissolved successively in an aqueous HCl solution (0.28 mol L−1, 13 mL) at room temperature under stirring. The resultant homogeneous mixture was heated to 40 °C, and then BTMSE (0.6 mL) was added dropwise. After stirring for 45 min, CPTES (0.13 mL) was added dropwise. The suspension was continuously stirred at 40 °C for 24 h followed by hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for additional 24 h. The white powder thus obtained was dried at 80 °C for 12 h and 100 °C for 2 h. Finally, the PrCl-Si(Et)Si-2Dhex was recovered after removing P123 by boiling ethanol washing for 3 times, and each time performed for 6 h. The initial molar composition of P123: HCl: BTMSE: CPTES in the preparation system was 0.862: 36: 23: 5.3. Subsequent functionalization of the PrCl-Si(Et)Si-2Dhex with acidic ILs followed the same preparation steps with the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, and the determined -SO3H loading (%) in [C3Im][SO3CF3]-2Dhex is 6.5 (Table 1)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Nitrogen gas adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M surface area and porosity analyzer, and the samples were outgassed under vacuum at 363 K for 1 h and 373 K for another 12 h before the measurement. TEM analyses were performed using a JEM-2100F high resolution transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. 13C cross polarization-magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR and 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 WB spectrometer equipped with a 4 mm standard bore CP MAS probe head. XPS was performed on an Axis Ultra DLD instrument with a monochromated Al-Kα source at a residual gas pressure below 10−8 Pa. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond TG/DTA instrument under air atmosphere. Sulfur content or -SO3H loading in various samples was determined by an ICAP6300-Thermoscientific ICP-OES. Brønsted acid strength and acid site density of the samples were determined by a WDDY-2008J microcomputer automatic potentiometric titration instrument (Table 1), and the procedure followed the reported method [25,26]. Typically, 50 mg of solid sample was suspended in acetonitrile media and stirred for 3 h, and then the suspension was titrated with a 0.1 mol L−1 solution of n-butylamine in acetonitrile."
4,Catalytic experiments,"2.3 Catalytic experiments The [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol in a simulated pyrolysis biofuel environment was performed at atmospheric pressure and 100 °C employing 24 mg of catalyst, 10 mmol of acetic acid, 3.33 mmol of benzyl alcohol in 10 mL toluene. Changes of the concentrations of benzyl alcohol and benzyl acetate in the reaction system were analyzed by a Shimadzu 2014C GC-FID, and ethyl laurate was used as an internal standard. The possible side products yielded during the esterification process were identified by a HP6890GC-5973MSD mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Preparation of Brønsted acidic IL functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres,"3.1 Preparation of Brønsted acidic IL functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres As shown in Scheme 1 , [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs are prepared via following two steps. In the first step, PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs supports are prepared by co-condensation of bridging organosilane (BTMSE) with 3-chloropropyl triethoxy siloxane (CPTES) around P123 (EO20PO70EO20) polymer micelles in the presence of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) under acidic environment. One of the key factors that determines the PrCl-Si(Et)Si with hollow spherical nanostructures is well-adjusted molar composition of the starting materials (P123: HCl: TMB: BTMSE: CPTES). On the one hand, amphiphilic polymer surfactant P123 with both hydrophilic −CH2CH2O (EO) and hydrophobic −CH2(CH3)CHO (PO) blocks can readily self-assemble into micelles through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions under acidic conditions. The micelles can further aggregate to form spherical lyotropic liquid crystal structures at suitable molar ratio of P123: HCl: TMB (herein, 1: 439/278: 55). In this liquid-crystal structure, the PO blocks form the core of the spherical micelles, while the EO blocks form a hydrated corona around the core. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic TMB as a micelle-expanding agent is dissolved in the core of P123 micelles to expand the micelles. With the penetration of TMB molecules into the micelles, the charge density on the surface of micelles further decreases, leading to well-dispersed spherical lyotropic liquid crystal structures [27–29]. Therefore, the formation of spherical lyotropic liquid crystal structures is due to the synergistic effect of P123 and TMB under suitable acidity. On the other hand, co-hydrolysis and -condensation of BTMSE and CPTES around the above spherical lyotropic liquid crystal phases in an acidic media can create well-dispersed hollow spherical chloropropyl functionalized silica/carbon framework. The linkage of PrCl groups with the silica/carbon framework is further fastened after aging at 100 °C for 24 h, and the hollow spherical PrCl-Si(Et)Si nanostructures are finally constructed after removal of P123 and TMB by boiling ethanol washing. The other key factor for the formation of the PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs is prehydrolysis of BTMSE at 40 °C for 45 min before the addition of CPTES, which can ensure well-matched hydrolysis and condensation rate of both silane precursors and thereby well-fabricated –Si–C–C–Si–O1.5–Si–C–C–C–Cl linkage. Subsequently, the PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs are functionalized by imidazole, giving rise to N-propyl imidazole functionalized organosilica hollow nanospheres (PrIm-Si(Et)Si HNSs), accompanying with the release of HCl. Further quaternary ammonization of PrIm-Si(Et)Si HNSs with 1,3-propane sultone and then anion exchange with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs are finally obtained, and they constructed shell structure. In order to adjust Brønsted acid site density of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, different amounts of CPTES, imidazole and 1,3-propane sultone are added in the preparation systems. Through ICP-OES determination, –SO3H loading in the final product is 4.5, 6.0 and 8.4 wt%, respectively (Table 1)."
7,Characterization of Brønsted acidic IL functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres,"3.2 Characterization of Brønsted acidic IL functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres 3.2.1 Morphology characteristics The formation of hollow spherical PrCl-Si(Et)Si supports are revealed by TEM observations, as shown in Fig. S1. At initial HCl concentration of 1.9 and 1.6 mol L−1, the prepared PrCl-Si(Et)Si supports are both composed of uniform spherical nanostructures with hollow interior, extremely small particle size (15–20 nm) and thin shell (2–3 nm). After functionalization of the support (prepared with initial HCl concentration of 1.9 mol L−1) with Brønsted acidic ILs, the resulting [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids still remain hollow spherical nanostructures without obvious changes of the particle size and shell thickness, regardless of the loading of acidic ILs (Fig. 1 a−c). For subsequent catalytic activity comparison with [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal mesostructured [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex counterpart is also prepared, and its periodic mesostructure can be clearly seen in Fig. 1d. 3.2.2 Structural information In the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, the −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3 −] groups are immobilized on the hollow spherical organosilica support by imidazole linker, and composition and structure of the nanohybrids are confirmed by XPS and MAS NMR analysis. XPS probe technique can provide useful information related to the surface chemical states of various elements in [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs. As shown in Fig. 2 a, S 2p XP spectrum of the representative [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs is deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 169.3 (S2p1/2) and 168.3 eV (S2p3/2), attributing to sulfur species from PrSO3H group and SO3CF3 – anion [11]. In the case of N 1 s XP spectrum of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs, the peak appeared at 401.8 eV corresponds to N atoms in imidazole, confirming the presence of imidazole unit in organosilica-immobilized acidic ILs (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c displays F 1 s XP spectrum of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs, and the peak positioned at 688.2 eV is assigned to F species of C–F bonds from −[C3Im][SO3CF3] groups [11]. Formation of silica/carbon framework and incorporation of −[C3Im][SO3CF3] groups in the silica/carbon framework through imidazole linker are further powerfully evidenced by 29Si MAS NMR and 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy. As can be seen in Fig. 3 a, two characteristic resonance signals positioned at −58.3 and −65.9 ppm are found in the 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of the representative [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs sample, corresponding to organosiloxane species of T2 [–CH2CH2Si(OSi)2(OH)] and T3 [–CH2CH2Si(OSi)3] within the ethyl-bridged organosilica framework [20]. Additionally, the resonance signals originated from inorganic SiO4 species (Qn sites, n = 1–4) appearing in the range of −90 to −120 ppm are not found [30,31], reflecting that cleavage of C-Si bond in the silica/carbon framework is avoided during the preparation process of the nanohybrids. Fig. 3b shows 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs, which can provide plentiful structural information concerning about various carbon species existed in the nanohybrids. Specifically, the strongest peak positioned at 5.3 ppm is assigned to carbon species (C1) of bridging ethyl units of the silica/carbon framework [32]. As for three pesks centered at 15.5 (C2), 26.2 (C3) and 48.2 ppm (C4), they are attributted to chloropropyl group connected with both silica/carbon framework and imidazole [33,34]. The resonance signals appeared at 121.8 (C5) and 135.1 ppm (C6) are originated from imidazole unit [34]. These five signals (C2–C5) confirm that N-propyl imidazole group is successfully introduced into the silica/carbon framework, which is the prerequisite for subsequent immobilization of −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3] group via quaternary ammonization. The presence of −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3] group in the silica/carbon framework is confirmed by C3′ (26.2 ppm), C4′ (48.2 ppm), C7 (52.4 ppm) and C8 species (120.0 ppm). The former three carbon species (C3′, C4′ and C7) come from −PrSO3H group covalently bonded on imidazole cation, while the last carbon species is derived from SO3CF3 − anion [33,35]. Additional signal at 70.3 ppm (C∗) is characteristic of the residual surfactant P123, indicating that trace P123 still exists in the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs after washing with boiling ethanol [20]. Combination of 29Si MAS NMR and 13C MAS NMR spectra it is concluded that the −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3] functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica framework is successfully fabricated through imidazole linking during P123-directed sol-gel process followed by subsequent functionalization, and the formed framework constructed the shell structure of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs without the cleavage of Si–C bond (Scheme 1). 3.2.3 Porosity properties The interesting hollow spherical nanostructures of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs give rise to them excellent porosity properties, which are clearly confirmed by nitrogen gas porosimetry measurement. The nitrogen gas adsorption-desorption isotherms of three as-prepared hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids as well as their periodic mesoporous counterpart are given in Fig. 4 a. The materials exhibit type IV isotherm, reflecting their mesoporosity. For three [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs with –SO3H loading of 4.5, 6.0 and 8.4%, they possess H2-type hysteresis loop appearing at a relative pressure (P/P 0) of 0.45–0.90, indicating that the pore channels in hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids are interconnected or disordered. In the case of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex, it has H1-type hysteresis loop positioning at a P/P 0 of 0.4–0.6, characteristic of the materials with well-ordered mesostructure and in line with TEM observation. From the result displayed in Fig. 4b it is found that either hollow spherical or periodic mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids exhibit narrow pore size distribution, reflecting their well-distributed pore size. The textural parameters of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids are summarized in Table 1. Three [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs possess large BET surface area, contributed from both hollow interior and external surface of hollow nanospheres; however, their BET surface area gradually decreases from 398, 313 to 232 m2 g−1 with increasing −SO3H loading from 4.5, 6.0 to 8.4%. The pore diameter of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs is in the range of 3.3 to 3.8 nm, originating from uniform hollow interior of the nanospheres. The [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs also exhibit high pore volume, reflecting their plentiful porous structure; similarly, the pore volume of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs is higher than [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs or [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs. Introduction of the −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3] groups to PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs may block some inner or external surface of the support, and thereby BET surface area and pore volume of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs decrease gradually with increasing −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3 −] loading. In addition, at similar loading level of −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3 −] group, periodic mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex possesses smaller BET surface area (264 m2 g−1) and lower pore volume (0.4 cm3 g−1) in comparison of its hollow spherical counterpart. 3.2.4 Thermal properties Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results of the representative samples including PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs support, [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs and [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs are presented in Fig. 5 , which provide interesting information related to their thermal stability. For the PrCl-Si(Et)Si support, it shows three weight loss steps. The first weight loss (0.5%) occurred below 100 °C is related to loss of physisorbed water; the second weight loss (3.2%) happened in 100–330 °C is attributed to decomposition of residual P123; and the last weight loss (20%) found in 330–800 °C is related to decomposition of organic components such as PrCl groups and ethyl-bridged organosilica framework. As for the [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, they show four weight loss steps. The first weight loss (2.9% for [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs and 3.5% for [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs) occurs below 100 °C, corresponding to the loss of physisorbed water. The second weight loss happens in 100–340 °C (9.4% for [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs and 9.8% for [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs), attributing to decomposition of residual P123 and imidazole. The third weight loss (12.3% for [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs and 23.4% for [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs) appears in 340–450 °C, originating from the decomposition of −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3] groups in the nanohybrids. The weight loss in this step is proportion to the loading of −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3] groups. The last weight loss (7.5% for [C3Im][CF3SO3H]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs and 7.2% for [C3Im][CF3SO 3 H]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs) takes place in 450–800 °C, on account of decomposition of ethyl-bridged organosilica framework. On the basis of the above discussion, the total weight loss during heating the samples in air from room temperature to 800 °C is 23.7, 32.1 and 43.9%, respectively, for PrCl-Si(Et)Si HNSs, [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs and [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs, which is closely related to their composition; additionally, the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs are thermally stable below 340 °C. 3.2.5 Brønsted acidity The Brønsted acid strength and acid site density of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs are measured by nonaqueous potentiometric titration with n-butylamine in acetonitrile (Table 1). In this method, the initial electrode potential (E i) indicates the maximum acid strength of surface site, and the material with E i value higher than 100 mV is defined as the very strong solid acid [25,26,36]. The measured E i values of various [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids are similar, and they are in the range of 583 to 617 mV, regardless of their morphological characteristics. The result clearly indicates the super strong Brønsted acidity of as-prepared [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs nanohybrids. The determined Brønsted acid site density of aforementioned four samples are 541, 751, 1060 and 796 μeq(H+) g−1, in line with their –SO3H loading."
8,Catalytic tests,"3.3 Catalytic tests 3.3.1 Evaluation of catalytic activity and selectivity The heterogeneous acid catalytic behaviors of as-prepared [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs are studied by esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol in toluene as a simulated pyrolysis biofuel. In order to obtain the highest acetic acid removal efficiency and benzyl acetate yield simultaneously, impact of the key experimental parameters including benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio, reaction temperature and water addition is firstly considered by selecting the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs as the representative catalyst. Fig. 6 a displays the dependence of acetic acid esterification over [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs on benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio (nBA:nAA) revealed by the yield of benzyl acetate. Under either excessive acetic acid or benzyl alcohol condition, relatively higher benzyl acetate yield is obtained as compared with stoichiometric condition. For instance, after [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol performs for 120 min, the benzyl acetate yield reaches 89.0, 78.2, 72.0 and 95.1%, respectively, at benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio of 1:3, 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1. The above result is explained that esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol is an equilibrium limitation reaction, and excessive acetic acid or benzyl alcohol can help to complete the esterification process. Afterwards, at reaction time of 120 min, influence of benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio on conversion of benzyl alcohol, yield of benzyl acetate and selectivity to benzyl acetate is studied, and the result is shown in Fig. 6b. Changing benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio from 1:3, 1:2 to 1:1, conversion of benzyl alcohol decreases from 91.0, 82.7 to 77.0%, respectively, originating from the gradually decreased acetic acid content in the reaction media. However, the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs shows extremely high selectivity to benzyl acetate (97.8, 94.5 and 93.5% for benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio of 1:3, 1:2 and 1:1), regardless of benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio. This extremely high selectivity ensures them high benzyl acetate yield. The excellent selectivity of the tested catalyst is supported by GC-MS analysis result presented in Fig. S2, showing that only trace side products including diphenyl ether (retention time of 22.63 min), monobenzyltoluene (retention time of 21.18 min) and benzyltoluene (retention time of 21.32 min) are formed in current catalytic system. Diphenyl ether is produced by acid-catalyzed etherification of benzyl alcohol, while monobenzyltoluene and benzyltoluene are yielded from acid-catalyzed condensation of benzyl alcohol with toluene (Scheme S1). Since acetic acid is commonly in excess in real pyrolysis biofuels; meanwhile, acetic acid is cheaper than benzyl alcohol, in subsequent catalytic tests, the benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio is set at 1:3 on the basis of the above results, which can ensure to reduce the acidity and oxygen content of crude pyrolysis biofuels and to produce value added benzyl acetate with high yield simultaneously. Reaction temperature is another important parameter that influences the yield of benzyl acetate, here, the influence of reaction temperature on acetic acid esterification over [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs is explored. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the esterification reaction rate increases significantly as increasing the reaction temperature from 80 to 100 °C, for example, after the reaction proceeds for 120 min, the yield of benzyl acetate increases from 74.9 (80 °C) to 89.0% (100 °C). This is due to the fact that one of the reaction product-water can continuously escape from the reaction system through evaporation when the reaction performs at 100 °C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 110 °C (boiling point of benzyl alcohol), only slightly increased reaction rate is observed, corresponding to the production of 93.0% of benzyl acetate over period of 120 min. The result indicates that water yielded during the process of esterification of acetic acid could be effectively removed from the reaction system at 100 °C, ensuring extremely high yield of benzyl acetate. In the subsequent catalytic tests, the reaction temperature is set at 100 °C. Crude pyrolysis biofuels generally contain plenty of water, and therefore water tolerance is a dominant requirement for the solid acid catalysts in esterification of acetic acid under aqueous environment. In order to evaluate water tolerance of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, 50 mol% water relative to benzyl alcohol is added to the catalytic system before the reaction starts. As shown in Fig. 7b, the representative catalyst, [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs, exhibits perfect water tolerance, and high level of water has no influence on the yield of benzyl acetate. For instant, after the reaction proceeds for 120 min, the yield of benzyl acetate is 90% in the presence of 50 mol% water, in line with water-free system. This unique property is attributed to the presence of hydrophobic ethyl-bridged organosilica framework in [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, which can prevent water molecules from contacting with the catalyst surface and thereby suppressing hydrolysis of the produced benzyl acetate completely. Accordingly, the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs exhibit potential for real crude pyrolysis biofuel upgrading. As for the previously reported propylsulfonic acid functionalized SBA-15-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol in the presence of 40 mol% water (relative to benzyl alcohol), it was found overall conversion decreased from 100 (water free system) to 60% after the reaction proceeded for 5 h, originating from displacement of the reaction equilibrium towards the reverse hydrolysis by water because of lack of hydrophobic units in the catalyst [16]. Subsequently, at benzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio of 1:3, the esterification activity of various [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids and reference acids is compared at 100 °C in toluene solvent. Fig. 8 a gives the esterification activity of the tested catalysts revealed by the yield of benzyl acetate, and negligible autocatalytic contribution (2.7%) is found in catalyst-free system. For three hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids, their esterification activity is related to −SO3H loading: [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs with the lowest −SO3H group loading exhibits the lowest benzyl acetate yield, while the activity of [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs is slightly higher than [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs. For example, over period of 120 min, the yield of benzyl acetate reaches 68.0 ([C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs), 89.0 ([C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs) and 90.2% ([C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs), respectively. As for periodic mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex, it shows considerably lower esterification activity (benzyl acetate yield of 65.5%) in comparison with its hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs counterpart. The result indicates that esterification activity of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids is obviously influenced by their morphological characteristics. In the case of homogeneous p-toluenesulfonic acid, it exhibits extremely high esterification activity, and the yield of benzyl acetate reaches nearly 100% after the reaction performs for only 60 min. This is attributed to its super strong Brønsted acid strength (E i value of 618.2 eV [11]), very high acid site density (6846 μeq(H+) g−1 [11]) and fast mass transfer of the reactants and products to and from the acid sites. However, employment of p-toluenesulfonic acid in industry often faces to the problems of waste generation, equipment corrosion and recycling difficulty, leading to it poor competitiveness with respect to solid acid catalysts. Under the aforementioned experimental conditions, commercially available solid acid catalysts, Amberlyst-15 resin and HY zeolite, are also tested. As shown in Fig. 8b, Amberlyst-15-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid exhibits high conversion of benzyl alcohol, and it reaches to ca. 100% after the reaction proceeds for 120 min. However, the yield of benzyl acetate is very low, and it reaches the highest value (21.0%) after the reaction proceeds for 90 min, and then the yield begins to decrease gradually. The result reflects poor selectivity of Amberlyst-15 to benzyl acetate in toluene solvent. Through GC-MS analysis (Fig. S3a) it is found that considerable amount of undesired diphenyl ether (retention time of 16.52 min), monobenzyltoluene (retention time of 15.11 min) and benzyltoluene (retention time of 15.26 min) yielded in Amberlyst-15/toluene system, whereas the produced benzyl acetate (retention time of 10.03 min) is obviously reduced. As for HY-catalyzed esterification reaction, conversion of benzyl alcohol is very low, and it reaches only 18.2% after the reaction proceeds for 120 min; meanwhile, negligible benzyl acetate is yielded. Based on the above results, conversion and selectivity of as-prepared hollow spherical and mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids and reference acid catalysts in the esterification reaction of benzyl alcohol with acetic acid in toluene solvent are summarized in Table S1 for comparison. Considering difference of acid site densities among the tested catalysts, their esterification activity is further compared by TOF values, which can reflect the intrinsic activity of acid site more actually. Herein, TOF values are calculated from the linear portion of the initial reaction rate profile for the benzyl acetate yields, which are normalized by acid site densities. As shown in Fig. 8c, the catalysts follow TOF value (min−1) order [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs (2.7) > [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex (1.9) > p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.98) > Amberlyst-15 (0.13). The result indicates that [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs exhibit the highest esterification activity revealed by TOF value, and its TOF value is higher than its periodic mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex counterpart. Lower TOF value of p-toluenesulfonic acid is due to its extremely high Brønsted acid site density. Subsequently, in order to evaluate influence of toluene solvent on the catalytic activity of various solid acids, esterification activity of [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs, Amberlyst-15 and HY is also studied in toluene-free system (Fig. 8d). In comparison of the activity in toluene system, the yield of benzyl acetate contributed from autocatalysis has an obvious increase, and it reaches 31.8% after the reaction proceeds for 120 min. The esterification activity of HY zeolite is similar to autocatalysis, implying that HY zeolite is still inactive in toluene-free system. Poor esterification activity of HY zeolite is due to its microporous structure (pore dimension of 0.53 nm × 0.56 nm), which limits the accessibility of bulky benzyl alcohol molecules to acid sites; meanwhile, severe diffusion hindrance exists in this system. The esterification activity of [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs remains unchangeable in the presence or absence of toluene. For example, after the reaction proceeds for 120 min, the yield of benzyl acetate reaches 87.0% in toluene-free system. In the case of Amberlyst-15-catalyzed esterification reaction, significantly increased benzyl acetate yield (73.4%) is observed as compared with that in toluene system. In order to explore the excellent esterification activity of Amberlyst-15 in toluene-free system, GC-MS analysis result is provided in Fig. S3b. It demonstrates that the main side products such as monobenzyltoluene and benzyltoluene yielded in Amberlyst-15/toluene esterification system are not found in toluene-free system, resulting in significantly enhanced benzyl acetate yield. However, another side product, diphenyl ether (retention time of 16.54 min), still exists in not a few amount. The significant esterification activity difference of Amberlyst-15 in the presence and absence of toluene is explained as follows. When Amberlyst-15-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol occurs in a toluene solution, Amberlyst-15 is swollen by plentiful of toluene, resulting in high affinity of resin to toluene and benzyl alcohol rather than acetic acid. Accordingly, both Amberlyst-15-catalyzed condensations of toluene with benzyl alcohol to produce monobenzyltoluene and benzyltoluene as well as etherification of benzyl alcohol to yield diphenyl ether take place preferably in comparison of esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol. Activation of carbonyl group of acetate acid is a key step of the esterification reaction [37], however, this step is greatly inhibited in toluene system, leading to poor selectivity of Amberlyst-15 to benzyl acetate and thereby extremely low yield of benzyl acetate. The result suggests that Amberlyst-15 resin is unsuitable for crude pyrolysis biofuel upgrading through esterification of acetic acid. On the basis of the above catalytic testing results it is inferred that hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids with suitable acidic IL loading are promising alternatives to hazardous liquid acids and some commercially available solid acids employed in crude pyrolysis biofuel upgrading through esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol, and their Brønsted acid strength, acid site density, morphology/textural properties and surface hydrophobicity are the key parameters for their excellent esterification activity. At first, the inherent strong Brønsted acid nature of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs plays the dominated role in effective esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol to produce benzyl acetate because the protonation of carbonyl groups of acetic acid molecules by acidic ILs is the first step of the reaction. Additionally, the morphological characteristics of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs nanohybrids significantly impact their esterification activity. On the one hand, hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids with extremely small particle size, thin and permeable shells allow the guest molecules (e.g., acetic acid and benzyl alcohol) to diffuse into the interior of hollow nanospheres, and the spheres serve as the nanoreactors to provide acid site-confined space for esterification reaction. As a consequence, the diffusion distance of the reactants and products is shortened, leading to efficient mass transfer and improved substrate accessibility to acidic ILs. Moreover, the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs with 3D nanostructures can further accelerate the reactant/product diffusion to/from acid sites and enable facile mass transport as compared with their 2D mesoporous counterparts. On the other hand, unique hollow nanostructures of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs can provide plentiful external and internal surface, giving rise to them excellent textural properties including large BET surface area and high pore volume and thereby high population of acid sites. Both factors paly the important role to the excellent esterification activity of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs nanohybrids. Among three hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs with different –SO3H loadings, the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si4.5 HNSs possesses the largest BET surface area and highest pore volume, its lowest esterification activity is due to the lowest Brønsted acid site density (541 μeq(H+) g−1). Although [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si8.4 HNSs has the highest Brønsted acid site density (1060 μeq(H+) g−1), its smallest BET surface area and lowest pore volume lead to it similar esterification activity to that of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs. The result indicates that both Brønsted acid site density and textural properties of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids influence their esterification activity, and the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs with excellent textural properties and suitable number of Brønsted acid site density exhibits considerably high esterification activity. Periodic mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex has similar Brønsted acid strength (593 eV) and acid site density (796 μeq(H+) g−1) to those of its hollow spherical counterparts [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs (611 eV, 751 μeq(H+) g−1), and its obviously lower esterification activity than [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs originates from following two factors. On the one hand, 2D periodic mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex has long pore channels, and the diffusion distance of the reactant/product to/from acid sites is lengthened. As a consequence, mass transport of the reactant/product may decelerate in some extent. On the other hand, the BET surface area/pore volume of mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.5-2Dhex is smaller/lower than those of hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs, giving rise to lower population of acid sites. Therefore, it is inferred that the morphological characteristics of organosilica-based acidic ILs can greatly influence their catalytic activity. Finally, owing to the presence of hydrophobic bridging ethyl groups in silicon/carbon framework of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs, the surface of the nanohybrids is hydrophobic. The role of the hydrophobic surface is to prevent the contact of the nanohybrids from water produced during the esterification and pyrolysis processes, and therefore the reversible hydrolysis of benzyl acetate reaction is suppressed greatly. This is also a crucial factor that ensures esterification of acetic acid proceeding at fast reaction rate. 3.3.2 Evaluation of catalytic stability and reusability Catalytic stability and reusability can be envisaged as a significant challenge for the potential applications of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs in crude pyrolysis biofuel upgrading. Here, the stability and reusability of the representative [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs is studied in a simulated pyrolysis biofuel environment. At first, in order to check esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol occurs heterogeneously, a hot filtration test is undertaken. After the reaction proceeds for 30 min, the catalyst powder is removed by hot filtration, and then the reaction continues. As displayed in Fig. 9 a, the reaction stops after 30 min, and the yield of benzyl acetate is 50.6 and 54.1%, respectively, after the reaction proceeds for 30 and 120 min. The result indicates that no catalytically active −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3 −] units remain in the filtrate, highlighting the excellent catalytic stability of hollow spherical organosilica-based ILs under the reaction conditions studied. The excellent catalytic stability of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs originates from chemical interactions (quaternary ammonization) between the acidic ILs and chloropropyl functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres via imidazole linker. Subsequently, the reusability of the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs is evaluated by recycling it for three times, and the spent catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and then washed completely by dichloromethane. As shown in Fig. 9b, the yield of benzyl acetate is 89.7, 82.0 and 70.1%, respectively, for the first, second and third cycle after the reaction proceeds for 2 h. To analyze the reasons of somewhat activity loss, 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum of the spent [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs was provided. As shown in Fig. 9c, 13C CP-MAS NMR exhibits all characteristic signals concerning about various carbon species existed in the nanohybrids, and they are carbon species from bridging ethyl units, chloropropyl groups, imidazole and −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3 −] groups. The result indicates that the chemical structure of [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs remains intact after the reaction. More importantly, any adsorption of reactants, products or byproducts is hardly found in this spent catalyst, giving rise to the important contribution to its excellent catalytic stability. Additionally, after three time’s catalytic cycles, the concentrations of sulfur in [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HNSs-free reaction solution was determined by ICP-OES after the solution was digested by dilute HNO3. It is found that leaching of −[PrSO3H][SO3CF3 −] groups from the support into the reaction media is little (1.8%). Finally, the used [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si6.0 HSNs still exhibits perfect hollow spherical nanostructures (Fig. 9d), which is another reason ensures the nanohybrids excellent reusability. Therefore, activity loss of the catalyst during recycling processes is possibly due to loss of some catalyst powder by washing with dichloromethane."
9,Conclusion,"Hollow spherical [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si nanohybrids are successfully prepared by chemical bonding Brønsted acidic ionic liquids on imidazole functionalized organosilica hollow nanospheres. The [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs exhibit excellent catalytic performance in esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol in toluene solvent, which are explained by the following points. A first, the inherent strong Brønsted acid nature of [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs plays the dominated role to facilitate esterification of acetic acid proceeding at a fast rate, and the acid site density of the nanohybrids influence esterification activity. Additionally, [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs with thin and permeable shells as well as high population of acid sites can serve as nanoreactors to provide acid site-confined space for the esterification reaction, which can shorten the diffusion distance of the reactants and products and thereby efficient mass transfer and improved substrate accessibility to acidic ILs. Finally, surface hydrophobicity of the nanohybrids can prevent their contact from water produced during pyrolysis and esterification processes, and therefore reversible hydrolysis of benzyl acetate is suppressed greatly. Importantly, the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs show high catalytic stability and reusability under current reaction conditions, and they are promising alternatives to hazardous liquid acids employed in pyrolysis biofuel upgrading through esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol."
