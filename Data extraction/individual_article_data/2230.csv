0,Introduction,"The conversion of a primary alcohol to the corresponding carboxylic acid is a fundamental organic process [1,2]. Conventionally, this process can be realized by the direct oxidation of alcohols applying an additional oxidant [3]. However, large amounts of toxic or strong oxidants are generally required and stoichiometric by-products are usually produced [4–6]. Despite the occasional use of oxygen as a mild oxidant [7–17], high oxygen pressure might be problematic and air-sensitive alcohols are not well tolerated. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop green and sustainable strategies for carboxylic acid production. In recent years, the transition metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols to carboxylic acids under oxidant-free conditions has been spotted as a green and sustainable transformation. Due to the release of dihydrogen as the only by-product, this catalytic process features high atom economy and environmental friendliness, showing an attractive prospect for practical applications. Inspired by the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of alcohols and water with the assistance of a hydrogen acceptor [18–20], the Milstein group accomplished the acceptorless version of this catalysis based on their great achievements in catalytic dehydrogenative reactions [21]. With one of their well-known pincer-type Ru complexes in an aqueous NaOH solution, a handful of primary alcohols were efficiently transformed into carboxylic acids without any hydrogen acceptor [22]. Subsequently, other noble metal-based catalytic systems including Ru- [23–36], Rh- [37], Pd- [38], Ir- [39–42], and Ag-based [43] ones have also been developed. Due to the limited global availability and relatively high costs of these noble metals, several earth-abundant metal catalysts such as Fe [44], Mn [44,45], Zn [46] and Co [47] catalysts have been reported for this dehydrogenation. However, only a few noble metal-based catalytic systems were recycled, with the reported recycle rounds no more than five [26,29,38]. In particular, all the reported catalytic systems for this transformation were summarized in Table S1. Therefore, the discovery of new efficient earth-abundant metal catalysts with outstanding recyclability is still in high demand. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a unique subclass of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with their bridging angles similar to that of the Si–O–Si bond in zeolite materials [48,49]. Metal ions (Zn, Co, Mn, etc.) bridging with imidazole anions resulted in various ZIFs bearing high porosity and moderate stability. Therefore, the high-temperature treatment of ZIFs (pyrolysis) led to the corresponding metal/metal oxides embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon (M@NC) with improved stability [50–53]. These materials have been mainly used as active catalysts for electrochemical reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [54–56]. Besides, M@NC could also be beneficial for organic reactions as heterogeneous catalysts. Since the carbon matrix prohibited the agglomeration of metal/metal oxide species during the synthetic process, dispersed metal species could be obtained for these pyrolyzed materials. Therefore, the high metal dispersion triggered small and uniform metal/metal oxide nanoparticles, which could be regarded as active catalytic sites. Moreover, nitrogen-doped carbon materials derived from the decomposition of the imidazole linker provided an additional site (basicity), which could promote catalytic performance for various transformations [54,57–59]. With M@NC as a catalyst, the carbon layer could protect the active center (the metal/metal oxides) during the catalysis, which is meaningful to improve the catalyst stability. In practice, Co-based materials have been widely utilized as catalysts in various organic transformations [59–69]. Concerning the above-mentioned merits of the ZIF-derived materials as catalysts and the capability of Co-based materials in activating alcohols under dehydrogenative conditions [60,64], we thereby intend to report the first Co-based carbon material, a robust heterogeneous catalyst, for the alcohol dehydrogenation to carboxylic acids (as depicted in Fig. 1 ). The pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) afforded cobalt dispersed in the nitrogen-functionalized carbon matrix (Co@NC), which illustrated the first example of utilizing MOF-derived materials for this transformation. Notably, the fabricated Co@NC could be recycled up to 15 times without activity decay. Moreover, our catalyst is advantageous in terms of the facile synthetic procedure and practical recycling technique. Further mechanistic investigations illustrated the unique porous structure, the dispersed Co species within the N-doped carbon matrix and the active sites in Co@NC. Finally, a key intermediate (an aldehyde) was confirmed and two possible pathways were suggested for this catalysis."
1,Experimental,
2,General information,"2.1 General information All starting materials and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. The size and morphology of the materials were conducted on scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA3) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2F30), and the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analysis was performed on an EDAX Genesis instrument. The crystallinity was analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer applying a Cu Kα radiation source. Raman analyses were conducted on a RENISHAW Raman microscope. The surface areas and pore sizes were calculated by the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method, with N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Fischer ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Prodigy 7) analyses were performed to obtain the Co amounts in ZIF-67, fresh and recycled Co@NC. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer in CDCl3, DMSO‑d 6 or D2O with/without TMS as the internal reference, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, DMSO‑d 6 or D2O on a Bruker Avance 500 (126 MHz) spectrometer. The following abbreviations were used to designate multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, sept = septet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet of doublets, tt = triplet of triplets, dd = double of doublets of doublets."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of ZIF-67. 2-Methylimidazole (2-MIM, 1.32 g, 16.0 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (25 mL) at room temperature under ultrasound for 5 min, and the resultant solution was added to a solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.58 g, 2.0 mmol) in methanol (25 mL). The dispersion was then stirred at the same temperature for 24 h. The precipitated product was separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min and washed with methanol for three times. The solid product was dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight to afford ZIF-67 as a purple powder. Synthesis of Co@NC. The newly synthesized ZIF-67 was placed in a tube furnace under the flow of 5% H2 in argon. The heating rate was 1 °C min−1 from room temperature to 70 °C, followed by 10 °C min−1 from 70 °C to 600 °C. Subsequently, the temperature was held at 600 °C for 2 h, and the sample was then naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain the final product (Co@NC) as a black powder."
4,Catalytic reactions,"2.3 Catalytic reactions General procedure for the Co@NC catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of an alcohol and KOH. To a 25 mL Schlenk tube was added Co@NC (19.8 mg, 20 mol% of Co), benzyl alcohol (52 μL, 0.5 mmol), KOH (33.7 mg, 0.6 mmol) and mesitylene (0.5 mL). Then the mixture was stirred at reflux under an open argon flow for 24 h, and the tube was then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was washed with water (2 mL) once and then three times with methanol (2 mL) using an external magnetic field to separate the catalyst. The methanol solution was concentrated and the resultant residue was combined with the water layer. Subsequently, the resultant aqueous solution was acidified with 3 N HCl solution (around 0.5 mL) until pH 2 for most cases, and the solution was then transferred to a separation funnel with a small amount of water and ethyl acetate. Afterwards, the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. Then 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (0.5 mmol, 84.0 mg) and CDCl3 (1.0 mL) were added, and 0.5 mL of the above solution was added to an NMR tube. The NMR yields were calculated based on the exact amount of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene. Moreover, the isolation of all the acid products followed our previous work [34]."
5,Catalyst recycling,"2.4 Catalyst recycling The recyclability of Co@NC, CoO, Co powder or Co + C was tested for the dehydrogenative coupling of 1a and KOH maintaining the same reaction conditions as described above, except for using the recovered catalyst. At each end of the catalytic reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by magnetic separation, washed once with water, three times with methanol, and then placed under vacuum for 15 min to ensure that the solvent was completely removed before reuse. The recycled catalyst was subjected to the dehydrogenation of 1a to 2a, and the recycling process repeated until the catalytic activity was obviously decreased."
6,Results and discussion,"As our purpose, the pyrolyzed ZIF-67 material was selected as the desired catalyst in this study. Our research commenced with the synthesis of ZIF-67 as the template material, and the room-temperature synthetic method was adopted as a sustainable and environmentally-benign route. Subsequently, the thermal treatment of ZIF-67 afforded Co@NC under a controlled atmosphere. With the prepared Co@NC as a heterogeneous catalyst, a representative reaction of benzyl alcohol (1a) and KOH was initially chosen to optimize the reaction conditions (as listed in Table 1 ). At the outset, 9.9 mg of Co@NC (based on 10 mol% of Co) in refluxing toluene led to 18% of benzoic acid (2a) and 75% of unreacted 1a (entry 1). Different solvents such as m-xylene, mesitylene, THF and 1,4-dioxane at their refluxing temperatures were also attempted (entries 2–5). If the reaction was performed in refluxing m-xylene, an enhanced yield of 2a was detected (entry 2 vs. entry 1). Replacing m-xylene with mesitylene and performing the reaction at an elaborated temperature resulted in a considerably higher yield of 2a (entry 3 vs. entry 2). THF and 1,4-dioxane were noticed to be less effective than mesitylene (entries 4–5 vs. entry 3). Therefore, refluxing mesitylene was optimal and various hydroxides were then screened (entries 6–7). It seemed that LiOH could not efficiently navigate this reaction (entry 6), whereas NaOH showed a marginally reduced yield than KOH (entry 7 vs. entry 3). It was concluded that KOH still manifested the best result, providing 2a in a 69% yield (entry 3). It appeared that longer reaction time and a higher catalyst loading stimulated the carboxylic acid formation, which afforded 2a in an 85% yield (entry 8). Next, different amounts of mesitylene were utilized, recognizing 0.5 mL as the optimized volume (entries 8–10). To demonstrate the advantages of our synthesized Co@NC, CoO, ZIF-67, Co powder as well as a combination of Co powder and activated carbon (Co + C) were selected for comparative studies under the same cobalt loading (entries 9, 11–14). To our delight, both fresh and recycled Co@NC showed excellent activity (entry 9). In the case of CoO, a moderate yield (53%) of 2a was detected for the first run, and a dramatically reduced yield of 33% was obtained for the second run (entry 11). ZIF-67 could afford 2a in a 51% yield, but very few amounts of the catalyst could be recovered after the reaction (entry 12). Except Co2+ species, Co powder (Co0) was also attempted. The result implied that a 54% yield of 2a was obtained for the first run, while a reduced yield of 45% was generated for the second run (entry 13). Co + C gave rise to 2a in 72% yield, but the yield of 2a dropped to 62% applying the recycled catalyst (entry 14). In the absence of a catalyst, only 5% of the desired product (2a) was yielded, with the majority of 1a remaining (entry 15). Moreover, different Co@NC dosages were screened, with 19.8 mg being identified as the optimum amount (as shown in Figure S1 of the supporting information). In addition, the effect of heating temperature was evaluated, and the refluxing temperature (165 °C) provided the highest yield (as listed in Table S2 of the supporting information). Therefore, the optimized parameters, recognized as 19.8 mg of Co@NC (20 mol% of Co), 1.00 equiv. of 1a and 1.20 equiv. of KOH in refluxing mesitylene for 24 h (as listed in entry 9 of Table 1), were used for further investigations. After the reaction conditions were optimized, the generality of this Co@NC catalyzed protocol was thoroughly explored (as depicted in Fig. 2 ). Various primary alcohols were subjected to the dehydrogenative coupling, affording a number of carboxylic acids in up to 95% yields. Similar to 1a, electron-rich benzyl alcohols 1b and 1c also reacted smoothly with KOH to give acids 2b and 2c in high yields. With regard to the electron-deficient counterparts (1d-1f), considerably lower yields (36–46%) of acids 2d-2f were obtained. It appeared that the substituent positions slightly influenced the yields of the products. Under the optimal conditions, 3-methylbenzoic acid (2g) and 2-methylbenzoic acid (2h) were synthesized in 83% and 77% yields, respectively. Moreover, diphenyl-containing substrate 1i, polyaromatic substrate 1j, and sulfur-containing alcohol 1k were also efficiently converted into the corresponding acid products. Our catalyst was also applicable for heteroaromatic alcohols 1l and 1m, which reacted smoothly with KOH to deliver acids 2l and 2m in good yields. Next to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols were also tested at a longer reaction period of 36 h. Sterically unhindered aliphatic alcohols including 3-phenylpropan-1-ol (1n), cinnamyl alcohol (1o), n-octanol (1p) and cyclohexyl methanol (1q) were well tolerated. It was also worth mentioning that 1o bearing an internal double bond yielded the reduced product (2n) in a 50% yield, without any observation of the expected product (2o). In addition, treatment of 1-adamantanemethanol (1r, a bulky substrate) with KOH furnished acid 2r in a 68% yield, while heterocycle-containing alcohol 1s was efficiently converted to the desired product (2s). Finally, amino alcohols 1t-1u were successfully transformed into the corresponding amino acids (2t-2u) in 58–70% yields. Since the recycling performance is of vital significance for a heterogeneous catalyst, the recyclability of Co@NC was also examined (as depicted in Fig. 3 ). The sustainable coupling of benzyl alcohol (1a) and KOH under the optimized conditions was selected for the recycling experiments. After the reaction was completed, catalyst recovery was simply realized by an external magnet (as illustrated in Fig. 3a). Subsequently, the recovered catalyst was washed with water (once) and methanol (three times) to remove the impurities and then dried under vacuum to evaporate the solvents adsorbed in the recovered catalyst. The recycling process was continued for fifteen times without obvious loss of its catalytic activity, which revealed the remarkable recyclability of our catalyst (as shown in Fig. 3b). It was also worth mentioning that no special process was required to activate the catalyst for the second or even more cycles, which indicated the potential of our catalyst for practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, our catalyst can be considered as the most recyclable catalyst ever reported for this transformation [26,29,38]. To get insights into the reason for the catalytic activity of Co@NC, a series of techniques were performed to explore the properties of the catalyst. The regular rhombic dodecahedron morphologies in the range of 300–400 nm were observed for the as-synthesized ZIF-67 by SEM (as shown in Fig. 4 a). Different from the smooth surface of ZIF-67, the pyrolyzed ZIF-67 (Co@NC) possessed a rough and shrank surface (Fig. 4b). To explore the morphology of the Co elements in the carbon matrix, TEM was also performed. The carbon layer was covered on the Co species as a shell layer, thus indicating that Co was embedded in a carbon matrix, in accordance with the other pyrolyzed ZIF-67 in the literature [57,70,71]. Moreover, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were observed as a mixture of carbon materials (Fig. 4b and c), and the well-dispersion of cobalt was found on Co@NC via TEM images (Fig. 4c and d). For the recycled catalyst, similar properties were observed (Figure S2 vs. Fig. 4c and d). The EDX elemental mapping images further revealed the homogeneous spatial distribution of N and Co elements throughout the whole catalyst for both fresh and recycled catalysts (Figure S3). Further characterization for the porosity of the materials was evaluated via nitrogen adsorption at 77K. The template ZIF-67 originally revealed the isotherm type I of N2 adsorption-desorption measurement, which indicated the microporous property of ZIF-67 (Figure S4). The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) specific surface area, the pore volume and the pore size of ZIF-67 were determined as 1888 m2 g−1, 0.71 cm3 g−1 and 1.25 nm, respectively (Table S3), which confirmed the microporous property and high porosity on ZIF-67. However, compared with the ZIF-67 template, the surface area and pore volume of Co@NC significantly decreased (Table S3). Co@NC revealed the specific surface area and micro-pore volume of 257 m2 g−1 and 0.105 cm3 g−1, respectively. Additionally, the hysteresis loop was found in the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of Co@NC, which was generated from the condensation of liquid nitrogen in the mesoporous material during desorption (Fig. 4e). These results suggested the coexistence of micropores and mesopores in Co@NC. It could be mentioned that the high-temperature treatment broke down the three-dimensional channel structure of the ZIF-67 crystal, leading to a new porous structure in the pyrolyzed material (Co@NC). Especially, such a unique porous structure (a mixture of micropores and mesopores) could be considered as a significant chance for the enhanced transport (mass transfer of the substrate and product molecules) and exposure of the maximum active sites in the catalytic process. The crystallinity of the synthesized materials was analyzed by powder XRD. The XRD pattern of the templated ZIF-67 revealed sharp peaks, which identically matched the simulated crystal structure of ZIF-67 (Figure S5). The crystal decomposition of ZIF-67 to Co@NC was confirmed via the disappearance of their identical XRD pattern (Fig. 5 ). After pyrolysis, the XRD pattern showed a broad peak at 22.0°, which could be assigned to a typical (002) interlayer of graphite-type carbon sheets, and the three additional peaks at 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.8° were assigned to the well-crystallized Co (111), (200) and (220) with a face-centered cubic structure (JCPDS no. 15–0806) [72]. On the other hand, no significant change was found from the XRD patterns of the fresh and recycled Co@NC (Figure S6). In addition, Raman analyses were carried out to disclose the graphitization degree of both fresh and recycled catalysts (Fig. 6 ). For both catalysts, the characteristic D band at 1340 cm−1 are derived from disordered or defect carbon, while the representative G band at 1590 cm−1 are related to the graphitic sp2-carbon [56]. The ID/IG values of fresh and used materials were almost identical, indicating that the fresh Co@NC did not undergo obvious change after the reaction (Fig. 6a vs. 6b). Moreover, the appearance of the 2D band indicated that graphitic structures were well developed in both fresh and recycled Co@NC [73]. These results confirmed the activity and stability of Co@NC for the catalyst application. The element composition and oxidation states of Co@NC were further characterized to gain insight into possible catalytic species. The Co contents of the materials were measured by ICP-OES (as listed in Table S4). Co@NC contained a higher cobalt content (30.0%) than ZIF-67 (27.8%), which could be attributed to the decomposition of organic species (e.g. 2-methylimidazole) in ZIF-67 during the pyrolysis process. Furthermore, the Co content of the recycled Co@NC was also determined as a decreased value of 25.5%, which was probably due to the partial leaching of Co species and/or the partial oxidation of Co0 during the recycling process. To rationalize this point, the electron configuration of the elements on Co@NC was characterized by XPS. It was found that Co, C, N, and O were basic elements in Co@NC (Fig. 7 and Figure S7). Firstly, the high-resolution C 1s spectra were obtained to check the chemical environments of carbon in both fresh and recycled Co@NC (Fig. 7a and b). It appeared that two main bands, corresponding to C–C at 284.4 eV and CN at 285.2 eV, were observed for both materials [56,69]. For the chemical states of the Co species, the binding energies of the Co 2p3/2 peaks at 781.6 eV, 780.1 eV, and 778.2 eV correspond to Co–N, Co–O and Co0 species, respectively (Fig. 7c and d) [68,74–76]. The corresponding Co 2p1/2 peaks are located at 797.2 eV, 795.3 eV, and 793.1 eV, respectively. Besides, the ratio of the Co–O and Co0 species was found to be the major difference between the Co 2p spectrum of the fresh catalyst and that of the recycled one (Fig. 7c vs. 7d). Presumably, the leaching of Co (the leaching of 0.27 mg Co was obtained from ICP analysis after reaction) and/or oxidation of Co0 by water during the catalyst recycling could be the reason for changing the oxidation states. Particularly, the binding energy of the nitrogen configuration was measured. No considerable difference was observed for both fresh and recycled Co@NC, with three major peaks at 398.5 eV, 399.9 eV, and 401.1 eV being assigned to the respective pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N species (Fig. 7e vs. 7f). These results illustrate that the Co–N species play a pivotal role in maintaining good activity and outstanding recyclability of our Co@NC catalyst. To probe the exact nature of the active sites for the carboxylic acid synthesis, we performed a poisoning test with potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) over Co@NC due to the strong affinity of SCN− with the Co surface [77,78]. In the presence of 16 equiv. of KSCN, the dehydrogenation of 1a to 2a was significantly (but not totally) inhibited (as listed in Table S5). From the literature, Co species was the major active site if the activity was totally lost. In contrast, N-doped carbon was the main active site if the activity was only slightly reduced [60]. Our phenomenon is between the above two situations, which implies that free N-doped porous carbon is another active site except for Co species. It was reported that doping nitrogen in carbon materials could regulate the physicochemical properties such as the Lewis-base property, hydrophilicity, and electronic structures [59,79,80]. Besides, nitrogen doping could also give rise to carbon-based materials integrated with metal-N sites [68,78]. According to the above catalytic results, characterization analysis, and related literature reports, we envisaged that the Co–N species was the most active site in Co@NC. Besides, the other cobalt species (e.g., the Co0, Co–O species) were also proposed as active sites with less activity or stability than the Co–N species, which was indicated by the moderate yield in the first run and the reduced yield in the second run for Co powder (Co0), CoO (Co2+) and ZIF-67 (Co2+) (as listed in entries 11–13 of Table 1). The obviously different Co–O/Co0 ratio and comparable Co–N content between the fresh and recycled catalysts gave rise to similar catalytic performance for the two catalysts, which further confirmed the above proposition for the Co-based active sites. In addition, the KSCN poisoning experiments implied that free N-doped carbon matrix was another minor active species. Generally, converting an alcohol into the corresponding carboxylic acid could be achieved via an aldehyde or ester intermediate [40,45,81], thus supplementary experiments were carried out to validate the possible reaction intermediate. Accordingly, we initially explored the product distribution at different reaction periods. In all the cases, only trace amounts of benzaldehyde (3a) and no formation of benzyl benzoate (4a) were observed (as listed in Table S6). Moreover, treatment of 3a or 4a with KOH was also performed under the Co@NC catalyzed conditions, which afforded benzoic acid (2a) in excellent yields for both reactions (Scheme 1 a-1b). Nevertheless, these results were unable to clearly distinguish between the above two intermediates. To our delight, benzyl alcohol (1a) was found to be exclusively transformed into aldehyde 3a under KOH-free conditions, without any observation of ester 4a (Scheme 1c), which obviously verified the involvement of an aldehyde intermediate in this catalytic process. It appeared that the reaction utilizing 3a as a reactant was much faster than that using 1a as a starting material (Scheme 1e vs. 1d). Presumably, in the presence of Co@NC, alcohol 1 was initially converted into aldehyde 3, which then reacted with KOH to finally yield carboxylic acid 2 after acid treatment. Furthermore, additional investigations were conducted to attain more information about converting the aldehyde intermediate into the acid product. It has been well documented that two molecules of an aldehyde can go through a Cannizzaro reaction to generate an alcohol and a carboxylate under basic conditions [27]. Therefore, product distribution at different reaction periods was monitored for the Co@NC catalyzed reaction of aldehyde 3a and KOH (as shown in Fig. 8 ). After 15 min, 3a was completed consumed, and a mixture of 2a (66%) and 1a (32%) were observed. As the reaction time was elongated, the yield of 2a steadily increased while those of 1a gradually decreased. These results implied that the Cannizzaro pathway was probably involved in our catalytic conditions, and the generated alcohol (2a) could be further transformed into the desired acid. Based on the above experiments, we suggested plausible pathways for this Co@NC catalyzed protocol (as shown in Scheme 2 ). At the beginning, alcohol 1 is dehydrogenated to aldehyde 3 via the catalysis of Co@NC. Subsequently, 3 reacts with KOH to generate intermediate I, which might undergo two possible pathways to yield desired product [2-H] - . In the presence of Co@NC, I eliminates another H2 molecule to directly afford [2-H] - (pathway 1). Alternatively, treatment of I with aldehyde 3 gives rise to [2-H] - and alcohol 1 via a Cannizzaro reaction (pathway 2). Finally, the resultant alcohol is further converted into [2-H] - in either of the two pathways, followed by the acid treatment of [2-H] - to provide acid 2."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, we have fabricated the non-noble metal/carbon composite material derived from ZIF-67 (Co@NC) as a robust heterogeneous catalyst for the efficient dehydrogenative coupling of a primary alcohol and KOH. With this Co@NC-catalyzed protocol, a handful of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols were successfully converted into the corresponding carboxylic acids. Gratifyingly, this Co@NC material could be reused for 15 times without considerable loss of its catalytic activity, and it could be easily recycled applying an external magnetic field without the necessity of catalyst activation before reuse. Several characterization techniques demonstrated that the high catalytic performance of Co@NC could be attributed to the homogeneous distribution of Co and N elements within the carbon matrix. Besides, the hierarchical porosity (micro-/meso-pores) can also facilitate the mass transfer for the substrate and product molecules. With regard to the active sites, the Co–N species is proposed as the most active site, while other Co species (e.g. Co–O, Co0) and free N-doped carbon matrix are also active sites, but probably with lower activity or stability than Co–N species. Furthermore, additional investigations suggested an aldehyde as a crucial intermediate and two possible pathways for this catalytic process. Hopefully, the present work could open up a simple, cost-effective, environmentally friendly and sustainable procedure for the preparation of various carboxylic acids from primary alcohols and KOH."
