0,Introduction,"Based on a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the entire transportation industry emits 6.7 Gt CO2 per year, of which the share of the aviation industry is 2%, growing by more than 6% over the past decade. Climate change mitigation and energy security are core elements in the current European policy. The 2030 climate and energy framework includes EU-wide targets and policy objectives for the period from 2021 to 2030. The principal goals for 2030 are 1) at least 40% cuts in greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions below 1990 levels. For this, the European emissions trading system (EU ETS) sectors, including air transport (intra-European and international flights), will have to cut emissions by 43% (compared to 2005), 2) at least 32% share for renewable energy and 3) 32.5% improvement in energy efficiency [1,2]. The most significant European low-cost airline recorded in 2018, 130 million passengers transported and GHG emissions of 9.9 Mt, 6.9% more than the average in 2017, and 49% more than in the last five years. According to the EU emissions trading register, this airline has become the first company not involved in coal combustion included in the top 10 carbon emitters in Europe. Various methods have been proposed to reduce CO2 emissions and petroleum-derived fuel dependency. Advances in the efficiency of the turbine and air traffic management might reduce emissions by approximately 0.8% per year up to 2050, corresponding to a total reduction of around 15% from 2015. Still, these reductions are expected to be not enough to compensate for the projected increase in the number of passengers. Hence, a substantial reduction could be achieved from the production of alternative jet fuels (AJF) [3]. Even though some alternative fuels for land transport have already reached an advanced stage of development, such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, or even hydrogen [4], none of them are viable for aviation use [5]. Recent research has developed several pathways to AJF production with low GHG emissions. These AJF need to fulfill the specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for aviation fuels as well as its blends with the so-called “drop-in” jet fuel [6], to guarantee proper combustion, allow a generalized availability and meet numerous safety, transport, storage, and pumping requirements [7]. Four of the five ASTM approved routes produce an AJF composed exclusively of paraffinic hydrocarbons (linear, branched, and cyclic), known as synthesized paraffinic kerosene (SPK). According to the ASTM specifications, the SPK must be blended with the petroleum-derived jet fuel, between 10 and 50 vol%, depending on the selected conversion route [8]. Finally, the fifth route is a combination of the paraffinic and aromatic compounds, known as SPK plus aromatics (SPK/A). Even though the SPK/A and the conventional jet fuel have a similar composition, a 50 vol% blend is mandatory to use it. The ASTM pathways include hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) from vegetable oils and animal fats; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (both FT-SPK and FT-SKA) through gasification and catalytic synthesis to obtain a wide range of hydrocarbons; Alcohol to Jet (ATJ-SPK) also called alcohol oligomerization; and Synthetic Isoparaffins (SIP-SPK), or fermented carbohydrates [9–11]. This study is focused on the ATJ-SPK pathway, which is a chemical conversion of alcohols into jet fuel [12]. This route has the potential to use different sorts of lignocellulosic-derived alcohols as raw materials, which is the base of a sustainable process. An alcohol upgrade consists of dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation [13], as shown in Fig. 1 . Feedstock for ATJ-SPK includes fossil resources, such as coal, natural gas, and shale oil, or biomass, in the form of lignocellulosic material, lipids, alcohols, and simple carbohydrates. More and more companies are producing and distributing AJF made from biomass-derived alcohols. Ethanol is widely used worldwide as a component of gasoline blending. However, its high water absorption, high volatility, corrosivity, tendency to decompose elastomers, and low flash point, limit its suitability as a drop-in jet fuel component. [14]. Byogy Reneawbles Inc. provides an AJF from biochemically-derived ethanol [15]. After dehydration, ethanol is first converted into ethylene and subsequently in long-chain hydrocarbons through catalytic synthesis that is continuously fractionated into jet fuel and gasoline. Even though ethylene is one of the most usable light olefins to oligomerize and polymerize, its suitability is significantly reduced due to its tendency to form C2-C8 oligomers instead of C10+ [12]. In addition to ethanol, Byogy's technology can effectively upgrade butanol or propanol obtained from the microbial fermentation of sugar or starch [16,17]. The produced AJF can be used directly as a petroleum-derived Jet A1 surrogate or be utilized at any blend ratio with traditional jet fuel [18,19]. Last but not least, Gevo conducts a biomass fermentation to produce isobutanol, an isomer of n-butanol, and attractive and novelty feedstock to the ATJ-SPK pathway [16]. Despite the fact of having similar physico-chemical properties to n-butanol, it has a higher-octane number and can be used directly as an oxygenated blend component for gasoline. Compared to ethanol, isobutanol does not attract water or corrode fuel lines and has a thirty percent higher energy density. The isobutanol upgrade product is a blendstock for jet fuel with C8, C12, and C16 hydrocarbons. Jet A1 surrogate formulations have incorporated iC8 or iC16 to emulate combustion properties [20]. Both iso-octane (2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, iC8) and iso-cetane (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-Heptamethylnonane, iC16) are considered reference fuels for octane number (gasoline) rating [21,22] and cetane number (diesel) rating [23], respectively. Both reference fuels have a characteristic average molecular weight within the distillation range, respectively embraced by gasoline and diesel. However, the use of these compounds as a biojet fuel blend component is sharply limited to the average molecular weight-dependent combustion properties of the jet fuel, such as sooting tendency [24], diffusion flame extinction [25], or the volatility of the mixture and liquid phase density [26]. Therefore, an isoalkane of a similar boiling specific range having a near-average molecular weight for Jet A1 would be better suited as a jet blend component. Triisobutane (2,2,4,6,6-Pentamethylheptane, iC12) can be used as a biojet fuel blending component to represent branched alkane functionality and permit better emulation of molecular weight variability and properties dependent on the molecular weight of Jet A1 [27]. Triisobutane has already received some interest as a fuel substitute component for jet fuel and diesel [28,29], as well as a model fuel for endothermic fuel research [30]. Therefore, new estimate data, as well as the characterization of triisobutane combustion behavior, are a necessary step in the sustainable development of substitute formulation approaches combining both physico-chemical kinetic property emulations of real jet fuels. The scope of this study is to simulate the triisobutane production process from cellulosic isobutanol with a techno-economic analysis and a life cycle assessment (LCA). Besides, to assess the combustion behavior of the triisobutane compared with conventional Jet A1 across the ASTM specifications, estimating the physico-chemical and thermodynamic properties. Finally, determining the potential use of the triisobutane and biojet fuel blend in a regular flight through a Payload vs. Range calculation."
1,Methods,"The methodology section contains the process design and basic assumptions, the process reactions, the techno-economic analysis, the LCA, and the physico-chemical properties estimation."
2,Process design and basic assumptions,"2.1 Process design and basic assumptions The process modeling and simulation were performed with ASPEN Plus® v.10 (Aspen Technology Inc., USA) based on data extracted from our experimental studies and approved methodology [9,16,31]. The model of a large scale biorefinery plant with a production of 91,000 tonnes of triisobutane per year was developed, enabling an accurate calculation of the mass and energy balances in each stage and the overall process. The selection of a suitable properties calculation method is essential for the thermodynamic and transport properties estimation of pure components and mixtures. The NRTL (non-random two liquid) property method was selected considering the phase and composition of the streams to achieve a proper vapor–liquid equilibrium as well as an efficient separation of the produced hydrocarbons during the isobutanol upgrading [32]. Useful data were obtained from the carbon selectivity, and the conversion rate of each stage in the process for modeling re-circulation streams with the AspenPlus Design Specs® tool. The process stages are characterized by heating and cooling; thus, Pinch Analysis, aided by Aspen Energy Analyzer®, was employed in the process integration to assess and improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs [33]. It is an optimizing methodology discovered initially and further developed by Huang & Elshout [34], Linoff et al. [35], and Umeda et al. [36]. It is used to reach more utility savings by maximizing heat recovery [37]. Pinch technique determines the possible energy recovery of the heat exchanged between the streams and defines the maximum energy recovery or minimum energy requirement of the process [38]. The cellulosic isobutanol production design, overall process economics, and LCA were based on a plant with a capacity of a 2000-dry tonne of corn stover per day [16], where the feedstock is first acid-pretreated and then enzymatically hydrolyzed (saccharification), to convert the remaining cellulose, and hemicellulose, into sugars. Pretreated hydrolysate is conditioned with ammonia, ion exchange columns were added for the removal of inhibitors (including salts, acetates, and several organic acids) to improve product yield. Via an anaerobic fermentation using improved E. Coli strains, isobutanol was obtained. The assumed residence time for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation reactions was 3.5 and 3 days, respectively. Hydrolysis residence time is similar to those used for wheat straws [39]. On the other hand, compared to ethanol fermentation, isobutanol has an optimistic residence time. Most glucose and xylose are fermented in solvent products and in the growth of microorganisms in a residence time ranging from 2 to 6 days [40,41]. The sugar to isobutanol conversion yield was 85%, with the rest of the sugar converted to cell mass and another by-product. The purification process employed a simultaneous vacuum stripping technique during the fermentation and isobutanol removal, whereas, two distillation columns and one decanter were needed to obtain 170,344 m3 of high purity isobutanol per year. The reactions produced during the process are shown in Fig. 2 . The isobutanol upgrade consists of three main reactions; dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation. A thermodynamic equilibrium was performed using the AspenPlus RGibbs® reactors and the Peng-Robinson physical property model to assess the impact of temperature on the isobutene oligomerization, as well as the effect of space–time (τ') on triisobutene production. 2.1.1 Dehydration Isobutanol is dehydrated over a commercial ɣ-alumina catalyst into isobutene, a molecule that can be synthesized to chemical products and a wide range of renewable fuels [42]. The dehydration reaction was simulated based on published data in an RYield reactor (yield specifications are in the supplementary information S1), with selectivities to isobutene of 95%, 1-butene 1.6%, trans-2-butene 0.5%, and cis-2-butene 1.9% at 325 °C, 0.62 MPa, and a Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 5 h−1 [43]. During the isobutanol dehydration, oxygen is removed in the form of water, as Fig. 3 shows: A distillation column was designed through the DSTWU AspenPlus® tool to separate the water from the C4 stream. The obtained design specifications were: number of stages 5, feed stage 3, reflux ratio 3.52, distillate to feed mole ratio 0.49. The condenser and reboiler pressure were set at 0.10 MPa. 2.1.2 Oligomerization In this stage, the upgrade of isobutene to light olefins, suited as fuel additives, is carried out, increasing the chain of carbon atoms that combines unsaturated molecules to obtain dimers, trimers, and even tetramers [44]. The oligomerization takes place in a kinetic reactor based on the evolution of the concentration of reactant and products with the space–time τ' in an n-step series–parallel reaction mechanism [45], as Fig. 4 shows: The mixture obtained from the liquid product is mainly composed of the trimer because the third and all succeeding reactions do not occur to any considerable extent [45]. The implemented kinetic model schematically describes the first and second step of the reaction mechanism [46,47]. Isobutene dimerization is first-order in isobutene [48] and all subsequent reactions: - r ' C 4 H 8 = k 1 ' C 4 H 8 + r ' C 8 H 16 = k 1 ' C 4 H 8 - k 2 ' C 8 H 16 + r ' C 12 H 24 = k 2 ' C 8 H 16 Where: r ' is the reaction rate in mol/g h. k 1 ' and k 2 ' are the rate constants of the reaction, C 4 H 8 : isobutene concentration (reactive). C 8 H 16 : diisobutene concentration (by-product). C 12 H 24 : triisobutene concentration (main product). The following expressions were applied to calculate the final concentration of C8H16 and C12H24, assuming an initial concentration of oligomers is zero and taking into account the stoichiometry of the reactions: C 8 H 16 2 C 4 H 8 0 = k 1 ' k 1 ' - k 2 ' C 8 H 16 C 4 H 8 0 k 2 ' / k 1 ' - [ C 4 H 8 ] C 4 H 8 0 C 12 H 24 3 C 4 H 8 0 = k 1 ' k 2 ' k 2 ' - k 1 ' exp - k 2 ' τ ' k 2 ' - exp - k 1 ' τ ' k 1 ' + 1 where k 1 ' = 0.8792 L/g⋅h and k 2 ' = 0.6357 L/g⋅h [45]. In addition, the real gases equation of Van der Waals was used to calculate the amount of unreacted isobutene: (1) ( P + an 2 / V 2 ) V - n b = n R T where a = 13 atm L2/mol2 and b = 0.1 L/mol [45]. The optimum conditions of pressure and temperature to obtain a stable conversion and high selectivity for trimers were 0.20 MPa and 100 °C, respectively. The reaction was modeled, assuming the use of an Amberlyst®-15 cationic ion-exchange resin as a catalyst in the gas–liquid phase. A macro was created in Visual Basic (VBA) and linked to a plug-flow reactor (PFR) in the simulated model using a Fortran code. ASPEN Plus® required the reactor’s operating specifications and inlet flows conditions to calculate the concentration of the output product. 2.1.3 Hydrogenation The final stage consisted of saturating olefins mixture from the oligomerization with gaseous hydrogen. It converted the trimers and dimers into iso-paraffines since its olefinic character, and foreseeable low oxidation stability would hinder their direct use as a biojet fuel blending component [13]. The hydrogenation reaction is shown in Fig. 5 : As a method of controlling olefin content, the bromine number was measured before hydrogenation. Following the ASTM D1159 specification, ideal for hydrocarbons mixtures substantially free of lighter compounds than the isobutane. The saturation reaction occurs in two stages, as shown below: (1) 5 B r - + BrO 3 - + 6 H + → 3 B r 2 + 3 H 2 O (2) Br 2 + R - C = C - R → R - C B r - C B r - R The stage (1) of the reaction involves the dissolution of the bromide and potassium bromate in the titration solvent, and the subsequent formation of molecular bromine, while stage (2) consists of saturating the double bonds contained in the tested sample using the bromine from the first stage. The reaction ends when all double bonds have disappeared, and the olefin content is zero [49]. The hydrogenation was simulated using an RStoic reactor. The operation conditions were mild and had relatively low operating pressure and temperature (2.03 MPa and 150 °C) and modest WHSV requirements [50], compared to other hydrogenation reactions in conversion routes for the production of biojet fuel [51]. This step consists of an exothermic reaction over a metal catalyst (Pt/Al2O3) with hydrogen consumption in the process, so a recycle and purge details were included in the reactor design to ensure adequate response control."
3,Techno-economic analysis,"2.2 Techno-economic analysis The techno-economic analysis of the process was conducted based on rigorous mass and energy balances from the simulated process model. The sizing and costing of equipment were performed using the AspenPlus Economic Evaluator® package and technical data sources. Equation 2 was applied to calculate the new cost of the equipment considering its sizing [52], and the value for the scaling factor (exp) was determined from literature sources [53–55]. As the costing of equipment was done using several sources based on different years, the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) was used to update the costs to the year of the assessment and adjust the capital cost. (2) New cost = B a s e c o s t × S i z e exp × Cost index in new year Cost index in base year The equipment installation costs were determined as the product of the installation factor (including installation labor costs, auxiliary equipment costs, contingencies costs, and engineering costs) and the purchased equipment cost [56,57]. The total capital investment (TCI), and the fixed capital investment (FCI) were calculated from the overall installation costs. The FCI was defined as the addition of the total indirect cost (60% of total direct costs) and the total direct cost. The total direct cost was calculated by adding up the installation cost and the direct costs (10% of total installation costs). Subsequently, by summing the land cost, the working capital (10% of the FCI), and the FCI, the TCI was calculated [58]. The production costs consisted of the sum of fixed operating costs (labor burden, maintenance, and employee salaries) and variable operating costs (including raw materials costs, by-product credits, waste disposal costs, and periodic costs). Feedstock logistics, as well as farming, have not been included in the assessment, the assumptions for the primary variable operating costs are shown in Table 1 . The isobutanol price is also included based on the previous study of its production from cellulosic biomass. Total fixed operating costs include supervision and labor costs, plus a 90% labor burden (i.e., social security and benefits by law). Based on the FCI, additional fixed operating costs were obtained, assuming 3% and 0.7% of the FCI for maintenance and property and tax insurance, respectively [58]. Finally, the cash flow assessment refers to the examination or interpretation of the different cash inflows and outflows related to the company during the period considered for the investment, operational, and financial activities. The economic assumptions are detailed in Table 2 . The minimum triisobutane selling price (MTSP) is the required value for a net present value (NPV) of zero at an acceptable minimum internal rate of return (IRR). The MTSP is useful for determining the economic viability of the investigated process compared to the prices of market jet fuel. Finally, a double-factor sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of the uncertainty that exists around the estimates of conceptual costs such as these on the MTSP returns. These values are best used in relative comparison against changing economic parameters, technological variations, or procedure improvements."
4,Life cycle assessment,"2.3 Life cycle assessment Besides the techno-economic analysis, an LCA was conducted to determine the net GHG emissions produced throughout the isobutanol upgrading. The assessment included the life-cycle GHG footprint and water consumption of the overall process based on the mass and energy balance. Also, the cost of these GHG emissions was considered in the sensitivity analysis to obtain the MTSP as well as the corresponding additional charge on the minimum selling prices of Jet A1. In both cases, an energy basis was used (1 MJ of fuel). During the environmental assessment in the SimaPro® LCA v.9.0 modeling software, the “global warming potential” impact category (2013) with a 100-year time scope (GWP100) was applied to evaluate GHG emissions including CO2, N2O, and CH4. Therefore, the values defined by the IPCC were used. All emissions with an effect on global climate behavior were homologated in equivalent CO2 emissions (CO2eq). Also, the Ecoinvent v.3.3 database was employed as a complementary tool for materials and processes already developed, including pre-chains data of the process. Wastewater was treated assuming an average three-stage in-situ process. The distribution of the environmental burden between the main product and the by-product (diisobutene) was calculated by considering the energy content of each compound. On the other hand, the output stream containing the cis/trans-2-butene and the 1-butene was classified as waste. Finally, the possible environmental effects based on the applied impact categories are interpreted and discussed. The obtained results were compared with other ASTM biojet fuel approved pathways, as well as with conventional jet fuel with net GHG emissions of 89 gCO2eq/MJ [62]. This comparison gave some insights about the potential of the triisobutane in reducing emissions compared to petroleum-derived aviation fuels."
5,Properties estimation,"2.4 Properties estimation 2.4.1 ASTM properties Physico-chemical and thermodynamic properties estimation were performed to analyze the effect of the hydrogenation on the triisobutene and predict its suitability as a Jet A1 blend component based on the ASTM D7566 standards specification for aviation turbine fuels containing synthesized hydrocarbons. The properties estimation included bibliographic resources and group contribution methods based on the structure of the molecules. The established parameters in the ASTM specification include the initial boiling (Tb ) and freezing (Tm ) points, both liquid state change temperatures. These parameters were calculated using the Constantinou and Gani method [63], which identifies two types of groups: simple functional groups (first-order groups) and functional groups using the first-order groups as building blocks (second-order groups). In this method, the role of the second-order group is to provide additional information about the distribution of the molecular structure when the first-order group description is insufficient to distinguish among isomers. The flash point (FP) is a descriptive characteristic defined as the lowest temperature at which an air-vapor (of the fuel) mixture will ignite in a closed space when given an ignition source; therefore, the prediction of the FP is considered an important safety parameter. The FP was estimated using an empirical equation correlating the standard boiling point, the enthalpy of vaporization, and the number of carbon atoms of the compound [64]. The dynamic viscosity ( η L ) at −20 °C was obtained through the Joback and Reid’s group contribution method [65] and converted into kinematic viscosity considering its liquid density value at −20 °C. The smoke point (SP), or the maximum flame height achieved during the jet fuel combustion without smoking, was obtained based on the triisobutane threshold soot index (TSI), which was estimated using the structural orientation lumping (SOL) group contribution method [66]. Because of the absence of aromatic elements, AJF often exceeds the 45 mm upper limit capability of the standard ASTM D1322 method; thereby, an alternative way to estimate the SP is required. The TSI indicates the sooting propensity of a fuel, which can be determined by characterizing structural features of the AJF with the same structural components (or hydrocarbons mixtures) through the 22 building blocks of the SOL method. The lower heating value (LHV), known as well as net heat of combustion, is the total energy released in the fuel combustion and was obtained based on the combustion/thermodynamic approach [67]. Finally, liquid density ( ρ ) at 15 °C was estimated using Rackett’s equation of state for saturated liquids [68]. In Table 3 , equations used to obtain the required parameters are compiled. Specifications, values, and calculations are detailed in S2. 2.4.2 Payload vs. Range The aircraft operations performance is strictly related to the energy density of jet fuel (in this instance as heat) and the convertibility of heat into mechanical power. A low heat energy released during combustion is translated into an increase in fuel consumption and, ultimately, higher operating expenses. The ρ and LHV are vital characteristics associated with the aircraft's range capacity and the chemical composition of the fuel, as Equation 3 [74] shows: (3) HeatEnergy total = ρ f × V f × L H V Where ρ f is the fuel density at 15 °C in kg/m3, V f is the fuel tank volume in m3, and LHV is the lower heating value in MJ/kg. At a given fuel tank size, more heat energy can be obtained from AJF with a higher ρ and LHV, as well, and consequently, more extended flight range or/and more substantial payload mass are allowed for aircraft operations [75]. To evaluate how changes in the properties of biojet fuel would affect the performance of the aircraft’s range, the Payload vs. Range (PVR) was calculated. The PVR calculations were carried out using the Breguet range equation [76] (see Equation 4) for a Boeing 747-200B-RB211-S24D4®, assuming the straight aircraft position and a permanent altitude for the whole flight and without turbulences: (4) Range = V ( L / D ) g · s f c l n ( W i W f ) Where V is the flight speed (300 m/s), (L/D) is the lift/drag ratio (17.5), g is the gravitational constant (9.81 m/s2), sfc is the specific fuel consumption (mg/N⋅s), Wi (We + Wp + Wf ) and Wf (We + Wp ) are the initial and final weight of the aircraft at the beginning and end of the cruise stage, respectively. The Breguet equation is the simplest flight model and assumes that the fuels burn as efficiently as Jet A1 and that no structural changes to the plane are necessary to accommodate the AJF. The assumed maximum take-off and structural payload weight were 371,900 and 62,817 kg, respectively. Besides, the maximum landing weight was 285,700 kg, including 30% of remaining fuel for safety reasons [77]. The flight section weight historical ratios define 4.5% of fuel consumption during the warm-up and take off, and the climb [78]. The sfc can be calculated from Equation 5 considering a Jet A1 sfc of 17.46 mg/N⋅s: (5) sfc biojetfuel = sfc J e t A 1 LHV J e t A 1 LHV biojetfuel The LHV of the biojet fuel blend was calculated using Equation 6. Where Xi is the mass fraction of each blended fuel: (6) LHV = ∑ i LHV i × X i The PVR was calculated up to the maximum volumetric capacity of 206 m3 of the fuel tanks. The mixture ρ is calculated as Equation 7 shows, employing the triisobutane and Jet A1 ρ, where Xi is the mass fraction of each component: (7) 1 ρ = ∑ i X i ρ i The Breguet equation shows the effect of changing fuel on the limits to the range payload performance. However, an accurate depiction of the range in an operating aircraft was calculated."
6,Results and discussion,"Results are separated into four main parts: process modeling, economic evaluation, and its sensitivity analysis, global process emissions and LCA, and the comparison of the produced jet fuel with the traditional petroleum-derived aviation fuel."
7,Process design,"3.1 Process design 3.1.1 Simulation description The simulated triisobutane production model is shown in Fig. 6 , where the isobutanol (S1 streamflow) sequentially goes through the reactions of dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation. The flow rate, temperature, pressure, and composition of the most relevant streams from the simulated biorefinery are listed in Table 4 . An extended table, including all the flow streams, is described in S3. The obtained data for the Pinch analysis are represented in a set of energy flows as a function of heat required against temperature to optimize heat recovery systems, energy supply methods, and process operating conditions. It can be inferred that the isobutanol feedstock stream must be conditioned, pressurized, and heated, to be fed into the first reactor which operates at 325 °C and 0.62 MPa. Next, the isobutene stream that leaves the dehydration reactor has the same conditions; thus, its pressure and temperature must be decreased to diminish the operation pressure of the distillation column, favoring the separation and avoiding hazardous conditions. Therefore, a turbine and a heat exchanger were implemented to decrease the pressure and temperature of the isobutylene stream; these units allowed the flow to reach 100 °C and atmospheric pressure, respectively. As a result, an indirect heat integration system was proposed, using the released energy by isobutene stream to pre-heat isobutanol feedstock stream (compositive curves are shown in S4). Also, the unreacted hydrogen from the hydrogenation reactor was conditioned (purged) before being recycled. The main results of the production analysis are summarized in Table 5 . Apart from the specific production index, the thermal efficiency η th was measured to evaluate the amount of the initial cellulosic isobutanol feedstock heat input that remains at the final product and is defined as: (8) η th = m Triisobutane × LHV Triisobutane m isobutanol × LHV isobutanol The main results reveal a high performance in the isobutanol-to-triisobutane conversion through the assessed thermochemical route. The high conversion yield during the dehydration (99.1%) and oligomerization reactions achieved an elevated amount of isobutene and high selectivity of triisobutene, respectively. The bromine number of triisobutene was 79.51 gBr2/100 g, which represents a high aliphatic unsaturation degree, exceeding the limit of the ASTM D1159 specification of 57.5 gBr2/100 g [79] (a summary containing the measured results is detailed in S5). This causes the need for a hydrogenation stage with a hydrogen consumption ratio of 0.03 kg/kgtriisobutane. The effect of temperature and space–time τ’ conditions on the isobutene conversion and oligomer distribution (%, w/w) is fundamental to generate a higher concentration of triisobutene. Space-time (τ’) is defined as W / V 0 , where W is the weight of catalyst (g), and V0 is the volumetric flow of isobutene (LNh−1). Isobutene conversion is defined as: (9) X i - R = ( n i - C 4 ) 0 - ( n i - C 4 ) exit ( n i - C 4 ) 0 × 100 where ( n i - C 4 ) 0 are the moles of reactant in the feed and ( n i - C 4 ) exit are the moles of the reactant at the reactor outlet stream. 3.1.2 Effect of the temperature during the oligomerization The reaction temperature has been studied in a range of 50–110 °C. since it is a very exothermic reversible reaction [45] as illustrated below: 2 C 4 H 8 ( g ) → C 8 H 16 l ; Δ H 0 = - 107.2 k J / m o l 3 C 4 H 8 ( g ) → C 12 H 24 l ; Δ H 0 = - 154.4 k J / m o l 4 C 4 H 8 ( g ) → C 16 H 32 l ; Δ H 0 = - 231.9 k J / m o l Therefore, as the temperature increases, the conversion of isobutene is expected to decrease [80]. On the other hand, at temperatures above 100–110 °C, the side reaction of oligomer separation increases considerably, and the catalyst used becomes unstable, resulting in a meager conversion yield of isobutene. Besides, considering that triisobutene is the desired compound, it has been demonstrated that up to 100 °C, triisobutene formation surpasses diisobutene formation [81]. The oligomers are in the liquid state at atmospheric pressure, and up to 100 °C, this accelerates the trimerization by favoring the solubility of isobutene in the mixed-phase of the reaction. Above the boiling point of diisobutene at approximately 110 °C, this effect is reversed, and the formation of triisobutene starts to decline, as the thermodynamic equilibrium shows in Fig. 7 . At 100 °C, the main product is triisobutene (approximately 90%, w/w), with minor amounts of diisobutene (about 10%, w/w) in the mixture of liquid products, achieving a weight ratio of C12/C8≈ 9.0. Because the formation of tetramers is quantitively low, it was not considered. 3.1.3 Effect of the space–time τ’ during the oligomerization The space–time τ’ was adjusted in the kinetic reaction model to maximize the formation of triisobutene by efficient use of the catalyst during the reaction. The model could not be fitted for values greater than 7.5 g h/L because the experimental data concluded that in prolonged residence time, reversibility should be taken into account [45]. The results obtained from the distribution of oligomers and the conversion of isobutene vs. space–time τ’ are shown in Fig. 8 . Selectivity for triisobutene increases as diisobutene yield decreases. A higher conversion of isobutene is obtained at space–time τ’ values ranging from 4.5 to 6.0 g h/L with a considerably lower conversion for values beyond this range. A space–time of 5.5 g h/L was selected to achieve a 90% conversion of isobutene. The liquid mixture obtained is triisobutene (approximately 92%) with small amounts of diisobutene (<10%), and a C12/C8 weight ratio of ≈ 9.0."
8,Techno-economic evaluation,"3.2 Techno-economic evaluation The total process cost of triisobutane production comprehends fixed (labor supplies and overheads), and variable (feedstock, by-product credits, and utility) costs, an average return on investment, capital depreciation, and an ordinary income tax. The results are summarized in Table 6 . The investment costs per process unit are: dehydration 3,591,414 €; oligomerization 918,300 €; and hydrogenation 1,816,608 €. During the studied thermochemical route, two types of hydrocarbons are produced. The triisobutane is the end-product, whereas the diisobutane is considered a by-product with an assumed selling price of 1.47 €/L, based on its buying availability with the 2019 regular fuel price in Spain. For the 390 isobutanol tonne-per-day biorefinery, the triisobutane yield is 31.78 million gallons per year. The calculated MTSP is 1.34 €/kg or 1.00 €/L, which is almost double compared to the minimum selling price of Jet A1 of 0.76 €/kg [82]. The technological viability for the production of triisobutane has been demonstrated [12,83]; however, the sustainability of raw materials, cost reduction, and increased availability remain essential parameters for a successful and adequate commercial implementation. The process overprice caused in the first instance by the feedstock costs due to the isobutanol price represents approximately 68% of the variable operating costs, implying a pay equal to 0.91€ per kg of triisobutane. Secondly, the drop-in AJF must meet several aviation requirements, including standard ASTM specifications, which require more sophisticated and worked-out technological methods than those implemented for other transport sectors. On the other hand, the current production of AJF compared to Jet A1 is much lower, which increases input costs [84]. While triisobutane is 0.58 €/kg more expensive than traditional jet fuel, it represents an improvement related to the estimated increment between 0.42 €/L and 1.20 €/L for other ASTM routes to produce biojet fuels. Besides, in the context of charging the further fee for including the biojet fuel mixture on a typical flight to the EU passenger fares and considering the low mixture rate for the triisobutane-ATJ (up to 30 vol%), the cost becomes affordable. If the estimated additional cost for the biojet fuels (0.42–1.20 €/L) is distributed across all domestic and intra-EU-27 flights in 2020, this would add between €1.20 and €4.30 to the ticket's price per passenger of a regular 1,000 km flight [84,85]. Finally, the sensitivity analysis consisted of a comparison between optimal and non-optimal scenarios based on the variation of the economic parameters to calculate the minimum selling price. The double-point sensitivity analysis was adjusted through the uncertainty range, taking into account only those parameters that suppose a variation of 10% or more in the MTSP. The first parameter is the minimum selling price of lignin. Currently, it represents an alternative energy source and has become an attractive by-product of chemical processes that use lignocellulosic feedstock. This analysis assumed the selling of re-conditioned lignin produced during the production of isobutanol and re-used for on-site energy generation, reducing the consumption of natural gas. Based on the lignin and natural gas lower heating value, the additional demand for natural gas to replace the energy provided from lignin has been calculated. The minimum selling price based on its market value ranged between 165 and 680 €/t for low and high purity lignin, respectively [61]. Second, the cost of isobutanol by improving its glucose and xylose conversion yield. As mentioned before, the elevated price of isobutanol directly affects the MTSP. Therefore, 45 and 95 percent of the stoichiometric theoretical yield as the lower and upper scenario limits were assumed. The improvement derives from the detection of potential hosts utilizing metabolic engineering techniques. As a result, the cost of isobutanol was 1.53 and 0.64 €/kg for each limit [16]. While any parameter on its own would not reduce the MTSP under the minimum selling price of the Jet A1, a considerable decrease occurs when high-purity lignin is sold. Also, if the emissions produced during the refining of jet fuel (either fossil or cellulosic derived) were considered, both minimum selling price would proportionally increase. The EU ETS is essential in climate change policy and represents a useful tool to address and cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions and encouraging renewable energy. The European price of CO2eq emissions sets approximately 25 € per tonne [86], which corresponds to an additional charge of 0.10 and 0.06 €/kg of Jet A1 and triisobutane, respectively. The economic feasibility of the process increases significantly when the optimal variation in the sale of re-conditioned lignin and the costs of CO2eq emissions are combined, achieving a competitive MTSP of 0.85 €/kg compared to the obtained minimum selling price of Jet A1 of 0.87 €/kg, as Fig. 9 shows."
9,Life cycle assessment,"3.3 Life cycle assessment The net GHG emissions from the isobutanol upgrade to triisobutane were 6.60 gCO2eq/MJtriisobutane. 91.30% of those emissions occurred in the combustion of natural gas (the process requires 5.62 MJ/kgtriisobutane of natural gas), mainly during the dehydration of isobutanol, and the remaining 8.40% is emitted during the production of hydrogen necessary for hydrogenation. Besides, the life-cycle GHG footprint of 57.96 gCO2eq/MJtriisobutane [16] produced in the isobutanol conversion was considered to calculate the overall process emissions. The combined emissions are 64.54 gCO2eq/MJtriisobutane; this result is compared with other ATJ and HEFA biojet fuel production routes from two different types of biomass feedstock for each case (see Fig. 10 ). The HEFA process was selected because it is the only ASTM route certified for commercial use that operates in a full industrial-scale application [87]. The reference cases considered are ATJ with wheat straw (WS) and wheat grain (WG), and HEFA with jatropha oil (JO) and palm oil (PO). A total reduction of 28% compared to the traditional Jet A1 is achieved. To meet the established goals for the reduction of GHG emissions is essential to improve the efficiency of the production of isobutanol, which represents 90.24% of direct CO2eq emissions with a fossil fuel consumption of 17.14 MJ/kgisobutanol, 70% more compared to the 5.08 MJ/kgtriisobutane required on its upgrading [16]. The stages that emit the most are the production, harvest and pretreatment of raw material, and the conversion of cellulose into simple sugars via strong acids, ionic liquids, or enzymatic reaction. The development of new catalysts is a key factor for the efficiency of this process [88–91]. Significant credits for the displacement of by-product (not just from electricity but also from diisobutane) and the use of renewable sources are necessary [92]. Otherwise, both GHG emissions and fossil energy input for the overall process would breach the Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001/EU - Recast to 2030 (REDII). The GHG emissions of AJF must be lower than those of conventional jet fuel. REDII considers 50% reduction of GHG emissions for production facilities before October 2015, a mandatory 60% reduction for production facilities after that date, and 65% for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) produced in facilities that begin operations after January 2021 and January 2026 [93]. Stringent emissions rules are considered for biofuels, in part because biofuels are now used in road transport, where electric cars are a promising option. However, as said before, alternative options in aviation are more complicated and, with not an electric option yet, sustainable biofuels should be encouraged. On the other hand, the direct consumption of water during the isobutanol production process is 11.40 L/kgisobutanol [16]. In contrast, in the upgrading process, no water is consumed; on the contrary, 0.44 L/kgtriisobutane is produced as a result of the dehydration of isobutanol. It is cataloged as wastewater because it contains minor amounts of impurities; however, through a physico-chemical treatment, it could be recycled to the biomass pretreatment stage in the conversion of isobutanol process."
10,Properties estimation,"3.4 Properties estimation 3.4.1 ASTM properties The results from the physico-chemical properties estimation are listed in Table 7 . Also, the ASTM standard specification is shown. The Tb and Tm become acceptable compared with the reference values, and both are inside the limits. The Tm is a particularly important parameter and must be sufficiently low to preclude interference with the flow of fuel through filter screens to the engine at reached temperatures at high altitudes. The FP is also adequate, indicating no severe fire or explosion hazard for the triisobutane biojet fuel shipment, handling, and storage [96]. The kinematic viscosity of the triisobutane is closely related to the pumping capacity over the temperature range and the consistency of the spray patterns of the nozzle. The estimated value is within the acceptable range. Iso-alkanes have a relatively low sooting tendency. Consequently, the estimated TSI value for the triisobutane was 16.6, which compares very well with the direct measurement of 15.4 [27]. The SP is inversely proportional to the TSI, at a lower SP height, greater smoke-producing tendency. Therefore, a 32.33 mm was obtained, which overpasses the minimum height of 25 mm from the specification and is very close to the experimentally obtained value. On the other hand, as mentioned before, because of the triisobutene olefinic content, a considerably lower SP and higher TSI values were expected. Based on the same group contribution method and SP parameters, the SP/TSI of triisobutene was estimated, resulting in 19.9 mm / 29.7 TSI units, demonstrating the hydrogenation improvement on the molecule. The LHV and ρ measurement met the Annex 5 ATJ-SPK specification requirements, which is in excellent agreement with experimentally obtained values. A low ρ indicates low heating value per unit volume and would mean a reduced flight range for a given quantity of fuel [97]. The triisobutane ρ is insufficient on its own to meet the ASTM D7566 specification range (770–840 kg/m3), however, when blended at a volume composition of 30/70 vol% (ATJ-SPK/Jet A1), it accomplishes a ρ of 784.64 kg/m3. The ρ parameter is crucial when mixing occurs to obtain a stable blend, since the higher the difference between them, the greater becomes the chance of separation. Additionally, the energy density (by volume) was calculated from the estimated results and compared with other ASTM approved pathways, as shown in Table 8 . 3.4.2 Payload vs. Range The payload capacity of AJF with a lower energy density compared to the Jet A1 is conditioned by the volume of the fuel tanks. As the density of the AJF increases, the range can be extended, considering the payload and fuel weight balance to reach the maximum structural load of the aircraft. Fig. 11 shows the triisobutane PVR diagram. At the maximum structural payload capacity, triisobutane and the biojet fuel achieved an improvement of 1.85% and 0.53% km, respectively, in range performance compared to Jet A1. Although triisobutane and the biojet fuel blend seem to perform less well than the conventional Jet A1, if the range allows, they represent a viable alternative without sacrificing the payload, as Table 9 shows. The PVR performance reaches an optimal balance when the fuel tank is full. The PVR calculation assumes an aircraft full of fuel up to the maximum weight limit. However, for commercial aircraft that operate with a specific destination, only enough fuel will be loaded to cover the required range. In Table 10 , changes in fuel volume and weight requirements for a particular flight plan are calculated. These estimates demonstrate that changes in fuel properties will also have an effect on the mass of fuel required, and the energy consumed during a flight. The results show a better performance for triisobutane and the biojet fuel blend, which are lighter and have higher LHV compared to the traditional Jet A1. The two cases are inside the ATJ-SPK limits from the ASTM specification."
11,Conclusions,"The simulated process for biojet fuel production (triisobutane) from cellulosic isobutanol via the ATJ-SPK thermochemical route, obtained a highly efficient production rate. Lignin selling price showed the most influence on the minimum selling price of triisobutane based on the sensitivity analysis. A competitive minimum selling price is achieved when high-purity lignin is sold, and a GHG emission cost is assumed. The GHG footprint of the overall process will reduce as long as policies and improvements in isobutanol production are adopted. Besides, the triisobutane represents a viable jet fuel surrogate; its combustion behavior fulfills the standards to be used in regular flights. The combined analyses presented in this work provide quantitative and qualitative information about the isobutanol-derived biojet fuel production, identifying necessary improvements to make this technically, economically, and environmentally sustainable."
