0,Introduction,"As the shortage of traditional fossil resources and the environmental issues worldwide, the research and application of sustainable/green technology has aroused widespread concern. Acetone hydrogenation plays an important role in the renewable energy technology such as the chemical heat pumps (isopropanol-acetone-hydrogen chemical heat pump), H2 storage schemes and DIPA (direct isopropyl alcohol) fuel cells, which require a higher selectivity to isopropanol at high conversion than presently available [1,2]. Moreover, based on the increasing demand for isopropanol due to its wild applications, acetone hydrogenation which involves the catalytic CO hydrogenation is a cheap and environmentally safe alternative method for the production of isopropanol [3]. In this investigation, we reported the carbon black supported PtRu alloy nanoparticles with multiple reactive sites as a remarkable efficient catalyst for acetone hydrogenation at room temperature, which exhibits unexpected high catalytic properties relative to most supported and unsupported catalysts reported (Table S1). Moreover, 3-pentanone was used as the probe molecule to verify the low-temperature CO hydrogenation on PtRu/C, which is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes and important initial step for organic synthesis (for examples, the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols, catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass and glucose, etc.). Interaction of catalyst’s surface atoms with reactants plays a significant role in catalysis. Specific surface active sites are responsible for different molecular reactions taking place on the surface. Understanding the essence of the surface catalytic behavior between the reactant molecular and surface sites can provide the foundation to manipulate the catalytic performance on an atomic basis. For the structure-function relationship in heterogeneous catalysis, the type and distribution of metal atoms on the catalyst’s surface can directly determine the catalytic performance. In the catalytic CO hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones to allylic alcohols, Iridium is the preferred metal type because it is more oxophilic than other metals of the Pt group (stronger carbonyl affinity) [4]. Compared with monometallic Pd, introduction of Ir into Pd (Pd-Ir alloy formation) increased the TOF value of CO hydrogenation of furfural, because the presence of Ir atoms on the NPs surface favors the adsorption of furfural molecular with perpendicular binding mode (furfural is anchored to the metal surface though the carbonyl-oxygen atom) [5]. It is widely recognized that the size of the metal nanoparticles (NPs) could fundamentally affect their catalytic properties [6–12]. The ratio of defect (i.e., vertex and edge) to face atoms changes dramatically as a function of the NPs size [11]. Larger size favors the faster CO hydrogenation [13–16]. For instance, size effect of Ru metal particle was found on CO hydrogenation of ketones whose TOF increases with the Ru particle size, because the larger metal particles has less proportion of highly unsaturated surface sites which could result in relatively weaker adsorbate-surface interaction and more balanced coverage between the two kinds of reactants on metal surface [13]. Furthermore, for the synergetic behavior in catalysis, which can result in the more superior catalytic performance of multiple sites than single type sites, since the synergetic multi-functions of different active sites on the catalyst’s surface, the different reactants could be activated simultaneously and separately by different surface sites [17–22]. Au-Ag/SBA-15 catalysts exhibited exceptionally high activity for the dimethyl oxalate hydrogenation, which is attributed to a synergistic behavior between Au and Ag where the Au sites activate the carbonyl molecule and the Ag sites contribute to H2 molecule activation [20]. Generally, the structure-function relationship is a multivariate function relationship rather than a single-value function. In heterogeneous catalysis, the superimposition effect of those independent variables (structural variables), including the metal particle size [6–12], shape [23,24], metal composition [25,26], valence [27,28], support [29], interface [30–32], etc., ultimately determines the observed catalytic performance. Rational design of the highly effective catalysts, certainly with adjusting and optimizing the catalytic properties, are strongly dependent on the understanding of the structure-function relationship in catalysis which can give the clear guidance. Herein, besides the remarkable catalytic performance, we found both the catalytic activity and selectivity can be controllably adjusted and well optimized by regulating the catalyst’s specific annealing treatment conditions. The structure-function relationship for catalytic CO hydrogenation of ketones on PtRu/C has been established, which reveals the metal particle size effect, significant role of surface metal-oxide sites and the synergetic behavior in catalysis, demonstrating the essential correlation between the variation in catalyst’s annealing conditions and the resultant variation in catalytic performance, and providing the fundamental understanding for the heterogeneous catalytic CO hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Carbon black (BLACK PEARLS 2000 LOT-1366221) was purchased from Cabot Corporation and used as catalyst support. Acetone (purity ≥ 99.5%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. 3-Pentanone (purity ≥ 98%) was provided from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). All other reagents (NaOH, RuCl3, H2PtCl6, ethylene glycol and anhydrous ethanol, etc.) were supplied from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The deionized water was produced using a Milli-Q intergral 3 (Millipore Corporation). H2 (purity ≥ 99.999%), N2 (purity ≥ 99.999%), H2/N2 (10% H2 mixed with 90%N2) and O2/N2 (20% O2 mixed with 80% N2) were purchased from Linde Gas Co. Ltd. (Xiamen, China). All the chemicals were used as received without any further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation A one-pot surfactant-free polyol process was used to prepare PtRu/C samples, namely 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C, 3Pt/C and 3Ru/C (labeled as xPtyRu/C here, where x and y denote the theoretical weight percentage loading of Pt and Ru, the percentage sign was removed for naming simplicity). Typically, for 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C, 0.6 g carbon black was dispersed in 45 ml ethylene glycol and treated with ultrasonic for 1 h to form homogeneous slurry. Then 4.8 ml RuCl3 ethylene glycol solution (1.90 mg/ml, concentration of Ru) and 5 ml H2PtCl6 ethylene glycol solution (1.85 mg/ml, concentration of Pt) were added and stirred for 1 h. After adjusting the pH to 10 using NaOH ethylene glycol solution (52 mg/ml), the final solution was kept at 180 °C in N2 ambience protection under reflux-condensation for 3 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the pH of solution was adjusted to 2.0 with hydrochloric acid solution and then was vigorously stirred for another 10 h. Such slurry was filtered and washed repeatedly with deionized water until no chlorine ion was detected, finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 10 h. Thus obtained pre-catalyst named catalyst un-annealed as which would undergo the annealing treatment process subsequently. The annealing treatment process was conducted under specific gas ambience (N2 or H2/N2). The samples were placed into a quartz tube which located in an electrical heating furnace with intelligent control, then sealed the gas circuit and fixed the gas flow rate at 80 ml/min at atmospheric pressure. The samples under the selected gas ambience were heated from room temperature to the selected temperature with a heating-rate of 2 °C/min and then retained for 3 h. After naturally falling to room temperature such annealed catalyst samples were taken out. Additionally, In our present study, to generate the metal oxide species on the catalyst’s surface, the oxidation treatment of the samples were performed at room temperature under O2/N2 ambience (20% O2 mixed with 80% N2) with a gas flow-rate of 40 ml/min for a selected period of treatment time. Similar to the 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C preparation process described above, other two monometallic samples were prepared by adding specific amount of the selected metal precursor’s ethylene glycol solutions according to the theoretical metal loading calculated, pH = 8.0 and pH = 12.0 were chosen as the pH values of the metal precursor’s ethylene glycol solution of 3Ru/C and 3Pt/C, respectively. The actual metal loading of the catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using an Agilent ICP-MS 4500 instrument. Considering the possibility of surface oxidation of the catalysts when exposed to air for long time, note that, the samples after annealing treatment and the ones after oxidation treatment were evaluated for their catalytic performance within 15 min after their preparations. The catalysts need to be stored using the standard Schlenk techniques under dry nitrogen (purity ≥ 99.999%) immediately after the annealing process or the oxidation treatment for further characterization use."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement was performed using a Micrometrics ASAP2020 system at liquid nitrogen temperature. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 3 h under vacuum. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was used to calculate the specific surface areas. The average pore diameter and pore size distributions were determined using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption branches of isotherms. The total pore volume depended on the absorbed N2 volume at a relative pressure of approximately 0.99. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 30 mA) of wavelength λ = 0.15418 nm. Step-scans were taken over a 2θ range of 30°–90° with a scanning rate of 2°/min. MDI Jade software (version 6.5) was used to analyze the phase contents and determine the particle size via Scherrer equation. The diffraction characteristic peaks were identified by matching them with the reference patterns in the JCPDS database. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and EDX mapping analysis of the catalyst were performed on Philips Analytical FEI Tecnai 30 electron microscope with a field emission source operated at an electron acceleration energy of 300 kV. The catalyst powders were lightly ground and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol at room temperature. The as-obtained solution was then dropped onto holey carbon films supported by copper grids. The average particle size was determined from TEM images by counting ca. 200–250 particles from several imaged areas. Quasi in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a VG MultiLab 2000 spectrometer with an Omicron Sphera II hemispherical electron energy analyzer and a home-made treatment chamber. Such treatment chamber was used for the annealing treatment of the catalyst and after that the catalyst would be transferred to the XPS analysis chamber through a load-lock gate without exposure to air. The catalysts’ annealing treatment process in the treatment chamber can provide selections of operation conditions, including the gas atmosphere type, gas-flow rate, heating rate, final treatment temperature, etc. In our present study, to characterize the metal surface valence distribution of the catalyst after annealing treatment, N2 and H2/N2 (10% H2 mixed with 90% N2) were chosen as the two types of operation atmosphere and the flow rate was fixed at 80 ml/min at atmospheric pressure. The treatment chamber was heated from room temperature to the selected temperature with a heating-rate of 2 °C/min and then retained for 3 h, after falling to room temperature the samples would be transferred to the analysis chamber for the subsequent XPS text. For the catalysts after oxidation treatment in this study, which were stored using the standard Schlenk techniques under dry nitrogen immediately after their treatment, their XPS characterizations were conducted directly without utilizing the treatment chamber. Each sample after its XPS test was abandoned without any recycling use. Monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV, anode operating at 15 kV and 300 W) was used to excite XPS spectra. The constant pass energy was 40 eV and base pressure of the system was 5.0 × 10−9 mbar. The raw data were corrected for substrate charging with the binding energy of the C1s peak (284.6 eV). The measured spectra were fitted using a least-squares procedure to a product of Gaussian-Lorentzian functions. No trace of chlorine or sodium was detected on all samples by XPS. High-sensitivity Low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (HS-LEISS) of the catalysts were collected on an Ion-TOF Qtac100 low energy ion scattering analyzer, 20Ne+ ions with a kinetic energy of 5 keV and the current of 1.6 nA were applied."
5,Measurement of catalytic performance,"2.4 Measurement of catalytic performance The catalytic performances of the catalysts in ketone hydrogenation were evaluated using a stainless-steel high-pressure reactor with magnetic stirrer (Parr 4848, Parr Instruments). A given amount (0.1 g) of the catalyst and ketone (solvent free, 10 ml) were placed in the reactor and that was then sealed and purged 3 times with N2 to remove the remnant air in the vessel. The reaction system was conducted at selected temperature under 5.3 MPa hydrogen pressure and stirred at 500 rpm. After a selected period of reaction time, the reactor was quickly cooled to room temperature in an ice-water bath and the pressure in the reactor was released. The solid catalyst was separated by centrifugation and the liquid was collected for the subsequent analysis. The quantitative analysis of the products were performed on GC (Shimadzu GC 2010) equipped with DB-35 (60 m × 0.32 mm) capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID), GC–MS (Shimadzu GC–MS 2010) was used for qualitative analysis. To investigate the recyclability of the catalyst, after the evaluation the used catalyst was filtered with ethanol and vacuum dried at 60 °C overnight, recovered before the next reaction run. The catalytic activity was calculated by means of the turnover frequency (TOF) expressed in moles of ketone transformed per moles of surface metal per second (the conversion of ketone was maintained below 15% to obtain the TOF). According to the literature reported [14], dispersion of the PtRu particles was calculated using Eq. (1) pondered from the metal loadings determined by ICP-MS and assuming an equal distribution of both metals in the particles: (1) D M = ( 6 n s M ) / ( ρ N d p ) where ns is the number of metal atoms at the surface per unit area (Pt: 1.12 × 1019/m2, Ru: 1.63 × 1019/m2). M is the atomic mass (Pt: 195.08 g/mol, Ru: 101.07 g/mol). ρ is the metal density (Pt: 21.45 g/cm3, Ru: 12.1 g/cm3), N is the Avogadro's number (6.023 × 1023 at./mol), dp is the metal particle mean size measured by TEM. The average values of these parameters were used to calculate the metal dispersion of PtRu particles considering the molar ratio of Pt to Ru in the samples."
6,Results,
7,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance As shown in Table S2, there was no hydrogenation reaction product detected in the absence of catalyst. Carbon black (catalyst support) did not show any catalytic activity in ketones hydrogenation. The metal composition of the catalyst was found to determine the catalytic performance (Table S2). When in the similar metal particle size range, the bimetallic 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C sample exhibited higher activity than monometallic 3Pt/C or 3Ru/C in ketones hydrogenation. In particular, for the catalytic acetone hydrogenation, monometallic 3Pt/C could lead to the byproduct isopropyl ether generation where monometallic 3Ru/C could not. Compared with monometallic Pt, addition of a second metal component into Pt (PtRu bimetallic sample) led to the catalytic selectivity to isopropanol increase, indicating the important role of catalyst’s metal composition in catalytic selectivity. Since 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C showed relatively higher activity than monometallic samples, to further optimize the catalytic properties, we performed the annealing treatment for 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C at temperatures ranging from 200 °C to 500 °C under N2 and H2/N2 atmosphere respectively, and evaluated their catalytic performance in acetone and 3-pentanone hydrogenations after such annealing process. Evaluation results are shown in Table 1 . Annealing treatment of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C was found to influence the catalytic performance significantly, which was reflected concretely in two respects as: 1, the influence of annealing atmosphere on catalytic performance; 2, the influence of annealing temperature on catalytic performance. Firstly, for the influence of annealing atmosphere, it is clear that when at the same catalyst’s annealing temperature, compared with the sample annealed in H2/N2, sample annealed in N2 exhibited higher conversion value while using shorter reaction time (evaluation conditions are same and fixed). TOFs of samples annealed in N2 are higher than that annealed in H2/N2. Secondly, for the influence of the annealing temperature, TOF of the CO hydrogenation increased gradually as the annealing temperature increased (especially for the samples annealed in H2/N2). Such variation in catalytic activity observed in acetone hydrogenation is coincident with that observed in 3-pentanone hydrogenation, confirming the objectivity of the role of the catalyst’s annealing treatment in ketone’s carbonyl hydrogenation. Focusing on the catalytic selectivity in acetone hydrogenation, there was no isopropyl ether produced over the catalysts annealed in N2 (100% selectivity to isopropanol). However, performing the catalyst’s annealing treatment in H2/N2 resulted in the byproduct isopropyl ether generation (resulted in the selectivity to isopropanol decrease). Moreover, interestingly, gradual increase of the annealing temperature in H2/N2 led to the selectivity to isopropanol increase."
8,Catalysts’ porous structure and the surface area,"3.2 Catalysts’ porous structure and the surface area Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were performed to characterize the porosity and surface area of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed under different conditions. Their N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. S1. The catalysts’ parameters listed in Table S3 including the BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter are smaller than those of the parent carbon black support, which is due to the introduction of the guest metallic nanoparticles (NPs) [20]. Among these 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C samples, their total pore volume and average pore diameter values vary insignificantly, indicating their similar pore structures and that is consistent with the similarity in their structures of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption results indicate that changing the catalyst’s annealing treatment conditions can not lead to the obvious change in catalyst’s pore structure and surface area."
9,Evidence of Pt-Ru alloy formation and the evolution of crystalline phase,"3.3 Evidence of Pt-Ru alloy formation and the evolution of crystalline phase Fig. 1 a and b show the crystalline phase evolutions of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed under different conditions. Fig. 1c shows the XRD patterns of monometallic 3Pt/C and 3Ru/C. 3Pt/C exhibits the existence of diffraction peaks positioned at 2θ values of 39.7°, 46.2°, 67.4° and 81.3°. These peaks are indicative of the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of the fcc crystalline structure of metallic pure bulk Pt by comparing with the reference pattern (ICDD-JCPDS Card No. 040802). The strongest diffraction peak Ru (1 0 1) of Ru located at 44.0° (ICDD-JCPDS Card No. 06-0663) is found to overlap with the support’s broad characteristic peak C (1 0 1). Compared with the Pt diffraction peak’s position in 3Pt/C (Fig. 1c), the characteristic diffraction peak’s position in 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C (Fig. 1a and b) shifts to the higher angle since the Ru component added. Such peak position shift indicates the formation of Pt-Ru alloy. Considering the different atomic size (Pt > Ru), a certain number of Ru atoms diffuse into the Pt lattice which can lead to a compressive strain (i.e., a contraction of the original lattice) for the platinum fcc structure, and thus resulting in the original Pt diffraction peak position shifting to higher angle [14]. Whether under N2 or H2/N2 annealing atmosphere, increase of the annealing temperature can result in the shape of the strongest diffraction peak in 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C (2θ = 40.82°) becoming increasingly sharper and obvious (Fig. 1a and 1b), which is due to the decrease of FWHM (full width at half maximum) derived from the PtRu alloy particle diameter increase. Moreover, no matter how to change the annealing atmosphere or temperature, the position of strongest diffraction peak in 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C keeps always unchanged (2θ = 40.82°), remaining in the state of movement to higher angle compared with the Pt (1 1 1) in monometallic 3Pt/C (2θ = 39.7°). Result indicates that such annealing process can not destroy the PtRu alloy structure even though annealing condition has changed. No Ruthenium oxide or Platinum oxide appearance is detected in all these patterns. Elemental mapping result of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C is shown in Fig. 2 . Despite the annealing temperature has increased even up to 500 °C, such two kinds of metallic elements remain in the uniform mixing state without any phase separation, which is consistent with the former XRD results that raising the annealing temperature cannot destroy the alloy structure. Pt and Ru diffuse into each other’s lattice, such uniformly close integration laid the foundation for their synergy in catalysis."
10,Surface metal atomic concentration,"3.4 Surface metal atomic concentration Interaction of surface atoms of NPs with reactants plays a significant role in catalysis [33]. Low-energy ion-scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) has an outstanding sensitivity toward the outermost atomic layer on detecting the surface atomic concentration variations, in which the variation in the area of characteristic peak of the corresponding element can express the changes of the corresponding element’s concentration on catalyst’s surface [34]. As shown in Fig. 3 , single-handed Pt and Ru characteristic peak are found in 3Pt/C and 3Ru/C, respectively. 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C exhibits the coexistence of both Pt and Ru characteristic peaks with relative smaller peak area compared with the respective monometallic sample. Result of LEISS indicates that such three samples possess different surface metal compositions and different surface concentrations of metal elements. 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C possesses the lower surface concentration of Pt than 3Pt/C, and lower surface concentration of Ru than 3Ru/C."
11,Variation in metal particle size,"3.5 Variation in metal particle size Table 2 shows the mean metal particle diameters of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed under different conditions, corresponding TEM images are shown in Fig. S3–S4. Sample annealed at 200 °C exhibits a relatively higher metal dispersion than others. Significantly, whether in N2 or H2/N2 (annealing ambience), gradual increase of the annealing temperature can lead to the metal particle size increasing gradually, suggesting the agglomeration of those metal particles induced by higher annealing temperature. The monodirectional increase of NPs size as annealing temperature increases detected from TEM is consistent with the former diffraction peak’s shape variation trend in XRD."
12,Variation in surface valence distribution,"3.6 Variation in surface valence distribution Insitu-XPS measurements were performed to characterize the variation in surface metal valence distribution of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed under different conditions. Fig. S5 shows Pt 4f and Ru 3p XPS spectra of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed in N2 at different temperatures. Deconvolution results are shown in Fig. 4 . Besides the appearance of surface zero-valent metal species, a certain proportion of metal-oxide species is detected on the surface of sample annealed in N2. Considering the un-reducibility of N2, the presence of such metallic oxide species on the surface is probably attributed to the exposure to air for the catalyst in its synthesis processes, especially in the filtering, drying, and grinding processes. Former XRD results have demonstrated the metallic bulk phase of PtRu NPs. The metal oxide species detected from XPS indicate that they are present on the NPs surface without oxidation in depth. Fig. S6 shows the Pt 4f and Ru 3p XPS spectra of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed in H2/N2 at different temperatures. Deconvolution results are shown in Fig. 4. Annealing treatment in H2/N2 can lead to the dominant distribution of zero-valent metallic species on the catalyst’s surface, which is due to the reducibility of H2/N2 (both Ruthenium oxide and Platinum oxide can be reduced by hydrogen below 200 °C [13,27,35,36]). Overall, for the influence of annealing conditions on catalyst’s surface metal valence distributions, proportion of the surface metal-oxide species follows the order as: sample annealed in N2 > sample annealed in H2/N2 (Fig. 4)."
13,Discussion,
14,The role of surface metal-oxide sites in catalytic performance,"4.1 The role of surface metal-oxide sites in catalytic performance In heterogeneous catalytic carbonyl hydrogenation, a general mechanism referred to as the “electrophilic CO activation”, is the most frequently invoked to account for the promoting effect of electropositive species on the catalyst surface [14,15,37,38]. In the CO activation, some electropositive species such as H+ [1,4], Ru4+ [13–15], Fex+ [39,40], Gax+ [40], Snx+ [40–44], Znx+ [45] can coordinate with the oxygen atom in CO bond and polarize the carbonyl group, resulting in the CO becoming vulnerable to be attacked by the hydrogen species. In this study, annealing condition selections of the catalyst can influence the catalytic performance. Conducting the annealing process in H2/N2 resulted in the decrease of both catalytic activity and selectivity compared with the catalyst annealed in N2. XPS results show that zero-valent metal species distribute dominantly on the surface after annealing in H2/N2. However, a certain proportion of surface metal-oxide species are detected in the sample annealed in N2 (Fig. 4). Therefore, there seem to exist an correlation between the surface metal-oxide species and the catalytic activity enhancement. Furthermore, comparing the sample annealed in H2/N2 at 200 °C with the sample annealed in N2 at 200 °C, such two samples exhibit the similar metal particle mean sizes but different metal-oxide species’ proportions on their surfaces. Both the catalytic activity and selectivity of sample annealed in H2/N2 at 200 °C are lower than those of the one annealed in N2 at 200 °C, which is probably due to the absence of oxidized metal species on its surface. In order to confirm this inference for the promoting effect of such surface oxidized metal species on catalysis, we designed a verification experiment as follows: after the prior annealing treatment in H2/N2, the samples were subsequently treated in O2/N2 ambience for selected period of time at room temperature to generate the surface metal-oxide species. Samples after their corresponding oxidation treatment process were evaluated in acetone and 3-pentanone hydrogenations to verify the correlation mentioned above. XRD patterns of the samples after oxidation treatment for 96 h are shown in Fig. 5 , no appearance of Ruthenium oxide or Platinum oxide species is detected, illustrating such oxidation treatment at room temperature could not lead to the oxidation of catalyst in bulk phase. The 2θ value of the strongest diffraction peak of the oxidized sample shown in Fig. 5 (2θ = 40.82°) is the same as that of the sample unoxidized shown in Fig. 1b (2θ = 40.82°), indicating such oxidation treatment at room temperature could not destroy the structure of PtRu alloy. Moreover, there are no obvious changes observed in the metal particle mean size after such oxidation treatment (Fig. S7 and Table S4). Figs. S8–S9 show Pt 4f and Ru 3p XPS spectra of 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C after oxidation treatment for selected period of time, the deconvolution results are shown in Fig. 6 . Significantly, compared with the sample unoxidized, the proportion of surface metal-oxide species gradually increases as the oxidation treatment time increases (Fig. 6). Evaluation results are shown in Table 3 , both their catalytic activity and selectivity were found increased after their oxidation treatment process, and interestingly, both the activity and selectivity increased gradually with the oxidation treatment time. One could see that, the trend of the gradual increase of catalytic activity is in accordance with the trend of the gradual increase of surface metal-oxide species’ proportion. Such verification experiment confirms the presence of surface metal-oxide species has the positive promoting effect on catalytic performance, demonstrating the increase of surface metal-oxide species’ proportion can result in both the activity and selectivity further increase. Similar phenomenon in catalytic activity variations were also found in 3-penantone hydrogenation, which confirms the objectivity of the promoting effect of such surface metal-oxide species on ketone’s carbonyl hydrogenation. Proportion of surface oxidized Ru species is more than that of oxidized Pt species when after a certain oxidation treatment period of time, indicating Ru has more affinity toward O2 due to the higher heat of adsorption of O2 than Pt (Ru is easier to be oxidized than Pt) [33]. RuO2 species can effectively activate the carbonyl group [13–15,31], the presence of RuO2 species on the NPs surface can act as eletrophilic or Lewis acid sites for the adsorption and activation of the CO bond via the lone electron pair of the oxygen atoms [14], the synergetic behavior between the surface metal-oxide site and surface zero-valent metallic site in respectively activating the corresponding carbonyl and hydrogen is the main reason of the catalytic activity enhancement after oxidation treatment. Furthermore, that the relatively higher catalytic activity of the sample annealed in N2 compared with that annealed in H2/N2 is also attributed to such surface metal-oxide species existence and the synergetic behavior mentioned above, giving the explanation of the influence of annealing atmosphere on catalytic activity in this study."
15,Discussion of the catalytic selectivity and size effect of the PtRu NPs,"4.2 Discussion of the catalytic selectivity and size effect of the PtRu NPs Compared 3Pt/C with 3Ru/C, their synthesis process are similar except the different metal precursors added, isopropyl ether could be generated on 3Pt/C where 3Ru/C could not, indicating the isopropyl ether generation is related to the metal type. Monometallic 3Pt/C may possess the specific surface active sites which is responsible for the isopropyl ether generation. Moreover, 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed in H2/N2 could also produce the isopropyl ether. LEISS results have shown their different surface metal atomic concentrations, the surface proportion/concentration of Pt atoms follows the order as: 3Pt/C > 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C > 3Ru/C (Fig. 3). Coincidentally, their selectivity to isopropyl ether follows the same order as: 3Pt/C > 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C > 3Ru/C (Table S2), indicating the isopropyl ether generation is related to Pt proportion/concentration on catalyst’s surface. Previous literature suggested that in catalytic carbonyl hydrogenation to alcohol, the metallic sites can directly generate the ether without protonic acid addition [46], in this case the ether was generated in the reaction between surface intermediates and the produced alcohol [46], which gives the enlightenment for the role of metallic sites in ether generation via CO hydrogenation. Previous DFT study indicated that isopropanol can be generated from acetone hydrogenation when the adsorption configuration of acetone molecular demonstrates a perpendicular geometries to the Pt surface (acetone is anchored to the metal surface though the carbonyl-oxygen atom) [47]. However, the appearance of the parallel modes of acetone adsorption geometries (bonding side-on via π bonding of the carbonyl) is also found and attributes to the acetone adsorbed on Pt surface defect sites (feature of highly unsaturated coordination with relatively strong chemisorptions strength), which can lead to the acetone/alcohol molecular decomposition occurrence [47–49]. In this study, we speculate that the isopropyl ether generation is related to the surface Pt defect sites. Compared with 3Pt/C, introduction of Ru into Pt (1.5Pt1.5Ru/C) can lead to the whole surface Pt proportion/concentration decrease (LEISS results), thus bringing the decrease of surface proportion of Pt atoms located at the defect sites and the resultant selectivity to isopropyl ether decrease. In heterogeneous catalysis, the catalytic performance strongly depends on the distribution of surface reactive sites. Some specific surface sites play roles in the byproduct generations, taking some action to block such byproduct generation sites is a feasible way to improve the catalytic selectivity. As is well known, Lindlar Pd catalyst is used in the selective hydrogenation of alkyne to olefin, by adding quinoline or lead acetate in the synthesis, some specific sites on Pd surface which can cause the deep hydrogenation could be effectively blocked/poisoned, leading to the resultant catalytic selectivity increase. Generally, those sites located at a high surface energy and less stable surface and some highly unsaturated defect sites (i.e., vertex and edge) can preferentially adsorb the oxygen to let the surface free energy decrease (strong oxophilic property) [50,51]. Therefore, a proper oxidation treatment for the metallic catalyst can lead to the highly unsaturated defect sites being preferentially blocked by oxygen atoms. In this study for the 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C catalyst, after treatment in O2/N2, the selectivity to isopropanol was found increased compared with the catalyst unoxidized, indicating the positive role of the surface metal-oxide species in selectivity enhancement. Such phenomenon also indicates the generation of isopropyl ether is related to the surface highly unsaturated Pt defect sites, which could be preferentially blocked by oxygen atoms through the oxidation treatment, thus resulting in the isopropyl ether generation being restricted. Similarly, the samples annealed in N2 possess the certain proportions of oxidized metal species on their surfaces, the resultant 100% selectivity to isopropanol is also attributed to these surface Pt defect sites being blocked by oxygen atoms. Performing annealing treatment in H2/N2 can lead to such Pt defect sites being exposed on the NPs surface, thus bringing the selectivity to isopropanol decrease (isopropyl ether generation). It is known that larger metal particle size favors the faster hydrogenation of CO, metal particle with larger size shows the higher TOF than smaller one [13–16]. In this study, when annealed in H2/N2, TOF increased as the annealing temperature increased, which is attributed to the essential metal particle size increase. Such size effect of PtRu NPs found in this study is consistent with the previous literature reported for CO catalytic hydrogenation [13–16]. The relatively larger metal particle has less proportion of highly unsaturated surface sites compared with the smaller one, which can result in relatively weak interaction between the reactants and metal surface. Generally, a weaker interaction of the carbonyl on the metal surface favors its faster catalytic hydrogenation [52,53]. Moreover, more balanced coverage between the two kinds of reactants can be achieved on larger NPs surface which facile the rapid hydrogenation of ketone’s carbonyl [11–13]. The ratio of defect (i.e., vertex and edge) to face atoms changes dramatically as a function of the metal particle size [11]. Smaller NPs have higher fraction of highly unsaturated surface sites compared to those larger ones, the larger degree of unsaturated bonds derives from rougher surfaces (more steps and kinks compared to smoother surfaces of larger NPs) [11,12]. When after annealing treatment in H2/N2, the surface highly unsaturated Pt defect sites can be exposed through the reduction by H2/N2 (dominant distribution of zero-valence state of Pt on the surface detected by XPS). As annealing temperature increases, the resultant increase of selectivity to isopropanol is related to the concentration decrease of those surface Pt defect sites, which is due to the PtRu NPs diameter increase. Discussion above highlights the essential relation between the isopropyl ether generation and surface Pt defect sites. The proposed catalysis process involving the production of both isopropanol and isopropyl ether on PtRu/C surface is illustrated in Fig. 7 ."
16,Catalysis mechanism and catalyst’s reusability,"4.3 Catalysis mechanism and catalyst’s reusability The catalytic acetone hydrogenation follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism [13,54], both hydrogen and acetone molecules are chemisorbed on the metal particle surface [47,55,56]. According to the previous DFT calculations for catalytic acetone hydrogenation [47], a tentative mechanism for catalytic acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol over PtRu/C is proposed and shown in Fig. 8 . The associative adsorption of acetone (perpendicular geometries to the surface) occurs since the carbonyl-oxygen atom contact to the metal surface (bonding end-on via the lone pair electrons on the oxygen atom), then the dissociated hydrogen atoms on the metal surface attack the adsorbed acetone, hydrogenation of the carbonyl-carbon atom firstly occurs with the generation of isopropoxy intermediates (partially hydrogenated intermediates), following step is the addition of an adsorbed hydrogen atom to the oxygen atom of such isopropoxy intermediates to generate the isopropanol. Since 1.5Pt1.5Ru/C annealed in N2 showed the impressive activity in catalytic hydrogenations of acetone and 3-pentanone, its reusability was also investigated. Results are shown in Fig. 9 . Slight decrease of catalytic activity was found after repeated use. We performed the XPS characterization of the spent catalyst after 2 runs of acetone hydrogenation reaction. As shown in Fig. S10–S11, compared with the fresh catalyst, the proportion of metal-oxide species on the spent catalyst’s surface is found to increase slightly, which is probably caused by exposing to air of the catalyst during recycle use process, resulting in the occurrence of catalyst’s surface oxidation. Indeed, the catalyst was separated from the liquid by filtration when each run of reaction was finished, the sticky residue on the used filter paper (a small portion of catalyst adhered) is hard to wash away, therefore the slight decrease of activity after repeated use is probably due to a small loss in the amount of catalyst after recycle use. However, the catalyst still could achieve high conversion of acetone and 3-pentanone in their respective hydrogenation reactions, demonstrating its relatively good deactivation resistance and making it attractive for future practical applications. Future research work will focus on a more-detailed study regarding the related isopropyl ether generation mechanism, development of the catalyst’s application scope is underway."
17,Conclusions,"In summary, annealing treatment of the PtRu/C catalyst was found to influence the catalytic performance significantly. Higher annealing temperature bringing higher TOF is due to the metal particle diameter increase. Metal particle with larger size favors the selectivity to isopropanol due to its less highly unsaturated surface Pt defect sites than smaller one. The presence of surface metal-oxide species is beneficial to both catalytic activity and selectivity enhancement. Oxidation treatment can lead to the metal-oxide sites generation on NPs surface, which can act as electrophilic or lewis acid sites for the adsorption and activation of carbonyl, whereas the surface metallic sites can produce the dissociative hydrogen species, their synergy facilitates the catalytic activity enhancement. Isopropyl ether generation is related to the Pt atoms located at the highly unsaturated defect sites and its proportion on the surface, which can be blocked though oxidation treatment, finally resulting in the catalytic selectivity increase. Besides the promising practical application value, our study provides fundamental understanding for the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of CO in ketones and could assist the rational design of the catalyst used in the hydrogenation of other carbonyl compounds including the esters, carboxylic acid, aldehydes, etc."
