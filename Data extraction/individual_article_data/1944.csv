0,Introduction,"Concern about global warming, which is caused by the use of petro-based fuels and chemicals, has motivated work in alternative renewable resources including bio-based fuels and chemicals (Han et al., 2015a; Kim and Han, 2016; Sun and Cheng, 2002; Takata et al., 2014). Lignocellulosic biomass, which consists of cellulose (C6), hemicellulose (C5), and lignin, is a critical feedstock for the production of bio-based renewable fuels and chemicals via three major routes (biochemical, catalytic and thermochemical) (Huber et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2016). Compared to the other routes, catalytic bio-based fuels and chemicals production from lignocellulosic biomass can be achieved by co-catalytic upgrading or catalytic upgrading separately either of C6-derived platforms (levulinic acid (LA) and γ-valerolactone (GVL)) or C5-derived platforms (furfural (FF)), after fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass using pretreatment (Kim and Han, 2016; Serrano-Ruiz et al., 2010b). Recently, heterogeneous catalysis studies for catalytic production of butene oligomers (BO), which are jet fuel-range liquid hydrocarbon fuels, based on the aforementioned platforms (FF, LA, and GVL), has received the most attention in the literature (Alonso et al., 2011; Bond et al., 2010; Serrano-Ruiz et al., 2010a,b). The previous studies reported that FF can be converted to LA and subsequently to BO via GVL production with high yields (over 63mol%) on bimetallic and acid catalysts at low concentrations (below 16wt% solids) using large volumes of solvents, thereby requiring efficient separation systems for recovery of solvents and products. To evaluate the techno-economic potential (the major technological bottlenecks and cost drivers) of lignocellulosic catalytic biofuels (BO) production strategy, we should show how system-level design studies including separation systems can be used in parallel with experimental conversion studies, thereby pointing out the way to new experimental approaches. While several system-level design studies (Han et al., 2014, 2015b; Kim and Han, 2016; Sen et al., 2012a,b,c) have focused on the development of integrated processes for the catalytic biofuels (BO) production of the lignocellulosic biomass, the simultaneous catalytic production of biofuels and biochemicals within an integrated process has received little attention in the literature. Accordingly, our goal in this paper is to show a strategy for the simultaneous catalytic production of biofuels and biochemical from the lignocellulosic biomass based on the aforementioned platforms. Compared to the previous studies, despite low overall biomass-to-fuels yields, because a portion of lignocellulosic biomass is converted for biochemicals production instead of biofuels production, this strategy allows greater flexibility to respond to market changes of bio-based products because it leads to the aforementioned platforms to be converted to a range of higher value materials (e.g., fuels additives, chemicals, and solvents). FF can be converted to carbon neutral solvents such as 2-tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), instead of liquid hydrocarbon fuels (Chen et al., 2013; Takata et al., 2014). THFA, which is an organic compound containing THF substituted with a hydroxymethyl group, has versatile characteristics including high solvency for organic and inorganic materials, chemical and thermal stability, and biodegradability (Tike and Mahajani, 2007). The global market for THFA was $173 million in 2013, and the market price was $3.0 per kg THFA (Rogowsky et al., 2009). Furthermore, THFA is an excellent replacement for glycol ethers (GE), which are used as solvents for agricultural applications (e.g., biocides, pesticides, herbicides) and are synthesized through a petro-based route from a primary alcohol and alkene oxide (e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide) (De Ketttenis, 2005). The global demand for GE was about 420,000 metric tonnes (Mt) per year in 2000 (De Ketttenis, 2005) and has been growing at an average of 3.7–4.7% per year (Chinn, 2014). The market price of GE is $2.5–2.6 per kg GE (Durkee, 2013). Moreover, THFA can replace N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and acetone solvents. The global market size for NMP was $660 million in 2013, and the global market demand for acetone was 5.9 million Mt per year in 2014 (Future Market Insights, 2015a,b). This study presents a strategy that simultaneously produces two products (BO fuel and THFA) from lignocellulosic biomass using separate catalytic conversion of C5-derived FF to chemicals (THFA) and C6-derived LA to fuels (BO). This study includes discussions of process synthesis, heat integration, and economic evaluation. The process is first synthesized, including catalytic conversion subsystems for C5 and C6 and separation subsystems for recovering solvents and biomass-derived products (THFA and BO). Then, heat integration of the proposed process is performed for reducing total energy requirements via the design of a heat exchanger network (HEN). Finally, an economic evaluation shows the minimum selling price (MSP) of THFA produced from the process when the selling price of BO is varied to demonstrate the main things that influence the MSP."
1,Methods,"The strategy reported herein combines two catalytic conversion methods: C6-to-BO and C5-to-THFA. To simultaneously produce fuels (BO) and chemicals (THFA) from corn stover, the strategy uses an integrated method (Sen et al., 2012a) to convert C6 to fuels (BO) as described in Section 2.1 and also develops an integrated method to convert C5 to chemicals (THFA) as described in Section 2.2 which shows how experimental conversion studies (xylose-to-FF (Gürbüz et al., 2012), FF-to-furfuryl alcohol (FFA) (Nagaraja et al., 2007), and FFA-to-THFA (Zhang et al., 2012)) can be combined within a system-level design study."
2,C6-to-fuels (BO),"2.1 C6-to-fuels (BO) The C6-to-fuels conversion method consists of three catalytic conversion subsystems: (i) hydrolysis and dehydration of C6 to LA (Serrano-Ruiz et al., 2010a), (ii) hydrogenation of LA to GVL (Alonso et al., 2011), and (iii) conversion of GVL to BO (Bond et al., 2010). First, LA and formic acid (FA) can be produced from C6 with a 55% molar yield in a batch reactor at 473K and 16bar using a water solution containing 8wt% C6 and dilute sulfuric acid (SA) catalyst (0.5M) (Serrano-Ruiz et al., 2010a). The remaining C6 forms a polymeric byproduct (humins) by degradation (Reaction 1 in Fig. S.1). Then, a biphasic extraction using an organic solvent (2-sec-butylphenol (SBP)) leads to separation of LA from the acidic aqueous solution (Alonso et al., 2011). After the biphasic extraction at 453K and 16bar, most of the LA and 29% of the FA are recovered in the organic phase (SBP). Most of the LA (10wt%) in the SBP can be hydrogenated to GVL with a 99% molar yield over a RuSn (1:4)/C catalyst at 493K and 36bar. The FA is decomposed to carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2), which is used as a reactant for conversion of LA to GVL (Reaction 2 in Fig. S.1) (Alonso et al., 2011). Finally, the GVL can be converted to BO over two catalyst bed reactors connected in series (Bond et al., 2010). Specifically, the 60wt% GVL in an aqueous solution can be converted to butene with near quantitative yield over a SiO2/Al2O3 catalyst at 648K and 36bar. Subsequently, most of the butene in the absence of water can be converted to BO (C8H16, C12H24, C16H32, C20H40), resulting in a mixture of gasoline and jet fuel range alkenes, over a Amberlyst-70 catalyst at 443K and 36bar (Reactions 3 and 4 in Fig. S.1)."
3,C5-to-chemicals (THFA),"2.2 C5-to-chemicals (THFA) The C5-to-THFA conversion method consists ofthree catalytic conversion subsystems for the (i) biphasic conversion of xylose to FF (Gürbüz et al., 2012), (ii) hydrogenation of FF to FFA (Nagaraja et al., 2007), and (iii) hydrogenation of FFA to THFA (Zhang et al., 2012). The xylose, which is derived from the dilute acid hydrolysis of C5 in pretreatment (Kazi et al., 2010), can be converted to FF with a high yield (78mol%) at 443K and 1bar in a biphasic reactor (Gürbüz et al., 2012). This reaction proceeds using organic (SBP) and acidic aqueous (containing 0.1M hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl)) solvents (SBP:water mass ratio=1:6.67) with 1.5wt% xylose in water (Reaction 5 in Fig. S.1). Saturating the acidic aqueous solution with NaCl increases the polarity difference between the aqueous and organic phases, and then 90% of the FF is partitioned to the organic phase (SBP). Then, after distillation of FF from the SBP solvent (to be reused in the biphasic reaction, dealt with in detail in the Section 3.2), the distilled FF can be hydrogenated to the FFA in a fixed bed reactor at 453K and 1bar over a Cu–MgO catalyst (Nagaraja et al., 2007). The hydrogenation reaction is performed under H2-rich conditions (H2:FF molar ratio=2.5:1), and most of the FF is converted to FFA with a high yield (96mol%) (Reaction 6in Fig. S.1). Finally, FFA can be hydrogenated to THFA with a high yield (91mol%) over a Ru–MnO x catalyst at 333K and 30bar in an autoclave reactor using 10wt% FFA in a water solution (Zhang et al., 2012) (Reaction 7 in Fig. S.1). In the hydrogenation of FFA, the Ru–MnO x catalyst inhibits the polymerization of FFA, and the water solvent promotes conversion of FFA. Moreover, the low temperature increases the selectivity of THFA (99.8%) in the reaction because FFA-to-THFA conversion requires a lower activation energy than other side reactions (e.g., FFA-to-1,2-pentanediol(1,2-PeD), FFA-to-1,4-pentanediol)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Design basis and assumptions,"3.1 Design basis and assumptions This work developed a simulation model for the strategy reported here including seven main processing steps using the ASPEN Plus Process Simulator. Based on experimental data and simulation results, the capital costs for the two main processing steps (C6-to-BO and C5-to-THFA) were estimated using the ASPEN Process Economic Analyzer, while the capital costs of the other steps (biomass handling, pretreatment, wastewater treatment (WWT), boiler/turbogenerator, and storage) were scaled based on the equipment size and cost data used in the benchmark lignocellulosic ethanol production strategy proposed in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)’s design (Humbird et al., 2011; Kazi et al., 2010) using an exponential scaling expression. Total costs (capital and utility costs) of the HEN were calculated using the ASPEN Energy Analyzer. This process adopted the same feedstock (corn stover), processing rate (2000 dry Mt per day) and economic parameters in NREL’s design (Humbird et al., 2011) (Table S.1 in the ESI)."
6,Process synthesis: design A – with electricity generation,"3.2 Process synthesis: design A – with electricity generation An integrated process was developed based on the catalytic conversion technologies presented in the previous section for simultaneous production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels (BO) and chemicals (THFA) from C6 to C5 fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. The integrated process consists of seven main processing steps: biomass handling, pretreatment, wastewater treatment, boiler/turbogenerator, storage, C6-to-BO and C5-to-THFA (Fig. 1 ). Corn stover (2000 Mt per day) is first shredded to reduce its size by physical treatment in the biomass handling step, and it is then sent to a chemical pretreatment step for separation of the C5 from the C6 and lignin. In the pretreatment section, most of the C5 is converted to soluble xylose (92.5mol%) and FF (5mol%) using a dilute SA (0.5M) catalyst (Kazi et al., 2010). Then, the liquid mixture (containing xylose, FF, water, and SA) is separated from insoluble materials (containing C6 and lignin) through filtration. The insoluble materials are sent to the C6 conversion to BO subprocess for fuels production, while the liquid mixture is sent to the C5 conversion to THFA subprocess for chemicals production after neutralization with Ca(OH)2 (lime) and removal of gypsum by precipitation. The C6-to-BO includes six subprocessing steps, as shown in Fig. S.5 including: LA production, SA recovery, GVL production, SBP recovery for C6 conversion, butene production, and butene oligomerization. After conversion of C6 to LA (R-1 in Fig. S.5; Reaction 1 in Fig. S.1), insoluble materials (lignin and humins) are removed from the liquid mixture (containing LA, FA, water, and SA) using a pressure filter (S-1 in Fig. S.5) with the addition of water (feed:water mass ratio=1:1.16). Then, the C6-derived platforms (LA and recycled GVL) are extracted using SBP (feed:SBP mass ratio=1:4.4) at 453K and 16bar in the SA recovery step. After the 6 stages of extraction, 100% of the LA, 29% of the FA, and 97% of the recycled GVL are extracted with the organic solvent (SBP), while the aqueous phase (containing SA) is recycled to LA production (R-1 in Fig. S.5; Reaction 1 in Fig. S.1). The extracted LA is converted to GVL in the presence of SBP (R-2 in Fig. S.5; Reaction 2 in Fig. S.1), and 80% of the CO2 in the GVL-SBP stream is separated out in a flash tank at 380K (S-3 in Fig. S.5). Then, 99% of the GVL is recovered in a 33-stage distillation column (D-1 in Fig. S.5). After the GVL-SBP distillation, 95wt% of the GVL is obtained at the top of the distillation column (D-1 in Fig. S.5) at 347K and 1bar. In addition, 99.8% of the SBP is recovered at the bottom of the distillation column at 512K, and it is recycled to the SA recovery step for extraction of LA. The GVL obtained from distillation is converted to butene, then it is oligomerized to BO through the two catalyst bed reactors (R-3 and R-4 in Fig. S.5; Reactions 3 and 4 in Fig. S.1). To adjust the reaction conditions of each reactor, a 20-stage distillation column (D-2 in Fig. S.5) is located on between the two catalyst bed reactors. During distillation, 99.9% of the butene is obtained at the top at 378K and 1bar, and the bottoms liquid is sent to the wastewater treatment step. Finally, the liquid fuel BO (125 Mt/d) is formed by removing 94.9% of the CO2 in a flash tank (S-4 in Fig. S.5). The C5-to-THFA consists of four subprocessing steps, as shown in Fig. 2 : FF production, FFA production, SBP recovery for C5 conversion, and THFA production. The aqueous stream (containing xylose and water) extracted during pretreatment is sent to a biphasic (SBP/water) reactor for converting xylose to FF (R-5 in Fig. 2; Reaction 5 in Fig. S.1). In a biphasic decanter withinthe biphasic reactor (R-5 in Fig. 2), the organic (SBP solvent) stream (containing FF and humins) is separated from the aqueous stream (containing unconverted xylose). After FF-SBP distillation, 99.9wt% of FF is obtained from the top of a 15-stage distillation column (D-3 in Fig. 2) at 453K and 1bar. It is then converted to FFA in a fixed bed reactor under H2-rich conditions (R-6 in Fig. 2; Reaction 6 in Fig. S.1). Then, 99% of the unreacted H2 gas is separated in a flash tank at 393K (S-5 in Fig. 2) and is recycled back to R-6. In addition, 90% of the FFA-rich stream is sent to a catalytic autoclave reactor for conversion to THFA (R-7 in Fig. 2; Reaction 7 in Fig. S.1), and the remainder is sent to a boiler/turbogenerator (Kazi et al., 2010) for producing heat to satisfy the heating requirements for the integrated process. After the FFA-to-THFA conversion (R-7 in Fig. 2), the THFA in the resulting mixture (containing H2O, FFA, 1,2-PeD and humins) is purified through distillation columns connected in series (D-4 and D-5 in Fig. 2). The mixture is first sent to a 40-stage distillation column (D-4 in Fig. 2) for removing 99% of the water. Then, the remaining mixture is sent to another 40-stage distillation column (D-5 in Fig. 2) for recovering 99wt% THFA. About 70% of the THFA (156 Mt/d) is recovered by the distillation columns (D-4 and D-5 in Fig. 2). The recovery rate of THFA in the distillation columns is limited to below 70%, because the boil-up and reflux ratios of the distillation columns sharply increased at over 70%. This is because the boiling points of THFA (450K) and FFA (443K) are very similar, and they have an azeotrope (451K) at 1atm. The recovery and reuse of SBP is an important issue because large volumes of SBP are used as extractive solvents for C6-derived platforms (LA and GVL) as well as reactive solvents for producing C5-derived platforms (FF). Thus, this process requires an effective SBP recovery step including distillation, pressure filtration, and decanting (details are given in the ESI). After the SBP recovery step, 99% of SBP is recycled back to the biphasic reactor (R-5 in Fig. 2), and the separated humins are sent to the boiler/turbogenerator step (Kazi et al., 2010). High-pressure (HP) steam is produced in a boiler by combusting humins, and 96% of the steam is supplied to the integrated process and the remaining steam is used for generation of electricity. This process design showed that the overall biomass to fuels and THFA molar yield is 35.4%, while the C6-to-fuels and C5-to-chemicals yields are 43.0% and 41.5%, respectively. A detailed process flow diagram with associated stream data is given in the ESI."
7,Design B – without electricity generation,"3.3 Design B – without electricity generation The design A (presented in Section 3.2) includes a turbogenerator for satisfying process electricity requirements and making revenue with excess electricity sales. However, the cost of the turbogenerator unit is very high (35–40% of total capital cost) (Han et al., 2014). Moreover, THFA production rates could decrease due to increasing combustion rates of C5-derived FFA required to generate process electricity. Thus, this study developed an design B, in which there is no electricity generation, resulting in an increasing conversion rate of FFA to THFA (using 93% of FFA) and a decreasing combustion rate of FFA to heat (using 7% of FFA) compared to the design A (using 90% of FFA for THFA production). In this design, the electricity requirements of the process are satisfied by external sources, and biomass residues are only combusted to provide the heating requirements of the process. In the following sections, the difference between the design A and design B will be presented in terms of energy efficiency and economic feasibility."
8,Heat integration and energy efficiency,"3.4 Heat integration and energy efficiency In this strategy, 2000 Mt of biomass (corn stover) per day is processed to produce fuels and chemicals. The biomass has an energy content of 358MW (megawatt) that consists of C6 and C5 (220MW, 61.4% of biomass), lignin (98MW, 27.4% of biomass), and other components (40MW, 11.2% of biomass). In this strategy, production of biomass derivatives at low concentrations (1.3–10wt% solids) using large volumes of solvents required nine distillation columns to recover the maximum amount of chemicals and solvents (GVL, butene, FF, THFA, and SBP), resulting in increasing heating requirements for both process designs. Thus, this study performed heat integration between hot and cold process streams to reduce the energy requirements (Kemp, 2011). The heating requirements of the design A were 361MW, and after heat integration 203MW of heat was recovered (reducing the heating requirements to 158MW). In the design A, the energy content of the biomass residues is 230MW, and it can produce 158MW of heat and 2.2MW of electricity, when the biomass-to-heat production efficiency is 71% and biomass-to-electricity generation efficiency is 30% (Humbird et al., 2011). For the design B, the heating requirements are 365MW, and after the heat integration it decreases to 161MW by recovering 204MW of heat. Therefore, the heating requirements for both process designs were satisfied by combustion of biomass residues (229MW). The energy flow diagram in Fig. 3 presents the energy efficiency, i.e., the ratio of the energy output from BO, THFA and electricity to energy input (biomass feedstock), for both process designs. The design A produced 67MW of BO, 51MW of THFA and 0.1MW of electricity from biomass (358MW), thus the energy efficiency is 33.0%. In the case of the design B, 67MW of liquid fuels and 53MW of THFA were produced and 2MW of external electricity was used, thus the energy efficiency is 32.7%. Therefore, the energy efficiency for the design A was 0.3% higher than the design B."
9,Economic evaluation,"3.5 Economic evaluation 3.5.1 Capital and operating costs In this section, the annualized capital and operating costs for both process designs are compared, as shown in Table 1 . The annualized capital costs were estimated using the total capital investment (TCI) and the capital charge rate (CCR) calculated from a discount cash flow analysis (details are shown in the ESI). Here, the TCI includes direct costs (e.g., installed equipment cost, instrumentation) and indirect costs (e.g., engineering, contingency). The total annualized capital cost for the design A was calculated to be $49.3 million per year, which is 8.2% higher than the design B ($45.6 million per year) because the design A includes a larger boiler and a turbogenerator ($3.7 million per year of difference). The boiler/turbogenerator is the largest portion (25%) of total annualized capital cost for the design A, while the THFA production is the largest portion (24%) of total annualized cost for the design B. The total operating cost for the design A was $89.9 million per year, which is 1.2% lower than the design B ($91.0 million per year) mainly because additional electricity cost ($1.1 million per year) is required for the design B. The largest portion of the total operating costs for both process designs (49–50%) was feedstock costs ($45.2 million per year) that include harvesting, transportation, and storage costs. The second major portion of the total operating cost is other raw material costs (H2, HCl, NaCl, SA, lime, and SBP; $22.6 million per year (design A) and $22.4 million per year (design B)). The other portions are fixed operating costs (including labor, overhead, insurance, and maintenance costs; $11.2 million per year (design A) and $11.0 million per year (design B)) and catalyst regeneration costs (including maintenance and refurbishing costs; $5.5 million per year (design A) and $5.6 million per year (design B)). The total costs (TC) were calculated as a sum of the annualized capital and operating costs, and the TCs were $139.2 million per year (design A) and $136.6 million per year (design B). 3.5.2 Minimum selling price A MSP of THFA that makes the net present value to be zero was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis in NREL’s design (Humbird et al., 2011) based on capital and operating costs. The MSP of THFA was expressed in terms of $ per kg of THFA. The MSP of THFA for the design B ($1.56 per kg THFA) was 10 ¢ per kg THFA lower than the design A ($1.66 per kg THFA) because the TC for the design B ($136.6 million per year) is 1.9% lower than the design A ($139.2 million per year) and the annual production rate of THFA for the design B (55872 Mt per year) is 3.3% larger than the design A (54070 Mt per year). The liquid hydrocarbon fuels (BO) credits obtained in the design B were $0.91 per kg THFA (37% of the overall costs of THFA ($2.48 per kg THFA)) when the selling price of BO is $3.27 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE), which corresponds to that for the lignocellulosic bioethanol process of in NREL’s design (Humbird et al., 2011). Thus, the MSPs of THFA for both designs were 44.7–48.0% ($1.34–$1.44 per kg) lower than that of the current market price ($3.0 per kg) (Rogowsky et al., 2009). 3.5.3 Sensitivity analysis In this strategy, the liquid hydrocarbon fuels (BO) and chemicals (THFA) were produced simultaneously as products. In the previous section, this study calculated the MSP of THFA when the selling price of the liquid hydrocarbon fuels is fixed to $3.27 per GGE (Humbird et al., 2011). Due to variations in the market supply and demand of biofuels, the selling price of BO could change. So, we carried out a sensitivity analysis to identify the impacts of selling price of BO on the MSP of THFA for the design B, as shown in Fig. 4 . When considering the current market price of petro-based fuels ($2.00 per GGE), the MSP of THFA would increase to $1.91 per kg THFA (Energy Information Administration, 2016). When there is no sales of BO, the MSP of THFA increased to $2.47 per kg THFA, which is still lower than that of the current market price ($3.0 per kg) (Rogowsky et al., 2009). Otherwise, the MSP of THFA decreased to $1.08 per kg THFA when the selling price of BO increased to $5.00 per GGE. Because different yields of BO and THFA can be obtained with different types (compositions) of lignocellulosic biomass, the selection of the most appropriate lignocellulosic biomass is crucial. Among other lignocellulosic biomass types, switch grass which has the highest content of C5 (26wt%) (Han et al., 2014) used for THFA production can be considered for this strategy. When switch grass was used as a feedstock for the strategy (design B) instead of corn stover, despite higher (10%) production of THFA the production yields of BO decreased by 13% because of lower content of C6 (36wt%) of switch grass than corn stover (41wt% of C6 and 24wt% of C5)(Han et al., 2014). It means that corn stover is more profitable than switch grass for this strategy."
10,Conclusions,"This study developed a strategy for simultaneous catalytic production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels (BO) and chemicals (THFA) from C6 to C5 of lignocellulosic biomass. In this strategy, design A (generating electricity internally) and design B (purchasing electricity externally) were developed. The design B was not better for energy efficiency (32.7%), but it was more economically feasible ($1.56 per kg THFA) compared to the design A ($1.66 per kg THFA, 33.0%). The MSP of THFA for the design B could increase to $1.91 per kg THFA, which reflects the current market price of petro-based gasoline range fuels (BO) ($2.00 per GGE)."
