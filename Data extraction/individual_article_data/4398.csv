0,Introduction,"The design of new, robust, environmentally benign and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts capable for oxidation of alcohols under sustainable conditions is of great significance for the production of fine chemicals [1–2]. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are an immense class of anionic transition metal oxide clusters and have been extensively exploited as intrinsic oxidation catalysts owing to their tenability of redox and acid properties [3–6]. Moreover, in POMs chemistry incorporation of organic units to POM-anions has received considerable interest as an efficient approach to broaden the utilizations of POM-derived materials [7]. Within this context, the functionalized organic ionic liquid (IL) cations, especially amino-functionalized ILs, have been extensively recognized to be among the most effective modifiers for POMs in order to increase the catalytic activity of POMs in the selective oxidation reactions [8–10]. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient POM-based IL materials for various organic transformations, most of these catalysts result in liquid phase homogeneous or biphasic reaction systems which limit the clean separation and recycling of the catalysts [9,11–12]. Therefore, for practical applications in industry, it is imperative to immobilize the catalytically active POM-based ILs onto porous materials which offers the advantage of high surface area, facile recycling and reuse [13]. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), as a new class of functional materials, are crystalline porous materials constructed from metal ions held in place by multidendate organic linkers [14–15]. These materials are outstanding candidates as catalyst support because of their large porosity with accessible cages and resulting potential applications [16]. MOFs have been reported to accommodate various active centers within their nanocages via a postsynthetic strategy [17–20]. Among the different classes of MOFs, MIL-100 and MIL-101 families, exhibit great potential due to their large surface area with accessible cages, numerous accessible Lewis acid sites upon dehydration, and high hydrothermal and chemical stability [21–22]. Although there are some reports about the preparation of POM-based ILs hybrid materials using mesoporous silica and magnetic nanoparticles [23–28], to the best of our knowledge, there is only one report on the utilization of IL using MOFs as solid support for the immobilization of POMs [29]. In the latter case, a heteropolyanion-based IL was encapsulated within the framework of MIL-100. The prepared catalyst exhibited an enhanced catalytic performance in the esterification of oleic acid in comparison to the encapsulated heteropolyanion within the framework. The presence of sulfonic acid group-functionalized IL led to an increased number of acid sites which resulted in a higher catalytic activity of the prepared material [29]. In the present study, we report on the immobilization of a dual amino-functionalized ionic liquid (DAIL) onto a MOF support to design a new heterogenized POM-based IL catalyst. For this purpose, MIL-100(Fe) with low toxicity and environmentally-friendly character which is known to show very high air, water and thermal stability was applied as solid support. The coordinatively unsaturated iron sites (CUS) in the MIL-100(Fe) structure are used as anchoring points onto which DAIL molecules can be grafted through one of the amino groups and the second amino group remains available as a chemically reactive site. In addition, the supported dual amino-functionalized ionic liquid was applied for immobilization of the H3PW4O24 (HPW4) inside the nanocages of MIL-100(Fe) through anion exchange. The covalent attachment of the IL onto the stable MIL-100(Fe) support followed by the additional interactions between DAIL and PW4 molecules is an efficient strategy to prevent the leaching of the metal ions and, therefore, to create a truly heterogenized catalyst. The catalytic activity of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) material was evaluated in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The remaining free amino groups in DAIL play an important role in enhancing the accessibility of TBHP through the formation of hydrogen bonds which leads in an increased catalytic performance."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Characterization of immobilized PW4 onto the supported DAIL (PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe)),"2.1 Characterization of immobilized PW4 onto the supported DAIL (PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe)) 2.1.1 X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption and thermogravimetric analysis MIL-100(Fe) is a three-dimensional iron(III) carboxylate MOF and has a rigid zeotype crystal structure which presents high and regular mesoporous cages of 25 and 29Å accessible through windows of ca. 5 and 9Å [30]. Interestingly, the existence of the coordinatively unsaturated iron sites (CUSs) in the framework provides opportunities for incorporating active species. Within this context, the treatment of the activated MIL-100(Fe) with the prepared DAIL resulted in the strong coordination between the metal centers and the amino groups of the DAIL to afford DAIL/MIL-100(Fe). In the next step, the immobilization of the PW4 onto the supported DAIL was performed through the anion exchange between the corresponding cluster and DAIL. The PW4 cluster with the dimensions of about 6.2×9Å has the appropriate size to diffuse through the larger windows of the framework. The schematic illustration for the preparation of the catalyst is shown in Scheme S2. The phase purity and crystallinity of MIL-100(Fe) and the post-modified materials were examined by using XRD analysis (Fig. 1 ). The pattern of the pristine MIL-100(Fe) corresponds well with the simulated one indicating the phase purity and crystallinity of the MIL-100(Fe) under the applied synthetic conditions. The XRD pattern of the functionalized MIL-100(Fe) with the DAIL groups is in good accordance with the pristine MIL-100(Fe), which implies that the crystal structure remained intact after the introduction of the DAIL groups. In the XRD pattern of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst, all the diffraction peaks appear in agreement with the pristine MIL-100(Fe) which show the stability of the framework during the modification process. Fig. 2 , shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of MIL-100(Fe) and the modified materials. The MIL-100(Fe) isotherm exhibits a mixture of type I/IV curves with H2-type hysteresis loop and indicates the presence of both micro- and mesopores. The BET surface area and total pore volume for the prepared MIL-100 is 985m2 g−1 and 0.49cm3 g−1, respectively. After the introduction of the DAIL groups by the postsynthetic modification route, the surface area of DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) decreases and the corresponding pore volume is lower than that of pristine MIL-100(Fe) (644m2 g−1 and 0.32mlg−1) owing to the insertion of the DAIL groups into the nanocages of the framework. The modified sample still possesses a large surface area to provide sufficient space for the introduction of PW4 species. As expected, the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) material presents a significant reduction in the surface area and pore volume (204m2 g−1 and 0.21mlg−1) compared to the DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) sample which is a clear indication of the successful immobilization of the PW4 inside the framework. The textural properties of all the samples are listed in Table S1. In order to investigate the thermal behavior of the pristine MIL-100 and PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst, thermogravimetric analysis was conducted. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 3 . In the TGA curve of the pristine MIL-100(Fe), two weight loss steps can be seen. The first weight loss of about 32%, corresponding to the loss of water molecules, occurred in the range 30–110°C. In the second step (between 360 and 500°C), the main weight loss of about 40% results from the framework decomposition. The existence of the DAIL and PW4 molecules in MIL-100(Fe) was also confirmed by means of TGA. As expected, PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst exhibits a lower initial weight loss than MIL-100(Fe) (about 5% up to 110°C) since the pores of MIL-100(Fe) were occupied by DAIL and PW4 molecules. Upon further heating, there is about 19% weight loss between 300 and 470°C, which is owing to the combustion of the organic components attached to the iron centers through postsynthetic modification and the carboxylate linkers of the framework. It is interesting to note that, an enhanced thermal stability of attached DAIL groups compared to the free ones, which starts to decompose at 248°C [31], is observed due to the strong coordination between the metal centers and the amino groups of the DAIL. After 500°C, a shoulder can be seen in the TGA curve with a weight loss of about 8%, which is assigned to the decomposition of the PW4 POM. The TGA curve of PW4/MIL-100(Fe) is presented in Fig. S1. As shown, the framework of MIL-100(Fe) and HPW4/MIL-100(Fe) separately begins to collapse between 360 and 500°C, revealing similar thermal stability. However, the weight loss of HPW4/MIL-100(Fe) is much lower than that of the isolated MIL-100(Fe) due to the incorporation of polyoxoanion into the “MIL-100(Fe) framework”. 2.1.2 Spectroscopic analysis In order to confirm the successful synthesis of the modified MIL-100(Fe) materials, the FT-IR spectra of all materials were obtained and are shown in Fig. 4 . In the FT-IR spectrum of DAIL, the characteristic peaks of the imidazole fragment appear at 1576 and 1623cm−1 which can be assigned to the vibrations of the CC and CN groups [32]. The bands at 1094 and 1171cm−1 can be ascribed to the CN and CC stretching vibrations of the alkyl chain [32]. The bands at 2873 and 2952cm−1 are assigned to aliphatic CH asymmetric and symmetrical stretching vibrations of alkyl chain. All these characteristic vibrations of the DAIL group are present in the FT-IR spectrum of the DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) sample which clearly confirms the successful attachment of the DAIL to the free iron sites. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the characteristic bands at approximately 1069, 968 and 891cm−1 appeared in the FT-IR spectrum of the supported PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe), which can be assigned to the vibrations of PO, WO and WOW in the POM respectively [33]. Moreover, the band at 814cm−1 is due to the OO vibrations of the peroxo groups in the polyoxotungstate. These FT-IR results indicate that PW4 molecules have been successfully inserted into the nanocages of the DAIL/MIL-100(Fe). The magnified view of the FT-IR spectrum of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) material is shown in Fig. S2. Further evidences for the presence of the DAIL and POM molecules in the modified samples were provided by CHN and EDX analysis. The CHN elemental analysis of the DAIL(0.9)/MIL-100(Fe) (C, 35.34; H, 2.59; N, 4.95%) and PW4/DAIL(0.9)/MIL-100(Fe) (C, 35.43; H, 2.56; N, 4.91%) indicated that the DAIL groups were effectively inserted into MIL-100(Fe). The EDX spectrum of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst (Fig. S3) clearly confirms the presence of W and P elements, indicating immobilization of PW4 into the DAIL/MIL-100(Fe). The metal contents were also determined by ICP-OES which revealed the existence of 0.96mmolg−1 W and 2.6mmolg−1 Fe in the prepared PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst. The obtained results of the elemental analyses are given in Table S2."
3,Catalytic tests,"2.2 Catalytic tests Selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, without over-oxidation to less valuable acids, is of great importance in the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals [34]. Within this context, the catalytic performance of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was tested. The results of the catalytic activity of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) material are given in Table 1 . In the absence of the catalyst, no significant conversion of benzyl alcohol was observed. To clarify the catalytic role of the prepared PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst, the oxidation reaction was also done using the unmodified MIL-100(Fe) as catalyst. MIL-100(Fe) with unsaturated metal centers at the nodes showed 38% conversion of the benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. It was found that the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) was much more active than the DAIL free (HPW4/MIL-100(Fe)) catalyst. Further tests were carried out to determine the effect of DAIL groups on the catalytic properties of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst. Therefore, various amounts of DAIL were loaded onto the material. A catalyst loading of 1.5μmol based on PW4 was used for each catalytic test to have a fair comparison of the role of DAIL groups. As can be observed in Table 1, with increasing the DAIL loading from 0.6mmolg−1 to 1.2mmolg−1 the conversion increased. Based on these data, it can be concluded that the presence of DAIL groups within the framework of MIL-100(Fe) has a positive effect to achieve excellent catalytic activity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The hydrophilic amino-functionalized IL moiety in the framework, especially, the remaining free amino groups anchored on the imidazolium, play a crucial role in achieving excellent catalytic activity by enhancing the accessibility of TBHP. Yang et al. examined the catalytic epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene over vanadium exchanged faujasite zeolite catalysts (V-X), using (TBHP) as the oxidant and a representative IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide as the co-solvent (along with DMF) [35]. The superior catalytic activity of this IL-involved catalytic system was mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonding between the IL and the by-product t-butanol that prevents the coordination of t-butanol with the vanadium center and hence improves the catalytic efficiency. These results revealed that the combination of ILs and the catalytic active centers can promote the catalytic efficiency of catalysts in the oxidation reaction by enhancing the accessibility of oxidants through hydrogen bonding. In an attempt to explore the role of solvent, different solvents were used. The conversion of benzyl alcohol improves in the presence of chloroform compared with dichloromethane and acetonitrile. In addition, the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst also exhibited more catalytic activity when TBHP was used as oxidant. A hot filtration experiment confirmed the heterogeneous nature of the PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst (Fig. 5 ). After the removal of the catalyst, the benzaldehyde formation stopped immediately, suggesting that the catalysis is truly heterogeneous. Furthermore, the reusability of the catalyst was investigated in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the optimized reaction conditions. The results presented in Table 1 indicate no significant loss of activity and selectivity after four recycles. In addition, ICP-OES analysis of the filtrate showed no considerable tungsten content in the filtrate after four successive runs (0.00036wt%). Further evidence for the high stability of the catalyst was confirmed by XRD analysis. The similarity of the XRD patterns of PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) before and after each catalytic run clearly proves the stability of the structure under the applied reaction conditions (Fig. S4)."
4,Conclusion,"Postsynthetic modification of MIL-100(Fe) with a dual amino-functionalized cation-tethered ionic liquid, 1,3-di-(2′-aminoethyl)-2-methylimidazolium bromide (DAIL), and subsequent immobilization of peroxopolyoxotungstate (PW4O24 3−, PW4) afforded a heterogeneous catalyst for oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The prepared catalyst was found to be very efficient heterogeneous catalyst due to its capability to form hydrogen bonds and enhancing the accessibility of TBHP. The PW4/DAIL/MIL-100(Fe) catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance in the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol with a selectivity>99% towards benzaldehyde without forming over-oxidized products. Moreover, the catalyst can be recovered and reused for at least four times with no decrease in catalytic efficiency."
