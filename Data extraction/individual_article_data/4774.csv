0,Introduction,"Recently there has been a wide interest in negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV–) centers in diamond. NV– centers are promising candidates for single photon emission [1–3], optical qubit systems with long coherence time at room temperature [4–7], and electric and magnetic sensors [8–10]. Many applications require that the NV– centers to be a few nanometers from the diamond surface [11,12]. Moreover, incorporation of nitrogen impurities into the diamond lattice with minimum structural damage is another challenge [13–15]. Usually, the production of NV– centers requires the incorporation of nitrogen in the diamond lattice followed by its activation by ion and electron irradiation, and a high temperature annealing. This procedure was found to be necessary to enhance NV– centers concentration in the diamond lattice [16,17]. Different techniques can be utilized to incorporate nitrogen in the diamond near-surface region, typically few nanometers from the surface. One way is by implanting low-energy nitrogen ions into the diamond; however, the damage to the diamond surface structure is inevitable. Another way is by introducing N2 gas during diamond growth process for a short-time followed by a diamond capping layer growth in plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [18]. But this method suffers from low nitrogen concentration (1016 cm−3) due to presence of other active species (CH4 and H2) which result in a complex growth chemistry. Another possibility, recently investigated by our group, is by exposing the diamond surface to pure N2 plasma generated by radio frequency (RF) [19–21] or microwave (MW) source [22,23], followed by a diamond layer overgrowth [24,25]. We reported the fabrication of a nanometrically thin (<3 nm) N delta doped diamond layer comprising a maximum nitrogen concentration of ~1.8×1020 atoms.cm−3 in diamond (100) by nitrogen termination followed by in situ diamond capping layer growth by MWCVD while maintaining the pristine diamond quality [26]. The N delta layer produced in that study was at ~158 ± 2 nm from the diamond surface as determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS). Scanning transmission electron microscopy showed that the overgrown diamond layer displays a very high crystallinity and grew homoepitaxially onto the diamond (100) substrate. The as-fabricated N delta doped diamond (100) was examined, without any further treatments like electron irradiation, ion irradiation or annealing, by optical confocal depth scans for collecting the room temperature photoluminescence (PL) emanated from the N delta layer, which showed a clear and intense peak associated with NV– emission [26]. These optical confocal experiments combined with a microwave scheme for optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements revealed a 8% ODMR contrast and 2 MHz line width [26]. These results are competitive to previous studies in which high density of NV– centers were produced by implantation followed by long annealing processes [27]. This is a most important result as it shows that high density N delta layers rendering a high NV– PL activity can be grown without further processing. This could be due to the presence of naturally occurring defects at the interface of the nitrogen terminated surface and the growing diamond capping layer. Moreover, we showed that our N delta doping method can be used to realize topographic nanostructures NV patterning, which may have great potential in various quantum technologies by increasing substantially the interaction cross-section between the NV ensembles and molecules, spins or nanophotonic elements such as plasmonics [28] in their vicinity. It was reported that hydrogen presence on the diamond surface shows detrimental effects on the spin properties of shallow NV– centers by converting NV– to NV0 [29]. So, it is important to understand the hydrogen incorporation or adsorption onto the diamond surface, where the capping layer growth is carried out using a hydrogen-rich (~97–99%) gas mixture, to further enhance the NV– centers spin properties for applications in NV ensembles based magnetometry, quantum diamond microscopy, etc. The hydrogen spin impurities such as H1 [30,31] and H2 [30] defect centers and NVH [32] center are paramagnetic and thermally stable at elevated temperatures (1500 °C) [31,33]. High concentration of these spin impurities leads to short coherence time of the NVs which in turn diminish the NV sensitivity [34]. The nitrogen activation (MW(N2), RF(N2) or low-energy N2 + implantation) applied to promote its incorporation onto the diamond surface and sub-surface region may have a large influence on the properties of the N delta layers considering that different levels of surface defects and bonding configurations influence the physico-chemical processes that occur at initial stages of the subsequent growth stage of the capping layer by CVD. For example, it is expected that nitrogen etching by activated hydrogen and the level of hydrogen incorporation during the capping layer formation will be affected by the nature of the surface and near surface species formed during the nitrogen termination processes. Furthermore, the level of defects in the N delta layer region and the nitrogen and hydrogen distribution are expected to be also influenced by the nature of the initially nitrogen terminated diamond surface. Whilst of large importance, these effects were not previously investigated. In this work, we investigated the influence of nitrogen activation processes applied to terminate the diamond surface by nitrogen on the properties of the subsequently created N delta layer in terms of its nitrogen and hydrogen distribution and concentrations. Nitrogen delta doped diamond layers are prepared in diamond (100) by first nitriding the diamond (100) surfaces by three different nitridation methods (i.e., 200 and 5000 eV N2 + implantation, RF(N2) and MW(N2) plasma exposure) followed by a very thin diamond capping layer grown by CVD from a methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) gas mixture. The nitrogen and hydrogen concentration profiles in the N delta doped layer were investigated by (TOF-SIMS). The chemical state of the as nitrogen terminated surfaces (after nitrogen termination by the three above mentioned processes, i.e., before the diamond capping layer deposition) was investigated by surface electron spectroscopic (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS)) methods on polycrystalline diamond (PCD) films to understand the different nitrogen bonding configurations and concentration, hydrogen bonding and surface defects levels onto which the delta layer is formed. The chemical state of these surfaces was investigated after vacuum annealing to 300 and 700 °C. It is expected that the capping diamond layer growth occurs on a chemical state similar to that obtained after annealing to 700 °C. From our previous RF(N2) plasma “damaging” and “non-damaging” conditions studies, it is expected that for the same nitrogen activation processes similar level of local defects as reflected in the C(1s) C=C XP spectral component and the amount of incorporated nitrogen (from the N(1s) and C(1s) XP intensities) occur on the polycrystalline and diamond (100) surfaces [20,21]. However, some differences in the nitrogen bonding configuration were observed between these two cases as reflected in the N(1s) XP line shape. Whereas the chemical and structural properties of the nitrogen terminated PCD surfaces following exposure to the RF(N2) and MW(N2) plasmas and their thermal stability were previously investigated, those terminated by low-energy N2 + implantation were not yet reported and are presented in this study. Then the properties of the N delta layers, produced following all these nitridation processes, in terms of nitrogen and hydrogen concentrations and distributions are rationalized and correlated with the structural and chemical properties of the as-nitrided surfaces. The crystallinity of the diamond capping layer was examined by Raman spectroscopy using two incident laser wavelengths of 325 and 532 nm. These wavelengths were applied to enhance detection sensitivity of the possible sp2 bonded carbon (by 532 nm laser) present in the capping layer and to enhance the contribution of the top capping layer to the spectrum (by 325 nm laser). Finally, for one of the nitrogen termination processes, it is demonstrated fabrication of highly-dense and nanometrically thin double delta layer."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation Type IIa diamond (100) (3×3×0.3 and 7×5×0.3 mm3, Element Six, UK) having N%<1 ppm was cleaned in acetone and alcohol for 10 min in an ultrasonic-bath to remove any possible surface contamination followed by exposing to MW(H2) plasma for 10 min (pressure 80 Torr, power 2500 W) to remove any oxygen contamination and possible defective carbon structures. The as-prepared diamond was transferred to an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system with a base pressure of 1.33×10−7 Pa. The sample was annealed in situ to 1000 °C to remove possible oxygen residues adsorbed (upon ambient exposure) during the sample transfer to UHV system. N delta layers were created in diamond (100) by three different nitrogen incorporation methods (i.e., N2 + implantation, RF(N2) plasma and MW(N2) plasma exposure) followed by capping layer growth in hot-filament (HF) or MWCVD system. The RF(N2) plasma nitridation was carried out by exposing the diamond surface to RF(N2) plasma at two conditions, namely, RF(N2) non-damage (pressure (P) = 9.3 Pa and N2 flow rate = 14 sccm) and RF(N2) damage (P = 4.0 Pa and N2 flow rate = 11 sccm) using an ‘indirect source’ low-frequency RF plasma generator (40 kHz) (Model PCS40, Diener) operated at power of 36 W for 30 min at room temperature in an UHV system previously described [20,21]. The N2 + implantation was performed at P = 2.66 mPa using N2 + ions accelerating voltage of 200 and 5000 eV (dose = ~5×1016 ions.cm−2) at room temperature. Following each nitridation step (for both RF(N2) plasma exposure and N2 + implantation), the diamond sample was transferred (under ambient conditions) to a HFCVD chamber to grow the diamond capping layer. A precursor gas mixture of CH4 and H2 at a ratio of 1:99 (CH4:H2) was used for capping layer deposition. The filament (Re) temperature, pressure and substrate temperature during the capping layer deposition were 2000 °C, 40 Torr and 750 °C, respectively; the details of the system can be found elsewhere [35]. The MW(N2) plasma nitridation was carried out by exposing the diamond surface to MW(N2) plasma at P = 1.47 kPa and MW power of 600 W for 15 min. The estimated nitridation temperature was ~100–150 °C. Next, the capping layer was grown (in situ) using a precursor gas mixture ratio of 3:97 (CH4:H2) at pressure of 150 Torr and temperature of 800 °C for 4 min. Prior to capping layer growth, the MW(N2) plasma was turned off and the chamber was evacuated to base pressure of 5×10−7 Torr. The MW(N2) plasma nitridation and the capping layer deposition were carried out using MWCVD system (4 kW, 2.45 GHz) at the Israeli Center of Advanced Diamond Technologies (ICDAT). For the XPS and HREELS analyses, PCD films were used to minimize charging effects. PCD films were deposited on p-type Si (100) substrates at conditions similar to the capping layer deposition in both HFCVD and MWCVD cases. Prior to the deposition, the Si substrates were seeded with diamond slurry for 30 min to enhance the nucleation density."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The nitride PCD samples (except the MW(N2) nitride PCD) were transferred to another chamber in situ without breaking the vacuum to investigate the surface chemical states by XPS (SPECS, Germany) using Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) radiation (full width at half maximum (FWHM) 0.7 eV) at an incident angle of 55° from the normal to the surface. The electron energy spectra were measured using a hemispherical electron analyzer operated with a pass energy of 32 eV. The thermal stability of the nitride PCD surfaces was investigated by annealing at different temperatures for 5 min followed by XPS analysis. The C(1s) and N(1s) spectra were deconvoluted using CasaXPS version 2.3.15 and prior to fitting Savitzky–Golay filtering method [36] was applied to remove the noise on the N(1s) spectra. In another experiment, the as-prepared nitride PCD samples were transferred ex situ (i.e., exposed to ambient conditions) to another UHV system to investigate the surface vibrational modes by HREELS. The HREELS (Specs, Germany) chamber is equipped with a Delta 0.5 spectrometer (VSI‐SPECS), consisting of a double monochromator and a single analyzer, housed in an UHV system with a base pressure of 1×10−9 Torr. The nitride PCD samples were in situ annealed at different temperatures and following each annealing step HREEL spectra were recorded up to 500 meV loss energies under UHV conditions at room temperature. The primary electron energy was 5.4 eV and the spectra were recorded in specular geometry at an incident angle of 55° from the normal to the surface. The FWHM of the elastically scattered electron peak was ~10–11 meV. The nitrogen and hydrogen concentration in the delta layers were measured by TOF-SIMS. In these measurements, 2 keV Cs+ ions were used for sputtering and 25 keV Bi+ ions were used for probing. CN– and H- secondary ions were recorded for analysis and the SIMS results were quantitatively calibrated using a known dose of nitrogen implanted diamond sample. Micro-Raman spectrometer (LABRAM HR, HORIBA, Jobin Yvon) equipped with 325 and 532 nm wavelength lasers was used to record the Raman spectra from different delta layers. The spectra were collected using 100× objective lens for 532 nm laser and 40× NUV objective lens was used for 325 nm laser."
4,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1 (a) - (d) show the C(1s) and N(1s) core-level XP spectra obtained from H-diamond (PCD) (spectrum-(i)) and different N-diamond surfaces (i.e., 5 keV N2 + implanted, RF(N2) damage, RF(N2) non-damage, MW(N2) and 200 eV N2 + implanted (spectra-(ii-vi)) annealed at 300 and 700 °C. It is expected that the chemical state of the nitrogen terminated surfaces at the beginning of the capping layer CVD process is similar to that obtained upon annealing to 700 °C. However, immediately thereafter the nature of the nitrided layer is expected to chemically and structurally change due to the interaction with the CVD environment. In Fig. 1(a), initially, the FWHM of C(1s) peak (positioned at ~285.0 eV) of H-diamond (spectrum (i)) was observed to be ~1.2 eV whereas it increased to ~1.3–2.5 eV for N-diamond surfaces (spectra-(ii-vi)) depending on the level of damage caused by the energetic nitrogen species and the various chemical states on the N-diamond surfaces. Similarly, in Fig. 1(d), the FWHM of the N(1s) peak (positioned at 399 eV) measured for N-diamond surfaces also varied from ~1.9 to ~4.5 eV. A comprehensive curve fitting analysis has been carried out for C(1s) and N(1s) core-level XP spectra to understand the bonding configuration of C and N on the N-diamond surfaces. For H-diamond, the C(1s) peak is deconvoluted into two component peaks: C−C, and CHx positioned at ~285.0 ± 0.2, and ~ 286.0 ± 0.2 eV, respectively. For all N-diamonds, the C(1s) peak is deconvoluted into four component peaks: C=C, C−C, C=N and C−N positioned at ~284.0 ± 0.2, ~285.0 ± 0.2, ~286.0 ± 0.2 and ~287.5 ± 0.2 eV, respectively [19,37], except for 5 keV N2 + implanted diamond where an additional peak at ~290.0 ± 0.2 eV associated with π-π* plasmon [38] is considered due to presence of low-intensity peak at the C(1s) tail upon implantation, which indicates graphitization of diamond surface by implantation. As seen from Fig. 1(a), for 300 °C annealed N-diamond surfaces, the variation in C=C content for 5 keV N2 + implanted diamond suggests a substantial damage induced to the diamond surface during the nitridation process and the damage is expected to extended into the subsurface layers considering the implantation range ~6 nm from SRIM [39]. Further annealing to 700 °C demonstrates that the induced defects/damage could not be annealed out and nitrogen desorption from highly damaged N-diamond surfaces would result in extensive graphitization. Additionally, the evolution of π-π* plasmon peak (for 5 keV N2 + implanted diamond) with respect to annealing temperature supporting the claim – extensive graphitization deeper into subsurface region. On contrary, the defects formation (C=C component) on the RF(N2) non-damage and MW(N2) N-diamond is minor and no considerable changes in C=C content and/or C(1s) peak-shape for both the annealing temperatures confirming that the damage induced to the diamond surface is negligible. For RF(N2) damaged and 200 eV N2 + implanted diamond surface, a small increase in the C=C component is observed and it evolved into a well-defined shoulder to C(1s) peak at the lower binding energy, indicating that the level of surface damage appears to be intermediate compared to aforementioned nitrided surfaces. These finding can be summarized as I(C=C)(5 keV N2 +) ≫ I(C=C)(RF(N2) damage) ~ I(C=C)(200 eV N2 +) ≫ I(C=C)(RF(N2) non-damage) > I(C=C)(MW(N2). The ratio of the C(1s) C=C XP spectral component to the C(1s) overall intensity at 300 °C were calculated for each nitridation process from Fig. 1(a) and are shown in Fig. 6 (b) and discussed in correlation with HREEL spectral components in further text below. In Fig. 1(c) and (d), the N(1s) spectra obtained from different nitrogen incorporated diamond surfaces annealed at 300 and 700 °C are shown. From these spectra, it is evident that the nitrogen bonding configuration in 5 keV N2 + implanted N-diamond is completely different from other N-diamond surfaces as it displays a broad N(1s) peak for 300 °C annealing and evolves into a doublet upon annealing to 700 °C indicating some C‧‧‧‧N chemical states are thermally stable. For 5 keV N2 + implanted N-diamond, the N(1s) peak was deconvoluted into four peaks at ~398.2 ± 0.2, ~399.5 ± 0.2, ~400.5 ± 0.2 and ~402.5 ± 0.2 eV associated with nitrile and pyridine-N[38,40], pyrrolic-N [38,41–43], graphitic-N [38,44] and quaternary-N [38,45], respectively. For the RF(N2) damage surface also a broad N(1s) peak was measured after nitridation. These results and fitting revealed that the nitrogen presence in nitrile bond configuration is relatively higher for RF(N2) damage and 5 keV N2 + implanted diamond surfaces compare to RF(N2) non-damage, 200 eV N2 + implanted and MW(N2) N-diamond surfaces. This is anticipated from higher C=C component in C(1s) for RF(N2) “damage” and 5 keV N2 + implanted diamond surfaces. This could be due to reorganization of CN bonds into graphitic-N state (which is highly stable compare to other CN bonds) during annealing, which is readily evident for 5 keV N2 + implanted diamond surface. For the other cases relatively narrower N(1s) XP peaks were measured which suggest that nitrogen bonding on these surfaces occurs predominantly in one type of nitrogen bonding configuration i.e., C−N/C=N. The N(1s) XP FWHM can be used as a measure of the degree of nitrogen bonding homogeneity: N(1s) FWHM-(5 keV N2 +)-3.9 eV > N(1 s) FWHM-(RF(N2) damage)-2.9 eV > N(1s) FWHM-(200 eV N2 +)-2.5 eV > N(1s) FWHM-(RF(N2) non-damage)-2.2 eV > N(1s) FWHM-(MW(N2)-1.9 eV. Depicted in Fig. 2 are the plots of estimated surface nitrogen concentration on 300 and 700 °C annealed nitride diamond surfaces prepared by the different nitridation processes. The highest surface nitrogen concentration of 14.1 ± 0.5 at.% (σ = 45×1014 atoms.cm−2) was achieved for 5 keV N2 +, and the lowest of 3.2 ± 0.5 at.% (σ = 9×1014 atoms.cm−2) for 200 eV N2 + implantation. The N (at.%) (left side y-scale of Fig. 2) was calculated using standard sensitivity factors and assuming an homogeneous distribution of nitrogen within the XPS sensitive volume. Considering that nitrogen is expected to be localized in the very surface region whose thickness is much smaller than the mean free paths associated with the C(1s) and N(1s) photoelectrons, these values are expected to be an underestimation of the real local concentration. σ (atoms.cm−2) (right side y-scale of Fig. 2) was calculated assuming that all nitrogen is located in the upper surface region and that the photoelectron mean free path values are much larger than the thickness of the nitrided layer. In this case, therefore, it is assumed that no attenuation to the N(1s) photoelectron signal occurs upon excitation and escape from the surface. It is expected that in these cases some underestimation occurs, particularly in the case of 5 keV N2 + implantation for which a mean N ion penetration depth of ~6 nm was estimated from SRIM [39]. Assuming a mean free path of ~12 nm for the N(1s) photo-electron a maximum underestimation of up to ~20% may occur in the calculation of σ for the 5 keV N2 + implantation. In Fig. 2, we also showed the nitrogen concentration measured upon plasma nitridation of the diamond (100) surface followed by 300 °C annealing, previously published by us [19]. It can be observed that the nitrogen concentrations measured for the diamond (100) are slightly higher than for the case of the polycrystalline surface. From our XPS studies it is concluded that nitridation by 5 keV N2 + and RF(N2) damaging conditions result in a much higher nitrogen incorporation into the near surface region as compared with RF(N2) non-damage, MW(N2) plasma exposure and 200 eV N2 + implantation processes. For the latter three processes the measured N(1s) XP peak is relatively narrow and symmetric. In the case of MW(N2) plasma termination the N(1s) FWHM decreases from 1.9 eV to 1.6 eV upon annealing to 700 °C clearly suggesting a single bonding configuration in a homogeneous environment. This is not the case for the former nitridation processes (5 keV N2 + and RF(N2) damaging) for which a very broad N(1s) XP peak was measured which evolves into a doublet peak with annealing temperature suggesting bonding of nitrogen to a defective carbon structure that relaxes into a graphitic structure [38]. These conclusions are supported by the spectral analysis of the C(1s) XP peak shape analysis. These findings reflect the structural nature of the nitrided surface and therefore the initial environment in which the N delta layer is formed. To further understand the N-diamond surfaces bonding configuration, HREEL spectra were recorded upon annealing to 300 and 700 °C. These measurements were carried out on PCD surfaces because of severe charging of single crystal diamond due to its insulating nature. It is important to note that the amount of oxygen impurities upon exposure to ambient conditions and before HREELS measurements was below 1 at.%, so the influence of ambient exposure on the chemical state of the surface is negligible. In Fig. 3, the HREEL spectrum (spectrum (a)) obtained from 600 °C annealed H-diamond surface revealed four peaks positioned at ~154, ~300, ~360 and ~450 meV that are associated with mixed diamond C−C stretching vibrations and C−H bending modes, 1st overtone of diamond optical phonon, C−H stretching mode and 2nd overtone of diamond optical phonon, respectively. The optical phonon overtones are characteristic peaks of a well-defined diamond surface; confirming that the H-diamond possesses high crystalline quality diamond surface [46,47]. The HREEL spectra of 300 °C annealed N-diamond surfaces show significant changes in comparison to H-diamond spectrum; an additional peak appeared at ~425 meV (marked in red-colored dotted circle, on spectrum (d)) and concurrently the overtone of diamond optical phonon absent/intensity decreased. The peak at ~425 meV is attributed to –NH stretching mode [21,48] and it appeared only following plasma nitridation. The 200 eV N2 + implanted diamond surface did not show any trace of ~425 meV peak (marked in red-colored dotted circle, on spectrum (f)) indicating that the nitrogen is incorporated in diamond’s subsurface region/layers and along with the presence of the 1st overtone of diamond optical phonon peak confirming the retention of diamond near surface crystallinity. On the other hand, absence of 1st overtone of diamond optical phonon peak for 5 keV N2 + implanted (spectrum (b)) and RF(N2) damage (spectrum (c)) N-diamond surfaces demonstrates the surface structural damage induced during nitridation. Furthermore, absence of ~425 meV peak, upon annealing to 700 °C, indicates that the thermal stability of –NH bond is lower than 700 °C. A detailed curve fitting has been carried out to the HREEL spectra obtained from H- and N- diamond surfaces. In spectrum (a), the ~154 meV broad peak is deconvoluted into four peaks positioned at ~120, ~135, ~154 and ~180 meV. The ~120 meV peak is associated with to rocking −CH3, wagging HC=CH modes [49,50]. The peaks at ~135 and 180 meV are attributed to C-H bending deformation and aromatic C=C stretching vibrations [38,51–53]. The peak at ~360 meV was deconvoluted into three peaks positioned at ~352, ~362 and ~385 meV, out of them, first two are due to hydrogen bonded to (111), (100) diamond facets and the third is assigned to symmetric and anti-symmetric =CHx=1,2 stretching vibrations [38,51–53]. Fitting of the ~154 meV peak in HREEL spectra obtained from N-diamond surfaces revealed two additional peaks at ~105 and ~200 meV other than the peaks described above. The one at ~105 meV is associated with twisting and rocking deformation of C−H in aromatic groups and the other at ~200 meV is assigned to N−H bending and C=N stretching modes [38,51–53]. The HREEL spectra of RF(N2) and MW(N2) plasma N-diamond surfaces show a clear shoulder to 154 meV peak at ~200 meV, which is related to N−H and C=N bonds but it is barely seen for 200 eV N2 + implanted N-diamond. This is further supporting the claim of nitrogen incorporation into diamonds’ subsurface. Considering the low energy of N2 + ion, one may speculate to observe a fair amount of nitrogen on the top-surface of diamond but the present results emphasize that this is not the case. For RF(N2) damage, it can be noticed that a higher intensity C=C (~180 meV) peak than C−C (~154 meV) and absence of diamond optical phonon overtones compare to the same for other N-diamond surfaces confirm the substantial damage induced to the diamond surface during the nitridation. From our HREELS measurements it is clear that after 5 keV N2 + implantation and exposure to RF(N2) damaging conditions, the diamond surfaces are highly damaged and thermal annealing does not result in recovery of the well-defined diamond structure, but resulted in a graphitic structure. On the other hand, the RF(N2) “non damaging”, MW (N2) plasma and 200 eV N2 + nitrogen terminated surfaces thermally relaxed into the diamond character as evidenced by the increase of the 300 meV diamond surface optical phonon overtone and decrease of the C=C vibrational mode peaks intensities with annealing temperature. These results are in complete agreement with our XPS results and spectral analysis. The presence and evolution of the 425 meV loss energy peak associated with the −NH bond for all the plasma terminated surfaces show that in all these cases nitrogen incorporation occurs on the very surfaces and background hydrogen (always present in the finite vacuum environment ~1×10-9 Torr) reacts with it. For the implantation cases (both 200 eV and 5 keV N2 +) −NH bonds are not formed as nitrogen is incorporated into the sub-surface region and therefore not exposed to the background hydrogen. The normalized intensity of the 425 meV loss peak measured at 300 °C for the different samples is shown in Fig. 6(a). The decrease in intensity of the 425 meV peak with annealing temperature is due to desorption of −NH species (probably as HCN). This is concluded considering the decrease in intensity of the N(1s) peak with temperature and temperature programmed desorption experiments previously reported [20,21]. The degree of surface recovery upon annealing to 700 °C the nitrogen terminated surfaces can be quantified by the ratio between the integral intensity of the 1st overtone of diamond C−C optical phonon measured at ~300 meV to the fundamental diamond C−C optical phonon measured at ~154 meV. The data for this analysis is derived from Fig. 3(b) and shown in Fig. 6(c). From this analysis it is clear that annealing of the MW(N2) terminated surface results in its most efficient recovery as compared to the other nitride surfaces. Fig. 4 shows the SIMS profiles measured for differently fabricated delta N layers in diamond (100) as described in the experimental section. Using proper sensitivity factors, the nitrogen and hydrogen distribution and concentrations in these samples can be calculated from the SIMS nitrogen and hydrogen profiles. It is our aim now to rationalize the properties of the delta N layers formed onto the different nitrogen terminated surfaces in terms of their nitrogen and hydrogen distribution by considering the chemical properties of the “as nitrogen terminated surfaces” described above. It is clear to us that our present approach is limited due to transient chemical interaction of the activated gas mixture with the upper surface which include etching by activated hydrogen and diffusion of hydrogen, type of C−N bond formation during the nitridation and growth of the diamond over-layer. The transition from the nitrogen-rich layer into the diamond structure is expected to be of a very complex nature. It is the nature of this transient layer that renders the most interesting optical properties of the layers and the subject of our studies. Whilst the nitrogen distribution in all these SIMS profiles is quite symmetric (except for the RF(N2) damage case), the hydrogen distribution measured for the 5 keV N2 + implanted sample displays a clear asymmetry towards the surface. Furthermore, the levels of nitrogen and hydrogen retention in the different sample varies as reflected in the full scale of the concentration (right and left scales). It is interesting to note that the hydrogen profile follows very closely the nitrogen profile on the bulk side of the distribution, while it always precedes the nitrogen distribution on its surface side. This effect is understood considering that the source of hydrogen is the over-layer CVD growth process resulting in saturation of any structural defects and bonding with the incorporated nitrogen [25]. It is expected that the higher the defect density in the layer the higher the retained hydrogen concentration. In Fig. 5, different values extracted from the SIMS profiles are graphically summarized for all samples. In Fig. 5(a), the dependence of the nitrogen maximum intensity (Nmax) and hydrogen maximum intensity (Hmax) are shown for each sample. In Fig. 5(b), the dependence of the N areal density and H areal density calculated from the SIMS data are shown. As can be seen from these figures, Nmax and Nareal (as are Hmax and Hareal) show similar dependencies. From Fig. 5(a) and (b), Nmax (and Nareal) is the highest for the implantation cases whereas is lower for the plasma cases. This effect can be rationalized considering that at the initial stages of the diamond growth by CVD some etching of the exposed surfaces is expected to occur by active hydrogen alongside with diamond growth. Now, the closest the nitrogen is to the surface (plasma nitridation cases), the highest its etching and therefore the lowest its remaining amount in the delta layers, as observed. This effect is particularly evident for the cases of 200 eV N2 + implantation for which, whilst the nitrogen concentration following 700 °C annealing is low (Fig. 2), Nmax is larger than the plasma nitrogen terminated surface cases. From Fig. 5(a) and (b), a non-monotonic relation occurs between Nmax and Hmax (and Nareal and Hareal) for the different samples. This dependence may be enhanced by plotting the ratio Hmax/Nmax (and Hareal/Nareal) for the different cases and is shown in Fig. 5(d) and (e). As can be seen from this dependence a relatively higher hydrogen retention within the delta layer occurs for the case when the incorporated nitrogen is closest to the near surface region, i.e. for the nitrogen plasma activation. Whereas when nitrogen incorporation occurs into the sub-surface region the hydrogen retention is lower. This dependence is explained considering the reactivity of nitrogen and hydrogen: the closest nitrogen is positioned to the growing surface, the highest the probability of nitrogen–hydrogen interaction and therefore the larger hydrogen concentration, as indeed observed from Fig. 5(d) and (e). A similar effect is observed from the HREEL spectra shown in Fig. 3. Upon nitridation the 425 meV peak associated with the N−H bond is observed only following plasma nitridation and it is absent from the spectra measured for the ion irradiation nitridation cases (300 °C annealing). This dependence can be seen by plotting the 425 meV peak (N−H mode) intensity, I(N − H), for the different samples, which is Fig. 6(a). In Fig. 7 (a), a plot of Hareal versus I(N − H) shows a (nearly) monotonic increase dependence between these two quantities which indicates that the hydrogen intake in the N delta layer is linearly related to the surface hydrogen intake as reflected in the I(N − H) as expected based on our qualitative analysis. From Fig. 5(d) and (e), the relative hydrogen retention for the RF(N2) “damage” and “non-damage” conditions is higher than for the MW(N2) case. This effect can be understood considering that the level of defects in the latter case is the lowest as established from both the C(1s) C=C XP spectral component and the smallest N(1s) FWHM of 1.6 eV. This is supported by the fact that the I(N-H) intensity measured for the MW(N2) terminated sample displays a lower intensity as compared to the RF(N2) cases as seen from Fig. 6(a). These findings show that hydrogen saturates dangling bonds and defects within the nitride layer. The FWHM of the N-distribution in N delta measured for the different samples is plotted in Fig. 5(f). It can be observed that the FWHM of the delta layers formed from non-damage N-diamonds are narrower in comparison to damaged N-diamonds. This effect is associated with the fact that damaging is expected to be associated with penetration depth of the active species: the higher the kinetic energy of the active species the larger the expected damage to the near surface region and increase of the N(1s) FWHM. In our XPS surface analysis, surface damage is associated with the intensity of the C(1s) C = C spectral component measured at 284.0 eV. The relative intensity of this spectral component for the different samples is plotted in Fig. 6(b). As can be seen for this figure the highest surface damage was measured after 5 keV N2 + implantation, followed by RF(N2) damage plasma nitridation and much lower for the remaining cases. In Fig. 5(f), these two surfaces display the largest N distribution FWHM, as expected. A point that requires further scrutiny is that whilst the relative N distribution FWHM value for the 5 keV sample is smaller than that measured for the RF(N2) damage plasma: (6.5 nm versus 8.5 nm); the damaged layer in the former displays a higher C(1s) C=C spectral component (33% versus 7%) (Fig. 6(b)). In Fig. 7(b) a plot of different N distribution FWHM as a function of surface damage as determined by the normalized C(1s) C=C spectral component is shown. This dependence shown a non-monotonic behavior and needs further scrutiny. It is possible that for the RF(N2) “damage” nitridation the density of defects localized on the upper surface layer and sub-surface nitrogen incorporation and diffusion towards the bulk results in this non-monotonic dependence. Further studies are necessary to clarify this dependence. From Fig. 4, the hydrogen SIMS profile is highly asymmetric for the 5 keV N2 + implantation case. It is suggested that due to the higher defect density for the 5 keV N2 + implantation, active hydrogen atoms from the growing process, in addition to some etching of non-diamond carbon, saturate defects produced within the diamond structure resulting in the higher incorporation on the growing side. This is supported by our previous studies in which we have reported that the source of hydrogen in the delta layer is the capping layer growth [25]. In the case of RF(N2) damage nitridation the hydrogen distribution is quite symmetric. However as can be seen from Fig. 4, in this case both hydrogen and nitrogen distributions are broader than those measured for the other plasma nitridation (and 200 eV N2 + implantation) cases. This can be due to the thermal induced diffusion of the incorporated nitrogen towards the bulk assisted by the higher damage level, which is concurrent to the relaxation of disorder carbon structure into nanocrystalline graphite and formation of CN bonds in graphitic configuration. This also results in the broadening of N(1s) XP peak as seen from Fig. 1. Next the areal density of the nitrogen incorporated in the near surface region as calculated from XPS (denoted by σ in Fig. 2) after annealing to 300 and 700 °C and in the N delta layer by SIMS are compared and analyzed. In Fig. 8 , the dependence of Nareal as calculated in these two cases are plotted for the different samples. A nitrogen retention ratio (NRR) is defined as the ratio between the Nareal densities as calculated from the SIMS profiles to that calculated from XPS. Then, NRR is the ratio between the nitrogen areal concentration in the delta layer to nitrogen areal concentration in the nitrogen terminated surface for a particular termination process. The NRR calculated for the different samples at the two annealing temperatures are summarized in Table 1 . The differences in NRR calculated for the same at 700 °C is always larger than the value calculated at 300 °C. This is due to the fact that some nitrogen desorption takes place from the surface as the annealing temperature increases as can be seen from Fig. 2. As vacuum annealing experiments (data summarized in Figs. 1 and 2) maybe different from those occurring during the sample heating in the CVD environment to the deposition temperature (~800 °C) we further consider the NRR value at 300 °C. Then NRR(300 °C) reflects the ratio between the nitrogen areal density in the delta layer to the nitrogen areal density on the as N-terminated surface annealed to 300 °C. From Table 1, NRR(300 °C) obtains its highest values for the ion beam terminated surfaces: 0.46 for the nitrogen terminated diamond surfaces using 200 eV N2 + ions, followed by 0.24 for the nitrogen terminated by 5 keV N2 + ions. Lower values were obtained for the plasma terminated surfaces. These results can be understood considering that nitrogen is incorporated in the sub-surface region and therefore its exposure to the active CVD environment is minimal considering the plasma cases in which nitrogen is directly exposed to the CVD conditions. The highest value obtained for the 200 eV as compared to the 5 keV case is explained considering that in the former a minor structural damage is caused to the diamond structure whereas in the latter, a much higher damage occurs as reflected in the C(1s) C=C XP spectral component (Fig. 6(b)). Then, etching of this disorder layer is expected to occur by the activated hydrogen in CVD environment resulting in reduction of the incorporated nitrogen and decrease in NRR(300 °C) from 0.46 to 0.24. For the plasma terminated surfaces the highest NRR(300 °C) value of 0.15 was obtained for the MW(N2) whereas a value of 0.05 was obtained for the RF(N2) cases. These results can be explained considering that the MW(N2) termination results in the lowest surface damage as reflected in the smallest C(1s) C=C XP spectra component intensity (Fig. 6(b)) and N(1s) XPS line FWHM (1.6 eV upon annealing to 700 °C) (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is expected that activated hydrogen at the initial stages of the overgrowth CVD process will results in the minimal etching and higher relative nitrogen retention as is the case. The NRR calculated at 700 °C, NRR(700 °C), follows similar trends (Table 1) and it can be explained using similar arguments as above. It is interesting to note from Table 1 that relatively large increase in NRR going from 300 to 700 °C occurs for the MW(N2) plasma exposed and 200 eV N2 + implanted surfaces: 0.15 → 0.34 for the former and 0.46 → 0.87 for the latter; whereas for the other cases a much more moderate increase occurs. Our understanding is that it is associated with the curing of diamond structural defects produced during the nitridation processes by annealing as reflected in the appearance of the diamond optical overtone at 300 meV loss energy measured in the HREEL spectra of these surfaces upon annealing (Fig. 3). We also show that by our N delta preparation method more than one delta layer may be formed: Fig. 9 shows a SIMS profile of a double delta layer fabricated by exposing the diamond to non-damaging RF(N2) plasma followed by growing diamond capping layer twice. SIMS measurements showed that the FWHM of N distribution in the delta layers are 3 ± 1 and 4 ± 1 nm with N concentration of 1.6 ± 0.1 ×1020 atoms.cm−3. Finally, the crystalline properties of the diamond overlayer was examined by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 10 (a) and (b) show the Raman spectra obtained from different delta layers using 532 and 325 nm wavelength lasers, respectively. In Fig. 10 (a), it can be observed that the measured Raman spectra display a diamond peak (1332 cm−1) [54] and a NV zero phonon line (NV0) [55] without any non-diamond carbon peaks (i.e., G band [54] (patterned range 1500–1580 cm−1, in Fig. 10) and D band (1350 cm−1) [54]). The results indicate that the non-diamond carbon content in the delta layer is below the detection limit. Particularly, in the case of 5 KeV N2 + implantation, it is expected to observe graphitic carbon related bands on its spectrum as this surface was shown extensive disorder after nitridation (characterized by XPS (Fig. 1) and HREELS (Fig. 3)). Even though, the Raman scattering cross-section of graphitic carbon is higher (250 times for visible light) than sp3 bonded carbon, the spectrum displays no graphitic carbon related bands compared with diamond peak intensity. The magnified spectra (spectra (ii) and (iii), in Fig. 10(a)) indicate that the graphitic carbon content in the delta layers is negligible (or below the detection limit). A high intensity NV0 peak for delta from 5 KeV implantation in comparison with other delta layers suggests that the NV0 population is significantly high, which could be due to formation of large number of defects. In Fig. 10 (b), all the measured Raman spectra display only diamond peak (1332 cm−1). This strengthens our claim: etching of disordered carbon during the capping layer growth and also confirms that the created delta layers are of high crystallinity."
5,Summary,"In summary, we have fabricated N delta layers in diamond (100) by different surface nitridation methods (i.e., low-energy N2 + implantation, RF(N2) and MW(N2) exposure) followed by growing a diamond capping layer and investigated the influence of surface chemical and structural properties of initial nitrided diamond surfaces on the nitrogen and hydrogen distribution in the N delta layers. XPS and HREELS analyses of initial nitrided diamond surfaces shows that for highly-damaged diamond annealing results in graphitization and promotes nitrogen incorporation into graphitic sites. A combined XPS, HREELS and TOF-SIMS analysis suggests that surface damage enhances the hydrogen incorporation into the N delta layer. Nitrogen retention in the delta layer depends on the crystallinity of the initial N-diamond surface and presence of the incorporated nitrogen in upper-surface versus subsurface region as the atomic hydrogen may etch some of the nitrogen on the upper-surface and disordered layer during the capping layer growth. The diamond capping layers possess high crystallinity."
