0,Introduction,"Titanium dioxide has appeared as a material of great interest these days due to its long-term stability, nontoxic nature, low cost and a wide range of applications [1–3]. However, commercially available TiO2 (P25) has limitations [4,5] such as fast recombination rate of charge carriers, low surface area, absorption mainly in the UV region, etc. To overcome such hurdles, many attempts have been made for structure and optical modifications. Recently, mesoporous TiO2 [6,7] has been evolved as an effective catalyst because the presence of pores in nanostructured type substance can enhance both physical and chemical properties. As compared to TiO2 (P25), active sites of the mesoporous TiO2 increase due to its uniform channels which results in better structural properties and higher surface area for the efficient photocatalytic activity [8–11]. Further, the noble metals (Au, Ag, Pt, etc.) deposition on the TiO2 surface has attracted the attention of the research area. The M-TiO2 (metal-TiO2) heterojunction is a key factor to enhance the photocatalytic activity and these noble metal nanoparticles (NP’s) act as photo-sensitizers in visible light [12,13]. As per mechanism, the electrons get transferred from metal NP’s to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and which are further used for reduction purpose. From the literature it is clear that Au-TiO2 catalysts are extensively studied due to dual nature of Au i.e; higher ability to sensitize visible light [14,15] and generate hot electrons with higher kinetic energy due to its low electron heat capacity value. Moreover, the amount and size of the co-catalyst loaded on a semiconductor surface can affect its catalytic activity as well as selectivity. Size of loaded metal is influenced by the number of particles deposited [16] on the semiconductor and their way of distribution over the surface. As far as Au-TiO2 is concerned, it is reported that Au particles whose size is between 2 and 5 nm are found to be more effective [17,18]. Further, the Fermi level shifts upward depending upon the size of loaded Au NP’s. It was observed to be 270 mV w.r.t. NHE when Au particles size was about 5 nm on TiO2 surface [19]. Mohr and co-workers have determined the edges of Au NP’s in Au-TiO2 composite for preferred hydrogenation of acrolein [20]. However, a decrease in activity was observed when particles size was less than 2 nm might be due to loss of metallic nature of Au [21,22]. Additionally, the potential of Au metal for selective hydrogenation of nitro groups has been also reported [23–25]. Selectively m-nitroaniline (m-NA) and m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA) product formation from 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB) reduction has high industrial impact [26]. However, there are few reports for dinitrobenzene selective reduction with TiO2 which are achieved by altering the phase of catalyst [26], bimetallic loading [27], Au loaded TiO2 in the presence of external H2 source [28], etc. But there is hardly any report for 100% selective and efficient hydrogenation of dinitrobenzene over Au loaded TiO2 in visible light by varying the co-catalyst size. In this present work, both m-NA and m-PDA were produced with 100% yield when 1,3-DNB was treated with 1 wt% and 3 wt% Au-mTiO2 respectively in the presence of visible light for 3 h. Au nanoparticles act as photo-sensitizers in visible light irradiation. This study reveals that selectivity has been affected by different weight percent loading of Au on the surface of synthesized mesoporous titanium dioxide (m-TiO2) under mild reaction conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Degussa P25-TiO2, HAuCl4·3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), titanium isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), m-nitroaniline (m-NA), m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA) and isopropanol were purchased from Loba Chemicals and used without further purification. Deionized water was obtained using an ultra filtration system (Milli-Q, Milipore) with a measured conductivity 35 Ω cm−1 at 25 °C."
3,Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) and Au-mTiO2 composites,"2.2 Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) and Au-mTiO2 composites The mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) nanoparticles were synthesized by adding titanium isopropoxide, H2O and isopropanol in 1:5:22 M ratio and volume (mL) ratio was kept at 10:3:60. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 1 h at room temperature. The obtained precipitates were aged at 80 °C and then washed with distilled water and ethanol followed by drying at 100 °C. The dried nanoparticles were calcined at 400 °C. Metal deposition on the synthesized m-TiO2 surface was carried out by homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) method [29] with a variable amount of Au content. In this particular synthesis, urea was used as the precipitating agent. The required amount of HAuCl4·3H2O aqueous solution and urea was stirred for 6 h at approximately 90 °C. While heating, pH shifts towards basic range (6.5–8.0) due to decomposition of urea into ammonia and the homogeneous mixture obtained. To this mixture, m-TiO2 (synthesized above) was added with continuous stirring. After half an hour, NaBH4 (0.1 M) was added dropwise so as to precipitate Au nanoparticles on m-TiO2 support. Then the composites were washed several times with de-ionized water and dried in an oven."
4,Characterization techniques and photocatalytic activity,"2.3 Characterization techniques and photocatalytic activity The optical absorption properties of bare and metal deposited photocatalysts were studied with diffused reflectance spectrophotometer (Avantes) using BaSO4 as a standard for reflectance. X-ray crystallographic properties were studied by Rigaku Miniflex (M/s. Rigaku Corporation, Japan) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.150 nm) radiation operating at 30 kV with diffraction angle (20–80°). The morphology and particle size were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi 7500) operating at 120 kV. The samples were prepared by dispersing in methanol using sonicator. BET surface area and porosity studied were done by Autosorb-1, Quantachrome Instruments, USA. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was used to calculate the pore-size distribution from the desorption branch of the isotherm. XPS technique was used to study the chemical composition and oxidation state of prepared Au loaded catalysts. It was done on XPS spectrometer (KRATOS Axis 165 Shimadzu, UK) through Mg Kα radiation 1252.6 eV at 75 W. Elemental mapping was carried out with Energy Dispersive Spectroscope (JEOL JSM-7600 F) operating at 30 kV. The hydrogenation reaction of 1,3-DNB was carried out in a test tube containing 3 mM of 1,3-DNB and 30 mg catalyst (bare P25, synthesized catalyst and their Au loaded composites) suspended in 5 mL aqueous isopropanol (50 vol%), purged with argon for 20 min and continuously stirred in the presence of visible source (Halogen lamp, 400–1100 nm) for 3 h. The reaction was analyzed by HPLC [Agilent 1120 Compact LC equipped with a Qualisil BDS C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm)] at λ = 254 nm with a flow rate of 1 mL/min using MeOH:H2O (70:30) as mobile phase. Products were further analyzed by Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC–MS-QP 2010 plus) equipped with RTX-5Sil-MS column (15 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Optical and structural properties,"3.1 Optical and structural properties The absorption spectra of m-TiO2 and Au loaded catalysts is shown in Fig. 1 (a), in which absorption between 360 and 370 nm range is due to TiO2. This strong peak is due to electronic transitions from 2p orbital of oxygen in its valence band to the 3d orbital of titanium in its conduction band. Further, characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band was observed around 560 nm because of Au deposition on the TiO2 surface. When second order derivative of absorbance was plotted ascribed in Fig. 1(b), a minor difference of nearly 6 nm between the peaks of 1% and 3% Au-mTiO2 was observed. This difference is might be due to size variation of Au particles deposited on TiO2 which was later on confirmed from TEM images. XRD pattern of synthesized m-TiO2 and metal loaded photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 2 , which reflects the presence of anatase phase prominently due to Bragg’s diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼25.6°, 37.8°, 48.1°, 55.1°, and 62.7° which correspond to (1 0 1), (1 1 2), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), and (2 0 4) planes respectively (JCPDS file number: 21-2172). Furthermore, after Au deposition on m-TiO2 surface, the mesoporous structure does not change. The peak intensities become weaker gradually and the diffraction peak of anatase at 25.6° become wider slightly. It might be due to the reason that Au nanoparticles suppress the crystalline nature of m-TiO2. The Au-mTiO2 photocatalysts exhibited peaks at 2θ ∼38.2°, 44.6°, 64.9°, 77.9° which are indexed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes respectively and it reveals face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice structure of Au (JCPDS file number: 04-0784). The crystallite size of Au (1 wt% and 3 wt%) was 5.88 nm and 9.19 nm respectively as calculated from the diffraction peak (1 1 1), by applying the Debye-Scherrer formula. This suggests the agglomeration of Au particles at higher metal loading, which in turn leads to the increase in particle size with the increase of Au loading. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the morphology of Au nanoparticles to be spherical and highly dispersed within the channels of mesoporous TiO2 as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 with corresponding size distribution histograms of 1% and 2% Au-mTiO2 respectively. The average size of Au particles found to be approximately 3.89 nm and 8.86 nm for Au-mTiO2 (1%) and Au-mTiO2 (3%) respectively which is in comparison to size (∼2–12 nm) obtained from XRD. The EDS spectra for all Au-mTiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. S1 which reveals that Au-mTiO2 prepared from HDP method shows the maximum loading due to proper distribution of particles."
7,Porosity and surface area study,"3.2 Porosity and surface area study The photocatalysts with higher surface area and large pore volumes, owing to increased adsorption of reactant substrates along with fast transformation of both reactants and products and increase the electron and hole pair separation thereby resulting into enhanced light harvesting which in turn improves the photocatalytic performance. Nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the photocatalysts presented in Fig. 5 (a), exhibit characteristics of type IV isotherm [30] which is the specialty of porous materials. The N2 adsorption isotherms of these photocatalysts exhibit H3–type hysteresis loops corresponding to pores with wider bodies and narrow necks [7]. It features a sharp step in the p/p0 range of 0.6–0.9 which indicates the uniformity of the pore size [31], co-relating well with narrow pore size distribution as shown in Fig. 5(b) suggesting mesoporous nature of the material. The higher adsorption value was observed at high relative pressure (p/p0) which indicates the formation of larger mesopores. Moreover, an another important information can also be concluded from the absorption isotherms that it raised up for pure m-TiO2 as compared to Au loaded samples which suggesting its higher surface area [32]. It was noted that m-TiO2 exhibited the highest surface area (182 m2 g−1), as depicted in Table 1 , it decreased to 128 m2 g−1 after 3 wt% Au loading ascribed to Au nanoparticles incorporation into the channels of m-TiO2 support thereby increasing its pore volume. It is clearly shown in Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) curve (Fig. 5(b)) that mean pore diameters of Au loaded photocatalysts increased as comapred to bare m-TiO2 (3.80 nm) sample which is due to internal pore strain after metal incorporation as described in Table 1."
8,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis,"3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis Information related to elemental composition and oxidation states in Au-mTiO2 (3%) catalyst was analyzed by XPS as described in Fig. 6 . The presented spectra show the presence of Ti2p, O1s and Au4f elements. The two characteristic peaks at 458.9 eV and 464.6 eV represents Ti (+4) oxidation state with the spin quantum state of Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 respectively. The peaks at 529.9 eV and 531.4 eV in fitted spectra of O1s are due to interactions of oxygen with and H2O respectively. Moreover, two separate peaks were observed at binding energies of 84.0 eV and 87.7 eV credited to metallic 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 spin states respectively [33] which clarifies that loaded Au nanoparticles were present in zero oxidation state."
9,"Photocatalytic hydrogenation of 1,3-Dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB)","3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogenation of 1,3-Dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB) The catalysts were tested for hydrogenation of 1,3-DNB in visible light for 3 h and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC technique. The HPLC pattern depicted peaks at different retention time with a good separation. The authentic sample of 1,3-DNB showed a single peak at tR = 6.6 min as shown in Fig. 7 (a). Similarly, the peaks for m-NA and m-PDA were found to be at the retention time of 4.5 min and 1.7 min respectively ascribed in Fig. S2 (Supporting information). When 1,3-DNB was treated with bare catalysts (P25 and m-TiO2), another peak at 1.7 min (Fig. S2) appeared along with the reactant peak which indicated the formation of m-PDA. On the other hand, the amount of reactant was subsequently decreased to produce m-NA (9.4 µmol) at tR = 4.5 min with Au-P25 (1%) under similar reaction conditions. After quantitative analysis from HPLC peaks, a comparative graph was plotted (Fig. S3), which depicted that m-TiO2 found to be 1.4 times more active than P25. The percentage yield of the substrate and corresponding amine after 3 h reaction interval in the visible source is presented in Fig. S4 which shows that 30% and 42% yield of m-PDA was achieved by bare P25 and m-TiO2 whereas nearly 63% m-NA was produced with Au-P25 (1%). Further, the product confirmation was done by GC–MS (Fig. S5) which was in co-relation with obtained HPLC results. Further, the complete photoreduction of 1,3-DNB occurred with Au (1–3%) loaded m-TiO2 composites with different products formation. The HPLC peaks (Fig. 7) shows that no peak for reactant at tR = 6.5 min was observed when the reactant was treated with these three composites after 3 h reaction. In case of Au-mTiO2 (1%) and Au-mTiO2 (3%), the whole reactant was consumed to produce single amine with a different retention time of 4.5 min and 1.7 min, thereby, producing m-NA and m-PDA respectively. It inferred that 1 wt% and 3 wt% Au deposited m-TiO2 are highly selective in nature to reduce particularly one and both NO2 groups respectively present in 1,3-DNB. However, when the substrate was treated with Au-mTiO2 (2%), a mixture of both aromatic amines was formed with a major product as m-PDA (11.3 µmol) as that of m-NA (3.2 µmol) as depicted in Fig. 8 and further analysis was carried out by GC–MS (Fig. 9 ). Additionally, the blank test reactions were also carried out both in dark along with catalyst and absence of photocatalyst in visible source under similar reaction conditions. The HPLC analysis (as shown in supporting information, Fig. S2(e, f)) determined that only one peak at retention time of 6.5 min appeared which clearly indicate the whole unreacted reactant without the formation of any product in both the cases. Therefore, to carry out hydrogenation reactions, presence of catalyst as well as light is highly required. Furthermore, the time coarse of the substrate was also studied with Au (1–3%) loaded m-TiO2 as shown in Fig. 10 . The variation in activity/selectivity was observed with all catalysts under similar reaction conditions. Firstly, the change in activity may be ascribed to different support (P25 or m-TiO2) used. Synthesized m-TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited nearly one and a half folds better efficiency as that of commercially available P25 (TiO2). This can be explained on the basis of better structural properties of m-TiO2 such as mesoporous nature, higher surface area (180 m2 g−1), etc. Moreover, anatase {0 1 1} face possessed more defects as that of rutile {1 1 0} face and these defects acted as active sites [34–36] for higher photoresponse of the catalyst. As far as selectivity is concerned, only one NO2 group reduced by Au-mTiO2 (1%) whereas both NO2 groups reduction occurred with Au-mTiO2 (2%), which reflects that amount of co-catalyst is playing a vital role. The content of metal loading was found to be in direct co-relation with the size of its particles. As the amount of loading was increased, the larger Au NP's form due to agglomeration which was facilitated by higher Au content [37,38]. Herein, the size of Au NP’s varied mostly between 3 and 4.5 nm and 8–10 nm range for 1 wt% and 3 wt% on the m-TiO2 surface as measured from respective TEM images. Thus, the number of co-catalyst particles along with their size and way of distribution over semi-conductor effects reaction selectivity. As per stoichiometry, 6e- per nitro group are required for hydrogenation of NO2 group to corresponding NH2 which clarifies that double amount of electrons are needed for m- phenylenediamine (m-PDA) production as that of m-nitroaniline (m-NA), supported by literature [39]. Thus, 12 h+ will oxidize iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) into 6 acetones and 6 H2 molecules simultaneously for m-PDA production whereas 6 h+ will oxidize IPA into 3 acetones (IPA:acetone = 1:1) and 3 H2 molecules in case of m-NA formation. Moreover, in previous study of our lab, Kaur et al. [40] have clearly determined the oxidation of IPA to acetone and hydrogen using GC-FID (gas chromatography having flame ionization detector) and GC-TCD (gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detector) techniques respectively but in this present work, the quantitative analysis was not carried out. As far as mechanism is concerned, light irradiation helps to activate the Au nanoparticles, the SPR band overlaps with the interband transitions from the filled 5d states to the empty 6s/6p states above the Fermi level and collectively oscillating electrons can induce the interband excitation to give enough energy to electrons of Au to cross the Au-TiO2 interface by overcoming the Schottky barrier [41]. This will result in electron-deficient Au NP’s and electron-rich TiO2, so that holes on the metal NPs surface that assist in the oxidation IPA [42]. The mechanism for the hydrogenation of 1,3-DNB is illucidated in Scheme 1 . Briefly, the Au particles loaded on TiO2 surface absorb incident visible light and get activated because of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) due to coupling of resonant oscillation of surface electrons, which results into hot electrons formation. When the energy of photo-generated electrons is high enough to cross the Schottky barrier [41] are subsequently transferred to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 helping NO2 group reduction to respective NH2 functionality. Further, the electron deficient and holes rich surface of Au NP’s assist the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol (hole scavenger) [42] into acetone and hydrogen or H+ ions which is further used for hydrogenation. Thus, the excitons (electrons and holes) actively participate for this redox reaction. Moreover, noble metal NPs have electron storage properties which improves charge separation and prevent direct recombination of photo-generated charged species to enhance photocatalytic efficiency."
10,Conclusion,"The present work reveals that Au loaded mesoporous TiO2 are highly selective and efficient photocatalysts. The content of Au on the TiO2 surface has controlled the selectivity of product formation. Herein, 1 wt% and 3 wt% of Au-mTiO2 resulted 1,3-DNB hydrogenation into m-NA and m-PDA respectively as final products in the presence of visible irradiation. Moreover, the reaction efficiency enhanced nearly 1.7 times with Au-mTiO2 (1%) as compared to Au-P25 (1%). Hence, efficient activity and selectivity of the reaction found to be in direct co-relation with support used and amount/size of metal loaded respectively."
