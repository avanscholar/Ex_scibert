0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas has been proposed as a new sustainable energy carrier to overcome the current global energy crisis. It can supply energy as high as 122–142 kJ/g, which is 2.75 times higher than that of common hydrocarbon fuel. Hydrogen is a clean alternative energy source due to its high energy value, and produces water instead of greenhouse gases (GHGs) when combusted [1]. The biological production of hydrogen gas using waste biomass as a substrate is one possible alternative, that while being economic it is environmentally sustainable as compared to other available industrial methods, such as coal gasification, water electrolysis, and the gas-shift reaction [2]. There are four main types of biological pathways for hydrogen production: anaerobic dark fermentation (DF), photofermentation, biophotolysis, and electrofermentation (microbial electrolysis). DF has obtained more attention since it is known to be less energy-intensive and more environmentally friendly than conventional chemical methods [3,4]. As it is estimated, by promoting and pursuing the anaerobic fermentation process in Malaysia, around ∼2135 MW of electricity could be generated, and ∼11.35 Mt of carbon dioxide emission could be avoided by the year 2020 [5]. Dealing with wastewater treatment and sustainable waste biomass management is now possible to generate green electricity via biohydrogen gas. Being the world's second largest producer and exporter of palm oil, Malaysia's palm oil industries generate a large amount of agricultural waste biomass, especially after pruning and during harvesting/processing fresh fruit bunches [6,7]. The generated biomass includes empty fruit brunch (EFB), palm kernel shell (PKS), oil palm trunk (OPT), oil palm frond (OPF), palm oil mill effluent (POME), and mesocarp fibre. Among all the oil palm biomass, OPF contributes to nearly 60% of the total biomass generated in the oil palm industries [8]. Notably, ∼49 million tonnes of OPF are produced per year [9]. The current practice to manage residual OPF is by leaving the fronds in the plantation to guarantee that nutrients are retained and conserved in the soil. The OPF is divided into basal, middle, and top parts. The basal part of the OPF petiole, which is 1/3 of its length, houses ∼66% of the total sugars in the OPF [10], while the nutrients are mostly centred at the middle and top parts of the fronds. Previous study showed that OPF juice was ideal for use as a fermentation feedstock since there was no microbial growth or product development suppressors, free of impurities, simple to operate, and there were no health or safety dangers [10]. The use of OPF juice as a renewable fermentation feedstock should be of industrial interest because OPF is readily available throughout the year, no enzymatic or chemical pre-treatment is needed, unlike lignocellulosic materials, and, most importantly, there are no inhibitors or salts that potentially affect the fermentation yield [11]. Using iron nanomaterials in environmental remediation and degradation of organic contamination are extensively known, and they are also expected to enhance the fermentation yield in the DF process. Nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) is a promising new technology that improves biogas production of waste-activated sludge by influencing hydrolysis and acidification processes [12,13]. Predominantly, iron (II) sulphate utilised in reduced ferrous ion (Fe2+) form, serves as the active site of functional proteins used for hydrogen production, such as ferredoxins and hydrogenases. Fe2+ is also helpful to motivate the expression of genes responsible for hydrogenase synthesis in the metabolic pathway [14,15]. Study reported that dosing nZVI in the dark fermentation system can enhance the hydrogen production efficiency by providing an environment that favours the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria and improving the key enzyme activity of anaerobic bacteria [16]. Therefore, it has a great potential to be applied in anaerobic dark fermentation for biohydrogen production. nZVI can help in eliminating the residual oxygen present in the system and may maintain low oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) when added to anaerobic systems, creating a more favourable environment for anaerobic hydrogen-producing metabolism [17,18]. Studies have showed that nZVI has displayed inhibition on methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion due to its reductive decomposition of cell membrane. The inhibition was accompanied by the accumulation of hydrogen gas due to rapid nZVI dissolution [19]. The major limitations of adding nZVI technology in fermentation include its toxicity towards the hydrogen-producing bacteria when it exceeds the tolerance range of the microbes, therefore possibly inhibit the fermentation process [20,21]. The key to avoid this disadvantage is by using the optimal dose of nZVI for particular test microbes. The employment of Clostridium sp for biohydrogen production is well-documented. This bacterial species can convert hexose sugar (simple sugar with six carbon atoms) to biohydrogen with a yield of 4 mol H2/mol hexose [22]. Since OPF used in this study composed of more than 50% hexose in total (Table 1 ), C. butyricum JKT37 is a good applicant for this study. Also, Clostridium butyricum is reported to be stable during biohydrogen fermentation using non-sterile waste under uncontrolled pH [23], indicating the versatility of this species for optimisation study. Although the effects of nZVI on the anaerobic degradation of sugars in synthetic culture medium were investigated previously [13], the effect of nZVI specifically on biohydrogen using OPF juice from agricultural waste biomass remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of using OPF as a substrate for the DF process and to study the impact of the initial pH, the total carbohydrate (TC) concentration, and the addition of nZVI on biohydrogen production, TC degradation, and metabolite distribution during batch-mode operation using the locally isolated single-culture biohydrogen producing bacteria Clostridium butyricum JKT37. Optimisation of these parameters, particularly on nZVI concentrations is essential to enhance biohydrogen production for commercial or industrial applications by manipulating specific fermentation parameters."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of oil palm frond (OPF) juice,"2.1 Preparation of oil palm frond (OPF) juice Freshly cut OPFs were obtained from the Oil Palm Estate owned by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, located at Bangi, Selangor. Part of the fronds (petiole), which was about 1–3 m closest to the trunk, was cut and used. A sugarcane juice presser, model SCM 6.5 HP (Elephant Brand, Malaysia), was used to squeeze and extract the juice from the raw OPF biomass. The juice was filtered with a metal sieve to remove larger particulate matter [8,24]. The OPF juice was stored at −44 °C until further use. The effect of storage temperature was studied by storing the OPF juice at different temperatures of −40 °C, −20 °C, 4 °C, 37 °C, and 60 °C to determine the optimum temperature at which the degradation (acidification) of OPF juice could be prevented. The storage study was conducted for up to 5 days, and samples were collected at 24-h intervals for sugar content analysis."
3,"Preparation of the anaerobic inoculum, fermentation medium and zero valent iron","2.2 Preparation of the anaerobic inoculum, fermentation medium and zero valent iron The bacteria were previously isolated from POME and identified as the spore-forming acidogenic C. butyricum strain, which was designated as JKT37 and used as the fermentation inoculum (gene accession number GCF_003849835.1) [25,26]. The bacterial seed was re-enriched using reinforced clostridial medium (RCM) broth. The solution was then autoclaved and dispensed into sterile 120 mL serum bottles with bacteria inoculum, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper, and clamped with an aluminium cap. The bottles were tightly clamped and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with agitation at 250 rpm. The cell turbidity (optical density, OD) of the inoculum was measured and maintained at a minimum value of 1.3 before being used in fermentation inoculation. The fermentation medium consisted of inoculum, OPF (60% v/v of 120 mL serum bottle), and stock nutrient media at 10% v/v of 80 mL working volume. The 10 × nutrient stock was composed of (per litre of distilled water) 34 g of K2HPO4, 13 g of KH2PO4, 20 g of (NH4)2SO4, 2 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.20 g of CaCl2·7H2O, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of l-Cysteine HCl, 150 g of CaCO3, 10 mL of a 5g/L resazurin solution, 20 mL of an Fe solution, and 20 mL of a trace element solution. The Fe solution consisted of 2 g/L of FeSO4·5H2O and 4 mL/L of 37% HCl. The composition of the trace solution (per litre of water) included 70 mg of ZnCl2, 100 g of MnSO4·H2O, 60 mg of H3BO3, 200 mg of CoCl2·2H2O, 20 mg of CuCl2·2H2O, 20 mg of NiCl2·6H2O, and 40 mg of NaMoO4·2H2O [25]. nZVI was prepared by mixing 1 g of FeSO4·7H2O with 1 g of NaBH4 in 50 mL of distilled water. The morphological structure of the synthesised zero-valent iron particles mixed with aliquots of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as a stabiliser were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Merlin Compact, Zeiss Pvt. Ltd., Oberkochen, Germany) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (CM 12 Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands. The stability of nZVI was measured according to diameter of diluted nanoparticles using a Malvern Zetasizer (City, UK). The size range of nZVI prepared in this study is around, 77.5±24.75 nm (diameter ∼92.63 nm Fig. 3(a)). The crystallography of synthesised nZVI was validated via x-ray diffractometry (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advanced, Bruker, Billerica MA, USA). The formed nZVI was kept tightly sealed to prevent oxidation to iron oxide."
4,Fermentation process,"2.3 Fermentation process Initial pH optimisation: The carbohydrate concentration of the OPF fermentation medium was diluted and fixed at 8 g/L before inoculation. Samples were prepared at varying initial pH values of 4.50, 5.50 (unadjusted), 6.50, 7.00, 8.00, 9.00, 10.00, and 10.50. The pH was adjusted using 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl before seed inoculation by subjecting the inoculum C. butyricum to anaerobic conditions so that the viability of the bacteria was not affected during pH adjustment. Initial total carbohydrate (TC) concentration optimisation: OPF juice was diluted with distilled water at various TC concentrations of 0 (control), 6.50, 12.80, 20.00, 35.00, and 51.00 g/L (undiluted), with the initial pH of the fermentation medium based on the results obtained from the previous optimisation step. Initial nZVI optimisation: The nZVI solution was added to the OPF medium at the following 5 different concentrations: 0 (control), 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, and 100.00 mg/L. A negative control was prepared with RCM by replacing the inoculum and with a nZVI concentration of 12.50 mg/L. Finally, the optimum value was based on the highest quantity of biohydrogen produced throughout the fermentation process. The range of parameter are determined either by single-stepwise and two-fold (decrease or increase) for pH and TC and nZVI respectively. All optimisation values set in each category were prepared in triplicate. The batch fermentation was conducted at 250 rpm and at 37 °C."
5,Kinetic model simulation of biohydrogen fermentation,"2.4 Kinetic model simulation of biohydrogen fermentation Three critical significant factors (initial pH, initial TC concentration and initial nZVI concentration) on anaerobic H2 fermentation for 120 h were examined. The kinetics data obtained from the conducted batch fermentation were used with the following modified Gompertz equation, given in Eq. (1), to simulate and fit cumulative H2 production curve [27]: Eq. (1) H ( t ) = P . e x p { − exp [ R m . e H ] ( λ − t ) + 1 } where H (mL) is the cumulative amount of H2 produced at incubation time t (h), H max (mL) is the potential maximal amount of H2 produced, R max (mL/h) is the maximal H2 production rate, and λ (h) is the lag time to exponential H2 production. SigmaPlot software 11.0 (Systat Software Inc., USA) was used to generate the time-course H2 production results which were simulated with Eq. (1), and the kinetic constants (H max, R max, and λ) were estimated using nonlinear regression."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Gas analysis: The composition of the produced biogas was analysed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, model GC-2014, Japan) equipped with a helium ionisation detector (HID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). High-purity helium (MOX 99.99%) gas was utilised as the carrier gas for gas chromatography (GC) and run at a flow rate of 25 mL/min. The initial oven temperature was set at 40 °C with a pressure of 2.7 psi. The temperature of 40 °C was maintained for 5 min, followed by a ramping of 30 °C per min until the temperature reached 220 °C, where it was held for another 10 min. The gas volumes presented here were corrected to a temperature of 25 °C and a pressure of 1 atm. All analytical steps were done in triplicate [28]. Aqueous samples: Aqueous samples were filtered through a 0.45 mm membrane before analysis. VFAs were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Agilent 1100 Series HPLC System) equipped with an ultraviolet diode array detector (DAD) equipped with a Rezex ROA Organic Acid Cazt (8%) column. The temperature of the oven was initially maintained at 60 °C for 4 min. Filtered 0.005 N H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.60 mL/min. The sugar component and alcohol was measured by HPLC (Agilent 1200 Series HPLC System) equipped with a Rezex RPM monosaccharite column with a reflective index (RI) detector at 85 °C. Filtered deionised water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.60 mL/min [29]. The total sugar concentration was determined by the phenol–sulphuric acid method with glucose used as the standard [30]. The total reducing sugar of the sample was tested using the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method [31]. Measurements of VSS and TSS were performed according to the Standard Method for Water and Wastewater [32]. The pH was measured with an AS ONE compact pH meter, BP-3001 (Trans Instruments Ltd, Singapore). The total nitrogen was measured via the alkaline persulfate oxidation method [33]. Ion chromatography (Metrohm, 882 Compact IC plus, CH) was used to analyse the concentrations of cations and anions in the OPF juice. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was performed with a PerkinElmer Analyst 800 spectrometer (USA). Monitoring: The 96 hours (every duplication of time starting with initial 6 hours) monitoring parameters during the biohydrogen production experiments were pH, biohydrogen production, TC consumption, and VFA and ethanol formation. The temperature performance was inspected under mesophilic (37 °C) conditions in an incubator shaker (Infors HT Ecotron 25, Switzerland). Sampling of liquid effluent was conducted one time per day, and the samples were kept at 4 °C prior to analysis."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Compositional analysis and OPF juice storage stability,"3.1 Compositional analysis and OPF juice storage stability It was found that the potential free soluble sugar content in the OPF petiole juice was 51.53 g/L and mainly consisted of hexose (C6H12O6). Monomeric glucose and fructose alone account for almost 45% and 9%, respectively, of the total sugars found in the OPF juice, and dimeric sucrose accounts for ∼27% of the total sugars found in the OPF juice. The detailed characteristics of the OPF juice used in this study are indicated in Table 1. Previous literature has reported that OPF petiole squeezed by a hydraulic pressing machine gives the highest sugar recovery, accounting for a recovery yield of 88%, while the recovery yield was around 92% in this work [10,11,34]. Similar to other solutions with high sugar content, OPF juice is prone to microbial contamination. Hence, a storage stability test was conducted to understand the possible spoilage due to the natural acidification of the sugary juice and was monitored via pH analysis. As this observation can serve as the basis for potential designs for OPF juice collection and storage in the future. Table 2 shows the changes in the pH of the OPF juice at different storage times and storage temperatures. It was observed that OPF juice deterioration started almost immediately for the concentrated juice (raw juice). The pH decreased slightly after the first day of storage, and it started to decelerate from the second day onwards for all samples at different temperatures. After 5 days, the sample stored at −40 °C recorded the most stable pH reading compared to the other storage temperatures tested in this study. The reduction in pH values could be explained by the total sugar loss, whereby the higher the total sugar loss, the lower the pH of the juice. This is probably due to the metabolic activity of naturally occurring microorganisms, which convert sugars to organic acids [35]. In the concentrated (raw OPF) juice, the number of viable microorganisms was much higher, and, therefore, the pH dropped drastically compared to the diluted OPF juice."
9,Effect of initial pH on biohydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of initial pH on biohydrogen production The total biohydrogen produced within 96 h of fermentation is shown in Fig. 1 (a). It was observed that the highest biohydrogen production was achieved at an initial pH of 6.50. A similar pH value was found in previous studies using different substrates, such as glucose [36,37], food and beverage processing wastewater [38], cheese whey [39], and sugar cane juice [40]. The pH value has a direct influence on the hydrogenase activity and bacterial growth rate by affecting the essential metabolic processes, such as proton translocation and substrate and biochemical product metabolism. The TC consumption was generally high for all tested initial pH values, as shown in Fig. 1(b), indicating good substrate utilisation. Although the tested samples at extreme alkaline pH values (9.00–10.50) did not result in high biohydrogen production, the TC consumption was high. This could be due to the shift in the competing metabolic pathways to produce other products, such as ethanol and lactic acid. An acidic pH (below 5.50) could also lead to a higher solventogenesis rate in comparison to the acidogenesis process rate and a distortion of the enzymatic activity of hydrogenase [36]. Solventogenesis (ethanol formation) drained more free electrons from NADH, hence leading to a drastic decrease in biohydrogen production. Additionally, extreme pH conditions (alkaline or acidic) may promote denaturation of proteins and destabilisation of DNA strands [37], hence disrupting overall microbial growth. The most biohydrogen produced at a pH of 6.50, was dominantly via the butyric pathway. Fig. 1(c) shows an increase in VFA (including acetic, butyric, and formic acids) content in all samples. Notably, after 96 h of fermentation, the pH dropped in all the samples [as shown in Fig. 1(d)] due to the accumulation of VFAs in the fermentation broth. Moreover, in the samples with an initial pH above 7.00, the medium pH dropped to around 6.50, which is the optimum pH for Clostridium sp. growth, prior to significant accumulation of biohydrogen [27]. Sivagurunathan et al. (2017) summarised the biohydrogen metabolic pathways based on the initial pH of the fermentation medium; basically, at low pH, hydrogenase activity is inhibited [41]. At pH values ranging from 4.50 to 6.50, acetate and butyrate production were favoured, while neutral or extreme alkaline pH promotes ethanol and propionate production. Furthermore, neutral pH encourages the acetate pathway, while an acidic medium promotes the butyrate pathway. Therefore, to maintain high and stable biohydrogen production in this study, the pH of the medium needed to be controlled around 6.50 ± 0.50."
10,Effect of initial TC concentration on biohydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of initial TC concentration on biohydrogen production The DF process was carried out at 6 different TC concentrations: 0, 6.50, 12.80, 20.00, 35.00, and 51.00 g/L. Fig. 2 shows the product-substrate yield, which was measured through the consumption of TC and production of biohydrogen with pH monitoring. Referring to Fig. 2(a), the production of biohydrogen was clearly affected by varying the initial TC concentration. The initial TC concentrations at 12.80 g/L yielded the highest biohydrogen production of 35.27 mL, followed by 33.37, 31.35, 31.14, and 26.50 mL of hydrogen at TC concentrations of 20.00, 35.00, 6.50, and 51.00 g/L, respectively. Higher TC concentrations, such as 35.00 and 51.00 g/L, may inhibit bacterial growth and distort metabolism. On the other hand, at low TC concentrations of 6.50 g/L, bacteria are considered to use carbon sources primarily for VFA production, without contributing to biohydrogen generation. The effect of the initial TC concentration on the fermentation process can be further explained in Fig. 2(b) and (c) since at all the studied concentrations, there was high consumption of substrate (TC) and high production of by-products (VFA). An increased production of biohydrogen gas was recorded at 6.50, 12.80, and 20.00 g/L, with TC consumption of 51.56, 74.38, and 77.07%, respectively whereby the consumption of TC remained high, 82% and 68.63% at 35.00 and 51.00 g/L, respectively, with low biohydrogen production, indicating that a large amount of the TC consumed produced other intermediate products that may not contribute to biohydrogen production, such as lactic acid and ethanol. The data in Fig. 2(c) show a significant increase trend in VFA yield at 6.50, 12.80, and 20.00 g/L; although, it is a slow increment for 12.80 g/L as compared to the others. However, the intermediate (35.00 g/L) and high (51.00 g/L) levels of the initial TC concentration showed that acetic acid and butyric acid remained unchanged within 24 h until reaching 96 h of fermentation, while there was a significant increase in the lactic acid concentration. Notably, lactic acid negatively affects the DF process since it is involved in the H2 consumption pathway. It has been reported that the hydrogen yield decreases when metabolism pathway is routed into lactic acid production [42]. The accumulation of lactic acid at intermediate and high levels of the initial TC concentration triggered a decrease in the production of biohydrogen. Therefore, most favourable biohydrogen production was at 12.80 g/L initial TC concentration."
11,Effect of nZVI concentration on biohydrogen production,"3.4 Effect of nZVI concentration on biohydrogen production The synthesised nZVI formed an agglomeration of spherical particles with chain-like clusters as shown in the micrograph images of FESEM and TEM (see Fig. 3(a)). The oxidation process of nZVI has to be inhibited by the chelating agent EDTA for the physical characterisation procedure. EDTA prevents iron oxide (FeO) or iron oxide-hydroxide (FeOOH) transformation and will retain the accumulation of nZVI, with a size consistency of 60–95 nm [43]. However, with the chain-like structure of nZVI, the distribution of the nanoparticles measured by zetasizer in Fig. 3(b) was accumulated between 95 and 1050 nm. Despite the agglomeration of the nanoparticles, the stability of nZVI was remained with low weight ratio of oxygen to Fe which was examined through energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, as shown in Fig. 3(c). EDX analysis provided the elemental status of the synthesised nZVI used in this study with the proportion of iron, oxygen, and carbon atoms were 76.80%, 16.70%, and 6.40%, respectively. In the EDX spectrum of nZVI, the highest peak due to absorption of elemental iron indicates the presence of iron nanoparticles and other peaks correspond to carbon and oxygen atoms. A similar finding was reported for plant-based nZVI [44]. In addition, XRD spectrum in Fig. 3(d) provides qualitative as well as quantitative information about elements that involved in the formation of nZVI corresponded to the (110) plane at substantial peaks at 44° [45]. The test conditions were employed with the following 5 different initial concentrations of nZVI and a control set (negative control without inoculum): 0, 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, 100.00. Upon the addition of nZVI particles from 12.50 mg/L to 100.00 mg/L, the biohydrogen production in the serum bottle batch reaction increased steadily. The volume of biohydrogen produced from each fermentation medium within the 96 h fermentation time is shown in Fig. 4 (a). The biohydrogen profiles suggest that production relatively started increasing after the first 24 h. The biohydrogen production rate is the most consistent among many biological processes. For instance, biohydrogen generation usually exhibits lag phases at around 12 h in the beginning, followed by a considerable steady increase after 24 h, and there is no fluctuation [46]. The production of biohydrogen increases uniformly with time by increasing the concentration of iron particles, which allows for reliable extrapolation of biohydrogen evolution based on the total mass or surface area of the iron nanoparticles and the reaction time [47]. However, this is exceptional with the highest nZVI of 100.00 mg/L, which shows lesser cumulative biohydrogen production than at 50.00 mg/L of nZVI. The highest concentrations of nZVI (herein 100 mg/L) produced lesser biohydrogen gas (600 mLH2/LOPF) since it is known that higher concentrations of certain additives can inhibit microorganisms and cause cell lysis because of external pressure since the bacterial cell membrane has a certain threshold capacity for certain concentration ranges of chemicals, macro- or micronutrients [48,49]. In this case, it could be attributed to that, the accumulation of FeO and FeOOH in the test medium after the oxidation of nZVI particles during anaerobic fermentation could possibly inhibit the biohydrogen production [50]. Also, study has shown that nZVI particles are less toxic to Gram positive as it possess thicker cell walls than gram negative bacteria [51], making C. butyricum JKT37, which is a Gram-positive bacterium, more resilient at the given optimised conditions. After 96 h of DF, the concentration of the nZVI at 50.00 mg/L yielded the largest amount of biohydrogen gas of 823 mLH₂/LOPF, which is around 65% higher than the negative control (without inoculum; with 12.50 mg/L nZVI) and 46% higher than the positive control sample (without nZVI, with inoculum). In the negative control, biohydrogen gas was produced, although, no bacteria were applied in the sample, indicating that an iron nanoparticle-water based approach (water lysis) for hydrogen production occurred. Due to the low standard redox potential (−0.44 V) of the Fe0/Fe2+ couple, iron can be readily oxidised by water, producing hydrogen gas [Eq. (2)] [52] and organic compounds [Eqs. (3)–(5)] [53]: Eq. (2) F e 0 + 2 H 2 O → F e 2 + + 2 O H − + H 2 Eq. (3) F e 0 + R + H + → F e 2 + + R H Eq. (4) 2 F e 2 + + 4 H + + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 2 F e 3 + + 2 H 2 O Eq. (5) 2 F e 2 + + 2 H 2 O → 2 F e 3 + + H 2 + 2 O H − According to reaction, Eq. (2), hydrogen gas is the only gaseous product; hence, relatively pure hydrogen gas can be obtained directly from this process, where 1 mol of hydrogen is generated as an equivalent mole of iron is consumed. Iron reacts steadily once in contact with water under ambient temperature, pressure, and moderate solution pH conditions. Therefore, hydrogen production via this process does not require intensive energy input nor sophisticated equipment [47], but it is not a promising waste-derived biogas that yields a renewable, sustainable, and green source of energy. Apart from that, the metabolic pathway in DF has been mainly categorised into two clusters according to the metal compositions around the test organism's hydrogen producing enzyme, namely [Fe–Fe] and [Ni–Fe]-hydrogenase. To express and exploit the action of these enzymes within the DF system, certain quantities of iron ions are required [54,55], and the productions of hydrogen by the enzyme pathway are expressed in Eqs. (3)–(5). The functional mechanisms of nZVI in hydrogen fermentation are that these metal nanoparticle iron could accelerate electron transfer between ferredoxin and hydrogenase to drive the fermentation process and biohydrogen formation [56,57]. The concentration of the by-products, the sugar consumption, and the pH change throughout the fermentation process for the five concentrations of nZVI and the negative control sample (without inoculum) are shown in Fig. 4(b), (c) and 4(d). Total TC utilisation for 50.00 mg/L of nZVI fermentation in Fig. 4(b) recorded 72.66%, which corresponds to the highest biohydrogen production. The TC utilisation for the negative control was zero since inoculum was not present for carbon consumption. The lowest carbon consumption was in the 100.00 mg/L test medium, which showed the second lowest hydrogen production. Referring to Fig. 4(c), VFAs (dominated by butyric acids) were produced in all samples. After 24 h of fermentation, the VFA profile for all samples declined then increased gradually, showing that lactic acid was consumed at the beginning, and butyrate and acetate concentrations increased after that. The highest VFA production of 6.61 g/L was found at the nZVI of 50.00 mg/L after 96 hours of operation time, which was related to the maximum biohydrogen production. The ratio of acetic acid to butyric acid was used as an indicator for biohydrogen production, and a value of 2.00 was considered suitable [49]. In this study, the ratios of acetic acid to butyric acid were 3.05, 4.98, 2.15, and 3.97 at nZVI dosages of 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, and 100.00 mg/L, respectively, which were higher than the reaction without nZVI addition, whose ratio was only 4.36. pH changes in all initial nZVI test shows that from initial 6.5 pH, fluctuation between 5 and 6 final pH can be seen in Fig. 4(d). This study coincides with previous studies suggesting that a pH 5.50 to 5.80 is the optimum for enhanced biohydrogen fermentation [49,58,59]. Interestingly, the addition of nZVI can maintain the medium's pH, which reduces the need for adding external chemicals for pH adjustment [13]. Hence, the process with nZVI addition resulted in an improved biohydrogen production rate. The overall optimisation results for the tested parameters are summarised in Table 3 , noting that at extreme acidic pH the sugar utilisation of C. butyricum JKT37 was very low (39.63%). Similarly, the control sample (0 g/L TC) for the initial TC concentration test recorded negative biohydrogen production. The initial TC concentration of 51.00 g/L records the lowest volume of hydrogen produced, 26.50 mL, whereas the highest hydrogen volume of 35.27 mL was noted at 12.80 g/L initial TC. Also, at the highest concentration of nZVI (100 mg/L), the reaction was able to produce biohydrogen one step lower then optimum 50 mg/L nZVI. The highest biohydrogen content in the evolved gases obtained from OPF juice fermentation was 65.83 mL, with sugar utilisation of 72.66% at an initial pH of 6.5, TC concentration of 12.8 g/L, and added concentration of 50 mg/L nZVI."
12,Kinetic analysis,"3.5 Kinetic analysis In this section, the following four OPF juice samples were used as the substrate for microbial fermentation by C. butyricum JKT37 under mesophilic (37 °C) conditions: (1) raw, (2) adjusted pH parameters, (3) adjusted pH and TC concentration parameters, and (4) optimum pH and TC and nZVI concentrations. The kinetic analysis of the modified Gompertz equation was done for the experiment with the optimum pH value (6.50), TC concentration (12.80 g/L), and nZVI concentration (50 mg/L) for total 120 hours. Fig. 5 shows the effect of the optimum pH TC and nZVI concentrations on the production of biohydrogen from OPF juice, which is well-fitted to the Gompertz model. The biohydrogen production rate are summarised in Table 4 . It is evident that the total biohydrogen production increased 1.85-fold with the adjustment of the three optimum parameters, as compared to the biohydrogen generated from the raw unadjusted OPF juice. The average cumulative biohydrogen production during incubation in the batch experiment was calculated, and no significant biohydrogen production was observed during the initial 6 h of incubation (lag phase). Notably, the lag phase was reduced 27-fold (which is 96% rapid reaction) from 6.86 h (raw OPF juice) to 0.25 h under optimum conditions. The longer lag time for raw OPF juice fermentation was due to the higher glucose concentration gap between the pre-cultural and growth conditions (substrate shock) [60]. The final pH and the TC utilisation rate for all fermentations were in the range of 4.81–6.5 and 53.75%–74.38%, respectively. A maximum hydrogen production (P max) of 68.40 mL was obtained for the optimised pH, TC and nZVI condition. Notably, using the Gompertz model, the correlation coefficients for all optimised conditions for OPF juice fermentation were high (R2 = 0.98–0.99), suggesting that the modified Gompertz model was able to adequately describe the biohydrogen production from the OPF juice. The maximum production rate of 1.81 mL/h was the highest under the optimal conditions. The maximum HY of 2.71 mol H2/mol sugar consumed was achieved using the optimal pH and temperature settings (t-test, p < 0.05: indicating this optimised parameter is significantly different between blank and other optimised parameters). Metabolite analysis in the biohydrogen production tests is shown in Table 4. In this study, the key co-products were butyric, lactic, and acetic acid, with a minor amount of formic acid, and the highest concentrations of the main soluble microbial products (SMPs) in the samples were lactic acid (5.95 mg/L,) followed by butyric acid (4.28 mg/L) and acetic acid (about 1.95 mg/L), with no propionic acid detected in the fermentation juice. Changes in metabolite composition can be observed after the addition of nZVI, whilst the content of lactic acid remained the same. An increase in the concentration of acetic and butyric acid can be observed. This indicates that hydrogen production was enhanced through the HBu and HAc fermentation pathway, supporting the finding of Taherdanak et al. (2016) that the enhancement in hydrogen yield by Fe0 nanoparticles could be attributed to the activation of HBu production. The productivity of biohydrogen can be verified by the ratio of HAc to HBu; the higher the HAc/HBu ratio, the better the hydrogen production [27,61]. A HAc to HBu ratio in the range of 0.11–0.92 was identified for the optimum pH, TC and nZVI, and raw OPF (blank), respectively. The VFAs to SMP ratio was essentially higher than 0.23 in this study. The abundance of VFAs in the total SMP suggests that biohydrogen production was metabolically favourable as the acidogenic pathway was predominant over solventogenesis [62]. Biohydrogen production in acidogenesis comes mainly from oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvic acid to acetyl CoA and is also linked to the conversion of acetyl CoA to butyrate and ethanol, together with acetate production [63]. Conversely, due to microbial metabolic pathways, part of the carbon source is converted to ethanol. The lowest ethanol concentration of 7.87 mg/L was detected at optimum condition showing that the pathway were diverted more towards acid fermentation phase rather than solvent fermentation phase. Thus, the resulting biohydrogen production performance was compromised due to a production of ethanol. The results in this study demonstrated that OPF juice could potentially be used as a substrate for biohydrogen production. The results obtained in this study are comparable with previous studies conducted on biohydrogen production using OPF juice and other stalk juices in terms of biohydrogen production yield [2], as listed in Table 5 . Some possible reasons for the variation in the reported data may be that hydrogen production occurs during the acidification stage of the metabolic process and the hydrogen-producing bacteria have a high conversion rate of carbohydrate to hydrogen. Then, the high concentrations of metabolites may cause the pH to drop to low levels [64]. Also, studies have been conducted in the literature using various lignocellulosic biomasses for biohydrogen production under mesophilic conditions, as listed in Table 5 and the results obtained in this study is comparable with previous studies. For example, in study by Yasin et al. (2013), the HY obtained was 67-fold higher than that from OPF using Escherichia coli BW25113, but a 1-fold lesser yield was obtained using sugar beet juice [65]. This was probably because of the role of the anaerobic mixed culture used in the fermentation process, where it can survive the environmental changes and maintain the reaction. Complex lignocellulosic wastes yielded lower biohydrogen production because of their recalcitrant nature with lower readily accessible fermentable sugar, such as POME [3] and sweet sorghum juice [66]. Fig. 6 summarises material balance of the overall results obtained from the fermentation of OPF juiceat the optimum biohydrogen production under the optimised process conditions of an initial pH of 6.50 and initial TC and nZVI concentrations of 12.80 g/L and 50.00 mg/L, respectively. The final yield of biohydrogen reflects the effectiveness of the process, starting from pressing OPF and diluting OPF juice to the optimum sugar concentration. Changing the initial pH of the medium to 6.50 enhanced the biohydrogen production by C. butyricum JKT37, noting that 250 mL of OPF juice was obtained from pressing 1 kg of OPF. Hence, the results of this study show that utilisation of OPF, a sugar-rich source, in the production of high-value added products, such as biohydrogen, may lead the way to profit maximisation in the future."
13,Conclusions,"This study was an initial step in the examination of the suitability of this underutilised palm tree material, OPF juice, as feed stock for biohydrogen production. The current study has successfully shown that sugar-rich OPF juice can be potentially used as feedstock for biohydrogen production by locally isolated C. butyricum JKT37. It can be concluded that at pH 6.5 with 12.8 g/L total sugar, which is equivalent to a 25% dilution of OPF juice, the optimum condition for biohydrogen production can be achieved. The addition of nZVI significantly enhanced biohydrogen production by creating a more favourable environment for the anaerobic microbes and worked as a buffer agent to prevent pH drops. The highest hydrogen yield obtained in this work using frond juice was 2.71 mol H2/mol substrates consumed, which is 45% higher than raw OPF juice (control). The optimisation of various physico-chemical parameters and nZVI characteristics for biohydrogen production using agricultural waste in continuous mode still need to be studied further in future work."
