0,Introduction,"With nearly 4300 billion tons accounting for 20% of global coal reserves, lignite is an important and abundant source of energy, in particular in countries that heavily rely on coal to supply the ever-growing energy demand [1,2]. For instance, 52% of primary energy in Turkey, nearly 50% in Greece [3], and about 90% of energy in the state of Victoria, Australia [4] are supplied by combusting lignite (brown coal). With over 16.6 billion tons of proven lignite reserves in China, there exists a great potential for using lignite as a strategic source of energy, especially considering that nearly 70% of primary energy in China comes from coal [5–8]. Hence, with the depletion of higher rank coals, the demand for lower-rank coals such as lignite is continuously increasing. Low mining cost, high reactivity, and high volatile matter content of lignite render it very attractive as a primary source of energy, which possesses a great potential in the global energy sector [2,9–11]. However, disadvantages such as high CO2 and air pollutant formation per unit of energy, low calorific values, and high moisture contents make the combustion-based lignite conversion technologies very challenging [12,13]. Therefore, clean, efficient and environmentally friendly technologies need to be developed to increase the efficiency and sustainability of lignite utilization by converting lignite to more valuable products. Pyrolysis is an important process in the thermal conversion of coal and has been recognized as an efficient method for converting lignite to value-added products such as chemical raw materials, fuel gas, and energy-dense char [14–16]. The generation of several products during pyrolysis allows the development of pyrolysis-based poly-generation systems for efficient lignite utilization [17,18]. Extensive research has focused on understanding the mechanism of lignite pyrolysis for conversion to liquid fuels and high-value products [7,19–22]. Recent literature data on large-scale lignite pyrolysis are limited. A large body of work has focused on upgrading and tar formation from lignite via low to medium temperature pyrolysis. Early developed technologies such as Lurgi [23], Toscoal process [24], COED [25], Garrett process [26], etc. were focused on fuel production from lignite but generally reported formation of heavy components in pyrolysis tar, which caused significant operational issues [27]. Wang et al. [28] developed a lignite solid heat carrier pyrolysis process, a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system, which aimed at generating high yields of light tar fraction as well as gaseous products via flash pyrolysis. They reported an optimum reaction temperature of 660 °C, at which the light tar fraction mainly contained acid groups, crude gasoline, and aromatics. The major challenge in pyrolysis-based lignite conversion technologies has been to control the selectivity of the target products, especially when the generation of high-quality gas and chemical raw materials is of interest. Although the oil derived from lignite is attracting increasing attention as a source of value-added products, this has been overlooked due to the overwhelmed attention on the use of lignite in energy generation via combustion and gasification. Furthermore, the composition of lignite pyrolysis oil and gas is very complex, which makes them unstable and very difficult to separate and purify. A large body of work has focused on upgrading the pyrolysis volatiles of lignite by using appropriate catalyst [29,30], introducing external gases such as H2 to the reaction (hydropyrolysis) [20], and solvent thermal treatment [31]. For instance, Yang et al. [32] used supported solid acid catalyst for crack the macromolecular volatile compounds into light aromatics during the secondary cracking reactions. Reaction parameters have been reported to greatly impact the pyrolysis behavior of lignite [17,21,33]. Li et al. [17] observed that unlike higher rank coals, the mass loss during the pyrolysis of lignite in a drop tube furnace was more sensitive to the reaction temperature (600−1000 °C). Higher pyrolysis temperatures led to a drastic increase in H2 and CO formation, which was accompanied by greater aromatization of char structure. Zeng and Fletcher [33] reported an overall decrease in the yield of volatiles from coals of different ranks at elevated pressures. Li et al. [34] reported similar results for pyrolysis of Chinese lignite in a fixed-bed reactor at 1 min residence time. However, they observed that at residence times of longer than 5 min, higher pressures led to an increased rate of secondary cracking reactions and the decomposition of large organic species, forming light gases at the expense of char. Wang et al. [20] studied the thermal decomposition of lignite in a pressurized thermogravimetric analyzer at 0.1–2.0 MPa and reported slight differences in the TG profiles with pressure where a shift in the position of DTG curve to lower temperatures was observed. Using a wire-mesh reactor, Kershaw et al. [35] observed that the formation of large aromatic ring systems was enhanced during the pyrolysis of Victorian brown coal at a heating rate of 1000 K/s. This was attributed to the limited breakdown of alkyl substitutes to light gases as well as hindered cross-linking of aromatic rings to form char at high heating rates. Most of the lignite pyrolysis studies have reported the impact of temperature and the presence of external catalysts on the yield of products. Studies on the influence of pressure suffer from low heating rates which differ significantly from large-scale industrial reactors. To scale up the pyrolysis systems, reliable information is required under conditions that are relevant to commercial large-scale reactors. Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite is a promising method to increase the selectivity of value-added products under single-particle heating mode and fast heating rates similar to that of industrial reactors. In this context, the overall objective of this study was to test the pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite as an alternative method of utilization to the current combustion and gasification routs. The major goal was to gain a better understanding of the impact of pressure and temperature on the pyrolysis behavior of lignite and the mechanism of reaction pathways by conducting systematic and continuous pyrolysis tests in an entrained-flow reactor. The pyrolysis products obtained under different experimental conditions were characterized in detail to determine the reaction mechanisms and the impact of process conditions on the yield and composition of pyrolysis products to evaluate the selectivity of H2 gas and chemical raw materials. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the development of an efficient method to convert lignite to value-added products."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Coal sample preparation,"2.1 Coal sample preparation Hailar lignite sample from the Inner Mongolia region of China was crushed to a particle size fraction of 125−300 μm, followed by drying at 80 °C for 12 h to eliminate the inherent moisture. The samples were then stored in air-tight containers in a desiccator to prevent moisture reabsorption. The ASTM E872 and ASTM E1755 standard methods were followed to measure the volatile matter and the ash contents of the lignite sample, respectively. The elemental composition of the sample was measured using a Euro Vector Euro EA elemental analyzer. The properties of the lignite sample are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis experiments,"2.2 Pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis experiments A pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis facility (Fig. 1 ) was used in this study. The pyrolysis setup included a gas supply system with MFCs and pressure regulators, as well as a vertical stainless steel reactor with an inner diameter of 14 mm heated in a split furnace. The furnace included five 300 mm heating zones, totaling 1500 mm. In this study, the pyrolysis tests were conducted in a temperature range of 600−900 °C with 100 °C intervals and pressures of 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 MPa. The temperature at different heating zones of the reactor was calibrated as a function of the temperature of the furnace. The difference between the reactor and furnace temperatures was found to be ±11 °C. High-purity nitrogen (>99.999%) was used as the sweeping gas during the pyrolysis experiments. The nitrogen flow rate was adjusted between 1.0–6.4 L/min. The N2 gas was split into two streams. One stream was preheated to 350 °C before entering the reactor, while the second stream was passed through the hopper and screw feeder to prevent the contact between the lignite particles and the hot gas from the reactor. The whole system was purged with nitrogen for one hour prior to each experimental run, while the outlet gas was analyzed by an online Tesco 350 gas analyzer. Prior to the experiments, the temperature of the gas at the reactor outlet was measured. It was observed that the reactor outlet temperature showed similar values to the wall temperature. With increasing system pressure, about 20 °C decrease in the temperature the gas was recorded, which was attributed to the lower thermal conductivity of nitrogen at higher pressures. A pressure control system with a back pressure valve and exhaust system was used to control the pressure of the system. Once the desired reactor temperature and pressure were reached, about 30 g of sample was fed to the reactor through a screw feeder at a slow rate of 0.5 g/min to achieve a single particle heating condition and a dilute gas phase in the reactor. The experimental runs were carried out for 1 h. The overall particle heating rates were in the range of 1700−5900 K/s. The flow rate of N2 in the reactor was controlled to achieve a gas residence time of 5−6 s and a relatively stable particle residence time of around 4 s, which was calculated based on the particle slip velocity and the heated length of the reactor [21,36]. The method proposed by Haider and Levenspiel [36] was applied to calculate the stationary particle velocity. The acceleration due to gravity directly influenced the drag coefficient in the vertical pyrolysis reactor. The flow rate of N2 and the cross-section area of the reactor were used to obtain the superficial gas velocity. The slip velocity of coal particles was calculated from the sum of the stationary particle velocity and the superficial gas velocity. The pyrolysis gas was passed through a char collector and a condensation system at the bottom of the reactor to capture the char particles and the liquid fraction, respectively. The condensers were cooled by a circulating mixture of water and ethylene glycol at −5 °C. The char collector was trace-heated to 250 °C to prevent the condensation of volatile matter in this section. The exhaust gas containing non-condensable pyrolysis gases was passed through a particle filter before being sampled at 10 min intervals in 30 L gas bags. In general, the gas composition remained relatively constant during the experimental runs. The gas analysis results were averaged and reported here. The liquid fraction was collected by using dichloromethane for further analysis. The experimental runs were repeated twice to ensure the reproducibility of the results and the average values are reported here."
4,The yield of pyrolysis products,"2.3 The yield of pyrolysis products The yield of volatile matter during the pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite was obtained using the ash tracer method (Eq. (1)) [37]: (1) V M = 1 - X 0 X 1 - X 0 where VM represents the Volatile Matter Yield in % (daf), X and X0 are the ash content in the char from pyrolysis and the raw lignite, respectively. The yield of liquid fraction was calculated by direct weighing of the sample collected from the condensers. The yield of the light gas fraction was obtained by difference."
5,Characterization of lignite pyrolysis products,"2.4 Characterization of lignite pyrolysis products The compositions of non-condensable gaseous species including H2, O2, N2, CO, CO2, and C1-C4 were measured by a 490 Micro-GC, Agilent Technologies with a thermal conductivity detector. The Micro-GC was equipped with a 10 m (Molecule sieve) MS5A column and a 10 m (Polar Plot U) PPU column. Helium and argon were used as carrier gases. The temperatures of 85 °C and 120 °C and pressures of 150 and 120 kPa were used in MS and PPU columns, while the injection temperature was set at 60 °C and 75 °C, respectively. Prior to the gas measurements, the micro-GC was calibrated with standard gas mixture. The composition of liquid fraction obtained from the condensers was analyzed using a Thermo Scientific ISQ gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) equipped with a capillary column and an electron impact (70 eV) quadruple analyzer. Dichloromethane was used as the solvent in GC-MS sample preparation. The temperature of the GC oven was raised from 40 °C to 100 °C at 10 °C/min, followed by ramping to 280 °C at 15 °C/min. The holding time of the volatiles at 280 °C was 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas during the GC–MS measurements. The chemical compounds in the liquid fraction were identified by comparing with the instrument database. The GC–MS data allowed a semi-quantitatively comparison of the composition of pyrolysis liquids. The elemental composition of the liquid and char fractions were measured using a Euro Vector Euro EA CHNS/O analyzer. The changes in the chemical structure of chars were investigated using an attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) (Thermo Fisher Nicolet IS5 mid-FTIR spectrometer). The char particles obtained from the char collector were directly examined without pretreatment. The IR spectra of samples were obtained in a wavelength range of 4000−400 cm−1 at a scan rate of 64 scans per spectrum. Band assignment was made by following the previously published literature [38]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,The yields of pyrolysis products,"3.1 The yields of pyrolysis products The changes in the mass loss (total yield of volatile matter) during the entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite are shown in Fig. 2 . As expected, the mass loss corresponding to the combined yields of liquid and gaseous fractions increased at higher temperatures due to the promotion of primary decomposition reactions. However, a general decrease in the total yield of volatile matter at elevated pressures was observed, in particular at pressures of above 1.0 MPa. The lower yields of volatile matter at elevated pressures may be attributed to the vapor-liquid equilibrium and the hindering effect of pressure on the release of large tar molecules from the char structure [33,39–41]. Heavier tar molecules exhibited lower vapor pressures and tended to be retained in the char at elevated reactor pressures, while the light gaseous species, owing to their higher vapor pressure, were released from the particle even at 4.0 MPa. Li et al. [34] postulated that higher pressures may cause two competing phenomena in the char. One is the inhibiting effect of pressure on the release of volatile matter and the second is the promotion of secondary decomposition reactions at a longer residence time of volatile matter in the char. Under the entrained-flow heating conditions and owing to the short volatile residence time of about 5−6 s in the reactor, the inhibiting effect of pressure was greater than the secondary decomposition of volatiles, leading to an increased overall char yield. Table 2 shows the yield of pyrolysis products of lignite under different reaction conditions. The reaction temperature and pressure were found to greatly influence the distribution of pyrolysis products. An increase in the char yield was observed at elevated pressures which was attributed to the restrained release of large tar molecules. As expected, higher temperatures enhanced the thermal decomposition of lignite, leading to lower char yields. Higher temperatures accelerated the release rate of the volatile matter, resulting in a shorter residence time inside the particles, which in turn decreased the chance of condensation and secondary polymerization reactions [34]. It can be seen in Table 2 that unlike pyrolysis pressure, higher temperatures led to higher yields of light gas. The decrease in light gas formation at high pressures may be attributed to a longer residence time of volatile matter in the char particles, which increased the chance of secondary condensation and polymerization reactions, leading to higher char and tar yields [39]. The yield of liquid fraction generally decreased at elevated pressures, however, some inconsistencies were observed. This observation may also be related to the increased residence time and a higher chance of tar retention in the char structure. The highest yield of tar was obtained at 900 °C and 2.0 MPa."
8,The effect of pyrolysis conditions on the composition of light gas,"3.2 The effect of pyrolysis conditions on the composition of light gas Fig. 3 shows the composition of pyrolysis gas derived from entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite as a function of pressure and temperature, as analyzed by using a micro-GC. The identified gases included CO2, H2, CO, CH4, and C2H6. The results showed that both pyrolysis temperature and pressure had a profound impact on the yield of gaseous species. The major components of pyrolysis gas at 600 °C and 700 °C and under atmospheric pressure were H2, CO2, and CH4. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 800 °C and 900 °C greatly influenced the composition of the pyrolysis gas by promoting the formation of H2. The concentration of H2 increased from 32.49 vol% to 85.63 vol% when the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 600 °C to 900 °C. Reichel et al. [21] also reported that H2 was the most abundant component in the pyrolysis gas obtained during pressurized pyrolysis of brown coal at temperatures of higher than 800 °C. Pyrolysis pressure had a major influence on the composition of light gas fraction, promoting the formation of H2 at the expense of CO2, and CH4. For instance, at 700 °C raising the reaction pressure from 0.1 MPa to 4.0 MPa led to an increase in H2 concentration from 51.91 vol% to 74.34 vol%. The highest H2 concentration of 91.69 vol% was achieved at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. The promotion of H2 formation was accompanied by a significant decrease in the concentrations of CO2, CO, and CH4 at elevated pressures. The yield of H2 per unit mass of lignite was calculated and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . The results showed that the yield of H2 (calculated at STP) increased from about 0.02 m3/kg coal at 600 °C and 0.1 MPa (equivalent to 2.25 g H2/kg coal) to 0.27 m3/kg coal at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa (equivalent to 24.32 g H2/kg coal), implying that elevated pyrolysis pressures and temperatures greatly influenced the yield of H2. The heating value of the H2-rich gas ranged between 12.05 MJ/Nm3 and 15.09 MJ/Nm3, indicating the great potential for the production of high-value gas from lignite under pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis conditions. The detailed investigation of gas composition as a function of pyrolysis conditions in Fig. 3 shows that the impact of temperature was stronger at lower pressures. Similar results were reported by Reichel et al. [21] and Peralta et al. [40]. However, the findings of this study were contrary to those of Seebauer et al. [42] and Porada et al. [43] who reported lower H2 yields at higher pressures, which can be attributed to lower heating rates achieved in their experiments. The pyrolysis temperature also played a governing role in the formation of H2 as it promoted the aromatization and radical polycondensation reactions [44,45]. Higher temperatures also promoted the dehydrogenation of aromatic structures and condensation of the aromatic nuclei into coal char, leading to the release of molecular hydrogen [46]. Hydrogen may also be generated due to the depolymerization of phenyl groups [47]. The formation of H2 under the pressurized entrained-flow conditions can be explained by the longer residence time of volatiles in char at elevated pressures, which promoted the secondary pyrolysis reactions. During the secondary reactions, the released aliphatic cyclohexene during the thermal decomposition of lignite underwent aromatization reactions, losing hydrogen to form a stable benzene ring and hydrogen molecule [17]. Aromatization reactions involve the addition of butylene radical to a benzene ring, leading to the formation of H2 [17]. Furthermore, the formation of hydrogen gas at elevated pressures can be explained by the promotion of the Hydrogen Abstraction-Acetylene Addition (HACA) reactions, which release hydrogen radicals during the aromatic ring growth, thereby increasing the chance of hydrogen gas formation [39]. The PAHs formation involves partial cracking of aromatic rings and dehydrogenation of primary radicals, which generate a large number of hydrogen radicals during the secondary pyrolysis reactions [48,49]. The decrease in the concentration of CH4 at elevated pressures (Fig. 3) was due to its thermal decomposition to form hydrogen [50]. The steam reforming of methane in the presence of water generated during pyrolysis may also enhance the formation of hydrogen gas [51]. The decrease in the concentration of CO2 in pyrolysis gas at elevated pressures and temperatures can be attributed to the enhanced water gas shift and methane reforming reactions [52]. The combination of these results indicated that the pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite is a promising method to achieve selective production of H2-rich pyrolysis gas. Higher hydrogen concentrations in the pyrolysis gas may to some extent resolve the costly and complicated gas purification requirements. H2-rich gas is extremely attractive as a high quality and clean fuel for power generation via hydrogen fuel cells or as the raw material for the production of fertilizers, petroleum refining, etc."
9,The effects of pyrolysis conditions on the compositions of tar,"3.3 The effects of pyrolysis conditions on the compositions of tar Fig. 5 shows the changes in the composition of pyrolysis tar as studied by GCMS. The compounds detected in lignite tar were grouped into aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons (single-ring), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenols, other oxygenated compounds, and others. The major chemical compounds identified in the liquid fraction are listed in Table A.1, Appendix A. Fig. 5 shows that the liquid phases derived from the pyrolysis tests at atmospheric pressure and temperatures of 600 °C and 700 °C were mainly composed of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, and phenols, while some other oxygen-containing species such as alcohols were also detected. The results also showed a significant increase in the concentration of PAHs such as naphthalene and derivatives, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene at elevated pressures and temperatures, which was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of single-ring compounds such as benzene, styrene, and phenols. These results suggested that increasing the pyrolysis pressure and temperature during the entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite led to the formation of PAHs at the expense of monocyclic compounds and aliphatic hydrocarbons. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 6 which compares the gas chromatograms of lignite pyrolysis tar at 600 °C and 0.1 MPa with that of the tar derived from 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. The highest PAHs concentration of 90.4 area% in lignite tar was obtained at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. The formation of monocyclic aromatics, phenols, and PAHs (mostly naphthalene at atmospheric pressure) during the thermal decomposition of lignite can be explained by considering the macromolecular structure of lignite, which is known to be mainly composed of one- and two-ring aromatic rings connected by methylene and ethylene bridge bonds [53]. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 800 °C and 900 °C under atmospheric pressure led to lower concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phenols, while the relative concentration of PAHs was increased (Fig. 5). The concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons at 600 °C in the pyrolysis liquid was 10.55 area%, while they were not detected at 800 °C and 900 °C. Phenolic compounds decreased from about 20.2 area% at 600 °C to 2.51 area% at 900 °C. Meanwhile, the concentration of PAHs more than doubled from 31.76 area% at 600 °C to 67.69 area% at 900 °C. The formation of PAHs is known to be enhanced at higher temperatures [54]. In particular, higher heating rates are known to promote the formation of larger aromatic ring systems [35]. The increased heating rates at higher temperatures hinder the thermal cracking of alkyls substituents to light gaseous species, while also limiting the cross-linking of large aromatic systems to form char [35]. The combination of these effects leads to the release of aromatic structures in pyrolysis tar. Another interesting observation during the pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite was the promotion of the generation of PAHs at elevated pressures, which was consistent at all the temperatures studied. The enhanced formation of PAHs at elevated pressures can be explained by the prolonged residence time of volatiles in the char particle, which was believed to have increased the possibility of secondary Diels-Alder and Hydrogen Abstraction-Acetylene Addition (HACA) reactions [39]. Radical such as benzene anion, phenyl, and naphthalene anion which are formed during the decomposition of lignite (Table A.1, Appendix A) can act as precursors for PAHs [55]. Two reaction pathways have been generally accepted in the HACA mechanism. One is the formation of benzenoid-PAHs such as phenanthrene and pyrene, while the other is the generation of cyclopenta-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP-PAHs) such as fluoranthene [56]. These reactions may initiate from a single aromatic radical or from naphthalene radical. Table A.1, Appendix A shows that both benzenoid-PAHs and CP-PAHs were formed during the pressurized pyrolysis of lignite, suggesting that HACA reactions progressed through both pathways. At elevated pressures, the thermal cracking of monocyclic units in lignite macromolecular structure led to the formation of phenyl and naphthalene radicals, which could further grow to form PAHs with 2–5 rings through the HACA mechanism [7,48,55,56]. Alternatively, the first aromatic ring may have formed from the aliphatic radicals in lignite tar [57]. The changes in cumulative GC–MS peak area% of single-ring aromatics and PAHs with 2, 3, and 4 aromatic rings in relation to the pyrolysis conditions are shown in Fig. 7 . The concentration of single-ring compounds (mainly aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols) decreased monotonically with pressure and temperature. This was accompanied by a drastic increase in the generation of 3- and 4-ring PAHs at elevated pressures. At 600 °C, single- and 2-ring compounds dominated the liquid fraction. The highest cumulative concentration of single-ring compounds (38.36 area%) was obtained at 600 °C and atmospheric pressure, which decreased to the lowest value of 4.79 area% at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. At 700 °C and 800 °C, the pyrolysis tar was mainly comprised of 2- and 3-ring compounds. The cumulative concentrations of 2-ring PAHs reached 47.57 area% at 800 °C and 2.0 MPa, while the highest concentration of 3-ring PAHs (48.09 area%) was obtained at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. The identified PAHs in lignite tar are important sources of chemical raw materials which may find wide applications in medicines, polymers, plastics, dyes, and pesticides industries [55]. The unique aromaticity of PAHs has motivated scientists for the synthesis of graphite materials with various sizes and properties [58]. PAHs also exhibit unique electronic and optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates in photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and field-effect transistors (FETs) [59,60]. Additionally, nanotubes and nanowires with well-defined nanostructures may be produced by self-assembly of PAHs [61–63]. The increased selectivity of PAHs in pyrolysis tar during pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite may pave the way for the efficient conversion of these low-grade fuels to value-added chemical raw materials, which may decrease the complexity of tar separation and purification."
10,The effects of pyrolysis conditions on the composition and structure of char,"3.4 The effects of pyrolysis conditions on the composition and structure of char Fig. A.1, Appendix A shows the IR spectra of chars prepared at 800 °C as a function of pressure. Major changes took place in the band regions corresponding to the hydrogen-containing functional groups, in particular in 3600-3000 cm−1 (−OH), 3000−2800 cm−1(aliphatic CH), 1320−1420 cm−1 (alkanes), and 660−900 cm−1 (aromatic CH) regions. Similar results were obtained for chars pyrolyzed at other temperatures (results not shown here). The concentration of OH-associated hydrogen functionalities including the free OH, OH-π hydrogen, self-associated OH, tightly bound cyclic OH tetramers, and OH-ether O hydrogen groups decreased with pyrolysis pressure, suggesting that phenolic groups and cyclic OH tetramers were decomposed [64–66]. Owing to the formation of weak hydrogen bonds, the self-associated OH groups feature lower barriers and may break at higher pyrolysis intensities. Fig. A.1 also shows that elevated pressures promoted the elimination of the aliphatic C–H structures to form methylene and methyl radicals. These radicals, in particular, methyl may contribute to the growth of PAHs [67]. Shukla et al. [56] reported that phenyl addition/cyclization (PAC) is an effective method in the formation of PAHs. Methyl radicals are produced significantly during the thermal decomposition of lignite and are generally regarded as precursors for the formation of methane gas by hydrogen stabilization. However, the gas analysis results obtained in this study (Fig. 3) showed that the formation of methane was suppressed under the pressurized entrained-flow conditions. Thus, it may be postulated that instead of conversion to methane, the methyl radicals participated in the PAC mechanism and contributed to the growth of PAHs. The intense peak in the 1320−1420 cm−1 region corresponded to the linear straight-chain alkanes as well as branched alkanes, which were decomposed at elevated pressures. The bands observed in the 660−900 cm−1region of the IR spectra were assigned to the out-of-plane CH deformation structures. The bands near 695, 750, 791, and 876 cm−1 corresponded to the aromatic structures with five, four, three, and one hydrogen atoms per ring, respectively [64,68]. Fig. A.1 shows that the concentration of aromatic CH structures degreased steadily with pyrolysis pressure to the point where they were almost completely decomposed at 4.0 MPa, implying an increase in the degree of aromatic substitution at elevated pressures. The elemental composition and heating values of lignite chars generated under pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis conditions are shown in Table A.2, Appendix A. Compared to raw lignite, the carbon content of chars increased significantly after pyrolysis, in particular above 700 °C, which in turn led to higher heating value by approximately 30%, from 20.89 MJ/Kg to an average of 29.55 MJ/Kg after pyrolysis. Lignite char with higher heating value may be used as a valuable fuel with a higher energy density, which can be fired individually or co-combusted with higher rank coals for electricity generation [18,69–71]. Guo et al. [18] proposed a lignite-based poly-generation technology, where the char generated during the pyrolysis process was combusted in a circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boiler, achieving 42.51% efficiency. Ni and co-workers [72] tested a staged poly-generation system, combining coal pyrolysis and char firing in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB), and observed stable combustion of char in the boiler. They estimated that the combination of char combustion and utilization of the fuel gas may lead to an increase of 6.4% in average power plant efficiency and over 50% reduction in SOx and NOx emissions. To better understand the changes in the composition of pyrolysis products, the carbon distribution (carbon balance) was calculated from the yield and elemental analysis of char and pyrolysis liquid. The carbon content of non-condensable gas fraction was calculated by difference and correlated with the gas composition results. The changes in carbon balance as a function of pyrolysis temperature and pressure are illustrated in Fig. 8 . As expected, due to higher amount of devolatilization, the retention of carbon in char decreased with pyrolysis temperature at ambient pressure. An opposite trend was observed as a function of pressures, where carbon retention in char increased at elevated pressures. For instance, at 800 °C the carbon retention in char increased from 51.9 wt% at 0.1 MPa to 67.38 wt.% at 4.0 MPa. This observation can be related to the hindered devolatilization process, leading to higher residence time of volatiles in the char, thus promoting the re-polymerization reactions and re-incorporation of carbon into char structure [40]. Matsuoka et al. [41] also reported that longer volatile residence time at higher pressures may lead to higher amount of carbon deposition. Therefore, the decrease in the yield of carbon-containing gaseous species such as CO and CO2 can be attributed to the retention of carbon in char and lower amount of carbon released to the volatile matter. Higher temperatures promoted the relative transfer of carbon to liquid fraction, which was attributed to the promotion of condensation and HACA reaction, leading to aromatic ring growth and generation of PAHs. It can be seen in Table A.2, Appendix A that the hydrogen content of the chars decreased at elevated temperatures and pressures. Fig. 9 shows that the H/C atomic ratio of char was generally decreased with increasing pyrolysis pressure. The H/C ratio decreased nearly fivefold from 0.074 in raw lignite to about 0.015 in the char obtained at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. These results are consistent with the abovementioned trends in the compositions of gas and tar, where a monotonic increase in the formation of hydrogen gas with pressures and temperatures was observed. To better understand the fate of hydrogen during the pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of lignite, the hydrogen mass distribution was calculated as a function of process variables from the elemental composition of char and pyrolysis liquid and the results are shown in Fig. 10 . The results showed that the changes in hydrogen content of lignite char under different pyrolysis conditions were relatively negligible. However, a significant reduction in the hydrogen content of pyrolysis tar was evident at higher pyrolysis pressures. This was accompanied by hydrogen transfer to the light gas fraction in the form of H2. These results indicated that the changes in hydrogen distribution at elevated pressures took place during the secondary pyrolysis reactions, the chances of which were increased due to the prolonged residence time of volatiles in the char particle."
11,Implications of potential applications,"3.5 Implications of potential applications Based on the findings of this study, a technological process was proposed for the simultaneous and highly selective conversion of lignite to value-added products (Fig. 11 ). The proposed process involves entrained-flow pyrolysis for converting lignite to hydrogen-rich gas, oil rich in chemical raw materials, and char with a high heating value. Hydrogen can be used for clean power generation via hydrogen fuel cells, production of fertilizers, and petroleum refining, among others. The PAHs species in lignite tar can be used as the source materials in chemical and materials industries after appropriate separation and purification [55,60]. High selectivity and concentration of PAHs in lignite tar derived from pressurized pyrolysis of lignite may significantly reduce the cost and complexity of the separation process. Finally, the char with high heating value can be fired in boilers or fed to gasifiers for efficient and lower emission power generation [69,73]. Power generation technologies based on lignite char may overcome the shortcomings of low energy density and high water content of lignite by improving the efficiency of conversion while reducing the net CO2 emissions [69]. Part of the energy generated by char conversion may be used to supply the energy required by the pyrolysis unit. The proposed system allows efficient and clean utilization of lignite for simultaneous generation of high value-added products using a pressurized pyrolysis system."
12,Conclusions,"(1) The total yield of volatile matter increased drastically with pyrolysis temperature. The pyrolysis pressure showed an indirect correlation with the yield of volatile matter, which was attributed to the hindering effect of pressure on the release of large tar molecules with low vapor pressure. Higher pyrolysis pressures increased the residence time of volatiles in the char particles during pyrolysis, thereby promoted the secondary pyrolysis reactions. (2) The concentration of hydrogen in the light gas fraction was found to increase with temperature and pressure at the expense of CO2, CH4, and CO. Pyrolysis gas with H2 concentration of as high as 91.69 vol% was formed at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa, which was equivalent to an H2 yield of 0.27 m3/kg coal. (3) The selectivity of PAHs such as naphthalene, biphenylene, fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and fluoranthene in tar increased significantly at elevated temperatures and pressures, reaching 90.4 area% at 900 °C and 4.0 MPa. The single- and two-ring aromatic radicals formed during the thermal decomposition of lignite were believed to initiate the aromatic ring growth mechanism to form larger molecular weight PAHs such as pyrene and fluoranthene. (4) The analysis of changes in the distribution of hydrogen in pyrolysis products showed that pressure mainly influenced the secondary pyrolysis reactions by promoting the hydrogen transfer to the light gas fraction in the form of H2. (5) Different from atmospheric pressure, pyrolysis at elevated pressures showed great potential for poly-generation of H2, pyrolysis oil rich in PAHs, and porous char with a high heating value. Based on the findings of this study is new approach was proposed for efficient conversion of lignite to value-added products via pressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis."
