0,Introduction,"Industrialization and modernization ought to increase the demand for resources from the environment and in return emits greenhouse gases (GHGs) in various ways. Continuously raising awareness of GHG emissions and its impact on global warming has compelled the governments to restrain the GHG pollution and emissions from every source. Moreover, the depletion of fossil fuel resources and GHG emissions have forced to produce biofuels/renewable fuels. In most cases, VFAs are solely produced from petroleum, regardless of the scarcity of fossil fuels resources (Zacharof and Lovitt, 2014). Production of it from the petrochemical industry adds to GHG emissions (e.g., acetic acid production contributes around 3.3 tons of CO2 equivalent/ton from cradle-to-grave (Atasoy et al., 2018). It is considered that the production and utilization of biofuels/renewable energy is one of the most efficient routes to achieve sustainable development (Atadashi et al., 2012). Considerable research has been conducted on utilizing renewable biomass to produce materials, fuels, and chemicals (Tilman et al., 2009). Among various processes to produce biofuels and building blocks of the chemical industry, the major focus has been laid on anaerobic digestion (AD) of biomass/organic substrate to produce VFAs and methane (CH4) (Pilli et al., 2015). Trend of publications associated with the “VFA production by anaerobic digestion” from 1980 to 2021 is presented in (Fig. 1 ) which clearly depict the research and development in this sector, Scopus−Document search results (Accessed May 12, 2021). VFAs are heavily involved in the organic carbon cycling on the planet (Myrto-Panagiota Zacharof and Lovitt, 2013a, 2013b), and the organic carbon recovered in the form of VFAs are the sustainable source and building blocks for the chemical industry (Andersen et al., 2015; Myrto-Panagiota Zacharof and Lovitt, 2013a, 2013b). It has different applications in the chemical industry, tanning industry, food-beverage industry, and pharma-cosmetic industry (Zacharof and Lovitt, 2013a, 2013b, 2014) and are currently of global economic interest (Baumann and Westermann, 2016). The recovery of VFAs from various effluent streams has been an area of research interest (Lee et al., 2014; Myrto-Panagiota Zacharof and Lovitt, 2013a, 2013b). The pilot-scale production from sewage sludge was studied by Longo et al., 2015. The recent research area of interest was to use VFAs for microbial lipid accumulation (Park et al., 2014) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production (Fradinho et al., 2014; Kedia et al., 2014). Its separation from synthetic solutions and leachate of the landfill was investigated (Tugtas, 2014). During the last two decades, the research mainly focused on producing the VFA's from the various biomasses (under different operating parameters) and the extraction of it from the fermented broth. As a result, the scattered literature is gathered in this review article for the readers' benefit and to establish a sustainable approach. This review focuses on the microbial pathway for VFAs production via anaerobic digestion (AD), feedstocks for synthesis, parameters influencing production, quantification, separation methods, and the application of VFAs in the production of various consumer items."
1,Volatile fatty acids (VFAs),"VFAs are also low molecular weight organic acids with a strong hydrophilic character (Siedlecka et al., 2008). It occurs in many environmental compartments, including air, water, and soil. These are the building blocks of many living organisms as they can be excreted by microorganisms, higher plants, and animals and play an essential role in their metabolisms. VFAs are essential as an energy and carbon source for the microorganisms involved in the metabolism of organic carbon cycling on earth (Parawira et al., 2004). It is one of the main compounds responsible for the foul odour in the environment and the primary energy source for ruminants, providing approximately 80% of their maintenance energy requirements (Aluwong et al., 2010). Its boiling points range from 117 °C (for acetic acid) to 239 °C (for caprylic acid). Their solubility in water decreases with an increase in the carbon chain (or carbon atoms per molecule), i.e., acetic acid is fully miscible; butyric acid is miscible, and caprylic acid has a solubility of 0.7 g dm−3 in water. The density of VFAs also decreases with an increase in carbon atoms per molecule. Commonly, these acids are produced through chemical routes and can be distilled at atmospheric pressure (Lee et al., 2014). The fully miscible compounds are quite mobile; at high environmental concentrations, they increase the mobility of heavy metals and radionuclides, proving to be more harmful to the environment."
2,VFAs feedstocks and production,"Several sources have been used as feedstock for VFA production. Based on the source, the feedstocks are divided into different categories, as given in Table 1 . During selecting sources for its production, sustainable and renewable feedstocks that are less competitive with food sources are the primary choices (Fig. 2 ). There are varieties of cheap and abundantly available biomass waste and residues, serving as sustainable and renewable feedstocks for VFAs production (Baumann and Westermann, 2016). Thus, it offers the flexibility of feedstock choice. Under anaerobic conditions, it can be produced from sludge (Bajpai, 2017), various wastewaters, various biodegradable organic wastes, biodiesel residues, lignocellulose feedstock and residues from the diary industries (Park et al., 2014)."
3,VFAs production from sludge anaerobic digestion,"3.1 VFAs production from sludge anaerobic digestion During AD, mainly six biochemical steps are involved in the conversion of organic substrate to H2, CH4, CO2, and H2O, that is, 1) hydrolysis, 2) fermentation of amino acids and sugars, 3) anaerobic β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, 4) anaerobic oxidation of intermediate metabolites, 5) conversion of acetate to H2 and CH4, and 6) conversion of CO2 + H2 to CH4 and CO2 (Bajpai, 2017). Steps 1) to 4) correspond to VFAs’ production. Sludge is an inevitable organic waste produced during wastewater treatment (Pilli et al., 2020). Apart from various microorganisms, sludge also contains approximately 10% (w/w) carbohydrates, 50% protein, 10% lipid, and 30% others, including ribonucleic acid (RNA) and fibre (Albert and Martens, 1997). In recent years, sludge components (carbohydrates, protein, lipid, and RNA) have been successfully converted to biodiesel, biogas, bioplastic, bio-surfactants, bio-flocculants, bio pesticides, ethanol, etc. (Jhariya et al., 2021; Tyagi et al., 2009). Fermentation of waste activated sludge at alkaline pH 9 and the addition of saponin enhanced the VFAs production by 4.7 times compared to the raw sludge (Huang et al., 2016). At pH 10 with no addition of saponin, its production was 1.5 times higher than the raw sludge. It was concluded that the addition of saponin under alkaline conditions (pH 10) will enhance the production of VFAs due to the solubilization and hydrolysis of the organic matter and enhanced hydrolytic enzyme activity (Huang et al., 2016). At pH 7 and 10, the accumulated VFAs were 1.9 kg m−3 and 2.99 kg m−3, respectively. Yang et al. (2015) isolated a new strain of Citrobacter freundii from wastewater sludge, which exhibited a 1.7 times higher production rate of VFAs than the sludge-only test in a mixed culture anaerobic system. In another study, primary sludge (PS) and secondary sludge (SS) were used for the production of VFAs; the highest short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in PS and SS was 352 ± 7 and 324 ± 13 mg COD g−1 of VSS, respectively at pH 10 (Zhang et al., 2015). When sludge is fermented under alkaline conditions for the generation of SCFAs, the preferred conditions are in the following order: thermophilic pH 8 > mesophilic pH 9 > ambient pH 10 > uncontrolled ambient pH (Zhang et al., 2010). Pretreated sludge at pH 12 was investigated for VFAs production in a continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at HRT 8 h and temperature 35 °C; the CSTR achieved a maximum yield of 365 mg VFAs g−1 of VSS with acetate and propionate being the primary metabolites (Yang et al., 2014)."
4,VFAs from different wastewaters,"3.2 VFAs from different wastewaters Wastewater has been used as a substrate for the production of VFAs (Reyhanitash et al., 2016). Acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids are commonly produced during anaerobic acidogenesis of dairy wastewater (Demirel and Yenigun, 2004). It was observed that acid production increased with a decrease in hydraulic retention time (HRT) and was proportional to the organic loading of the dairy wastewater. HRT affected the acid-forming microbial consortia, VFAs production, and distribution (Demirel and Yenigun, 2004; Pandey et al., 2017). The predominant acid observed was acetic acid (63%), followed by butyric acid (22%) and propionic acid (12%) at an HRT of 45 h (fermentation) when the system was operated at pH 5.9. The concentration of VFAs in the fermented wastewater is very low, which is a limitation for commercialization. The concentration of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate is around 2.5–10 g L−1 in fermented wastewater, which is less when compared to a fermentation broth purposely made for VFA recovery (Reyhanitash et al., 2016)."
5,Organic waste/source segregated organic waste,"3.3 Organic waste/source segregated organic waste Organic wastes are rich in organic matter with a high total COD content, making them promise raw materials for VFA production. Acidogenesis and acetogenesis are two of the six steps in AD, and VFAs are important by-products from these stages. With acidogenic fermentation, organic fraction of the municipal solid waste can be used satisfactorily for the production of VFA (del Mar Ossa-Arias and González-Martínez, 2021). Some early studies have already showcased converting organic solid waste to VFA (D'Addario et al., 1993). Various studies have been conducted to determine the VFA production potential by different types of organic wastes such as fruit wastes, vegetable wastes, tea waste, food waste, market wastes, etc. S. J. Lim et al. (2008a, 2008b) reported that the AD of food waste had a maximum VFA production at 35 °C with an HRT of 8 d and pH 6. Different fermentation pathways can carry out VFA production from organic waste. Some of the significant fermentation pathways are acetate-ethanol type, propionate-type, butyrate-type, mixed-acid type, lactate-type and homo-acetogenic metabolic pathway and reactions presented in (Fig. 3 (a, b)) (Zhou et al., 2018)."
6,Biodiesel residues,"3.4 Biodiesel residues Biomass residues post the production of biodiesel is a decent feedstock to produce VFAs. These residues have the potential to improve the renewability of the biomass as well as reduce the net cost and environmental impact. VFA production from biodiesel residues is highly influenced by retention time, temperature, and the fermentation pathway (Ehimen et al., 2011). Considerable research has been done on the VFA yield of oil mill effluents and other biodiesel residues through different pathways. AD of biomass residues is the technique most adopted for VFA production. Studies have indicated that 18%–32% more VFA can be extracted from biodiesel residues when using AD (Beccari et al., 2009). AD of post-trans-esterified microalgae residues left-over from the biodiesel production process digested with glycerol was used for methane production (Ehimen et al., 2011). Studies revealed that a stable pH range of 6.6–7.32 should be maintained for optimum VFA production in an anaerobic digester (Ehimen et al., 2011). The digester loading rate was also an essential parameter, with lower digester loading rates favouring higher VFA yields (Thiru et al., 2011). Centrifugation pre-treatment biomass residue has yielded a significantly higher final VFA concentration (Dionisi et al., 2005). The alternative anaerobic-aerobic process was also used for VFA production from olive oil mill effluent; this system could be adopted with a considerable volume of biomass (Beccari et al., 2009)."
7,Lignocellulose feedstock,"3.5 Lignocellulose feedstock Lignocellulose is a plant-based dry matter or biomass; rice straw and husk, bagasse, wheat straw, etc., are examples of lignocellulosic agricultural waste materials, which are now abundantly available inexpensive (Singh et al., 2021). Field burning of agricultural waste adds up to the global warming problems. Bioconversion of these feedstocks for VFA and methane production is a valuable bioproduct recovery. Lignocellulosic feedstock-based VFA production and the available pathway for VFA production were illustrated by Baumann and Westermann (2016). There are primarily two approaches for converting lignocellulosic biomass into VFAs: the sugar route for carbohydrate extraction and the syngas route for VFA generation from lignocellulosic feedstock (Aluwong et al., 2010; Baumann and Westermann, 2016). Agricultural residues give a higher VFA yield than woody biomass and yard wastes (Brown et al., 2012). Advancement of the process for the enhanced production of VFAs was tested on Napier grass, an energy crop (Sawatdeenarunat et al., 2017), by using micro-oxygenation and cattle manure as inoculum in the anaerobic digester. The study concluded a quadratic correlation between micro-oxygenation concentration and VFA production from lignocellulosic feedstock (Sawatdeenarunat et al., 2017)."
8,Residues from the diary industries,"3.6 Residues from the diary industries The dairy industry is wet, and the waste is a big challenge to treatment operators because handling and disposal account for high operating costs (Elginoz et al., 2020). High organic content loading of dairy industry wastewater is a good source for VFA production. Dairy waste exhibited an excellent capacity of VFAs production when examined at an organic loading rate of 1–5 kg COD m−3d−1 and at different retention times from 24 h to 6 h (Demirel and Yenigun, 2004). VFA production increased proportionally with the organic loading rate. It was also observed that the total VFA production was optimum at 12 h retention time with no pH control (Demirel and Yenigun, 2004). Higher organic loadings and shorter retention time provide the optimum conditions for the acid-forming bacteria (Ghosh et al., 1985). VFA production was enhanced when dairy waste was fermented at controlled pH and high loading rates in a bioreactor. Low-temperature thermo-chemical pre-treatment of dairy sludge can also increase the VFA yield (Uma Rani et al., 2012). During higher loading and with continuous flow reactors, VFA production depends on the feedstock. Hence, it gets essential to maintain dairy sludge characteristics constantly, and the health of the reactor should be monitored."
9,Other sources,"3.7 Other sources A large volume of waste is generated due to different activities and processes to better life quality. Varieties of other VFA feedstocks are available. Proper waste management is essential to minimize environmental degradation and to have a sustainable society. Studies have been done on different types of feedstocks for the production of VFAs, for example, from paper mill wastewater (Sharma et al., 2021; Vaez and Zilouei, 2020), timber industry waste (Ben et al., 2011; Mato et al., 2010) to pharmaceutical wastewaters (Oktem et al., 2006). Sugar industry wastewaters are rich in organic content and can produce VFAs with acidogenic anaerobic reactors (Alkaya and Demirer, 2011). Each feedstock's characteristics need to be analysed for optimum operational conditions to recover maximum VFA sustainably. The production of VFA during AD is influenced by substrate hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and inhibitors in the process (originated from the original waste). The VFA production can be enhanced by improving the hydrolysis rate of initial organic matter (with pre-treatment), promoting acidogenesis, and eliminating the inhibitors (Zhou et al., 2018). Optimizing several factors such as pH, temperature, pre-treatment, etc., generally enhances the rate of hydrolysis, which is the rate-limiting step of AD. Several physicochemical and biological factors also influence the Acidogenesis process. Generally, the accumulation of VFA acts as an inhibitor since it can permeate to the cell membrane and could lower the activities of microorganisms, leading to the shift of metabolic pathways (Pind et al., 2003)."
10,Parameters affecting the VFA production,
11,Physical parameters,"4.1 Physical parameters This section summarizes the previous studies on the factors affecting VFA production, including bioreactor type, temperature, headspace gas pressure, hydraulic retention time (HRT), solids retention time (SRT), organic loading rate (OLR), and redox potential. 4.1.1 Type of bioreactor The attached growth and suspended growth processes are the most used modes for VFA production. Both processes are selective, and therefore different types of bioreactors are preferred for anaerobic growth processes. A fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) is thought to be efficient over a packed-bed reactor (PBR) since the earlier one eliminates the clogging problems due to the growth of biomass over the media (Grady et al., 2011). The CSTR is another promising arrangement that offers complete and nearly uniform mixing of waste with the biomass (Conti et al., 2019). Recently, some bioreactors have been designed and employed to attain promising results in terms of production of VFAs at their optimized conditions, such as fibrous-bed bioreactor (Bhatia and Yang, 2017), up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor (Verma et al., 2016), two-stage thermophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (Wijekoon et al., 2011), anaerobic leach bed reactors (Cysneiros et al., 2012), continuous flow fermentation reactors (Luo et al., 2014), packed-bed biofilm column reactor (Scoma et al., 2016). Mode of operation is one of the most critical parameters, which determines the efficiency of different bioreactors. It has been suggested that UASB, packed- and fluidized-bed reactors should be operated in batch or semi-continuous mode for a superior yield of VFAs (Lee et al., 2014). 4.1.2 Temperature Temperature plays a significant role during VFAs production because of its involvement during the hydrolysis and acidogenesis step. Temperature affects microbial growth, and different microbial species respond differently at different temperatures. The temperature immensely affects the working of fermentative bacteria and the hydrolysis process (Jiang et al., 2013). The bacterial species involved in hydrolysis and fermentation possess an excellent potential to adopt the temperature variation within the range of 10–60 °C. Still, the higher temperature is more conducive for solubilization of organics, enhanced hydrolysis, and fermentation (Ho, 2014). Most researchers reported that the mesophilic temperature (20–40 °C) is an optimum and favourable condition for the cost-effective production of VFA (Zhou et al., 2018). The influence of thermophilic conditions on VFA generation is unclear, as numerous researchers have reported contradictory results. One study reported that thermophilic conditions enhanced the production of VFA to ten folds compared to mesophilic conditions considering no pH alteration (Hao and Wang, 2015). P. Zhang et al. (2009) suggested higher VFA production due to the enhanced solubility of carbohydrates and proteins, leading to increased hydrolysis at thermophilic conditions. In contrast, another study reported a considerable decrease in VFA production from 17 g L−1 to 11 g L−1 by altering the operating temperature from 35 °C to 55 °C without changing the pH (He et al., 2012). It could be due to the higher solubilization of organics at increased temperature but the reduction in the rate of acidogenesis (Jiang et al., 2013). The influence of different temperatures on VFA composition revealed that at 35 °C and 45 °C, acetate and propionate were the most prevalent VFAs, respectively, whereas butyrate was a substantial product at 55 °C (Jiang et al., 2013). Another study also reported similar findings where the VFA production was higher at 55 °C (thermophilic) as compared to the other experimental temperatures such as 35 °C (mesophilic) and 70 °C (hyper-thermophilic) (He et al., 2012). Therefore, it may be clearly understood that the mesophilic to thermophilic temperature range positively affects organics' microbial growth and solubilization. In contrast, the mesophilic temperature is optimum for achieving the enhanced VFA yields. Moreover, a distinctive category of VFA can be produced at a specific temperature. Moreover, different types of microbial species with different waste materials act differently at altered temperatures. Therefore, it becomes mandatory to identify the optimal temperature condition for such species. It may also be noted that many acidogenic bacteria cannot tolerate the extreme temperature range (Shin et al., 2004; Strazzera et al., 2018). 4.1.3 Headspace gas pressure (HSGP) Researchers demonstrated that the fermentation process depends significantly on the partial headspace pressure. The accumulation of H2 changes the flow of electrons involved in different metabolic cycles and affects VFA production (Yuan et al., 2019). Reduction of headspace pressure favours the homoacidogens to effectively utilize H2 and CO2, leading to the enhanced acetic acid production and reduced energy loss (Yin et al., 2014). Some examples of homoacidogens Acetobacterium sp. (27–30 °C), Acetobacterium Woodii (mesophilic), Acetoanaerobium (mesophilic), Acetitomaculum (38 °C), Acetogenium (66 °C), Acetohalobium (38–40 °C), Acetonema (30 °C), Peptostreptococcus (35–42 °C), Acetoanaerobium, C. thermoautotrophicum (55–60 °C), Eubacterium and Butyribacterium (30–37 °C) with effective temperature (Saady, 2013). Thus, the lower head pressure of H2 is more conducive for accelerating the hydrolysis of complex organics, resulting in improved VFA production (Chen et al., 2017). Specific strategies have been recommended to minimize the headspace H2 pressure, such as integrating a homoacetogenic reactor for transforming H2 and CO2 to acetate, leading to the reuse of H2 and utilizing H2 produced in the acidogenic reactor maintaining effective acidogenesis (Yin et al., 2014). Homoacetogenesis : Δ G 0 ´ ( k J ) : − 140 . 0 4H2 + 2CO2 ➙ CH3COOH + 2H2O 4.1.4 Hydraulic retention time HRT is a measure of the average duration for which a soluble compound remains in the reactor. HRT determines the flow rate being treated daily in the reactor in the context of reactor operation. HRT should ideally be long enough to sufficiently solubilize the organics, improving acidogenic fermentation of the solubilized substrate, and maybe a rate-limiting operation parameter. However, a too high value of HRT may result in the offsetting of the reactor by reducing the rate of acidogenic fermentation, leading to the accumulation of VFA. In a conducted experiment with 5 d HRT, the resultant VFA output was 250 mg acetic acid equivalent per 100 mL batch reactor for the specified HRT and a starting pH of 10. The yield of VFA generated was 26 ± 8% acetic acid, 44 ± 7% lactic acid, 4 ± 1% butyric acid, 19 ± 3% propionic acid, and 7 ± 4% other acids (Elginoz et al., 2020). A study on the acidogenic fermentation of food waste (S. J. Lim et al., 2008a, 2008b) demonstrated that VFA production increased with the HRT from 96 h to 192 h, while there was no further improvement even after increasing HRT up to 288 h. A short HRT may also affect the production due to the risk of washout of slow-growing microorganisms; therefore, selection of dominating microbial species is recommended by regulating the HRT (Zhou et al., 2018). (S. J. Lim et al., 2008a, 2008b) also investigated the change in the relative distribution of VFAs with HRT. They reported acetic acid and propionic acid as the main fermentation products at shorter and higher HRTs. Numerous other researchers reported the effect of HRT on the production of specific VFAs such as propionic acid and butyric acid under acidogenic fermentation of whey (Yang et al., 2014). Researchers have recommended HRT as one of the most significant parameters to balance the VFA distribution against the total concentration produced during fermentation. However, no significant change in VFA composition was reported during the co-fermentation of waste activated sludge and fruit/vegetable waste at an HRT ranging from 1 to 4 d (Dinsdale et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2018). 4.1.5 Solid retention time Solids retention time (SRT) refers to the length of time biomass remains in the reactor. In sludge utilization for VFA production in a CSTR without biomass recycle, SRT becomes equal to HRT because both the substrate and biomass are present in the same phase (Lee et al., 2014). Short SRTs are beneficial for efficient VFA production from sludge (Xiong et al., 2012). Since the growth rate of methanogens is lower as compared to acidogens, short SRT does not permit sufficient time for methanogens to utilize the VFA produced for further conversion into CH4 and CO2 (Lee et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014). However, SRT should be kept sufficiently long to accomplish effective hydrolysis. The effect of SRT on the composition of VFA produced has also been investigated. A study reported that the percentage of acetic acid increased from 40.6% to 59.5%, respectively, at SRT 4 d to SRT 20 d, whereas propionic acid production declined from 49.4% to 23.0% (Luo et al., 2014). The observed results may be attributed to the fact that the acidogens converted the propionic acid to acetic acid at longer SRTs. A contradictory finding was reported by (Yuan et al., 2009) investigating the fermentation of waste activated sludge (WAS) for VFA production. Researchers reported that the proportion of propionic acid remained constant at 16–18%, with an increase in SRT from 5 d to 10 d, whereas acetic acid decreased from 66 to 49%. 4.1.6 Organic loading rate Organic loading rate (OLR) determines substrate availability for the fermentation; higher OLR ensures the increasing availability of substrate, which may be advantageous for VFA production. However, at higher loading rates, the medium in the reactor becomes highly viscous, which results in an unstable process (S.-J. Lim et al., 2008a, 2008b). Several studies demonstrated that VFA production increases with an increase in the OLR up to a particular value and then decreases gradually. There exists an optimum OLR at which VFA production is maximum (Tang et al., 2016). The gradual decline in the VFA production may be attributed to the reduction in the hydrolysis rate beyond an optimum OLR. The influence of OLR on the proportion of VFA is also well documented, where the low OLR was favourable for the production of propionic acid and butyric acid while a higher OLR resulted in the increased production of acetic acid and valeric acid (Jiang et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2016). 4.1.7 Redox potential Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) is the indicator of the redox potential of the fermentation system, generally represented by the oxygen content present in the system (Yin et al., 2016b). ORP also represents the net output of intracellular metabolic activity based on the electron transfer and redox balance (Liu et al., 2013). Studies related to the effect of ORP on VFA production are very terse. An ORP range between −200 and −300 mV for the completely anaerobic condition has been suggested (Grady et al., 2011). Also, the optimum ORP for methanogenesis was reported around −230 mV (Sung and Duangmanee, 2010). Little aeration maintains the ORP in the range of −100 mV and −250 mV to make it suitable for acidogenic fermentation of food waste in the leach bed reactor (Xu et al., 2014). Yin et al. (2016a) demonstrated that ORP in the range of −100 to −200 mV favours VFA production by altering the microbial diversity in the reactor."
12,Chemical parameters,"4.2 Chemical parameters The primary chemical parameters that influence VFA production are pH and the C/N ratio. 4.2.1 pH pH is considered one of the essential parameters for controlling VFA production during acidogenic fermentation. It affects microbial activity since most enzymes are sensitive to the extreme pH environment (X. Liu et al., 2012). During fermentation, pH influences hydrolysis and acidogenesis; therefore, optimal pH for VFA production should be favourable to both processes. Methanogens are most active at pH 7.0, while acidogens can be efficiently grown at pH 5.5–6.5. Therefore, pH maintenance towards an acidic range can inhibit the activity of methanogens, leading to the accumulation of VFA (Leung and Wang, 2016; Liu et al., 2018). The transport of undissociated acids across the cell membranes is regulated by pH. Permeation of undissociated acids across the cell membranes requires more energy at acidic conditions, whereas energy is gained at alkaline conditions (Rodríguez et al., 2006; Temudo et al., 2007). The type of substrate determines the composition of VFAs produced, but pH can also regulate the composition of VFAs produced during acidogenic fermentation (Lee et al., 2014). Therefore, the optimal pH should be determined before the production of selective VFA. (Wang et al., 2014). reported that the AD of food waste was explored, and it was discovered that butyric acid was the predominant product (80%) below pH 5.0. In contrast, acetic acid was the primary product when pH was kept constant at 5.0, followed by butyric acid, propionic acid, and valeric acid (Jiang et al., 2013). Some other reports state that butyric acid appeared as a major VFA at a pH 8.0 and propionic acid at pH 6.5 (Kim et al., 2011; Min et al., 2005). (Begum et al., 2018) demonstrated the proportion of VFA produced at pH 5.5 as acetic acid (major) followed by formic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid while alkaline pH 11 favoured the production of butyric acid followed by acetic acid, formic acid, and propionic acid. A stepwise increase in the pH was demonstrated as a novel concept to maximize the acidogenic fermentation, thereby increasing the yield of VFA production. 4.2.2 C/N ratio The production of VFA and its distribution is significantly influenced by the C/N ratio of the substrate during acidogenic fermentation. (Fu et al., 2012). demonstrated an approximately 87% increase in VFAs concentration when C/N ratios were increased from 3.2 to 60 while utilizing textile wastewater treatment sludge as a substrate. Increasing C/N ratios during algal sludge and waste paper co-digestion also increased VFAs production (Yen and Brune, 2007). Fu et al. (2012) increased the C/N ratio by adding starch and observed that the concentration of propionic acid and butyric acid slowly increased after 8–16 d of fermentation and became steady. Elefsiniotis et al. (2005) showed that the increase in butyric acid production was due to the increase in carbohydrates during the co-digestion of starch-rich industrial and municipal wastewater. Numerous researchers reported that an increase in the C/N ratio generally enhances butyric acid production. Still, the distribution pattern of VFAs may be different since it also depends on the substrate type and metabolic pathway of acidogens (Liu et al., 2008). A study estimated the effect of the C/N ratio on lipids, which are the products of VFAs when used as a carbon source. A C/N ratio of 300 was reported as most suitable for the highest lipid accumulation in oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus curvatus due to pH regulation by acetate in the fed-batch system (Béligon et al., 2015)."
13,Biological parameters,"4.3 Biological parameters Acidogenic fermentation involves many interconnected microbiotas. As a result, determining the community of microbial communities is one of the most important steps in increasing VFA production (Jie et al., 2014). The research on biological characteristics of microorganisms to improve VFA production. Lim and Vadivelu (2019) employed a sequential batch reactor (SBR) to assess VFAs produced by suppressing the growth of VFA-utilizing methanogens. The authors reported Lactobacillus, Olsenella, Aeriscardovia, Pseudoramibacter, Atopobium, unidentified Coriobacteriaceae, and Prevotella as the prevalent species in the reactor producing a considerably enhanced amount of VFA (43.8%). Liu et al. (2014) reported Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi as the major groups to produce VFAs during co-fermentation of food waste and excess sludge without pH control. Plenty of Bacteroidetes are present during the co-fermentation process, resulting in higher acetate and propionate production than butyrate (Yang et al., 2014). Inoculum type is another important parameter which influence the VFA production and it affects the evolution of fermentative pathways (De Gioannis et al., 2013). Thus, physicochemical and biological parameters significantly affect VFA production as well as VFA distribution. Because of this, they are selecting an optimal range of different parameters is one of the most important means to maximize VFA production economically."
14,Extraction methodology for VFAs,"The sample collection, pre-treatment, and storage depend upon the type of effluent and its source process. Sample preparation for VFA measurement usually is necessary and requires centrifugation, gravity filtration, vacuum filtration, centrifugation, and dialysis to separate the particulate matter from the mixture (Wagner et al., 2017). Centrifugation is generally used for particulate separation at 3000–15000×g for 5–15 min (Wagner et al., 2017). Playne (1985) took samples from anaerobic lignocellulosic substrate fermentation and added metaphosphoric acid to the supernatant after centrifugation; metaphosphoric was added to observe any precipitate formation further be removed by brief centrifugation before storing the sample at 5 °C in well-packaged serum bottles. Preservation allows analysis of VFA concentrations in different conserved samples at different time intervals. In Gas Chromatography (GC) determination, particulate separation is followed by acidification with acids such as formic acid (M.-L. Zhang et al., 2009), sulphuric acid, oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, which serves the purpose of increasing volatilization of organic compounds and precipitation of other organic contaminants. Filtration of centrifuged and acidified samples through various filters such as 0.20 μm RC filter (Wagner et al., 2017), 0.5 μm PES filters (Robert-Peillard et al., 2012), 0.22 μm Millipore filter (de Sá et al., 2011) has also been reported before gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography or other analysis techniques."
15,Liquid-liquid extraction,"5.1 Liquid-liquid extraction Reactive extraction or liquid-liquid extraction is the oldest and well-established technique for VFA extraction where an organic solvent (like alcohols, ketones, ethers, and aliphatic hydrocarbons). Which offers a high distribution coefficient and is immiscible in water, forms a complex with the desired product (like acetic acid), causing its movement from the aqueous phase into the organic phase (Ijmker et al., 2014; Strazzera et al., 2018). Several physical and chemical parameters determine the efficiency and rate of the extraction process, such as distribution coefficient, degree of extraction, loading ratio, rate constant of product and solvent reaction, mass transfer characteristics, solvent and VFA properties, temperature, pH and acid concentration (Myrto-Panagiota Zacharof and Lovitt, 2013a, 2013b). The effective separation of VFAs from fermentation broth is a tedious task due to low concentrations of VFAs in broth. A mixture of some chemical extractants with extraction solvents can increase VFA separation efficiency; e.g., using 20% tri-n-octylamine with 1-decanol at optimized process conditions provides a promising system for VFA separation (Eda et al., 2017). Based on the solvent used, liquid-liquid extraction has been divided into three classes: (1) Carbon-bonded oxygen-bearing extractants such as alcohols and ethers; (2) Organophosphorus extractants such as trioctylphosphine oxide and tributyl phosphate (Sohrabi et al., 2011); and (3) Aliphatic amine extractants such as tri-octylamine (Ijmker et al., 2014). Comparison of an extraction efficiency of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and dichloromethane (DCM) suggested MTBE to be a better solvent with 5 times higher extraction efficiency than DCM (Mkhize et al., 2014). Other notably efficient solvents include organophosphates such as trioctylphosphine oxide and tri-n-butyl phosphate. Fermentation waste streams have been reported to accumulate VFAs, and extractants such as tributyl phosphate are used to recover the organic acids from such streams. Solvent extraction has been a feasible method for the recovery of both carboxylic and hydroxyl VFAs. Using medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) for VFAs extraction has been considered an economic extraction process when the MCFAs are diluted with hexane or toluene. Not only the process becomes more economically feasible, but the extraction efficiency too is not affected over large dilution ranges (Rocha et al., 2017). Ionic solvents have been more efficiently used to extract VFAs, providing high distribution coefficients than conventional solvents. Butyric acid extraction with the regeneration of the ionic liquid by short path distillation has been reported to provide higher extraction efficiency (Blahušiak et al., 2012)."
16,Membrane processes for the separation of VFAs,"5.2 Membrane processes for the separation of VFAs Membrane separation processes are an alternative to overcome the disadvantages of liquid-liquid extraction systems for the specific high costs of solvents. Different membrane types have been used to separate VFAs (Sun et al., 2009), such as zeolite membrane, silicate membrane, poly (acrylic acid-co-acrylonitrile) membranes, asymmetric polycarbonate membrane, acid-proof silicate-1 zeolite membrane, polyvinyl alcohol membrane, silicate silica composite membrane. Nanofiltration outperformed various pressure-driven filtration procedures such as microfiltration, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and reverse osmosis. It is better at separating salts from small organic molecules, requiring less energy, installation, and operation cost and retaining compounds up to 150–250 g M−1 molecular weight along with multivalent ions (Afonso, 2012). Micro and nanofiltration of waste effluents from anaerobic digesters of agricultural wastes were performed by Zacharof and Lovitt (2014). Microfiltration recovered acetic acid and butyric acid at concentrations of 21.08 mM and 15.81 mM, respectively. In comparison, further filtration with various nanofiltration membranes enhanced the retention ratios up to 75%. It gave 53.94 mM of acetic acid and 28.38 mM of butyric acid, indicating higher efficiency of nanofiltration membranes in VFA recovery (M − P Zacharof and Lovitt, 2013a, 2013b). Reverse osmosis showed a better membrane for separating acetic acid from lignocellulosic hydrolysates than nanofiltration (F. Zhou et al., 2013). Extraction of VFAs by a membrane with only water as extractant can ease out the concentration procedure as the need to remove other solvents would be eliminated (Outram and Zhang, 2018). A novel study on the design and investigation of using an anaerobic membrane distillation bioreactor (anMDBR) for VFAs recovery was conducted by (Yao et al., 2018, 2019). Domestic wastewater treatment and VFA recovery from permeate were investigated using a lab-scale, cost-efficient, minimal footprint anMDBR with submerged hollow fibre membranes. Acetic acid was separated at the highest concentration of 58.6 mgL−1 while propanoic, butyric, and isovaleric acid were reported to have higher transport rates despite having higher boiling points than acetic acid, which could be due to their higher partition coefficient leading to faster transport across the membrane (Yao et al., 2018, 2019). Electrical field-driven membranes are used in electrodialysis to separate particles depending on charge. When paired with fermentation and membrane biological reactors, it is one of the most promising approaches for VFA extraction. Conventional electrodialysis has been reported to remove over 90% VFAs from hydrogen fermentation broths, enhancing their recovery and hydrogen yield with reduced inhibitory effects of VFAs in the broth (Jones et al., 2015). Acetate and propionate produced during the AD process are recovered by applying direct current. Acetate removal was about 40% with electrodialysis and AD application (Dai et al., 2019). (Pan et al., 2018) established a unique system combining acidogenic fermentation with electrodialysis for the generation, concentration, and subsequent recovery of acetate, propionate, and butyrate from wastewater. During 22 d of operation, the system achieved a 4-fold higher concentration of acetate and a 3-fold higher concentration of butyrate and propionate at 20 V. However, the last 200 h of the process witnessed a reduction in the recovery ratio and migration rates of VFAs due to their over accumulation leading to reverse diffusion (Pan et al., 2018)."
17,Adsorption and ion-exchange,"5.3 Adsorption and ion-exchange Limited research has been performed on the use of adsorbents for the separation of VFAs. These methods are based upon the interaction between the carboxylate groups of VFAs with a solid adsorbent matrix. Adsorption is more of physical interaction, and ion exchange involves forming ionic bonds between the functional group of anionic resin and the ionized acid. Some studies indicate the use of activated carbon, polymer adsorbent of pyridine skeletal structure, and across-linked structure, ion exchange resins for the potential recovery of VFAs (Rocha et al., 2017). The adsorbents can be directly used in the effluent containing VFA, but the high cost involved in the regeneration of commercial adsorbents reduces the economic feasibility of the process. Some studies have noted the adsorption of synthetic VFA mixtures on different resins, while others studied the performance comparison of different matrices for adsorption of VFAs (da Silva and Miranda, 2013). Weak base resins show higher adsorption capacity (about 35%) than activated carbon for acetic, propionic, and butyric acid (da Silva and Miranda, 2013). Also, counter-current desorption was performed using n-propanol as eluent, which resulted in about 64% recovery of propionic acid and was the highest (da Silva and Miranda, 2013). The type of resin, the nature of the reaction medium, and the pH influence the adsorption and recovery efficiency of VFAs. Amberlyst A21, a tertiary amino resin, was used to adsorption VFAs from solution with only acetic acid, VFA synthetic mixtures, and actual effluent of grape pomace acidogenic AD (Rebecchi et al., 2016). The best performance of the resin was observed at pH 3–4.5 in the presence of acetic acid alone and a higher pH of 6.5 with the actual digestate."
18,Esterification,"5.4 Esterification Esterification for recovery of VFAs is a reversible reaction carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst where VFA such as acetic acid reacts with alcohol, forming an ester which is later hydrolysed to obtain acid. The efficiency of the esterification process depends upon the nature of the employed alcohol and catalyst, reaction temperature, and the amount of water present in the reaction mixture. The ester formed (e.g. ethyl acetate and butyl acetate) could either be used as an end product in desired cases or further converted into acid through a reversible reaction step (Lee et al., 2012). The recovery of acetic, propionic, butyric, Isobutyric, iso-valeric, and valeric acids produced from the anaerobic-mixed fermentation of slaughterhouse blood was performed by esterification membrane-based solvent extraction to compare the recovery efficiency of both processes (Plácido and Zhang, 2018). During esterification, a volume ratio of 1:0.3:0.5 for VFA, H2SO4, and CH3OH resulted in a 60–83% yield of VFA methyl esters and 50% (NH4)2SO4 was formed as a value-added by-product (Plácido and Zhang, 2018). A similar study for acetic acid recovery from chemical industry solutions using n-butanol and iso-amyl alcohol resulted in 58% conversion of acetic acid into n-butyl acetate when a 1:2 acetic acid to butanol molar ratio was used. In comparison, the same ratio of acetic acid to iso-butyl alcohol provided 51% acetic acid conversion from its aqueous solution (Saha et al., 2000)."
19,Distillation and evaporation,"5.5 Distillation and evaporation Distillation and evaporation are volatility-based separation processes, which utilize vapour pressure differences among components to separate them (Myrto-Panagiota Zacharof and Lovitt, 2013a, 2013b). These processes, however, are known to be less feasible in the case of low VFA concentrations as generally observed in fermentation broths and wastewaters. The mixture of VFA and water has minimal vapour pressure. The conventional distillation technique requires many equilibrium stages and a high reflux ratio to separate VFAs from water (Fasahati and Liu, 2014). Removal of large quantities of water from the mixture requires high energy and operating costs, creating a significant drawback for the process. Therefore, in recent years, methods like distillation and evaporation have improved process efficiency with reduced expenses. Reactive distillation and membrane distillation techniques are the most widely employed methods for separating VFAs from mixtures. Membrane distillation integrated with the product recovery unit has increased plant economy and VFA concentration from 3% to 10% in fermentation broth (Fasahati and Liu, 2014). Thermophilic bioreactors integrated with membrane distillation systems (MDBR) provide the advantage of enhanced bacterial activity due to heat input and a theoretical 100% rejection of non-volatile compounds, reducing the costs associated with post-treatment of effluent (Gryta et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2019). Separation of short-chain fatty acids from the synthetic acidic fermentation broth of municipal sewage sludge (Ren et al., 2011) by applying the combined method, i.e. using tributyl phosphate (TBP) reactive extraction with vacuum evaporation stripping. The extraction efficiency of short-chain fatty acids by TBP was 98.47% under 15 min extraction at room temperature and a 1:1 extraction phase ratio. Stripping of the fatty acids from the oil phase was done at 100 °C with vacuum evaporation for 30 min, resulting in extraction efficiency of 99.74%, 91.42%, 66.63%, and 40.52%, respectively for acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids (Ren et al., 2011)."
20,Use of VFAs and their commercialised products,
21,Biodiesel,"6.1 Biodiesel Currently, the raw materials used for biofuel production, biodiesel or bioethanol, are generally food and agriculture-related crops (Jhariya et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2021). It has led to an increased effect on the cost of food crops and the agricultural land required for their cultivation to be used for biofuel production (Bouriazos et al., 2014). An alternative to this problem can be using such carbon sources, which could be converted into lipids and subsequently to biodiesel. VFAs are one such carbon source produced from food waste sludge and other organic biodegradable wastes under anaerobic conditions that can be converted into lipids by oleaginous microorganisms, further used for biodiesel production. The advantages of using VFAs are their low cost compared to other feedstock and their production by anaerobic fermentation of various organic waste streams (S.-J. Lim et al., 2008a, 2008b; P. Zhang et al., 2009). (Vajpeyi and Chandran, 2015) demonstrated using VFA mixtures to accumulate lipids by oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus albidus in batch and chemostat cultures with synthetic and food waste-derived VFA. The use of synthetic VFAs under batch growth and nitrogen limitation led to intracellular lipid accumulation of 28.33 ± 0.74% g g−1 dry cell weight (maximum for the employed yeast), which was similar to that obtained by chemostat (29.88 ± 1.92%, g g−1) (Vajpeyi and Chandran, 2015). VFAs are potential economic alternative carbon sources for lipid accumulation, like other commercial biodiesel feedstocks. In a similar study (Fei et al., 2011b), observed lipid accumulation by Cryptococcus albidus using VFAs, acetates, and ethanol as a carbon source in a two-stage batch culture. The authors observed a lipid content increase of 43.8% when only VFAs were used as a carbon source in the second stage (Fei et al., 2011a). VFAs from fermented food waste, when used for lipid production by Cryptococcus, curvatus, resulted in a low lipid content at 13.8%, which might be due to the presence of the low carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (3.2:1), implying the importance of reducing nitrogen-containing compounds in the fermented waste if the lipid content is to be enhanced (Chi et al., 2011). Microbial lipid synthesized from VFAs has a fatty acid composition like soybean oil and Jatropha oil, thus making it a better raw material for biodiesel production. (Park et al., 2014). performed an economic assessment of lipid accumulation and biodiesel production using low-cost biomass VFAs as carbon source and multi-stage continuous high cell density culture (MSC-HCDC). The low-cost VFAs were economically comparable to the other raw materials such as palm oil, soybean oil, and microalgae oil (Park et al., 2014). The studies regarding lipid accumulation by oleaginous yeast utilizing VFAs as a carbon source suggest the high feasibility of VFAs for biodiesel production."
22,Alcohols and ester production,"6.2 Alcohols and ester production Acidification during of waste materials containing lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates causes the production of VFAs in the effluent streams. Acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid are formed from gases like carbon dioxide and hydrogen (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). The biological reduction of the carboxylic group of VFAs using hydrogen as an electron donor has been studied as an approach to produce alcohol from raw materials other than the conventional fermentable sugars. Similar work was done by (Steinbusch et al., 2008), who reduced acetic, propionic, and butyric acid in batch modes using mixed microbial cultures and hydrogen as an electron donor. Their work produced 3.69 ± 0.25 mM of ethanol, 8.08 ± 0.85 mM of propanol, and 3.66 ± 0.05 mM of n-butanol with methane as the major by-product in each experiment (Steinbusch et al., 2008)."
23,Use of VFA's in microbial fuel cell,"6.3 Use of VFA's in microbial fuel cell VFAs in effluent streams with fermentative waste products can be utilized as fuel for power generation, thus allowing for the proper channelling of the chemical energy for efficient power generation from renewable sources and waste depletion. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a bio-electrochemical system (Fig. 4 ), which harnesses the chemical energy present in organic wastes and converts it into electrical energy with the help of microorganisms. Pant et al. (2013) used a two-step continuous process to convert effluent chemical energy into electrical energy with VFAs and hydrogen as the first step, followed by electricity production using VFAs in MFCs shown in Fig. 4(a). VFA (specifically acetate) rich effluent was used in batch operated MFCs obtaining a decline in the concentration of VFAs over time and achieving a Columbia efficiency of 46%, generating 65.33 mA m−2 at a specific cell potential of 148 mV (Pant et al., 2013). Among the different VFAs, acetate is easily consumed in MFC compared to higher molecular weight, like propionate and butyrate, leading to the fact that the type of VFA fed in MFC affects the Coulombic efficiency as well as power density. (Chang and Han, 2011). Other similar studies have shown that acetate fed MFCs performs better than propionate and butyrate fed MFCs. Acetate is the primary electron donor for anodic bacteria when compared by Columbia efficiency and power density (Chae et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2008). Different compositions of VFA mixtures affect the bacterial community's power density, type, and performance along with the degree of consumption of different VFA components (Teng et al., 2010). Acetate and butyrate are preferred carbon sources in a mixed VFA system, and the rest are consumed at a slower rate, resulting in an insignificant current generation (Freguia et al., 2010). Jeong et al. (2008) estimated the removal rate of total VFAs from organic wastes and soluble COD by MFCs. The removal rate and removal efficiency, respectively, were 3.79 g L−1d−1 and 92.7% for total VFAs and 5.88 g L−1d−1 and 94.7% for soluble COD (Jeong et al., 2008). The correlation between VFAs' concentration and electricity produced was studied by (Kaur et al., 2013) using Coulumbic efficiency and cyclic voltametric methods. The approaches were used to identify acetate, propionate, and butyrate concentrations and distinguish between distinct VFA species by evaluating the size and shape of each VFA-enriched MFC's oxidation-reduction peaks at various concentrations (Kaur et al., 2013)."
24,Use of VFA's in microbial electrolysis cell,"6.4 Use of VFA's in microbial electrolysis cell Many substrates are not entirely utilized in H2 production through dark fermentation. It gets converted into other metabolites by side reactions. These metabolites mainly include VFAs, alcohols and CO2 (Laxman Pachapur et al., 2015; Tapia-Venegas et al., 2015). VFAs serve as an efficient carbon source in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) and photo-fermentation (Escapa et al., 2016). MECs are energy generation devices derived from MFCs and can be used for H2 generation from VFAs formed in dark fermentation (as shown in Fig. 4(b)). They use diverse microbial species and substrates and hence are valuable systems for H2 production. Unlike MFC, MEC does not generate energy on its own; it requires the input of direct electrical current to the cathodic chamber in order to produce H2 (Noori et al., 2019; Yasri et al., 2019). The anodic chamber contains active bacterial consortia that use VFAs as substrates to liberate electrons and protons. The electrons travel through an external circuit to the cathodic chamber, whereas the transfer of protons occurs via a proton exchange membrane which separates both the electrode chambers (Kadier et al., 2014; Yossan et al., 2013). The protons and electrons then combine to form H2, which is released from the cathodic chamber. Effluents of dark fermentation have been effectively valorised for H2 generation through MECs. Many studies have reported the use of industrial wastewaters (Escapa et al., 2016), cellulose (Wang et al., 2011), waste activated sludge (W. Liu et al., 2012), cheese whey (W. Liu et al., 2012), and other organic feedstocks as substrates in MECs. These studies underline the significant role of microbial communities in biofilm formation and the improvement of bio-electrochemical H2 production in MEC. A study on microbial diversity and its changes during H2 production process in MEC revealed minor variations in diversity with prevalent Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (San-Martín et al., 2019). The production process was reportedly stable, with an optimal H2 production rate of 15.3 g N d−1m2 (San-Martín et al., 2019). Sciarria et al. (2019) also performed a similar study on microbial diversity where different microbial communities were observed in the anodic chamber of the acetate fed-batch single-chambered MEC. The communities were found to contribute towards the formation of biofilm. To estimate H2 production, Zakaria et al. (2019) treated primary sludge from wastewater treatment in MEC to achieve a production rate of 145 L m−3d−1 hydrogen. There is still a lack of knowledge regarding the impacts of various factors on MEC performance, particularly at large scale processes. Improvement in MEC performance has also been attempted by optimizing process parameters such as pH, temperature, and reactor design, but the outcomes are not satisfactory enough for large-scale implementation (Kadier et al., 2016; Lu and Ren, 2016)."
25,Conclusions,"VFAs made from waste or biological feedstocks including sludge, biodiesel waste, and industrial wastes are environmentally friendly, pollutant-free, and economically viable and reduce the costs and GHG emissions connected with the entire manufacturing process. Acidogenic fermentation is a good model for producing VFAs while keeping the physical and chemical parameters as low as possible. To ensure optimal VFA production, critical parameters such as substrate, reactor, microbial culture, pH, temperature, SRT, HRT, and OLR must be carefully controlled and monitored. The composition of VFAs is determined by these operating parameters, which is an important component for successful and cost-effective downstream processing. To assure the removal of deleterious entities from substrates such as sludge, adequate pre-treatment methods must be assessed. Further research into the present difficulties could improve the future production and application prospects for VFAs while also ensuring their long-term sustainability."
