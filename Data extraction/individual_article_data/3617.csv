0,Introduction,"The world’s energy consumption has been mainly delivered by fossil fuels, perhaps since the discoveries of coal and natural petroleum. The use of various forms of energy generated from fossil fuels has brought us comfort and convenience for long time. For example, electricity, heat and mechanical energy have been produced from fossil fuels, and we use them in many various industries, in our homes and for transportation. However, the overwhelming scientific evidence is that the unlimited use of fossil fuels has been causing climate change on Earth, with potentially disastrous effects. Consequently, in recent years, worldwide efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels by utilizing alternative sustainable energy sources such as the sun, wind, tides, geo-thermal heat, etc., have been intensively pursued. Among the types of sustainable energy resulted from these sources, solar energy has been given much more attention than other types due to its unlimited availability. The generation of electricity by the use of photovoltaic materials and sunlight [1], as well as by the use of steam produced with solar heat [2], has been already commercialized in some countries with subsidies from their governments. However, electricity alone cannot replace the whole usage of fossil fuels. For example, electricity cannot be easily transported and stored like fossil fuels. On the other hand, H2 has the potential to supplement and possibly replace fossil fuels without causing any environmental pollution if H2 is produced by splitting H2O with a sustainable energy [3]. Consequently, there have been a number of studies in the literature regarding H2 production from H2O-splitting with solar energy. For example, at present, there are three pathways of producing H2 from H2O-splitting with solar energy: photo-catalytic [4], photo-electrochemical [5] and thermochemical [6]. In the literature, both photo-catalytic and photo-electrochemical H2O-splitting have been extensively studied since the discovery of the photo-electrochemical H2O-splitting on TiO2 by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [7]. For example, a number of modification techniques and chemical additives have been developed to improve photo-catalytic activity of TiO2 [4]. Noble metal loading [8,9], and doping of metal [10] or anions [11] on TiO2 have been tested to reduce the energy band gap which allows a more efficient utilization of sunlight. Dye sensitization [12,13], Cds-TiO2 composite [14] or CdS–TiS [15–17] composite semiconductors have also been tested to improve the degree of utilization of visible light. In order to sustain reaction cycles, electron sacrificial agents and redox mediators have been added into the reaction system [18,19]. However, despite all these efforts, the energy conversion efficiency of photo-catalytic H2O-splitting is too low to consider the possibility of commercialization at present stage. The same problem has also arisen with the photo-electrochemical method when TiO2 was used as photo-anode of a photo-electrochemical cell with Pt cathode. TiO2 photo-anode can give only about 1% of energy conversion efficiency although it shows good corrosion resistances to water and sunlight [5]. On the other hand, when carbon modified n-type TiO2 [20] or valence semiconductors [21] are used as a photo-anode, the energy conversion efficiency of up to 16% is possible. However, these materials possess limited water corrosion and photo-corrosion resistances [5]. Thus, at present, it is fair to say that H2 production from H2O-splitting by the use of either photo-catalytic methods or photo-electrochemical methods is still academic. On the other hand, a theoretical energy conversion efficiency of around 75% can be attained in the production of H2 from a thermal dissociation of H2O with solar energy when the dissociation temperature becomes less than 2500 K [22]. Thus, from the standpoint of energy conversion efficiency attainable in the near future, the thermal H2O-splitting method is more attractive than the other H2O-splitting methods with solar energy. However, the development of H2 production process with the thermal dissociation of H2O has been hampered by a high dissociation temperature. A dissociation temperature of at least 2500 K is required for a reasonable degree of dissociation [23–26]. For example, thermal H2O dissociation ratios can be calculated to show about 0.55% at 2000K and 4.3% at 2500 K using the values of equilibrium constants at various temperatures [27]. Consequently, there have been some efforts to reduce the reaction temperature through the development of a multi-step thermochemical H2O-splitting process. In this method, H2O reducing materials such as Zn, SnO, MnO and SO2 have been used to produce H2 by oxygenating themselves [28–30]. The resulting oxygenated materials can be reduced at a lower temperature than 2500 K. For example, ZnO can be reduced at 2300k [28], SnO2 at 1900K [29], Mn2O3 at 1800 K [30] and H2SO4 at 1900K [30]. However, these methods still require an operation temperature higher than 1800 K. This requirement for the operation temperature can cause problems with materials for the reactor and with energy conversion efficiency for the process [6,31]. Therefore, in order to develop a viable H2 production technology by the use of thermal H2O-splitting, it might be easier to find some ways of lowering the dissociation temperature than to search for special reactor materials suitable for high dissociation temperatures. In this study, we show that the dissociation temperature for thermal H2O-splitting can be drastically lowered when H2O is split on solid acid materials. In the past, photo catalysts such as TiO2 and its derivatives, among non-metallic materials, were believed to be the only materials capable of producing H2 by splitting H2O with the aid of photonic energy. Recently, however, it has been found that zeolite materials can also be used to produce H2 from H2O-splitting upon heating [32,33]. In this case, zeolite in a batch reactor was heated to 773 K and maintained for 2 h under a pressure of 10−2 mmHg so as to remove volatile matters in zeolite. The reactor was then cooled by ambient air to room temperature. In turn, superheated steam was introduced into the cooled reactor until the temperature of reactor became 773 K. It was claimed that H2 production occurred during the period of steam introduction and maintaining the reactor temperature at 773 K for 4 h. We have also discovered that when a wetted Al2O3 with H2O is heated at an atmospheric pressure, H2 is produced. These results imply that there is a common characteristic shared by TiO2, zeolites and Al2O3 which causes the production of H2 by splitting H2O. It was thought that the common characteristic could be the acidic behavior of these solid materials since all of them are categorized as solid acids. Consequently, we have expanded our study into other solid acid materials whether or not they also have the same capability of producing H2 by splitting H2O and further into the mechanism of the reaction. A solid acid such as SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, CaCO3, bentonite, zeolite, etc., exhibits the tendency to accept an electron pair on its metal sites (Lewis acid sites) [34]. Thus, when H2O is adsorbed on solid acid material two kinds of weak bonds are formed between the solid acid and H2O. For example, when H2O is adsorbed on Al2O3 an electron pair of O in H2O is weakly shared by Al to form a coordinate bond. As a result, H in H2O is positively charged and forms a hydrogen bond with a negatively charged O in Al2O3 as described in Fig. 1 (c) [35]. Although two other singly bonded structures between H2O and Al2O3 (Fig. 1(a) and (b)) are also possible, the doubly bonded structure (Fig. 1(c)) should be favored due to its higher stabilization energy. In a similar way, it seems certain that when H2O is adsorbed on solid acid materials, two kinds of weak bonds, a coordinate bond and a hydrogen bond, are formed between solid acid materials and H2O. As a consequence, if conductive electrons were generated in the solid acid materials and H2O with the aid of some kind of energy supply and exchanged through the coordinate bond and the hydrogen bond, H2O could be split to produce H2 on the solid acid, as seen in a photo reduction of H2O on TiO2 [7]. In other words, H2O can be electrolyzed to produce H2 on a solid acid by taking a conductive electron from the solid acid through the hydrogen bond and at the same time giving a conductive electron to the solid acid through the coordinate bond."
1,Experimental,
2,Reaction system and apparatus,"2.1 Reaction system and apparatus A typical continuous packed bed reaction system as well as a batch reactor was used for the experiments conducted in this study. For the continuous packed bed reaction system, a controlled quantity of carrier gas (CO2 or N2), sometimes simultaneously with H2O were continuously fed by a pressure gradient of about 4 bar into a pre-heating chamber, where H2O evaporation occurred. The resulting gas mixture was then passed through the packed solid acid materials placed either in a Pyrex glass reactor (Fig. 2 (a)) that was heated by a heating band or in a 316 stainless steel reactor (Fig. 2(b)) that was heated in a temperature-controlled furnace. The batch reactor (Fig. 2(c)) was used to investigate if both H2 and O2 were produced from H2O-splitting under a supercritical condition. The product gases from the reactor were analyzed through a gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The maker and model of GC/TCD is Agilent Technologies 6890 N. The column used for GC/TCD is made of stainless steel and 6 feet long. The inner diameter of the column is 1/8 inch, in which the uniform mixture consisting of 90% 60/80 mesh Molecular Sieve 5A and 10% 13X was tightly packed. The oven temperature of GC/TCD was maintained at 313 K for the first 2 min and then raised at a rate of 10 K/min for 26 min to reach the final temperature of 573 K. Ar (99.999 vol%) was used as a carrier gas for the GC/TCD analysis."
3,Material preparation and characterization,"2.2 Material preparation and characterization All the solid acid materials used in this study, except for activated Al2O3, were of reagent grades and purchased from major reagent manufacturers: silica gel consisting of 60–100 mesh particles from Aldrich, CaCO3 and ZnO from Kanto Chemical, and TiO2 from Junsei Chemical. The activated Al2O3 (D-201, 4–6 Grade) was purchased from UOP LLC in USA. When purchased, the activated Al2O3 had an approximate granular diameter of 3–5 mm. To improve its reactivity, however, its granules were crushed to yield particles under 200 mesh before they were used for the experiments. The other solid acid materials were used without alteration. BET specific surface area measured by N2 adsorption at 77 K were 331 m2/g for the silica gel, 228 m2/g for the activated Al2O3, 7.2 m2/g for the CaCO3, 9.8 m2/g for the TiO2, and 5.8 m2/g for the ZnO. The maker and model of BET surface area measuring equipment used in this study is Micrometrics (USA) and ASAP 2010. All the solid acid materials were baked at 823 K for 1000 min before use. Gases such as CO2 (99.999 vol%), N2 (99.999 vol%) and Ar (99.999 vol%) in pressurized stainless steel containers were purchased from Shinyang Oxygen Co. in Korea. The GC/TCD chromatogram of the purchased gases showed no peak representing H2. The water used in this study was produced in our laboratory by distilling city water, and then treating it with an ultra pure water system (Easypure LF, Barnstead International, USA)."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure As the first step of the experiment in the continuous reaction system, a solid acid material was put inside the reactor. The reactor was then connected to the continuous reaction system. The electric heater that was installed in the mixing chamber for the evaporation of incoming H2O was turned on to keep the temperature of the mixing chamber at 423 K. The electric heating band surrounding the 1/8” stainless steel connection tubing was also turned on to maintain the temperature of the outside wall of tubing at a temperature higher than 423 K. Prior to the main experiment, 50 ml/min of either CO2 or N2 (carrier gas) was fed into the reaction system for 2 h to evacuate air left in the reaction system. The feed rate of carrier gas was then adjusted to 2 ml/min for the main experiment. Sometimes water at 1 g/h was also fed into the mixing chamber along with the carrier gas. In the mixing chamber water was vaporized and mixed with the carrier gas, and the gaseous mixture of water vapor and carrier gas was fed into the reactor. The heater surrounding the reactor was turned on about 10 min before the feeding of water. It usually took about 30 min for the reactor to reach the target temperature from the beginning of the heating. However, the elapsed reaction time was not counted until the temperature of the reactor reached the target temperature. The reactor temperature of the glass reactor (Fig. 2(a)) was measured on the outside wall of the reactor. An average reactor temperature was calculated by using the temperature measured at 1 cm above the bottom of the solid acid bed and that at 1 cm above the top of the bed. The reactor temperature measured at the bottom was maintained at about 548 K during the experiment. However, the reactor temperature measured at the top of the reactor varied with the solid acid material used for the experiment. Those were 673 K for the silica gel, 678 K for the activated Al2O3, 671 K for the CaCO3, 674 K for the TiO2, and 677 K for the ZnO during the experiment. The reaction temperature of stainless steel reactor was measured at 1 cm above the bottom of the solid acid bed through the thermocouple in the thermo-well installed in the reactor (Fig. 2(b)). In some experiments, solid acid materials which had been used in a H2O-splitting reaction at a high temperature were rewetted in-situ for another H2O-splitting reaction. For the in-situ rewetting of the solid acid materials, the reactor temperature was lowered to < 323 K, and then 2 g/h of H2O vapor at 423 K together with 2 ml/min of carrier gas was fed into the cooled reactor where the H2O vapor was condensed and adsorbed on the solid acid materials in the reactor. With these rewetted solid acid materials, another H2O-splitting reaction can be repeated by raising the reactor temperature to a target temperature. For batch reactor experiments, a baked solid acid material was put into the reactor until the reactor (Fig. 2(c)) was tightly and fully packed with the solid acid material. In turn, 5 wt% of H2O was added into the reactor. Air in the reactor was evacuated by flowing CO2 at 20 ml/min through the reactor for 3 h. The pressure of reactor was then raised up to 0.2 MPa with CO2 and then up to 9 MPa with Ar gas at room temperature. It was thought that adsorption of O2 on the solid acid materials would be hindered by CO2. For comparison purposes, two blank tests were also conducted: without putting H2O into the reactor, and only with H2O and the mixed gases in the reactor. In the former case, only a baked solid acid material and the mixed gases were put into the reactor. For all the cases, when the heating band surrounding the reactor was turned on to raise the reactor temperature to 663 K, the pressure in the reactor became about 30 MPa. Since the critical temperature and pressure of H2O are 647 K and 22 MPa, H2O in the reactor should be in supercritical states."
5,Results and discussion,
6,H2 production from H2O-splitting on solid acid materials in a glass reactor,"3.1 H2 production from H2O-splitting on solid acid materials in a glass reactor A set of experiments was designed and conducted to easily demonstrate that H2O can be split to produce H2 on solid acid materials. A Pyrex glass reactor (Fig. 1(a)) in a typical continuous packed bed reaction system was used for the experiments to avoid possible contamination by metals. Silica gel, activated Al2O3, CaCO3, TiO2 and ZnO were tested among solid acid materials. As mentioned earlier, when a solid acid material is wetted with H2O, two kinds of weak bonds, a coordinate bond and a hydrogen bond, are formed between the solid acid material and H2O. Thus, if conductive electrons were generated in this doubly bonded structure and exchanged between the two molecules with the aid of thermal energy the H2O could be electrolyzed to produce H2. In order to investigate this hypothesis, dried samples and wetted samples were prepared with each of the selected solid acid materials. In this study, the dried sample was prepared by heating the solid acid material in a furnace for 1000 min at 823 K. This kind of heat treatment was needed to remove vaporizable materials including H2O in the solid acid materials so as to increase the number of unoccupied metal sites (Lewis acid sites), on which H2O could be adsorbed. The wetted sample was prepared by dipping the dried sample into distilled water for 24 h at room temperature, followed by drying this soaked sample in an oven until the weight increase in the sample, compared to the dried sample, became around 5%. The drying time required for the preparation of wetted samples were then about 5 h at 423 K for Silica gel, 4 h at 423 K for activated Al2O3, 2.5 h at 423 K for CaCO3, 4 h at 373 K for TiO2, and 4.5 h at 373 K for ZnO. For the experiments, the temperature of the reactor at around 610 K and a continuous CO2 carrier gas feeding into the reactor at 2 ml/min were maintained at an atmospheric pressure. The product gas samples were taken at 1 h after the reactor temperature had reached the target. They were then analyzed through GC/TCD. The resulting measured concentrations of H2 in the product gas at the reaction time of 1 h are summarized in Table 1 . Those were 200 ppm for 30 g of the wetted silica gel, 870 ppm for 50 g wetted activated Al2O3, 1590 ppm for 50 g wetted CaCO3, 260 ppm for 50 g wetted TiO2 and 630 ppm for 50 g wetted ZnO, while no detectable amount of H2 was measured with any of the dried samples. These results clearly indicate that some portion of H2O adsorbed on the solid acid materials was split to produce H2 upon heating. It will further be shown in the subsequent section that the concentration of H2 in the product gas increases with increasing reaction temperature, but with different temperature dependencies for different kinds of solid acids. For example, although the CaCO3 yielded the highest H2 concentration in the product gas at 610 K, it will be shown that the activated Al2O3 produced the highest H2 concentration at 1073 K. An experiment to measure H2 concentration in the product gas vs. reaction time was also conducted with 50 g CaCO3 (5.0 wt% H2O) in the glass reactor at 610 K and an atmospheric pressure. In this case, 1.0 g/h of vapor H2O together with 2 ml/min of N2 carrier gas were continuously fed into the reactor to see whether or not the additional feeding of H2O vapor can significantly increase the production of H2. As shown in Fig. 3 , however, the H2 concentrations in the product gas were 1370 ppm at 0.5 h, 710 ppm at 1 h, 320 ppm at 1.5 h and 90 ppm at 3 h, and became almost 0 ppm after 5 h. This implies that the rate of H2 production decreased rapidly with increasing reaction time, H2O adsorption on CaCO3 was extremely limited at a temperature higher than 610 K, and that a continuous H2 production could not be achieved by simply supplying H2O vapor into the hot solid acid materials. It is also noted here that the H2O-splitting efficiency depended partly on the carrier gas used. For example, 1590 ppm of H2 in the product gas was detected at 1 h when CO2 was used as a carrier gas while only 710 ppm of H2 was measured at 1 h with a N2 carrier gas. It was thought that the higher affinity of CO2 to a solid acid than that of N2 resulted in a higher H2O-splitting efficiency."
7,Effects of reaction parameters on H2O-splitting,"3.2 Effects of reaction parameters on H2O-splitting Among the reaction parameters, the temperature dependency of H2O-splitting on solid acid materials was investigated first to find a possible optimum reaction temperature where the highest efficiency of H2O-splitting would be obtained. However, the experiments were conducted only up to a reaction temperature of 1073 K due to a temperature limit on the reaction system. In these experiments, a stainless steel reactor (Fig. 2(b)) was used to facilitate higher temperatures (∼1073 K). 60g of wetted Al2O3 (5.5 wt% H2O) in the reactor and the feeding of CO2 carrier gas at 2 ml/min were also used with a varying reaction temperature. Fig. 4 compares the H2 concentrations in the product gas at a reaction time of 1 h and the total amounts of H2 produced during the experiments at various reaction temperatures. The results of a blank test at 873 K were also compared in Fig. 4 to show the contribution of the stainless steel reactor in the production of H2. However, it can be seen in Fig. 4 that the concentration of H2 in the product gas obtained at 873 K is about 4% higher than that obtained at 673 K while the difference between the results obtained at 873 K and at 1073 K reduced to 1%. Thus, it is expected that the concentration of H2 in the product stream with a reaction temperature higher than 1073 K would be slightly higher than that obtained at 1073 K, and that an optimum reaction temperature probably be little higher than 1073 K. The dissociation conversion of H2O on Al2O3 at 1073 K can also be calculated by considering the initial quantity of H2O and the amount of H2 produced. Since the quantity of H2O adsorbed on Al2O3 was 3.30 g or ca 4110 ml and the total amount of H2 produced was about 12.2 ml at 1073 K (Fig. 4), the dissociation conversion of H2O could easily be calculated to yield ca 0.30%. This dissociation conversion actually represents 10000 times larger value than the thermal dissociation equilibrium conversion of about 0.00003% for free H2O at 1073 K. This also means that the use of Al2O3 can reduce the dissociation temperature of H2O-splitting since 0.3% of H2O dissociation can only be achieved at around 1900K with the direct thermal equilibrium. Thus, the reduction in the dissociation temperature, in this case, is about 830 K. The effect of H2O content in Al2O3 on H2 production was also investigated to find an optimum H2O contents in Al2O3 (Fig. 5 ). In these experiments, the stainless steel reactor with 60 g of wetted Al2O3, the reaction temperature of 973 K, and 2 ml/min of N2 carrier gas were used under an atmospheric pressure. In Fig. 5, it is seen that H2 concentrations in the product gas increases with increasing H2O content in Al2O3 at least up to 40 wt%. Solid acid materials wetted with more than 40 wt% H2O could not be tested in this study due to an explosive vaporization of H2O in the reactor at 1073 K. Again it can be noticed that the effect of carrier gas on H2 production is significant. As seen in Figs. 4 and 5, the H2 concentration in the product stream at 973 K with CO2 carrier gas (Fig. 4) was about 6 times higher than that with N2 carrier gas (Fig. 5). The H2O-splitting capabilities of selected solid acids were also compared at 1073 K. For these experiments, wetted samples of silica gel (33.2 wt% H2O), activated Al2O3 (33.5 wt% H2O), CaCO3 (33.5 wt% H2O), TiO2 (33.6 wt% H2O), and ZnO (33.8 wt% H2O) were prepared and tested with a CO2 carrier gas feeding of 2 ml/min and H2O of 1 g/h. The changes in H2 concentrations in the product gas with increasing reaction time were compared in Fig. 6 while the cumulative amounts of H2 produced vs. reaction time for each solid acid were summarized in Fig. 7 . As shown in Fig. 6, H2 concentration in the product gas began with a large value for the wetted TiO2, but it quickly reduced to a small one and became almost zero at a reaction time of 3 h. This implies that the cumulative amounts of H2 produced for the wetted TiO2 increased rapidly at the initial stage, but it became stagnant after 1 h and almost zero after 3 h (Fig. 7). On the other hand, for the wetted activated Al2O3, it took about 0.5 h to reach the highest H2 concentration in the product stream (Fig. 6) but the cumulative amounts of H2 produced continuously increased with increasing reaction time (Fig. 7). As a result, the activated Al2O3, as a whole, produced more H2 than the other solid acid materials at 1073 K (Fig. 7). It should be reminded here that CaCO3 produced the largest amount of H2 at 610 K among the selected solid acids. This implies that different solid acids have different kinds of temperature dependency in the H2 production capability. This seemed to be caused by the differences in the band gap energy of solid acid as well as the stabilization energy of H2O adsorption on solid acid. These will further be discussed in the subsequent section. In any case, Figs. 6 and 7 show again that H2O adsorption on hot solid acid materials is extremely difficult at a high temperature. Thus, in order to develop a continuous H2 production process with the thermal H2O-splitting on a solid acid material, some efficient ways of supplying wet solid acid materials continuously into a hot reactor should be devised. Preliminary parametric studies on the effects of acid strength and surface area have also been carried out. Three different types of wetted zeolites: 3A (5.9 wt% H2O), 4A (5.0 wt% H2O), and 13X (5.7 wt% H2O) were used for the experiments to investigate the effect of acid strength. It is known that zeolite 13X shows the strongest acidic behavior among the samples, and 3A shows the weakest [36,37]. The results of the experiments show that zeolite 4A produced the largest amount of H2 and zeolite 13X produced the smallest when a CO2 carrier gas feeding of 2 ml/min were used at the reaction temperature of 1073 K. These results indicate that an optimal acid strength range exists for a solid acid where the largest amount of H2 is produced. Three activated Al2O3 distinguished by different surface areas (228 m2/g, 15.1 m2/g, 3.9 m2/g) were also briefly tested to see the effect of surface area on H2 production. It was found that there is practically no difference in the amounts of H2 produced from these activated Al2O3. This implies that the surface area of solid acid materials is not a sensitive parameter in the production of H2 as long as the surface area exceeds 4 m2/g. In addition to these parametric studies, the ratio of H2/O2 between the accumulated quantities of H2 and O2 produced by H2O-splitting was also investigated through the analysis of the results obtained from an experiment with 60 g of a wetted Al2O3 (20 wt% H2O) in the stainless steel reactor. For the experiments, Ar gas at 50 ml/min was fed into the reactor at room temperature for 3h to evacuate air left in the reactor. Then the Ar feeding rate was adjusted to 1 ml/min. At the same time, a sampling bag having a volumetric capacity of 1000 ml was attached to the exit of the reactor for the collection of all the products evolved from the reactor. Right after the sampling bag attachment, the heater surrounding the reactor was turned on to raise the reactor temperature to 873 K for about 20 min and it was maintained at 873 K. The product gas samples were taken at 0.5 h and 1 h after the reactor temperature reached 873 K and analyzed by GC/TCD. The concentration of H2 and that of O2 were 1680 ppm and 1920 ppm at 0.5 h, respectively, and 2920 ppm and 1600 ppm at 1 h, respectively. Thus, the ratios of H2/O2 in the sample bag could be calculated to give 0.875 at 0.5 h and 1.825 at 1 h. After the reaction time of 1 h, the ratio increased slowly toward 2. These results imply that H2 resulting from H2O-splitting stayed longer than O2 in solid acid materials. It can be assumed in theory that the population density of negatively charged O in Al2O3 is 1.5 times higher than that of positively charged Al, and that the probability of forming hydrogen bonds for the produced H atoms is higher than that of forming coordinate bonds for the produced O2. As a result, the evolution rate of H2 might have been slower than that of O2."
8,H2O-splitting on solid acid materials in a supercritical condition,"3.3 H2O-splitting on solid acid materials in a supercritical condition Whether or not H2O-splitting on solid acid materials occurs under a high reaction pressure was also investigated. For this investigation, a baked solid acid material was put into the reactor until the reactor was tightly and fully packed with the solid acid material. In turn, 5 wt% of H2O was added into the reactor. Air in the reactor was evacuated by flowing CO2 at 20 ml/min through the reactor for 3 h. The pressure of reactor was then raised up to 0.2 MPa with CO2 and then up to 9 MPa with Ar gas at room temperature. It was thought that the presence of CO2 would hinder the adsorption of O2 on the solid acid materials. For comparison purposes, two blank tests were also conducted: without putting H2O into the reactor, and only with 4g of H2O and the mixed gases. In the former case, only a baked Al2O3, 0.2 MPa CO2 and 11.8 MPa of Ar gas were put into the reactor. The reactor packed with solid acid materials and the mixed gas was then heated to a temperature of 663 K to make the pressure in the reactor became about 30 MPa. Since the critical temperature and pressure of H2O are 647 K and 22 MPa, the state of H2O in the reactor should be supercritical. These reaction conditions were maintained for 24 h, and then the temperature was lowered and the product gas was analyzed. Fig. 8 shows the GC/TCD chromatogram of product gases resulted from a wetted CaCO3 (5.0 wt% H2O), a wetted activated Al2O3 (5.0 wt% H2O), a wetted silica gel (5.0 wt% H2O) and a dried Al2O3 while Table 2 compares the results of GC/TCD analyses for H2 and O2. In Fig. 8, a peak representing N2 was also shown along with peaks representing H2 and O2. A small amount of air was still left in the reactor after the 3 h of CO2 flowing through the reactor (Fig. 8). In Fig. 8 and Table 2, however, it is clear that H2O-splitting on solid acid materials occurs to produce H2 even in a supercritical state for H2O. On the other hand, the results obtained from both the blank tests show no peak representing H2. Although it was difficult to find a 2 to 1 ratio between the amounts of H2 and O2 produced in the reactor due to the small quantities of H2 and O2 production and the air left in the reactor, similar ratios were found in the product gas (Table 2)."
9,A probable reaction mechanism,"3.4 A probable reaction mechanism As mentioned in the introduction section, when H2O is adsorbed on a solid acid two kinds of weak bond, a coordinate bond and a hydrogen bond are formed between the H2O and the solid acid owing to chemical characteristics of solid acid. Also, the results of this study clearly showed that H2 is produced from H2O-splitting. Thus, it can be assumed that the most probable way of H2O-splitting on a solid acid is through electron exchange between the H2O and the solid acid in the doubly bonded structure. This could result in H2O electrolysis on the solid acid as briefly described in Fig. 9 . The solid acid in this case acts like a molecular cell for the H2O-splitting. In this cell, O in the solid acid responsible for the hydrogen bond is a cathode since it emits an electron to H2O and the metal in the solid acid becomes an anode since it takes an electron from H2O. A more detailed explanations and supporting evidences for the H2O-splitting mechanism proposed in Fig. 9 can further be given as follows. According to Tanabe, a solid acid is a kind of solid which has metal-O bonds in its structure and a tendency to accept an electron pair of other molecule on its metal site (Lewis acid sites) [38]. For example, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, CaCO3, and zeolite have these characteristics and are categorized as solid acids. It is also known that the metal in the metal-O bonds is positively charged and the O negatively charged due to the differences in electronegativity of the two molecules. The term ‘electronegativity’ is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons, and the value of O is given by 3.5 while that of metal less than 2.2 [39]. Thus, when H2O is adsorbed on a solid acid an electron pair of O in H2O is dragged and weakly shared by metal in the solid acid to form a coordinate bond between O in H2O and metal in the solid acid. At the same time, negatively charged O in the solid acid can form a hydrogen bond with positively charged H in the H2O in order further to increase the bonding strength between the H2O and the solid acid. In other words, when H2O is adsorbed on a solid acid the doubly bonded structure between H2O and the solid acid occurs most probably as shown in Fig. 1. The generation of conductive electrons in solid acid materials is also possible in principle since an electron belonging to the valance band of semiconductor or insulator can move up into the conduction band if a larger photonic, electrical and/or thermal energy than the band gap energy of the material is provided. For example, if Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution derived from quantum mechanics could be applied to approximate the energy state of electrons in the valance band, all the electrons would have different energy states and there would be some electrons whose energy state is higher than a certain level [40]. This implies that conductive electrons having higher energy states than the band gap energy of a solid acid can be generated in the solid acid at any temperature other than absolute zero, and the number of conductive electrons increases with increase in the temperature of the solid acid material. Consequently, the electron exchange through the coordinate bond and the hydrogen bond between the H2O and the solid acid in the doubly bonded structure occurs to split to H2O on the solid acid as proposed in Fig. 9. At the moment of electron exchange, however, the metal has an extra electron while the O involved in the electron exchange in the solid acid has a hole. Nevertheless, this electronically unstable state of the solid acid would be instantly normalized through an electron-hole recombination in the solid acid. This stabilization process is not shown in Fig. 9. These analyses together with the experiment results of this study suggest that increase in the reaction temperature would increase H2 production if and only if the doubly bonded structure between H2O and a solid acid were to be preserved. It can also be expected that among various kinds of solid acids the one having the lowest band gap energy would generate more conductive electrons than others at a specified temperature and that the one with the highest stabilization energy for H2O adsorption would preserve the doubly bonded structure up to the highest temperature. Thus, not only the band gap energy of a solid acid but also the stabilization energy of H2O adsorption on the solid acid is important for the estimation of a qualitative trend of H2 production from H2O-splitting on a solid acid. Fortunately, the band gap energy of some important solid acid materials has been reported in the literature. For example, the band gap energy of polycrystalline SiO2 was measured to give 9.3 eV, polycrystalline Al2O3 7.1 eV, and polycrystalline TiO2 3.0 eV [41] while that of polycrystalline ZnO was measured to give 3.2 eV [42]. The band gap energy of calcite CaCO3 was also measured to give 5.1 eV [43] and aragonite CaCO3 5.5 eV [44]. These imply that the band gap energy of the same material can vary depending on the crystal structure of the materials. The degree of variation, however, will not significantly alter the conclusion of this study since the results of this study depend mainly on chemical properties of a solid acid than on physical structures of a solid acid. The stabilization energy of H2O adsorption on Al2O3 also has been calculated in the literature to give 335.5 kJ/mol for the doubly bonded structure (Fig. 1), which represents an energy quantity large enough for a portion of H2O adsorbed on Al2O3 to withstand 1073 K for at least 5 h as seen in Fig. 6. It can also be predicted from the results shown in Fig. 6 that the stabilization energy of H2O adsorption on TiO2 is lower than that of H2O adsorption on Al2O3 since H2 production on TiO2 almost ceased after the reaction time of 3 h at 1073 K. Thus, a solid acid having high stabilization energy for H2O adsorption may be recommended for a high temperature H2O-splitting, and a solid acid having low band gap energy may rather be used in a low temperature H2O-splitting. In order further to enhance the validity of the proposed H2O-splitting mechanism, two kinds of additional experiments were conducted. One was to investigate whether or not a solid acid material can maintain the H2O-splitting capability after being used in a number of repeated H2 production reactions. The other was to investigate if a solid acid can also be used to produce H2 by splitting alcohols, which are expected to form a doubly bonded structure with the solid acid material like H2O does. For the first investigation, solid acid materials once used in a H2O-splitting reaction at 973 K was rewetted with H2O, in-situ, in the reactor. For the rewetting process, the temperature of reactor was lowered to < 323 K by air cooling for about 3.5 h. In turn, the vapor H2O at around 423 K was fed into the cooled reactor at the rate of 2 g/h for 3 h. The vapor H2O would liquefy in the reactor and was adsorbed on the solid acid materials. Then, the reaction temperature was raised again to 973 K in 0.5 h and maintained for 17 h to repeat the H2O-splitting reaction. Fig. 10 shows the changes in H2 concentrations in the product gas when a process described above was repeated. In this experiment, 60 g of wetted silica gel (initially 5.3 wt% H2O) in the reactor and 2 ml/min of CO2 carrier gas were used. The results (Fig. 10) clearly indicate that solid acid materials can maintain the capability of H2O-splitting even after being used in a number of repeated experiments. For the second investigation, some organic materials such as alcohols and formic acid that were considered to form a doubly bonded structure with a solid acid material were also tested to see whether or not they are also split on the solid acid material. The glass reactor and CO2 carrier gas were used for the test with an average reaction temperature at around 610 K and a carrier gas feeding of 2 ml/min. Wetted silica gel samples with methanol (5.1 wt%), ethanol (5.9 wt%), n-propanol (5.0 wt%), i-propanol (5.6 wt%), t-butanol (4.9 wt%), and formic acid (5.3 wt%) were tested in the experiments. The results show that the silica gel wetted with formic acid produced the largest amount of H2 while the silica gel wetted with methanol produced the smallest amount (Fig. 11 ). Thus, it seems clear that all the chemical species which can form a doubly bonded structure with a solid acid material can be split to produce H2 upon heating."
10,Conclusion,"In thermal dissociation of H2O to produce H2, the dissociation temperature can be drastically lowered when H2O is split on solid acid materials. The dissociation conversion of H2O was ca 0.30% on Al2O3 at a reaction temperature of 1073 K, which represents about 10000 times greater value than that resulted from a thermal equilibrium of H2O at the same temperature. The same dissociation conversion of H2O can only be achieved at around 1900K when the direct thermal equilibrium method is used with free H2O. The effects of some reaction parameters on H2 production from H2O-splitting on solid acid materials were also investigated. It was found that the amount of H2 produced increased with increasing reaction temperature at least up to 1073 K and the amount of H2 produced is almost proportional to the H2O content in solid acid materials. An optimum reaction temperature where the H2O-splitting efficiency becomes the highest was expected to occur at a little higher temperature than 1073 K for Al2O3. It was also found that the efficiency of thermal H2O-splitting on solid acid materials partly depended on carrier gas used in the experiments. The use of CO2 carrier gas gave a higher dissociation conversion for H2O-splitting than that resulted from using N2 carrier gas. This was thought as a result of a stronger affinity of solid acid materials with CO2 than N2. Some experiments under pressures higher than 22 MPa at 663 K were also conducted. The results confirm that H2O-splitting on solid acid materials can occur even in a supercritical state for H2O. Regarding a probable mechanism for H2O-splitting on a solid acid material, it is proposed that when H2O is adsorbed on solid acid materials two kinds of weak bonds, a coordinate bond and a hydrogen bond, are formed between solid acid materials and H2O. In turn, conductive electrons were generated in the solid acid materials and H2O upon heating and exchanged through the coordinate bond and the hydrogen bond between the H2O and the solid acid. This results in H2O electrolysis on the solid acid to produce H2. Thus, the solid acid acts like a molecular cell in the process of H2O-splitting. In this cell, O in the solid acid responsible for the hydrogen bond is a cathode since it emits an electron to H2O and the metal in the solid acid becomes an anode since it takes an electron from H2O. Theoretical considerations on H2O-splitting on a solid acid suggest that not only the band gap energy of a solid acid but also the stabilization energy of H2O adsorption on the solid acid is important for the estimation of a qualitative trend of H2 production. For example, a solid acid having a low band gap energy may rather be used in a low temperature H2O-splitting, and a solid acid having high stabilization energy for H2O adsorption may be recommended for a high temperature use. It was also found that solid acid materials can maintain the capability of H2O-splitting even after being used in a number of repeated experiments. Other chemical species such as alcohols and formic acid which can form a doubly bonded structure with a solid acid material were also split to produce H2 with the aid of thermal energy."
