0,Introduction,"Because of recent concerns about global warming and rapid fossil fuel depletion, biomass has received considerable attention as a sustainable and carbon-neutral resource for producing renewable fuels and chemicals [1–3]. Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, a second-generation biomass feedstock, to renewable fuels is not plagued by concerns about the fuel vs. food competition, which is the main drawback of first-generation biofuels (e.g., corn-to-ethanol, natural triglyceride-to-biodiesel). There are several ways to convert lignocellulosic biomass to energy and fuel, which include combustion, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction, and fast pyrolysis [4–6]. Among these techniques, fast pyrolysis is considered a highly promising and relatively scalable technique for producing liquid fuels from a variety of feedstocks (grass, trees, and organic wastes) because of its simplicity and low processing cost [7–10]. A moderate yield of bio-oil (50–80wt%) can be achieved at reaction temperatures of 500–600°C with a very short reaction time of less than 5s [11]. However, the physicochemical properties of the bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis are very poor, which make fast pyrolysis bio-oil unsuitable for direct use as a combustion or transportation fuel [7,8,11–13]. For example, fast pyrolysis bio-oil has a large amount of oxygen-containing species such as acids, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, furans, and levoglucosans; the oxygen content is in the range of 35–40wt% [13]. In particular, low-molecular-weight acids (such as formic acid and acetic acid) are highly reactive and give rise to many undesirable properties such as polymerization upon heating and instability during storage and transportation [14,15]. In addition, the low-molecular-weight acids are highly corrosive, and thus expensive anti-corrosive equipment and harsh downstream processing conditions are required. The highly-oxygenated compounds, such as furans and levoglucosans, lower the calorific value of bio-oil (e.g., the higher heating values (HHVs) are in the range of 15–20MJkg−1) [13,16,17]. In addition, the high water content in the produced bio-oil increases the ignition delay and induces phase separation between the organic and aqueous phases [18]. The poor volatility caused by heavy fractions, the formation of re-polymerized products during storage [19], and the immiscibility with fossil-derived fuels [13] make direct use of the “crude” bio-oil as a fuel difficult. Therefore, the development of proper upgrading techniques for decreasing the oxygen-containing species, increasing the calorific value, and stabilizing bio-oil is highly required for ultimate utilization of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. Several upgrading techniques have been developed to improve the physicochemical properties of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. These include hydrogenation [20–22], hydrodeoxygenation [23–25], catalytic cracking [26,27], esterification [28–30], emulsification [31,32], and catalysis in supercritical fluids [33–36]. In the presence of external molecular hydrogen and catalysts (e.g., sulfide CoMo-, NiMo-, and noble metal- (Ru, Pd, Pt, etc.,) supported catalysts, acid-impregnated silica, and acidic/basic metal oxides), effective hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking has been achieved, with reduction of the oxygen content and depolymerization of the high-molecular-weight species (e.g., pyrolytic lignin) in the bio-oil. Depending on the bio-oil sources, reaction media, and catalysis conditions, the upgraded oil had an oxygen content in the range of 15–36wt% and a HHV in the range of 20–35MJkg−1 [17]. However, the high consumption of expensive hydrogen and deactivation of the catalysts due to coking and inorganic impurities (e.g., Si, K, Fe, Al, etc.) and water [37,38] make catalyst-based upgrading processes less economically viable. Recently, we proposed a supercritical ethanol-based approach for upgrading heavy-fraction fast pyrolysis bio-oil without using external hydrogen and catalysts. The hydrogen derived from the decomposition of supercritical alcohol in the hydride form [39] or proton transfer [40,41] and the unique reactivity of supercritical alcohols (e.g., esterification [42], alkylation [43,44], hydroxyalkylation [39,45], deoxygenation [46,47]) can result in effective reduction of the oxygen content, cracking of pyrolytic lignin, and suppression of re-polymerization. For example, a high-yield of upgraded oil (83.0wt%) with a high HHV of 34.1MJkg−1 and a low total acid number (TAN) of 4.8mg KOH g−l could be achieved in scEtOH at 400°C. Even though the previous work demonstrated the great potential of scEtOH-based upgrading, the utilization of scEtOH as the reactant raises several critical questions. (1) Although renewable ethanol can be produced by monosaccharide fermentation, ethanol is currently used as a transportation fuel and is much more expensive than methanol. In this context, can we develop an effective upgrading process using supercritical methanol? (2) During bio-oil upgrading, supercritical alcohol, as the hydrogen source and the reactant, will participate in the reaction. How much alcohol will be consumed during bio-oil upgrading? (3) Does the alcohol participation have a significant effect on the energy balance of the upgrading process, such as the energy recovery (ER) and energy efficiency (EE)? (4) Is supercritical alcohol-based upgrading effective for light-fraction fast-pyrolysis bio-oil containing a large amount of water? In this study, we aim to develop an economically viable, supercritical methanol (scMeOH)-based upgrading technique and determine the feasibility of addressing the issues raised in the questions above. To gain comprehensive understanding of the energy balance of the non-catalytic and non-external hydrogen upgrading process, a new separation protocol was developed to estimate the amount of alcohol consumed during the upgrading and recovery of upgraded light-fraction bio-oils (ULBOs), which were typically evaporated and were not considered in most previous studies. Based on the alcohol consumption and the recovery of the ULBOs, new definitions of the bio-oil yield, ER, and EE are proposed. Upgrading at 400°C with 9.1wt% bio-oil for 30min in scMeOH allowed achievement of a high bio-oil yield of 78.4wt%, a significant reduction of the TAN from 92.2 to 4.0mg-KOH/g-oil, a high ER of 94%, and an EE of 79% (under the assumption that the HHV of the ULBOs is 20.0MJkg−1). The effect of the supercritical alcohol, reaction time, and bio-oil concentration on the yields and properties of the upgraded bio-oil are discussed in detail. In addition, the detailed chemical compositions of the upgraded heavy-fraction bio-oils (UHBOs) and ULBOs produced in scMeOH under varying reaction conditions are presented. Based on compositional analysis of the UHBOs and ULBOs, plausible upgrading mechanisms are proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The bio-oil used in this study was produced with a pilot-scale, fast pyrolysis apparatus using empty palm fruit bunch as the lignocellulosic biomass feedstock. Two separation units were installed in the downstream of the fast pyrolysis apparatus to recover the high-boiling-point fraction (HBF) bio-oil at around 150°C and low-boiling-point fraction (LBF) bio-oil at around 70°C. In this study, the low-boiling-fraction oil was used as the upgrading feedstock. Table 1 lists the properties of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil used in this study. Prior to the upgrading reaction, the low-boiling-fraction oil was stored in a refrigerator to avoid the aging effect [14,15]. HPLC-grade methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol, and acetone were purchased from Honeywell Burdick and Jackson® (USA). For the TAN and water content measurements, toluene (EP grade, Daejung Chemical & Metals Co., South Korea), deionized water (HPLC grade, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan), and Hydranal®-Composite 5 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) were used. High-purity nitrogen (99.999%), helium (99.999%), and air (99.999%) were purchased from JC Gas Company (South Korea)."
3,Upgrading reaction,"2.2 Upgrading reaction A custom-built, SUS 316 reactor with an inner volume of 140mL was used for the upgrading reaction in the supercritical alcohols. The reactor was equipped with a magnetic stirrer and two heating sources (cartridge heaters and a heat furnace). A detailed description of the reactor system used in this study is given elsewhere [17]. After loading the reactor with a known amount of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil and alcohol, the reactor was sealed and purged with N2 several times by using the purge line dipped into the reactor in order to remove dissolved oxygen in the liquid phase and the oxygen in the reactor head. After purging, the reactor was pressurized with N2 at 1MPa and the stirring rate was fixed at 500rpm. The reactor was then heated to the desired experimental temperatures at an average heating rate of 15°Cmin−1. After the desired reaction time, the reactor was water-quenched to a temperature of 100°C and then cooled to room temperature using an electric fan. The heating and cooling time were not included in the reaction time."
4,Product analysis and characterization,"2.3 Product analysis and characterization A schematic of the product separation protocol is shown in Fig. 1 . To quantify the amount of alcohol consumed during the upgrading reaction and the amount of upgraded light-fraction bio-oils (ULBOs) that evaporated during recovery of the upgraded heavy-fraction bio-oils (UHBOs), a new separation protocol (which was developed in our previous work [48]) was employed in the current study. Herein, only a short description of the separation protocol is given. After cooling the reactor to room temperature, the produced gas was passed through a wet gas meter (W-NK-2 type, Shinagawa Corporation, Japan) to estimate the gas volume; the gas was collected in Tedlar® gas sampling bags (1 L) for compositional analysis (Step 1a, Fig. 1). The total mass of the reaction mixture ( W R ) comprised the mass of UHBO ( W UHBO ), solid residue ( W SR ), water formed as a byproduct ( W W ), gas ( W G ), unreacted alcohol that was used as the liquefaction solvent ( W UA ), and ULBO ( M ULBO ). (1) W R = W UHBO + W SR + W W + W G + W UA + W ULBO The solid residue was separated from the liquid product by filtration. The solid residue was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with acetone to recover the residual oil trapped in the solid residue. The weight of the solid residue was measured after drying at 70°C for 24h (Step 4). To quantify the water content and the unreacted alcohol in the reaction mixture, a small amount of sample (∼4mL) was taken from the reaction mixture in the reactor and analyzed by Karl Fischer titration and gas chromatography-time of-flight/mass spectroscopy (GC-TOF/MS), respectively (Step 2). The filtrate was fractionated into UHBO and ULBO using rotary evaporation and a cold trap. To recover the UHBO (Step 7), rotary evaporation at 50°C at a pressure of 0.02MPa for 1h (Step 5) followed by vacuum drying at 70°C and near 0MPa for 24h was carried out (Step 6). During the vacuum drying, the evaporated liquid was recovered in a cold trap (Step 6a, a model CTB-10 cold trap bath, Jeiotech, South Korea) connected to the vacuum oven. The coolant used for the cold trap bath was ethylene glycol and water mixture (60 v/v%) and the temperature of the cold trap bath was maintained at −40°C. The liquid recovered in the cold trap was found to be 80–90wt% water; thus, the oil fraction in the cold traps was not considered in the yield and energy efficiency calculations (under an assumption that the organic species in the cold trap was C6 species (e.g., levoglucosan), the carbon and energy loss of the organics in the cold trap were approximately 1.9–3.8% and 2.3–4.5%, respectively). The ULBOs were recovered in a receiving flask that was connected to the rotary evaporator (Step 5a) and the cold traps connected to the chiller (Step 5b, a model CTB-10 cold trap bath, −40°C). The ULBOs in the receiving flask and the cold traps were then mixed. The yields of the upgraded bio-oil, solid residue, gaseous products, and produced water were calculated using Eqs. (2)(5). In the equations, 'dafb' indicates dry ash free based, ‘db’ indicates dry based, W LBF is the weight of LBF fast pyrolysis bio-oil, W AC is the weight of alcohol consumed, W W is the weight of produced water, and W LBF - W is the weight of water in the LBF bio-oil. (2) Upgraded bio - oil yield ( wt % ) = W UHBO ( dafb ) + W ULBO ( dafb ) W LBF ( dafb ) + W AC × 100 (3) Gas yield ( wt % ) = W G W LBF ( dafb ) + W AC × 100 (4) Solid residue yield ( wt % ) = W SR W LBF ( db ) + W AC × 100 (5) Water yield ( wt % ) = W W - W LBF - W W LBF ( dafb ) + W AC × 100 Elemental analysis of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil and the upgraded bio-oil was performed using a Vario EL cube elemental analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany). The HHV of the bio-oil was calculated based on the elemental analysis results using the DIN 51900 standard (Eq. (6)). (6) HHV ( MJ kg - 1 ) = ( 34 C + 124.3 H + 6.3 N + 19.3 S - 9.8 O ) 100 In Eq. (6), C, H, N, S, and O are the weight percentages of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen, respectively, obtained from elemental analysis. UHBO contained negligible amount of water, and ULBO contained less than 3wt% water. Therefore, the water content in the UHBO and ULBO did not significantly affect HHVs. On the other hand, the water content in the LBF bio-oil (23.7wt%, Table 1) was taken into account in the HHV calculation. The amount of alcohol consumed and the ULBO produced were incorporated into the energy balance estimation. The energy recovery (ER), which compares the total energy content of the upgraded bio-oil produced with the total energy content of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil, was calculated using Eq. (7). (7) ER = ( HHV UHBO × m UHBO ) + ( HHV ULBO × m ULBO ) ( HHV LBF × m LBF ) + ( HHV AC × m AC ∗ ) × 100 where m LBF and HHV LBF are the mass (measured using the dry ash-free basis method) and HHV of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil, respectively. Similarly, HHV UHBO is the HHV of the upgraded heavy bio-oil, and m AC ∗ and HHV AC are the mass and HHV of the alcohol consumed, respectively; m ULBO and HHV ULBO are the mass and HHV of the upgraded light bio-oil, respectively. Thereafter, the energy efficiency (EE) was calculated using Eq. (8), which compares the output energy obtained using the upgraded bio-oil with the input energy (energy in fast pyrolysis bio-oil+energy in alcohol consumed+energy consumed for the upgrading reaction). Even though estimation of EE is based on some over-simplifications (e.g., same value of specific heat taken over the whole temperature and pressure range, energy required for production separation is not considered), EE could provide a good indication of the process profitability. (8) EE = ( HHV UHBO × m UHBO ) + ( HHV ULBO × m ULBO ) [ HHV LBF × m LBF ] + [ HHV AC × m AC ∗ ] + [ m LBF × C p,LBF × ( T - 20 ) + m alcohol × C p,alcohol × ( T - 20 ) + m H 2 O × C p,H 2 O × ( T - 20 ) ] × 100 The TAN was measured by titrating the bio-oil sample with 0.1M KOH in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) using a Metrohm 877 Titrino Plus (Metrohm Ltd., Switzerland) instrument. The TAN calculation was carried out using Eq. (9) as described in ASTM D664–11a. (9) TAN ( mg KOH g - 1 ) = ( A - B ) × M × 56.1 W In Eq. (9), 'A' is the volume of KOH in the isopropyl alcohol solution that was used to titrate the bio-oil to the last inflection end point (mL), 'B' is the blank titration volume (mL), 'M' is the concentration of alcoholic KOH solution (mol L−1), and 'W' is the mass of the bio-oil. The water content was determined by Karl Fischer titration using a Metrohm 877 Titrino Plus instrument. The bio-oil composition was analyzed using an Agilent 7890NGC and Pegasus High Throughput (HT) time of flight (TOF)-MS system (Leco, USA). The specification and measurement conditions for GC-TOF/MS are specified in our previous paper [49]. All of the produced gases were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using a PerkinElmer Clarus 600 GC-Model Arnel 1115PPC Refinery Gas Analyzer (RGA) (PerkinElmer, USA). The specification details of the RGA-GC are given in a previous paper [50]. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a Q50 Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA Instruments, USA) under air and N2 atmosphere. The temperature was ramped from 30 to 800°C at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 using a gas flow rate of 60mLmin−1."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Properties of LBF bio-oil,"3.1 Properties of LBF bio-oil The water content in the LBF bio-oil was much higher (23.7wt%) than that in the HBF bio-oil (14.0wt%) [17] because of the low-temperature condensation in the second separation unit. No phase separation between the oil phase and the water phase in the LBF bio-oil was observed, indicating the highly hydrophilic nature of the bio-oil. A negligible amount of ash was present in the LBF bio-oil, as shown in Fig. S1. The TAN of the bio-oil was much higher (92.2mg-KOH/g-oil) than that of the high-boiling point fraction (69.4mg-KOH/g-oil) [17], indicating the presence of a higher amount of low-molecular-weight acids. The chemical composition of the LBF bio-oil, determined using GC-TOF/MS, is shown in Fig. 2 and listed in Table 1. The sum of the C+O+H elements in the LBF bio-oil was less than 100%, which could be caused by the vaporization of some light fraction in the analyzer. Detailed lists of chemical species in the LBF bio-oil are summarized in Table S1. A variety of chemical species, including sugar derivatives, acids, ketones, and phenols were detected; among them, the major chemical species included acetic acid (3, 18.8 area%), levoglucosan (17, 6.9 area%), 1-(hydroxy)-2-propanone (4, 11.9 area%), and 2(5H)-furanone (12, 3.1 area%), which can be derived from decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose. The total area% of the acidic species was 23.3%. Phenolic compounds such as 2-methoxy phenol, cresol, catechol, 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxytoluene, which can be produced from degradation of lignin, were also detected with a high area% of 17.1% [10]. Because of the acidic and phenolic species, the LBF bio-oil exhibited a high TAN value of 92.2mg-KOH/g-oil. In addition to the acids and phenolics, other types of oxygen-containing species, such as sugar derivatives, aldehydes, and ketones, were present in a large amount in the LBF bio-oil, resulting in a high oxygen content of 41.7wt% and a low HHV of 12.5MJkg−1."
7,Effect of supercritical alcohols,"3.2 Effect of supercritical alcohols To investigate the effect of the supercritical alcohols on the bio-oil upgrading process, methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol were employed, with a bio-oil concentration of 9.1wt% at 400°C for 30min, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . As the chain length of the alcohol increased, the initial pressure and the final pressure during the reaction period decreased (scMeOH: 34.7–36.6MPa, scEtOH: 25.9–28.4MPa, scIPA: 22.5–27.2MPa). As shown in Fig. 3 a, the yields of the total upgraded bio-oil (UHBO+ULBO) produced with the respective supercritical alcohols (determined using Eqs. (2)(5)) were similar (in the range of 77–85wt%). The gas yield (0.9–1.7wt%) and the solid residue yield (0.3–0.7wt%) were very low, indicating that conversion of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil into the liquid phase was dominant at 400°C. The mass balance was less than 100% (Fig. 3a); this may be because of sample loss during handling and separation of the samples and residual sample remaining in the reactor (e.g., on the fittings and magnetic stirrer). Notably, a much larger amount of ULBO than UHBO was produced. The ULBO may have originated from cracking of the high-molecular-weight bio-oil fractions and reaction between the cracked species and alcohol during the upgrading reaction. In addition, self-decomposition of the alcohols in their supercritical state could also contribute to some fraction of the ULBO [51]; to determine the contribution of self-decomposed alcohol products to the ULBO, blank experiments with the supercritical alcohol (without fast pyrolysis bio-oil feed) under the upgrading conditions (400°C for 60min) were performed, and the amount of unreacted alcohols was quantified. The blank experiments indicated that the amount of alcohol that was self-decomposed was very low (0.1wt% of scMeOH; 3.2wt% of scEtOH; 4.8wt% of scIPA). In comparison, the amount of alcohol consumed during the upgrading process was much higher (22.1wt% of scMeOH; 23.2wt% of scEtOH; 31.3wt% of scIPA) than the amount that was self-decomposed in the blank reaction. This indicates that the reaction between the bio-oil-derived intermediates and the alcohol is a major alcohol consumption mechanism. The alcohol participation in the upgrading reaction is discussed in a later section. The product yields estimated using the conventional methods (which were employed in most previous studies) are shown in Fig. S2. After the reaction, the whole liquid mixture was rotary-evaporated at 0.02MPa and 50°C for 1h, followed by vacuum drying at near 0MPa and 70°C for 24h to obtain the upgraded bio-oil. When the alcohol participation in the reaction and ULBO were not considered, the UHBO yield followed the order: scEtOH (83.8wt%)>scIPA (79.8wt%)>scMeOH (52.2wt%). The low yield of UHBO in the scMeOH upgrading process is attributed to the large contribution of the ULBO to the total bio-oil yield. The use of different types of alcohol did not result in a significant difference in the elemental composition and HHV of the UHBO, as listed in Table 2 and shown in the van Krevelen diagram (Fig. 3b). During the upgrading reaction, the oxygen content in the UHBO decreased from 41.7 to 23.3–25.2wt%, while the carbon content increased from 42.5 to 67.1–68.2wt% and the hydrogen content increased from 4.7 to 6.9–7.7wt%. As a result, the HHVs of the UHBO increased significantly from 12.5 to 28.9–30.5MJkg−1. As discussed previously, the amount of gases produced during the upgrading reaction was very low. The major gaseous species included CO2, CO, and CH4. The CO2 and CO could be produced by decarboxylation and decarbonylation, respectively, which may be the main oxygen removal reactions during the upgrading process. In addition, the production of water (Fig. 3a) during the reaction and the presence of H2 in the gas species may also imply that hydrodeoxygenation plays a role in the oxygen removal reaction. The decomposition of IPA released some amount of C2 species during the upgrading reaction. The GC-TOF/MS chromatograms of the UHBOs and ULBOs produced using scMeOH, scEtOH, and scIPA are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. Because of the highly-complex LBF bio-oil with numerous chemical species, self-decomposition of the alcohol in its supercritical state [51], and the reaction between the LBF bio-oil and the alcohol, a number of different reaction pathways are possible during the upgrading process; therefore, it is difficult to propose clear reaction pathways for each chemical detected in the chromatograms. However, several reactions could be proposed based on the changes in the chemical compositions before and after the upgrading reaction. The chemical species in UHBO were categorized into sugar derivatives, acids, alcohols, esters, ethers, furans, ketones, phenols, aldehydes, and hydrocarbons, as shown in Fig. 3d. In the ULBOs, the dominant chemical species were acetic acid esters that could be generated from the esterification reaction between acetic acid in the LBF bio-oil and the corresponding supercritical alcohols (acetic acid methyl ester, 1 in Fig. 5a, 56.3 area%; ethyl acetate, 5 in Fig. 5b, 38.9 area%, scEtOH; isopropyl acetate, 12 in Fig. 5c, 20.8 area%, scIPA). In addition, as shown in Fig. 3d, esters were among the main chemical species in the UHBOs. Ester formation may be the main deacidification mechanism for reducing the TAN of the UHBOs. As shown in Fig. 3d, a significant decrease in the area% of the acidic species was observed in the UHBOs produced in scMeOH and scEtOH, which agree well with the low TAN values (Table 2). However, in the case of the scIPA upgrading process, carboxylic acids such as propanoic acid (3 in Fig. 4c, 0.5 area%), 2-methyl-propanoic acid, (11 in Fig. 4c, 3.7 area%), and butanoic acid (15 in Fig. 4c, 0.6 area%) were detected. This could be one reason for the high TAN value of the UHBO produced in scIPA (53.35mg-KOH/g-oil). As shown in Fig. 3d, the amount of alcohols in the UHBO followed the order: scIPA (44.5 area%)>scEtOH (26.2 area%)>scMeOH (1.13 area%). Methanol has no α-carbon, and thus it is not possible for methanol to participate in self-aldol condensation. On the other hand, the presence of the α-carbon in ethanol and IPA allow them to participate in aldol condensation via formation of the corresponding ketone [51] to produce elongated carbon species with the alcohol functional group. The ring alkylation ability of scMeOH [43,52,53] could produce methyl-substituted aromatics in the UHBO, such as creosol (13 in Fig. 4a), 2,4,6-trimethyl-phenol (14), and 2,3,5-trimethyl-1,4-benzenediol (18). On the other hand, the amount of ethyl-substituted aromatics was much less than the quantity of methyl-substituted aromatics, and isopropyl-substituted aromatics were not observed in the UHBO because of the lower tendency towards ring alkylation associated with scEtOH and scIPA as compared to scMeOH. As seen in the chromatograms of the UHBOs, smaller molecular-weight species were produced as the carbon number of the supercritical alcohol increased. This suggests that more active cracking occurred in the scIPA medium as compared to the case in scMeOH and scEtOH. A similar trend was observed in the TGA profiles (Fig. S3). The LBF bio-oil underwent decomposition in two main temperature regions; the low-temperature decomposition around 125°C can be attributed to cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived species (e.g., furans, levoglucosan), whereas the high-temperature decomposition at around 505°C may be attributed to the high-molecular-weight lignin-derived species (e.g., pyrolytic lignin) [54]. The UHBO produced in scMeOH underwent initial decomposition at a higher temperature of 194°C, indicating that the high esterification and alkylation ability associated with scMeOH increased the molecular weight of the upgraded oil. As the carbon chain length of the supercritical alcohol increased in moving from MeOH to IPA, the first decomposition temperature decreased to 176°C, suggesting that the higher alcohol had less ability to participate in the chain elongation reaction. In particular, the UHBO produced in scIPA exhibited a sharp peak at 48°C, which could be attributed to the large amount of branched alcohols such as 2-methyl-2-pentanol, (5 in Fig. 4c) and 2,3-dimethyl-2-butanol (6 in Fig. 4c) that could be produced by the reaction of scIPA (e.g., self-decomposition of scIPA and/or reaction between bio-oil intermediates and scIPA). On the other hand, in the second decomposition temperature range, the peak height decreased with an increase in the carbon number of the supercritical alcohols, suggesting enhanced cracking of pyrolytic lignin in the higher supercritical alcohol."
8,Effect of reaction temperature,"3.3 Effect of reaction temperature Even though the scMeOH upgrading process at 400°C resulted in a significant increase in the calorific value and a decrease in the TAN, the high consumption of methanol at this high temperature (22.1wt%) should be carefully addressed. In this section, to evaluate the feasibility of low-temperature upgrading to minimize the methanol consumption, upgrading at 350°C was evaluated; the methanol consumption decreased from 22.1wt% to 16.2wt% with a decrease in the temperature from 400 to 350°C. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the yield of UHBO produced at 350°C was approximately two times higher, whereas the yield of ULBO at 350°C was slightly lower than those at 400°C. The gas yield at 350°C is approximately half of that obtained at 400°C. This suggests that the cracking reaction is suppressed at the lower reaction temperature to produce high-molecular-weight upgraded oil and to suppress gas formation [55]. Although the reaction at 350°C results in a high-yield of upgraded bio-oil, the properties of the upgraded bio-oil were not sufficiently improved; as listed in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 6b, the lower deoxygenation and esterification ability of scMeOH at 350°C resulted in a higher O/C ratio (0.34M ratio), lower HHV (26.8MJkg−1), and higher TAN (15.8mg-KOH/g-oil) compared with the values obtained at 400°C (HHV: 29.9MJkg−1, TAN: 3.98mg-KOH/g-oil). As shown in Fig. 6d, the area% of the sugar derivatives decreased significantly from 14.9 to 3.8% with an increase in the temperature from 350 to 400°C. The GC-TOF/MS chromatograms presented in Fig. S4 showed a large amount of unreacted sugar derivatives (e.g., 1,6-anhydro-á-D-glucopyranose, 22 in Fig. S4a, 12.9 area%) at 350°C."
9,Effect of bio-oil concentration,"3.4 Effect of bio-oil concentration To investigate the effect of the feed concentration on the yield and properties of the upgraded bio-oil, the concentration of fast pyrolysis bio-oil was varied from 9.1 to 25.0wt% at 400°C and the reaction was carried out for 30min in scMeOH. Because the amount of methanol charged into the reactor was fixed at 55.4g and the amount of fast pyrolysis bio-oil was increased for the high-concentration reaction, the reaction pressure at 400°C increased from 34.7–36.6MPa (9.1wt%) to 40.5–46.7MPa (25wt%). The bio-oil concentration could not be further increased because of the pressure limit of the current reaction system. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the high reaction pressure at the high concentration of bio-oil caused a relatively high mass loss; some of the light fraction, which was soluble in the scMeOH phase, was probably trapped inside the line fittings and on the magnetic stirrer during the upgrading reaction. This fraction could not be recovered completely when the reactor was vented to atmospheric pressure. This may account for the low yield of ULBO at high bio-oil concentration. On the other hand, the yield of UHBO increased from 11.5 to 20.2wt% with an increase in the bio-oil concentration from 9.1 to 25wt%. The amount of methanol consumed during the upgrading process increased from 22.1 to 39.6wt% with an increase in the bio-oil concentration from 9.1 to 25.0wt% because of more active methanol participation in the reaction. The increase in the bio-oil concentration did not significantly influence the H/C and O/C ratios of UHBO in the concentration in the range of 16.7–25.0 wt%, as shown in Fig. 7b. The chemical compositions of UHBO and ULBO produced at different bio-oil concentrations were quite similar, as shown in Figs. S5 and S6. The calorific values of the UHBOs produced at different concentrations were also very similar (in the range of 29.9–32.0MJkg−1). However, as the bio-oil concentration increased from 9.1 to 25.0wt%, the TAN of the UHBOs increased from 3.98 to 11.33mg-KOH/g-oil, implying a lower degree of esterification of the acidic species under the methanol-deficient condition."
10,Effect of reaction time,"3.5 Effect of reaction time The effect of the reaction time on the yields of the products and the properties of the upgraded bio-oils treated in scMeOH are shown in Fig. 8 . The concentration of the LBF bio-oil was fixed to 9.1wt% and the reaction temperature was fixed to 400°C. In the figure, a reaction time of 0min indicates that the heating elements were removed immediately and the reactor was rapidly quenched with water once the reaction temperature was attained. The reaction pressure did not change significantly in the range of 34.6–37.7MPa with extension of the reaction period. As the reaction time increased from 0 to 120min, the yields of UHBO decreased from 18.9 to 13.0wt% and those of ULBO decreased from 75.6 to 60.8wt%. The yields of gas and solid residue did not change significantly with the reaction time. The amount of methanol consumed during the upgrading process increased slightly from 21.9 to 26.4wt% as the reaction time increased from 0 to 120min. Therefore, the product yields and methanol consumption during scMeOH upgrading were not strongly dependent on the reaction time. Even though a slightly lower yield of UHBO was produced at the extended reaction times of 60–120min, the produced oil had lower O/C ratios (Fig. 8b) and higher energy contents (HHV>32MJkg−1, Table 2) than those obtained at 0–30min. The decrease in the H2 content in the produced gases (Fig. 8c) and the increase in the water content (Table 2) with increasing reaction time implies a greater extent of hydrodeoxygenation, with removal of oxygen and production of water as the byproduct. As shown in Fig. 8d, a gradual decrease in the area% of the sugar derivatives from 11.5% to 0.4% was observed as the reaction time increased from 0 to 120min. The area% of 1,6-anhydro-á-D-glucopyranose, which is the major sugar derivative present in the LBF bio-oil, decreased with increasing reaction time (Fig. S7). Even at 0min reaction, the TAN declined significantly from 92.2 to 16.2mg-KOH/g-oil with the use of scMeOH because of the esterification ability of scMeOH. In fact, the major chemical species in ULBO was acetic acid methyl ester (Fig. S8), which can be derived from acetic acid in the LBF bio-oil. In addition, ring alkylation was activated to a greater extent at extended reaction time. The aromatic species underwent minimal methylation at 0min (Fig. S7a), whereas at 30min, creosol (13 in Fig. S7b), 2,4,6-trimethyl-phenol, (14), and 2,3,5-trimethyl-1,4-benzenediol (18) appeared. After 120min of reaction, a high degree of ring-methylated species such as 1,4-dimethoxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-benzene (16 in Fig. S7d) and 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-phenol (19) was produced. The ring alkylation in methanol could produce water as a byproduct, which may be one reason for the increase in the water content in the reaction mixture at extended reaction time (Table 2). In addition to the methylation of the aromatic ring, cycloalkane species were methylated in scMeOH at extended reaction time (e.g., 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one was detected; 11 in Fig. S7d)."
11,Energy recovery and energy efficiency,"3.6 Energy recovery and energy efficiency The ER and EE values, estimated using Eqs. (7) and (8), are shown in Fig. 9 . It was difficult to measure the HHVs of the ULBOs because most of the ULBOs recovered by rotary evaporation were dissolved in the methanolic phase. Therefore, to estimate the ER and EE, the HHV of the ULBOs was assumed to be 20.0 or 30.0MJkg−1. The major chemical species in the ULBO produced with the use of the supercritical alcohols were acetic acid alkyl esters (Figs. 4, S4, S6, and S8), the HHVs of which are 19.8MJkg−1 (acetic acid methyl ester), 24.4MJkg−1 (acetic acid ethyl ester), and 27.7MJkg−1 (acetic acid isopropyl ester). In the case of the ULBOs produced in scMeOH, the larger number of carbon atoms and the same number of oxygen atoms as present in the acetic acid alkyl ester implies that the actual HHV of the ULBOs may be higher than those of the acetic acid alkyl esters. As shown in Fig. 9a, as the number of carbons in the alcohols increased in moving from methanol to IPA, the ER and EE decreased. This is mainly because as the carbon number in the alcohols increases, the HHV of the solvent increases (HHVMeOH =19.9MJkg−1, HHVEtOH =28.9MJkg−1, HHVIPA =30.5MJkg−1) and more solvent was consumed (as discussed in Section 3.2). Thus, ( HHV AC × m AC ∗ ) in Eqs. (7) and (8) increased with the use of higher alcohols. Similarly, the increase in the methanol consumption at the high LBF bio-oil concentration is responsible for the decrease in the ER and EE (Fig. 9b). ScMeOH-based upgrading resulted in an ER of 94–131% and EE of 79–109% depending on the HHVs of the ULBO. Therefore, energetically efficient upgrading of LBF bio-oil could be achieved in scMeOH. On the other hand, the ER and EE values were not strongly dependent on the temperature (Fig. 9c); at low reaction temperature, the amount of methanol consumed was smaller, whereas the HHV of the UHBO was lower, as discussed previously in Section 3.3. Thus, the increase in ( HHV AC × m AC ∗ ) was cancelled by the decrease in ( HHV UHBO × m UHBO ) . Lastly, as shown in Fig. 9d, higher values of the ER and EE were obtained at the short reaction time of 0min relative to those at 30–120min. The amounts of methanol consumed at different reaction times were quite similar, whereas the UHBO yield at short reaction time was larger than that obtained at longer reaction time (Section 3.5). Thus, the large ( HHV UHBO × m UHBO ) values in Eqs. (7) and (8) at 0min contributed to increasing the ER and EE."
12,Conclusion,"Low boiling fraction (LBF) bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis was upgraded in supercritical methanol (scMeOH) with variation of the temperature, reaction time, and bio-oil concentration. The upgraded light-fraction bio-oil (ULBO), which was separated from the upgraded heavy-fraction bio-oil (UHBO) during product recovery, and the amount of methanol consumed during the upgrading process were considered in the estimation of the upgraded oil yield and energy efficiency. ScMeOH upgrading at 400°C for 30min resulted in a significant decrease in the total acid number (TAN) of the bio-oil from 92.2 to 4.0mg-KOH/g-oil (through esterification) and an increase in the higher heating value (HHV) from 12.5 to 29.9MJkg−1 (through deoxygenation) with 22.1wt% methanol consumption. This was attributed to the esterification, deoxygenation, and ring alkylation ability of scMeOH. Compared to supercritical ethanol (scEtOH) and supercritical isopropanol (scIPA) upgrading, a smaller amount of alcohol was consumed with the use of supercritical methanol. The increase in the HHV and the larger alcohol consumption during upgrading with alcohols having a higher carbon number make scEtOH and scIPA less energetically efficient upgrading media than scMeOH. The increase in the concentration of LBF bio-oil from 9.1 to 25.0wt% resulted in an increase in the amount of methanol consumed from 22.1 to 39.6wt%, which led to a decrease in the energy recovery (ER) from 94% to 75% and in the energy efficiency (EE) from 79% to 67% under the assumption that the HHV of ULBO was 20.0MJkg−1. Taking into account the low TAN, low alcohol consumption, high energy efficiency, and cheap price, non-catalytic scMeOH upgrading is a very promising route for fast pyrolysis bio-oil upgrading in the absence of external hydrogen."
