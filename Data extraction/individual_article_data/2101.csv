0,Introduction,"With the increasingly strict carbon emissions and the increasing demand for aviation fuel, the traditional petroleum-derived aviation fuel will be more and more difficult to meet the normal requirements of human society in the future [1]. The development of preparation technology for aviation fuel from alternative sources has become particularly important [2,3]. The aldol condensation followed by hydrogenation was a favorable technology to produce liquid alkanes that met the requirements of bio-aviation fuel [4–6]. Biomass was commonly processed through roasting and pyrolysis with catalysts [7–9]. Cyclopentanone was one of the important ketonic products from biomass pyrolysis [10]. Considering its carbonyl group and α-H, cyclopentanone can be a nice choice for the aldol condensation and hydrogenation for aviation fuel [11]. The self-condensation and hydrogenation characteristics of cyclopentanone have been studied in our previous work and a functional Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC catalyst was developed based on above characteristics. However, there were still some issues urged to be solved in this reaction route, such as poor reusability of catalyst and high energy consumption. In related studies, the poor reuse performance of catalysts has already been pointed out by Liang et al. In the condensation and hydrogenation of n-butanone over bifunctional Ni/Ce-Al2O3 catalyst, they found that activity of the catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO group almost lost after the reusability test. Parts of Ni species were covered by a compound composed of Al, O and H formed due to the introduction of water, and the catalytic activity for hydrogenation decreased. The deactivation may be eliminated by surface modification of γ-Al2O3 with SiO2 [12]. Li et al. used two kinds of hydrophobic substances, γ-chloropropyl triethoxysilane and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl triethoxysilane, which were introduced onto the surface of γ-Al2O3 in order to inhibit its hydration [13]. However, the catalytic activity of the modified γ-Al2O3 decreased and the modification process was quite complex. In addition to the modification of the catalyst, the solvents also play a great role on the performance of the catalyst. The organic solvent may be helpful in decreasing the contact between γ-Al2O3 catalysts and water. Keaveney et al. studied the effect of ionic liquid solvent on the condensation reaction of between hexan-1-amine and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde and found that the appropriate ionic solvents can interact with reagents to facilitate condensation reactions [14]. Anderson et al. discussed the hydrogenation process of aromatic acids and other substituted phenols in both aqueous and organic solvents, and discovered that the selectivity was quite different in the two types of solvent, which would lead to very different product distribution [15]. Considering that the necessary element of the production of the compound with Al, O and H was water, the reusability of bifunctional catalyst may be better if the water can be effectively isolated from the catalyst. Adding organic solvent to the reaction system would be necessary and feasible. The polarity of water was the largest in the common solvent. The introduction of organic solvents with different polarity in the reaction system was considered to investigate the performance and reusability of bifunctional catalysts [16]. The aldol condensation‑hydrogenation reaction was mostly performed in two reactors. Due to the inconvenience of transferring materials between two reactors, the above two processes had been integrated in one pot with two steps [17]. The two-step method to prepare aviation fuel included the condensation first followed by hydrogenation. It was necessary to reduce the temperature of the reactor to the safe range for the next hydrogenation step after the condensation reaction [18]. After hydrogen being injected into the reactor, the reactor was reheated to the hydrogenation temperature. But a lot of energy consumption caused by the secondary heating. Morad et al. proposed the one-pot synthesis of 4-(4-methoxyphenyl) butan-2-one from 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and acetone with the help of catalysts and they combined dehydrogenation condensation and hydrogenation reactions in one-pot. However, the reaction gases were changed frequently and the temperature rose and fell repeatedly, which meant complex operations and lots of energy loss [19]. A small number of scholars proposed a more economical and safe method called one step, in which the aldol condensation and the total hydrodeoxygenation of the resulting condensation adducts was performed in one step. In this method, it was considered to inject hydrogen into the reactor before the condensation reaction. However, Faba et al. found that in the high temperature condensation hydrogenation reaction in hydrogen atmosphere, some of the reactants were directly hydrogenated and could not carry out the self-condensation reaction. The occurrence of such side reactions will directly lead to the reduction of the yield of aviation fuel components [20]. Our research group creatively proposed a novel reaction scheme named low-temperature condensation and high-temperature hydrogenation. The hydrogen was introduced into the reactor first and then the reactor was heated to the favorable temperature for the self-condensation of cyclopentanone. For a certain time for aldol condensation, the reactor was heated further to the appropriate hydrogenation temperature. During the condensation reaction, the reactants could not be hydrogenated because of the lower temperature, and the temperature of whole reaction rose from low to high without cooling. The occurrence of side reactions of hydrogenation could be prevented effectively and the energy loss of secondary heating would be saved at the same time. In order to improve the reusability of bifunctional catalyst and the yield of target alkane, three kinds of organic solvents with different polarity were selected in this experiment: n-pentane (polarity: 0), tetrahydrofuran (polarity: 4.2), dimethyl sulfoxide (polarity: 7.2), to investigate whether the reusability of the catalyst can be improved in the presence of solvents. In order to obtain a simple and efficient condensation-hydrogenation reaction system, a one-step low-temperature condensation and high-temperature hydrogenation test procedure was used in the one-pot preparation of aviation fuel."
1,Methods,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals Cyclopentanone, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, n-pentane, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, aluminum chloride hexahydrate, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, nickel nitrate hexahydrate (≥98%), n-pentane, THF and DMSO was purchased from Aladdin Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. Activated carbon made from coconut shell was purchased from Yanshan Activated Carbon Co., Ltd. with the specific surface area of 1200 m2/g and the particle size of 50–80 mesh. In the condensation‑hydrogenation process, n-decane (≥99%) was used as the internal standard and n-pentane (≥99%) as the dilution reagent for product analysis. All chemicals were used directly without purification."
3,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.2 Catalyst preparation and characterization Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC was prepared following the procedures below. Taking magnesium chloride and aluminum chloride with the molar ratio of Mg/Al of 3:1, and they were mixed evenly with quantitative sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate to form a suspension [21–23]. The suspension was added into a beaker filled with 10 g active carbon [24], soaked and stirred it for 2 h, then dried in the oven at 100 °C [25]. Then the solid sample was calcined in the tubular furnace for activation for 2 h with nitrogen as atmosphere at 550 °C. The obtained Mg-Al-O/AC was immersed in nickel nitrate hexahydrate aqueous solution for 12 h, then dried at 100 °C for 10 h. The dried catalyst was reduced with 13% H2/N2 mixture, activated at 550 °C for 2 h [26]. The catalyst was characterized using Philips x'pert professional diffractometer, and the X-ray source was CuKα with the acceleration voltage of 45 kV, current of 40 mA. The x'accelerator detector was used to collect the scanning results."
4,Reaction system and testing procedure,"2.3 Reaction system and testing procedure 2.3.1 Sequential aldol condensation and hydrogenation experiment All reactions were carried out in a 25 mL autoclave reactor with an external temperature and stirring controller. For a typical run, Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctional catalyst (2.4 g) and cyclopentanone (8 mL) were added to the high-pressure reactor [27]. Before the start of reaction, the high-pressure reactor should be confirmed of a good sealing performance. The air in the reactor was driven out by fluxing 3 times. Then the reactor was pressured of 3 MPa with nitrogen and heated to 170 °C [4,28,29]. After 9 h of the condensation reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature, and then purged three times with high-purity hydrogen. Reaching the hydrogen pressure of 4.5 MPa, the hydrogenation experiment proceeded at 260 °C for 12 h [6]. After the experiment, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The samples were centrifuged in a high-speed centrifuge and diluted 100 times by n-pentane. The main components of the products were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) [30]. Before the reuse of catalyst, they were soaked in n-pentane solution for 12 h to remove the residual reaction products on the catalyst surface and in the channel, then dried at 70 °C for 2 h. The catalysts were transferred to the tubular furnace for activation for 2 h. 2.3.2 One-step aldol condensation and hydrogenation experiment Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctional catalyst (2.4 g) and cyclopentanone (8 mL) were added to the high-pressure reactor. It should be confirmed that the high-pressure reactor was well sealed before the start of the reaction. The reactor was purged with high-purity nitrogen three times to replace the air in the reactor, then purge the reactor with high-purity hydrogen three times. The condensation‑hydrogenation experiment was started when the hydrogen pressure reached 4.5 MPa. It proceeded at the reaction temperature of 260 °C and reaction time of 12 h. The reactor was cooled to room temperature when the experiment finished. The samples were centrifuged in a high-speed centrifuge and diluted 100 times by n-pentane. The main components of the products were analyzed by GC/MS. 2.3.3 One-pot low temperature condensation followed by high temperature hydrogenation experiment The bifunctional catalyst (2.4 g) and cyclopentanone (8 mL) were added to the high-pressure reactor. The high-pressure reactor should be well sealed before the reaction. The reactor was purged three times with high-purity nitrogen to replace the air and then purged three times with high-purity hydrogen. The reactor was pressured of 4.5 MPa with hydrogen. The aldol condensation was performed at 170 °C for 6 h. Then, the temperature was raised to 260 °C to continue the hydrogenation experiment for another 6 h [31]. The reactor was cooled to room temperature after the experiment. The samples were centrifuged in a high-speed centrifuge, diluted 100 times by n-pentane. The components of the products were analyzed by GC/MS [32]."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The chemical composition of the liquid product was determined by GC/MS. The mixture was analyzed by GC/MS after diluting n-pentane. The sample was separated by Elite-5 ms capillary column. The oven temperature rose from 25 °C to 250 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min. The conversion of the reactant and the yield of the product mixture were calculated by formulas (1), (2) and (3). If not specified, all conversion and selectivity calculations were based on the carbon moles. In this study, the error bars were determined based on the maximum and minimum values of samples. (1) Conversion = Carbon moles of reagents consumed Carbon moles of reagents input × 100 % (2) Selectivity = Carbon moles of products Carbon moles of reagents consumed × 100 % (3) Yield = Conversion × Selectivity"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Overview of reaction chemistry,"3.1 Overview of reaction chemistry The overview of reaction chemistry of three schemes was shown in Fig. 1 . There are two reactions in the proposed schemes, namely, aldol condensation and hydrogenation. In the aldol condensation, a large number of dimer and trimer were formed [33,34]. Diner and trimer were hydrogenated, with dimer-derived ketone (DDK), dimer-derived alcohol (DDAC), dimer-derived alkene (DDAK), dimeric alkane (DA), trimer-derived alkene (TDAK) and trimeric alkane (TA) formed. Hydroprocessing of dimers and trimers followed different routes, and dimeric alcohols and trimeric alkenes as important intermediates respectively [35,36]. In Fig. 1, the sequential aldol condensation and hydrogenation experiment proceeded in two steps. The first step was the self-condensation of cyclopentanone and the second step was the hydrodeoxygenation of dimer and trimer. In the one-step condensation and hydrogenation experiment, the self-condensation of cyclopentanone, hydrogenation of cyclopentanone and hydrogenation of condensates were supposed to happen simultaneously. Due to the high reaction temperature and existence of hydrogen, part of cyclopentanone was directly hydrogenated to cyclopentanol, resulting in the reduce of the yield of condensates [20]. The energy consumption of the one-step scheme was reduced and the operation was simple, but the final yield of targeted alkane was lower. In the one-pot condensation and hydrogenation experiment, the condensation reaction was performed at low temperature (170 °C), and cyclopentanone was not directly hydrogenated. Compared with the sequential scheme, the cooling of reactor was omitted and the secondary heating with high energy consumption would be avoided. The production of targeted C10 + C15 alkanes in the range of aviation fuel with high yield and low energy consumption were realized."
8,Sequential aldol-condensation and hydrogenation of cyclopentanone,"3.2 Sequential aldol-condensation and hydrogenation of cyclopentanone 3.2.1 Two-step reaction performance with organics as solvent The performance of sequential aldol condensation and hydrogenation reaction in two steps with organic solvent was shown in Fig. 2 . The polarity of water is the largest among all organic and non-polar solvents, and the polarity of various organic solvent is of great differences [37,38]. Three kinds of organic solvent were chosen for the sequential experiment with the ratio between cyclopentanone and solvent ratio of 1:1, including n-pentane, THF, DMSO with polarity of 0, 4.2 and 7.2 respectively. In Fig. 2(a), it performed best with n-pentane as the solvent. The yield of targeted alkanes was 72.8%, which was 8.3% lower than that of solvent-free condition. The concentration of cyclopentanone was diluted by the introduction of solvent, resulting in a decrease in the contact adequacy of cyclopentanone with catalyst, which weakened the hydrodeoxygenation process of intermediate products [28]. The selectivity of hydrogenation intermediate products such as DDAC and TDAK increased significantly, as shown in Fig. 2(b). With the increase of the polarity of the solvent, the yield of targeted alkanes decreased gradually, and it was only 57.6% with DMSO as solvent. Compared with n-pentane and THF, DMSO presents the best mutual solubility with water and the most sufficient contact between water and catalyst. Due to the formation with Al, O and H on the surface of Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC catalyst, the catalytic effect was poor. N-pentane was chosen as the solvent, aiming at improving the reusability of catalyst. The influence of cyclopentanone/solvent volume ratio (Rc/s) on the sequential condensation‑hydrogenation of cyclopentanone was shown in Fig. 3 . In order to protect the catalyst from water to the greatest extent, the use of organic solvent should be as many as possible. However, the concentration of reactant decreased at a higher proportion of solvent, and the contact between reactant and basic and metal sites on the Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctioanl catalyst became less, which will inevitably lead to the lower yield of targeted alkanes. With a lower Rc/s, the conversion of cyclopentanone and the yield of targeted alkanes gradually decreased. At the Rc/s of 1:5, the conversion of cyclopentanone and the yield of target alkane dropped the valley, 83.1% and 39.3%, which was 12.2% and 33.5% less than that with the Rc/s of 1:1 In Fig. 3(b), a large number of intermediate products can be found, which were not hydrodeoxygenated completely, indicating that the contact effect between the intermediate products and the active Ni component of the catalyst was poor at this time [30]. When the Rc/s was lower than 1:2, the conversion of cyclopentanone and the yield of target alkane decreased more obviously. In order to increase the solvent ratio in the reagent mixture to improve the reusability of catalyst by protecting the Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctioanl catalyst from water formed in the aldol condensation and hydrogenation, the Rc/s was determined to be 1:2 to test the reusability of Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC catalyst. 3.2.2 Reusability of catalysts in the two-step sequential reaction The results of reusability of the bifunctional catalyst with n-pentane as solvent was shown in Fig. 4 . The Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctional catalyst performed good after 5 times of reuse with n-pentane as the solvent in the sequential the condensation and hydrogenation [39]. The conversion of cyclopentanone remained above 93%, which could be attributed to the stable structure and good basic site distribution of Mg-Al-O component in bifunctional catalyst. The yield of targeted alkanes presented a slight decrease of 3% compared with that of fresh catalyst with more runs. It remained around 70% in the 5th run with n-pentane as solvent. Under the solvent-free system, the yield of DA and TA decreased from 81.1% to 31.6% in the 5 runs, mainly due to the deactivation of the catalyst after repeated use [40]. Compared with the solvent-free system, the deactivation of the catalyst has been effectively solved by the solvent and the target product yield was improved after the repeatability test. The conversion of cyclopentanone remained stable with n-pentane as solvent, indicating that the condensation reaction was not significantly affected, while the main change maybe the active component Ni for hydrogenation [41,42]. The selectivity of DDAC and TDAK increased significantly, indicated that the hydrogenation performance of the catalyst has declined to a certain extent, which can be attributed to the loss of Ni component in the process of catalyst washing and activation between each reuse [43]. Considering the experimental error, a tiny decrease of the total yield of targeted alkanes was acceptable. In conclusion, a well reusability of the Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC catalysts can be expected with n-pentane as the organic solvent [44]. Fig. 5 showed the XRD characterization of fresh catalyst and catalyst reused for 3 and 5 times. With more runs, the characteristic diffraction peak of boehmite at 43° was slightly weakened, which indicated that contact between water and Mg-Al-O on the catalyst surface can be effectively isolated with the use of n-pentane as solvent. The characteristic diffraction peak at 37.2°, 51.8° and 75.2° became sharper due to the sintering of nickel crystal. The characteristic diffraction peak at 56.4° appeared, mainly caused by the increase of the crystal lattice of Al2O3. The characteristic diffraction peak at 62.7° peak was attributed to NiO. Most of these peaks were the loss of Ni component in the process of catalyst washing and activation and it was verified that the selectivity of DDAC and TDAK increased significantly due to the decrease in hydrogenation performance. The catalytic effect of the bifunctional catalyst remained good. The total yield of targeted alkanes in the 5th run was only 3% lower than that using fresh catalyst. The organic solvent n-pentane was verified to be helpful to improve the reusability of the Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctional catalyst [45]."
9,One-step aldol-condensation/hydrogenation of cyclopentanone,"3.3 One-step aldol-condensation/hydrogenation of cyclopentanone To simply the integrated reaction, the one-step synchronous condensation and hydrogenation for aviation fuel with various solvents, as shown in Fig. 6 . In our previous study, the self-condensation of cyclopentanone was optimized at 170 °C [35]. A higher temperature would not have an adverse effect on the condensation, while the optimal temperature for the hydrogenation of condensates was 260 °C [35]. In the common sequential condensation and hydrogenation to prepare aviation fuel, the high-pressure reactor needs to be cooled to room temperature after the condensation reaction, and then the high-pressure reactor was heated to 260 °C after the introduction of hydrogen, which resulted in a large amount of energy consumption [6,46]. The hydrogen was introduced before the condensation reaction in this test, then the hydrogenation temperature of 260 °C at which both reactions can be well carried out is considered to perform the synchronous condensation‑hydrogenation test in the presence of three organic solvents. Compared with the sequential test, the conversion of cyclopentanone and the yield of targeted alkanes decreased by 8.3% and 8.7% respectively with n-pentane as the solvent. When tetrahydrofuran and dimethylsulfoxide were used as solvents, the conversion of cyclopentanone and the yield of targeted alkane also decreased slightly [28]. Generally, the one-step reaction performed the best in the presence of n-pentane, followed by tetrahydrofuran. A relatively low yield of cyclopentanol was obtained of 15.5% with n-pentane as the solvent. It presented good resistance to the hydrogenation of cyclopentanone as a side reaction, however the side reaction was still inevitable. The solvents with very different polarity were used to separate water from catalyst, and the role remained stable. In Fig. 6(b), the total selectivity of the hydrogenation intermediate like DDK, DDAC and TDAK increased with the solvent of a higher polarity, which can be attributed to the reduction of catalyst hydrogenation capacity due to the decrease of hydrophobic effect. The real-time material tracking results of one-step condensation and hydrogenation for aviation fuel was provided in Fig. 7 . In Fig. 7(a), the yield of cyclopentanol increased continuously to about 15.2%. In this reaction condition, more cyclopentanone had been hydrogenated before the self-condensation happened and the yield of targeted alkanes decreased. In Fig. 7(b), the selectivity of DA and TA in the first 6 h gradually increased, which proved that the reaction had a synchronous condensation‑hydrogenation phenomenon. At a longer reaction time of 8 h, it can be observed that the selectivity of dimer and trimer was almost zero. At this time, the condensates had been partially or completely hydrogenated. Only targeted alkanes and incomplete hydrogenation products existed in the products after 8 h. At 12 h, incomplete hydrogenation products were gradually hydrogenated and the yield of targeted alkanes increased gradually which reached the maximum at 12 h. In Fig. 7(b), an intersection can be found at 6 h between the selectivity of dimer and DA, trimer and TA. The dimer was generated in large quantities at the beginning of the one-step reaction and hydrogenated within the first 6 h gradually, verified by the relative high selectivity of DDK and DDAC. The hydrogenation of dimer seemed to be faster in the later 6 h, and became the dominant reaction step for alkanes [47]."
10,One-pot aldol-condensation/hydrogenation of cyclopentanone,"3.4 One-pot aldol-condensation/hydrogenation of cyclopentanone In the one-step condensation and hydrogenation of cyclopentanone at 260 °C with the introduction of hydrogen first, a mass of cyclopentanone would be directly hydrogenated to cyclopentanol, resulting in the reduction of the yield of targeted alkanes [27,48]. The strategy of one-pot low-temperature condensation and high-temperature hydrogenation was proposed on the premise that the hydrogen was introduced first. Considering the good condensation of cyclopentanone in the first 6 h and fast hydrogenation in the last 6 h, the high-pressure reactor was kept at 170 °C for 6 h in the stage of self-condensation, which was not high enough for hydrogenation reaction, and the hydrogenation of cyclopentanone will not happen even in the presence of hydrogen. Fig. 8 provided the results of one-pot synthesis with low-temperature condensation and high-temperature hydrogenation for aviation fuel. The overall yield of cyclopentanol reduced greatly, only 5.3%, which was nearly 10% lower than that in the one-step reaction. Not many cyclopentanone was left in the condensation stage, and hydrogenated to be cyclopentanol at high temperature. The total yield of targeted alkane was 70.7%, which was boosted by 6.3% than that in the synchronous condensation and hydrogenation. In the one-pot low-temperature condensation and high-temperature hydrogenation test strategy, the direct hydrogenation of cyclopentanone can be avoided in the self-condensation stage, which not only promoted the conversion of cyclopentanone and the yield of targeted alkane, but also reduced the energy consumption of the reaction to a certain extent by two temperature stages without cooling. The real-time tracking results of one-pot synthesis by low-temperature condensation and high-temperature hydrogenation for aviation fuel was shown in Fig. 9 . Cyclopentanol was not detected in the first 6 h of cyclopentanone self-condensation reaction, which also confirmed that direct hydrogenation of cyclopentanone could only be carried out at a higher temperature. After the condensation of cyclopentanone, the temperature of the high-pressure reactor was raised to 260 °C and the reaction temperature was maintained for another 6 h until the end of the hydrogenation reaction. It could be seen from Fig. 9(a) that the yield of cyclopentanol increased gradually and all the noncondensed cyclopentanone in the system was hydrogenated to cyclopentanol after 12 h. In Fig. 9(b), the generation of targeted alkanes was mainly concentrated in the first 4 h after the start of hydrogenation reaction. A decrease of the selectivity of dimer was accompanied by an increase of that of trimer, indicating that the self-condensation of cyclopentanone was a consecutive reaction. The selectivity of the hydrogenation intermediate like DDK, DDAC and TDAK were of similar trends, namely, boosted to a summit at 8 h and then decreased. The product selectivity in the reactor was basically unchanged after 10 h. The reaction time of condensation and hydrogenation were significantly reduced compared with the individual condensation and hydrogenation reaction. It indicated the condensation and hydrogenation performance of Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctional catalyst was significantly improved compared with Mg-Al-O and Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts [26,35]."
11,Conclusion,"The condensation/hydrogenation of cyclopentanone with Ni/Mg-Al-O/AC bifunctional catalysts in one pot has been developed. The organic solvents were added in the reaction system, which improved the reuse performance of catalysts by reducing the contact between the catalysts and water. Screening tests showed n-pentane outperformed THF and DMSO for converting cyclopentanone to targeted alkanes and the appropriate Rc/s was determined to be 1:2. The one-step method was tested, namely, the hydrogen was introduced first and the reactor was heated until the end of reaction. Although it saved a lot of energy, the yield of targeted alkanes was reduced to 64.4%, which was caused by the side reaction of hydrogenation. A new scheme named low-temperature condensation and high-temperature hydrogenation was proposed. In this scheme, the aldol condensation was maintained at 170 °C first, followed by the hydrogenation of the condensation products at 260 °C. Tests showed the conversion of cyclopentanone and total yield of targeted alkane were 94.7% and 70.7% respectively, which was boosted by 10% and 6.3% higher than the previous scheme. In the future work, multiple biomass platform compounds will be conjugated to produce jet fuel in one pot."
