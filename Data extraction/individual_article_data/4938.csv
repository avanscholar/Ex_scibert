0,Introduction,"Electrospinning is a broadly used method for micro- and nanoscale fiber production from an electrically-forced solution/melt of both synthetic and natural polymers (Dan & Younan, 2004). These nanofibers are considered more attractive than other nanostructured materials, due mainly to their high length to diameter ratio and very large surface area per unit mass. Tunable porosity, malleability to conform to a wide variety of sizes and shapes, and being able to control the nanofiber composition to achieve the desired properties and functionality are other benefits of nanofiber formation (Bhardwaj & Kundu, 2010). The diverse properties of nanofibers make them suitable for applications such as filtration (Lubasova et al., 2014), wound dressing (Yang et al., 2017), drug delivery (Mohiti-Asli et al., 2017), cell-growth scaffolds (Min et al., 2004), tissue engineering (Gabriel et al., 2017), sensors (Najarzadekan & Sereshti, 2016), and electrode materials (Kyung-Hye & John, 2016). In tissue engineering, in particular soft tissue regeneration, electrospun nanofibers from biopolymer solutions has attracted interest for preparation of biocompatible 3-D scaffolds due to their resemblance to the structure of native extracellular matrices (ECMs) (Silva et al., 2008). Biopolymers from both carbohydrate (e.g. chitosan (Jalvandi et al., 2017), chitin (Zhang & Rolandi, 2017) and protein (e.g. keratin (Ming He et al., 2017), fibroin (Chouhan et al., 2017), collagen (Law et al., 2017) sources have been considered. Among the protein biopolymers, keratin is, after collagen, the most important biopolymer in animals (McKittrick et al., 2012). Keratin proteins have been widely studied due to intrinsic bioactivity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and natural abundance (Chilakamarry et al., 2021). Chitosan, a carbohydrate biopolymer, is the N-deacetylated product of chitin, which is the second most abundant polysaccharide macromolecule in nature after cellulose (Rijal et al., 2017). Chitosan has also been widely investigated owing to its several properties including but not limited to antimicrobial activity, nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability (Cui et al., 2018). To improve spinnability of both keratin and chitosan, blending with a synthetic polymer is common in electrospinning. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been chosen as the blending polymer for keratin (M. He et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2017) and chitosan (Biranje et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2021) as it is known as one of the suitable synthetic polymers for the biomedical field being water-soluble, non-toxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable (Jia et al., 2007). Since electrospun membranes of PVA/keratin, and PVA/chitosan have been prepared successfully, it is assumed that creation of nanofibrous electrospun scaffold composed of the same materials would be possible, and that such scaffolds will become more important in the biomedical field. To the best of our knowledge there is no published report of such electrospun scaffolds. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan blended in aqueous solutions to produce a series of 3DENS composed of these for biomedical applications such as wound dressing, and template for tissue engineering. The physicochemical properties of the blend solution were assessed by measuring viscosity and conductivity using a rheometer and a conductivity meter. The effects of the weight ratio on morphology and diameter of the fibers were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the electrospun nanofibrous membranes."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Keratin powder (hydrolysed, code: 69430-36-0) was obtained from Qingdao Aurora Chemical Co., Ltd., Shandong, China (Mainland). Chitosan (molecular weight = 503 kDa and degree of deacetylation = 91%) was purchased from Weseta International, Shanghai, China. The average molecular weight of chitosan was measured by a gel permeation chromatography (Agilent PL-GPC 50) equipped with a refractive index (RI) detector. The degree of deacetylation was determined by FT-IR spectroscopy (Brugnerotto et al., 2001). PVA powder (degree of hydrolysis, >99%; Mw = 8.9 × 104 - 9.8 × 104), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and acetic acid (CH3COOH) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, New Zealand. All materials were used without further purification."
3,Preparation of polymer solutions for electrospinning,"2.2 Preparation of polymer solutions for electrospinning To prepare polymer solutions for electrospinning, PVA, keratin, and chitosan were dissolved at different concentrations in the appropriate solvent. PVA solution (10% w/v) was prepared by dissolving PVA powder in distilled water at 80 °C with continuous stirring for 4 h. To prepare 5% (w/v) keratin solution, sulphitolysed keratin powder was dispersed in distilled water and completely dissolved by slowly dropping a 1 M NaOH solution under continuous stirring at 50 °C. Finally, the pH of the solution was adjusted at 9.5 using 0.1 M NaOH. For the preparation of 2% (w/v) chitosan solution first chitosan powders were made into a paste with a small amount of aqueous solution of 2% (v/v) acetic acid and completely dissolved by continuous stirring at 50 °C with the rest of the required 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution. A series of PVA/keratin solutions labelled PK1, PK2, PK3, PK4, and PK5 were prepared with 10% (w/v) PVA: 5% (w/v) keratin weight ratios of 90:10, 80: 20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50, respectively. Each solution mixture was stirred until homogeneous. Similarly, another series of polymer solution containing PVA/chitosan labelled PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, and PC5 was prepared with 10% (w/v) PVA: 2% (w/v) chitosan weight ratios of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50, respectively."
4,Characterization of the polymer solution,"2.3 Characterization of the polymer solution Viscosity of the solutions was measured using a HAAKE RheoStress 1 (Thermo Scientific™, USA) equipped with an MP61 liquid temperature control device at 20 °C with cone-plate geometry (60 mm diameter and 1° angle). The shear rate was linearly increased from 1 to 300 s−1. Conductivity of the solutions was measured with a digital conductivity meter at 20 °C. All measurements were done in triplicate."
5,Fabrication of PVA/keratin/chitosan 3DENS,"2.4 Fabrication of PVA/keratin/chitosan 3DENS An attempt was made to electrospin a tertiary blend of prepared 10% (w/v) PVA, 5% (w/v) keratin, and 2% (w/v) solutions at different weight ratios (Table S1). However, precipitation occurred when the three polymer solutions were brought into contact, possibly due to the acidic and basic nature of the 5% keratin solution and 2% chitosan solution, respectively. Subsequently, PVA/keratin/chitosan 3DENS [Fig. 1 (b and c)] were prepared successfully without mixing three polymer solutions into a single solution. Instead, PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan polymer solutions were loaded separately and electrospun simultaneously using an electrospinning set-up (Biomedical Electrospinning Equipment TL-BM, TONG LI TECH Co Ltd., China) with 4 spinnerets (Fig. 1a). Two spinnerets supplied 10% (w/w) PVA/5% (w/w) keratin solution from syringe 1 and syringe 2 via tubing, and two more spinnerets supplied 10% (w/w) PVA/2% (w/w) chitosan solution from syringe 3 and syringe 4 via tubing. Syringes 1 and 2 were placed on one side of the collector (rotary drum) and syringes 3 and 4 on the opposite side of collector supplying the solutions simultaneously. A plastic syringe connected with a 23-gauge blunt-tipped needle via tubes was used to supply 10 mL of the desired polymer solution. A rotating cylindrical mandrel wrapped with aluminium foil was used as the fiber collector, rotating at 100 rpm with the linear speed of the robotic arms carrying the spinneret at 40 mm/s. The electrospinning process was performed at 16 kV applied voltage with a needle tip-to-collector distance of 10 cm and flow rate of 0.4 mL/h. The PVA/keratin, and PVA/chitosan blend nanofibers were deposited on the rotary mandrel side by side and layer after layer. Scaffolds were made three-dimensional by running the electrospinning for 24 ± 2 h, yielding scaffolds which were 0.5 ± 0.05 mm thick. Five 3DENS were prepared from five different weight ratios of the polymer blend solutions (Table 1). An attempt was made to electrospin a tertiary blend of prepared 10% (w/v) PVA, 5% (w/v) keratin, and 2% (w/v) solutions at different weight ratios (Table S1). However, precipitation occurred when the three polymer solutions were brought into contact, possibly due to the acidic and basic nature of the 5% keratin solution and 2% chitosan solution, respectively. Subsequently, PVA/keratin/chitosan 3DENS [Fig. 1 (b and c)] were prepared successfully without mixing three polymer solutions into a single solution. Instead, PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan polymer solutions were loaded separately and electrospun simultaneously using an electrospinning set-up (Biomedical Electrospinning Equipment TL-BM, TONG LI TECH Co Ltd., China) with 4 spinnerets (Fig. 1a). Two spinnerets supplied 10% (w/w) PVA/5% (w/w) keratin solution from syringe 1 and syringe 2 via tubing, and two more spinnerets supplied 10% (w/w) PVA/2% (w/w) chitosan solution from syringe 3 and syringe 4 via tubing. Syringes 1 and 2 were placed on one side of the collector (rotary drum) and syringes 3 and 4 on the opposite side of collector supplying the solutions simultaneously. A plastic syringe connected with a 23-gauge blunt-tipped needle via tubes was used to supply 10 mL of the desired polymer solution. A rotating cylindrical mandrel wrapped with aluminium foil was used as the fiber collector, rotating at 100 rpm with the linear speed of the robotic arms carrying the spinneret at 40 mm/s. The electrospinning process was performed at 16 kV applied voltage with a needle tip-to-collector distance of 10 cm and flow rate of 0.4 mL/h. The PVA/keratin, and PVA/chitosan blend nanofibers were deposited on the rotary mandrel side by side and layer after layer. Scaffolds were made three-dimensional by running the electrospinning for 24 ± 2 h, yielding scaffolds which were 0.5 ± 0.05 mm thick. Five 3DENS were prepared from five different weight ratios of the polymer blend solutions (Table 1)."
6,Determination of properties of the scaffolds,"2.5 Determination of properties of the scaffolds 2.5.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The morphology including diameter of the electrospun fibers was examined using SEM (JEOL 6700F FE-SEM, JEOL Ltd., Japan). Prior to scanning, all specimens were coated with 5 nm platinum palladium using Emitech K575X Peltier-cooled high-resolution sputter coater (EM Technologies Ltd., Kent, England) fitted with an Emitech 250× carbon coater. Coated samples were viewed at an accelerated voltage of 3.0 kV. Fiber diameter was determined by image analysis using ImageJ software from the SEM micrographs in their original magnification. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (ALPHA FT-IR, Bruker, USA) was used for identification of the functional groups present in scaffolds. Twenty scans for each FTIR spectrum were obtained in ATR mode over the region 400–4000 cm−1 with a 4 cm−1 spectral resolution. The spectra were baseline-corrected and smoothed with a nine-point Savitzky–Golay function. The swelling ratio was measured gravimetrically. A small round sample of the scaffold (diameter 12 mm) was weighed (W a ) and immersed in 20 mL of distilled water at 20 °C for 24 h. The sample was removed from the aqueous medium, excess surface water blotted with lint-free tissue paper, and weighed (W b ). The swelling ratio was calculated using Eq. (1). All measurements were repeated, at least in sextuplet. (1) W a − W b W b × 100 where, W a is the weight of the wet sample, and W b is the initial weight of the dry sample. The porosity of the scaffold was measured gravimetrically by determining the weight difference between the wet and dry samples. A round sample (diameter 12 mm) was kept in distilled water for 3 min to allow the sample to soak water, after which it was removed, the superficial water mopped using lint-free tissue paper, then weighed. It was then dried by water evaporation method in a vacuum oven (THELCO, Precision Scientific, Chicago, Illinois, USA) for 24 h at a temperature of 50–60 °C. The dry sample was weighed and porosity was calculated using Eq. (2). All measurements were completed, at least in sextuplet. (2) Q 0 − Q 1 ρ w × A × h where, Q 0 is the wet sample weight (g), Q 1 is the dry sample weight (g), ρ w is the density of water (0.998 g/cm3), A is the area of 3DENS (cm2) and. h is the thickness of 3DENS (μm). Biodegradation of 3DENS was performed using the weight loss method. At first, round-shaped 3DENS with a diameter of 10 mm were placed in test tubes filled with 10 mL PBS and allowed to degrade for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks with continuous shaking at 200 rpm. The specimen was removed and air-dried for 24 h. Biodegradation was expressed as the percentage of scaffold weight loss calculated using Eq. (3). Five measurements were made for each specimen. (3) Degradation % = W 0 − W t W 0 × 100 whereW 0 is the initial weight of the specimen and W t is the dry weight at time t. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA Q 1000 instrument (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) using a 2–6 mg sample in an aluminium sample pan. The samples were heated at 10 °C/min from a room temperature to 250 °C. The analysis was performed under a dynamic nitrogen atmosphere of 20mL/min. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), the thermal stability and thermal decomposition of the prepared scaffolds were studied using Q50 TGA analyser (TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). Approximately 10 mg samples were heated from 20 to 700 °C at a constant heating rate of 10 °C/min under N2 supply with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. A platinum pan was used for loading the sample in the heating furnace. Tensile properties of the 3DENS were measured by a TA·XT2i texture analyser (Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, UK). At first, the sample was cut into 30 mm × 5 mm and conditioned for 24 h at standard atmospheric conditions (20 °C temperature and 65% RH). The sample was then loaded in the jaw with a distance between grips of 20 mm at 20 °C. The crosshead speed was set to 5 mm min−1 and the test was continued until the 3DENS broke apart."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis Experiments were carried out multiple times (number of observations 6 or 9) or at least in triplicate. Data were summarised in mean, standard deviation (s.d.) and coefficient of variation (CV%). Differences in responses for the variables of interest were identified using ANOVA routines in SPSS Version 22.0.0.0. Significant differences were identified at the p ≤ 0.05 level if not stated otherwise."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Physicochemical properties of the polymer solutions,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the polymer solutions Viscosity and conductivity are two important physicochemical properties of an electrospinning solution, which affect the formation of continuous fibers. These parameters control the morphology and size of the fibers. Fig. 2 (a and b) show the rheological behaviours of the PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan blend solutions, where the viscosities of PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan solutions at different weight ratios were plotted against the shear rate along with neat PVA, keratin, and chitosan solutions. All solutions showed an initial shear thinning characteristic at a low shear rate (<40 s−1), with the subsequent viscosity changing little (Newtonian behaviour) up to 300 s−1. The viscosity curves of the PVA/keratin blend solutions were between those of neat PVA and keratin solutions in the entire range of measured shear rates. A similar response was observed for the PVA/chitosan blend solutions. Neat PVA exhibited the highest viscosity of the three polymer solutions. As expected, viscosities of keratin and chitosan solutions increased with the addition of the viscous PVA solution. Charged ions present in the polymer solution affect the jet formation since charges directly affect the build-up of an electrostatic repulsion force critical to initiate jetting. As shown in Fig. 2 (c), conductivity increased as the amount of keratin and chitosan in the blend solution increased. This observation could be attributed to the presence of many polar groups such as amide and carboxylic groups in keratin, and amide and hydroxyl groups in chitosan. Moreover, NaOH and acetic acid solutions used for dissolving keratin and chitosan, respectively, might also contribute in enhancing the conductivity."
10,Effect of biopolymers weight ratio on fiber diameter,"3.2 Effect of biopolymers weight ratio on fiber diameter The SEM images of 3DENS prepared at different ratios of PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan are displayed in Fig. 3 . The common features were a porous and fibrous structure. The fibers were smooth, beadfree, and randomly oriented for PKC1, PKC2 and PKC3. These observations implied that no obvious phase separation occurred among PVA, keratin, and chitosan during the electrospinning process, supporting the conclusion that the three phases were compatible. It may be noted that three polymer solutions were not blended at solution phase directly but these polymers came into contact while their jets were transforming to solid phase and got entangled at fiber state. However, the addition of different proportions of keratin and chitosan led to changes in the surface morphologies of the fibers. With the increase of keratin and chitosan, the scaffolds showed belt-like morphologies and reduced interfiber space. When the ratio of keratin and chitosan in the blend solution was equal to or more than 40 wt% (PKC4), large beads were observed. Therefore, it can be assumed that the PKC3 was perhaps the most ideal scaffold of this study. Similar observations are reported in literature; the failure to construct fibrous structures by electrospinning keratin/fibroin blend solutions when the keratin content exceeded 35% (Yen et al., 2016), and in the case of keratin/PVA blend solutions, when keratin content exceeded 40% (Ming He et al., 2017). Increasing the concentration of keratin and chitosan in the solution (in other words, decreasing the concentration of PVA in the solution) yields higher conductivity which, in turn, increases the charge density on the surface of the ejected jet, leading to bead formation. Increasing chitosan has also been reported as leading to bead formation (Abdelgawad et al., 2017). The diameter of the fibers and their distribution were analysed and these are shown with the corresponding SEM images (Fig. 3). The scaffold with minimum keratin and chitosan wt% (PKC1) presented the highest fiber average diameter (151 nm) among those tested. With the addition of keratin and chitosan to the spinning solutions, a general trend of decreased average fiber diameter and narrow distribution were observed. Fiber diameter obtained in PKC1 to PKC3 are spread over a range of 130 nm whereas those in PKC 4 and PKC5 are distributed over a narrow range of 120 nm. The viscosity of the solutions decreased with the incorporation of keratin and chitosan, thus the interactions and entanglements between molecular chains were weakened. Furthermore, the conductivity increased as the ratio of keratin and chitosan to PVA increased. As a consequence, the jets generated by the blend solutions during the electrospinning process became less resistant to the stretching repulsive forces from the charge, resulting in a decrease in the diameter of the composite fibers."
11,FT-IR analysis,"3.3 FT-IR analysis The molecular interactions among keratin, chitosan and PVA were investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4 , the neat PVA exhibited peaks from the secondary hydroxyl group, including OH stretching vibration from the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds at 3550–3200 cm−1, OH deformation vibration at 1422 cm−1, and CO stretching vibration at 1142 cm−1 (Bhattacharjee et al., 2015; Li & Yang, 2014). Keratin shows characteristic adsorption bands related to peptide bonds (CONH). The amide A band (centred at 3280 cm−1) is related to the stretching vibration of NH bonds, the amide I band occurring at 1643 cm−1 is connected mainly with the stretching vibration of the CO groups, the amide II (1529 cm−1) is correlated to the NH bending and CH stretching vibrations. Keratin also shows two intense peaks at 1191 cm−1 and 1022 cm−1 indicating the SO symmetric stretching vibration of cysteine-S-sulfonate residue (Annalisa Aluigi et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2015). In the IR spectra of chitosan the peaks at 3346 cm−1 (NH stretching), 2915 and 2866 cm−1 (CH stretching), 1650 cm−1 (amide II band NH stretching), 1420 cm−1 (asymmetrical CH bending of the CH2 group) and 1059 cm−1 and 1023 cm−1 (O- bridge stretching) represent the glucosamine residue (Biranje et al., 2017). When keratin and chitosan were added into the spinning system, spectra of the resultant composite nanofibers exhibited new absorption peaks of amide I and amide II, which were located at 1651 and 1548 cm−1, respectively. The amide II band confirmed the introduction of keratin inside the composite nanofibers. The amide I band confirmed the presence of keratin and/or chitosan in the composite scaffolds. The wavenumbers of amide I and amide II shifted to a higher wavenumber and the intensities gradually increased as the proportion of keratin and chitosan increased. Another new peak at 1260 cm−1 in the scaffold spectra may confirm the introduction of chitosan. In the case of the addition of PVA, the absorption peak of chitosan at 3346 cm−1 shifted to a lower wave number and the amide A band of keratin centred at 3280 cm−1 became much broader. These results strongly indicated that the main interaction between PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan in the fibers would be through the formation of hydrogen bonds (Choi et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2007)."
12,Swelling ratio (SR%),"3.4 Swelling ratio (SR%) Fig. 5 (a) shows differences in the swelling behaviour among the scaffolds, where the water uptake ability of 3DENSs were higher when compared to PVA. However, all scaffolds swelled over 100%, in other words, all scaffolds had the capacity to retain more water than their own weight. This effect was increased with increases in the keratin and chitosan content. The swelling of the pure PVA was approximately 120%, which increased to approximately 270% when the content of keratin and chitosan reached 50% in the blend. Statistical analysis of the swelling ratio tests showed that the percentage of swelling ratio obtained from all prepared 3DENSs was significantly higher compared to the control. To understand the porosity changes among the 3DENSs, post hoc analysis was also carried out. Tukey's groupings showed that there is significant difference among the porosity values of the scaffolds. The increase of swelling ratio of the 3DENS can be explained by hydrophilicity of keratin and chitosan due to the presence of polar groups in their chemical structure such as –OH and –NH2. The addition of hydrophilic keratin and chitosan increases the hydrophilicity of the PVA/keratin/chitosan scaffolds, hence the swelling behaviour of these exceeds that of the PVA scaffold. This observation is in agreement with other investigators such as Liu et al. (2014), Biranje et al. (2017), Charernsriwilaiwat et al. (2014), Murthy et al. (2017) who found that the swelling ratio of PVA/chitosan nanofibers was higher than that of neat PVA nanofibers and increased with chitosan content. No reference was identified in the published literature regarding the swelling behaviour of PVA/keratin electrospun structures and the effect of keratin in the blend. Therefore, to understand the contribution of individual biopolymer in the increase of SR% of the composite 3DENS, the swelling ratio of the PVA/keratin and PVA/chitosan blend scaffolds were also measured following the same procedure and equation. Fig. 5(b) demonstrates that keratin played a lead role compared to chitosan in increasing the swelling ability of the 3DENS. In the PVA/keratin blend scaffolds, the highest SR% achieved was 341% for PK5, which was about 90% more than that of its counterpart i.e. PC5. It is interesting to note that all three keratin and chitosan blends showed higher and lower SR%, respectively, compared to the corresponding 3DENSs. However, for any blend sample, the SR% value was always higher than that of neat PVA nanofibers. As a consequence, the SR% values for 3DENSs laid in between the values obtained for keratin and chitosan blends."
13,Porosity,"3.5 Porosity Porosity is an important parameter to evaluate the utility of the fibrous materials for biomedical applications. The 3DENSs exhibited a mean porosity in the range of 82% to 86% with an s.d. and CV of <2.5% and <3%, respectively. In general, the mean porosity was increased with an increase in the content of keratin and chitosan (Fig. 6 ). Porosity of the neat PVA electrospun mat from 10% PVA solution was low (76.04%) than that of 3DENS. Statistical analysis of the porosity tests showed that the percentage of porosity obtained from all prepared 3DENSs was significantly higher than that of the control. To understand the porosity changes among the 3DENSs post hoc analysis was also carried out. Tukey's groupings showed that there is no significant difference among the porosity values of 3DENS. Introduction of biopolymers in the PVA polymer matrix system significantly enhanced the porosity of the 3DENS showing the potentiality in the biomedical application. This can be explained by the diameter reduction of the nanofiber. 3DENSs containing biopolymers were composed of nanofibers with less diameter, which created more void spaces in the structures leading to more porous constructs. According to Tukey's groupings, porosity percentage did not increase statistically significantly (p ≤ 0.01) with the increase in weight ratio of biopolymers nevertheless nanofiber was finer at higher biopolymer contents. The reason may be the formation of beads in the nanofibers of 3DENSs prepared with higher weight ratio of biopolymers such as PKC3, PKC4 and PKC5. Beaded fiber took the void spaces, which were created due to the reduction of fiber diameter. As a result, porosity of the all 3DENSs were in a close range."
14,In vitro degradation,"3.6 In vitro degradation A great deal of degradation (more than 50%–66%) took place after 1 day of incubation indicating the bulk material was highly biodegradable (Fig. 7 ). After four weeks of incubation, the rates of degradation for all scaffolds significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased such as degradation rate of PKC1 reached to (81.34 ± 1.84) % from (69.95 ± 1.63) %, and PKC5 reached to (66 ± 2.21) % from (54.56 ± 1.92) %. With the increase of keratin and chitosan content in the 3DENS the rate of degradation decreased. Addition of natural polymer with PVA in the electrospun fiber reduced the degradation probably due to the enhanced interaction among keratin, chitosan and PVA. This not only confirmed the slow degradation but also reflected the stability of 3DENS (Costa-Pinto et al., 2014). A similar effect of biopolymer addition (chitosan) with PVA in electrospinning was reported by Murthy et al. (2017). The gradual degradation of the scaffold than the PVA matrix might be beneficial for tissue engineering especially if the scaffold is for drug delivery. All 3DENS including the control (PVA matrix) degraded at significantly different rates (%) (p ≤ 0.05) for all testing time-points, indicating incorporation of biopolymers had a significant effect on biodegradability at all 5 weight ratios (%)."
15,DSC analysis,"3.7 DSC analysis Fibers could not be electrospun from the chitosan alone in aqueous acetic acid or from keratin alone in aqueous solution. Therefore, DSC thermographs were obtained from chitosan and keratin powders, respectively, and are shown along with 3DENS in Fig. 8 (a). The related peak temperatures and enthalpy values (ΔHm) are listed in the Table 2 . The DSC thermogram of pure chitosan powder indicated one endothermic transition at 102.69 °C which could be attributed to moisture present in samples or the presence of acetic acid moieties (Jalvandi et al., 2017; Jindal et al., 2013). Endothermic peaks related to moisture evaporation were observed in PVA and keratin also at 110.09 °C and 99.79 °C, respectively. The endothermic peaks connected to moisture evaporation for the 3DENS were in the temperature range 62 °C to 90 °C. The temperature drops in case of moisture evaporation might indicate that water molecules are more loosely held in the electrospun constructs compared to the neat state of their forming polymers. The endothermic peaks observed at about 220 °C for all the 3DENS were attributed to the crystalline melting (Tm) of the nanofibers, and the peak area represented the crystallinity of the nanofibers (Nakano et al., 2007). The DSC thermogram of PVA fibers electrospun from 10% aqueous solution showed a melting endotherm at 226.77 °C. The crystalline melting endotherm was obtained at 232.10 °C for keratin whereas chitosan did not show any crystalline melting endotherm. The 3DENS showed reduced melting behaviour compared to both keratin and PVA component. The peak temperature reduction showed a general trend with the increase of the biopolymers weight ratio in the formulation. A reduction of approximately 7 °C was noticed for the maximum (50 w%) weight ratio of keratin and chitosan compared to the peak value obtained for neat PVA. The shifting of the peak related to the protein denaturation to lower temperature in the 3DENS might arise from a molecular conformation caused by weaker hydrogen bonds resulting less thermal stability (Park et al., 2015). Much lower melting enthalpies were obtained for the 3DENS. Reduction of melting enthalpy (5.46% and 33.76%) were recorded for the incorporation of 10% and 50% biopolymers, respectively. Other researchers had similar observations when PVA was blended with keratin (Ming He et al., 2017) and chitosan (Lei & Hsieh, 2006). This result suggested that the crystallinity of the nanofibers reduced upon the incorporation of keratin and chitosan. The presence of PVA melting in the 3DENS, though much reduced, indicated that PVA could still crystallize, indicative of phase separation from the keratin and chitosan domains in the fibers (Jia et al., 2007)."
16,TGA analysis,"3.8 TGA analysis The thermal decomposition curves of PVA, chitosan, keratin, and 3DENS are shown in Fig. 8(b). Two weight losses were observed in the TGA and weight losses (%) are listed along with the residual weight (%) in Table 2. For all samples, the first stage started slowly with the evolution of water and became faster above 240 °C showing weight loss of 66%–98%. The first stage occurred between 50 °C and 180 °C with the weight loss of about 2–3% in all samples, attributed to the evaporation of water associated with the polymers. In the case of PVA, the initial weight loss corresponding to moisture vaporization took place below 121 °C. The weight loss in keratin and chitosan observed below 156 °C and 182 °C respectively is due to the release of hydrogen bonded water. The second weight loss of all samples took place around 239–435 °C due to thermal degradation of polymers (Abdelgawad et al., 2017; A. Aluigi et al., 2007). About 66% of this (around 272 °C- 316 °C) temperature is attributed to dehydration of saccharide rings and the depolymerisation and decomposition of the chitosan (Valderruten et al., 2014). A 97% weight loss in PVA in the temperature range of 264 °C to 414 °C is corresponded to the chain stripping produced by the removal of water molecules followed by chain scission and decomposition (Biranje et al., 2017). Chitosan exhibited higher onset temperature (the degradation start temperature) and higher weight residue of thermal degradation than PVA. The second weight loss of around 77% caused by the decomposition of keratin molecules took place in the temperature range from 246 to 367 °C. Like chitosan, keratin also showed higher residue compared to PVA. The TGA curves of the blend nanofibers were located between those of chitosan, keratin and PVA. As a result, weight losses of the 3DENS after degradation are higher than the keratin and chitosan but lower than PVA. Above 600 °C temperature, the TGA curves of 3DENS became flat which indicates that the composite nanofibers have completely burned and there is no or small amounts of unburned inorganic elements. This may be due to the influence of the presence of PVA, which also gave a flat curve indicating 100% degradation in the tested temperature range. However, weight residue of thermal degradation of 3DENS increased with increasing keratin and chitosan content. A closer examination of Fig. 8 reveals that all 3DENS have only one onset suggesting that interaction may exist between the three components in each blend due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the functional –OH and –NH2 groups in chitosan and keratin, and –OH groups in PVA (Biranje et al., 2017)."
17,Tensile properties,"3.9 Tensile properties Tensile test results are plotted as stress-strain curve and shown in Fig. 9 . Incorporation of biopolymers in the 3DENS clearly improved the tensile strength. Tensile strength was doubled when the amount of biopolymers were increased from 10 wt% to 50 wt%. Enhanced strength was possibly related to the favorable compatibility and strong interactions among PVA, keratin and chitosan. These results were well aligned with FTIR analysis, which indicated interaction among them through hydrogen bonding. However, higher amount of biopolymers in 3DENS lowered the extensibility. Similar observation was reported by He et al. (2017)."
18,Conclusion,"Nanofibrous scaffolds comprised of keratin (5% w/v) and chitosan (2% w/v) at different wt% ratios were electrospun with the help of PVA (10% w/v) using layer by layer electrospinning technique in a dual spinneret setup. Faults in terms of beads were prominent with the increased amount of both keratin and chitosan. FT-IR spectra and TGA analysis suggested possible interactions between both keratin and chitosan with PVA through hydrogen bonds. Desirable properties for biomedical applications such as tensile strength, biodegradation, swelling ratio, and porosity of 3DENS were enhanced with the introduction of biopolymers in PVA. However, attention should be given to manufacturing a nanostructured scaffold with an increased amount of keratin and chitosan in the scaffold, without deterioration of the nanofiber morphology.
