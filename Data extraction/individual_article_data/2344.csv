0,Introduction,"In recent years, development of clean energy and reuse of renewable resources have drawn great attention due to increasing global concerns on energy shortage and environment deterioration. Hydrogen is being intensively investigated as a new energy carrier that could store and transport energy from renewable energy resources (e.g. solar, wind, and organic pollutants) to the point of use (Kudo and Miseki, 2009; Esswein and Nocera, 2007). Ever since the electrochemical photolysis of water on a TiO2 electrode was first discovered by Fujishima and Honda, great progress has been achieved in light-driven hydrogen production by photocatalysis or photoelectrochemical reaction (Fujishima and Honda, 1972; Walter et al., 2010). Photocatalytic reaction starts with the generation of holes (h+) in valence band (VB) and electrons (e−) in conduction band (CB). The photocatalytic production of hydrogen requires the transfer of two CB electrons and anoxic condition because oxygen preferentially scavenges CB electrons to suppress the reduction of protons [reaction (1)]: (1) 2 H + + 2 e CB − → H 2 For high-rate hydrogen production in a photocatalytic system, an excess amount of electron donors (e.g., organic acids, alcohols, sulfide/sulfite) is normally required. Recently, some organic pollutants (i.e. phenolic compounds, dyes, organic acids, and urea/urine) were successfully used as electron donors for H2 production (Kim and Choi, 2010; Daskalaki et al., 2010). However, light-driven hydrogen production from wastewater through photocatalysis still faces many challenges for practical application, such as (1) anoxic condition is necessary for photocatalytic hydrogen generation (Kim et al., 2012), (2) most organic pollutants in wastewater usually cannot be directly utilized as electron donors (Pirkanniemi and Sillanpää, 2002), (3) the co-existing pollutants in wastewater may suppress the reduction of protons, and even cause the failure of hydrogen production (Ni et al., 2007), (4) methodologies for scale-up of laboratory scale studies to plant-scale remain incomplete (Li Puma et al., 2007; Jing et al., 2010), and (5) photocatalytic reactors are still designed using empirical or semi-empirical methods without explicit consideration of photon absorption and scattering in the reactor (Colina-Márquez et al., 2010; Prieto-Rodriguez et al., 2012). Wastewater reclamation from municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) has been considered as one of the most important approach for resources reuse around the world (Zhang et al., 2011). Reusable wastewater should be free of any toxic pollutants which escape from conventional wastewater treatment. Unfortunately, in most countries, including China, the only standard for determining organic pollution in reclaimed wastewater is the chemical oxygen demand. Micropollutants are ignored, potentially threatening water utility customers during wastewater reuse. Among the micropollutants, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are causing particular concern due to their detrimental effects on endocrine systems in wild species, affecting their growth, physiology and reproduction (Kim et al., 2007; Joss et al., 2004). European Commission set the concentration causing endocrine disrupting effects as 1 ng/L, indicating that the substances with estradiol equivalency (EEQ) larger than 1 ng/L would affect the endocrine systems of aquatic organisms in the receiving water (European Commission, 1996). The effects could be measured as a result of estrogenic activity (EA), as has been used in many studies (Kim et al., 2007; Joss et al., 2004). The application of photocatalytic oxidation for degradation of EDCs has been found to be a technically viable process. In particular, TiO2-based photocatalysts have demonstrated excellent performances for removing kinds of EDCs [such as estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), nonylphenol (NP), and bisphenol A (BPA)] and their estrogenic activities from secondary effluents of MWTPs (Gupta and Ali, 2008; Zhang et al., 2012a, b; Li Puma et al., 2010; Mueses et al., 2012; Prieto-Rodriguez et al., 2012). The general stoichiometry of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution can be represented by reaction (2): (2) C x H y O z + ( x + 0.25 y − 0.5 z ) O 2 → photocatalysis aerobic Intermediate products → photocatalysis aerobic xCO 2 + 0.5 yH 2 O Unfortunately, the mineralization of organic pollutants in secondary effluents through photocatalysis is not easily achieved because photocatalytic oxidation preferentially degrade large molecular weight (MW) organic compounds into small MW organic compounds and only parts of small MW organic compounds could be mineralized into CO2 and H2O. On the other hand, the partial mineralization of organic pollutants is helpful for stripping hydrogen out of organic pollutants because the generated small MW organic compounds seem easier to be used as electron donors than their parent compounds (Zhang et al., 2012b). If the aerobic photocatalytic generated compounds could be directly used in the following anoxic photocatalytic hydrogen production process, it could be possible to produce hydrogen from the degradation of organic pollutants during advanced wastewater treatment [reaction (3)]. (3) C x H y O z + ( x + 0.25 y − 0.5 z ) O 2 → aerobic photocatalysis DO consuming process Intermediate products → anaerobic photocatalysis DO consumed process xCO 2 + ( 0.25 y + 0.5 z − x ) H 2 O + ( x + 0.25 y − 0.5 z ) H 2 3Such an ideal hypothesis has been verified in our last published research (Zhang et al., 2013). It was firstly reported that simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen production and EA removal from secondary effluent were successfully achieved using TiO2 microspheres modified with both platinum nanoparticles and phosphates (P-TiO2/Pt) (Zhang et al., 2013). However, there are different types of dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions in secondary effluent, including soluble microbial products, humic/fulvic-like compounds, aromatic protein, HPO 4 2 − , NO 3 − , HCO 3 − , and so on (Zhang et al., 2012b). These co-existing wastewater constituents could possibly participate in the photocatalytic redox reaction. The mechanisms of simultaneous hydrogen production and EA removal from secondary effluent are more complex than that described in reaction (3). The interactions amongst secondary effluent's organic, inorganic constituents and dissolved oxygen during the photocatalytic process are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of simultaneous hydrogen production and EA removal from secondary effluent by evaluating the effects of secondary effluent constituents (initial DO, EfOM, and inorganic ions) on the photocatalytic process."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Methanol, alcohol, nonanoic, tetra-n-butyl titanate, chloroplatinic acid, 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), Benzoquinone (BQ), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and phosphoric acid were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. All reagents used for chromatographic analyses were of HPLC grade. Analytical standards for chromatography analyses were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Milli-Q water from a Milli-Q purification unit was used in the following experiments."
3,Water samples,"2.2 Water samples Secondary effluents used in this study were taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Nanjing, China), in which the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process was used as a secondary treatment. The effluent characteristics are summarized in Table S1. The secondary effluent organic matter was isolated into hydrophobic acids (HOA), hydrophobic bases (HOB), hydrophobic neutrals (HON), and hydrophilic substances (HIS) fractions using the method described in Supporting Information. Simulated wastewater was prepared by dissolving all the isolated fractions in 5 L MilliQ water. The salts HPO 4 2 − , HCO 3 − , and NO 3 − were separately added to the above-mentioned simulated wastewater. The concentrations of inorganic ions varied from 0 to 1 mmol/L."
4,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments The apparatus employed in photocatalytic experiments has been described in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2013). The light source (Oriel, model 66021) used in the experiments was furnished with a solar-light simulating Xe-arc lamp (Osram XBO 450 W), a set of lenses for light collection and focusing, and a water filter mounted on the lamp housing to eliminate infrared radiation. A cutoff filter (Oriel, 51472) was placed after the water filter to completely remove the UV portion of the radiation (<400 nm) and to ensure that photocatalysis is achieved by visible light wavelengths only. The lamp emits radiation in the 400–750 nm range with a peak at 470 nm (Figure S1). The lamp power was kept constant at 450 W and the photocatalytic reactor was placed at a fixed distance from the lamp housing (80 cm). The power of the incident radiation at the reactor wall measured using a radiant power/energy meter (Oriel 70260) equipped with a thermopile detector probe and was found to be 156 mW. The intensity of illumination entering the reactor, expressed in einsteins/s, was determined by a photometric method, employing a K3Fe(C2O4)3 solution as a chemical actinometer (Sun and Bolton, 1996), and was found to be 4.6 × 10−7 E/s. The details of the photocatalytic reactor dimensions and lamp specifications were shown in Table S2. The photocatalysts used in the experiments were P-TiO2/Pt microspheres, same as those reported in our previous research (Zhang et al., 2013). The specific mass scattering absorption and absorption coefficients of P-TiO2/Pt microspheres suspension averaged over wavelength range 400 nm and 700 nm were estimated to be 935.7 and 178.3 m2 kg-1 (Li Puma, 2003; Li Puma and Yue, 1998). The scattering albedo ω was 0.84. According to the results of photocatalyst concentration optimization experiment (Figure S2), the concentration of photocatalyst used in the following experiments was determined to be 0.5 g/L, which was also the optimum loading with maximal volumetric rate of photon absorption (VRPA) for photocatalyst with scattering albedo 0.84 (Colina-Márquez et al., 2010). According to their pioneering studies (Li Puma, 2003; Colina-Márquez et al., 2010), the VRPA and the optical thickness were estimated to be 0.123 mW and 14.6. Therefore, approximate 86% of photons entering the reactor were adsorbed by catalyst particles. The optical thickness was within the optimal range for optimal radiation absorption (Colina-Márquez et al., 2010). The procedures of photocatalytic experiments were shown as follows: the suspension in pre-aeration tank was sealed and stirred continuously. Then it was transferred to Pyrex photocatalytic reactor, which was also sealed and subsequently occupied fully by the pumped suspension. The suspension in the photocatalytic reactor was stirred vigorously during the experiments. After 40 min of stir, photoirradiation was carried out. The solution was sampled for analysis from the reactor cell using a glass syringe at specified time intervals during photocatalytic process. The sampling volume is 500 mL. After each sampling, the same amount of treated wastewater sample from a parallel running apparatus was injected in the sealed photocatalytic reactor."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The amount of total gas produced was determined by water displacement method using sulfuric acid (2%) and NaCl (10%) containing solution. The amount of collected hydrogen was measured by using a gas chromatograph (HP Agilent 6890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve 5A column. To determine the EA in secondary effluents, solid phase extraction method was applied to concentrate the compounds from the wastewater sample using Oasis HLB resin cartridges (Waters Corporation, America). The EA of the concentrated samples was evaluated with a two-hybrid assay based on yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190) containing the rat estrogen receptor ERα and the coactivator TIF2 (Zhang et al., 2012a, b). The fluorescence spectra of wastewater samples were determined using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy as described in our previous publication (Zhang et al., 2012b). Total organic carbon (TOC) concentration was analyzed by Aurora 1030W OI Analytical TOC analyzer (OI Analytical, USA). The absorbance at 254 nm was determined using a Cary 300 UV–visible spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., USA) and a 1 cm quartz cell. The behavior of DO during the photocatalytic process was monitored with electrode for DO sensor (UC-12-SOL, Central Kagaku Co.), which was connected to a computer. The method of detected aldehydes and carboxylic acids in the photocatalytic treated secondary effluent and HIS fraction were shown in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2013). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were detected using a Bruker EMX-10/12 EPR spectrometer. The settings for the EPR spectrometer were center field, 3480.0 G; sweep width, 200.0 G, microwave frequency, 9.751 GHz; and power, 19.873 mW. The light source for EPR determination was a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of initial DO on simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen production and EA removal,"3.1 Effect of initial DO on simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen production and EA removal Results of simultaneous hydrogen production and EA removal from secondary effluents through photolysis (simulated solar) and P-TiO2/Pt microspheres photocatalysis in sealed systems with initial DO at 0 and 6.5 mg/L were shown in Fig. 1 . In the de-aerated system (initial DO = 0 mg/L), the photocatalytic production of hydrogen continued for up to 300 min with apparent photonic efficiency (APE, 2 × (hydrogen molecules)/(number of incident photons)) of 2.58 × 10−3, whereas the production of hydrogen was negligible during photolysis. Only 30.2% and 5.8% of EA were removed through photocatalysis and photolysis in the system, respectively. In the DO-decreasing system (initial DO = 6.5 mg/L), DO was completely consumed in 100 min and then the photocatalytic production of hydrogen started with the APE of 3.25 × 10−3. The hydrogen production was negligible during photolysis. The EA was almost totally removed in 200 min during photocatalytic process. Comparatively, only 10% reduction occurred within 200 min through photolysis. Since oxygen reacts slowly with the electrons compared with the reaction between holes and hydroxyl or water species, the rate of electron transfer from TiO2 to oxygen is usually considered as the rate-controlling process during photocatalytic oxidation (Almquist and Biswas, 2001). The higher initial DO concentration of secondary effluent was, the faster photocatalytic oxidation reactions took place. Therefore, the EA removal rate was higher in the DO-decreasing photocatalytic system than that in the de-aerated system. For hydrogen production, according to the results previously reported, it was anticipated that APE should be higher in the de-aerated system than that in the DO-decreasing system, since the oxygen would trap and remove the generated electrons from TiO2 surface, resulting in the failure of protons reduction. However, it is interesting to note that the photocatalytic hydrogen production was marked enhanced in the DO-decreasing photocatalytic system than that in the de-aeratede system. In the DO-decreasing system, photocatalytic process was carried out through two steps [as shown in reaction (3)]. The first step was the DO consuming (aerobic) phase with EfOM decomposition. The aromatic, hydrophobic, and high MW fractions of EfOM (e.g. aromatic proteins and fulvic-/humic-like compounds) were preferentially transformed into non-humic, hydrophilic, and low MW fractions (Zhang et al., 2013). The generated compounds have been identified as molecules enriched with carbonyl and carboxylic functionalities (e.g. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetate, and formate), which have negative standard redox potentials and could exactly serve as precursors for hydrogen (Ni et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012). The following step was the DO consumed (anoxic) phase with hydrogen production. The generated hydrogen precursors significantly enhanced the production of hydrogen. Such a photocatalytic wastewater treatment process may be similarly compared with the biologic wastewater treatment that consists of sequential anaerobic acidification and methane production."
8,Contributions of EfOM on photocatalytic hydrogen production and EA removal,"3.2 Contributions of EfOM on photocatalytic hydrogen production and EA removal To discover the EfOM response for the improved hydrogen production, the secondary effluent sample was isolated into four fractions (i.e. HOA, HOB, HON, and HIS), and thereafter the changes of DOC of these fractions in the de-aerated and DO-decreasing photocatalytic systems were evaluated (Table S3). It was found that the HIS fraction was the most abundant, constituting about 64.5% of DOC. HOA were the second most dominant fraction, accounting for about 19.4% of DOC. In the de-aerated photocatalytic system, the mineralization of EfOM was insignificant and only 15.1% of DOC was reduced. The DOC reduction in HOA fraction was 0.7 mg/L, accounting for 50% of that in secondary effluent, while the DOC reduction in HIS fraction could be ignored. In the DO-decreasing system, 49.5% of DOC was reduced within 300 min. The DOC reduction in HIS fraction was 3.51 mg/L, accounting for 76.3% of that in secondary effluent. Therefore, it could be deduced that the HIS may be the EfOM, which was decomposed in aerobic photocatalytic phase and responsible for the improved hydrogen production in the following anoxic photocatalytic phase. In order to confirm the conjecture, simultaneous hydrogen production and EA removal from these fractions in the de-aerated and DO-decreasing photocatalytic systems were investigated (Fig. 2 ). In the de-aerobic photocatalytic system, the contributions of these fractions on hydrogen production are in the following order: HOA > HON > HOB > HIS, and the contributions on EA removal are in the order of HOA > HON > HOB > HIS. It could be found that the hydrogen production and EA removal in the de-aerobic photocatalytic system were accompanied by the decomposition of HOA, HON, and HOB fractions. The decomposition of HOA, HOB, and HON fraction was only responsible for 30.2% of EA reduction in secondary effluent. In the DO-decreasing photocatalytic system, the contributions of these fractions on hydrogen production are in the following order: HIS > HOA > HON > HOB. Compared with that in the de-aerated system, it could be clearly seen that HIS fraction was photocatalytically decomposed and turned into the main component for hydrogen production. Changes of DOC, UV254, and SUVA of HIS fraction in DO-decreasing photocatalytic system were evaluated (as shown in Figure S3). The reduction of SUVA value indicated that the aromatic and high MW constituents were transformed into non-humic and low MW constituents. Similar results were also found from fluorescence analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table S4, HIS fraction mainly consists of soluble microbial byproduct-like and humic/fulvic acid-like substances. The aromatic, humic/fulvic-like compounds in HIS fraction were preferentially degraded during aerobic photocatalytic process. The blue-shift of maximum Ex/Em wavelength indicates the decomposition of condensed aromatic moieties to smaller molecules and a reduction in the π-electron system, such as a decrease in the number of aromatic rings or conjugated structures in a chain structure, or the conversion of a linear ring system to a non-linear ring system (Swietlik and Sikorska, 2004). Moreover, the generated compounds from HIS decomposition in the aerobic photocatalytic phase also have been identified as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetate, and formate, consistent with those detected in secondary effluent sample during aerobic photocatalytic phase in the DO-decreasing system. The contributions of these fractions on EA removal are in the order of HOA > HOB > HON > HIS, similar to that in the de-aerobic photocatalytic system. However, it could be found that the decomposition of HOA, HOB, and HON fraction was responsible for all of EA reduction in secondary effluent. Moreover, it is interesting to find that the sum of EA of the four fractions was higher than that of the original sample. All the fractions did not inhibit the growth of yeast cells (data not shown). This is due to the fact that the humic/fulvic acid-like substance in HIS fraction could adsorb estrogenic chemicals and mask the EA in the yeast bioassay analysis (Zhang et al., 2012a, b). This is also the reason why the decomposition of HOA, HOB, and HON fraction in the de-aerated photocatalytic system was only responsible for 30.2% of EA reduction in secondary effluent. Therefore, the decomposition of humic/fulvic acid-like substances in HIS fraction during aerobic photocatalytic phase played an important role in accelerating both hydrogen production and EA removal."
9,Evaluation of ROS during the P-TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process,"3.3 Evaluation of ROS during the P-TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process The possible mechanisms of EA removal and EfOM decomposition during photocatalytic processes were studied by the examination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through adding their scavengers (Fig. 4 ). DMSO, EDTA, and BQ were used to quench $OH, h+, and •O2 -, respectively. In the de-aerated photocatalytic system, when •O2 - scavengers was added, no significant changes occurred on the EA removal. However, when holes and $OH scavengers were introduced, the removal ratios were depressed by 3% and 24.9%, respectively. The results showed that the main reduction of EA in the de-aerated system was attributed to the oxidation of OH. In the DO-decreasing photocatalytic system, when $OH, h+, and •O2 - scavengers were added, the removal ratios of EA were depressed by 60.9%, 5.6%, and 19.7% in aerobic phase and 5.2%, 0.6%, and 0.06% in anoxic phase, respectively. The results indicated that •O2 -and $OH were the major ROS in the aerobic phase and $OH was almost the most abundant generated oxidation species in the anoxic phase. EPR spin trapping technique was also used to monitor the ROS formed in these photocatalytic systems (Figure S4). Significant characteristic peaks of DMPO–$OH were observed in both photocatalytic systems. In the DO-decreasing photocatalytic system, the intensities of DMPO–$OH peaks in aerobic phase were higher than those in anoxic phase. In order to further verify whether •O2 -is formed in these systems, a polar aprotic solvent, DMSO, was used as solvent instead of water. It is shown that •O2 - signals were observed in the aerobic phase of DO-decreasing photocatalytic process, while no characteristic peaks were is attributed to oxidation of •O2 − and $OH. With the consuming of DO, the concentration of •O2 − was decreasing and the remaining photogenerated electrons were trapped by the deposited Pt. Under anoxic condition, the holes could still react with scavengers (i.e. hydroxyl and water species) and produce $OH, while the trapped electrons in Pt would preferentially react with protons/water for the production of hydrogen (Kim and Choi, 2011). The reduction of EA under aerobic condition is mainly attributed to oxidation of $OH. As mentioned above, the decomposition of humic/fulvic acid-like substances in HIS fraction played an important role in accelerating hydrogen production. This is also the reason why the APE higher in DO-decreasing photocatalytic system than that in the de-aerated system. It has been reported that the humic/fulvic acid-like substances could be decomposed by the oxidation with any of h+, •O2 − or $OH during photocatalytic oxidation process (Al-Rasheed and Cardin, 2003; Palmer et al., 2002). Therefore, it could be deduced that the HIS decomposition in photocatalytic system was only relate to the concentrations of ROS generated. The higher concentrations of ROS were, the easier HIS fraction could be decomposed."
10,Effects of inorganic ions on photocatalytic hydrogen production and EA removal,"3.4 Effects of inorganic ions on photocatalytic hydrogen production and EA removal Effects of inorganic ions, which could be widely detected in secondary effluents, on hydrogen production and EA removal in the DO-decreasing photocatalytic system were showed in Fig. 5 . As for HPO 4 2 − , it has been reported in our previous study that the TiO2 surface strongly adsorbs HPO 4 2 − ions (Zhang et al., 2012b). The adsorption of phosphate takes place as a ligand attaches to a surface Ti4+ ion by an exchange reaction between the surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 and HPO 4 2 − Gong, 2001). The bridging bidentate complex formed adsorbed on the TiO2 surface would react with neither electrons nor holes and remain unchanged during photocatalysis (Zhang et al., 2013). Therefore, the photocatalytic reactivity of the photocatalyst should be inhibited in a long-lasting manner by the adsorbed phosphate (Zhang et al., 2012b). However, in this study, it was interesting to find that rates of EA removal and hydrogen production increased with an increase in HPO 4 2 − concentration up to 0.1 mmol/L, beyond which they started to rapidly decrease. The OH groups on the surface TiO2, which are hole-trapping sites, were displaced by the modified phosphates during P-TiO2 phosphation. The photocatalytic generated holes would react with mobile scavengers and be carried away as the desorbing hydroxyl radical (Zhang et al., 2013). It indicated that the oxidation of pollutants in the P-TiO2/Pt photocatalytic system did not take place on the surface of photocatalyst. Therefore, the adsorption of HPO 4 2 − in the photocatalytic system would not result in a negative impact on P-TiO2/Pt photocatalytic removal of estrogenic chemicals from secondary effluent. On the contrary, the generated desorbed hydroxyl radical are more likely to attack the benzene rings directly and break the ring structure, which plays a key role in potent EA (Zhao et al., 2008). Moreover, the adsorption of HPO 4 2 − also retards the recombination of electron–hole pairs (Zhang et al., 2013). Therefore, the co-existing small amounts of HPO 4 2 − (below 0.1 mmol/L) enhanced the EA removal and hydrogen production during P-TiO2/Pt photocatalysis. When the initial concentration of HPO 4 2 − was higher than 0.1 mmol/L, the main ROS in the photocatalytic system tended to be phosphate radicals, which have lower oxidation potential than hydroxyl radicals (Criado et al., 2001). The oxidation of benzene rings by phosphate radicals could only lead to the formation of phenoxy rings, resulting in the failure of humic/fulvic acid-like substances decomposition (Criado et al., 2001). Therefore, EA removal and hydrogen production were inhibited by HPO 4 2 − at the concentration from 0.1 to 1 mmol/L. As for HCO 3 − , the rate of EA removal decreased with the increased initial ion concentration, while, the rate of hydrogen production increased with an increase in HCO 3 − concentration up to 0.2 mmol/L, beyond which it started to decrease. The inhibition of EA removal by HCO 3 − might be due to the synergistic effect of adsorption and scavenging of holes/hydroxyl radicals (Zhang et al., 2012b). The HCO 3 − anions scavenge the hydroxyl radicals at the rate of 8.5 × 106 M-1 s-1 with the generation of carbonate radicals, which has lower oxidation potential than hydroxyl radicals (Lair et al., 2008). The accelerated hydrogen production by the HCO 3 − (from 0 to 0.2 mmol/L) may be attributed to the accumulation of electrons in Pt through scavenging hydroxyl radicals. The decelerated EA removal by the HCO 3 − (from 0.2 to 1 mmol/L) was due to the fact that the oxidation of aromatic substances by carbonate radicals leads to the formation of quinone derivatives which appear as the major primary products together with ortho and para hydroxylated compounds (Mazellier et al., 2007). Therefore, the formed carbonate radicals could not decompose humic/fulvic acid-like substances with the generated electron donors, resulting in the decline of hydrogen production. There are some studies reporting a negative impact for NO 3 − on photocatalytic hydrogen production since NO 3 − is more vulnerable to reduction than H+ and would compete with the protons reduction via excited conduction band electrons (Kato and Kudo, 2002; Najafabadi and Taghipour, 2012.). However, in our experiments, the addition of NO 3 − only leaded to minor impacts on both EA removal and hydrogen production. A plausible explanation for such behavior is that the trapped large number of electrons in Pt during anoxic P-TiO2/Pt photocatalytic phase would repel low concentrations of anion (e.g. NO 3 − ) through electrostatic interaction. In order to verify this hypothesis, 1 mol/L NO 3 − were added in secondary effluent sample. The solution was tested under the same conditions during P-TiO2/Pt photocatalysis (Figure S5). It was found that the photocatalytic EA removal was not affected by high concentration of NO 3 − in aerobic phase while both hydrogen production and EA removal were significantly inhibited in the following anoxic phase. Moreover, it was also found that the pH value and NO 3 − concentration in the solution were substantially constant at 7.0 ± 0.1 and 1.0 mol/L during photocatalytic process. Therefore, the results confirmed that NO 3 − was almost unreactive toward holes/hydroxyl radicals in neutral conditions during aerobic photocatalysis (Denisov, 2007). It also indicated that electrons transport from Pt on the surface of P-TiO2/Pt to NO 3 − could be achieved under synergetic drivers of chemical potential difference and concentration difference. The reduced NO 3 − species in anoxic photocatalytic phase could immediately react with generated hydroxyl radicals to make a null cycle [reactions (4) and (5)] with inhibiting the reduction of protons and oxidation of estrogenic chemicals. By investigating the change of pH values during photocatalytic process, it could be confirmed that the reduced NO 3 − species was NO 3 − . (4) NO 3 − + 2 H + + 2 e CB − → NO 2 − + H 2 O (5) NO 2 − + OH → NO 3 − + H +"
11,Conclusions,"For the first time, the presence of initial DO (6.5 mg/L) was found to simultaneously enhance hydrogen production and EA removal from secondary effluent through solar photocatalysis using P-TiO2/Pt microspheres. By isolating secondary effluent into four fractions (i.e. HOA, HOB, HON, and HIS), it was found that the decomposition of humic/fulvic acid-like substances in HIS fraction played a key role in accelerating hydrogen production and EA removal. The humic/fulvic acid-like substances were decomposed by formed high concentrations of ROS (i.e. $OH, h+, and •O2 -) in aerobic photocatalytic phase with the generation of electron donors (i.e. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetate, and formate), which could significantly improve hydrogen production at APE 3.04 × 10−3. EA could be totally removed within 200 min by the oxidation of aerobic/anoxic photo-formed ROS. HPO 4 2 − accelerated hydrogen production and EA removal at concentrations below 0.1 mmol/L, but inhibited either processes at high concentrations. HCO 3 − was also found to accelerate hydrogen production at concentrations below 0.2 mmol/L and inhibit it at high concentrations while small amounts of HCO 3 − could inhibit EA removal from secondary effluent. The presence of NO 3 − (below 1 mmol/L) only leaded to minor impacts on both processes."
