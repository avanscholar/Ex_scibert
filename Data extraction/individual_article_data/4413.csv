0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean energy source that has a high energy density. Its combustion products are 100% pollution-free to the environment [1,2]. Excess electricity from wind and solar power generation can be used to make hydrogen through the use of water electrolysis; thus, the cost of hydrogen production is greatly reduced [3]. The production of high-purity hydrogen from water electrolysis is a simple, effective and environmentally friendly method. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is part of the water electrolysis process [4,5]. In an alkaline solution, the kinetics of the HER are sluggish, and a large overpotential is required to reach the required current [6,7]. Currently, Pt-group precious metal electrocatalysts still show the best performance for HER. However, due to their high cost and scarcity, they cannot be used to produce hydrogen through realistic water electrolysis on a large scale [8,9]. Therefore, research on transition metal catalysts that are abundant and economical has been favored by a large number of researchers [10,11]. In recent years, to design low-cost and efficient HER catalysts, many researchers have extensively studied a series of HER electrocatalysts, such as transition group metal alloys [12,13], sulfides [14–17], nitrides [18,19], phosphides [20–23], borides [24,25], carbides [26,27] and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [28,29]. For alloys, the alloy performance is much better than that of a single metal in terms of catalytic activity [30]. This may depend on the synergy between the metal atoms in the alloy. Early reports have shown that combining Co with Mo or W will significantly improve the performance of the HER [31]. According to the literature, Co can be used as the active centre in water electrolysis, and Mo has very excellent adsorption performance for hydrogen [32–34]. Clearly, when Co and Mo are mixed together, the electronic structure of both sides will be optimized [35], thereby accelerating the rate of hydrogen production. Cobalt has good catalytic activity and good corrosion resistance [36]. The catalytic activity of bare cobalt can be improved by alloying to obtain the best hydrogen evolution performance [37]. At the same time, by increasing the surface area of the catalyst, thus increasing the number of exposed active sites, the HER efficiency of the catalyst can be improved [38]. According to the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, various nanostructured materials have been synthesized by utilizing the different vacancy/atom diffusion coefficients between different materials [39–43], which greatly increases their specific surface area. Thus，the nanostructured architecture will also improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst [44,45]. Herein, based on the above inspiration, nanomesh CoMoMg alloys were prepared as HER electrocatalysts by a facile and conventional sintering method on the basis of the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The nanomesh CoMoMg alloys effectively electrocatalysed the HER by utilizing the synergistic effect of Co/Mo and the exposure of more active sites."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis We purchased cobalt powder (48 µm,>99.5%), molybdenum powder (10 µm,>99.5%), and magnesium powder (75 µm,>99.9%) from Aladdin Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Nominal CoxMoyMg(1−x-y) (i.e., x = 0, 0.06, 0.59, 0.69, 0.80; y = 0.71, 0.67, 0.19, 0.10, 0) alloys were fabricated by a conventional method of high-temperature sintering (see Fig. 1). The spherical magnesium powder was added in an amount that was ten percent of the sum of the cobalt powder and molybdenum powder mass (see Table S1); the magnesium powder was used as a pore-forming agent to prepare a nanoscale porous alloy through the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The weighed powders were placed in a planetary ball mill (QM-3SP4, Nanjing University Instrument Factory), and then uniformly mixed at a speed of 250 revolutions per second for 6 h. After mixing, the powder was placed in a grinding tool and then pressed with a uniaxial pressure of 580 MPa for 1 min to form a cylindrical blank sample (Φ12 mm × 7 mm). The cylindrical blank sample was placed in an alumina crucible, and the alumina crucible was placed in the middle of a quartz furnace tube of a small tube furnace (Hefei Kejing Material Technology Corporation, 1200X-S) so that it could be uniformly heated. Before sintering, Ar (>99.999%) was used for purging at a flow rate of 300 mL min−1 for 2 min to remove the air in the furnace tube. During the process of sintering, the airflow rate was changed to 50 mL min−1. Until the temperature in the furnace dropped to room temperature, the argon valve was closed. The conventional sintering temperature was 800 °C ~ 1100 °C. The binary Co0.80Mg0.20 and Mo0.71Mg0.29 samples also were compared with the ternary CoMoMg alloys. The preparation of Pt/C electrode is that 1 mg Pt/C power was distributed in 0.25 mL Isopropyl alcohol and 5 μL 0.5% Nafion solution, ultrasonically. And then 7 μL of the prepared Pt/C mixed solution was placed into the unsoiled glassy carbon electrode and arid at the room temperature. The mass loading of Pt/C power is approximately 0.39 mg cm−2."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-Ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker) was used to identify the crystal structure of the prepared samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD, Shimadzu-Kratos) was used to analyse the elemental valence information. The surface morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Sigma HD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Talos F200X). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford Instruments) was used to identify the atomic composition of the sample. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer 8300) was employed to measure the composition and N2 absorbing–desorbing isotherms (Micromeritics ASAP 2460) was performed to analyze the BET surface areas and average pore diameter."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All HER electrochemical tests were performed on a Shanghai Chenhua CHI660c electrochemical workstation (CHI-660 C, Shanghai CHI Instruments, Inc.) equipped with a three-electrode system. The prepared alloys were cut into small disks (Φ12 mm × 1 mm), and the excess area was sealed with 703 silicone rubber to expose an effective geometric area of 1 cm−2. Then, the sealed sample was used as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, and a carbon rod was used as the auxiliary electrode. All test potentials were calibrated with a reversible hydrogen standard electrode (RHE) [46]. The RHE voltage calibration curve is shown in Fig. S1. The polarization curve of HER was performed by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 1 mv s−1 in an overpotential range of −0.447 ~ 0.253 V (vs. RHE). The Tafel slope with IR correction was obtained from the polarization curve. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from an overpotential of 0.403–0.503 V (vs. RHE) in a scan rate range of 10–100 mv s−1; CV can determine the double layer capacitance (C dl) of the sample and then qualitatively analyze the electrochemical specific surface area of the sample [47]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted with an overpotential of 0.153 V (vs RHE) at a frequency range of 0.01 ~ 100k Hz. Constant current measurements were performed by the current step method at various current densities (1 mA cm−2, 10 mA cm−2, 50 mA cm−2, 100 mA cm−2, 150 mA cm−2 and 200 mA cm−2). To meet the needs of industry, the long-term stability of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode sample which is at the current density of 2 A cm−2 for 100 h in the 1 M KOH solution was further assessed. A two-electrode device with the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode as the cathode and the carbon rod as the anode was used, testing the curve between the bath potential and time. There is a separation distance of approximately 30 mm without a diaphragm between anode and cathode."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 2a exhibits the XRD curves of the nominal Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21 samples sintered at 900 ℃ (denoted as Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900, respectively). All the samples with the different sintering temperatures and compositions are similarly denoted. Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900 shows three diffraction peaks located at 40.5°, 58.6° and 73.7° that correspond to the (110), (200) and (211) facets of metal Mo (JCPDS No. 42–1120), respectively, indicating a formation of Mo-based solution solid in combination with the latter ICP-OES analysis of composition (Table S3). The Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 shows six diffraction peaks located at 29.6°, 40.6°, 44°, 46.5°, 61.4° and 73.9° that correspond to the (101), (200), (002), (201), (202) and (220) crystal planes of intermetallic Co3Mo (JCPDS No. 29–0488). A small diffraction peak at 58.6° indicates that a small amount of Mo-based solution solid may be presented in Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900. The Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 electrode shows nine diffraction peaks located at 29.6°, 46.5°, 61.4°, 40.5°, 58.6°, 73.7°, 44.2°, 51.5° and 75.9° that correspond to the (101), (201), (202) crystal planes of intermetallic Co3Mo (JCPDS No. 29–0488), the (110), (200), (211) crystal planes of metal Mo (JCPDS No. 42–1120) and the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of metal Co (JCPDS No. 15–0806), respectively; evidently, it is a mixture of intermetallic Co3Mo, Mo- and Co-based solution solids. Fig. S2 shows that other sintering temperatures at 800 ℃, 1000 ℃ and 1100 ℃ does not have a large influence on the structure of the Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22 samples. The Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21 sample sintered at 800 ℃ at has a similar structure compared to the Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21 sample sintered at 900 ℃. However, when sintering temperature is increased to 1000 ℃, the Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21 sample is transformed into a mixture of Co-based solution solid and MgO. When the sintering temperature reaches 1100 ℃, the Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21 sample is changed into a mixture of intermetallic Co3Mo and Co-based solution solid. (see Fig. S2). Fig. 2b-e show the XPS of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 sample before and after ageing for 10,000 s at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 2b, before ageing, the peaks located at 780.9 eV and 796.5 eV correspond to the positions of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 for the Co3+ in Co3O4, and the peaks at 782.3 eV and 797.8 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 for the Co2+ in CoO, respectively. There are two satellite peaks near the peaks of the Co oxides, which are located at 786.7 eV and 803.6 eV [48,49]. The peaks at 777.7 eV and 792.8 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co0, which should be the metallic state of the internal Co atom in the intermetallic Co3Mo [50]. The peak intensity of Co0 is much lower than that of the Co oxides, which indicates that the main phase consists of Co oxides. After ageing, the Co0 peak disappears. The peaks located at 780.5 eV and 797 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of the Co3+ in Co3O4. The peaks at 781.5 eV and 795.5 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of the Co2+ in Co(OH)2 [4]. Co3+ always exists before and after ageing, and it may be the highest valence state of cobalt. The XPS of Mo is shown in Fig. 2c. Before ageing, the peaks at 230.6 eV and 233.7 eV correspond to the positions of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of the Mo4+ in MoO2. The peaks at 232.5 eV and 235.6 eV correspond to the positions of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of the Mo6+ in MoO3. This is due to the formation of a Mo oxide on the surface of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode [51,52]. The peaks at binding energies of 227.3 eV and 230.4 eV correspond to the positions of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo0, respectively, which should be the metallic state of the internal Mo atom in the intermetallic Co3Mo [50]. After HER, the peaks of Mo0 and Mo6+ have a little deviation to the right compared to before ageing, while the peaks of Mo4+ does disappear. This may be due to the formation of the corresponding Mo hydroxide. As shown in Fig. 2d, the position of the O 1 s peak shifts from 531.5 to 531.0 eV. This indicates that O changes from a metal-oxygen before ageing to both a metal-oxygen and hydroxyl-oxygen after ageing. As shown in Fig. 2e, the position of the Mg 2p peak shifts from 50.3 to 49.5 eV. This shows that Mg also changes to Mg(OH)2. The surface compositions of Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 derived from the XPS analysis shows Co0.40Mo0.30Mg0.30 before ageing and becomes Co0.83Mo0.05Mg0.12 after ageing, respectively (see Table S2), indicating a dissolution of Mo species in the alkaline media. The ICP-OES of pristine Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900, Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 is shown in Table S3, which is basically consistent with the data of Table S1. From the XPS before and after ageing, we can observe that the metal oxide on the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode surface can transform the metal oxyhydroxide during the HER process. Hydroxides of cobalt, molybdenum and magnesium are formed after ageing, and these hydroxides provide favorable conditions for the desorption of OH−1 and the adsorption of H*. This is also consistent with the fact that Co can be used as an active cent74e in the process of water electrolysis, and Mo has very excellent adsorption performance for hydrogen [32–34]. The above discussion shows that the structure and composition of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode surface is reorganized during the HER process. Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy. As revealed in the picture, the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy shows a nanomesh surface morphology, which has nanopores in a three-dimensional orientation. The aperture size of the nanopores is approximately 30–80 nm. The section pattern of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy further demonstrate the nanomesh morphology (see Fig. S3). Fig. S4 exhibits that the sample without Mg cannot nearly form nanoporous structure and only has little nanosheets existed on the surface, indicating that the Mg as the pore-making agent is very key for the fabrication of nanomesh. The LSV curves in Fig. S5 further proves to be the pivotal role of the Mg. The formation of the nanomesh morphology of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy is related to the nanoscale Kirkendall effect that occurs due to the different diffusion rates of the Co/Mo/Mg atoms and vacancies. During sintering, the Co, Mo and Mg atoms of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy show mutual diffusion (CoMo, CoMg, MoMg) but at different diffusion rates. Then, vacancies are formed (see Fig. S6). This causes the formation of the nanomesh morphologies and nanopores of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy. The nanomesh morphology and nanopores provide a larger specific surface area, which in turn exposes more active sites for the HER. The BET surface area and pore size of the Co0.80Mg0.20-900, Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000, Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 electrodes is shown in Table S4 and Fig. S7. The Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy has a specific surface area of 2.7 m2 g−1 and an average pore diameter of 13.6 nm, further indicating the nanomesh morphology based on the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy also has good wettability and hydrophilicity due to its developed structure of interconnected nanomesh (see Video S1). In contrast, the Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900 sample has a nanorod topography, and the Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 sample has an interconnected nanosheet topography (see Figs. S8, S9). At the same sintering temperature, the different compositions of the samples lead to differences in their nanostructure and morphology. Fig. 4a exhibits the HRTEM image of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode before ageing. It can be seen from the figure that the interplanar crystal spacing is approximately 0.222 nm, which is also consistent with the (220) crystal plane of intermetallic Co3Mo. Fig. 4b shows the selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode. Through an analysis of the diffraction ring, the crystal plane index of each diffraction ring can be clearly obtained, which also completely corresponds to the PDF card of intermetallic Co3Mo (JCPDS No. 29–0488). The main component of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 sample is intermetallic Co3Mo. Fig. 4c-g display the HAADF-STEM image and EDX elemental mapping of Co, Mo, O and Mg in the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 sample before ageing. It can be seen from the figure that the distribution of Co and Mo is uniform. As a pore-forming agent, most of the magnesium is evaporated during the sintering process. The presence of oxygen also indicates the formation of Co, Mo and Mg oxides on the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 surface. From the TEM image of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode after ageing, it can be seen that there are some cuspate morphologies on the surface of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode (see Fig. S10). This may be due to the oxyhydroxides of Co, Mo and Mg. Fig. 5a displays the LSV curves at a scan rate of 1 mv s−1 without IR correction for the Co0.80Mg0.20-900, Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000, Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 electrodes in a 1 M KOH solution. When the current density is 10 mA cm−2, the overpotentials of the Co0.80Mg0.20-900, Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000, Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900, Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 and Pt/C electrodes are 109, 197, 79, 36, 72 and 17 mV, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the HER performance of the Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 electrode is the worst, while the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode exhibits the best HER performance except Pt/C. The Co0.80Mg0.20-900, Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000, Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 electrodes at the current density of 2 A cm−2 achieve the overpotentials of 1965 mV, 1999 mV, 1220 mV, 611 mV and 1086 mV, respectively ( see Fig. S11). The HER performance of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode is still the best samples produced with other sintering temperatures and components (see Figs. 5a and S12). The nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode can drive current densities of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mA cm−2 with overpotentials of 36, 91, 152, and 198 mV, respectively. The excellent HER performance of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy not only comes from the synergistic effect of Co, Mo and Mg but also because the electrode has a nanomesh morphology, which provides a larger specific surface area that exposes more active sites. As shown in Fig. 5b, the Tafel slopes of the Co0.80Mg0.20-900, Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000, Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 electrodes with a 150% IR correction are 182 mV dec−1, 195 mV dec−1, 170 mV dec−1, 68 mV dec−1 and 165 mV dec−1, respectively. The Tafel slope of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode is the smallest of all electrodes due to the large specific surface area of the nanomesh and the synergistic effect between Co and Mo. Fig. 5c shows the Nyquist plots, which are measured by EIS. In order to further study kinetics of the HER, the R s(Q dl R ct) of equivalent circuit was used to analyze the EIS carried out at 0.153 V (vs RHE) from 100 Hz to 0.01 Hz. As displayed in the Fig. 5c and Table S5, the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode has the lowest charge transfer resistance (R ct) of approximately 0.37 Ω cm−2 that is much smaller than those of Co0.80Mg0.20-900 (2.29 Ω cm−2), Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 (1.41 Ω cm−2), Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900 (1.33 Ω cm−2) and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 (0.84 Ω cm−2), which specify that it is more efficient and has faster electron transport [53–55]. Thus, the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode has the better electrocatalytic activity of HER. Fig. 5d shows the C dl curves of the Co0.80Mg0.20-900, Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000, Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 electrodes calculated from Fig. S13. The electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) can be evaluated by the electric double layer capacitors [56,57]. The C dl values of the Co0.80Mg0.20-900, Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000, Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900, Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Co0.69Mo0.10Mg0.21-900 electrodes are 2.2 mF cm−2, 69.6 mF cm−2, 38.7 mF cm−2, 16.5 mF cm−2 and 2.5 mF cm−2, respectively. The C dl values of the Co0.06Mo0.67Mg0.27-900 and Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 are bigger than the C dl value of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode, but the HER performance of Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode is best, which may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the optimal component ratio and more exposed active sites during the HER process compared with those of other electrodes. Fig. 5e shows the consecutive galvanostatic measurements of the Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 and Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 electrodes at various current densities for 60,000 s in a 1 M KOH solution. As shown in the figure, it can be seen that when the HER current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode and Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 electrode display overpotentials of 36 mV and 197 mV, respectively. At a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the overpotentials of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode and Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 electrode achieve 198 mV and 308 mV, respectively. Evidently, the overpotentials of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode are much better than the overpotentials of the Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 electrode at the same current densities. The overpotential values of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode, which is tested for 60,000 s under different current densities, show almost no fluctuation. However, those of the Mo0.71Mg0.29-1000 electrode have small fluctuations. This shows that the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode not only has excellent HER performance but also has perfect stability in alkaline media. Fig. 6a shows the LSV curves of Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode before and after a long-term stability experiment for 100 h at the current density of 2 A cm−2. As shown in the figure, after 100 h, the HER performance of Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode is better than the initial electrode, which can be attributed to the activation in the early stage (Figs. S14 and S15) and high structure stability at ultrahigh current density. Fig. 6b displays the mass loss rates of the Co, Mo and Mg elements at the current density of 2 A cm−2 in a 1 M KOH solution. As shown in the figure, the Co, Mo and Mg elements at the current density of 2 A cm−2 possess the mass loss rates of 0.011 mg cm−2 h−1, 0.187 mg cm−2 h−1 and 0.006 mg cm−2 h−1, respectively, further indicating the excellent stability performance at ultrahigh current density. Thereinto, the Mo has a higher loss rate than that of the Co and Mg species, which should be attributed to the unstable characteristic of Mo species in a high oxidized valence [58]. However, the distinguishing feature of the intermetallic compound structure inhibited a fast dissolution during the HER at ultrahigh current density. After 100 h, the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode has not a change of surface morphology and structure, indicating a superior long-term stability at ultrahigh current density, as shown in Figs. 6c and S16. In summary, the excellent HER performance and long-term stability of the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode is comparable to that of some excellent electrocatalysts that are currently available (see Table S6)."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, based on the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, CoMoMg alloy electrodes with excellent HER performance were prepared by conventional sintering methods. In a 1 M KOH solution, the nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 electrode only needs an overpotential of 36 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The nanomesh Co0.59Mo0.19Mg0.22-900 alloy electrode has excellent HER performance in alkaline media, which is mainly due to its nanomesh morghology that provides a larger electrochemical specific surface area and exposes more active sites. Co serves as the active site for the desorption of OH−1 and Mo is the adsorption site of the hydrogen intermediate (H*), which can form perfect synergy in the HER process. Its excellent HER performance and long-term stability (>100 h) at a current density of 2 A cm−2 are comparable to those of some advanced electrodes that are currently on the market. The research in this work provides a low-cost and environmentally friendly method for preparing nanoporous structures, which can effectively solve the problem of expensive Pt-metal catalysts."
