0,Introduction,"Furfuryl alcohol (FAL) is an important chemical in the polymer and chemical industry and potentially as a precursor for components in “P series” alternative fuels [1,2]. The main process of preparation of furfuryl alcohol is the hydrogenation of furfural, produced by the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the hemicellulosic pentose fractions of biomass. The hydrogenation of furfural is carried out either in the gas phase or the liquid phase [3–5]. Furfuryl alcohol dissolved in water is stable at room temperature, whereas in the presence of an acid catalyst the FAL monomer undergoes reactions to produce oligomers and polymers or levulinic acid. The acid aqueous medium affects the yield and selectivity of these pathways. At high FAL concentrations the preferred reaction is the condensation reaction between FAL and the carbonium ion (Scheme 1 ) formed from the initial elimination of water molecule from FAL through acid catalysis [6,7]. The Gibbs free energy of this dimerization that leads to the CH2 bridged species is −39.7kJmol−1 [8]. The formation of an ether-bridged dimmer from FAL and the cation is thermodynamically uphill by 14.6kJmol−1. Depending on an acid catalyst and its concentration oligomers or polymers containing conjugated sequences are formed [9,10]. These polymers are used for preparing acid and alkali resistant materials, adhesives, corrosion-protective materials, and nano-composites [8,11,12]. Furfuryl alcohol can be converted into levulinic acid (Scheme 1) by reacting furfuryl alcohol and water in the presence of strong homogeneous non-oxidizing acids or solids [13,14]. In order to suppress the formation of oligomeric condensation products it is important to keep the concentration of furfuryl alcohol in the liquid reaction mixture below 2wt%. The furan ring opening is occurring via a geminal diol species, 4,5,5-trihydroxypentan-2-one, formed by the addition of two water molecules to FAL, where two of the oxygen atoms from FAL are retained [14]. Levulinic acid is a potential feedstock in the production of chemicals, e.g. butanone [15], pentanoic acid [16] and fuels on the basis of γ-valerolactone or esters of levulinic acid [17–21]. When furfuryl alcohol or its derivatives are heated in water or a mixture of water and organic solvents in the presence of Broensted or Lewis acid catalysts the rearrangement of the furan ring to the corresponding hydroxy-cyclopentenone derivatives may proceed (Scheme 2 ). The substituent R can be hydrogen, lower alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl or cycloaryl. With very low rate and poor yields are characterized reactions in the acetone–water mixture, catalyzed by zinc chloride, when the substituent R is an alkyl group [22]. Better yields were achieved in the presence of acid catalysts, e.g. polyphosphoric acid [23] or when the reaction was performed in water at pH between 3.5 and 6.5 and a very long reaction time [24]. This paper presents the kinetics of ring rearrangement reaction of furfuryl alcohol to 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone (in the literature denoted also as 3-hydroxy-4-cyclopentenone) catalyzed by self-dissociation of water and the investigation of the influence of various additives on the desired reaction. Using a power law approach a kinetic model describing experimental data of furfuryl alcohol conversion in water to 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone, polymers and levulinic acid in a temperature range of 110–200°C has been developed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Furfuryl alcohol (98%) was purified by vacuum distillation and stored under nitrogen in a refrigerator. Levulinic acid (99%), was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. 4-Hydroxycyclopent-2-enone was prepared by the procedure described earlier [25]. Water used for experiments was prepared by double distillation of deionized water in an apparatus protecting dissolution of carbon dioxide into the distillate (solid NaOH cap). Other chemicals of analytical grade purity were purchased from Mikrochem (Slovakia)."
3,Experimental and analysis,"2.2 Experimental and analysis High pressure stainless steel tubes (i.d. 10mm, volume 10ml) served as reactors. Inside the tube was on a screw hanged a capsule with the volume 0.4–0.7ml made of Teflon. In a typical experiment 5ml of re-distilled water was charged into the tube and 200μl of furfuryl alcohol into a capsule. The tube was purged with nitrogen, closed and then in a vertical position carefully placed into a pre-heated aluminium block. The aluminium block that could hold up five tubes was electrically heated and the temperature was measured inside the reference steel tube (accuracy ±1.5°C). The aluminium block filled with reactors was mounted on a swinging device that could oscillate in a large diameter of circle. During the heating of tubes to the desired temperature (usually it lasted 5–8min) the tubes were located in a vertical position, i.e. furfuryl alcohol placed in a capsule was separated from the aqueous phase. After switching on the swinging device furfuryl alcohol was mixed with water and the reaction started. In specified time intervals the tubes were withdrawn from the heating block and then quickly cooled down to ambient temperature with water. The liquid/semi-solid product mixture was removed from the tube and the capsule. The accumulated organic liquid/semi-solid phase was separated by centrifugation, weighed and then analyzed. In the water layer was determined by gas chromatography the concentration of unreacted furfuryl alcohol and 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone. A gas chromatograph Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 1.2m×2mm glass column packed with 5% C 20M+5% SE 30 on Chromosorb W 80–100 meshes was used. The injector was maintained at a temperature of 230°C and FID at 250°C. The initial temperature of the oven was 60°C and the temperature increased at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 until 200°C. Nitrogen (35mlmin−1) was used as the carrier gas. The concentration of levulinic acid was determined by HPLC analysis and in some samples also by using gas chromatography [26]. The chromatographic system was equipped with a Shimadzu LC 10 AD high-pressure solvent delivery system, using a Rheodyne injector provided with a 20μl sample loop and a Shimadzu refractive index detector. The chromatography was performed at ambient temperature by using Aminex HPX-87 H Bio-Rad column and an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid (5mM) at the rate of 1.0mlmin−1 as the mobile phase. Authentic samples of furfuryl alcohol, 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone and levulinic acid were used as standard for quantification. In liquid samples and samples of the gas phase obtained in the experiments carried out at higher reaction temperatures (>160°C) the presence of some light organic products was also detected by the GC/MS technique (Shimadzu QP 5000 with EI and capillary column HP-1, 50m×0.2mm and carrier gas helium 30mlmin−1). However, these products were formed only in trace amounts. The amount of semi-solid furfuryl alcohol polymers was calculated as a difference between the amount of converted furfuryl alcohol and the amount of detected reaction products, i.e. 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone plus levulinic acid. In selected experiments the amount of this polymeric product was checked by gravimetric analysis of the washed and dried solid part. The differences between calculated and gravimetrically determined amounts of polymer were lower than 6%. Two to three duplicate runs were conducted for most of the experimental conditions. The relative errors for the yields between the runs under the same conditions were ensured within 5.1% of the reported value of yields."
4,Kinetics,"2.3 Kinetics The simulation of concentration of FAL and the main reaction products versus time for kinetic runs at different temperatures was carried out. At each reaction temperature minimal 10 experimental points were measured. The kinetic parameters were estimated using minimization of errors between the experimental data and the kinetic model. The conversion of FAL, X FAL and the yields of 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone Y HCP, polymers Y POL and levulinic acid Y LA were used in the calculations. The kinetics of FAL conversion to the mentioned reaction products was studied in a broad range of temperatures (110–200°C). At the reaction temperatures above 130°C the reaction rates were very fast. Therefore, it was important to determine if FAL placed in a capsule, i.e. separately from an aqueous phase was during the heating up period of ampoules to the desired reaction temperatures (it lasted 5–8min) decomposed. For this purpose several experiments were performed with representative reaction mixtures. In these experiments the ampoules filled with water and FAL, which was separately loaded in capsules, were placed in vertical position into a pre-heated block. After 10min, when the temperature reached a specified temperature (it was measured in the range 155–175°C) the ampoules were carefully withdrawn from the block and in vertical position placed into cold water. After cooling to ambient temperature the ampoules were vigorously turned to mix the content inside the ampoules. The GC analysis of aqueous mixtures from several experiments confirmed that during the heating-up period less than 2.5% of the amount of furfuryl alcohol was decomposed, but not to 4-HCP. Therefore, the effect of the heating-up period on the kinetics of reaction was excluded."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of acids,"3.1 Effect of acids The reactions of FAL in homogeneous aqueous solution are acid catalyzed. The initial step is a reaction in which after attack of hydrogen ion on the OH group of FAL, water is removed from the molecule and a carbocation intermediate is formed. However, this intermediate could not be measured directly in aqueous solution because of its high reactivity. The intermediate can by parallel reactions (i) be rearranged to 4-HCP [25], (ii) react with FAL molecules to form polymers with conjugated diene structures [8], and (iii) be transformed to levulinic acid by a ring-opening reaction [13,14] (Scheme 1). When the reaction of FAL is conducted at temperatures above 100°C hydrogen ions which initiate the attack of FAL molecule are produced by auto-dissociation of water molecules [27]. It explains why also in the absence of added acid catalysts FAL dissolved in water is at higher temperatures converted to 4-HCP and polymers, and in minor amounts also to levulinic acid. The application of acids, e.g. acetic acid and hydrochloric acid led to very high FAL conversion (Table 1 ). Weak acetic acid was used in higher concentration than well dissociated hydrochloric acid to generate similar amount of hydrogen ions. However, the presence of these acids had a negative influence on the product distribution and the selectivity of 4-HCP formation. The effect of reaction temperature on the maximal yield of 4-HCP at 100% and 50% conversion of furfuryl alcohol is shown in Fig. 1 . Comparison of these results as function of temperature led to several insights into the furfuryl alcohol reaction in water. The portion of FAL converted to 4-HCP increased more as to the furfuryl alcohol polymers. Almost the same dependences were observed at 50% and 100% conversion of furfuryl alcohol. At the temperature of 110°C the preferred reaction was polymerization of FAL and only about 10% of FAL was rearranged to 4-HCP. The selectivity factor towards 4-HCP, simply defined as the fraction of the furfuryl alcohol converted into 4-HCP, was at high reaction temperatures (180–200°C) little higher than 0.5 but at reaction temperatures below 120°C or at higher acidity of the reaction medium it was <0.25. Therefore, to obtain high selectivity of FAL conversion to 4-HCP in pure water it is advantageous to perform the reaction at high temperatures. The selectivity factor is significantly influenced by additives (Table 1). It was also observed that the conversion of FAL to 4-HCP reached at all reaction temperatures a certain maximal value which was not changed by the prolongation of the reaction time. It indicates that under reaction conditions 4-HCP remains stable, i.e. its degradation rate may be excluded in the kinetic model. In the studied temperature range levulinic acid is formed in the maximal yields 0.5–4.1mol%. Levulinic acid can influence the conversion of FAL and the products distribution. It is known [13,14,16,28] that at elevated temperatures (100–220°C) furfuryl alcohol in water and in the presence of strong protonic acids is converted to levulinic acid. However, the results in Table 1 show that under reaction conditions levulinic acid in concentration significantly higher (8.6wt%) than was determined in the reaction mixtures after reaction (0.5–4.1wt%), does not influence the reaction of FAL and the products distribution. It means that the autocatalytic effect of levulinic acid may be excluded in the kinetic scheme. The polymers formed in the experiments are insoluble organic materials which can be separated from the reaction mixtures by centrifugation. The colour of these polymers is changing from yellow-brown to dark-brown, depending on the reaction time and the reaction temperature. The NMR analysis of these polymers has shown that the average number of furan ring units in the insoluble organic material varies between 5 and 35 .The degree of furfuryl alcohol oligomerization increases with the reaction temperature and reaction time."
7,Kinetic study,"3.2 Kinetic study The presented experimental results confirmed that the main reactions of FAL in an aqueous solution at higher temperatures are furan ring rearrangement, polymerization and furan ring opening (Scheme 1). These reactions are acid catalyzed, i.e. depend on the initial protonation reaction of FAL which is influenced by the concentration of hydrogen ion. Based on the calculation of free energy of protonation at room temperature, which includes the free energy of solvation of a proton in an aqueous solution, all sites of FAL (Scheme 3 ) were found to be thermodynamically unfavourable [8]. More probable protonation sites are at positions 1 and 6, while protonation at the primary alcohol position 6 leads to the formation of a primary cation and a water molecule. The calculated free energy of this dehydration process is −17.6kJmol−1 at 298K [8]. These highly reactive carbocations are likely converted to a more stable cationic structure which initiates FAL polymerization, and in the presence of water they can also undergo a reaction leading to the furan ring rearrangement to 4-HCP [25] and to the furan ring-opening reaction producing levulinic acid [14,28]. Since at room temperature the initial furfuryl alcohol protonation is unfavourable without the addition of an acid catalyst, carbocation will not be formed even at higher water concentrations. However, an increase in temperature promotes dissociation of water [27] and an equilibrium shift towards the formation of more carbocations. The kinetic model of furfuryl alcohol transformation in water assumes that at temperatures 110–200°C the main reaction products, are 4-HCP, polymers and LA, which are formed from FAL by parallel reactions through the carbocation intermediate (Scheme 1). Each of these reactions of furfuryl alcohol was modelled as a single irreversible step, except the formation of carbocation intermediate which is a reversible reaction. Accordingly, we employed the following simple model to explain the observed experimental results (Scheme 4 ). In all runs, performed at eight reaction temperatures the decrease of concentration of FAL and the formation of the products with time can be explained by the following equations: (1) r 1 = − d C FAL d t = k 1 [ C FAL ] [ C H+ ] − k − 1 [ C cc+ ] (2) r 2 = d C 4-HCP d t = k 2 [ C cc+ ] [ C H+ ] a (3) r 3 = d C LA d t = k 3 [ C cc+ ] [ C H+ ] b (4) r 4 = d C POL d t = k 4 [ C cc+ ] [ C FAL ] c In the absence of added acids, the acidity of the aqueous solution of furfuryl alcohol is caused by the autodissociation of water. The concentration of the formed hydrogen ions increases with the temperature by the following relation, derived from the literature data [27] in the temperature range of 100–200°C: (5) [ C H+ ] = 1.4632 ⋅ 10 − 8 ⋅ t − 7.0262 ⋅ 10 − 7 where t is the temperature in °C. For example, at temperatures 100°C and 200°C the pH of water is 6.12 and 5.65, respectively. The kinetic rate constant k is also temperature dependent, in terms of Arrhenius equation: (6) k = k o exp E a R T , where E a is activation energy of the corresponding reaction. Using Eqs. (1–5) and experimental data from 8 sets of kinetic runs, it was possible to determine the kinetic parameters, which are listed in Table 2 . These parameters were obtained applying a model where orders to concentrations of FAL and hydrogen ions in Eqs. (2–4) were set to 1 and zero, respectively. In most runs the fit-percentages (% FIT) between experimental data and the kinetic model were very good. The lower values of this quality parameter were observed only for the rate constant of furfuryl alcohol conversion at very high reaction temperature (200°C) and for the rate constants of levulinic acid, which was formed in very low concentrations. Some examples of the conversion versus time for the experimental data and the model fits are given in Figs. 2 and 3 . The apparent rate constants for each reaction of furfuryl alcohol conversion in water, calculated in the temperature range of 110–200°C were plotted in the Arrhenius equation to derive the apparent activation energies for the corresponding reactions. As it is evident from the results in Fig. 4 and Table 3 the apparent activation energies of the main reaction (49.0kJmol−1) and the side reactions are very similar. This means that the selectivity of 4-HCP formation is independent on the reaction temperature. This is in accordance with the data in Fig. 1, showing that the formation of the both main reaction products, i.e. 4-HCP and polymers increases almost proportionally with increasing reaction temperature. Since in the reaction describing the rate of polymers formation the order to FAL is 1, it predicts that the selectivity to 4-HCP will be higher when furfuryl alcohol transformation will be performed at lower FAL concentrations in water. The results in Fig. 5 confirmed this assumption. Thus, to achieve high reaction rates practically without changing the selectivity to 4-HCP, it is attractive to perform transformation of furfuryl alcohol to 4-HCP at high temperatures."
8,Conclusions,"This study describes a simple and ecological method of furfuryl alcohol conversion into 4-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone in water alone without extra-added homogeneous or heterogeneous acid catalysts. Since the rearrangement of furan ring of furfuryl alcohol into 4-HCP is a reaction catalyzed by acids, acidity of the aqueous reaction medium was created by the autodissociation of water at higher temperatures. Under such green conditions almost total conversion of FAL and more than 50mol% yield of 4-HCP was achieved at short reaction times (5–10min). Besides avoiding corrosion problems caused in conventional processes by the added acid catalysts, the transformation of FAL in pure water simplifies the separation of the desired product from the reaction mixture. The results of the kinetic study of furfuryl alcohol conversion to 4-HCP, polymers and levulinic acid were modelled, and the kinetic parameters and apparent activation energies have been estimated. The analysis of these data led to the finding that the selectivity of 4-HCP formation is independent on the reaction temperature. Therefore, in order to achieve a high conversion of furfuryl alcohol to 4-HCP it is advantageous to perform the reaction at high temperatures."
