0,Introduction,"Biofuels can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass and waste streams of biomass processing [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass can be processed for instance by gasification to produce syngas or by fast pyrolysis to produce bio-oil [2,3]. Upgrading of syngas or bio-oil to biofuels involves the production of waste water fractions with oxygenated hydrocarbons that are considered as environmental pollutants [4,5]. Oxygenated hydrocarbons can be converted into hydrogen by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) [6,7] to minimize the disposal of organic waters. Hydrogen can be further utilized to process syngas in a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) unit or for bio-oil hydrotreatment. As a result, the efficiency of biofuel production processes can be improved. Organic waters derived from biorefineries constitute a complex mixture of oxygenated hydrocarbons challenging to process. Therefore, model compounds are frequently used as feedstock to study APR. Glycerol [8–10] is commonly selected to represent the water fraction derived from the production of biodiesel. Ethylene glycol [11–13] is highly considered because it represents a by-product of the APR of glycerol. Sorbitol and xylitol [14], methanol and ethanol [15], acetic acid [16] and real mixtures derived from biomass processing [17] are additionally regarded. The operating conditions of APR at low temperatures (200 °C–250 °C) and moderate pressures (1.5 MPa–5.0 MPa) [18] avoid an energy-consuming evaporation step. Accordingly, APR is a promising route to produce hydrogen because it is an energetically efficient process [19]. The efficiency is particularly evident when a highly diluted feedstock is considered. Furthermore, low temperatures thermodynamically facilitate the production of low-CO hydrogen. However, at these operating conditions, the thermodynamics also favours undesired side reactions to form hydrocarbons and carbohydrates. The kinetics of the main reactions is additionally limited due to low temperature and mass transfer limitations [20]. Aiming at increasing hydrogen yield and selectivity, the effect of reaction conditions and the performance of different catalysts have been widely investigated [7]. APR is commonly catalysed by platinum and nickel-based catalysts [21–25]. Platinum supported on alumina reaches high conversions and hydrogen selectivity [26–28], whereas nickel-based catalysts constitute an economically attractive alternative with lower stability and hydrogen selectivity [29–31]. Ni has been doped with metals including Cu, Ce and Sn [32–34], and supported on different metal oxides and carbonaceous materials [35–37] to improve hydrogen yield and catalyst stability. The water fractions derived from the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels have received slight consideration as APR feedstock. The number of studies on the APR of methanol and other model compounds found in those waters is scarce. Published research on the APR of methanol over nickel-based catalyst is limited to Ni Sn-Raney [20]. Methanol was selected as a model compound for this study because it is one of the compounds in higher concentration in the water fractions derived from both FT process and fast pyrolysis bio-oil refining [38,39]. In the APR of methanol, hydrogen is produced through C-H and/or O-H bond cleavage (Eqs. (1) and (2)). Moreover, methane and ethane can be formed by hydrogenation of carbon oxides after C-O bond scission (Eqs. (3)–(5)). Accordingly, a suitable catalyst for hydrogen production should promote the reactions specified in Eqs. (1) and (2), and inhibit the reactions in Eqs. (3)–(5).

For that purpose, nickel and nickel promoted with copper and cerium were supported on β-SiC, Al2O3 and ZrO2. In addition, due to the broad application and high performance of Pt/γ- Al2O3, this catalyst was selected as a benchmark catalyst. This work gives insights into the performance of nickel-based catalyst in APR for hydrogen production to potentially optimize the production of biofuels."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts,"2.1 Catalysts Nickel and bimetallic combinations of nickel and copper or cerium supported on porous silicon carbide and metal oxides, and Pt/γ-Al2O3 were tested in aqueous-phase reforming of methanol. Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst was supplied by BASF, SICAT supplied β-SiC, and Saint Gobain Norpro and Engelhard supplied γ-Al2O3. Zirconium hydroxide was supplied by MEL Chemicals in amorphous form, which was calcined at 600 °C in air to obtain ZrO2 support. The supports were first crushed and sieved to a particle size of (200–300) μm. Thereafter, the metals were loaded by wet or incipient wetness impregnation methods (Table 1 ). Nickel (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, ≥ 97.0%), copper (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99% −104%) and cerium (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, ≥ 99.0%) nitrates were the metal precursors supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. For the wet impregnation (WI in Table 1), either Ni-precursor or Ni- and Cu- or Ce-precursors were dissolved in 50 cm3 of distilled water. The support was added to the solution and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the water was evaporated at 110 °C under vacuum. The resulting catalyst was calcined at 450 °C for 2.5 h in flowing nitrogen. To prepare the catalysts by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI in Table 1), the supports were dried and afterwards impregnated with solutions of Ni-precursor, or simultaneously with Ni-, and Cu- or Ce-precursors. After drying, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in flowing air."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The metal content of fresh catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and/or X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The AAS analyses were conducted for the catalyst supported on β-SiC. Samples of 0.2 g were first dissolved in HNO3 and HCl at 120 °C to determine the Ni and Cu content. After the samples cooled down, these were diluted with Milli-Q water. A Varian AA240 AAS device was applied to measure the nickel and copper content using air-acetylene flame. X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements were performed in a wavelength dispersive PANalytical AXIOSmax analyzer with a SST-mas X-Ray source. XRF analyses were conducted to determine the metal content in all the alumina and zirconia-supported catalysts, and the cerium content in the β-SiC-supported catalyst. The surface properties of pure supports and fresh catalysts were determined from nitrogen physisorption data. The adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained by a MicromeriticsTristar 3000 device. Prior to the physisorption, catalyst samples of approximately 0.5 g were degassed overnight at 300 °C under helium flow. The BET method was used to calculate the surface area. Pore volume and diameter were calculated by the BJH method with data from the desorption-isotherm. Surface species were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD Alpha-1 diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation (45 kV and 40 mA). The X-ray scanning was performed in continuous scan mode in the range 10°–90° (2θ) and a step size of 0.0131°. In addition, the crystallite diameter of nickel was estimated using the Scherrer equation based on the peak broadening of the most intense NiO peak of fresh catalysts."
4,Catalytic activity tests,"2.3 Catalytic activity tests The performance of the catalysts listed in Table 1 was tested for aqueous-phase reforming of methanol (MeOH) in a laboratory-scale system (Fig. 1 ). The catalysts (1.5 g) were loaded in the midsection of a continuously operated tubular stainless steel reactor with 12 mm of inner diameter. The catalysts were reduced in-situ for one hour with a 1:1 mixture of H2 and N2 at atmospheric pressure, and temperature specified in Table 1. Aqueous-phase reforming was conducted at 230 °C and 3.2 MPa. A methanol solution with a mass fraction of 5% was pumped by a HPLC pump (Fig. 1, GA-1) and fed upwards into the reactor (Fig. 1, DC-1) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV, calculated as grams of methanol per hour divided by grams of catalyst) of 2 h−1. Downstream the reactor, nitrogen was fed to strip the products and as an internal standard to determine the production rate of gaseous products. The outlet stream was thereupon cooled down (Fig. 1, HE-1) and separated into gas and liquid phases (Fig. 1, HD-1) at the operating pressure. The outlet streams were sampled every 20 min for approximately 3 h. The gaseous and liquid products were analysed online and offline respectively by gas chromatography (GC). The gases were analysed in a HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph equipped with TCD (Thermal Conductivity Detector) and FID (Flame Ionization Detector), and a Carboxen 1000 column. An Agilent technologies 7890A GC System equipped with a FID and a HP-INNOWax Polyethylene Glycol column was used to analyse the liquid products. The results presented in this study were obtained after 150 min of reaction, when the reaction reached an initial stability. The catalytic performance was evaluated in terms of carbon yield to carbon containing gases (Eq. (6)), product yield (Eq. (7)) and production rate (Eq. (8)). In Eqs. (6)–(8), Y denotes yield, n is mol, i is a compound in the outlet stream different to methanol, C at denotes the number of carbon atoms in molecule i or MeOH, PR is production rate, and m cat denotes the mass of catalyst loaded in the reactor. (6) CtG ( % ) = 100 x ∑ C at out i ⋅ n out i gas ( mol ) C at in MeOH ⋅ n in MeOH ( mol ) (7) Y i ( % ) = 100 x n out i ( mol ) n in MeOH ( mol ) (8) PR = n i ( μmol ) t ⋅ m cat ( min ⋅ g )"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The nominal and measured amounts of metals in the fresh catalysts are summarized in Table 2 . Metal impregnations were less successful on β-SiC because of its lower surface area (Table 3 ). The impregnation success decreased 10% with increasing the nominal nickel from a mass fraction of 10%–15% also due to the low surface are of this support. The bimetallic γ-Al2O3-supported, PtAl, and NiZr reached over 90% of impregnation success, whereas NigAl presented 88% of the nominal nickel. Simultaneous loading of nickel and copper or ceria had no obvious effect on the nickel impregnation success. Copper was deposited on β-SiC and γ-Al2O3 with 86% and 95% of success, respectively. The success of cerium impregnation was significantly lower, 60% in NiCeSi and 70% in NiCeAl. The textural properties of fresh catalysts and pure supports are summarized in Table 3. NiaAl presented low surface area and porosity. Low surface area and mesopores with a broad size distribution in the range of (7–40) nm characterized β-SiC and the catalyst prepared with this material. Metal impregnations on β-SiC increased the surface area due to efficient metal deposition inside the mesopores. Both γ-Al2O3 supports exhibited mesopores, and large surface area and pore volume. Their pore size remained constant after metal impregnation. However, the initial surface area of Engelhard alumina decreased by 10% attributed to partial obstruction of pores. The textural properties of Saint Gobain alumina were unaffected after the impregnation of platinum. This suggests small and well dispersed metal particles due to lower metal loading. Zirconium oxide is characterized by slightly higher surface area than silicon carbide and large pores with narrow size distribution around 11.5 nm. Metal loading decreased the surface area of the support with no effect on the pore diameter and pore volume due to an efficient deposition of nickel inside the pores. X-ray diffractograms of pure β-SiC and its metal-impregnated forms are shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction peaks that characterize β-SiC [40] correspond to a face-centred cubic structure. These peaks were present in the patterns of both pure support and supported catalysts. In addition, the hexagonal structure of α-SiC was detected in the same diffractograms. Catalysts with higher Ni content exhibited more intense NiO peaks. The characteristic peaks of CeO2 were present in the diffractogram of NiCeSi. In contrast, there was no evidence of Cu, CuO or Cu2O in the diffraction pattern of NiCuSi because of the low concentration of impregnated metal and overlap with NiO peaks. Fig. 3 presents the X-ray diffractograms of pure alumina and alumina-supported fresh catalysts. The pattern of NiaAl with well-defined peaks elucidates the high crystallinity of this material. Moreover, the five characteristic diffraction peaks of NiO were identified in Fig. 3a, whereas four NiO peaks were observed in the pattern of γ-alumina-supported catalysts (Fig. 3b). NiO peaks with comparable intensity indicated similar nickel loadings. The diffractograms indicate no evidence of Cu, Ce, and Pt impregnations. This can be attributed to small and well dispersed particles, low metal concentrations and overlap with larger peaks. In accordance with the ZrO2 characterization reported in Ref. [44], both monoclinic and tetragonal phases were identified in pure and modified zirconia (Fig. 4 ). Moreover, the diffraction peaks of NiO were observed in the pattern of nickel on zirconia. Scherrer equation (the original reference can be found in Ref. [45]) was utilized to estimate the crystal size of NiO in fresh catalysts before reduction. The results are summarized in Table 4 . NiO crystals were larger on supports with lower surface area. Accordingly, γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts presented smaller NiO crystals with approximately 8 nm. Higher dispersion can be assumed for small particles on γ-Al2O3 in contrast to the other supports with larger NiO crystals which suggest more aggregated particles [46]. Fig. 5 shows the X-ray diffractograms of γ-alumina-supported, spent catalysts. These diffractograms elucidate a phase change from γ-alumina to boehmite, previously reported [47]. Boehmite was solely identified in Fig. 5, and no obvious presence of remaining γ-alumina was observed."
7,Catalytic activity tests,"3.2 Catalytic activity tests The APR of methanol yielded no liquid products. Unreacted methanol was the only compound observed in the analysis of outlet liquids. The compounds detected in the gas analyses were H2, CH4, C2H6, and CO2 which corroborates the reaction pathway specified in Eqs. (1)–(5). Hydrogen and methane constituted the main products of APR, whereas a minor amount of ethane was produced. Carbon oxides were expected products from methanol reforming and WGS reaction. However, CO was unobserved in the outlet streams. This suggests that carbon monoxide was completely converted to either CO2 in the WGS reaction, CH4 by hydrogenation or C2H6 by FT reaction. Carbon dioxide was detected only when higher amounts of methanol were converted. Carbon oxides might have been partly unquantified due to their higher solubility in water at high pressures, which can result in loss of dissolved gas in the outlet liquid. This may explain carbon balances lower than 100% (Table 5 ). On the other hand, a few experiments had carbon balances between 70% and 80%, which are attributed to analytical errors occurred in the analyses of the outlet liquid. Nevertheless, the data presented in Table 5 is reliable as none of the parameters including carbon yields to carbon containing gases, yields and production rates were calculated considering the composition of the outlet liquid. The α-alumina and β-silicon carbide-supported catalysts exhibited low CtG and hydrogen yields around 1% (Table 5). The zirconia-supported catalyst reached higher CtG than PtAl. However, the hydrogen yield over the zirconia catalyst was lower than over PtAl and significantly lower compared to NigAl. The CtG obtained over PtAl was 1.2%, whereas 3.4% and 4.9% have been previously reported over the same type of catalysts [20,49]. In contrast, NiCeAl yielded 7.0% (Table 5). Hydrogen production achieved the highest values over γ-alumina nickel-based catalysts. For instance, NiCe/γ-Al2O3 produced 85 μmol·min−1·g−1 of hydrogen. The amount was lower over supported platinum, 41.1 μmol·min−1·g−1. Compared to previous studies, these values are superior to the 10 μmol·min−1·g−1 of hydrogen production reported over Pt/γ-alumina and Pt/NaY catalyst [15]. Nonetheless, the residence time of methanol in the catalyst bed was significantly longer. The WHSV that the authors applied was 250 times lower than the WHSV applied for the present work. 3.2.1 The effect of support As presented in Section 3.1, the surface area of the catalysts increased in the order α-Al2O3 < β-SiC < ZrO2 < γ-Al2O3. The NiO crystal size decreased in the same order (Table 4). Following the same trend, the hydrogen yield was higher over catalysts with larger surface area and smaller NiO crystal size (Fig. 6 ). Although NiaAl presented lower surface area and larger NiO crystal size, higher CtG can be attributed to higher nickel content compared to NiSi. Nonetheless, the hydrogen production was less selective than over NiSi. The inert character of β-SiC may have prevented the production of methane. The values of CtG reached 6.5% and 2.7% over NigAl and NiZr respectively, whereas 1.2% was obtained over PtAl. In spite of its high surface area (Section 3.1), the platinum-based catalyst was less active. Nevertheless, this catalyst exhibited high hydrogen selectivity compared to the nickel-based catalysts that commonly favour the production of alkanes, as observed in previous studies [50]. NigAl was more active and yielded three times as much hydrogen as NiZr. Higher performance of alumina-supported has been attributed to the acidity of the support [29]. However, more acidic materials may favour alkane selectivity [51,52] which was also observed in the results presented in Fig. 6 where methane and ethane formation were considerably high over alumina-supported catalysts. Moreover, acidity increases due to the phase change from γ-Al2O3 to boehmite which also results in a decrease of surface area [53] and promotion of dehydration and hydrogenation reactions in detriment of hydrogen production [10,54]. Although the γ-alumina-supported catalysts tested for this work underwent the aforementioned phase change (Fig. 5), no obvious effect on the catalytic performance was observed during the time on stream. The highest conversion and hydrogen yield were achieved over NigAl (Fig. 6). Higher metal loading, larger surface area, and moderate NiO crystal size contributed to the superior performance of γ-alumina-supported nickel. 3.2.2 The effect of promoters In spite of the reported low selectivity and stability of nickel-based catalysts under hydrothermal conditions, they are traditionally applied in APR due to their high activity [55,56]. In addition, activity, selectivity and durability may be enhanced by promotion of nickel with dopants [20]. The following subsections present the results of methanol APR over nickel-based catalysts, doped with copper and cerium. 3.2.2.1 γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts Fig. 7 shows the positive effect of copper and cerium addition on the catalytic performance of alumina-supported catalysts. Although the CtG was lower over NiCuAl than over NigAl, a higher amount of hydrogen was selectively produced over NiCuAl. This resulted in a H2 stream with a lower amount of methane and no ethane. A similar enhancement over copper promoted catalysts has been attributed to the high activity that this metal exhibits for WGS reaction and low activity for methanation [31,32]. The cerium doped catalyst led to higher CtG and 40% higher hydrogen yield than NigAl, whereas, the alkanes yield remained on the same level. Previous studies have explained higher H2 selectivity over nickel-cerium bimetallic catalyst as a consequence of the synergy between Ce with other metals [34]. The Ce-Ni synergy observed in this study resulted in a promotion of the reforming and WGS reactions. Similar effects were reported over ceria and ceria-alumina supported catalysts. The authors attributed the improved performance to oxygen mobility through the ceria lattice and variations in the geometry of nickel crystallites [24,57,58]. The performance enhancement observed in both Cu- and Ce-doped catalysts can be additionally attributed to higher nickel and overall metal content, and a decrease of NiO crystal size (Section 3.1). A slight reduction of Pt-crystal size was similarly observed as a result of a ceria-promotion. This catalyst exhibited higher performance than the non-promoted alumina-supported platinum [59]. The analysis of spent catalyst elucidated a phase change from γ-alumina to boehmite also for the promoted Ni-based catalysts (Fig. 5). Similarly to NigAl, the nickel-copper and nickel-cerium catalyst showed no obvious difference in the performance due to the phase change during the time on stream. 3.2.2.2 β-SiC-supported catalysts β-SiC is defined as mechanically strong, thermally stable, and with chemical and oxidation resistance [60]. These features make β-SiC an attractive support for the APR of oxygenated hydrocarbons considering the common causes of catalyst deactivation, for instance, at hydrothermal, high pressure conditions. Nonetheless, the yields observed over NiSi were inferior to the results achieved over metal oxide-supported catalysts (Section 3.2.1) due to its relative low surface area. To enhance the NiSi performance, higher nickel loading and bimetallic combinations of Ni with Cu and Ce on β-SiC were tested under APR. Fig. 8 shows an increase of the CtG and hydrogen yield due to higher nickel content over NiNiSi. The addition of Cu and Ce had the same effect exhibited by the alumina-supported bimetallic catalyst presented in Section 3.2.2.1. Copper moderately improved the hydrogen yield whereas the methane and ethane production were suppressed. As previously reported, higher production of hydrogen and lower methane production can be attributed to the high activity that Cu exhibits for WGS reaction and low activity for methanation [31,32]. Furthermore, suppression of methane and ethane production resulted from lower hydrogen availability to conduct methanation and FT reaction (Eq. (5)). NiCeSi reached 18 times higher CtG and about 4 times higher hydrogen yield than NiSi. Although the methane yield increased, NiCeSi showed a remarkable selectivity to hydrogen. Ce-doping improved both reforming and WGS reactions, similarly to previous studies over ceria and ceria-alumina supported catalysts [24,57,58]. Those works attributed the performance increase to oxygen mobility through the ceria lattice and variations in the geometry of nickel crystallites. However, the enhancement observed in the Cu- and Ce-promoted catalyst cannot be related to the textural features of the catalysts summarized in Section 3.1. In spite of the more favourable surface properties of NiSi, such as higher surface area, pore volume and diameter, and smaller nickel crystal size (Table 3), the promoted catalysts achieved superior results."
8,Conclusions,"This work aimed at finding an active and hydrogen-selective catalyst for methanol aqueous-phase reforming. High surface area catalysts, such as γ-alumina-supported catalysts, exhibit superior performance compared to catalysts with lower surface area. The addition of Cu or Ce to the Ni-based catalysts enhances their activity. Copper improves the hydrogen selectivity, whereas cerium additionally promotes carbon yield and hydrogen yield. Cerium-promoted nickel on γ-alumina proved to be a suitable catalyst for APR of methanol to produce hydrogen. Therefore, NiCe/γ-Al2O3 constitutes a potential catalyst to minimize the disposal of organic waters derived from biorefineries and to improve the efficiency of biofuel production processes. Nonetheless, further research is encouraged to assess the stability and activity of NiCe/γ-Al2O3 in the APR of other organic compounds contained in biorefinery waters, such as organic acids and longer chain alcohols."
