0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as a promising and sustainable energy carrier for replacing fossil fuels in the future because of its high energy capacity, low-cost and non-polluting nature [1–4]. However, currently around 95% of world's consumption of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels at high temperature process, and the other 5% is produced from water by direct electrolytic method [5–7]. All of the processes are not sustainable and economic solutions, consuming huge amount of energy and leading to a net increase in atmospheric CO2 levels [8]. Therefore, great efforts have been made in the burgeoning research to develop novel techniques and methods for sustainable and economic production of hydrogen from renewable energy [9,10]. In recent years, major efforts have been paid to PC/PEC hydrogen production from water splitting, but the current efficiency of producing hydrogen directly from water splitting is still very low, which is quite far from the practical application [11–15]. Although the addition of sacrificial reagents (e. g. ascorbic acid (AA), Na2S, Na2SO3 and EDTA) put into the catalytic reaction system, can enhance the efficiency to some extent, the improvement is at the cost of non-renewable sacrificial reagents [16–18]. In recent years, hydrogen production from biomass derivatives (e. g. methanol, glycerol, glucose, polysaccharide and etc) has become a very promising strategy from the viewpoint of chemical thermodynamics, as their corresponding standard redox potential range from -0.02 to 0.26V [4,19]. It indicates that biomass derivatives can be more easily oxidized than water, which is a less endergonic process than water oxidation [20–23]. Hence, biomass derivatives can serve as a promoter in the oxidation reaction of the PEC hydrogen production system, which efficiently promote the electron (e−) transfer to the Pt electrodes to product hydrogen. Recently, great efforts have been made in the burgeoning research to hydrogen production from biomass derivatives. Among all the biomass derivative species, the glucose is usually opted as a probe reagent of biomass derivative species, as it is one of main products of photosynthesis, widely presents in the nature and it more easily oxidized than water from the standard thermodynamic data [22]. Although the traditional photocatalytic hydrogen production from glucose solution has been widely studied, few paper reported the hydrogen production from glucose oxidation in the photoelectrochemical system. For example, hydrogen production from PEC glucose oxidation was achieved over a Ni(OH)2 functionalized electro-reduced TiO2 photoanode, presenting low onset potential and high oxidation current density [24]. And production of hydrogen from glucose oxidation by using a WO3-based photoanode coupled with a PV cell has also been reported, and the glucose was ultimately oxidized to a mixture of CO and CO2 [22]. Besides, hierarchical TiO2 nanotube arrays were also synthesized for PEC hydrogen production from glucose oxidation, and enhanced photocurrent density was observed [25]. Despite of the reported achievements, the realization of PEC biomass derivative oxidation to promote hydrogen production is still challenging. In this paper, our work was focused on the PEC glucose oxidation as replacement of water oxidation to promote hydrogen production by using Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode and Pt sheet cathode system (Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt). As-prepared Pd QDs@TNTAs with Schottky-junction structure [26] was demonstrated to be an efficient photoanode for photoelectrocatalytic glucose oxidation, and beneficial for the hydrogen production on the Pt cathode. Furthermore, the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurement of Pd QDs@TNTAs were systematically investigated. Results showed that the Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode exhibited excellent photocurrent response and stability. Finally, the correlated mechanism of PEC biomass derivative oxidation promoting hydrogen production was proposed."
1,Experiment section,
2,Chemical reagents,"2.1 Chemical reagents Pure Ti sheets (99.9% purity, 1mm) were cut into 1.5×5.0cm2 pieces (actual working area of 1.5×2cm2) and used for electrochemical anodic oxidation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), NaI and glucose were all obtained from Aladdin; Palladium chloride (PdCl2), methanol and glycerol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd SCRC, China. All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water used in the synthesis was from local sources."
3,Preparation of Pd QDs on TNTAs photoelectrode,"2.2 Preparation of Pd QDs on TNTAs photoelectrode TNTAs were prepared by a three-step electrochemical anodic oxidation procedure according to the literature [18,25,27]. (Please see the detailed preparation procedure for TNTAs in the Supplementary Data). Besides, the normal TiO2 NTs prepared by a one-step anodization in the same electrolyte for 5min were used as control photoanode. And then, the deposition of Pd QDs on the as-prepared TNTAs substrate electrode was achieved by using palladium chloride (PdCl2) as a precursor via the modified hydrothermal method. A 13mL solution consisting of 800mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 9mg palladium chloride (PdCl2) and 300mg NaI was transferred to a 25mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave [18]. The sealed vessel was then heated at 180°C for 1.5h. After that, the sample electrodes were rinsed with ethanol for several times and dried with N2 blow."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods The chemical compositions of the as-prepared Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Ultra HSA, Kratos Analytical Ltd. UK) under ultrahigh vacuum (< 10−8 torr) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source operating at 150W. The survey and high-resolution spectra were collected at fixed analyzer pass energies of 160 and 20eV, respectively. Samples were mounted in floating mode in order to avoid differential charging. Binding energies were referenced to the C 1s binding energy of adventitious carbon contamination which was set at 284.6eV. The amount of Pd QDs on the TNTAs was measured. The morphologies of nanotubular structures and distribution of quantum dots were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitach S-4800, Japan). Detailed microstructural features of the sample electrodes were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2100, JEOL, Japan). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded by Avalight-DHS UV–vis absorbance measurement (Avantes, Netherlands). The crystalline structures of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer, Bruker, Germany), using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.540598Å)."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements and PEC hydrogen production,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements and PEC hydrogen production The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with a quartz window to facilitate irradiation of the photoelectrode surface. All the electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CHI, USA) at the room temperature. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a Pt foil were served as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in dark and under irradiation at open circuit voltage over a frequency range from 105 to 10−1 Hz with an AC voltage at 10mV. And Mott-Schottky plots were obtained at a fixed frequency of 1kHz to determine the flat-band potential and carrier density. The electrolyte was 0.05molL−1 Na2SO4 solution (pH=7.0). The detailed photocurrent response and open circuit photovoltage measurement were performed in 0.5molL−1 KOH electrolyte (pH=13.7) with or without glucose solution. A 300W Xe high-pressure short-arc xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, PerfectLight Technology Co, Ltd. Beijing) was used as light source. The intensity of the light source was calibrated with a Si diode (Newport) to simulate solar light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100mWcm−2). The detailed hydrogen production from PEC glucose oxidation experiment was carried out in a gas-closed circulation system (PerfectLight Technology Co, Ltd. Beijing) equipped with a home-made three-electrode photoelectrochemical 2-compartment photoreactor and a volumetric device with a vacuum line, in which the photoanode and cathode chamber were separated by a glass frit membrane. The volume of the electrolyte was 100mL consisting of 0.5molL−1 KOH with /without 0.1molL−1 glucose, and as-prepared Pd QDs@TNTAs and SCE were used as the photoanode and the reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was purged with N2 for 30min to remove O2 prior to the experiment. Gas generated in the Pt sheet cathode at -0.3V vs. SCE was collected and detected by an online gas chromatography (GC) with a thermal conductivity detector."

7,Fabrication and photoelectrochemical performance of Pd QDs@TNTAs photoelectrode,"3.1 Fabrication and photoelectrochemical performance of Pd QDs@TNTAs photoelectrode Scheme S1 presents the fabrication procedure of Pd QDs@TNTAs photoelectrode. The detailed synthesis and experiment process is described in the experiment section of Supplementary Data. Briefly, a pristine Ti sheet (Scheme S1a) was first anodized in two-electrode system and the as-grown TiO2 NTs (Scheme S1b) were removed by ultrasonication, leaving behind on the surface of the Ti sheet with ordered hexagonal imprints pattern (Scheme S1c). And then a second step of anodization and ultrasonication removal of the TiO2 NTs layer was carried out again (Scheme S1d and e). The Ti sheet with the imprints was then subject to the third step of anodization to yield uniform TiO2 NTs layer with unique nanostructure, which consisted of a periodically well-ordered porous top nanostructure and vertically aligned bottom tubular arrays (Scheme S1f). After anodization, the prepared TNTAs sample was annealed in air at 450°C for crystallization. Finally, the quantum sized Pd nanoparticles were subsequently assembled on TNTAs by using modified hydrothermal method (Scheme S1g). To understand the effect of glucose and optimize PEC activity for glucose oxidization over the Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode, the linear sweeping voltammograms (LSVs) curve was recorded in 0.5molL−1 KOH solution containing glucose with the concentration of 0.1molL−1 and is presented in Fig. 1 a. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Pd QDs@TNTAs showed higher current density in the glucose (0.17mAcm−2) than that of without glucose (0.06mAcm−2) under the dark condition at 0.9V (vs. SCE). This inferred that the electro-oxidation of glucose occurs at the surface of Pd QDs@TNTAs at -0.3V (vs. SCE). Under the simulated solar light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100mWcm−2), the photocurrent density was enhanced to 1.87mAcm−2 in presence of glucose at 0.9V (vs. SCE). Results indicated that the glucose can be easier oxidized under irradiation. Moreover, the significant enhancement of photocurrent density was obtained by the LSVs, presumably due to transient photocurrent response which was composed of capacitive and faradaic current, especially when the scan rate was not slow enough, the portion of capacitive current could not be ignored [28]. In order to separate the capacitive and faradaic current, anodic steady-state photocurrent density was measured by the Chronamperometric i-t. Chronoamperometric i-t curves of Pd QDs@TNTAs in absence and presence of glucose under periodical light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100mWcm−2) were also recorded and are presented (Fig. 1b). Results showed splendid stability, and the photocurrent density in the steady-state reached 1.11mAcm−2. The distinguished photoelectrochemical activity of Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode results from as-prepared sample electrode which possesses unique optical absorption property and photoelectrochemical performance. The UV-DRS of the normal TiO2 NTs, TNTAs and Pd QDs@TNTAs were recorded and are presented in Fig. 2 a. In the UV region, TiO2 NTs presented a continuous absorption band from 200 to 385nm, corresponding to the 3.22eV band gap. Lately, it has been reported that periodic porous layers on the top of TNTAs can serve as photonic crystal, with much stronger light absorption in visible light and infrared region than that of normal TiO2 NTs [25,27,29,30]. After Pd QDs were loaded on the TNTAs, the Pd QDs@TNTAs sample showed strong light absorption in both the UV regions (200–400nm) and visible regions (>400nm), due to the absorption of Pd nanoparticles which is dependent on the size and shape of the particles and the good dispersion on the surface of TNTAs substrate electrode [31,32]. The photocurrent response of Pd QDs@TNTAs photoelectrode under the simulated solar light irradiation was compared with that of the normal TiO2 NTs and TNTAs. Fig. 2b illustrated the LSVs of as-prepared photoelectrodes in 0.5molL−1 KOH at the scan rate of 5mVs−1. The dark scans collected in the potential range between -1.1V and 0.9V revealed that the photocurrent densities of all photoelectrodes were almost negligible, with a small background current of ∼10−8 Acm−2. Upon the simulated solar light irradiation, all of as-prepared photoelectrodes showed distinct photocurrent response. Notably, Pd QDs@TNTAs photoelectrode exhibited largest photocurrent density than that of normal TiO2 NTs and pure TNTAs. These results confirmed that the positive role of Pd QDs in enhancing the photoactivity of TNTAs substrate electrode. And it can be further concluded that the Schottky-junction between the noble metal (Pd) and semiconductor (TNTAs) facilitated the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. In addition, the photo-to-current conversion efficiency was also considered (η, PCE, Fig. S1). The detailed calculation process is described in the Supplementary Data [33]. Among all the samples tested, Pd QDs@TNTAs achieved the maximum η of 8.70 % at a bias potential of 0.6V (vs. SCE), which was higher than that of normal TiO2 NTs (4.66%) and TNTAs (7.15%), respectively. To examine the instant photocurrent response for the pure TiO2 NTs, TNTAs and Pd QDs@TNTAs, chronoamperomertic i-t curves were recorded and are present under periodical light irradiation (Fig. 2c). Compared to the photocurrent densities of the normal TiO2 NTs (0.28mAcm−2) and TNTAs (0.40mAcm−2), the average value of photocurrent densities of Pd QDs@TNTAs reached 0.50mA cm−2 and was very stable even after 5 period cycles, which was consistent with the values obtained from the LSV results. This further indicated the excellent photocurrent response stability and photoelectrochemial activity of as-prepared Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode. To reveal the excellent optical absorption property and PEC performance of the Pd QDs@TNTAs electrode, a series of physical and chemical characterizations of the as-prepared materials were carried out. Fig. 3 a shows a typical SEM image of TNTAs in which periodical nanoporous structure with high uniformity, with an average diameter of the hexagonal pores at ∼ 120nm and a wall-thickness of ∼ 40nm. And the tubes were very smooth, with an average tube length of only about ∼ 400nm (Fig. 3b). It is worth mentioning that the ordered TNTAs possessing large porosity were rationally synthesized onto substrate electrode, which was highly favorable for uniform deposition of nano-sized particles onto the surface and side wall of substrate electrode. After using modified hydrothermal method, the quantum-sized Pd nanoparticles were homogeneously assembled onto the surface of substrate electrode (Fig. 3c). The Pd QDs were uniformly assembled onto the outer wall of the vertically aligned nanotubes, with an average size of 4.25±0.5nm (Fig. 3d and Fig. S2). As evidenced in Fig. 3c and d, the integrity of nanotubular structures was retained and not influenced by the hydrothermal processing. The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed that the Ti, O and Pd existed in the surface of as-prepared samples electrode (Fig. S3). A representative TEM image of Pd QDs@TNTAs is shown in Fig. 3e, indicating that quantum-sized of Pd nanoparticles was uniform distributed over the entire surface of TNTAs, both inside (Fig. 3f, inset image) and outside (Fig. 3g). The average lattice spacing of 0.35 and 0.22nm corresponds to the (101) and (111) plane of anatase TiO2 and metallic Pd, respectively (Fig. 3h). The surface chemical state of Pd QDs@TNTAs was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 4 ). As shown in Fig. 4, the Pd 3d region consisted of the doublet peaks at 335.6 and 340.9eV for Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, which could be assigned to Pd0 and Pd2+, respectively. The peak interval between Pd 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 was 4.7eV and the intensity ratio of Pd 3d5/2 to Pd 3d3/2 was 3/2, which was consistent with theoretical calculation. The presence of Pd0 indicated that metallic Pd was deposited onto the surface of TNTAs, while the presence of Pd2+ implied the existence of PdO, possibly from surface oxidation of Pd metal [18,30,34,35]. Besides, the XRD results showed that the diffraction peaks at 2θ=25.5° and 37.9° were assigned to the (101) and (004) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively (Fig. S5). However, the diffraction peak of metallic Pd cannot be found, probably because of its small size and less deposition. To explore the origin of the significantly enhanced PEC performance of the Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode material, open circuit photo-voltage decay (OCPD) was shown in Fig. 5 a. The OCPD technique can be applied to assess the lifetime of photoelectrons and to evaluate the recombination rate of the photogenerated electro-hole charge carries, which consists of turning off the irradiation at a steady state and monitoring the subsequent decay of photovoltage (V oc) with time [25]. The V oc decay rate is closely related to the photoelectron lifetime, as formulated by the following equation [30]: τ=(k B T/e)(dV oc/dt)−1 where τ is the potential-dependent photoelectron lifetime, k B is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, e is the charge of a single electron, and V oc is the open-circuit voltage at time t. The calculated photoelectron lifetime as a function of V oc is shown in Fig. 5b. Owing to the presence of Schottky-junction, Pd QDs@TNTAs demonstrates remarkably prolonged electron lifetime in comparison with TiO2 NTs and TNTAs, leading to the significantly enhanced PEC glucose oxidation promoting hydrogen production. The interfacial properties between the electrode (i.e., normal TiO2 NTs, TNTAs and Pd QDs@TNTAs) and the electrolyte were scrutinized by EIS measurements, which were utilized to probe the separation efficiency of the charge carriers [33,36]. Typical Nyquist plot for sample electrodes was shown in Fig. 6 a. The measured resistance was composed of the ionic resistance of electrolyte, the intrinsic resistance of the active material electrode, and the contact resistance (charge transfer resistance) at the active material/substrate electrode interface. The semicircle in the Nyquist plot at high frequency was characteristic of the charge transfer process and the diameter of the semicircle reflects the charge-transfer resistance [30,33]. As shown in Fig. 6a, the arches for Pd QDs@TNTAs both in the dark and under light irradiation in the 0.05molL−1 Na2SO4 solution were with smallest semicircle diameter among all the sample electrodes, implying that modification with Pd QDs on the TNTAs significantly enhanced the electron mobility by reducing the recombination of electron-hole pairs. Fig. 6b presents the Mott-Schottky plots of 1/C 2 as a function of the applied potential, from which the slopes of the linear parts of the curves in the Mott-Schottky plot are positive, indicating its n-type feature. Furthermore, the linear parts of the curves were extrapolated to 1/C 2 =0 to estimate the values of E FB (Eq. (3)). The values of EFB,Na2SO4 are estimated to be -0.479, -0.461 and -0.294V (vs. SCE) for the normal TiO2 NTs, TNTAs and Pd QDs@TNTAs, respectively. Notably, compared to TiO2 NTs and TNTAs, a positive shift of E FB in Pd QDs@TNTAs demonstrated a decrease in bending of the band edge, and thus facilitating the electron transfer. It should be noted that a shift to cathodic direction of 59mVpH−1 takes place by increasing the pH value of the electrolyte solution. Herein, according to the conversion formula: EFB,KOH =(13.7-7)×0.059+EFB,Na2SO4. The conversion values of EFB,KOH were calculated to be -0.874, -0.856 and -0.689V (vs. SCE) for the normal TiO2 NTs, TNTAs and Pd QDs@TNTAs in KOH electrolyte, The obtained results were consistent with the result of photocurrent density of LSVs. The carrier density (ND) could be calculated from Fig. 6b, and the detailed calculation process is described in the Supplementary Data [18,30]. The N D values of TiO2 NTs, TNTAs and Pd QDs@TNTAs were determined to be 1.53×1018, 1.93×1018 and 2.05×1018 cm−3, respectively. Consequently, the higher N D of Pd QDs@TNTAs signified a faster carrier transfer than that in TiO2 NTs and TNTAs. Therefore, it is expected that the excellent PEC activity of Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt in glucose oxidation system to promote hydrogen production can be achieved."
8,PEC glucose oxidation to promote hydrogen production,"3.2 PEC glucose oxidation to promote hydrogen production Although many biomass derivatives are used as probe molecules, simple biofuel sources such as methanol and glycerol are better suited for direct use in alcohol fuel cells or as fuel additives in combustion, which were not ideal biomass derivatives for PEC oxidation to promote hydrogen production [5,22,25]. Compared to the simple biomass sources, glucose is a well-recognized probe molecule of biomass derivatives that is inexpensive, renewable and is produced from polysaccharide and complex biomass derivatives with fewer processing steps, and hence the lower cost [37,38]. Based on the standard redox potential of biomass derivatives, the glucose could be oxidized at Pd QDs@TNTAs photoelectrode with higher redox potential compared to complex length carbon chain sucrose and soluble starch. Herein, the remainder of this work focused on PEC oxidation of glucose as a potentially biomass derivatives probe molecules to promote hydrogen production. The detailed PEC glucose oxidation and hydrogen production experiments were conducted in a 0.5molL−1 KOH solution containing 0.1molL−1 glucose (100mL) in the constant temperature at 25°C. It was found that a large number of gas bubbles were observed at the Pt sheet cathode at bias potential of -0.3V for 6h (Fig. S6). To identify the composition of the gas phase, the gas production from cathode (Pt sheet) was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The GC results exhibited that the gas phase product at the Pt cathode was hydrogen (Fig. S7). It proved the feasibility of PEC glucose oxidation to promote hydrogen production over Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt system. The effects of different photoanodes were also investigated for solar-driven PEC glucose oxidation to promote hydrogen production in Fig. 7 . Under the simulated solar light irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100mVcm−2), the highest hydrogen production rate of Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt reached 164.8μmolcm−2 at bias potential of -0.3V (vs. SCE), which was about 3.12 and 2.26 times faster than that of the normal TiO2 NTs/Pt and TNTAs/Pt system, respectively. Furthermore, the amount of hydrogen produced over Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt under the different experiment condition and electrolyte solution was recorded and is presented in Table 1 , respectively. As shown in Table 1, in the pure H2O system, the amount of hydrogen produced from water splitting via PEC and PC process was almost the same (11.04 and 10.96μmolcm−2). And the EC water splitting for hydrogen production was nearly negligible in the catalytic water splitting system. It could be inferred that the PC process was dominant for hydrogen production from water splitting. However, in the pure 0.5molL−1 KOH electrolyte, the amount of hydrogen produced from the PC, EC and PEC process over Pd QDs@TNTAs was about 15.80, 16.72 and 32.43μmolcm−2, respectively. Interestingly, with 0.1molL−1 glucose was added into the KOH electrolyte, the hydrogen production rate reached as high as 164.8μmolcm−2 from PEC glucose oxidation over Pd QDs@TNTAs, which was about 3.37 and 4.05 times higher than that of pure PC and EC reaction. Compared with sole PC or EC, the significant enhancement of hydrogen production was obtained in PEC process, which could be attributed to the synergistic PEC performance combining both the advantage of PC and EC activity. It could be further inferred that the photo-generated holes (h+) and hydroxyl radicals can easily oxidize glucose and efficiently promote e− to transfer to Pt cathode for hydrogen production. Besides, the Schottky barrier formed between the Pt cathode and photoanode could serve as an efficient electron trap to prevent photo-generated electron-hole recombination, and facilitate the photocatalytic reaction. Similar work concerning hydrogen production from glucose biofuel cells has been summarized by Fujishima et al. [39], in which significant improvement of 30% in overall hydrogen generation was obtained in the presence of glucose. A recycling experiment of PEC glucose oxidation to promote hydrogen production over the Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt system was investigated to evaluate PEC stability of photoanode material. In order to examine the reproducibility of photoanode and remove the dissolved gas in every 6h, the Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode was drawn from the glucose solution, and rinsed with distilled water. Then it was used for next run reaction. Fig. 8 shows a typical reaction time course for H2 production over Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt under the simulated solar light irradiation. The initial H2 production rate reached 164.8μmolcm−2 . In the next run, the rate of hydrogen production slightly declined. However, the hydrogen production rate still remained as 160.5μmolcm−2 after the third run. The decrement in the hydrogen production rate might be related to the deactivation of the photoelectrocatalyst or was attributed to the consumption of the sacrificial reagents in the solution [13]. The glucose oxidation in the PEC hydrogen production process was verified using total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer to measure the decomposition of glucose. The detailed calculation process is described in the Supplementary Data. As known in Table 2 , the glucose was oxidized to CO2 and CO over Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode. Furthermore, the consumed amount of glucose reached 92% at bias potential of -0.3V (vs. SCE) over Pd QDs@TNTAs after 6h solar light irradiation, which was nearly 1.58 and 1.39 times higher than that of the normal TiO2 NTs and TNTAs photoelectrode, respectively. This result further confirmed that the Schottky-junction formed between the noble metal Pd and TNTAs could effectively promote the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, and thus enhance the photocatalytic activity markedly. Accordingly, a possible reaction mechanism for PEC biomass derivative (denoted as CxHyOz) oxidation to promote hydrogen generation in basic condition over Pd QDs@TNTAs/Pt system is discussed in Scheme 1 as well as the following equations [5,26]. Specifically, from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the glucose could be easier oxidized with less endergonic process than water oxidation. When Pd QDs@TNTAs photoanode was irradiated by simulated solar light, photoelectrons were rapidly photoexcited from the valence band (VB) of TNTAs to its conduction band (CB), leaving photo-generated holes (h+) in the VB (Eq. (1)). Due to the presence of large amounts of OH− which is a well-known efficient hole scavenger, thus h+ may first react with OH− to generate hydrogen radicals (OH•) (Eq. (2)) which has stronger oxidative ability than h+, and reacts further with the glucose and intermediate products to CO2 and H2O (Eq. (3)). Furthermore, the electrons can be readily injected into the Femi level of Pd QDs because the work function (φm =5.12) of noble metal Pd is higher than that of semiconductor TiO2 (φs =3.87) [40,41]. Meanwhile, additional bias potential is usually applied to the photoelectrocatalytic system to effectively suppress the depletion of photoelectron in the space charge region, and to promote photoelectron to the Pt cathode for hydrogen production (Eq. (4)). The chemical reactions at the surface of photoanode and cathode are proposed as follows [5,6]: (1) Photoanode: TiO2 + hv →TiO2*+e− +h+ (2) h+ +OH− →OH C x H y O z +(4x + y -2z)OH (3) → xCO2 +(2x+y-z) H2O (4) Cathode: 2H2O+2e− →H2 +2OH− (5) Total: C x H y O z +(2x - z)H2O→ xCO2 +(2x – z +(y/2))H2"
9,CONCLUSIONS,"In summary, this work has demonstrated the PEC glucose to promote hydrogen production over Pd QDs@ TNTAs/Pt system, which is much efficient than those by pure water oxidation. The results showed that the PEC hydrogen production rate reached 164.8μmolcm−2 over Pd QDs@TNTAs, which was 4.05 and 3.38 time higher than that of sole EC and PC, respectively. Additionally, a probable reaction mechanism for PEC biomass derivatives oxidation to promote hydrogen production was proposed. Therefore, this work could lead to a new opportunity for utility of low-cost and efficient method in renewables-to-hydrogen conversion."
