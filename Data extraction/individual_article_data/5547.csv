0,Introduction,"In recent years, many techniques have been developed and used to prepare nanofibers such as self-assembly [1,2], dry and wet spinning [3], phase separation [4], melt spinning [5], electrospinning [5–9], etc. Among them, electrospinning is a relatively simple and effective technique which utilizes applied electrostatic force to overcome the liquid surface tension and thus produce fibers with diameters ranging from several nanometers to micrometers [10]. Theoretically, polymer solutions with higher conductivity and lower surface tension tend to form uniform nanofibers by electrospinning [6,11–13]. The nonwoven electrospun nanofibers are structurally similar to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and thus nanofibers have great potential in the field of tissue engineering [14]. Because of the large surface area-to-volume ratio, high porosity, and good flexibility, electrospun nanofibers of natural and synthetic polymers can be also used as scaffolds for other applications including drug delivery, filtration, enzyme immobilization, and biosensors [15]. Chitosan, a linear basic polysaccharide composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine by β-(1–4)-linkage, is derived from the deacetylation of chitin which is obtained from cell walls of fungi and crustaceans [16]. Due to its non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and antimicrobial activity, chitosan has been used in wound healing [17], drug delivery systems [18], wastewater treatment [19], and various tissue engineering applications [9,20–22]. Gelatin, a protein substance which contains high contents of glycine, proline, and 4-hydroxyproline, is a natural water-soluble polymer produced by the partial hydrolysis of collagen and is widely used as a biomaterial for tissue engineering applications [23,24]. Chitosan and gelatin can be dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-isopropanol (HFIP) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and then fabricated into nanofibers by electrospining [25,26]. However, these toxic and corrosive organic solvents or their residues may remain in the final nanofibers, thus becoming potential hazards. Geng et al. reported that 7wt% chitosan with a molecular weight of about 106kDa dissolved in concentrated (90%) acetic acid aqueous solution could be electrospun into nanofibers [13]. Other researchers successfully manufactured chitosan or gelatin nanofibers by adding water soluble polymer such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and surfactants to assist fiber formation [27–29]. In order to make the manufacturing process more environment friendly, in this study, chitosan and gelatin were dissolved in an acetic acid solution containing a substantial amount of PVA to produce hybrid nanofibers by electrospinning without using any toxic or corrosive organic solvents such as TFA or HFIP. Because the morphology and diameters of electrospun nanofibers depend on the properties of the solution (such as the concentration, viscosity, surface tension, electrical conductivity, etc.) and process parameters (such as the applied electric field, feed flow rate, inner diameter of the needle, etc.), the optimum conditions of eletrospinning were investigated. Next, stability, thermal and mechanical properties of the nanofibrous mats formed by these electrospun nanofibers were determined. Finally, mesenchymal stem cells (KP-hMSCs) [30] were cultured on the nanofibrous mats and porous sponges to study the cytocompatibility of these materials with different surface morphology. Our results suggest that the electrospun chitosan–gelatin–PVA hybrid nanofibrous mats have great potential in biomedical and related applications."
1,Experimental procedures,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (with a molecular weight of about 300kDa and a degree of deacetylation of about 90%) was purchased from Kiotek (Taipei, Taiwan). Gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other solvents and reagents used were of reagent grade."
3,Preparation and analysis of chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions,"2.2 Preparation and analysis of chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions To prepare the chitosan-gelatin solution, gelatin was dissolved in water, followed by the addition of chitosan powder to the solution. After uniform dispersion of the chitosan powders, acetic acid was added to dissolve the chitosan and thus a mixed solution of chitosan and gelatin was obtained. A homogeneous chitosan–gelatin–PVA solution was obtained by mixing well a separately prepared PVA solution with the chitosan-gelatin solution. Table 1 summarizes the compositions and abbreviations of the various chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions used in this study. The viscosity, electrical conductivity and surface tension of these solutions were measured."
4,Electrospinning process to prepare hybrid nanofibers,"2.3 Electrospinning process to prepare hybrid nanofibers Various concentrations of chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions were used to fabricate hybrid nanofibers using an electrospinning unit (Jyi-Goang Enterprise, Taipei, Taiwan). The chitosan–gelatin–PVA solution was loaded in a 3mL syringe. The flow rate (0.15–0.3mL/h) was controlled by a syringe pump. A high electric voltage (15–30kV) was applied between a horizontal 23G needle tip (emitting electrode) and a vertical collector (ground electrode) at a distance of 15cm. The environment temperature and relative humidity were respectively controlled to 30°C and 40%. The resultant nanofibers were carefully removed from the collector for further treatment."
5,Preparation of porous sponges,"2.4 Preparation of porous sponges For comparison with nanofibrous mats, the chitosan–gelatin–PVA solution was used to fabricate porous sponges using a freeze-gelation method [31,32]. Briefly, the chitosan–gelatin–PVA solution was placed in a mold and frozen at −40°C. Four hours later, the frozen solution was soaked in NaOH/ethanol solution at −20°C for 6h, followed by immersion in ethanol for 2h and then washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After serial dehydration with ethanol and critical-point drying, porous chitosan–gelatin–PVA sponges were obtained."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization 2.5.1 Morphology of nanofibers and sponges The prepared nanofibers and sponges were dried in a vacuum oven (HDOV-30, Deng Yng, Taipei, Taiwan) at 40°C for 1h to remove the residual solvent and moisture. After sputter-coating with gold, the morphology of vacuum-dried electrospun nanofibers and sponges was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, Oregon, USA). The suggested working voltage and distance of SEM were 5kV and 5mm, respectively. 2.5.2 Cross-linking to enhance the stability of nanofibers To enhance stability, the electrospun nanofibrous mats were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde vapor for 0, 6, 12, and 24h (termed GA0, GA6, GA12 and GA24), and then rinsed in 0.1M glycine for 3h. The crosslinked mats were vacuum-dried overnight, and then their initial dry weights (W i) were measured. Next, the mats were immersed in PBS at 37°C with constant shaking. After 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of incubation, the mats were again vacuum-dried overnight and weighed the final dry weights (W f). The remaining weights were used as an index of the stability of the nanofibrous mats in an aqueous environment. The remaining weight percentage for each mat was calculated using the following formula: Remaining weight percentage ( % ) = W f W i × 100 2.5.3 Mechanical and thermal properties The electrospun nanofibers were collected on hydrophobic glass slides pretreated with dichlorodimethylsilane. After 8h, the nanofibrous mats were removed from the surface of the glass slides and cut into a dog-bone shape. The mechanical properties including the tensile strength and elongation of mats were measured with a tensile strength instrument (model LRX, Lloyd, Hampshire, UK). The stretching rate of the measurement was 10mm/min. In this study, the tensile strength (the maximum load divided by dry weight of each sample, N/g) was used to represent the mechanical strength of each sample. Besides, the thermal properties of the nanofibers were determined using a Q20 differential scanning calorimeter (TA instrument, Delaware, USA). Each sample (5–10mg) was placed in an aluminum pan and heated from 50 to 250°C at a rate of 10°C/min. The flow rate of nitrogen gas was fixed at 50mL/min."
7,Cytocompatibility of the nanofibrous mats,"2.6 Cytocompatibility of the nanofibrous mats Mesenchymal stem cells (KP-hMSCs) [30] were cultured in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (LG-DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics in a 5% CO2/95% air incubator with saturated humidity at 37°C. As the cell density in the culture flask reached about 90% confluence, PBS containing trypsin/EDTA was added to detach the cells. Suspended cells were harvested and then seeded onto the surface of the mats with a seeding density of 2×104 cells per sample (size: 2.2cm in diameter). After 3 and 7 days of incubation, the total amount of cellular proteins of KP-hMSCs cultured on various nanofibrous mats was measured with a Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) to indirectly determine the cell number of KP-hMSCs. The activity of KP-hMSCs was measured by a 3-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells were incubated with an MTT medium (0.5mg/mL in LG-DMEM) at 37°C for 3h. Living cells were able to reduce the yellow tetrazolium MTT to an intracellular dark-blue formazan product. Then, 1mL of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan. The optical density of the formazan product was measured using a 96-well microplate reader (BioTek, USA) at a wavelength of 570nm."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of various chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions,"3.1 Characterization of various chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions It is crucial to characterize the physical properties of various chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions, because the electrospinnability of the solutions is highly associated with these properties. Chitosan has many amino groups (NH2) on its backbone, and the repulsive forces rise when the amino groups are protonated, thus reducing the electrospinnability by obstructing chain entanglements [33]. Gelatin, a proteinaceous substance, can interact with the amino groups of chitosan and affect the characteristics of the chitosan-gelatin solution. Moreover, PVA can interact with chitosan and gelatin through hydrogen bonds and thus assist the formation of hybrid nanofibers by electrospinning. So the electrospinnability of the chitosan–gelatin–PVA solutions of various compositions can be assessed by measuring the viscosity, electrical conductivity, and surface tension of the solution. As a solvent, the concentration of acetic acid was also varied to determine its influence. In one group, sodium chloride (NaCl) was added to enhance the electrical conductivity of the solution. These results are summarized in Table 2 . The viscosity of the chitosan–gelatin–PVA solution was mainly determined by the chitosan concentration [34]. The viscosity of the chitosan–gelatin–PVA (3:3:3-A2) solution was too high (16,575±192cP) to flow through the needle, so the 3:3:3-A2 nanofibers could not be produced by electrospinning. To decrease the viscosity of the solution, the concentrations of chitosan, gelatin, and PVA were all decreased to 2wt%, and three different concentrations of acetic acid (2, 20, and 70wt%) were tested, namely 2:2:2-A2, 2:2:2-A20, and 2:2:2-A70 solutions. The viscosity of these three mixed solutions substantially decreased after lowering the polymer concentrations because the number of intermolecular entanglements was reduced. By increasing the concentration of acetic acid from 2 to 70wt%, the electrical conductivity and surface tension were decreased (Table 2). However, the electrospinnability of 2:2:2-A2 and 2:2:2-A20 solutions was poor, only the 2:2:2-A70 solution was electrospinnable, but a concentrated acetic acid solution was required (see Section 3.2 for more details). In order to reduce the amount of acetic acid used, we attempted to increase the concentration of PVA to 4wt% (with chitosan and gelatin remaining at 2wt%) to improve the electrospinnability. Four different 2:2:4 solutions were prepared with various concentrations of acetic acid, as shown in Table 2. When increasing the acetic acid content from 2 to 6 and then to 20wt%, the viscosity firstly decreased from 4701±50 to 2770±31cP and then increased to 4010±29cP, indicating that the molecular interactions in these solutions were manifold and thus their viscosity behavior was complicated. On the other hand, the electrical conductivity decreased from 3.24±0.02 to 3.11±0.01 and then to 2.68±0.04mS/cm as the concentration of acetic acid increased from 2 to 6 and 20wt%. Rinaudo et al. reported that the conductivity of chitosan in acetic acid solution decreased with increasing acetic acid concentration when the molar concentration of acetic acid exceeded that of chitosan's monomeric units [35]. The decreasing conductivity of gelatin solutions at higher acetic acid concentration was also observed by Vieira et al. and the phenomenon could be ascribed to the formation of ionic complexes [36]. In the present study, the molar concentration of acetic acid was always higher than that of chitosan's monomeric units (2wt% acetic acid and 2wt% chitosan equivalent to 0.33M and 0.12M respectively), and we observed that the conductivity of chitosan–gelatin–PVA solution decreased as the acetic acid concentration increased (Table 2). Therefore, our data are consistent with these two studies [35,36]. As for surface tension, there was no remarkable difference among these 2:2:4 solutions."
10,Preparation of hybrid nanofibers by electrospinning,"3.2 Preparation of hybrid nanofibers by electrospinning The applied voltage and flow rate of the solution are important parameters in the electrospinning process. Fiber formation occurs only when the applied voltage exceeds the threshold voltage, but a higher applied voltage may result in more spindle- or bead-like fibers [37]. On the other hand, the flow rate affects the jet formation and evaporation of the solvent. In horizontal electrospinning, the solution formed a big drop rather than a Taylor cone at the needle tip and dripped down at a high feed flow rate, so the amount of nanofibers collected at a high feed flow rate was low especially at a low applied voltage (data not shown). Fig. 1 shows SEM images of electrospun 2:2:2-A2, 2:2:2-A20, and 2:2:2-A70 nanofibers at an applied voltage of 20kV. The flow rates and working distance were maintained at 0.3mL/h and 15cm, respectively. It was found that the electrospinnability of 2:2:2-A2 and 2:2:2-A20 solutions were very poor, and many beads rather than nanofibers were obtained. However, 2:2:2-A70 nanofibers were successfully fabricated by electrospinning when the concentration of acetic acid was increased to 70wt%. This could have been due to more acetic acid molecules bound to cationic chitosan in 70wt% acetic acid, which thus reduced the repulsive forces among the biopolymers and favored nanofiber formation. Nevertheless, the use of a concentrated (70wt%) acetic acid solution was not environment friendly. In order to reduce the amount of acetic acid used, we attempted to increase the concentration of PVA to 4wt% (with chitosan and gelatin kept at 2wt%) to improve the electrospinnability. 2:2:4-A2 nanofibers could be produced by electrospinning at a lower applied voltage and a feed flow rate below 0.3mL/h, but some beads and spindle-like structures were seen (Fig. 2(a)). As for the effect of salt, it was reported that the addition of salt increases the electrical conductivity of the solution and receives smooth and thin nanofibers [38]. When adding some sodium chloride to enhance the conductivity of the solution, the morphology of 2:2:4-A2-S0.2 nanofibers produced by electrospinning at an applied voltage of 20kV and a constant flow rate of 0.3mL/h was very similar to that of 2:2:4-A2 nanofibers, as shown in Fig. 2(b). There were still some beads present in the nanofibers. In this case, the addition of sodium chloride did not benefit the electrospinning too much. A possible reason could be that the 2:2:4-A2-S0.2 solution already contained sufficient charges (from chitosan and gelatin), and increasing the conductivity of the solution was not crucial or beneficial. In order to diminish the formation of beads during the electrospinning process, more-concentrated acetic acid might be needed to prepare the chitosan–gelatin–PVA solution. There were still many spindle-like structures obtained in the SEM images of 2:2:4-A6 probably due to the lower viscosity, as shown in Fig. 2(c). However, when the concentration of acetic acid increased to 20wt%, there were no beads obtained in 2:2:4-A20 nanofibers. Uniform nanofibers were successfully produced by electrospinning at lower applied voltages (15–20kV) and flow rate (0.3mL/h) with resultant fiber diameters of around 150nm (Fig. 2(d)). When the applied voltage was higher than 25kV, however, more spindle- or bead-like structures appeared (data not shown). Taken together, with the use of mild concentration (20wt%) of acetic acid, the 2:2:4 nanofibers could be successfully produced by electrospinning, so 2:2:4-A20 nanofibrous mats were selected and used in the following experiments."
11,Effects of crosslinking on the stability and mechanical properties of mats,"3.3 Effects of crosslinking on the stability and mechanical properties of mats To further enhance the stability and mechanical properties of the nanofibers, the 2:2:4-A20 mats were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde vapor for 0–24h. The stability of the mats was indicated by the remaining weight percentages of mats at each time point, as shown in Fig. 3 . For uncrosslinked 2:2:4-A20-GA0 mats, the remaining weight was about 38% on 1 day and maintained almost constant until 14 days of immersion. In general, gelatin and PVA are regarded as water-soluble, and chitosan is regarded as water-insoluble in PBS. Considering the components of the nanofibers, the weight loss was less than the overall water-soluble components (gelatin and PVA, 75wt%), meaning that some gelatin might have been associated with the chitosan, possibly through intermolecular interactions. When prolonging the time of glutaraldehyde vapor crosslinking, the stability of 2:2:4-A20 mats accordingly increased. After 14 days of immersion, the remaining weight percentages of 2:2:4-AA20 mats crosslinked by glutaraldehyde vapor for 6, 12, and 24h were 70%, 82%, and 89%, respectively. These data indicated that PVA and gelatin were crosslinked onto chitosan and remained on the mats when glutaraldehyde vapor was used as a crosslinking agent [39]. The mechanical properties of the crosslinked nanofibrous mats were also determined. Fig. 4 shows the tensile strength and elongation of the 2:2:4-A20 mats which were either uncrosslinked (GA0) or crosslinked with glutaraldehyde vapor for 12 (GA12) and 24h (GA24). Fig. 4(a) clearly shows that 2:2:4-A20-GA12 mats had the highest tensile strength, which was about 2-times that of the uncrosslinked control (229.6±39.1 vs. 127.3±6.9N/g). However, 2:2:4-A20-GA24 mats had a lower tensile strength (103.9±16.3N/g). The probable reason is that high concentration of glutaraldehyde may influence the structure of chitosan and thus lower its tensile strength [40]. As for the elongation capability, the uncrosslinked (GA0) mats had a higher elongation capability. With prolonging the period of glutaraldehyde vapor treatment, the elongation capability of the 2:2:4-A20 mats decreased accordingly because the polymer chains were restricted by crosslinking (Fig. 4(b))."
12,Preparation of porous sponges by freeze-gelation,"3.4 Preparation of porous sponges by freeze-gelation According to the morphology results described above, the 2:2:4-A20 mats appeared to be suitable for tissue engineering-related applications. For comparison, porous sponges of the same chemical composition (i.e., chitosan–gelatin–PVA) were also prepared by the freeze-gelation method. In our previous studies, chitosan-based sponges prepared by freeze-gelation had high porosity with a pore size of about 30–100μm [32,41,42]. In this study, the surface and cross-sectional SEM images indicated that the 2:2:4-A20 sponges had a uniform pore structure (Fig. 5 ). However, the presence of PVA may have restrained the growth of ice crystals at the low temperature, so the pore size became very small (about 5–20μm). Interconnected pore structures were not obtained because the direction of ice formation in PVA was vertical to the freezing plate, thus forming oriented but not interconnected pore structures [43]."
13,Thermal properties of nanofibers and sponges,"3.5 Thermal properties of nanofibers and sponges The DSC thermograms of the raw materials (chitosan, gelatin, and PVA), the 2:2:4-A20 nanofibrous mats crosslinked by glutaraldehyde vapor for 0, 12, and 24h (termed GA0, GA12, and GA24, respectively), and the 2:2:4-A20 porous sponges (termed sponges) are shown in Fig. 6 . The phase transition temperatures of chitosan, gelatin, and PVA were 155.1, 145.5, and 224.4°C, respectively (Fig. 6(a)–(c)). For the three groups of 2:2:4-A20 mats, a weak and broad endothermic peak at around 220°C was observed regardless of the time of glutaraldehyde-crosslinking, indicating that PVA was blended well with chitosan and gelatin in the electrospun nanofibers. Moreover, the sharp endothermic peak of the GA12 was about 189.1°C, significantly higher than endothermic peaks of GA0 (around 147.2°C) and GA24 (around 168.3°C) (Fig. 6(d)–(f)). The temperature shift suggests that GA12 mats had better thermostability. This tendency was consistent to that of the tensile strengths of nanofibers because GA12 mats had a higher tensile strength than GA0 and GA24 (Fig. 4(a)). In sponges, however, PVA may have phase-separated from the homogeneous solution during the freeze-gelation process. There were two obvious endothermic peaks for 2:2:4-A20 sponge. The first peak (at about 172.8°C) could have been the chitosan–gelatin–PVA blend, and the second peak (about 227.6°C) could have been the phase-separated PVA (Fig. 6(g)). This result suggests that the homogeneity of sponges was less than that of nanofibers."
14,Cytocompatibility of nanofibers and sponges,"3.6 Cytocompatibility of nanofibers and sponges Because the 2:2:4-A20-GA12 mats had enhanced tensile strength (Fig. 4(a)) and also satisfactory stability in PBS (Fig. 3), this group of nanofibrous mats was chosen as a promising biomaterial, together with the sponges, for the subsequent cytocompatibility test. Mesenchymal stem cells (KP-hMSCs) were cultured on the mats and sponges to determine the cytocompatibility of KP-hMSCs on these surfaces. As shown in Fig. 7 , the total amount of cellular proteins (representing the cell number of KP-hMSCs indirectly) on mats was 17μg on day 3, and increased about 4-times to 66μg on day 7, indicating good proliferation of KP-hMSCs. The MTT assay (which measured cell activity) revealed a trend similar to that of cell proliferation, also confirming the good viability of KP-hMSCs on the nanofibrous mats. However, proliferation and cell activity were very low for KP-hMSCs cultured on the surface of the sponges. These results suggest that chitosan–gelatin–PVA nanofibrous mats are suitable for attachment and proliferation of KP-hMSCs, probably because the morphology and structure of nonwoven electrospun nanofibers are similar to the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, due to the high surface area-to-volume ratio and high porosity, nutrients and metabolites can be easily transported into and out of the mats."
15,Conclusions,"Electrospun chitosan–gelatin–PVA hybrid nanofibers were successfully produced using only a mild concentration (20wt%) of acetic acid instead of organic solvents such as TFA or HFIP with high toxicity. The optimum weight ratio of chitosan:gelatin:PVA was 2:2:4, with resultant fiber diameters of around 150nm. Uniform nanofibers were obtained at an applied voltage of 20kV and a flow rate of 0.15–0.3mL/h. The stability and tensile strength of the nanofibrous mats were both enhanced by glutaraldehyde vapor-crosslinking for 12h. The cytocompatibility test indicated that the hybrid nanofibrous mats were suitable for the attachment and proliferation of KP-hMSCs, probably because the morphology and structure of the nanofibers are similar to those of the ECM, with a high surface area and porosity that benefit the transport of nutrients and metabolites. The chitosan–gelatin–PVA hybrid nanofibrous mats are a very promising biomaterial for tissue engineering-related applications due to their enhanced strength, stability, and cytocompatibility."
