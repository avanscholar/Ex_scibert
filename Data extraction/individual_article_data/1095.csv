0,Introduction,"The massive fossil consumption has caused increasingly serious environmental concerns especially global warming. This has aroused great interest in developing new technologies to produce alternative fuels from renewable biomass (Gunukula et al., 2017). Biomass is a cheap and abundant renewable resource in the nature, of which agricultural residues as a by-product in the crop production are considered to be a promising feedstock (Zhang et al., 2013). Biomass fast pyrolysis is considered as one of the most promising technologies of converting biomass into biofuels for its high efficiency and low cost compared with the technologies of gasification and fermentation (Zhang et al., 2009). Moreover, some commercial-scale demonstration plants of fast pyrolysis with different handling capacity of biomass have been established in multiple regions or countries in the world (Cai and Liu, 2016). The operation practice from the demonstration plants can contribute to the industrialization process of fast pyrolysis technology. However, pyrolysis bio-oil cannot be directly applied to the transport vehicles due to its poor physicochemical properties (e.g. high water content, high oxygen content, high acidity, high viscosity, etc.) to date. Pyrolysis bio-oil needs to be upgraded for practical application (Bridgwater, 2012). The catalytic hydrogenation of bio-oil is considered to be a feasible approach (Vispute and Huber, 2009). However, it is not cost-effective to hydrodeoxygenate bio-oil completely owing to the lower yield of single target product and lots of worthless water produced. Some studies indicate that aqueous phase bio-oil (APB) from phase separation of bio-oil can be easily converted into alcohols via hydrogenation process (de Miguel Mercader et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2005). But there still exist many difficulties during converting non-aqueous phase bio-oil (NAPB) from phase separation of bio-oil into the transport fuels through catalytic hydrogenation (Xiao et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). If NAPB with a larger calorific value is discarded, the utilization rate of bio-oil will be greatly reduced. Meanwhile, hydrogen gas (H2) needs to be purchased from the outside for the hydro-upgrading of APB. Hydrogen gas is not only clean fuel with zero-emission, but also an important feedstock widely used for refining crude oil and ammonia synthesis (Kathe et al., 2016). As a secondary fuel or feedstock, H2 is mostly produced from primary energy source such as coal, natural gas, heavy oil, and naphtha (Navarro et al., 2007; Paltsev et al., 2011). About 96% of the world’s H2 is produced through natural gas steam reforming (NGSR) and coal-gasification (CG) without CO2 capture, which lead to large amounts of greenhouse gas emission (Cormos et al., 2008). Additionally, these processes are not only energy-intensive, but also high-cost in post-purification and CO2 capture (Zafar et al., 2005). With the increase of H2 demand, it is desired that the new technologies of hydrogen production be high efficient and environment-friendly. The chemical-looping process with inherent CO2 separation is considered as a promising option of H2 production in order to reduce the dependence on fossil energy and CO2 emission (Cormos, 2015; Li et al., 2010). Considering the above-mentioned situation, a new upgrading pathway of pyrolysis bio-oil has been proposed by our research group (Heng et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016). It mainly includes two important parts: 1) Iron-based chemical-looping hydrogen production (CLHP) using NAPB as fuel. 2) Esterification reaction and sequent catalytic hydrotreatment of APB for polyol production. The target products mainly comprise polyols containing C2 to C6 and hydrogen gas. The iron-based chemical-looping process plays a role of hydrogen provider for hydroprocessing of APB. The overall thermal performance, including the total thermal energy conversion efficiency, the hydrogen energy efficiency, and the waste heat recovery scheme about the CLHP process with CO2 capture using NAPB as fuel, had been investigated in the literature (Heng et al., 2016). On the basis of these research results, the environmental performance of the CLHP process with CO2 capture is investigated using the method of LCA. This LCA work mainly quantifies the fossil energy consumption using the cumulative energy demand inventory method and evaluates life cycle GHG emission from hydrogen production according to the GWP 100a method (Solomon et al., 2007). The required inputs of material and energy involved in the production of NAPB and hydrogen gas are taken from the process simulation results based on Aspen Plus software (V7.1). The eBalance software with a Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD) (V0.8) is employed to perform this LCA task (Integrated Knowledge for our Environment (IKE), 2010)."
1,Description of hydrogen production pathway,"Multiple unit processes are involved in converting biomass into polyols and H2. Biomass production, collection and transportation of biomass, biomass preprocessing, and bio-oil production are all important upstream processes involved in the production of polyols and H2. The production process flow diagram of bio-oil, H2 and polyol fuel are described in detail in Fig. S1 in Support Material (SM). The biomass processing capacity is 25 tonnes/day of dry corn stover according to the annual polyol output of 1000 tonnes from the demonstration plant under the assumption of 6000 operation hours per year. Ultimate analysis, proximate analysis and lower calorific value (LHV) of corn stover are shown in Table S1 in SM. The bio-oil production includes biomass pretreatment, biomass fast pyrolysis, solid removal, bio-oil recovery, and heat production. The harvested biomass with high moisture needs to be dried and smashed to increase the bio-oil yield. The biomass with 25 wt.% moisture (M) is firstly chopped to 10 mm particle diameter and then dried to 7 wt.% M, and finally ground to 3 mm particle diameter (Ringer et al., 2006). A ﬂuidized bed pyrolysis reactor operates at 500 °C and at ambient pressure (Wright et al., 2010a; Brown et al., 2012). The pyrolysis products include bio-oil vapors, non-condensable gases (NCGs), and solid char with ash. The composition and yield of pyrolysis products are listed in Table S2 in SM. The yield of bio-oil, NCGs, and char is, respectively, 69.1 wt.%, 15.1 wt.% and 15.8 wt.% based on the dry basis of biomass. 99 wt.% of the entrained char and ash particles in the pyrolysis gas is assumed to be removed via a set of cyclones and baghouse filters in turn. The bio-oil vapors are recovered via the staged condensers. The by-products including NCGs and char serve as fuels to provide the process heat required by the pyrolysis reactor, steam generation, preheating combustion air, and preheating the reactants for the esterification reactor. A portion of flue gas from the combustor is compressed and sent to the pyrolyzer as the carrier gas, as shown in Fig. S1 in SM. The bio-oil is separated into APB and NAPB via forced water separation in a liquid–liquid (L–L) extractor. The dry bio-oil is defined as the water-free bio-oil containing 62.2 wt.% of water-free APB and 37.8 wt.% of water-free NAPB. The detailed composition and LHV of APB and NAPB are shown in Table S3 in SM. The APB is mainly converted into polyol fuel and by-product (esters) through the esterification and hydrogenation processes, the detailed operation parameters of which can be found in the published literature (Heng et al., 2018). The NAPB as fuel is used for an iron-based CLHP process with CO2 capture to produce H2. Currently, the low-cost and environmentally-friendly ferric oxide (Fe2O3) is the most suitable oxygen carrier (OC) for the CLHP process according to the thermodynamic analysis (Kang et al., 2010). The alpha-corundum (Al2O3) as inert carrier plays a role of anti-sintering and heat-carrying agent. Therefore, Fe2O3 blended with Al2O3 acts as the OC. The NAPB is almost completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O by Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 is reduced to a lower valent state containing ferrous oxide (Fe0.947O) and ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) simultaneously in the fuel reactor (FR). Then the partially reduced OC from FR reacts with steam to produce H2 and is oxidized to the ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) in the steam reactor (SR). Lastly, Fe3O4 from SR is further oxidized to Fe2O3 by oxygen gas from air in the air reactor (AR). The mixtures produced in three reactors are separated into gases and solids through the cyclone separators, respectively. The solid particles of OC circulate among three reactors. High temperature gas mixtures from three reactors are transported into waste heat recovery system (WHRS) and cooled, as shown in Fig. S1 in SM. The heat from high temperature gases is utilized to produce superheated steam, preheat the air for AR and NAPB for FR. Then the cooled gas mixtures out of WHRS are further cooled to 25 °C. Finally, the separation of H2 from water and the separation of CO2 from water are completed via the flash separators. A part of compressed H2 is delivered to the hydro-upgrading process of APB and the remaining part to the storage tank. The CO2 captured can be delivered to the storage for CO2 sequestration or sold to some enterprises. Additionally, the hypoxic air out of AR is directly released into the atmosphere after cooled through WHRS. In this study, the CLHP process is under the self-sustaining operation mode. The power consumption from this unit process is fully provided by the turbine generators and the process heat required by FR comes from AR by means of the circulating OC. The CLHP process simulation models established using Aspen Plus software and the scheme of waste heat utilization can be found in the published literature (Heng et al., 2016). The detailed assumptions, the operation parameters, and the new simulation results of CLHP using NAPB derived from corn stover as fuel are separately listed in Tables S4 and S5 in SM."
2,LCA scope definition,"The scope definition is an essential first step of LCA. It specifies the product system and the system boundary. The integrated scenario of bio-oil production and bio-oil upgrading is adopted because the differences between the integrated scenario and the distributed scenario almost have no influence on the LCA results (Han et al., 2011; Wright et al., 2010b). The integrated refinery is located in the corn planting areas of central China. Five unit processes are involved in hydrogen production, including corn stover production, collection and transportation of corn stover, corn stover pre-processing, bio-oil production, and hydrogen production. The LCA system boundary of H2 production is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The material and energy entering into the LCA system boundary are included in. The fossil energy consumption for their production and the corresponding GHG emission are traced to the exploitation of raw materials. The external power consumption is assumed to come from the National Electricity Grid of China. Compared to the traditional agriculture, the crop straw harvested for energy conversion may impact the equilibrium amount of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the effects of crop straw removal on SOC loss are difficult to be quantified accurately and the specific proportion of the crop straw sustainable removal is still in dispute (Kim and Dale, 2005; Mann et al., 2002). The proposed sustainable straw removal rate ranges from 20% to 80% (Kadam and McMillan, 2003). In this study, about 40% of corn stover is collected for the production of polyols and H2 and about 60% of that is returned to the field to sustain the soil properties. Therefore, the impacts of corn stover removal on SOC loss are not considered. The effects from the indirect land use change (ILUC) are not included because there are no standard evaluation rules and many difficulties to measure the GHG emission associated with ILUC (Mathews and Tan, 2009). Additionally, the consumption of material and energy involved with the physical infrastructures are not included in this work. Some primary data associated with unit processes of LCA come from the simulation results based on Aspen Plus software. The process simulation models for bio-oil production are adapted from those established by Ringer et al. (2006) and Wright et al. (2010b). The CLCD can provide the secondary data of the material and energy consumed. All the weights in LCA inventories are on a dry basis, otherwise they are stated specially. The functional unit (FU) used is 1 MJ H2. The method of 100-year time horizon GWP (Solomon et al., 2007) is utilized to quantify the GWP of H2 production. The FEI of H2 production is calculated based on the cumulative energy demand method."
3,Inventory analysis,"The conversion process from biomass to fuels is a typical co-production system. The fossil energy consumption and waste emission from the co-production processes need to be allocated among multiple products, e.g. char, APB, and NAPB in the bio-oil production, hydrogen gas and electric power in the CLHP. The chosen allocation methods significantly impact on the LCA results (Wang et al., 2004). Three allocation methods (based on mass output share, energy output share, and economic revenue share) and the displacement method are usually adopted in bio-fuel LCA (Wang et al., 2011). In this study, the allocation method based on market-value is applied to corn stover while the allocation method based on the energy output is utilized for APB and NAPB. The displacement allocation method is applied to the surplus char and the surplus power. The char acts as a substitute for raw coal. The surplus power displaces the power from the National Electricity Grid of China and the amount of substitution for raw coal is calculated according to the percentage (about 74%) of coal power accounting for the current capacity of the national grid. The fossil energy use and emission load of raw coal production are treated as the credits of the surplus char which are subtracted from the total energy consumption and the total emission loads of the biofuel production cycle (Han et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011). Similarly, so do the credits of the surplus power. The inventory analysis can present the basic data which are the basis of LCA. It aims to establish system inputs and outputs for each unit process. The primary data of corn stover production, collection and transportation, pre-processing and fast pyrolysis mainly come from Supporting Information of the published literature (Heng et al., 2018). The inventory data are listed in Tables S6–S10 in SM and are standardized on the basis of FU in the section of Results and discussion. The inventory analysis of each unit process is as below."
4,Biomass production,"4.1 Biomass production The resource inputs and GHG emission involved with planting of corn stover are included in the inventory analysis. The amount of herbicide and pesticide sprayed is 2.70 kg and 0.99 kg per hectare corn farmland, respectively. The electric power of 105 kW h is used for irrigating 1 ha farmland. The inputs of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers are 175 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 60 kg K2O per hectare corn farmland, respectively. The total emission factor of N2O and NO from the soil due to the application of N fertilizer is separately 13.75 g N2O–N/kg N and 6.5 g NO–N/kg N (Argonne National Laboratory, 2011; Zhang et al., 2010). The average yield of corn stover is about 5382 kg/ha based on a dry basis and the price allocation factor of corn stover is about 0.184 (Heng et al., 2018). All the resource consumption and waste emission should be distributed between the corn stover and corn. The inventory data allocated to corn stover are listed in Table S6 in SM."
5,Biomass collection and transportation,"4.2 Biomass collection and transportation The corn stover harvested is first transported to the nearby collection stations by tractor and then baled for centralized transportation by truck. The rated loading capacity of tractor and truck is 0.65 tonnes and 8 tonnes, respectively. The transportation includes a full load trip and a return trip with empty load. The reaping, baling, stevedoring and transporting of corn stover consume the diesel fuel. The total weight of delivered corn stover containing 25 wt.% M is 33.5 tonnes/day. The collection radius of corn stover calculated is 5.6 km (Heng et al., 2018). The factors of fuel consumption and waste emission for transport vehicles come from the CLCD. The main inventory data are listed in Table S7 in SM."
6,Biomass pre-processing,"4.3 Biomass pre-processing The biomass pre-processing includes chopping, drying, and grinding. The electric power is spent on chopping and grinding of corn stover. About 17.0 kW h of power is required for chopping one tonne of corn stover with 25 wt.% M from the original length to 10 mm particle diameter. A common assumption is that 50 kW h of electricity energy is used for grinding one tonne of biomass (Wright et al., 2010b). The corn stover is dried from 25 wt.% M to 7 wt.% M using superheated steam produced from waste heat utilization of high temperature flue gas. The detailed input data are listed in Table S8 in SM"
7,Bio-oil production,"4.4 Bio-oil production The simulation results of bio-oil production can provide the basic flows of mass and energy for inventory data. The processing capacity of pyrolysis plant is 26.9 tonnes/day of pre-treated corn stover containing 7 wt.% M. The bio-oil yield is 71.3 wt.% including 19.4 wt.% M based on the wet basis of biomass. Therefore, the output of dry bio-oil is 13.96 tonnes/day. According to the mass percent of APB and NAPB in the dry bio-oil, the output of dry APB and dry NAPB is, respectively, 8.68 tonnes/day and 5.28 tonnes/day. All the NCGs and about 74% of char are combusted to provide the process heat required. The surplus char output is only 1.04 tonnes/day. It is treated as a substitute for raw coal locally consumed. The LHV of char and raw coal replaced is separately 20.30 MJ/kg and 20.908 MJ/kg (Heng et al., 2018). The resource inputs include electric energy, air and process water in this unit process. The electric energy is consumed by the devices including draught fans, pumps, cyclones, and so on. The hot pyrolysis gases are quenched to recover bio-oil using the process water. The air is used for combusting NCGs and char. The exhaust gases from the combustor, e.g. CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), are discharged directly into the atmosphere. The main inventory data are shown in Table S9 in SM."
8,Hydrogen production,"4.5 Hydrogen production About 5.28 tonnes/day of dry NAPB enters into the CLHP process as fuel. The H2 output is 0.770 tonnes/day. Under the conservative assumption of 90% of capture efficiency, the amount of CO2 captured is 12.823 tonnes/day. According to the simulation results of CLHP, the particle circulating rate of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 is 7.80 tonnes/day and 1.54 tonnes/day, respectively. By virtue of the circulating OC, the heat required by FR is totally provided by AR. The service life of OC is assumed to be 2,000 h considering inactivation and abrasion of Fe2O3. The fossil energy use and GHG emission for exploiting Fe2O3 and producing Al2O3 are calculated according to the primary data from the CLCD. The transportation distance of OC is assumed to be 300 km and the diesel truck with 8-tonne rated loading capacity acts as the transport vehicle. The factors of fuel consumption and waste emission come from the CLCD. Under the conditions of self-sustaining operation mode, the electric energy generated in this unit process can completely meet the needs of the electricity consumed by various devices. Hence, the external power input does not be needed in this unit process. Furthermore, the surplus power is about 24 kW h/day. It displaces the power from the National Electricity Grid of China. The avoided raw coal is about 0.010 tonnes/day according to the primary data of coal consumption used for power generation from the CLCD. The hypoxic air from AR is directly emitted into the air, the detail composition of which is shown in Table S10 in SM. The purified water is employed as working medium for waste heat power generation and a portion of superheated steam produced acts as a reactant in SR. The vast majority of process water is mainly utilized to condense water vapor so as to separate water from CO2 and H2, and refrigerate CO2 and H2 during compressing. The main inventory data are listed in Table S10 in SM."
9,Results and discussion,"The NAPB is only a part of bio-oil. Therefore, the resource input and the waste emission loads from all the upstream processes before the CLHP process need to be portioned between NAPB and APB according to the chosen allocation methods. In this study, the energy allocation factor of dry APB and dry NAPB is 0.452 and 0.548, respectively (Heng et al., 2018). The FEI and the GWP that each unit process contributes are calculated and standardized based on the FU according to the inventory data in SM, the allocation factor of NAPB, the primary and secondary data from CLCD, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2 ."
10,Fossil energy inputs,"5.1 Fossil energy inputs The net FEI is defined as the sum of FEI from each unit process including the credits shown as negative values coming from the substitution effect of the surplus char and the surplus power. The total positive FEI is the sum of the fossil energy consumed by all the unit processes, its value being 0.760 MJ/MJ H2. As indicated in Table 1, the largest FEI is expended on NAPB production, accounting for 60.0% of the total positive FEI. This is mainly caused by large amounts of electricity consumption used for many pumps, draught fans, gas-solid cyclones, etc. Biomass pre-treatment plays an important role of fossil energy consumption, accounting for about 23.3% of the total positive FEI, which arises from the electricity consumption for biomass chopping, grinding and conveying. The FEI for biomass production accounts for about 8.9% of the total positive FEI, mainly resulting from N fertilizer consumption. It is noteworthy that the unit process of CLHP only contributes about 1.2% of the total positive FEI. This is mainly due to the self-sustaining operation mode of the CLHP process. There is almost no need of external electric power input and thermal energy input. The main electricity consuming equipment includes the multistage compressors for compressing H2 and CO2, various pumps and fans which consume the vast majority of the electric power generated in the CLHP process. Additionally, biomass collection and transportation consumes about 6.6% the total positive FEI. The remaining char replacing raw coal contributes to 0.161 MJ reductions per MJ H2 to the total positive FEI. The credit from the surplus power is only about -0.002 MJ/MJ H2. Finally, the net FEI is 0.597 MJ per MJ H2 output."
11,GHG emission,"5.2 GHG emission The GWP is the sum of CO2 equivalent from the GHGs including CO2, CO, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) in this study. It represents the total effects on global climate change owing to the GHG emission. The contribution of reducing the equivalent GHG emission is expressed using a negative value. Otherwise, it is shown as a positive value. The corn stover plays a role of carbon fixation via the uptake of atmospheric CO2 during its growth. The biogenic carbon credit from CO2 uptake can cancel out all the biogenic CO2 emission from various unit processes including the disposal of carbonaceous organics in waste water. Therefore, this quantitative analysis of GWP includes the indirect and direct GHG emission from fossil energy use in various unit processes and the equivalent carbon credits from the surplus char, the surplus power, and CO2 captured artificially, as shown in Fig. 2. The total positive GWP of hydrogen production is 0.0753 kg CO2, eq. per MJ H2 output. The largest GHG emission comes from NAPB production, which contributes about 58.1% of the total positive GWP. It is mainly caused by electricity consumption. Biomass pre-processing contributes 22.5% to the total positive GWP as the second largest GHG emission because of electricity consumption. Biomass production makes a contribution of 12.8% to the total positive GWP, which largely results from N fertilizer application. The collection and transportation of biomass offers 5.6% of the total positive GWP. The CLHP process only contributes 1.0% of the total positive GWP as the smallest GHG emission owing to the least fossil energy input. The carbon credit of char displacement and CO2 capture is, respectively, -0.0130 kgCO2, eq./MJ H2 and -0.1388 kgCO2, eq./MJ H2. But the carbon credit from the surplus power is close to zero (-0.0002 kgCO2, eq. /MJ H2). As a result, the net GWP of hydrogen production is -0.0767 kgCO2, eq. per MJ H2."
12,Comparative analysis on different hydrogen production processes,"5.3 Comparative analysis on different hydrogen production processes The net FEI and the net GWP of hydrogen production via NGSR and CG are separately calculated according to the initial data in the literatures (Ou and Zhang, 2011; Spath and Mann, 2000). The net FEI and the net GWP from different hydrogen production processes are listed in Table 2 . According to the simulation results of the CLHP process from Table S5 in SM, the generated power is largely spent on compressing H2 and CO2 in the base case. The surplus electric power is about 24.0 kW h/day. If CO2 from FR does not be captured, the surplus power will increase greatly to 1411.3 kW h/day. As a result, the net FEI is 0.470 MJ/MJ H2, reducing by 21.3% compared to the base case, while the net GWP becomes a positive value, as shown in Table 2. CO2 capture in the CLHP process plays a critical role of carbon sink in lessening greenhouse effect. Compared to the conventional hydrogen production, the net FEI in the base case is only 39.1% and 18.4% of that from NGSR and CG for hydrogen production, respectively. Due to biogenic CO2 capture, the net GWP of hydrogen gas is negative, far below those of hydrogen production via NGSR and CG. Obviously, different hydrogen source can significantly influence on the net FEI and the net GWP of the target product when used for hydro-upgrading of pyrolysis bio-oil."
13,Sensitivity analysis,"5.4 Sensitivity analysis The reliability of LCA results mainly depends on the reliability of data adopted for the assessment. Sensitivity analysis can ascertain whether the results of inventory analysis are significantly impacted by the data uncertainty. In this study, sensitivity analysis of the net GWP of hydrogen production is implemented through changing some parameters within a prescribed range (±25%) versus the base case. The investigated factors include the amount of nitrogen fertilizer, the biomass collecting radius, the yield of NAPB, the electricity inputs for biomass pre-treatment and NAPB production. The sensitivity analysis of the net GWP is shown in Fig. 3 in the form of relative deviation. As indicated in Fig. 3, all the relative deviations of the net GWP are between -15.0% and 15.0% corresponding to a variation of ±25% of various parameters versus the base case. The change of electricity input for NAPB production has the greatest impact on the net GWP, a variation of ±25% of which leads to a net GWP change of ±14.2%. When the electricity input used for biomass pre-treatment varies ±25%, the net GWP has a 5.5% increase and a 5.6% decrease accordingly. When the NAPB yield rises by 25%, the net GWP will reduce by 5.2%. On the contrary, the net GWP will increases by 5.9%. The variation of nitrogen fertilizer amount has a small impact on the net GWP, a variation of ±25% corresponding to a net GWP change of about ±2.7%. Additionally, the variation of biomass collection radius has a negligible effect on the net GWP. The sensitivity analysis indicates only the data uncertainty of the electricity consumption for NAPB production has relatively obvious impact on the net GWP of hydrogen production within a prescribed range (±25%). Therefore, the LCA results in this work are basically credible under the conditions of the given data and assumptions."
14,Conclusions,"The FEI and the GWP of hydrogen production via iron-based chemical-looping process with CO2 capture using NAPB as fuel are mainly investigated based on the method of LCA. The research results indicate the proposed production pathway of hydrogen gas can not only enhance the availability ratio of pyrolysis bio-oil, but also provide eco-friendly hydrogen gas for hydro-upgrading of APB at the cost of lower fossil energy consumption. Among five unit processes, NAPB production has the largest FEI and contributes the largest GWP. Biomass production and pre-treatment also play important roles of fossil energy consumption and GHG emission. Under the conservative assumption of 90% CO2 capture efficiency, the vital contribution from CO2 capture to the reduction of the total positive GWP is 0.1388 kg CO2, eq. per MJ H2. The net FEI and the net GWP of hydrogen production is separately 0.597 MJ and-0.0767 kg CO2, eq. per MJ H2 via the proposed production pathway, far below those of conventional NGSR and CG for hydrogen production. This is mainly ascribed to the bio-based fuel used, biogenic CO2 capture, and full utilization of high temperature gas waste heat in the overall system. According to sensitivity analysis, the data uncertainty of the discussed parameters except the electricity input for NAPB production has no significant impact on the net GWP within a prescribed range (±25%). The LCA results also indicate the CLHP technology with CO2 capture may be a more promising approach to sustainable hydrogen production when using biomass as fuel."
