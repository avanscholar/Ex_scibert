0,Introduction,"The negative impact of plastic packaging materials on the environment has stimulated research into the design and production of more renewable and environmentally-friendly alternatives (Alizadeh-Sani, Rhim, Azizi-Lalabadi, Hemmati-Dinarvand, & Ehsani, 2020; Rhim, Park, & Ha, 2013). As a result, many natural polymers have been explored for their potential use as packaging materials (Alizadeh-Sani, Mohammadian, & McClements, 2020; Alizadeh-Sani, Ehsani, Kia, & Khezerlou, 2019; Azizi-Lalabadia, Ehsanib, Ghanbarzadehc, & Divbandd, 2020; Bagheri et al., 2019). One of the most commonly employed biopolymers for this purpose is gelatin (G), a functional protein obtained from collagen, which is often used to manufacture biodegradable packaging materials because of its desirable film-forming, mechanical, and barrier properties, as well as its non-toxicity and biodegradability (Kumar, Sandeep, Alavi, Truong, & Gorga, 2010). The commercial use of gelatin films is, however, limited by their high water vapor permeability (WVP) and low tensile strength (TS). The functional properties of gelatin films may be extended by incorporating polymers or particles within them (Pawde & Deshmukh, 2008). Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is commonly used for this purpose because of its favorable functional attributes, including strong mechanical properties, high resistance to gas exchange, and good biodegradability. Further improvements in film properties can be achieved by adding colloidal particles, such as metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, and nano-clay (Rani, Ahamed, & Deshmukh, 2020; Roes, Tabak, Shen, Nieuwlaar, & Patel, 2010). For instance incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles into polymeric films has been shown to improve their mechanical strength and thermal stability (Chiellini, Cinelli, Fernandes, Kenawy, & Lazzeri, 2001). Zeolite is an inorganic microporous material consisting of aluminosilicate (Mohanapriya, Deshmukh, Ahamed, Chidambaram, & Pasha, 2016; Moshoeshoe, Nadiye-Tabbiruka, & Obuseng, 2017), which can be loaded with functional ingredients. Previously, colloidal zeolites have been incorporated into nanocomposite films to control the release of biocides in reverse osmosis membranes (Jeong et al., 2007; Lind, Jeong, Subramani, Huang, & Hoek, 2009). Colloidal zeolite has also been loaded with inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) to create composite systems with tunable functional attributes, such as controlled nanoparticle release (Davis, 2002). Metal oxide nanoparticles, such as TiO2 and ZnO, are particularly suitable for loading into zeolite because they are safe, inexpensive, and exhibit a range of beneficial functional attributes, including high surface area, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and UV screening (Adams, Lyon, & Alvarez, 2006; Deshmukh et al., 2017; Mohanapriya et al., 2019; Neena et al., 2016). Besides, they are accepted as functional ingredients in foods in many countries. Recently, researchers have shown that incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles into polymer matrices can significantly improve their mechanical strength and catalytical properties (Ponnamma et al., 2019). Other researchers have reported that introducing ZnO nanoparticles into polymer composites can improve their electrical, thermal, mechanical, sensing (Thomas, Prakash, Sadasivuni, Deshmukh, & Edakkara, 2019), electromagnetic shielding (Mohanapriya et al., 2020), and energy storage properties. The dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles has been examined in polyallylamine and polyvinyl alcohol blend systems (Deshmukh, Ahmad, Joshi, Ahamed, & Hägg, 2014). The authors reported that the dispersions were relatively stable (no sedimentation) over a period of two months. The influence of TiO2 nanoparticles on the morphology, rheology, and thermal properties of PVA/TiO2 nanocomposite membranes has also been examined (Ahmad, Deshmukh, Habib, & Hägg, 2014). Taken together, these studies show that introducing inorganic nanoparticles into polymer matrices can be used to modulate their functional attributes. Accordingly, the purpose of this research was to prepare PVA/gelatin films containing nanoparticle-loaded 4A-zeolite fabricated using different types (ZnO and/or TiO2) and levels (0–2%) of inorganic nanoparticles, and then characterize their composition, structure, functionality and antimicrobial properties. These films may be used as environmentally-friendly alternatives to plastic packaging materials in the food and other industries."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals & reagents,"2.1 Chemicals & reagents PVA (M.W. 44.05 g/mol; ~86.5–89% hydrolyzed) was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Gelatin (M.W. 60 KDa; 225 g Bloom), zinc acetate dehydrates, ortho-titanate, glycerol, and ethanol were obtained from the Merck company (Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA). Bacterial strains were obtained from the Biological and Genetic Resources Center (Tehran, Iran). All compounds were of analytical grade. Distilled water was utilized for the preparation of all aqueous-based solutions and colloidal suspensions."
3,Fabrication of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite,"2.2 Fabrication of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite Colloidal 4AZ (Si/Al ≈ 1) was fabricated using a hydrothermal process. Initially, clean clinoptilolite (Si/Al = 9.53) powder was mixed with NaOH, sodium aluminate (NaAlO2), and distilled water and incubated for 6 h. The obtained gel was sonicated for 6 h, conveyed to a Teflon steel container, and heated to 90 °C in an oven. When the suspension reached a value of pH 7, it was centrifuged numerous times to eliminate residual water, and then dehydrated to produce the zeolite (Khatamian, Divband, & Jodaei, 2012). Different kinds of loaded zeolite were formed as described below: ZnO-loaded zeolite: A colloidal suspension containing 0.17 g Zn (CH3CHOO)2·2H2O in 20 mL distilled water was prepared. Then, 5 wt% zeolite was added and the system was sonicated for 30 min. An ion-exchange procedure was used to introduce the zinc ions into the zeolite pores (24 h, 60 °C). The resulting mixture was rinsed with distilled water and dehydrated at 80 °C. Finally, calcination was performed at 500 °C for 2 h to prepare the ZnO- loaded zeolite composites. TiO2-loaded zeolite: A colloidal suspension containing 0.2 g ortho-titanate in 20 mL of absolute ethanol was prepared. This suspension was then mixed with 5 wt% of zeolite and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min. An ion-exchange procedure was then used to introduce the titanium ions into the zeolite pores (6 h, 90 °C). Afterward, the composite material formed was washed, dehydrated at 80 °C. Finally, calcination was performed at 500 °C for 2 h to prepare the TiO2-loaded zeolite composites. ZnO/TiO2-loaded zeolite: Initially, a ZnO/zeolite mixture was prepared as described earlier. This mixture was then dispersed in a solution of 0.2 g ortho-titanate in ethanol (25 mL) and magnetically stirred at 90 °C for 6 h. The resulting system was then dehydrated at 80 °C and calcification was performed at 500 °C for 2 h to produce ZnO/TiO2-loaded zeolite composites. This led to a final system containing 0.5% ZnO and 0.5 wt% of TiO2 nanoparticles in the zeolite. In experiments, the nanoparticle concentration in the zeolite was varied by changing the zinc (Zn2+) or titanium (Ti4+) ion concentrations in the solutions used to prepare them."
4,Formulation of nanocomposite films,"2.3 Formulation of nanocomposite films Initially, PVA powder (3 g) and gelatin powder (3 g) were dispersed in 80 mL of warm distilled water (100 °C and 70 °C, respectively) for 2 h to fully dissolve them. Nanoparticle- loaded zeolite composites were then dispersed within 20 mL of distilled water and sonicated using a bath sonicator (Elmasonic S60H, 50/60 Hz, Germany) for 40 min. The resulting composites contained different kinds of inorganic nanoparticles (TiO2, ZnO, or ZnO/TiO2) incorporated into zeolite at different levels (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt%). The suspensions of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite samples were then incorporated into the PVA/gelatin mixtures, and the suspensions were shaken for 20 min. Glycerol (30 wt% based on the final dried film) was included as a plasticizer and then the mixtures were shaken for another 30 min. Finally, these mixtures (14.0 ± 0.2 g) were poured into aseptic plates (8 cm) and dehydrated at 25 ± 2 °C for 1 day. The composite films were then kept in a desiccator for subsequent tests (Pawde, Deshmukh, & Parab, 2008)."
5,PVA/gelatin-based films characterization,"2.4 PVA/gelatin-based films characterization 2.4.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with elemental analysis The morphology and composition of the surfaces and cross-sections of the films were analyzed by SEM with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) (Philips XL30, Philips Panalytical, California, United States) at 5 kV. Element mapping (MAP) was carried out to establish the spatial distribution of the elements in the nanocomposite films using a wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS) system. 2.4.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD spectra of samples were acquired using an X-ray diffractometer (Siemens D5000 diffractometer, Cologne, Germany) at 30 mA and 40 kV with Cu k α radiation (λ = 1.5418 A and 2θ = 4–70 °C). 2.4.3 Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) FTIR spectra of test samples were acquired in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode around 4000–400 cm−1, at a resolution of 4 cm−1 with 24 scans, using a FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27, Bruker, Germany). 2.4.4 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) Initially, 0.05 mg/mL aliquots of nanoparticle suspensions were placed on a glass slide and left to dry at 25 ± 2 °C. The morphology of the film samples was then assessed using AFM operated in tapping mode with a silicon probe cantilever of 230 µm length, resonance frequency of 150–190 kHz, spring constant of 20–60 N/m, nominal tip radius of 5–10 nm, and scan rate of 1 Hz (Dual Scope-TM DS95-50, DME, Denmark). 2.4.5 Thermal characterization of films The thermal properties of the films were analyzed using the following procedure. Initially, the films were placed in a desiccator with calcium chloride for two days at 24–26 °C to dry them. About 10 mg of the dried films were place in aluminum dishes. For the DSC measurements, dried specimens were scanned at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 25 to 1000 °C (Model 200-F3 Maia, Netzsch, Germany). An empty aluminum pan was considered as a reference for these measurements to highlight the thermal transitions associated with the samples themselves. For TGA measurements, the specimens were scanned at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 40 to 1000 °C (Perkin Elmer TGA 4000 System)."
6,Physical properties of films,"2.5 Physical properties of films 2.5.1 Thickness of films The average thickness of the PVA/gelatin-based films was measured at five different points by a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, Japan) with an accuracy of 0.001 mm. 2.5.2 Transparency of films The optical transparency of the PVA/gelatin-based films was determined using UV–visible spectrophotometry (Unico, UV-2100, USA) according to the ASTM standard method (ASTM-D-091746, 1997). The transparency of the films was calculated as follows: (1) T r a n s p a r e n c y = L og T 600 F i l m t h i c k n e s s ( m m ) where T600 is the percent transmittance at 600 nm. 2.5.3 Moisture adsorption For moisture adsorption (MA) analysis, dried films (20 × 20 mm) were kept overnight at 0% relative humidity (RH) before being weighed. Next, the relative humidity of the samples was raised to 55% by placing a saturated calcium nitrate solution in the desiccator. The moisture adsorption was calculated as follows: (Alizadeh-Sani, Khezerlou, & Ehsani, 2018). (2) M A ( % ) = W 55 - W 0 W 0 × 100 Here, W0 and W55 are the sample weights at 0% RH and 55% RH, respectively. 2.5.4 Films solubility The water solubility (WS) of the films was measured by drying them for 5 h in an oven (50 °C) under constant air-flow. The dried specimens were then brought to ambient temperature and weighed, then immersed in distilled water (50 mL) and incubated overnight at 25 °C. After filtering (Whatman No 1) and drying (110 °C; 5 h), the final dry weight of the films was measured. The WS of the specimens was evaluated as follows: (3) W S ( % ) = I n i t i a l d r y w e i g h t - F i n a l d r y w e i g h t F i n a l d r y w e i g h t × 100 2.5.5 Barrier properties The water vapor permeability (WVP) of the specimens was measured using a ASTM E96-05 standard procedure (ASTM, 2005), with some slight modifications. Glass vials (9.6 mm diameter) were filled with 5 g of anhydrous calcium sulfate (RH = 0%; vapor pressure = 0 Pa). The top of each vial was then sealed with a sample of the film being tested, and then the sealed vials were placed in a desiccator containing distilled water for 48 h (25 °C, 100% RH). WVP (g. m/m2. s. Pa) was then estimated by the following expression: (4) W V P = W V T R × L A × Δ P Here, WVTR is the transmission rate of water vapor (g/s), L is the film thickness (m), A is the surface area of exposed film (m2), and ΔP is the water vapor pressure difference across the film (Pa). 2.5.6 Oxygen permeability The oxygen permeability rate of the specimens was determined using an indirect method described previously (Ou, Wang, Tang, Huang, & Jackson, 2005). Glass vials (9.6 mm diameter) were filled with 10 g oleic acid and then sealed with the films. The vials were then left for 12 days at room temperature within a desiccator. The peroxide index of the oleic acid was then measured using the National Standard No. 4179 (Hassanzadazar, Ghayurdoost, Aminzare, Mottaghianpour, & Taami, 2018) and ASTM 1986 (ASTM, 1986) methods, as an indication of lipid oxidation. The greater the lipid oxidation, the higher the oxygen permeability of the film."
7,Mechanical properties,"2.6 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of the films were acquired using a texture analyzer (Universal Testing Instrument Model DBBP-20, Bongshin, Korea) according to the ASTM standard method D882-88 (ASTM, 2009). The films (10 cm × 1 cm) were conditioned within a desiccator (25 °C; 75% RH; 48 h) before being analyzed. The textural properties of the films were then analyzed using a 50 mm starting grip separation and a 5 mm/min crosshead speed. The tensile strength (TS), Young’s modulus (YM), and elongation at break (EB) were then calculated as follows: (5) T S ( M P a ) = St r e s s o f f i l m a t b r e a k Wi d t h × Th i c k n e s s (6) E B ( % ) = El o n g a t e d l e n g t h s Or i g i n a l l e n g t h s × 100 (7) Y M ( M P a ) = S t r e s s a t i n i t i a l s t r a i g h t s t r e s s - St r a i n c u r v e S t r a i n a t i n i t i a l s t r a i g h t s t r e s s - St r a i n c u r v e"
8,Antimicrobial activity,"2.7 Antimicrobial activity A disc diffusion assay was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the PVA/G-based films (Sani, Ehsani, & Hashemi, 2017). After 18 h of growth in nutrient broth (Quelab, Montreal, Canada), suspensions of tested bacteria were collected and adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity (~1.5 × 108 CFU/mL), then serially diluted twice (1:10) to achieve a final bacteria density of 1.5 × 106 CFU/mL. Afterwards, circular films (8 mm diameter) were cut under sterile conditions and placed on Mueller-Hinton agar (Quelab, Montreal, Canada), inoculated with 100 µL of bacterial suspensions (~1.5 × 106 CFU/mL). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, with the exception of P. fluorescens, which was incubated at 25 °C. Finally, a digital micrometer was used to measure the zone of inhibition surrounding the discs."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis All experiments were carried out in triplicates using different samples, and then the means and standard deviations were calculated using SPSS software (version 21.0, IBM; Armonk, N. Y, USA). Statistical analyses were carried out using one-way ANOVA, and Duncan’s multiple post hoc tests. Here, P < 0.05 was considered as significantly different."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Films characteristics,"3.1 Films characteristics Initially, a variety of analytical tools were utilized to characterize the composition, structure, interactions, and thermal properties of the composite films. 3.1.1 SEM-EDS elemental analysis The surface morphology of the polymer composites was characterized by SEM (Fig. 1 ). The PVA/gelatin films had a smooth surface, whereas all the PVA/gelatin/zeolite films (1.5% ZnO, 1.5%TiO2, and 1% ZnO/TiO2) had more irregular surfaces. The lack of surface defects in the PVA/gelatin matrix is probably because they did not contain any added inorganic nanoparticles. Instead, they consisted of a fine network of physically cross-linked polymer molecules. The SEM-EDS elemental analysis of the composite films was consistent with the SEM images. Intensity maps of the C, O, Zn, Si, Ti, and Al elements in the films obtained by EDS-mapping are shown in Figs. 2–5 . Carbon and oxygen were the main elements in all of the composite films, which can be attributed to their prevalence in PVA and gelatin. The silicon and aluminum in the films are mainly associated with the zeolite, whereas the Ti and Zn are mainly associated with the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles, respectively. The Zn, Ti, Si, and Al had a fairly even distribution across the surfaces of the composite films, suggesting that nanoparticle-loaded zeolite had been thoroughly dispersed throughout the PVA/gelatin matrix. Nevertheless, there was some evidence of heterogeneities, which could have been due to the clumping of the particles. 3.1.2 X-ray diffraction Information about any crystalline structures within the composite films was obtained using XRD analysis (Fig. 6 ) (Lu, Huang, Chen, Chiueh, & Shih, 2015; Zhang, Fan, & Gao, 2007). The TiO2 nanoparticles (anatase form) had peaks at 2θ = 7.36, 10.31, 12.66, 21.90, 24.21, 27.32, 30.14, 30.19 and 34.41°, whereas the ZnO nanoparticles (hexagonal wurtzite form) had peaks at 2θ = 32.04, 34.56, 36.72, 47.71, and 57.26°. Using the Scherrer relationship (τ = κ λ/β cosθ), a mean crystallite size (τ) of 50 nm was calculated for the inorganic nanoparticles. Here, κ is a shape factor (≈ 0.9), λ is the X-ray radiation wavelength, β is the total width at half the maximum intensity, and θ is the angle of Bragg diffraction (Zhou, Wang, & Gunasekaran, 2009). The dimensions of the nanoparticles determined by XRD analysis was in accordance with those obtained by particle size analysis using SEM (Fig. 1). High-intensity diffraction peaks were also observed in the 4AZ at a certain 2θ values (Fig. 6). For the ZnO and TiO2 compounds, the diffraction peaks corresponded to their expected published values (JCPDS 79-0207 and JCPDS 21-1272, respectively) (Alizadeh-Sani, Rhim, et al., 2020; Yadav, Singh, & Kumar, 2018), indicating that both species had strong crystallinity. Even so, the fairly broad width of these peaks is indicative of a crystalline domain of small dimensions, which can be attributed to the fact that the elements were in a nanoparticle form. The presence of the inorganic nanoparticles in the zeolite is demonstrated by the presence of the corresponding spectral peaks (particularly 2θ = 4–70°). However, the significant peaks related to the Miller index of TiO2 (642; 664) and ZnO (842; 664) overlap those pertaining to 4AZ (Fig. 6), making the peaks related to the nanoparticles less apparent. 3.1.3 Fourier-transform infrared FTIR spectral was applied to provide insights into the bonding within the polymeric composite. These results provide evidence of (i) PVA/gelatin crosslinking; (ii) incorporation of ZnO, TiO2 or ZnO/TiO2-loaded nanoparticles into the polymer matrix; and, (iii) PVA/gelatin-nanoparticle interactions. In Fig. 7 , the FTIR spectra of the PVA/gelatin films (before and after thermal crosslinking) and the PVA/gelatin/zeolite films are shown, with arrows marking notable peaks. To facilitate the comparison, the spectra of pure TiO2 (Mohanapriya, Mumjitha, Purnasai, & Raj, 2016) and pure ZnO (Shankar, Teng, Li, & Rhim, 2015) powder samples obtained in previous studies were used. There was an amide-I band in all films at about 1732 cm−1, which is linked to CO stretching in the gelatin (Arfat, Benjakul, Prodpran, Sumpavapol, & Songtipya, 2014); the peak at 1541 cm−1 (patterns A and D) is a result of NH bending and CN stretching vibrations related to amide-II. The bands at 1900 and 1500 cm−1 are attributed to the CH stretching of alkyl groups present in the PVA/gelatin films, while the bands between 1500 and 1000 cm−1 in spectra “C” and “D” are a result of TiO bond vibration in the TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 7). The characteristic peaks of ZnO and TiO2 that are observed in pure ZnO and TiO2 disappeared after they were incorporated into the PVA/gelatin films (Mohanapriya et al., 2016; Shankar et al., 2015). The broad bands seen between 2800 and 3500 cm−1 can be related to hydrogen bonding. The intensity of the bands between 2500 and 1800 cm−1 for PVA/gelatin decreased and their position moved to 2800–1900 cm−1 after nanoparticle-loaded zeolite was added to the films (spectra B, C, and D). This result suggests that the characteristic vibrations of these functional groups become decoupled as a result of the PVA’s hydroxyl group interacting with the nanoparticles. The broad band about 3600 cm−1 is because of the N-H stretching of the amide-A group coupled to a hydrogen (Muyonga, Cole, & Duodu, 2004). Furthermore, the stretching of the hydrogen bonded N-H group in amide-A (around 3600 cm−1) intensified after the ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles were added to the PVA/gelatin matrix. This finding suggests that the N-H groups present in the gelatin chain interacted with the nanoparticles through hydrogen bonds (Nikoo et al., 2011). Overall, the observed changes in the FTIR spectra suggest that there were interactions between the nanoparticle-loaded zeolites and the PVA/gelatin matrix, which is in accordance with the results of previous studies on related materials (Anitha, Brabu, Thiruvadigal, Gopalakrishnan, & Natarajan, 2012; Mohanapriya, Mumjitha, et al., 2016; Sairam, Patil, Veerapur, Patil, & Aminabhavi, 2006; Shankar et al., 2015). 3.1.4 Atomic force microscopy AFM was applied to provide information about the nanostructure of the polymer composite. Fig. 8 (A, B, C, and D) depicts the 3D-topographical view of the PVA/gelatin films in the absence and presence of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite. The data arising from the structural analysis of these 3D views are summarized in Table 1 . In the absence of the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite, the PVA/gelatin films had a relatively smooth topography, with some minor surface irregularities (Fig. 8 A). In their presence, however, the surfaces of the films were more irregular, which may have been due to some localized clumping of the particles within the films. According to Table 1, the S a value (average height) increased almost 10-fold after the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite was introduced into the PVA/gelatin composite films. The surface roughness parameters (S sk and S dq) also increased appreciably after the introduction of the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite into the PVA-gelatin films. Interestingly, the surface roughness of the films containing the individual nanoparticles (ZnO or TiO2) was considerably higher than the ones containing the mixed nanoparticles (ZnO/TiO2), which may have been due to differences in nanoparticle concentration or interactions. 3.1.5 Thermal analysis DSC and TGA were utilized to provide information about any thermal transitions occurring in the composite films during heating (Figs. 9 and 10 ). In particular, data on the melting temperature (Tm) and glass transition temperature (Tg) of the films were obtained. The DSC curves showed that all of the films had two melting transitions, a small one around 303–308 °C and a large one around 470–500 °C (Fig. 9). There were some changes in the position of the T m values after the introduction of the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite into the PVA/gelatin films, but the effects depended on nanoparticle type and there were no apparent trends. The thermogravimetric analysis of the films showed that they all exhibited fairly similar thermal behavior, with their mass decreasing steeply from about 150 to 500 °C (Fig. 10). This effect can be related to water evaporation, thermal decomposition of organic matter, and mineral volatilization within the films (Mohanapriya et al., 2010). The final mass was higher for the films with nanoparticle-loaded zeolite because they contained more inorganic material that was difficult to volatilize at the temperatures used."
12,Physical properties,"3.2 Physical properties 3.2.1 Film thickness In the absence of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite, the measured thickness of the PVA/gelatin film was around 0.16 mm (Table 3). The increased film thickness can mainly be related to the higher solid content of the systems containing nanoparticle-loaded zeolite, which would lead to more material being left after drying. Lian, Zhang, and Zhao (2016) also stated that the thickness of PVA/TiO2 composite films increased as the TiO2 concentration was enhanced. 3.2.2 Film transparency The optical properties of polymer composites affect the appearance and light barrier properties of packaging materials (El Miri et al., 2015). The pure PVA/gelatin film had relatively high transparency to visible light at 600 nm (~78%). All the PVA/gelatin films containing nanoparticle-loaded zeolite had lower transparencies (high opacities), which can be related to light scattering by the particulate matter (Table 2 ). Moreover, as the nanoparticle concentration in the films increased, their transparency decreased, which is due to enhanced light scattering by the nanoparticles. These results are consistent with those reported previously when nanoparticles were incorporated into polymer matrices, such as chitosan nanoparticles into gelatin (Hosseini, Rezaei, Zandi, & Farahmandghavi, 2015), TiO2 nanoparticles into PVA (Ahmad, Deshmukh, & Hägg, 2013), and ZnO nanoparticles into gelatin (Arfat et al., 2014). Notably, the TiO2 nanoparticles were more effective at reducing the light transmittance than the ZnO nanoparticles, which can be related to differences in the refractive index and size of the particles (Zolfi, Khodaiyan, Mousavi, & Hashemi, 2014). 3.2.3 Moisture absorption The absorption of moisture by the PVA/gelatin composites in the absence and presence of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite was measured (Table 2). The moisture absorption values decreased significantly after the nanoparticles were added (P < 0.001). The nanoparticles therefore reduced the amount of water absorbed by the films, perhaps by reducing the volume of pores inside them (Voon, Bhat, Easa, Liong, & Karim, 2012). 3.2.4 Water solubility A biodegradable film should form a protective coating around a food product throughout its lifetime, but then degrade when it is released into the environment (Hosseini et al., 2015). For this reason, we measured the water-solubility of the films to provide some insight into their ability to remain intact during storage, but then degrade afterward. The water-solubility of the polymer composite decreased after the incorporation of the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite for all systems (Table 2). For instance, it decreased from around 74% for the un-loaded films to around 64–67% for the loaded ones. The water-solubility of these polymer composites is high because both gelatin and PVA are water-soluble polymers. Presumably, the presence of the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite slows down the amount of water that can enter the films, as well as reducing the total amount of water they can hold. Moreover, the zeolite may cross-link the polymer molecules, which makes it more difficult for them to dissolve. This hypothesis is consistent with the FTIR results discussed earlier, which indicated that there was strong hydrogen bonding between the nanoparticles and surrounding polymer matrix. Our findings are similar to those described previously for gelatin films (Hosseini et al., 2015; Jiang, Liu, Du, & Wang, 2010). 3.2.5 Water vapor permeability The WVP of food packaging is important because it governs the transport of water molecules into or out of a product, thereby altering their quality and shelf-life (El-Wakil, Hassan, Abou-Zeid, & Dufresne, 2015). Previous studies have shown that incorporating nanoparticles into polymer films can improve their barrier properties against water transport (de Moura et al., 2009). For this reason, we examined the impact of adding nanoparticle-loaded zeolite into the PVA/gelatin films on their WVP (Table 2). The WVP of the polymer composite declined significantly (P < 0.001) after incorporating the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite. For instance, it decreased from around 8.20 × 10−9 g /Pa.h.m for the un-loaded films to around 5.20 × 10−9, 5.70 × 10−9, and 5.19 × 10−9 g/Pa.h.m for the loaded films containing 1.5% ZnO, 1.5% TiO2, and 1% ZnO/TiO2, respectively. The WVP initially decreased with increasing nanoparticle concentration in the composite films, but then increased slightly (Table 2). The initial decrease in WVP may have been because the nanoparticles reduced the number and size of the pores within the polymer films by filling the pores and cross-linking the polymer chains (Vanin et al., 2014). In addition, the nanoparticles may have acted as physical obstacles that increased the path length (tortuosity) that the water molecules had to travel through the polymer network. The increase in WVP observed at higher nanoparticle concentrations may have been due to their ability to disrupt the polymer network, thereby allowing the water molecules to penetrate through more easily. 3.2.6 Oxygen permeability Incorporating nanoparticle-loaded zeolite into the PVA/gelatin films significantly reduced their oxygen permeability (Table 2). For instance, the oxygen permeability of the un-loaded polymer composite was around 4.57 m.Eq/g, while that of the loaded films was around 3.29, 3.10, and 3.00 m.Eq/g for the 1.5% ZnO, 1.5% TiO2, and 1% ZnO.TiO2 systems, respectively. As the nanoparticle concentration in the films was increased, their oxygen permeability first decreased but later increased (P < 0.001). The initial decrease in oxygen permeability may be due to the ability of the nanoparticles to reduce the number and size of the pores within the polymer network, as discussed in the previous section. However, the later increase in oxygen permeability may be a result of the nanoparticles disrupting the polymer network, thereby allowing the oxygen molecules to travel through more easily."
13,Mechanical properties,"3.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of polymer composites are a critical factor in their application as packaging materials (Vejdan, Ojagh, Adeli, & Abdollahi, 2016). For this reason, the TS, EB, and YM of the PVA/gelatin composite were measured in the absence and presence of the nanoparticle-loaded zeolite (Table 3). Overall, there tended to be an increase in the TS from 14.6 MPa (PVA/gelatin), to 22.0 MPa (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1.5%ZnO), 20.3 MPa (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1.5 %TiO 2) and 18.0 MPa (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1%(ZnO+TiO 2 )) and also for YM from 183.3 MPa (PVA/gelatin), to 587.8 MPa (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1.5%ZnO), 324.1 MPa (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1.5 %TiO 2) and 346.2 MPa (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1%(ZnO+TiO 2 )) of the composites when the concentration of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite was first increased, followed by a decrease at higher concentrations. There was therefore an optimum concentration of nanoparticles required to obtain high mechanical strength. The brittleness of the films, which is inversely related to their EB values, progressively increased as the concentration of nanoparticle-loaded zeolite was raise from 35.8% (PVA/gelatin), to 11.1% (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1.5%ZnO), 11.2% (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1.5 %TiO 2) and 14.4% (PVA/gelatin/4AZ1%(ZnO+TiO 2 )). Interestingly, the rheological properties of the polymer composites also depended on the kind of nanoparticle used, with the ZnO giving the strongest and most brittle films when used at the optimum concentration (Table 3). The initial enhancement in the mechanical strength of the polymer composites can be related to the fact that the nanoparticles could form cross-links between the polymer molecules, thereby enhancing the total number of cross-links in the films. Furthermore, the nanoparticles could fill some of the pores in the polymer network, thereby reducing their ability to be compressed. Other studies have also shown that nanoparticles can increase the mechanical strength of polymer films by acting as active fillers (de Mesquita, Donnici, & Pereira, 2010; Majer, Hutař, & Nahlik, 2013). The decrease in mechanical strength at high nanoparticle concentrations (Table 3), suggests that the presence of the nanoparticles disrupted the polymer network. Indeed, our SEM images indicated that there were more inhomogeneities in the gel network at the higher nanoparticle concentrations (Fig. 1). The observed enhancement in the brittleness of the films with increasing nanoparticle concentration may also have occurred because the nanoparticles formed strong cross-links between the polymer chains that resisted their elongation (Vejdan et al., 2016). Other studies have also found that the incorporation of nanoparticles into polymer composite increases TS and YM but decreases EB (Hosseini et al., 2015; Vejdan et al., 2016). Mohanapriya, Deshmukh, et al. (2016) stated that the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles to PVA composite increased the TS because the nanoparticles interacted with the hydroxyl groups of the polymer chains via hydrogen bonding (Mohanapriya, Mumjitha, et al., 2016). Overall, our results show that the mechanical strength of the polymer composite can be increased by optimizing the type and level of nanoparticles added to the system."
14,Antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite films,"3.4 Antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite films A disc diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the unloaded and loaded PVA/gelatin films (Table 4 ). As expected, the control sample (PVA/gelatin film) did not exhibit any antimicrobial effect. The efficacy of the loaded films depended on the number and type of nanoparticles present. Interestingly, the films containing a combination of nanoparticles (ZnO/TiO2) exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity than those containing only one type of nanoparticle (ZnO or TiO2). This may have been because of synergism arising from differing mechanisms of antimicrobial action for the two different kinds of nanoparticles (Alswat, Ahmad, Saleh, Hussein, & Ibrahim, 2016). Overall, the nanoparticle-loaded films appeared to be more effective against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly E. coli than Gram-positive ones (S. aureus), suggesting that the nature of the microbial cell wall was important. It is possible that the nanoparticles disrupted the microbial cell membrane properties, thereby having an adverse effect on key biochemical processes inside the cells, such as transmembrane transport, DNA replication, and protein synthesis (Luo, Qin, & Ye, 2015). In addition, the nanoparticles can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage phospholipid molecules in the cell membranes (Ando, Kawasaki, Yamano, Uegaki, & Nakayama, 2015; Azizi-Lalabadi, Rhim, et al., 2019; Azizi-Lalabadi, Ehsani, Divband, & Alizadeh-Sani, 2019). Our findings are consistent with those reported by other researchers on the impact of nanoparticle-loaded films on microbial activity (Luo et al., 2015)."
15,Conclusions,"Recently, there has been growing emphasis on the utilization of nanotechnology to create composite films containing polymers and nanoparticles with tunable functional attributes. In our study, we showed that the functional properties of PVA/gelatin films could be tuned by incorporating nanoparticle-loaded colloidal zeolite suspensions within them. We hypothesized that incorporating the nanoparticles (TiO2 or ZnO) into zeolite would enhance the functional performance of the films. We showed that the structural, optical, mechanical, barrier and antimicrobial properties of these films could be modulated by controlling the type and concentration of nanoparticles employed. Our nanocomposite films, therefore, provide a viable alternative to those described by other researchers who used different kinds of nanoparticles and polymers. As in these other studies, our research showed that the type and concentration of nanoparticles had to be optimized to obtain composite films with strong mechanical strength and good barrier properties. Nevertheless, our composite films exhibited a better functional performance than other recently developed alternatives, including lower WVP, greater mechanical strength, reduced nanoparticle migration into foods and significant antimicrobial effects. In particular, we showed that trapping functional nanoparticles within zeolite can inhibit their migration into foods. Consequently, our films may have advantages over alternatives as packaging materials for utilization in the food industry to extend the shelf life of food products, thereby reducing food waste and improving food quality and sustainability. In the future, however, it would be advantageous to utilize all-natural polymers to fabricate the films, and so a viable alternative to PVA is still required."
