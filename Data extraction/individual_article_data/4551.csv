0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been promoted as a potential solution to a variety of complex problems associated with energy and the environment because of its cleanness, recycle, and effectivity e.g., providing high calorific value of 142.35kJ/g, and producing only water upon combustion [1–3]. People believe that H2-based economy may contribute to meet the growth in world energy demand [4–7]. Traditionally, H2 is mainly generated by hydrocarbon reformation, the reactions of natural gas or light oil fractions with steam at high temperatures, as well as electrolysis of water [8–10]. However, these methods are both energy-intensive and unfriendly to environment. From an environmental protection point of view, bio-H2 production has been an exciting area of bio-energy production. At present, however, most of the studies on the production of bio-H2 have been confined to treating pure carbohydrates and carbohydrate-rich wastewater [2,11–18]. An alternative of bio-H2 production is to convert cellulosic biomass to cellulose-H2 as a high value-added product, since cellulosic biomass is a valuable and most abundant renewable resource on earth. Annually, there are about 2.9 billion tons of crop stalks generated all over the world, the value is commensurate with 1.45 billion tons of standard coal. Only in China, the annual yield of natural cellulosic biomass exceeds 0.7 billion tons, in which the amount of corn stalk is around 220 million tons [6,19,20]. So far, these biomass energy resources have not been effectively utilized. Except that some of them were used to make paper or employed as feedstuff for livestock, most of them were fired or discarded, which has not only become a source of environmental pollution, but also resulted in a huge waste of renewable resource. It is well know that the direct conversion of natural cellulose biomass by H2-producing bacteria is considerably hard because of its complicated polymer structure, such as cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin. For instance, the maximum H2 yield treating raw beer lees and wheat straw were only 5.4ml H2/g-TS and 2.68ml H2/g-TS by dairy manure compost, respectively [19,20]. So far, only a few case studies of bio-H2 production from cellulosic biomass were reported [19–22], in which the substrate was generally pretreated by chemical/physical methods. For instance, Fan and Zhang [20] reported that the H2 yield using acid-pretreated wheat straw was 68.1mL H2/g-TVS. Datar et al. [23] reported that molar yields of 2.84 and 3.0 were obtained using the hydrolyzate of corn stalk derived from neutral and acidic steam explosions, respectively. Recently, bio-pretreatment of substrate has attracted considerable attention for the production of bio-H2 and ethanol due to its several intrinsic advantages, such as high yield of pure glucose, low environmental impact, mild reaction conditions and energy sparing [24–28]. For example, Chen et al. [29] reported that the bio-H2 produced from starch feedstock via combination of enzymatic hydrolysis of starch and dark H2 fermentation, and a high H2 production rate of 1.5l H2/h/l was obtained at 2h HRT using hydrolyzed starch as the carbon source by Clostridium sp. Viola et al. [30] found that ethanol production was more efficient from eel grass via combination of steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis, in the best cases, 243g of ethanol was produced per kg of Zostera fibre. However, no information is available on the bio-H2 production using bio-pretreated corn stalk. In the present study, the feasibility of cellulose-H2 production from corn stalk by lesser panda manure was investigated. A mesophilic H2 production bacterium from a bio-reactor fed with lesser panda manure was isolated, characterized, and identified. And then, the experimental data pertaining to studies carried out on cellulose-H2 production utilizing corn stalk as substrate by mixed culture is presented and discussed."
1,Experimental methods,
2,H2-producing micro-flora,"2.1 H2-producing micro-flora The natural microbial consortium, lesser panda manure and cattle manure, were obtained from the Zhengzhou zoo and the Dairy Center of Zhengzhou City, respectively. The two kinds of micro-flora were continuously aerated by forced-air pumping for 24h at ambient temperature, respectively, in order to inhibit the bioactivity of H2 consumers and harvest high yield H2-producing spore-forming anaerobes, and then were pre-incubated with glucose in anaerobic reactor at 36°C for 2–3 days, respectively. The predominant H2-producing bacteria were isolated according to the method reported by Pan et al. [31]. Routine examinations were performed with a light microscope CH-30 (Olympus, Japan) and an electron microscope AMRAY-1000B (Amray Surg Equip Ltd, USA). The genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets, and then the 16S rDNA gene was amplified by PCR as described in Ref. [31]. The double-stranded PCR products were sequenced. The 16S rDNA sequence was aligned with others available in GenBank."
3,Pretreatment of substrate,"2.2 Pretreatment of substrate Fresh-cut corn stalk at harvest maturity, which contained water of about 70%, was collected from a single field in the suburb of Zhengzhou City. The materials were firstly ground by a vegetation disintegrator (FZ102) to pass 40-mesh screen. Then the ground samples were pretreated as follows: Pretreatment A (lactic acid pretreatment): The ground samples were boiled with 0.04–1.0% dilute lactic acid (solid–liquid ratio of 1:10w/w) for 30min, and then neutralized to pH=7 with dilute NaOH solution; Pretreatment B (bio-pretreatment): the mixtures of the ground corn stalk and microbe additives (provided by Gaojiawang Inc.,China) were sealed in serum bottles, and reacted under anaerobic condition at 25°C for 15 days. Meanwhile, the pH value of medium wasn't further adjusted."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure The batch experiments in Sections 3.1–3.3 were performed with 100-mL serum vials filled with 50mL mixture, comprising the pre-incubated inoculums and pretreated corn stalk. The pH of mixtures was adjusted to 7.0 before bio-H2 fermentation. No extra nutrients were added into the reactors in the tests. These vials were filled with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen and create an anaerobic environment for the bio-H2 production, and then capped with rubber stopper. The bottles were placed in an orbital shaker at 36°C and operated with a rotation speed of 90rpm to provide better contact among substrates. All the experiments were carried out independently in triplicate. The biogas volume at regular intervals was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottles using displacement of saturated brine. The experiments in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 were performed with a 5-L continuously stirred bio-reactor (CSBR) filled with 3.5L mixture, comprising the same as stated above. Online measurements of pH (Hamilton, Switzerland) and ORP (Hamilton, Switzerland) were performed by a Mcrocomputer pH-Vision 6071 model and Mcrocomputer pH/mv/ion/temp Meter 6219 model (Shanghai, China), respectively."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The concentrations of H2, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol were analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC, Agilent 4890) [19]. The soluble saccharide and lactic acid were determined by the methods of P-hydroxydiphenyl colorimetry and anthrone–sulfuric colorimetry using HP 8453 UV–Visible system, respectively. The components of corn stalk, such as cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin, were measured according to the Van Soest Method [32]. The content of total solid (TS) was determined at 105°C in an incubator dry box and 600°C in a muffle furnace, respectively. Hydrogen gas yield was calculated from the headspace measurement of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced at each time interval using the mass balance equation: (1) V = V 0 γ i + ∑ V i γ i where V is the cumulative H2 gas volumes at the current; V 0 is the volume of headspace of vials; Vi is the biogas volume discharged from the vials at the time interval (i); γ i is the fraction of H2 gas discharged from the vials at the time interval (i)."
6,Kinetic modeling,"2.5 Kinetic modeling The cumulative volume of H2 production in the batch experiments followed the modified Gompertz equation: (2) H = P exp { − exp [ R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H is the cumulative H2 production (mL), λ is the lag time (h), P is the H2 production potential (mL), R m is the maximum H2 production rate (mL/h), and e is the 2.718281828. The values of P, R m and λ for each batch were estimated using the solver function in Excel with a Newtonian algorithm. In this study, Ps (defined as mL H2/g-TS) and R m ′ (expressed as mL H2/g-TSh−1) were calculated by dividing P and R m by the initial TS (total solid) content of the substrate, respectively [9,33,34]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,H2-producing micro-flora,"3.1 H2-producing micro-flora Table 1 summarizes the estimated kinetic parameters λ, R m ′ and Ps at initial pH 7.0 and 36°C treating bio-pretreated corn stalk of 15g/L by cattle manure and lesser panda manure in the batch tests, respectively. As can be seen from Table 1, the values of R m ′ and Ps sharply increased from 7.6mL H2/g-TSh−1 and 129.2mL H2/g-TS by cattle manure to 16mL H2/g-TS h−1 and 169mL H2/g-TS by lesser panda manure, respectively. The results suggest that the H2-producing potential of bacterial community in the lesser panda manure is better than that in the cattle manure. Subsequently, 10 strains of anaerobic bacteria were screened and purified from a bio-H2 reactor fed with lesser panda manure at fixed pH 5.5 and 36°C treating 15g/L of bio-pretreated corn stalk. Based on morphological, physiological characteristics and comparative sequence analysis of 16S rDNA, a mesophilic H2-producing bacterial strain, designated as Clostridium sp. Fanp2, was isolated and identified as Clostridium sp., which was a strict anaerobic bacterium. Fig. 1 illustrates the SEM images of Clostridium sp. Fanp2 (a) and the fermentation residues adhered to micro-flora after H2 production (b). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the isolated H2-producing bacterial strain had a long rod shape, and was the dominant bacterial community in the bio-H2 reactor. The porous texture of the residues (Fig. 1b) also shows a partial biodegradation of the corn stalk by microorganisms. Thereafter, the H2-producing characteristic of isolated Clostridium sp. Fanp2 from different organic substrates was further investigated. While glucose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, cellobiose, xylose, microcrystalline cellulose, and bio-pretreated corn stalk were the preferred substrates, the strain grew well and kept a high H2 yield within a wide range of initial pH (5.0–7.5). The maximal H2 yield of 298mL/g glucose was obtained by treating glucose of 5g/L at initial pH 6.5. Based on the above data, the lesser panda manure, which was pre-incubated with glucose, was employed as H2-producing micro-flora in this paper."
9,Effect of substrate pretreatment on H2 yield,"3.2 Effect of substrate pretreatment on H2 yield In the batch tests, the maximum H2 yield of raw materials was only 20mL H2/g-TS by mixed culture. In order to investigate the effect of substrate pretreatment on cumulative H2 yield, two pretreatment methods were further discussed. Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of Pretreatment A on the cumulative H2 yield from corn stalk at initial pH 7.0 and substrate concentration of 15g/L. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the cumulative H2 yield increased from 92ml H2/g-TS at lactic acid concentration of 0.04% to 133ml H2/g-TS at lactic acid concentration of 0.2%, and then sharply decreased with further increase in lactic concentration. Eq. (2) correlated H2 production data well with R 2 >0.98 in all series. Fig. 3 depicts the effect of Pretreatment B on the cumulative H2 yield from corn stalk. Table 2 further summarizes three corresponding kinetic parameters. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3, the values of Ps , λ and R m ′ were significantly affected by Pretreatment B. The cumulative H2 yield increased gradually with the increase in the microbe additive loadings from 125ml H2/g-TS at 2.5g/kg to the maximum 175mL H2/g-TS at 7.5g/kg, the changes of corresponding operating pH from 5.5 to 4.2. Then, the cumulative H2 yield declined remarkably from 175mL H2/g-TS at 7.5g/kg to 81mL H2/g-TS at 12.5g/kg, the changes of corresponding operating pH from 4.2 to 3.6. The results can be expected because excessive microbe additive loadings would result in the acidification of the substrate and fall of pH value in the pretreatment reactor. In this case, the activity of additive microbes would be inhibited. To explain the mechanism of H2 production from corn stalk, the main components of the raw material, the bio-pretreated corn stalk, and the producing H2 residue were further analyzed. The results are summarized in Table 3 . Compared with the raw corn stalk (Table 3), the amounts of soluble saccharide and the lactic acid in bio-pretreated corn stalk increased from 0.073g/g-TS and 0.0g/g-TS to 0.212g/g-TS and 0.021g/g-TS, respectively. Correspondingly, the pH of bio-pretreated corn stalk declined from 7.0 to 4.5 due to the generation of lactic acid, the hemi-cellulose content in the pretreated materials decreased from 24.4% to 19.36% because of the production of soluble saccharide by bio-pretreatment. Lastly, the hemi-cellulose content in fermentation residue further decreased from 19.36% to 4.93% because of bio-H2 production. Meanwhile, the gross mass of the raw corn stalk diminished 26.04% by bio-pretreatment and 18.61% by the H2 fermentation, respectively. Assuming that the enhanced H2 yield might be only attributed the contribution of the generated soluble saccharide and lactic acid in the bio-pretreated substrate, the estimated H2 yield should be 63.8ml H2/g-TS by butyrate-type fermentation (2mol H2/mol glucose) or 127.6ml H2/g-TS by acetate-type fermentation (4mol H2/mol glucose). These results imply that the enhanced H2 yield related to the direct biodegradation of the hemi-cellulose besides the contribution of the generated soluble saccharide and lactic acid in the bio-pretreated corn stalk during the H2 fermentation. The experimental results also show that the bio-pretreatment of substrate played a vital role in the effective conversion of the corn stalk into cellulose-H2 by mixed culture. From the above it can be seen that the Pretreatment B was simpler and more effective than Pretreatment A. Thus it was only selected as the pretreatment method in this study."
10,Effect of substrate concentration on cumulative H2 yield,"3.3 Effect of substrate concentration on cumulative H2 yield Fig. 4 illustrates that plots based on Eq. (2) fit the cumulative H2 production data satisfactorily for bio-pretreated corn stalk ranging from 5g /L to 30g /L at initial pH 7.0. As expected, a significant increase in the cumulative H2 yield could be achieved by raising substrate concentration from 5g/L to 15g/L. The maximum H2 yield of 175mL H2/g-TS occurred at the substrate concentration of 15g /L. After that, the cumulative H2 yield decreased gradually with increasing substrate concentration from 175mL H2/g-TS at 15g/L to 94ml H2/g-TS at 30g/L. As it can be inferred from the above data, the H2 yield would be inhibited at an excess of substrate concentration. Though an increase in substrate concentration was in favor of enhancing the H2-producing efficiency, the higher substrate concentration would result in the accumulation of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and fall of pH value, as well as the increase in the partial pressure of H2 in the bio-H2 reactor, which would inhibit the activity of hydrogenase [19,20,33,35,36]. Furthermore, an exorbitant partial pressure level of H2 in the headspace of reactor would depress H2 synthesis and make metabolic pathways shift to production of more reduced products such as lactate, ethanol, acetone, butanol, or alanine [37]."
11,Effect of operational pH on cumulative H2 yield,"3.4 Effect of operational pH on cumulative H2 yield To investigate the effect of the operational pH on bio-H2 production, the bio-pretreated material of 15g/L was then used in this study at different operating pH ranging from 4.5 to 7.0 in a 5-L CSBR. As shown in Fig. 5 , the cumulative H2 yield was significantly affected by the operating pH. The H2 yield increased remarkably with the increase in culture time in the range of pH 4.5 to 7.0, the maximum H2 yield of 176mL H2/g-TS occurred at pH 5.5 and culture time 20h. Thereafter, the H2 yield trended to a constant in the range of culture time 30∼80h. The operational pH of “5.5” and “4.5∼7.0” may represent the “optimal” and “acceptable” pH value for the H2 production, respectively. The H2 production trended toward stop when the pH was lower than 4.5 or higher than 7.0. In this case, even if the pH in the reactor adjusted to 5.5, the H2 production also couldn't be resumed. The result with respect to optimum pH was in close agreement with those of the earlier worker [32–34,38]. This indicates that proper control of pH was significant for the H2 production because the activity of hydrogenase would be inhibited by low or high pH values in overall H2 fermentation [31]."
12,Oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) and biodegradation characteristics of the substrate,"3.5 Oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) and biodegradation characteristics of the substrate Fig. 6 shows the changes of the cumulative H2 yield, ORP value (a), volatile fatty acids (b) and alcohol (c) with culture time at the fixed pH 5.5 and substrate concentration of 15g/L in a 5-L CSBR. As shown in Fig. 6a, the ORP value gradually dropped from −102mV to −114mV during the first 4h, and then reduced rapidly to −446.5mV in the following 3.5h. It shows that the reactor was shifted from facultative anaerobic running conditions to strict anaerobic running conditions with the exhaustion of trace oxygen. Thereafter, the ORP value stayed in the range of −445mV to −455mV, in which the H2 production was found to be more efficient than other one. The maximum H2 yield of 176ml H2/g-TS (Fig. 6a) and H2 production rate of 18mL H2/g-TSh−1 were observed during the optimal H2 production period, respectively. The experimental result is encouraging because of its potential commercial and environmental benefits in the future. Usually, the ORP value reflects the amount and type of oxidative–reductive substrates in the reactor. The H2-producing bacteria in the lesser panda manure is a strict anaerobe (e.g., Clostridium sp.), and exhibits a relative low ORP level in the reactor. It was consistent with some previous reports, e.g., Sung et al. and Lin and Lay [39,40] reported the ORP value of −320mV to −340mV and −311mV to −368mV using sucrose as the substrate, respectively. Wang and Ren [41] found that the ORP level of −350mV to −420mV by the ethanol type of fermentation and −180mV to −260mV by butyric acid type fermentation was optimal for the maximal H2 production using molasses wastewater as the substrate by mixed culture. Considering H2-production was usually accompanied with the key VFA/alcohols produced, here, butyric acid, acetic acid, and alcohol were selected as main metabolic by-products throughout the H2-producing period. During H2 fermentation progresses, butyric acid, acetic acid, and ethanol contents reached the maximum yields of 2.3mg/mL, 1.1mg/mL and 0.6mg/mL at about 50h, respectively, followed by small amounts of butanol and propionate (Fig. 6b and c). Among them, the contents of butyric and acetic acids accounted for 70–80% of the total VFAs. The carbon mass balance was approximately 77.4%, with acetic acid, butyric acid and ethanol as the major carbon by-products along with carbon dioxide. The H2 percentage in the biogas was 44.3–57.2%(v/v) and there was no significant methane observed in the batch tests. The biodegradation characteristics of the substrate were in close agreement with earlier reports of H2 production from sucrose and starch, of which VFAs mainly consisted of acetate and butyrate [19,20,42]."
13,Conclusions,"The feasibility of the cellulose-H2 production using corn stalk as substrate by lesser panda manure was demonstrated in this study. The isolated H2-producing bacterial strain, designated as Clostridium sp. Fanp2, was identified and showed a high H2 yield from different organic substrates. Experimental results indicated that bio-pretreatment of corn stalk, substrate concentration, operating pH and ORP level all had an individual significant influence on bio-H2 production. Meanwhile, the bio-pretreatment of the substrate played a crucial role to hydrolyze raw cellulosic materials into fermentable saccharide. The maximum H2 yield (176ml H2/g-TS) from corn stalk was about 8.8-fold as compared with that from raw corn stalk in the batch tests."
