0,Introduction,"Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes acts as a crucial reaction in the large-scale hydrogen production from industrial water electrolyzes and chlor-alkali industry [1–3]. The alkaline HER begins with the adsorption of water molecules, followed by the cleavage of water into hydroxyl ions and hydrogen atoms, and then the adsorbed hydrogen atoms interact with water molecules or re-combine to form hydrogen molecules [4]. These multistep reaction processes, including the water adsorption, water dissociation, and hydrogen adsorption process, have been demonstrated to cause the sluggish reaction kinetics of HER under alkaline conditions [5–7]. As such, even the state-of-the-art platinum catalysts exhibit a two to three orders of magnitude lower HER activity in alkaline electrolytes than in the acidic media due to the deficient water dissociation capability, while the low geological abundance and high cost further plague their scalable application [8,9]. Accordingly, it is becoming much attractive to develop earth-abundant transition metal catalysts for alkaline HER with the modulation of these critical reaction processes [10–13]. Specially, the cobalt selenide has been indicated to be a promising candidate. For instance, Xie et al. observed that the metallic CoSe2 nanostructures possess decent capability of water adsorption under alkaline conditions, which might further benefit the alkaline HER process [14]. Meanwhile, Wu et al. demonstrated that the adsorption of water molecules and hydrogen atoms on CoSe2 nanowires can be tuned by adjusting the Co-Se bond lengths, leading to enhanced HER under alkaline conditions [15]. However, for these catalysts, the comprehensive control of reaction processes of water adsorption, water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption during alkaline HER is still lacking, making it fundamentally important and urgent to develop CoSe2-based catalysts with systematically regulated reaction processes towards alkaline HER. Generally, tuning the atomic structures of catalytic interfaces of catalysts has been employed as an efficient way to adjust the adsorption and activation behaviors of reaction intermediates during catalysis [16–18]. For example, with the existence of CeO2, FeOOH/CeO2 hybrid nanotubes were demonstrated to possess lower adsorption energy of OH− at reaction surface than that of FeOOH, leading to the promoted electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution [19]. Particularly, benefiting from the strong metal-support interactions [20–23], the existence of isolated metal atoms on catalyst surface could induce significant influence on the catalytic process. For instance, Gu et al. demonstrated that the atomically dispersed Ir atoms on NiO could enhance the adsorption of oxygen intermediates on the NiO surfaces during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, contributing to the improved catalytic performance [24]. Similarly, Zhang et al. proved that the loading of isolated Ir atoms on FeOx can largely promote the generation of oxygen vacancies in FeOx, thus leading to the accelerated water dissociation for water-gas-shift catalysis [25]. As a result, atomic-scale adjustment of catalysts with isolated metal atoms shines a new light on efficiently regulating the reaction processes of catalytic intermediates, which is critical and highly attractive in developing efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions. Here, we provide a facile method to synthesize isolated Pd atom-anchored CoSe2 (Pd1-CoSe2) nanobelts with systematically regulated reaction processes for alkaline HER. The precisely controlled synthesis includes the reduction of Pd2+ precursors by ethanol via low-temperature ultrasonication and the timely anchoring by surface amino of CoSe2 nanobelts. Specifically, with the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms, the d-band center in Pd1-CoSe2 can be shifted upward, which is proved to promote water adsorption and dissociation process during alkaline HER. Simultaneously, the hydrogen adsorption process can be tuned owing to the strong interactions between Pd and neighboring atoms in CoSe2. Benefiting from the synergistically tailored reaction processes, the Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts exhibited a notably enhanced HER activity in alkaline electrolytes. For the Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, the alkaline HER overpotential showed a remarkable decrease with 80 mV lower than that of pure CoSe2 nanobelts. Moreover, the Tafel slope for Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts was as low as 92 mV dec−1 relative to that of 161 mV dec−1 for CoSe2 nanobelts, in accordance with the accelerated reaction kinetics induced by the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Sodium tetrachloropalladate(II) (Na2PdCl4, 98 %) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium selenite (Na2SeO3), cobaltous acetate tetrahydrate (C4H6CoO4·4H2O), ethyl alcohol (C2H6O), isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O), diethylenetriamine (DETA), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ) was utilized throughout all the experiments."
3,Materials preparation,"2.2 Materials preparation Prior to the synthesis of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, the CoSe2 nanobelts were firstly fabricated in conformity to a previous method [26]. Briefly, Na2SeO3 (173 mg) and C4H6CoO4·4H2O (249 mg) were dissolved in a mixed solution with a ratio of VDETA/Vwater = 2:1 and then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave. After reacting at 180 °C for 16 h, the black floccules were collected and dried at 50 °C under vacuum. In a standard synthesis of 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2, 10.8 mg of as-prepared CoSe2 nanobelts were dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol in a vial. Then, 63 μL of Na2PdCl4 solution (4 mM) was injected into the vial, followed by being capped and sonicated in ice bath immediately. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. After collection by centrifugation and being washed three times with ethanol and DI water, the final product was dried at 50 °C under vacuum. The synthetic procedures for Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts with different Pd molar percentages were controlled by tuning the amounts of Na2PdCl4 without changing other conditions. Specifically, 0.2 %Pd1-CoSe2 and 0.1 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts were synthesized through adding 25 μL and 13 μL of Na2PdCl4 solution (4 mM) into the vials, respectively."
4,Density functional theory calculations,"2.3 Density functional theory calculations First-principle calculations were performed to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction in the presence and absence of palladium on the catalyst surface by using a spin-polarized DFT method within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerholf (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) implemented in Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The strong-correlated correction was considered with GGA + U method (U =3.3 eV), which can treat the localized 3d orbitals of Co atoms in some extent for structure optimization [27,28]. The projected augmented wave (PAW) method was used by plane-wave basis with a kinetic cutoff energy of 500 eV [29,30]. A vacuum layer of about 15 Å was adopted along the z-axis for all the slab models to avoid periodic image interactions. Both the lattice constants and positions of all atoms were fully relaxed until the force was less than 0.02 eV/Å. The convergence criterion for the total energy was set to be 1 × 10−5 eV. The CoSe2 was simulated by periodically repeating CoSe2 (210) slabs with three CoSe2 layers containing 72 atoms. Because of the large size of the unit cell and the limited computational resources, the Brillouin zone was sampled by a 3 × 3×1 k-points grid. The climbing image nudged elastic band method was applied to determine the transition state for water dissociation on the CoSe2 and Pd1-CoSe2 surface. The absorption energy was calculated using the following equation, ΔE = E tot – E surf – E H2O or 1/2E H2, where E tot and E surf are the total energies of the surface covered with and without H2O and hydrogen adsorption, E H2O and E H2 are the energy of free H2O and H2 molecule, respectively. The hydrogen adsorption free energy was determined as ΔG = ΔE + ΔE ZPE – TΔS, where ΔE ZPE and ΔS are zero-point energy correction and entropy change of hydrogen adsorption, respectively. At T =300 K, ΔG can be calculated by ΔG = ΔE +0.28 eV."
5,Electrochemical measurements,"2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a three-electrode electrochemical cell on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation, where a graphite rod and Ag/AgCl were employed as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. For the preparation of working electrode, a certain amount of catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of a mixture with isopropyl alcohol and 40 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution via ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, 35 μL of the suspension was transferred onto the glass carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE), resulting in the loading of catalysts to be 1 mg cm−2. All the potentials were normalized to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) through a standard RHE calibration procedure [31]. The 1 M KOH electrolytes were purged with pure nitrogen for half an hour before the measurements. The polarization curves were collected with a rotation rate of 1,600 rpm and a scan rate of 10 mV/s. All the polarization curves were corrected with the ohmic potential drop (iR) arose from the solution resistance. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out by using the same configuration within a frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with 5 mV amplitude. The accelerated stability measurements were conducted by potential cycling in the range of −0.25−0 V versus RHE with a scan rate of 100 mV/s. At the end of cycling, the polarization curves were recorded with a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The double-layer capacitance (C dl) was estimated by conducting cyclic voltammograms within the potential region of −0.1−0 V versus RHE at various scan rates from 80 to 160 mV/s. The charging current density differences (Δj = j a - j c) were employed to plotted against the scan rates, where the slopes could be used to estimate the C dl."
6,Characterization techniques,"2.5 Characterization techniques TEM images were taken on a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. HRTEM, HAADF-STEM images and EDX elemental mappings were taken on a field-emission transmission electron microscope at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The concentrations of Co, Se, and Pd were determined by ICP-OES (Prodigy Plus, Leeman Labs). GNM-SPD-002-2013 Pd standard solution (100 μg/mL, Guobiao (Beijing) Testing & Certification Co., Ltd.), and GNM-M191743-2013 Co, Se standard solution (1000 μg/mL, Guobiao (Beijing) Testing & Certification Co., Ltd.) were used as the standard solutions for ICP-OES. XRD characterization was performed using the X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab SE, Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation and a wavelength of 0.1541 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were collected on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (K-alpha, Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hυ = 1486.6 eV). Raman spectra were obtained by using a laser confocal Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR800, Horiba JobinYvon) with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source."
7,In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform measurements,"2.6 In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform measurements In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) measurements were carried out in an in-situ reaction cell on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer. In detail, Pd1-CoSe2 samples were loaded in the reaction cell and heated at 100 ℃ under Ar atmosphere in the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer for half an hour to get a stable background spectrum. Then, CO (30 sccm) was purged into the cell until the recorded peak intensity of CO adsorption stopped growing, indicating the saturated adsorption on the samples. Afterwards, Ar gas (30 sccm) was allowed to flow into the cell and purge out the gaseous CO. As such, the chemically adsorbed CO could be recorded."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and characterizations of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts,"3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts To begin with, CoSe2 nanobelts were prepared through a typical solvothermal method with the use of linear-configuration amine as the template molecule [26]. Fig. S1a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of as-prepared CoSe2 nanobelts. It can be clearly observed that these samples have a well-defined belt-like morphology. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. S1b can be indexed as a cubic structure (JCPDS 09-234). In the typical synthesis of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, the obtained CoSe2 nanobelts were dispersed into an ethanol solution in a vial under ultrasonication, followed by the injection of a solution of an accurate amount of Na2PdCl4 (Fig. 1 a). The mixed solution was allowed to react under the uninterrupted ultrasonication in an ice bath for another 30 min. During this process, ethanol acted as the reducing agent to generate Pd° atoms from Pd2+ precursors. Meanwhile, the abundant amino groups on the surface of as-prepared CoSe2 nanobelts, which was confirmed by the vibration bands in FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S2), can timely couple with the generated Pd atoms [32], leading to the formation of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts. Fig. 1b shows a TEM image of the resultant Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelt. The smooth and belt-like morphology was well-maintained in keeping with that of CoSe2 nanobelts. Notably, the absence of nanoparticles indicates the prevented self-nucleation of Pd atoms due to the relatively low concentration of newly formed atoms and copious amino species for coupling atoms at the nanobelt surface. Fig. 1c shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelt. A highly ordered lamellar nanostructure with an interlayer distance of 0.6 nm was clearly observed, which could guarantee high gas permeability for accelerated hydrogen evolution catalysis. To visualize the atomic structure of the Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelt, a magnified high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image is provided in Fig. 1d. The lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 2.6 Å was assigned to the (210) planes of the cubic CoSe2 nanostructures, indicating the maintained structures of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts during the Pd atom anchoring. Obviously, as revealed by the bright spots and marked by white circles, isolated Pd atoms were atomically dispersed on the surface of CoSe2 nanobelts. For the further analysis of the structures and compositions of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, the STEM image of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts and corresponding elemental mapping images are exhibited in Fig. 1e, demonstrating the homogenous distribution of Co, Se and Pd through the whole Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts. Furthermore, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum in Fig. S3 confirms the existence of Co, Se and Pd elements, suggesting the successful anchoring of Pd atoms. The atomic dispersion of Pd atoms of Pd1-CoSe2 was further investigated by the in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) measurements using CO as the probe molecule. As shown in Fig. S4, only a band at 2095 cm−1 ascribed to CO linearly adsorbed on isolated Pd sites was observed, while no bands below 2000 cm-1 for the bridge-bonded CO on neighboring Pd atoms were detected [33,34], confirming the Pd atoms in Pd1-CoSe2 were well isolated. The concentration of Pd in this sample was quantitively determined as 0.4 % according to the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. For simplification, we denoted this sample as 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts. In addition, through simply controlling the amount of Na2PdCl4 solution (4 mM) added during synthesis, 0.2 %Pd1-CoSe2 and 0.1 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts were obtained, where the concentrations of anchored Pd atoms were quantitively measured to be 0.2 % and 0.1 % by ICP-OES, respectively. Fig. S5 exhibits the TEM images of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts with different amount of anchored Pd atoms. For all the samples, the smooth and belt-like morphologies together with the absence of nanoparticles suggest the well-controlled anchoring of isolated Pd atoms on CoSe2 nanobelts during synthesis."
10,Structures and chemical states of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts,"3.2 Structures and chemical states of Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts To verify the structures of the as-prepared Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, the XRD profiles were collected. As shown in Fig. 2 a, for all the Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, the characteristic peaks correspond well to CoSe2 in the cubic phase (JCPDS 09-234), suggesting the well-maintained crystalline structures after the anchoring of Pd atoms. Notably, the absence of characteristic peaks for Pd clusters or nanoparticles accords to the atomically anchoring of Pd atoms observed in the magnified HAADF-STEM image and element mapping. Moreover, the preferred (210) diffraction peaks for all the samples provide undoubtable evidence for the exposed (210) facets of Pd1-CoSe2, in agreement with the HAADF-STEM results. Similar results could be further confirmed by meticulously comparing the Raman spectroscopy between 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 and CoSe2 nanobelts (Fig. 2b). The peaks located at 180, 459, 503 and 664 cm−1 for 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 were consistent with the feature peaks for CoSe2 in cubic phase [35], in accordance with the XRD results. Specifically, the Raman peaks for 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts at 180 cm−1 that was assigned to the typical Se-Se stretching mode of cubic cobalt selenide structure showed a negligible shift in comparison with those for pure CoSe2 nanobelts, which could be attributed to the modification of such a slight amount of Pd atoms in Pd1-CoSe2. The modification of Pd atoms was further investigated by the CO stripping tests (Fig. S6). Relative to the pure CoSe2, the CO stripping curve for Pd1-CoSe2 showed a typical CO-stripping peak at 0.60 V, further indicating the exposure of Pd atoms on CoSe2 nanobelts. To explore the electronic structure of the Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted. In the Co 2p XPS spectra shown in Fig. 2c, the two peaks for 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts located at 778.7 eV and 793.7 eV were assigned to the Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 peaks for the Co-Se bonding in a cobalt selenide structure, where the Co2+ cations were octahedrally coordinated with Se2 2- dimers [36]. The shake-up satellites located at the higher energy side of the Co 2p peaks also indicated the antibonding orbital between Co and Se in a typical cobalt selenide structure [37]. The binding energies of Co 2p signal for 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts showed inconspicuous changes relative to that of pure CoSe2 nanobelts, which could be attributed to the anchoring of the slight amount of Pd atoms. The existence state of these anchored Pd atoms was illustrated by the analysis of Pd 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 2d). For Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, the binding energies of Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 peaks were located at 337.1 eV and 342.3 eV respectively, which were in accordance with those for isolated Pd atoms in the oxidized states [38,39], further indicating the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms on CoSe2 nanobelts."
11,Electrocatalytic properties of Pd1-CoSe2,"3.3 Electrocatalytic properties of Pd1-CoSe2 The capability of alkaline HER electrocatalysis for Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts with various amount of anchored Pd atoms was evaluated in 1 M KOH solution, by using a typical three-electrode system with a graphite rod as the counter electrode to avoid the possible influence of dissolved Pt species during HER. These Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts were uniformly cast on the glassy carbon electrodes quantitatively as the working electrodes. For comparison, pure CoSe2 nanobelts were used as the catalysts and measured in a similar procedure. Fig. 3 a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves recorded at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 and a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. Notably, all the Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts exhibited higher current densities together with lower current onset potentials than pure CoSe2, indicating that the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms can substantially elevate the electrocatalytic performance for HER under alkaline condition. Moreover, with the increased amount of isolated Pd atoms from 0.1 % to 0.4 %, the polarization curves of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts showed an increase in current densities and a decrease in onset potentials, further suggesting the fact that the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms plays a critical role in catalyzing HER in alkaline solution. Notably, among all the tested Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts, the overpotential at a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 showed a remarkably decreased value of 0.24 V, which was 80 mV lower than that for pure CoSe2 nanobelts. To directly understand the catalytic activities of all the catalysts, we collected the current densities at the fixed overpotential of 0.24 V and made a comparison in Fig. 3b. 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts exhibited a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was 3.4, 2.2, and 1.6 times higher than that for CoSe2, 0.1 % Pd1-CoSe2, and 0.2 % Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, respectively, illustrating the efficiently enhanced alkaline activity towards alkaline HER with the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms. Furthermore, the alkaline HER kinetics for these catalysts were explored by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. As measured in Fig. 3c, the Nyquist plots in high frequency range for these Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts exhibited typical semicircles, which were associated with the charge-transfer resistance (R ct). Obviously, the values of R ct for these Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts decreased significantly with the increase amount of Pd atoms anchored on CoSe2, illustrating the efficiently accelerated charge-transfer kinetics during alkaline HER with the existence of isolated Pd atoms. Meanwhile, as an indispensable indicator that can reveal the catalytic reaction dynamics, the Tafel slopes of these catalysts were analyzed to further assessment the alkaline HER performance. As shown in Fig. 3d, the pure CoSe2 nanobelts exhibited a Tafel slope of 161 mV dec−1, indicating the alkaline HER on CoSe2 was largely dominated by the Volmer step in which protons were supplied by cleaving the HOH bond [ 40]. As such, the water adsorption and dissociation processes were crucial to the alkaline HER rate for CoSe2 nanobelts. Fortunately, a remarkably low Tafel slope of 92 mV/dec was obtained for 0.4 %Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts, clearly revealing the significantly improved reaction kinetics of CoSe2 nanobelts with the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms. Such a Tafel slope suggested the Volmer-Heyrovsky steps could occur on these CoSe2-based catalysts during alkaline HER [41], where the hydrogen adsorption process also played a critical role in the final performance. To evaluate the stability of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts towards alkaline HER, the accelerated cyclic voltammetry cycling test was performed at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH solution. Fig. 4 a shows the HER polarization curves of Pd1-CoSe2 before and after the stability test. The barely shifted polarization curves evidenced the catalytic robustness of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts. TEM and XRD analysis in Fig. S7 reveal the well-maintained belt-like morphology and cubic cobalt selenide structure of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts after the stability test, indicating the catalytic stability for alkaline HER catalysis. In addition, we performed the XPS analysis to gain a deep understanding on the surface state of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts. The well-retained Se 3d XPS spectra in Fig. S8a with negligible changes suggested the maintained selenide structures after the stability test, in accordance with the XRD results. For Co 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S8b), the retained Co 2p 3/2 peak at 778.7 eV further suggested the well-maintained selenide structures of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts. The additional peaks located at higher energy side of the Co 2p peaks could be assigned to surface hydroxides formed under alkaline conditions (Table S1) [42]. Moreover, Fig. 4b shows the Pd 3d XPS spectra for Pd1-CoSe2 before and after the stability test. Notably, the Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 peaks were well retained with negligible shift after the stability test, suggesting the high stability of the anchored Pd atoms in Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts. In addition, to further understand the stability of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts under operating conditions, we conducted the galvanostatic start-stop measurements at the current of -0.5 mA cm−2 to minimize the blockage of active sites from the emerging hydrogen [43]. As shown in Fig. S9a, the potentials at -0.5 mA cm−2 showed neglectable variation during the start-stop tests, indicating the catalytic robustness of Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts. The surface states of catalysts were further investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. S9b-d). The well-maintained Se 3d XPS peaks at 54.6 eV and 55.4 eV could be assigned to Se 3d 5/2 and Se 3d 3/2 peaks in selenide structures, suggesting the well-maintained selenide structures during the start-stop tests. Meanwhile, the Co 2p XPS peaks for Co-Se bonding were well retained after the start-stop tests, further indicating the well-maintained selenide structures. The peaks at higher energy side could be assigned to oxides impurities formed in the alkaline conditions for the long testing period. Furthermore, the well-retained Pd 3d XPS peaks suggested the high stability of the anchored Pd atoms in Pd1-CoSe2 structures during the start-stop tests."
12,DFT studies and mechanism analysis,"3.4 DFT studies and mechanism analysis To provide in-depth insights into the influence of the anchored Pd atoms on the critical reaction processes including water adsorption, water dissociation, and hydrogen adsorption during alkaline HER, we conducted the density functional theory calculations. In view of the fact that the metal cation sites in transition metal-based catalysts can generally act as the hydride-acceptor center during water splitting [44], the water adsorption and dissociation processes on the cationic cobalt sites in Pd1-CoSe2 and pure CoSe2 were separately studied. The models for Pd1-CoSe2 and pure CoSe2 were well-constructed in Fig. S10, where the electronic band structures of the surface cobalt sites were calculated to provide a slight on the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates. Fig. 5 a shows the projected d-density of states of surface cobalt sites in Pd1-CoSe2 and pure CoSe2, respectively. Notably, with the anchoring of isolated Pd atom, the d-band center of surface cobalt sites shifted from −1.73 eV for pure CoSe2 to −1.67 eV for Pd1-CoSe2. It is well-established that the upward shift of d-band center can decrease the occupation of antibonding states and thus lead to strengthened binding of adsorbates [45]. As such, the anchoring of isolated Pd atom shifted up the d-band center of surface cobalt sites, resulting in the enhanced adsorption of water molecules on the surface of Pd1-CoSe2 relative to that on pure CoSe2. Specially, for the cobalt atom near Pd, a significant upward shift of d-band center was observed (Fig. S11), further suggesting the effective adjustment of d-band center with the addition of Pd atoms and thus the enhanced water adsorption. The water adsorption behaviors were further verified by the calculation of adsorption energies. As calculated in Fig. 5b, Pd1-CoSe2 showed a lower water adsorption energy of -0.15 eV than that of -0.12 eV for pure CoSe2, which clearly confirms the promoted adsorption process of water molecules on the surface sites of catalysts during alkaline HER with the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms. Meanwhile, the enhanced water adsorption on the surface sites could be benefit for weakening the OH bonds in adsorbed water molecules, leading to the promoted dissociation processes of adsorbed water molecules for supplying protons during alkaline HER [46]. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, for pure CoSe2, the energy barrier for breaking the OH bonds of water molecules was as high as 1.87 eV, which could hinder the water dissociation process with deficient proton supply and thus lead to the limited HER performance in alkaline electrolytes. Strikingly, the energy barrier of water dissociation for Pd1-CoSe2 was largely decreased to 1.48 eV, suggesting the accelerated water dissociation process with the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms. These obviously improved water adsorption and dissociation processes indicated the remarkably accelerated Volmer steps of HER catalysis on Pd1-CoSe2, in accordance with the accelerated reaction kinetics and changed rate-limiting steps as illustrated by the experimental results. Such a substantially promoted water dissociation can ensure the sufficient supply of hydrogen atoms during alkaline HER, where the produced hydrogen atoms could then combine with the other intermediates to generate hydrogen molecules via the Volmer-Heyrovsky steps as suggested by the Tafel slope analysis. Accordingly, the adsorption energetics of hydrogen atoms on the surface of CoSe2-based catalysts could also have an inescapable influence on the final performance towards alkaline HER. Fig. 5d shows the free energies of hydrogen adsorption on different surface sites of these catalysts. For pure CoSe2, the free energies of hydrogen adsorption on Co sites and Se sites were calculated to be 0.66 eV and 0.19 eV. The lowered hydrogen adsorption energy on Se sites could be attributed to the localization of electrons on the negatively charged Se anions in CoSe2 structures, which could favor the adsorption of hydrogen atoms during catalysis [47]. Specially, for Pd1-CoSe2, the hydrogen atom preferred to adsorb on the Pd-Co sites with a much-lowered adsorption free energy of 0.14 eV, indicating the critical role of isolated Pd atoms on reasonably enhancing the hydrogen adsorption during alkaline HER. The increased free energy of hydrogen adsorption on the Se site near to the Pd atom could be associated with the strong interactions between Pd and Se [48], which was confirmed by the changed bond length and charge distribution as marked by the black and red arrows in Fig. 5e, respectively. The bond lengths of these Se-Co bands near to the Pd atom were further summarized in Table S2. Such the strong interactions between Pd and neighboring atoms could also modulate the adsorption ability of hydrogen atoms around Pd sites [49–51], resulting in the optimized hydrogen adsorption for alkaline HER. To further verify the influence of Pd atoms, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was measured to examine the surface sites. Fig. S12 exhibits the typical CV curves for Pd1-CoSe2 and CoSe2, where the double-layer capacitance could be obtained and used to evaluate the ECSA [52,53]. As shown in Fig. 5f, with the increased amount of anchored Pd atoms, the obtained Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts showed an increase in ECSA, confirming the important role of isolated Pd atoms in promoting the alkaline HER catalysis. Taken together, for the CoSe2-based catalysts, our electrochemical measurements indicated that the Volmer-Heyrovsky steps could occur during alkaline HER, where the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules with hydrogen supply as well as the adsorption of these hydrogen atoms have a crucial influence on the HER kinetics in alkaline electrolytes. In conjunction with DFT calculations, the anchoring of Pd atoms in Pd1-CoSe2 catalysts has been proved to enable the strengthened water adsorption, accelerated water dissociation, and optimized hydrogen adsorption processes, thereby synergistically boosting the reaction kinetics in alkaline HER catalysis (Fig. 6 a–c)."
13,Conclusion,"In summarize, we have developed a convenient strategy to synthesize Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts with the existence of slight amount of isolated Pd atoms for high-performance alkaline HER. Mechanism studies revealed that the anchoring of isolated Pd atoms in Pd1-CoSe2 nanobelts could shift up the d-band center of surface sites as well as generate strong interactions with neighboring atoms, which could simultaneously regulate the water adsorption, water dissociation, and hydrogen adsorption abilities for the catalysts, thus leading to the remarkably elevated electrocatalytic performance towards alkaline HER. We believe that this atomic-level-regulating method could be extended to the construction of other transition-metal-based nanomaterials with well-confined catalytic structures, and thereby shine a new light on designing highly active catalysts for energy-related electrocatalysis."
