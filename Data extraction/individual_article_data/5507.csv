0,Introduction,"Energy is one of the majority imperative matters in this century. It is highly imperative to establish clean energy sources and innovative energy storage technologies for the sustainable development of our economy and society, with the rapid decline of fossil fuels and the rise of exacerbated environmental pollution [1,2]. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are extensively employed in portable electronic products owing to their superior energy density. Nevertheless, due to the slow solid-state ion diffusion, the LIBs face the challenge of their lower power density and inadequate cycling stability. Moreover, it faces numerous obstacles to developing sustainable and large-scale lithium storage technology, such as shortage of mine reserves, cramped lithium resources, and high cost. Therefore, it is a keen interest to develop an alternative for sustainable and large-scale energy storage technology. Typically, more and more attention has been paid to sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), due to readily plentiful resource, inexpensive, and related physicochemical properties of lithium and sodium [3–5]. Unlucky, like LIBs, SIBs also display the limitations of poor power density, inferior cycle life owing to the slow sodium ion diffusion in bulk electrodes [6,7]. On the other hand, supercapacitors can deliver high power density as well as excellent cycling stability, but lower energy density. Despite this, owing to the robust combination of supercapacitors and batteries, novel sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) have appeared in recent years as nascent-generation energy storage systems [8]. A high-power cathode in SICs is capable of supplying electrical dual-layer capacitance by rapidly adsorbing and desorbing anion ions, whereas a high-energy anode can allow for insertion/extraction of Na ions. Accordingly, the study of sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) is a hot research topic in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In terms of energy storage, while Na+ (102 pm) has a larger ion radius than Li+ (76 pm), the electrochemical normal potential of Na/Na+ (-2.71 V vs. SHE) is smaller than that of Li/Li+ (-3.04 V vs. SHE) [9]. The mobility numbers and ionic conductivity of solvated Na ions are higher than that of Li ions, and the lower de-solvation energy of Na+ ions will be conducive to the rapid diffusion of electrolyte and the interface between electrodes and electrolytes [10]. So far, numerous anode materials have been reported for SICs, such as Nb2O5, TiO2, MXenes, NiCo2O4, V2O5, and carbonaceous materials [11–18]. Among them, carbonaceous materials with many merits of high conductivity and low-cost have been considered as the most significant potential electrode materials for the SICs. However, it has major problems, including low-rate capacity and inferior cycling stability. Thus, the development of carbon-based electrodes for advanced SICs needs increased interlayer distance for enabling insertion/extraction of Na ions and enhancing redox reaction kinetics. Porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs) as the potential anode material for SICs have numerous attractive properties, including good chemical stabilities, huge specific surface areas (SSAs), high electrical conductivities, plentiful precursors, and uncomplicated preparation [19,20]. Yang et al. developed a 3D framework carbon-derived nanoporous carbon with the interconnected foam-like network for SICs, exhibiting a high energy density of 111 Wh kg−1 at 200 W kg−1 and excellent power density of 20000 W kg−1 at 67 Wh kg−1 [14]. Song et al. reported hierarchically porous carbon nanowebs as anode for SICs and it displayed high energy density ~ 130.6 Wh kg−1 and power density ~ 15, 260 W kg−1 [21]. Most of the porous carbon materials have been prepared through complicated template methods, including silica, polymer bead, zeolites, and CaCO3 [22–25]. However, the former approaches involved the use of extremely corrosive toxic reagents to extract hard templates. Consequently, facile and green synthesis procedures for the preparation of PCNs are of considerable significance and are highly anticipated. In this work, we utilized polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and ascorbic acid (AA) as a carbon source with the help of a NaCl template to prepare 3D porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs) via a simple freeze-drying/annealing approach and methodically studied the electrochemical behaviours as anode for SICs. The results demonstrate that the PCNs possess increased interlayer layer spacing and a highly interconnected porous network, which is conducive to shortening the Na-ion diffusion length and enhancing its insertion/extraction kinetic process. As anode for sodium-ion storage, PCNs-C600 achieves a high specific capacity of 307 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, superior rate performance of 121 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1, as well as outstanding cycling stability at 1.0 A g−1 with virtually no decay over 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the PCNs-C600-based SIC device displays a high energy density of 128 Wh kg−1 at 112.5 W kg−1 and an ultrahigh power density of 17034 W kg−1 at 24.7 Wh kg−1 with superior rate capability and long-life cycle stability (83% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). The porous structure proves to be a potential candidate as anode material for Na-ion energy storage devices."
1,Results and discussion,
2,The formation mechanism of PCNs,"2.1 The formation mechanism of PCNs In a typical synthesis of PCNs, PVA was used as the carbon source and NaCl as template. The carbonization temperatures were 600, 700, and 800 °C, and the corresponding samples were denoted as PCNs-600, PCNs-700, and PCNs-800, respectively. More detailed information is given in the experimental part (Supplementary Material). Furthermore, AA was added to modify the structure of PCNs. According to the preparation process (Fig. S1), PVA, AA, and NaCl were dissolved in deionized water under constant heat (for 3 h) to form a homogeneous viscous gel. In this case, the blend matrix is formed between PVA and AA through the hydrogen bonds and be self-assembled on the surface of NaCl crystals. Subsequently, the as-obtained homogeneous viscous gel was freeze-dried to vaporize the water. Afterwards, the resultant white powder was carbonized at the optimized temperature of 600 °C under Ar atmosphere and then washed with water to remove the NaCl template (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3). Based on this methodology, the 3D PCNs with macro- and mesoscale pores were obtained (the resultant sample denoted as PCNs-C600). The using of AA has a dual function: (i) AA is employed to be another alternative source of carbon to increase the production yield, and (ii) AA will provide extra oxygen atoms to the final product according to the basic structure of this substance (C6H8O6) [26], resulting in enlarging the interlayer spacing of carbon materials [27]. It is well known that the oxygen atoms exist in carbon materials in the form of surface functional groups (such as C=O, C–O, and O–H). It was reported that the average bond length of C=O, C–O, and O–H is 1.23, 1.32, and 0.97 Å, respectively, which is higher than the atomic radius of carbon atoms 0.7 Å [28]. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate that the oxygen atoms would be beneficial to expanding the interlayer spacing of carbon materials."
3,Morphological and structural characterizations,"2.2 Morphological and structural characterizations The morphology and porous structure of the PCNs are firstly studied through FE-SEM and TEM techniques. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the as-synthesized PCNs-C600 (the material supported by AA) possesses a regular and ordered porous carbon network (a honeycomb-like morphology) in the form of a 3D structure, which resulted from the uniformly interconnected ultra-thin carbon sheets. In addition, the TEM images further confirmed that the PCNs-C600 composed of ultra-thin carbon sheets with numerous mesopores and micropores (Fig. 1b and 1c). Furthermore, the high-resolution TEM image discloses a disordered graphitic structure with a d-spacing of 0.4 nm (Fig. 1d). By contrast, the PCNs-600 (the sample prepared without using AA) has an irregular porous structure, as displayed in Fig. 1e. The same observation was also detected even at high carbonization temperatures (700, 800 °C) for PCNs-700 and PCNs-800 samples (SEM analysis, Fig. S4). Moreover, the TEM images display that the porous structure is not ordered and the material possesses a narrow interlayer spacing of 0.36 nm (Fig. 1 f-h). In fact, the large interlayer spacing of carbon materials is favorable for the Na+ storage and will promote the storage capacity efficiently. Powder X-ray diffraction was utilized in order to identify the structure of PCNs samples, as shown in Fig. 2 a. Firstly, it is found that both samples have two main diffraction peaks that can be ascribed to (002) and (101) crystal planes of the amorphous carbon structure, which is also detected in PCNs-700 and PCNs-800 samples (Fig. S5a). Interestingly, the broad (002) peak of PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 samples are placed at around 21.3° and 23.6°, respectively, which corresponding to the interlayer spacing of 0.41 nm and 0.36 nm based on Bragg’s equation. The change of the XRD peak position of the PCNs-C600 sample can be ascribed to the successful intercalation of oxygen atoms after using ascorbic acid as a second soft-template. Moreover, the structural defects and disorder degree of the carbon structure are also confirmed by the Raman analysis, as shown in Fig. 2b. The Raman spectra of the as-synthesized PCNs samples exhibited two main characteristic peaks at around 1352 and 1586 cm−1 corresponding to the D-and G-band positions. Indeed, the D-band indicates the sp3-bond of defective carbon structures and the G-band represents the sp2-bond of graphitic carbon domains [29,30]. It should be noted that the peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) was calculated to be 0.89 and 0.77 for PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600, respectively [31,32]. This observation indicated that the surface defects are increased after adding ascorbic acid as a second soft-template. Furthermore, the (ID/IG) ratio was also increased with increasing the carbonization temperature to be 0.89 and 0.99 for PCNs-700 and PCNs-800, respectively, as shown in Fig. S5b. The chemical bonding of PCNs samples was further investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as displayed in Fig. 2c. Interestingly, it is found that the two carbonized samples are sharing the same functional groups, and mostly assigned to the oxygen functional groups. At first, the band at 3425 cm−1 is ascribed to the O–H stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups [33]. Moreover, the two peaks located at 2909 and 1382 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of the (C–H) bond, respectively [34]. Also, the clear and strong band positioned at 1619 cm−1 is ascribed to the (C=C) for the graphitic domain. Lastly, the band located at 1100 cm−1 is attributed to the deformation vibration of the (C–O) functional group [35]. The FTIR analysis indicated that the PCNs samples (PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600) contain hydrogen in the form of a (C–H) bond, which resulted from the use of lower carbonization temperature (600 °C). Such a functional group (C–H) can be broken during the discharge process giving rise to a dangling bond that can react significantly with sodium ions and generate a high specific capacity. XPS measurement was further used to elucidate the elemental composition and surface electronic state of the as-prepared PCNs-C600 sample. The survey spectrum of the PCNs-C600 exhibited two signals of C, and O atoms (Fig. S6a), demonstrating the successful formation of the pure carbon structure decorated by oxygen groups. The high-resolution of the C 1 s spectrum (Fig. 2d), exhibits three main peaks assigned to (C=C/C–C), (C–O), and (C=O) [36]. In addition, the surface oxygen functional groups can be obtained by the deconvolution of the O 1 s spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2e. Indeed, the deconvoluted peak exhibited three types of oxygen species that can be assigned to (C=O), (C–O), and (O–C=O) [33,35]. In order to confirm the porous structure of the obtained samples, the PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 are tested by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement (Fig. 2f). Remarkably, the specific surface area of the PCNs-C600 was (373.7 m2 g−1), which is higher than that of the PCNs-600 sample (350.2 m2 g−1), as displayed in Fig. 2f. However, the two samples have the same pore size distribution (4.0 nm), as shown in Fig. S6b. In addition, the tap density of the PCNs-600 and PCNs-C600 was evaluated to be 0.23 and 0.29 g cm−3, respectively. According to the above discussion, it is found that the porous carbon nanosheets with high surface area and enlarged interlayer spacing as well as rich in oxygen functional groups have been successfully prepared by combining ascorbic acid (AA) with NaCl as soft-templates (PCNs-C600). The existence of oxygen functional groups will offer abundant surface-active sites to facilitate the diffusion of organic electrolytes. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing will be crucial to overcoming the limitations of sodium-ion diffusion into the porous hard-carbon, thus enhancing the electrochemical characteristics of the PCNs-C600 as an anode material for Na-ion storage applications."
4,Electrochemical analysis of PCNs anodes in Na+ half-cells,"2.3 Electrochemical analysis of PCNs anodes in Na+ half-cells To investigate the sodium storage properties of the prepared materials, half-cells were fabricated with PCNs employing an anode and metallic sodium serving as counter and a reference electrode, respectively. Notably, all the electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and rate performance are measured in the voltage window between 0.01 and 3.0 V. In the beginning, the electrochemical process of sodiation and desodiation through the PCNs structure was evaluated by CV measurement. Fig. 3 a and 3b display the CV curves for PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 electrodes, respectively, measured at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. During the first cathodic scan, there are two reduction peaks appeared at about 1.22 and 0.47 V for both samples, which can be allocated to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer caused by the electrolyte decomposition as well as some other irreversible reactions between Na-ions and surface functional groups [37]. After that, the CV curves are overlapped with each other in the next cycles, which represent its high reversibility of the Na+ storage. Meanwhile, a small peak located at 0.15 V in the anodic scan is also observed and can be attributed to the extraction of Na-ions from graphene-like planes in the carbon structure [29]. Galvanic charge–discharge profiles (GCD) for both samples PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 are shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. S7. The measurement technique was conducted at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. Obviously, both samples demonstrate a largely irreversible capacity loss in the first discharge curves as compared to the initial charge curves and then disappeared in the next measured GCD profiles. Indeed, these results were further found in the PCNs-700, and PCNs-800 electrodes measured at the same conditions (Fig. S8a and S8b); also, the results are consistent with that of CV measurement. Moreover, it is found that the PCNs-C600 electrode demonstrates a first discharge and charge capacity of 1027 and 279 mAh g−1, respectively, with a corresponding initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 27.2%. In contrast, the PCNs-600 electrode displays a first discharge and charge capacity of 771 and 212 mAh g−1, respectively, with an ICE of 27.5%. Remarkably, both samples almost had the same ICE ratio, referring to the anodic part must undergo an electrochemical activation before full-cell capacitor assembly. Next, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were also conducted to study the electrochemical kinetics for PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 samples. Fig. 3d shows the Nyquist plots with the fitted impedance data plotted by solid lines, and the equivalent electrical circuit model was given as Fig. S9. It is clear that the PCNS-C600 has lower equivalent series resistance (Rs, 3.8 Ω) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct, 120.3 Ω) than that of the PCNs-600 electrode (Rs of 24.6 Ω and Rct of 175.4 Ω), respectively. In fact, the improvement in the electrochemical performance is attributed to the higher surface area and the increased interlayer spacing of the PCNs-C600 than that of the PCNs-600 sample, which decreases the required diffusion barrier for Na-ions storage effectively [29]. Fig. 3e displays the cycling performances of the PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 electrodes at different current densities ranging from 0.1 to 10 A g−1. It should be noted that the reversible capacities of PCNs-C600 are 307.7 and 136.6 mAh g−1 at current densities of 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. As for PCNs-600, the reversible capacities were 228.9 and 96.3 mAh g−1 at current densities of 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. When the current density set back to 1.0 A g−1 the reversible capacity still maintained around 163.6 and 127.7 mAh g−1 for PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 electrodes, respectively. Obviously, the PCNs-C600 is outperforming the PCNs-600 sample in all current densities, as presented in Fig. 3e, and even much better than the samples that had been carbonized at high temperatures in the absence of ascorbic acid such as PCNs-700 and PCNs-800 (Fig. S8c). More remarkably, the capacity of PCNs-C600 is higher than most reported carbon-based anode materials for sodium-ion storage in the literature (Table S1). Additionally, the PCNs-C600 sample possessed ultra-long cycling stability as high as 98.8% from the initial discharge capacity after 5000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 with high Coulombic efficiency, as shown in Fig. 3f. After the long-term cycling test, the change of morphology and phase of the PCNs-C600 sample were further examined by FE-SEM and XRD. As shown in Fig. S10, the PCNs-C600 anode possesses a stable SEI layer and still preserves the same morphology after 5000 cycles without any pulverization. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S11, the (002) peak has the same 2θ position (d-spacing of 0.41 nm) before and after 5000 cycles, indicating that the PCNs-C600 sample maintains its original structure after long-term cycling process. The electrochemical reaction kinetics and Na-ion storage mechanism for PCNs-C600 sample were further examined by testing the CV measurement at different scan rates between 0.1 and 10 m V s−1 (Fig. 4 a); after that, we had applied the following relations to determine the level of capacitive effect (b-value). (1) i = a v b (2) log i = log a + b log ( v ) From Equation (2), the b-value can be determined by getting the slope of log (i) versus log (v) curve at different scan rates (Fig. 4b). It is found that the b-value was 0.91 and 0.85 for PCNs-C600 and PCNs-600 samples, respectively, signifying the PCNs-C600 tend to be highly capacitive than the PCNs-600 sample. For more specification, the capacitive contribution ratio can be also determined based on the following relations [38]. (3) i V = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2 (4) i V / v 1 / 2 = k 1 v 1 / 2 + k 2 By the estimation of k1 and k2 from the measured current at each specific potential, the contribution value can be collected after applying Equation (4). It is worth noting that the percentage of capacitive contribution is determined to be 79.6% at 1.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 4c), indicating the significant effect of oxygen functional groups. It is further found that the capacitive contribution ratios are gradually going up with increasing scan rate due to the fast reaction kinetics at high scan rates, as shown in Fig. 4d. Based on the above discussion, it can be found that the PCNs-C600 has several merits accounting for its superior electrochemical performance. (i) The highly interconnected porous network structure is favourable for the electrolyte penetration, which can shorten the Na-ion diffusion length. (ii) The larger interlayer spacing (0.41 nm) is conducive to facilitating the Na-ions insertion/extraction and accommodating more Na-ions massively. (iii) The generated surface oxygen functional groups would provide sufficient active sites to storage Na-ions through the reversible redox reaction (–C=O + Na+ + e− ↔ –C–O–Na) [39] and contribute to the improved capacity."
5,Electrochemical performance of the PCNs-C600-based SIC device,"2.4 Electrochemical performance of the PCNs-C600-based SIC device The SIC device was assembled by employing the pre-sodiated PCNs-C600 as the anode and superconductive carbon black (SCCB) as the cathode, as portrayed in Fig. 5 a. During the charging process, Na+ cations are intercalated into the pre-sodiated PCNs-C600 anode; meanwhile, ClO4 – anions are adsorbed at the surface of SCCB (Fig. S12). And the discharge process is a reversible reaction to the charging process. Fig. 5b displays the CV curves of the PCNs-C600//SCCB SIC measured at different scan rates in the potential range of 0.01–4.5 V. Apparently, the CV curves have a rectangular shape without any obvious redox peaks, demonstrate a predominant pseudocapacitive behaviour. Moreover, the GCD was measured at different current densities from 0.05 to 10 A g−1 (Fig. 5c, d), and mostly exhibited quasi-triangular shapes at all current densities, reflecting the combination of Faradaic and non-Faradaic processes. Fig. 5e shows the specific capacitance of SIC device are 45.67, 40.29, 36.95, 33.53, 29.64, 24.18, 19.55 and 15.36 F g−1 at current densities of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 A g−1, respectively. Remarkably, the as-constructed SIC delivers a high energy density of 128 Wh k g−1 at 112.5 W k g−1 and an ultra-power density of 17034 W kg−1 at 24 Wh k g−1, based on the total weight of anode and cathode materials. The energy density and power density of our (PCNs-C600//SCCB) SIC device are also compared with other reprehensive reports, as displayed in the Ragone plot (Fig. 5f) and Table S2. The results depicted that the (PCNs-C600//SCCB) based-SIC device demonstrated superior energy and power densities than the previously reported works, including N-HCNWs//AC, C(PI)//AC(PI), PI-/rGO-rGO//rGO, HC//BG, CS-800//CS-800–6, and OPDN-CTF//PSCS-600 [40–45]. Additionally, the SIC device had excellent cycling stability of 83% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 with the corresponding Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%, as shown in Fig. 5g."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, a facile approach was demonstrated to synthesize 3D porous carbon nanosheets as anode material for Na-ion capacitors. It was elucidated that the use of ascorbic acid was operative not only to increase the specific surface area of the resultant sample but also to enlarge its interlayer spacing drastically. In this case, the resulting material (PCNs-C600) had a high surface area of 373.7 m2 g−1 with large interlayer spacing (0.41 nm), which enabled it to store more Na-ions significantly. Furthermore, the PCNs-C600 exhibited a superior capacitive Na-ion storage, due to the presence of oxygen functional groups and structural defects. The PCNs-C600-based SIC device delivered a high energy density of 128 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 112.5 W Kg−1, and remained 24.7 Wh Kg−1 at an ultrahigh power density of 17034 W Kg−1 with superior rate performance and long cycle life. The present study could bring new guidelines for the development of porous carbon materials for sodium-ion capacitors."
