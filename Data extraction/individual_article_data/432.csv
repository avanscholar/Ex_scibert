0,Introduction,"With the depletion of fossil fuel resources, growing attention has been focused on the exploitation of renewable and environmentally friendly lignocellulosic biomass as the feedstock for the production of biofuels and fine chemicals [1–3]. Among the biomass derived chemical products, levulinic acid has been recognized as an important platform chemical, which is produced from the hydrolysis of the cellulosic components of biomass [4–6]. Levulinic acid can be further upgraded to other value-added chemicals, such as γ-valerolactone (GVL) [8,9], levulinic esters [10,11] and 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) [12,13], etc. In recent years, the production of GVL has been attracted much attention, as GVL possesses important commercial significance for the application as solvent, liquid fuel and the feedstock for manufacturing polymers [14,15]. With regard to the production of GVL, it can be achieved by multistep processes with biomass as the initial feedstock. On the one hand, the C6 sugars, such as glucose and fructose from the hydrolysis of cellulose, can be firstly hydrolyzed to form 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and then the subsequent hydrolysis of HMF further produces levulinic acid or levulinic ester in aqueous phase or alcohol medium, which can be consequently converted to GVL via hydrogenation and lactonization route [14,16]. On the other hand, the C5 sugars, including xylose and arabinose originating from the hydrolysis of hemicellulose, can be converted to furfural via dehydration [17]. Furfural is then further hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol (FA), and the subsequent hydrolysis of FA produces levulinic acid or esters in water or alcohol solvents, which can also be further hydrogenated to GVL [18]. The conversion of sugars/furans thus includes the multiple catalytic steps with the involvement of both the hydrogenation and acid catalysis. Hence, the production of GVL from the furans/sugars is rather challenging, and the delicate balance of the dispersion of acidic sites and hydrogenation sites determines the selectivity from the furans/sugars to GVL. Taking furfural as one example, the industrial production of furfural from corncob has been long established while the further selective conversion of furfural to GVL is complicated and far from commercialization [19]. From furfural to GVL, the reaction steps involve the hydrogenation of furfural to FA, the hydrolysis of FA to levulinic acid, the further hydrogenation of levulinic acid to 4-hydroxyvaleric acid, and the lactonization of 4-hydroxyvaleric acid to GVL [7]. In addition to these desirable routes, the side reactions such as the polymerization of furfural/the reaction intermediates [11], the complete hydrogenation of furfural to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) [20], and the further hydrogenolysis of GVL to 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) or the etherification of 1,4-PDO to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) would also take place [7,21], as shown in Scheme 1 . Both the conversion of furfural to GVL and the side reactions are catalyzed by the acidic sites and/or hydrogenation sites. Thus, the reaction network during the conversion of furfural is dominated by the availability and relative abundance of acidic sites and hydrogenation sites on the catalyst(s) employed. To have the accessibility of both acidic sites/hydrogenation sites, the development of bi-functional catalyst or the bi-functional catalytic systems via mixing the hydrogenation and acid catalysts together are two parallel routes. The bi-functional catalysts, including Zr-beta zeolite [17,18,22], ZrO2-SBA-15 [23], heteropolyacid supported on Zr-Beta zeolite [24] and Hf-based metal organic frameworks [25], were successfully synthesized to achieve the conversion of furfural or its derivatives into GVL. Besides, Rode et al. investigated the conversion of FA over sulfonic acid functionalized ILs and 5% Ru/C catalyst system for the first time [26], indicating the importance of active metal sites. Other bi-functional catalytic systems, such as Au-ZrO2 catalyst combined with ZSM-5 [27] and highly cross-linked ionic liquid polymer and Co/TiO2 catalyst [28], were also developed for the hydrogenation of hemicellulose or furan-derived compounds into GVL. In fact, the combination of hydrogenation catalyst and acid catalyst is more flexible as the availability of acidic sites and hydrogenation sites could be simply adjusted via adding more or less catalysts with the certain type. The hydrogenation or acid catalysis in the bi-functional catalytic systems could then occur in two separated routes, which could also be advantageous as the deactivation of the one type of the catalyst could be readily substituted without replacing all the catalysts, reducing the usage cost of the catalyst. In this study, we demonstrated the sensitivity of the selectivity to the main products via adjusting the availability of hydrogenation sites and acidic sites in the one-pot conversion of furfural to GVL with both Cu-based catalyst and acid catalyst in ethanol medium. With furfural as the starting feedstock, via changing the total amount and the relative amount of acidic sites/hydrogenation sites, the main product transferred from FA, a product from sole hydrogenation of furfural, to ethyl levulinate (EL) with the aid of Brønsted acidic sites. The further increase of the hydrogenation sites altered the main product from EL to GVL, as is shown in Fig. 1 . Under the optimized reaction conditions, the yield of GVL produced from furfural was up to 90.5%, which was the highest yield that has been reported using furfural as the reactant up to now. With EL as the starting reactant, the yield of GVL further reached 97.7%."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Furfural, lanthanum trifluoromethanesulfonate (LTMS) and FA were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical technology Co., Ltd. Acetone and sulfuric acid were provided from Yantai Yuandong Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. NaOH, Na2CO3, MgO, Cu(NO3)2⋅6H2O and Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. EL was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was purchased from Tianjin Nanhua Catalyst Co., Ltd. D008, a commercial solid acid resin catalyst with polystyrene as the building block and –SO3H as the functionality, was purchased from Cary Environmental Technology, and the parameter of D008 can be referred to previous reference [11]. All chemicals were used directly without any pretreatment."
3,Synthesis of Cu-based catalyst,"2.2 Synthesis of Cu-based catalyst CuAl catalyst was prepared by using a co-precipitation method. Typically, the mixed nitrate solutions (Cu2+: 0.25 mol/L and Al3+: 0.25 mol/L) and NaOH solution (4.0 mol⋅L−1) were added dropwisely into a Na2CO3 solution (0.125 mol⋅L−1), and the pH value was maintained at 10 ± 0.5 at 40 °C. After that, the mixture was heated to 65 °C and stirred for 30 min, and then the sample was aged at 65 °C for 24 h. Finally, the precipitate was filtered and washing until the filtrate was neutral, and then the filter cake was dried at 80 °C overnight, following by being grinded to fine powder. Later, the sample was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in a static air. Before the test, the calcined sample was also reduced at 300 °C for 2 h."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test The hydrogenation experiments were carried out in an autoclave reactor. Typically, the reactant was firstly mixed uniformly with the solvent and the catalyst at room temperature, and then the mixture was loaded into the reactor vessel with a volume of 10 mL. After that, high-purity hydrogen was used to purge the reactor for three times, and then the reactor was charged with hydrogen to the presetting pressure before the heating. Subsequently, the reactor was heated to the required reaction temperature within ca. 30 min and maintained for a specific reaction time. Finally, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature after completing the experiment. The liquid products were collected for the quantitative analysis, and the catalyst was separated and collected for the further characterization."
5,Characterization of the catalysts and the liquid products,"2.4 Characterization of the catalysts and the liquid products A Rigaku Ultima Ⅳ X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD) was used to characterize the crystallinity of the CuAl catalyst and spent catalysts using a Cu target (K α-radiation source, λ = 1.5406 Å). The scanning ranges from 5 to 80° and a scanning rate of 20°/min were used. To measure the specific area, pore volume and size of the samples, N2 adsorption-desorption measurement was performed at 77 K with the instrument of Biaode SSA-6000 using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method. Before the analysis, the sample was treated at 120 °C for 2 h to remove the physically adsorbed moisture. The elemental component of CuAl catalyst was recorded on a scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry (SEM; FEI QUANTA FEG 250). Temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen (H2-TPR) was also used to analyze the reduction behavior of the copper-based catalyst by using a Vodo VDSorb 91x instrument. Typically, 20 mg of the sample was used under a constant 5% H2/Ar atmosphere with a flow rate of 20 mL/min and the ramping rate was 20 °C/min. The sample was heated from room temperature to 600 °C, and the signal was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The reduction degree of Cu species was also calculated by an external standard method. The acidic sites of the sample were also determined by temperature programmed desorption (Biaode PCA-1200 instrument) with NH3 as the probing molecule (NH3-TPD). Generally, 100 mg of the sample was used, and the pretreatment was performed at 150 °C for 30 min under a constant helium flow with a flow rate of 30 mL/min. After that, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, and then NH3 was introduced with a flow rate of 40 mL/min for 1 h for the adsorption. Before the heating, the sample was firstly purged under a constant helium flow (30 mL/min) for 30 min, and then the sample was heated from room temperature to 700 °C using a ramping rate of 20 °C/min. Finally, the signal was recorded by a TCD. To investigate the distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of the catalysts, in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization of the catalysts was carried out by using a modified Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFT cell. Typically, the sample was pretreated at 150 °C for 30 min in vacuum, and then the sample was cooled to 35 °C. Before introducing pyridine as the probing molecule, the background spectrum was recorded. The adsorption of pyridine was performed at 35 °C for 30 min, and then nitrogen with a flow rate of 50 mL/min was used for the degassing to remove the physically adsorbed pyridine. After that, the sample was heated from 35 to 400 °C and the heating rate was 10 °C/min. During the ramping process, spectra were simultaneously recorded. UV-fluorescence spectra of the soluble polymers in the liquid products were measured using a Shimadzu (RF-6000) fluorescence spectrometer. Before the analysis, the sample was diluted to 400 ppm with ethanol as the solvent. The initial excitation wavelength was set at 230 nm with the scan rate of 600 nm/min, and the emission wavelength constantly remained 20 nm gap from it. To investigate the functional groups of the fresh and spent catalyst, the catalyst was also characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) using Nicolet iS50 instrument. To analyze the yield of the liquid products, a gas chromatography coupling with a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu GC–MS–QP 2020) equipped with a Wax pillar column (30 m of length, 0.25 mm of internal diameter, 0.25 μm of film thickness) was used. Typically, the liquid products were firstly diluted to ca. 2 wt% using acetone as the solvent. The external standard method was used to determine the conversion and the yield of the liquid products, and the corresponding factor of standard chemicals was obtained for the quantitative analysis of the targeting products. To identify the chemical component of liquid product, the standard spectra of the National Institute of Standards and Technology library (NIST 2014) were used herein. The conversion of the reactant was defined as follows: (1) Conversion % = Mole of reactant converted Mole of reactant loaded × 100 % The yield of the targeting products was defined as follows: (2) Yield ( % ) = Mole of pro duct produced Mole of reactant loaded × 100 %"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization CuAl catalyst used in this study was systematically characterized, and the results are shown in Supporting information. Fig. S1 shows the XRD patterns of the dried, calcined and reduced Cu-based catalysts. The Cu-based catalyst used copper aluminum hydrotalcite as the precursor, and the subsequent calcination and reduction could form CuO phase and metallic Cu phase, respectively. The CuAl sample showed the crystal phases of the copper aluminum layer double hydroxides (LDH) and CuO species [29]. The diffraction peaks of 32.5°, 35.5°, 38.7°, 48.7° and 61.5° were assigned to the (110), (11−1), (111), (20−2), and (11−3) crystal faces of CuO (JCPDS 48-1548), and the calcined sample exhibited the obvious diffraction peaks of CuO. The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 43.3°, 50.4°, and 74.1° were attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of metallic Cu species (JCPDS 85-1326). As shown in Table S1, the particles size of metallic Cu in the reduced Cu-based catalyst was 9.7 nm. Nevertheless, the sintering of copper species was observed after catalyzing the conversion of furfural in ethanol medium, which will be discussed latter. The Cu content in CuAl catalyst was 44.0 wt% (Table S1). The CuAl catalyst showed the mesoporous structure, which was confirmed by the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore distribution shown in Fig. S2b and Table S1. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the catalyst belonged to type IⅤ and the hysteresis loops was H3-type, which was attributed to the aggregation of the particles [30]. In addition, the reduction behavior of the CuAl catalyst was also investigated and shown in Fig. S3. The peak at 294 °C was attributed to the reduction of the highly dispersed CuO particles, while the peak at 314 °C was ascribed to the reduction of crystalline CuO with bigger size or strong interaction between CuO and the carrier [31,32]. The copper oxide exhibited the weak interaction with alumina support and could be reduced easily at the temperature around 300 °C, as confirmed by the XRD result (Fig. S1). Besides, the reduction degree of Cu species in CuAl catalyst was 87.2%, as shown in Table S1. The acidic properties of the CuAl catalyst are also shown in Table S1 and Fig. S4. A low abundance of acidic sites was observed in CuAl catalyst with mainly weak and moderate strength [33]. In comparison, more acidic sites were observed for the H-ZSM-5 zeolite, as shown in Table S1. The acidic sites in H-ZSM-5 zeolite were mainly assigned to the acidic sites with weak and moderate strength. It has been reported that H-ZSM-5 zeolite with both Al2O3 and SiO2 components possessed abundant Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites, especially for Brønsted acidic sites [34]. Fig. 2 a to 2d shows the pyridine-FTIR of H-ZSM-5, CuAl and D008 catalysts. The peak centered at 1540 cm−1 was related to Brønsted acidic sites, and the peak centered at 1490 cm−1 belonged to Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. Besides, the peaks centered at 1450, 1570 and 1560 cm−1 were attributed to Lewis acidic sites [35,36]. Because D008 has a lower operating temperature (190 °C), the pyridine-FTIR characterization was thus performed below 150 °C. D008, as a commercial solid acid catalyst, contains solely Brønsted acidic sites originating from the -SO3H group, as is shown in Fig. 2d. In a word, more Brønsted acidic sites were present in H-ZSM-5 catalyst, and CuAl catalyst mainly contained Lewis acidic sites and a lower amount of Brønsted acidic sites. These varied types and abundance of acidic sites in the catalysts may play important roles in affecting the conversion of furfural to GVL, which was further investigated."
8,Catalytic evaluation,"3.2 Catalytic evaluation Table 1 shows the distribution of the products in hydrogenation of furfural in the co-presence of CuAl and the acid catalysts at the varied temperatures. At 60 °C, when CuAl was used as the single catalyst, furfural could be converted to furfuryl alcohol (FA) with little by-products observed. The introduction of acid as the catalyst affected the activity of CuAl for the hydrogenation, as the conversion of furfural changed obviously. When acid catalysts, such as H2SO4, D008, H-ZSM-5 or LMTS, were used as the co-catalyst of CuAl, the conversion of furfural decreased dramatically (Table 1, Entries 1 to 5). The acid catalyst suppressed the activity of CuAl catalyst for the hydrogenation at 60 °C. It was probably due to that the acidic sites of the catalyst were coordinated with furfural, deterring its conversion via hydrogenation. Increasing reaction temperatures enhanced the conversion of furfural (Table 1, Entries 6 to 10), except that with H2SO4 as the co-catalyst (Table 1, Entry 7). Further to this, the distribution of the products also changed versus the varied catalysts. Ethyl levulinate (EL) was obtained in the co-presence of Brønsted acidic sites originating from the D008 and the hydrogenation sites (Table 1, Entry 8), as the Brønsted acidic sites could catalyze the alcoholysis of FA to form EL [37]. It was noted that 2-ethoxymethyl-furan (2-EF) was formed as the reaction intermediates through the etherification of FA and ethanol (Table 1, Entries 7, 9 and 10), which was not further converted to EL possibly due to a lack of Brønsted acidic sites. Additionally, a higher yield of 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO) was obtained when Lewis acidic sites from LTMS were introduced (Table 1, Entry 10), indicating that Lewis acidic sites might facilitate the opening ring of FA to form 1,4-PDO. The higher reaction temperatures resulted in the further conversion of FA via the acid-catalyzed routes. Compared with the hydrogenation sites in the CuAl catalyst, a relatively higher reaction temperature was required for the acidic sites including both the Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites to work. The further increasing reaction temperature to 140 °C promoted the further conversion of FA and EL, which were acted as the two main reaction intermediates (Table 1, Entries 13 and 14). D008 contained exclusively the Brønsted acidic sites, which was the most effective catalysts for catalyzing the conversion of the EL intermediate to GVL. However, H-ZSM-5 also contained abundant acidic sites including Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites, which mainly converted furfural into 2-EF and EL. The generation of 2-EF further demonstrated that more Brønsted acidic sites were essential as H-ZSM-5 contained a lower amount acidic sites in comparison with the D008. From the conversion of EL to GVL, the initial step was the hydrogenation of the carbonyl functionality into hydroxyl group in EL [7], which was mainly related to the activity of the CuAl catalyst, but not the acid catalyst. Therefore, it was possible that the coordination between H-ZSM-5 and EL existed that could inhibit its further conversion. As the reaction temperature further rose to 180°, the similar results were observed. However, more polymerization reactions might be enhanced with the increasing temperature and in the presence of the individual Lewis acidic sites, impairing the formation targeting products and lower the product yields. As the co-catalysts of CuAl catalyst, the effects of basic catalysts on the distribution of the products from hydrogenation of furfural were investigated, and the results are shown in Table 2 . MgO, a basic oxide, could improve the conversion of furfural via the hydrogenation (Table 2, Entry 1), which was attributed to the synergistic effects with the CuAl catalyst, as is confirmed by the previous work [30]. With NaOH used as the strong base catalyst, the hydroxyl group might also coordinate with furfural or interfere with the copper sites for the hydrogenation reaction, affecting the catalytic activity of Cu-based catalyst and further impairing the furfural conversion (Table 2, Entry 1). With the increasing of reaction temperatures, the introduced base as the co-catalysts (MgO, NaOH) did not promote the further conversion of FA, achieving the FA yields of 98.5% and 97.0% (Table 2, Entries 3 and 4), respectively. FA could maintain stable in the alkaline environment, which suppressed the formation of levulinic acid or other side-products via the hydrolysis of FA, and the acidic sites were of great importance for the alcoholysis of FA into levulinic esters. It should be noted that MgO could facilitate the hydrogenolysis of FA to produce pentanediols (Table 2, Entry 7), which was not merely due to the alkalinity of MgO because such an effect was not observed from NaOH as the co-catalyst. The above results showed that the presence or absence of the catalytic sites in the co-catalyst system affected significantly the conversion of furfural. The impacts of the availabilities of both hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites in the co-catalyst on the conversion of furfural to EL or GVL were further investigated."
9,Availabilities of hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites on EL/GVL formation,"3.3 Availabilities of hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites on EL/GVL formation The availabilities of hydrogenation sites and the acidic sites in the reaction medium were achieved by altering the loading of CuAl catalyst and acid catalysts to optimize the distribution of hydrogenation sites and acidic sites for achieving the high yields of EL or GVL, as shown in Table 2. With the increasing loading of CuAl catalyst, more FA was consumed via hydrogenolysis route, producing more pentanediols (Table 3 , Entries 1 and 2). Varied amount of D008 catalysts was added as the co-catalyst to change the availability of the acidic sites. It was found that a higher amount of acid catalyst made the acid-catalyzed reaction dominant and thus the reactivity of hydrogenation catalyst decreased (Table 3, Entries 3 to 7). At the same time, D008 with abundant Brønsted acidic sites could directly catalyze the alcoholysis of FA to EL, and the negligible 2-EF yield was observed (Table 3, Entries 3 to 13). EL was produced as the final product when the loading of D008 catalyst was higher than that of CuAl catalyst, and the further hydrogenation of EL did not occur, possibly due to the deactivation of CuAl catalyst. On the contrary, a higher loading of CuAl catalyst made the hydrogenation reaction predominant, as evidenced by the formation of GVL via the hydrogenation of EL. Further to this, a higher loading of CuAl catalyst also promoted the hydrogenation of GVL to 1,4-PDO via the ring-opening reaction of the GVL, resulting in the decreased yield of GVL. It is worth noting that the presence of abundant Brønsted acidic sites also resulted in the formation of soluble polymers, which could not be detected by GC–MS. To further investigate the competition of acidic sites and hydrogenation sites on the selectivity of the targeting products, the loading of CuAl and H-ZSM-5 catalysts was also further adjusted. Under a relatively higher loading of H-ZSM-5 catalyst, furfural was difficult to be converted and the activity of CuAl catalyst was suppressed (Table 3, Entries 14 and 15), and thus EL could not be further hydrogenated to GVL. The targeting product was 2-EF, indicating that acidic sites and hydrogenation sites were not sufficient for the conversion of furfural and FA. With the increment of loading of CuAl and H-ZSM-5 catalysts (Table 3, Entries 17 and 18), the conversion of furfural reached 100%, but a low yield of EL was obtained due to the polymerization reaction catalyzed by an excessive amount of acidic sites (Table 3, Entries 18 and 19). The further increase of the loading of CuAl catalyst shifted the main product from EL to GVL, as the hydrogenation of EL was catalyzed by the hydrogenation sites (Table 3, Entries 20 and 21). In the subsequent trails, when the loading of CuAl catalyst was dominant, GVL was produced as the major product (Table 3, Entries 22 to 25). The reduction in the ratio of CuAl catalyst conversely transferred the main product from GVL to EL (Table 3, Entries 26 and 27). The further conversion of EL to GVL was very sensitive towards the availability of the hydrogenation sites, while the formation of EL from FA was sensitive to the acidic sites. In a word, the relative loading of CuAl and H-ZSM-5 catalysts significantly affected the yield of GVL and other products. On this basis, the other principal parameters, such as reactant loading, reaction temperatures and reaction time, were further optimized to enhance selectivity of the products. The effects of reactant loading on the production of GVL were investigated. In Table S3, the results indicated that an increasing reactant loading was not beneficial to the production of GVL. For example, when the higher furfural concentrations such as 10 and 5 wt% were used, more FA was formed and retained, which was not further converted to EL and GVL. This observation confirmed that the acidic sites were crucial for the alcoholysis of FA. When FA was used as the reactant, the higher concentration led to the incomplete conversion of FA and most fractions might be polymerized in the reaction medium. As is shown in Table 4 , at 120 °C, furfural as the reactant obtained a higher GVL yield than that with FA as the reactant (Table 4, Entries 1 to 4). It has been known that FA is prone to be polymerized in the presence of acid catalyst [38], which led to the lower yields of GVL. Although the conversion of furfural to GVL would also produce FA as the reaction intermediate, whereas the formed FA could be promptly converted to EL and thus the concentration of FA in the system was low, resulting in a higher yield of GVL. When the reaction temperature was further increased to 160 °C, the GVL yield was highly improved using furfural as the reactant rather than with FA as the reactant. In addition, the increasing reaction temperature also resulted in the opening ring of GVL to form 2-MeTHF under the catalysis of both acidic sites and hydrogenation sites (Table 4, Entry 5). The lower loading of the hydrogenation catalyst and acid catalyst impaired the production of 2-MeTHF while correspondingly enhanced the formation of GVL (Table 4, Entry 7). With FA as the starting reactant, the EL intermediate formed could not be effectively hydrogenated to GVL, which was due to the decreased activity for hydrogenation that probably resulted from the sintering of metallic Cu species. The conversion of furfural, FA and EL to GVL were also performed at 120 °C via prolonging the reaction time. It was found that the highest yield of GVL from furfural (90.5%, Table 4, Entry 12) was achieved with the reaction conditions employed. When EL was used as the reactant, the yield of GVL reached 97.7%. In addition, the bi-functional catalytic system developed in this study, including CuAl and H-ZSM-5 catalyst system, also exhibited the superior catalytic performance with the catalysts or catalytic systems reported in the previous literatures [7,17,22–28,39], as shown in Fig. S5. The assembly of the above-mentioned reaction steps formed a picture of reaction network concerning the conversion of furfural over the hydrogenation sites and acidic sites, which are summarized in Scheme 2 b. When the single hydrogenation catalyst was used, FA derived from the hydrogenation of furfural was prone to produce both 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO) and 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PDO) via the hydrogenolysis [40], as is shown in Scheme 2a. When the co-catalyst such as H-ZSM-5 catalyst including Brønsted acidic sites was introduced, FA could be further converted to EL via the alcoholysis route, and then EL was readily hydrogenated to GVL over the hydrogenation sites. To achieve a higher yield of GVL, the opening ring of GVL to produce 1,4-PDO or 2-MeTHF should be suppressed, as shown in Scheme 2b."
10,Catalyst reusability,"3.4 Catalyst reusability The reusability of the CuAl and H-ZSM-5 catalysts for the conversion of furfural was investigated under the typical reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 3 , the catalysts with the varied loadings were reused for four times in the conversion of furfural to GVL. An obvious deactivation of the co-catalyst system was observed. The catalytic system with a higher catalyst loading (3/3 wt%) could maintain the catalytic activity until the third reuse. When the respective loading of H-ZSM-5 and CuAl was 2 wt%, FA was produced as the main products at the third cycle. The retaining of FA and the little formation of EL in the reaction medium suggested that the H-ZSM-5 catalyst might deactivate as FA was difficult to be further hydrolysed over the acidic sites. To further confirm the speculation, fresh H-ZSM-5 catalyst was added to the catalytic system in the fifth cycle of the experiments. It can be observed that the yield of GVL was recovered to some extent, indicating that the reduced production of GVL was due to the deactivation of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The liquid products collected from the reuse at the fourth and fifth time were analyzed with the UV fluorescence measurement to probe the soluble polymer formed during the reaction process (Fig. S6), and the results indicated the formation of the soluble polymers with the π-conjugated structures [41]. The polymer formed on the surface of H-ZSM-5 could led to the deactivation of the catalyst. Although the introduction of additional H-ZSM-5 catalyst could recover the yield of GVL to some extent, the yield of GVL was still lower than that in the first cycle. The CuAl catalyst might also deactivate during the reaction process. The spent H-ZSM-5 and CuAl catalysts were further characterized by FT-IR and XRD analysis. As is shown in Fig. 2e, the FT-IR results indicated that CO, CC of aromatic ring and –CH2– groups were present in the spent H-ZSM-5 and CuAl catalysts [11], further proving the occurrence of the polymerization reaction. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2f indicated that the crystallinity of H-ZSM-5 decreased after the reuse, which might be due to the formation of coke. In addition, the spent CuAl catalyst exhibited an obvious growth of Cu particle size (17/16.8 nm in the used catalyst versus 9.7 nm in the fresh catalyst, Table S2), which together with the formation of polymer accounted for the decreasing GVL yields during the reusability test. How to tackle the polymerization reactions and the sintering of metallic Cu species via the rational design of the catalysts for achieving the high reusability of the catalytic system are the remaining issues to be resolved."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, one-pot conversion of biomass-derived furfural to GVL was achieved via the hydrogenation of furfural to FA, the alcoholysis of FA to EL and the further hydrogenation of EL to GVL with high selectivity over dual catalyst system including CuAl and acid catalyst. Copper-based catalyst can catalyze the hydrogenation of furfural to FA, whereas the hydrogenation reactivity of EL was compromised with the presence of acid catalyst, affecting the formation of the reaction intermediates and final products. With relatively more acid catalyst like D008 or H-ZSM-5, EL was formed as the main product as the further hydrogenation of EL was suppressed. On the contrary, the higher abundance of CuAl in the co-catalyst system make the hydrogenation of EL as the governing reaction, producing GVL as the major product. In addition, acid types in acid catalyst also impacted the reaction pathways. The Brønsted acidic sites in D008 or H-ZSM-5 catalyze the alcoholysis of FA to EL and the lactonization reactions to GVL, while suppress the hydrogenolysis route of FA. The Lewis acidic sites in LTMS facilitate the opening ring of FA to form 1,4-PDO. The abundance of the acidic sites, hydrogenation sites and the nature of acidic sites together governs the shift of the targeting products from FA to EL, GVL or 1,4-PDO. The conversion of furfural to GVL involves the formation of the by-products that tend to polymerize, which was the main reason for the deactivation of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst. CuAl as the hydrogenation catalyst suffered not only from the deposition of polymers, but from the sintering of metallic Cu particles in the ethanol medium. These are the remaining issues to be further resolved via the rational design of catalysts."
