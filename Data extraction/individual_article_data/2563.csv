0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is very attractive for use in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells as a readily available gas, a renewable energy source, a hazard-free, environmentally-friendly and efficient fuel. Among the possible methods of hydrogen production (reforming of hydrocarbons, electrolysis, photolytic and biological conversion), steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) seems to be very attractive. Ethanol has the advantage over other conventional substrates such as natural gas, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that it is readily available, easy to obtain from biomass, CO2-neutral (bio-ethanol) and safe to handle [1–3]. The key technology in the process of catalytic SRE is to find suitable catalyst for maximization of the hydrogen yields and minimization of the production of carbon deposition and carbon monoxide. Cobalt-based catalysts have become one of the most promising groups of SRE catalysts because they have comparable activity with noble metals for C—C bond cleavage in the medium temperature range, but considerably lower prices. The primary disadvantages of cobalt catalysts, such as sintering or deactivation owing to coke formation, can be limited by selection of a suitable support. Use of supporting carrier such as ceria which provides strong metal-support interactions and high oxygen mobility (redox properties) preserves cobalt active phase from mentioned disadvantages. Moreover, ceria possess adequate chemical and mechanical properties to provide the required activity and stability under reaction conditions [2,4,5]. Most of Co/CeO2 type of catalysts used so far in investigations of SRE process contained c.a. 10 wt% of cobalt [3,6–20]. However, the possibility of use of ceria-supported catalysts with small cobalt content of 2 wt% in SRE was also studied [21,22] This research proved that the catalyst with even small amount of cobalt displayed high activity in SRE and hydrogen, acetone, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide were the main products of reaction over these catalysts at 450 °C. Not numerous studies [5,23–25] concerning ceria-supported cobalt catalysts with relatively high metal loadings (>10 wt%) indicated that cobalt content has a marked effect on the ethanol conversion and the selectivity to products in SRE process. As it was suggested [23,24], cobalt content influences the metal-support interaction which results in distinct catalyst performance. As a rule, the increase in cobalt concentration leaded to an increase in the selectivity to hydrogen [5,23,24]. It was confirmed by studies on effect of cobalt content on catalysts performance in SRE process when the metal loading was in the range 5–20 wt% [23,24]. Studies indicated that the catalyst with the highest cobalt content of 20 wt% demonstrated the best performance among the catalysts tested. The same conclusion were drawn by Konsaliks et al. [5] who also stated that an optimum cobalt loading of Co/CeO2 catalysts under SRE conditions was 20 wt%. However, this research [5] were conducted for catalysts containing cobalt in the range of 15–30 wt%. which indicates that increase in cobalt active phase above 20 wt% compromises performance of Co/CeO2 catalysts in SRE. As opposed to mentioned studies [5,23,24] in which an optimum amount of cobalt was 20 wt%, Wang et al. [25] found that at temperatures lower than 450 °C the catalysts containing 10 wt% of cobalt exhibited the highest ethanol conversion among catalysts with cobalt concentration ranging from 1 to 30 wt%. Furthermore, at 500 °C and higher temperatures, all catalysts with cobalt content higher than 5 wt% showed nearly 100% ethanol conversion. Similarly, research of Konsolakis et al. [5] demonstrated that products distribution was almost independent of cobalt loading (15–30 wt%) at temperatures higher than 400 °C what is in contradiction in the data available from the other mentioned studies [23,24] in which distinct differences between performance of Co/CeO2 catalysts with different cobalt content were observed during SRE at 500 °C. It is well known that the preparation method can exert a basic influences on the structural properties of the catalyst such as surface area, component dispersion and strength of interaction which in turn determine the redox properties and activity of the final catalysts [26]. Thus, probably different preparation method of Co/CeO2 catalysts, the incipient wet impregnation [5], one step polymerization [23], Pechini method [24], co-precipitation [25] leaded to obtain the catalysts with the same content but different catalytic properties. This suggestion is confirmed by studies of Carvalho et al. [23] or Wang et al. [25] who compared two catalysts containing the same amount of cobalt but prepared with two different methods and stated that the preparation method of catalysts strongly influenced on their catalytic activity in SRE process and their physicochemical properties. According to aforementioned analysis, there are only a few reports [5,23–25] about SRE carried out on ceria-supported cobalt-rich catalysts. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the effect of cobalt content on the structure and catalytic properties of Co/CeO2 catalysts prepared by co-precipitation method in SRE reactions. The effect of parameters such as temperature and H2O/EtOH molar ratio on their catalytic properties was also examined. The physicochemical properties of catalysts were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Brauner-Emmett-Tellerv (BET) surface area, H2-chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The Co/CeO2 catalyst were prepared by the conventional co-precipitation method [27] from Co(CH3COO)2, and Ce(CH3COO)3 aqueous solutions. The precipitation was accomplished at 40 °C by addition of (NH4)2CO3 solution, drop by drop, up to pH equal to 8, under continuous stirring of suspension. After ageing of precipitate at 60 °C for 2 h, the suspensions were filtrated. The filtrates were washed with an absolute ethanol, in order to remove water from precipitates. The obtained solids were dried at 120 °C for 2 h and then calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. The catalysts were labelled xCo/CeO2 (where x is the content of cobalt expressed in wt.%)."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Catalysts characterization was performed using the conditions reported in previous studies [16,17,19,27,28]. The cobalt content in the catalysts was determined by X-ray fluorescence method using a Canberra 1510 fluorescence spectrometer. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns in Bragg-Brentano geometry were recorded on a Empyrean X-ray (PANalytical) diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Diffractograms obtained for in situ experiments were collected at two temperatures, at 30 °C for non-reduced samples and at 500 °C for reduced samples. The catalysts were reduced in situ at 500 °C in hydrogen flow rate of 100 mL min−1 in the XRK 900 reactor chamber (Anton Paar). Textural properties were determined by nitrogen adsorption measurements at −196 °C using ASAP 2405 N (Micromeritics). Hydrogen chemisorption was measured in the AUTOSORB-1CMS analyser (Quantachrome) at 130 °C. Reducibility of catalysts was investigated by the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiment was carried out with the AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics). The evolved water was removed in a cold trap maintained in the LN2-isopropyl alcohol at −89 °C. X ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed in a multi-chamber UHV system (PREVAC, Poland) equipped with a monochromatized Al source (XM 650 X Ray Monochromator) source operating at 360 W and a hemispherical electron analyser (Scienta R4000). The pass energy of the analyser was set at 200 eV (energy step 0.5 eV) for survey scan and 50 eV (energy step 0.1 eV) for high resolution Co 2p, Ce 3d, O 1s, C 1s & Ce 4s spectra. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was 5×10–11 bar. Data processing was performed with the CasaXPS software (v 2.3.16 PR 1.6), taking into account the relative sensitivity factors (provided by CasaXPS software) for Co 2p3/2, Ce 3d, O 1s, C 1s C 1s & Ce 4s regions. The XPS spectra were charged corrected for a peak binding energy equal 916.7 eV. After Shirley background subtraction, the quantification of the Co 2p and Ce 3d regions was performed by the peak fitting procedure of mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian components, except the metallic cobalt for fitting of which the LA(1.4,5,5) mixed function was used. The fitting parameters for those regions were constraint and determined from the reference spectra recorded over: cerium(IV) oxide for Ce(IV), cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate for Ce(III), metallic cobalt for Co(0), and cobalt(II) oxide for Co(II). The percentage contribution of Ce(III) and Co(II) were calculated using the peak areas emerged by the linear fitting procedure according to the formulas: (1) Ce ( III ) = Σ peak area of Ce ( III ) Σ peak area of ( Ce ( III ) + Ce ( IV ) ) · 100 % (2) Co ( 0 ) = Σ peak area of Co ( 0 ) Σ peak area of ( Co ( II ) + Co ( 0 ) ) · 100 % The samples' pre-treatment were performed in a high pressure flow reactor (PREVAC) connected through the radial distribution chamber with the analysis chamber. The samples were pressed into 10 mm diameter pellets and attached on a dedicated sample holder (PTS HPC RES/C K RG). The temperature of the sample was measured with a thermocouple in contact with the sample holder and regulated by the HEAT2 PS power supply. The samples were pre-heated in a load lock chamber by halogen lamp for 1.5 h to remove volatile surface adsorbed impurities. When the base pressure in the load lock chamber was around 5×10–11 bar, the sample was transferred to the reactor. In order to remove adventitious carbon impurities, the sample was pre-oxidized at 250 °C for 1 h in the flow of synthetic air (100 cm3/min, p = 1 bar). The sample was cooled down to 80 °C in the flow of Ar (50 cm3/min), and after the chamber evacuation, the XPS spectra were collected. The reduction was carried out in the flow reactor at 500 °C for 1 h, by hydrogen (100 cm3/min, p = 1 bar). The sample was cooled down to 200 °C in the flow, then was quenched by pumping off the hydrogen from the reactor. After the pressure stabilisation the XPS spectra were recorded. Studies of the catalyst coking under the steam reforming of ethanol conditions were performed by the thermogravimetric method using the TG121 microbalance system (CAHN) with a continuous flow of ethanol-water vapours diluted with He at 500 °C for 18.5 h. The molar ratio of H2O/ethanol = 12/1. Prior to reaction, catalyst sample (0.01 g, 0.15–0.3 mm) was reduced by passing 10% H2/He flow at the temperature of 500 °C for 1 h. Catalyst morphology was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) using Quanta 3D FEG (FEI). The structure of carbon deposit formed on the catalyst was studied by transmission electron microscope Tecnai G2 20 X-TWIN FEI Company, equipped with an LaB6 source, HAADF detector and EDS spectrometer (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy). Microscopic studies of the catalyst was carried out at an accelerating voltage of the electron beam equal to 200 kV."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test The reaction of ethanol conversion was performed in a Microactivity Reference unit (PID Eng & Tech.) under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor over the catalyst (0.1 g, 0.3–0.6 mm) reduced in situ with hydrogen at 500 °C for 1 h, prior to the reaction. The aqueous solution of ethanol (H2O/ethanol = 12/1 and 6/1) was supplied by a mass controller (Bronkhorst) (100 mL min−1). Gas chromatographs employed with the TCD were used to analyze the products. The total conversion of ethanol ( X EtOH ), water ( X H 2 O ), the selectivity of hydrogen formation and conversions of ethanol into individual carbon-containing products ( X CP ) were calculated on the basis of its concentrations before and after the reaction, with a correction introduced for the change in gas volume during the reaction, from the previously reported equations [16,17,19,27,28]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Table 1 shows structural characteristics of the ceria support and the cobalt-ceria catalysts. The SBET values of Co/CeO2 catalysts increased with the increase of cobalt content which is in agreement with other studies [29,30] concerning relation between this physicochemical property and active metal phase concentration of materials obtained with co-precipitation methods. As it is noticed by Aksoylu et al. [29], the preparation method can strongly influence on change of SBET value depending on metal content. For example, in the case of the impregnated catalysts, SBET usually decreases with increase metal loading because the added metal covers walls and eventually fills up the pores [29]. But co-precipitated catalysts can demonstrate inverse tendency and the higher SBET values can be reached by catalysts with higher metal content. As it is explained by Aksoylu et al. [29], in the case of catalyst obtained with co-precipitation method, there are metal-support interaction which allows the metal to have a direct influence on the support structure. Pore diameter values of all Co/CeO2 catalysts indicate their mesoporous nature. Also the lattice parameter of CeO2 for each samples obtained from the Rietveld refinement are presented in Table 1. The increase of cobalt content led to a decrease of the CeO2 lattice parameter values which is associated with the substitution of bigger Ce4+ ion (radii = 0.97 Å) by the smaller Co2+ ion (radii = 0.90 Å) or Co3+ ion (radii = 0.61 Å) [24]. Table 1 contains also the average size of Co3O4 crystallites of non-reduced samples and the average size of metallic cobalt and CeO2 crystallites of reduced samples calculated from the Scherrer equation. Particle size values of Co3O4 crystallites of all examined non-reduced catalysts are ca. 9 nm which means that the cobalt content does not have a significant effect on cobalt oxide particle size. Similarly, the crystallite size of CeO2 remains almost constant regardless of the cobalt loading as it was also observed by Konsolakis et al. [5]. Furthermore, only slightly increase of metallic cobalt crystallite sizes from ca. 10–14 nm is observed for reduced catalysts with the increase of cobalt amount which allows to conclude that influence of cobalt content on the average crystallites sizes of non-reduced and reduced Co/CeO2 catalysts obtained with co-precipitation method is rather insignificant. On the other hand, the values of metallic cobalt crystallite size obtained from chemisorption differ slightly from those determined by XRD for reduced samples. In the case of application of this technique, the value of metallic cobalt crystallites size increases twice from ca. 8.3–16.6 nm with the increase of cobalt content from 15 to 29 wt%. This incompatibility between two techniques of crystallites size measurement may result from inherent limitations in the peak profile analysis of XRD data with the use of a width of the peak at the half of its maximum, what excludes very small crystallites from XRD data analysis [17,31]. Because the cobalt metallic crystallites in this study are rather small, the results obtained by hydrogen chemisorption seems to be more trustworthy than those determined by XRD. Recent research of Słowik et al. [17] confirmed that the good agreement between values of metallic cobalt crystallites size obtained from total chemisorption and the most objective TEM method is possible if the total hydrogen uptake on the cobalt-based catalyst is measured at 110 °C or higher. Because the average crystallites size of metallic cobalt was obtained in this study on the basis of total hydrogen chemisorption measured at 130 °C, it could be assumed with high probability that values of cobalt crystallites size determined by this method are close to real value. It means that the proposed co-precipitation method used to prepare described ceria-supported cobalt catalysts allows to obtain small cobalt crystallites in case of catalysts with relatively high metal loading. Obtained size of cobalt crystallites for 21Co/CeO2 catalysts (ca. 16 nm) is comparable with crystallites size for the ceria-supported catalyst with similar cobalt content of 20 wt% and prepared by one-step polymerization method [23]. However, the results from Table 1 show that in case of our catalysts prepared by co-precipitation method, even the further increase of cobalt amount from 21 to 29 wt% does not influence significantly on the average size of cobalt crystallites which is still small and equal to ca. 16 nm. It is very important because as the recent research showed [32], the cobalt particle size affects the performance of SRE. Silva et al. [32] demonstrated that activity of catalysts increases with decreasing cobalt particle size in SRE as the result of the increase of fraction of edge/corner atom. Therefore, the issue of finding the proper preparation method which allow to obtain simultaneously the catalyst for SRE with small cobalt crystallites size and optimum metal content is very crucial. In Fig. 1 are shown the XRD profiles of all catalysts after reduction at 500 °C. The XRD patterns show typical reflections of fluorite-type cubic structure of CeO2 [5,23–25,30,33,34] and metallic cobalt phase [17,23,34]. Comparison of diffractograms of non-reduced and reduced Co/CeO2 catalysts (Fig. 2 ) suggests that the Co3O4 reduction is complete at 500 °C regardless cobalt content. Also H2-TPR analysis was performed to investigate the reducibility of Co/CeO2 catalysts. The comparative H2-TPR results for pure ceria and the catalysts with different cobalt content are shown in Fig. 3 . H2-TPR profile of pure CeO2 exhibits two reduction peaks at 480 °C and above 700 °C, corresponding to the reduction of surface and bulk oxygen of ceria, respectively [28,30,34,35]. In the case of the Co/CeO2 catalysts, H2-TPR profiles show reduction peaks below 200 °C which can be attributed to decomposition of residual cobalt acetates or reduction of CoOOH species [36,37]. Besides, in H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts, there are also observed four hydrogen consumption peaks signed as α, β, γ and δ (Fig. 3). Based on earlier reports [16,23,25,30,34,35,38,39] the reduction of Co3O4 supported on CeO2 is a stepwise reduction process (Co3O4 → CoO → metallic cobalt). In general, all authors agree that the α peak with maximum of hydrogen consumption at temperature lower than 300 °C can be ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO [23–25,30,34,35,39], the small β peak at ca. 315 °C can be attributed to the reduction of CoO that weakly interacts with CeO2 to metallic cobalt [30,35] whereas the high temperature δ peak results from the removal of the bulk oxygen of CeO2 [23,25,30,35,38,39]. However, the presence of γ peak in H2-TPR profiles is ascribed to different factors. According to Wang et al. [39], γ peak is attributed to reduction of surface oxygen species of ceria. While others authors [23,30,35] indicated that this peak is related to the reduction of cobalt oxide species which strongly interacted with CeO2 by forming the Co—O—Ce solid solutions. Probably as it was suggested by Greluk et al. [28], peak γ results from both reduction of cobalt active phase strongly interacting with CeO2 support and surface reduction of ceria. The obtained results for H2-TPR of Co/CeO2 catalysts clearly show that cobalt content has a significant effect on the redox properties of these catalysts. The more cobalt amount in the catalyst is, the higher temperature of maximum of hydrogen consumption and the larger areas of α and γ peaks are. As it was suggested by Xu et al. [35], it is observed because the reduction of cobalt oxide would consume more hydrogen than CeO2. These authors [35] also proposed that the presence of cobalt improves the reduction of the surface oxygen of ceria whereas the presence of cerium promotes the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. Interestingly, Carvalho et al. [23] noticed that the increase of γ peak with the increase of cobalt loading of Co/CeO2 catalysts can mean that the higher cobalt content increases the interaction between cobalt and cerium. It is important for catalytic properties of Co/CeO2 catalysts in SRE because different research [23,40,41] indicated that the strong interaction between cobalt and cerium can improve of the oxygen mobility of the CeO2 structure which may favor the catalysis in SRE. The surface composition and chemical states of the atoms of Co/CeO2 catalysts were analysed using XPS. Before the reduction the surface of the catalysts was conditioned under oxidative atmosphere in order to remove the carbon-containing impurities (e.g. CC, CHx, CO3 2−) that are typically present on the surface of the pristine ceria-supported samples [2,19]. Adventitious carbon impede quantitative calculation, hence its removal is crucial. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of the main catalysts' components. In oxidative atmosphere the shape and the position (779.8 ± 0.1 eV) of the Co 2p3/2 peak suggest the presence of the Co3O4 spinel phase. It was found that the position of the main peak does not depend on cobalt loading, which is in contrast to the studies of Grzybek et al. [42]. The fitting parameters appears to be consistent with the approach suggested by Biesinger [43]. Only in the case of the 15Co/CeO2 the small satellite structure at 786.4 eV may suggest the presence of slightly higher concentration of Co(II) species [42] as compared to the rest of catalysts. As for the Ce 3d region it exhibits complex multiplet structure with well separated spin-orbit components (Δ = 18.5 eV). Three doublets are assigned to the different final states of Ce(IV): 2p4f0O2p6, 2p4f1O2p5 and 2p4f2O2p4 [44–46], whereas the other two doublets 2p4f1O2p6 and 2p4f2O2p5 are characteristic of Ce(III) [44,46]. From the spectra it was found that the reduction degree of the pristine ceria's surface was comparable for all samples, and it varied between 9.3 and 10.5%. It should be noted, however, that the relative concentration of Ce(III) on the surface increases with cobalt loading which is similar to what Grzybek et al. [42] observed. The analysis of the O 1s peak indicate three components located at 529.6, 531.4, and 533.6 eV which are commonly assigned to the lattice oxygen in ceria and cobalt, hydroxyl species, and water [2,19,41,42,48]. The peak at 533.6 eV can also be assigned to the surface-adsorbed oxygen. The percentage concentration of OH is rather the same for all catalysts (15–17%). The similar situation is observed for the component assigned to the presence of water (1–2% in the overall O 1s spectrum). Hydrogen treatment resulted in the appearance of a new feature on the Co 2p3/2 spectra (Fig. 5 ). The asymmetric component at 778.2 ± 0.2 eV is typically assigned to the metallic cobalt species. Whereas two features located 3 eV and 5 eV from the main peak are assigned to the plasmon loss features associated with metallic cobalt [49]. The Ce 3d spectra of the reduced samples (Fig. 5) clearly indicate for the support reduction as compared to the spectra of the pristine samples (Fig. 4). It is evident that higher cobalt loading slightly improved ceria's surface reducibility which is accordance with results obtained by H2-TPR method. As for oxygen species present on the surface of the samples after reduction, it was found that the component at 533.6 eV that was present after the surface's oxidation (Fig. 4), disappeared (Fig. 5). The contribution of OH species in the overall O 1s spectra remained the same, regardless of the pre-treatment. Quantitative analysis of the XPS spectra provides information about the surface composition and its re-organisation under different atmospheres. The results presented in Table 2 can be used to estimate changes in distribution of cobalt on the support's surface. First of all, the calculated cobalt weight percent, in the surface layer of pristine samples, was equal 8.0, 17.5, and 23.2% for 15Co/CeO2, 21Co/CeO2 and 29Co/CeO2 catalysts, respectively. The XPS results differ from those obtained by XRF method since the different sample regions are probed by both methods [42]. The intensity of cobalt species increases with cobalt loading (Table 2), showing that ceria support is non-uniformly covered by the cobalt particles. It is worth to note that in contrast to the rest of the catalysts, the 15Co/CeO2 is very vulnerable to oxidation in the presence of traces of O2/N2 mixture (not shown here), suggesting the presence of small cobalt crystallites size [19,47] which is in line with chemisorption results."
7,Catalysts performance in SRE reaction,"3.2 Catalysts performance in SRE reaction The catalytic efficiencies of Co/CeO2 catalysts were studied to investigate the effect of cobalt content on the catalytic activity in SRE reaction. Ethanol and water conversion and selectivity as a function of time-on-stream for the SRE (molar ration H2O/EtOH = 12/1) different temperatures over Co/CeO2 catalysts are shown in Figs. 6–8 . Similarly to the results obtained by Konsolakis et al. [5], the effect of cobalt content on the activity, stability and product distributions of Co/CeO2 catalysts under SRE conditions is observed only at lower temperatures of 420 °C and 460 °C. At temperatures of 500 °C, the catalytic performance of catalysts in SRE reaction is almost independent of metal loading (15–29 wt%). At these temperatures, regardless the cobalt content an ethanol conversion remains equal to 100% for ca. 24 h of SRE process, carbon monoxide and methane are only by-products and the selectivity to the main product of reaction of hydrogen and carbon dioxide does not change with the time of SRE reaction of ca. 24 h and keep at a constant level of ca. 96% and 80%, respectively. Taking account these results, an optimum temperature for SRE reaction with molar ratio H2O/EtOH = 12/1 over all studied catalysts is 500 °C. It is not only the lowest possible temperature to obtain the complete ethanol conversion and high hydrogen production for almost 24 h but also due to slightly endothermic nature of reversed WGS reaction (reaction 1), the production of carbon monoxide is less favored at this temperature than above it [16,52]. (1) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O Since carbon monoxide is a poison of platinum anodes in the low-temperature fuel cells, suppression or even total elimination of its formation is a very important issue [27]. Because at 500°, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane, are the only products of SRE process it is suggested that ethanol transformations at these temperature can proceed through the following reactions [24,28]: (1) ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde (reaction 2); (2) complete acetaldehyde decomposition to carbon monoxide and methane (reaction 3) and (3) conversion of methane to carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of water (reaction 4) [24,28]. (2) C2H5OH → CH3CHO + H2 (3) CH3CHO → CH4 + CO (4) CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2 As was mentioned earlier, at temperatures of 420 °C and 460 °C, there is observed the increase of stability of Co/CeO2 catalysts in SRE process with the increase of cobalt content from 15 to 29 wt% (Figs. 6–8). At 420 °C, all catalysts deactivated very fast because formation of carbon deposits. However, the significant decrease of ethanol conversion from ca. 100 to 80% in the case of 15Co/CeO2 catalyst is observed after 3 h whereas the decrease of ethanol conversion by 20% over 29Co/CeO2 catalyst is observed after 14 h. This catalyst is also the most stable during SRE process at 460 °C and maintains almost complete conversion of ethanol for 24 h. Because more cobalt ions are incorporated into CeO2 lattice with the increase of metal loading, a higher number of active sites are available for the reforming reactions that resulted in higher ethanol conversion [24,25]. The dependences of water conversion on the cobalt content in the catalysts and on the temperature of the SRE are similar to those of ethanol conversion i.e. the more amount of cobalt in catalyst is, the slower decrease of water conversion is. Because conversion of ethanol without participation of water lead to its non-selective transformations, there are aldehyde and acetone as well as carbon monoxide and methane formed in side reaction at 420 °C and 460 °C over studied cobalt-based catalysts [27]. The large amounts of aldehyde and acetone are produced especially at 420 °C and there is apparent relationship that the production of aldehyde and acetone decreases with both the increase of cobalt content in the studied Co/CeO2 catalysts and temperature in the range of 420–500 °C. On the other hand, at 420 °C, there is produced the less amount of two most desirable products of SRE reactions, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. And in contrast to mentioned liquid products, their formation increases with both the increase of cobalt content in the studied Co/CeO2 catalysts and temperature in the range of 420–500 °C. Also Lovón et al. [24] observed that the selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide increases and the formation of aldehyde and acetone decreases with increasing cobalt content in Co/CeO2 catalysts and suggested that it is the positive effect of cobalt sites for reforming of ethanol molecules. In the case of all studied catalysts, less carbon monoxide is produced at 460 °C than at 420 °C. However, its concentration at these temperatures does not depend on the cobalt content of Co/CeO2 catalysts (Figs. 6–8). This result is different from that obtained for Co/ZnO catalysts for which the restriction of carbon monoxide formation in SRE reaction with the increase of cobalt content at 420–480 °C was observed [27]. As can be seen in Figs. 6–8, the methane concentration increases with the increase of temperature from 420 to 460 °C in case of all Co/CeO2. In the range of these temperature is also noticeable the influence of cobalt content on selectivity to methane which increases with the increase of metal amount in the catalysts from 15 to 29 wt%. However, when SRE is considered as source of hydrogen-rich for fuel cells application, the presence of methane in the reformate gas is not very inconvenient as methane does not bring about disruption in electricity production [27]. The presence of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, carbon dioxide and large amount of aldehyde and acetone as the reaction products over all Co/CeO2 catalysts at 420 °C and 460 °C suggests that (1) ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde (reaction 2); (2) acetaldehyde decomposition to carbon monoxide and methane (reaction 3) and (3) aldol condensation reaction of acetaldehyde to acetone, carbon monoxide and hydrogen (reaction 5) occurred [24,33]. (5) 2CH3CHO → CH3COCH3 + CO + H2 As it was mentioned earlier, catalysts deactivation is attributed to the deposition of carbon. To study the difference in amount of accumulated species on the Co/CeO2 catalysts and the rate of their formation, the thermogravimetric experiments under SRE conditions were conducted for H2O/EtOH molar ratio of 12/1 at 420 °C (Fig. 9 ). The results from the thermogravimetric experiments shows that the amount of carbon deposits increases with the increase of cobalt content from 15 to 21 wt%. Whereas the results concerning the catalytic efficiencies of Co/CeO2 catalysts under these conditions shows that the greatest deactivation is observed for 15Co/CeO2 catalyst and 29Co/CeO2 catalyst with the highest cobalt content remains the most active. These results confirm that not only the amount of formed carbon deposit on the catalyst but first of all its type decides of deactivation of catalyst in SRE reaction. Various type of coke may be formed, the main types being encapsulating coke, which covers the catalyst surface, and filamentous coke, which makes the metal particles propagate from the catalyst surface, forming long carbon whiskers with the metal particle at the tip. The severe catalyst deactivation of catalysts is caused by an encapsulating coke as opposed to filamentous carbon [50]. In the case of 15Co/CeO2 catalyst, the increase of the catalyst weight is rapid only in the first 2 h of the process. Then, it is much slower with an almost constant rate. This result indicates that coke is formed on 15Co/CeO2 catalyst surface as a polymer (a polymerization of aldol condensation products) which encapsulates particles over catalyst resulting in immediate catalyst deactivation [51]. It is caused because the formation of encapsulating carbon results in the coverage of a great number of metallic sites and most of them became inactive. Thus, coke deposition is only initially high and the rate of depositions decreases with time [52]. The exactly opposite results from the thermogravimetric experiments were obtained for the catalysts containing more cobalt active phase. The change of 21Co/CeO2 and 29Co/CeO2 catalysts weight is not observed during the first 2 h of SRE process but after that time it rapidly increases. It means that filamentous carbon deposit on these catalysts is formed under studied SRE conditions. In the case of this kind of deposit, very fast increase of its amount, resulting from growing faster and faster carbon whiskers, is preceded by the initial stage of very slow rate of coking because of the nucleation of the new phase of carbon. Filamentous carbon (whiskers) generally do not deactivate the metal surface because the metal particle is lifted from the surface. When present in large amounts, however, the catalyst bed will plug [51,53]. It has to be also noted that the observed catalyst weight change can be caused not only by the coking of the catalysts but also by their oxidation. Unfortunately, gravimetric experiments do not allow to determine undoubtedly the primary reason of the catalyst weight change [28]. The XRD profiles of spent catalysts after ca. 24 h of SRE process at 420 °C (H2O/EtOH = 12/1) presented in Fig. 10 confirms the results obtained by thermogravimetric method. The XRD patterns of 21Co/CeO2 and 29Co/CeO2 catalysts show typical reflection of the carbon at 2θ∼26 which is a confirmation of carbon formation on the catalysts with higher cobalt content. However, this reflection is not observed for the XRD patterns of 15Co/CeO2. The lack of it does not exclude carbon presence. Probably the amount of formed coke on this catalyst is too small to be detected by XRD method which stay in good accordance with the result obtained by the thermogravimetric method. Fig. 11 a–c shows SEM images of Co/CeO2 catalysts after ca. 24 h of SRE process at 420 °C (H2O/EtOH = 12/1). As it was supposed, 29Co/CeO2 catalyst contains significant amount of carbonaceous deposit of a filamentous type (Fig. 11c) whereas less filamentous carbon is observed on the surface of 21Co/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 11b). Probably more carbon is formed on the catalyst with the higher cobalt content because it possess the greater number of metallic sites. SEM images of 15 Co/CeO2 catalysts after SRE process do not reveal the presence of coke on its surface. However, the confirmation of a presence of encapsulating carbon on the surface of this catalyst was obtain by using TEM method (Fig. 12 ). These results are consistent with results obtained by thermogravimetric and XRD method. Increasing the H2O/EtOH molar ratio in the feed is the alternative for controlling the carbon accumulation with time on stream. On the other hand, the heat provided to carry out the SRE process increases with an increase in water in the reactants because water must be vaporized what implies higher operating costs [54–56]. Therefore, the catalytic properties Co/CeO2 catalysts with different cobalt content under SRE conditions at smaller H2O/EtOH molar ratio of 6/1 at 500 °C were also examined. The results of these studies after 18 h of time on stream are presented in Fig. 13 . As can be seen, the significant decrease of ethanol conversion over all catalysts with the decrease of H2O/EtOH molar ratio from 12/1 to 6/1 is observed. The molar ratio also influences the selectivity to hydrogen and carbon dioxide at 500 °C. The production of hydrogen is slightly less for H2O/EtOH = 6/1 in comparison with the results obtained for H2O/EtOH = 12/1 whereas decrease of carbon dioxide formation with the decrease of H2O/EtOH molar ratio is much more significant. Furthermore, decreasing the H2O/EtOH molar ratio increases acetaldehyde, acetone and ethylene production. It indicates that water inhibits the dehydration of ethanol (reaction 6) and aldol condensation reaction of acetaldehyde (reaction 5) but apparently facilitates the decomposition of acetaldehyde (reaction 3) [56]. (6) C2H5OH → C2H4 + H2O The presence of ethylene among products is highly undesirable because it is well-known coke precursor [2,54,56]. Fig. 13 shows that there is not any relationship between cobalt content and performance of Co/Ce2 catalysts in SRE process at the H2O/EtOH molar ratio of 6/1 at the temperature of 500 °C. Taking into account the conversion of ethanol and water and selectivity to products obtained in SRE reactions over the catalysts with different cobalt content at 500 °C, it can be concluded that preference to use of the studied catalyst in SRE process increases as follows: 29Co/CeO2 > 15Co/CeO2 > 21Co/CeO2. In general, the best performance in SRE process among the catalysts tested exhibits 29Co/CeO2 catalyst containing the large amount of cobalt. These results are in good agreement with results obtained by Carlvalho et al. [23] and Lovón et al. [24] who also observed the greatest activity and selectivity to most desirable products, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, in SRE process for the Co/CeO2 catalysts with the larger cobalt amount. Lovón et al. [24] suggested that the greater covering of surface area of the support by the metal active phase due to the greater metal content is, the more active for the breaking of the C—C and C—H bonds in the ethanol cleavage to produce hydrogen and C1 compounds the catalyst is. On the other hand, 15Co/CeO2 catalyst containing less cobalt is more active under SRE conditions at H2O/EtOH molar ratio of 6 than 21Co/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 13). It is probably connected with the increase in deactivation rate with an increase in cobalt particle size [30]. Because the increase in the cobalt content leads to increase in cobalt crystallites size (Table 1), the 21Co/CeO2 catalyst exhibits lower ethanol conversion under SRE conditions at 500 °C (Fig. 13) than the 15Co/CeO2 catalyst. The explanation of the best performance of 29Co/CeO2 under SRE conditions in comparison with two others catalysts can be interrelation of the effect of both cobalt content and cobalt crystallites size on catalytic properties of catalysts in SRE process. The 29Co/CeO2 catalysts has larger cobalt particles than 15Co/CeO2 catalyst but their size is similar to those of 21Co/CeO2 catalyst (Table 1) and equal to ca. 16 nm. Therefore, taking into account that 29Co/CeO2 catalyst has almost the same size of cobalt crystallites like 21Co/CeO2 catalyst but indicates better activity in SRE than this catalyst with smaller amount of cobalt it can be concluded that its catalytic properties result from both high cobalt content and relatively small size of cobalt crystallites."
8,Conclusions,"The Co/CeO2 catalysts with different cobalt content were prepared by co-precipitation method and examined for their physicochemical characterization and catalytic performance for steam reforming of ethanol. The increase in cobalt loading in the range from 15 to 29 wt% leads to increase in SBET. Also an interaction between cobalt and cerium increases with increase in cobalt content which can favor the catalytic properties in SRE. The average crystallite size increases twice with the increase of cobalt content from 15 to 21 wt% and the further increase in cobalt amount to 29 wt% does not influence on the crystallite size. The catalytic properties of Co/CeO2 catalysts in SRE process at H2O/EtOH = 12/1 increases with the increase of cobalt loading. Whereas preference to use of the studied catalysts in SRE process at H2O/EtOH = 6/1 increases as follows: 29Co/CeO2 > 15Co/CeO2 > 21Co/CeO2. It was found that decrease in the water-to-ethanol molar ratio from 12/1 to 6/1 leads to decrease in the conversion of ethanol and production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide whereas the rate of formation of carbon monoxide and other by-products such acetaldehyde, acetone and ethylene increases. It indicates that the addition of water promotes SRE reaction and/or WGS reaction, inhibits the dehydration of ethanol and facilitates the decomposition of acetaldehyde. The deactivation of Co/CeO2 catalysts is attributed to the formation of carbon. After ca. 24 h of SRE process at 420 °C (H2O/EtOH = 12/1), an encapsulating coke covers the surface of 15Co/CeO2 catalyst. Whereas mainly filamentous coke (whiskers) is formed on the surface of the catalyst with the higher cobalt loading. The optimum content of the cobalt active phase of Co/CeO2 catalysts obtained by co-precipitation method is equal to 29 wt%. The results indicates that the performance of the Co/CeO2 catalysts in SRE depends on cobalt content and cobalt crystallites size. The good catalytic properties in SRE process of 29Co/CeO2 catalyst results probably from its unique properties i.e. these catalyst contains large amount of cobalt but the metal crystallites are relatively small."
