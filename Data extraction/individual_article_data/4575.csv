0,Introduction,"Hydrogen offers tremendous value as a feedstock for chemical processes as well as an energy carrier and a storage medium as a carbon-free energy source. One of the major limitations to growth of more widespread hydrogen use is the inability to produce it in enough quantities from renewable sources. Currently, most hydrogen is produced from natural gas via steam reforming [1], which is not sustainable. Additionally, the infrastructure needed for a central hydrogen distribution network does not exist yet. These issues have led to scrutiny of the hypothetical hydrogen energy economy. To support widespread adoption of hydrogen, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) has started a H2@Scale initiative as part of its Fuel Cell Technologies Office, addressing the need for advancing technologies that can produce hydrogen and usher in widespread adoption [2]. Today, there are still significant bottlenecks in scale up of renewable technologies, which need to be overcome to ensure that the proposed hydrogen economy becomes a reality. In the quest for finding a more economical, scalable, and efficient source of renewable hydrogen that may also treat waste products, scientists and engineers have rigorously investigated microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). MECs compose a subset of a more general class of reactors called bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) that harvest the electrons produced by microbial metabolism [3]. Traditionally, a microbially colonized electrode known as an anode degrades organics, while respiring via direct electron transfer to the anode electrode material. In a MEC, these electrons combine with protons to form hydrogen gas at another electrode known as a cathode. Many new products could be generated using the captured electrons if the thermodynamic energy requirements of the desired reaction are met via catalysis or other alternatives. Not all BES products are thermodynamically favorable, including hydrogen. Therefore, MECs use an applied voltage across the cell to drive hydrogen evolution. While many simple and complex substrates have been used in these reactors, the best source of substrate for these devices are renewable wastes. Biomass and agricultural wastes have gained recent interest for MEC development for this reason. Wastes from biomass or agricultural sources used in MECs have included those derived from cheese whey [4], potato [5], cornstalk [6], corn cob [7], switch grass [8], pine [9], guayule [10], and willow [10]. Other isolated compounds commonly found in biomass, such as cellulose [11], have also been used with MECs. Raw biomass and agricultural wastes may also be processed to further extract valuable energy products, resulting in additional wastes that can be used in BESs. The methods that have generated these wastes include hydrothermal liquefaction [12,13], pre-fermentation [14], and pyrolysis [8–10]. The wastes from these processes have little value on their own, resulting in process efficiency losses that may be reduced using MECs. MECs therefore provide a unique capability to valorize waste to generate or improve other products. These include hydrocarbon fuels, which use hydrogen for upgrading intermediates of biomass processing, e.g. bio-oils. Additionally, ethanol has been proposed as a potential feedstock for hydrogen creation by steam reforming [15,16]. MECs may therefore increase total hydrogen yields of biomass-based ethanol fermentation by using the fermentation effluent as a feedstock. Corn stover has been investigated as a feedstock for renewable ethanol production, with large scale stover-to-ethanol plants beginning operation as early as 2014 [17]. Corn stover has also found applications in BESs, where pre- and post-fermented corn stover have been used in MFCs and MECs previously [18–21]. Of interest to this study, ethanol production using corn stover generates a byproduct from the fermentation process, which is the aqueous phase after ethanol recovery. We refer to it as corn stover fermentation product (CFP) here. As with the biomass sources discussed earlier in this section, pretreatment is often used to release sugars prior to fermentation. Pretreatment of corn stover, like many lignocellulosic biomass sources, results in the production of microbial inhibitors, including short chain fatty acids such as acetate, furans, and phenolics [22–24]. While acetate is not an inhibitor in BESs, furans and phenolics have been shown to inhibit BESs [25]. Not all CFPs contain high concentrations of these inhibitory compounds. One of the CFPs generated by Pannell et al. was able to achieve a current density of 10.7 A/m2 in a MFC [20], and this performance could be partially attributed to low concentrations of inhibitors 2-furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural. Thus, further investigation using CFPs could be valuable for generation of products used in MECs. Increasing MEC productivity for all potential substrates remains a point of inquiry. Perhaps one of the highest performing MECs was by Jeremiasse et al., who achieved hydrogen productivity rates exceeding 50 L per liter MEC volume per day at a current density of 22.8 A/m2 using acetate as the carbon source, though performance diminished with time [26]. High hydrogen productivity has also been achieved by abiotic enzymatic non-BES systems. Rollin et al. utilized xylose and glucose derived from corn stover and achieved a hydrogen productivity of 54 mmol H2/L-hr, equal to roughly 31 L of hydrogen per liter of anode volume per day (L/L-day) at standard atmospheric pressure and temperature [27]. Complex feedstock fed BESs, by comparison, have not performed as well. Studies using biomass derived complex substrates in MECs, including those derived from corn stover, rarely if ever exceed 6 L/L-day hydrogen productivity [5,6,12,28] for any size of reactor. One exception to high performing MECs using biomass derived waste came from Lewis and Borole, who recently published a study that reached a hydrogen productivity of 7.9 L/L-day and a current density of 9.2 A/m2 using a pyrolysis byproduct known as bio-oil aqueous phase (BOAP) [29]. The authors further claimed that this was the highest reported hydrogen productivity using a complex substrate. Comparisons between simple and complex substrates using the same reactor configuration and anode community also suggest that complex feedstocks produce lower productivities. Lewis et al. (2017) recently made a comparison between batch experiments using acetate and BOAP in MECs and found that the acetate outperformed the complex feedstock by more than twice the productivity at the same organic concentrations as measured by chemical oxygen demand (COD) [30]. In all cases, these productivities are not sufficient for economic feasibility in real biorefineries. Another loss in performance can also be contributed by methanogenesis. Methanogens are particularly troublesome, as they rob the system of electrons and protons, decreasing operating efficiencies. For commercial systems, methanogenesis must be sufficiently inhibited in order to assure high purity hydrogen is created by MECs at sufficient productivities. Today, methanogens continue to play a role in MECs, and numerous studies have been conducted that attempt to inhibit methanogen activity and growth [31]. Commercial requirements of MECs varies across studies, but often focus on system cost and related performance by normalizing the performance metrics to reactor size. Escapa et al. estimated productivity as a function of cost, and found that MECs would need to operate at a current density of 5 A/m2, consuming 0.9 Wh/g-COD, and a cost of 1220 Euros/(m3-anode volume) [32]. Sleutels et al. also conveniently outlined a framework that established such a target based purely on performance, and estimated that MECs would need to reach 20 A/m2 in order for MECs to achieve profitability [33]. More recently, Aiken et al. used a different approach by focusing on the hydrogen productivity and current density associated with effluent flow-rates and organic loading density, finding that target current densities would need to reach 15.6 A/m2 for the highest 20-year net present value scenario estimated [34], though we believe higher current densities would be desirable if scenarios were combined. Aiken et al. further suggested that the studies by Sleutels et al. and Escapa et al. may have overestimated material costs and operating temperatures of the systems assumed. Together, there is an important take away; if materials will continue to be expensive, current densities will need to be high, as will efficiencies, using real waste products. The range of current densities discussed is clearly broad, with Sleutels et al.’s being the most ambitious. Using the equation described by Logan et al., the 20 A/m2 target established by Sleutels et al. is equivalent to a maximum hydrogen productivity that varies between 18.9 and 21 L/L-day for the systems used in this study depending on temperatures of the systems [35]. We identified 20 L/L-day as an appropriate target productivity based on this range, with motivation being provided by the initiative started by the US Department of Energy Fuel Cell Technology Office [2]. Even with expensive reactor materials, few studies have reached this level of performance using any substrate [36,37], and no studies have reached this level of performance using a complex feedstock, even using a small laboratory scale reactor. In addition to identifying worthy complex feedstocks and reaching higher performances, performance of cells may also be improved by minimizing the operational energy required and documenting the effect of process conditions on performance. Anode liquid flow rate and retention time are such parameters of importance. Traditionally, efficiencies are determined by documenting the electrical energy consumed and accounting for the chemical energy supplied. While the electrical energy used contributes to overall energy demands of MECs, the effect of flow rates and pumping regimes on MEC energy efficiency using complex substrates is not entirely understood. Lewis and Borole described the effect of continuous anode liquid flow rate on MEC performance, determining that higher flow rates would achieve higher productivities in MECs operated on a complex substrate [38], but did not consider varying the flow rate in other ways. To date, no studies have documented the effect that irregular, staggered, or pulsed flow can have on MEC performance, which may be a necessary component to determining the optimal anode media flow rate schedules in MECs. Identifying suitable feedstocks and process conditions is essential to achieve high rates of hydrogen productivity, bridging the gap between research productivities and commercially feasible targets in MECs. Thus, the goal of this work is to investigate hydrogen productivities, current densities, and organic degradation in a mature MEC using a biomass waste substrate that had previously reached high performance metrics in MFCs [20]. CFP derived from acid hydrolysis and ethanol fermentation was used as the substrate and organic loading rate was increased until the desired hydrogen productivity target of 20 L/L-day was reached in continuously-fed lab-scale MECs, a threshold established by Sleutels et al. for economic feasibility [33]. Additionally, the effect of pulsing the anode liquid flow rate on MEC performance was also investigated."
1,Methods and materials,
2,Production of corn stover fermentation product,"2.1 Production of corn stover fermentation product The CFP was created by acidification, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ethanol fermentation of corn stover using processes described previously [19]. Briefly, corn stover was fed at a rate of 5 kg/h to a continuous-horizontal screw reactor operated at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The reactor was operated at 158 C where the untreated biomass was mixed with sulfuric acid, where this mixture was held for 5 min. The slurry was then diluted and cooled, and the pH was adjusted before cellulase was added at a loading concentration of 20 mg protein/g dry biomass for four days. After hydrolysis by cellulase, the slurry was further cooled and pH was adjusted again. Fermentation cultures composed of Zymomonas mobiliz were added to the slurry for an initial cell concentration of 0.5 g dry cell mass/L, along with nutrients to facilitate fermentation. Fermentation was conducted for three days before the slurry was sterilized by autoclave. Ethanol was removed by vacuum, and the samples representing the left-over CFP were sent to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). CFP samples were filtered using a 0.2 µm filter before use in MECs, and were stored at 4 C until used in experiments. Lower substrate delivery rate experiments used CFP that was diluted with deionized water."
3,Chemical oxygen demand measurements,"2.2 Chemical oxygen demand measurements COD of samples collected before and after MEC treatment was determined using the protocol provided by the manufacturer [39]. Raw CFP COD was determined by diluting with deionized water 100 and 500 fold before measurement, which were then averaged. For all measurements, 2 mL of diluted or undiluted sample were used and run in a Hach DRB 200 using high range Hach COD vials (Hach Company, Loveland, CO). These samples were run for 2 h at 150 C. Absorbance was recorded using a Spectronic Genesys 20 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at a wavelength of 620 nm. The absorbance was correlated using a standard curve obtained using COD standards from potassium hydrogen phthalate."
4,"MEC design, enrichment, and set up","2.3 MEC design, enrichment, and set up Reactors were used from a previous study [10], without any alterations to the enclosure and biofilm beyond the change in substrate. Briefly, a two chamber MEC was used, composed of a carbon felt anode in 3.81 cm (1.5 in) diameter PVC pipe. This chamber was separated by a Nafion membrane, where the cathode was a 0.5 mg Pt/cm2 deposited carbon disc that was flushed with a stainless steel wire mesh current collector. The anode was pressed flush with the Nafion membrane, using a rubber gasket between the membrane and the anode pipe to create a tight seal. Hydrogen produced by the cathode was collected by inverted graduated cylinder in a water bath. Two reactors were run in parallel for all experiments. An acclimation period of four days on the existing MECs was conducted before experiments began, where reactors were initially fed 2 g of COD per liter of anode volume per day (g/L-day) of the CFP. In the following set of experiments, reactors were run in continuous-fed fashion at substrate concentrations of 2, 4, 10, 20, and 30 g/L-day. The reactor volume was calculated at 83% of the 16 mL measured of the reactor volume from manufacturer specifications. The anode recirculation liquid media was composed of 200 mL of phosphate buffered nutrient solution using 2.5 mL of Wolfe’s mineral and vitamin solutions previously described [8,40]. Anode liquid media was sparged with nitrogen for 30 min to create the necessary anaerobic environment for the cell. 40 mL of clean liquid media was flushed through the anode before each experiment. For continuously-fed experiments, 12 mL of 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer was used, however the pulsing experiments only used an anaerobic gas cathode. In both sets of experiments, the cathode was sparged for 15 min with nitrogen, where the gas collection volume was then reset using a syringe. Initial gas composition of the anode and cathode was recorded using Gas Chromatography (GC) on samples collected from a septum attached to a tee in the anode and cathode."
5,MEC calculations,"2.4 MEC calculations Current density, coulombic efficiency, cathode conversion efficiency, hydrogen recovery, electrical energy efficiency, and overall energy efficiency were calculated using methods reported previously [10]. To determine if sufficient energy had been recovered efficiently from the MECs, energy efficiency was calculated using the formulas described by Logan et al. [35]. To summarize, electrical energy efficiency is defined as: η E = - W H 2 W E where WH2 is the energy produced as a function of the volume of energy produced and the heat of combustion energy of hydrogen, and WE is the electrical energy provided as a result of the applied voltage and current produced over the length of the experiment. Overall energy efficiency incorporates the energy contained in the unconverted substrate into the previous equation to make the following expression: η E = - W H 2 W E - W s where Ws is the energy delivered by the substrate. Operational conditions were assumed to be at room temperature (23 C) at atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa). The heating value of hydrogen used was −285.8 kJ/mol, and the energy content for the substrate was estimated at −14.955 kJ/g-COD, as used previously [8,10]."
6,MEC operation,"2.5 MEC operation For substrate loadings of 2, 4, and 10 g/L-day, anode liquid samples were collected every 24 h. For 20 and 30 g/L-day experiments, samples were collected every four h for a total of 12 h due to resultant pH imbalance and gas accumulation rates. Cathode gas and anode gas for GC was sampled and analyzed at the same time intervals as liquid samples. Cells were operated using a three electrode assembly. A Bio-Logic VSP potentiostat (Bio-Logic USA, Knoxville, TN) was used to poise the anode at −0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Anode liquid was circulated through the cells using a peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, Il), where it was held at 3.5 mL/min for all continuously-fed experiments. Batch experiments were conducted by pulsing the anode liquid flow rate at specified intervals to be discussed in the Section 2.6. These batch experiments did not use cathode buffer in order to increase potential mass transfer and kinetic limitations in the cell, using a dry anaerobic cathode instead. 100 µL of gas sample was acquired for each measurement. Two GC protocols were used for the experiments. The first used a Thermo Focus GC (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) instrument. The column was a HP Plot Molecular Sieve 5A (Agilent technologies Santa Clara, CA). The GC was operated at an initial oven temperature of 30 C for 1 min, and ramped to 72 C at a rate of 5 C/min. The final temperature was held for 30 s. The inlet temperature, block temp, and transfer temp were all held at 50 C for each run. Helium gas was used as the carrier gas and was applied to the GC at a fixed relative pressure of 30 kPa. Four gases were detected. These include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and methane. Cathode gas composition was used to adjust hydrogen amounts measured in the graduated cylinder. The second protocol used a HP 5890 Series II (Agilent technologies Santa Clara, CA) instrument. The column was a HP Plot Q (Agilent technologies Santa Clara, CA). Like the previous protocol, helium gas was used as the carrier gas and was applied to the GC at a fixed relative pressure of 30 kPa. The inlet temperature was held at 125 C. The initial oven temperature was 26 C, and this was held for 4 min. The temperature was then ramped to 45 C at a rate of 8 C/min. The final temp was held for 1 min. Only CO2 was detected but was not quantified using this GC."
7,Effect of increased flow rate via fluid flow pulsing experiments,"2.6 Effect of increased flow rate via fluid flow pulsing experiments To increase mass transfer without applying continuously high flow rates, anode liquid flow pulsing was attempted. Anode liquid flow pulsing, known from here on out as simply pulsing, can be accomplished by aggressively flushing the anode with a specified volume of recycled anode liquid media at fixed time intervals, where the flow rate during pulsing is much higher than the continuous flow rate used otherwise. The hypothesis was that the increased pressure differential across the anode would carry accumulated gas out of the anode while also convectively supplying the cathode with protons, resulting in increased hydrogen evolution. Pulsing was tested using three liquid flow rates: 3.5 mL/min, 1 mL/min, and 0.3 mL/min. Pulsing was performed by increasing the flow from the baseline flow rate to about 200 mL/min for a brief period of 3 s. This was done using a 10 mL syringe to rapidly drawing 10 mL of liquid from the top of the cell within 3 s. During this time, the MEC was still being operated by potentiostat. Prior to each experiment, anode liquid media was changed as described in Section 2.3, and cathodes were drained of any residual liquid and sparged with nitrogen for 15 min. A batch of CFP substrate was added to each cell at a loading of 0.2 g-COD/L. Pulsing was performed every 2 h at flow rates of 3.5, 1, and 0.3 mL/min, and experiments were performed with clean anode liquid media over the course of 8 h. An additional experiment was conducted at a flow rate 0.3 mL/min where pulsing was performed every hour for 8 h. Cells were depleted of useable organics by waiting 24 h before anode liquid media changes were conducted and fresh substrate was introduced."
8,Compound identification and degradation rates,"2.7 Compound identification and degradation rates High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify organic acids, alcohols/polyols, furans, and sugars present in end point samples of 10, 20, and 30 g/L-day runs and in the untreated substrate. Two protocols were used for HPLC. For sugar and carbohydrate detection, a Shodex SP0810 column (Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan) was used. The mobile phase was deionized water at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, and the column temperature was 85 C. Samples were run for 20 min followed by a 15 min post run. A Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) cation and anion de-ashing guard column was used. The carbohydrates and simple sugars identified were cellobiose, glucose, xylose, galactose, arabinose, and fructose. The other protocol used a Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) HPX-87H column, using a mobile phase of 0.01 N sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The column temperature was run at 55 C, and samples were run for 50 min. A Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) cation de-ashing guard column was also used. Organic acids included lactic acid and acetic acid. Alcohols/polyols included glycerol and ethanol. Furanic compounds included 2-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural. Both protocols used a refractive index detector. Standards for compounds were combined in a single sample and analyzed at different concentrations to establish a standard curve for sample calibration."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of corn stover fermentation product,"3.1 Characterization of corn stover fermentation product The COD of the CFP was found to be 72.2 g-COD/L. Table 1 shows the percentage of the compounds investigated that corresponded to the total COD. No cellobiose, fructose, ethanol, HMF, or furfural were detected in the raw substrate. The proportions of the chemicals detected are mostly consistent with Pannell et al., who used the same substrate in their studies [20]. Still, it is possible that some of these compounds were present in very small quantities, or some of which may have degraded while stored at 4 C, until used in this study. We believe additional transformation was halted once samples were filter sterilized. CFP is primarily made as a byproduct of ethanol fermentation by the process described in Section 2.1. Pannell et al. showed that a non-vacuum distilled version of this product had upwards of 25.98 g/L ethanol [20], however none was found in our sample. While it is possible that ethanol was present in amounts that were below detectable limits, the results here confirm that ethanol was effectively removed via vacuum distillation after fermentation. The identified fraction of the CFP’s COD appeared to be simple sugars and volatile fatty acids, totaling at 49.33% of measured COD. Inhibitory compounds such as HMF or furfural were not detected in the substrate. This suggests that at least half of the substrate should be easily converted by fermenters and exoelectrogenic microbes present in the biofilm, resulting in fast degradation rates and, therefore, higher current densities and hydrogen productivities."
11,Current density and H2 production from continuous experiments,"3.2 Current density and H2 production from continuous experiments Fig. 1 A shows the average and maximum current density and the overall hydrogen productivity for the continuous experiments, while Fig. 1B shows the calculated efficiencies, which include coulombic efficiency, hydrogen recovery, electrical efficiency, and overall energy efficiency for each of the experiments conducted. The largest average current density and hydrogen productivity observed occurred at the loading rate of 30 g/L-day, corresponding to 17.9 ± 1.6 A/m2 and 20.1 ± 2.1 L/L-day. The maximum current density reached was also during 30 g/L-day and was found to be 27.2 ± 2.9 A/m2. The last 4 h of the 30 g/L-day experiments also produced sustained average current densities and hydrogen productivities that did not decrease before the experiment was ended, reaching average current densities of 22.4 ± 2.1 A/m2 and hydrogen productivities of 25.0 ± 2.8 L/L-day. We suspected that these performance metrics would have been sustained if we had more sophisticated methods to monitor and adjust pH, as pH was adjusted manually but dropped rapidly at the organic loading rates tested. The productivities in the last 4 h of the experiment corresponded to the end in the ramp up in performance observed at the beginning. The current density plots at 30 g/L-day are shown in the supplemental information attached. Table 2 compares the performance of biomass-derived complex feedstocks at 10 g/L-day organic loading rate. Many of the studies performed previously used an organic loading rate of 10 g/L-day under continuously-fed conditions. The MEC design and configuration used in the studies included in the upper half of this table are the same, so a direct comparison can be made. As shown, the CFP-fed MECs exceeded current density, COD removed, and hydrogen productivity compared to the other studies using the same configuration. Different configurations were also compared, however the metrics are often reported differently. Of the reactors listed, this reactor configuration outcompeted other MEC configurations using biomass derived substrates. This is likely attributed to the composition of this feedstock, which contains substrates more suitable for exoelectrogenic conversion, unlike the other feedstocks, which contained higher concentration of comparatively recalcitrant or inhibitory compounds [9,10,41], as well as the MEC design and starting inoculum, which had been adapted to these more recalcitrant feedstocks. Further evidence of the substrate’s relative recalcitrance will be discussed in Section 3.4. The design and operation of the reactor also promotes effective microbial biofilm formation for several reasons. Neutral pH’s were maintained throughout the operation of the MEC using a buffered media and manual pH adjustment, and lower pH’s would cause product inhibition. The anode electrode, a porous carbon felt, was used that therefore allowed for large biofilm formation with the available surface area. Shear induced by flow of liquid medium in the anode has been shown to increase biofilm performance and microbial cell density in MFCs [42]. Anode flow also promotes convective mass transfer of cations to the cathode, a feature that can limit performance in batch devices without flow. The distance between electrodes is also close, as both electrodes are pressed flush against the Nafion membrane, creating a distance that is roughly the thickness of the Nafion membrane and the gasket separators (approximately 2 mm). Shorter distances between electrodes have been shown to improve BES current production when cross flow was applied [43]. Anode poising has also been shown to increase hydrogen productivities compared to whole cell voltages [44], which was also used in this design. Overall, our design allowed microbial communities to effectively create and transfer charge to the cathode. These productivities would be less promising if the gas produced was impure. However, the purity of hydrogen produced at the cathode was confirmed via GC analysis. In all runs, the hydrogen produced in the cathode exceeded 95% of the gas generated, while methane was less than 3%. The observed purity may be explained by a few operational considerations in our system. In single chamber MECs, these purities are not regularly observed. Lee et al. confirmed that the hydrogen gas produced by MECs in up flow reactors converted to methane over time, and attributed this conversion to hydrogenotrophic methanogens on the cathode [45]. Lee et al.’s findings support a more general trend discussed in review by Karthikeyan et al., which concluded that methane production was always present in single chamber MECs without a membrane and hydrogen yields were therefore lower [31]. By contrast, a two-chamber MEC with no added carbon to the cathode using a nafion membrane limits crossover of a carbon source, preventing cathode-based methanogenesis. Additionally, the pH at the cathode becomes high (approximately 13) further preventing microbial activity on the cathode. MEC methanogenesis inhibition has also been demonstrated by poising the anode compared to applying a whole cell voltage [44], a strategy deployed in the MECs used here. The membrane also helped prevent diffusion of methane generated in the anode, a capability that would be lost in single chamber MECs. Another process control used to further prevent methanogenesis included active H2 harvesting by replicating the experimental set up used by Satinover et al. using an inverted graduated cylinder to apply a small amount of negative pressure to the cathode [10]. Active H2 harvesting using a negative pressure on the cathode of a two-chamber MEC has been shown to prevent methanogenesis by Lu et al. [46]. Additionally, Lewis and Borole showed that high amounts of organic loading using a different complex feedstock could result in less methanogenic losses compared to lower organic delivery rates with the same reactor configuration [29]. What microbes were responsible for fermentation and exoelectrogenesis while limiting methanogenesis were not determined, however prior studies using this consortia and device design may provide insight into potential contributors. A community structure function has been proposed by Lewis et al. (2017), where fermenters degrade higher order compounds (sugars, phenolics, furans, etc.), which then either exchange products to other fermenters or produce acetic acid for exoelectrogenic consumption [30], though the specifics of the pathway remain unknown. Some additional insight may also be gained from understanding the inoculum used and discussing other BESs that have used the same substrate. The starting inoculum, originally enriched by Lewis et al. (2015), determined that Geobacteraceae contributed no more than 10% of the relative OTUs detected, and that families such as Flavobacteriaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae also flourished [8]. Additionally, Pannell et al. found that the majority of the microbes operated in continuously fed- fashion using CFP in MFCs belonged to the class Clostridia, with some of the Clostridia belonging to known exoelectrogens, and a very small percentage of community belonged to methanogens [20]. Thus, it is likely that only small amounts of methane were detected in the anode and cathode due to selective enrichment of a highly cooperative fermentative and exoelectrogenic community, in part contributed by substrate feeding regime and system design. Thus, while further experiments will be required to determine if methanogenesis can be suppressed at longer operating times before media changes, we suspect that this would be possible with proper pH adjustment and monitoring given the starting community and design configuration. Additionally, Lewis and Borole determined that these reactors could be operated for at least two weeks using continuously fed operation of a complex feedstock without a significant loss in performance at 20 g/L-day [29]. All together, this design demonstrates that adequate process and biological controls can be used for producing high purity hydrogen gas at a laboratory scale with minimal methanogenesis. The MEC efficiencies described in the next section further support the direct conversion of organics to hydrogen in this design."
12,Efficiencies of MECs in continuous addition experiments,"3.3 Efficiencies of MECs in continuous addition experiments Efficiencies of the MECs operating at the various continuous addition rates are shown in Fig. 1B. The anode coulombic efficiency was largest at 20 g/L-day and reached 72.0 ± 0.9%. By comparison to the other complex feedstocks, the anode coulombic efficiency was higher than for the other substrates tested in this reactor design, however it was still not 100%. Certainly, some of the efficiency losses occur due to fermentation, which often releases CO2 as a byproduct, preventing potential electrons from being captured by the electrodes. CO2 was detected in the anode headspace of all trials, although it was not quantified. Dark fermentation may have occurred in the anode, however; this did not result in hydrogen accumulation in the anode headspace. That being said, methane was detected in the anode but was effectively separated away from the cathode due to the two-chamber design used. Still, the presence of some methane was indicative of some diversion towards this pathway reducing anode coulombic efficiencies below 100%, but the electron diversion via methanogenesis remained limited in this MEC design. Cathode conversion efficiency increased as substrate delivery rate was increased up to 20 g/L-day, reaching a value of 109.8 ± 0.3%. Hydrogen diffusion to the anode was assumed to be negligible due to these high efficiencies and because no hydrogen was observed in the anode headspace as mentioned earlier, suggesting that these values are representative of high cathode conversion efficiencies occurring. The efficiency being higher than theoretical expectation is an anomaly, but several studies have reported cathode conversion efficiencies above 100% previously [47,48]. The exact cause of this remains unknown, as reported in prior studies which were also unable to determine the cause of this. One study by Siegert et al. demonstrated above 100% cathode conversion efficiency in a methane generating BES, and suggested that these efficiencies were caused by microbially induced corrosion of the cathode [49], but this mechanism would not be possible for an abiotic hydrogen producing cathodes used in our study. In order for cathode conversion efficiency to be higher than 100%, charge must be transferred through some other mechanism than by current. It may be possible that other chemical species that migrate from the anode to the cathode through the Nafion membrane are being transformed into hydrogen at the cathode. While this has never quite been determined, our work has found that the cathode buffer can gradually change color while the system is operating. The cause of this color change is unidentified, however, it may be indicative of organics that have migrated from the anode to the cathode. We speculate that at high pH, these organics are further reduced by chemical catalysis at the cathode, resulting in larger hydrogen volume than theoretically expected. This may also contribute to lower coulombic efficiencies found in these systems than in other studies shown in Table 2. In addition, fouling regularly occurred on the Nafion membranes used in this study, resulting in dark colored membranes, although MEC performance reached a steady state and did not worsen over time of the experiments. From a performance perspective, fouled cation exchange membranes have been shown to operate at lower coulombic efficiencies compared to new membranes, although this is not necessarily attributed to biofouling [50]. Further investigation of the morphology of Nafion biofilms and physiochemical characteristics of biofouling in high performance MECs may be needed to explain the discrepancies in efficiency found in this study. Not all of the trends observed with cathode conversion efficiency are unusual. Our findings show that the cathode conversion efficiency increased with loading rate, which is consistent with previous studies [8,51], which also achieved high cathode conversion efficiencies. These high values can be attributed to design. The distance between the electrodes was minimized, where MECs with high cathode conversion efficiencies have been demonstrated with devices using small electrode separation [52]. Thus, even though the efficiencies demonstrated exceed 100%, we expected high efficiency because of design considerations. Further, platinum, a commonly used catalyst in MECs, allowed for ready and easy conversion of hydrogen at these efficiencies, though platinum is not always necessary for high or comparable performance to other catalysts [37]. While fabricating smaller distance between electrodes is feasible for commercial systems, platinum use remains a limitation for future designs, as platinum is expensive. Finding more affordable cathode catalysts that can facilitate high productivities remains a critical point of inquiry. Hydrogen recovery increased as loading increased up to 20 g/L-day, where it was highest at 79.1 ± 1.2%. These high values for hydrogen recovery suggest that much of the contributed COD was directly converted to hydrogen via electrons, which can be credited to the exoelectrogenic population’s ability to convert the diverse compounds present in CFP into current and the adequately catalyzed cathode, without scavenging in the anode or cathode. Table 2 shows that both anode coulombic efficiency and hydrogen recovery were higher than the equivalent organic loading using other substrates, where the CFP operated MECs achieved an anode coulombic efficiency and hydrogen recovery of 61.3 ± 0.3% and 60.8 ± 1.7% respectively at 10 g/L-day. Electrical efficiency was highest at 2 g/L-day at 133.1 ± 0.09%, while overall energy efficiency was highest at 20 g/L-day, equal to 54.7 ± 0.2%. Table 2 does not include these metrics because not all the studies referenced calculated them. However, some comparison will be useful here. Lewis et al. achieved electrical efficiencies approximately 161% and overall energy efficiencies just above 60% at 2 g/L-day [8]. It is likely the electrical efficiency and overall efficiency are largely governed by mass transfer limitations, as the applied voltage was consistently higher in the cells operating on CFP than on BOAP. Here, the applied voltage reached a maximum of 1.41 ± 0.17 V at 30 g/L-day, and the other voltages can be found in supplemental information. Because the MECs operated here are anode-poised, the high cell voltage indicates rising energy requirements of the cathode to continue the reaction that cannot be attributed to anode limitations. The cathode’s increased energy demands can be explained by the following factors. Insufficient cathode catalysis will increase the cathode operating potential, however, this can be effectively ruled out in this study because a platinum-deposited carbon catalyst was used. The other possibility is the lack of protons at the cathode caused by insufficient proton transfer from the anode to the cathode. Proton transfer limitations in MECs has been reported previously, first demonstrated to be influenced by membrane selection by Rozendal et al. [53] and later by Torres et al., who showed that increased anode buffer concentration and pH could alleviate limitations caused by proton transfer, thereby improving current densities while maintaining a constant anode potential [54]. Cathode limitations become more apparent as the current densities and hydrogen productivities increase. A recent study identified proton transfer as a major limitation at high loading conditions using a complex substrate and the same reactor configuration used in this study [55]. In our study, the highest organic loading rate used resulted in the highest operating voltage and lowest electrical efficiency. Improvements in cathode conversion efficiency would also increase electrical efficiency, however cathode conversion efficiency peaked at 20 g/L-day, and voltage continued to rise past 20 g/L-day, being responsible for the loss in efficiency past 20 g/L-day. Deployed systems can use applied cell potential vs. poised anode potential to manage efficiency, but we believe this drop in electrical efficiency is explained by the changes in cathode efficiency and applied voltages observed. While no study has reached this level of performance using a complex substrate, most cells in literature have not reached high voltages. Even Jeremiasse et al. used only an applied cell voltage of 1 V to their system to reach the performance discussed earlier [26]. Further work is needed on optimizing energy requirements to achieve high overall electrical efficiency without sacrificing hydrogen productivity."
13,Conversion of compounds determined by HPLC,"3.4 Conversion of compounds determined by HPLC Fig. 2 shows the percent removal of compounds (A) and the rate of removal of those compounds (B) for 10, 20, and 30 g/L-day experiments. In general, the compounds identified were removed to the point of being below detectable limits for all trials except for xylose, arabinose, and acetate at 30 g/L-day, and galactose at 20 g/L-day. As shown in Fig. 2B, the highest removal rate among all compounds was that for xylose, equal to 4.92 ± 0.41 g/L-day obtained at a loading rate of 30 g/L-day. Besides acetate, which is regularly used in BES studies, the detected compounds have all been used in BESs in the past with high percent removal, exceeding 80% for most compounds. [56–59]. Therefore, this level of removal is not surprising, but the ability to convert almost 100% of the variety of sugars and their fermentation products regularly found in complex substrates is important from a commercial standpoint. These results suggest that MECs can be used to generate relatively clean effluent while also effectively producing high value products such as hydrogen. Such high level of conversion into hydrogen is not possible by other methods like dark fermentation, which can only produce four moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose by the following reaction [60]: C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 Dark fermentation produces unutilized secondary organic metabolites, including acetate shown above. For MECs, the number of electrons credited to the COD of glucose is equal to six moles of chemical oxygen demand per mole of glucose, creating a theoretical maximum of 12 moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose. Thus, MECs should be able to convert more organic material to hydrogen than dark fermentation. Further, secondary metabolites produced such as acetate are also consumed in MECs for hydrogen production. The acetate produced in the equation above will yield a maximum of 8 moles of hydrogen in a MEC. For this reason, dark fermentation has been used in conjunction with MECs [6,11]. These findings can also help elucidate some important mechanisms that may be taking place that explain the high conversion rates and large hydrogen production. None of the furanic compounds that have been previously identified in other biomass substrates used in MECs like furfural and HMF [8,9,51] were detected in this substrate, suggesting that substrate inhibition may be less of a contributing factor to performance. However, it is still likely that recalcitrant chemicals exist, as not all the organic content was removed according to COD measurements. Using the 10 g/L-day experiment as an example, 24.2% of the COD remained unconverted, as shown in Table 2. Correctly identifying these remaining compounds will be the first step in uncovering the recalcitrance of these substrates From the chemicals that were successfully detected, the variance in degradation of acetate may seem peculiar. Acetate accumulated in one of the replicates at the end of the 30 g/L-day experiment, resulting in significant variability shown in Fig. 2B illustrated by the error bars, most likely contributing to the lower COD conversion percentage than what was observed at 10 g/L-day. This may be explained by acetate’s role in other MECs operating on complex feedstocks. Lewis et al. 2017 determined that acetate is an intermediate product in MECs operating on BOAPs, where it accumulated under open circuit conditions during a batch experiment of 0.5 g/L [30]. At the high organic loading rates used in this study, it is possible that acetate was not consumed as quickly as it was generated in the second replicate, while the first replicate converted all the supplied and generated acetate. This is further shown by the second replicate’s lower current density and hydrogen productivity, reflected in the variability of the efficiencies shown in Fig. 1B. Why and how acetate was not effectively converted in the second replicate at 30 g/L-day could be answered by several explanations. The community structure may not be the same in both cells, where one cell may contain more exoelectrogens than the other, while fermenters dominate in the underperforming cell. Detecting community structure differences between anodes at such high performances, and identifying the pathways used by the consortia, would help explain these discrepancies. The MECs may also have different operational limitations due to anode flow profile dissimilarity, membrane fouling, or other mechano-chemical structural nuances in the cell. These differences can exacerbate performance changes at high organic loading conditions otherwise not found at lower organic loading. These issues will be worth consideration for future designs. Commercially viable MECs will require large absolute hydrogen production rates not demonstrated in lab scale experiments, while using high organic loading such as the loading rates used here. As shown by the increased variability at 30 g/L-day, such discrepancies will likely be prevalent in larger systems. Thus, commercially viable MECs will require much more precise design and engineering that may not be obvious when operating at lower organic loading rates. Currently, few if any studies have incorporated design changes to improve acetate consumption at such high organic loading rates using complex substrates."
14,Results from pulsing experiments,"3.5 Results from pulsing experiments Because flow rate has been shown to alleviate proton transfer limitations and improve hydrogen production [38,55], we expected increases in flow rate through pulsed flow would promote proton transfer and therefore, increase current and hydrogen productivity. Fig. 3 shows the current density response as a function of pulsing at flow rates of 0.3 mL/min (A), 1 mL/min (B) and 3.5 mL/min (C). In all cases, current increased sharply after pulsing anode liquid through the anode before returning to baseline current gradually over a period of 30 min. Average current density increased substantially as flow rate was increased but did not increase as much when the anode was pulsed. Table 3 shows the performance comparisons of pulsing, including average current density, hydrogen productivity, and electrical efficiency. The largest average current density observed was 8.8 ± 1.1 A/m2 while pulsed flow was performed at 3.5 mL/min operated MECs. However, the non-pulsed cells at the same flow rate had an average current density of 8.2 ± 1.0 A/m2, indicating only a marginal difference in current density. The increase in current density did not necessarily appear more pronounced at lower flow rates either. At 0.3 mL/min, the average current density was 3.6 ± 1.1 A/m2, while pulsing every hour increased it to 4.2 ± 1.1 A/m2. Thus, continuous flow rates appeared to be much more capable of establishing higher current densities than pulses. A separate metric, hydrogen productivity, increased after pulsing for all flow rates except 1 mL/min. The maximum hydrogen productivity was 10.0 ± 1.4 L/L-day at 3.5 mL/min flow rate with 2 h pulses, versus 9.1 ± 1.1 L/L-day at the same flow rate without pulses. The lowest observed hydrogen productivity corresponded to non-pulsed samples at 0.3 mL/min flow rates, reaching only 3.7 ± 1.1 L/L-day. Hourly pulsed samples at the same flow rate achieved hydrogen productivities of 4.8 ± 1.1 L/L-day. These further confirm the idea that increased flow rate in cross flow systems can improve hydrogen productivity as discovered earlier [38,55], despite this being a novel flow regime change. In high performing two chamber MECs like those used here, gases produced by the anode can accumulate at the interface of the anode and the membrane, further impeding mass transfer and increasing cell resistance. To ensure hydraulic conductivity between the electrodes, these gases should be purged, with increasing frequency of accumulation as the substrate delivery rate increases and anode gases are produced. Pulsing provides this benefit by creating the necessary fluid pressure differential to remove these gases. Pulsing did not necessarily decrease the operating voltage. MEC operating voltage remained at 1.1 V at 0.3 mL/min regardless of pulsing, and was highest at both 1 mL/min and 3.5 mL/min at 1.2 V. Pulsing did not also appear to increase electrical efficiency at higher flowrates, however this difference was pronounced at 0.3 mL/min. Pulsing every hour at 0.3 mL/min anode liquid flow rates reached an electrical efficiency of 149.2 ± 8.6%, but without pulsing the same anode liquid media flow rates achieved an electrical efficiency of only 138.5 ± 9.5%. This increase in electrical efficiency is significant because it also corresponds with a higher current density and hydrogen productivity. With pulsing at the lowest flow rate, all of the performance metrics improved due to frequency of pulsing. This suggests that pulsing could be used as an alternative means of producing more current and hydrogen along with increasing anode liquid flow rates. However, the current densities and hydrogen productivities are still higher at higher flow rates than at 0.3 mL/min at all pulsing frequencies. Thus, if the goal of MECs is to generate the highest hydrogen productivity, then high flow rates may be the most effective way to accomplish this goal. Operators may decide to balance maximizing hydrogen productivity with electrical efficiency. This added option to adjust electrical efficiency by running dynamic anode liquid flow schedules may prove to be valuable based on owner preferences. Owners that want to save operation costs but are willing to sacrifice hydrogen production rates may opt to run their systems with lower flow rates and pulsing. More rigorous pulsed flow studies that vary the duty cycle of the liquid flow rate between high and lower flow rates may also be required. In this study, the average flow rates were changed only marginally as pulses were applied. For example, the average flow rate was estimated to increase by 0.16 mL/min with hourly pulses, and 0.07 mL/min for pulses conducted every two hours. Further pulse studies should be conducted that change average flow more significantly, randomly, or by ramping flow rate. Increasing anode liquid media flowrates has been shown to increase hydrogen productivity by alleviating mass transfer limitations [38], however alternative pumping schedules, such as flowrate pulsing, had not been tested until here. Other flow regimes, rather than strictly continuous flow rates commonly discussed, may increase hydrogen productivities while also reducing MEC electrical energy demands and therefore cost of operation. While this study did not determine the energy use of anode liquid pumps used, the findings support further study. Within the context of flow profiles in BESs, modeling and optimizing flow in BESs has seen some interest. Massaglia et al. analyzed the fluid flow created by a MFC enclosure and the amount of anode area exposed to liquid the cells experienced using computational fluid dynamics on three different cell geometries [61]. The authors concluded that longer chamber “drop” style anodes would produce more exposed anode area and therefore higher power densities, confirming performance with acetate fed experiments in the reactors modeled. More recently, finite element methods have been used to characterize perpendicular flow through a porous carbon fabric versus parallel flow over an anode [62]. The authors found that perpendicular flow enhanced convective mass transfer in microbial fuel cells compared to more traditional parallel flow. These same insights can be useful for MECs, despite this kind of modeling not being regularly conducted on MECs. For both studies, the models did not calculate the possible flow regime changes associated with the biofilm formation in a porous electrode. The biofilm on the anode continuously changes, which changes the tortuous pathway of the fluid in ways that can be difficult to predict. This phenomenon of continuously changing biofilm structure is qualitatively evident by the turbidity of the media, discoloration of the anode material, and increased resistance to fluid flow when the MEC anode is flushed with new liquid media as it is maintained. To truly optimize MEC anode flow modeling, these affects will need to be considered. As new modeling constraints are incorporated, models will continue to improve future enclosure designs and aid in the discovery of anode liquid pump operational strategies that reduce total costs. Further computational fluid dynamics modeling of MECs will be useful, if not necessary, for improving MEC performance."
15,Implications for future MEC applications,"The work presented here indicates that complex feedstocks can be used to reach potentially commercial targets in MECs using laboratory-scale systems. As mentioned in the introduction, MECs have been estimated to require current densities as high as 20 A/m2 for economic feasibility by Sleutels et al. [33] corresponding to a hydrogen productivity of 20.7 L/L-day. This hydrogen productivity was achieved by the MECs used in this study. Additionally, substrates that are complex can still be degraded at high percentages, and multiple compounds can be degraded simultaneously and effectively in MECs. Current densities and hydrogen productivities can also be modified by using irregular or pulsed flow rates instead of continuous anode liquid media flow, which may be beneficial to purge gas accumulation and also reduce pump requirements. However, continuous liquid flow rates and pulsed flow rates seems to both increase hydrogen productivity. These findings show promise for future systems. If the productivities demonstrated here can be successfully sustained in systems at scale, then biorefineries will benefit from incorporating MECs into their design. Additionally, CFP has been shown to be a useful substrate that can be produced regularly and easily. Today, CFP is primarily considered as a waste product, and therefore acts as a deterrent for more widespread adoption of corn stover-derived fuel. The potential to produce hydrogen from this resultant waste product adds value to corn stover as a fuel producing biomass, potentially incorporating MEC technology in biorefineries that now can be used to make even greater yields of hydrogen than by ethanol production alone. With the demonstrated productivities used here, corn stover wastes may also find itself as part of a feedstock for additional energy applications beyond ethanol, being used to create hydrogen even as a standalone product. While the productivities demonstrated here are promising, several other challenges will need to be overcome for enabling commercial feasibility. Buffered media was required to help maintain pH, which may be impractical for real world systems from a cost and operational perspective. MECs will need to be capable of using real waste streams without buffers. Additionally, MEC scale up is still a significant issue, which so far has not been solved. While the systems used here achieved normalized productivity targets on a laboratory scale, this is traditionally not true for larger systems. A pilot study using a 100 L system operated on domestic wastewater documented by Heidrich et al. [63], reached an average productivity of only 0.007 L/L reactor volume -day, several orders of magnitude less than the MECs used in this study. Larger MECs almost always have lower productivities than smaller MECs, though this difference is not always significant. A study by Cotterill et al. produced 0.003 L of H2 per tank volume per day with a total anode tank volume 175 L, and produced 0.004 L of H2 per tank volume per day with an anode tank volume 30 L at ambient winter temperatures [64]. The authors concluded that this difference was negligible. Ultimately, these productivities are also still several orders of magnitude less than the commercial targets identified earlier in the introduction. Additionally, MECs will require improved charge transfer and reduced cost of cathode catalyst to reach commercial feasibility. Even with the addition of a platinum deposited carbon catalyst, voltages were still high, resulting in lower electrical efficiency at 30 g/L-day. This may be alleviated by directly transferring protons to the cathode without a membrane, however; this strategy has shown to encourage cathode colonization of methanogens in many studies [31]. Inhibiting methanogenesis while improving hydrogen yields and lowering operating voltages remains a problem that future MECs must solve before commercial deployment. Finally, changing flow regimes rather than steady state flow rates must be better understood for large scale systems. While the pulsed rates were 200 mL/min, proportionally large flow rates may not be possible in larger systems. What larger flow rates are allowed will need to be studied further. All of the issues described here remain, and will require innovative solutions not demonstrated here. However, with the demonstration of 20 L/L-day productivity using a complex feedstock, researchers can be assured that such high productivities are possible. Commercial systems will need to demonstrate the productivities at larger overall scales. To determine appropriate scaling, accounting for the volume of the system is necessary, as it is important in determining the capital expense (CapEx) of the system. Necessary reactor volumes and productivities rely on the systems using hydrogen, which can include larger systems used in transportation or materials handling needs, or smaller systems such as fuel cell driven forklifts. For the former, we estimate that hydrogen production needs to be at least 100 kg/day, while the latter will require 10–50 kg/day. Based on the lowest demand, the required MEC volume will be at least 6 m3 of anode volume, assuming the productivities mentioned are achieved. Escapa et al. estimated that a CapEx of $1500/m3-anode (€1220/m3-anode) would make MEC technology economically feasible if a current density of 5 A/m2 were reached [32]. At current densities of 20 A/m2, a 4-fold higher cost of MEC ($6000/m3-anode) would be acceptable, assuming that the MEC cost is the dominant contributor to the CapEx. By contrast, Aiken et al. used a reverse approach. They determined CapEx based on material costs, and then estimated current density needed to achieve breakeven point. Based on the reduction in materials costs they suggested, the CapEx for our MEC design would be $4000/m3-anode. Aiken et al. indicated that a current density of 3 A/m2 would make their system reach breakeven point [34]. Thus, the higher current density achieved using corn stover-derived waste feedstock suggests that the MEC technology can be economically feasible. However, this performance must be demonstrated in larger scale reactors. The compact design of the MEC used in this study has potential to be scaled-up to demonstrate such performance. It is expected that the aspect ratio of the reactor may change as it is scaled-up, however, other design and process parameters such as anode-cathode distance, high electrode area to anode volume ratio, and flow-through operation need to be maintained. The materials to be used at a larger scale will need to be of lower cost, as platinum and Nafion are still cost prohibitive for scaled commercial systems. Thus, while much of the design remains the same, the effect of change in materials used, such as the use of a stainless-steel cathode vs. platinum as the cathode catalyst, will need to be examined. However, it should be noted that the key factor in achieving the performance obtained in this study was the anode biocatalyst and process design. This should not be affected by scale. Application of the concepts derived from our optimized MEC design and process parameters, along with suitable lower cost materials, to study scale-up is needed to move towards a successful demonstration of commercially feasible MEC technology. Given the ability of the anode consortia to utilize complex substrates and generate the hydrogen productivities reported here, the chances of successful demonstration of this novel bioenergy technology at larger scales appear to be on the horizon."
16,Conclusions,"Microbial electrolysis cells are a novel technology that can convert a wide variety of biomass substrates into renewable hydrogen. This study confirms that corn stover derived substrates can be used to generate high productivities in these reactors at high organic loading rates. Conversion of residual organics found in fermentation effluents can be converted at high percentages and rates at high organic loading rates. Additionally, pulsed anode liquid flow regimes can contribute to increased hydrogen productivities and electrical efficiencies. The findings conducted in this study further support the viability of complex feedstocks used in microbial electrolysis cells for biomass derived hydrogen production, reaching normalized commercial targets for the first time, in microbial electrolysis cells operated at a laboratory scale. However, future biorefineries and commercial reactors will require additional considerations, including proportional scale up, lowering electrical energy applied to electrodes through optimized anode liquid media pumping schedules, and further understanding of the effects of flow on larger systems."
