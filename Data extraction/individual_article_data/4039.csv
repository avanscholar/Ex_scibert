0,Introduction,"With the crisis of fossil resources and environmental issues worldwide, sustainable & green technologies have becoming a hot spot in research community [1]. Acetone hydrogenation, a typical hydrogenation reaction of carbonyl groups, which is widespread attention due to its significant advantages of atom-economic, cheap, and environmental-friendly [2,3]. More importantly, among the products of acetone hydrogenation, isopropanol is not only a critical and valuable intermediate in the fine chemical industry but is also in high demand for DIPA (direct isopropyl alcohol) fuel cells because of its higher energy density, much lower crossover current, easier to oxidize, more production of hydrogen, and less toxic than other alcohols such as methanol and ethanol [4–6]. Acetone hydrogenation is believed playing an important role in renewable energy technology. A large number of experimental and theoretical studies have been performed on acetone hydrogenation reaction to achieve more efficiency acetone conversion and higher selectivity on isopropanol in most recent years [7–11]. It is well known that Ni nanocrystals have wide applications on hydrogenation reactions of unsaturated compounds because of their excellent hydrogenation performance and high economic efficiency [12–16]. Several studies had revealed that Ni nanocrystals with different morphologies, size and surface structures have more advantages in its applications than general morphologies [17–23]. The selectivity of furfural hydrogenation (CO hydrogenation) can be adjusted by controlling the exposed surface of the Ni catalysts [18]. Vogt et al. [19] found that particle size of Ni clusters not only affected the reaction pathway, but also affected the reactivity of carbonyl compound hydrogenation. Interaction of catalyst’s surface atoms and reactant atoms usually play significant roles during the catalysis reaction and the surface imperfections/edges/corners of nanocrystals can significantly benefit the interaction of target atoms and subsequently reduce the activation energy of certain reactions [24–29]. In order to enhance such interaction, some small reactant molecules were added during preparation of catalysts, such as H2, CO, and CO2 etc. consequently, these small molecules result in inducing specific morphologies of nanocrystals with high activity [30–37]. In our previous work [32], a branched Ni (Ni-BN) is in-situ synthesized with H2 by hydrothermal method that exposes high-index facet in the branched pods. Compared with the basal planes, high-index facets with atomic steps and kinks show significantly enhanced catalytic activity [38–41]. For example, Pt-Fe nanowires with an abundant facets of {460}, {280}, {260} and {420} exhibited high selectivity for CO groups during the hydrogenation of acetophenone [42]. Au nanoparticles [43] with {730}, {520} and {221} facets and Au-Ag core-shell nanoparticles [44] enclosed by various facets of {210}, {310}, {410}, {510} and {610} had higher catalytic reaction rates than that of low-index {111} and {100} facets in hydrogenation of 4-nitrothiophenol. Facet of {730} engineered PtCu concave nanocubes greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity and selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation reaction compared with {100} facet enclosed PtCu nanocubes [45]. However, these aforementioned examples only qualitatively recognized that the high-index facets are more active that can improve catalytic performance, but a concisely quantitative correlation between shape-effect and catalytic performance is still undone. Herein, we report the branched Ni (Ni-BN) in-situ synthesized with 14 bar of H2 that with highly exposed active phase as high efficient catalyst for acetone hydrogenation. Therefore, revealing the mechanism of well acetone hydrogenation performance and establishing corresponding correlation of catalytic performance with the active facets on the Ni-BN will become an important breakthrough on rational design, adjusting, and optimizing of highly effective nanocrystal catalysts. The growth mechanism of Ni-BN with H2 had been revealed and kinetics model of this process was also well established in our previous work [32]. It found that with the influence of H2 atoms Ni-BN grew vertically along 〈111〉 direction and resulted in eight highly symmetrical pods, as seen in Scheme. 1 . The Ni-BN nanoparticle exposed abundant of H2 self-selective new facets. Ni-nanoparticle (Ni-NP) prepared without H2 inducing were also prepared as a reference. Deep mechanistic insights of CO hydrogenation on different Ni facets were discussed based on the first principle calculation to explore the reason of well performance on high-index facet. Based on the constructed Ni-BN nanocrystal growth model and developed microkinetic model of present work, we further quantitatively unravel the shape-function relationship of Ni-BN for acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol. This work sheds light into the catalytic reaction on the nanoparticles with different morphologies and provides a method accessing the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction."
1,Experimental and computational methods,
2,Experimental methods,"2.1 Experimental methods 2.1.1 Catalysts preparation Branched Ni (Ni-BN) was synthesized as same procedure as our previous work [31]. Typically, 1 mmol of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O was dissolved into 20 mL of ethanol (solution A) and 4 mL of Oleylamine (OAm) was dissolved into 10 mL of ethanol (solution B), respectively. After stirring for 1 h, the solution A with light green color and colorless solution B were mixed and stirred for 1 h. Then the mixed solution with dark green color was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel high-pressure reactor, and heated at 423 K for 3 h with a stirring speed of 400 rpm and H2 pressure of 14 bar. After the reaction, the product was centrifuged, subsequently washed with ethanol and cyclohexane. The Ni-BN was obtained after the products dried in a vacuum oven at 333 K for 12 h, thus, Ni nanoparticle (Ni-NP) is synthesized by the same method except for the addition of H2. 2.1.2 Catalysts characterization The nanocrystal structures of the prepared samples are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker AXS: D8FOCUS; Madison, WI) with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images as well as high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images are obtained based on a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. All these measurements are performed at room temperature. Moreover, the specific surface areas are analyzed using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with an automatic Quantachrome instrument at 77.35 K. 2.1.3 Activity measurements The catalytic performances of the catalysts are evaluated using acetone hydrogenation with a stainless steel high-pressure reactor. 30 mg of catalyst, 0.02 mol of acetone and 10 mL of cyclohexane (as a solvent) are put into the reactor, and purge air out with H2, then adjust the H2 pressure to 2 MPa. The reactions are carried out at multiple temperatures for 4 h with stirred at 400 rpm. After the reaction, the liquid is collected for subsequent analysis. Quantitative analyses of acetone and isopropanol are performed on gas chromatography spectrum (Shimadzu GC 2014) equipped with a SH-Stabilwax capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The column temperature is kept at 90 °C and the detector temperature is 280 °C. N2 is used as carrier gas, the split ratio is 99, and gas flow rate is 15 cm/min. The conversion of acetone (XACE ), the selectivity of isopropanol (SIPA ) are calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) X ACE = 1 - n ACE / n ACE 0 × 100 % (2) S IPA = n IPA / n P × 100 % n ACE 0 and nACE represent moles of acetone before and after reaction, n IPA and n P represent moles of isopropanol and all products, respectively."
3,Computational methods,"2.2 Computational methods Adsorption energies, desorption energies and activation barriers are calculated using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) based on the spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [46–48]. Exchange and correlation effects are described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [49] and the core and valence electrons are treated by projector augmented wave (PAW) method combined with a cutoff energy of 400 eV [50]. The optimization of the bulk and surface slab structure reaches an equilibrium state when the difference of the electron energy in two subsequent optimization steps is less than 10-5 eV and the force on each atom is smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. The obtained results are further corrected by zero point energy (ZPE). The transition state (TS) is calculated by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method with the force tolerance of 0.05 eV/Å [51,52]. The p(3 × 3) supercells with four atomic layers are utilized for Ni(111), Ni(110), and Ni(100) facets and the top two layers are relaxed, while p(1 × 3) supercells with twelve atomic layers are construed for Ni(322) facet and the top six layers are relaxed. A 15 Å vacuum layer along the z direction perpendicular to the facet is used to avoid unphysical interactions. The k-points of (3 × 3 × 1) using the Monkhorst-Pack method are performed to achieve a good convergence [53]. The forward/reverse pre-exponential factors (νfor and νrev ) for elementary steps R3-R6 on all facets are defined by the ratio of vibrational frequencies at initial/final state ( V i IS and V i FS ) and transition state ( V i TS ) [54] which are shown in Eqs. (3) and (4). (3) ν for = ∏ i = 1 3 N ν i IS / ∏ j = 1 3 N - 1 ν j TS (4) ν rev = ∏ i = 1 3 N ν i FS / ∏ j = 1 3 N - 1 ν j TS The rate constant (kn ) of elementary steps R3-R6 is calculated using Arrhenius equation (5) k n = ν exp - E a / k B T wherein ν (s−1) is the pre-exponential factor for the forward or reverse reaction step, Ea (J) is the activation energy barrier of the elementary reaction step and kB (1.38 × 10-23 J/K) is Boltzmann constant. The adsorption rates of H2 and acetone can be written as Eq. (6) [55]: (6) k ads i = s 0 P i A i / 2 π m i k B T wherein s 0 is the sticking coefficient of species i; Pi (Pa) and mi (kg) are the partial pressure and molecular mass and Ai (m2) is the area of adsorption site. The coefficients s 0 for H2 and acetone were estimated to be 0.02 and 1 × 10-5, respectively [55]. The desorption rates of H2, acetone and isopropanol are calculated based on the harmonic transition state theory (HTST) shown in Eq. (8) [56,57]: (7) k des = k B T h e n 1 P Θ RT 1 - n exp Δ r S m Θ P Θ R exp - E a RT Eq. (7) can be derived as Arrhenius equation and the pre-exponential factor A is written as: (8) A = k B T h e n 1 P Θ RT 1 - n exp Δ r S m Θ P Θ R wherein n is the coefficient amount of the reactants and n 1 represents the coefficient amount of the gaseous reactants. For the condensed phase reaction, the value of n 1 is 1. h represents Plank constant and R is gas constant. The entropy Δ r S m Θ ( P Θ ) in Eq. (9) which contains three contributions, translational, rotational, and vibrational distributions, is obtained from the frequency calculations with DFT at 1 atm and 298.15 K. (9) Δ r S m Θ P Θ = S TS Θ P Θ - S RS Θ P Θ Detailed microkinetic modeling analyses are given in Supporting Information (SI)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance The catalytic performances of Ni catalysts synthesized without H2 (Ni-NP) and 14 bar H2 (Ni-BN) for acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol are depicted in Fig. 1 . It is obvious that the conversion of acetone of Ni-BN exhibits ~25% higher that of Ni-NP at the investigated temperature range (353–433 K). It is very interesting that isopropanol is the only product during acetone hydrogenation process on both of Ni-NP and Ni-BN, as seen in Fig. S1. This result confirmed Ni nanocrystal is a well candidate for this reaction. The highest acetone conversion to isopropanol on Ni-BN is 93% obtained at 413 K, which is very excellent at both of conversion and selectivity relative to most supported and unsupported catalysts reported (Fig. S2). This activity test clearly indicates that Ni-BN catalyst performs much better than Ni-NP due to the former’s distinctive preparation. The H2 plays significant role during synthesis process that exposes higher active facet than the one without H2 inducing. The new exposed facets and acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol on that will be further discussed in following section."
6,Catalysts characterization results,"3.2 Catalysts characterization results 3.2.1 Phase and shape characterizations of catalysts The crystal phases of the synthesized Ni-BN and Ni-NP samples characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) are shown in Fig. S3. These patterns indicate that both Ni-NP and Ni-BN have a standard face-centered cubic (FCC) crystalline structure. The TEM images of Ni-NP and Ni-BN are shown in Fig. 2 a and b, respectively. The distinctive shape, eight highly symmetrical pods, of Ni-BN compared to Ni-NP implies that H2 affects remarkably on the morphology of the Ni particles in the synthesis process. In contrast, a polyhedral shape of Ni-NP is obtained in the absence of H2. Moreover, merely the (111) crystal fringes of 2.03 Å can be observed, as figured out in the Fig. 2d of HRTEM image, which indicates that the majority exposed surface of Ni-NP is Ni(111) facet. For the sample Ni-BN, Fig. 2e shows the HRTEM image on top of one branch of Ni-BN and it reveals that these branches of Ni-BN grow along 〈111〉 direction. These results are in consistence with our recent work [31]. Due to the H2 inducing, Ni-BN forms eight branches; consequently, new facet exposes on these branches, which is quasi H2 self-selective facet. The specific surface areas of Ni-BN and Ni-NP are 10.2 and 19.0 m2/g, respectively. Ni-BN with lower specific surface area but shows higher activity of acetone hydrogenation, which clearly indicates that the specific surface area has much less effect on the hydrogenation performance than that from Ni facets. Thus, this new facet is believed taking responsibility for the high activity for acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol; however, the HRTEM image could not help to identify the exposed new facet, because of the blurred edge. 3.2.2 New facets exposed in Ni-BN Fortunately, in aforementioned our study on the growth mechanism of Ni-BN with H2, in which kinetics model of this process was established and verified. Based on this kinetics model, the crystal simulation of Ni-BN can be conducted and Fig. 2c shows the model diagram of Ni-BN. This model details in Section S2 of SI file. The diagram clearly shows that angles of two neighboring pods and the top of the branch are 28.7° and 119°, respectively, which are consistent with the corresponding angles in the real crystal of Ni-BN (28.2° and 120–120.6°, respectively) as shown in Fig. 2b. In addition, the ratio of branch length/nuclei diameter in the model diagram is 4.2, which is in good agreement with that of the real one. Naturally, cartesian coordinates of this accurate crystal model could not only provide the Miller index of the newly exposed facet but also give out the area ratios of exposed facets on Ni-BN crystal. More importantly, in order to testify this method, we calculate the Miller index of the exposed surface of some literatures [58–63] according to the coordinates that obtain by our model. The specific calculation process is listed in Section S3 of SI file. It is excited to find that our calculated values are consistent with the characterization/calculation results in the literatures. These results confirm that this method is feasible and reliable (SI, Fig. S4 and Table S1). Additionally, area ratios of exposed surfaces of nanocrystals can be obtained by this method, which might approach a quantitative study on the contributions of exposed facets with different Miller index (hkl) to the catalytic performance of nanocrystals. In present work, according to the coordinates of the calculation model in Fig. 2c, the whole exposed surface of Ni-BN is consist of Ni(111), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets, and the area proportions of the exposed Ni(111), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets of Ni-BN are 0.7%, 0.6% and 98.7%, respectively (Fig. 3 ). This result answers the question that what is the facet newly formed in Ni-BN during the synthesis with H2 inducing. As illustrated in Fig. 2f, this newly formed {322} facet is a kind of imperfection plane that has a step with every five atoms. At the same time, Ni-NP is also calculated via same way and the crystal model is depicted in Fig. S5. Thereby, Ni-NP is composed of Ni(111), Ni(110), and Ni(100) as ratios of 60.3%, 3%, and 36.7%, respectively."
7,Acetone hydrogenation on facets,"3.3 Acetone hydrogenation on facets As previous stated, the Ni-BN exposes {322} facet taking ~99% of total surface area. It is very worth to research the process of acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol on Ni(322) and further to compare with it over the Ni(111), Ni(110), and Ni(100) facets. Based on the first principle calculation, CO hydrogenation is researched via computational method. The surface structure models of Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100), and Ni(322) are built for DFT calculation as shown in Fig. S6. Acetone hydrogenation reaction over Ni facets begins with the acetone and atomic hydrogen adsorption [64]. Unlike the other facets, atoms on Ni(322) are not equivalent position, in other words, it is priority to consider the acetone adsorption site on Ni(322), thereby, the adsorption energies of acetone on different sites of Ni(322) are shown in Fig. 4 . The result indicates that the step site performs the strongest bond with acetone molecular than any other sites, moreover, the adsorption energies of acetone at other positions are as similar as that on the Ni(111). In summary, the step site of high-index {322} facet seems the most favorable site for hydrogenation of acetone among Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) with adsorption energies of acetone −0.27 eV, −0.6 eV, −0.43 eV, and −0.81 eV, respectively. After adsorption of acetone and atomic hydrogen on Ni facets, there are two hydrogenation reaction routes to obtain the product isopropanol revealed by previous studies [65,66], which are the Alkoxy route (AR) and the Hydroxy route (HR). In present work, both of two routes are calculated on these investigated facets (as shown in Fig. 5 ). For convenient understanding, the two atomic hydrogen adsorbed on Ni facets are named as H1 and H2, the carbon atom and oxygen atom of the carbonyl group on reactant acetone/intermediates/product isopropanol are denoted as C and O, which are shown in Fig. 6 . And the lengths of CH1 and OH2 bonds during the AR and the HR on Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets are listed in Table S2. As for the AR, an atomic hydrogen H1 first moves toward the carbonyl carbon to generate an alkoxy intermediate (IMA) with a new formed CH1 bond. In the second step, after breaking the other NiH2 bond and forming OH2 bond, the oxygen is hydrogenated resulting to isopropanol. On the contrary, as for the HR, an atomic hydrogen H2 first adds to the carbonyl oxygen to form a hydroxyalkyl intermediate (IMH). Then the other hydrogen atom H1 moves to the carbonyl carbon resulting in the product isopropanol. The reaction energy barriers of the Alkoxy route and the Hydroxy route on Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets are displayed in Table 1 . In general, during either AR or HR, acetone hydrogenation reaction contains two energy barriers to produce isopropanol: TS1 and TS2. However, the energy barrier of the AR is lower than that of the HR on whole investigated facets according calculation results in the table, which means the AR is favored. For the AR, the energy barriers of TS1A on Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets are respectively 1.14, 0.7, 0.4 and 0.37 eV and the energy barriers of TS2A from IMA to isopropanol are respectively 0.6, 0.44, 1.02 and 0.73 eV. Meanwhile, the rate-determining step (RDS) of AR is the hydrogenation of carbonyl carbon (TS1A) over Ni(111) and Ni(110), while the RDS of Ni(100) and Ni(322) is the hydrogenation of oxygen (TS2A). Comparing the results of RDS, it is concluded that the energy barrier follows the order of Ni(111) > Ni(100) > Ni(322) > Ni(110) for the reaction of the AR. Despite of that the HR needs to overcoming higher energy barriers than that of AR, the energy barrier still follows same order of Ni(111) > Ni(100) > Ni(322) > Ni(110) as AR. The result indicates that Ni(110) facet is the best facet for acetone hydrogenation among these facets. However, acetone hydrogenation occurs on Ni(322) facet as AR only taking 0.03 eV extra energy than that on Ni(110), which means activity order Ni(111) > Ni(100) > Ni(322) ≈ Ni(110). More importantly, Ni(322) facet dominates ~99% surface area of the Ni-BN in respect of that Ni(110) facet only takes 3% on the surface of the Ni-NP. This remarkable huge gap between Ni-BN and Ni-NP could explain the much better performance on Ni-BN for acetone hydrogenation than that of Ni-NP."
8,Microkinetic modeling establishing,"3.4 Microkinetic modeling establishing In order to quantitative correlate the exposed facets with catalytic performance for acetone hydrogenation, microkinetic modeling has been performed to calculate the reaction rate of each elementary reaction. As listed in Table 2 , all elementary steps of acetone hydrogenation reaction with the AR including of the HR are provided. The * represents the available active site for dissociative hydrogen and acetone adsorption. The AR containing intermediate (CH3)2CHO* is divided into the step R3 and step R4; the HR containing intermediate (CH3)2COH* is represented by the step R5 and step R6. The DFT calculated activation barriers of the forward and reverse reaction (Ea and Ea -1), the pre-exponential factors of forward (νfor) and the reverse (νrev) for all elementary steps are listed in Table S4. Moreover, the forward and reverse rates for all elementary steps on Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets are displayed in Table S5. The partial pressures of acetone and hydrogen are 0.8 and 2 MPa, respectively, which are the exact pressure conditions that applied in experiments. The coverage of unoccupied active sites (θ*) and the atomic hydrogen (θH*) are introduced to help well describing the reaction process. The variations of θ* and θH with the increasing temperature over Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets are displayed in Fig. 7 a, c, e and g. The θ* of all facets increases while the θH* decreases with increasing temperature from 353 to 413 K, which means the reactivity of acetone hydrogenation increases with temperature increasing. At 413 K, the θ* on Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) are 0.04, 0.4, 0.01 and 0.04 ML (molecular layer), while the θH* on Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) are 0.96, 0.6, 0.99 and 0.96 ML respectively. Apparently, Ni(110) facet with the lowest value of θH* is most conductive to acetone hydrogenation reaction among these facets. Except the microcosmic rates, the macroscopic reaction rates also reflect the variations in the coverages of the reaction intermediates and active sites as a function of temperature. Since reaction rates of step R3 (IMA) and step R5 (IMH) respectively reflect the reaction rates of the AR and the HR, herein we build the relationship between reaction rates of step R3 & R5 and temperature over the four facets as shown in Fig. 7b, d, f and i. It is noteworthy that the formation rate of IMA is much faster than that of the IMH (2–4 orders of magnitude higher) over all facets at invetigated temperature range, which solidly confirms that the AR is the major reaction route in acetone hydrogenation reaction over Ni nanoparticle. For Ni(111), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets, the IMA formation rate and IMH formation rate increase with the increasing temperature. This regular pattern is consistent with the increasing conversion of Ni-NP and Ni-BN with the increasing temperature. However, the Ni(110) facet performs differently: the IMH formation rate increases with the increasing temperature while the IMA formation rate increases at the temperature range of 353–383 K, then decreases when the temperature is above 383 K. Because the forward reaction rate of IMA formation increases faster than the reverse reaction rate at 353–383 K, while the reverse reaction rate increases faster than that of forward reaction when T > 383 K. It is worth noting that the proportion of Ni(110) facet in Ni-NP is quite low that with marginal contribution on the catalytic performance. At the temperature of 413 K, the formation rates of IMA over Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100), and Ni(322) facets are 8.3 × 10-13, 1.8 × 10-4, 1.6 × 10-10, and 4.1 × 10-7, respectively. Therefore the IMA formation rate follows the order of Ni(110) > Ni(322) > Ni(100) > Ni(111). This result also means that the Ni(110) is the optimal facet for acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol, which is consistent with the order of activation barrier of Ni(110) < Ni(322) < Ni(100) < Ni(111). This reveals that the stepped facets are more active than the flat facets. However, in present work, Ni(110) is almost negligible on both of Ni-BN and Ni-NP samples for its highest Gibbs surface free energy (see Table S3). As the result of Ni(322) almost completely covering over Ni-BN, Ni-BN is more favorable than Ni-NP for acetone hydrogenation reaction. From this perspective, the introducing of H2 during synthesis process of Ni-BN can self-select to reduce the Ni(111) facet, the most unfavorable facet and consequently generate high active new high-index Ni(322) facet for acetone hydrogenation. Finally, based on results of above calculation, a quantitative microkinetic model that considering competition of AR with HR and contributions from various facets is completed. The explicit modeling process is described in the Section S4.4 of SI. The relation rate of the RDS is calculated using the following equation: (10) R = k 3 K 2 P ( C H 3 ) 2 C O 0 ( 1 - x ) / K 1 P H 2 0 = - P ( C H 3 ) 2 C O 0 d ( 1 - x ) / d t (11) ln ( 1 - x ) = - k 3 K 2 t / K 1 P H 2 0 = - k t where K 1 and K 2 are the equilibrium constant of elementary step R1 and R2; k 3 represents the rate constant of elementary step R3; PH 2 0 is the initial pressure of hydrogen; k is the integrated rate constant which is equal to k 3 k 2 / K 1 P H 2 0 ; x is the experimental conversion. The microkinetic model directly derived by DFT is usually difficult to make a quantitative agreement with real experimental data because of the kinetic parameters calculated by DFT calculations are intrinsic kinetics that not consider of reaction macroscope conditions [67]. Thus, a semi-empirical correction factor (λ) is employed to modify the DFT microkinetic models: (12) ln ( 1 - x ) = - λ k 3 K 2 t / K 1 P H 2 0 = - λ k t The integrated rate constants k of Ni-NP and Ni-BN are obtained by quantitatively assigning the calculated k of Ni(111), Ni(110), Ni(100) and Ni(322) facets based on the area ratios of exposed surfaces. The calculated k of researched facets and Ni catalysts are displayed in Table S6. It is noted that the k of Ni-BN is ~4 orders of magnitude higher than that of Ni-NP, which is consistent with the better catalytic performance of Ni-BN. By substituting the experimental data of Ni-NP at 353 K and that of Ni-BN at 363 K (solid points in Fig. 8 ) into Eq. (12), the semi-empirical correction factors (λ) of Ni-BN and Ni-NP can be obtained as 220 and 6.2 × 105, respectively. In order to verify the correctness of this microkinetic models, the comparisons between the fitted values and experimental values (hollow points) are conducted and the results are depicted in Fig. 8. The Fig. 8 shows the simulation results of the semi-empirical microkinetic models for the reaction of acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol on Ni-BN and Ni-NP nanocrystals. It shows that the models agree well with the experimental results at the temperature range of 353–413 K, which confirms the correctness of our microkinetic analysis based on DFT. Ni catalysts with different shape expose different area ratios of facets. The semi-empirical microkinetic models are established by allocating the exposed facets of Ni catalysts and helps to quantitatively analyze the contribution of each facet in shape-function relationships."
9,Conclusions,"In the present work, shape-function relationship of a branched Ni catalyst that performs elegant activity on acetone hydrogenation to isopropanol is studied by experimental and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that activity of acetone hydrogenation increases significantly with the crystallographic planes changed from low-index {111} and {100} facets to high-index {322}. The Ni-BN prepared with 14 bar H2 contains ~99% Ni(322) facet on the exposed surface, which shows higher acetone yield and lower reaction energy barrier than Ni(111) and Ni(100) facets that Ni-NP mainly exposes. This study indicates that Ni(322) facet with abundant step sites that have been proved as active sites and are responsible for the high reactivity for acetone hydrogenation. The microkinetic models on Ni nanocrystals show that reaction rate of Ni-BN is several orders of magnitude higher than that of Ni-NP. This work also demonstrates that H2 acts as a morphology-directing agent to self-select to reduce the exposed area of the unfavorable Ni(111) facet and helps forming favorable high-index Ni(322) facet for acetone hydrogenation. Consequently, the obtained Ni-BN with a unique arrangement of crystal facets exhibits excellent hydrogenation catalytic performance. This work not only provides detailed understanding of the shape-function relationships of Ni catalysts in acetone hydrogenation, but also provides guidance for selectively synthesizing catalysts with more favored facets by small reactant molecules self-select method. It can expect that this method can be widely applied in other catalytic systems."
