0,Introduction,"With the increasing shortage of fossil energy and the gradual deterioration of the ecological environment, people pay more attention to renewable clean energy. However, renewable energy often has obvious discontinuities and instabilities. As an energy storage device, supercapacitors have attracted widespread attention due to their high specific power, fast charge and discharge, and long cycle life [1–7]. Among supercapacitor electrode materials, MnO2 has been widely studied due to its low price, abundant reserves, high theoretical specific capacity (1370 F g − 1), and non-toxicity [8–12]. However, the electrochemical performance of pure manganese dioxide is still constrained by poor electronic conductivity and easy dissolution [13, 14]. In order to overcome the above problems, researchers have conducted a number of researches. For example, Zhai et al. prepared oxygen-deficient MnO2 by a simple hydrogenation treatment, the specific capacitance can reach 449 F g − 1 [15]. Wang et al. prepared high-porosity MnO2/PPy by chemical vapor deposition, the material shows the highest capacitance of 320 F g − 1 [16]. In addition, Zhao et al. reported a novel three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide aerogel and MnO2 (RGO/MnO2) via a mild method and freeze-drying treatment, the specific capacitance of RGO/MnO2 can reach 288 F g − 1 at 0.5 A g − 1 [17]. Although these studies have effectively improved the electrochemical performance of manganese dioxide, most of the processes are complicated and costly. There are many methods to synthesize MnO2 at present, such as hydrothermal method [18], sol-gel method [19], electrodeposition method [20], etc. Among these synthesis methods, the electrodeposition method has the advantages of being simple and easy to control, being green, and requiring no additional binder [21]. The method and parameter settings of electrodeposition and the choice of substrate have an important influence on the morphology and structure of the material. Electrodeposited substrates usually require good conductivity and a porous structure to support more active materials. However, before electrodeposition, the substrate needs to be repeatedly cleaned in multiple procedures to remove oxides and impurities that may be present on the surface [22–24]. In addition, there are many problems, for example, easy accumulation of active materials. In previous publications [25, 26], we have reported at the first time, that alcohol pretreatment can improve the electrochemical performance of MnO2 electrodeposited with various electrodeposition voltages or various precursor concentrations. In this work, we further explain how the alcohol works and propose the potential mechanism of the electro-oxidation of alcohol. MnO2 electrodes with and without alcohol infiltrated substrate process were prepared by potentiostatic (PS) deposition, we found that MnO2 electrodes with alcohol treatment have obvious advantages over traditional electrodeposition [25]. Subsequently, we continued electrodeposition to reduce graphene oxide (RGO) on the basis of the improved MnO2 electrode. We also found that alcohol has a similar effect on electro-reduced graphene, and the MnO2/RGO electrode improved by alcohol has better electrochemical performance. Electro-oxidation of alcohol shows a promoting effect on electrodeposition of MnO2, we guess that based on the universality, the new process-alcohol infiltrated substrate may be useful for the performance improvement of most MnO2-related supercapacitor materials, and not limited to the MnO2 and MnO2/RGO."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of MnO2 and MnO2/RGO electrodes,"2.1 Preparation of MnO2 and MnO2/RGO electrodes As shown in Fig. 1 , Ni foams (110 PPI, 350 g m − 2, 1.0 mm thick) with a section of 1 × 3.5 cm2 were employed as the substrate for electrodeposition. Firstly, put the foamed nickel in alcohol and washed it with ultrasonic vibration for 5 min to ensure that the substrate was fully wetted. Took out the Ni foams and waited for the alcohol to evaporate; selected one piece of foamed nickel to deposit directly (M1) and take another piece of foamed nickel to fully soak the alcohol before depositing (M2, 1 min, room temperature). A conventional electrodeposition system was used where a three-electrode cell with Ni foam acted as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and platinum as the counter electrode in 0.01 M mixed aqueous solution of Mn(CH3COO)2 and Na2SO4. The electrodeposition process was conducted by potentiostatic with a potential of 0.6 V for 120 s. On the basis of M2, we continued to electroreduced graphene oxide (−1.4 V, 100 s), using graphite oxide dispersion with a precursor concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. The direct electrodeposition sample is M3, and the sample deposited after soaking in alcohol is M4. Subsequently, all samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried in a drying cabinet."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The surface morphology and microstructures of MnO2 and MnO2/RGO electrode materials were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss ULTRA 55 SEM, 20 KV) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, 200 kV). The active material on the nickel foam substrate is scraped off first, then ultrasonically oscillated in alcohol, and finally dried for TEM test. The composition of the MnO2/RGO films was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Thermo Fisher K-Alpha 250xi). And the loading mass of all the sample were calculated by weighing on a high precision electronic balance (Toledo, XS205DU, d = 0.01 mg,). The loading mass of M1 (MnO2, direct electrodeposition), M2 (MnO2, after soaking in alcohol) a M3 (MnO2/RGO, direct electrodeposition) and M4 (MnO2/RGO, after soaking in alcohol) were measured as 0.65, 0.85, 0.92 and 1.1 mg cm−2, respectively."
4,Characterization of electrochemical performance,"2.3 Characterization of electrochemical performance The electrochemical performance (GCD, CV, CA and EIS) of the MnO2 and MnO2/RGO electrodes were measured at room temperature in electrolyte of 1.0 M Na2SO4 by CS350 (Wuhan CorrTest Instrument Co. Ltd) electrochemical workstation with MnO2 and MnO2/RGO as the working electrode, platinum plate as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The mass ratio specific capacitance, area ratio specific capacitance, the specific energy and specific power were calculated according to the following equations [27, 28]: (1) C = I Δ t m V (2) C s = ∫ I d V / ( s × Δ v × V ) (3) E = 1 2 × C ( V ) 2 3.6 (4) P = E Δ t × 3600 Where C (F g − 1) is the mass ratio specific capacitance of the electrodes, I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, m is the loading mass, and V is the potential window. Cs refers to area specific capacitance, s represents the area of the electrodes, P and E indicate power density and energy density, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Mechanism of alcohol action: ethanol oxidation,"3.1 Mechanism of alcohol action: ethanol oxidation Ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is the most important anodic oxidation reaction in direct alcohol fuel cells (DEFCs) [29, 30]. Pt is highly efficient anode catalyst for ethanol oxidation, however, due to its high cost and scarce reserves, it is limited in practical applications. It is currently believed that transition metals such as Ni, Fe and metal oxides (CeO2, RuO2, V2O5, TiO2, and MnO2, etc.) and RGO in carbonaceous supports all have good catalytic activity for EOR [31–36]. The electrochemical oxidation reaction of ethanol in acidic medium is as follows: (5) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 O 2 = 2 C O 2 + 3 H 2 O (6) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O − 12 e − = 2 C O 2 + 12 H + (7) 3 O 2 + 12 H + + 12 e − = 6 H 2 O The reaction process of preparing manganese dioxide anode by electrodeposition is as follow: (8) M n 2 + + 4 O H − = Mn O 2 + 2 H 2 O + 2 e − The overall reduction reaction of RGO is as follow: GO + e − + H + → RGO As shown in Fig. 2 , on the anode, the deposition of manganese dioxide and the electrooxidation of ethanol proceed simultaneously. Ni substrate and generated manganese dioxide will further promote the electrooxidation of ethanol. Electro-oxidation of ethanol usually cannot be carried out completely, and the product has acetate when it is not completely oxidized. Acetate can promote the production of manganese dioxide (hydrogen ions from acetic acid promote manganese dioxide deposition reaction to the right, as shown in Eq. (8)) and the generated CO2 will make the manganese dioxide loose and porous, which is beneficial to the transfer of electrons and ions [37]. In addition, the electro-oxidation reaction of ethanol will guide the deposition of manganese dioxide on the Ni substrate, so that the manganese dioxide grows more uniform on the Ni substrate. The principle of electro-reduced graphene is similar. Alcohol has a certain reducing property, and it has a certain promotion effect on the electroreduction of graphene oxide."
7,SEM and TEM analysis of prepared electrode,"3.2 SEM and TEM analysis of prepared electrode Surface morphology and microstructure of materials are important factors affecting electrochemical performance. Therefore, changing the microstructure of materials is an important means to improve the properties of materials. As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), the film thickness of the samples without alcohol varies greatly, but the thickness of the samples after alcohol infiltration at different locations is relatively uniform. This result shows that the introduction of alcohol can make the film growth more uniform. The samples without alcohol treatment show a dense thin film structure (Fig. 3(c)), and the closely packed nanostructures could not fully react, inhibiting electrochemical performance. Fig. 3(d) illustrates that the introduction of alcohol can make the films loose and porous, and this three-dimensional porous structure facilitates the transport of electrons and ions, which is consistent with the characteristics of electrode materials for supercapacitors. The mechanism of electroreduction of graphene oxide is similar to the previous one; alcohol has certain reducing properties, which promotes the reduction of graphene oxide under the action of voltage. As shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (c), the addition of alcohol significantly increased the loading mass of graphene. Fig. 4(b) and (d) show the SEM images of M3 and M4 electrode surfaces. The RGO of the M4 electrode was deposited very uniformly on the surface of manganese dioxide, while the surface of the M3 electrode was uneven; this result is consistent with the previous analysis. RGO uniformly covering the surface of MnO2 can not only improve the conductivity of the electrode and facilitate the transmission of electrons and ions, but also contribute part of the capacitance. The TEM samples were prepared by scraping the MnO2/RGO films out of the Ni foam and dispersing them into alcohol by ultrasonic, then dropping them on copper grids and drying them at room temperature. Fig. 4(e) shows the TEM image of M4 and manganese dioxide is connected to each other in a nanodendritic manner to form a thin film structure. This three-dimensional non-dense structure has a large specific surface area, which is conducive to the output of ions in the electrolyte and the electrode kinetic reaction of MnO2 [37]. Apparently, the introduction of alcohol treatment can significantly make the films more stable, thus RGO adheres well to the surface of manganese dioxide, which can effectively prevent the dissolution of manganese dioxide during charge and discharge, and improve the overall stability of the electrode. The obvious lattice fringes in HRTEM image (Fig. 4(f)) indicate that the MnO2 is good crystallization, and the d-spacings of 0.227 and 0.263 nm correspond to the distances of the (002) and (301) planes of MnO2, respectively. RGO has distinctly different lattice fringes (Fig. 4(g)). We processed the HRTEM images of manganese dioxide and RGO in M4 through Digital Micrograph 3.7 software, and the dislocations of MnO2 and RGO were observed through FFT calculations, the results show that both MnO2 and RGO have good crystallinity."
8,XPS analysis of prepared electrodes,"3.3 XPS analysis of prepared electrodes In order to study the oxidation state of manganese and confirm the existence of MnO2 and RGO, the M4 electrode material was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 5 (a) shows the full-peak scans and demonstrates the presence of Mn, O and C elements. The 2p orbital of Mn has two peaks in Fig. 5(b), namely Mn2p3/2 and Mn2p1/2, and the separation value is 11.8 eV, this result is in great agreement with the literature [38, 39], which proves the existence of MnO2 and suggests that the element Mn is in the +4 valence state. In Fig. 5(c), O1s spectrum fits three peaks with a Gaussian model, which located at 529.6 eV (Mn–O–Mn), 531.6 eV (C–O–Mn), and 531.8 eV (H–O–H), respectively. The presence of CO-Mn indicates that C in graphene forms a covalent bond with Mn in manganese dioxide and the presence of O–Mn–H reveals the hydrous nature [40,41]. The peak located at 284.7 eV can be assigned to CC of C1s, and the Gaussian fitting indicates that other peaks located at 286.3 and 287.8 eV were attributed to oxygen functionalized carbon atoms, such as CO, C = O, respectively [42]. This result indicates that the electro-reduced RGO also has abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, which can improve the wettability of carbon networks with electrolytes, and this is suitable for supercapacitor applications [43, 44]."
9,Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry analysis,"3.4 Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry analysis Cyclic voltammetry is an important method for analyzing the electrochemical performance of materials. Fig. 6 (a) shows the CV curves of M1, M2, M3 and M4, the pair of redox peaks superimposed on the rectangular CV suggests that partial intercalation of cations is taking place in addition to surface reaction. This probably means that we synthesized a MnO2 polymorph that can accommodate Na+ ions such as crytomelane or birnessite. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the addition of alcohol increases the area specific capacitance, which is mainly because the effective specific surface area of the active substance increases, thus the active substance can participate more fully in the reaction. In addition, due to the introduction of graphene, the conductivity is increased and the ions and electrons in the electrolyte can be quickly exchanged and transferred, thereby showing a larger area specific capacitance. The chronoamperometry technique (CA) was carried out to evaluate the stability and electrode reaction process of M1, M2, M3 and M4. Fig. 6(c) and (d) shows the CA curves of M1, M2, M3 and M4 in 40 s at the given potential of 0.8 V. The current density of all electrodes decreased rapidly in the beginning, during this period, the electrode reaction process is mainly affected by diffusion. Subsequently, the current gradually stabilized. When the time approached infinity, the current approached 0 because the concentration of active substance on the electrode surface gradually decreased due to electrolysis. It can be clearly seen that the current density of M2 and M4 decreased slower than that of M1 and M3, and the current density is higher, which indicates that M2 and M4 have a more stable electrochemical reaction."
10,Galvanostastic charge and discharge analysis,"3.5 Galvanostastic charge and discharge analysis Fig. 7 (a) illustrates the charge-discharge curves of M1 and M2 at a current density of 1 A g − 1 in the potential range of 0–1.0 V. M2 shows longer charge and discharge time than M1, indicating that M2 has a larger capacitance. Due to the synergistic effect of graphene and manganese dioxide, the charge and discharge curves of M3 and M4 are closer to the ideal triangle (Fig. 7(b)), suggesting the excellent reversibility and ideal pseudocapacitive behaviors of the MnO2/RGO electrodes. M4 also showed excellent performance over M3 electrodes, indicating that the introduction of alcohol improved electrode performance. Fig. 7(c)and (d) illustrates the specific capacitance of M1, M2, M3 and M4 at different current densities and the specific capacitance of all samples decreased with increasing current density. This is mainly due to the lack of sufficient time for the active material to react sufficiently at high current densities and the low conductivity of manganese dioxide itself [45]. The specific capacitances of M1 and M3 can be calculated to be 153, 136, 103, 103, 79 F g − 1 and 343, 304, 254, 213, 168 F g − 1 at the current density of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 A g − 1, respectively. As a comparison, M2 and M4 exhibits much higher specific capacitances of 270, 237, 190, 142,101 F g − 1 and 467, 388, 307, 243, 181 F g − 1 at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 A g − 1. The specific capacitances of M2 and M4 are always higher than M1 and M3 at various current densities owing to the loose porous structure and lager specific surface area induced by alcohol treatment. The cycling performance of electrode materials is an important indicator for evaluating electrode performance. The cycling performance of M2 and M4 was evaluated by GCD measurement in 1.0 M Na2SO4 at a current density of 5 A g − 1 for cycles up to 2500. Alcohol-treated electrodes (M2, M4) show superior cycling performance compared to directly electrodeposited electrodes [22, 46, 47]. The capacity retention rates of M2 and M4 after 2500 cycles under high current density is 83.9% and 93.1%, respectively. This is because the alcohol treatment reduces the surface tension between the electrode and the electrolyte boundary. Furthermore, Meng and Yu reported that the proper amount of alcohol can improve the adhesion strength of the precipitate [48]. M4 has better cycle performance than M2 due to MnO2 will dissolve in Na2SO4 solution, so in the early stage, the capacitance will decrease rapidly, but RGO coating can effectively prevent the dissolution of MnO2 and make the electrode more stable, which is consistent with the analysis of chronoamperometry. Specific energy and specific power are important indicators for evaluating supercapacitors. The relationship between the specific energy and the specific power are presented in Fig. 7(f). Not surprisingly, M2 and M4 show greater specific energy and specific power than M1 and M3. The maximum specific energy of the directly electrodeposited sample (M1) is only 19.64 Wh Kg−1, and the sample after adding alcohol (M2) is 36.6 Wh Kg−1 at the current density of 1 A g − 1, when the specific power is 8.1 KW Kg−1, the specific energy can also reach 15.1 Wh Kg−1. The introduction of graphene has further improved the electrode performance, but the role of alcohol cannot be ignored. Compared with M3, the specific energy of M4 has been increased from 41.27 Wh Kg−1 to 59.3 Wh Kg−1, even if the specific power is 7 KW Kg−1, the energy density of M4 can reach a height of 20.78 Wh Kg−1."
11,Electrochemical impedance analysis,"3.6 Electrochemical impedance analysis Electrochemical AC impedance is an important means to evaluate electrode reaction kinetics and impedance [49]. Fig. 8 shows the EIS test of M1, M2, M3 and M4 in a frequency range of 100,000–0.01 Hz (vs. Ag/AgCl) with 5 mV amplitude in 1.0 M Na2SO4, and the impedance data was analyzed and fitted by Zsimp Win V3.10 software. Fig. 8(a) illustrates the impedance modulus as a function of frequency. All electrodes exhibit typical capacitance characteristics, that is, low resistance in the high frequency region and large resistance in the low frequency region. As expected, M1 exhibits greater resistance characteristics than other electrodes, which also confirms the previous analysis results. Fig. 8(b) illustrates the Nyquist plots, at high frequencies, the impedance spectrum resembles a semicircle. This process is mainly controlled by charge transfer. The diameter of the semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct), and the intercept of the impedance spectrum on the real axis represents the resistance between the electrode itself and the electrolyte (Rs) [50]. At low frequencies, the impedance spectrum is a straight line with a slope close to 1, and the electrode reaction kinetics in this process is mainly controlled by diffusion corresponding to the Warburg (Zw) impedance [51]. The slope of a straight line is related to the impedance and a larger slope indicates a lower resistance value during the diffusion process. It can be seen from Fig. 8(b) that M4 and M2 have lower Rct, Zw and Rs than M1 and M3, which once again proved that the process of alcohol can effectively improve the performance of electrode materials. Based on the impedance data, the entire electrode system can be equivalent to the circuit diagram in Fig. 11(a)."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we introduced a simple alcohol-improving process using electrodeposition to prepare MnO2 and MnO2/RGO electrode materials. Results show that electro-oxidation of alcohol can effectively improve structure and the electrochemical performance of both MnO2 and MnO2/RGO electrodes. The specific capacitance of MnO2 (M2) and MnO2/RGO (M4) electrodes can be as high as 270 and 467 F g − 1 at the current density of 1 A g − 1, and keep 83.9% and 93.1% retention of the initial capacitance after 2500 cycles. M2 and M4 show good rate performance and high specific energy (101 and 181 F g − 1 at the current density of 20 A g − 1, 36.6 Wh Kg−1 and 59.3 Wh Kg−1). Moreover, both M2 and M4 exhibit low Rct and Rs according to the EIS analyses. Results suggest that alcohol treatment can effectively improve the specific capacitance, cycling performance and resistance of MnO2 and MnO2/RGO electrodes by enhancing the structural stability and significantly optimizing the structures. The introduction of alcohol treatment in electrodeposition brings promising performance optimization to high-performance supercapacitors."
