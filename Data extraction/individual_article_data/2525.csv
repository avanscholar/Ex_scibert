0,Introduction,"In recent times a great deal of attention is being paid to the usage of bioethanol as an alternative and eco-friendly fuel that can reduce the negative environmental impacts by the use of fossil fuels. Many studies have been carried out on ethanol production from lignocellulosic materials [1], such as agriculture and forest residues, the largest sources of hexose and pentose sugars in the world [2]. Nevertheless, utilization ratio of raw materials is relatively low during lignocellulose based bioethanol production [3], resulting in large amounts of distillery wastewater with high concentrations of organics. Anaerobic process is used for the removal of the organic pollutants with methane production in traditional wastewater bio-treatment methods [4]. Compared with methane, hydrogen is a more promising energy carrier because it has high energy yield (122 kJ/g) and is a clean energy with only water generation in the internal combustion engine or the fuel cell system [5]. These large amounts of organic substances (mainly carbohydrates) contained in distillery wastewater can be a potential substrate for the fermentative hydrogen production [6–9]. Hydrogen production at extreme-thermophilic condition by mixed culture is more efficient and practical for its remarkable advantages over at lower temperature conditions, including lower risk of contamination by methanogenic archaea, higher rate of hydrolysis and higher hydrogen yield due to favorable thermodynamics [5,10,11]. Furthermore, the fermentation by mixed culture has no requirements for pre-treatment of the inoculum and offers the possibility of mixed substrates co-fermentation for its high microbial diversity [12–14], especially wastes with complex components are used as substrates. In addition, considering the high temperature and complicated characteristics of the distillery wastewater, extreme-thermophilic fermentation may be more economical and efficient without additional costly pre-cooling facilities, which will be necessary if anaerobic process is carried out under lower temperatures [7,8]. The hydrogen yield is high and robustness of the process is facilitated in extreme-thermophilic fermentation with mixed culture. Many studies were carried out using various inocula and substrates [15–18]. The obtained results about the optimal fermentation conditions and the microbial community structure of the hydrogen-producing bacteria differed from one study to another, due to the complexity of the process [12]. In addition, there are few studies focusing on the extreme-thermophilic hydrogen production using distillery wastewater from lignocelluloses-based bioethanol production process as substrate [7]. Comprehensive study on extreme-thermophilic hydrogen production with new substrates under different fermentation conditions and further investigation about community structure of enriched hydrogen-producing mixed culture are essential. In this study, distillery wastewater originated from bioethanol production using corn stalk and corncob as raw materials was used as substrate for hydrogen production at extreme-thermophilic conditions for the first timeDigested cow manure was used as inocula for hydrogen-producing mixed culture enrichment under different temperature. Batch experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of temperature and pH on biohydrogen production. Continuous biohydrogen production from distillery wastewater was demonstrated in CSTR reactor at optimal temperature and pH. Furthermore, the community structures of hydrogen-producing microflora were analyzed using clone library analysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrate,"2.1 Substrate Substrate (distillery wastewater) was obtained directly from an industrial demonstration plant for bioethanol production (Tianjin, China) using corn stalk and corncob as raw materials. The properties of the distillery wastewater are shown in Table 1 ."
3,Adaptation of inoculum and operation of the reactors,"2.2 Adaptation of inoculum and operation of the reactors Extreme-thermophilic hydrogen-producing mixed culture was enriched by repeated batch cultivations [19] in 250-mL serum vials. Digested cow manure (see Table 1 ) from a local farm was used as initial inoculum for various hydrogen-producing bacteria contained in it [20]. Digested cow manure of 100 mL and raw wastewater of 50 mL were added to each vial and the total volume was adjusted to 200 mL by distilled water. The initial pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 7.0 by 2 mol/L NaOH, and the vials were sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps. Pure nitrogen gas was purged into the sealed vials with needles inserted through the stoppers for 10 min to provide anaerobic conditions. The sealed vials were placed in water bath shakers fixed at 100 rpm. The temperature of the shakers was preset at 65, 67, 70, 72, 75 and 80 °C, respectively. Repeated batch experiments at each temperature level were carried out in decuplicate. The water bath shakers were stopped till no more hydrogen was detected, the supernatants were removed and fresh distillery wastewater of 50 mL was added, distilled water was also added to the vials to maintain the total volume of 200 mL. Assays with digested cow manure alone were used as blank controls. Biogas produced from inoculum was subtracted from the sample assays. Repeated transfer was stopped when no hydrogen yield increase compared to the previous cultivation was observed. In the pH-controlled experiments, fermentors (BIOFL 110 Fermentor/Bioreactor, NBS, USA) with working volume of 1.0 L were used. 500 mL of enriched culture with the highest hydrogen yield and 500 mL of the wastewater were placed in the fermentor. After the replacement of the gas phase with nitrogen gas, the pH of the slurry was maintained at 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5 throughout the cultures, respectively, with the pH controller of the fermentor by adding 2 mol/L HCl or 2 mol/L NaOH. For continuous biohydrogen production, a 3-L fermentor (BIOFL 110 Fermentor/Bioreactor, NBS, USA) with working volume of 1.0 L were used as CSTR reactor as shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor was operated in a continuous mode by supplying 50% distillery wastewater (diluted by distilled water). HRT of the CSTR was controlled by a feeding pump. CSTR was firstly operated at 4 days’ HRT, and then the HRT was shortened to 3 days investigate whether higher hydrogen production rate could be obtained. The reactor pH was constantly controlled at 7.0 ± 0.1 with the automatic pH control unit by adding 2 mol/L NaOH or HCL. The temperature was maintained at 70 ± 0.5 °C by the temperature control unit. The evolved biogas was collected by polyethylene bags. Stirring speed of the fermentors was fixed at 100 rpm throughout this study."
4,Microbial community structure analysis of enriched inoculums,"2.3 Microbial community structure analysis of enriched inoculums To confirm hydrogen-producing bacteria species within the enriched sludge (mixed culture), a general 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was carried out in this study. Firstly, total DNA of the hydrogenic sludge was extracted with a Soil DNA Isolation kit (Soil gDNA kit, Biomiga, USA), and a clone library was constructed by PCR and the primers 27F and 1492R [21], under conditions of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s, with final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified-PCR products were purified with a TIANprep Midi Purification Kit (TIANGEN, China) and cloned into a pMD 19-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) by a TA cloning method, according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli (strain DH5α), and then colonies containing the plasmid were screened on LB-based agar plates with ampicillin, X-gal, and IPTG. Cells from randomly selected white colonies were assayed on a LB medium at 37 °C for 8 h. A commercial kit (TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit, TIANGEN, China) was used to isolate the plasmid DNA from the screened colonies. Finally, PCR products were sent to a genetic analysis service company (BGI, China) for analyzing DNA sequences. The full-length sequences of the 16S rRNA were compared with similar sequences in National Center for Biotechnology Information data using the BLAST program. All clones having a sequence similarity of more than 97% with each other were grouped into an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) consistent [22]."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis COD, total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and total nitrogen were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods [23]. Liquor pH was analyzed using PHS-2 acidometers (Leici Instrument Plant, Shanghai, China). Cellulose and hemicellulose were determined according to the standardized methods of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL, Golden, CO, USA) [24]. Sugars were quantified on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1100) equipped with a BioRad Aminex HPX-87 H at 63 °C and a refractive index (RI) detector using 0.5 ml/min of 5 mM H2SO4 as eluent. Oligomeric xylose and glucose were analyzed using methods described in previous study [3]. The liquid samples were taken from the vials and fermentors every 12 h along with the sampling of the biogas.The medium after culture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for the following soluble by-products analyses. Samples were firstly acidized by phosphoric acid, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols were quantified by a gas chromatograph (GC 9800, Shanghai Kechuang, China) using hydrogen flame ionization detector with GXD 401 (60/80 mesh) as fixed phase in stainless steel packed column at column temperature of 210 °C, injection temperature of 240 °C and detector temperature of 210 °C. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with the flow rate of 90.0 mL/min, hydrogen and air flow rate were fixed at 500 mL/min and 50 mL/min respectively. Lactate and formate were analyzed by Agilent 1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, USA) using a SB-C18 column (Agilent Technologies, USA) with UV detecter (210 nm) and 5 mmol/L H2SO4 as the mobile phase (0.5 mL/min). The evolved biogas from vials and fermentors was collected in sealed plastic bags. Its volume was measured every 12 h by syringe with calibrations [25] and was calibrated to the volume at standard temperature 0 °C and pressure 1 atmAt the same time, gas analysis was performed by a gas chromatograph (GC 9800, Shanghai Kechuang, China) using thermal conductivity detector fitted with a Porapak 60/80 mesh sieve column at column temperature of 60 °C, injection temperature of 100 °C and detector temperature of 140 °C. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with the flow rate of 45 mL/min."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Batch reactors experiments,"3.1 Batch reactors experiments 3.1.1 Effects of temperature on hydrogen production In the batch experiments for obtaining optimal temperature, hydrogen was generated in each vial after repeated batch culture. The amounts of evolved hydrogen were strongly dependent on the incubation temperature. Fig. 2 shows the hydrogen yield under different temperatures. In batch cultures, methane was only detected in batch 1 in the first few days at 65 °C and 67 °C of trace amount (data not shown), and was not detected in subsequent experiments at any temperature. It can be seen in Fig. 2a that hydrogen-producing culture can be successfully enriched at every temperature besides 80 °C, and stable hydrogen yield was achieved at batch 5, 6 and 7. The maximum hydrogen yield was obtained at 70 °C of 176.5 mL/g-VSadded (average value of the last three batches). The amount of hydrogen production at 80 °C was negligible (only 36.5 mL/g-VSadded after 18 days), and repeated batch culture was terminated after 45 days. Fig. 2b describes the hydrogen yield and pH change in the vials at 70 °C during the whole batch culture. In batch 5th, 6th and 7th which have lasted for 5 days, it can be seen that most of the hydrogen was generated in the first 3 days with relatively high rate. On average, 246.2 ml of hydrogen, accounting for 96.2% of the total generated hydrogen volume, was collected in the first 3 days according to the measurements (data not shown) in these 3 batches. High hydrogen yield was mainly due to the community structure transformation of the mixed culture after repeated batch culture. Repeated batch culture could improve hydrogen production effectively by enrich the hydrogen-producing bacteria. It also shows that pH decreased with the hydrogen production and organic acids accumulation with final value of 5.5 (Table 2 ). As shown in Table 2, various acids were produced associated with hydrogen production. In addition, small amount of hydrogen was also generated in the vials with inoculum alone, but no hydrogen was detected and by-products generated from the inoculum maintained constant after 14 days. The influence of hydrogen and by-products produced by the inoculum can be negligible during batches 2–7. The amount and component of organic acids and ethanol reflect metabolic types of mixed bacteria under extreme-thermophilic conditions. Hydrogen yield was influenced by the organic acids distribution. Table 2 also shows that acetate, butyrate, propionate, formate, lactate and ethanol were detected as by-products while sugars were consumed completely at each temperature (data not shown). At 70 °C, acetate was the main metabolic intermediate by-product followed by lactate and ethanol with the highest hydrogen yield. While at 65 °C with lower hydrogen production, it was mainly due to sugar fermentation through lactate. It is obvious that high concentration of acetate and ethanol was usually associated with relatively high hydrogen yield, and this result reflects that it is favorable for hydrogen production when sugars are metabolized through acetate and ethanol rather than lactate. In other study, acetate and ethanol were also found as the main intermediate products during the fermentation by mixed culture at 70 °C of glucose [18]. Lactate production was decreased at higher temperature over 67 °C and high hydrogen yield was obtained at 70 and 72 °C. Prior studies showed that acetate, ethanol, and lactate were the main by-products when xylose, the main sugar in the distillery wastewater used in this study, was fermented for hydrogen production by mixed culture enriched from cow manure [26]. It is known that hydrogen is consumed when sugar is metabolized through propionate [27], which was also detected in this study. But relatively stable amount of propionate was found at each temperature. Only minor amount of formate were detected, it is favorable for hydrogen production because formate is an alternative channel for electron carrier that could be produced instead of hydrogen [28]. As presented in Table 2, high temperature was positive for repeated hydrogen-producing bacteria enrichment. More vials can be successfully enriched with hydrogen-producing mixed culture when cultivation temperature was over 67 °C. The highest hydrogen yield was 176.5 mL/g-VSadded in batch experiments at 70 °C and initial pH of 7.0. The yields obtained are much higher than the hydrogen yield (53.8 mL/g-VSadded) obtained by fermentation of cassava stillage by mixed anaerobic microflora at 60 °C [7]. Extreme-thermophilic fermentation shows obvious advantages with much higher hydrogen yield despite the substrates with different characters were used. 3.1.2 Effects of pH on hydrogen production Microbial activity is affected by the pH of the medium. The pHs of the mixed culture without pH control in batch experiments dropped due to the organic acids production. The variations of extreme-thermophilic hydrogen production at different pH are shown in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3, observable hydrogen production lasted for 7 days under pH 6.5 and for 6 days at pH 7.0 and 7.5. While hydrogen production under pH 5.5 and 6.0 was very slow. Negligible amount of hydrogen was produced after 7 days. The optimum pH for hydrogen production from distillery wastewater was around neutral. Hydrogen production rate was relatively high at pH 7.0, over 95% of the total hydrogen yield could be reached in 4 days, while at pH 6.5 this period was prolonged to 5 days. The amounts of hydrogen production at pHs below 6.5 were significantly decreased. Therefore, pH 7.0 was favorable for hydrogen production, while pH control between 6.5 and 7.0 could be acceptable for practical extreme-thermophilic fermentation at 70 °C. Previous study has also shown that neutral culture conditions (pH 6.5–7.5) were positive for hydrogen production from cow waste at 75 °C [25]. Hydrogen yield can reach 196.4 mL/g-VSadded at constant pH of 7.0, which was higher than the highest yield of 176.5 mL/g-VSadded obtained in vials without pH control. It is essential to maintain neutral pH for high hydrogen yield at 70 °C in batch mode."
8,Continuous hydrogen production in CSTR,"3.2 Continuous hydrogen production in CSTR Continuous hydrogen production from distillery wastewater was successfully demonstrated in CSTR at extrme-thermophilic condition using mixed culture which was previous enriched in repeated batch experiments. The CSTR reactor was operated at pH 7.0 ± 0.1, 70 ± 0.5 °C. The profile of hydrogen yield and concentration of intermediate products during 40-day operation are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a shows that stable hydrogen production rate of 628.5 mL/day can be obtained after 7 days’ operation. Hydrogen yield maintained at about 172.0 mL/g-VSadded. It can also be observed that sugars can be consumed completely when the CSTR was operated at 4 days’ HRT. No sugar was detected in the effluent in the first 19 days (shown in Fig. 4b). When the HRT was decreased to 3 days during day 16 and 24, hydrogen yield increased to the highest rate of 789.1 mL/day (Fig. 4a) at day 20 but with lower hydrogen yield of 102.7 mL/g-VSadded. This value sharply dropped to 348.5 mL/day at day 24 due to the accumulation of large amount of lactate (Fig. 4b) with lowest hydrogen yield of 72.3 mL/g-VSadded. Residual sugars were detected in the effluent. Furthermore, large amounts of NaOH solution were used to maintain constant pH in the fermentor by neutralizing the generated organic acids, which made this process difficult to be remained stable. In order to avoid process failure of the hydrogen fermentation caused by overload, HRT of the CSTR was prolonged to 4 days. Hydrogen yield was gradually increased to previous level (about 172.0 mL/g-VSadded) after 12 days (day 36–40) with no sugars contained in the effluent. As shown in Fig. 4b, during the period of steady operation (day 7–16, day 36–40), amounts of organic acids and ethanol production were stable. At HRT of 4 days, concentrations of main by-products, including acetate, lactate and ethanol, were 0.95 g/L, 0.48 g/L and 0.31 g/L, respectively, and constant hydrogen yield was 172.0 mL/g-VSadded. But when HRT was decreased to 3 days, lactate concentration reached high level of 0.96 g/L with the lowest hydrogen yield of 72.3 mL/g-VS added. A little xylose was detected in day 20–22 (Fig. 4b). Lactate production could be decreased by prolonging the HRT to 4 days. Lactate accumulation was also found in previous study when xylose concentration was increased for hydrogen production using mixed culture at 70 °C [29]. Lower hydrogen yield (172.0 mL/g-VSadded) compared to batch mode was probably due to sugar fermentation through lactate and generation of microbial biomass during continuous mode."
9,Comparison with other anaerobic processes for hydrogen production,"3.3 Comparison with other anaerobic processes for hydrogen production Many researchers have studied the anaerobic digestion processes for hydrogen production from various substrates as shown in Table 3 . As shown in Table 3, wheat straw hydrolysate was tested for hydrogen fermentation at 70 °C [12,30], hydrogen yield of 178.0 and 188.2 mL/g-sugarsadded was obtained in the CSTR, respectively. Hydrogen yields obtained from our continuous experiment were comparable with the hydrogen yields in previous studies. Since xylose was also the main sugars in wheat straw hydrolysate followed by glucose. Furthermore, research was also carried out in high rate reactors [30], such as UASB and AF, and highest hydrogen yield was achieved in the UASB. It is a potential high rate reactor for hydrogen fermentation and various substrates need to be tested. Studies using cassava stillage and tequila vinasses (namely distillery wastewater) as substrates under thermophilic conditions showed relatively low hydrogen yield of 53.8 mL/g-VSadded and 99 mL/g-sugarsreduced [7,15]. It may be mainly due to the low concentration of available sugars in the wastewater, choice and adaptation of the inocula. As for study carried out under other temperatures, hydrogen yield of 132.8 mL/g-CODreduced was achieved through anaerobic fermentation at 35 °C by digestion of the sugars containing in molasses [31]. Furthermore, a pilot-scale study [8] utilizing distillery effluent was carried out in 100 m3 reactor without temperature control by co-culture of defined bacteria with hydrogen yield of 30.5 mL/g-VSadded. In summary, our CSTR system under extreme-thermophilic condition was efficient for hydrogen production from distillery wastewater."
10,Bacterial community composition,"3.4 Bacterial community composition Total DNA was extracted from the mixed culture obtained in the vials with highest hydrogen yield at 70 °C after enrichment and CSTR reactor. Clone libraries of full-length 16S rDNA were constructed with the primer set (27F and 1492R). A total of 192 clones were isolated, and these clones were classified in to five OTUs as shown in Table 4 . It is found that both extreme-thermophilic hydrogen-producing mixed culture enriched by repeated batch culture and bacteria present in the CSTR was dominated with the same species, and no significant change took place after long-time operation in the CSTR reactor. As shown in Table 4, the extreme-thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria were dominated by OTUs 2 and 3. OTU1 was affiliated to Coprothermobacter sp. P1 with 99% similarities. The OTU closely related to Coprothermobacter sp. was detected in the laboratory scale thermophilic anaerobic digester of waste activated sludge with high concentration of protein [32], it was assumed to be related to anaerobic digestion of protein. This kind of species was found to be capable of degrading comprehensive substrates, including gelatin, casein, bovine albumin, peptone, yeast extract and sugars. Acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen were the main products when glucose was used as substrate associated with little amounts of propionate generated [33]. Presence of Coprothermobacter sp. was mainly due to the protein contained in the wastewater which was produced by yeast during ethanol fermentation. OTU2 showed the highest similarity to Thermotoga elfii, which was the largest species of the mixed culture. Pure culture of T. elfii can utilize glucose and xylose for hydrogen production with acetate as the main metabolic intermediate by-product [34]. The largest hydrogen yield of T. elfii was 3.33 mol/g-glucose with simultaneous production of 2 mol acetate [35]. Meanwhile, T. elfii can use various hexose and pentose sugars for hydrogen production [36]. High hydrolysis rate of xylose and glucose present in the distillery wastewater was probably related to T. elfii species. OTU3 showed 99% similarity to Caldanaerobacter sp. TC48 and Thermoanaerobacter sp. TC44. Caldanaerobacter and Thermoanaerobacter related bacteria were also found to be existed in the mixed culture when glucose was used as substrate for simultaneous hydrogen and ethanol production under extreme-thermophilic condition; lactate and acetate were the main organic acids generated [18]. These kinds of bacteria are in line with previous studies demonstration the ability for coproduction of hydrogen and ethanol [13,37,38]. OTU4 was related to Thermobrachium celere. Its subspecies could utilize a wide range of carbohydrates, including starch, dextrin, sucrose, cellobiose, fructose, maltose, ribose, glycogen and galactose. Acetate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are the end products of glucose fermentation [39]. OTU5 shows the highest similarity, 98%, to a hydrogen-producing extreme thermophile, Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii. The known species C. kristjanssonii strain 177R1B(T) was capable of fermenting many substrates, including cellulose, xylan, starch and pectin. Strain 177R1B(T) produced acetate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide as major fermentation products together with small amounts of lactate and ethanol [40]. Results showed that a wide range of bacteria were present in the extreme-thermophilic hydrogen-producing mixed culture. It made the mixed culture capable of degrading xylose, glucose, cellulose, hemicellulose and protein contained in the distillery wastewater."
11,Conclusions,"The distillery wastewater generated in bioethanol production from lignocellulose materials can be supplied as excellent substrates for extreme-thermophilic hydrogen production. Hydrogen yield of 172.0 mL/g-VSadded was achieved at 70 °C, pH 7.0 and HRT of 4 days in the CSTR reactor. T. elfii and Coprothermobacter sp. were the dominant bacteria. Caldanaerobacter/Thermoanaerobacter, Thermobrachium, and Caldicellulosiruptor were also detected. Mixed culture was favorable for hydrogen production from distillery wastewater because of its comprehensive bacteria. Effective utilization of lignocellulose materials can be achieved by subsequent hydrogen production from distillery wastewater after bioethanol distillation, which is positive for sustainable development of bioethanol industry."
