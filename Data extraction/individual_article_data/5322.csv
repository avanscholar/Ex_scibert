0,Introduction,"Since the discovery [1,2] of the extraordinary catalytic properties of porous gold (PG) this remarkable material has become a new class of catalyst with potential applications in a wide range of fields [3–6]. PG has unique properties such as superior chemical stability, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivities. A great advantage of a PG catalyst is its self-supporting nature. PG exhibits remarkably high activity for CO oxidation even at ambient temperature [1,2]. High catalytic performance of PG has also been reported for oxygen-assisted coupling of alcohols, a reaction of general significance in the chemical industry [6]. In this work, we demonstrate that PG is also a highly selective and active catalyst for acetylene semi-hydrogenation. Porous gold structures can be prepared by leaching from alloys of Au with less noble elements such as Ag, Cu or Al. The structure of PG consists of pores and metallic ligaments that have both concave and convex surfaces. The sizes of these pores and ligaments can range from tens of nanometers to the micrometer scale depending on the composition of the alloy and the dealloying conditions. The specific surface area of PG is on the order of a few square meters per gram [6]. The extraordinary catalytic activity of PG is surprising and not yet fully understood. Previously it was supposed that catalytically active Au must be in the form of small nanoparticles. Studies on the chemical reactivity of various atomic clusters representing the surface of Au nanoparticles have shown that the chemical reactivity of Au atoms significantly increases with decreasing coordination number (CN) [8–12]. Low-coordinated Au atoms at corners and possibly edges of the nanoparticles can act as catalytically active sites. The density of such sites naturally increases with decreasing nanoparticle size. To explain the observed catalytic activity of the nanoparticles, the interaction with the metal oxide support must also play an important role [13,14]. The characteristic size of the structural features of PG is about 50 nm, which is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the upper size limit for catalytically active nanoparticles. Thus, the origin of the active sites and the atomistic scenario behind the catalytic activity of PG have been widely debated [6,15–22]. The superior catalytic activity of dealloyed Ag-Au for low-temperature CO oxidation has been attributed to residual Ag [17,20,21]. Traces of Ag typically remain in PG samples and can adsorb and activate molecular oxygen. However, this explanation is not applicable in the case of possible residual oxides in PG prepared from Al–Au [22] or Cu–Au [23] alloys. In a recent study, Duan and Xu [19] reached the conclusion that oxide residues in the as-leached PG catalysts had almost no effect on the catalytic activity of PG, and that the catalytic activity originated from metallic Au. Recently, we reported that PG prepared by leaching of Al2Au (hereafter denoted as PG(Al2Au)) with 10%NaOH aqueous solution had high activity for low-temperature CO oxidation [22,24,25]. The origin of the high activity was attributed to the high density of defects in the three-dimensional network of nanoscale ligaments [22]. In high-resolution TEM images of the ligaments we observed a high density of twin boundaries with nanoscale domain sizes (ca. 3–10 nm) [24,25]. We showed that these defects in PG could form active sites for the catalytic reaction. On the basis of our experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we proposed a new mechanism for CO oxidation over PG(Al2Au) based on low-coordinated Au sites created by the twin boundary (TB) defects. The TB defects on the {211} surfaces form long close-packed rows of active Au atoms with CN = 6, denoted as W-chains. Ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that these chains of low-coordinated Au sites were responsible for the high catalytic activity of PG(Al2Au) for CO oxidation [24,25]. Product selectivity is a great challenge in the development of new catalysts [26–28]. A rather simple model reaction in which product selectivity is an important issue is acetylene semi-hydrogenation. Recently, semi-hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene has received particular experimental [29–35] and theoretical [36–39] attention. Selective hydrogenation of acetylene over Au catalysts has also been discussed in the literature [40–48]. For example, Tamaru et al. reported that Au/Al2O3 exhibited excellent performance in acetylene semi-hydrogenation with a selectivity of over 90% for ethylene production. The maximum Au particle size that affected the reaction rate was evaluated to be 2.5–3 nm [41]. However, all these papers associated the activity with either the size of the Au nanoparticles or the interactions between the nanoparticles and the oxide support. The origin of the active sites and atomistic scenario behind the nanoparticles are still not completely clear due to the difficulty in characterizing nanoparticle surface. In this paper, we report the first observation of high catalytic performance of porous Au for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. Interestingly, the high catalytic performance is observed only on porous Au with a high density of twin boundaries, PG(Al2Au). With the help of DFT calculations we interpret the origin of the catalytically active Au sites and discuss the observed high activity and selectivity for acetylene semi-hydrogenation in terms of the low-coordinated Au atoms created by the twinning defects."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Ingots of the intermetallic compound Al2Au and the solid solution Ag3Au were prepared from constituent elements with purities of > 99.9%, in an electric arc furnace under an Ar atmosphere. The prepared Al2Au sample was annealed at 1073 K for 48 h, and subsequently crushed and screened to powder with particle sizes of less than 125 μm. An Ag3Au ribbon (ca. 0.01 mm thickness, ca. 2 mm width) was obtained using single roller melt spinning method under an Ar atmosphere. The Al2Au powder and the Ag3Au ribbon were leached in a 10 wt.% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution for 4 h and in conc. HNO3 for 12 h at room temperature, respectively. Next, they were filtered and thoroughly washed with distilled water until pH 7 was achieved. The composition of the samples (at%) after the leaching treatment was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. Additionally, Au powder (99.999%, 93–7902 Lot#A6709017, Strem Chemicals) and Au/TiO2 catalyst (1.5 wt.% Au; Au-TiO2 #028, World Gold Council (WGC) [Gold Bull., 36 (2003) 24.]) were investigated as reference samples."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface areas of the samples were measured by Brunauer- Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis with a Kr adsorption analyzer (BELSORP Max, BEL Japan Inc.). Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HXPS) and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurements were conducted for each sample using high-brilliance synchrotron radiation on BL 15XU (hν = 5.951 keV for HXPS, λ = 0.65297 Å for SXRD) at the SPring-8 facility, Japan [49,50]. The morphology of the samples was observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; S-5500, Hitachi) in conjunction with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; EDAX). The crystallite size (D) and lattice strain (ε) for each sample were obtained by a Williamson-Hall (W-H) analysis of peak broadening in the XRD patterns [51]. Details of this method have been previously described [22]."
4,3. Catalytic test,"2.3 3. Catalytic test The acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a standard fixed-bed flow reactor by passing a gaseous mixture of C2H2 (2 vol%) and H2 (80 vol%) under a flow of helium at a total flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1 (total pressure: 1 atm; space velocity (SV): 50,000 h−1). 50 mg of the sample was charged into a straight quartz tube with a 4 mm internal diameter. The catalytic experiments were performed in the temperature range of 300–600 K using fresh catalysts without any pretreatments. The products were monitored using on-line gas chromatograpy (GC; Shimadzu GC-8 A) with a Shincarbon ST column (for C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4 analysis) with He carrier gas. The selectivity (Sx (C-%)) of the carbon-containing products was calculated using the following equation, Sx (C-%) = Cx / (2 × [C2H4]mol + 2 × [C2H6]mol + [CH4]mol) x 100 where Cx represents the experimentally measured mole concentrations of C2H4, C2H6 and CH4 in the outlet gases. It should be noted that the mass balance of carbon between the amounts of the products and the amount of consumed C2H2 was confirmed for every sample. The data in the catalytic activity measurements were collected when the reaction attained a steady state after 0.5 h."
5,Computational,"2.4 Computational The DFT calculations of the electronic structure were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) program [52,53]. The PAW exchange- correlation functional [54] and a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV were used. Transition states were determined using the climbing-image nudged-elastic band method [55] and the dimer method [56]. For the structural optimizations and transition-state localizations, convergence criteria of 10−4 eV for total energies and 0.05 eV/Å for forces acting on the atoms were applied. A (211) surface with a twin boundary defect was represented using a relatively large structural model of 136 atoms consisting of 6 × 6 surface cells with a surface area of 14.457 Å × 17.707 Å. For the calculations of adsorption energies and reaction paths, we used a slab consisting of 12 atomic layers. The coordinates of the atoms in the four bottom layers were fixed. The slabs were separated by a vacuum layer of 13 Å. Total energies of adsorption complexes were calculated using a 3 × 3×1 k-point mesh for Brillouin-zone integration."
6,Results,"Fig. 1 shows FE-SEM micrographs of leached Al2Au and Ag3Au. Both structures consist of a uniform three-dimensional network of interconnected ligaments. Hereafter, for convenience the porous Au samples prepared by leaching Al2Au and Ag3Au are referred to as PG(Al2Au) and PG(Ag3Au), respectively. At first glance, significant differences in morphology between PG(Al2Au) and PG(Ag3Au) are visible; the former exhibits a relatively smaller porosity, finer ligaments, and an anisotropic microstructure. As shown in Table 1 , the BET surface area for PG(Al2Au) is larger than that for PG(Ag3Au). The amounts of residual Al in PG(Al2Au) and residual Ag in PG(Ag3Au) are 5.7 and 13.2 at%, respectively. The porous structure of PG(Al2Au) is finer than that of PG(Ag3Au) due to differences in the dissolution process caused by alkaline and acid aqueous solutions. The characteristic ligament sizes in PG(Al2Au) and PG(Ag3Au) are around 20 nm and 50 nm, respectively. The leaching process is also different for an Al2Au intermetallic compound with an ordered structure and an Ag3Au solid solution with a disordered structure. The morphology of porous Au is strongly dependent on the parameters of the leaching process such as the crystal structure of the precursor alloys, the reagents used and the dissolution rate [57,58]. The important point is that a considerable amount of residual Ag, which can take part in catalytic reactions, remains in PG(Ag3Au). Fig. 2 (a) shows the areal reaction rate of C2H2 [molC2H2 min−1 m-2 Au] as a function of reaction temperature for acetylene hydrogenation over PG(Al2Au), PG(Ag3Au) and Au powder. The catalytic performance of PG(Al2Au) is much higher than that of PG(Ag3Au) and Au powder over the same temperature range. The areal reaction rate [molC2H2 min-1 m-2 Au] is a specific reaction rate with respect to the apparent effective surface area of Au, which is measured using Kr adsorption on each sample. For comparison, the catalytic performance of supported Au/TiO2 (WGC) was also investigated under the same reaction conditions. The catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 (WGC) for acetylene hydrogenation was also much lower than that of PG(Al2Au) below 500 K. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the selectivity to C2H4 production was above 95% for acetylene hydrogenation over PG(Al2Au) in the temperature range between 350 K and 523 K. In contrast, Au/TiO2 (WGC), PG(Ag3Au) and Au powder exhibited neither high activity nor high selectivity at temperatures below 573 K. This is very remarkable since it is known that PG(Ag3Au) exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for CO oxidation even at room temperature [1,2]. In this case, the residual Ag in PG is believed to provide sites where O2 is adsorbed and dissociates, which are important steps for the catalytic activity toward CO oxidation [3,15,20]. However, the residual Ag does not help in the hydrogenation of C2H2 and hence the activity, C2H4 selectivity, and temperature dependence for PG(Ag3Au) are very similar to those for Au powder. In this reaction, PG(Ag3Au) simply behaves as pure Au powder. On the other hand, PG(Al2Au) exhibits high catalytic performance in acetylene semi-hydrogenation as well as in CO oxidation. This result suggests that the origin of active sites for these catalytic processes is intrinsically different for PG(Al2Au) and PG(Ag3Au). Fig. 3 shows valence and Au 4f HXPS obtained from PG(Al2Au), PG(Ag3Au) and Au powder. For the valence and Au 4f spectra of Au powder, no chemical shift from pure Au was observed for both PG(Al2Au) and PG(Ag3Au). Since HXPS pattern are bulk sensitive, it can be supposed that the bulk chemical states of Au in all samples are essentially the same. Nevertheless, the catalytic performance is substantially different among the samples (Fig. 2). It should be noted that there was residual Al species on PG(Al2Au) [22]. However, contribution of residual Al species for the hydrogenation of C2H2 was small since the catalytic activity did not show a simple correlation with the amount of residual Al species such as AlOx. This indicates that the origin of the different catalytic performance must be differences in the surface structures. Fig. 4 (a) shows SXRD patterns for PG(Al2Au), PG(Ag3Au) and Au powder. The PG structure is formed by rapid rearrangement of atoms during the leaching process, and leads to a considerable amounts of structural defects or strain in the lattice. This is reflected by changes in the XRD patterns such as broadening or shifting of the diffraction peaks [59,60]. Information about the defect density, the crystallite size and the lattice strain can be obtained from the peak widths [51]. Fig. 4(b) shows Williamson-Hall (W-H) plots for PG(Al2Au), PG(Ag3Au) and Au powder. The plots were obtained from 10 diffraction peaks associated with face centered cubic (fcc) Au from 15° to 55° (λ = 0.65297 Å; Fig. 4(a)). The SXRD patterns exhibit distinct differences among these three samples (Fig. 4(b)). Good linearity of the W-H plot is obtained for the Au powder and PG(Ag3Au), whereas a large degree of scatter is observed for PG(Al2Au). The crystallite size and lattice strain were determined from the SXRD peak widths. Table 1 summarizes the results for the strain, the crystallite size and the lattice constant. The linearity of the W-H plot is an indication of whether the strain is isotropic or anisotropic, while the slope corresponds to the amount of internal strain. From this, it is clear that the three samples in Fig. 4(b) are completely different in terms of strain. There is almost no strain for Au powder, and PG(Ag3Au) exhibits homogeneous or isotropic strain. On the other hand, the W-H data for PG(Al2Au) is very scattered around a straight line with a steep slope obtained by the least squares method. The origin of the strain in PG(Al2Au) has been discussed in a previous paper [24]. Due to anisotropic strain, the peak-width dependence on the wave vector (4πsinθ/λ) is scattered, and the significant broadening of the (200) and (400) peaks is characteristic of the presence of twin boundary (TB) defects along the <111> directions [24,60]. The density of TB defects previously determined using HR-TEM is qualitatively in agreement with that obtained from the XRD results [24]. Compared to TEM, XRD can obtain more global information about the TB defects that influence the catalytic properties. The PG(Al2Au) sample used in this study possesses a high density of TB defects, similar to previous reports [24,25]. In contrast, TB defects are rarely observed in PG(Ag3Au) samples [18,61]. Considering the results shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), we may conclude that the density of TB defects is negligible in the Au powder and PG(Ag3Au). There is a good correlation between catalytic activities and W-H plots for PG samples. If we compare PG(Al2Au) with Au powder and PG(Ag3Au), it is very clear that only the former shows very high activity and selectivity, and this is thought to be associated with the presence of TB defects. Of course, peak broadening may not be caused only by TB defects, and grain boundaries or other defects may make some contribution. However, the TB defects must play the major role. We note that elastic strain can be induced only when two twin boundaries are very close. It is not possible to completely separate the contribution to peak broadening made by TB defects and other defects. However, the important point is that TBs are planar defects that must intercept the ligament surface [24,25]. In order to examine the effect of TB defects on the catalytic properties of PG(Al2Au) for C2H2 hydrogenation, we performed the same set of experimental measurements using PG(Al2Au) after annealing at 873 K for 3 h in He (hereafter denoted as PG(Al2Au)-873 K). As shown in Fig. 4, this causes a reduction in the amount of broadening of (200) and (400) peaks and the W-H plot shows good linearity, similar to that for PG(Ag3Au); this indicates the annihilation of most TB defects. Simultaneously, a significant decrease in activity for CO oxidation [24] and hydrogenation of C2H2 (see Fig. 2(a)) was observed. In our previous studies, we showed that TB defects create rows of highly reactive low-coordination Au sites, denoted as a W-chain, that contribute to the catalytic activity for CO oxidation [24,25]. The structure of the fcc lattice can be considered as a stacking of hexagonal atomic planes in the [111] direction. From the viewpoint of the atomic structure, a TB defect represents a fault in the stacking sequence. The atomic planes have three possible stacking positions denoted as a, b and c. As shown in Fig. 5 , instead of the usual periodic sequence of (111) planes …abcabcabc…, the introduction of a TB produces the sequence ….abcabcAcbacba… (A marks the position of the TB defect). On the perpendicular (11-2) surface, the TB defect creates a closed-packed row of Au atoms with CN = 6. This chain of surface atoms denoted as the W-chain is the top edge of the (111) plane perpendicular to the (11-2) surface. Vacancies in the linear row of atoms in the W-chain can create even more reactive sites with CN = 5. Our ab initio DFT calculations demonstrated that the observed excellent catalytic performance of PG(Al2Au) can originate from the W-chains. We studied the selective hydrogenation of acetylene on a twinned (211) surface with a W-chain. The Au atoms in the W-chain can easily adsorb hydrocarbon molecules C2Hx (x = 2–5) but these sites are not sufficiently reactive to adsorb H2 molecules. Molecular hydrogen cannot be dissociated on Au sites with CN = 6. To obtain high catalytic activity for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene, fragments of the W-chain consisting of Au sites with CN = 5 must also be considered. These end-atoms on the fragmented W-chains play an important role since they make hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, and subsequent hydrogenation reactions possible. Fig. 6 presents the computational cell with the initial configuration of H2 and C2H2 molecules adsorbed on a fragment of a W-chain. The hydrogenation reaction of C2H2 proceeds sequentially via the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The reaction pathway starts with H2 adsorption on the end-atom of the W-chain. The binding energy for H2 of −6 kJ/mol is rather low. (We note that if dispersion interactions are also considered, H2 adsorption is significantly increased to −14 kJ/mol.). Fig. 7 shows the energy profile for the reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of acetylene. The energy barrier for H2 dissociation is 62 kJ/mol. The hydrogenation process can then proceed on the internal Au atoms of the W-chain with CN = 6. The energy barrier for the C2H2 → C2H4 step is 61 kJ/mol, while the barrier for the C2H3 → C2H4 step is 53 kJ/mol. The red lines correspond to acetylene semi-hydrogenation to ethylene. The energies are presented with respect to the energy of the reactants H2(g) and C2H2(g) in the gas state. The dashed lines correspond to diffusion steps for H. The barrier for a diffusion jump of H along the W-chain is ∼26 kJ/mol. The green line is the desorption energy level Ed for ethylene with respect to the energy of the reactants in the gas phase, i.e., Ed = −218 kJ/mol. The blue lines correspond to further hydrogenation of ethylene. The adsorbed ethylene molecule can either be desorbed (green arrow) or the hydrogenation process can continue (blue arrows). The desorption energy for C2H4 is 42 kJ/mol. The hydrogenation step C2H4 → C2H5 requires the barrier of 61 kJ/mol to be overcome. Ethylene will thus prefer desorption to further hydrogenation. The selectivity is defined [62,63] as the energy difference between the energy of the transition state of the C2H4 → C2H5 hydrogenation step and the desorption energy level of C2H4(g), as ΔEselect = 21 kJ/mol. The calculated high selectivity is in agreement with the experimentally observed high selectivity (see Fig. 2(b))."
7,Discussion,"In the previous sections we have demonstrated the remarkably high catalytic performance of the PG(Al2Au) catalyst for selective hydrogenation of acetylene. In the temperature range between 350 K and 523 K the selectivity for C2H4 production was above 95% (see Fig. 2). The difference in catalytic behavior between the PG(Al2Au) and PG(Ag3Au) catalysts is also remarkable. The catalytic performance of PG(Ag3Au) is very low, essentially the same as that of powder Au. On the other hand, it is known that both PG(Ag3Au) [15,17,20] and PG(Al2Au) [22,24,25] are highly active catalyst for CO oxidation even at ambient temperatures [1,2]. The difference in catalytic performance is related to the presence of defects in the crystal lattice, as indicated in Fig. 4. For PG(Al2Au), a high density of TB defects with sizes of about 3–10 nm was observed in TEM images of the ligaments. This was not the case for PG(Ag3Au), where such defects were rarely observed. The role of the TB defects in enhancing the catalytic performance of PG(Al2Au) for acetylene semi-hydrogenation is also supported by the DFT calculations. It is interesting to compare the calculated selectivity of ΔEselect = 21 kJ/mol with the selectivity of the other catalysts. Numerous experimental studies of hydrogenation reactions on catalysts consisting of intermetallic compounds, e.g., Al13Co4 [64], Al13Fe4 [35], GaPd [29,30] and GaPd2 [29,30], demonstrated that the selectivity for acetylene semi-hydrogenation can be improved if the transition metal atoms are surrounded by simple metal atoms. Motivated by these experimental studies, we used DFT to investigate acetylene hydrogenation reactions on various surfaces of intermetallic compounds including the (100) surface of Al13Co4 [64], the pseudo-5-fold (210) surface of B20-type AlPd [65] and GaPd [66], the polar (111) and (-1-1-1) surfaces of GaPd [62], and the Ga-enriched (010) surface of orthorhombic GaPd2 [63]. Some of the calculated activation energies for hydrogen dissociation, the hydrogenation steps and the selectivities are listed in Table 2 . Similarly as in previous studies on CO oxidation [24,25], the present work also demonstrates that the high catalytic performance of the PG(Al2Au) catalyst for acetylene hydrogenation is due to the existence of highly reactive low-coordinated Au sites created by TB defects. We used a model of the twinned Au (211) surface with a fragment of a W-chain. The finite W-chain is considered to generate end-sites with CN = 5 where H2 can be adsorbed and dissociated. The highest energy barrier of 62 kJ/mol is calculated for the H2 dissociation step. However, since this energy is almost the same as the activation energy for the first H transfer step, a clear conclusion regarding the rate-controlling step for the entire hydrogenation pathway cannot be made. Acetylene is adsorbed in a di-σ bridging configuration between two atoms of the W-chain. Atomic hydrogen moves along the W-chain by diffusion and reacts with the C2Hx species. The highest activation energies for the hydrogenation steps are comparable or lower to those for other considered catalyst surfaces. Table 2 shows that the calculated selectivity ΔEselect for the twinned Au(211) surface is the highest for all the catalyst surfaces compared. The selectivity of the catalyst results from the desorption energy for weakly bound ethylene, which is lower than the activation energy for further hydrogenation (Fig. 7). We note that the experimentally observed high selectivity of PG(Al2Au) is also supported by the uniqueness of the W-chain sites. In case of intermetallic catalysts, e.g., GaPd the experimentally measured catalytic performance originates from contributions from various possible surface terminations differing in activity and selectivity. However, in the case of porous Au, the selectivity originates only from the W-sites while the rest of the catalyst surface is inactive. We have shown that the W-chains on the {211} surfaces can be primarily formed by the twinning process. The atomic sites on the W-chains are perfect fcc sites. Each atomic site has its nearest neighbors at a distance of a0/√2. However, because of their low coordination they can be relocated by diffusion easier than other neighboring atoms. It was observed [61,67] that under the reaction conditions, the internal surfaces of porous Au catalysts can dynamically change their atomic arrangement. The restructuring of the internal surfaces of PG is driven by surface diffusion [61,67]. If the diffusion removes some sites from the W-chain more reactive Au sites with CN = 5 necessary for the hydrogenation reaction are created. At higher temperatures most of the atoms from the W-chain can disappear. However, at lower temperatures the W-chain of atomic sites can again be restored by diffusion of Au adatoms from neighboring surfaces. The inner curvature of the V-shaped edge (see Fig. 8 ) created by twinning is a natural trapping and grouping position for Au adatoms diffusing from the neighboring {111} surfaces [25]. This is also consistent with the results of a recent in situ TEM study [61] of the diffusion mobility of surface atoms in PG. It was observed that the V-edge between two {111} planes formed by twinning plays a role as a pinning location for a propagating diffusion front of Au adatoms. Although bulk Au is known to be nearly chemically inert, the situation is different for nanostructured Au. The chemical reactivity of Au atoms depends on the number of nearest neighbors in their environment which is expressed by the coordination number. It seems that a coordination of CN = 6 is critical for the reactivity of Au atoms. Brodersen et al. [7] studied the catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles of various shapes and compared the activity of sites with CN ≥ 7 to those of sites with CN = 6. They concluded that the contribution of the sites with CN ≥ 7 to the overall catalytic activity of the nanoparticles was negligible, and was 104 times smaller than the contribution of sites with CN = 6. In addition to various randomly created point-like defects on the surface of the nanoparticles the systematically created sites with CN = 6 are only at the corners of the nanoparticles. We have shown that twinning in the fcc lattice is also a possible mechanism for systematic formation of highly under-coordinated surface atoms. Our experimental data revealed a strong correlation between the observed catalytic performance for both CO oxidation and acetylene semi-hydrogenation reactions and the density of TB defects in the fcc lattice of the porous nanostructure of the catalysts. We have also shown that the surface density of the six-coordinated active sites in PG is comparable with that in the supported nanoparticle Au catalysts [25]. CN = 6 sites of PG(Al2Au) and Au/TiO2 (WGC) already have been estimated 0.10 sites/nm2 Au and 0.31 sites/nm2 Au, respectively. Turnover frequency (TOF [s−1]) of C2H2 hydrogenation based on Fig. 2(a) (each reaction areal rate value at 400 K), which was estimated by assuming that all of CN = 6 sites play as active sites. TOFs at 400 K of PG(Al2Au) and Au/TiO2 (WGC) are 4.3 [s−1] and 3.0 [s−1], respectively. Considering that errors are including, these values are almost comparable. Consequently, it might be that the kinetic parameters of PG(Al2Au) and Au/TiO2 (WGC) indicate their similar active sites and/or catalytic mechanism. The physical and chemical properties of these low-coordinated sites can help in understanding the extraordinary catalytic activity of the PG(Al2Au) catalyst for acetylene semi-hydrogenation."
8,Conclusions,"We observed a high catalytic performance for PG(Al2Au) for selective hydrogenation of acetylene and proposed a reaction mechanism. We demonstrated a correlation between the high catalytic performance and the presence of TB defects in the fcc lattice. The TB defects on the {211} surfaces of PG(Al2Au) can create highly reactive closed-packed rows of Au sites with coordination number CN = 6 or 5. Using DFT methods, we showed that on these under-coordinated atomic sites hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, and subsequent acetylene hydrogenation can proceed via the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. The reactivity of the W-chains in the PG(Al2Au) can thus explain not only the catalytic activity toward the CO oxidation studied previously [24,25] but also the activity toward the semi-hydrogenation of C2H2. Twinning in the fcc lattice is thus a new mechanism for systematic formation of highly reactive under-coordinated surface atoms (i.e., CN = 6 or 5) in nanostructured catalysts."
