0,Introduction,"Landfills and oceans are flooded with various wastes, some of which are biodegradable (including lignocellulose), others may lead to various environmental problems. At the same time, mankind needs to find new resources for production of energy and everyday-life items. The ’Golden fossil fuel age’ and the old linear economy (in contrast to a circular one) are now viewed as unsustainable. One way forward includes circular economy aspects, e.g. comprising use of lignocellulose wastes as the substrate for a fermentation process. This will help waste management systems, will eliminate odours and will replace coal and other ‘ancient lignocellulose products’ (lignite, peat) that have been the main source of energy in Poland and Europe since XVIII century (in Great Britain since XII century) but are now increasingly depleted, need to be imported and greatly contribute to air pollution (de Gouw et al., 2019). In contrast, lignocellulose wastes are abundant everywhere. The civil industry consuming plants: including agriculture, textile, food, paper and furniture industries, produce large quantities of lignocellulose wastes (Diaz et al., 2018) that need to be managed using appropriate technologies (Kumari and Singh, 2018). For example, in Poland lignocellulose wastes constitute up to 43% of municipal wastes (4 417 Gigagrams) (Madej, 2016). There are several technologies competing for lignocellulose wastes related to e.g.: medical and industrial nanomaterials (Dilfi K.F. et al., 2018), biopolymers replacing fossil-fuel polymers (Myasoedova, 2017) and biofuel production (hydrogen, methane, alcohols) (Akobi et al., 2016); by fermentation (Bundhoo et al., 2015), pyrolysis (Nsaful et al., 2015; Vamvuka, 2011), photopyrolysis (Kuehnel and Reisner, 2018), gasification (Gai and Dong, 2012) or plasma methods (Czylkowski et al., 2018). Dark fermentation (DF) is less energy demanding than other methods like biomass pyrolysis (Duque et al., 2017) or gasification (Ashraf and Schmidt, 2018) and enables hydrogen production from waste (El-Emam and Özcan, 2019). Lignocellulose is generally a much poorer energy carrier than fossil fuels due to its higher oxygen to carbon ratio, so, the main role of applied technologies like anaerobic digestion or dark fermentation is to reduce this ratio in derived fuels (methane or hydrogen). Anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation are low-energy processes, producing energy carriers efficiently - being simultaneously relevant chemical resources (hydrogen, methane) - and fertilizer (including nitrogen and phosphorus compounds). The anaerobic fermentation (microbial or mycological) of simple sugars, fats and proteins may lead to production of other valuable chemicals such as organic acids (e.g. lactic or butyric acid), ethanol, butanol, etc. Low profitability of biogas plants and dark fermentation can be improved by production of more valuable chemicals, like lactic acid (Pradhan et al., 2019), vanillin (Hashemi et al., 2019), FAME (Guo et al., 2015), fertilizers (Ito et al., 2005) or nutrients (Romão et al., 2019). Besides, hydrogen (as well as biohydrogen) is one of the basic substrates for technologies like: synthesis of aniline from nitrobenzene, hexamethylenediamine synthesis, hydrocracking, synthetic gas generation (ICI process, Lurgi, gasification of coal), hydrogenation of hard coal, ammonia synthesis, methanol synthesis, hydrogenation of fats, oxo-processes, Fischer-Tropsch or 1,4-butanediol synthesis. Most of the hydrogen produced, 53%, is used for ammonia synthesis (Sołowski, 2018). However, the development of biohydrogen technologies is inhibited by problems with its storage (Hsu and Lin, 2016; Lamb et al., 2019). Anaerobic digestion (AD) is at minimum a two-step but more often a four-step process. The organic raw materials (comprising sugars, fats and proteins or mixture of them) are hydrolyzed into organic acids, oligosaccharides or simple sugars and glycerol. The resulting feed is then converted by bacteria, e.g. Clostridia or Enterobacter, into hydrogen and volatile fatty acid (valeric, propionic, butyric or acetic acid) and finally by methanogenic bacteria it is converted into methane (Skorek et al., 2003). A general scheme of the process is shown in Fig. 1 . Dark fermentation is a type (first part) of anaerobic digestion process where sugars or glycerol is converted into hydrogen, carbon dioxide and volatile fatty acids (butyric or acetic) and stops there i.e. it does not include methanogenesis (Chaganti et al., 2012). The inhibition of methanogenesis (in DF) often proceeds by stressing the bacteria by: heat shock (boiling or freezing) (Hernández et al., 2019), sudden change of pH (Yang et al., 2019), microwaves (Rafieenia et al., 2018a), sonication, twisting (Perez-Pimienta et al., 2016) or chemical agents (Hu and Chen, 2007). The process of dark fermentation from hexoses proceeds along one of the thermodynamically possible pathways (Woodward et al., 2000; Hussy et al., 2005; Bartacek et al., 2007): acetate eq. (1), butyrate eq. (2) or acetate-ethanol process eq. (3) (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 +2H 2 O →2CH 3 COOH+2CO 2 +4H 2 , ΔG 0 = -48 kJ mol−1 , (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 →CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH - + 2CO 2 +2H 2 ΔG 0 =-137 kJ mol−1 , (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 +H 2 O→CH 3 COOH + CH 3 CH 2 OH+2CO 2 +2H 2 . ΔG 0 = -97 kJ mol−1 , The acetate pathway is the one with the highest theoretical hydrogen yield: 4 mol of H2 from 1 mol of hexose. The most efficient way reported by Hawkes et al. (2007) is the acetate pathway (1) but the most common is the butyrate fermentation (2). In the case of pentoses, the reaction proceeds according to the equation (Pradhan et al., 2016) (4) C5H10O5+2.67H2O →1.67CH3COOH+1.67CO2+3.2H2, ΔG0 = −197.66 kJ mol−1 The anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation usually proceeds under a stable mesophilic-temperature, in the range 38–42 °C, but recent reports on higher methane production and possible more valuable by-products (like lactic acid) turned interest toward the thermophilic temperature range (55–60 °C) (Pradhan et al., 2019). The optimal pH for hydrogen production during DF seems to be 5.0 to 6.0 (Muñoz-Páez et al., 2019; Poggi-Varaldo et al., 2014) while for methane production in AD tends toward 7.0 to 9.0 (Kim, 2016; Muñoz-Páez et al., 2018). However, quite surprisingly, there are also reported high hydrogen yields during DF of wheat straw at pH 2.4 (Nasirian et al., 2011) and 9.0 (Li et al., 2018). In contrast, Giovannini et al. (2016) reported that during fermentation of substrates with higher content of lignin (above 10%), due to growing pH, methanogens are stimulated to higher methane production (and net hydrogen production decreases). Although equations (1–4) present fermentation pathways starting from simple sugars, they occur quite seldom in nature. Hence, the simple organic compounds need to be gained from complex ones by hydrolysis (during various pretreatment processes). One of the relevant (complex) sources of simple sugars is lignocellulose, the main constituent of plants. Other, initially pretreated, lignocellulose material can be obtained from the manure of herbivorous animals (better pretreated by ruminant and less by other species). Thus there are attempts to build reactors imitating pig or cow stomachs (Cieślik et al., 2016). Hendriks and Zeeman (2009) found hemicellulose to be the most sensitive to thermal and chemical pretreatment part of lignocellulose. The biomass pretreatment methods can be categorized as physical, chemical, thermo-chemical and biological. The studies related to this topic are very numerous - according to Web of Science, in 2019 alone, 680 articles were published. According to Taherzadeh and Karimi (2008) the most promising are chemical methods because they are more energy efficient if compared to mechanical ones and faster than biological ones. However, distinctive conditions and chemicals might be required (Aslanzadeh et al., 2013; Jeihanipour et al., 2013a). The pretreatment process allows biogas (hydrogen and/or methane) production to be enhanced (Yu et al., 2018) and separate digestible (for anaerobic bacteria) compounds from the ones inhibiting fermentation. This article aims at a review of recently performed investigations of pretreatment methods applied to increase of hydrogen and methane production as well as the theoretical estimation of this production. The paper includes discussion of models for the theoretical and technical potential of hydrogen and methane production. It should be mentioned that better understanding of dark fermentation and pretreatment processes enable optimization of both dark and methane fermentation (Pachapur et al., 2019). There are already a few interesting review papers published in the last decade (Kumari and Singh, 2018; Chen et al., 2017b; Rabemanolontsoa and Saka, 2016; Nissilä et al., 2014) related to lignocellulose pretreatment-methods as an initial step in biorefinery technologies. The main conclusions are presented in Table 1 for easier comparison. Summarizing; although the pretreatment studies have a long history, and series of excellent reviewing papers exists, there is still a need for an efficient, eco-friendly, low cost, and simple operation pretreatment process (Chen et al., 2017b). The biorefinery technology must optimize the saccharification process in relation to the respective fermentation processes, taking into account substrate and possible inhibiting product generated during pretreatment. The considered issue is so complex and innovative that during the last 4 years 4190 articles were published relating solely to dark fermentation and respective pretreatment methods. The more than 200 papers selected here present new developments in the field of efficient and eco-friendly pretreatment methods for hydrogen and methane production, their advantages and drawbacks as well as inhibiting species generation. The necessary general approach also includes issues related to production system design and the theoretical potential of hydrogen and methane production from various waste substrates. The prospects of future investigations are listed in the Conclusions."
1,Research methods,"The review of pretreatment methods was made based on selected works published in the period from 2015 to 2019 (8765 articles). The topic is very popular thus; updates of collection are needed to show different pathways of research and lignocellulose utilization in green chemistry and sustainable energy production. Above 200 articles published in the last 4 years were selected to show results of developed lignocellulose pretreatment-methods. In the review, most attention is paid to chemical pretreatment methods, which besides mechanical ones are the oldest methods used (e.g. acid pretreatment). The review focuses on the influence of different parameters, substrates and processes on methane and dark fermentation (Chiumenti et al., 2018). The properties of the most commonly used plants and what makes them efficient biogas substrates are discussed also. The theoretical potentials of hydrogen and methane production are assessed using Buswell (Saxena et al., 2019) and Solowski models (Sołowski et al., 2019) based on properties of corn (Pronyk and Mazza, 2012), textife (Chen et al., 2017; Sołowski, 2016a) and wood wastes (Kacik et al., 2014 Sołowski, 2016b). The results of modelling are compared and discussed."
2,Properties of substrates for methane/hydrogen production and their productivity,
3,Properties of lignocellulosic substrates versus production system design,"3.1 Properties of lignocellulosic substrates versus production system design The lignocellulose content varies in different plants, depends on age and part of the plant (see Fig. 2 ), as well as on geographic location of plantation. In the case of herbivorous animal manure (special case of lignocellulose waste), the kind of animal is also critical. Therefore, during planning and designing of any industrial process, which applies lignocellulosic waste, it is necessary to use statistical data such as mean value, median and dominants of the plants’ characteristics. The problem is that existing data is very scarce. Lignocellulose (main constituent of biomass) is a quite complex material (in contrast to other materials like metals (Čivilytė et al., 2017); it is composed of biopolymers: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin – see Fig. 2. Cellulose is a polymer in partly amorphous and partly crystalline form, compiled in chains called fibrils from D-glucose subunits. Hemicellulose is a complex structure composed from pentose (xylose, arabinose) and hexose units (glucose, mannose, galactose). The main component of straw and grass hemicellulose is xylan. Hemicellulose from seed producing plants like conifers or ginkobiloba is built of glucomannan units (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009), (hardly ever considered for fermentation process due to specific extraction conditions). Glucomannan is difficult to hydrolyze as reported by (Tarabanko et al., 2017), who used sequential catalytic oxidation and an alkaline pretreatment method to obtain simple sugars like glucose from gymnosperms hemicellulose. Lignin is an amorphous, heteropolymer consisting of triphenylpropane units: p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinaphyl alcohols. There are also differences in structure of lignin (including substances inhibiting fermentation) in different plants – thus gymnosperms contains guiacyl, woody plants syringyl and guiacyl, while grasses also p-coumaryl alcohol. An attempt to find an optimum value of substrate (carbohydrates) composition was undertaken by (Grabber et al., 1997; Edwiges et al., 2018), i.e. 4%–8% of lignin, 16%–20% of cellulose and 3% and 7% of hemicelluloses was reported. Besides, Prochnow et al. (2009) discerned that in the case of Alpine grass the methane production is three times lower when the cut was performed in August than in March (stem elongation). Chiumenti et al. (2018) reported that from 1 kg of spring grass 33 L more methane can be obtain than from summer grass from riverbanks of Veneto. Most of the research work was devoted to study pretreatment methods for flowering plants which are more frequently used (wastes contain more of these plants) than for gymnosperms. According to (Rödl, 2018) a disadvantage of biomass is the higher ratio of oxygen to carbon than in fossil fuels making it a less efficient energy carrier. Chasnyk et al. (2015) analysed the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulose as part of fermentation technology developed across time. The system design should take into account: the most troublesome lignocellulose wastes in the region (Chodkowska-Miszczuk et al., 2019), characteristics of these wastes (von Cossel et al., 2018), potential methane or hydrogen yields (Arimi et al., 2015; Braguglia et al., 2018 ), potentially most profitable byproducts and their quantities (Villa Montoya et al., 2019; Sasaki et al., 2019), necessity of products valorization (Merzari et al., 2019), demand for the chemicals (Poggi-Varaldo et al., 2014) as well as public acceptance (Siddique and Wahid, 2018). Public acceptance depends on education degree or the process cleanness and odour control (Wysocka et al., 2019). For example, application of microaeration or microxydation helps not only to remove hydrogen sulphide (Krayzelova et al., 2015) but also enhances yield of process (Sołowski et al., 2018). System design of biogas plants should take into account legal framework and government policy (Cenian and Pietrzykowski, 2018). There are governments like Germany or Brazil that support biogas plant development (Lauer et al., 2020; Weiland, 2006; Freitas et al., 2019). In contrast Indonesia (Halimanjaya, 2019) or Australian governments (Alexander et al., 2019) are not especially supportive, making public society uninterested and investments seem not sufficiently profitable (Dybikowska and Graczyk, 2019). Although there are many attempts to solve problems of stable industrial-scale hydrogen-productivity, which include batch, semi-batch or semi-continuous reactor type (Elbeshbishy et al., 2017), the process is unstable and hydrogen production stops after some time (Taheri et al., 2018). Another problem is a rather low conversion of biomass to hydrogen (Kurtz et al., 2019). Michalopoulos et al. (2019) have reported promising results when fermenting food residues (however no detailed substrate description was given). As the rates and yields have been rather low (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017) it was proposed to combine various biohydrogen production methods (Sasaki et al., 2018). Yet another problem is finding the optimal inoculum preparation for efficient hydrogen production (Rafieenia et al., 2018). However, it was confirmed that some biogas plants (with acidic pretreatment) might be easily transformed(Cieślik et al., 2016) for efficient production of cheap hydrogen (Kozłowski et al., 2019). The scale up of hydrogen production from waste substrates will not only produce useful products in large quantities but it can also reduce landfill odour problems (Hirata, 2019; Rocha-Meneses et al., 2019). The analysis is supported by Table 2 . The separation of liquids originating from lignocellulose decomposition obliges the investigator or producer to apply advance HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) systems with a variety of sophisticated detectors (de Cassia Pereira et al., 2016). In contrast, separation of gaseous products like hydrogen and methane is less problematic (Castellari et al., 2001). However, even in this case one cannot efficiently detect either hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen using the same gas analyzer (Ikegami et al., 2008) and sensors (Templeton et al., 2012)."
4,Hydrogen production assessment,"3.2 Hydrogen production assessment Sołowski et al. (2019) calculated theoretical potential of hydrogen production from corn, and earlier from textile and wood wastes (Sołowski, 2016a, 2016b), which differs from economical (Narasu and Urbaniec, 2013) and technical potential (Claassen et al., 2009; Pradhan et al., 2016). It can be used when designing new systems. Hsu and Lin (2016) described a technological pathway for hydrogen production from wastewater. Nasr et al. (2013) models include hydrogen production profile over time using the Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) method. However (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2014, 2011), consideration did not provide an exact explanation of specificity of dark fermentation in Hyvolution model. The model presented in (Sołowski et al., 2019) is based on works (Woodward et al., 2000) and (Bartacek et al., 2007). The model takes into consideration diversity of lignocelluloses composition due to the kind, part and age of a plant. For example, in the case of different parts: wheat bran and wheat straw. Sołowski et al. (2019) assumed maximal theoretical yield of hydrogen by dark fermentation as 0.32 (from pentoses) – 0.33 (from hexoses) after (Bartacek et al., 2007). Theoretical yield of hydrogen production is calculated under the assumption that all substrate (hexose or pentose) is converted to hydrogen only with acetate pathway (eq. (1)), i.e. most efficient one. If e.g. butyrate pathway (2) is considered the theoretical yield falls to 0.18 (hexoses) or 0.17 (pentoses). 100% efficiency of hydrolysis is assumed in order to assess the upper limit of hydrogen production. Such a range is important in designing a process that would be profitable to use in industry in a given region. The model leads to eqs (5) and (6) (5) M H i j = [ f c j i Y t h M h e k H 2 M h e k + ( Y t h f h 6 j i M h e k H 2 M h e k + Y t p f h 5 j i M p e n H 2 M p e n ) ] m j i where M H i j - theoretical hydrogen production from waste part ‘j’ of plant ‘i’ [in mass u.]; the first term describes the hydrogen production from cellulose (biopolymer made of glucose), the second and third part describe the hydrogen production from hemicelluloses, i.e. from hexoses and pentoses, respectively); m ji - mass of waste part ‘j’ of plant ‘i’; f cji - fraction of cellulose in waste part ‘j’ of plant ‘i’; f hji - fraction of hemicellulose in waste part ‘j’ of plant ‘i’ = f h6ji + f h5ji ; f h6ji - fraction of hexoses in hemicellulose in lignocellulose; f h5ji - fraction of pentoses from hemicellulose in lignocellulose; Yth - theoretical hydrogen yield from hexoses: (glucose, fructose, lactose) via process (1) - 0.33 (Bartacek et al., 2007); Y tp - theoretical hydrogen yield from pentoses: (xylose, rhamnose) via reaction (4) - 0.32 (Pradhan et al., 2016); M hekH2 - partial molar mass of hydrogen in hexose - 12 g mol−1; M hek - molar mass of hexose - 180 g mol−1; M penH2 - partial molar mass of hydrogen in pentose – 10 g mol−1; M pen - molar mass of pentose – 150 g mol−1. The theoretical hydrogen production from plant ‘i’ can be obtained by summing over the waste parts ’j’ of plant ’i’. (6) M H i = ∑ j M H i j . If plant ‘i’ belongs to spermatophytes, subset of the land plants, then ‘j’ part includes: leaves, straw, seeds, flowers and roots (thus j = 1, …, 5). Here, for analysis only two ‘j’ parts (wheat straw and bran) were chosen. The results for 1 kg of substrates are presented in Table 3 . The fcji, fhij values are taken from (Sołowski et al., 2019)."
5,Methane production assessment,"3.3 Methane production assessment Methane production yield assessed using Buswell equation (7) takes into account that all hydrogen produced in acidogenesis is transformed to generate methane, hydrogen sulfide or ammonia (Achinas and Euverink, 2016) (7) C c H h O o N n S s + ( c — h 4 — o 2 + 3 4 n + 1 2 s ) H 2 O → ( c 2 — h 8 + o 4 + 3 8 n + 1 4 s ) C O 2 + ( c 2 + h 8 — o 4 — 3 8 n — 1 4 s ) C H 4 + n N H 3 + s H 2 S . In the case of lignocellulose, assuming that substrate for anaerobic digestion constitutes only polysaccharides (without lignin), n = s = 0, and the Buswell equation assumes the following form (8) C c H h O o + ( c — h 4 — o 2 ) H 2 O → ( c 2 — h 8 + o 4 ) C O 2 + ( c 2 + h 8 — o 4 ) C H 4 . Taking into account equations (1) and (8), under assumptions: no inoculum stressing, hydrogen produced and acetic acid is transformed into carbon dioxide and methane. As hydrolysis of polysaccharides gives only hexoses and pentoses, for glucose we obtain (9) C 6 H 12 O 6 + ( 6 — 12 4 — 6 2 ) H 2 O → ( 6 2 — 12 8 + 6 4 ) C O 2 + ( 6 2 + 12 8 — 6 4 ) C H 4 , (10) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 C O 2 + 3 C H 4 . Thus, we obtain for hexoses maximal theoretical yield of methane Y h = 0.5. For pentose from (4) and (7) one obtains (11) C 5 H 10 O 5 + ( 5 — 10 4 — 5 2 ) H 2 O → ( 5 2 — 10 8 + 5 4 ) C O 2 + ( 5 2 + 10 8 — 5 4 ) C H 4 , (12) C 5 H 10 O 5 → 2.5 C O 2 + 2.5 C H 4 . here, from pentose we obtain also theoretical yield Y p = 0.5. Thus, if we modify equation (5) putting instead Ytp and Yth, parameters of conversion of carbohydrate to methane Yh and Yp, methane theoretical potential from lignocellulosic waste. The f c j i , f h j i are the same as for calculation of hydrogen potential yield (13) M M i j = [ f c j i Y h M C H 4 M h e k + ( f h 6 j i Y h M C H 4 M h e k + f h 5 j i Y p M C H 4 M p e n ) ] m j i where M CH4 - molar mass of methane - 16 g mol−1; M hek - molar mass of hexose - 180 g mol−1; M pen - molar mass of pentose – 150 g mol−1. The theoretical potential of methane production from plant ‘i’ can be obtained by summing over the waste parts ’j’ of plant ’i’. (14) M M i = ∑ j M M i j . where f cji - fraction of cellulose in waste part ‘j’ of plant ‘i’; f hji - fraction of hemicellulose in waste part ‘j’ of plant ‘i’. Tables 3 and 4 present the evaluated theoretical potential of hydrogen and methane production from textile waste cotton, linen and wood wastes and corn waste-substrates. The textile wastes are potentially more efficient in hydrogen production (up to 21 g H2/kg substrate) than other substrates. Besides, looking at Table 1, one sees (as expected) that during anaerobic digestion we obtain more (in mass unit) methane than hydrogen. Therefore, to increase hydrogen yield one needs to combine dark fermentation with other methods of hydrogen production e.g. with photofermentation (Mishra et al., 2019) which are also applied to convert undigested carbohydrates (Liu et al., 2015)."
6,Chemical pretreatment,"The chemical pretreatment method is one of the four groups: physical, chemical, thermochemical and biological methods. Physical methods include reduction of particle size by comminuting (chopping, milling, grinding), irradiation with microwaves, γ-rays, spray drying and pyrolysis. The biological methods base on pretreatments that use different kind of fungi (white, brown, soft) enzymes degrading lignin (white-rot), hemicelluloses and cellulose (Ali et al., 2016) or bacteria (Nguyen et al., 2017). The chemical pretreatment includes: acidic, alkaline, oxidative, ionic-liquid and carbon-dioxide pretreatments (Zhang et al., 2018). Usually, there are two stages of pretreatment: (i) preparation with initial hydrolysis and (ii) hydrolysis of substrate to simple organic compounds. The second stage possesses chemical or enzymatic character. Choice of optimal chemical solvent must consider the following issues: price of solvent (Yin et al., 2019), choice of fermentative microorganisms (Andriani et al., 2014), efficiency of bacterial digestion (Tian et al., 2018), potential process inhibition (Salama et al., 2019), low amount and/or easily separable byproducts (Ren et al., 2018), low energy demand (ambient temperatures) (Sharma, 2019) and noncorrosive character (Lee et al., 2019). The hydrothermal pretreatment with dilute acid according to (Hashemi et al., 2019) increased methane production in the case of safflower straw 12 times. Much smaller effect was reported by Tian et al. (2016) for pretreatment of corn stover (straw). However, according to (Bundhoo et al., 2015; Bundhoo, 2019) lack of DF industrial-scale system makes pretreatment method optimization hardly possible, although there are some reports of continuous dark fermentation of whey (Pradhan et al., 2019; Romão et al., 2019). The thermochemical pretreatment includes methods like hydrothermal or carbon dioxide explosion that requires besides chemicals much heat (Volpe et al., 2018). Here we will focus on chemical pretreatment although selective and efficient pretreatment of lignocellulose for dark and methane fermentation may need a combination of various methods (e.g. thermal). Due to complexity of the problem, there are a series of papers dealing with pretreatment characteristics and results postponing the issue of their influence on the fermentation process. Such approach might be misleading, as it does not always take into account any fermentation process inhibition."
7,Oxidative pretreatment,"4.1 Oxidative pretreatment During oxidative (chemical agent) pretreatment oxidative agents like peroxides or alcohol acidic solutions are added to lignocellulose. Hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid are examples of chemicals used in this pretreatment method. The oxidative agents dissolve lignin and detach hemicellulose from cellulose leaving only undissolved crystalline cellulose (Guo et al., 2012). During oxidative pretreatment the following processes can occur: electrophilic substitution, displacement of side chains or cleavage of alkyl aryl (Hon and Shiraishi, 2001). Romero et al. (2015) reported that hydrogen peroxide improves enzymatic hydrolysis of rape straw and conversion to ethanol from 44.2% (1% H2O2, 30 min, 90 °C) to 77.2% (5% H2O2, 90 min, 90 °C). In this case, H2O2 partially dissolves lignin without influencing cellulose. As stated by Yu et al. (2019) hydroxide pretreatment of corn stover is more efficient than acidic one. Other oxidative agents used are: LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide (LiCl/DMAc), NaOH/urea, cadoxen (cadmium ethylenediamine solvent) and carboxy-methylcelluloses (CMCs). Ishii et al. (2008) proposed the addition of acetone before the main chemical agent to improve solubility of cellulose. As reported by Guo et al. (2012) the most important cleavage in the case of cellulose are breaking down intermolecular hydrogen bonds between OH-2 and O-6 (intermolecular bonds connecting two monomers of glucose in cellulose) so most solid acids cannot be used for lignocellulose hydrolyses. These two bonds stabilize all polymers and its breaking constitutes basis of cellulose depolymerization (Kondo, 1998). Another difficulty is that dissociation of the β-O-4 is rate-limited with the hydrolysis rate of hemicellulose being faster than that of cellulose (Tantayotai et al., 2019). Cashew-apple acidic-hydrolysis before dark fermentation was improved 3 times by addition of the 4.3% alkaline hydrogen peroxide solution (Silva et al., 2018). In the case of wheat straw, ozonolysis (45 min of the pretreatment before enzymatic hydrolysis),i.e. applying ozone to the substrate, improves hydrogen production by 158% (Wu et al., 2013). The methane yield from wheat straw was improved by applying ozonolysis; it decrease inhibitor content in the feed (Travaini et al., 2016). The disadvantage is that ozonolysis is very expensive as it requires huge volumes of ozone (Bundhoo, 2019). N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide is also a commonly used cellulose solvent before methane fermentation (Aslanzadeh et al., 2013; Jeihanipour et al., 2013b, 2010); it leads to a yield of 82% of the theoretical one. The challenge for the oxidative methods is their high prices when compare to acidic or basic ones, with not much higher efficiency of sacharifacation. Cheaper oxidants hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid do not have high enough efficiency. The most efficient, especially for AD, is pretreatment with N- Methylmorpholine N-oxide but it may be even 20 times more expensive than acidic/alkaline pretreatment. The oxidative methods are sometime used as additions to other ones."
8,Ion-liquid pretreatment,"4.2 Ion-liquid pretreatment The ion-liquid pretreatment helps to separate cellulose from lignocellulose by using ionic liquids, which later should be separated from the composition. These compounds (a group of organic salts) are characterized by melting points below 100 °C, high thermal stability and negligible vapor pressure. According to Zakrzewska et al. (2010) the most efficient solvents for lignocellulose pretreatment are: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride {[BMIM][Cl]}, 3-allyl-1-methylimidazolium chloride {[AMIM][Cl]}, 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazoliumacetate ([EMIM] [AC]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride {[BMIM][Cl]} and 3-allyl-1-methylimidazolium chloride {[AMIM][Cl]}. They solubilize cellulose above 10% wt at temperature in the range 50–100 °C. Swatloski et al. (2002) reported that the dissolution rate of cellulose can be increased to 25% wt under microwave irradiation. Using high dissolving pulp (DP = 1000) 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazoliumacetate ([EMIM][AC]) one can reach cellulose solubility up to 39% wt at temperature 105 °C (Zakrzewska et al., 2010). Mao et al. (2016) using 1-Butyl-3 methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [BMIM]HSO4 obtained solubility 75 % wt at temperature from 50 to 100 °C (Gyanashree and Jyotirekha, 2018) used 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydroxide BMIM[OH] at 100 °C to isolate lignin from pine wood and produced from it vanillin. Si et al. (2017) pointed out that high conversion (above 68%) of bamboo straw treated by {[BMIM][Cl]} was achieved when the ratio between bamboo and catalysis mass was ∼1:2. Wan et al. (2018) reported almost 100% reduction of sugars from cellulose pretreated using a mixture of ZnCl2, HCl and formic acid, so hydrolysis rate induced by application of ionic-liquid seems to be very high which enables efficient anaerobic and dark fermentation. Bakonyi et al. (2018) and Nemestóthy et al. (2018) reported that {[BMIM][Cl]} improves hydrolysis of beet pulp efficiently, both for methane and dark fermentation. Although costly the procedure enables high, up to 66%, hydrolysis of hemicelluloses that allows higher conversion of lignocellulose than others methods (Diaz et al., 2018). One of the significant disadvantages of ionic-liquids application in commercial scale systems is their high cost. On the other hand, Li et al. (2017) considered that they are much less corrosive in comparison to acids thus reducing equipment operating costs. Concluding, the method could be attractive (the best results were obtained for {[BMIM][Cl]}) if ionic liquids costs (with low volatility) will be reduced (Mancini et al., 2016) and high recyclability will be assured (Singer et al., 2018)."
9,Alkaline pretreatment,"4.3 Alkaline pretreatment Alkaline pretreatment, using e.g. KOH or NaOH, helps to separate hemicellulose and lignin from cellulose. Crystalline and amorphous structure of cellulose is modified and broken further due to saponification which supports hydrolysis (Guo et al., 2012). Celllulose density is decreased and thermodynamic stability improved (Pettersen, 1984). Lignin is dissolved via a process similar to pulping and recombination. Xylan can be extracted from cellulose by the KOH pretreatment under low temperature conditions (Hon and Shiraishi, 2001). Talha et al. (2018) used 0.25–6% NaOH pretreatment after ultrasound for efficient anaerobic digestion of sugar cane. The pretreatment of Ipomea Carnea using a 3%–5% solution of NaOH increases surface area of cellulose and hemicellulose fibers as well as helping it to remove lignin, both stimulating enzymatic cleavage of cellulose bond into sugars (Sharma et al., 2015). A 2% solution of NaOH enabled hydrolysis of cellulose from cattails waste at 76% (Zhang et al., 2010). The alkaline-oxidant mixture NaOH/urea/thiourea ∼8/8/6.5 used for hydrolysis of birch resulted in 95–98% decomposition of cellulose and up to 2% of hemicellulose (Kihlman et al., 2012). The method can be seen both as alkaline or oxidant one. Zhu et al. (2018) performed corn stover hydrolysis using ammonia 25% solution; more than 95% glucan and 85% xylan were released after stepwise pretreatment. A lime solution under 25 °C applied to poplar wood supports glucan hydrolysis (cellulose to glucose) 15 times more efficient than xylan (hemicellulose to xylose) (Sierra et al., 2011). Disadvantages of the method are the long duration of hydrolysis (Łukajtis et al., 2018), salt formation (Tian et al., 2018) and high cost of sodium hydroxide (Ghosh et al., 2018). High temperature might increase effects. The treatment using 2% solution of NaOH at 100 °C removed 41% lignin from aspen wood chopsticks. The enzymatic hydrolysate from pretreated chopsticks, was successfully demonstrated as a good substrate for fermentative H2 production (195 ml H2/total sugarconsumed) (Phummala et al., 2014). Combined hydrothermal and alkaline pretreatment (1 h at 180 °C and 2 M NaOH 3 days later) of safflower straw allow to obtain 137 ml CH4/gVSS; higher than untreated 11,7 ml CH4/g VSS (Hashemi et al., 2019). Sodium hydroxide is an efficient agent for biogas production from lignocellulose waste of high total solid content i.e. more than 80%, like wood (Sun et al., 2019), cotton (Jeihanipour et al., 2013a) or asparagus (Panagiotopoulos et al., 2013). Moreover, Yu et al. (2019) pointed out that in the case of anaerobic digestion NaOH is more toxic and less efficient than KOH. The alkali method can also be used for utilization of substrates like cotton stalk (Li et al., 2018) that are not hydrolyzed well using acid. Therefore methods of alkaline pretreatment can be developed for types of lignocellulose waste that cannot be degradable using acids."
10,Acid pretreatment,"4.4 Acid pretreatment The oldest (already applied in XIX century) method of lignocellulose hydrolysis based on applying inorganic acid hydrolysis also called direct hydrolysis (Grous et al., 1986; Torget et al., 1990). The acid pretreatment can be performed using concentrated or diluted strong acids like nitric, hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. Diluted acids suitable for hydrolysis of lignocellulose include also organic acids (e.g. maleic acid). The concentrated acids cleave the glycosidic bond in cellulose structure. At a temperature range from 20 to 50 °C complete solubilization of cellulose can be observed under atmospheric pressure, using hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid at concentrations above 39% and above 72%, respectively (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009). Acid pretreatment decomposes hemicellulose to xylan or glucomannan, which is acid stable. As stated by Xiao and Clarkson (1997), lignin (even sourced from newspaper) under acid treatment, especially using a mixture of 35% of acetic and 2% nitric acid, is quickly solubilized (in 80%). The disadvantage of strong acid pretreatment is corrosive activity of acids and the appearance of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) or furfural compounds useless in ethanol fermentation (and inhibiting anaerobic one) (Bolado-Rodríguez et al., 2016). When diluted acids are used, HMF or furfural do not occur, making the pretreatment method feasible for ethanol fermentation (de Mes et al., 2003; Wyman et al., 2005). The anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation are more resistant to the presence of HMF or furfural. Diluted acids reconstruct the structure and spatial orientation of cellulose. Hemicellulose is hydrolyzed faster than cellulose. Diluted acid hydrolysis can be a two-staged process which includes 50% hydrolysis of cellulose at 180 °C and hydrolysis of rest of cellulose under 200 °C (Guo et al., 2012). Pressure should be kept in the range from 1.2 to 1.3 MPa. The advantage of acid pretreatment is improved solubility of lignin and hemicellulose which shields cellulose in easy to precipitate form (Liu and Wyman, 2003). High concentration sulfuric acid like 72% are used not only in the procedure enabling determination of carbohydrates in biomass (Sluiter et al., 2008) but also in hydrolysis of miscanthus (Kalinoski et al., 2017). However, its application requires a much more durable set-up due to fuming of acid during hydrolysis especially at higher temperatures (Sasaki et al., 2019). The process of cellulose acidic-hydrolysis is a multistage one, from cellulose to hydrolyzed cellulose, resembling starches, dextrines, oligosaccharides and finally to D-glucose (Guo et al., 2012). Reported by Teixeira et al. (1999), hydrolysis of cellulose from a mixture of poplar and sugar cane bagasse was increased from 8% to 98% by addition of 21% peracetic acid to the process. Similar results to strong acid pretreatment without inhibiting by-product can be obtained using maleic acid. In agreement with (Kootstra et al., 2009) diluted maleic acid pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis converts up to 90% of xylan to monomeric xylose, and 90% glucan into glucose from solids (present in wheat straw). Cabrera et al. (2015) showed that soybean straw treated using 4% sulfuric acid under 121 °C for 1 h was converted (93.9%) to reducing sugars; the conversion degree higher than the 86.5% was obtained for treatment with 0.5% NaOH (30 °C, 48h). The 4% sulfuric acid solution was also useful (similar conversion degree) to prepare wheat straw (Lopez-Hidalgo et al., 2017). Schneider et al. (2017) obtained conversion up to 45.7% for hemicellulose and cellulose from barley straw using sulfuric acid in mechanocatalytical pretreatment by K2S2O7. Guerrero and Ballesteros (2017) reported that diluted sulfuric acid applied after steam explosion is suitable for banana residue hydrolysis; pseudo-steam (at 171 °C) interaction for time 5 min and 2.2% H2SO4 led to 91% glucose yield. For banana rachis, interaction with steam at 198 °C for time 5 min and 1.5% H2SO4 resulted in 87.1% glucose yield. Hoon et al. (2017) performed hydrolysis of palm fronds using acidic/base solution of HCl–NaOH in ratio HCl to NaOH 4:1 and obtained 81.5% of lignocellulose enzymatic digestibility of dry fronds and ∼100% hemicellulose. This should be compared to acidic pretreatment results: hemicellulose conversion degree 93.5% and lignocellulose conversion 60.4%. Liu et al. (2013) used 55% sulfuric acid to hydrolyze rice straw and prepare it for dark fermentation; concentrated acid completely dissolved cellulose at 40 °C, the maximum hydrogen yield was 0.44 mol H2/mol T-sugar at substrate utilization of 81.6% in batch mode (initial pH 7.0, 37 °C). The diluted sulfuric acid (2% concentration) solubilized cellulose and lignin undissolved during hydrogen-peroxide pretreatment which improves ethanol yield to 14.3g ethanol from 100g of rape straw (Romero et al., 2015); while for dark fermentation of empty fruit bunch of oil palm 6% H2SO4 was efficient (Gonzales et al., 2019). Patel et al. (2015) used a 1% solution of sulfuric acid with steam explosion for wheat straw hydrolysis before dark fermentation. The sulfuric acid pretreatment is both common (known from XIX century), very efficient and considered cheap (although Table 5 seems not confirming it). The carbon dioxide pretreatment can be considered as some kind of acidic pretreatment. It proceeds under high temperature (200 °C) for several minutes. This leads to hydrolysis of hemicellulose at acidic conditions. Under such conditions carbonic acid can be formed which is considered to improve the degree of enzymatic hydrolysis even up to 75% (Sun and Cheng, 2002). Carbon dioxide (at 35 °C and pressure 73 bar) increased glucose yield from cellulose to 70% (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009). In the case of coconut, acid pretreatment using HCl (pH 1.0) fully decrystallizes the cellulose (Xiong et al., 2017) making it more digestible for microorganisms as well as accessible for fermentation organisms. Tian et al. (2018, 2016) compared diluted acetic, phosphoric and sulfuric acid for anaerobic digestion. Yu et al. (2019) and Chai et al. (2016) reported that phosphoric acid improves buffering capacity. The acidic pretreatment is the most commonly used method due to relatively low cost and high efficiency. Lee et al. (2019) used a solution of hexane and methanol followed up by 6% sulfuric acid pretreatment to obtain methane as well as FAME (Fatty-Acids Methyl Esters) or other biofuels and lubricants (Martín and Grossmann, 2014) - relevant additives for biobutanol (Likozar and Levec, 2014), bioethanol (Guo et al., 2015) or biodiesel (Vasudevan and Fu, 2010). Oleskowicz-Popiel et al. (2008) applied wet-oxidation pretreatment and obtained yield equal to 30.8 g of ethanol from 100g of dry matter maize silage (Zhang et al., 2013) used a buffer solution of sodium citrate with 0.02% of NaN3 (pH5.0) for hemp straw and obtained a conversion to sugar equal 60% for cellulose and 52% for hemicellulose. Guo et al. (2012) proposed the solid acid catalyst pretreatment of lignocellulose. The solid acids catalyst like H-form zeolites, transition metal oxides and cations change resins catalyze decomposition of lignocellulose better than ionic liquids due to: activity, selectivity, catalyst life and ease in recovery and reuse. Saline water can be also used for hydrolysis of Champaca Wood: however, this process is much slower (Sangian et al., 2018). The general route of lignocellulose pretreatment is illustrated in Fig. 3 above. According to Millett et al. (1979) the most efficient way of pretreatment of woody (red oak, fir) lignocellulose is a combination of milling (vibratory milling) with enzymatic hydrolysis or diluted acid (0.1 M H2SO4). This milling can proceed 1h or even 48h in the case of vibratory milling. The pretreatment results in hemicellulose converted into soluble sugars and lignin soluble in H2O2 or ammonia (Sun and Cheng, 2005). The disadvantages of this method is danger of corrosion (Tian et al., 2018) and environmental pollution (Venturin et al., 2018). Schneider et al. (2017, 2016) applied oxalic acid to avoid HMF formation during hydrolysis of barley straw. The Table 5 shows the price of chemical agents according to Sigma Aldrich site (on 20th September’19). Łukajtis et al. (2018) considered alkaline pretreatment as expensive methods, nowadays is even cheaper than acidic. Oxidants beside hydrogen peroxide, peroxide acetate are much more expensive than acidic but usually cheaper than ionic liquids. The acidic pretreatment although more costly than alkaline leads to higher efficiency of fermentation process. The detailed effects of pretreatment methods on dark fermentation or anaerobic digestion are discussed in Table 6 ."
11,Comparison with other pretreatment methods supplementary to chemical one,"The mechanical pretreatment of cellulose includes milling, which decreases crystallinity, particle size (Palmowsky and Muller, 1999) and degree of polymerization (Rodriguez et al., 2017). Tsapekos et al., (2018) reported that the stable coarse shell milling using 400 rpm is optimal for size reduction of cellulose for methane production. Milling reduces digestion time of lignocellulose from 23 to 59% by increasing hydrolysis rate (depending on milling duration, biomass kind and milling process). Lignocellulose size from 0.2 to 2 mm is the most suitable for high efficiency of cellulose and hemicellulose to sugars conversion; it improves anaerobic digestion (Fagbohungbe et al., 2019) and dark fermentation (Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). Milling of lignocellulose increases the hydrolysis rate and improves hydrolysis yield from 5% to 25% (Motte et al., 2015). Separation of milled products (e.g. cellulose and cotton linters) can be performed by mechanical agitation on a screened pan (Millett et al., 1979). Milling (in some cases accompanied by white-rot funghi pretreatment - Wyman et al., 2018) is usually the first step before chemical or physical pretreatment e.g. sonical (Rafieenia et al., 2018a). Lignocellulose hydrolysis is limited by crystallinity, degree of polymerization, moisture content, surface area and particle size (above 40 mesh) (Chang and Holtzapple, 2000). According to Zhang and Lynd (2004) lower crystallinity of cellulose leads to higher conversion of cellulose to sugars. Hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose leads to a mixture of glucose and xylose. Hendriks and Zeeman (2009) pointed out that the probability of cellulose hydrolysis increases if hemicellulose is separated from lignocellulose. Additionally optimal diameter of substrate can increase. Table 5 with Table 6 are a summary of the 4th discussion. There are many chemical methods of pretreatment that dissolve partially with low inhibitory rate. But the high prices indicated in Table 5 show that oxidants and ionic liquid do not give so much advantage in efficiency on basic or acidic methods to overcome industrial viability for both processes. Only if lignocellulose pretreatments yield some valuable bi-products, for example for medicinal applications, besides hydrogen or methane, will the oxidants and ionic liquid be worth using in production of such common product like biofuels. Therefore if competitive reagents are stable in price, acidic and basic methods of pretreatment would be developed more. Therefore most articles/patents will probably be using more acids than bases in case of dark fermentation, while in anaerobic digestion more bases than acids will be used for dissolving cellulose. The microwave (mw) pretreatment works by irradiation of lignocellulose in the power range 300–700 [W]. The induction time for cellulose is longer than in the case of hemicellulose or lignin (Piepenschneider et al., 2016). The mw pretreatment may accompany other types of pretreatment like: alkali, acid or ionic-liquid pretreatment. The microwave radiation reduces crystallinity by vaporization of intra-water and improves efficiency of hydrolysis. The combined mw and alkaline (NaOH) pretreatment of wheat straw results in up to 56% hydrolysis of cellulose (Xu et al., 2011). Liu and Cheng (2010) improved sulfuric-acid (0.3 N) pretreatment of corn stover by using microwave irradiation (700 W) for 15 min four times. Aylin Alagöz et al. (2018) applied 1450 W mw irradiation for 10 min before anaerobic digestions of olive and winery wastes. The ultrasonic pretreatment applying sonication in the range 20–40 kHz can be used to support ionic-liquid pretreatment of lignocellulose. The ultrasonic waves break hydrogen bonding in lignocellulose and induce bubbling of water located inside it. The biomass is rapidly expanded and contracted (Guo et al., 2012). Aylin Alagöz et al. (2018) uses this method for anaerobic digestion of olive wastes pretreatment with 20 kHz and a maximum power 400 W for 30s. Ionic liquid with support of AFEX method improved fermentation of agave wastes. In the AFEX method ammonia explosion is used e.g. before agave (Perez-Pimienta et al., 2016) and miscanthus dark fermentation (Balan et al., 2009). It resulted in the conversion of lignocellulose to xylan (62.4%) and 25% delignification which improves both DF and AD. The AFEX method requires much energy and leads to higher losses of volatile compounds that digesting could otherwise lead to higher fermentation yields. Thermal or hydrothermal pretreatment proceeds by temperature increase, usually in the range from 150 to 180 °C. There are several types of thermal pretreatment: steam explosion, steam and liquid hot-water pretreatment. The processes are carried out in an autoclave. During heating of lignocellulose, first the hemicellulose becomes soluble at temperature above 150 °C. Xylan is less thermally stable than glucomannan. The solubilization of hemicellulose depends on temperature, pH and moisture contents. At temperatures above 180 °C decomposition of hemicellulose is exothermal and lignin is dissolved. The lignin solubilization depends on pH and lignin precursor. Thermal treatment of lignocellulose can lead to production of lignin derivatives, like vanillin, vanillin alcohol, furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) that can inhibit hydrolysis especially under acidic conditions (Huang et al., 2019). In the liquid hot water method, hot water replaces steam (Lawther et al., 1996). Liquid hot water should firstly solubilize hemicellulose to unlock cellulose. Hot water treatment at pH values in the range 4.0–7.0 prevents formation of acids, like furfural, inhibiting hydrolysis (Liu and Wyman, 2003). Xylan can be extracted from cellulose in acidic and alkaline solutions. Glucomannan can be extracted only in a strong alkaline solution(Li et al., 2014). Hot water treatment increases enzyme activity 2 to 5 times (Weil et al., 1998). In the case of safflower straw hot water treatment enables formation of monosaccharides (Hashemi et al., 2019). Walker et al. (2018) investigated steam explosion for wheat straw, corn stover, miscanthus and willow in a pilot installation using Taguchi methodology without producing inhibitors. They attained a yield up to 94% release of initial xylose into hydrolysates under condition of steam-explosion parameters 12 bar, 3 min, 1.2% phosphoric acid for 500g of substrate. The steam explosion requires a high quality stainless-steel vessel that can endure high pressure and temperature. During the steam explosion process biomass is rapidly boiled in water under high pressure. After biomass heating, a rapid decompression takes place inducing breaks of lignocellulosic fibers. Hendriks and Zeeman (2009) investigated the impact of steam explosion treatment on the overall process. Steam causes decomposition of hemicellulose and formation of acids that catalyzed hydrolysis process (Guerrero and Ballesteros, 2017; (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009). According to (Overend et al., 1987) severity of pretreatment can be determined by severity factor log(Wo) (15) log ( W o ) = l o g [ t ⋅ e ( T − 100 ) / 14.75 ] , where: t – time in minutes, T - temperature in Celsius. Low pressure (2 bar/120 °C) can lengthen time of steam treatment to 300 min. High moisture content of biomass extends time of steam pretreatment (Shi et al., 2019). Limitations of the eq. (15) are the lack of feedstock moisture-content and particle size that strongly influence the kinetics of steam explosion processes i.e. chemical and physical changes of the biomass. Especially high moisture contents of feedstock have been shown to slow down the kinetics since the voids in the biomass are filled with condensate before the steam temperature is reached (Lam et al., 2011). The severity factor was used also to determine degree of cellulose crystallinity (Song et al., 2019). The steam explosion method is used also in combination with other pretreatments including chemical for AD (Pellera and Gidarakos, 2018) and DF (Argun and Onaran, 2018). Gonzales et al. (2019) provided extension of eq. (15) for the case of combined steam explosion with diluted acid pretreatment (16) log ( W o ) = l o g [ t ⋅ e ( T − 100 ) / 14.75 ] − p H The chemical pretreatment does not require such high temperatures and energy input of mechanical/thermal ones (Rabemanolontsoa and Saka, 2016). Other disadvantages of thermal method compared to chemical ones are higher losses of the volatile parts of carbohydrate used in fermentation. Therefore, chemical pretreatment of lignocellulose can achieve higher efficiency of methane/hydrogen production."
12,Conditions relevant for efficient anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation,"The conditions for efficient dark fermentation, suitable for industrial scale, are not yet known but some clues can be formulated for improving the process (Rezania et al., 2017; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017). According to (Detman et al., 2018), hydrogen production slows down in the presence of lignin or yeasts. The cellulose should have low or non crystallinity with low porosity (Lay, 2001). More amorphous substrate is more easily digested by enzymes and bacteria (Seelert et al., 2015). It was found that low porosity enhances hydrolysis (Ghosh et al., 2018). In relation to acidity, some materials like empty fruit bunch of palm oil need a pH of 5.0 for dark fermentation (Hussy et al., 2003), while for cotton stalk hydrolysate a pH of 8.0 (72 ml H2/g substrate) (Li et al., 2018). Generally it is considered that the optimal pH for different lignocellulose wastes is in the range 5.0–6.0 (Gonzales et al., 2019). The optimal temperature for dark fermentation is usually mesophilic, i.e. between 33 and 43 °C, but Patel et al. (2015) argue that the optimal conditions are a pH of 8.5 and 37 °C after acidic pretreatment (0.157 ml H2/g substrate). Liu et al. (2013) for DF of rice straw applied pH 7.0 after 55% sulfuric acid pretreatment achieving 0.02 ml H2/g substrate which is far below that for the same substrate in the experiment of (Chang et al., 2011) for pH 6.5 at 37 °C after using dilute HCl acid pretreatment. Higher efficiency of dark fermentation (168.4 ml H2/g VSS) is obtained(Nasirian et al., 2011) after wheat straw hydrolyses using 2% sulfuric acid at pH 2.0 and temperature 37 °C. Lopez-Hidalgo et al. (2017) obtained high efficiency of dark fermentation from wheat straw hydrolysate 18 ml H2/dm−3 h−1 TRS (total reducing sugars) at pH 8.2 and T = 31 °C (psychrophilic conditions) by combined mechanical and dilute acidic condition. According to (Shobana et al., 2017) formation of inhibitors of dark fermentation (like HMF) cannot be completely avoided in any pretreatment of algae, especially in thermoacidic pretreatment. Cao et al. (2010) reported that inhibiting substances for corn stover fermentation are furfural above 1 g/L, HMF above 1 g/L, sodium acetate above 6 g/L, vanillin above 2 g/L, syringaldehyde above 1 g/L and levulinic acid above 5 g/L. As stated by Muñoz-Páez et al. (2018) furfural does not inhibit process in contrast to HMF in concentration above 0.1–1.0 g/L for xylose fermentation. Microelements such as Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni enhance hydrogen production (Keskin et al., 2018), while Co, W and Al inhibits dark fermentation of vegetable wastes (Wang and Wan, 2008). The size reduction of substrate pieces (e.g. grass or straw) should be performed so far in order to allow good penetration of chemical solution (during pretreatment) or of bacterial inoculum – during methane (Prochnow et al., 2009) or dark fermentation (Mañunga et al., 2019). Prochnow et al. (2009) observed higher methane production for 10 mm than for 5 mm or 20 mm lengths. In the case of poplar wood the proper mesh size is between 0.18 mm and 0.85 mm (Studer et al., 2010). El et al. (2018) used 6% HCl solution for preatreatment of grape pomace before anaerobic digestion and obtained conversion of lignocellulose 39% and conversion of cellulose 71%; methane production 0.1352 Nm3 CH4 per 1 kg COD was reported. In accordance with (Tian et al., 2018, 2016) the highest efficiency of methane yield from corn stover was with sulfuric acid (2%) 51.12 ml CH4/g TS straw, with phosphoric acid (6%) 44.33 ml CH4/g TS straw and acetic acid 4% 41.69 ml CH4/g TS straw. Zema (2017) developed a model for designing profitable AD substrate-mixture taking into account substrate availability. In the considered case the optimal AD substrate (waste mixture) was 12% of olive, 39% of citrus and 49% of livestock residues. According to (Mao et al., 2019), optimal conditions for methane fermentation of corn straw are a total solid content of 4% and a pH 7.5. Dandikas et al. (2018) proposed a technology for anaerobic digestion of various grasses. Edwiges et al. (2018) prepared a more detailed model for Brazil indicating the optimal substrate composition for every month. According to the model, optimal (for high methane production) content of carbohydrates in wastes are 4–8% of lignin, 16–20% of cellulose and 3–7% of hemicellulose. For sugar cane the highest (39%) increase of methane yield was achieved with alkaline pretreatment of 6% NaOH solution (Talha et al., 2018), as compared to AD without pretreatment. Sambusiti et al. (2012) reported a high methane production from sorghum forage and wheat straw after 10% g NaOH/gTS pretreatment, i.e. 0.345 and 0.289 LCH4/gVSS, respectively. Kaparaju et al. (2009) studied methane production from wheat straw after NaOH pretreatment. It was found that the optimal conditions were a substrate load up to 21.9 g VS/L, thermophilic process at 55 °C, dilution 50% and pH value 5.0. The summary of systems characteristics suitable for AD and DF is showed in Table 7 ."
13,Conclusions,"This paper presents state-of-art methods and development in the field of lignocellulose fermentation and its pretreatment. Lignocellulose is generally a much poorer energy carrier than fossil fuels due to a higher oxygen to carbon ratio, therefore the main role of applied technologies like anaerobic digestion or dark fermentation is to reduce this ratio in the derived fuels (methane or hydrogen). The paper presents theoretical models of methane and hydrogen yields. It was found that for efficient hydrogen production, a combination of dark fermentation with other methods of H2-production (which enable transformation of acetic and butyric acid to hydrogen) is required. The main reason for applying pretreatment is the decomposition (decrystallization) of cellulose and hemicellulose and cleavage of polymers into monomers, which may be easily digested by bacteria in fermentation processes. At current price levels the cheapest methods are the basic and acidic pretreatments. Acidic pretreatment is very efficient (especially using sulfuric acids), solubilizing up to 80% of lignocellulose, and at reasonable cost, but strong acids are producing inhibitors and are highly corrosive. Development of lignocellulose hydrolysis includes design of methods that will not be strongly corrosive to the equipment used. Alkaline pretreatment is a competitive method to the acidic one especially for some rigid materials that acid cannot solubilize (its efficiency exceed even 80%) but can lead to environmental (water) pollution. Oxidative pretreatments are usually expensive but can support the sacharisation process by alkaline or acidic methods, in the case of NMMO efficiency reaching 82%. Ion-liquid pretreatment is selective (almost 100% sacharisation) but very expensive, especially for hydrogen production. The last methods can be profitable when some valuable by-products results. An efficient chemical pretreatment should be preceded by physical comminution e.g. mechanical being the cheapest one. Physical comminution should avoid losses e.g. volatile compound generation that lowers efficiency of fermentation. Finally, the authors are convinced that combined pretreatment methods are more effective as compared to single ones and there is a multitude of combinations which should be investigated in the future. These considerations should also include economic aspects of the proposed technologies i.e. pretreatment method costs, recovery of valuable chemicals (e.g. ionic-liquids) as well as possible acquiring of valuable by-products. As was already pointed out, future works on pretreatment methods should put more emphasis on investigation of possible fermentation process inhibition and environmentally benign operation (e.g. avoiding water and environmental pollution)."
