0,Introduction,"Hydrogen gas (H2) has been expected as a clean energy resource in next generation. In particular, solar hydrogen production via water splitting and alcohol reforming with semiconductor photocatalysts has been intensely studied [1–23]. This hydrogen production process is promising for on-demand reforming of various fuels, which will realize instantaneous hydrogen production with the aid of sunlight and will provide portable power sources in our future daily life. Moreover, further development of photocatalytic H2 production is quite important for establishing safe use of hydrogen and hydrogen systems, because the on-demand reforming can prevent difficulties in hydrogen storage and transportation. However, photocatalytic H2 production usually generates byproduct gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen simultaneously and the generated H2 should be purified for practical uses from fuels for fuel cells to process gases for semiconductor manufacturing. This concern is not limited to photocatalytic H2 production. Namely, all conventional H2 production systems based on steam reforming [24], partial oxidation reforming [25], and water electrolysis [26] are equipped with both hydrogen production and purification parts. This problem has limited the miniaturization of H2 production systems and the further development of on-site reformers toward realizing mobile application of hydrogen energy. With this background, we recently reported a photoactive hydrogen production/separation membrane which has a bilayer structure comprised by an anodized titanium dioxide nanotube array (TNA) [27–37] and a palladium hydrogen permeable film [38–41] (TNA/Pd membrane) as shown in Fig. 1 [42]. In the previous work, the TNA/Pd membrane was fabricated by transferring an anodized TNA embedded in a titanium foil onto a sputtered palladium film, and the UV-induced production of high-purity hydrogen from pure alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol) with the TNA/Pd membrane was demonstrated at room temperature. However, the preparation of 10-μm-thick Pd film by physical vapor deposition methods such as sputtering and electron-beam deposition was quite costly and time-consuming. From the viewpoint of scarcity of resources such as noble metals, another cost-effective deposition method should be introduced. In our present article, an electroless plating process [43–46] was employed for fabricating a high-quality interface between a palladium film and an anodized TNA. Then, the evaluation of the structures and the H2 production rate in the TNA/Pd membrane fabricated by all electrochemical processes was performed. In this work, a pinhole-free, ultrathin TNA/Pd membrane with a thickness of a few micrometers was obtained with the aid of electroless plating. The basic properties of the TNA/Pd membrane on photo-induced high-purity H2 production were also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation and characterization of the TNA/Pd membrane,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of the TNA/Pd membrane The TNA/Pd membrane was fabricated according to the process described hereinafter. A titanium foil (100μm thick, 99.6% purity, Japan Metal Service) was degreased by sonication in acetone. A TNA was formed by anodizing the Ti foil in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with titanium as anode and platinum as cathode, with a constant voltage across the electrodes. A 4:1 mixture of glycerol (99.0% purity, Nacalai Tesque) and highly-pure water (18.2MΩcm) containing 0.5wt% NH4F (Special Grade, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was used as electrolyte. After the anodization at 50V for 10h, the foil was annealed at 500°C in air for 2h for crystallization. After the post-annealing of the anodized Ti foil, the TNA was coated with a Pd film via electroless plating. Firstly, Pd nanoparticle cores at which the growth of an electroless-plated Pd film was initiated were formed on the aperture of the TNA by photodeposition. The photodeposition was carried out under UV irradiation for 10min, in a mixed solution which included 1ml of palladium standard solution (1000ppm, Nacalai Tesque), 3ml of ethanol (99.5%, Nacalai Tesque), and 50ml of pure water. After the photodeposition process, the TNA was immersed in an electroless plating solution (Palla Top N bath, Okuno Chemical Industries) at 60°C for 30min. After that, the Pd-coated TNA was annealed at 500°C for 5h under N2 atmosphere. For comparison, another TNA/Pd membrane with a 10-μm-thick sputter-deposited Pd layer was also prepared by RF magnetron sputtering. Here, the TNA used for sputter-deposition was anodized at 50V for 10h in the electrolyte which was 9:1 mixture of glycerol and highly-pure water containing 0.5wt% NH4F. A pure Pd target (99.9% purity, Furuya Metal) was used as the sputtering source. The sample temperature was kept at 400°C for 4h during the Pd sputter deposition. Finally, the Pd films were mechanically peeled off from the TNA surface for completing the TNA/Pd membranes. The surface and interface morphologies of the anodized Ti foils and the TNA/Pd membranes were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; S4500, Hitachi) with an acceleration voltage of 5kV. The phase structure and the elemental chemical status of the TNA/Pd membranes were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD; SmartLab, Rigaku) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; JPS-9010TR, JEOL), respectively."
3,Measurement of photo-induced H2 production/separation with the TNA/Pd membrane,"2.2 Measurement of photo-induced H2 production/separation with the TNA/Pd membrane Hydrogen production from methanol photodecomposition and concomitant hydrogen separation in the TNA/Pd membrane were examined with a home-made high vacuum cell as shown in Fig. 2(a). The cell has two chambers connected to a turbo-molecular pump and spatially separated by the membrane specimen. Hereafter, we call the upper chamber “chamber A” and the lower one “chamber B” for convenience. In order to mount the TNA/Pd membrane in the vacuum cell, the membrane was glued on a Ti sheet (100μm thick, 3cm×3cm) with a 1.5-cm-diameter aperture by using Torr seal epoxy resin. After sufficient evacuation of both the chambers A and B to 1.0×10−4 Pa with the turbo-molecular pump, the evacuation of the chamber A was stopped and methanol vapors were introduced into the chamber A until the TNA surface of the membrane became fully covered with a methanol droplet. This reactant methanol was stored in a glass flask and evacuated in advance with a rotary pump for a certain time to get rid of air and other unnecessary gases sufficiently. Then, the membrane specimen was illuminated through a quartz window with a Xe lamp (LAX-101, Asahi Spectra). Generated gases filtered through the TNA/Pd membrane were detected at a real-time scale by a six-channel quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS, Vacscan/Spectra) installed for detecting residual gases inside the chamber B. The incident light was filtered with a band-pass filter between 300 and 400nm, and the intensity was set to be 30mW/cm2 on the TNA surface. All the measurements were performed at room temperature."
4,Measurement of the amount of photo-induced H2 production with the TNA/Pd membrane,"2.3 Measurement of the amount of photo-induced H2 production with the TNA/Pd membrane The amount of hydrogen gas produced with the TNA/Pd membrane was measured under atmospheric pressure by using a gas chromatograph (GC; GC-8A, Shimadzu) equipped with a packed column (ShinCarbon ST), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a gas sampler (MGS-4, Shimadzu). Fig. 2(b) shows a schematic view of the experimental system, where the above-described measurement cell was connected to GC via the gas sampler. Before the measurement, both the chambers A and B and gas lines for circulating and storing the produced hydrogen were evacuated with the turbo-molecular pump and filled with N2 gas until atmospheric pressure was attained. Then, the mixture of pure water and methanol with a mixing ratio of 1:1 (in volume) was introduced into the chamber A until the TNA surface of the membrane became fully covered with a droplet. Generated gases filtered through the TNA/Pd membrane under UV illumination from the Xe lamp were stored and circulated continuously by using an air pump (APN-051, Iwaki Co.) and N2 as carrier gas, with a flow rate of 100ml/min. One millilitre of the stored gas was analyzed with GC on line by employing the gas sampler. The GC response was calibrated by injecting known amounts of pure H2 gas (99.99% Purity) into the GC system beforehand. Pure argon gas (99.99% Purity) was used as carrier gas for TCD in GC. All the measurements were performed at room temperature."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structures of the TNA/Pd membrane,"3.1 Structures of the TNA/Pd membrane SEM images of anodized Ti foils, represented in Fig. 3 , clearly show that the TNA with 5μm length and 100–200nm pore size was formed under anodizing in the 4:1 mixture electrolyte (Figs. 3(a) and (b)). Here, the TNA anodized in the 9:1 mixture electrolyte had 5μm length and 100nm pore size (only top view of TNA surface was shown in Fig. 3(c)). In this study, the two different TNAs with the same length were utilized for preparing TNA/Pd membranes. We confirmed that the difference of 100nm in pore size did not give any influence to the fabrication yield of the TNA/Pd membrane regardless of the deposition method of Pd. Digital camera images of the TNA/Pd membrane prepared by Pd electroless plating, which was glued on a Ti sheet with a 1.5-cm-diameter aperture by using Torr seal epoxy resin, are shown in Fig. 4 . The image of the top side of the membrane (Fig. 4(a)) shows a black surface where the titania nanotubes exist. The bottom side of the membrane shows a metallic surface as shown in Fig. 4(b), indicating that a dense Pd layer was uniformly formed in a 1.5-cm-diameter area. Although small contrast variation can be observed inside the membrane region in Figs. 4(a) and (b), these photographic images suggest that the TNA was transferred uniformly onto the electroless-plated Pd layer. Actually, the SEM top-view image of the membrane (Fig. 4(c)) clearly reveals that the TiO2 nanotubes with open apertures are standing on the palladium. Moreover, the SEM bottom-view image of the membrane (Fig. 4(d)) shows that the electroless-plated Pd layer has a smooth surface. This feature of the Pd layer was also previously reported for defect-free self-supported Pd membranes [41]. Fig. 5 gives SEM images of the TNA/Pd membrane in cross-sectional view. The interface between the TNA and the Pd regions can be clearly distinguished as indicated with a dashed line in Fig. 5(a). The average length of TiO2 nanotubes on the Pd layer is about 1μm, which is much smaller than that on the Ti foil as we can see in Fig. 3(b). This phenomenon is due to the mechanical peel-off process utilized for fabricating the TNA/Pd membrane, which made the TNA cracked at some defect sites on tubular surfaces and reduced the length of the TNA, as we reported previously [42]. However, Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that TiO2 nanotubes with opened pores were well-aligned on the surface of 2-μm-thick electroless-plated Pd layer with no vacancy. Thus, a bilayer structure of the TNA and the Pd layer was fabricated by employing solely electrochemical processes such as anodizing and electroless plating. It also should be noted that this 3-μm-thick TNA/Pd membrane has the supreme mechanical robustness, because the degree of vacuum in the chamber B was maintained to be 1.0×10−4 Pa even after the introduction of methanol into the chamber A, as explained in Section 2. The XRD pattern of the TNA/Pd membrane with the electroless-plated Pd was measured using Cu Kα radiation. In the measured XRD pattern (Fig. 6 ), the TiO2 anatase peaks (PDF 01-071-1168: 2θ =25.21°, 37.53°, 47.87°, 53.53°, 54.86° and 62.36° for {101}, {004}, {200}, {105}, {211} and {204}, respectively) and pure Pd peaks (PDF 00-005-0681: 2θ =40.11°, 46.66°, 68.08°, 82.09° and 86.60° for {111}, {200}, {220}, {311} and {222}) are clearly observed. The XPS spectra of the TNA/Pd membrane with the electroless-plated Pd were measured using Mg Kα radiation (Fig. 7 ), where the TNA side of the TNA/Pd membrane was examined. Fig. 7(a) shows that binding energies for Pd (3d5/2 and 3d3/2) peaks agree with those of pure Pd (3d5/2 =334.5eV, 3d3/2 =340.0eV) [47] and Fig. 7(b) shows that binding energies for Ti (2p1/2 and 2p3/2) peaks are in good agreement with those of TiO2 (2p1/2 =464.5eV, 2p3/2 =458.5eV) [47]. These XRD and XPS results demonstrate that the TNA/Pd membrane consists of pure Pd film and anatase TiO2 with no alloy formation."
7,Simultaneous H2 production/separation with the photoactive TNA/Pd membrane,"3.2 Simultaneous H2 production/separation with the photoactive TNA/Pd membrane Fig. 8 shows simultaneous analyses of various gases generated from methanol photodecomposition with the TNA/Pd membrane prepared by electroless plating (Fig. 8(a)) and sputtering (Fig. 8(b)). Several gas species such as H2 (m/e=2), CO2 (m/e=44) and formaldehyde (CH2O) (m/e=30) were monitored simultaneously with the experimental apparatus shown in Fig. 2(a). Here, CO2 and CH2O are main byproduct gases from methanol photodecomposition [48,49]. In Fig. 8(a), the H2 pressure shows an increase–decrease phenomenon according to the ON–OFF of UV illumination and the increase in the H2 pressure under UV illumination was about 1.7×10−6 Pa, on the other hand, the CO2 and CH2O pressures were much smaller than the H2 pressure and continuously decreased regardless of UV illumination, suggesting that the detected CH2O and CO2 were not byproduct gases generated from the photocatalytic decomposition, but originally existed inside the chamber B as background gases. These facts indicate that the TNA/Pd membrane with 2-μm-thick Pd film works for photo-induced simultaneous H2 production and separation. From the data in Fig. 8(a), the purity of generated hydrogen gas was estimated to be 100%, according to the procedure described in our latest report [42]. We would like to note that the thickness of the electroless-deposited Pd film in this work was only one-fifth of that of the sputter-deposited Pd film. In addition, we could not succeed in preparing pinhole-free TNA/Pd membranes with sputter-deposited Pd films thinner than 10μm. Indeed, the cross-sectional view of TNA/Pd membrane with the sputter-deposited Pd layer (Fig. 5(b)) displays that many small cracks appear at the TNA/Pd interface regions, while a smoother interface was formed in the membrane with the electroless-plated palladium (Fig. 5(a)). Electroless plating is probably more suitable for achieving better coverage for the specimens with large surface roughness such as TNA. Actually, the purity of generated hydrogen gas was estimated to be 93% from the data for the TNA/Pd membrane with the sputter-deposited Pd as shown in Fig. 8(b), where the CH2O partial pressure was also slightly changed in accordance with the ON–OFF of UV illumination. Although the H2 purity of almost 100% was sometimes achieved for the membrane with the sputter-deposited Pd as reported in our previous literature [42], we still have some difficulties in maintaining the stable fabrication condition for the membranes with the sputtering technique. According to our trial results, only half the number of the membranes with sputter-deposited Pd showed an acceptable level of the generated H2 purity (better than 99%), while more than 90% of the membranes with electroless-plated Pd reached the H2 purity of more than 99%. This means that minute pinhole-like defects can be formed in the TNA/Pd membrane more easily during the fabrication process with Pd sputter deposition. Therefore, electroless plating can be considered as an efficient technique for preparing high-quality TNA/Pd interface with less number of defects. We shortly discuss the role of the Pd layer for high-purity H2 production in the TNA/Pd membrane. Palladium has been widely used as not only hydrogen separation materials, but also co-catalysts for enhancing photocatalytic functions in semiconductor nanomaterials. Therefore, two possible processes for high-purity H2 production in the TNA/Pd membrane can be considered. One is that photocatalytically-generated protons on the TNA surface may be reduced on the Pd surface which work as co-catalyst and then pass through the Pd layer in the form of proton. The other possible mechanism is that protons generated on the TNA surface directly pass through the Pd layer without being reduced to H2. The investigation on such functional mechanisms of the TNA/Pd membrane is currently underway."
8,H2 production rate and apparent quantum yield for the photoactive TNA/Pd membrane,"3.3 H2 production rate and apparent quantum yield for the photoactive TNA/Pd membrane Fig. 9 shows a data-plot of the H2 production amount measured with the GC system (Fig. 2(b)) against the duration of the UV illumination. The obtained gas amount was proportional to the UV illumination time for initial 2h, while the H2 production rate was slightly decreased when the UV illumination time was kept up to 4h. This aging effect in the photo-induced H2 production/separation function might be due to the initiation of hydrogen embrittlement in the palladium layer [50–52], caused by absorption of a large amount of H2 after the long UV illumination. According to the result in Fig. 9, the amount of high-purity hydrogen produced from the methanol/water mixture with the TNA/Pd membrane per hour was estimated to be 0.37μmol. The H2 production rate per unit area of the membrane was also calculated to be 0.21μmol−1 h−1 cm−2 for initial 2h of the UV illumination. By referring to a previous study on methanol/water photoreforming with TiO2 of Chiarello et al. [9], the apparent quantum yield (Φ) of H2 production with the TNA/Pd membrane was estimated. Φ was defined as the ratio between the number of photo-generated electrons transferred to yield purified hydrogen per unit time and the number of photons irradiated onto the photocatalyst surface per unit time and was given as (1) Φ = 2 r H 2 A I × 100 , where r H 2 is the measured H2 production rate, A the surface area of the TNA/Pd membrane (1.77cm2), and I is the fraction below 400nm of the measured irradiation intensity on the membrane (and is assumed to be 30mW/cm2, which is equivalent to 1.2×10−7 Einstein s−1 cm−2). From the results in this work, the Φ value was roughly estimated to be 0.1%. Please note that the apparent quantum yield Φ considered here includes both the photoreforming process of the methanol/water mixture and the hydrogen permeation process across the Pd layer. It seems that the hydrogen permeation process strongly limits the overall efficiency of high-purity H2 production in this study. The performance of the TNA/Pd membrane is not yet satisfactory, however the further optimization of materials synthesis, structural designs, and operation conditions (temperature, pressure, and so on) for promoting hydrogen separation will realize more efficient high-purity H2 production with this new type of photoactive membranes."
9,Conclusions,"We demonstrated the fabrication of the TNA/Pd membrane using all electrochemical processes and examined its characteristics of high-purity H2 production. The membrane with 2-μm-thick electroless-plated Pd layer owned a high-quality TNA/Pd interface and showed photo-induced function of simultaneous hydrogen production and separation. A new measurement system for the H2 gas volume produced with the membrane was developed, and the H2 production rate and the apparent quantum yield of the photocatalytic reforming with the mixture of methanol and water using the TNA/Pd membrane were evaluated. The preparation and characterization methods for the photoactive membranes developed in this report will contribute to realization of practical compact hydrogen reforming systems with the aid of solar energy."
