0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the absence of a suitable hydrogen distribution infrastructure is one of the main barriers to the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier or as a fuel for energy generation [1,2]. In the early stages of the transition to a hydrogen economy, hydrogen should be produced locally at refueling stations using small-scale fuel processors [3]. These fuel processors pose new challenges for catalyst design as a consequence of their operating conditions and the need for high performance at low cost [4]. Depending on the applications, hydrogen rich streams with very low CO contents (below 10ppm) are necessary and then further processing steps are required. In this case, the reformer is followed by a clean up step such as the water–gas shift reaction (WGS), CO preferential oxidation (PROX), pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or CO methanation. The selection of the different stages of the fuel processor affects significantly the efficiency and the cost of the fuel processor [5]. Different approaches have been proposed to reduce the complexity of the fuel processor such as the use of membrane reactors, which integrates the reaction and the separation steps within the same reactor, or the development of new catalysts designed specifically for the small-scale processors [4]. They must be active, selective to hydrogen and stable under the reaction conditions. For example, a fuel processor to generate hydrogen from ethanol is a rather attractive technology since ethanol is a renewable raw material obtained from fermentation of various agricultural products (e.g., sugar cane). This light alcohol is a high energy density carrier for hydrogen and can be more easily transported by vehicle or pumped to a point of use, where it can be reformed to release the hydrogen with a fuel processor. However, the development of suitable catalysts to effect this reaction is proving to be a challenge. In the literature, the majority of authors [6–15] reported using supported metals as catalysts for the ethanol reforming reactions. In general, these catalysts exhibited optimal performance at high temperatures (between 873 and 1023K) and consequently, large amounts of CO were formed, which increases the fuel processor cost, due to the added complexity of the downstream CO conversion process. In addition, catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition is an important issue [16–18]. A different catalyst design approach is to use metal oxides as catalysts for steam reforming of ethanol [19–22]. In spite of their lower activity than supported metal catalysts, metal oxides are capable of producing hydrogen free of CO as well as carbon deposits, depending on the reaction conditions used. This may eliminate some purification steps and as a result reduce the costs. However, a wide range of undesirable by-products (e.g., ethene, acetaldehyde and acetone) is formed during steam reforming of ethanol over metal oxides in comparison with supported metal catalysts. For instance, acetaldehyde produced upstream may impact the performance of the downstream PROX catalyst. Therefore, the design of an appropriate catalyst that can handle both the reforming as well as the purification steps would go a long way to improve the overall efficiency of the fuel processor. Ceria and ceria-containing mixed oxides have been proposed as catalytically active components for ethanol conversion reactions due to their high oxygen storage capacity, which improves catalyst stability [23–27]. In addition, the strong metal–support interaction prevents metal particle sintering, which also contributes to catalyst deactivation. Recently, we have investigated the performance of supported Pt catalysts for steam reforming of ethanol [26,27]. At low reaction temperature, the Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst underwent significant deactivation during ethanol decomposition and steam reforming reactions. Co-feeding oxygen decreased the deactivation rate of the catalyst but adversely impacted the selectivity to hydrogen. Increasing the reaction temperature greatly improved the stability of the catalyst [26]. A reaction mechanism was proposed based upon results obtained from in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analyses carried out under reaction conditions. The effect of the support nature and metal dispersion on the performance of supported Pt catalysts during steam reforming of ethanol was also studied [27]. H2 and CO production were facilitated over Pt/CeO2 and Pt/CeZrO2, whereas the acetaldehyde and ethene formation were favored on Pt/ZrO2. However, regardless of the support used, all the catalysts significantly deactivated during the reaction at low temperature. Unpromoted cerium oxide has also been used as a catalyst for the steam reforming of ethanol [19,20,22]. CeO2 exhibited activity for steam reforming of ethanol while CO was not detected or it was formed in very low concentrations. Many catalysts have been considered for the PROX reaction. A recent work published by Park et al. [28] describes an overview of the performance of many catalytic systems, including Au, Pt, Cu, Rh and Ru supported on different oxides. However, as far as we know in the literature, there is no data related to the impact of oxygenates on the catalytic performance of the PROX reaction. The aim of this work is to study the performance of catalysts used to convert ethanol to hydrogen in a combined system including steam reforming and PROX reactions. CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalyst were tested for the steam reforming of ethanol and the role of the support on the reaction mechanism was investigated using diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy carried out under steady state reaction conditions. Attention was also focused on the activity of Pt/CeO2 catalysts for CO and acetaldehyde removal."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation CeO2 and Al2O3 were used as supports. Al2O3 was supplied by NORPRO and CeO2 support was obtained by calcination of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 in a muffle furnace at 1073K for 1h. Platinum was added to the supports by the incipient wetness impregnation technique using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 393K and calcined under air flow (50mL/min) at 673K for 2h. The following catalysts were obtained: 0.5%Pt/CeO2, 1.0%Pt/CeO2, 1.5%Pt/CeO2, 2.0%Pt/CeO2 and 1.5% Pt/Al2O3."
3,BET surface area,2.2 BET surface area The BET surface areas were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 analyzer by nitrogen adsorption at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen.
4,Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR),"2.3 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) Temperature Programmed Reduction measurements were carried out in a micro-reactor coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzers, Omnistar). The samples (300mg) were dehydrated at 423K for 30min in a He flow prior to reduction. After cooling to room temperature, a mixture of 5% H2 in Ar flowed through the sample at 30cm3/min, raising the temperature at a heating rate of 10K/min up to 1273K."
5,Cyclohexane dehydrogenation,"2.4 Cyclohexane dehydrogenation Platinum dispersion was estimated through cyclohexane dehydrogenation, a structure-insensitive reaction [29]. Since H2 and CO spillover occurs over a CeO2 support, metal dispersion could not be determined from the chemisorption of both gases [30]. To estimate the dispersion of the Pt/CeO2 catalysts, a correlation between the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation and the metal dispersion measured by hydrogen chemisorption was established from Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with different metal particle sizes. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalysts (50mg) were reduced at 623K for 1h, and the reaction was carried out at 543K and WHSV=170h−1. The reactants were fed to the reactor by bubbling H2 through a saturator containing cyclohexane kept at 285K, with the intention of obtaining the desired H2/HC ratio (13:1). The exit gases were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography."
6,Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) of ethanol,"2.5 Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) of ethanol TPD experiments of adsorbed ethanol were carried out in a micro-reactor coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Balzers). Prior to TPD analyses, the samples were reduced under flowing H2 (30mL/min) ramping the temperature at a rate of 10K/min to 773K, and holding at this temperature for 1h. After reduction, the system was purged with helium at 773K for 30min and cooled to room temperature. The adsorption of ethanol was carried out at room temperature using an ethanol/He mixture, which was obtained by flowing He through a saturator containing ethanol at 298K. After adsorption, the catalyst was heated at 20K/min to 773K under flowing helium (60mL/min). The products were monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer."
7,DRIFTS,"2.6 DRIFTS DRIFTS spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Nexus 870 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS-TEC detector. A Thermo Spectra-Tech cell capable of high pressure/high temperature operation and fitted with ZnSe windows served as the reaction chamber for in situ adsorption and reaction measurements. Scans were taken at a resolution of 4 to give a data spacing of 1928cm−1. Depending on the signal-to-noise ratio, the number of scans ranged from 256 to 1024. The amount of catalyst was ∼40mg. Samples were first reduced by ramping in 200mL/min H2:He (1:1) at ∼10K/min and holding at 773K for 1h. The catalyst was purged in flowing He at 773K, prior to cooling in flowing He to 313K. For ethanol adsorption and ethanol steam reforming reaction tests, He was bubbled at ∼15mL/min through a saturator filled with ethanol and held at 273K. For ethanol steam reforming tests, a second helium stream (∼15mL/min) was bubbled through a saturator filled with water and held at 298K. The two streams were joined at a tee-junction, prior to which 1 psig check valves were placed on the lines to prevent a back-flow condition. The saturator gas flows and temperatures were set to provide a H2O:CH3CH2OH stoichiometric ratio of 2:1, which is nominal for SR. Adsorption/reaction measurements were started in the range of 313–323K, and then the temperature was increased at 10K/min; measurements were recorded at 373, 473, 573, 673 and 773K. To explore the deactivation of the catalyst, the changes in spectra were monitored as a function of time onstream by flowing the ethanol/H2O mixture at 773K for approximately 6h."
8,Reaction conditions,"2.7 Reaction conditions 2.7.1 Ethanol decomposition and steam reforming of ethanol Ethanol decomposition (i.e., H2O/ethanol molar ratio=0.0) was carried out on unpromoted CeO2. Steam reforming of ethanol was performed over unpromoted CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. All reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. To activate the catalyst, the samples were reduced under flowing H2 at 773K for 1h and then purged with N2 at the same temperature for 30min. Ethanol decomposition and steam reforming of ethanol reactions were carried out at 773K. For steam reforming of ethanol, H2O/ethanol molar ratios of 2.0, 3.0 or 5.0 were utilized. The reactant mixtures were obtained using two saturators containing water and ethanol, which were maintained at the temperature required to obtain the desired H2O/ethanol molar ratios. For ethanol decomposition, N2 (30mL/min) was passed through the saturator with ethanol, and then the reactant mixture obtained was diluted with N2 (30mL/min). In the case of steam reforming, the reactant mixture was obtained by flowing two N2 streams (30mL/min) through each saturator containing ethanol and water separately. The partial pressure of ethanol was maintained constant for all experiments. The variation of partial pressure of water was compensated by a decrease in the partial pressure of N2. In order to explore the catalyst deactivation within a short period of time, a small amount of catalyst was used (20mg). The samples were diluted with inert SiC (SiC mass/catalyst mass=3.0). The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Micro GC Agilent 3000 A) with the instrument containing two channels for dual thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and two columns: a molecular sieve and a Poraplot U column. The ethanol conversion and product selectivities were determined from (1) X ethanol = ( n ethanol ) fed − ( n ethanol ) exit ( n ethanol ) fed × 100 (2) S x = ( n x ) produced ( n total ) produced × 100 where (n x)produced =moles of x produced (x=hydrogen, CO, CO2, methane, acetaldehyde or ethene) and (n total)produced =moles of H2 +moles of CO+moles of CO2 +moles of acetaldehyde+moles of ethene (the moles of water produced are not included). 2.7.2 Preferential oxidation of CO The catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed reactor, monitored by on-line gas chromatography, equipped with flame ionization and conductivity detectors and also a methanator. Before each run, the catalysts were reduced under flowing H2 (30mL/min) at 623K during 30min. Three different experiments were carried out: (i) the reaction was performed at 348K by using 8mg of catalyst and a reactant mixture containing 50% H2, 200ppm CO, 2% O2 and balanced with N2 in order to measure the rate of CO consumption; (ii) the catalyst (15mg) performance was evaluated in the temperature range of 325–525K, in 25 and 50K increments. The catalyst was held at each temperature for at least 2h. The composition of the reactant mixture was 50% H2, 200ppm CO, 2% O2 and 0–1% acetaldehyde balanced with N2; (iii) the reaction of acetaldehyde in absence of oxygen was carried out using 200mg of catalyst and a reactant mixture containing 61% H2 and 3.7% of acetaldehyde balanced with N2."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The BET surface area of CeO2 support was very low (14m2/g) and it was not measurably affected by the addition of platinum. Alumina exhibited a BET surface area of 200m2/g. The Pt dispersion values obtained were 58 and 80% for 1.5%Pt/CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. The TPR profiles of CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2 are presented in Fig. 1 . For the CeO2, a small H2 uptake at 817K and a strong H2 consumption at 1230K were observed. The first peak is attributed to the surface reduction of CeO2 and the second one to the formation of Ce2O3 [31]. The TPR profile of the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst presented two peaks at 457 and 1256K, respectively. The former corresponds not only to the PtO2 reduction but also to CeO2 surface reduction. The peak at 1256K is ascribed to bulk CeO2 reduction [31]. A comparison between the TPR profiles of supports and catalysts shows that the addition of Pt promotes the reduction of support. This promoting effect is due to the hydrogen spillover from metal particles onto the support."
11,Steam reforming of ethanol over unpromoted CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2,"3.2 Steam reforming of ethanol over unpromoted CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2 Ethanol conversion and product distributions as a function of time on stream (TOS) obtained for unpromoted CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2 during steam reforming of ethanol with H2O/ethanol molar ratio of 2.0 at 773K are presented in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited the highest initial ethanol conversion. However, this catalyst significantly deactivated during the reaction, whereas unpromoted CeO2 was quite stable, after an initial transient period. Further discussion of the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst deactivation is presented (Section 3.5) in terms of the proposed mechanism following the analysis of DRIFTS. Regarding the product distributions, hydrogen, CO2 and ethene were the main products obtained over unpromoted CeO2. Small quantities of acetaldehyde (around 3%) and trace amounts of methane were also observed. It is important to stress that the production of CO during testing of the unpromoted CeO2 catalyst was very low (less than 200ppm). This result reduces significantly the complexity of the fuel processor, since the water gas shift reaction step of the fuel processor is no longer needed, decreasing the costs associated with CO conversion during hydrogen purification. In the case of 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst, at the beginning of the reaction, the main products observed were hydrogen, methane and CO2. In addition, small quantities of CO (around 6%) and trace amounts of acetaldehyde were also detected. Nevertheless, as the catalyst deactivated, the acetaldehyde and CO2 selectivities increased while the hydrogen, methane and CO selectivities decreased. A decrease in H2 selectivity and an increase in the acetaldehyde selectivity during steam reforming of ethanol over an alumina-supported Pt catalyst were also detected by Dömök et al. [32]. In order to study the effect of the addition of the noble metal to the oxide on the product distribution, the results obtained on a dry basis at the same level of conversion (60%) and the same reaction conditions (reaction temperature=773K and H2O/ethanol molar ratio=2.0) for 1.5%Pt/CeO2 and CeO2 were evaluated (Table 1 ). The addition of the metal favored methane and CO formation. On the other hand, ethene production was predominant over unpromoted CeO2. Since the highest stability and the lowest CO production rates were obtained for unpromoted CeO2, the performance of this catalyst during ethanol reforming was evaluated in greater detail."
12,Effect of the addition of water on the performance of CeO2 support,"3.3 Effect of the addition of water on the performance of CeO2 support In order to study the effect of water addition during ethanol reforming over unpromoted CeO2, the reactions were carried out at 773K, using H2O/ethanol molar ratios of 0.0 (ethanol decomposition), 2.0, 3.0 or 5.0. Fig. 3a shows the ethanol conversion and product distributions obtained for CeO2 support during ethanol decomposition. The ethanol conversion was almost complete and it was quite stable during 6h TOS. Increasing H2O/ethanol molar ratio from 2.0 (Fig. 2a) to 5.0 (Fig. 3b and c), decreased the initial ethanol conversion rate. This result indicates that ethanol and water compete for the same actives sites. In addition, after an initial transient period, ethanol conversion remained relatively stable under different H2O/ethanol molar ratios. Regarding the product distributions, the main products obtained were hydrogen, CO2 and ethene at all H2O/ethanol molar ratios studied (Figs. 2 and 3a–c). Small quantities of acetaldehyde (around 2–6%) and trace amounts of methane and CO (less than 200ppm) were also observed. In the case of ethanol decomposition, a slight decrease in ethene selectivity was accompanied by a small, but measurable increase in H2 selectivity. However, in the presence of water, no significant changes in the product distribution were observed. A comparison between the results presented in Fig. 3a (ethanol decomposition) and Fig. 2a (steam reforming with H2O/ethanol molar ratio=2.0) showed that although the addition of water did not have a beneficial effect on ethanol conversion, it increased the H2 and CO2 selectivities and decreased the acetaldehyde and ethene selectivities. These results indicate that the presence of water in the feed favored the ethanol steam reforming reaction pathway over either the direct ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde or ethanol dehydration to ethene reaction routes. These results are consistent with the findings of Dömök et al. [32], who reported that increasing the H2O/ethanol molar ratio led to a decrease in ethene production during steam reforming of ethanol over alumina-supported Pt catalysts. As described above, the presence of water inhibits the dehydration of ethanol pathway, thereby limiting the amount of ethene produced."
13,Reaction mechanism of ethanol reforming,"3.4 Reaction mechanism of ethanol reforming 3.4.1 TPD of ethanol The TPD profiles of adsorbed ethanol over unpromoted CeO2 are shown in Fig. 4a. A peak corresponding to molecular ethanol desorption was observed at 387K. Several authors [14,33] have detected ethanol adsorption in TPD of ethanol over supported metal catalysts at low temperatures. Besides ethanol, small amounts of methane and acetaldehyde were also detected around 380K. Some authors reported that the formation of methane and CO in the low-temperature region during TPD of ethanol could be attributed to the decomposition of ethoxy species formed by the dissociative adsorption of ethanol on the catalyst surface [26,33–37], an explanation that fits well with our observations. The absence of CO suggests that it reacts with the oxygen from the support, present either as adsorbed –O* adatoms or –OH* hydroxyl groups, to form carbonate and/or formate species. Actually, TPR analysis of unpromoted CeO2 revealed the surface reduction of ceria, at temperatures below 773K. In addition, the sample was treated for 1h in H2 at 773K, which should favor the conversion of –O* to –OH*. In short, CO reacts with the adsorbed O (present either as –O* or –OH*) to produce associated species that in turn decompose at higher temperature to liberate CO2. In the case of acetaldehyde, some authors have shown [14,26] that the formation of acetaldehyde during TPD of ethanol over supported metal catalysts was assigned to direct ethanol dehydrogenation. In addition, the absence of hydrogen desorption in our work suggests that hydrogen still remained adsorbed in the low-temperature region. At temperatures between 500 and 650K, a number of products, including hydrogen, methane, CO and ethene were detected. Formation of hydrogen, methane and CO could be related to the decomposition of dehydrogenated species (acetaldehyde and acetyl species) [33,35,36]. Ethene production, on the other hand, is typically assigned to the dehydration of ethanol [14,26]. Above 700K, hydrogen, CO, CO2 and methane were formed, and can be assigned to the decomposition of acetate species [33,35,36], a process that in part involves carbonate species as intermediates. Finally, the production of hydrogen detected at high temperature in the TPD profiles of unpromoted CeO2 can be attributed to the desorption of hydrogen previously formed during the different dehydrogenation steps taking place in the catalysis. Fig. 4b presents the TPD profiles of adsorbed ethanol for the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. The results obtained were similar to those observed by Mattos and Noronha [33] during TPD of ethanol over CeO2 supported platinum catalyst. In contrast to the results obtained for unpromoted CeO2, no significant desorption profiles of ethanol or acetaldehyde were detected in the low-temperature range over 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. On the other hand, 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a significant hydrogen desorption peak (at 417K) as well as peaks for methane (at 418 and 469K), which can be attributed to the decomposition of ethoxy species [33–37]. However, according to the literature [33–37], the decomposition of these species produces hydrogen, methane and CO. Then, in this work, the absence of CO desorption suggests that CO remained adsorbed over 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst at low temperature. At temperatures above 500K, a significant TPD peak for CO was detected at 653K, whereas methane emanated from the surface in two distinct peaks situated at 615 and 649K, respectively. As described earlier for the case of unpromoted ceria, CO and methane formation in the high-temperature region can be attributed to the conversion of acetate species. In addition, a relatively small desorption peak for hydrogen, previously formed during the various dehydrogenation steps, was observed beginning at approximately 650K. By comparing the TPD profiles of unpromoted CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2, a number of differences become apparent. In the low-temperature region (i.e., <490K), molecular ethanol desorption was only observed with unpromoted CeO2 support, indicating that 1.5%Pt/CeO2 possesses a greater density of strong active sites, making the catalyst more active. Furthermore, the formation rates of methane and hydrogen were much higher for the case of the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst, suggesting that the decomposition reaction of ethoxy species was promoted by the presence of the metal. However, it is apparent that the CO formed during ethoxy decomposition remained adsorbed on the metal surface, as it was not detected in the gas phase at low temperatures. At high temperature, both CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2 produced methane and CO, indicating that the decomposition of acetaldehyde and/or acetate species occur in both cases, clearly delineating the role of the oxide in providing adsorption sites for these oxygenate species. However, since the amounts formed were higher over the Pt-containing catalyst, it is apparent that these reactions are promoted by the presence of the Pt metal, indicating that Pt operates on the molecules adsorbed on the ceria itself, at the metal–oxide interface. In addition, CO2 was only detected over unpromoted CeO2. As described above, the formation of CO2 was assigned to the decomposition of carbonate species, which are formed during the conversion of acetate species. Since the TPR profiles of unpromoted CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/CeO2 revealed that Pt facilitated reduction of the surface shell of ceria to much lower temperatures, a higher density of oxygen vacancies in the ceria fraction of 1.5%Pt/CeO2 may provide sites for the CO2 to react, yielding CO. It is important to note that, while the TPD studies do provide useful information regarding the impact of Pt addition to ceria, the technique has some limitations. One important drawback is that co-fed water was not present during TPD. The role of co-fed H2O on promoting the decomposition rates and selectivities of adsorbed species during catalytic reactions has been well documented [10]. This is one reason why water co-feeding was included during the DRIFTS investigations. 3.4.2 DRIFTS analysis of ethanol desorption Fig. 5 presents DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed ethanol on CeO2 support at different temperatures. At room temperature, the bands at 1049 and 1099cm−1 correspond to different vibrational modes of ethoxy species, which were formed by dissociative adsorption of ethanol [33–37] and adsorb over Ce cations in bidentate and monodentate modes [38]. The ethoxy species are associated with Ce3+ atoms on the surface of ceria consistent with surface shell reduction, which in H2 flow generates defect-associated Type II bridging OH groups [10]. Since the TPR profile for unpromoted CeO2 revealed that the surface shell reduction occurs in the 660–880K range, the 1h activation at 773K in H2 should allow this partial reduction of ceria to take place. Then, the ethoxy species may preferentially adsorb over Ce3+ according to Scheme 1 . Besides the bands related to ethoxy species, the DRIFTS spectrum of unpromoted CeO2 obtained at room temperature exhibited bands at 1306, 1423 and 1562cm−1, which are assigned to δs(CH3), νs(OCO), νa(OCO) vibrational modes of acetate species, respectively. The bands at 2863, 2927 and 2971cm−1 are also associated with the different vibrational modes (i.e., C–H stretching) of ethoxy species and acetate species [33]. The presence of the bands assigned to acetate species indicates that ethoxy species were somehow oxidized to acetate species. According to the literature [39,40], ethoxy species are dehydrogenated to acetaldehyde, which may in turn be further dehydrogenated to acetyl species. The acetate species can be formed by two different routes [14]: (i) the reaction between acetaldehyde and surface OH groups and/or (ii) the reaction between the acetyl species and the oxygen from the support. In the present work, the density of O* adatoms available for reaction should be low over unpromoted CeO2, since the reduction of the surface shell of ceria should be complete at 773K in H2 treatment. Therefore, the route involving the reaction between the ethoxy species (and proposed adsorbed intermediary acetaldehyde) and the surface hydroxyl groups from the support (Scheme 2 ) may be favored over unpromoted CeO2 pretreated in H2 at 773K. Increasing the temperature to 373K, decreased the intensity of the bands corresponding to ethoxy species (1051 and 1101cm−1) whereas no significant changes were detected in the intensity of the bands assigned to acetate species (1303, 1425 and 1558cm−1). This result confirms that the methane desorption observed in TPD profiles of unpromoted CeO2 around 380K was due to the decomposition of a fraction of ethoxy species. When unpromoted CeO2 was heated to 673K, the bands associated with ethoxy species were no longer detected while those assigned to acetate species decreased. In addition, the absence of bands at 2860–2970cm−1 suggests that carbonate species are formed at high temperatures on CeO2. Nevertheless, the presence of the acetate species may not be ruled out, since it is very hard to distinguish between carbonate species and acetate species by the vibrational modes in the O–C–O stretching region [33]. Above 673K, the bands corresponding to acetate species and/or carbonate species significantly decreased. Comparing this result and TPD experiments for unpromoted CeO2, it is clear that the acetate species decomposed to CH4 and COX over the active oxide surface at high temperature. The DRIFTS spectrum for the adsorption of ethanol over 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst at room temperature (Fig. 6 ) also exhibited bands assigned to ethoxy species (1041, 1080 and 1406cm−1), acetate species (1319, 1450 and 1562cm−1), as well as bands assigned to both ethoxy and acetate species (2902, 2955 and 2974cm−1). The TPR analysis showed that the degree of the reduction of ceria surface shell of the catalyst is higher than that obtained for unpromoted ceria below 773K, indicating that the ethoxy species are adsorbed over Ce3+ cations (i.e., oxygen vacancy defects). In addition, the formation of ethoxy species from the adsorption of ethanol over Ce3+ cations occurs simultaneously with the formation of hydroxyl groups by dissociation of the ethanol molecule. During ethanol adsorption, a decrease in a band at ∼3650cm−1 indicates that the ethanol adsorption displaces H2O that was dissociated at O vacancies according to a mechanism previously reported by de Lima et al. [26,27]. In the case of acetate species formation, since the surface of the catalyst has been partially reduced by the hydrogen treatment, the density of O* adatoms available for reaction should be at least low and possibly lower than that obtained for unpromoted CeO2. Therefore, the route from ethoxy to acetate involving OH is likely. This mechanism was proposed by de Lima et al. [26] during DRIFTS of ethanol desorption over Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst, whose ceria surface was completely reduced by hydrogen. According to them, after the reduction, the density of O* adatoms available for reaction over Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst should be low relative to the adsorbed OH* group and, therefore the route from ethoxy to acetate involving Type II bridging OH groups appears to be more likely. In addition to the bands assigned to ethoxy and acetate species, the spectrum of 1.5%Pt/CeO2 also exhibited a band attributed to the ν(CO) mode of linearly adsorbed CO on small Pt particles (2063cm−1) [26,41–43]. When the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst was heated to 373K, the intensity of the bands corresponding to ethoxy species decreased whereas the intensity of the bands assigned to CO adsorbed on metal particles increased. In addition, the bands related to acetate species remained unchanged. The decrease in the intensities of bands corresponding to ethoxy species and the increase of those associated with CO formation confirm that ethanol decomposes to CO, methane and hydrogen. At 473K, the bands associated with ethoxy species completely disappeared whereas those assigned to acetate species slightly increased. A significant increase in the intensities of the bands corresponding to CO (2058cm−1) was also observed. In addition a shoulder at 1938cm−1 is now detected, which corresponds to the ν(CO) mode of bridged CO bound to large Pt particles. These results are consistent with the TPD of adsorbed ethanol (Fig. 4b), which revealed desorption of methane and hydrogen between 418 and 469K. The increase of the CO band and the corresponding decrease of the bands for ethoxy species confirm that the decomposition of ethoxy species occurs in the low-temperature region and that CO formed remained adsorbed on the Pt component of the catalyst. de Lima et al. [26] reported similar results during DRIFTS of ethanol desorption over Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst. Dömök et al. [32] monitored by mass spectrometry the gas phase composition during IR experiments. Their results indicated the formation of hydrogen and methane, confirming that ethanol decomposition takes place. According to the authors, the decomposition of both ethoxy and acetaldehyde species contributes to the formation of methane, hydrogen and CO. Increasing the temperature to 573K led to a decrease in the intensities of bands assigned to ν(CO), while the bands at 1547, 1417 and 1342cm−1 increased. Since the bands around 2972–2902cm−1 completely disappeared, the increases observed in the intensities of the bands located at 1547, 1417 and 1342cm−1 are likely attributed to the formation of carbonate species. At 673K, the intensities of bands assigned to acetate and/or carbonate species and those of adsorbed CO decreased. At 773K, the bands corresponding to acetate and/or carbonate species were no longer detected, while the CO remained adsorbed on metal surface. In comparing the results with the TPD data, it is evident that the formation of CO and methane above 500K detected in TPD profiles of 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst is consistent with acetate decomposition as observed in the DRIFTS experiment. In addition, as observed for TPD of ethanol, the absence of CO2 could be due to the dissociation of CO2 on oxygen vacancies of the ceria support. 3.4.3 DRIFTS analysis under ethanol+water mixture at different temperatures Fig. 7 shows the DRIFTS spectra of unpromoted CeO2 under the reaction mixture containing ethanol and water obtained at different temperatures. The spectrum at room temperature exhibits the same bands as observed during DRIFTS analysis after ethanol adsorption (Fig. 5): ethoxy species (1057 and 1101cm−1); acetate species (1319, 1425 and 1556cm−1) and both ethoxy and acetate species (2974 and 2881cm−1). In this case, a new band is detected at around 1626cm−1, which is attributed to the ν(CO) vibrational mode of acetyl species [39,40]. This intermediate stems from hydrogen elimination of the adsorbed acetaldehyde. When the sample was heated to 373K, no significant changes were observed in the DRIFTS spectra. However, increasing temperature to 473K resulted in a significant increase in the band intensities of acetate species and a decrease in those assigned to ethoxy species. In addition, the bands corresponding to acetyl species disappeared. At 573K, the bands of ethoxy species were no longer detected, while the intensities of acetate species bands increased and a band associated to hydrogen carbonate species was also observed at 1612cm−1. Above 573K, the bands assigned to acetate species and hydrogen carbonate species slightly decreased, but both species are still present at 773K. Moreover, the gas phase CO2 was also detected at 773K (2324 and 2364cm−1). The DRIFTS spectra of 1.5%Pt/CeO2 support recorded during co-feeding of the ethanol+water mixture at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 8 . At room temperature, the assignments of the IR bands observed were similar to those reported previously for DRIFTS of ethanol desorption (Fig. 6). However, besides the bands corresponding to ethoxy species, acetate species and linearly adsorbed CO, there is a band related to acetyl species. At 373K, the intensities of the bands assigned to adsorb CO on Pt particles increased while those assigned to ethoxy and acetyl species diminished. Furthermore, no significant changes in the intensity of the bands assigned to acetate species were observed and the band corresponding to acetaldehyde (1693cm−1) may be detected [32,39,40]. These results suggest that the ethoxy and dehydrogenated species were decomposed at low temperatures. When the sample was heated to 473K, the bands of acetate species, acetaldehyde and adsorbed CO increased. In addition, the bands related to ethoxy species significantly decreased. Increasing temperature to 573K resulted in an increase of the intensity of the bands related to acetate species with a significant decreased in the band corresponding to acetaldehyde. It was also observed that the bands of ethoxy species disappeared, the intensity of the CO band remained unchanged and gas phase CO2 was clearly present (2324 and 2368cm−1). Above 573K, the intensities of bands characteristic of acetate species and adsorbed CO on Pt decreased. In addition, the presence of carbonate species should be considered, since the bands around 2978–2889cm−1 are no longer detected. A comparison between the results obtained for DRIFTS experiments under ethanol+water mixture over unpromoted CeO2 (Fig. 7) and 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 8) reveal that there are significant differences in the relative intensities of the bands corresponding to each species. Significant amounts of acetate and carbonate species were still detected over unpromoted CeO2 at high temperatures, in contrast to the results observed for 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. These results indicate that the presence of the metal promotes acetate decomposition at high temperature, which likely occurs at the metal–support interface, as described by the mechanism previously proposed by de Lima et al. [26,27]. This may explain the high selectivities to methane and CO2 observed initially during steam reforming of ethanol at 773K for the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 2b). de Lima et al. [26] studied the catalytic performance of a Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst for ethanol decomposition, steam reforming, partial oxidation and oxidative steam reforming of ethanol. The reaction mechanisms were proposed based upon results obtained from TPD of ethanol and in situ DRIFTS analyses carried out under different reaction conditions (DRIFTS of ethanol desorption; DRIFTS under pure ethanol flow and DRIFTS under ethanol+water mixture). Ethanol dissociatively adsorbs to generate ethoxy species and adsorbed H (as a bridging –OH group). The catalytic decomposition of ethoxy species may follow different pathways: (i) decomposition to CO, CH4, and H2 or (ii) dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and acetyl species. The dehydrogenated species may in turn undergo support-induced oxidation to acetate species, with either surface O* or –OH* supplying the O required. As a result, adding co-fed water-promoted acetate species formation. As an added benefit, water also aided the acetaldehyde and acetate decomposition reactions to methane and carbonate, which decomposes to CO2. This is known as forward acetate decomposition (Scheme 3 ), and is similar to forward formate decomposition previously proposed [10], which evolves CO2 and H2 instead of the reverse decomposition. The reverse decomposition occurs thermally in the absence of H2O to yield primarily CO and adsorbed H2O (i.e., as bridging –OH groups). With forward acetate decomposition, the analog of H2 (forward formate decomposition) is methane. It is important to note that CO is likely produced as a secondary product by reaction of the CO2 with vacancies, or via an alternate reverse shift mechanism. Both acetate demethanation and CO2 conversion steps are likely promoted by the interface between the oxide and the Pt, in line with de Lima et al. [26,27]."
14,Catalyst deactivation during steam reforming of ethanol,"3.5 Catalyst deactivation during steam reforming of ethanol The results obtained during continuous steam reforming of ethanol showed that the presence of the metal significantly decreased the stability of the sample. Several authors [14,18,26,27,32] also observed a significant deactivation of supported metal catalysts during steam reforming of ethanol. According to Erdohelyi et al. [14], the catalytic deactivation during steam reforming of ethanol was due to an inhibiting effect caused by surface acetate species. Platon et al. [18] studied the deactivation of Rh/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalysts during low temperature ethanol steam reforming, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and TPO analysis. The results did not reveal any significant metal particle sintering or carbon deposits. However, an important buildup of carbonaceous intermediates was observed, which may be a contributing factor in the deactivation of the catalyst. These carbonaceous intermediates were less stable at higher reaction temperatures. Among different reaction intermediates, acetone and ethene were the main ones suggested to be responsible for catalyst deactivation. Recently, de Lima et al. [26] have studied the performance of Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst during steam reforming of ethanol at 773K. They also observed that Pt/CeZrO2 catalyst significantly deactivated during the reaction and that this deactivation was followed by an increase of acetaldehyde selectivity. TPO experiments performed after reaction, DRIFTS results and an analysis of the product distributions indicated that the catalyst deactivation could be linked to an increasing surface coverage of acetate intermediates with time on stream. In this work, it was also detected that the decrease in the ethanol conversion over 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst was followed by an increase in the acetaldehyde selectivity. In addition, DRIFTS experiments performed under reaction conditions at different temperatures revealed that the coverage of the catalyst surface by acetate species was higher over unpromoted CeO2 at 773K, indicating that the presence of the metal increased the turnover rate of acetate species, leading to lower steady state coverage. Then, in order to determine the nature of the surface species formed during the reaction on 1.5%Pt/CeO2, DRIFTS spectra were recorded during 6h under a steady flow of the ethanol+water mixture (H2O/ethanol molar ratio of 2.0) at 773K (Fig. 9 ). The DRIFTS spectrum obtained at the beginning of the reaction were similar to the one observed at 773K in Fig. 8. The presence of the bands at 1508 and 1373cm−1 and the absence of the bands around 2970–2880cm−1 suggest that this sample contains mainly carbonate species. Furthermore, the bands corresponding to adsorbed CO (2062cm−1) and CO2 formation (2330 and 2364cm−1) were also detected over 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. During the reaction, the intensities of bands in the wavenumber region between 1300 and 1600cm−1 (i.e., O–C–O stretching region) increased, while those bands around 2970–2880cm−1 (i.e., C–H stretching region) began to develop and then slightly increase with time onstream. This result indicates that the surface population of acetate species increased as a function of time onstream. Moreover, an increase in the bands assigned to acetate species was accompanied by a decrease in the bands corresponding to adsorbed CO. This suggests that the turnover rate for acetate species decomposition decreased during the reaction, leading in turn to increasing acetate coverage on the catalyst surface. According to the reaction mechanism proposed, the acetate species are formed by the oxidation of dehydrogenated species like acetaldehyde and acetyl species. Next, the acetate species are decomposed to methane, CO and/or CO2. The presence of the metal favors this reaction pathway, since acetate demethanation likely occurs at the metal–support interface. Since the Pt–CO band is decreasing, this points to a loss in Pt active sites as a function of time on stream, thereby inhibiting the acetate demethanation step. In summary, the increasing coverage of acetate species on the catalyst surface with time on stream indicates that the turnover rate for acetate decomposition decreases due to the time dependent loss of the Pt–oxide interaction. The DRIFTS spectra under the reaction mixture of CeO2 support obtained at 773K during 6h are presented in Fig. 10 . The DRIFTS spectrum obtained at the beginning of the reaction was similar to the one observed at 773K in Fig. 7. The presence of the bands at 1334, 1429, 1543 and around 2970–2880cm−1 indicates that the acetate species is the main species formed over this sample. The acetate species are still present even at high temperature over unpromoted CeO2, since the metal promoter, which facilitates acetate decomposition, is absent. During the first 3h of reaction, a slight increase of the intensity of the bands related to acetate species was detected. However, after that, no significant modifications were detected in the DRIFTS spectra of CeO2. Therefore, the unpromoted CeO2 exhibited high surface coverage of adsorbed acetate species at 773K and did not lose activity during the reaction, which indicates that the accumulation of acetate species on the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst surface seems to be symptomatic and not the root cause for the deactivation of the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Actually, the decomposition of acetate species leads to the formation of CH x species that recombine with H* adatoms, liberating CH4. On 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the rate of acetate decomposition may be higher than the rate of desorption of CH x species as methane, since the presence of the Pt promotes this reaction pathway. The CH x species formed could in turn lead to the blockage of the Pt–support interface, and thus resulting in catalyst deactivation. Some authors [44] proposed a similar bifunctional mechanism for the steam reforming of acetic acid over Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. According to them, the catalyst deactivates when the boundary sites between Pt and zirconia are blocked by CH x residues. In the case of the CeO2 support, it appears that there may be a proper balance between the rate of acetate decomposition and the rate of desorption of CH x species which may promote catalyst stability. Nevertheless, 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst should exhibit a constant ethanol conversion level of 60–70% even if there is an accumulation of CH x species on Pt–oxide interface, since this is the conversion level observed for unpromoted CeO2 after 6h TOS. However, the ethanol decreased to 10% after 6h TOS over 1.5Pt%/CeO2 catalyst. This suggests that the accumulation of CH x species also spreads over CeO2 support. Therefore, CeO2 is a promising catalyst for steam reforming since it produces H2 with very low CO content and no significant carbon deposition is formed. As a result, the need for a shift reactor may not be necessary, since the reformate could conceivably be fed directly to the PROX cleanup system. However, the presence of a significant amount of acetaldehyde in the hydrogen rich stream (around 3–5%) demands that the PROX catalyst be designed to simultaneously remove CO and acetaldehyde."
15,Preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in the presence of hydrogen using Pt/CeO2 catalysts,"3.6 Preferential CO oxidation (PROX) in the presence of hydrogen using Pt/CeO2 catalysts Pt-based catalysts are among the most studied for the PROX reaction. Indeed, many supports, like Al2O3 [45,46], SiO2 [45], CeO2 [46], activated carbon [47] and also the association with others metals like Fe, Mn, Nb and Co [45,46] have been considered. Recent work published by Park et al. [28] provides an overview of the performance of different catalytic systems, where even very simple systems like Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CeO2 are indicated to be able to completely eliminate CO from the hydrogen stream. In this work, the performance of a Pt/CeO2 catalysts for the conversion of low concentrations of CO in the presence of acetaldehyde was studied. Pt/Al2O3 was used as a reference. The activity of the different x%Pt/CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 catalysts was initially examined by calculating the reaction rate under differential conditions at 348K (Fig. 11 ). Increasing Pt content increases the reaction rate of CO removal, reaching a maximum for 1.5%Pt/CeO2 and then decreasing at higher Pt concentration. A comparison between the reaction rate of 1.5%Pt/CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 catalysts reveals that the ceria supported catalyst is more active. Therefore, ceria supported catalyst containing 1.5%Pt was selected as the catalyst for the tests of CO removal. 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was also used as a reference. Fig. 12 shows the CO outlet concentration and H2 conversion versus temperature during PROX reaction over 1.5%Pt/CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Both catalysts eliminate completely the CO (<10ppm) from the hydrogen stream at around 400K. In addition, hydrogen consumption does increase as the temperature increases and is slightly higher for 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst in the entire temperature region."
16,The CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen and acetaldehyde,"3.7 The CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen and acetaldehyde Fig. 13 shows the acetaldehyde and hydrogen conversion of 1.5%Pt/CeO2 and 1.5%Pt/Al2O3, respectively. Regardless of the catalyst type, the acetaldehyde conversion increases whereas the hydrogen conversion remains constant as temperature increases. In addition, 1.5%Pt/CeO2 was the most active. A comparison with Fig. 11 reveals that the H2 consumption rates over both catalysts were not significantly affected by the presence of acetaldehyde. The CO content at the outlet of the reactor as a function of reaction temperature during the PROX reaction in the presence of acetaldehyde is shown in Fig. 14 . The CO concentration was reduced from 200ppm (inlet composition) to less than 10ppm at temperatures between 425 and 450K over the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 14a). However, the CO levels begin to increase above 450K, reaching values of around 680ppm at 525K, which is much higher than the CO composition of the feed. This result suggests that CO is somehow being produced during the reaction. The curve of CO concentration versus reaction temperature for 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 14b) was similar to the one observed for 1.5%Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 14a). The CO concentration decreases as temperature increases, reaching a minimum at 373K and then increases for higher temperatures. The lowest CO concentration is around 36ppm, which is higher than those values observed for 1.5%Pt/CeO2. These results can be associated with the higher activity of the 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst. At high temperatures, this catalyst also generated CO. Indeed, CO concentration at 523K is 50% higher relative to the CO composition of the feed. For 1.5%Pt/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 14a), methane, carbon dioxide and ethanol are the main products formed during the PROX reaction in the presence of acetaldehyde. Increasing temperature, the selectivity to methane increases continuously whereas the selectivity to ethanol remains approximately constant from 373 to 525K. The selectivity towards CO2 increases as temperature increases, achieving a maximum around 400K and then, it drops, leveling off at 425K. For 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 14b), the methane and CO2 selectivities increase and level off at around 373K, while ethanol was never detected in the temperature region studied. In order to better describe the behavior of acetaldehyde in the presence of hydrogen, some experiments were carried out by using a feed without oxygen (Fig. 15a and b). For both catalysts, the main products obtained were methane, CO and ethanol. Trace amounts of ethyl acetate and acetal were also detected in the low temperature region whereas a small quantity of ethane was detected at high temperatures. As the reaction temperature increased, the acetaldehyde conversion and the selectivity to CO and methane increased whereas the selectivity towards ethanol decreased. It is noteworthy that the CO and methane selectivity are very similar, for both catalysts, suggesting that they are generated by the same reaction. Indeed, the decomposition or decarbonylation of acetaldehyde leading to methane and carbon monoxide is thermodynamically feasible under these reaction conditions (ΔH 298K =−54.4kJmol−1). This reaction is described in the literature for some homogenous catalysts and also for nickel and palladium based heterogeneous catalysts [48,49]. Therefore, two main reactions may be considered in this case, the acetaldehyde hydrogenation to ethanol and the acetaldehyde decomposition to CO and methane. Therefore, the high CO concentration observed at high temperatures during the PROX reaction in the presence of acetaldehyde (Fig. 14a and b) may be attributed to acetaldehyde decomposition. In addition, the CO2 produced comes not only from the CO present in the feed but mainly from the CO formed during the acetaldehyde decomposition. It is noteworthy that the CO2 selectivity reaches a maximum at 397K and then decreases during the PROX reaction in the presence of acetaldehyde over 1.5%Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 14a). In order to understand this behavior, the reaction was stopped at 523K and the catalyst was heated under N2. At 773K, the evolution of large amount of CO2, showing that carbonates were present on the catalyst surface. This result suggests that the decrease in CO2 selectivity may be attributed to the reaction between CO2 and CeO2 and the formation of carbonates [50]. Comparing the acetaldehyde conversion in the presence and absence of oxygen, at temperatures above 398K (Figs. 14 and 15), it is clear that oxygen favored the acetaldehyde decomposition reaction. In fact, the CO oxidation during the PROX reaction shifts the equilibrium of the acetaldehyde decomposition reaction. A comparison between the ethanol selectivity in Fig. 15a and b (the acetaldehyde reaction without O2) suggests that 1.5%Pt/CeO2 is much more active for the hydrogenation reaction than 1.5%Pt/Al2O3. This result may explain the absence of ethanol formation over 1.5%Pt/Al2O3 during the PROX reaction in the presence of acetaldehyde. In addition, from Fig. 14a and b, it is clear that the selectivity to methane is always higher than the selectivity to CO2, suggesting that methane might also be synthesized by CO or CO2 methanation. This result is now under investigation. Taking into account these results, the following reaction mechanism could be proposed to explain the PROX reaction in the presence of acetaldehyde (Scheme 4 ): (1) acetaldehyde decomposition to CO and methane; (2) acetaldehyde hydrogenation to ethanol; and (3) oxidation of CO to CO2."
17,Conclusions,"While 1.5%Pt/CeO2 was found to be a significantly more active catalyst than ceria alone for ethanol steam reforming, the catalyst was found to deactivate very rapidly. The mechanism of ethanol decomposition was probed by TPD and DRIFTS, while the mechanism of ethanol steam reforming was monitored by steady state DRIFTS. The mechanism of ethanol steam reforming was found to involve six main steps, including (1) dissociation of ethanol on partially reduced ceria to ethoxy species and a bridging OH group; (2) dehydrogenation of the ethoxy species to acetaldehyde; (3) oxidation of acetaldehyde by mobile bridging OH groups to acetate; (4) water-promoted acetate demethanation to carbonate; and (5) carbonate decomposition to CO2 and, presumably (6) methane conversion steps. Pt was found to promote the hydrogen transfer and acetate demethanation steps. CO2 produced was also converted by a secondary reaction to CO. Steady state DRIFTS results indicated that there was a loss in the Pt active site density with time, probably by the buildup of carbon-containing species at the boundary between Pt and ceria, shutting down not only the metal-promoted pathway, but causing enough carbon overlayers to bring the conversion level well below that of unpromoted ceria. Since Pt assisted in demethanating acetate, loss of Pt sites caused not only the Pt–CO band to diminish, but the steady state inventory of acetate to increase (i.e., due to a lower turnover rate). This contribution reports, for the first time, H2 purification in the presence of acetaldehyde since it was found to be an important by-product from ethanol steam reforming over unpromoted CeO2. Methane, carbon dioxide and ethanol were observed to be the main products. The steps for the PROX reaction in the presence of acetaldehyde included: (1) acetaldehyde decomposition to CO and methane; (2) acetaldehyde hydrogenation to ethanol; and (3) oxidation of CO to CO2. The CO2 produced by the PROX reaction was in some cases 8 times higher than the inlet CO concentration. As a result, it was evident that CO consumption generated by the oxidation shifted the equilibrium of the acetaldehyde decomposition reaction to favor product. The presence of this aldehyde in the H2 stream, even at low CO concentration, makes the H2 purification step more challenging."
