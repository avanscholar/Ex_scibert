0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been widely recognized as a clean renewable energy carrier with zero pollutant emissions [1,2]. Biological hydrogen production processes are found to be more environmental friendly and less energy intensive, as compared to thermo chemical and electro chemical process. Anaerobic dark fermentation technologies for recovering energy or methane gas from organic waste have been partially commercialized to treat food waste, sewage sludge and livestock waste water [3–5]. Fermentative hydrogen production includes the acidogenic biotransformation of organic material into by-products, such as volatile fatty acids (VFA), lactic acid and alcohols and this results in insignificant reduction of the organic content. A very promising method for the combined energy recovery is the sequential anaerobic production of hydrogen and methane [6–8]. The basic idea is the two - stage anaerobic digestion where hydrogen and methane production can take place in two separate bioreactors in series. The two - stage anaerobic digestion process has several advantages over the conventional single - stage process, since it permits the selection and the enrichment of different bacteria in each anaerobic digester and increase the stability of the whole process by controlling the acidification phase in the first digester and hence preventing the inhibition of the methanogenic population in the second digester. The economic feasibility of fermentative H2–CH4 production largely depends on the availability of organic waste/waste water as raw material. Most studies focus on the anaerobic treatment of agricultural by-products and municipal solid waste [9,10]. PPS (pulp & paper sludge) was seldom investigated to produce H2–CH4 as an industrial organic waste. As PPS contains proteins (22–52%), lignin (20–58%), carbon hydrates (0–23%), lipids (2–10%), and cellulose (2–8%) [11,12], biological treatment of PPS is gradually becoming the main management alternative instead of landfilling and incineration. In China, the yield of PPS was 998.2 × 104 t with 80% moisture content (MC) in 2009, which was the largest in the world, and it would increase 10% per year. PPS has become the most urgent problem to be solved for the pulp & paper industry. As is known, food waste (FW) is a classic organic waste for H2/CH4 production [13,14]. But sole FW digestion is easy to make VFA and NH3–N inhibition in the fermentation system due to lower pH (4–5) and C/N ratio (10–15) [15]. However, PPS was an alkaline substrate with high pH (7–8) and C/N ratio (30–35) (Table 1 ). Anaerobic co-digestion of PPS and FW was an effective way to obtain higher H2/CH4 yield in theory. The objective of this study was to investigate the fermentative production of hydrogen - methane from PPS and FW by a two-stage process in mesophilic–thermophilic batch reactors, respectively. The process parameters such as VFA, SCOD (soluble chemical organic demand), NH3–N, Na+ and alkalinity were measured, which indicated the capacity of H2/CH4 production and the stability of the fermentation system."
1,Material and methods,
2,Substrate preparation,"2.1 Substrate preparation PPS samples were collected from Guangzhou Pulp & Paper Plant in China. There are two processes in this plant: one is bleaching chemi-thermo-mechanical pulp (BCTMP) made from Masson pine; the other is papermaking from waste paper after de-inking. Waste water arises from three sections - pulping, papermaking and de-inking. The waste water is treated by activated sludge process in the pulp & paper plant. The sludge of primary and secondary clarifiers is collected together and then usually dewatered to (60–70) % moisture content at the end process of waste water treatment. PPS used in this test was the mixed sludge after dewatering. FW samples were collected from the Xin Yuan refectory of SouthChina Agricultural University, and crushed into small particles (1–2 mm). The chemical and physical characteristics of the PPS and FW were presented in Table 1. The methane seed sludge (CH4–SS) was obtained from the sewage tank near the Building 4 in SouthChina Agricultural University and was acclimatized with the mixture of PPS and FW at 1: 1 mass ratio in the laboratory for 3 months. The mixture was added to the sewage sludge step by step at the mass proportion of 2%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively, in a batch reactor. During the period of acclimation, methane production was measured and it was used to indicate the feeding time. In general, the methane production rose and then dropped after feeding in the anaerobic batch acclimating reactor. Another feeding would be carried out when the methane production just began to decrease from the peak value. And the acclimation was finished when the maximum methane production was achieved for the last feeding. For the hydrogen seed sludge (H2–SS) acclimatization, the solution with nutrients was added to the culture to meet the requirement for microbial growth (g L−1): NH4Cl 5, NH4HCO3 40, KH2PO4 13, MgSO4·7H2O 0.1, FeSO4 0.03, Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.01, CaCl2·2H2O 0.01, MnSO4·7H2O 0.015, NiCl2·6H2O 0.004. The mode of H2–SS acclimatization was similar to CH4–SS. All kinds of samples were collected prior to the experiment, stored in the refrigerator (0–4 °C) and analyzed for the total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and pH according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste water [16]."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up 6 lab-scale digesters were performed in this work according to the reactor design shown as Fig. 1 . All reactors, 1 L capacity with 800 mL worked, had a gas-tight rubber stopper with an outlet equipped with hydrogen (or methane) collection and flushed with N2 for 5 min to remove oxygen from the headspace and maintained an anaerobic environment. The reactors were put into a water bath which was connected to a thermostatically controlled flow heater. All reactors were shook by hand several times per day to assure the sufficient mixing of the feedstock. To remove CO2, NH3 and H2O produced, 3% NaOH solution was filled in the gas - collecting bottle. The hydrogen (or methane) produced displaced a measurable volume of NaOH solution from the gas-collecting bottle, which was equivalent to the hydrogen (or methane) volume. So the volume of hydrogen (or methane) from each reactor could be determined by a measuring cylinder, which was connected to the gas-collecting bottle [17,18]."
4,Experiments for hydrogen and methane production,"2.3 Experiments for hydrogen and methane production Reactors with 1 L (0.8 L worked) volume were used for hydrogen production under the mesophilic condition (37 °C). The reactors were inoculated with a hydrogen-producing culture obtained from the seed sludge filtering with 1 mm sieve and then boiling for 15 min at 100 °C. Six kinds of mixture (PPS and FW) with different VS ratios were set up in this study. Each feedstock (PPS, FW, H2–SS, nutrient solution (the same with Section 2.1) and water) was filled in the reactor as substrate with the dosage of H2–SS at 10% of TSsubstrate in the first fermentation phase (Table 2 ). The mixture was diluted to 800 mL and the pH value was adjusted to 5.5 to produce hydrogen. Each reactor was connected according to the experimental equipment set-up and then put into the water bath. After N2 flushing, the hydrogen fermentation began. After hydrogen production terminated, the total effluent from the first phase added with the methane seed sludge (CH4–SS) at the dosage of 10% of TSsubstrate (Table 2), with pH adjusted to 7.0, was used as substrate for the second fermentation phase to produce methane. The reactors for methane production were under the thermophilic condition (55 °C). The operational mode of the methanogenic reactor was turned similarly as in hydrogenogenic reactor. The biogas samples in the first phase and the second phase were taken at intervals of 6 h and 1 d, respectively, and the liquor samples were taken at 12 h and 3 d intervals, respectively."
5,Analytic methods,"2.4 Analytic methods The volume of hydrogen/methane produced was recorded by water displacement equipment. The routine parameters of TS, VS, pH, SCOD, NH3–N, Na+ and alkalinity were determined according to the standard methods [16]; there into, SCOD were measured by potassium dichromate method; VFA were analyzed by distillation-titration method and the result were expressed in acetic acid; pH was measured using a pHS-3c (Shanghai Hongyi Instrumentation Factory, China) acidity meter; NH3–N was measured by Nessler’s reagent colorimetric method; Na+ was analyzed using flame photometry; alkalinity was determined by double indicator-titration method."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Biogas production,"3.1 Biogas production The yields of hydrogen which were produced in the hydrogenogenic reactors were presented in Fig. 2 a. At the early stage of fermentation (0–36 h), the hydrogen yield increased obviously, and 80%–90% hydrogen production was obtained for each reactor. For reactor T1–T6, the accumulative hydrogen yield was 2.294 mL g−1 VSfed, 36.49 mL g−1 VSfed, 64.48 mL g−1 VSfed, 63.9 8 mL g−1 VSfed, 29.38 mL g−1 VSfed, and 52.89 mL g−1 VSfed, respectively. The sequence of hydrogen yield was in the rank of T3 > T4 > T6 > T5 > T2 > T1. The hydrogen yield in reactor T3 (VS ratio of PPS to FW = 1: 1) was 271.1% higher than that in reactor T1 (sole PPS fermentation) and 54.4% higher than that in reactor T5 (sole FW fermentation). The hydrogen yield of this study (64.48 mL g−1 VSfed) was higher than that (55.4 mL g−1 VSfed) obtained by Li et al. [19], which produced hydrogen with municipal solid waste, and that (36.6 mL g−1 VSadded) got by Wang et al. [20] which loaded the hydrogenogenic reactor with swine manure. It indicated that anaerobic co-digestion of PPS and FW was beneficial for the hydrogen production and the 1: 1 VS ratio of PPS to FW was best. Compared reactor T3 with T6, the hydrogen yield in T3 was 21% higher than that in T6, which showed the application of the solution with nutrients was important for the hydrogenogenic bacteria. The methane yields which produced in the methanogenic reactors were presented in Fig. 2b. The methane yield increased distinctly at the early stage of fermentation (0–18 d), and 80–93% hydrogen production was obtained in reactor T3, T4, T6 and T2, respectively. The highest methane yield of 432.3 mL g−1 VSfed occurred in reactor T3, which was 66.99% higher than that in reactor T1 and 88.20% higher than that in reactor T5, as well as 37.3% higher than that (270.9 mL g−1 VSfed) got by Li et al. [19] and 53.3% higher than that (201.7 mL g−1 VSadded) attained by Wang et al. [20]. It indicated that co-digestion of PPS and FW with 1: 1 VS ratio could also improve the methane production in the second phase due to the optimal characteristics of the mixing substrate for fermentation. Additionally, the hydrogen yield of reactor T5 was higher than that of reactor T1 in the first phase, but the methane yield of reactor T5 was lower than that of reactor T1 in the second phase. The main reason was that more easy biodegradable organics existing in FW than that in PPS [21]. Compared reactor T3 with T6, the methane yield in reactor T3 was only 6.3% higher than that in reactor T6. Taking the hydrogen yields in reactor T3 and T6 into consideration, it indicated that the added nutrients would greatly affect the hydrogenesis instead of methanogenesis. The possible reason was that there were more useful nutrients contained in the effluent after the first fermentation and the anaerobes had strong acclimatization to use the nutrients in the second fermentation phase."
8,Organics removal,"3.2 Organics removal SCOD represents for the biodegradable organics content of the substrate. SCOD removal efficiency is a parameter that represents the degree of hydrolysis and solubilization achieved by the acidogenic bacteria. In this work, the SCOD concentrations of each reactor decreased obviously in the second phase (methane fermentation stage), except for reactor T5 mainly due to the worse conditions (lower pH and alkalinity) for the bacteria growth, but the SCOD concentrations increased on hours 0–24 and then decreased slowly until to the end of hydrogen production in the first phase (hydrogen fermentation stage) (Fig. 3 ). As SCOD was derived from the hydrolysis of macromolecular compounds in the substrate, and it was consumed by the acidogenesis simultaneously. At the early stage of the first phase (0–24 h), hydrolysis function was more intense and then the consumption of SCOD was greater than the production until to the end of digestion. This result was in agreement with Kim et al. [22]. As was shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), more FW applied in the reactor, higher SCOD concentration appeared in the effluent. The reason was that the macromolecular compounds (e. g.: starch, sugar) in FW were easier to be degraded than those (e. g.: cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) in PPS. After hydrogen and methane fermentation, the SCOD removal efficiency in each reactor was great except for reactor T5, which was 74% (reactor T1), 71% (reactor T2), 87% (reactor T3), 86% (reactor T4) and 86% (reactor T6), respectively. They are higher than that (64%) got by Zhu et al. [9] in which hydrogen and methane was co-produced from potato waste using a two - stage mesophilic anaerobic digestion process. The SCOD removal efficiencies in this study were higher due to the optimal material for fermentation and the thermophilic condition for the methane production. VFA also represents for the biodegradable organics in the substrate. VFA concentration represents for the balance among hydrolysis, acidogenesis, hydrogenogenesis and methanogenesis. In the early stage of the first phase (0–36 h, Fig. 4 a), the VFA concentrations increased from 2031 mg L−1 to 8447 mg L−1 in average, except for reactor T1 and T5, which indicated that the acidogenesis was more intense than hydrogenogenesis; on hours 36–72, the VFA concentrations were stable, which meant the balance between acidogenesis and hydrogenogenesis was reached. For reactor T1 and T5, the VFA concentrations were almost lower than 3000 mg L−1 and the VFA concentrations changed only a little in the total stage of hydrogen–methane fermentation (Fig. 4a), which was similar to the results of SCOD concentrations and biogas production in these two reactors. The main reason was that acidosis occurred in reactor T5 due to lower pH (less than 4.0, Fig. 5 ) and more difficult biodegradable organics existing in PPS in reactor T1. In the second phase of methane fermentation (Fig. 4b), VFA concentrations in reactor T2, T3, T4 and T6 increased on days 0–3, and decreased obviously on days 4–18, then keeping a smooth decrease until to the end of methane production. The reason was that there were unbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis in the former methane fermentation stage and the balance formed in the latter stage. The change rule was in agreement with other authors [23,24]. For reactor T3, the VFA concentrations increased from 2002 mg L−1 to 10,943 mg L−1 in the first phase, and then decreased from 11,502 mg L−1 to 1008 mg L−1 in the second phase. Taking the data of biogas production per day and the result obtained by Wang et al. [20] into consideration, there was a little VFA inhibition at the end of hydrogen fermentation and the beginning of the methane fermentation in reactor T3. But the inhibition effect weakened when methanogenesis start up and disappeared on day 5 when VFA concentration was lower than 10,000 mg L−1, because the bacteria could adjust themselves to the environment due to the better mixing ratio of PPS and FW to get the better alkalinity for the process stability, which was consistent with the highest biogas yield obtained in reactor T3."
9,Stability of fermentation process,"3.3 Stability of fermentation process The fermentative microorganism can function in a wider range of pH value between 4.0 and 8.5 [25]. The hydrogenogenic bacteria best work in the pH value of 5.5–6.0, and the methanogenic bacteria best grow in the pH value of 6.8–7.2 [26]. The pH values in this experiment remained in the range of 4.8–6.8 in the hydrogen fermentation stage (except for reactor T5: 3.7–6.0) and 6.3–8.8 in the methane fermentation stage (except for reactor T5: 4.0–6.9) (Fig. 5). Sole FW filled in reactor T5 caused lower pH and acidosis in the process [15]. The pH curves of six reactors were similar, dropping on hours 0–12 and then keeping stable on hours 13–72 in the first phase, as well as dropping on days 0–3 and then rising on days 4–21 in the second phase, which was related to the variation of VFA concentrations. That is, more VFA concentrations, lower pH values. So the change curves of pH values (Fig. 5) were exactly contrary to the VFA curves. For reactor T3, the pH values were in the range of 5.6–6.0 for the hydrogen fermentation and 6.8–8.8 for the methane fermentation, which were suitable for the growth of hydrogenogenic bacteria and methanogenic bacteria, respectively. pH values cannot be an effective measure of the stability of an anaerobic process when there is a high buffering capacity. Small changes in pH occur when there are large changes in process performance [27]. Under this condition, alkalinity is used to reflect the process performance directly. The alkalinity of a steady process is between 1000 and 5000 mg CaCO3 L−1 [28]. In this study (see Fig. 6 ), the alkalinities of reactor T2, T3, T4 and T6 increased from 794 mg CaCO3 L−1 to 3316 mg CaCO3 L−1 in average on hours 0–24 in the hydrogen fermentation stage, and kept stable on hours 25–72; on hour 12, the alkalinities of these reactors rose upward to 1000 mg CaCO3 L−1, which showed the process became stable after 12 h. The alkalinities of these four reactors kept stable with the average value of 4165–4679 mg CaCO3 L−1 in the methane fermentation stage, and the average alkalinity of reactor T3 was 4103 mg CaCO3 L−1. It indicated that co-digestion of PPS and FW had the advantage of process stability on account of the appropriate alkalinity. As for reactor T1 and T5, the alkalinities were all lower in the total stage of hydrogen - methane fermentation, because there were no abundant bicarbonate, hydrate and carbonate in the reactor when sole material (PPS or FW) was loaded, and the activities of the hydrogenogenic bacteria and methanogenic bacteria were weak to produce alkalinity with the above substrates [29]."
10,Poisoning factors,"3.4 Poisoning factors Ammonia is produced during the degradation of nitrogenous matter, mainly proteins and urea [30,31]. Ammonium (NH4 +) and free ammonia (NH3) are the two most predominant forms of inorganic nitrogen present. It has been indicated that it (free ammonia) is the most toxic of both, due to the fact that it can pass through the cell membrane and into the cell, causing proton imbalance and potassium deficiency [31,32]. However, ammonia concentrations below 200 mg/L are beneficial to anaerobic digestion because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for the micro-organisms [33]. Free ammonia of 560–568 mg NH3–N/L can cause a 50% inhibition of methanogenesis, but the acclimated methanogens could tolerate concentrations up to 2000 mg NH3–N/L without inhibition [32]. In the hydrogen fermentation stage of this experiment, the ammonia concentrations in each reactor (except for T1) decreased from 1519 mg L−1 to 1118 mg L−1 in average on hours 0–12 (Fig. 7 a), and then kept stable until to the end of hydrogen production. The ammonia concentrations in reactor T1 increased on hours 0–12 due to sole PPS fermentation. And higher NH3–N concentrations occurred when the VS ratio of FW to PPS increased. The possible reason was that more proteins, urea, and nitrate existed in FW and they were easier decomposed into NH3–N by hydrogenogenic bacteria in anaerobic condition. The ammonia concentrations in reactor T6 were lowest in the hydrogen fermentation stage due to the inactive bacteria without nutrients, but they increased in the methane fermentation stage due to the bacteria acclimatization, which was in accordance with the result of biogas (hydrogen/methane) yields in reactor T6. The ammonia concentrations in each reactor were in the range of 400–1900 mg L−1 in the hydrogen fermentation stage, which was lower than 2000 mg L−1. The result showed no NH3–N inhibition happened in the stage of hydrogen production. In the methane fermentation stage, the ammonia concentrations increased from 1157 mg L−1 to 2008 mg L−1 in average on days 0–3 due to the further decomposition of protein and urea by methangenic bacteria, and then kept stable with 1918 mg L−1 in average on days 4–24 (Fig. 7b). For reactor T3, the ammonia concentrations were in the range of 1326 mg L−1 to 2033 mg L−1 on days 0–20, which meant there was no NH3–N poison in the main phase of methane production. For reactor T4 and T6, the ammonia concentrations were obvious higher than 2000 mg L−1 to inhibit the activity of methanogenic bacteria. This was one of the reasons why the methane yield in reactor T3 was higher than those in reactor T4 and T6. Na+ is a necessary element for the form of cell. Suitable Na+ concentration is better for the metabolism of microorganism. For anaerobe, Na+ concentration of 100–200 mg L−1 could cause activation of hydrogenogenesis and methanogenesis and 3500–5500 mg L−1 could cause 50% inhibition, as well as more than 8000 mg L−1 could cause serious poison [34]. As was shown in Fig. 8 , the Na+ concentrations in each reactor changed only a little in the hydrogen and methane fermentation stage, respectively. In the first phase of hydrogen fermentation, the Na+ concentrations were in the range of 350–1243 mg L−1, which did not cause any inhibition to the hydrogenogenesis. The Na+ concentrations in reactor T5 were the highest in the total phase of hydrogen-methane fermentation, and those in reactor T4 were the second. The reason was that more Na+ existing in FW due to the food character in China [35,36]. In the second phase of methane fermentation, the Na+ concentrations in reactor T4 and T5 were higher than 2000 mg L−1, but lower than 3500 mg L−1, which meant a little inhibition of Na+ (less than 50%) might occur in these two reactors. However, the Na+ concentrations in reactor T3 were in the range of 1386–1423 mg L−1, which was lower than 1500 mg L−1. This was another reason why biogas H2/CH4 production in reactor T3 was higher than those in reactor T4 and T5."
11,Conclusion,"Six reactors were employed to evaluate the hydrogen–methane productivity when different VS ratio of PPS to FW was applied in a two-stage mesophilic–thermophilic process. In comparison with previous studies, it has been shown that the hydrogen - methane co-production reactors were successfully operated with the maximum hydrogen yield of 64.48 ml g−1 VSfed and methane yield of 432.3 ml g−1 VSfed. The 1: 1 VS ratio of PPS to FW was the best mixing substrate for the hydrogen and methane production. In conclusion, the two-stage mesophilic–thermophilic process proved to be a stable, reliable and effective way for energy recovery and stabilization treatment of PPS and FW."
