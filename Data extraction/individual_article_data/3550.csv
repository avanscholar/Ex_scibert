0,Introduction,"With the progress of the times, the development of green energy has gradually occupied people’s attention [1–3]. The exploration of renewable energy can not only deal with the growing energy crisis but beneficial to reduce the environmental burden [4,5]. Solar energy, as one of many green energy sources, has gradually come to the fore because of the abundant reserves, the same sure is true of hydrogen energy [6,7]. How to achieve efficient energy conversion from solar to hydrogen has already become a hot topic discussed by many researchers since photocatalysis was first reported in 1972 [8]. High photogenic charge separation ability and wide light absorption range are all vital factors for the photocatalytic process [9,10]. To meet these requirements to improve the catalytic performance, constructing heterojunction or compound materials and shorten effective charge transfer distance is a restful means [11–13]. In addition to this, the S-scheme heterojunction possesses better performance compared to the traditional type-II structure, which not only could greatly extend extends light absorption region, accelerates charge transfer and separation ability, but effective utilization more efficient redox potential in the composite photocatalyst [14–16]. With the rise of the construction of multivariant metal sulfide semiconductor, CdxZn1-xS developed based on CdS, the typical semiconductor materials, gradually attracted the researches attention due to its better performance than CdS [17–19]. In order to further investigated the catalytic performance of CdxZn1-xS, morphological regulation was adopted, such as CdZnS nanorods [20], ZnCdS quantum [21], hollow ZnCdS dodecahedral cages [22] and CdZnS nanoparticles [23]. Among them, the 0D nanoparticle has a short charge migration distance which is beneficial for the transfer of photogenic charges [24,25]. Moreover, the construction of different heterojunction is another effective way to improve its photocatalytic performance [26,27]. Lately, because of the narrow bandgap and low-cost, the other non-noble metal sulfide CoxSy has also revealed good promise in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution filed [28–30]. In addition to this, compared with crystal catalysts, amorphous catalysts tend to have higher catalytic activity site density, good corrosion resistance, and a wider range of electronic structure regulation [31,32]. These qualities are undoubtedly positive for photocatalytic, but the small specific surface area and poor stability still is the urgent problems that need to be solved. In this work, the synthesized Co9S8 is just such an amorphous catalyst [33–35]. Influenced by these works, via simple one-step hydrothermal method loaded 0D Co9S8 nanodots on the surface of 0D CdxZn1-xS nanoparticles to constructed an S-scheme heterojunction was proposed. The successful load of Co9S8 nanodots is proved by a series of characterization experiments, and the composites CdxZn1-xS/x%Co9S8 show higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Whereafter, the inner reason for the enhanced H2 release competence was further explored via a sequence of characterization experiments."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts 2.1.1 Preparation of CdxZn1-xS Keep the molar ratio of C4H6ZnO4·2H2O and C4H6CdO4·2H2O at 1:1, add 50 mL of deionized water, and then add excess thioacetamide as the sulfur source, keep the molar ratio of C4H6ZnO4·2H2O to thioacetamide at 1:2.5 to ensure that it can be fully sulfuration. Stir with the magnetic force for 30 min until the added chemicals completely dissolve to form a homogeneous solution and then slowly added 10 mL 4 M NaOH solution. Then stir for another 1 h until the solution is evenly mixed again, transferred above solution into a 100 mL autoclave, keep 24 h at 180°. Centrifugal collection, washing with DI water and ethyl alcohol, dry for 8 h at 80 until the moisture is completely removed, ground into a fine powder. The above sample prepared by the hydrothermal method is named CdxZn1-xS, which is abbreviated as CZS. 2.1.2 Preparation of CdxZn1-xS/x%Co9S8 At first, 0.1 g CZS was weighted and dispersed into 30 mL DI water. Ultrasonic treatment of the mixture solution for 10 min and then added 40 mg cobaltous acetate. Continuous stirring for 30 min until cobaltous acetate dissolved completely. After that, keep the Co/S molar ratio as 1:5, dissolved the appropriate amount of Na2S in 10 mL deionized water, stirred continuously until completely dissolved, and then added the solution to the above solution drop by drop. Continuously stirred the solution for another 30 min until formed the homogeneous solution. Transfer the above solution to a 100 mL autoclave, keep it at 100 °C for 24 h. Centrifugally clean the obtained sample with deionized water and ethanol, dry, and grind into a fine powder. With the same method, the composites of different weight ratios were obtained, 15 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %. Bare Co9S8 was also obtained under the same condition without added the CZS [36]."
3,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production Add 10 mg of the prepared catalyst into a 62 mL reaction flask, and then add 30 mL of a 10 % lactic aqueous solution as a sacrificial reagent. Disperse ultrasonically for 10 min until the added catalyst is evenly dispersed in the solution. Subsequently, replace the air in the bottle with nitrogen as the carrier gas for 10 min until the air in the bottle is completely replaced by nitrogen to form an anaerobic environment. After the nitrogen replacement is completed, put the reaction into a multi-channel system for hydrogen production reaction (PCX50A Discover, Perfectlight, Beijing) and the simulated light source is a 5 W LED. During the H2 production process, the gas in the bottle is drawn 0.5 mL every hour and its hydrogen content is analyzed by gas chromatography (Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13X column, nitrogen as the carrier). 5 h is 1 cycle, the hydrogen production stability test was carried out for 4 cycles, namely 20 h. After each cycle, replace the gasket used in the reaction flask to ensure good airtightness of the system and replace the gas in the flask with N2 for 10 min until the gas in the flask is completely replaced. During this process, no fresh sacrificial reagent or catalyst is added."
4,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements The saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode, the Pt electrode was used as the counter electrode and the ITO glass with a coating area of (1 × 1 cm2) was used as the working electrode for electrochemical testing in an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT4-400, AMETEK). The specific preparation process of the working electrode is as follows: The working electrode is prepared as follows: ultrasonically disperse 5 mg of the prepared catalyst in 10 μL Nafion solution, and then coat the conductive side of the ITO glass dropwise. Let stand for 6 h until the sample is completely dry. In the electrochemical test process, use a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter as the light source and the electrolyte was Na2SO4 solution (0.2 M). And the electrochemical characterization tests performed are as follows: Transient photocurrent response curve (i–t, 0.2 V vs. SCE), impedance spectroscopy (EIS, 0.2 V vs. SCE), linear cyclic voltammetry curve (LSV -0.6 V to 0 V vs. SCE), and Mott-Schottky (M–S, -1 V to 1 V vs. SCE)."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization TEM (transmission electron microscope, Tecnai G2-TF30) is used to explore the surface morphology of the obtained sample with the accelerating voltage 5.0 kV and 300 kV, severally. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation was used to analyze the N2 adsorption and desorption curve of the sample tested at 77k (ASAP 2020 M), and the results were used to analyze the specific surface area of the comparative sample. In addition, the pore size distribution curve is analyzed using the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCALAB 250Xi). X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the sample was performed at a tube voltage of 40 kV and a tube current of 40 mA, and the scan rate was 10° per minuter (Cu Kα radiation, Rigaku RINT-2000). The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection (UV–vis DRS, UV-2550 (Shimadzu)), photoluminescence spectrum (PL), and transient fluorescence (TRPL) spectra of the obtained samples were all performed (FluoroMAX-4 spectrometer (Horiba, France))."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Surface structure characteristic analysis,"3.1 Surface structure characteristic analysis 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction analysis Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of bare CZS, Co9S8, and different ratio composites. As exhibits in Fig. 1a, which depicts the XRD pattern of CZS and Co9S8. The diffraction peaks of CZS were concentrated at the range of 20° to 60°. And all the peaks which belongs to CZS exist obvious shift compared to bare ZnS (JCPDS#65-1691) and CdS (JCPDS#65-2887), this phenomenon elucidated that the CZS prepared in this work is a compound of CdS and ZnS, but the lattice of both them has a certain degree of cross-linking. Among them, the characteristic peak belonging to CdS appears a certain degree of right shift, while on the contrary and the situation of ZnS is the opposite. In addition, the XRD pattern elucidated that Co9S8 was an amorphous compound. Except for bare CZS and Co9S8, Fig. 1b displayed the XRD pattern of different ratio composites. It is precise because of this amorphous nature of Co9S8 that no characteristic peak belonging to Co9S8 is found in the XRD pattern of composite catalyst. However, compared with pure CZS, the characteristic peak's intensity which belong to CZS were significantly reduced followed by the increase weight ration of Co9S8 in the composites. This result may due to the attachment of tiny Co9S8 on the surface of CZS nanoparticles that influenced its crystallization performance and finally manifests itself in the reduced characteristic peak intensity. 3.1.2 Transmission electron microscopy As exhibited in Fig. 2 , the morphological features of obtained catalysts were explored via the TEM. It could be discovered that the CZS nanoparticles show an obvious bigger size than tiny Co9S8 nanodots, which could provide a good attachment site for it. In addition, the tiny Co9S8 nanodots exist in the gaps between the particles, which effectively retards the agglomeration of CZS particles and makes them effectively dispersed. This result could be seen clearly from Fig. 2a and b. Compared bare CZS which shown in Fig. 2a, the CZS nanoparticles in the CZS/40Co9S8 composite are significantly more dispersed due to the presence of Co9S8 that could be seen from Fig. 2b. HRTEM and SAED images show a more explicit crystal state of the CZS/40Co9S8 in Fig. 2c and d. As depicts in Fig. 2c, the measured electron diffraction mode of CZS/40Co9S8 could notice palpable bright and circularly distributed spots, this result demonstrated that the composite of CZS/40Co9S8 is a polycrystalline crystal structure [37]. Moreover, Fig. 1 could be learned that the XRD pattern of CZS shows the phenomenon of intertwining crystal lattices between CdS and ZnS. The Co9S8 shows typical characteristics of an amorphous structure. Such results match well with the image of Fig. 2d, which could be easy to perceive the amorphous Co9S8 nanodots and CZS nanoparticles with certainly lattice faces. The obvious lattice distance is 0.33 nm and 0.27 nm which could be ascribed to the (111) and (200) crystal faces of CdS and ZnS, severally. Furthermore, from the insert enlarged picture of Fig. 2c, the enlarged partial view validate the phenomenon of intertwining crystal lattice with clarifying cross-linked lattices. While, EDX image of CZS/40Co9S8 in Fig. 2e demonstrated the coexist of Cd, Zn, Co, and S elements, that more powerful than the XRD results to prove the successful composite of CZS and Co9S8. 3.1.3 Specific surface areas analysis Fig. 3 exhibits the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of CZS, Co9S8, and CZS/40Co9S8, which were used for analyzed corresponding specific surface area, one of the influential factors for measure the photocatalytic H2 production activity. Both of them show typical IV type isotherms, this validated the presence of the mesopores produced during the hydrothermal process [38]. Moreover, the hysteresis loops depicted in Fig. 3 have no obvious saturated adsorption platform, indicating that they were H3 hysteresis loops, which means that the pore structure is not enough regular. It can be seen from the insert pictures in Fig. 3a, b, and c that the pore diameter of the tested samples are concentrated in the range of 2−50 nm, which proved the existence of mesoporous structure. The average pore size of CZS, Co9S8, and CZS/40Co9S8 are 28 nm, 21 nm, 20 nm, separately in Table 1 . The reason for the decrease in the pore size of the composite may be that the small Co9S8 nanoparticles block the pores in the CZS. Besides that, the specific surface areas of the CZS/40Co9S8 composites (26 m2 g-1) also decreased compared to bare CZS (28 m2 g-1) and Co9S8 (38 m2 g-1). Besides, the pore volume of the composite CZS/40Co9S8 (0.13 cm3 g−1) also decreased than bare CZS (0.19 cm3 g-1) and Co9S8 (0.20 cm3 g-1). Although the specific surface area of CZS/40Co9S8 is reduced, its hydrogen production activity is still significantly better than bare CZS, which indicates that there must be a reason for the advantage of specific surface area to greatly increase its hydrogen production activity. For example, the construction of a heterojunction between them. 3.1.4 XPS analysis XPS was used as one of the effective tools to detect the chemical state of each element. In Fig. 4 a, two obvious characteristic peaks are detected in the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd 3d in CZS, the peaks appeared at 404.41 eV and 411.14 eV could ascribe to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, severally. In comparison with pure CZS, the peak over CZS/40Co9S8 shifts to a higher binding energy position, which appeared at 404.86 eV and 411.62 eV. Furthermore, a similar phenomenon also occurs in Fig. 4b, for pure CZS, the signals of Zn 2p also could observe two distinct typical peaks, the peak appeared at 1021.44 eV is corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and the other peak which located at 1044.54 eV is assigned to Zn 2p1/2. In the composite of CZS/40Co9S8, the binding energy about Zn 2p higher (Zn 2p3/2: 1021.83 eV; Zn 2p1/2: 1044.87 eV) than pure CZS. The peak information of Cd 3d and Zn 2p are matched well with the related published literature [39]. Additionally, Fig. 4c exhibits the high-resolution S 2p XPS spectra of pure CZS and CZS/40Co9S8. In bare CZS, the S 2p spectra could be fitted into two peaks at 160.87 eV and 162.01 eV, the two peaks could attribute to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, severally [40]. In the composite of CZS/40Co9S8, the binding energy which belongs to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 shift to higher 161.30 eV and 162.47 eV. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p in Co9S8 and CZS/40Co9S8 are shown in Fig. 4d, which is related to two spin-orbit doublets. In Co9S8, the peaks that appeared at 778.76 eV and 781.90 eV are related to the Co 2p3/2, and the peak located at about 798.07 eV is corresponding with Co 2p1/2, this result demonstrated the co-exist of Co2+ and Co3+ [41–43]. And the other peaks located at 786.27 eV and 803.49 eV are satellite peaks [44]. Along with, compare to pure Co9S8, the related binding energy of Co 2p in CZS/40Co9S8 all show different degrees of left shift, which shift to 778.64 eV, 781.18 eV, 785.24 eV, 796.84 eV, and 803.05 eV, respectively. The shift in electron binding energy here powerfully illustrates the tight binding between CZS and Co9S8. Above XPS results confirmed the close combination between CZS and Co9S8 [13]. Undisputedly, this close contact helps to form a heterojunction and is beneficial to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process."
8,Photocatalytic H2 production performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production performance Fig. 5 a depicted the different amounts of hydrogen production of CZS, Co9S8, and CZS/40Co9S8. Among them, the H2 production performance of Co9S8 was negligible (0.56 μmol) and the CZS/40Co9S8 (978.5 μmol) approximately achieved 6 times higher than bare CZS with 170.9 μmol. This result validated the excellent co-catalyst properties of Co9S8. Broadly, all the composites showed an outperform hydrogen production activity than bare CZS and Co9S8 which could be seen more visualized from Fig. 5b. In the same condition, the total H2 production of CZS, CZS/15Co9S8, CZS/30Co9S8, CZS/40Co9S8, CZS/50Co9S8, CZS/60Co9S8 achieved 170.9 μmol, 498.9 μmol, 629.9 μmol, 978.5 μmol, 876.7 μmol, and 785.1 μmol, respectively. Followed by the increase of the weight percentage of Co9S8 in the CZS/Co9S8 composite, the H2 evolution performance of the composites also increased gradually until the ration attained CZS/40Co9S8. When continued increased the proportion of Co9S8 in the composite after its proportion attained 40 %, the H2 evolution activity of CZS/50Co9S8 and CZS/60Co9S8 was phanic decreased. This situation may because of the excessive Co9S8 participation in the process of light capture and competes with CZS, affected the light absorption competence of the composites, and finally conduced the drop of hydrogen production. Except for the photocatalytic H2 production activity, stability is the other very important factor for the photocatalytic performance. To validate the durability of the composite which has the best hydrogen evolution performance, the stability cycle test of CZS/40Co9S8 was brought and the results were exhibited in Fig. 5c. In the first cycle, the total H2 production of CZS/40Co9S8 achieved 978.5 μmol, and in the followed two cycles, its photocatalytic H2 evolution performance still has a slight increase until the fourth cycle, the second and third cycle attained 1005.3 μmol and 1054.2 μmol, severally. And the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance attained 878.1 μmol and 887.1 μmol respectively at the fourth and fifth cycle, which attained 90 % as much hydrogen as the first cycle. It is worth mentioning that in the whole cycle hydrogen evolution test process, no fresh sacrifice reagent was added. Besides, as shown in Fig. 5d, which exhibit the XRD pattern of CZS/40Co9S8 before and after hydrogen evolution process. It could easily observe that the typical peaks which belong to used CZS/40Co9S8 still retains well compared to fresh CZS/40Co9S8 after the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process. The hydrogen evolution test within a 25 h cycle test and the comparison of the XRD pattern before and after hydrogen evolution elucidated the excellent stability of CZS/40Co9S8."
9,Optical properties and energy band structure,"3.3 Optical properties and energy band structure 3.3.1 UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Mott-Schottky The ability to capture light is one of the conditions to evaluate the H2 production performance of photocatalysts. The optical performance of CZS, Co9S8, and CZS/40Co9S8 were measured via UV–vis DRS and the results are shown in Fig. 6 a for further explored the inner reason for the improved photocatalytic H2 production activity of composite catalysts. Co9S8 exhibited higher adsorption ability both in UV and visible light regions than bare CZS and CZS/40Co9S8 due to its intrinsic black color [23,36,37]. Besides, it could be seen from the Fig. 6a that the absorption band edge of pure CZS is approximately 525 nm, and the absorption edge of the CZS/40Co9S8 composite has a significant red shift (780 nm). This phenomenon means that compared with pure CZS, after the introduction of Co9S8, the composite exhibits a broader light absorption range. This result also proves the enhanced light capture ability of CZS/40Co9S8 compared with pure CZS. And the ameliorative optical performance may expedite the photocatalytic H2 generation. Fig. 6b exhibit the bandgap of CZS and Co9S8 which was obtained by the transforming function of Kubelka-Munk (1) [45]. The band gaps (Eg) of CZS and Co9S8 are calculated as 2.4 eV and 1.6 eV, respectively [46]. (1) α h v = A ( h v − E g ) n / 2 α - absorption coefficient; h - Plank’s constant; v represents light frequency; Eg - band-gap energy and A - a constant, respectively. Fig. 6c and d depicted the Mott-Schottky curves of Co9S8 and CZS, which not only elucidated the type of semiconductors but the flat band potentials (Efb). The slope of the Mott-Schottky curve for p-type semiconductors is negative, while for n-type semiconductors, the slope of the curve is positive. Apparently, the Mott-Schottky curves of CZS and Co9S8 all depicted a positive slope, which validated that they are n-type semiconductors. From this, the flat band potential of the obtained samples could be calculated by the followed formula (2). (2) 1 C 2 = 2 ( N D e ε ε 0 ) − 1 · ( E − E f b − k T / e ) C - the capacitance of the space charge region; ND - the charge carrier concentration; e - electron charge; ε - dielectric constant; ε0 - vacuum permittivity; E - electrode applied potential; Efb - flat band potentials; k - Boltzmann constant; T - absolute temperature. The Efb of Co9S8 and CZS is -1.28 V and -0.3 V, severally, that obtained from the intercept. Generally, the conduction band potential is more negative than the flat band potential (0.1 or 0.2 V) [47]. Thus, the conduction band (ECB) position of Co9S8 and CZS are approximately -1.48 V vs. SCE and -0.5 V vs. SCE (-1.24 V vs. NHE and -0.26 V vs. NHE, ENHE=ESCE+0.24) [48]. Furthermore, via the equation of EVB=ECB+Eg [49], the valence band (VB) position of Co9S8 and CZS could be estimated as 0.36 V vs. NHE and 2.14 V vs. NHE, severally, combining with the obtained Eg from Fig. 6a and b. 3.3.2 PL and TRPL spectra The photogenic charge separation efficiency of the resulting sample was explored via the photoluminescence spectra (PL), which also represent the recombination rate of photoinduced e−-h+ pairs. As exhibits in Fig. 7 , with the 400 nm excitation wavelength, the PL spectra of CZS and CZS/40Co9S8 both exhibit a clear peak at about 462 nm. Apparently, the PL intensity of CZS/40Co9S8 is lower than bare CZS, which elucidated that the photogenic e−-h+ pairs recombination of the composite is not as serious as CZS. This phenomenon presumably due to the introduction of Co9S8 effective managing severe electron-hole recombination. As depicted in Fig. 7b, for further investigation of the charge separation effect of the obtained samples, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were carried out. The emission decay profiles of CZS, Co9S8, and CZS/40Co9S8 can be fitted by a tri-exponential decay function (3). And the lifetimes are summarized in Table 2 . Among the obtained lifetimes, the average lifetime of the samples was obtained according to function (4) for further analyze the decay kinetics [50]. (3) I ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 B i exp ( − t / τ i ) I represents the normalised emission intensity; t represents the time after the pulsed laser excitation; Bi represents the amplitude (pre-exponential factor); τi represents the TRPL decay time. Among the different lifetimes, average lifetime of the samples were obtained according to function (4) to further analyze the decay kinetics. (4) τ = ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 B i τ i 2 / ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 B i τ i τ means the average lifetime; Bi means the amplitude (pre-exponential factor); τi means the TRPL decay time. It could be seen from Table 2 that the radiative process (τ2) of CZS/40Co9S8 (9.57 ns) is obviously longer than CZS (0.06 ns) and Co9S8 (0.12 ns), and a longer radiative process always means faster separation performance of photo-induce electrons [51,52]. In addition to this, the composite of CZS/40Co9S8 also shows fast decay kinetics (0.03 ns) compared to CZS (0.09 ns) and Co9S8 (0.04 ns), elucidate a faster photogenic electron transfer [53]."
10,Photoelectrochemical experiments,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical experiments The photo-induced charge transfer and separation performance is an important measurement index for measure the photocatalyst activity which was analyzed according to a series of photoelectrochemical experiments. Such as i–t, EIS, and LSV, which exhibit in Fig. 8 a, b, and c, severally. For investigating the separation property of photogenic e−-h+ pairs, the i–t test was proceeded under fitful illumination, all the samples revealed different degrees of light response and finally reflected in different photocurrent density. The composite of CZS/40Co9S8 shows the obvious highest photocurrent density than bare CZS and Co9S8 from Fig. 8a. Moreover, when continuous illumination, the photocurrent density of CZS/40Co9S8 shows a relatively smooth response, which elucidated that its photogenic e−-h+ pairs are separated well in this system [54]. This property will undoubtedly provide more electrons available for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, which is beneficial to the H2 production process. Usually, the semicircle of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy curves always reflects the magnitude of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of photogenic e−-h+ pairs. A smaller arc radius represents the smaller charge transfer resistance and the better electron-hole separation efficiency. As depicted in Fig. 8b, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy curve of CZS/40Co9S8 shows the smallest arc radius which elucidated that its electron transfer performance of CZS/40Co9S8 is outperformed both CZS and Co9S8 because of the reduced resistance in electron separation [55]. This result elucidated that the introduction of Co9S8 effectively improved the photogenic electrons separation performance that is helpful for the photocatalytic H2 production property. In addition to this, for investigated the H2 production kinetics on the surface of obtained samples under high current densities, the LSV curves are shown in Fig. 8c. Distinctly, the electrode of CZS/40Co9S8 displays higher current density under the same potential and lower H2 production overpotential under the same photocurrent density than bare CZS and Co9S8. This phenomenon illustrated that the electron transport efficiency of the CZS/40Co9S8 electrode is an advantage over the other two [56]."
11,Mechanism for photocatalytic H2 evolution,"3.5 Mechanism for photocatalytic H2 evolution The mechanism of the CZS/Co9S8 system was proposed and displayed in Fig. 9 based on the above characterization results. An S-scheme heterojunction mechanism between CZS and Co9S8 was proposed which not only can improve photogenerated charge transfer efficiency but reserve stronger redox ability. For CZS, a type of n-type semiconductors, the Fermi level is located near the position of conductive band (CB). When CZS and Co9S8 come into contact, their Fermi energy will tend to the uniform level, this tendency will cause an upward or downward shift in the Fermi levels. Concurrently, the e− on the CB of CZS will recombination with the h+ on the valance band (VB) of Co9S8 not only because of the Coulombic attraction but the band bending, retained more effective redox capacity [57]. In summary, the fabric of the S-scheme heterojunction between CZS and Co9S8 promotes the recombination of unnecessary photo-induced e−-h+ pairs, retains more strong redox ability, thus significantly enhanced the photocatalytic H2 production activity of this system. Moreover, small Co9S8 interacts with the larger CdxZn1-xS to increase the dispersion degree of each other. In summary, the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production performance could be ascribed to the co-act of improved light absorption ability, more reactive sites, and efficient transferability of photogenic carriers, likewise stronger reduction ability caused by the S-scheme heterojunction."
12,Conclusion,"Here, the larger-sized CZS particles provide good attachment sites for the smaller Co9S8 nanodots, and due to the existence of the small Co9S8 nanodots in the gap of CZS nanoparticles, the agglomeration of the CZS particles is blocked, so that the CZS particles are effectively dispersed. Moreover, the introduction of Co9S8 enhanced the light absorption ability of the composite because of its intrinsic black color, which allowing more optic energy to take part in the reaction. Furthermore, the construction of S-scheme heterojucntion between 0D CZS nanoparticles and 0D Co9S8 nanodots promotes unnecessary recombination of e−-h+ pairs, which not only accelerates the separation of photogenic charges, but also allows the system to retain stronger redox ability. Thus, the hydrogen evolution process finally shows obvious improved because of all the positive factors collective effect. A new idea for the application of narrow band-gap materials by construction S-scheme heterojunction between CdxZn1-xS and Co9S8 via simple hydrothermal method could proposed based on this work."
