0,Introduction,"Natural rubber (NR) is an organic material obtained from Hevea brasiliensis tree which is widely used as a raw material to produce polymer products [1]. There are numerous products that have been created using this material such as surgical equipment, biological-materials, clothing, insulations, rubber tires, rubber bands, sports items, etc [1,2]. The variety of products produced showed that this material plays an important role in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. This fact is also supported by the availability of abundance source of NR. As one of the major producers, Malaysia produced 821,274 tonnes average quantity of NR annually from 2010 to 2016. However, the average consumption was found lower approximately 55% only [3]. This condition lead to the drastic decrease in NR price in the mentioned year period [4]. As impact the land for NR plantation has been degraded and occupied for the other commodities which mainly dominated by palm oil, and as consequences it also affected the rubber farmers and environmental issue [5,6]. It is a challenge on how to ensure the high rubber consumption and products produced also have high demand in the market. In this regard, converting the NR into the intermediate product would be an interesting option. Basically, most of NR is directly utilized to produce the final product without involving the chemical conversion process [7]. Certainly, by converting NR into the intermediate product will open the new opportunity to break up the drawbacks of NR utilization. Chemical feedstock is one of examples of the intermediate product, it can be directly used and it can also be used to make other value-added products. The use of NR to produce chemical feedstock can be a step toward a more sustainable rubber industry. NR can be converted into valuable chemical commodities by thermal conversion processes. Among them, pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction are very well known processes. During the pyrolysis of NR, high temperature (400–600 °C) is required for the depolymerization of long chain polymeric compound to small hydrocarbons [1,8]. As a consequence, high temperature process requires high energy consumption thereby increasing the budget of the process. According to Farret and Simões, all processes that consume high energy for making a commodity become less economical and attractive [9]. The depolymerization can be conducted at lower temperature by manipulating other process parameters such as increasing the pressure, introducing the hydrogen gas, use of catalyst and use of solvent. However, there are a few difficulties related to the utilization of a catalyst, it is a consumable and so it increases the process expenses; catalyst have a small lifespan owing to its deactivation; the catalyst may lead to high level of solid deposit, thereby increasing the operational cost in terms of its separation and disposal [10]. Similarly, the use of hydrogen gas is expensive, also the hydrogen handling process involves safety aspect and considerable amount of complicated equipment. The use of solvent seems to be a positive approach as the solvent provides milder conditions for the degradation of organic matter to produce liquid products. This approach is actually used in the thermal liquefaction process under corresponding pressure condition. Many studies have shown that the role of solvent in this process can effectively help to liquefy the biomass with high liquid yield obtained [11–13]. Moreover, it also showed that the low temperature in the range of 250–400 °C was found to be enough to complete the process. In brief, Gollakota et al. concluded that the low operating temperature, high energy efficiency and low solid residue yield are the key features of hydrothermal liquefaction process, which make it more superior than that of pyrolysis [14]. Water is a common solvent used in hydrothermal liquefaction since it is cheap, abundant, polar in nature and non-hazardous [1,15,16]. However, water has some drawbacks as it results in low liquid yield and the oil products tend to have high oxygen contents, high corrosivity and high viscosity [13,17]. Durak has enlisted the features required for the selection of good solvent: non-acidic, high proticity, low boiling point, easily separable from the product, have low critical points and also improves the quality and quantity of oil [18]. Organic solvents such as acetone, decane, hexane and toluene are usually considered to be the good solvents for the production of bio oil from different biomasses. Jin et al. conducted the liquefaction of microalga biomass using sub/supercritical acetone. The result from their experimental work showed that the maximum bio-oil yield of 60 wt.% was achieved at 290 °C [11]. Also, the addition of acetone improved the HHV and reduced the viscosity in contrast to the bio-oil obtained from thermal liquefaction using water as a solvent [11]. Like acetone, decane was also investigated as an organic solvent in thermal liquefaction process. It was reported that the use of decane in hydrothermal liquefaction of Nannochloropsis sp. as a solvent gives high liquid yield of about 39% [19]. Sarwono and Pusfitasari performed the thermal liquefaction of palm oil empty fruit bunch at 350 °C using hexane and they were reported that hexane gave the conversion of 17–25.25 % [20]. Subsequently, Sarwono et al. also tried to use toluene to liquefy the palm oil empty fruit bunch at 350 °C and the result showed that higher conversion was found (35.76%) [13]. Hence most of the previous studies showed that organic solvents improved the liquid yield at lower temperatures. In order to obtain versatile family of compounds, there are also other types of organic solvent that can be employed for the thermal liquefaction process such as alcohols under supercritical conditions. The benefit of using alcohols as a solvent is that alcohols are good hydrogen donors which provide milder degradation environment to convert organic material into bio-oil [21]. Furthermore, alcohols in supercritical condition are more superior than subcritical water in the liquefaction process [22]. Also, due to the presence of hydrogen bonding (OH group), the separation of alcohol from oil is easy as compared to non-alcohol organic solvents. Thus, more exploration is needed on the use of alcohols as a solvent in hydrothermal liquefaction process for better conversion and yields. Currently, there is no literature available on the thermal liquefaction of NR using alcohol solvents. Therefore, the main objective of this current study is to perform the thermal liquefaction of NR using different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and propanol) to produce of value-added chemicals. The influence of diverse operating conditions such as temperature, alcohol to NR mass ratio and reaction time on product quantity were studied comprehensively. The role of alcohol solvent and its recovery process were also discussed in this report. In addition, the liquid product was analyzed through numerous analyzers to assess its quality."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The sample of NR used in this study was obtained from Malaysian Rubber Board. Particle size of NR was cutoff into small about 3–5 mm and it was then characterized by proximate and ultimate analyses, as well as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results of NR characterization were presented in previous published work [2]. It was showed that NR is sulfur free material with high carbon and hydrogen contents, which makes it a good potential source for the synthesis of chemicals as well as fuels. Furthermore, various organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol were used in this study obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The N2 gas with 99.99% purity was used to purge off the trapped air inside the autoclave to develop a non-reactive atmosphere."
3,Experimental method,"2.2 Experimental method The whole experimental system was manufactured by Amar equipment’s Pvt Ltd, Mumbai Maharashtra, India. An autoclave (SS 316) batch reactor with volume capacity of 1 liter was employed to conduct the thermal liquefaction experiment. Autoclave comprised of electrically heated furnace for heating it to desired temperatures. Methanol, ethanol and propanol were used as a reaction solvent in this investigation individually. The diagram of complete experimental setup and method of products separation were provided as supplementary material. The experimentation was conducted by feeding NR and organic solvent in the reactor, then sealed and purged with N2 gas to make the non-reactive atmosphere at 1.5 atm inside the reactor. The autoclave was heated electrically to reach the required temperature which was measured using K-type thermocouple. Since the experimentation was performed in a sealed reactor, the formation of warm gaseous product raised the pressure inside the autoclave. Subsequently, thermal liquefaction experimentation was exposed to autogenous pressure whose magnitude depend upon process temperature. Three different sets of experimental runs were conducted in current investigation for each solvent. First set of experimental runs were performed at various temperature settings within the range of 250 to 375 °C with the increment of 25 °C while keeping constant solvent/NR mass ratio (1:1) and time (30 min.). Second set of experimental runs were carried out by employing diverse solvent/NR mass ratios (solvent/NR = 0.5:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4) at temperature and time of 325 °C and 30 min. respectively. The last set of experimental runs were performed by changing the process time from 15 to 75 min. with the increase of 15 min. at 325 °C, and solvent/NR mass ratio of 1:1. The cooling coil system was employed to cool down the reactor to ambient temperature after the process was completed. After the completion of process, the autoclave was cooled to the room temperature by using chilling coils. The gaseous commodities were vented out and the liquid product was transferred to separating funnel where three layers were obtained comprising of solvent solution, oil, and heavy dense liquid in a very small amount. This heavy dense viscous liquid was considered as a tar. The solvent and oil were separated from the tar using a micropipette. The tar inside the funnel and reactor vessel was rinsed with solvent several times to ensure all of them were recovered. Alcohol was recovered from products by using rotary evaporator system (Büchi Rotavapor R-215) under reduced pressure at 45–50 °C. Collected tar was dried at the boiling point of each solvent used, and then quantified. The diagram of the whole process flow and product separation method has been in supplementary material. The key emphasis of current investigation was on oil and therefore only oil product was analyzed. Oil, tar, and gases were considered as the products from the liquefaction of NR, whereas the oil was considered as a key product. The gaseous products were not collected because of restrictions in experimental setup design. The oil and tar was collected and their weight were measured. The gaseous products were estimated by the calculating the difference. The yields of liquefaction products were calculated by using Eq. (1). (1) Y i e l d % = W e i g h t o f p r o d u c t W e i g h t o f N R × 100 The yield of gaseous products and other light end losses were projected by the difference: Gas + loss% = 100-(Oil yield + solid residue yield). All the experimental sets were replicated 3 times under the same settings to authenticate the experimental results."
4,Product characterization,"2.3 Product characterization Characterization is an important factor to assess the quality of produced liquid product. Normally, characterization is divided into two categories: Physical characterization and Chemical characterization. Physical characterization comprises of the determination of different physical properties such as density and viscosity. In current study, the density and viscosity of liquid products were estimated using a pycnometer and Brookfield viscometer respectively, and all measurements were conducted at ambient temperature of 26 °C. PerkinElmer CHNO/S, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GCMS) were used to determine the chemical properties of oil. PerkinElmer Frontier FTIR spectrometer was used to perform the FTIR spectroscopy of oil samples within the wavelength frequencies of 450–4500 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The ultimate analysis of oil products was conducted with CHNO/S analyzer model 2400 PerkinElmer. Elemental analysis data obtained from CHNO/S analyzer was used to compute the high heating value (HHV) using Dulong formula (Eq. (2)) [23]. (2) H H V M J k g = 0.338 C a r b o n + 1.428 H y d r o g e n - O x y g e n 8 + 0.095 S u l f u r The identification of various compounds present in oil were carried out using Shimadzu GCMS-2010 plus. The specification of capillary column and method for the analysis used in this study was same as it was used by Ahmad et al. in previous work [2]. Moreover, to minimize the edge of error and to produce more realistic and accurate results, each of the equipment that used for analysis has been calibrated and checked by using standards to obtain the accuracy of result measurement of every product from all experimentations."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Influence of process conditions on products,"3.1 Influence of process conditions on products 3.1.1 Influence of process temperature Three sets of experiments were performed using methanol, ethanol, and propanol in current investigation. For all solvents, solvent/NR mass proportion and time were kept constant at 1:1 and 30 min. respectively while, the process temperature was changed from 250 to 375 °C with the different corresponding pressures. The Fig. 1 (a), 1(b) and 1(c) show the effect of temperature on product yield with all solvents. It can be seen that the yield of liquid product was increased as the temperature increased from 250 to 325 °C. At 325 °C, the highest liquid yield obtained were 84.12 wt%, 85.98 wt%, and 89.53 wt% with methanol, ethanol, and propanol respectively. Whereas, previous study showed that the highest liquid yield of 76 wt% was obtained at optimum condition (375 °C, NR/H2O mass ratio = 1:3, 30 min) using water as a solvent [2]. From liquid yield values, it can be observed that there is slight difference between the liquid yields obtained using different alcohols. Further rise in process temperature does not showed any major positive influence on oil yield. The highest oil yield was obtained using propanol. It is because propanol donates more hydrogen as compared to methanol and ethanol which can be explained by solvolysis process and depolymerization of monomers into small molecules [24]. In contrast to liquid product, the yields of tar and gas + loss were obtained in low proportion. The yield of tar was observed reduced with the rise of temperature. With the highest liquid yield condition of 325 °C, the tar yield of 6 wt% was obtained using propanol. Different with tar, the gas + losses generally increased with the increasing of temperature. This increment in gas + losses yield was because of the cracking of liquid products as high temperature, where the same phenomena has been reported by other researchers [23,25]. At 325 °C, the gas + losses yield of 4.47 wt% was obtained for propanol. σ represents the standard deviation. Standard deviation of gas yield were not added as they were calculated by the difference 3.1.2 Influence of solvent to natural rubber (NR) mass ratio The influence of the different organic solvent/NR mass ratios was varied at 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 and the result showed in Fig. 2 (a), (b), and (c). However, the process time and temperature were kept constant at 30 min. and 325 °C respectively. Fig. 2(a) showed that the oil yield decrease linearly as the mass proportion of solvent raised from 1:1 to 4:1. When the mass ratio of solvent and NR is equal, the maximum liquid product (89.53 wt.%) was obtained by using propanol, while the liquid yields of 84.12 wt.% and 85.98 wt.% were obtained for methanol and ethanol, respectively. The increase of solvent ratio was tended to increase the yield of gas + losses, where, it can be seen clearly in Fig. 2(c). This phenomenon can be described by possible alkylation reactions between alcohols and liquefied NR intermediates [17]. It was reported that different types of alcohol would influence the product yield due to the changes in its dielectric constant, which increases the solubility and diffusivity of many compounds in the reaction media [26]. Moreover, polar protic solvents (alcohol) would assist the process by dissolving and stabilizing reaction intermediates to which they give high conversion rates, high oil, and high gas yields [27]. Moreover, NR is high volatile material and the presence of large amount of alcohol could provide the high degradation environment, which also causes the cracking of liquid product into (small molecules) gaseous products. 3.1.3 Influence of reaction time The effect of residence time on product yield was studied at 325 °C, and with a solvent/NR mass proportion of 1:1 by changing time interval from 15 min to 75 min. Fig. 3 (a), showed that the yield of oil raised up gradually with rise in residence times from 15 min to 30 min. The reaction duration of 30 min was found adequate for the liquefaction of NR for the maximum production of oil yield (89.53 wt. %) using propanol. Whereas, liquid yield of 84.12 wt.% and 85.98 wt.%, was obtained using methanol and ethanol as a solvent respectively. However, the additional extension of the reaction time does not show any major influence on the oil yield. Also, varying the holding times also did not show any notable effect on gaseous product and tar yields. Similar findings were also described by Zhang et al [23]. Trend of different reaction times with product yields were shown in Fig. 3(a), (b), and (c)."
7,Optimum parameters and the role of solvent,"3.2 Optimum parameters and the role of solvent Based upon results, it can be seen that the temperature of 325 °C, alcohol to NR ratio of 1:1, and the reaction time of 30 min. were found as optimum conditions to maximize the production of liquid products. Under these conditions, the highest liquid yield of 84.12 wt%, 85.98 wt%, and 89.53 wt% were achieved using methanol, ethanol, and propanol as a solvent respectively. The results highlighted that the propanol gave the highest liquid yield which is due to fact that propanol has more hydrogen. Approximately, 97% of alcohols were recovered. This study showed that the propanol has significant improvement on the liquid yield and energy density. Alcohol solvents have low critical points as compared to water and it is easy to achieve these milder conditions in thermal liquefaction process. Alcohol solvents have low dielectric constant which enhance the solubility of product fragments and therefore improves the liquefaction process [17]. Furthermore, alcohols not only act as a solvent to decompose the raw material but they also become a source of hydrogen donor for the production of high yield oil. The presence of hydrogen in alcohol solvent could stabilize the fragments and intermediates formed during the thermal liquefaction and prevent them from repolymerization to produce tar [28–30]."
8,Characterization of liquid products,"3.3 Characterization of liquid products In this section, the characteristics of liquids products were reported on the basis of maximum liquid yield obtained at optimum conditions with three different alcohols. The conditions of 325 °C, 1:1 solvent/NR ratio, and 30 min were found to be the optimal parameters for the highest production of liquid-oil. However, for comparison purposes, some results of liquid characteristics from different operating parameters are also presented in this section. 3.3.1 Ultimate analysis and HHV The results of elemental analysis and HHV of liquid products from different alcohols were shown in Table 1 . From Table 1, it showed that the use of alcohol in thermal liquefaction of NR has significantly improved the value of C and H contents, which is very important for increasing the energy density of liquid. The average C and H contents for all liquid product were obtained higher than 86% and 12%, respectively. In contrast, the O contents were observed to be lower, where the value was obtained in the range of 0.77% to 1.1%. In addition, the average value of HHV was estimated to be 46 MJ/kg. All the liquid products obtained using different alcohols showed that the N contents were lesser than the N contents existing in NR. This elemental analysis results have proven that the alcohols solvent can provide a better fuel quality compared to water as commonly used solvent in hydrothermal liquefaction [2,31]. An additional experiment was performed to assess the influence of different operating parameters on the oil properties and the result showed that elemental contents did not significantly change by increasing solvent/NR ratio and temperature above 300 C The increase in C and H contents were observed as the temperature increased, where the increase of the solvent in feedstock only improved the carbon contents. The O contents were remained around 1% in all the operating conditions. The rise in temperature reduced the O contents significantly which led to improve the HHV of liquid product. In addition, the S and N contents did not show any significant change by applying different operating parameters. For all the oil samples, the HHV was approximately obtained between 40–46 MJ/kg at different operating conditions using different alcohols. The HHV of oil achieved through the thermal liquefaction of NR was marked nearly to diesel quality (44 MJ/kg) [2]. 3.3.2 Physical properties of liquid oil The results from Table 1 showed that the value of viscosities were measured within the range of 11.7 cP to 12.6 cP. This range was significantly different with the viscosity of the liquid oil product obtained by the thermal liquefaction of NR using water. At the same temperature condition, the viscosity of obtained oil using water was reported to be 41.1 cP [2]. Kanaveli et al. noted that viscous oil lowers the quality of fuel in terms of poor flow, poor atomization and low volatility, causing incomplete combustion, engine deposits, and piston ring sticking [32]. In contrast to viscosity, the density of liquid product produced has showed not much considerable influence by the use of diverse solvents. At optimal operating parameters, the average density of liquid oil samples was estimated to be 0.8 g ml−1. 3.3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis The FTIR spectra shown that all oil samples nearly had same features in the respect of functional groups (chemical bonds), where five main peaks were noticeably detected in the spectra. These peaks identified as methyl, methylene, aromatics, vinyl and carbonyl group. Fig. 4 showed that, CH2, CH3, and CH were the main abundant functional groups identified in the oil synthesized through the thermal liquefaction of NR using different alcohols. The chemical bonds of CC bending and CH bending were mostly observed at peaks between 816- 953 cm−1, which showed the existence of aromatic and vinyl based compounds. A strong peak which was observed at 1454 cm−1showed the existence of methylene group (CH2), whereas the methyl group (CH3) was identified with a strong peak at 1376 cm−1. At wavelength frequency above 2500 cm−1, the chemical bonds associated to methyl and methylene were also identified. At peak 2866 cm−1 and 2924 cm−1, methylene and methyl groups were spotted respectively. From FTIR analysis showed that the methylene and methyl groups were the most dominant functional groups. Almost, the similar chemical bonds were reported in previously published work using water as a solvent for the depolymerization of NR [2]. 3.3.4 GC/MS analysis and liquefaction mechanism The GCMS study was conducted to define the category and kind of compounds existing in the oil that has been obtained using diverse alcohols at optimum parameter. The identified compounds were recognized by searching a mass spectrometry library databank, and the results of analysis were shown in Table 2 . There were large number of compounds that were identified but their peak areas were small, hence they were not inspected in current investigation. In GCMS study, various compounds can be categorized as alkenes, aromatics, alcohols, ketones, alkyl, and aldehydes were noticed. Table 2 showed that most of the compounds present in oil were recognized as alkenes. D-Limonene and isoprene were the main governing species found in alkene. Depolymerization of NR is initially marked by the degradation of polyisoprene to isoprene monomers via a β– scission mechanism. Isoprene radicals then undergo dimerization (intramolecular cyclisation) to form D-limonene [33,34]. Moreover, the second most dominating kind was identified as aromatics compounds. Malevich et al, used propanol for the liquefaction of rubber (consisting of 25.4% of NR and 27.7% of synthetic NR rest were carbon black and other ingredients) [35]. It was reported that high liquid yield was obtained using propanol, which indicates the interaction of solvent molecules with material being processed. Moreover, it was also reported that the amount of cyclic and alkenes (olefin) based compounds were high when propanol was used in the process. The highest percentage of aromatics in the oil was mainly due to 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene, o-xylene, and toluene. Alkyls were recognized as third prominent class in the obtained oil. Hence, from the analysis it can be concluded that the alkenes were present with maximum proportion in oil, then followed by aromatics, alkyls, ketones, alcohols and aldehydes. The concentration of D-limonene was found to be the highest around 51.23% and then followed by isoprene 10.65% when using propanol as a solvent under optimum operating parameters. These two compounds are categorized as alkenes and have potential use as value-added chemicals. Recovery of these chemicals by using extraction techniques will lead to increase in the utilization of NR in the global market. The most common techniques that are used for the separation of D-limonene from liquid product is distillation [36,37], or by the selective condensation of the reactor outlet [38]. Pakdel et al. studied the synthesis of D-limonene from tire based oil extensively and successfully extracted the 95% of D-limonene through distillation [39]. Subsequently, Pakdel et al. extracted the D-limonene from tire derived oil using large capacity reactor and the obtained fractions of D-limonene was within the range of 50 and 92 wt% [40]. Similarly, Stanciulescu and Ikura also performed the double distillation of a tire based oil and achieved 75% of pure D-limonene [41] D-limonene is an important substance in the pharmaceutical industry to produce skin creams, cancer medicine, solvent for cholesterol, pathogens neutralizer, wound healer and heartburn relief. In addition, D-limonene is also used as a flavoring agent, dishwashing liquid, floor cleaner, cosmetics, and odour control agent. Some studies reported that hydrogenated D-limonene can also be used as a fuel additives and it can also be used for the production of high energy density fuels [42–45]. The statistical data showed that over 45 kilo-tons of D-limonene was needed in 2015 and it is predicted to exceed 65 kilo-tons by the year 2023, with estimated gains at above 5%. The production of D-limonene through this process may be promoted as an alternative way to fulfill its future demand. Besides D-limonene, the liquid product also comprised other hydrocarbon compounds which make this liquid suitable to be proposed as alternative fuel. The other important compounds for fuel detected in liquid are aromatics (12.54%), alkyls (10.8%), and alkene (13.37%). The results of analysis showed that liquid product exhibits good fuel properties in terms of high HHV (46 MJ/kg), and low oxygen contents (1.02%). These characteristics of liquid product are very close to that of conventional fuel oil that were reported in the literature [46] and it can be upgraded for high quality fuel."
9,Conclusions,"This study showed that NR can be converted into valuable intermediate products through thermal liquefaction process using different alcohol solvents. The conversion has successfully transformed the solid NR into the liquid product which are beneficial for the storage and transportation. With the equal ratio of propanol and NR, the highest liquid yield (89.53 wt.%) was obtained at the temperature and reaction time of 325 °C and 30 min. respectively. The liquid product has two potential uses as a chemical feedstock and as a renewable fuel by upgradation. D-limonene was found to be the most dominating compound present in the liquid that can be extracted by distillation process and then used as a chemical feedstock in many industrial applications. Furthermore, the characteristics of product showed that this liquid can also be used for as a future renewable fuel production since it has a high energy density and low sulfur content which make the liquid more environmental friendly."
