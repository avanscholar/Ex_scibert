0,Introduction,"Furfural is an important compound and is usually obtained by acidic hydrolysis of corn core. Although both vapor and liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural can produce furfuryl alcohol, the vapor phase hydrogenation is usually preferred because it can be carried out at atmospheric pressure. Furfuryl alcohol is mainly used in the production of various synthetic fibers, rubbers, and resins. Besides, it is widely used as a solvent for pigment or phenolic resins [1,2]. As a catalyst with moderate activity, copper chromite has been used in the furan industry for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol for decades [1,3,4]. But the greatest disadvantage for this catalyst is its high toxicity, which causes severe environmental pollution. Recently, some environmentally friendly catalysts with different composition or prepared by different methods have been reported. Platinum catalysts on oxide supports covered with a monolayer of a transition metal oxide [1], and Cu/MgO catalysts prepared by three methods [2] were used for the vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural. Copper-based catalysts dispersed on three forms of carbon were prepared by a wet impregnation technique and the vapor phase kinetic studies of furfural hydrogenation were performed at atmospheric pressure [3]. Raney nickel catalysts modified by impregnation of salts of heteropolyacids for the liquid phase selective hydrogenation of furfural to produce furfuryl alcohol have been reported by Liu et al. [5]. With the development of amorphous and nanometer materials, some ultra-fine amorphous powders such as Ni–P, Ni–B, Ni–P–B, Co–B and Ni–Fe–B amorphous alloy powders have been used for the liquid phase selective hydrogenation of furfural [6–9]. In this work, the Cu–Ca/SiO2 environmentally friendly catalysts were prepared by sol–gel and impregnation methods, respectively. XRD, BET, chemisorption of nitrous oxide and XPS techniques were utilized to investigate the influence of the preparation method on the structure of the catalysts. The catalytic performance of the catalysts for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was tested."
1,Experimental,"Cu–Ca/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by sol–gel (SG) and impregnation (IM) methods. The SG catalyst was prepared as follows: copper and calcium nitrate were dissolved in the colloidal silica (acidic non-stabilizer type, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co. Ltd., China). The solution was then added into an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate with vigorous stirring. Whilst forming silica gel, the precipitates of copper and calcium were deposited onto the gel. The precursor of the catalyst was allowed to age continuously for 2h prior to the filtration. The filtered precursor was washed thoroughly with deionized water, and then dried for 2h at 383K and calcined for 4h at 673K. The SiO2 support for the impregnation method was also obtained by gelling the colloidal silica as described in SG preparation. The IM catalyst was prepared by impregnating the dry supports overnight with an aqueous solution containing copper and calcium nitrate, and then dried and calcined as described in SG preparation. The CuO loadings of two catalysts were 20 (wt%). XRD patterns were obtained with a Rigaku D/max-2500PC X-ray powder diffractometer operated at 50kV and 250mA, using Cu Kα radiation. The BET specific surface areas and average pore diameter were measured according to nitrogen adsorption at 77K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2400 instrument. The copper dispersion in the reduced samples was determined by chemisorption of nitrous oxide. The procedures were performed in turn for complete oxidation, TPR, surface oxidation and TPR again [10–12]. Among them, the complete oxidation of the samples was performed in air (30cm3 min−1) at 723K for 60min. The surface oxidation (from Eq. (1)) was initiated by dissociative adsorption of nitrous oxide (5% N2O/N2, 30cm3 min−1) to the reduced catalysts at 363K for 30min. After the complete bulk oxidation and the surface oxidation, TPR were carried out by heating the sample from ambient temperature to 723K at 10K min−1 in a 5% H2/N2 flow (30cm3 min−1). The total amount of copper was provided by the hydrogen consumption X after the complete oxidation (from Eq. (2)). The number of copper surface atoms was provided by the hydrogen consumption Y after the surface oxidation (from Eq. (3)). With X and Y, copper dispersion (D%), specific copper surfaces areas (S) and average volume-surface diameter of copper particles (d vs) can be calculated according to the formulae described by Guerreiro et al. [12]: (1) 2 Cu + N 2 O → Cu 2 O + N 2 (2) CuO + H 2 → Cu + H 2 O (3) Cu 2 O + H 2 → 2 Cu + H 2 O XPS and AES spectra as well as the surface relative atom ratio of catalyst samples were obtained using an ESCALAB MKII spectrometer equipped with a small reactor in a pretreatment chamber (V.G. Scientific Ltd., UK). The instrument was operated at 2×10−8 Pa and Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV). After the original XPS and AES spectra were recorded, the samples were transferred into the small reactor and reduced in hydrogen atmosphere at 523K for 2h. After being cooled to room temperature, the samples were transferred into the analyzer chamber for XPS and AES measurements. The binding energies of all spectra were calibrated using the value of contaminant carbon (C1s=284.6eV) as a reference. The surface relative atomic ratios of elements of the samples were calculated according to the peak area of the spectra. The area sensitivity factors of related spectra for relative elements were chosen from the data calculated by Scofield [13]. The vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural was carried out in a stainless fixed-bed reactor (300mm long and 8mm i.d.) at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst was reduced in a 10% H2 and N2 flow at 523K for 3h. The temperature of the bed was adjusted with a temperature controller. After the reduction, the reactor was cooled down to reaction temperature 403K. Furfural was then injected into the vaporizer by a microfeeder and mixed with hydrogen, and then introduced into the reactor. The H2 flow was monitored by using a mass flow meter with H2/furfural molar ratio 5:1. Liquid space velocity of furfural was maintained at 0 . 33 ml h − 1 ml catalyst - 1 . The products were condensed in an ice-cooled trap and analyzed by a SP3420 gas chromatograph equipped with a GDX-102 column and thermal conductivity detector."
2,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns for two fresh samples as shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the IM catalyst has strong CuO and weak CaO crystallite signals. On the contrary, in the SG sample only weak CuO signals were detected whereas no CaO signals were observed. The peaks at 2θ =26.2°, 27.2°, 33.2°, 45.8° can be attributed to CaCO3. These results show that the copper particle sizes of the SG sample are smaller than those of the IM catalyst but with the same composition, which is clearly due to the different preparation methods. For the SG catalyst, the deposition of Cu and Ca ions was simultaneously carried out with the gelatination of colloidal silica. This not only led to the high dispersion of Cu and Ca on the support but also might result in the formation of interaction between CuO and the supports or the promoter. According to the results of chemisorption of nitrous oxide, copper dispersion (D%), specific copper surfaces areas (S) and average volume-surface diameter of copper particles (d vs) for the reduced samples can be calculated and are given in Table 1 . BET specific surface area (S BET) and average pore diameter for fresh catalysts are also summarized in Table 1. The results indicate that two catalysts have similar specific surface area and average pore diameter but rather different metallic dispersion. The copper dispersion and specific copper surfaces areas of the SG catalyst are obviously higher than those of the IM catalyst. Based on the average volume-surface diameter of the copper particles in Table 1 and the results of the XRD analysis in Fig. 1, it is likely that the high Cu dispersion in the SG catalyst is due to the smaller Cu particles. The smaller D% in the IM catalyst is the result of occupation of larger Cu particles on the supports surface [2]. The XPS spectra of two catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . Since the binding energy values of Cu2p3/2 in metallic copper, Cu2O and CuO, are 932.4, 932.2 and 933.5eV, respectively [14], it is believed that the copper species at the surface of two fresh catalysts (Fig. 2(1)) are mainly CuO. For the SG catalyst, the binding energy of Cu2p3/2 is slightly lower than that of the IM catalyst, which indicates there may be small amount of low valent copper present in the SG catalyst due to some strong interaction between CuO and the support or the promoter [12,15]. The binding energy values of Cu2p3/2 for the reduced samples (Fig. 2(2)) indicate that the copper existed as Cu0 or Cu2O. In order to distinguish the copper species in the reduced samples, AES spectra of CuL3VV for two reduced samples were recorded. The kinetic energy values of CuL3VV and the surface relative atomic ratio are shown in Table 2 . It is evident that the copper in the reduced samples existed mainly as Cu0 (kinetic energy in metallic copper, Cu2O and CuO is 918.6, 917.4 and 917.9eV, respectively [14]). Fig. 2(3) shows that there is little change in the binding energy values of Ca2p3/2 on the surface of two catalysts for the fresh and reduced samples. Based on the results of XRD analysis, it can be concluded that the species of calcium for the IM catalyst should be CaO whereas it is CaCO3 in the SG catalyst (The binding energy values of CaO and CaCO3 are 346.3 and 346.8eV, respectively [14]). The slight drift in the binding energy may be due to the strong interaction between Ca and Cu or the support, which might be helpful for improving the adsorption and thermal stability of the catalysts. From the surface relative atomic ratio listed in Table 2, it can be found that the number of surface copper atoms for the SG catalyst is higher than that of the IM catalysts, which further confirms the results obtained by chemisorption of nitrous oxide. Hydrogenation of furfural can generate many compounds including furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran, tetrahydro-furfuryl alcohol and other ring-opening products, depending on the catalysts employed and the reaction conditions [1,3]. In this work, furfuryl alcohol was obtained as the main product along with a small amount of 2-methylfuran. The catalytic performance of the SG and IM catalysts is shown in Fig. 3 . The measurement results of Cu–Cr/γ-Al2O3 catalyst prepared by impregnation method [16] (designated as Cu–Cr) are also shown in Fig. 3. The results of Fig. 3 indicate that the SG catalyst gave high catalytic activity (conversion 100%) and selectivity (about 98.7%), but showed no loss of activity after 80h reaction. These were similar to that of Cu–Cr catalyst (conversion 99.5%, selectivity 99.0%). On the contrary, the IM catalyst lost the activity significantly, decreasing from 93.5% to 66.0% after only 25h although the selectivity was 100%. The difference of the catalytic performance between the SG and IM catalysts is mainly due to the different dispersion of the copper on the supports surface. The interaction between the copper and the supports or the promoter, which may be helpful for the adsorption of reactants [1,2], might be another factor. With high active site dispersion and the strong interaction, both the SG and Cu–Cr catalysts gave similarly high catalytic performances. As a structural promotor, basic metal calcium is usually used to improve the stability of catalysts. Jing et al. [17] have found that there is no evident effect on the initial activity for different Ca loadings, but the loading of Ca has a great effect on the stability of catalyst in reforming of methane with CO2. Hou et al. [18] have confirmed that Ca not only can improve the dispersion of Ni, strengthen the interaction between Ni and Al2O3, but also retard the sintering of Ni in Ca-promoted Ni/α-Al2O3 catalysts. In this work, both SG-1 and IM-1 catalyst (free of calcium) were prepared by the sol–gel and impregnation methods, respectively. Their catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of furfural (FFR) to furfuryl alcohol (FFA) as shown in Fig. 3 demonstrates that the conversion of furfural with the IM catalyst is obviously higher than that with the IM-1 catalyst. This reconfirms that promotor calcium can improve the dispersion of Cu, and enhance the ability to resist agglomeration of Cu crystal particles, therefore significantly improving the stability of the catalyst [17,18]. A similar result was also observed on the SG catalyst but in a much less extent, thanks to smaller crystal particles and higher dispersion. In addition, it has been noticed that the selectivity of furfural alcohol for the SG catalyst is higher than that for the SG-1 catalyst. This might be due to the fact that promotor calcium can prevent the resinification reaction of furfuryl alcohol [19] and improve the ability of the catalysts for resisting coking [20]."
3,Conclusion,"The results discussed above demonstrate that the sol–gel technique is a very economical and effective method for preparing highly dispersed non-chromium catalysts. Since the copper dispersion obtained by the gelatination of colloidal silica is higher than that by the impregnation method, the SG catalyst has demonstrated high activity and excellent selectivity in the vapor phase hydrogenation reaction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. In addition, Ca can improve the stability of the catalysts and increase the selectivity of the SG catalyst for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol as a structural promotor."
