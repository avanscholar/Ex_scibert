0,Introduction,"The environmental awareness associated with the use of traditional resources (natural gas, petroleum and coal) has promoted the development of new routes for sustainable hydrogen production, whose demand is increasing because of its interest as an energy carrier and reactant in hydroprocessing units in refineries [1]. Within this scenario, biomass plays an important role as an alternative feedstock, given that it is a CO2 neutral renewable source, and therefore allows producing sustainable chemicals and fuels [2]. Amongst the different thermochemical routes, direct steam gasification [3–5] and the indirect route of bio-oil reforming [6–9] are the ones most studied for hydrogen production from biomass. The aim of gasification is to produce syngas, with tar formation being an issue for further industrial applications [10,11]. The indirect route of bio-oil reforming has several problems related to its properties and its vaporization and re-polymerization [12,13]. Accordingly, the two-stage strategy made up of pyrolysis and steam reforming has being gaining increasing attention in recent years because it avoids the need for condensing the pyrolysis outlet stream and re-vaporizing the bio-oil to be fed into the reforming reactor [14–18]. This process, in which each step is carried out in a different reactor, has its advantages over the single-step process of pyrolysis and in-situ reforming. On the one hand, the temperature in each step can be optimized in order to maximize the production of hydrogen [19] and, on the other hand, the catalyst is more effective for volatile transformation, i.e., the process is more versatile for establishing the desired catalyst/feed ratio. Therefore, a more uniform product stream will be obtained because the catalyst is more efficient at attenuating secondary reactions. Nevertheless, the biomass feedstock’s low hydrogen content and high oxygen content are a drawback for high hydrogen production. Moreover, the catalyst undergoes a considerable deactivation by coke [16]. Consequently, the objective of this study is to increase H2 production and attenuate catalyst deactivation by jointly valorising biomass and HDPE mixtures. Several authors report hydrogen production increases by gasifying biomass with HDPE [20–23]. Furthermore, co-feeding overcomes the seasonal limitations of biomass availability and helps to mitigate the environmental problems associated with waste plastic management. Although pyrolysis is considered a suitable route for the large-scale valorisation of waste plastics, and particularly polyolefins [24–27], studies involving pyrolysis and in-line catalytic steam reforming of biomass-plastic mixtures are very scarce. Alvarez et al. [19] have studied the co-feeding of polypropylene in the pyrolysis-reforming of biomass in a batch laboratory scale reactor, obtaining higher gas yields and higher hydrogen productions than those with only biomass in the feed. In the same experimental unit, Kumagai et al. [28] performed the pyrolysis-reforming of a biomass/polypropylene mixture on a Ni-Mg-Al-Ca catalyst synthesized by co-precipitation, obtaining a maximum hydrogen production of 6.0g of H2 per 100g of feed when the catalyst was calcined at 500°C. The aim of this study is to increase hydrogen production by co-feeding plastics into a continuous two-step process. Moreover, the influence of their joint valorisation on process performance and catalyst deactivation was analyzed. The novel strategy proposed combines the good performance of the CSBR for the pyrolysis of biomass [29] and plastics [30] with the suitability of the fluidized bed for the catalytic reforming process [31,32]. The vigorous cyclic movement of the sawdust and sand particles coated with melted plastic in the CSBR minimizes segregation problems and avoids bed defluidization. Furthermore, the fluidized bed catalytic reactor allows controlling the temperature of the endothermic reforming reaction and delays the blocking of the bed by coke formation. This two-step configuration has been described in previous papers for the pyrolysis-reforming of biomass [16] and plastics [33], reporting a good performance of the process with high hydrogen yields and without operational problems."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Pine sawdust (pinus insignis) waste has been milled and sieved to a particle diameter in the 1–2mm range, which is a suitable particle size for guaranteeing the good performance of the solid feeding system. It was then dried to a moisture value of around 10wt%. The HDPE provided by Dow Chemical in the form of chippings (4mm) has the following properties: average molecular weight, 46.2kgmol−1; polydispersity, 2.89 and density, 940kgm−3. The higher heating values (HHV) of both feedstocks are reported in Table 1 , together with the results of ultimate and proximate analyses, which have been determined using the equipment described in previous studies [29]. A commercial Ni reforming catalyst (G90-LDP) provided by Süd Chemie (Germany) has been used for the reforming step. The original catalyst (in the form of 10 hole rings, 19×16mm) has been milled and sieved to a particle size in the 0.4–0.8mm range to guarantee suitable fluid-dynamic conditions in the fluidized bed. The metal content (provided by the supplier) and physical properties (measured by N2 adsorption–desorption) of the catalyst are summarized in Table 2 . As observed, the catalyst has low BET surface area and porosity. The catalyst has been reduced in-situ in order to ensure its activity. Thus, based on the results obtained by temperature programmed reduction, it has been reduced for 4h under 10vol% H2 at 710°C. Both the adsorption–desorption isotherms and the TPR profile of this catalyst are detailed elsewhere [34,35]."
3,Equipment and reactors,"2.2 Equipment and reactors Fig. 1 shows the experimental equipment used for the pyrolysis-reforming process. The unit is equipped with two in-line reactors: (i) a CSBR for the pyrolysis of biomass and HDPE mixtures and (ii) a fluidized bed for the subsequent reforming of pyrolysis volatiles. The unit is provided with two independent feeders for biomass and HDPE in order to avoid the segregation observed when both materials were mixed in a single feeder. The biomass and HDPE are loaded into the dispenser on each feeder from the top of the feeding system. As the piston rises, the entire system vibrates, and the feed is discharged through a water-cooled pipe that connects the feeders with the CSBR. In addition, steam condensation in the vessel is avoided by feeding a small flow of N2 from the top of the feeding system. A pump (Gilson 307) has been used to supply the reactor with water, which has been vaporized by a heating cartridge before entering the gas preheater. N2, H2 and air can also be fed into the CSBR, with their flows being controlled by mass flow controllers, which allow feeding up to 20Lmin−1 of nitrogen and air, and up to 5Lmin−1 of hydrogen. The temperature of the steam and gases (pyrolysis inlet stream) is increased to that of the pyrolysis process in a gas preheater packed with stainless steel pipes that is located in the lower section of the pyrolysis reactor. The pyrolysis step has been performed in a CSBR. This reactor has been successfully used in the pyrolysis and gasification of different waste materials, such as biomass [4,36], plastics [37,38] and tyres [39,40]. The detailed design and main dimensions of the CSBR have been reported elsewhere [16,33]. Reactor temperature is controlled by two thermocouples placed in the annular zone and wall of the CSBR. Before the products are fed into the reforming reactor, they circulate through a cyclone in order to retain sand fines and the char particles entrained from the CSBR. In order to avoid bed plugging due to coke deposition, which has been observed in a fixed bed reactor [34], a fluidized bed has been used for the reforming of pyrolysis volatiles, whose dimensions are 38.1mm in diameter and 440mm in length. The thermocouple located inside the catalyst bed controls the temperature of the fluidized bed reactor. The volatiles from the fluidized bed circulate through a sintered steel filter (5μm) to retain catalyst fines elutriated from the fluidized bed, with this amount being below 5% of the catalyst bed used in the runs. All the interconnection pipes, high-efficiency cyclone, filter and both reactors are placed inside an oven kept at 270°C, which ensures that the steam and products are not condensed in the connections between the reactors. Finally, the condensation system of the plant, consisting of a condenser and a coalescence filter, ensures the full condensation and retention of the products derived from the biomass and HDPE, as well as the non-reacted steam."
4,Experimental conditions,"2.3 Experimental conditions The attainment of a suitable hydrodynamic performance in the two in-line reactors (the first reactor outlet stream is the second reactor inlet stream) conditions the steam flow rate to feed into the CSBR and the particle size of the sand in it, as well as the particle diameter of both the catalyst and the sand in the fluidized bed reactor. Thus, a water flow rate of 3mLmin−1 has been established as optimum for this unit, which corresponds to a steam flow rate of 3.73NLmin−1. The bed consists of 50g of sand in the pyrolysis step, with particle diameter in the 0.3–0.35mm range. The experiments have been performed in continuous mode by feeding 0.75gmin−1. The pyrolysis of biomass and HDPE mixtures has been performed at 500°C, which previous studies have reported to be suitable temperature for biomass [29] and HDPE pyrolysis [30] in a CSBR. Likewise, based on hydrodynamic runs, a bed of 25g of catalyst and sand mixture has been chosen for the fluidized bed reactor, with a particle diameter between 0.4 and 0.8mm for the catalyst and between 0.3 and 0.35mm for the sand in order to operate with a gas linear velocity 3 or 4 times the minimum fluidization velocity. These conditions guarantee vigorous fluidization of the bed, even when the coke content of the catalyst is high. A study has been made of the effect different HDPE/biomass mass ratios in the feed have on the pyrolysis-reforming process. Thus, HDPE/biomass mixtures of 25/75, 50/50 and 75/25wt% have been assayed and the results have been compared with those for individual feeds of biomass and plastic. The temperature of the reforming step was 700°C, given that this is the minimum one required for the full conversion of the volatiles from HDPE pyrolysis [33]. The remaining process operating conditions are as follows: 16.7gcat mingfeeding −1 (corresponding to 12.5g of catalyst) and a steam/(biomass+HDPE) mass ratio of 4. The reproducibility of the results has been guaranteed by repeating the experiments several times under the same operating conditions."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The on-line analysis of the volatiles from the reforming step has been carried out using a GC Agilent 6890, which is equipped with a HP-PONA column and a flame ionization detector. A sample from the outlet stream of the reforming reactor (prior to condensation) has been injected into the gas chromatograph using a thermostated line at 280°C. Once the water and non-reacted liquid products have been removed by condensation, the non-condensable gases (H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and C2 C4) have been analyzed on-line in a micro GC Varian 4900. The coke content deposited on the reforming catalyst has been determined at the end of the continuous runs by temperature programmed oxidation in a thermobalance connected to a mass spectrometer. Given that the Ni on the catalyst is oxidized together with the carbonaceous coke, this procedure allows monitoring carbon dioxide formation throughout the TPO runs. The procedure used is as follows: (i) signal stabilization with a He stream (10mLmin−1) at 100°C, and (ii) oxidation with air (50mLmin−1) following a ramp of 5°Cmin−1 to 800°C, which has been kept for 30min to guarantee total coke combustion. In addition, the nature of the coke deposited has been analyzed by transmission electron microscopy images (Philips CM200)."
6,Reaction indices,"2.5 Reaction indices The results have been analyzed according to the following reaction indices: conversion, yields of individual reforming products, production of gas, production and yield of H2 and the amount of reacted steam. The conversion quantifies the recovery of carbon units in the gaseous stream in relation to those from the pyrolysis step. (1) X = C gas C volatiles 100 It should be noted that the char produced in biomass pyrolysis has not been taken into account, given that it is continuously removed from the CSBR and, is not therefore fed into the reforming step. The yield of carbon containing individual compounds (CO, CO2, CH4, C2 C4 fraction, mainly ethylene and ethane) has been calculated based on the volatile stream fed into the reforming step, defined as the ratio between the molar flow of each product i (Fi) and the molar flow of volatiles from the pyrolysis step (Fvolatiles), both expressed in carbon units: (2) Y i = F i F volatiles 100 The hydrogen yield has been calculated as the hydrogen molar flow produced in the reforming step (FH2) and the maximum hydrogen molar flow allowable by stoichiometry (FH2 0), considering the stoichiometry of the reforming reactions expressed in Eqs. (4) and (5). (3) Y H 2 = F H 2 F H 2 0 100 Reforming of biomass pyrolysis products: (4) C n H m O k + ( 2 n - k ) H 2 O → n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m / 2 - k ) H 2 Reforming of HDPE pyrolysis products: (5) C n H m + 2 n H 2 O → n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m / 2 ) H 2 Gas production is stated by mass unit of the plastic/biomass in the feed in the pyrolysis-reforming process, and has been calculated as follows: (6) P gas = m g m 0 100 where mg and m0 are the mass flow rates of the gas produced and HDPE/biomass fed into the CSBR, respectively. Likewise, the production of H2 is: (7) P H 2 = m H 2 m 0 100 where mH2 and m0 are the mass flow rates of the H2 and HDPE/biomass fed into the CSBR, respectively. Finally, reacted steam (Rsteam) is defined as the amount of steam used in the reforming reaction by mass unit of the plastic/biomass in the feed. It was calculated based on a hydrogen mass balance, considering the hydrogen contained in the pyrolysis volatiles stream, the steam introduced into the process and the hydrogen obtained in the reforming step. (8) R steam = m steam m 0 100"
7,Results,
8,First step: biomass and HDPE pyrolysis,"3.1 First step: biomass and HDPE pyrolysis As noted above, the steam needed for the reforming step has been fed into the pyrolysis step and is the fluidizing agent required in the CSBR. Thus, the pyrolysis step has been conducted in a steam environment instead of the more common N2 environment. Nevertheless, as the pyrolysis step is performed at relatively low temperatures, previous studies show only slight differences in the product distributions obtained in the steam and nitrogen environments in the pyrolysis of both biomass [16] and HDPE [33,34]. Similarly, other studies in the literature do not reveal any significant effect of using steam instead of N2 in the pyrolysis of these materials, at least when the process is performed at low temperatures [41,42]. Table 3 summarizes the product yields obtained in the pyrolysis of biomass and HDPE feeds, with major differences being observed in their distributions. Thus, the pyrolysis of biomass leads to three main fractions: gas, bio-oil and char. The pyrolysis conditions used, i.e., relatively low temperatures and short residence times (fast pyrolysis), allow maximizing bio-oil production (75.3wt%). The bio-oil is a complex mixture of several families of oxygenated compounds including acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, phenols, furans and saccharides [29]. Moreover, a significant amount of water is produced in the pyrolysis of biomass due to dehydration reactions and the original moisture content, with a yield of up to 25wt%. Given that the aforementioned pyrolysis conditions minimise secondary cracking reactions, the gas yield is 7.3wt%, and is made up mainly of CO and CO2. Finally, the char yield is 17.3wt%, which was extracted from the CSBR through a lateral outlet, avoiding its accumulation. Although the char is not reformed in the second step, this product has several applications, such as active carbon, sorbent [43,44], catalyst support [45], soil amender and so on, and its valorisation may therefore contribute to the overall economy of the process. The fast pyrolysis of HDPE in a CSBR does not produce any solids, which is an indication of the reactor’s excellent performance for the fast pyrolysis of polyolefins [30,46]. The whole product stream made up of volatiles may therefore be treated in the reforming step. The main products are the long chain hydrocarbons making up the diesel fraction (C12 C20) and waxes (C21+), with the total yield being up to 90wt%. The yield of gases and gasoline range hydrocarbons is low, 1.5 and 5.6wt%, respectively, with the yield of aromatics being almost negligible (0.3wt%)."
9,Second step: catalytic steam reforming of pyrolysis volatiles,"3.2 Second step: catalytic steam reforming of pyrolysis volatiles A study has been made of the effect HDPE co-feeding into the two step pyrolysis-reforming process has on the initial conversion and initial product yields and on catalyst deactivation, with the operating conditions as described in Section 2.3. In order to study the influence co-feeding has on the indices, the following reactions have been taken into account: Steam reforming of oxygenated compounds derived from biomass: (9) C n H m O k + ( n - k ) H 2 O → n CO + ( n + m / 2 - k ) H 2 Steam reforming of hydrocarbons derived from HDPE: (10) C n H m + n H 2 O → n CO + ( n + m / 2 ) H 2 (11) Water gas shift(WGS) : CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 (12) Methane steam reforming : CH 4 + H 2 O ↔ CO + 3 H 2 Cracking of oxygenated compounds and hydrocarbons (secondary reactions): (13) C n H m O k → oxygenates + hydrocarbons + CH 4 + CO + CO 2 (14) C n H m → paraffins + olefins 3.2.1 Results at zero time on stream The runs performed with different HDPE/biomass mass ratios lead to high conversions (defined in Eq. (1)) because the space time used is relatively high (16.7gcat mingfeeding −1). Thus, conversion is full when only biomass is fed into the process and decreases slightly when HDPE is co-fed, with the minimum value being 98% when there is only HDPE in the feed. The following factors contribute to this slight difference: (i) the higher reactivity of oxygenated compounds derived from biomass due to the presence of CO bonds that enhance the formation of carbon oxides in the reforming step [47]; and (ii) the higher effective space time for the biomass feed. It should be noted that the mass of carbon to be reformed when biomass is fed is lower than when HDPE is fed for two reasons: (i) the biomass contains oxygen in its molecular structure and (ii) a notable fraction of the carbon is retained in the char produced in the pyrolysis step. Therefore, in the case of HDPE, around 85g of carbon are reformed per 100g in the feed, whereas in the case of biomass 35g of carbon are reformed per 100g in the feed. Consequently, the effective space time (based on the carbon flow rate entering the reforming reactor) is approximately 2.5 times lower for HDPE than for biomass, although the space time used is enough to guarantee a high conversion of both feeds. As observed in Fig. 2 , gas production increases linearly when the HDPE co-fed with biomass is increased, obtaining a maximum value of 305.0wt% when there is only HDPE in the feed. As mentioned above, this result is due to the higher carbon content of HDPE, as it enhances the extent of reforming reactions (Eqs. (9) and (10)) and leads to an increase in both the gas production and the amount of steam reacted, which also increases with HDPE content in the feed from 48.9wt% for only biomass in the feed to 210.9wt% for only HDPE in the feed. The co-feeding of HDPE also has a major influence on H2 production, which increases linearly with the HDPE content in the feed. Thus, hydrogen production increases significantly from 10.9wt% for only biomass in the feed to 37.3wt% when there is only HDPE in the feed. This significant difference is directly related to the carbon and hydrogen content of the feedstocks. The linear increase of the reaction indices plotted in Fig. 2 shows there is no significant synergetic effect when co-feeding HDPE into the pyrolysis reactor. This effect has also been studied by other authors, who have reported that the co-pyrolysis of plastics and biomass has a significant effect on bio-oil composition [48,49]. The literature on the pyrolysis-reforming of biomass and plastic mixtures is limited to the studies by the research group headed by Prof. Williams. The influence of biomass/polypropylene ratio (feeding between 5 and 20wt% of PP) has been studied by Alvarez et al. [19] in a batch pyrolysis-reforming process on a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, obtaining a maximum hydrogen production of 5.5wt%, when 20wt% PP was fed. Kumagai et al. [28] have studied a Ni-Mg-Al-Ca catalyst with different Ca contents and calcination temperatures and the maximum hydrogen production was 6.0wt% for a calcination temperature of 500°C. These results are significantly lower than those obtained in this study, which is due to the continuous operating mode used here. Thus, the results described by other authors for the individual valorization of biomass and plastics by continuous pyrolysis-reforming are in the same range as those obtained here [14,15,50,51]. The steam co-gasification of biomass and polyolefins reveals the existence of positive and even synergetic effects on hydrogen and gas production and tar content in the gaseous stream [20–23,52]. However, the hydrogen production obtained in this work is higher than the figures reported in steam gasification processes, which are between 4 and 7wt% for biomass gasification [4,53,54] and in the 6–15wt% range for the gasification of polyolefins [37,55]. Fig. 3 shows the effect HDPE content in the feed has on the individual product yields (Fig.3a) and gas composition (Fig.3b). As observed, there are notable differences in H2, CO2 and CO yields. Thus, the yields of H2 and CO2 decrease when HDPE content is increased from 0 to 100wt%, from 93.2 to 85.7% and from 87.2 to 67.4%, respectively, while CO yield increases from 12.5 to 29.3%. These results evidence the effect of the higher carbon content of HDPE, and therefore the higher amount of carbon to be reformed. Moreover, as the same space time is used for all the experiments, a higher yield of CO and a lower yield of CO2 are obtained when HDPE content in the feed is increased due to the lower extent of the WGS reaction (Eq. (11)). CH4 and C2 C4 yields are very low in all the cases studied, although there is a slight increase in these yields when HDPE content is increased from 0 to 100wt%, i.e., from 0.2 to 0.8% for CH4 and from 0.1 to 0.7% for the C2 C4 fraction. As observed, H2 concentration increases with HDPE content in the feed to 72vol% when there is 75wt% of HDPE in the feed (Fig.3b), which is due to the higher content of hydrogen and absence of oxygen in the plastic composition. Nevertheless, the lower effective space time when HDPE is co-fed leads to lower CO2 and higher CO concentrations in the gaseous fraction, which in the range of HDPE content studied vary from 30.2 to 20.9vol% and from 4.3 to 9.1vol%, respectively. The hydrogen concentrations obtained by Alvarez et al. [19] in the pyrolysis and in-line reforming of biomass and PP mixtures are below those obtained here, with the peak value being 52.1vol% for 20wt% PP in the feed. The hydrogen concentrations obtained in the steam co-gasification of these feedstocks are also lower, ranging from 40 to 55vol% [20,22,56]. 3.2.2 Catalyst deactivation In order to study the influence of feed composition on reforming catalyst deactivation, the evolution of conversion (Fig. 4 ) and gas composition (Fig. 5 ) with time on stream has been analyzed in the reforming step. Fig. 4 shows that the deactivation behaviour depends largely on feed composition. Thus, the conversion after 120min continuous operation in the reforming step is below 60% for only biomass in the feed, whereas it is higher than 90% for only HDPE in the feed for the same time on stream. Moreover, a linear decay of catalyst activity is significant for HDPE, whereas in the case of biomass, activity is maintained for the first 60min, with a sharp downward trend being recorded after 75min. The initial stable conversion period observed for only biomass in the feed is explained by the space time value exceeding the equilibrium one. The most pronounced decrease in activity, Fig. 4, is obtained for only biomass in the feed, even though the effective space time for this feed is approximately 2.5 times higher than for only HDPE in the feed. These results clearly show that the oxygenated compounds and aromatic ring containing compounds (such as phenols) produced in the pyrolysis of biomass cause a much faster deactivation than the long chain hydrocarbons produced in the pyrolysis of HDPE. Likewise, Czernik et al. [47] have reported that oxygenated compounds have a more pronounced tendency than hydrocarbons to form carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, and therefore cause faster catalyst deactivation. In fact, severe reforming catalyst deactivation has been previously reported by other authors in the reforming of biomass derived oxygenates [57–59]. When different HDPE/biomass mass ratios are used, the evolutions of conversion observed are between those corresponding to only biomass and only HDPE in the feed, confirming that plastic co-feeding has a marked effect on the attenuation of catalyst deactivation. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the gas composition with time on stream for three different feeds: only biomass (a and b), a 50/50wt% HDPE/biomass mixture (c), and only HDPE (d). When there is only biomass in the feed, H2 concentration decreases from 65 to 55vol% in 120min on stream (Fig.5a), whereas it remains at around 70vol% when there is only HDPE in the feed (Fig.5d). When there is only biomass in the feed, CO concentration increases from 5 to 16vol% after 120min on stream and the opposite occurs for CO2, i.e., it decreases from 30 to 24vol%. This evolution of CO and CO2 concentrations reveals a significant deactivation of the catalyst for the WGS reaction (Eq. (11)). Nevertheless, the concentrations of CO and CO2 remain constant when there is only HDPE in the feed (Fig.5d), and above 75min on stream they change slightly for the different HDPE/biomass mixtures (Fig.5c). Therefore, when HDPE is co-fed, catalyst deactivation affecting the WGS reaction is considerably attenuated. As noted above, the concentrations of the main gaseous products formed by secondary cracking reactions, i.e., CH4 and C2 C4 fraction (mainly ethylene, ethane, propylene and propane), are initially very low for the different feeds studied due to the catalyst activity for the reforming of oxygenated compounds and hydrocarbons (Eqs. (9) and (10)). However, when the catalyst is deactivated, CH4 and C2 C4 fraction concentrations increase significantly, which is shown in detail in Fig.5b for biomass valorization. A similar trend (although less pronounced) is observed when HDPE is co-fed (results not shown). 3.2.3 Characterization of the coke deposited In order to explain the influence of feed composition on the evolution of conversion with time on stream, the coke has been characterized by temperature programmed oxidation and transmission electron microscopy images. Fig. 6 displays the TPO profiles of the catalyst deactivated in the runs with the three types of feeds studied: only biomass, 50/50wt% HDPE/biomass mixture and only HDPE. The catalyst used in the valorization of only biomass records a main peak at around 600°C, which corresponds to a polyaromatic and structured coke, with a small shoulder at around 425°C corresponding to the coke whose combustion is activated by Ni metal sites. This coke is similar to the carbon whiskers reported by Trane-Restrup and Jensen [2] in the steam reforming of furfural and guaiacol at 600°C. Nevertheless, the catalyst used in the steam reforming of HDPE pyrolysis products records a main peak at 580°C with a shoulder at 450°C. This main peak corresponds to a structured and filamentous coke similar to that obtained by Wu and Williams [60] and Acomb et al. [61] in the pyrolysis-reforming of polypropylene (PP), which is confirmed by the TEM images of these samples (shown below). The slight difference in the peak temperature (605°C for these authors) is attributed to the higher porosity of their catalyst, which hinders the combustion of the coke fraction blocking the catalyst pores. The peaks for the mixture of biomass and HDPE are between those corresponding to the individual feeds. Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of the catalyst deactivated using different feeds: only biomass (a), 25wt% HDPE in the feed (b), 50wt% HDPE in the feed (c), 75wt% HDPE in the feed (d) and only HDPE (e). Differences in the structure and nature of the coke are observed, which are due to the different composition of the volatiles fed into the reforming step. The images show dark spots corresponding to Ni active sites, with the coke deposited fully covering the Ni crystals (encapsulating coke) and being mainly non-structured for only biomass in the feed, Fig.7a. The presence of amorphous and non-structured coke has also been observed in the catalytic steam reforming of methane [62], different hydrocarbons [60,63] and oxygenated compounds [2,64]. The high combustion temperature observed in the TPO profile (600°C) is evidence that it is a very condensed coke. However, the structure of the coke changes when HDPE is co-fed, with its nature being more filamentous as HDPE content in the feed is increased. This filamentous coke has already been observed in the reforming of polyolefin pyrolysis products [60,61]. The faster deactivation observed for biomass and the attenuation of deactivation when HDPE is co-fed are attributed to the different nature of the coke. The amorphous coke formed in the reforming of oxygenates derived from biomass pyrolysis encapsulates Ni sites, causing fast catalyst deactivation, whereas the structured and filamentous coke formed, mainly in the reforming of hydrocarbons derived from HDPE pyrolysis, does not block Ni active sites, even though its progressive deposition hinders reactant flow towards Ni particles [63,65]. This interpretation of the deactivation results is consistent with the fast catalyst deactivation in the reforming of oxygenated compounds (DME, ethanol and bio-oil), which is attributed to the encapsulation of Ni sites by the amorphous coke formed by the condensation of intermediate oxygenates [7,64,66,67]. Deactivation is lower in the reforming of the hydrocarbons produced in polyolefins pyrolysis, in which the coke is mainly structured [60,61]."
10,Conclusions,"The continuous process of pyrolysis at 500°C in a CSBR followed by steam reforming at 700°C in a fluidized bed performs properly in the treatment of biomass, HDPE and their mixtures. The joint valorization of both feedstocks is an interesting strategy because increases process flexibility and improves process yields. In fact, a higher HDPE content in the feed enhances the production of both gaseous stream and hydrogen, i.e., hydrogen production increases lineally with HDPE content in the feed, from 10.9g per 100g of feed for only biomass to 37.3g for only HDPE. The composition of the feed significantly affects catalyst deactivation in the reforming step. Biomass processing leads to much faster deactivation, with this result being especially remarkable when the effective space time (by mass unit of the carbon reformed) is approximately 2.5 times that of only HDPE in the feed. Thus, after 120min continuous operation, conversion dropped from 100% to approximately 90 and 60% for only HDPE and only biomass in the feed, respectively. Consequently, the co-feeding of HDPE with biomass is a suitable strategy for attenuating catalyst deactivation. These results can be explained by the different nature of the coke deposited on the catalyst, with the amorphous coke being the main deactivating one, which is the main type of coke in biomass valorization. The co-feeding of HDPE leads to the formation of a structured and filamentous coke, whose presence has a lower impact on catalyst activity."
