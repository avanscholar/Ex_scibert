0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil fuel reserves and environmental deterioration have stimulated researchers around the world to search for renewable resources to produce fuels and chemicals [1,2]. Considerable attention has been laid on the production of value-added chemicals and biofuels from biomass resources because of its renewable, abundant and widely distributed properties [3–6]. Various valuable compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) [7–10], levulinic acid [11–13], 5-(ethoxymethyl) furfural (EMF) [14–16], sorbitol [17–18], and γ-valerolactone (GVL) [19] have been demonstrated to be capable of producing from biomass in recent years. Among those compounds, GVL with high boiling point (207°C) and flash point (96°C), as well as low melting point (−31°C) and vapor pressure (3.5kPa at 80°C) is considered as a promising fuel additive [20]. More importantly, a number of value-added chemicals (e.g., methyl pentenoate [21] and ϵ-caprolactam [22]), and bio-based liquid fuels such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [23], valeric esters [24], and long chain liquid alkenes [25] were able to be produced from GVL. The catalytic hydrogenation–cyclization of levulinic acid or its esters, capable of producing from carbohydrates [26–30], is a key step in production of GVL from biomass (Scheme 1 ) [31]. Unlike levulinic acid, alkyl levulinates possess relatively lower boiling points, as well as easy recovery and acid-free characteristics. Moreover, relatively higher yields of alkyl levulinate can be achieved from acid-catalyzed alcoholysis of carbohydrates [32–35]. In this respect, the catalytic conversion of alkyl levulinates to GVL seems to be more attractive, wherein hydrogenation of 2-ketone group to 2-CH2OH is considered to be an important step, and various hydrogen sources including hydrogen, formic acid and alcohols are involved [36,37]. In the atmosphere of hydrogen gas, metal catalysts like Ru [38–41], Pd [42,43], Ag [44], Cu [45,46], Ni [47,48], Co [49] and Mo [50] particles have been demonstrated to be efficient for converting levulinic acid or its esters to GVL. However, some drawbacks are suffered when H2 is used as the H-donor. For example, the procedure for catalyst preparation is somehow complicated, as it used to be reduced at the atmosphere of hydrogen at high temperatures. Moreover, the storage/usage of H2 is expensive and unsafe. As an alternative way, more attention has been paid to use formic acid as H-donor, which is able to be produced from biomass-derived sugars [51–56]. However, acid-resistant catalysts bearing high selectivity to decompose formic acid into H2 rather than CO and H2O are highly demanded. In this case, only limited number of noble or non-noble metal-based heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts can satisfy these conditions. Recently, the use of alcohols as hydrogen donor for the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of biomass derivatives such as furfural, HMF, and sugars to produce hydrogenates [57,58] has attracted a widespread attention, which is mostly ascribed to the sustainable catalytic process with alcohols obtainable from biomass [59]. Besides, the carbonyl products (e.g., acetone), which are formed from oxidation of alcohols, can be separated by simple distillation and reused elsewhere. Catalytic production of GVL from biomass derivatives through Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction using alcohol as hydrogen donor, on the other hand, is highly chemo-selective reduction of carbonyl groups to alcoholic hydroxyl groups in organic chemistry [60]. This reaction pathway is generally called a catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) process. In comparison to use H2 or formic acid as hydrogen source, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation process offers many advantages. For example, inexpensive and abundant alcohol can be used as both hydrogen donor and solvent. What is more, MPV reduction reaction does not rely on zero valence metal catalysts, especially precious metals [60]. Various catalysts such as ZrO2 [61,62], Raney Ni [63], Zr-Beta [64,65], ZrO(OH)2·xH2O [66], in situ generated ZrO(OH)2 [67], Ru(OH) x /TiO2 [68] and Zr-HBA [69] have been explored for the production of GVL from levulinic acid and its esters. But, it is still necessary to improve the stability and reactivity of the catalysts. Thus, developing low-cost and more efficient catalysts for GVL production from levulinic acid and its esters by the CTH reaction is significant. Mixed metal oxides are often preferable for heterogeneous catalysis due to their low cost and easy regeneration features [70,71]. On the other hand, the physical–chemical properties of mixed metal oxides such as surface area, thermal and chemical stability, and acid density are superior to their individual components [72–76]. Zr-based catalysts were reported to be efficient for MPV reduction [77–79], and Lewis acid or base sites were demonstrated to be responsible for the high activity of the reduction reaction [80,81]. Moreover, increasing acidity or basicity of heterogeneous catalysts is beneficial for the lactonization reaction to produce GVL [68,82]. Inspired by above findings, present work aims to incorporate aluminum into zirconia by co-precipitation method, so as to increase the Lewis acid or base contents, thus enhancing the producibility of GVL from ethyl levulinate. Gratifyingly, the combination of alumina with zirconia increases contents of both acid sites and base sites and even enlarges specific surface areas of the obtained catalysts. Importantly, all Al–Zr mixed oxides exhibit better catalytic activity than sole ZrO2 and Al2O3, in which the mixed catalyst with a Zr/Al molar ratio of 3/7 shows the highest performance."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ethyl levulinate (99%), sec-butyl alcohol (AR, 98%), GVL (98%) and ZrOCl2·8H2O (98%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Industrial Inc. Al(NO3)3·9H2O (AR, ≥99%), 2-propanol (AR, ≥99.7%) and other reagents used in the work were obtained from Chongqing Chuandong Chemical Reagent Company. All chemicals were used as received without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Al–Zr mixed metal catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method with slight modifications [83], In a general procedure, ZrOCl2·8H2O (18mmol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (42mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (120mL) at room temperature. To the resulting transparent solution, aqueous ammonia (25–28%) was dropwise added under vigorous stirring, and the final pH value of the slurry was adjusted to 9. The white gel solution was aged at room temperature for 12h, then filtered and washed with deionized water until no chloride ion was detected with AgNO3 solution. The resulting precipitate was dried at 100°C for 10h, and then calcined at a specified temperature with a temperature gradient of 1°C/min in air for 4h to afford the final catalyst (7:3). By using the identical method, Al–Zr mixed oxides with different metal ratios were prepared, and denoted as Al x Zr10−x -T (T on behalf of different calcination temperature). For comparison, sole Al2O3 and ZrO2 catalysts were also synthesized in the same procedure."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54056nm) and the 2θ angle between 5 and 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL, EOL, JSM-6700F, 5kV). NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD were performed on an AutoChem 2920 chemisorption analyzer. The specific surface areas (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) of the catalysts were obtained from nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements, which were conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 instrument, and the mean pore sizes and pore volumes were calculated from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method. Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis was determined by NETZSCHSTA 429 instrument in the range of room temperature to 800°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min under N2 atmosphere (flow rate: 30mL/min). The property of acid was measured by FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine, which was performed by PE Company. XPS was performed on Shandong TRW technology Co., LTD. with Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi instrument. The concentration of Al and Zr in the filtrate after removal of Al7Zr3-300 was measured by ICP-AES. Elemental analyses (Vario EL III, Elementar) were used to measure the carbon content of used Al7Zr3-300 catalysts."
5,Typical procedure for catalytic conversion of ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL,"2.4 Typical procedure for catalytic conversion of ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL Catalytic conversion of EL to GVL was performed in a 25mL stainless steel autoclave with Teflon lined reactor under magnetic stirring, and placed in a temperature-controlled oil bath. As a typical run, 1mmol EL, 5mL alcohol as hydrogen donor and solvent, and 0.0721g metal oxide catalyst were charged into the reactor, the vessel was sealed and zero time was taken as soon as the stainless steel autoclave placed into the preheated oil bath at a fixed temperature with stirring. When the reaction finished, the reactor was rapidly cooled to room temperature in water bath, and samples were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC)."
6,Sample analysis,"2.5 Sample analysis EL conversions and yields of the product GVL were quantitatively analyzed on the basis of standard sample curves by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 6890) equipped with FID detector and HP-Innowax column (30m×0.32mm×0.25μm). 1μL injection volume; 1.0mL/min Nitrogen carrier gas; 20:1 split ratio; The injector temperature and detector temperature was 250°C, 270°C, respectively; oven temperature programmed from 60°C (keeping for 1min) to 230°C at a rate of 10°C /min and held for 5min. n-Butyl alcohol was used as an internal standard in GC analysis. Liquid products of the reaction solution were identified by GC–MS (Agilent 6890-5973) with DB-17 capillary column (60m×0.25mm×0.25μm)."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization XRD patterns of different aluminum zirconium catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 a. For ZrO2-600 samples, a series of sharp crystalline peaks occurred at 2θ =28.23°, 30.38°, 31.46°, 34.48°, 50.37°, 60.05°, indicating that ZrO2-600 exhibits a mixture of monoclinic (2θ =28.23°, 31.46°), tetragonal (2θ =30.38°, 34.48°) and cubic phase (2θ =50.37°, 60.05°) [84–87]. In the case of Al2O3-600, three crystalline peaks around 37.1°, 46.2° and 66.6° were observed. A peak at 2θ =37.1° is assigned to the Al2O3 single phase material, and two peaks at 46.2° and 66.6° are characteristic peaks of the cubic γ-alumina, which is the reflection of X-rays from the (400) and (440) crystal planes, respectively [84–89]. It can be clearly observed that XRD peaks of Al–Zr mixed oxides are very different from those of single oxides (i.e., ZrO2 and Al2O3), and only one broad band around 31.7° was observed (Fig. 1a), possibly demonstrating that alumina and zirconia components were combined uniformly. No apparent diffraction peaks except a wide band around 31.7° was observed in the case of Al7Zr3 catalysts calcined at different temperatures (Fig. 1b), which indicated the existence of homogeneous Al–Zr bi-component. Furthermore, SEM images illustrate that the as-prepared catalysts were distributed irregularly with particle sizes around 1–2μm (Fig. S1). Thermal property of Al7Zr3-300 was investigated by TG analysis. As shown in Fig. S2, the first loss (about 9.38%) below 200°C can be assigned to water molecules physical adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. The second weight loss ranging from 350°C to 500°C is ascribed to the decomposition of the hydroxyl groups remaining in the Al–Zr mixed oxide [62,84,90–92]. N2 sorption isotherms of all those as-prepared catalysts exhibited a typical type IV pattern with an H3-type hysteresis loop (Fig. S3), indicating that irregular mesoporous structures are existent among those samples. BET surface areas of prepared catalysts were obtained from N2 adsorption–desorption, as present in Table 1 . The BET surface areas of the Al–Zr mixed oxides calcined at 600°C increase with increasing Al content (Table 1, entries 1–5), and Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C has the largest BET surface area (199.8m2/g) (Table 1, entry 6). Pore size distributions of those samples are shown in Fig. S4. It can be observed that the mean pore sizes and the pore volumes of those as-prepared catalysts range from 3.9 to 11.3nm and 0.04 to 0.24cm3 g−1, respectively (Table S1). XPS spectra of Al (2p) and Zr (3d) for Al7Zr3-600, Al5Zr5-600 and Al3Zr7-600 are illustrated in Fig. S5. Al (2p) spectra of three catalysts are located at around 74eV, demonstrating the valence of aluminum is +3 in the studied Al–Zr nixed oxides [93]. Zr (3d) spectra of three catalysts located at around 182eV and 184eV corresponding to Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 confirm the valence of zirconium is +4 in this Al–Zr mixed oxides [94]. Surface Al/Zr molar ratios of three different molar ratios samples were measured from XPS quantitative measurements (Table S1), which are close to theoretical ratios. The acid strength and density of those as-prepared catalysts were evaluated by NH3-TPD, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. A blank NH3-TPD was conducted to calibrate TCD signals (Fig. S6). It can be obviously seen that all those prepared catalysts mainly possessed weak and moderate acid sites (Fig. 2 and Table 1), and the acid density of Al–Zr mixed oxides calcined at 600°C increases with the increase of Al content (Table 1, entries 1–5). And it is evident to note that Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C possesses a higher amount of acid sites (1.98mmol/g) than the rest (Table 1, entry 6). The base strength and content of those prepared catalysts (including a blank one) were also determined by CO2-TPD (Fig. S7). Similar to acidity, the basicity of those catalysts mainly belongs to weak and moderate base sites (Fig. S7 and Table S2), and the base density of the Al–Zr mixed oxides calcined at 600°C increases with increasing Al content (Table S2, entry 1–5). It is also clear to note that the Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C possesses the largest amount of base sites (1.35mmol/g) among those samples (Table S2, entry 6). Thus, the addition of Al is not only in favor of enlarging surface area but also beneficial to enhance acid and base amount for Al–Zr mixed oxides calcined at 600°C. And Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C has the highest BET surface area (199.8m2/g) and the largest amount of acid sites (1.98mmol/g) and base sites (1.35mmol/g) of those catalysts. It is speculated that two reasons may account for Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C possessing the highest amount of acid sites and base sites. On the one hand, Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C bearing higher surface area is more accessible to NH3 and CO2 gases, leading to the increase in acid and base density, respectively. On the other hand, the amount of acid (OH) and base (O2−) sites was reported to decrease with the increase of calcination temperatures for sole ZrO2 and Al2O3 [62,95,96], as well as mixed oxides [97,98]. Therefore, the moderate calcination temperature of 300°C facilitates Al–Zr mixed oxides to bear more acidic OH groups and basic sites (e.g., O2− anions), besides high surface areas, thus rendering the catalyst more accessible to NH3 and CO2. It was reported that the MPV reduction could be promoted by the synergetic effect of Lewis acid and base [99]. Thus, the acid properties of Al–Zr mixed oxides calcined at 600°C were further evaluated by FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption. As shown in Fig. 3 , the band at 1452cm−1, which is characteristic of Lewis acid, can be found in the spectra of those three catalysts. No characteristic band of Bronsted acid, located at 1540cm−1, was observed; and the band at 1494cm−1 further confirmed the presence of Lewis acid species. Therefore, it can be concluded that those samples calcined at 600°C contain Lewis acid sites without measurable amounts of Bronsted acid sites. Notably, the content of Lewis acid is significantly enhanced with the addition of Al to ZrO2 (Fig. 3). In addition, the band around 1618cm−1, assigned to other pyridine adsorption peak [100], is also detected. The acid type of Al7Zr3-300 catalyst was also measured by FT-IR spectrum of pyridine adsorption (Fig. S8). The band at 1535cm−1 is characteristic of Bronsted acid, which can be resulted from the remaining hydroxyl groups of Al7Zr3-300 catalyst. The result is consistent with the deduction that the moderate calcination temperature of 300°C facilitates Al–Zr mixed oxides to bear more acidic OH groups and basic sites (e.g., O2− anions), while high calcination temperature (e.g., 600°C) will decompose the hydroxyl groups, as demonstrated by TG analysis."
9,Effect of the ratio of aluminum zirconium,"3.2 Effect of the ratio of aluminum zirconium In order to obtain the appropriate ratio of aluminum to zirconium for efficient production of GVL from EL in 2-propanol, Al–Zr mixed oxides calcined at 600°C were selected for initial evaluation, and results are given in Fig. 4 a. It can be clearly seen that the catalytic performance of Al7Zr3 (56.8% EL conversion and 44.9% GVL yield) is screened to be superior to the rest counterparts (i.e., Al3Zr7 and Al5Zr5) at 180°C for 6h. It seems the catalytic activity of those catalysts is increased with the increase of Al content, which is in agreement with the increased number of acid and base sites as well as surface area, as clearly demonstrated in Table 1 (entries 1–5), Table S2 (entries 1–5), and Fig. S9. For sole Al2O3-600, although the density and surface area of Al2O3 are higher than others especially ZrO2-600, the GVL yield cannot compare with others. To shed light on this phenomenon, the reaction mixtures catalyzed by Al2O3-600 and ZrO2-600 (at 180°C for 6h) were both detected by GC–MS (Fig. S10). It was found that Al2O3-600 other than ZrO2-600 was more prone to facilitate the formation of 2-propyl levulinate (10% vs. 2% yield). In comparison to EL, 2-propyl levulinate was much more difficult to be converted into GVL [31], which is also consistent with the work of Dumesic’s group [61]. Furthermore, yields, selectivities, and formation rates of GVL in the presence of various mixed oxides with different Al/Zr molar ratios reacting at 180°C were measured at a consistent EL conversion of around 10%. As can be seen from Fig. 4b, Al7Zr3-600 shows the highest catalytic activity among those catalysts with respect to GVL formation rate, yield, and selectivity. It is indicated that the addition of aluminum into zirconia not only increases the GVL yield and selectivity but also enhances the GVL formation rate. Therefore, the Al7Zr3 catalyst was selected for subsequent studies."
10,Effect of Al7Zr3 calcined at different temperature,"3.3 Effect of Al7Zr3 calcined at different temperature It was reported that morphological structure of zirconia directly affected its catalytic activity in the production of GVL [62]. Herein, the catalytic activity of Al7Zr3 calcined at different temperatures was tested for the catalytic conversion of EL into GVL in 2-propanol at 180°C for 6h. It can be seen from Fig. 5 a that the calcination temperature of Al7Zr3 has a significant influence on the synthesis of GVL, and Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C exhibited superior performance with 82.9% conversion of EL and 67.9% yield of GVL to others, which is probably related to the catalyst (calcined at 300°C) possessing relatively higher surface area (199.8m2/g) and larger acid (1.98mmol/g) and base amount (1.35mmol/g) (Table 1, Table S2, and Fig. S11). Similarly, the yields, selectivities, and formation rates of GVL in the presence of Al7Zr3 calcined at different temperatures reacting at 180°C were also measured at a consistent EL conversion of around 10%, and results are present in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that GVL yields and selectivities of Al7Zr3 catalysts with different calcination temperatures were not significantly different when EL conversion maintained around 10%. However, Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C showed the highest GVL formation rate among various Al7Zr3 catalysts, indicating that appropriate adjustment of acid and base sites of Al7Zr3 materials could accelerate the reaction rate. Thus, the Al7Zr3 catalyst calcined at 300°C was selected for further studies."
11,Effect of reaction temperature and time,"3.4 Effect of reaction temperature and time The effect of reaction temperature and time on the production of GVL from EL was studied, and all experiments were conducted at 180, 200, and 220°C with the reaction time in the range of 1 to 10h, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 6 , it can be seen that both reaction temperature and time show a remarkable influence on the conversion of EL into GVL. For example, only 12.7% yield of GVL was obtained when the reaction was carried out at 180°C for 1h; whereas the GVL yield could reach 72.7% after reacting for 10h. However, GVL yield was elevated from 50.5% to 83.2% as the reaction temperature increased from 180 to 220°C within 4h. It seems that a long time is needed to acquire higher yield when the reaction is conducted at a lower temperature since EL being converted to GVL proceeds an intermediate ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (4-HPE) through the reversible MPV reduction (Scheme 1); while both reaction rates and GVL yields are elevated at higher temperatures (Fig. 6), which may favor the reversible reaction moving to the right direction. At the same time, it was found that beyond 4h of reaction time, the yield of GVL was increased a little. The yield of GVL was increased by only 4.4% when the time increased from 4 to 10h. Those observations suggest that the reaction time beyond 4h hardly affects the GVL yield. From an economical point of view, 220°C and 4h was thus selected as optimal temperature and time, respectively, for further investigation."
12,Effect of catalyst dosage,"3.5 Effect of catalyst dosage The effect of catalyst dosage on GVL yield from EL was studied and results are presented in Fig.S12. Those experiments were conducted through changing the mass ratio of EL to the catalyst in the range 4:1 to 1:2 and other reaction conditions kept constant. Obviously, EL conversion and GVL yield were increased with increasing the catalyst dosage at first, which should be mainly attributed to more available number of catalytically active sites. When the mass ratio of EL and catalyst decreased from 4:1 to 2:1, the conversion of EL and yield of GVL increased from 76.3% and 65.8% to 95.5% and 83.2%, respectively. When the mass ratio of EL and catalyst reached to 1:1, 88.6% yield of GVL at complete EL conversion was achieved. However, further increase of catalyst dosage led to the GVL yield decreased to 83.7% although the EL was still completely converted. It was proposed that the excess use of the catalyst at a high temperature of 220°C would facilitate the formation of by-products as detected by GC–MS (Fig. S13), thus resulting in the decrease of GVL yield. Reaction pathways were thus deduced, as shown in Scheme S1. The main by-product was identified to be 1 (2-propyl levulinate) formed by transesterification between EL and 2-propanol, while the intermediate 4-HPE was not detectable, indicating that the catalytic conversion of 4-HPE into GVL was quite fast. All these observations are consistent with a previous study by Dumesic et al. [61]. Meanwhile, other by-products like 2 and 3 (Scheme S1) were also detected, supporting the proposed reaction routes (Scheme S1). It was worthy mentioned that the GVL yield increased by only 5.3% when the catalyst dosage further increased (equal to the mass of EL), indicating that the GVL yield marginally increased but more catalyst was utilized. From an economical and practical point of view, the mass ratio of EL and catalyst was set at 2:1 and selected for subsequent experiments."
13,Effect of different alcohol as hydrogen donor,"3.6 Effect of different alcohol as hydrogen donor It is well known that hydrogen source is an important factor for the production of GVL from EL through the CTH process. The effect of various alcohols, including methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), 2-propanol (2-PrOH), sec-butyl alcohol (2-BuOH) and cyclohexanol (CylOH), were thus examined to acquire the optimum hydrogen donor. As given in Fig. 7 , it is clearly found that secondary alcohols show the better performance than primary alcohols, which may be related to the reduction potential of alcohols [66,101]. Only 3.4% yield of GVL was obtained when methanol was used as hydrogen source. Cyclohexanol tends to adsorb around the active sites of the mixed oxides, which is prone to interfere the contact between active sites and EL [101], thus showing inferior EL conversion to 2-propanol and sec-butyl alcohol, but with high selectivity owing to the less active sites accessible for side reactions. Therefore, 2-propanol or sec-butyl alcohol was determined to be the best hydrogen donor in this catalytic system."
14,Poisoning and leaching experiments,"3.7 Poisoning and leaching experiments To investigate the effect of Lewis acid and base sites on the production of GVL from EL, piperidine and benzoic acid were added into the reaction system to poison acid [102] and base sites [66], respectively. As shown in Table S3, it is clearly seen that the addition of either piperidine or benzoic acid sharply reduces the yield and formation rate of GVL as well as TOF value, illustrating the synergic role of acid–base sites of Al7Zr3-300 in the production of GVL from EL. To verify whether the catalytic process was heterogeneous or homogeneous, the Al7Zr3-300 catalyst was removed from the reaction solution by filtration after reacting for 2h at 220°C. The filtrate without solid catalyst was continued to react at 220°C for another 2–8h. As shown in Fig. S14, stable yields of GVL (around 49%) were observed after removal of the Al7Zr3-300 catalyst, while a sharp increase in GVL yield was detected in the presence of the catalyst for reacting an additional 2h. Moreover, the ICP analysis of the solution demonstrates that below 0.5ppm zirconium and 0.7ppm aluminium anions leached into the alcoholic solution. These results demonstrated that Al7Zr3-300 was heterogeneous in the production of GVL from EL."
15,Catalyst recycling,"3.8 Catalyst recycling It is of great importance and significance to prepare a catalyst with good recyclability. The catalytic stability of the Al7Zr3-300 catalyst was investigated for the conversion of EL to GVL in 5mL 2-propanol under the same conditions. After the reaction was finished, the reused catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed with water, ethanol and acetone three times in the ultrasonic respectively, dried at 100°C for 2h and subsequently calcined at 300°C for 4h, then the recovered catalyst was used for the next run under the identical reaction conditions. The results are presented in Fig. 8 , a visibly decrease in yield of GVL and conversion of EL are found in four consecutive cycles. It was reported that some organic compounds, which were considered as by-products, would be formed in the production of GVL from EL through CTH process [66]. We inferred that some of insoluble organics or polymers were generated from those organic compounds including by-products, unreacted EL, synthesized GVL, and some intermediates through a series of reactions such as aldol addition and condensation. After reusing for four consecutive cycles, the regenerated Al7Zr3-300 by calcination at 300°C for 10h exhibited GVL yield (82.4%) as high as the fresh catalyst (83.2%). To shed light on the deactivation of Al7Zr3-300 after successively used for four times and its regeneration through calcination at 300°C for 4 or 10h, XRD, TG analyses, N2-adsorption–desorption, elemental analyses and TPD were used to characterize the fresh and used Al7Zr3-300 catalysts. Fig. S15 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh and used Al7Zr3-300 catalysts, it is clearly seen that the Al7Zr3-300 catalyst after one run almost shows no changes in comparison with fresh Al7Zr3-300; nevertheless, the Al7Zr3-300 after three successive runs exhibits a lower GVL yield, which may be resulted from insoluble organics deposited on the surface of the catalyst. Fig. S16 illustrates the TG analyses of fresh Al7Zr3-300, used Al7Zr3-300 catalysts (after four times) calcined at 300°C for 4h or 10h. 24.5% of loss weight in total was observed for used Al7Zr3-300 catalyst (after four times) calcined at 300°C for 4h, which was larger than that of fresh Al7Zr3-300. It was indicated that the deactivation of Al7Zr3-300 after successively used four times could be ascribed to insoluble organics or polymer deposits on the used catalyst, and calcination of the catalyst for 4h at 300°C may be not fully enough to remove the organic matters. By prolonging the calcination time from 4 to 10h, the total loss weight of the used Al7Zr3-300 catalyst was less (Fig. S16), which demonstrated that insoluble organics or polymer deposited on the used catalyst could be significantly removed after longer calcination time at 300°C. Moreover, the deduction could be further confirmed by the carbon residues and BET surface areas of those fresh and used catalysts (Table S4 and Fig. S17). The concentrations of both acid and base sites of the used Al7Zr3-300 catalyst after four times calcined at 300°C for 10h were evaluated by NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD, respectively (Fig. S18). The total acid and base density of the regenerated Al7Zr3-300 catalyst (i.e., the Al7Zr3-300 catalyst was recovered in the fourth cycle and calcined at 300°C for 10h) was 1.87 and 1.28 mmol/g, respectively, which were close to those of the fresh Al7Zr3-300 catalyst (total acid and base density: 1.98 and 1.35mmol/g, respectively). Therefore, carbon deposits, leading to the deactivation of the Al7Zr3-300 catalyst after four successive cycles, could be removed by regeneration of the catalyst at a calcination temperature of 300°C for 10h. The catalytic performance of Al7Zr3-300 was further compared with those of reported catalysts in the production of GVL from levulinic acid or its esters in alcohols. As shown in Table S5, the Al7Zr3-300 catalyst was found to exhibit comparable catalytic activity with other catalysts. In this respect, Al7Zr3-300 prepared through this cheap and facile approach shows a promising potential to be used a heterogeneous catalyst for converting biomass derivatives into GVL."
16,Conclusions,"In this study, a series of Al2O3–ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by a simply co-precipitation method, and the morphologies and catalytic activities of those prepared catalysts were characterized and investigated for conversion of EL to GVL. Various reaction parameters, such as Al/Zr mole ratios, calcination temperature, reaction temperature and reaction time, catalyst dosage, and different alcohols as hydrogen donor, have been studied. Al7Zr3 calcined at 300°C was found to exhibit the highest catalytic activity for the production of GVL from EL. A high GVL yield of 83.2% with an excellent EL conversion of 95.5% was obtained when 2-propanol was used as hydrogen donor at 220°C for 4h. Notably, a maximum GVL yield of 88.6% could be achieved while the mass ratio of EL and Al7Zr3-300 reached 1:1. It could be concluded that the addition of Al to ZrO2 enlarged the surface area as well as increased the number of catalytic effective acid and base sites on those catalysts for producing GVL from EL. Moreover, the increased contents of acid sites along with the introduction of Al species into mixed oxides were almost assigned to Lewis acid sites, which could promote the CTH process for GVL production. Poisoning and leaching experiments verified that the acid–base properties might contribute to superior activity of Al7Zr3-300 in the production of GVL from EL, and that the catalytic system was truly heterogeneous. Furthermore, a slight loss on catalytic activity could be observed after the catalyst was reused four times, which was demonstrated to be caused by the insoluble organic species deposited on the surface of Al7Zr3-300 catalyst, as clarified by XRD, TG analyses, N2 adsorption–desorption, and elemental analyses. Fortunately, the regeneration of recovered Al7Zr3-300 by calcination at 300°C for 10h showed comparable activity to the fresh counterpart. Therefore, the Al–Zr mixed oxide catalysts described herein with simple and cost-effective preparation procedure, high catalyst activity, and acceptable reusability show a great potential for production of GVL from biomass derivatives."
