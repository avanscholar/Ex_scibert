0,Introduction,"Over the past few decades, aerogels are attractive three-dimensional porous materials due to their fascinating properties such as low density, low thermal conductivity, high aspect ratio and low dielectric constant [1]. Aerogels have acquired a wide variety of applications in the field of thermal insulation [2–4], catalyst carriers [5,6], superabsorbents [7–9], electrodes [10,11], and flame retardant materials [12–14]. Aerogels are typically divided into inorganic and polymeric aerogels according to their back bone materials. Inorganic aerogels, such as silica aerogels, possess superhydrophobicity and superior fire resistance, but generally display fragile nature [15,16]. Polymer aerogels can be prepared through supercritical CO2 extraction [17,18] or freeze-drying process [19], which usually exhibit better fracture toughness than inorganic aerogels. However, polymer aerogels are composed of organics, and thus apt to be easily ignited which has restricted their application. Therefore, it is urgent demand for developing polymer aerogels with superior flame-retardancy as well as other desirable properties, such as low density, self-cleaning capacity, and low thermal conductivity. Hybrid inorganic/polymer composite aerogels have demonstrated to be effective to improve the fire resistance of polymer aerogels as well as retaining their intrinsic properties. Recently, various inorganic nano-materials, including graphene oxide and sepiolite nanorods [20], graphene/montmorillonite hybrid [13], molybdenum disulfide [21], and magnesium hydroxide [22], have been incorporated into polymer aerogels and the resultant composite aerogels display significantly improved fire resistance. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aerogels have received increasing attention owing to the water soluble, biocompatible and biodegradable nature of the PVA [9,15,23]. In order to overcome the high fire hazards of PVA, the co-addition of aluminum oxide or ammonium polyphosphate with clay into PVA aerogels reduced the heat release rate of the ternary systems [24]. In another study, several nano-fillers, including silica, halloysite, montmorillonite, and laponite, were added to PVA aerogels and both the heat release and the smoke production were significantly decreased in the cone calorimetry tests [25]. However, PVA is a hydrophilic polymer in nature, and its aerogels are apt to absorb moisture and thus induce the collapse of the porous structure. This drawback could limit their applications such as building insulating materials. In the literature aforementioned, considerable efforts have been focused on the improvement in fire resistance of PVA aerogels but their hydrophilicity has been seldom concerned. Based on the organic–inorganic composite technology, we chose hydroxyapatite (HAP) as the inorganic component owing to its biocompatibility, no toxicity and inflammability. In the previous work, HAP has been reported to impart good flame retardant properties to various polymers including polycarbonate [26], epoxy resin [27] and PVA [28]. In the current study, PVA composite aerogels with a series of different loading of HAP were fabricated through the freeze-drying method. Subsequently, PVA-HAP composite aerogels were facile modified by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to confer superhydrophobic property. Their microstructure, mechanical property, thermal property, fire resistance and superhydrophobicity have been discussed, as well as a proposed mechanism for improved fire retardancy."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Mw = ∼67 000 g mol−1) was purchased from Aladdin Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, Ammonium phosphate dibasic, and ammonia were all obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer (Sylgard 184A) and the curing agent (Sylgard 184B) were supplied from Dow Corning Corporation (Shanghai, China). All the reagents were used as received."
3,Synthesis of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanofibers,"2.2 Synthesis of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanofibers The hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanofibers were synthesized as followed: Briefly, Ca(NO3)2 aqueous solution (300 ml, 0.1 mol L−1) was charged into a beaker, and its pH value was adjusted to 11 by ammonia. Then, (NH4)2HPO4 aqueous solution (180 ml, 0.1 mol L−1) was added dropwise into the Ca(NO3)2 aqueous solution under agitation. During this period, the pH value of the mixture was maintained at 11 by ammonia. After the completion of (NH4)2HPO4 addition, the mixture was stirred for 24 h and then kept still for another 24 h. The resultant slurry was filtered and washed by deionized water."
4,Synthesis of PVA-HAP composite aerogels,"2.3 Synthesis of PVA-HAP composite aerogels A series of PVA-HAP composite aerogels with the mass ratio of 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1 was prepared. For fabrication of the typical PVA-HAP aerogel sample (1:1), HAP suspension (50 ml, 30 mg ml−1) were mixed with PVA solution (30 ml, 50 mg ml−1) under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature for 6 h. Subsequently, the mixture was frozen at −60 °C for 24 h and then freeze-dried into the PVA-HAP composite areogel. The PVA aerogel was prepared by a similar procedure just without adding HAP. The surface modification of PVA-HAP composite aerogels was facile achieved by immersing the as-prepared aerogels in chloroform solution containing 2 wt% Sylgard 184A and 0.2 wt % Sylgard 184B for 2 min and subsequent dried at 80 °C for 2 h."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) using KBr disc method. The morphology of the samples was observed using a JSM-6700F scanning electron microscopy (JEOL, Japan). The samples were sputtered with a conductive layer of gold prior to observation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Dmax/rA diffractometer (Japan) using copper Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm), operating at 40 kV voltage and 20 mA current. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was measured on a TA Q5000 thermal analyzer (USA) in air atmosphere from 30 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C·min−1. Thermal conductivity was determined by the TC 3000E Thermal Analysis System (Xiaxi technology, China) at ambient temperature. Five parallels were tested for each sample, and the average value was reported. N2 adsorption−desorption isotherms were performed at 77 K using ASAP 2460 surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Instruments, USA). The specific surface area was calculated according to the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method. Thermographic images were captured using a FLIR A655sc infrared thermography (FLIR Company, USA). The samples were measured on a hot plate and the temperature range was set from 30 to 80 °C. The fire retardant performance was evaluated by vertical burning tests. The cylindrical aerogel samples with the height and diameter of 100 mm and 15 mm were used. The bottom of the samples was exposed to the flame for 10 s, and then the Bunsen burner was removed. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) values were obtained by Oxygen Index Meter (Jiangning, China) according to the ASTM D2863-2008 method. The combustion behaviors of the samples were assessed by a cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology, UK) following the standard ISO 5660-1. Squared specimens (100 mm × 100 mm × 10 mm) were horizontally exposed to a heat flux of 50 kW m−2. Compression tests were carried out on a CMT6104 Electromechanical Universal Testing Machine (MTS Systems Co., China). The compression strain rate was set at 2 mm min−1, and the cylindrical aerogels with a diameter of 15 mm and a height of 15 mm were used. Five parallels for each sample were tested for reproducibility according to the ASTM D3575-14 standard. The contact angle was determined by a SL200KS Optical Contact Angle Meter (Solon Tech. Co., Ltd., China) at ambient temperature. At least six parallels were tested and the average value was reported for each sample."
6,Results and discussion,"The PVA−HAP composite aerogels were prepared by an environmentally friendly freeze-drying method which has been widely applied in recent years. Typically, the well-dispersed HAP aqueous suspension with diameters of about 20 nm (Fig. 1 a) was mixed with PVA solution at different mass ratio. The as-prepared cylindrical PVA-HAP composite aerogel could stand up on a rose without breaking its petals (Fig. 1b), implying that the composite aerogel is very light. In fact, the density of PVA-HAP composite aerogels ranged from 108.0 to 113.0 mg cm−3, and the porosity was estimated to be 90.6%–95.0% (Table 1 ). The morphological features of PVA aerogel, PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2 . PVA aerogel exhibited a hierarchical porous structure with interconnected pore sizes ranging from several nanometers to micrometers (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel showed a much rougher surface and the average pore sizes became larger (Fig. 2b). To further demonstrate the presence of HAP, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of Ca and P distributions in Fig. 2b are displayed Fig. 2c and d, respectively. The Ca and P elements were uniformly distributed within the PVA-HAP composite aerogel without obvious aggregates, indicating that the method reported herein is feasible to produce the PVA-HAP composite aerogel with a high degree of homogeneity. X-ray diffraction was further performed to characterize the microstructure of the PVA-HAP composite aerogels, as shown in Fig. 3 . The XRD profile of HAP exhibited several characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.0°, 32.0°, 34.2°, 39.8°, and 49.6°, which can be well indexed to HAP (JCPDS No. 09-0432) [29,30]. Virgin PVA aerogel exhibited a quite broad diffraction peak centered at 2θ = 22.6°, suggesting the formation of an amorphous phase induced by the freeze-drying process. With the increase of HAP content, the relative intensity of the characteristic diffraction peak from HAP increased gradually in the XRD profile, whereas the broad diffraction peak derived from PVA species disappeared. The XRD results implied that the three-dimensional networks of PVA and HAP formed without destructing the crystal phases of HAP. FTIR spectra analysis can provide important information about the composite structure. Fig. 4 presents the FTIR spectra of virgin PVA aerogel, HAP powder and PVA-HAP composite aerogel. The FTIR spectrum of virgin PVA aerogel showed a broad and strong band centered at 3435 cm−1, corresponding to the presence of hydroxyl groups. The bands at around 2927 and 2850 cm−1 were assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of methylene group. The bands at 1386 and 1110 cm−1 can be attributed to the bending of C-H and the stretching of C-O-C, respectively. In the case of HAP, some characteristic bands were identified as the stretching of hydroxyl group (3436 cm−1), the stretching mode of carbonate (1390 cm−1) [31], the bending vibration of O-P-O (605 cm−1) and the ν3 and ν4 P-O vibration modes of phosphate groups (1037 and 565 cm−1) [31]. FTIR spectrum of PVA-HAP-1 exhibited the combined characteristic bands of both PVA and HAP. The band position of the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups was shifted to lower frequency (3425 cm−1) in contrast to that of either PVA or HAP, indicating the formation of hydrogen bonding interaction between PVA and HAP. The TGA and DTG curves of HAP, PVA and PVA-HAP composite aerogels under air atmosphere are displayed in Fig. 5 a. HAP was thermally stable and no significant mass loss was observed until 800 °C. PVA aerogel and PVA-HAP composite aerogels showed a three-stage degradation behavior. The first stage below 100 °C was attributed to the evaporation of water owing to the hydrophilic nature of PVA. The second mass loss stage was ranged from 200 to 400 °C, which was assigned to the decomposition of backbone of PVA. The third stage, between 400 °C and 530 °C, was caused by the further oxidative degradation of the char formed in the second stage. Furthermore, from DTG profiles, it can be seen that the maximum mass loss rate of the PVA-HAP composite aerogels was much lower than that of PVA aerogel, implying that the formation of hierarchical structure with interconnected HAP served as an effective barrier to slow down the mass loss rate during the thermal degradation process. The thermal conductivity coefficient (λ) of PVA aerogel and PVA-HAP composite aerogels under ambient temperature is presented in Fig. 5b. The pristine PVA aerogel exhibited good thermal insulation with the thermal conductivity measured to be 40.8 mW m−1 K−1 at ambient temperature. The incorporation of HAP decreased the thermal conductivity of the resultant PVA-HAP composite aerogels (λ = 33.6–38.7 mW m−1 K−1). These values are comparable or even better in comparison to those reported for the commercial insulation materials such as fiberglass (λ = 33–44 mW m−1 K−1), polystyrene foams (λ = 30–40 mW m−1 K−1), and cellulose (λ = 40–50 mW m−1 K−1) [32]. The thermal conductivity of the HAP aerogel was reported to be 50 mW m−1 K−1 [33], which was higher than that of the pristine PVA aerogel. The reduced thermal conductivity of the resultant PVA-HAP composite aerogels can be attributed to the microstructure of the pore walls. The PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel showed a BET surface area of 3.94 m2/g (Fig. S1). The pore size distribution plot (inset in Fig. S1) was obtained using the BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) method applied on the desorption branch of the isotherm. The BJH analysis revealed mesoporous structure with a diameter range of 1–15 nm, which can be associated to pores located in the aerogel walls. Such a nanostructured composite aerogel wall dramatically reduced the gaseous conductivity. Thermographic images (Fig. 5c–f) demonstrated the effective thermal insulation in both the axial and radial directions of the PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogels. Compared to pristine PVA aerogel (Fig. 5c and d), the heated volume of the PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel was smaller and the temperature distribution was more uniform (Fig. 5e and f). These results aforementioned demonstrated that the PVA-HAP composite aerogel was an excellent thermal insulating material. The flame retardancy of the as-prepared PVA-HAP composite aerogels was evaluated by vertical burning tests. The PVA aerogel was easily ignited, and the flame spread was fast and engulfed the whole sample within 10 s (Top row in Fig. 6 ). Dripping was also observed for the pristine PVA aerogel, and nothing was left at the end of the aforementioned burning tests. The PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel, in contrast, displayed a self-extinguishing behavior once the burner flame was removed. The sample still retained the original shape except for some black dust on its surface (Bottom row in Fig. 6). Additionally, the PVA-HAP-2 and PVA-HAP-3 composite aerogels showed excellent flame retardancy and the flame immediately self-extinguished when the burner was removed (Movies S1 and S2 in the supporting information). The LOI values of the PVA and PVA-HAP composite aerogels are listed in Table 1. The addition of HAP slightly increased LOI values of the composite aerogels. The porous structure of the aerogels was filled of air which resulted in rapid flame spread in the LOI tests. Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.01.020. The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Movie 1 3 Movie 1 Movie 2 4 Movie 2 Cone calorimetry was further adopted to assess the flame-retardant properties of the PVA and PVA-HAP composite aerogels. The average values of some important fire-hazard parameters including peak heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), time to ignition (TTI), average effective heat of combustion (av-EHC), specific extinction area (SEA), and carbon monoxide (CO) production, are displayed in Fig. 7 and summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen from Fig. 7a that pristine PVA aerogel displayed an intense heat release peak (610 kW m−2) upon ignition, suggesting a highly flammable material. The addition of HAP led to a significant reduction in PHRR value of the PVA-HAP composite aerogels. The most striking result was observed in the PHRR value of the PVA-HAP-3 composite aerogel (129 kW m−2), corresponding to a 79% reduction in comparison to that of the PVA aerogel. The hierarchical network structure of HAP within the composite aerogels served as thermally stable physical barrier, and thus the heat release rate was restrained. Accompanying with the significantly reduced PHRR values of PVA-HAP composite aerogels, the TTI values were also decreased, which was not an expected result (Table 2). This phenomenon may be resulted from the rapid temperature increase on the surface of the composite aerogels because thermal diffusion was hindered by the improved melt viscosity of such materials [34]. Similar trend was also observed in the time to PHRR values. As aforementioned, the thermal diffusion within the composite aerogels was hindered due to the reduced thermal conductivity, and thus the rapid temperature increase led to the earlier time to PHRR. The fire growth rate index (FIGRA), calculated by the ratio of PHRR and time to PHRR [35], is usually used to evaluate the flame propagation rate of building products. The FIGRA of the PVA aerogel was found to be 19.1 kW m−2 s−1 (Table 2), implying very fast fire spread when burning. As expected, the PVA-HAP composite aerogels showed significantly reduced FIGRA values, indicating the suppressed fire hazard quality of the materials. The THR versus time curves (Fig. 7b) showed that pristine PVA aerogel released heat very quickly and reached the maximum value (14.54 MJ m−2) at the end of combustion. With the increase of the HAP content, the THR of the PVA-HAP composite aerogels gradually decreased. The SEA, corresponding to the smoke released during combustion of samples, is plotted as a function of the burning time in Fig. 7c. All of the PVA-HAP composite aerogels showed notable decreased SEA compared to that of pristine PVA aerogel. The reduced SEA can be explained by that the presence of HAPs restrained PVA molecules from converting into the organic volatiles, since the organic volatiles are the major source of smoke particles [36]. This phenomenon was also supported by the reduced av-EHC values (Table 2). The addition of HAPs resulted in the decreased trend in av-EHC, implying that the lower amount of volatile gases (fuels) escaped into gaseous-phase. CO production, corresponding to the toxicity of gas released from combustion of samples, is the major reason for casualties in fire incidents. The CO production versus time curve (Fig. 7d) showed that the CO production of the composite aerogels was obviously decreased with the incorporation of HAPs, which was much lower than that of PVA. The dramatic reduction in toxic CO production together with smoke is beneficial to evacuation and fire rescue when an incident happens. From the digital photograph of the char residue, it can be observed that only a small amount of char dots was left after the cone calorimeter test for the PVA aerogel (Fig. 7e). In contrast, the PVA-HAP-3 composite aerogel showed a thick residue with almost no volume shrink (Fig. 7f), demonstrating the microstructure stability due to the presence of HAP network. The structure of the char residue after cone calorimetry was further measured by XRD. The XRD of this residue (Fig. 7g) was almost the same as that of the pritine HAP before burning, demonstrating that the HAP was highly stable and remained after burning. The presence of HAP formed a thick residue with high thermal stability, which served as a physical barrier to retard the mass and heat transfer between PVA matrix and flame. As a result, the PHRR, THR and SEA of the composite aerogels were found to be lowered than the pure one. The freestanding mechanical properties of the PVA-HAP composite aerogel are highlighted in Fig. 8 a, in which it can be observed that a heavy load (ca. 2 kg) can be supported by a 1.2 g PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel, almost 1700 times relative to its own weight, with no deformation. The mechanical properties of the PVA and PVA-HAP composite aerogels were further assessed by compressive strain-stress measurements. As shown in Fig. 8b and Table 3 , the stress at 50% strain of the PVA-HAP-3 composite aerogel (159.6 kPa) was more than two times higher than that of the PVA aerogel (76.9 kPa). Also, the compressive modulus of the PVA-HAP composite aerogels gradually increased with the increase of HAP loading. The compressive modulus of the PVA-HAP-3 composite aerogel (6.4 MPa) was three times higher than that of the PVA aerogel (2.1 MPa). The specific modulus, calculated by the ratio of modulus and density, of the PVA-HAP composite aerogel was ranged from 29.4 to 58.7 kN m kg−1, which is much higher than that of silica aerogels (5–20 kN m kg−1) [1] and is comparable to the values reported for polystyrene and polyurethane foams (10–100 kN m kg−1) [20]. The significant improvement in mechanical properties may be attributed to two aspects: (1) the HAPs with excellent mechanical properties enabled them desirable reinforcing nanofiller for polymers [37,38]; (2) strong interaction between the homogeneously dispersed HAPs and PVA through the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups present on both HAPs and PVA. Aerogels for insulating materials application should, ideally, have water-repellent and self-cleaning behaviors. The wettability of the untreated and PDMS-coated PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel samples was tested by the dynamic contact angle measurement using distilled water. The static contact angle of the pristine PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel was close to 100° initially, but decreased quickly to 40° (Fig. 9 ), indicating that PVA was hydrophilic and thus, further hydrophobic modification was essential to attach the water-repellent behavior. In contrast, the PDMS-modified PVA-HAP-1 composite aerogel displayed an initial contact angle larger than 150° which was almost retained over time (Fig. 9). In addition, the presence of PDMS showed little impact on the vertical burning performance of the resultant composite aerogel (Fig. S2). The influence of PDMS on the flame retardant properties was further checked by cone calorimetry tests (Table 2 and Fig. S3). The incorporation of PDMS did not affect the TTI and the time to PHRR, and slightly increased the PHRR and THR, which could be attributed to a substantial number of organic species in PDMS. These results demonstrated that superhydrophobic PVA-HAP composite aerogel with flame-retardant properties can be fabricated via facile modification with PDMS."
7,Conclusion,"In summary, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-hydroxyapatite (HAP) composite aerogel was shown to exhibit excellent flame retardancy, high compressive modulus and low thermal conductivity due to incorporation of HAP. The PVA-HAP composite aerogel with the mass ratio of 1:1 showed exceptionally superior resistance to flame and self-extinguishing behaviours in vertical burning tests. The cone calorimetry measurements demonstrated that the fire hazards of the PVA-HAP composite aerogel, including peak heat release rate, total heat release, average effective heat of combustion, specific extinction area, and carbon monoxide production, decreased significantly, all of which were much lower than those for pristine PVA aerogel and polyurethane foam. In addition, the PVA-HAP composite aerogels also exhibited a relatively low density (108.0–113.0 mg cm−3), a high Young's modulus (3.3–6.4 MPa), and low thermal conductivity (33.6–38.7 mW m−1 K−1). After a facile polydimethylsiloxane treatment, the resultant PVA-HAP composite aerogels also exhibited water-repellent and self-cleaning capacity. The superior integrated properties of the resultant PVA-HAP composite aerogels were attributed to the combination of inflammable HAPs with flexible PVA as well as the hydrogen bonding between the HAPs and the PVA matrix."
