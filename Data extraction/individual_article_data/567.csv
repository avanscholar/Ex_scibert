0,Introduction,"Along with the increasing public environmental awareness in recent years, interest in the production of biochemicals and biofuels from biomass, especially lignocellulosic biomass, which is a high-potential renewable feedstock [1], has been growing considerably. This is not only because the current oil price is high and the fossil fuel resources are limited, but also because the modern petroleum-based economy causes numerous negative environmental effects. Therefore, more intense investigations are required to such that biorefinery processes can be more cost-competitive with petrorefinery processes that have been already developed at the levels of high efficiency and integration.In terms of biochemicals, furfural, which is listed as a top-30 potential chemical from biomass by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is considered as a key renewable platform compound for products that can compete with fossil-based fuels and chemicals. Particularly, furfuryl alcohol (FFA), in which up to 65% of all furfural produced is used as the raw material for its manufacture currently [2], has become the most important derivative from furfural. FFA is critical in foundry technology and is used extensively to produce high-quality cores and molds for metal casting for the past 50 years [3]. Additionally, the only method to produce furfural is from hemicellulose-rich agricultural wastes [3]; thus, FFA and other furfural derivatives can be considered as “green chemicals,” and is the key environment-friendly chemical in C5-based biorefinery for a more sustainable future. FFA production from lignocellulosic biomass at the industrial scale includes four primary steps, as shown in Fig. 1 . First, hemicellulose-rich biomasses such as corn cob and oat hull undergo the pretreatment process before being introduced to the reaction step where furfural is produced. In furfural reactors, pentosan is hydrolyzed to pentose, and pentose is continuously hydrated to furfural using sulfuric acid as a catalyst. The gaseous raw furfural stream is delivered to a series of distillation columns to achieve the desired purity. The furfural product is subsequently input into the FFA reactor in which FFA is produced by the hydrogenation of furfural in the vapor phase using a copper chromite catalyst. It is noteworthy that furfural can convert into FFA by a liquid-phase or vapor-phase; however, the vapor-phase reaction is currently used in all large FFA production plants. Hence, in the present study, the vapor-phase reaction is considered. The FFA raw product stream is eventually isolated from the reactor products through a series of distillation columns. With conventional production of FFA from lignocellulosic biomass, there is some energy used to purify furfural and some energy loss due to condensing the vapor phase during the production of liquid furfural product. Thus, to design a cost-effective FFA production process from raw bio-furfural, both furfural purification and FFA separation processes must be considered as a whole system. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has considered the entire FFA process available. Therefore, we undertook a research endeavor to develop a novel FFA process from raw bio-furfural, which excludes the furfural purification step. With this integration, the vapor product stream from the Biomass pretreatment step can be introduced directly into the Furfural hydrogenation step. Energy saving can be expected because there is no furfural purification step and condensation of the vapor phase. Regarding the furfural process, although the first industrial furfural plant began at the Quaker Oats company in 1921, the furfural production process has not changed substantially over a century [2]. The current furfural process uses inefficient technology with a relatively low molar yield of approximately 50% in the reaction step [2], and separation process requires a large amount of energy to reach the target purity of furfural, primarily owing to the presence of the binary heterogeneous azeotrope furfural–water (64.5 wt% furfural at 97.7 °C at atmospheric pressure [4,5]). Recently, several processes (e.g., Escher Wyss, Rosenlew, Supratherm, Stake, Voest Alpine, SupraYield, and Biofine processes [2]) to increase furfural yield and energy efficiency for the production of furfural have been reported. Notably, De Jong and Marcotullio [6] applied mechanical vapor recompression to maximize the heat recovery of the furfural process, and the patent for the results was under examination at that moment. However, the relatively high temperature (226 °C) of the compressor output stream may cause compressor overheating, which is currently the most serious problem in using compressors in the industry [7]. Nhien et al. [5] reported an advanced biorefinery design for furfural separation, leading to a 10.1% decrease in the total annual cost (TAC). Applying advanced techniques such as heat pumps and dividing wall columns can improve the furfural process efficiency considerably. Additionally, Nhien et al. [4] reported a hybrid extraction and distillation process using butyl chloride as an extracting solvent for furfural production. The results indicated that the hybrid process could reduce the TAC up to 19.2% compared to the distillation process. Owing to a large amount of water in the feed stream, the use of liquid-liquid extraction appears promising from the energy point of view. However, the selection of a suitable solvent is challenging because many factors must be considered such as viscosity, toxicity, cost, selectivity, boiling point temperature, and ease of regeneration. FFA has numerous industrial and consumer uses and is considered as a high volume production chemical by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency; however, only a few studies on the detailed process design of FFA production are found in the literature. The technology of furfural-to-FFA conversion in the vapor phase with a supported Cu catalyst was first patented by DU Pont de Nemours in 1927 [8]. Hoydonckx et al. [3] and Zeitsch [2] subsequently reported the conceptual diagram for FFA production. Recently, Tseng et al. [9] conducted the modeling studies of the FFA purification step from nearly-pure furfural (0.98 mol% furfural – 0.02 mol% water). Applying advanced techniques and designs have rendered petro-refineries to be highly efficient and cost competitive over the past few decades. Meanwhile, only a few reports indicated the highly integrated and advanced designs on biorefinery processes, especially processes using lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock [10–12]. Nhien et al. [10] reported the heat-integrated intensified biorefinery processes for cellulosic ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. Recently, Hong et al. [11] published a novel hybrid-blower and-evaporator-assisted distillation for separation and purification process in biorefineries while Pyrgakis et al. [12] published a process integration approach for the production of various alcohols using gas stripping and adsorption as recovery methods. The main reasons are the complexities of lignocellulose feedstock and that biorefinery technology is only beginning as compared to petro-refinery technology. Thus, more intense studies and advanced designs are required such that biorefineries are more cost competitive with petro-refineries. The traditional commercial FFA production processes encounter several challenges including intensive energy use, low integrated degree, and a lack of detailed design. Detailed process design for producing FFA from lignocellulose directly is non-existent. Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive reaction-distillation (RD) process producing FFA from raw bio-furfural is proposed. The gaseous raw furfural stream from the reaction in the Biomass pretreatment step was introduced directly to a reactor to be converted to FFA by hydrogenation. Then, the FFA conventional process that uses distillation technique in FFA purification part is designed and simulated. Subsequently, a novel hybrid extraction-distillation process using toluene as an extracting solvent is proposed to enhance the developed RD process. Both processes are analyzed, and heat integration is applied to improve the process energy efficiency. All processes were simulated using the commercial simulator Aspen Plus V.9. Accordingly, the promising FFA production process is proposed by evaluating the total energy requirements (TEC), total annual cost (TAC), and total carbon dioxide emissions (TCE)."
1,Methods,
2,Design and simulation,"2.1 Design and simulation In this study, the FFA plant was designed with a capacity of 30 kilotons of FFA per year. The pentosan-rich lignocellulose was first hydrolyzed to pentose, and this pentose was dehydrated to furfural in a furfural reactor. In this study, the feed mixture considered was obtained from the furfural reactor that was a vapor stream containing approximately 6 wt% furfural, 90 wt% water, and various byproducts. In the conventional furfural process, the gaseous raw stream is typically condensed by making a steam utility before being delivered to a series of distillation columns to isolate furfural. However, in the present process, the raw furfural stream was introduced directly to a reactor to be converted to FFA by hydrogenation. Table 1 lists the detailed feed conditions, component compositions, and production specifications [2]. All processes in this study were simulated by Aspen Plus V.9 with the RadFrac model for a rigorous distillation and the RPlug (rigorous plug flow reactor) model for reactions. The non–random two–liquid thermodynamic package was used to calculate the liquid activity coefficients while the Hayden–O’Connell (HOC) equation of state was used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the vapor phase. In particular, the HOC equation can predict reliably those mixtures containing carboxylic acids, which may occur during the solvation of polar compounds and dimerization in the vapor phase [13]. The interaction parameters between furfural and 2-methylfuran (2-MF), FFA and 2-MF, and 2-MF and water, were regressed from the data reported by Holdren, Hixon [14], Tai [15], Smith and Labonte [16], respectively. Meanwhile, other binary parameters were obtained from the vapor–liquid equilibrium Aspen database. To design the reaction and separation sequence, the boiling points and azeotropes are investigated at 1 atm using the Aspen database (Table 2 ). The results indicated that three heterogeneous azeotropes between water–furfural, water–5 M F, and water–FFA were formed, resulting in a more difficult separation step. Nevertheless, the conversion of furfural hydrogenation is more than 99%, resulting in a small amount of furfural delivered to the separation step. Accordingly, these azeotropes formed between furfural and other components is negligible. The major issue of FFA production is the separation of the azeotrope formed between the FFA and water. In this study, this problem was solved by one of two methods: designing the distillation column operating at a vacuum pressure to avoid the azeotrope [17], or using a solvent to extract FFA from the water via an extractor. The RPlug model in Aspen Plus was employed to simulate the FFA reactor. It was assumed that no mixing in the axial direction and perfect mixing in the radial direction for solving the material and energy balance equations. The Ergun equation was used to calculate the pressure decrease in the reactor. Tseng et al. [9] presented the detailed modeling study for a reactor that converts furfural to FFA using copper chromite as a catalyst. The reactor design used in the present work is inspired by their work. Table 3 lists the design parameters of the reactor. The use of copper chromite as a catalyst allows for the furfural conversion to exceed 99% after passing through the reactor [2]. The RadFrac model in Aspen Plus was used to simulate all distillation columns. The maximal flooding at approximately 85% of the load at the flooding point was designed to prevent possible flooding. Preliminary simulations were run to determine the initial structures of the distillation columns. Then all distillation columns were optimized using the optimization procedure presented in our recent work [12]. The objective of the optimization is to find the optimal trade-off between the total operating cost (TOC) and total investment cost (TIC) as follows: (1) T A C = T I C × i ( 1 + i ) n ( 1 + i ) n − 1 + T O C where i is the fractional interest rate per year, and n is the number of years. In all columns, the total number of trays and feed locations were adjusted to minimize the TACs while maintaining the product recoveries and purities. The detailed procedure was reported in a previous study [18]."
3,Reactions and kinetics,"2.2 Reactions and kinetics In this study, FFA was converted from furfural by the hydrogenation of furfural in the vapor phase reaction as follows: (2) Furfural + H2 → Furfuryl alcohol Theoretically, the reaction is reversible; however, the equilibrium constant allows a conversion that is greater than 99% at standard conditions, resulting in numerous kinetic models reported in the literature that approximate the reaction as irreversible [19–21]. Various types of catalysts were proposed for the reaction such as platinum [22], copper silicate [23], sodium silicate [24], and copper chromite [2] catalysts. Among them, copper chromite that offers good yield and high selectivity to FFA is widely used in large plants [2]. Hence, the kinetic data using copper chromite reported by Borts et al. are employed in this study [23]: (3) r F F A = 3.14 x 10 16 exp − 10 , 740 T C f u r f u r a l C H 2 2 In the reported kinetic expression, the temperature is in (K), while the concentrations are in (mol/l). The overall rate unit will be (mol/l.s). The further hydrogenation of FFA produces the undesired byproduct, 2-MF: (4) Furfuryl alcohol + H2 → 2-methyl furan + H2O The kinetics of the conversion of the undesired reaction was obtained from the work of Tseng et al. [9] as follows: (5) r 2 − M F = 1.41 x 10 20 exp − 19 , 000 T C F F A C H 2 All the raw materials used for the furfural production contain methyl pentosan, resulting in a small amount of 5-methyl furfural (5-MF) in the raw furfural product [2]. Contrary to the case of furfural, the hydrogenation of 5-MF produces only the final product dimethyl furan (DMF) [25] as follows: (6) 5-methyl furfural + H2 → 2,5-dimethyl furan + H2O The kinetic rate of 5-MF hydrogenation reported by Sitthisa et al. [26] was employed in this study: (7) r D M F = 8.43 x 10 8 exp − 22.8 T C 5 − M F C H 2 2"
4,Results and discussion,"In the following sections, the conventional processes including reaction-distillation (RD) and reaction-hybrid-extraction-distillation (RH) were designed and optimized in detail. Subsequently, heat integration was applied to improve heat recovery. For a fair comparison, all processes were evaluated in terms of the energy requirements, costs, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Accordingly, the promising design is proposed for the FFA production from raw bio-furfural."
5,Reaction-distillation (RD) process,"3.1 Reaction-distillation (RD) process In the conventional FFA production process, the raw furfural stream (approximately 6 wt% furfural) in the vapor phase from the furfural reactors was first fed into a distillation process to achieve a nearly pure purity of furfural (more than 98 wt%) [2]. Subsequently, the furfural stream must be re-vaporized before being introduced to the FFA reactor, because most industrial FFA plants currently use the vapor-phase hydrogenation reaction. In the present study, the feed was introduced directly into the FFA reactors to maximize heat recovery. The FFA base case presented in Fig. 2 consists of two primary parts: reaction and distillation. First, the feed and hydrogen were mixed in the mixer M1 and sent to the multi-tubular reactor R1. Herein, furfural was converted to FFA via the vapor-phase hydrogenation reaction. The tubes of the reactor were designed to achieve a 99% conversion of furfural. The reactor output was cooled down to 40 °C and was introduced to the separator S1. The cooling temperature of 40 °C was designed to achieve the required recovery of hydrogen of 99.5 wt% while utilizing cooling water at 30 °C with the minimum temperature difference of 10 °C. If using temperature over 40 °C, the flow rate of other components, such as methanol and water, in vapor flow increases. This causes higher compressor duty and higher accumulation of these components in the reactor section. The vapor phase of separator S1 consists of 99.6 wt% hydrogen that is pressurized by a compressor before being recycled to M1. The recycle flow rate of hydrogen was determined based on the desired molar ratio of hydrogen to furfural at the reactor inlet (3.15). In fact, in the simulation flowsheet, there is a small purge stream after the compressor. The purge flow (2 kg/h) is so much smaller than the recycle flow (366 kg/h) that it can be neglected in the steady state overall material balance. Meanwhile, the liquid phase containing FFA and other components were introduced to a distillation process to obtain the desired purities. The first distillation column (C1) operates in a mode that delivers methanol (99.8 wt%) to the overhead while sending the remaining components to the bottom. It is noteworthy that FFA and water formed a heterogeneous azeotrope at the atmospheric pressure, but it is not present at a vacuum pressure [9]; therefore, the second column (C2) was designed with the operating pressure of 0.2 bar to avoid this azeotrope. C2′s function is to achieve an FFA purity of 99 wt% and FFA recovery of 98 wt%, while the rest (water, acetic acid (AA), and 5 M F) are delivered to the C2 top. Several simulations were first run to determine the initial structures of the distillation columns. Next, the total number of trays and feed location were adjusted to minimize the TACs of all columns while maintaining the product purities and recoveries. Through the minimized total annual cost (TAC) that performed the optimal tradeoff between the capital cost and operating cost, the optimal structure design and operating conditions were found. The detailed optimization procedure for all distillation columns was reported in our previous study [18]. Fig. 2 depicts the optimal RD process with the basic parameters, while Table 4 lists the detailed design parameters for all columns. Note that the C2 operates at vacuum pressure so that packing is an ideal solution. For other distillation columns, valve trays are designed to have better turndown properties than sieve trays, and thus, they are more flexible when the feed rate varies. The results indicate that C2 requires a large amount of energy of 83,501 kW, while C1 consumes 7341 kW in the reboiler duty. Low-pressure steam (160 °C, 5 barg) was used for all the reboilers in C1 and C2. Although C2 operates at the vacuum pressure, it still requires much energy in the reboiler duty (83,501 kW) and a large diameter (6.1 m). The economic feasibility of this design will be discussed in detail in the Economic and environmental assessment section."
6,Improvement of conventional processes,"3.2 Improvement of conventional processes 3.2.1 Reaction-hybrid-extraction-distillation (RH) process As mentioned in the Reaction-distillation process section above, the design of the RD process that involves the distillation technique to remove the bulk of water when a heterogeneous azeotrope between water and FFA exists presents several drawbacks. The three major drawbacks are as follows: the distillation column C2 in the RD process as shown in Fig. 2 requires a large diameter; it must operate at a vacuum pressure; it consumes intensive energy in the reboiler duty. From the energy point of view, liquid-liquid extraction appears more promising. Therefore, we develop a novel reaction-hybrid-extraction-distillation (RH) process for the production of FFA. In our previous work [4], we proposed butyl chloride and toluene as the promising solvents for the hybrid extraction-distillation process for the production of furfural. However, butyl chloride belonging to the family of organic halogen compounds has a higher degree of toxicity compared to toluene according to data from Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) managed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine [26,27]. The use of chlorinated solvents is in many industries nowadays not accepted anymore. Toluene has numerous commercial and industrial applications and has been widely used in industries as a solvent in paints, thinners, correction fluid, printing, and leather tanning processes, etc. Therefore, in this study, toluene has been chosen as the extracting solvent for the production of FFA [5,28]. Fig. 3 shows the schematic diagram of the RH process with the primary design parameters. It is noteworthy that the reaction part in the RH process is the same as the reaction part in the RD process. First, the feed and hydrogen were input to the plug flow reactor R1 to produce FFA through the hydrogenation of furfural. The reactor output was subsequently cooled down to 40 °C before being introduced to the separator S1. The vapor stream including hydrogen primarily was recycled to reactor R1 while the liquid stream consisting of FFA, water, and byproducts (5-MF, DMF, methanol, 2-MF, and AA) was delivered to the extractor E1. E1′s function is to generate two liquid phases: the solvent-rich phase including toluene, FFA, and 5-MF at the top, and the aqueous phase including water, methanol, and AA at the bottom. The required recovery of FFA through the extractor is 99 wt%. The solvent-rich stream was subsequently inputted to the distillation column (C11) to isolate toluene at the top before being recycled to the extractor E1. The C11 bottom stream was delivered to the distillation column (C12) to achieve the desired purities of FFA and 5-MF on the C12 top and C12 bottom, respectively. The recycle flow rate of toluene in Fig. 3 was determined based on the required recovery of toluene and FFA in the extractor and distillation column. In particular, the recoveries of toluene through the extractor and the C1 column are 99.8 wt% and 99.9 wt%, respectively. The optimal RH process using toluene as an extracting solvent with stream data is shown in Fig. 3, while the column hydraulics and key design parameters for all columns are listed in Table 4. Both C11 and C12 used the medium pressure steam in the reboilers. The results indicate that the RH process can save up to 92% and 64% energy requirements in the reboiler duties and condenser duties, respectively, compared to the RD process. Furthermore, the RH configuration can also avoid using a vacuum distillation column as in the RD configuration, thus potentially reducing cost significantly. 3.2.2 Heat integration of the reaction-distillation (HiRD) process The RD process has certain heating demands in reboilers and cooling demands in coolers which are provided by external utilities (steam and cooling water). The heat integration techniques which could determine the possibility of integrated heat exchange opportunities can be carried out to maximize the transfer of heat from hot streams to cool streams and to minimize external heating and cooling utilities. Naturally, a distillation column exhibits low thermodynamic efficiency, thus requiring much energy at the high temperatures in the reboiler while releasing a similar amount of energy at a low temperature in the condenser. Thus, a heat pump system that can pump heat from a low-temperature source to a high-temperature source can be considered to enhance the energy efficiency of a distillation column. Plesu et al. [29] reported a simple equation to evaluate the feasibility of the heat pump system as follows: (8) Q W = 1 η = T C T R − T C Q/W<5: the use of a heat pump is not suggested. 5<Q/W<10: more evaluations are required. Q/W >10: strongly recommend using a heat pump where Tc and TR mean the temperatures of the upward vapor entering the condenser and the downward liquid entering the reboiler, respectively; η is the Carnot efficiency; W (kW) and Q (kW) are the work provided and reboiler duty, respectively. There are several useful tools such as pinch analysis and Aspen energy analyzer for systematic heat integration in a complex chemical process. In this study, to improve heat recovery the feasibility of heat pump was first evaluated using the Plesu equation [1]. Accordingly, in the RD process, a heat pump is strongly recommended in the C2 column (Tc =60 °C, TR =61 °C, Q/W = 60), while it is not suggested for the C1 (Tc =65 °C, TR =100 °C, Q/W = 1.8). The reboiler duty in the C2 (83,501 kW) is much larger than that of the C1 (7341 kW), while the bottom temperature in the C2 (61 °C) is much lower than that of the C1 (100 °C). Thus, the reboiler duty of the second column should be focused firstly by receiving heat from the compressor outlet stream and reactor outlet stream. After transferring the heat to the reboiler of the C2, the temperature of the reactor effluent (stream 8) is 99.3 °C, which is lower than that of the bottom of the C1, it cannot transfer the heat to the C1 reboiler. There is another alternative solution that the C1 (instead of C2) can receive energy from the hot reactor effluent and the heat of that stream, first passes through C1 and finally is cascaded to the cold utilities. In this case, the reboiler duty of the C1 could be reduced only 1027 kW due to limitation of minimum temperature approach. Thus, to prevent too complex HEN for easy operation, our idea is to focus on the reboiler duty of the second column. Fig. 4 shows the schematic diagram of the heat integration of the RD process with detailed temperatures of all streams. In particular, the downward liquid entering the C2 reboiler (1) first was heat exchanged to the compressor output 3 from 61 °C to 75 °C. The pressure of the compressor outlet was adjusted to obtain the minimum temperature in the heat exchange of 10 °C. Stream 2 then was heat exchanged with the reactor output 7 in the reboiler before be split to vapor stream 6 and liquid product stream 5 at 95 °C. As shown in Fig. 4, the heat from stream 7 and stream 3 can cover all the energy demands in the C2 reboiler duty. Also, the cooling utility used for the reactor output can reduce from 40,214 kW in the RD process to 16,701 kW in the HiRD process. Table 5 lists the thermal data for the main streams in the HiRD process. Overall, the heat integration of the reaction-distillation (HiRD) process can save up 91% and 61% of the energy requirement in the reboiler duty and condenser duty, respectively, compared to the RD process. 3.2.3 Heat integration of the reaction-hybrid-extraction-and-distillation (HiRH) process In the RH process, the heat source from the reactor output can be utilized to preheat the feed stream of the distillation column C11. In addition, the difference in temperature between the C12 overhead (169 °C) and the C12 bottom (187 °C) is small, and the heat load is high; therefore, C12 is a potential case for applying the heat pump. More specifically, the heat pump is strongly recommended for C12 according to Plesu’s equation [29] (Tc =170 °C, TR =187 °C, Q/W = 10). Table 6 lists the thermal data for the main streams in the HiRH process. Fig. 5 depicts the schematic diagram of the heat integration of the RD process. The results indicate that the heat integration of reaction-hybrid extraction-distillation (HiRH) process can save up to 59% and 8% of the energy requirements in the reboiler duty and condenser duty, respectively, compared to the RH process. Remarkably, the HiRH can reduce significantly the reboiler duty up to 97% compared to the RD process."
7,Economic and environmental assessment,"3.3 Economic and environmental assessment To evaluate the economic feasibility of all process alternatives, the total investment cost (TIC), total operating cost (TOC), and TAC were estimated using correlations from the Turton textbook [30], as described in detail in our previous study [5]. The TIC includes the total cost of the distillation column and auxiliary equipment, i.e., reboiler, condenser, tray stack. The Tray Sizing function in Aspen Plus was used to calculate the column diameters and tray spacing. The Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index considered in this study has a value of 541.7, updated to 2016. A plant lifetime of 10 years was considered for the TAC estimations. In this study, the price of the catalyst in the columns was not accounted for due to lack of accurate price information, and the same amount of catalyst was used in all process alternatives. When comparing design alternatives since the error is consistent in all cases, this accuracy is less important and can be acceptable in the conceptual design stage. Table 7 lists the utility costs for the TOC estimation used in this study. Table 8 lists the key results of all process alternatives including the energy requirements in the reboilers and condensers, TIC, TOC, and TAC. Both the HiRD and HiRH processes included one more heat exchanger and compressor compared to the RD process and RH process, respectively. It is noteworthy that owing to the high expense of a new compressor, the investment cost of the HiRD and HiRH processes are higher than those of the RD and RH processes by 84% and 74%, respectively. However, a tradeoff exists between the investment cost and operating cost, as reflected through the TAC. Consequently, the HiRD process can reduce 82% of the TAC compared to the RD process, and the HiRH process can reduce 92% of the TAC compared to the RH process. Fig. 6 illustrates conveniently the TIC, TOC, and TAC for all processes. Remarkably, the HiRH process can save up to 92% and 34% in terms of the TAC and TIC, respectively compared to the RD process. In this study, two process flowsheets for the production of FFA from lignocellulosic biomass was proposed: the conventional RD process and the RH process. Two processes have the same main product (FFA), but different by-products (methanol in the RD process and 5-MF in RH process) and the RH process requires an additional solvent. In addition, the RH process can produce more FFA than the RD process (72 kg/h). To assure that the fair comparison is done on a common basis of both processes, the additional costs for the extraction solvent, the benefit achieved from selling methanol and 5-MF, and excess FFA were considered. All process alternatives were evaluated further in terms of the relative total annual cost (TAC*), which were estimated as follows: RD process: TACRD* = TACRD - Annualized methanol profit RH process: TACRH* = TACRH – Annualized 5-MF profit + Annualized solvent makeup cost - Annualized excess FFA profit Note that the initial solvent cost was added to total investment cost for the RH process and the heat integration of reaction-hybrid-extraction-distillation (HiRH) process. The prices of methanol [31], toluene [32] were taken from global world market data while assuming 5-MF prices is as same as FFA due to lack of accurate price information [33]. The profit from selling methanol, 5-MF, and excess FFA was assumed to be 50% of the total sales value. Table 9 lists the key results of all process alternatives including the selling profit from methanol, 5-MF, the solvent cost, TAC, and TAC*. Remarkably, the HiRH process can save up to 99% and 95% in terms of the TAC* compared to the RD and HiRD processes, respectively. In addition to economic assessment, the environmental aspect was considered in terms of carbon footprint. The CO2 emissions from the steam reboilers were calculated using Gadalla’s modular method [34]: (9) C O 2 e m i s s = Q f u e l N H V C % 100 α where NHV is the net heating value of fuel, and C% represents the carbon content. As listed in Table 8, the proposed HiRH process can reduce up to 96% of CO2 emissions compared to the RD process."
8,Conclusions,"A novel reaction-hybrid-extraction-distillation process was proposed for enhancing the FFA production process from raw bio-furfural effectively. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first work reporting the large-scale design of FFA production from biomass. First, the conventional RD process including furfural hydrogenation and FFA purification, which excludes the furfural purification step compared to the conventional FFA process was designed and optimized. Subsequently, the novel reaction-hybrid-extraction-distillation process was suggested, designed and optimized for further enhancement. Furthermore, heat integration was evaluated and applied for both RD and RH processes to improve heat recovery and the integrated degree of FFA production from biomass. Consequently, a reduction of 62% and 90% were possible in terms of TIC and TOC, respectively, thus resulting in a reduction of 89% in the TAC. Remarkably, the HiRH process could reduce up to 92% and 96% in terms of TAC and TCE, respectively, compared to the RD process. Besides, because RD and RH processes have different by-products, the TAC* which includes the additional costs for extraction solvent and the selling profit of methanol, 5-MF, and excess FFA were evaluated for a fair comparison on a common basis of both RD and RH processes. The results showed that the HiRH process could save up to 99% and 95% in terms of the TAC* compared to the RD and HiRD processes, respectively. Overall, the lower costs and CO2 emissions demonstrate that the integrated hybrid extraction and distillation process is highly efficient and integrated as compared to the conventional process, proving to be an attractive solution for implementing in industrial FFA process. The proposed hybrid configuration awaits further exploitation in other biorefinery processes."
