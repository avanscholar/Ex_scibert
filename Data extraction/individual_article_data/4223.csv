0,Introduction,"Natural products containing chiral amine motifs have attracted tremendous interest from the organic synthetic community due to their intriguing structural features and diverse biological activities [1]. Accessing these complex and structurally diverse molecules requires efficient methods for installing the chiral amine stereocenters with assembling structural complexity, providing a formidable challenge for the asymmetric installation of chiral amine stereocentres with notable structural complexity, posing a formidable challenge to chemists. Asymmetric catalytic hydrogenations of unsaturated compounds, such as imines and enamines, with transition metal complexes bearing chiral ligands, are the most fundamental means of generating valuable chiral amine moieties in natural products. Two of these transformations, asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) and asymmetric hydrogenation (AH), are quite powerful (Fig. 1 , substituents are omitted for clarity) and can generate the pivotal chiral amine motifs in natural products with good to excellent reactivities and enantioselectivities. ATH, referring to the addition of hydrogen from a non-H2 hydrogen source, is a more convenient and powerful method that is widely applied in total syntheses of natural products. Indeed, the ATH of imines or enamines developed by Noyori has been frequently applied in total syntheses of natural products, but AH is relatively less popular despite its importance as an efficient method to introduce the chirality into molecules. The Noyori-type catalysts (C1a-c) have powerful catalytic properties that are widely used in ATH and AH of imines and enamines. Meanwhile, chiral metal catalysts base on either diphosphine ligands or monophosphorus ligands have been proven to be effective, such as BINAP (L1), XyliPhos (L2), Et-DuPhos (L3), DIPAMP (L4), DIOP (L5), MonoPhos (L6), PHOX (L7) and SiPhos-pe (L8) (Fig. 2 ) [2,3]. This review summarizes the powerful ATH and AH protocols recently applied in total syntheses of natural products that have not been reviewed in the literature yet. Only these key transformations in the synthetic routes will be discussed due to space limitations."
1,Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of imine and enamine,"The Noyori ATH, a highly versatile tool for the stereoselective reduction of enamines but more importantly imines, plays a dominant role in natural product synthesis, as it offers high efficiency and generality. Interestingly, all the Noyori ATHs used to access natural products are catalysed by Ru(II) complexes with chiral diamine ligands, such as N-(2-amino-1,2-diphenylethyl)-4-toluenesulfonylamide. Morphine (9) is an opioid analgesic that naturally occurs in a number of plants and animals. Since its first synthesis in the middle of the 20th century [4], the synthesis of morphine has attracted substantial interest from chemists. In the classical synthetic routes reported by Rice and Beyerman [5], the key intermediate, (–)-dihydrothebainone was obtained by a resolution step that is inherently inefficient (maximum yield 50%). Hence, replacement by an appropriate catalytic asymmetric reaction would be a significant improvement. In 1999, Sheldon and co-workers reported a method utilizing the Noyori ATH reaction to access the enantiomerically pure 1-benzylisoquinolines in remarkably improved yields (Scheme 1 ) [6]. The (S,S)–C1a works particularly well in this strategy, and key intermediate (R)-2 in the Rice route was obtained in 99% ee and 73% isolated yield. Using the same method afforded key intermediate (R)-6 in the Beyerman route in 86% ee but in an unsatisfying isolated yield. Using the Grewe cyclization, functionalized 1-benzylisoquinolines enantiomers 3 or 7 can be transformed into morphinans 4 or 8, respectively, which can be further converted to the final product 9, according to Rice and Beyerman’s synthesis [7]. Emetine was isolated from Radix Ipecacuanha and the roots of Phychotria Ipecacuanha and Cephalis acuminate and possesses multiple properties and activity relevant to the treatment of lymphatic leukaemia [8,9]. Tubulosine, which was isolated from the dried fruits of Alangium lamarckii and the sap of Pogonopus speciosus, has remarkable anticancer activities [10,11]. They have similar structures and four stereogenic centres, making their total syntheses quite challenging. In 2003, Tietze and co-workers developed a stereochemical combinatorial strategy for the synthesis of twelve stereoisomers by using C1a in the key hydrogenation step (Scheme 2 ) [12]. Treatment of imine 10 with the (R,R)-and (S,S)–C1a afforded enantiomers (S)-11 and (R)-11, respectively, which successfully introduced the first stereogenic centre at C-11b. The following three-step sequence was used to construct diastereomers 12a-c and 13a-c, with stereogenic centres at C-2 and C-3. In a similar manner, the Noyori ATH reaction of 12a-c with the (S,S)–C1a led to 14a-c, whereas diastereomers 14d-f were obtained in the presence of the (R,R)-C1a, building the stereogenic centre at C-1″ respectively. Analogously, the stereoisomers 14g-i and the corresponding diastereomers 14j-l were achieved from 13a-c with the (S,S)-and (R,R)-C1a. One year later, starting from the same intermediate 10, Tietze and co-workers accomplished the total synthesis of emetine (14a) and tubulosine (15), employing the Noyori ATH reaction to effectively control the stereochemistry at C-11b and C-1′′ [13]. Laudanosine (22) and xylopinine (23) are benzylisoquinoline alkaloids that are unique among the various classes of natural products [14,15] (Scheme 3 ). The challenge posed by their unique structures is the construction of the C1–C18a bond of the benzylisoquinoline skeleton and the control of the stereogenic centre at C1. In 2005, Doye and co-workers accomplished the total synthesis of these two alkaloids [16]. The C1–C18a bond was formed by a Sonogashira coupling between the alkyne 18 and aryl iodide 17 which was obtained according to Tietze’s procedure from commercially available homoveratrylamine (16), giving the trifluoroacyl-protected alkyne 19 in 84% yield. Liberation of the NH2 group under basic conditions delivered the amino alkyne, which was then subjected to an intramolecular hydroamination reaction to produce imine 20 (88% yield over two steps). Treatment with the (R,R)-C1a enantioselectively reduced imine 20 to secondary amine 21 in 92% yield with 93% ee, establishing the stereogenic centre at C1. (+)-(S)-Laudanosine (22) and (–)-(S)-xylopinine (23) were synthesized from amine 21 via a reductive amination and Pictet-Spengler cyclization, respectively. Natural products containing nitrogen often exhibit potent biological activities, attracting an exceedingly large number of groups to develop new synthetic strategies [15,17]. In 2007, Opatz and co-workers published a short asymmetric approach to the synthesis of norlaudanosine (21), O,O-dimethylcoclaurine (28) and salsolidine (29), three members of 1-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetra-hydrosioquinoline alkaloids, using a Noyori ATH reaction as the key step [18]. As shown in Scheme 4 , 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carbonitrile (25) was readily accessible by the Bischler-Napieralski cyclization of N-formyl homoveratrylamine followed by the addition of HCN. The alkylation of 25 along with spontaneous elimination of HCN yielded dihydroisoquinolines (20, 26 and 27). After failing to reduce the dihydroisoquinolines via Yamada’s and Hajipour’s approaches, they turned to Noyori’s catalysts with formic acid/triethylamine as the hydrogen source. The (–)-norlaudanosine (21) was obtained in 93% ee by employing the (R,R)-C1a. With the (S,S)–C1a, (R)-configured O,O-dimethylcoclaurine (28) and (R)-salsolidine (29) were obtained with 96% and 91% ee, respectively. Higenamine (32), a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid, was isolated as an optically inert racemic mixture from several plant materials, including Aconite root, Asiasaari radix, Annona squamosa, and Gnetum parvifolium, and the (R)-(+)-enantiomer was isolated from the embryo of Nelumbo nucifera [19–22]. Racemic higenamine was reported to possess cardiac β-adrenoceptor stimulating activity, vasodilating and platelet anti-aggregating activities through the α-adreno ceptor, and the ability to inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and NO production in RAW 264.7, vascular smooth muscle and other cells [23–25]. Therefore, studying the biological activities of the individual enantiomers instead of racemates is of great importance from the perspective of new drug development. In 2008, Yun-Choi and co-workers reported the enantiocontrolled syntheses of higenamine using Noyori’s ATH of the corresponding dihydroisoquinoline intermediates 27 as the key step (Scheme 5 ) [26]. Imine 27 was obtained through the coupling of amine 16 with acid 30, followed by a Bischler-Napieralski cyclization. When the (R,R)- and (S,S)–C1a were applied in the Noyori ATH of 27, enantiomers 28S and 28R were obtained, respectively, and they were readily transformed into (S)-higenamine (32S ) and (R)-higenamine (32R ). A subsequent study indicated that the (S)-enantiomer possesses better selectivity and higher inhibitory potency than the (R)-enantiomer for platelet anti-aggregation induced by epinephrine. In the reported synthesis of evodiamine (37), which is the major alkaloid in Evodiae fructus, the chirality of the C3 asymmetric centre was controlled by the chirality of the α-carbon of tryptophan, and the introduction of this chirality was followed by decarboxylation of the amino acid residue. In 2008, Takayama and co-worker reported a concise asymmetric total synthesis of evodiamine (37) utilizing an ATH (Scheme 6 ) [27]. The synthesis started with the condensation of lactam 33 and methyl N-methylanthranilate (34) to generate the known compound rhetsinine (35). When rhetsinine (35) was subjected to the standard ATH conditions, the generation of the imine and the transfer hydrogenation proceeded in one pot, affording (+)-evodiamine (37) with 90% yield and 99% ee. Utilizing an ATH as a key reaction, Santos and co-workers reported the enantioselective total synthesis of (–)-quinolactacin B (44) [28] and (+)-lennoxamine (52) [29]. As shown in Scheme 7 a, quinolactacin B (44), featuring an interesting pyrrolo-quinolone moiety conjugated with a lactam ring, can inhibit tumor necrosis factor production [30,31]. The synthesis of (–)-quinolactacin B (44) started from readily accessible imine (40) derived from tryptamine 38. Then, using the (R,R)-C1a, the Noyori ATH reaction of imine 40 produced the dihydro-β-carboline compound 41 possessing the S absolute configuration in 89% yield and >90% ee. Following installation of a Boc protective group and a methyl group, a Winterfeldt reaction with NaO2 in 18-crown-6-ether transformed the carboline core into pyrrolo-quinolone compound 42. Finally, (S)-(–)-quinolactacin B (44) was obtained through electrochemical α-oxidation of the carbamate in 42, Swern oxidation, and removal of the Boc group [28]. The product displayed an optical rotation that was consistent with that of the natural product. Lennoxamine (51) is an isoindolobenzazepine alkaloid extracted from the Chilean plant Berberis darwinii. It features a distinctive tetracyclic ring framework, making this molecule an attractive and synthetically challenging target. As shown in Scheme 7b, in Santo’s synthesis of lennoxamine (51), intermediate 45 was obtained in three steps from commercially available ethanamine. Then, key lactam intermediate 46 was successfully achieved by the replacement of chloro functionality with a cyano group using NaCN, aqueous NaOH, and coupling under EDC/HOBt conditions. Subsequent coupling of 46 and 47 with NaH in dry DMF gave 48, which was subsequently subjected to a Bischler-Napieralski cyclization, affording imine 49, which contains the tetracyclic skeleton. Then, employing C2 chelated with l-proline-tetrazole, the chiral centre in isoindolobenzazepine 50 was introduced through an asymmetric hydrogen-transfer reaction. Applying the same oxidation strategy used to generate the amide in the synthesis of quinolactacin B, the product (S)-(+)-lennoxamine (51) was obtained [29]. The β-carboline skeleton is widely distributed among natural products, including alkaloids from yohimbine, corynantheidine, Rauwolfia and Vinca. By taking advantage of the Noyori ATH, Philli and co-workers envisaged an efficient, enantiocontrolled syntheses of such alkaloids, namely, trypargine and arborescidines A-C, processing a β-carboline skeleton (Scheme 8 ) [32,33]. (S)-(–)-Trypargine (56) is a β-carboline alkaloid that has been isolated from the skin of the African rhacophorid frog, Kassina senegalensis [34]. Arborescidines A-C (58, 61, 62) are brominated alkaloids of the tetrahydro-β-carboline family isolated from the marine tunicate Pseudodistoma arborescens [35]. Featuring key β-carboline imine intermediates 52–54 with various substituents, Pilli’s synthetic strategy introduced the required asymmetry through a Noyori ATH. Using the (S,S)–C1a, the chiral centres were established with 93%–96% ee. Subsequently, the enantiomer (R)-55, which was obtained from 52, was converted to (+)-trypargine (56) through removal of the alloc group and installation of a guanidine moiety. With the compound 53 as the precursor, tetracyclic enantiomer (R)-57 was generated via a one-pot hydrogen transfer and cyclization process. Reduction of the amide in (R)-57 readily afforded (+)-arborescidine A (58). Additionally, enantiomer (R)-59, with an alkene moiety, was converted to aldehyde 60 after installation of a methoxycarbonyl protecting group and oxidative cleavage. Treatment of aldehyde 60 with aqueous TFA in THF afforded a >20:1 trans:cis mixture, which was reduced by AlH3 to provide (–)-arborescidine C (61). Furthermore, (–)-arborescidine B (62) can be generated from 61 through dehydration with Burgess reagent. (–)-(S)-Stepholidine (69), a potential candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or drug abuse, was extracted from Stephanie intermedi and displayed unique pharmacological effects towards dopamine (DA) receptors [36,37]. Its core structure, which comprises a tetracyclic ring skeleton, an isoquinoline core and a chiral carbon at C14, pose a substantial synthetic challenge. In 2009, Yang and co-workers reported the first enantioselective total synthesis of (–)-(S)-stepholidine (69), employing Noyori’s protocol for the enantioselective reduction of the cyclic imine as the key step [38]. As illustrated in Scheme 9 , the synthesis started from the hydroxymethylation of phenylacetic acid 63, followed by methylation of the phenol, leading to lactone 64. Key intermediate 66, obtained from the aminolysis of lactone 64 and following acetation, was transformed into cyclic imine 67 by the Bischler-Napieralski reaction. Treatment of freshly prepared imine 67 with (R,R)-C1a and formic acid/triethylamine (v/v ​= ​5:2) as the hydrogen source in DMF at 23 ​°C provided tetrahydroisoquinoline 68 in 95.6% ee and 84% yield from imine 67, successfully installing the stereogenic centre at C14. 68 was converted to (–)-(S)-stepholidine (69) in 63% yield with an improved ee value (over 99% ee) via a three-step sequence involving hydrolysis, intramolecular cyclization and deprotection. In 1954, Snyder and co-workers isolated haplophytine (82), a heterodimeric indole alkaloid, from the flower of Haplophyton cimicidum. Structurally, haplophytine (82) features a unique complex polycyclic array of ten rings with six stereocentres [39]. The tetracyclic left-hand fragment (83) has a unique bridged ketone structure, while the right-hand fragment can be seen as a natural Aspidosperma alkaloid called aspidophytine (84). In 2009, Nicolaou and co-workers reported the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-haplophytine (82) using a Noyori ATH reaction as the key step to construct the left-hand fragment [40]. As shown in Scheme 10 , the synthesis commenced with the conversion of commercially available 7-benzyloxyindole 70 to nitroalkene 72. A five-step sequence smoothly formed amide 73, which was then reacted with POCl3/DMPU to give the imine 74. Imine reduction under asymmetric Noyori ATH conditions and subsequent Cbz protection delivered tetrahydro-β-carboline 75 in 35% from amide 73 with an excellent ee (over 95% ee). Then, treatment of a mixture of 75 and diphenol 76 with PIFA in MeCN provided the propellane-like hexacycle 77 in 23% yield. Imine 78 was formed in 35% yield via a four-step transformation including selective phenolic methylation, replacement of the acetate group with a benzyl group, cleavage of the superfluous N,O-acetal and methylation of the resulting phenol. The following synthesis of left-hand substructure 80 continued with ester saponification with LiOH, followed by acid chloride formation and treatment with iPr2NEt, affording hexacyclic bisenamine 79 in 60% yield over three steps. 79 was then subjected to oxidation and rearrangement under mCPBA/NaHCO3 conditions to deliver the indoline intermediate, which was oxidized with DDQ to afford target left-hand substructure 80. With left-hand substructure 80 secured, the synthesis of haplophytine (82) continued with the construction the right-hand fragment with a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a reductive Vilsmeier-Haack reaction, and a radical cyclization as the key steps. Corynantheine alkaloids, which have a tetracyclic indole[2,3-α]quinolizidine motif, are of great significance and interest to both the pharmaceutical and chemical communities due to their impressive biological activities [41–43]. Among these alkaloids, isogeissoschizol (91) is the most studied target in the development of novel synthetic strategies designed for the total synthesis of alkaloids featuring an indole[2,3-α]-quinolizidine framework, such as geissoschizol (95) and dihydrocorynantheol (96). In 2013, Wu and co-workers successfully accomplished the asymmetric synthesis of these indoloquinolizidines using a highly efficient cascade sequence with absolute control of the cis-H2/H12b relative geometry in good to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities [44]. As shown in Scheme 11 , the cascade was triggered by a Noyori ATH reaction of iminodiesters 85 using the (R,R)-C1a as the catalyst, establishing the first chiral quaternary centre at C12b. Subsequent spontaneous lactamization with discrimination between the two diastereotopic 2-alkoxy-2-oxoethyl groups constructed the D ring with high cis-H2/H12b diastereoselectivity. Therefore, iminodiesters 85 was converted to chiral structure 87 in 92% yield and 98% ee. The latter could be converted to tetracyclic lactam 88 in 82% overall yield via a four-step sequence involving protection, saponification, anhydride formation and reduction. The subsequent aldol reaction followed by a dehydration delivered Z-type enone 89 and E-type enone 90 as two separable isomers in an approximate ratio of 3:2, and they could be used separately as starting materials for the syntheses of isogeissoschizol (91), geissoschizol (95) and dihydrocorynantheol (96) via a short series of functional group transformations. Isogeissoschizol (91) was obtained from 89 via amide reduction and removal of the silyl ether and Boc group in 73% yield over three steps. Additionally, the reduction of E-type enone 90 was carried out with AlH3 providing the amine 92, amide 93 and amine 94. For further transformation, 93 could be readily and quantitatively converted to 94 quantitatively. Finally, amines 92 and 94 could then undergo deprotection protocols to deliver geissoschizol (95) and dihydrocorynantheol (96) in overall yields of 87% and 88%, respectively. Tylophorine, a phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid, was first isolated from Tylophoraindica and has been shown to have a wide range of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities [45–47]. Naturally occurring tylophorine is found as a scalemic mixture, with a slight excess of the R -enantiomer 105. In 2015, Yamaoka and co-workers reported the asymmetric total synthesis of (R)-(–)-tylophorine (105), which was began with the preparation of biaryl 101 (Scheme 12 ) [48]. Commercially available 6-bromoveratraldehyde 97 was converted into ketone 99 in 93% over two steps, namely, a Grignard reaction followed by an oxidation of the resulting alcohol. Key intermediate 101 was obtained in 86% yield from the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling between ketone 99 and boronic acid 100. The formal [2 ​+ ​2] cycloaddition of 101 followed by in situ deprotection of the TBS group delivered cyclobutanediol, which then underwent a two-step chemoselective azidation to give the cyclobutanol 102 bearing an azide group. A TfOH-promoted domino ring-contraction/ring-opening sequence of a cyclobutanol 102 furnished cyclic imine 103 with a pendant phenanthrene core. 103 was then subjected to a Noyori ATH to install the stereogenic centre. The use of readily accessible C3 in a mixed solvent of DMSO and CH2Cl2 at −20 ​°C gave the desired product 104 with high enantioselectivity (84% ee). The subsequent Pictet-Spengler reaction provided (R)-(–)-tylophorine (105) in 37% yield from cyclobutanol 102. This is an example of a Noyori ATH of a cyclic imine for the late-stage construction of an asymmetric centre. Isocorydine (110), an aporphine alkaloid Papaveraceae sp., is a potential therapeutic drug for targeting the side population cancer cells of hepatocellular carcinoma [49,50]. Chemically, the key features of the synthetic route to isocorydine are the construction of the tetracyclic core and the stereogenic centre. In 2015, Liu and co-workers reported an asymmetric synthesis of isocorydine in twelve steps with 99% ee [51]. As shown in Scheme 13 , the B ring was first constructed via a Bischler-Napieralski reaction of amide 107, which was obtained from the condensation of acid 106 and 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine (16). The stereogenic centre of isocorydine was created using suitably designed chiral Ru complexes developed by Noyori et al. Imine 108 underwent a Noyori ATH reaction to provide tetrahydroisoquinoline 109 in 80% yield from amide 107 with 99% ee, successfully building the stereogenic centre. N-Methylation of tetrahydroisoquinoline 109 followed by an intramolecular coupling constructed ring C, after which hydrolysis of the protecting benzyl group furnished the target product (S)-isocorydine (110) in 40% yield over three steps. The natural product terengganensine A was isolated in 1997 from the bark of Kopsia terengganensis [52]. It features an unprecedented heptacyclic framework with six stereocentres and an unusual [5.6.6.6]azafenestrane system embedded in a dioxaazaadamantane motif. In 2016, Zhu and co-workers reported the first synthesis of terengganensine A, and they used a seven-step enantioselective synthetic route (Scheme 14 ) [53]. The synthesis began with the cyclization of compound 111 under basic condition to give spirolactam 112. Then, iminium salt 113 was generated via the Bischler-Napieralski reaction of 112. The Noyori ATH of 113, under a slightly modified version of Pihko’s conditions using the (R,R)-C1a, introduced the desired absolute configuration at the C21 position with 70% yield and 90% ee. Then, diastereoselective benzoyloxylation of C3 and an integrated one-potoxidative cleavage of cyclopentene/cyclization/hydrolysis process afforded (–)-terengganensine A (116). Melanthioidine (123) is a dimeric macrocyclic diaryl ether tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid. It was isolated from the leaves and corms of Androcymbium melanthioide, a perennial flowering plant that grows in Southern and Eastern Africa and is extensively used in folk medicine for the treatment of many diseases [54–56]. In 2016, Evano and co-workers reported an asymmetric total synthesis of (–)-melanthioidine [57]. As shown in Scheme 15 , amide 119 was readily prepared by an EDC/HOBt-mediated coupling of homobenzylic amine 117 and acid 118, which were prepared from vanillin and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, respectively. Then, the dihydroisoquinoline imine 120 was obtained through the Bieschler-Napieralski cyclization of imide 119. The subsequent key step is an efficient Noyori ATH enabling access the enantioenriched phenethyltetrahydroisoquinoline monomeric subunit 121 (91% ee). After two-step of basic functional group transformations, a copper-mediated cyclodimerization to form the two diaryl ether linkages with concomitant macrocyclization afforded (–)-melanthioidine (123). A similar example in which C1a was used in the synthesis for later modification is in the total synthesis of dysoxylum alkaloids, which are 1-phenethyl-tetrahydroisoquinolines possessing the (S)-configuration at C-1 (Scheme 16 ). Seven members have been identified to date, namely, (S)-dysoxyline (127), (S)-autumnaline (128), (S)-homolaudanosine (129), (+)-colchiethanamine (130), (+)-colchiethine (131), (–)-isoautumnaline (132) and (S)-(+)-O,O-dimethylautumnaline (133). Last year, Kouznetsov and co-workers reported a five-step biomimetic approach for synthesizing dysoxylum alkaloids, building the stereogenic centre at C-1 via a Noyori ATH [58]. An ATH reaction/reductive amination sequence of model substrate 125 gave the desired alkaloid 126 in 95% yield and 93% ee without any purification after the ATH reaction. The stereochemical model of the Noyori ATH reaction is proposed in Scheme 16. The enantioselectivity in the Noyori ATH reaction originates from the synergy of two processes, the N+-H···OS hydrogen bond and the CH-π interaction between the iminium ion of 125 with the sulfonyl group and the p-cymene of the TsDPEN ligand. Based on this study, six natural dysoxylum alkaloids along with twelve synthetic alkaloids were achieved using a Noyori catalyst in good to excellent yields (86%–95%) and enantioselectivities (86%–97% ee). (S,S)-Tetramethylmagnolamine (140), a biologically active tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) alkaloid, shares defining diaryl ethers, typically linking two electron-rich aromatic rings. The synthetic challenge posed by the unique structure is how to create the benzylicstereocentre and how to efficiently connect the two frameworks. Last year, Lumb and co-workers described a concise synthesis of (S,S)-tetramethylmagnolamine (140) by employing the Noyori ATH reaction for building the stereogenic centre and an aerobic oxidative desymmetrization of phenols to increase the molecular complexity (Scheme 17 ) [59]. The synthesis began with the solvent-free amidation of acid 134 and amine 16 ​at high temperature, leading to amide 135 in 91% yield. The Bischler-Napieralski cyclization of amide 135 followed by a Noyori ATH reaction introduced the benzylic stereocentre in 94% ee and 78% yield over two steps on a multigram scale. Free amine 137 was protected with a Boc group to afford 138 in 89% yield. Subsequent aerobic oxidative desymmetrization of phenol 138, methylation of catechol 139 and reduction of the N-Boc groups under standard conditions furnished (S,S)-tetramethylmagnolamine (140) with a longest linear sequence of seven steps and 21% overall yield. A natural product synthesis involving the ATH of an emaine was reported by Czarnocki [60–63] and Tong [64]. Czarnocki and co-workers have a long-standing interest in applying the Noyori ATH reaction to the total synthesis of natural products, demonstrating that the Noyori ATH reaction is a powerful strategy for reducing imine or iminium salts along with installing stereogenic centre. Crispine A (144), an isoquinoline alkaloid, was isolated from Carduus crispus Linn [65]. In 2005, Czarnocki and co-workers accomplished the first enantioselective synthesis of (+)-crispine A (144), and their synthesis was based on the Noyori ATH of iminium salt 143 or enamine 145 (Scheme 18 a) [62]. Iminium salt 143 was readily prepared by a known procedure from homoveratrylamine (16) and γ-butyrolactone 141, while salt 143 could be converted to enamine 145 under Bremner’s conditions. Treatment with C4 reduced iminium salt 143 to desired (+)-crispine A (144) in 96% yield and 92% ee. An even higher ee was obtained when the enamine 145 was subjected to the same reduction although the yield was slightly lower (90% yield, over 99% ee). In addition, (+)-crispine A (144) was also synthesized via an Ir-catalysed enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic N,N-dialkylenamines reported by Zhou and co-workers (section 3.1). Czarnocki and co-workers reported an elegant enantiomeric synthesis of two compounds closely related to homoprotoberberine and homoaporphine alkaloids. As shown in Scheme 18b, in 2007, they used a similar reaction sequence to accomplish the synthesize (+)-harmicine (150) and (+)-desbromoarborescidine A (151) introducing the chirality by a Noyori ATH reaction in the last stage [61]. Inspired by the positive results in the application of the Noyori ATH reaction in the enantioselective alkaloid synthesis, Czarnocki and co-workers kept going on exploring the use of this method in the preparation of trypargine (56) and crispine E (157), which are two guanidine-derived alkaloids isolated from African rhacophorid frog Kassina senegalensis and Carduus crispus Linn respectively (Scheme 18c) [60]. Imine 152 was formed via a series of transformations from γ-aminobutyric acid and tryptamine. Imine 152 was converted to amine 153 in the presence of C4 with excellent chemical yield and enantioselectivity (92% yield, 98% ee). With enantiopure amine 153 in hand, they completed the synthesis of (–)-trypargine (56), as its hydrochloride salt, in three simple steps, including the removal of the phthaloyl group followed by derivatization with N,N′-bis(Boc)-S-methylisothiourea, removal of the Boc group with TFA, and subsequent exchange of the anion by repeated evaporation with methanolic HCl. A similar reaction sequence led to (+)-crispine E (157) in 27% overall yield with 89% ee. Protoberberine alkaloids, ubiquitous natural products found in plants of annonaceae, papaveraceae, berberidaceae, display a wide range of biological activities [66–70]. Canadine is a typical tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloid featuring a chiral centre at C13a. In 2018, Tong and co-workers reported the asymmetric synthesis of (–)-canadine (163), and the stereogenic centre at C13a was established in the final step via a Noyori ATH [64]. As illustrated in Scheme 19 , they developed two types of substrates: enamine 162 and its oxidized quaternary salt 164, which could deliver target (–)-canadine (163) in high yields with moderate enantioselectivities (77% ee and 78% ee respectively) via the Noyori ATH reactions. Natural berberine 164 was readily obtained from the I2 oxidation of the enamine 162. However, a Noyori ATH failed to provide good enantioselectivity in the synthesis of 13-methylprotoberberine. Under the classic conditions (C5/Et3N/HCOOH), 13-methylberberine (165) (a quaternary ammonium salt) was reduced to cavidine (166) with poor enantioselectivity (20% ee)."
2,Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH),"The catalysts used in AH can be divided into several subgroups based on the ligands, functional groups, central atoms, or mechanistic features. The discussion of their applications in the total synthesis of natural products will be organized according to the type of metal."
3,Ir-catalysed AH,"3.1 Ir-catalysed AH (S)-Calycotomine (170), a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline bearing a 1-hydroxymethyl group, was isolated from Calycotomespinosa Link [71]. Its absolute configuration is unique relative to other 1-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. In 1998, Morimoto and co-workers reported an efficient enantioselective synthesis of (S)-calycotomine (170) using catalytic AH with a catalyst system involving a BINAP-Ir-phthalimide complex as a key step (Scheme 20 ) [72]. The synthesis commenced with the formation of 1-benzyloxymethyl-3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline (168) via a two-step sequence including cyclization and Bischler-Napieralski reaction. The asymmetric hydrogenation of dihydroisoquinoline 168 was carried out in a mixed solvent of MeOH-toluene with 0.5 ​mol% of an (R)-BINAP (L1)–Ir(I) complex in the presence of phthalimide (1 ​mol%) under 100 ​atm of hydrogen, giving desired intermediate 169 in 85% yield and 86% ee. The O-benzyl group of 169 was conveniently removed under Pd(OH)2/H2/EtOH/AcOH conditions to provide (S)-calycotomine (170) in 93% yield. Tetrahydroquinolines, are important organic synthetic intermediates and biologically active compounds, have attracted the interest of numerous chemists for many years. Zhou and co-workers developed a highly enantioselective hydrogenation of quinoline derivatives using an Ir/phosphine/I2 system and applied it to the asymmetric synthesis of four naturally occurring 2-substituted tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids, angustureine (173), galipinine (176), cuspareine (177), and galipeine (178) [73,74]. As shown in Scheme 21 , under the optimized conditions, quinolines 171 and 174 were hydrogenated using the Ir/MeO-Biphep (L9)/I2 catalyst to yield the corresponding tetrahydroquinolines 172 and 175 in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Subsequent N-methylation of 172 using HCHO/NaBH3CN gave target alkaloid (–)-angustureine (173) in 94%. Galipinine (176), cuspareine (177), and galipeine (178) were obtained by the same transformation. (S)-Flumequine (179), an antibacterial agent, could be readily synthesized from 175d according to Egri’s work [75], demonstrating that the AH of quinoline is an efficient way to synthesize natural products. Jorunnamycin A (186) and jorumycin (187), two bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline (bis-THIQ) natural products, have been intensely studied by chemists and biologists due to their intriguing chemical structures and exceptionally potent anticancer activity [76,77]. Jorunnamycin A (186) and jorumycin (187) each possess a pentacyclic carbon skeleton, highly oxygenated ring termini and a central proiminium ion. In 2018, Stoltz and co-workers reported a concise total synthesis of these two bis-THIQ natural products with an Ir-catalysedAH of quinoline as the key step (Scheme 22 ) [78]. They initiated their synthetic work with the palladium-catalysed cross-coupling of isoquinolines 180 and 181, constructing the carbon skeleton of jorumycin. Intermediate 182 was subjected to a three-step sequence to provide bisisoquinoline 183 in 25% yield, which was then used in the key hydrogenation reaction. After a systematic screening of reaction conditions, the AH was successfully carried out under the optimized conditions (Scheme 22, [Ir(cod)Cl]2/TBAI/BTFM-XyliPhos (L12)/H2/PhMe/60 to 80 ​°C). Bis-THIQ 185 was obtained in 83% yield with >20:1 dr and 88% ee. The enantiopure form of 185 could be obtained by crystallization via slow evaporation of an acetonitrile solution (>99% ee). After the reductive cyclization, over five and six steps, including a palladium-catalysed hydroxylation, were required for the complete syntheses of jorunnamycin A (186) and jorumycin (187), respectively. In 2009, Zhou and co-workers reported the first highly enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic N,N-dialkylenamines by using chiral iridium complexes of spirophosphoramidites and applied this strategy to the synthesis of the isoquinoline alkaloid crispine A (144, Scheme 23 ) [79,80]. Tricyclic enamine 145 was readily synthesized by a literature method [61]. Under the optimized conditions, the AH of enamine 145 was performed well by using the catalyst Ir/(S a ,R,R)-SiPhos-pe (L8) to give (+)-crispine A (144) in 97% yield with 90% ee."
4,Ru-catalysed AH,"3.2 Ru-catalysed AH 1-Benzylated tetrahydroisoquinolines are well known as key intermediates in the synthesis of a variety of isoquinolin alkaloids [81]. Before Noyori ATH was introduced in 1986 for the asymmetric synthesis of 1-benzylated tetrahydroisoquinolines, the most elegant route was reported by Meyer [82,83]; the diastereoselective alkylation of 1-lithiated tetrahydroisoquinolines containing an amino acid-derived N-imino function followed by removal of the chiral auxiliary provided tetrahydroisoquinolines with the 1S configuration. In Noyori’s work (Scheme 24 ), starting Z and E enamide substrates 188 were prepared by acylation of 3,4-dihydropapaverine 20 with acyl chlorides and triethylamine [84,85]. Since the Z and E isomers of 188 are interconvertible with irradiation from a tungsten lamp and the Z isomer is easier to obtain by recrystallization, (Z)-188 was selectively prepared as the substrate for AH. Applying hexacoordinate ruthenium complexes (R)-C6 and (S)–C6 bearing a chiral BINAP ligand, (Z)-188a-e were converted to (R)-189a-e and (S)-189a-e, respectively, in >99% ee. This homogeneous catalyst is broadly applicable in the synthesis of various naturally occurring or other physiologically significant products. Specifically, tetrahydropapaverine (190) was obtained by hydrogenation of (Z)-188a using catalyst (R)-C6, followed by deprotecting of the formyl group from the hydrogenated products. In addition, the hydrogenations of (Z)-188a catalysed by (R)-C6 and (S)–C6 offered (R)-189a and (S)-189a, respectively. The subsequent lithium aluminium hydride reductions of (R)-189a and (S)-189a produced (R)-laudanosine 191 and (S)-laudanosine 192 with >99.5% ee. In addition, the (R)-C6-aided hydrogenation of (Z)-188a and subsequent deacetylation/debenzylation gave (R)-laudanosine 193 with 97% ee. Furthermore, the (R)-C6-aided hydrogenation of (Z)-188c orhydrogenation of (Z)-188d with subsequent deacetylation generated (R)-norreticuline (194), which could be a key intermediate in the synthesis of morphine and morphine-based analgesics. Moreover, the catalytic reduction of simple methylene derivative (Z)-188e afforded (S)-salsolidine 195 in 96% ee after deacetylation. Fused N-heterocyclic structures are commonly embedded in large numbers of natural alkaloids and pharmaceutical agents with diverse biological activities. In 2019, Fan and co-workers developed a catalytic system that could be applied to the direct synthesis of benzo-fused quinolizidines and indolizidines via a cascade reaction combining AH of quinolines with intramolecular reductive amination [86]. Furthermore, the utility of this novel efficient synthetic method was demonstrated by the formal synthesis of (+)-gephyrotoxin (204). As shown in the Scheme 25 , the asymmetric cascade reaction of quinoline 202 proceeded smoothly in the presence of C7 on a gram-scale, leading to 202, as the only diastereoisomer observed, in 78% yield with 95% ee. Treatment with LiAlH4 reduced 202 to alcohol 203, which was the key intermediate in the synthesis of (+)-gephyrotoxin (204) according toIto’s study [87]."
5,Rh-catalysed AH,"3.3 Rh-catalysed AH Enantiomerically pure amino acids have not only been isolated from a wide range of natural sources but also served as the versatile intermediates in the synthesis of complex natural products, encouraging chemists’ long-standing interest in developing efficient and convenient methods for preparing these synthetically challenging targets. Numerous studies have shown that Rh complexes are extremely effective catalysts in the enantioselective hydrogenation of dehydroamino acid derivatives, leading to chiral α-amino acid moieties in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Many natural products were synthesized by utilizing the Rh-catalysed AH of β-substituted-α-enmides as the key steps (Table 1 ). Initially, Adamczyk and co-workers reported a notable and efficient enantioselective synthesis of (S)-(–)-acromelobic acid (207) via the AH of dehydroamino acid derivative 205 using (R,R)-[Rh(DIPAMP)(COD)]BF4 as the catalyst followed by removal of the protective groups in >96% ee and good overall yield [88]. Instead of using (R,R)-[Rh(DIPAMP)(COD)]BF4 as the catalyst, (S)-(–)-acromelobinic acid (210) was synthesized via a similar AH protocol with a great ee (96% ee) applying (S,S)-[Rh(Et-DuPhos)(COD)]BF4 as the catalyst [89]. In 2006, Moody and co-workers reported the asymmetric synthesis of stephanotic acid methyl ester using a Rh-catalysed AH to form the sterically hindered chiral β -substituted α -amino acid 212 as the key step [90]. (2S,3R)-211 and (2R,3S)-211 were subjected to AH in MeOH using Burk’s (S,S)-[Rh(Et-DuPhos)(COD)]OTf catalytic system under 90 psi of hydrogen, giving products (2S,3R)-212 and (2R,3S)-212, respectively, in excellent yields and as a single diastereomer. A subsequent four-step sequence afforded the target macrocyclic pentapeptide stephanotic acids 213 and 214. Dysiherbaine (220) and its congener, neodysiherbaine A (217), isolated from the Micronesian sponge Dysideaherbacea, are remarkable excitatory amino acids with potent convulsant activity [91–93]. Chemically, the unprecedented molecular structure consists of a cis-fused hexahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyran ring system bearing a glutamic acid substructure. Sasaki and co-workers reported an elegant synthesis of these two natural products featuring a catalytic AH of an enamide ester as the key step [94,95]. For the synthesis of neodysiherbaine A (217), after screening the asymmetric hydrogenation conditions, the desired compound 216 was obtained in 85% yield with high diastereomeric ratio (>20:1). Final product 217 was achieved through several subsequent steps in enantiomerically pure form. In a similar protocol, amino acid appendage 219, the key intermediate for synthesizing dysiherbaine (220), was obtained in 83% yield, and the other diastereomer was not detected. Cyclopeptide alkaloids are closely related polyamide bases of plant origin that currently include over 200 compounds with a wide range of biological activities. Abyssenine A (223) and mucronine E (226), 15-membered cyclopeptide alkaloids, were isolated from the roots and stem bark of several Zizyphus-type Rhamnaceae and display numerous biological activities [92,96–99]. In 2007, Evano and co-workers reported the first total synthesis of abyssenine A (223), which requires the efficient preparation of highly functionalized, suitably protected, chiral amino acid 222 as the key intermediate [100]. They employed a catalytic AH of (Z)-dehydrophenylalanine derivative 221 to introduce the stereogenic centre, affording chiral amino acid 222 in a good yield and enantioselectivity (89%, 98% ee). Having the amino acid fragment 222 in hand, a byssenine A (223) was obtained by using an intramolecular copper-mediated coupling reaction to construct the 15-membered macrocycle. Encouraged by this work, Evano and co-workers finished the total synthesis of mucronine E (226) via a related strategy [101]. In 2016, Kazmaier and co-workers finished the total synthesis of cyclomarin A, which is a marine cycloheptapeptide with anti-tuberculosis and anti-malaria activities [102]. An AH was one of the key steps in the syntheses of building block 228. α,β-Unsaturated amino acid derivative 227 was subjected to stereoselective hydrogenation using (R)-MonoPhos (L6) as a ligand, providing chiral amino acid 228 in high yield and selectivity (86% yield, 98% ee). In 1998, Bulk and co-workers developed an efficient AH of conjugated α,γ-dienamide esters using the Et-DuPhos (L3)-Rh catalyst system. A formal synthesis of (+)-bulgecinine (232) was carried out to demonstrate these efficient methods [103]. Treatment of 230 with (R,R)-[Rh(Et-DuPhos)]OTf in MeOH under an atmosphere of hydrogen gave 231 in 99% yield and 99.3% ee, and this was the key intermediate in Oppolzer’s (+)-bulgecinine synthesis. Meanwhile, Gallagher [104] and Fukuyama [105] used the Rh-catalysed AH of β-substituted-α-enmides 233 and 236 to achieve the formal syntheses of (–)-aphanorphine (235) and (+)-manzamine A (238), respectively."
6,Conclusion,"This review summarizes the application of novel and impressive asymmetric catalytic hydrogenations of imine and enamine substrates with chiral transition-metal complexes bearing chiral ligands in natural product syntheses. The variety and efficiency of these strategies demonstrate that this type of transformation can be highly practical for producing versatile chiral amine architectures that enable efficient access to various types of natural products. Furthermore, the incorporation of the asymmetric hydrogenation of imines or enamines into cascade reactions is a particularly powerful synthetic approach for rapidly generating molecular complexity, as well as constructing privileged scaffolds with multiple stereocentres, which are difficult to achieve by other common methods. These advantages make this asymmetric hydrogenation protocol an attractive choice for chemists when designing syntheses. Undoubtedly, the development of elegant asymmetric hydrogenation reactions and more efficient catalysts and ligands will greatly facilitate the total syntheses of natural products bearing chiral amine structures."
