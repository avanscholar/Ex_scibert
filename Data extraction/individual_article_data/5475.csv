0,Introduction,"Significant progress has been made over the past decade in biocatalytic reduction reactions [1,2]. One of these important reactions is the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of activated CC bonds, which is catalysed by ene-reductases (ERs) from the Old Yellow Enzyme family (OYE, EC 1.6.99.1). ERs are highly chemo-, regio- and stereoselective due to precise positioning of the substrate via hydrogen bonds and van-der-Waals interactions, allowing an overall trans addition of a hydride and a proton, employing NAD(P)H as hydride source via a flavin cofactor [3–6]. Asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is one of the most widely used industrial reactions, which is still dominated by transition metal catalysis [7]. Access to both stereoisomers with chemical catalysis is achieved using the mirror image of the ligand. This is in stark contrast to enzyme catalysis, where access to both stereoisomers is a major challenge in catalyst development. Although wild types (wt) of recombinant ERs have been intensively studied and include some impressive examples of large-scale syntheses [8–13], the core problem of controlling the facial selectivity of the reduction remains. Excellent stereoselectivities for both isomers are only accessible for a handful of substrates [8,14,15], as almost all wild-type ERs show the same stereopreference [16]. Alternatively, substrate-based stereocontrol, starting from either the E- or Z-alkene, may give access to both stereoisomers [17]. While protein engineering of ERs has created pairs of stereocomplementary variants for specific compounds [18–23], little is known about their synthetic usefulness, i.e. if they are generally stereocomplementary, about their substrate scope, solvent and thermal stability, or productivity in large scale reactions. We have previously described stereocomplementary pairs of engineered variants for three compounds from the thermostable ER of Thermus scotoductus SA-01 (TsER/TsOYE). Opposite stereoselectivity, or facial selection, was achieved during the reduction of 3-methylcyclohexenone and methyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-acrylate with TsER variant C25D/I67T and (S)-carvone with TsER variant C25G/I67T [24]. Here we expand on these variants and present a small panel of engineered TsERs, with convenient catalytic characteristics for organic synthesis. This not only includes high activity and stereoselectivity, but also easy production, handling and storage of the catalyst as well as a simple but flexible reaction procedure. Benchmarking tests reveal that this panel combines a broad substrate scope, tolerance to organic solvents and high temperature with convenient catalyst handling. We demonstrate that this combination of properties enables convenient gram-scale synthesis with excellent yields for poorly water-soluble compounds. Importantly, exceptional control over facial selectivity was achieved for half of the substrates."

Compounds 11a, 17a, 18a, 21a - 23a, 27 and 28 have been synthesized according to the literature, with details given in SI."
2,TsER variant creation and biocatalysts production,"2.1 TsER variant creation and biocatalysts production TsER variants were created using the megaprimer PCR method as reported before [24] using either TsER_C25D (5′-GTCCCCCATGGACCAGTACTCC-3′) or TsER_C25G (5′-GTCCCCCATGGGTCAGTACTCC-3′) as forward primers and TsER_I67T (5′- CATAAGGGCTGGTACGACCCAAAG-3′) TsER_I67V (5′-CATAAGGGCTCACACGACCCAAAG-3′) TsER_I67C (5′-CATAAGGGCTGCAACGACCCAAAG-3′) as reverse primers. Heterologous expression and purification by heat treatment was performed as previously reported [24]. Briefly TsER variants were heterologous expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)ΔnemA [25] using pET22b(+) based gene constructs. After heat purification, TsER variants were incubated with an excess of FMN for 90 min in the dark at 22 °C, prior to dialysis against 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Purity of proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1) and enzymes were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until further use. The amount of ER were determined after dissolving the lyophilized powder before a reaction absorption at 455 nm using the reported extinction coefficient of YqjM (ε = 11 600 M−1 cm−1) [26]. For BsGDH, the gene construct pACYC-gdh (Bacillus subtilis 168 glucose dehydrogenase variant E170K/Q252L) [27] was transformed into E. coli BL21-Gold DE3. Expression was performed using TB medium containing 35 mg L−1 chloramphenicol in baffled flasks at 37 °C (200 rpm) until the OD600 reached 0.4−0.6 IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the temperature was reduced to 30 °C. The cultures were incubated overnight, harvested (4480 xg, 4 °C, 15 min) and resuspended in KPi buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice (5 × 30 s, 30 s intervals, 5 × 10 cycles, 40 % power, Bandelin Sonoplus HD 2070 with a SGH 213G booster horn and a titanium flat tip (TT13)) and the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation (29 819 xg, 4 °C, 45 min). The cleared lysate was purified by incubation at 60 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation (29 819 xg, 4 °C, 45 min) the supernatant was lyophilised and stored at −20 °C. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-60) was obtained from Evocatal."
3,"Protein crystallization, X-ray structure determination and docking analysis","2.2 Protein crystallization, X-ray structure determination and docking analysis Heat purified TsER C25D/I67T was concentrated through ultrafiltration (30 kDa NMWL, Amicon) with additional FMN added to ensure full occupancy. The protein was further purified using size exclusion chromatography [Sephacryl S100HR (GE Healthcare)] and eluted in 10 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mM NaCl. Crystals of TsER C25D/I67T were grown using sitting-drop vapour-diffusion in 1 μL drops consisting of equal volumes of 8 mg mL−1 TsER C25D/I67T and crystallization solution (15 % v/v 2-propanol, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate pH 5.0, 10 % w/v polyethylene glycol 10,000) at 289 K. Crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 30 % glycerol prior to cryocooling. X-ray diffraction data were collected at Diamond (UK) on beamline i03. Data was processed using MOSFLM [28] and POINTLESS, with intensities scaled and merged using SCALA [29]. Molecular replacement was performed using Phaser [30] with TsER wt (PDB 3HF3) as search model. Refinement was performed through iterative cycles of manual model building in COOT [31] and restrained refinement using Refmac [32]. The structure was validated using programs within the CCP4 suite [33] and coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession code 5NUX (Table S1). The crystal structures of TsER (wt) in complex with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PDB: 3HGJ) [34] was used in conjunction with the TsER C25D/I67T variant for docking analysis. The protein was prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard from Maestro, version 11.0, Schrödinger LLC. For all calculations the dimer structure was retained. Protonation states for titratable amino acids were assigned based on the most favourable interactions with neighbouring residues and the PROPKA program. The His172 and His175 residues were protonated at both epsilon and delta nitrogen atoms, to enable hydrogen bond formation to the substrate. All water molecules and co-crystallized ligands were removed, with the exception of the oxidized FMN cofactors. The oxidized FMN cofactor was converted to the reduced FMNH2 using Antechamber. Substrate 1a was built in Maestro and prepared for docking using the LigPrep program, version 4.0, Schrödinger LLC and docked into the active site of reduced TsER wt and C25D/I67T using the Glide docking protocol for Rigid body docking (RGB) with Standard Precision settings or using the Induced fit docking (IFD) protocol within the Schrödinger suite."
4,Biotransformations: screening scale,"2.3 Biotransformations: screening scale All reactants were mixed in 1.5 mL reaction tubes containing (final concentrations) 100 mM glucose, 10 μM enzyme, 0.1 mM CoCl2, 0.25 mM NADP+, GDH-60 (2.2 U mL−1) and 10 mM substrate (from 1 M stock in EtOH). The reactions were performed at least in triplicates in total reaction volume of 200 μL at 30 °C and 700 rpm in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf). To stop the reaction, the aqueous solution was extracted with 200 μL ethyl acetate. Conversion and enantiomeric excess was determined by GC or HPLC. Peaks were assigned based on available authentic standards, by mass analysis or full characterisation. Precise ee determination for low conversion levels was performed as previously described [24]. The optical rotation of 2-methylcyclopentan-1-one (13b) was determined to assign chirality. All reactants were mixed in a 50 mL reaction containing 45 mL KPi buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), glucose (87.5 mM), NADP+ (0.25 mM), BsGDH (2.2 U mL−1) and TsER C25G/I69T (20 μM). Reaction started upon addition of 50 mM 2-methylcyclopenten-1-one (13a) with 5 mL n-pentane and was performed at 30 °C and 200 rpm. After completion the whole reaction mixture was extracted with n-pentane and the solvent was carefully evaporated under vacuum. The optical rotation was measured with a 20 mg mL−1 solution in chloroform in a 50 mm cuvette with a polarimeter P800-T, KRÜSS with λ =589 nm at 25 °C and result in [∝]D 25 -81° indicating that 2R-methylcyclopentanone is formed according to Shimoda et al. [35]."
5,Biotransformations: 20–500 mL scale,"2.4 Biotransformations: 20–500 mL scale 3-Methyl-cyclohexanone (1b): All reactants were mixed in a 100 mL Schott bottle (50 mL reaction volume) with 45 mL KPi buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) containing glucose (100 mM), NADP+ (0.25 mM), BsGDH (2.2 U mL−1), 0.1 mM CoCl2, TsER variant (10 μM), 3-methylcyclohexenone (1a, 50 mM) and 10 % (v/v) n-pentane. The reaction was performed at 30 °C and shaking (150 rpm). To monitor conversion, 20 μL samples were taken from the n-pentane phase and diluted with 200 μL n-pentane for analysing via GC. Upon complete conversion, the whole reaction mixture was extracted three times with 20 mL DEE. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was carefully evaporated under vacuum. Compound S-1b was further purified using flash column chromatography (n-pentane/EtOAc 25:1). (R)-Levodione (8b): All reactants were mixed in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask (20 mL reaction volume) containing KPi buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4): glucose (500 mM), NADP+ (0.41 mM), BsGDH (2.2 U mL−1), TsER C25D/I67T (10 μM), ketoisophorone (8a, 125 mM) and 10 % (v/v) diisopropylether (DIPE). The reaction was performed at 30 °C and shaking (150 rpm). 100 μL samples were taken and extracted with 100 μL EtOAc for analysing via GC. After completion (91 % conversion) the whole reaction mixture was extracted twice with 20 mL EtOAc. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. 2-Methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one (9b): All reactants were mixed in a 300 mL Erlenmeyer flask (100 mL reaction volume) containing KPi buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), glucose (82.8 mM), NADP+ (2 mM), GDH-60 (2.2 U mL−1), TsER variant (3.4 μM), carvone (9a, 69 mM). The reaction was performed at 30 °C with shaking (110 rpm). 100 μL samples were taken and extracted with 200 μL EtOAc for analysing via GC. After completion the whole reaction mixture was extracted twice with 100 mL EtOAc. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. 2-Methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one (9b): All reactants were mixed in a 500 mL Schott bottle (500 mL reaction volume) with 450 mL KPi buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) containing glucose (100 mM), NADP+ (0.25 mM), BsGDH (2.2 U mL−1), 0.1 mM CoCl2, TsER variant (5 μM), 9a (51.2 mM) and 10 % (v/v) n-pentane. The reaction was performed at 30 °C with shaking 150 rpm. 20 μL samples were taken from the n-pentane phase and diluted with 200 μL n-pentane for analysing via GC. After completion the whole reaction mixture was extracted three times with 100 mL DEE. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. Ethyl 2-benzyl-3-oxobutanoate (21b): All reactants were mixed in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask (20 mL reaction volume) in KPi buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4): glucose (500 mM), NADP+ (0.41 mM), GDH-60 (2.2 U mL−1), TsER C25D/I67T (10 μM), ethyl (Z)-2-benzylidene-3-oxobutanoate (21a, 50 mM) in 10 % (v/v) diisopropylether (DIPE). The reaction was performed at 30 °C and 100 rpm. 200 μL samples were taken and extracted with 200 μL EtOAc for analysing via GC. After completion (81 % conversion) the whole reaction mixture was extracted twice with 20 mL EtOAc. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The product was cleaned via column chromatography (n-pentane/EtOAc 10:1)."
6,Sequential biphasic batch reaction,"2.5 Sequential biphasic batch reaction All reactants were mixed in a 50 mL reaction tube with 45 mL KPi buffer (200 mM, pH 7.4) containing NADP+ (0.27 mM), C25D/I67T (10 μM), glucose (100 mM) and BsGDH (2.2 U mL−1). 5 mL n-pentane was added containing 0.5 M 8a, to yield a final concentration of 50 mM 8a within the biphasic system (50 mL). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C and 110 rpm. The reaction was monitored by GC. When the reaction completed or stopped, phases were separated by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 15 °C) and a fresh amount of glucose and organic solvent containing 8a was added."
7,Results and discussion,"All enzyme variants reported in this study are easily separated from E. coli host proteins by heat treatment for 90 min at 70 °C [24,36]. Enzyme preparations were reconstituted with FMN followed by dialysis, yielding approximately 110−130 mg purified enzyme per litre of E. coli culture. We found that shock-frozen catalyst solutions maintained their activity when stored at −20 °C for over a year, with only repetitive thawing and freezing having negative effects. To overcome this limitation, we produced freeze-dried powders, which offer advantages upon storage and handling."
8,Substrate scope,"3.1 Substrate scope To expand on our earlier work uncovering the stereocomplementarity of variants C25D_I67T and C25G of TsER [24], we decided to further explore the active site architecture by modifying residue I67. A panel of TsER variants was created by mutating I67 to either a Val, Thr or Cys into variants C25D and C25G. The engineered TsER variants and the wild-type enzyme (wt) were tested against a total of 38 electron-poor alkenes, which included 3-methylcylcohexenone (1a), (S)-carvone (9a) and methyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-acrylate (17a) previously reported on [24]. This benchmarking set of substrates contained cyclohexenones and cyclopentenones, α,β-unsaturated linear alkenones and alkenals, acrylesters, nitroalkenes, a maleimide, citronellylnitrile, two alkynals and an alkynone (Schemes 1 and S1). A total number of 23 compounds were reduced at the CC bond (Scheme 1), introducing new stereocenters with high stereoselectivity (Table 1 ). Access to both stereoisomers was observed for 11 substrates (1a-4a, 6-7a, 9a, 14-15a, 17a, 22a) with stereoselectivities ranging from 17 to >99 % ee. This represents a broad control over the facial selectivity for a single set of ER variants. In eight additional cases (8a, 10-13a, 18-19a, 21a) high chiral purity (88 to >99 % ee) for one stereoisomer was obtained. Comparable conversions were observed with the wt as previously reported [2], but the differences in reaction conditions lead to a 40 % increase in citral reduction. Also, the use of 10 % v/v organic solvents suppressed background racemisation of stereocenters, especially for 13b. The stereochemical outcome of 13a reduction using TsER, previously reported to be S [15,36,37], was unambiguously corrected to be R by optical rotation. In addition, excellent conversions up to >99 % were achieved under screening conditions (Table 1). Originally, these mutations were evolved for cyclohexanone derivatives [24,38], therefore it is particularly interesting that structures such as 17-19a as well as derivatives of cinnamic acid (20-23a) are accepted with excellent conversions. These compounds are valuable building blocks of industrial synthons, fragrance and flavour substances. Besides typical ER substrates, several new compounds for ERs were tested of which three were transformed (4b, 16b, 21b). We noted that kinetic resolution of 4a occurred and produced a compound with >99:1 dr. C25D based variants consume the opposite enantiomer of 4a than C25G based variants. Nevertheless, due to the C2-symmetry of 4b, the same meso isomer is formed (Scheme S2). Reduction of compound 16a creates two new stereocenters with >99:1 dr."
9,Structural characterization,"3.2 Structural characterization One of the most promising stereocomplementary variants (C25D/I67T) was selected for structural investigation. No significant differences could be observed in the main chain conformation in the active site as compared with the wt structure (Fig. S2). The side chain of D25 adopts a conformation that is rotated away from the oxidized FMN and increases marginally the active site volume together with the I67T replacement. Numerous attempts however to co-crystallize C25D/I67T with different substrates to evaluate binding orientations were unsuccessful. We therefore turned to in silico experiments and analysed the interactions for 1a with the wt and C25D/I67T variant using both rigid body docking (RBD) and induced-fit docking (IFD). 1a was selected as it not only showed a reversal of facial selection, but also a dramatic increase in activity [24]. The structures were prepared with a reduced FMN cofactor to mimic the active state and the potential substrate anchors (H172 and H175) were fully protonated, to enable hydrogen bonding. Fig. 1 shows an overlay of the best RBD and IFD pose for the wt (A) and C25D/I67T (B). Binding poses were considered as productive when the hydride transfer angle ranges from 80 to 120° and the distance (H to Cβ) shorter than 4.85 Å [19,39]. The hydride attack angles and distances improve in both cases with IFD. Now, productive poses in the wt unambiguously predict the experimentally observed S-selectivity (76 % ee) and R-selectivity (93 % ee) for the C25D/I67T variant, due to a “flipped” binding mode (Tables S2 and S3). The improved predictions from IFD originate from a side chain flip of residue 67 and rearrangements of side chains Y27, H172 and Y177. The imidazole ring of H172 rotates by 90° in the wt, an effect that was also observed in crystallo for OYE1-W116I upon substrate binding [40]. Notably, in C25D/I67T, the phenolic proton of Y177 changes position in the IFD structure, adopting the correct orientation for proton transfer, as shown in the work of Lonsdale et al. [41] and the hydride attack angle has improved from 81.4° to 93.8°. We predict that the more hydrophobic pocket created in the C25G based mutants, allows sufficient space and van-der Waals interactions to host smaller substituents on the Cβ, allowing “normal” binding poses to occur, to give the experimentally determined S-selectivity."
10,Physicochemical characterization,"3.3 Physicochemical characterization Encouraged by our initial screening, we investigated the physicochemical limits of our reaction system. The reaction system consists of two enzymes, the ER and a NADPH recycling enzyme (glucose dehydrogenase, GDH) supplying the consumed hydride from glucose. First, we investigated the effect of pH on our reaction system (Fig. 2 ). C25D/I67T is less affected by a change in pH and still shows 8b-production at pH 10. Remarkably, it is still 40 % active at a pH of 5, especially considering that NADPH/NADP+ rapidly degrades below pH 7 [42]. The glucose based NADPH recycling irreversibly produces gluconic acid as side product, leading to acidification of the reaction [43]. Our 100 mM buffer capacity is ten-times higher than the amount of possible acid equivalents under screening conditions, and ensures a constant pH, even when considering uncoupling through side reactions. We found that up to 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer can be used, especially when aiming for higher substrate loadings (>100 mM, vide infra). An alternative would be process engineering to compensate for the pH decrease. Enzymes with high thermal stability are of particular interest to biotechnology as increased stability and life-times enables more flexibility in process design. Before studying the impact of temperature on our reaction system, we assessed both the ERs and GDHs individually. The commercially available recycling system (GDH-60, Evocatal) was found to be active up to 50 °C (Table S6). Thus, we switched to an engineered GDH from Bacillus subtilis (BsGDH E170 K/Q252 L) [27,44], which still shows 60 % specific activity at 70 °C under our reaction conditions. Thermal inactivation of variant C25G/I67T and C25D/I67T was assessed by incubating purified enzymes in buffer at temperatures between 4 and 70 °C for 14.5 h prior to a reaction at 30 °C (Fig. 3 A). Both TsER variants retain full activity up to an incubation temperature of 60 °C. At 70 °C incubation, C25D/I67T lost 3 % and C25G/I67T 14 % of its initial activity. This thermal stability is comparable to that of the wt [45]. Notable is the activity increase of C25G/I67T after pre-incubation at room temperature (22 °C) and above, while the activation effect might be masked for C25D/I67T, since full conversion was reached. After ensuring thermal stability of both enzymes, the reaction system was tested for levodione (8b) production at reaction temperatures between 30 °C and 75 °C. Formation of 8b completes in 150 min under screening conditions. Increasing the temperature accelerated the reaction, now reaching full conversion in less than 20 min (C25D/I67T) or 40 min (C25G/I67T) at 55 °C (Fig. 3C,D). Productivity was not affected up to 65 °C, while both variants start losing activity above 65 °C. In general, working above 75 °C reduced the lifetime of the reaction system below 20 min. Not only the enzymes, but also the nicotinamide cofactor (NADPH/NADP+) is labile at higher temperatures. The half-life of dissolved NADPH at 70 °C and above is less than 10 min [46]. Therefore, it is impossible to distinguish between cofactor or enzyme degradation as source for lost activity at high temperatures. Consequently, as long as thermolabile cofactors are used, increased reaction temperatures may negatively impact yields for reaction times longer than a few hours, despite the benefits of increased reaction rate and enhanced solubility of organic molecules at higher temperatures. R-levodione racemizes in buffered aqueous solution approximately 3 % ee per hour at ambient temperatures [47,48]. We expected the effect to be more dominant at increased temperature and found that incubation of R-8b at 65 °C and above for 1 h results in a loss of enantiopurity yielding an ee of 8 %. This temperature accelerated racemization is observed when levodione is incubated in buffer, in the presence of the recycling system or in presence of a TsER variant. When all components of the reaction system are present, R-8b is produced at 70 °C with an ee of 37 % (Fig. 3B). Thus, an increased reaction temperature seems only beneficial for non-racemizable or achiral compounds, but the panel is robust enough to tolerate exposure to elevated temperatures."
11,Organic solvent tolerance,"3.4 Organic solvent tolerance We also investigated the effect of organic solvents as a process parameter on the bioreduction. Low water-solubility of most ER substrates represent a considerable challenge, often resulting in low substrate loadings and significant amounts of waste water [1]. Addition of organic co-solvents and use of biphasic reaction systems therefore offer significant advantages, often increasing the biocatalyst performance in synthetic chemistry. We found that water-miscible solvents are tolerated up to 10 % (v/v) without loss of productivity (Fig. 4 A,B). Polar solvents like C1 to C3 alcohols, DMSO or acetonitrile, common co-solvents in biotransformation, reduce productivity at 20 % v/v and above. Other ERs have likewise shown a similar intolerance against such co-solvents [11,49,50], but no clear trend is apparent. In contrast, water-immiscible solvents are tolerated without loss of productivity up to a phase ratio of 1:4 (20 % v/v of total reaction volume). In general, a small volumetric amount of organic solvents (5–10 % v/v) already increased 21b productivity up to 2-fold, enabling full conversion of this poorly water-soluble substrate. Addition of n-pentane, MTBE, diisopropylether (DIPE) or toluene proved to be particularly effective. Due to the low water miscibility of n-pentane (39 mg L−1), the enzymes stayed active in all tested phase ratios (max. 2:3 n-pentane: buffer) and recovery of a clean product by simple phase separation was possible. Our findings that immiscible solvents are more compatible and enhance conversion are in-line with observations made for other wild-type ERs [49–51]."
12,Preparative scale reactions,"3.5 Preparative scale reactions To ultimately prove the high potential of the panel, we performed bioreductions at a preparative scale of between 20–500 mL with selected variants for compounds 1a, 8a, 9a and 21a at 30 °C (Table 1). Scale-up successfully reproduced conversion and selectivity values observed during screening experiments. We were also able to reduce the amount of glucose from a 10-fold excess to 1.75 molar equivalents. To minimize side reactions, we also limited the available O2 by reactor design (closed bottles with varying head space). The use of a bi-phasic reaction system increased the enantiopurity of 8b. The beneficial effect of a biphasic system on enantiopurity has been previously described for compounds prone to racemization, such as 13b and 8b [47,52]. Excellent yields of up to 93 % were achieved, demonstrating that our reaction system is easily scaled to gram quantities. Substrate loadings up to 125 mM (19 g L−1) are demonstrated. Catalyst loadings were 100-fold reduced from 0.1 mol%, used during screening and our previous reports on TsER [24], to 0.02−0.008 mol% resulting in excellent TONs (3,900 to 20,294) with turnover frequencies (TOF) between 1,986 and 40,634 h−1. All reactions were complete in less than 9 h, whereas other preparative scale bioreductions with ERs are reported to run between 20−96 h [9–11] or at 10–40 times higher catalyst loadings [53]. A 500 mL scale bioreduction of 9a resulted in an isolated yield of 93 % of 2R,5S-9b (3.63 g). Overall, these examples demonstrate the efficiency of our TsER variant panel for organic synthesis with space time yields (STYs) ranging between 0.5–8.3 g L−1 h−1 (Table 2 )."
13,Sequential biphasic batch reaction,"3.6 Sequential biphasic batch reaction As biphasic systems enables enzyme reusability, we performed consecutive batch experiments in which the organic phase containing the substrate (0.5 M 8b in 5 mL n-pentane) was repeatedly replaced after each transformation. This allowed consecutive substrate loadings of 50 mM 8b to the biphasic system (50 mL) while leaving the enzyme and recycling system in the aqueous phase (45 mL). We achieved four cycles (Fig. 5 ), with the first two cycles at 90 min each, cycle 3 at 180 min and the final cycle at 205 min. Relative to the aqueous phase, ca. 27 g L−1 8b were produced before the reactions stopped, with a TTN of more than 17 500. We identified the build-up of stoichiometric amounts of gluconate and a pH drop to 5.2 as cause, also for the reduced productivity over the later batch cycles."
14,Conclusions,"We present here a robust panel of TsER variants for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of a wide range of substrates. The increased substrate scope, broad stereocomplementarity and high enantioselectivities of the panel complements the already established reactions with wild type TsER [24,36,45]. Our reaction system, consisting of two engineered enzymes, is convenient to prepare and handle and also allows for long term storage as freeze-dried powders. TOF of up to 40,000 h−1, which are comparable to hydrogenation rates by heterogeneous and homogeneous transition metal catalysts were demonstrated at preparative scale. The observed tolerance to organic solvents not only allows working at high substrate loadings, particularly for poorly water-soluble substrates, but also simplifies product recovery and decreases racemization. Non-miscible solvents also allows for sequential batch reactions, whereby product can be removed and the reaction repeated using the same enzymes. The high activity, robustness and stereocomplementarity demonstrated by the TsER variant collection, provides a base to further exploit these enzymes as a tool in preparative organic synthesis, especially for cascade and chemo-enzymatic one-pot reactions [54,55]. Moreover, the use of variants of the same ER would reduce efforts during reaction optimization."
