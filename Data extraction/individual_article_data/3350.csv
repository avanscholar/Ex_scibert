0,Introduction,"Photocatalysts could convert solar energy into chemical energy by producing hydrogen gas from hydrogen-containing compounds. Thus, hydrogen production by use of semiconductor photocatalysts has recently received much attention with this view. Since visible light accounts for the largest portion (ca. 46%) of the solar spectrum, visible light-driven photocatalysts that could produce hydrogen from water splitting or aqueous electrolyte solutions under solar light have been actively sought [1–5]. Among them, composite systems made of more than two semiconductor components considered a promising method to develop a high efficiency photocatalyst working under visible light because they can compensate for the disadvantages of the individual component, and induce a synergistic effect, such as an efficient charge separation and improvement of photostability [6,7]. The CdS is a fascinating material having an ideal band gap energy and band positions for hydrogen production from water under visible light [8]. But, CdS is very unstable against photocorrosion in aqueous solutions under irradiation unless the solutions contain sacrificial agents, such as S2− and/or SO3 2− [9,10]. These sacrificial agents scavenge holes in the valence band of CdS before they attack CdS itself. In spite of this limitation, CdS possesses higher activity for hydrogen production than that of oxide materials in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light. To overcome this stability problem and improve the photoactivity, CdS has been combined with electron transfer medium, such as ZnO, TiO2 and LaMnO3 or intercalated into the layered compound [11–14]. These materials effectively accept electrons photogenerated from the conduction band of CdS to their own conduction band and improve the charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a new composite system, we already reported CdS(bulk)/TiO2 nano-bulk composite photocatalysis [15]. This configuration of the composite photocatalyst exhibited a very high rate of hydrogen production under visible light (λ ≥420nm) from aqueous solution containing sulfide and sulfite as hole scavengers. In this paper, we investigated the correlation between the photocatalytic activity and preparation conditions of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of bulk CdS photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of bulk CdS photocatalysts The CdS photocatalysts were prepared by a precipitation method. A stoichiometric amount of Na2S aqueous solution was mixed drop-by-drop with Cd(NO3)2 dissolved in isopropyl alcohol. Precipitated powder was filtered and dried. The dried powder was calcined at 873–1073K for 1–3h under He flow (40cc/min, 29.78μmols−1) to increase the crystallinity of CdS. As a reference material, we used a commercial CdS powder (Aldrich)."
3,Preparation of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts To fabricate CdS/TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalysts, bulky CdS calcined at 1073K for 1h under He flow was stirred in isopropyl alcohol and TTiP (tetra-titanium isopropoxide) (in a mole ratio of CdS to TiO2 from 1 to 0–4) and H2O was added drop-by-drop. The prepared composite powder was filtered and dried again. The dried powder was calcined at 573–773K for 1–3h under air flow to increase the crystallinity of TiO2 in CdS–TiO2 composite photocatalysts."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystalline phases of the products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 200mA. The optical property was analyzed by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV 2401). The morphology of photocatalysts was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4200) and transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010F, field emission electron microscope) operated at 200kV. The BET surface area was evaluated by N2 adsorption in a constant volume adsorption apparatus (Micrometrics, ASAP 2012). The chemical states of sulfur in the samples were determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (XPS VG Scientific, ESCALAB 220iXL) using Mg Kα radiation (1253.6eV). The binding energy calibration was performed using C1s peak in the background as the reference energy (284.6eV)."
5,Photocatalytic reaction procedures,"2.4 Photocatalytic reaction procedures The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at room temperature under normal pressure in a closed circulation system using a Hg-arc lamp (350W) equipped with UV cut off filter (λ ≥420nm). The H2 evolution was determined in an aqueous solution (100ml) containing 0.1g catalyst and 0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3. The evolved amounts of H2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (TCD, molecular sieve 5-Å column and Ar carrier). Pt metal-loaded catalysts were prepared by in situ photodeposition method: composite photocatalyst was added in aqueous methanol solution containing a required amount (0.25–2.0wt%) of H2PtCl6 and filtered and then dried in a static oven. Other metal cocatalysts (Pd, Rh and Ru) were also loaded by the photodeposition method to obtain 0.75wt% loading with aqueous solution of PdCl2, RhCl3·xH2O and RuCl3·xH2O."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Optimization of bulk CdS photocatalysts,"3.1 Optimization of bulk CdS photocatalysts We first optimized preparation of CdS alone in order to prepare efficient CdS(bulk)/TiO2 NBC composite photocatalysts. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of CdS samples prepared at various temperatures. As described, CdS sol was prepared by a precipitation method in isopropyl alcohol. The material was heated at 673–1073K for 1h under He flow in order to increase the crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystallinity of prepared CdS was enhanced according to increase of heat treatment temperature and CdS samples heated above 873K showed a well-developed hexagonal phase. The high temperature annealing induces the formation of the hexagonal wurtzite phase (Fig. 1), which is known to be the more active phase than the low-temperature, cubic zinc blende phase [16]. In addition, heat treatment could heal surface defects in the crystallites, which are responsible for the energy-wasteful photoelectron–hole recombination. The XRD pattern of the sample prepared at 873K shows two small peaks of CdSO4 due to the partial oxidation of surface (Fig. 1(d)). This impurity phase can induce a low photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. The morphology of CdS particles after heating at the high temperatures was observed by TEM (Fig. 1) and SEM (Fig. 2 ). The morphology of the untreated sample was agglomerates of nanosized particles with no distinctive morphological feature. Upon annealing at high temperatures, TEM and SEM images showed particle sizes of ca. 1–2μm. Fig. 3 shows the UV-diffuse reflection (UV-DR) spectra of CdS samples annealed at various temperatures. The shape and position of absorption edges did not vary much. But, as the annealing temperature increased, the absorption intensity was reduced. All the absorption edges were very sharp except the untreated CdS, which seemed to reflect the poor crystallinity of the sample. The absorption edge also showed a slight red-shift with increase in treatment temperature. This appears to be due the “quantum size effect” of CdS nanoparticle formed at low temperatures. Shown in Fig. 4 are the correlation curves for evolution rates of H2, the specific BET surface area, and particle size of CdS photocatalysts with annealing temperatures. The average rate of hydrogen evolution of CdS having high crystallinity (hexagonal wurtzite phase) as a result of heat treatment at the high temperatures was faster than those of cubic zinc blende phases that were not annealed or annealed at lower temperatures. This again seemed to be the effect of CdS crystallinity as previously reported [16]. Thus, there exists a critical annealing temperature (973K in the present case), at which abrupt changes are observed in the H2 evolution rates of H2, the specific BET surface area and the particle size of photocatalysts. These changes are accompanied by the change in the crystal structure of CdS from the cubic zinc blende phase to the hexagonal wurtzite phase. In addition, the high crystallinity of CdS will reduce surface defects in the crystals, which play a role of recombination center of photogenerated electron and hole. Indeed, it was reported that hexagonal wurtzite phase showed the higher oxidation activity of aqueous electrolyte solution containing S2− or SO3 2− than that of cubic zinc blende CdS [17]. There was an apparent induction period of 1–2h before the steady state hydrogen evolution rate was established. This result is in agreement with that of a previous work of Serpone and Borgarello [18]. The surface sulfur species of CdS was analyzed by XPS to investigate the oxidation state on surface of CdS (not shown here). The S2p peaks indicated that CdS-1073K contained a small peak at ca. 169eV attributed to SO4 2− as an impurity [16,19]. Generally, CdS can be oxidized to CdO and CdSO4 forming impurity phases and both of them are not active phases for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Thus, CdO cannot produce H2 because its position of the conduction band is more positive than the redox potential of H+/H2 [20]. CdSO4 is also known to decrease visible light absorption of CdS [21]. This surface oxidation may be responsible for the induction period."
8,Optimization of CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalysts,"3.2 Optimization of CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalysts In our previous work [15], it was reported that CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst showed a high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from electrolyte solution containing sulfide and sulfite as sacrificial reagents under visible right irradiation (λ ≥420nm). Its activity was much higher than that of single CdS photocatalyst having a high crystallinity, and those of composite photocatalysts of different configurations, i.e. nano-CdS/bulk-TiO2 or nano-TiO2/bulk-CdS. The superior activity of the composite photocatalyst is considered to be due to a fast charge separation. Thus, difference in the positions of conduction bands drives photoelectrons generated in bulky CdS upon initial light absorption to surrounding TiO2 nanoparticles as shown in a schematic model (Fig. 5 ) [22]. In order for this system to function efficiently, highly crystalline CdS phase appears necessary. To investigate the optimum molar concentration of TiO2 in CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst for hydrogen production, we changed the molar ratio of TiO2 to CdS. Fig. 6(A) shows XRD patterns of the samples prepared with different molar concentrations of TiO2 in CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts. When the mole ratio of TiO2 to CdS increased, TiO2 anatase phase became clearer. The pure CdS showed well-developed hexagonal phase, whereas the TiO2 phase was anatase both in single and composite photocatalysts. The morphology of CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalysts was observed by TEM as shown in Fig. 6(B). In CdS(bulk)/TiO2, CdS particles of ca. 1–2μm was decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles of ca. 10–20nm. This clearly defined geometry of nanoparticles in contact with a large bulk particle is schematically shown in Fig. 6(C). Note that TiO2 particles would form random multiple particle layers on bulk CdS surface as discussed below. The UV-diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra for these catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The bulky CdS photocatalyst showed a sharp edge at 570nm, while TiO2 showed an edge at 390nm. The spectra of all CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts showed a combination of these two spectra, although the addition of TiO2 led to a blue-shift of the absorption edge of CdS to 550nm in composite photocatalysts. This is in agreement with the previous report by Kisch et al. that the band gap of CdS employed in composite photocatalysts is shifted by an electronic semiconductor-support interaction (SEMSI) [23,24]. Fig. 8 shows the effect of the mole ratio of [TiO2]/[TiO2]+[CdS] for hydrogen production from an aqueous solution containing 0.1M Na2S and 0.02M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm). The optimum molar concentration of TiO2 in CdS(bulk)/TiO2 that showed the highest activity for H2 evolution was determined to be 0.67 as shown in Fig. 8. Thus, an optimum content of nanosized TiO2 particles decorating bulky CdS exists that induces the highest rate of hydrogen production under visible light (λ ≥420nm) irradiation from water containing sulfide and sulfite ions as hole scavengers. Thus, the coverage of TiO2 nanoparticles decorating bulky CdS is needed for effective and fast charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and to increase the photocatalytic activity. But too high a coverage would shade CdS surface responsible for the visible light absorption. This optimum content is rather high at [TiO2]/[TiO2]+[CdS] mole ratio of 0.67. This corresponds to more than 10 times as much as the amount needed to cover 2μm CdS particles with a complete monolayer of 20nm TiO2 particles. This indicates that TiO2 nanoparticles tend to be deposited forming random multilayers over bulky CdS rather than the layer-by-layer deposition."
9,Effect of calcination of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts,"3.3 Effect of calcination of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized in this work by the sol–gel method are in contact with the surface of bulky CdS. The effect of heat treatment of CdS alone has been discussed in Section 3.1. In order to investigate the effect of heat treatment of TiO2 in these composite photocatalysts, we varied the calcination temperature of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst in air flow. Fig. 9 shows XRD patterns of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 powders calcined at various temperatures to increase the crystallinity of TiO2 nanoparticles in CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite. The samples calcined at RT and 573K did not show the main peak of the anatase TiO2 phase. But, the XRD patterns of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite calcined at 673–873K showed the anatase TiO2 phase. When calcination temperature was increased from 673 to 773K, (100) peak of anatase phase became clearer, indicating that TiO2 nanoparticles calcined at higher temperatures had better crystallinity. Fig. 10 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 samples calcined at RT∼773K for 1h. Overall, CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composites showed the same UV-DR spectra that showed characteristics of both CdS and TiO2(bulk) just like a physical mixture of two compounds. As the calcination temperature increased, the absorption edge at the lower wavelength due to TiO2 showed a systematic red-shift, indicating the growth of TiO2 crystals with calcination temperatures. Fig. 11 shows TEM images of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 samples calcined at 573–773K for 1h. The morphology of TiO2 in the CdS(bulk)/TiO2 sample calcined at 573K seemed to be an amorphous phase. The particle shape of TiO2 decorating bulky CdS became clearer forming ca. 20nm particles at increased calcination temperatures. This result is consistent with that of XRD pattern. Fig. 12 shows dependence of the evolution rate of H2, the specific BET surface area and the particle size of photocatalysts on the calcination temperature. At three different calcination temperatures, there was a large variation in specific BET surface area and particle size of TiO2 by XRD data and TEM images. Yet, the variation in the rate of H2 evolution was very small (<10%). The variation is much smaller than that observed for different mole ratios of CdS nanoparticle to bulky TiO2 shown in Fig. 8 (ca. 6-fold variation) and for different annealing temperatures of CdS (ca. 10-fold variation). In CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalysts, CdS is the component that absorbs visible light and generates photoelectrons and holes. Annealing of CdS particle could heal surface defects in the crystallites, which are responsible for the energy-wasteful photoelectron–hole recombination and increase its photocatalytic activity. In contrast, TiO2 in CdS/TiO2 composite photocatalyst is supposed to play a role of electron transfer medium rather than generation of photoelectrons and holes. Still, the crystallinity and morphology of TiO2 particles on CdS(bulk) may affect the process of electron injection from CdS to TiO2, and electron migration in TiO2. The observed insignificant effect of TiO2 annealing suggests that these rates in TiO2 are less important for the overall rates of the photocatalytic reaction relative to rates of steps occurring in CdS."
10,Effect of novel metal loading on CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst,"3.4 Effect of novel metal loading on CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst Hydrogen production depended on the nature of noble metals loaded on the composite photocatalyst. Sathish et al. [25] reported that there is a direct correlation between the rate of hydrogen evolution and properties of such metals, i.e. redox potential, work function and metal–hydrogen bond strength. Thus, Pt metal with higher redox potential, work function and lower metal hydrogen bond strength was found to be favorable for hydrogen evolution activity. Fig. 13 shows the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production according to the nature of noble metals loaded on CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite. The amount of hydrogen gas evolved under visible light irradiation increased in the following sequence for noble metals loaded on CdS(bulk)/TiO2 samples: Pt (640μmol/h for H2)>Rh (459μmol/h for H2)>Pd (408μmol/h for H2)>Ru (261μmol/h for H2). There exists significant difference for hydrogen production among different cocatalysts. Platinum was the best cocatalyst among them to produce hydrogen over CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst. Yet, the correlation of the photocatalytic activity with redox potential of the cocatalysts was not obvious as shown in Fig. 13. We investigated the dependence of the photocatalytic activity on the amount of Pt loading on CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite. As shown in Fig. 14 , the photocatalytic activity increased with the amount of Pt metal up to 0.75wt% and then decreased gradually with further increase of the amount of Pt loading, showing a maximum activity at 0.75wt%. Thus, it was necessary to have an optimum level of Pt loading on CdS(bulk)/TiO2 for efficient hydrogen production."
11,Conclusions,"From the results of optimization of composite photocatalysts, it can be concluded that the crystallinity of CdS is more important than that of TiO2 and that the formation of CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst is more effective strategy than single CdS photocatalyst to acquire an active photocatalyst. The optimum molar concentration of TiO2 in CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst that showed the highest activity for H2 evolution was determined to be 0.67. The photocatalytic activity increased with the amount of Pt metal cocatalyst showing the maximum activity at 0.75wt% and decreased gradually with further increase of the amount of Pt loaded. There exists a significant difference in hydrogen production activity among different cocatalysts (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru)."
