0,Introduction,"There is a great incentive to develop H2 fueled PEM fuel cells to power the automobile replacing the internal combustion engine and its use of liquid petroleum fuel. A fuel cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity thereby eliminating the mechanical process steps that limit thermodynamic efficiency. It can be two to three times as efficient as the internal combustion engine with little or no emission of primary pollutants (CO, HC and NO x ) or greenhouse gas CO2. It operates at 80°C allowing for fast start up and a high energy density. This would truly be revolutionary from an environmental and geopolitical point of view. One can envision your local service station dispensing H2 produced by natural gas (for which the infrastructure exists) reforming on-site to vehicles with the capability of on-board storage. The automobile companies originally investigated on-board reforming of gasoline but have decided to use on-board storage of hydrogen. Hydrogen can also be produced on-site using electrolysis of water. Alternatively it can be provided from a central location and delivered as a liquid. The “Hydrogen Highways” in the US and Japan are under construction and will consist of all three methods of generating the hydrogen for the service stations. The most ambitious fuel cell vehicle programs are being conducted by Toyota and Honda. A number of demonstration vehicles are in the field but under carefully controlled test conditions. There are significant challenges in fuel cell life and system costs. The cost can be greatly impacted if more efficient use of precious metals in the electrodes can be demonstrated. Each automobile company has their own projections for commercialization but on the average 2015 appears to be a reasonable target date. In the meantime stationary 1kWe fuel cell applications fueled first by natural gas, and in the future LPG and kerosene, delivering both electricity and hot water (combined heat and power) for the home will likely to be commercialized in the next few years (2007–2008), especially in Japan. There are many challenges before commercialization occurs, including increasing the life of the fuel cell stack (40,000–80,000 operational hours) and significant reductions in costs. The distributed power model allows on-site power generation especially for facilities not currently served by the grid. Applications such as back up power for cellular phone towers, hospitals, schools, businesses, etc. are under serious consideration. There is also a program by Honda and Plug Power for a home refueling system that provides heat and power while in the evening generating high-pressure hydrogen to refuel your vehicle. Portable methanol fuel cells hold promise to replace batteries in applications such as portable computers, battery chargers, personal digital assistants, etc. The methanol is either directly fed to the fuel cell (DMFC) or first reformed to H2 and CO2 [1]. Low temperature alkaline electrolyte fuel cells [2] continue to be used for space applications but are not feasible for terrestrial use due to the neutralization of the solid acid electrolyte by the CO2 present in the air. Molten carbonate [3] and solid oxide fuel [4] cell systems operate above 700°C and are mainly designed for large energy production above about 200kWe. Phosphoric acid fuels have been in commercial use for over 20 years but are not expected to have a major role as new and less expensive fuel cells systems emerge over the next few years [5]. This paper presents the basic principles of operation of the PEM fuel cell and natural gas reforming catalysts to make fuel cell quality hydrogen."
1,General principles of the PEM fuel cell,"One of the beauties of the fuel cell is its ease of operation. Hydrogen gas is electrocatalytically oxidized to hydrogen ions at the anode composed of Pt deposited on a conductive carbon. The cell operates at approximately 70–80°C. The protons pass through an electrolyte membrane of an acidified fluoropolymer [6]. The cathode is Pt on carbon in which O2 from air is electrocatalytically reduced which combines with the protons producing H2O and heat. The open circuit voltage or theoretical maximum voltage is E o = 1.16V. (1) H2−2e→2H+ (2) 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 O (3) H 2 + 1 2 O 2 → H 2 O The electrons flow through the external circuit and do work. The heart of the fuel cell is the membrane electrode assembly or MEA shown in Fig. 1 . The MEA is a fluropolymer film containing sulfonic acid groups C F 2 ( C F 2 ) 8 ( CFC F 2 ) O ( C F 2 CF ) n S O 3 − H + that provide proton transfer and separation of the H2 and O2. The membrane must be humidified to provide the media for proton conduction. Both the anode and cathode are composed of Pt dispersed on conductive carbons that make contact with the electrolytic membrane by a liquid polymer ionomer (similar in composition to the membrane) with the Pt-containing electrocatalysts [7]. H2 and O2 are delivered to the assembly through electrically conductive gas impermeable bi-polar plates. The gases are dispersed through the anode and cathode respectively through gas diffusion layers composed of a porous carbon fabric. The five-layer sandwich is hot pressed making a single cell. The MEAs are stacked in series with H2 on one side of the bi-polar plate and O2 on the other to increase the voltage output (see Fig. 1). The flow of H2 and O2 through their respective electrodes of the MEA establishes the thermodynamic potential or open circuit voltage. Once current is allowed to flow through an external circuit generating power (current × voltage) the voltage decreases with the resistances associated with the work being performed. Resistances are associated with the diffusion of the gases to the surface of the electrodes, the electro-kinetics of the H2 oxidation and O2 reduction and the flow of protons through the membrane to the cathode where they combine with the products of the cathode reaction producing water. Fig. 2 shows the voltage–current profile. As a small amount of current is drawn the reaction rate and voltage decreases sharply due to the slow electrode kinetics primarily due to the sluggishness of the O2 reduction at the cathode. As more current is drawn the transport of protons through the membrane becomes rate limiting and the voltage experiences a gradual decrease. At high current outputs the reaction becomes limited by gas transport to the electrode surface (at the cathode the O2 must diffuse through the layer of H2O produced) and the voltage falls more rapidly. During the process of increasing current the power reaches a maximum at the point of the onset of where gas diffusion becomes limiting. Those familiar with heterogeneous catalysis will see the analogy with rate limiting steps of chemical kinetic control at the surface of the catalyst, pore diffusion and finally bulk mass transfer. The fuel cell output and life depends on a number of factors. One of great importance is the quality of the H2. It must be virtually free of major poisons such as sulfur and carbon monoxide both of which can be present when the source of H2 is a hydrocarbon reformer. A second issue is the life of the membrane that is damaged by the formation of peroxide intermediates at the cathode and anode. It is speculated that small amounts of O2 from the cathode side of the MEA permeate through the membrane and convert to peroxides at the potential of the anode where they attack the membrane. A third issue is corrosion of the carbon at the cathode. The cost of the precious metals dominates the economics of the system. Research is focused on all of these issues. Of particular concern is the high loading of the precious metals, especially on the cathode which requires the higher loading due to the slow kinetics of the electrochemical reduction. The total Pt target for vehicular applications is a total of 0.1–0.15mg/cm2. Current Pt contents are about four to five times the target. Promoters such as Ru are used to improve the tolerance to CO poisoning [7] at the anode and alloys of Pt with base metals also hold hope for cost reduction for the cathode."
2,Hydrogen generation,"One major issue is the source of H2 for the anode. Ideally it would come from electrolysis of water using electricity generated from natural sources such solar, wind, geothermal, etc. Unlike electricity H2 can be conveniently stored until needed. Since these technologies are still being developed a transitional fuel that can efficiently be converted to H2 is needed. Natural gas is such a fuel since it is H2 rich and for which an infrastructure exists in residences and commercial buildings. One can envision your local service station generating hydrogen for refueling vehicles and natural gas reformed in your home to power your fuel cell. Natural gas pipelines are well established in many parts of the world. Other fuels such as liquid petroleum gas, kerosene and jet fuel may also be important for the future but for now natural gas is believed to be the primary fuel of choice. Producing H2 from natural gas is currently practiced in the chemical industry [8] for production of ammonia and alcohol under steady-state conditions with carefully controlled catalytic unit operations. The right side of Fig. 3 presents the simplified unit operations for the traditional process for H2 generation. Hydrocarbon fuel such as natural gas must first be desulfurized to protect downstream catalysts and process equipment. The ppm levels of sulfur are added to natural gas as an odorant for safety detection. The organo-sulfur species are converted to H2S at pressures exceeding about 500psig and temperatures higher than 350°C by catalytic (Co, Mo on Al2O3 particulates) hydrodesulfurization (HDS). Obviously this step is not required for methanol but would be necessary for any sulfur-containing petroleum-based fuels. The H2S produced is removed by a particulate bed of ZnO. The next step is nickel (Ni) catalyzed steam reforming which is highly endothermic and requires high energy input (inlet temperatures exceed 800°C) depending on the fuel. The exit from the secondary reformer contains about 10–14% CO (dry gas) which is fed to a high temperature water gas shift (WGS) reactor typically an Fe, Cr particulate catalyst at about 350°C. This further increases the H2 content and decreases the CO to about 2% as governed by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the exothermic reaction. The product gas is fed to a low temperature Cu, ZnO, Al2O3 particulate WGS catalyst at about 200°C. The CO is decreased to less than about 0.5%. The remaining CO, which poisons downstream ammonia or methanol synthesis catalysts, is removed by pressure swing adsorption. Weight, size, toxicity, sensitivity of the catalysts to air [8], pressure drop, and the need for transient operations are not critical for H2 plants but are important for residential fuel cell systems. Therefore, this technology will have to be modified significantly to meet the demands of the fuel cell which will include daily start and stop operation. This will entail new catalysts and process conditions along with considerable catalytic engineering. Particulate catalysts used in traditional plants have large volumes creating high-pressure drop. Pipeline natural gas is delivered to the home or building close to atmospheric pressure and therefore the reformer is limited to low-pressure operation in the absence of a cost prohibitive compressor. The Al2O3 catalyst supports have heat high capacities and therefore are slow to transient operation necessary for varying power demands. Particulates are also subject to severe breakage or attrition especially during frequent start and stop operations leading to high-pressure drop and possible contamination downstream. Some of the catalyst materials such as Ni, Cr, Co used in traditional plants are considered toxic and therefore should not be part of an environmentally green technology such as the fuel cell. Nickel-containing reforming and Cu-containing shift catalysts when in their active form (i.e. reduced) will spontaneously react with the O2 in air generating a large and dangerous exotherm creating a major safety concern for consumer applications. The steam reforming process is heat transfer limited complicating the engineering necessary to provide heat for smaller fuel processes. Finally both desulfurization and pressure swing adsorption require pressures not available from existing natural gas infrastructures for residential and commercial applications. For all of the above reasons it is clear that it is necessary to develop new catalytic technology and new engineering concepts for hydrogen generators for fuel cells."
3,First generation fuel processing technologies,"Sulfur removal from natural gas for fuel processors/fuel cells is accomplished using inorganic adsorbents such as metal promoted zeolites or alumina that operate at room temperature and atmospheric pressure but with scheduled maintenance for replacement. Dispersed Ru on high surface area carriers is the prime metal of choice to replace Ni for steam reforming. The heat is provided either through a burner or by catalytically oxidizing the unreacted hydrogen exiting from the anode (anode tail gas burner) which is a precious metal on a ceramic monolith. In a few cases companies are using autothermal reforming where air and water are used to process the natural gas. A sub-stoichiometric amount of air is catalytically oxidized to produce the heat necessary to drive the endothermic steam reforming reaction. Ceramic monoliths are typically used as support structures. The use of metal supports to enhance heat transfer is being proposed [10]. Replacements for the commercially available Cu, Zn, Al (LTS) water gas shift catalysts that are not self-heating but equally active is proving to be very challenging. Materials with less sensitivity to air have been developed but they are subject to the same problems as particulate catalysts mentioned above [9]. If these materials are to be used added safety and start/stop modes of operation will be required that will not likely be acceptable for future units. The development of a precious metal particulate and/or monolith LTS catalysts [10,11] has been very challenging. Too date they have been found to be active above about 300°C but not in the LTS region of about 200°C where thermodynamics favors the lowest CO levels (<0.5%). As HTS catalysts (above 300°C) they may be acceptable but the precious metal content must be competitive for economic viability. The anode electro-kinetics are greatly hindered by traces (>10ppm) of CO present from the hydrocarbon steam reforming and water gas shift processes [7]. For this reason a more CO tolerant Pt/Ru anode was developed but still the CO must be decreased to less than 10ppm. For large-scale production of H2 for the ammonia industry pressure swing adsorption is used to reduce the CO content of the H2. This technology is not practical for fuel cell applications because of excessive size and cost related to compressors. Catalytic methanation is not an acceptable choice because of the highly exothermic hydrogenation of the CO2 present. The method of choice is to inject small amounts of air and perform preferential oxidation of the CO to CO2 via a selective catalyst called PROX [12]. Ideally the catalyst must selectively oxidize about 0.5% (5000ppm) CO to less than 10ppm without oxidizing appreciable amounts of the 40–70% H2 (dry gas) present. Large amounts of water and carbon dioxide from the upstream hydrocarbon reforming reactions are also present and can inhibit the catalyst performance. Both particulate and monolithic catalysts are being used. Ruthenium is widely used due to its lower cost but Pt-containing PROX catalysts are also broadly used especially as monoliths [13]."
4,Conclusions,"Fuel cells and hydrocarbon fuel processing will require many new catalyst technologies. The fuel cell vehicle will represent a major step towards decreasing dependence on foreign oil, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and eliminating the need for after treatment in vehicles. This is a worthy and necessary goal to insure the future of clean and plentiful energy. Stationary applications are a milestone along the route to this goal. There are many challenges ahead but the reward of clean energy from abundant hydrogen is an attractive alternative to liquid fuels. Hydrocarbon reforming represents a transitional technology for hydrogen generation while the sun and wind promise the ultimate achievement of clean and abundant sources of hydrogen energy. Catalysis is at the heart of both the fuel cell and the reformer. Advances in electrode kinetics and reformer catalysts using environmentally friendly and safe materials are in high demand."
