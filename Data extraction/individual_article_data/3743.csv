0,Introduction,"As one of the most significant biomass-derived platform compounds, furfural (FFA) is a highly useful chemical intermediate [1]. As exhibited in Scheme 1 , there are numerous of chemicals with high added value could be produced via hydrogenation of FFA, e.g., furfuryl alcohol (FOL), 2-methylfuran (2-MF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) and pentanediols (POLs). Furfuryl alcohol (FOL) is one of the most importa 9.0 nt hydrogenated products of FFA as well as an important chemical with widely application in the manufacture of foundry resins with excellent chemical, thermal and mechanical properties [2]. Conversion from FFA into FOL is a typical process of CO bond (in aldehyde group) hydrogenation and has been widely investigated over various non-noble Cu-based catalysts such as Cu/Cr2O3, Cu/SiO2 and Cu/ZnO [2–4]. As reported before, the hydrogenation of FFA was usually conducted in its gaseous phase (>160 °C) to obtain a better yield of the product [2,5,6]. However, harsh conditions (e.g. high temperature, H2 pressure and space velocity) would easily result in blocking in the fixed-bed reactors due to thermal sensitivity of FFA and FOL. Therefore, development of catalyst which was still active under milder conditions should be significant to improve sustainability of FOL production. As demonstrated in our previous work, the Al absent Cu/ZnO catalysts (prototypes of Cu/ZnO(Al2O3)) derived from aurichalcite exhibited high conversions of FFA even at low temperature (120 °C), implying their excellent catalytic activity for furfural hydrogenation [7]. Subsequently, the aurichalcite derived Cu/ZnO catalysts were further investigated as a function of Cu:Zn (molar ratio). Cu/ZnO catalyst with a Cu:Zn (mol:mol) ≈0.8 was suggested as the optimized one benefit from the strong “precursor effect” [8]. Cu/ZnO(X) (X = additives) catalysts had been widely utilized in various chemical processes such as methanol synthesis from CO/CO2, water-gas shift reaction and steam reforming of methanol etc. for decades due to their excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for CO bonds hydrogenation [9–11]. The additives used in practical industrial application were usually Cr2O3 or Al2O3. As a kind of available support or additive in catalyst industry, Al2O3 was much more commonly utilized as forms of α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3 and amorphous Al2O3 according to its good environmental friendliness and acceptable price [12–14]. The forms of Al2O3 could stem from different processing methods of Al(OH)3 precursors [12,13]. As the precursors of Al2O3, Al(OH)3 could be classified as pseudo-boehmite, bayerite, gibbsite etc. based on their stabilized crystalline phases. As the prototype of Cu/ZnO(Al2O3), aluminum absent Cu/ZnO had been investigated for decades and confirmed to be commonly derived from precipitated or co-precipitated precursors or their mixtures mainly consisted of aurichalcite (Cux,Zn1-x)5(CO3)2(OH)6 and zincian malachite (rosasite) (Cux,Zn1-x)2(CO3)(OH)2 [15]. Although the preferred precursor phase for catalytic processes such as methanol synthesis and water-gas shift reactions was usually regarded as zincian malachite [16,17], the better precursor phase for other reactions was ambiguous yet. Noteworthily, Al2O3 is also one of the indispensable ingredients in the practical industrial catalysts. There were various of mass ratios (CuO:ZnO:Al2O3) had been reported as the optimization for different chemical processes[18–20]. However, the content of Al2O3 should be less than 10% [20]. Generally, copper species (Cu° and/or Cu+) were regarded as the main catalytic active sites in Cu-based catalysts[21,22] due to their adsorption and activation of H2 in hydrogenation processes. ZnO could be confirmed to act as a support and co-catalyst attributed to the strong Cu-ZnO interaction [23–25]. The role of Al2O3 was commonly regarded as a kind of physical promoter to improve thermal stability of the catalysts rather than an electronic additive [26]. Although Cu/ZnO(Al2O3) catalysts had been implied in various hydrogenation processes for decades, roles of components in the multicomponent composites were usually a “black box” due to a lack of systemic investigation. Additionally, preparation methods in the practical industrial processes were seldom reported because of confidentiality of the commercial catalysts. As mentioned above, aurichalcite was demonstrated to be the optimized prototype for Cu/ZnO(Al2O3) catalysts for FFA hydrogenation [7,8]. In this contribution, the optimized aurichalcite was modified by different precursors of Al2O3 to construct novel Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites to obtain better catalytic performance for FFA hydrogenation. The most pervasive Cu/ZnO(Al2O3) catalysts were prepared from co-precipitated precursors from Cu2+, Zn2+ and Al3+. Al(NO3)3 was the commonly used Al2O3 source in the reported co-precipitation methods [27–29]. In addition, it is acknowledged that pseudo-boehmite is also the most frequently utilized precursor of industrial Al2O3. To obtain different Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites, Al(NO3)3, pseudo-boehmite and as-prepared Al(OH)3 were introduced as the different sources of Al2O3. The different Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites were systematically investigated by various characterization techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, AES, N2O-titration, H2-TPR and N2 adsorption experiments. Eventually, catalytic activity of the novelly constructed Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 was improved in comparison with Cu/ZnO."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation methods,"2.1 Preparation methods CZA-0. Precursor of the Al absent catalyst was prepared by typical “decreased pH” precipitated method described by Bems et al. [30]. Based on our previous work[8], Cu/Zn (mol/mol) was set as 0.8. Two kinds of aqueous solution were prepared before the precipitation, solution A: Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O while (Cu2++Zn2+) = 1M and solution B: 0.5 M Na2CO3 (about 1.2 L). Solution A was introduced into B by peristaltic pump under vigorous stirring until pH = 6.5–7, the reaction temperature was controlled at 65 °C by using a water bath. After the precipitation, the suspension was aged for 60 min in the mother liquor under the same conditions and then filtered, washed by deionized water for five times, followed by dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The dried precursor was grinded by using a mortar for 20 min and then calcined by using a muffle furnace in air atmosphere. The furnace was heated to 350 °C from room temperature (1 °C per minute) and held for 3 h. CZA-x (x= Al2O3 sources). Precursors of the catalysts with different Al sources were prepared by modified method. Aluminum sources were set as Al(NO3)3 (x = NO and NO8), as-prepared Al(OH)3 (x = OH) and industrial pseudo-boehmite (x = PB). CZA-NO and CZA-NO8 (corresponding to theoretical 4% and 8% Al content in final catalyst, respectively): the aqueous solution A described above was replaced by a mixed solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O while (Cu2++Zn2++Al3+) = 1M and Cu:Zn(mol:mol) = 0.8. The residual preparation procedures were similar with CZA-0 described above. CZA-OH and CZA-PB: the preparation procedures of CZA-0 described above could be also referred to CZA-OH and CZA-PB. Noteworthily, both as-prepared Al(OH)3 (suspension) and grinded industrial pseudo-boehmite (>200 mesh, powder) was introduced into CZA-0 during its ageing period. As-prepared Al(OH)3 . As-prepared Al(OH)3 was obtianed from a fresh precipitation of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and NaOH in their aqueous solutions. Solutions A (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) and B (NaOH) were prepared based on the stoichiometric ratio before the precipitation. Solution B was dropped into A under a continuous stirring to avoid the generation of AlO2 −. After the precipitation, a milky suspension of Al(OH)3 was obtained."
3,Evaluation of catalysts,"2.2 Evaluation of catalysts Catalytic performance of the catalysts for hydrogenation of FFA was carried out in a vertical tubular fixed-bed reactor with a length of 500 mm and i.d. of 12 mm. All the catalysts were shaped with a pressure of 40 MPa and crushed to 20–40 mesh before the evaluation. Catalysts was reduced in a H2/N2(10:90, V/V) flow at 250 °C for 120 min in situ before the reaction. After the reduction, the gas flow was switched to pure hydrogen and the reactant (pure FFA) were injected by a constant-flux pump (about 2.07 m L/h) to mix with hydrogen and induced into a pre-heater (heated to 100 °C) connected above the reactor. The H2 flow with a high speed (about 160 ml/min controlled by a flowmeter) acted as both carrier gas and reactant. On bottom of the reactor, the product tank equipped with a condensation system was connected. The reaction take placed in ambient pressure, the products were collected and analyzed by using an off-line gas chromatograph instrument (GC6890, Agilent, USA). A capillary column (polyethandiol, 30 m × 0.32 mm) and a flame ionization detector were used in the system. Mole ratios of components in the products were calculated by normalization method on basis of integrated peak areas in GC graphs. The calibration factors of FFA and FOL were close to each other (about 1.289 and 1.275, respectively). Conversion, selectivity and carbon balance were calculated based on the following equations and the error was about ±3%: (1) C o n v e r s i o n % = M o l e o f f u r f u r a l c o n v e r t e d m o l M o l e o f f u r f u r a l f e d m o l × 100 (2) S e l e c t i v i t y % = M o l e o f t h e p r o d u c t p r o d u c e d m o l M o l e o f f u r f u r a l c o n v e r t e d m o l × 100 (3) C a r b o n b a l a n c e % = M o l e o f c a r b o n c o l l e c t e d m o l M o l e o f c a r b o n f e d ( m o l ) × 100"
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods The composition of the samples was determined by ICP optical emission spectroscopy (Optima2100DV, PerkinElmer). XRD of precursors and calcined catalysts were conducted on a Rigaku D/max-2000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) operating at 40 kV under a scanning speed of 4°/min. XRD of the reduced catalysts were determined after the reduction conducted in a tube furnace under the experimental conditions. A Nicolet NEXUS 470 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1 was used to obtain IR spectra of the precursors. The determined powder samples were mixed with 2 wt% KBr. Raman patterns were recorded with a LabRAM HR800 system equipped with a CCD detector at room temperature. The 325 nm of the He–Cd laser was used as the exciting source with a power of 30 MW. BET surface areas, pore diameters and pore volumes of catalysts were measured by N2 physical adsorption experiments on an ASAP 2420 instrument (Micromeritics Co. Ltd.) after the catalysts were degassed at 350 °C for 8 h. Dispersion of Cu and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) were both performed on Auto Chem II 2920 instrument (Micromeritics, USA) equipped with a TCD and the former was determined by N2O chemisorption experiments. All the H2-TPR experiments were conducted with a 10 vol% H2/He mixture (50 cm3 min−1) (a heating rate of 5 °C min−1). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) experiments were performed on a VG MiltiLab 2000 spectrometer equipped with an in situ reaction cell. The XPS and AES experiments of reduced samples were performed after an in situ reduction at 250 °C for 2 h. All of the samples were reduced in a H2/Ar (or N2) (10%, V/V) flow in the experiments if necessary."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of Cu/ZnO-Al2O3,"3.1 Characterization of Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 Available techniques were conducted to investigate crystalline structures of the dried precursors. As shown in Fig. 1 (A), the evident XRD peaks positioned at 2θ = 13.0°(400), 24.2°(610), 27.4°(511), 30.9°(420), 34.3°(620) etc. can be assigned to characteristic peaks of pure aurichalcite (Cu,Zn)5(CO3)2(OH)6 (PDF# 17-0743). The main crystalline phase of the Al absent precursor (CZA-0) could be attributed to aurichalcite. However, the appearance of peaks at 2θ = 14.6°(200) and 17.5°(210) in CZA-NO (marked with “ZM”) should indicate that the addition of aluminum resulted in the generation of zincian malachite (PDF# 36-1475). Additionally, crystallinity of the precursors was declined as the doping of aluminum. This could be further demonstrated by XRD pattern of CZA-NO8 (seen in the figure). It should be deduced that the introduction of aluminum would gravely influence crystalline structure of the precursors. However, crystalline structures of CZA-OH and CZA-PB retained well according to their similar XRD patterns with CZA-0. The introduction of aluminum by using aluminium hydroxide might not influence crystalline properties of the precursors due to indiscerptibility of the aluminum sources. XRD patterns of the Al(OH)3 (dried as-prepared Al(OH)3 and pseudo-boehmite) were also exhibited in Fig. 1(B). The samples exhibited similar locations of the diffraction peaks. This might imply their similar crystalline types. However, diffraction peaks of the as-prepared Al(OH)3 precursor were much weaker than the purchased pseudo-boehmite. This should indicate that the former one was provided with more amorphous structure and lesser crystalline size. Crystalline structures of the dried precursors were investigated by FT-IR spectra as well. As shown in Fig. 1(C), the five absorption peaks appearing in the range of 1700–1100 cm–1 (1556, 1506, 1411, 1363 and 1208 cm−1) could be assigned to ν3 (asymmetric CO stretching) mode of the carbonate anions in aurichalcite [8,31]. The absorption peaks at 1100, 1050, 880 and 820 cm−1 could be owed to OH deformation vibrations and further carbonate bands of zincian malachite [8,31,32], while 970 and 840 cm−1 could be credited to aurichalcite [23,31,33,34]. Besides, the bands at 752 cm−1 could be attributed to the ν4 asymmetric OCO bending modes [8,33,34]. According to the observed peaks of CZA-0, the main crystalline phase of CZA-0 could be assigned to aurichalcite. The appearance of absorption peaks at 1100, 1050 and 820 cm−1 (marked with red numbers) should indicate generation of zincian malachite in the aluminum doped CZA-NO, especially in CZA-NO8. In addition, the damped absorption peaks of CZA-NO as well as CZA-NO8 should indicate the decline of crystallinity of the aluminum doped precursors. However, the FT-IR patterns of CZA-OH and CZA-PB were quite similar with CZA-0. This should imply their similar crystalline phase and coincided well with XRD results. Based on the XRD and FT-IR results, it could be speculated that the introduction of Al3+ (Al(NO3)3) in the co-precipitated precursors could decline crystallinity of aurichalcite and result in generation of zincian malachite. Crystallization of aurichalcite could be restrained by the dissociative Al3+, which might be due to a decline of the connections between CuO6 and ZnO6 octahedral units in the hydroxycarbonate precursors because of the insertion of AlO6 [35,36]. The co-precipitation of single Cu-Al hydroxycarbonate phase was not preferred due to the stronger Jahn-Teller effect between Cu and Al and this might result in generation of separate Zn-Al hydroxycarbonate phase [35,37]. As a result, the residual Cu/Zn ratio would exceed the appropriate range for the formation of aurichalcite (Cu/Zn must <1) [30,35]. Therefore, crystallinity of aurichalcite declined and zincian malachite generated in the Al3+ doped precursors. As demonstrated in the previous work, crystalline phase of the precursors was significant in determining catalytic performance of the catalysts acting as the “precursor effect” [7,8]. Aurichalcite had been suggested as the better phase for FFA hydrogenation benefit from its superior physicochemical properties and Cu-ZnO interaction [7,8]. The perturbation of precursor phase would differentiate physicochemical properties of the catalysts. Fig. 2 showed XRD patterns of the calcined and reduced Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 samples. The diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 35.6°(002), 38.7°(111) etc. could be assigned to CuO (PDF# 45-0937). All the residual peaks could be attributed to ZnO (PDF# 36-1451). The characteristic peaks of Al2O3 were not observed due to low content and less crystallinity of the aluminum species. As displayed in the figure, the diffraction peaks of CZA-NO declined in comparison with CZA-0. This should imply that the introduction of aluminum would decline crystallinity of the CuO/ZnO composites. The phenomenon could be further demonstrated by CZA-NO8. It is acknowledged that crystallinity of the composites partly reflects dispersion of catalysts. The dispersion of copper species might be influenced by the introduction of aluminum components. As shown in Fig. 2(B), two diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 43.3°(111), 50.4°(200) could be accounted for metallic copper (PDF# 04-0836). All the residual peaks could be ascribed to ZnO (PDF# 36-1451). The lower diffraction peaks of CZA-NO (Cu(111), marked in the figure) might indicate that the doping of Al3+ could improve dispersion of copper species compared with CZA-0. However, a further improvement of dispersion might not be obtained in the Al3+ enhanced samples according to CZA-NO8. On the other hand, diffraction peaks of ZnO in the Al(NO3)3 modified samples were gradually subdued as the augment of aluminum content. This might imply that the introduction of aluminum in the samples could increase dispersion of ZnO species benefit from Zn-Al interaction originated from their changed precursors [35]. Interestingly, CZA-OH modified by the as-prepared Al(OH)3 displayed similar XRD patterns with CZA-NO in both calcined and reduced forms. Meanwhile, XRD patterns of CZA-PB exhibited few alterations in comparison with the Al absent CZA-0. In consideration of the almost uniform crystalline properties of the precursors of CZA-0, CZA-OH and CZA-PB demonstrated in Fig. 1(A) and (C), it might be inferred that crystalline and dispersion properties of the Cu/ZnO could be also modified by the indiscerptible Al(OH)3 materials via the interaction between metal oxides established in calcined and/or reduced processes. Raman spectroscopy was also conducted to further confirm structural information of the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. As shown in Fig. 3 (A), the three asymmetric LO multiphonon peaks of ZnO nanoparticles could be easily observed at around 580, 1140 and 1720 cm−1[38,39]. The peak absence of CuO and Al2O3 nanoparticles might indicate their less crystallinity. Noteworthily, the evidently less intensity of the peak located at 1140 cm−1 of CZA-NO and CZA-NO8 in comparison with CZA-0 should imply that crystalline structure of ZnO nanoparticles were disordered by the Zn-Al interaction originated from the precursors, as demonstrated above. This could be further verified by the peak located at 1720 cm−1. However, the decline of peaks was not obviously observed in the Al(OH)3 modified samples (CZA-OH and CZA-PB). It might be inferred that the generated Zn-Al hydroxycarbonate in the precursors could result in more close-knit interaction between zinc and aluminum species than the less connected Al(OH)3. H2-TPR experiments were also conducted to investigate reduction properties of the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. As the curves depicted in Fig. 3(B), all the samples exhibited asymmetric peaks between 100 °C and 250 °C, implying that all of them could be reduced before 250 °C. According to the curves of CZA-NO and CZA-0, the introduction of Al3+ dramatically improved reduction temperature. The shift of reduction temperature could be further demonstrated by CZA-NO8. CuO/ZnO composites derived from zincian malachite should exhibit higher reduction temperature [7,8]. The generation of zincian malachite in the precursor of CZA-NO (demonstrated in Fig. 1) should be partially responsible for the shift of reduction temperature. What’s more, as reported by Zhang et al., the shift to higher reduction temperature could be obviously observed in the thin Al2O3 layer overcoated Cu/Cr2O4 catalyst [38]. The higher reduction temperature might be attributed to more Al2O3 species overcoated in the interface of CuO/ZnO species [38]. Interestingly, the H2-TPR curve of CZA-OH displayed a similar shift of reduction temperature in comparison with CZA-NO. This should indicate that Al component derived from as-prepared Al(OH)3 might actually work in the interface of CuO/ZnO nanoparticles. The well retained aurichalcite structure of CZA-OH (demonstrated in XRD and Raman results) might indicate that the modification caused by Al component should also take place along with transformation of the precursor when calcined and/or reduced. On the contrary, the similar curves of CZA-PB and CZA-0 should indicate that Al component derived from pseudo-boehmite did not obviously influence reduction properties of the CuO/ZnO composites. The shift of reduction temperature of CZA-NO and CZA-OH should further demonstrate that Al2O3 species would play a non-negligible role in the CuO/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were used to investigate electronic states of elements in the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. As shown in Fig. 4 (A), the absence of “shakeup” peaks of the binding energy (BE) at 940–945 eV should indicate that Cu2+ was completely reduced to Cu° and/or Cu+ in all the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites [7,8,39,40]. The similar XPS patterns of the samples might imply their parallel electronic states of copper. In addition, valence states of copper were further characterized by AES analysis. As exhibited in Fig. 4(B), the peaks of kinetic energy (KE) located at around 919.0 eV and 916.7 eV could be attributed to Cu° and Cu+ [8,39]. The dominated Cu° peaks compared with inappreciable Cu+ indicated that states of the copper species should be practically attributed to metallic Cu°. It could be inferred that the doping of aluminum did not notably change electronic states of all the copper species. This should imply less interaction of copper and aluminum species, as discussed above. Furthermore, electronic states of Zn species were investigated by XPS analysis of Zn 2p. As depicted in Fig. 4(C), the evident peaks of BE located at around 1021.0 eV and 1044.0 eV could be ascribed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively [41,42]. The gradual shift to higher BE of CZA-NO and CZA-NO8 compared with CZA-0 should imply that the doping of Al3+ resulted in a change of electronic states of Zn species. As a result, the Zn 2p3/2 BE of CZA-NO8 was about 0.5 eV higher than CZA-0. However, CZA-OH and CZA-PB exhibited slighter shift of BE in comparison with CZA-NO. The electronic state of zinc could be more obviously revealed by AES analysis. Fig. 5 showed the multi-peaks of ZnLMM AES of the samples; the prominent KE peak located at around 988.5 eV could be attributed to Zn2+[7,8,43]. The gradual shift to lower KE of CZA-NO and CZA-NO8 compared with CZA-0 could demonstrate the evident electronic disturbance of Zn in the Al3+ doped samples and coincided well with XPS results. Moreover, the visible KE peak located at around 991.5 eV was suggested to be the evidence of partially reduced Znx+ (0 < × < 2) species in the interface of Cu-ZnO[7,8,43]; and this should demonstrate the existence of electronic perturbation between Cu° and ZnO acting as Cu-ZnO interaction[7,8,44]. As reported by Kuld et al., there was about 10% of Znx+ could be observed in all the catalysts based on deconvolution of the fit of ZnLMM Auger peaks [43]. Noteworthily, Znx+ peaks of the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites displayed different shift in comparison with practical bulk Zn° which should be located at 992.4 eV [39,42]. As shown in Table 1 , the KE shift of ZnLMM in Znx+ of all the samples could be sequenced as CZA-NO8 > CZA-NO > CZA-OH > CZA-PB > CZA-0. As a result, the KE shift of Znx+ in CZA-NO8 was about 0.83 eV higher than that of Al absent CZA-0 (1.33 eV vs. 0.50 eV). The shift to lower KE of Znx+ should indicate that the reduction degree of ZnO was partially restrained due to the lower electron density of zinc in the Al3+ rich samples; this could be also supported by the Zn 2p XPS results. There should be stronger Zn-Al interaction in the Al3+ rich samples, as demonstrated above. It could be speculated that Cu-ZnO interaction derived from aurichalcite might be declined along with the enhanced Zn-Al interaction in the Al3+ introduced Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. Main physicochemical properties including the mentioned crucial parameters such as dispersion, crystalline size, and average particle size of the samples were further quantificated by available techniques. As shown in Table 2 , BET surface areas of the samples were increased along with the doping of Al components benefit from larger BET surface area of Al2O3 species [26,35]. The higher values of CZA-OH (69.6 m2 g−1) and CZA-PB (74.8 m2 g−1) compared with CZA-NO (58.7 m2 g−1) might indicate that the Al(OH)3 precursors could improve BET surface area more obviously. Crystalline sizes of the calcined and reduced samples were both calculated by Scherrer equation based on the XRD patterns provided above. As exhibited in Table 2, the size of CuO decreased from 11.4 nm (CZA-0) to 9.2 nm (CZA-NO) as the introduction of Al3+. However, improvement of Al3+ (CZA-NO8) did not further decline the crystalline size of CuO. Instead, CZA-NO8 showed a much larger crystalline size of Cu in comparison with CZA-NO (10.2 nm vs. 8.0 nm). This might be ascribed to the enhanced generation of zincian malachite in the precursor of CZA-NO8 [7,8]. In conclusion, crystalline size of Cu of the catalysts could be sequenced as CZA-NO < CZA-OH < CZA-NO8 < CZA-PB < CZA-0. It might be inferred that dispersion of copper species had been all improved by the introduction of Al both in forms of Al(NO3)3 and Al(OH)3. On the other hand, crystalline size of ZnO of the samples could be sequenced as CZA-NO8 < CZA-NO < CZA-OH < CZA-PB < CZA-0. Interestingly, this sequence coincided well with the KE shift of Znx+ exhibited in Table 1. This might indicate that the dispersion of zinc species could be steadily improved benefit from the closer connection of Zn-Al than Cu-Al [30]. As reported by Li et al., the reason behind the size effect of Ir/CeO2 catalyst was the modulation of the chemistry state of Ir species by the substrate, cerium oxide [45]. In this work, the more obviously electronic disturbance of Znx+ species should match the less size of ZnO in the Al doped composites. Additionally, the visible modulation of ZnO by the Al(OH)3 (CZA-OH and CZA-PB) should indicate that the preferred Zn-Al interaction might be established along with the decomposition of aurichalcite and Al(OH)3. The dispersion of copper species (DCu), average size of copper nanoparticles (dCu) and copper surface area (SCu) were also determined by N2O titration experiments. As exhibited in Table 2, dCu of the samples performed the values coincided well with the calculated results from XRD. SCu had been commonly regarded as one of the crucial factors in determining catalytic activity of Cu-based catalysts. As shown in Table 2, SCu of the catalysts could be sequenced as CZA-NO > CZA-OH > CZA-0 > CZA-PB > CZA-NO8. It could be concluded on basis of the characterization results stated above that the Al components should play nonnegligible roles in influencing physicochemical properties of the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. The introduction of Al3+ might lead to a preferred combination of Zn-Al species and reduce proportion of aurichalcite phase in the co-precipitated precursors. As described in Scheme 2 , dispersion of the composites could be improved by the introduction of Al components. All the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites showed better dispersion than the Al absent Cu/ZnO. However, the enhanced Zn-Al interaction should result in a decline of Cu-ZnO interaction along with the reducing of aurichalcite phase [7,8]. The partial reducibility of ZnO in the Cu-ZnO interface could be restrained by Al2O3 in Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. It might be speculated that performance of ZnO (co-catalyst via the strong Cu-ZnO interaction [7,8,23,24]) could be partially hindered in the Al3+ doped Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites."
7,Evaluation of catalysts,"3.2 Evaluation of catalysts The Al3+ doped Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites with different Al contents were firstly evaluated as the catalysts for FFA hydrogenation under mild conditions (bellow 120 °C, ambient pressure). As shown in Table 3 , all the catalysts exhibited similar selectivity of FOL (>96%) in spite of their different conversions of FFA. Selectivity of 2-MF and byproducts were enlarged as the increase of reaction temperature. According to the higher activation energy, side reactions such as hydrogenolysis of COH group and ring-open reactions would be enhanced due to increase of reaction temperature [7,46]. As expected, the increase of reaction temperature from 100 °C to 120 °C improved FFA conversion over all the catalysts but slightly declined selectivity of FOL. The yield of FOL should be decreased as a further increase of reaction temperature above 120 °C [7,46]. On the other hand, conversions of FFA over the catalysts were firstly increased and then decreased as the improvement of aluminum contents from 0% to 8%. This should indicate different catalytic activity of them. The best conversion of FFA could be attributed to CZA-NO (65.7% at 100 °C and 94.9% at 120 °C). CZA-NO with the moderate content of Al2O3 performed the best catalytic activity for FFA hydrogenation. As the introduction of Al components, the constructed Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 exhibited different catalytic activity compared with the Al absent Cu/ZnO. Furthermore, catalytic performances of Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts assisted by different Al sources (Al(NO3)3, as-prepared Al(OH)3 and pseudo-boehmite) were evaluated under the same conditions. As shown in Table 4 , excellent selectivity of FOL could be obtained over all the catalysts at 100 °C (>98%). As stated above, the improvement of reaction temperature to 120 °C enlarged conversion of FFA but declined selectivity of FOL. On the other hand, the constructed Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts performed notably disparate conversions of FFA under the same experimental conditions. This indicated that the catalysts assisted by several Al sources should possess different catalytic activity. The best conversion of FFA could be attributed to CZA-OH at both reaction temperatures. This implied that Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 assisted by as-prepared aluminum hydroxide should be the most active catalyst for FFA hydrogenation. As the result, the optimized CZA-OH catalyst performed the best conversion of 98% with FOL selectivity of 97.5% at 120 °C. On basis of results exhibited in the table, conversion of FFA over the Al absent Cu/ZnO catalyst could be further improved over the constructed Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites (CZA-OH) from 84.9% to 98.0% at 120 °C and 51.4% to 72.1% at 100 °C with a high selectivity of FOL (≈98%). In other words, catalytic activity of the Cu/ZnO could be further improved by an appropriate construction of Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts. This should also indicate that the role of Al2O3 must be far more than a physical promoter. The continuous production of FOL over the optimized CZA-OH at 100 °C had been also shortly conducted as a function of time on stream (TOS). As depicted in Fig. 6 , the catalyst exhibited high initial catalytic activity for FFA hydrogenation within 24 h TOS but exhibited a gradual decline of conversion after about 28 h TOS. This should be attributed to the deposition of reactants and products on active surface of the catalyst due to the low temperature [8]. Additionally, the catalysts assisted by Al(NO3)3 (CZA-NO and CZA-NO8) were also evaluated and showed the similar decline of conversion with CZA-OH. However, catalytic activity of the catalysts could be consistently sequenced as CZA-OH > CZA-NO > CZA-NO8 as the function of TOS. This further demonstrated the superiority of CZA-OH benefit from appropriate introduction of Al components. Combined with the characterization results and related experiments, it could be summarized that catalytic activity for FFA hydrogenation over the Cu/ZnO catalyst could be influenced by the introduction of aluminum. As demonstrated above, the content and source of Al played significant roles in influencing physicochemical properties of the constructed Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 composites. The introduction of Al components could not only improve dispersion of the composites but also restrain performance of the partially reduced Znx+ species in the Cu-ZnO interface. As the result, catalytic performances of the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts were differentiated. To further clarify function of the Al components, relationship between copper surface area (SCu), conversion of furfural and KE shift of ZnLMM in Znx+ (KE shift) was investigated as a function of the different catalysts. Generally, conversion of FFA implies catalytic activity of the catalysts and KE shift stands for states of Znx+ in the composites. As shown in Fig. 7 , conversions over most of the catalysts were improved along with increase of SCu or decrease of the KE shift. As discussed above, the rise of KE shift should indicate the enhanced Zn-Al interaction or declined Cu-ZnO interaction in the aurichalcite derived catalysts. As demonstrated in our previous work, catalytic activity of the catalysts depends on both SCu and Cu-ZnO interaction [8]. Higher SCu and stronger Cu-ZnO interaction would result in better catalytic activity for FFA hydrogenation [8]. The lower catalytic activity of CZA-NO compared with CZA-OH in spite of its higher SCu should further confirm the negative role of Zn-Al interaction acted in the constructed Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts. As the result, CZA-OH assisted by the as-prepared Al(OH)3 showed the best catalytic activity for furfural hydrogenation benefit from its both excellent copper dispersion and strong Cu-ZnO interaction."
8,Conclusions,"Activity of the mineral derived Cu/ZnO for FFA hydrogenation was demonstrated to be gravely influenced by introduction of Al components. Conversion of FFA over the Cu/ZnO catalyst could be further improved from 84.9% to 98.0% at 120 °C and 51.4% to 72.1% at 100 °C with a high selectivity of FOL (≈98%) respectively. Above all, the role of Al components in Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts derived from the co-precipitated precursors had been clearly revealed to act as both structural and electronic promoter. The Zn-Al interaction had been demonstrated to exist and decrease activity of the Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts due to its decline of original Cu-ZnO interaction. The better activity of the novelly constructed Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 (assisted by as-prepared Al(OH)3 derived Al2O3) should benefit from its not only superior copper surface area but also reserved Cu-ZnO interaction. Eventually, this work raised more scientific explanations of the “black box” during preparations of the industrial Cu/ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts."
