0,Introduction,"Clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate (CHS, CAS Registry No. 120202–66-6) is an important antiplatelet agent occupying a large market share of anti-thrombotic drugs. It has received extensive attention in the treatments of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to the strong curative effect, low cost, and low side effects [1,2]. There are two polymorphs of CHS for pharmaceutical use [3]. Compared with the commercial form II, the metastable form I presents higher solubility and bioavailability, which is a significant advantage for drugs [4,5]. Unfortunately, the irregular powder shape and small particle size of CHS (form I) are severe problems for the downstream operation. The metastable form I tends to transform into form II or gel in the crystallization process. These disadvantages limit its industrial applications. The key of solving the above problems is the design of the crystallization process to prepare the spherical particles with good powder properties (high bulk density and good flowability), and ensure no polymorph transformation or gelation. Most research about CHS (form I) focused on the crystallization in a single solvent system. Chen et al. [6] prepared CHS (form I) spherical particles under the single solvent (2-butanol) system by spherulitic growth method [7], which improved the powder properties. Zhang et al. [8] studied the reactive crystallization and polymorph transformation of CHS in nine single solvents at 313.15 K, which explored the influence of solvent and supersaturation. The gelation of CHS has been reported but little studied even though it is considered to be a serious problem that causes crystallization failure [9,10]. Therefore, in the crystallization process of CHS (form I), there are problems of poor powder properties and low stability (polymorph transformation and gelation). In order to accomplish controllable preparation of CHS (form I), these problems need to be solved simultaneously. However, for the crystallization of multiple targets (spherulitic growth, no polymorph transformation, and no gelation), it is difficult to form a reliable particle design scheme in the single solvent system. In general, the spherulitic growth requires a high degree of supersaturation [7,11,12], and the preparation (monotropic polymorph systems) of metastable forms requires a low temperature to avoid polymorph transformation [8]. Nonetheless, the high supersaturation and low temperature inevitably increase the concentration of CHS, which may cause gelation [13]. Thus, it is difficult to balance these three requirements (high supersaturation, low temperature, and low concentration) in a single solvent system. This leads to the unstable and low efficiency of the current preparation process of CHS (form I). Hence, it is still an unsolved problem in the prior art to prepare CHS (form I) with both good powder properties and high stability. This work proposed a feasible scheme for solving the multi-target regulation issue by building spherulitic growth operating space in binary solvent systems instead of single solvent systems. A type of “isopropyl acetate + lower alcohol” solvent systems were rationally selected by solubility data and molecular dynamics simulation to induce spherulitic growth of CHS (form I) during the crystallization. Furthermore, ATR-FTIR and inverted tube method were used to give an insight into the mechanism of polymorph transformation and gelation, which help design optimal crystallization processes that can achieve the multi-targets of good powder properties, no polymorph transformation and no gelation for CHS (form I). According to the enhanced spherulitic growth operating space, the metastable form of CHS with good powder properties and high stability were prepared successfully, which provides application prospects."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Clopidogrel camphorsulfonate was bought from ZH Chemical (Hangzhou) Technology Co., Ltd., with mass purity >99%. The 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, and isopropyl acetate were bought from Shanghai Aladdin BioChem Co., Ltd., with purity >99% (HPLC). All of the chemicals were used without further purification. More detailed information is listed in the Supporting Information (Table S1)."
3,Preparation of spherical crystals,"2.2 Preparation of spherical crystals Spherical crystals were prepared by reaction and cooling crystallization process. A certain amount of clopidogrel camphorsulfonate was dissolved in dichloromethane with pH > 7 adjusted by the saturated sodium carbonate solution, which formed two phases, i.e. the organic phase and the water phase. The organic phase was separated by liquid separation and the water in the organic phase was removed by anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Clopidogrel alkali was obtained by rotary evaporation of the organic phase and then was dissolved in a solvent system (i.e. 2-butanol, 1-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 1-butanol + isopropyl acetate, or 2-butanol + isopropyl acetate). Concentrated sulfuric acid was dripped to react with clopidogrel alkali generating CHS under the conditions of temperature 303.15 K and reaction duration 5 min. Subsequently, the system was cooled to the terminal temperature (298.15 K for the single solvent system and 288.15 K for the binary solvent systems), meanwhile the crystal seeds of form I were added to ensure that the supersaturation was consumed on spherulitic growth instead of nucleation. Finally, CHS (form I) was obtained at a certain time and then dried for 2 h at 323.15 K. More detailed information is listed in the Supporting Information (Table S2). The supersaturation (S) is defined by Eq. 1. (1) S = c CHS , act c CHS , sat where c CHS,act and c CHS,sat represent the actual concentration and equilibrium concentration of CHS in the system, respectively."
4,Polymorph transformation experiments,"2.3 Polymorph transformation experiments The polymorph transformation experiments of CHS (form I) were investigated by the in-situ detection and offline characterization. The CHS (form I) was suspended in five solvent systems at the temperature of 298.15 K, 303.15 K, 308.15 K, and 313.15 K, respectively. ATR-FTIR (ReactIRTM15, Mettler Toledo Co. Ltd., Switzerland) was used to monitor the polymorph transformation process in real-time. Simultaneously, a small number of solids taken out at regular intervals were analyzed by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, D/MAX-2500, Rigaku, Japan) to support the results of ATR-FTIR. Each trial was performed at least three times for precision."
5,Gelation experiments,"2.4 Gelation experiments The occurrence of gelation was investigated by the inverted tube method [13,14]. The solution of CHS (form I) was prepared by the method in Section 2.2, and the concentration of CHS was kept constant (c CHS = 0.0185 mol/mol) after the reaction in each solvent system. Subsequently, the experiment temperature was cooled to a succession of values (273.15 K, 278.15 K, 283.15 K, 288.15 K, 293.15 K). When the white flocs were observed, it was regarded as the beginning of gelation in CHS (form I) crystallization process. Then a certain mass was sampled and stored for a period of time at room temperature. If no flow was observed when the test tube was inverted, the solution was assumed to be gelled. Finally, the gel was taken out and weighed. Each trial was repeated at least three times. The concentration of CHS (c CHS) is defined by Eq. 2. (2) c CHS = n CHS n sol where n CHS and n sol represent the mole of CHS and solvent (2-butanol, 1-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 1-butanol + isopropyl acetate, 2-butanol + isopropyl acetate), respectively. The maximum concentration (c max) is defined as the concentration that causes the system to gel at a certain temperature."
6,Molecular dynamics simulation,"2.5 Molecular dynamics simulation The isosteric adsorption heats between different solvent molecules and crystal surfaces of CHS (form I) were calculated to estimate the solvent-surface interaction. The Forcite module of Materials Studio 5.0 [15] was used to determine the optimized unit cells of CHS (form I), and various force fields and atomic charge models were used. The force field and charge models used to perform the other calculations reported were selected on the principle of generating the minimum deviation between the experimental initial crystal structure and the final optimized structure [16]. Using the Morphology module, the growth morphology of the CHS (form I) crystal was attained by calculating the attachment energy of all low refractive index surfaces of each crystal. The surfaces with the lowest energy were used to explore their interaction with various adsorbent molecules by using the Sorption module (including 9 single solvents and 4 binary solvents). Full details of the calculations are reported in the Supporting Information."
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization The particle size analyzer (Mastersizer3000, Malvern Instruments Ltd., England) was used to measure the particle size distribution of spherical crystals. Headspace gas chromatography (BRUKER 450-GC, Bruker Daltonics, Germany) was used to determine the residual organic solvents in CHS (form I) products. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, model TM3000, Hitachi, Japan) pictures were applied to analyze the crystal morphology of the spherical crystals."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Selection of solvent systems,"3.1 Selection of solvent systems A suitable binary solvent system plays a key role in solving the multi-target regulation issue of CHS (form I) crystallization. For screening the systems, two principles are considered carefully: a) The solubility of CHS (form I) in two solvents must be significantly different so that the solvent environment of low concentration and high supersaturation can be tuned by solvent ratio. b) The solvent effect should be similar to the reported system to ensure that the spherulitic growth mechanism does not interfere with the solvent effect to the greatest extent. The details of screening solvent systems by the two principles are discussed below. 3.1.1 Selecting solvents by solubility As mentioned above, in order to meet the requirements of low concentration and high supersaturation of CHS (form I) in the spherulitic growth process, the solubility of CHS (form I) in the two selected solvents must be obviously different. The solubility data of CHS (form I) in 14 common single solvents has been reported, e.g., ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-pentanol, etc. [8,17–19]. It is found that CHS (form I) has a higher solubility in lower alcohols and is difficult to dissolve in ester solvents. Thus, the solubility data of CHS (form I) in the binary solvent [20–23] combination of lower alcohols and esters could vary significantly with the ester mole fraction and temperature gradient. For instance, the solubility of CHS (form I) in 2-propanol is 8.5 times higher than that of 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate (the mole fraction of isopropyl acetate is 0.7, or x IPAC = 0.7 for short) at 298.15 K. In addition, the higher alcohols, e.g. 1-pentanol, were not considered as the anti-solvent because of their immiscibility with lower alcohols. Hence, the binary solvent combination of lower alcohols and esters were selected qualitatively according to the solubilities. 3.1.2 Selecting solvents by solvent effect To avoid the interference of the solvent effects to a certain extent during the spherulitic growth process, it is necessary to select binary solvent systems with similar solvent effects to the reported solvent system. Isosteric heats of adsorption is the amount of heat released per unit molecule added to the adsorbed phase at constant temperature and loading, which can be used as the indicator to estimate the solvent effect [24–28]. Pagire et al. calculated the isosteric heats of adsorption of the bridging liquid on the crystal surface by molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the interaction between the bridging liquid and the crystal surface [16]. It is found that the isosteric adsorption heats can offer reasonable explanations of the solvent effect (the surface interactions between solute molecules and solvent molecules). Hence, this method is employed to explore the solvent effects and helps further select the binary solvent systems. 2-Butanol, the only reported solvent system in which CHS (form I) spherulites are formed, was regarded as a standard substance to calculate its isosteric adsorption heat on CHS (form I) to screen new solvent systems. Based on the calculated growth morphologies in a vacuum (Fig. 1a), the main surfaces of CHS (form I) were determined. The {001}, {100}, and 10 1 ¯ families of surfaces were calculated to provide 16.9%, 17.4%, and 28.3% of the surface area of the crystal, respectively. For instance, the structure of the 10 1 ¯ crystal surface is shown in Fig. 1b. By introducing adsorbent molecules into a vacuum layer composed of different crystal surfaces, e.g. 10 1 ¯ crystal surface, the constant load adsorption heat was calculated (Fig. 1c). The calculation details are provided in the Supporting Information. The isosteric adsorption heats of single solvent and binary solvent are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. In the single solvent, the isosteric adsorption heats of 1-pentanol, 1-octanol and isopropyl acetate on the main crystal surfaces are higher than that of lower alcohol. It means that the binary solvent composed of these solvents and lower alcohols with a certain ratio can reach the same isosteric adsorption heats level of 2-butanol indicating a similar solvent effect. Considering the selections in Section 3.1.1, a combination of isopropyl acetate and lower alcohol was selected. The isosteric adsorption heats of 4 binary solvents are shown in Fig. 2b (x IPAC = 0.6). It can be found that the simulation results of isopropyl acetate combined with 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol on the three main crystal surfaces are close to that of 2-butanol, which means that the effect of this group of binary solvents on the crystal is consistent with 2-butanol. In addition, molecular simulations with isopropyl acetate mole fractions of 0.1 and 0.9 were carried out, and the results of isosteric adsorption heats are within an acceptable range. It should be noted that the result of isosteric adsorption heats of the binary solvent system is not a simple superposition of the simulation results of a single solvent. Because the value is affected by not only the interaction between the solvent and the solute but also the size and spatial distribution of solvent molecules. As shown in Fig. 1b, the 10 1 ¯ crystal surface exposes the phenyl groups, ester groups, halogen bonds, and sulfate radicals, which can interact with different solvent molecules. Moreover, the embedded process of larger molecules is influenced by the pits of molecules arrangement on the crystal surface of CHS (form I). Therefore, the group distribution and molecular arrangement on the crystal surface are the sources of the influence of solvent molecules on crystal growth. Finally, 1-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 1-butanol + isopropyl acetate and 2-butanol + isopropyl acetate were selected as the binary solvent system for CHS (form I) spherulitic growth process."
10,Construction of spherulitic growth operating space,"3.2 Construction of spherulitic growth operating space In order to achieve the muti-targets of CHS (form I) crystallization in the selected solvent systems, operating space needs to be constructed in terms of supersaturation, temperature, and concentration. The selective spherulitic growth operating spaces for the three targets (spherulitic growth, no polymorph transformation, and no gelation) were constructed by determining three boundaries (supersaturation, temperature, and concentration). 2-Propanol + isopropyl acetate system is taken as an example to explain the detailed determination of operating space, while the ones of the other three binary solvent systems (i.e. 1-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 1-butanol + isopropyl acetate, and 2-butanol + isopropyl acetate) are provided in the Supporting Information. 3.2.1 The supersaturation range The supersaturation range relates to the spherulitic growth. Generally, a relatively high supersaturation may induce spherulitic growth in solution crystallization [7,29,30]. As supersaturation increases, the transition from metastable form to amorphous CHS is paralleled with the crystal morphology changes from block to needle (flake), then spherical (spherulites), and finally irregular shape. To explore the supersaturation range of the spherulitic growth of CHS (form I), experiments were established in different solvent systems with gradients of initial supersaturation (S = 8–45). The same diffraction peaks with the form I crystal seed (Fig. 3a) suggest that no polymorph transformation phenomenon occurs during the experiment when S < 30, see Fig. 3b, c, e, f. Fig. 3d and g show a halo pattern, indicating that it has become amorphous when S > 45. According to the results of spherulitic growth experiments under different initial supersaturation, as shown in Fig. 4a, d (larger particles are seeds and do not have branching), the low driving force is not enough to facilitate the rapid growth of branching when S ≤ 8. CHS (form I) spherulites can be obtained in the same supersaturation range (S = 10–42) under different solvent systems, and the radial structure can be observed in Fig. 4b, e. When S ≥ 45 (Fig. 4c and f), the amorphous form is precipitated, which is consistent with the reported literature [31]. The other groups of binary solvents also show the same results (Table S3). It clearly indicates that the selection by solvent effect in section 3.1 works. The similarity of the solvent effect of several solvent systems was designed to eliminate the interference of this factor on the spherulitic growth. Thus, it is ensured that CHS (form I) spherulitic growth is mainly affected by supersaturation instead of solvent. Considering “quality by design (QbD)” [32], a safety margin where the spherulitic growth occurs was reserved, and the corresponding supersaturation range was determined to be 12–40. 3.2.2 The maximum temperature The maximum temperature (T max) relates to the phenomenon of polymorph transformation. The polymorph transformation of CHS in various solvents is found to be monotropic, and the rate of transformation increases as the temperature rises [4,5,8,33]. Crystal suspension transformation experiments are designed to determine T max via monitoring the liquid phase concentration in real-time. The polymorph transformation processes of CHS (form I) in the selected solvent systems at temperatures of 298.15 K, 303.15 K, 308.15 K, 313.15 K are investigated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S1, the peak at wavenumber 1756 cm−1 presents high sensitivity to the concentration and is selected as the characteristic wavenumber. The experiment at 303.15 K is taken as an instance, the intensity of the characteristic peak changes with time in Fig. 6 , which is used to describe the changing trend of c CHS in solution [8]. According to the changing trend of c CHS, the whole transformation process can be divided into five stages, and the time when the transformation begins (t b) is the switching point of the first stage and the second stage. PXRD analysis is performed by sampling during different stages of the process to help prove the accuracy of the results (Fig. S2). (I) Before 51 min, the peak height reaches a plateau indicating that an excessive amount of CHS form I in the solvent system leads to a supersaturated state and a stable solution concentration. (II) At 51–192 min, the peak height decreases linearly with time. The reason is that the lower solubility of form II than that of form I generates supersaturation of form II leading to nucleation of form II, which decreases the c CHS. (III) At 192–456 min, the peak height reaches a plateau, indicating that there are still suspended CHS (form I) solids in the solution, and the dissolution of form I and the precipitation of form II occur simultaneously in the system. Thus, the c CHS reaches a dynamic equilibrium. (IV) At 456–563 min, the peak height gradually decreases, because the suspended form I solids are completely dissolved while form II is still crystallizing, which could not maintain the concentration dynamic balance of stage III, resulting in the decrease of solution concentration. (V) At 563–600 min, the peak height remains unchanged, on account of the concentration of the solution reaches the solubility of form II, the concentration of the solution no longer changes, and the polymorph transformation process is completed. Fig. 7 shows the infrared spectra of CHS at different experimental temperatures under the 2-butanol system (more details of Fig. 7c and d are in the Supporting Information, see Fig. S3 and S4). Since the t b drops significantly from 303.15 K to 308.15 K, the T max should be selected between 303.15 K and 308.15 K. The same conclusion can be obtained in the other four binary solvent systems (Fig. S5, S6, Table S3). From another perspective, as long as the crystallization operation is performed below this upper temperature, the polymorph transformation can be avoided to some extent. Because the spherulitic growth process tends to have a higher supersaturation, and it will inhibit the polymorph transformation to a certain extent [31]. Finally, considering “quality by design (QbD)”, the maximum temperature of CHS (form I) crystallization T max was determined to be 303.15 K after taking a safety margin of 5 K. 3.2.3 The minimum temperature and maximum concentration The minimum temperature (T min) and maximum concentration (c max) relate to the gelation during the crystallization. To avoid the gelation, two essential conditions need to be considered carefully, i.e. the presence of a gelator and the interaction between the gelator or between the gelator and the solvent [9,10,34]. In other words, the gelation is determined by the solvent type, temperature, and concentration. After the salt-forming reaction between clopidogrel alkali and sulfuric acid completes at a higher temperature, the solution is a clear and transparent light yellow liquid. As the temperature decreases, the solution system with high supersaturation is a hydrophobic sol state. It is a highly dispersed system with thermodynamically unstable states. Subsequently, micron-sized crystals appear in the solution act as gelators, indicating that the system gradually transforms into a sol system. When the temperature further decreases, it begins to appear white flocculent particles in the solution and eventually turns to be turbid, which explains the sol system will coagulate and lead to gelation. Hence, to ensure that no gelation occurs during the spherulitic growth process, it is necessary to obtain the T min and the corresponding c max of the spherulitic growth process by investigating the gelation process. It should be noted that the c min is calculated by the S min and is not discussed in this section. The inverted tube method was adopted to investigate the gelation in the selected solvent systems. As shown in Fig. 8a, gelation occurs with the formation of a highly entangled fibrillar like a three-dimensional network structure with crystals as cross-linking points, and the presence of cavities is attributed by evaporation of solvent encapsulated in this network. It proves that the structure is formed through the aggregation of micrometer-sized crystals, and the crystals play the role of gelator. As shown in Fig. 8b and c, the degree of gelation increases as the temperature decreases, and the T min is the transition temperature at which the mass percentage of gel begins to be greater than 0. It can be found that the 2-butanol system begins to gel at 288.15 K, thus, this temperature is the T min at 0.0185 mol/mol for the 2-butanol system. In other words, the c max at 288.15 K is 0.0185 mol/mol. Using the same method, it is found that the T min is 283.15 K for the gelation of the binary solvent system (2-propanol + isopropyl acetate) with a concentration of 0.0185 mol/mol. The other three groups of binary solvents also show the same results (Table S3). The conclusion can be drawn from the difference in T min that gel formation is the result of the solvation of CHS molecules. Molecule polarity, hydrogen bond donor/acceptor propensities, hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity tend to influence the strength of the intermolecular interaction, which will affect gelation [13]. The chemical structure of CHS as shown in Fig. 8d, it contains eight hydrogen acceptors and two hydrogen donor, which is prone to form hydrogen bonding with solvent. The hydrogen bonding ability of these solvents have obvious influence, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol can provide both a hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, but isopropyl acetate cannot provide hydrogen bond donors [22]. Therefore, the higher x IPAC or the lower c CHS will lead to the reduction of the number of hydrogen bonding formation, which reduces the possibility of gelation. This may be the reason that crystallization occurs in the binary solvent system with isopropyl acetate at a lower temperature without gelation. Hence, gelation can be avoided by keeping the temperature above T min (2-butanol: 288.15 K, 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate: 283.15 K) or the concentration below c max during the crystallization process. Compared with the single solvent system, the binary solvent system can reach a lower crystallization temperature during the spherulitic growth process at the same initial supersaturation. In other words, a higher c max can be provided in the binary solvent system than the single solvent system at the same crystallization temperature. Taking a 2-butanol system with the low c max as the standard, an appropriate c max was determined to be 0.0125 mol/mol with a certain safety margin. 3.2.4 Construction of the operating space The concept of operating space was introduced in its spherulitic growth process. The design and construction of operating space have a wide range of applications in the fields of environmental protection, chemical industry, quality inspection, etc. [35–39]. It can usually quantify the desire to achieve a certain goal while maintaining certain controllable variables within acceptable levels or boundaries. According to the above, the operating space boundaries (supersaturation, temperature, and concentration range) for spherulitic growth of CHS (form I) in the single solvent system and binary solvent systems were determined, and the operating space (two and three dimensions) were constructed based on these three thermodynamic correlations. In the two-dimensional operating space, the correlation analysis of the two operating parameters was performed (supersaturation and concentration). In other words, by setting the operating temperature (288.15 K) less than T max to ensure that no polymorph transformation occurs during the crystallization process, it is possible to explore the operating space that satisfies spherulitic growth and non-gelling. Combining Eq. (1–2) and solubility data, Eq. (3) (2-butanol) and Eq. (4) (2-propanol + isopropyl acetate) are derived from the correlation between supersaturation and concentration at 288.15 K. (3) S = M CHS M SBA × w SBA × c CHS (4) S = M CHS w IPA + IPAC × x IPAC × M IPAC + M IPA × 1 − x IPAC × c CHS where M CHS, M SBA, M IPA, and M IPAC represent the mole mass of CHS, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, and isopropyl acetate, respectively. w SBA and w IPA+IPAC represent the mass solubility of CHS (form I) in the 2-butanol and 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate system at 288.15 K, and x IPAC reflects the mole fraction of isopropyl acetate. The correlation is shown in the form of a two-dimensional graph, as shown in Fig. (9). Supersaturation and concentration present a linear relationship in the 2-butanol system (Eq. (3)) and is a cluster of straight lines in the binary solvent system (Eq. (4)). Only the two boundary lines of x IPAC = 0.1 and x IPAC = 0.9 are shown, the area between the two lines is the operating space of the binary solvent. Combined with the limitation of the supersaturation range in section 3.2.1 and the concentration range in section 3.2.3 obtained through experiments, the graph will be divided into two main areas. The area above the black line (2-butanol) is defined as the optimal operating space for the spherulitic growth of CHS (form I). Compared with a single solvent, the binary solvent system has an advantage in the optimal operating space. On the one hand, it can maintain a lower concentration under the same supersaturation, thereby reducing the probability of gelation. On the other hand, it can provide higher supersaturation under the same concentration, which improves the driving force of the process and greatly reduces the time of spherulitic growth. This is undoubtedly beneficial to the drug crystallization process. However, the 2-butanol system can only operate on one line (the orange dashed line in Fig. 9). Due to its low operating flexibility, it can be easily accessible to the gelation area when the operating variable fluctuates. The binary solvent system achieves the improvement of the operating space from one-dimensional to two-dimensional. Therefore, on the two-dimensional operating space diagram, it can be found that the binary solvent can meet the spherulitic growth while not gel, and it has been immensely improved compared to the 2-butanol system. After examining the relationship between supersaturation and concentration, the temperature range was introduced to form the three-dimensional operating space of spherulitic growth. By correlating the solubility data with the temperature, the supersaturation surface with temperature and concentration changes was obtained as shown in Fig. 10 . Using the same method as above, the operating space of different solvent systems were obtained, and the part of the binary solvent system above the black curved surface (2-butanol) is defined as the optimal operating space for spherulitic growth. It can be found that the operating space of the binary solvent system is geometry and the 2-butanol system is a curved surface, and the binary solvents are once again showing great advantages in operational flexibility. More importantly, the three-dimensional operating space provides a feasible scheme for the controllable preparation of metastable forms with multi-target regulation problems."
11,Improve the product properties by the spherulitic growth operating space,"3.3 Improve the product properties by the spherulitic growth operating space According to the operating spaces in Fig. 10, the operation lines of spherulitic growth under a single solvent and binary solvent system were designed respectively (Fig. 11 ). In the 2-butanol system, since this is a combination of reactive crystallization and cooling crystallization, and the spherulitic growth requires a high degree of supersaturation, it is necessary to add enough clopidogrel alkali while reacting completely at a higher temperature quickly (point A in Fig. 11). Subsequently, in order to further increase supersaturation for spherulitic growth, the solution is cooled to the set temperature (298.15 K, from point A to point B in Fig. 11). Finally, the crystal seeds are added at point B to induce the crystallization process, and the supersaturation gradually decreases until spherulitic growth completes (from point B to point C in Fig. 11). For the binary solvent system, since the three-dimensional operating space is composed of a certain content of isopropyl acetate curved surface, it is necessary to determine the x IPAC in the spherulitic growth process before drawing the operation line. The proportion of isopropyl acetate can be selected according to Figs. 9 and 10. Taking 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate as an instance, the curved surface of x IPAC = 0.7 was selected in its operating space, then the same steps were followed as the single solvent to draw the operation line, the result is shown in Fig. 11. In order to investigate the advantages of the preparation of CHS (form I) with binary solvent systems, spherulitic growth experiments were carried out following the drawn operation lines in Fig. 11. The comparison of product properties and process efficiency between single solvent system and binary solvent systems is shown in Fig. 12 and Table 1 . In terms of product properties, the spherulites obtained by the binary solvent system exhibit denser branching in Fig. 12, which form relatively compact structure and flat surface. As shown in Table 1, this structure optimization significantly improves the bulk density, the particle size, and the sphericity of the spherulites, which is beneficial for washing, drying, filtration, transportation, storage, and especially direct tableting for the drug [6,40–42]. It is worth noting that the optimization of product structure can significantly reduce the residual solvent, although the binary solvent systems were used. As illustrated in Table 1, compared with the single solvent system, the residual solvent of spherulites prepared by the binary solvent systems decreased by 59%, i.e. from 1560 ppm to 640 ppm, which is a noteworthy advantage. In terms of process efficiency, the operating time of entire crystallization process under the binary solvent schemes decreased by 75%–90%, i.e. from 8 to 10 h to 1–2 h, which is undoubtedly helpful to the production of enterprises. The reason is that binary solvent systems can easily provide larger supersaturation under the premise of no transformation and gelation (i.e. concentration and temperature limits), and the high driving force leads to the rapid spherulitic growth process and greatly shorten the preparation time. The same conclusions are obtained in other binary solvents systems, as shown in Table S3 in the Supporting Information."
12,Conclusions,"This paper solved the multi-target regulation issue of poor powder properties, polymorph transformation, and gelation for CHS (form I) by building spherulitic growth operating spaces in binary solvent systems. Compared with the traditional single solvent design scheme, the binary solvent systems can balance the three requirements of high supersaturation, low temperature, and low concentration to enhance the operating space so that the crystallization process can follow the supersaturation-dependent spherulitic growth mechanism without polymorph transformation or gelation to prepare the high-quality product. In order to achieve this design, four binary solvent systems, i.e. 1-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 2-propanol + isopropyl acetate, 1-butanol + isopropyl acetate, and 2-butanol + isopropyl acetate, were selected for CHS (form I) spherulitic growth process by the two principles, i.e. the difference of solubility and consistency of solvent effect. The experimental results in these solvent systems show that the isosteric adsorption heat is an effective indicator to estimate the solvent effect and the key factor affecting the spherulitic growth process is supersaturation rather than solvent effect. It thus provides a basis for constructing spherulitic growth operating space in terms of supersaturation, concentration, and temperature. Furthermore, the polymorph transformation process and gelation phenomenon of CHS (form I) in the five solvent systems were systematically studied by ATR-FTIR and inverted tube method to determine the boundaries of the parameters and construct spherulitic growth operating space without polymorph transformation or gelation. In this case, a superior preparation process was designed. As a result, the spherulitic growth of the product was enhanced with a denser particle structure, which improves the bulk density, particle size, and sphericity. Particularly, the residual solvent of spherulites decreased by 59%, and the operating time of the entire crystallization process decreased by 75%–90%. This work indicates that the scheme of particle design with binary solvent systems has its unique function of building the operating space, which can solve some multi-target regulation issues to improve powder properties, product stability, and process efficiency."
