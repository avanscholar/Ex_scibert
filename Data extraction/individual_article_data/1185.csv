0,Introduction,"Benzaldehyde is the simplest and most important aromatic aldehyde in chemical industry, since it is widely used as an intermediate in pharmaceutical, perfumery dyestuff and agrochemicals. It is commercially synthesized by hydrolysis of benzalchloride derived from toluene chlorination. However, the contamination of organic chlorine makes it unsatisfactory for the high demanding perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol has been proposed as a promising alternative to produce chlorine-free benzaldehyde. But the oxidation traditionally uses stoichiometric oxidants like chromate or permanganate, which are expensive, corrosive and highly-pollutive [1]. The increasing environmental-consciousness impels development of selective oxidation process by eco-friendly oxidants, including H2O2, air or other molecular oxygen [2–4]. Noble metal and metal oxide are two common catalysts studied for alcohol oxidation. The former is active and usually prepared into nanoparticles dispersed on support to achieve desired performance [5–7]. However, the large-scale utilization is limited due to the low abundance and high cost of noble metals. Metal oxide catalysts, mainly transitional metal oxides, are economic but not as active as the noble metal [8–11]. Their reusability is usually poor. Therefore, it is a challenging task to develop an economic catalyst for benzyl alcohol oxidation efficiently under mild conditions. The zeolite-based mimic framework (zeolitic midazolate frameworks, ZIFs), as a subclass of MOFs(metal organic frameworks), is a type of porous materials with zeolite-like topology, rich carbon and nitrogen ligands, and high metal content. These make it a good candidate as template or precursor to synthesize various porous nanostructured metal (oxides)/carbon and their composites, which have been successfully used as catalysts for a variety of catalytic reactions [12]. For example, Liu etal [13] used ZIF-8-derived carbon (C-ZIF)/g-C3N4 composite as an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cocatalyst to promote photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Yin etal [14] implemented fabrication of composite CoO–MoO2 nanocages from ZIF-67. It can serve as an efficient electrocatalyst with dramatically enhanced activities and high stability toward OER. Cobalt oxide nanocrystals embedded into N-doped graphitic carbon was prepared from carbonization of ZIF-9/GO (graphene oxide) composite by Mondal etal [15]. It achieved excellent catalytic performance for selective aromatic hydrocarbon oxidations. The ZIF-67-derived cobalt@N-doped porous carbon catalyst showed good performance toward CO2 methanation at low temperature, with higher activity and stability than the Co/AC (cobalt supported on activated carbon) catalyst [16]. In addition, this catalyst also exhibit outstanding activity, selectivity and recyclability toward oxidative esterification of alcohol under mild conditions[17]. Similar catalysts, i.e. Co/C–N and Co/C, which were prepared from thermolysis of two cobalt based MOFs, were reported to achieve selective oxidation of a wide range of aryl and alkyl alcohols. Li etal proposed that the presence of N was beneficial for the improvement of basicity and cobalt dispersion, but there is little discussion about the role toward the reaction or the reaction scheme [18]. In this work, ZIF-67 was used as a precursor to synthesize uniformly dispersed cobalt-based catalysts for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by air. The cobalt oxide and Co@CN catalyst were prepared from calcination or pyrolysis of ZIF-67 under air and Ar, respectively. The latter. exhibited good activity, selectivity and recyclability in the reaction. Further studies were performed to illustrate the active species that responsible for the good performances. We expect that the results would provide support in development of non-noble metal-based efficient and environmental-friendly catalyst for the application in benzaldehyde production via oxidation by ambient air."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Synthesis of ZIF-67. In a typical procedure[19], 1.092 g Co(NO3)2•6H2O was dissolved in 30 mL of methanol and then injected into 30 mL of methanol containing 1.232 g of 2-methylimidazole with sonication for 5 min. Then the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The as-obtained purple precipitates were centrifuged and washed with methanol several times and dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 12 h. Synthesis of Co@CN. The synthesized ZIF-67 was pyrolyzed under argon flow in a tubular furnace at temperature range of 600–900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min for 5 h. The products were then denoted as Co@CN-x, where x represents the pyrolysis temperature. The Co@CN-800 was further treated in HF solution for 24 h at room temperature followed by washing with DI water and ethanol, giving the HF-Co@CN. Synthesis of porous CoOx. The cobalt oxide catalyst was prepared by calcination of ZIF-67 in muffle furnace under air at 500 °C (with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min) for 5 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The phase of the samples was determined with an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8, Cu K radiation). The morphology of the samples was measured by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI Quanta 400 FEG) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (FEI Tecnai G2 F20). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out on a thermogravimetric analyzer (Netzsch STA 449 F5). The sample was heated from room temperature to 900 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min under Ar gas flow of 100 mL/min. N2 adsorption-desoaption isotherms were measured by an IQ2 Quantachrome porosimeter after the sample was degassed at 300 °C overnight. The micropore volume was estimated using t-plot method, and the mesopore volume was obtained by subtracting the micropore volume from the total pore volume. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer equipped with an Al K radiation source."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was carried out in a three-necked glass flask under atmospheric pressure. Typically, a 100 mL flask containing 10 mL of DMF (N,N dimethylformamide), 20 μL of benzyl alcohol and 50 mg of catalysts was stirred at 90 °C on a magnetic stirring heater under refluxing and bubbling with air at a flow rate of 140 mL/min. After the reaction, the liquid product was analyzed using amyl alcohol as internal standard on GC (9790Plus) equipped with FFAP column and FID (flame ionization detector)."
5,Results and discussion,"The crystal phase of the as-prepared ZIF-67 and derivatives were determined by wide angle XRD shown in Fig. 1. The characteristic lines in the XRD pattern of ZIF-67 synthesized match well with the simulated ZIF-67 (Fig. 1. (a))[20,21], indicating that the synthesized ZIF-67 of phase-pure with good crystallinity. The cobalt oxide sample (CoOX), which was derived from calcination of ZIF-67 in air, shows diffraction lines located at 2θ value of 19.0°, 31.3°, 36.9°, 44.9°, 59.5° and 65.2°, corresponding to Co3O4 (standard JCPDS card no. 00-042-1467) [22]. However, the diffraction lines appeared in the XRD pattern of Co@CN-800, which was obtained by pyrolysis of ZIF-67 in Ar flow, demonstrate the presence of graphic carbon (the weak and broad peak at 26°), metallic β-Co with a face-centered cubic structure, for the strong lines at 44.2°, 51.5° and 75.9° (standard JCPDS card no. 00-015-0806) [23]. There are also weak lines at 2θ value of 36.7° and 42.5° assigned to CoO (standard JCPDS card no. 00-071-1178), but no Co3O4 species was detected. The Co@CN pyrolyzed at lower temperature (600 and 700 °C) exhibit less intense lines attributed to Co and CoO species, but no line assignable to graphic carbon. With increasing pyrolysis temperature, the diffraction lines become much stronger (Fig.S1). It is possible that the formation of CoO is dependent on the pyrolysis condition rather than the exposure to air [24,25]. According to Das et al. [26], the reduction potential is crucial for the formation of resultant products derived from MOFs. The metal ions with a reduction potential of −0.27 V or higher usually form pure metal nanoparticles during pyrolysis under inert atmosphere, whereas those with reduction potential lower than −0.27 V produce corresponding metal oxide nanoparticles upon pyrolysis. As for Co with reduction potential of −0.28 V, which is very close to the border potential, it is possible to produce Co and CoO species simultaneously. After HF etching, the broad peak at around 26° assigned to (002) diffraction of graphitic carbon become more dominant, but the sharp lines assigned to metallic Co significantly weakened, suggesting the destruction of Co crystal by HF treatment. Fig. 2 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples. Based on IUPAC classification, it can be clearly observed that ZIF-67 exhibited type-I isotherm feature. The derivatives, including the cobalt oxide, Co@CN pyrolyzed at different temperature (Fig. S2) and the HF etched sample, unexceptionally display a typical type-Ⅳ feature with an obvious H4 hysteresis loop at the relative pressure of 0.4–1.0, indicating the existence of mesoporous structure. The specific surface area and pore volume data are summarized in Table 1. ZIF-67 have a high BET specific surface area of 2211.2 m2/g and substantial pore volume of 0.9549 mL/g, dominated by micropore of 0.7690 mL/g, which is consistent with the behavior of adsorption-desorption isotherm. The cobalt oxide has poor surface area of 6.781 m2/g and pore volume of 0.035 mL/g, as the micropore structure of ZIF-67 crystal was totally destroyed. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the BET surface area firstly increase and then decrease. The lower surface area of Co@CN-600 should be resulted from the messy distribution of the component after collapse of ZIF-67 crystal structure, as well as the low content of porous carbon, as the carbonization degree is insufficient at this temperature. When the temperature increases, there is a gradual formation of regular porous carbon with increasing degree of carbonization. The Co@CN-800 possesses the highest BET surface area of 326.8 m2/g and pore volume of 0.328 mL/g among the pyrolyzed samples. But the surface decreased again possibly due to the significanly increased particle size of cobalt crystal at 900 oC. With etching of Co@CN-800 with HF, the surface area increased from 326.8 m2/g to 534.9 m2/g, along with the increasing pore volume, in virtue of creation of pores by HF etching. The results listed in Table 1 also showed that the cobalt content of ZIF-67 and CoOx analyzed by ICP-MS was 26.2% and 72.4%, close to the calculated value based on the molecular formula of ZIF-67 and Co3O4. While the content in Co@CN sample is 36.1% and 39.8% as determined by ICP-MS and TG analysis respectively. The lower value determined by the former technique was possibly due to the fact that a small part of the cobalt species, closely wrapped by the carbon formed by pyrolysis, was inaccessible to HF during the pretreatment before ICP-MS measurement. The Co content of the HF etching sample was determined as 4.0% by TG analysis, confirming that some cobalt species was protected from HF etching. Fig. 3 shows SEM images of ZIF-67, Co@CN, HF-Co@CN and CoOx. The as-prepared ZIF-67 crystals show a typical dodecahedral shape with a smooth surface. The particles of Co@CN roughly maintain their original rhombic dodecahedral shape, but the particle faces are rough, possibly due to the loss of organic components during pyrolysis. The material obtained by HF acid etching retains the morphology and particle size of Co@CN, but the surface become more concave and rough, owing to the generation of pores upon HF etching. However, after calcination in air, the original dodecahedron collapsed, turned into small particles gathered together. O2-TPD tests were performed over the three catalysts, CoOx, Co@CN-800 and HF-Co@CN-800, in order to investigate the activation and evolution of oxygen. As shown in Fig. 4, only one peak could be found in the profile of cobalt oxide. The strong and sharp peak located at around 850 °C could be assigned to the bulk lattice oxygen of Co3O4 [27]. However, the Co@CN-800 exhibited two desorption peaks at lower temperature, i.e., a sharp one at 488 °C with a shoulder at 526 °C. The two peaks should attributed to different surface chemisorbed oxygen species, possibly O2-, O2 2- [27,28]. The fact demonstrated that the Co@CN catalyst owned more active surface oxygen species than CoOx, so the former was more active in activation of oxygen. After HF etching, the amount of the active surface oxygen species decreased, as indicated by the weaker desorption peak in the profile of HF-Co@CN. The XPS spectra of the CoOx, Co@CN and HF etching Co@CN materials are shown in Fig. 5. The Co 2p XPS spectra of all samples present two major peaks at approximately 795 and 780 eV, corresponding to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 levels. To further analyze the surface composition of different cobalt species, the spectra were deconvoluted. The Co 2p3/2 peak can be deconvoluted into components at 779.6 eV (Co3+), 780.9 eV (Co2+), 782.2 eV (Co2+) for the cobalt oxide sample [29–31]. But for the Co@CN and HF etched sample, Co3+ species was not found, as the corresponding subpeak was absent in the spectra. An additional subpeak at 778.5 eV could be attributed to the presence of metallic cobalt (Co°). The other two distinct peaks at 780.4 eV (Co2+) and 782.5 eV (Co2+) was suggested to be Co ion bonded with carbon, and with nitrogen respectively [32,33]. The HF etching removed a large part of the cobalt sites, so the intensity of the Co2p peak decreased, consistent with the results demonstrated by XRD. In addition to the decreased amount, the fraction of the surface Co0 species decreased from 21% to 18%. The distinct satellite feature is observed above 785 eV for all the sample. In the N1s region (Fig. 5c), three distinct subpeaks are observed, with electron binding energy of 398.6, 399.8 and 401.1 eV. The binding energy peak at 398.6 eV can be attributed to pyridinic nitrogen, refers to the nitrogen atom that replaces one carbon atom in benzene ring. The peak at 399.8 eV is characteristic for pyrrole nitrogen that contribute two electrons to the large π bond of C5 ring in carbon matrix. The third peak at 401.1 eV refers mainly to graphitic nitrogen, which is incorporated into the graphene layer [34,35]. The graphic nitrogen species is determined as the most abundant nitrogen species, with a content of 46% and 55% for the Co@CN-800 and HF-Co@CN-800. After HF etching, the content of pyrrole nitrogen decreased from 31% to 12%. As shown in the O1s spectrum of cobalt oxide, two distinct peaks with binding energy of 529.6 and 531.2 eV could be recognized as the characteristic lattice oxygen atoms in Co3O4 and adsorbed oxygen atoms in surface hydroxyl groups. A shift of O1s toward the direction of higher binding energy were observed for Co@CN and HF-Co@CN. The broad O1s peak of the two samples can be deconvoluted into two subpeaks with binding energy of ~531.6 eV and ~533.3 eV, possibly be assigned to the adsorbed oxygen atom and oxygen in C-O, respectively [9,17,36]. The observations suggested that some of the Co atoms on the surface could have some interaction with the nitrogen or carbon atoms surrounding the Co nanoparticles. Fig. 6. Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was conducted in liquid phase by flowing of air. The main byproduct over these catalysts were unexceptionally benzoic acid. The influence of reaction temperature was much greater than the air flow rate (Fig. S3 and Fig. S4). Despite of the high conversion (>95%) at elevated temperature of 120 °C, the selectivity was as low as 53% on Co@CN-800 catalyst. At a temperature of 90 °C, the conversion of benzyl alcohol over ZIF-67 was moderate, with a value of 45% and benzaldehyde selectivity of 71%. The pyrolyzed samples Co@CN-x showed better activity. The conversion increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 600 to 900 °C (Fig. S5). The Co@CN-x also exhibit higher selectivity than ZIF-67, except for the Co@CN-900. The Co@CN-800 gave conversion and selectivity of 78% and 94% respectively. However, the thermal treatment in air, which resulted in the formation of Co3O4, led to lower selectivity to benzaldehyde. The HF etched catalyst exhibited approximately 18% of conversion despite of its high specific surface area, and high selectivity of 99%. The significant decrease of the activity was resulted from the removal of cobalt sites, especially the metallic cobalt, as indicated by the differences in the XRD patterns. So it was speculated that the metallic cobalt was active toward the effective conversion of benzyl alcohol over Co@CN. Hot filtration experiment was further performed over Co@CN-800 to test whether there was any leaching of cobalt during the reaction. The curve in Fig.S6 shows that conversion of benzyl alcohol increased sharply from 0% to approximately 75% during the first 3 h’ reaction, and then small increase is observed with further increasing time on stream. The results demonstrated that no further products was formed after filtration at 1 h and the reaction continues for another 9 h. This suggested that the leaching of metal was negligible and the process was heterogeneous. An analysis with ICP-MS confirmed that there was no cobalt ion in the reaction solution (<1 ×10-3 μg/mL). To further test the reusability of Co@CN, the catalyst was repeatedly separated from the reaction solution via magnet and centrifugation, followed by immersed in ethanol for 24 h to remove impurities after one cycle of reaction. The results shown in Fig. 7(d) demonstrated that the Co@CN-800 maintain considerable conversion and selectivity even after 5 cycles, indicating the good recyclability of the catalyst. Processing ZIF-67 with different methods or conditions resulted in obviously different forms of species in corresponding materials. During the calcination in air, there is an evolution of carbon due to combustion along with the collapse of ZIF-67 crystal, leading to the formation of small Co3O4 particles, with coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+ bonded with oxygen over the surface. Conversion of the reactant over CoOX was proceeded via activation of oxygen molecules by oxygen vacancy of the cobalt oxide. Meanwhile, adsorption of benzyl alcohol over cobalt ion allowed electrons transferred to the latter, yielding benzyl aldehyde by reaction between negatively charged oxygen and the positively charged benzyl alcohol [36]. Comparatively, the coordination environment of cobalt species were more complexed in the pyrolyzed catalyst Co@CN. In addition to the metallic cobalt, there were cobalt species coordinated to oxygen, carbon and nitrogen. The cobalt species of the HF etched sample was the same, but the low activity should be largely attributed to the decreased cobalt sites, indicating that the cobalt species was the main active sites. The HF-Co@CN still possessed some activity (higher than 4.9% of blank test). The nitrogen species was also supposed to be effective for the conversion. Arai and Wang reported that the metal-free nitrogen-containing active carbons showed some activity toward oxidation of alcohols including benzyl alcohol [37,38]. But the role of different N species is still controversial. Some believed that the presence of different N species could all tune the electronic and geometric properties of carbon, providing more active sites for the improvement of catalytic activity [39]. Some suggested the significance of graphite-type nitrogen species for their catalysis in the oxidation of alcohols. It was also assumed that the presence of pyridine-type nitrogen species gave a Lewis base nature to the neighboring carbon atoms, and these carbon sites were more effective for the activation of the substrate [40,41]. In order to gain insights into the evolution of active sites of Co@CN, the surface information of the used Co@CN-800 was analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 7. The deconvoluted results were summarized in Table 2. It showed that the amount of metallic cobalt decreased with increasing reaction time, meanwhile, the Co2+ species with binding energy of 780.4 eV increased. Furthermore, an analysis of the O1s spectra demonstrated that the content of oxygen species bonded with carbon (533.3 eV) decreased, along with the increasing oxygen bonded with cobalt (529.3 eV) and adsorbed oxygen atom (531.5 eV). These facts suggested that the metallic cobalt was possibly oxidized during the reaction, being transformed into Co2+ that is bonded with oxygen, and more adsorbed oxygen species were accumulated over the surface. As we have discussed, the metallic cobalt possesses good activity toward conversion of benzyl alcohol. After being continuously recycled for 4 times, the catalyst still showed good activity and selectivity in the 5th cycle, slight decrease in benzyl alcohol conversion was found (Fig. 7(d)), despite of the consumption of the Co0 species. These results suggested that either the metallic cobalt or the Co2+ species was active toward benzyl alcohol conversion. An obvious change of the N1s spectra was also observed. According to the data in Table 2, the relative content of pyridinic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen decreased with prolonged reaction time, meanwhile, the content of pyrrole nitrogen increased. But the conversion and selectivity were barely influenced by the change. So it was assumed that these different nitrogen species could effectively enhance the catalytic activity, by tuning the electronic and geometric properties of cobalt ion or carbon."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, we have synthesized cobalt based heterogeneous catalysts from ZIF-67 as a precursor in the present work. The Co@CN catalyst, obtained from pyrolysis of ZIF-67 in Ar, showed the best activity and selectivity toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In addition, it can be easily separated from the reaction mixture, and exhibited good recyclability. The acid leaching sample exhibited poor activity. Furthermore, an evolution of the cobalt species demonstrated by XPS suggested that efficient conversion over Co@CN catalyst was mainly associated with the cobalt sites, and either metallic cobalt or cobalt ion was active toward the conversion. The nitrogen species, including the pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen, were all supposed to be effective in promoting the conversion of benzyl alcohol."
