0,Introduction,"Organic pollutants are difficult to be naturally degraded by the environment, and can potentially cause harm to humans through bioaccumulation [1–3]. Among the various organic pollutants, tetracycline (TC), the second most produced and consumed pharmaceutical antibiotic in the world, and is widely used in medicine and animal husbandry [4,5]. Currently, owe to the severe abuse and high stability of antibiotics, they can easily accumulate to high levels in the environment [6,7]. This may lead to the generation of drug-resistant bacteria and disrupt the harmony of microbiota in the aquatic environment, thus further threatening ecosystems and human health [8,9]. Therefore, effective control of water quality degradation caused by TC has become a priority for researchers to attack. It is well known that the traditional technologies, such as filtration [10], adsorption [11] and other oxidation forms [12,13], are no longer suitable for the current sewage environment due to low efficiency, high cost, and complex processes [14]. Promisingly, in the past decade, the semiconductor photocatalysis technique has appeared enormous superiority in the removal of organic pollutants with its advantages of cut-price, environment-friendly and high efficiency [15–17]. However, in traditional catalysts (such as TiO2), the limited photo-response range and the easily recombined photogenerated electron (e-) and hole (h+) pairs have become the bottleneck in the development of photocatalysts [18,19]. Thence, it is necessary to explore an effective and stable semiconductor material that can be excited by visible light. Bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) has received great attention because of its suitable band gap (2.97 eV, this work) and high stability, and is considered to be the most prospering photocatalytic material for degrading water pollutants [20]. However, the narrow visible light absorption range, low carrier separation efficiency and limited reduction ability still hinder the development of single Bi2WO6. In particular, the reduction potential of the Bi2WO6(CB = −0.17 eV, this work) conduction band (CB) is lower than the potential for generation of superoxide radicals (O2/•O2 – = −0.33 eV), which are one of the essential active substances for the degradation of pollutants [14,21]. To overcome these weaknesses, the current research mainly concentrated on two aspects: 1) atomic doping and morphology control. Ning et al. [22] synthesized GO/TiO2/Bi2WO6 nanocomposite to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Zhang et al. [23] proved I–-doped Bi2WO6 composites can reduce the potential energy of the conduction band. Wang et al. [24] constructed a new atomic-level g-C3N4/Bi2WO6 heterojunction with high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency; 2) construction of heterojunction. Conventional type I and type III heterojunctions are eliminated because electrons and holes are accumulated in the same semiconductor, which is not conducive to the progress of photocatalysis [25]. In addition, the accumulation of e- and h+ at low reduction and oxidation potentials, respectively, leads to a reduction in the redox capacity of type II and p-n heterojunctions [26]. Differently, the Z-scheme heterojunction is a composite material formed from two highly compatible semiconductor. Electrons can be smoothly transferred from the CB of one semiconductor to the valence band (VB) of the other semiconductor, thus retaining more negative CB potential and higher VB potential, a structure that allows for effective charge separation and produces high redox capacity [27,28]. Extensive work has also demonstrated the feasibility of combining Bi2WO6 with different compounds to form a Z-scheme heterojunction: i) metal (bimetal) oxide: Bi2WO6/MnO2 [29], Bi2WO6/ZnO [30], Bi2WO6/CuBi2O4 [14], Bi2WO6/WO3 [31], Bi2Fe4O9/Bi2WO6 [21], SnNb2O6/Bi2WO6 [8], Ag2O/Bi2WO6 [32]; ii) halide: AgBr/Bi2WO6 [26], γ-AgI/Bi2WO6 [33], BiOBr/Bi2WO6 [34]; iii) non-metallic photocatalysts: g-C3N4/Bi2WO6 [35], PW12/CN@Bi2WO6 [20], g-C3Nx/Bi2WO6 [36]. Among these strategies, Z-type heterojunctions with effective photogenerated charge separation can be fabricated only by combining Bi2WO6 with a semiconductor material having an appropriate bandgap potential. Furthermore, the potential difference created by the intimate heterogeneous interfacial contact between two semiconductors is critical for electron transfer [37]. Particularly, chemical bonds formed by surface groups between heterojunctions can increase electron transfer channels and further improve photocatalytic activity [8,38]. Cu2(OH)3F is a suitable semiconductor material with a high CB potential (CB = 0.64 eV, this work). Especially, the great amount of —OH bonds can be adsorbed on the surface of Bi2WO6 in the alkaline hydrothermal process, and these —OH and W—O groups can further linked to the —OH on the surface of the candidate semiconductor through hydrogen bands [8]. Compared with other materials that rely on adsorption to obtain —OH groups, Cu2(OH)3F can provide more abundant —OH groups to facilitate the linkage between heterogeneous. This is equivalent to forming a channel that is beneficial to the charge transfer between Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6. In consequence, the construction of Z-scheme heterojunction by Cu2(OH)3F nanosheets modified Bi2WO6 is an ideal mode to strengthen the catalytic performance of the photocatalysts. In this study, a Z-scheme Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6(CFO/BWO) heterojunction with intimate hetero-surface contacts was prepared via a two-step hydrothermal method of decorating Cu2(OH)3F nanosheets on Bi2WO6. The crystal structure and morphology of the photocatalysts were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The hetero-surface hydrogen bonds were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman spectra. In addition, optical properties are measured by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra and electrochemistry tests. As expected, the as-prepared Z-scheme CFO/BWO heterojunctions showed excellent degradation activity towards tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) in photocatalytic experiments with outstanding cyclability and superior stability. Furthermore, free radical quenching experiment was performed to determine the reactive species in this system. A possible path of interface charge transfer in the Z-Scheme CFO/BWO heterojunction and the mechanism of TC-HCl photodegradation during the reaction was also inferred and discussed."

4,Preparation of Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6,"2.3 Preparation of Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6 Preparation of Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6 heterojunction by direct in-situ hydrothermal deposition of Cu2(OH)3F on the surface of Bi2WO6 microspheres (Scheme 1 ). Typically, a certain proportion of Bi2WO6 and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were added in 50 ml deionized water and ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. Then C6H12O6 was added and stirred for 10 min. Adjusted the pH of the mixed solution to 7 ~ 8 with ammonia. Immediately following, NaF was added to the mixed solution and stirring was continued for 10 min. Next, the mixture was poured into an 80 ml autoclave and placed at 105 °C for 3 h. The precipitate was received through the same post-processing steps as above. The Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions with different deposition ratios of Cu2(OH)3F to Bi2WO6 were marked as 15 %CFO/BWO, 25%CFO/BWO, 35 %CFO/BWO, 45 %CFO/BWO, respectively. Pure Cu2(OH)3F was synthesized under the same operating procedures."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The crystalline phase of the samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and measured on a Panalytical X′ Pert Pro Netherlands diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (=0.15408 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM 6700F) with the energy-disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAIG2F20-S-TWIN, USA FEI) to obtain the morphology and microstructure of the catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was collected on a Thermo ESCALAB250XI spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα radiation to identify the surface elemental composition and chemical state of the prepared samples. Using an UV–vis–near-IR spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 5000, USA) to analyze the photo-capture performance of all samples. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded on the Nicolet Is50 spectrometer. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a spectrometer (Lab RAM HR Evolution) with an argon laser excitation primary at 532 nm. The intermediates of TC-HCl degradation were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS, Thermo Scientific, US). Electrochemical measurements including the Mott-Schottky plots and the transient photocurrent response were implemented on a photoelectrochemical analysis (CHI-660E, Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai, China). Detailed performance methods are recorded in the Supplemental material."
6,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.5 Photocatalytic activity test The photocatalytic performance of Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6 was evaluated through degrading TC-HCl in an aqueous solution under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp (300 W) armed with a cut filter (λ > 400 nm). Specifically, the catalyst (10 mg) was added to 50 ml TC-HCl (20 mg/L) solution and the mixture was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to achieve adsorption/desorption equilibrium. 3 ml aliquots were withdrawn from the mixed system every 10 min intervals and filtered instantly. Lastly, the concentration of TC was analyzed using a UV–Vis spectrometer at 500 nm."
7,Results and discussion,
8,XRD and FT-IR analysis,"3.1 XRD and FT-IR analysis Fig. 1 a displayed XRD patterns of pure Bi2WO6 and CFO/BWO composites with different designated depositing amounts of Cu2(OH)3F. All diffraction peaks of single Bi2WO6 and Cu2(OH)3F are consistent with JCPD:39–0256 and JCPD:16–0763, demonstrating that the two compounds with high purity were successfully prepared. With the increase of the amount of Cu2(OH)3F deposition, there is no obvious change in the shape of the diffraction peak of Bi2WO6, and the diffraction peak of Cu2(OH)3F can be more clearly observed, denoting that the presence of Cu2(OH)3F has not changed the crystal structure of Bi2WO6 and two compounds well coexist in the CFO/BWO system. The diffraction peak position of Bi2WO6 shifted slightly toward higher values (Fig. 1b), implying strong interaction between Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6. Attentively, the diffraction peaks of Cu2(OH)3F in all materials are generally weak, which can be ascribed to the high dispersion of Cu2(OH)3F in the CFO/BWO composites. The FTIR spectroscopy technique is used to provide detailed information about the functional groups of the prepared materials. As shown in Fig. 1c, for pure Bi2WO6, the peaks at 572 and 739 cm−1 are belonged to the stretching vibrations of Bi-O and W-O, respectively [39]. The bands below 768 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibration mode of the copper bond for pure Cu2(OH)3F [40,41]. Obviously, it can be further observed that the principal peaks of Bi2WO6 and Cu2(OH)3F in the spectra of a series of CFO/BWO composites. In addition, the intensity of the Cu2(OH)3F diffraction peak can be detected to become progressively stronger with the increase of the deposited amount, which illustrates the successful fabrication of the heterojunction. More importantly, the absorption bands at 3455 cm−1 are from the stretching vibrations and bending of the O-H groups in crystal structure and surface adsorption [38]. Hydrogen bonds may appear at 3400–3500 cm−1 [42]. This provides a foundation for hydrogen bonding to increase the electron transfer pathway at the heterogeneous interface."
9,Morphology analysis,"3.2 Morphology analysis SEM, TEM, and HRTEM were introduced to investigate the tight interfacial heterostructures formed between Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6. The morphology structures of pure Bi2WO6, Cu2(OH)3F and 25%CFO/BWO composites were revealed in Fig. 2 . Single Bi2WO6 exhibits an about 3 µm hierarchical spherical structure self-stacking through numerous nanoflakes (Fig. 2a and f). Pure Cu2(OH)3F appears as stacked fiat blocks with a length of about 50 nm to 150 nm (Fig. 2b and g). In 25%CFO/WBO heterojunctions (Fig. 2c and h), it can be observed that the smaller Cu2(OH)3F nanosheets can be generated in the gaps of the flower-like structure of Bi2WO6, while the larger Cu2(OH)3F particles are dispersedly attached to the surface and edge of the Bi2WO6. Specially, the original spherical structure is still maintained. Fig. 2d-e confirm that the 25%CFO/WBO sample consists of uniformly distributed Bi, W, O, Cu and F elements. Furthermore, the corresponding magnified HRTEM image in selected area (Fig. 2i) distinctly reveals different lattice fringes of 0.310 nm and 0.270 nm corresponding to the (200) plane of Cu2(OH)3F and (002) plane of Bi2WO6, respectively. The above results indicate that an intimate heterogeneous contact is formed between Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6, and can greatly facilitate the transfer of photogenerated carriers."
10,XPS and Raman analysis,"3.3 XPS and Raman analysis XPS spectroscopy can be used to further measure the composition and state of the surface elements in the heterojunctions. In the survey XPS spectra in Fig. S1, the peaks corresponding to the elements contained in Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6, respectively, and the 25%CFO/BWO heterojunction shows peaks corresponding to the elements of Bi, W, O, Cu, F and O, demonstrating that the heterojunction was comprised of Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6. Which extremely consistent with the results of XRD and EDS analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the doublet peaks of the spin-orbital splitting are centered at approximate 159.02 and 164.33 eV corresponding to the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively [43]. In 25%CFO/BWO heterojunction, the Bi 4f signals shift to the higher binding energies (159.22 and 164.56 eV). In Fig. 3b, the peaks at 35.23 and 37.14 eV correspond to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, respectively [44]. Besides, W 4f peaks appeared a positive shift after forming a heterojunction with Cu2(OH)3F (35.54 and 37.44 eV). The Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 spin orbitals were situated at binding energies of 955.22 and 935.12 eV in Fig. 3c. Two satellite peaks at 943.27 and 962.71 eV were ascribed to d9 configuration of Cu2+ [45]. On the contrary, the binding energies of Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 in 25%CFO/BWO heterojunction shift negatively in comparison with pure Cu2(OH)3F (954.18 and 934.23 eV). Similarly, after the decoration of Cu2(OH)3F on Bi2WO6, binding energies of F1s (Fig. 3d) for 25%CFO/BWO heterojunction (683.39 and 685.10 eV) shift to lower energy region compared to those of Cu2(OH)3F (683.48 and 685.54 eV). The shifted of binding energies be resulted from a strong interfacial interaction between these two components in the 25%CFO/BWO heterojunctions [46,47]. Through previous reports [36], the reduction in electron density on Bi2WO6 in 25%CFO/BWO heterojunction means that electrons can migrate from the Bi2WO6 surface to the Cu2(OH)3F surface, and the holes on the valence band (VB) of Bi2WO6 are left to improve the photocatalytic activity. Additionally, the peaks at 531.30 and 532.32 eV are ascribed to the lattice oxygen and O-H bands of Cu2(OH)3F [48], the formation of Bi-O and W-O leads to the appearance of characteristic peak at 530.38 and 531.57 eV [49] (Fig. 3e). Attentively, the intensity of the binding energy peak of the 25% CFO/BWO heterojunction changes significantly compared to that of the individual Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6. The intensity ratio of Bi-O: W-O in O1s XPS spectra of 25%CFO/BWO homojunction is 4.0, which is higher than pure Bi2WO6 (1.6). Instead, the intensity ratio of lattice oxygen: O-H bands in O1s XPS spectra of 25%CFO/BWO homojunction is 2.9, which lower than pure Cu2(OH)3F (7.7). Meanwhile, as illustrated in Raman spectrum (Fig. 3f), the peaks of 25%CFO/BWO were broader and the vibration peaks shifted to lower energies compared to Bi2WO6. Above result indicates that the hydrogen bonds formed in the 25%CFO/BWO homojunction to enhance the interface interaction, thereby improving the transfer and separation efficiency of charge carriers, and further heighten the photocatalytic activity [50,51]."
11,Optical and photoelectrochemical properties,"3.4 Optical and photoelectrochemical properties The UV–vis spectra were implemented to reveal enhanced photocatalytic properties and charge transfer capabilities of the as-synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. 4 a. The absorption band thresholds of Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 are about 445 and 435 nm, respectively. Obviously, the composited material has a depth-enhanced photo-absorption response and a red shift of the absorption edge. In addition, we also compared the effect of simple physical mixing on the absorbance of the composites. Fig. S2 showed that the light absorption response of the mixed materials was almost the identical range as that of bare Bi2WO6. In summary, the red shift of the prepared heterojunction can be attributed to the SPR effect of Cu in the CFO/BWO composites and leads to enhanced light absorption in the range of 400–550 nm [52]. In addition, the heterogeneous interfacial hydrogen bonding that allows electronic interactions between the two components leading to an extended absorption edge [53]. The stacking pattern and residual groups (amino groups) of the complexes during the secondary hydrothermal process also result in the occurrence of red shift [54]. These results indicate that CFO/BEWO can employ more visible light to generate photogenerated electrons and holes, the property is especially essential for the improvement of photocatalytic activity. I-t curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are used for analyzing the transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. As exhibited in Fig. 4b, the original Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 executed poor photocurrent responses, implying the easier reorganized of photoinduced electrons and holes. The difference is that the 25%CFO/WBO heterojunction has a stronger photocurrent response than the pure samples, suggesting that 25%CFO/WBO heterojunction can boost photocurrent density and accelerated the migration of charge carriers. As far as we know, a smaller arc radius will reduce the resistance to charge transfer, resulting in a more effective separation of carrier [55]. 25%CFO/BWO heterojunction has the smallest arc (Fig. 4c), indicating that the “bridge” formed by hydrogen bonding between Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 facilitates the rapid charge transfer. The above conclusions are consistent with the transient photocurrent response results. As depicted in Fig. 4d, the band gap by plots of Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 were calculated through the Tauc-plot method to be about 3.17 and 2.97 eV, respectively [26,56,57]. Moreover, the calculation of the band gap energy of the composites reveals that the band gap energy of the composites is slightly lower compared to that of pure Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 (Fig. S3a). This indicates that the heterojunctions are more easily excited by visible light, thereby improving the utilization of visible light [20]. As displayed in Fig. 4e-f, the positive slope of the potential curve indicates the n-type characteristics of the semiconductor, the flat band potentials of Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 are estimated at −0.74 and −0.13 eV (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively, corresponding to −0.54 and +0.07 eV (vs. NHE). The CB for many n-type semiconductors is usually considered to 0–0.2 eV more negative than the flat band potential [35,56]. Therefore, the CB potentials of Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 are evaluated to be −0.64 and −0.17 eV (potential difference = 0.1 eV). Based on the above results, the valence band (VB) edges of Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 can be determined to be 2.53 and 2.80 eV. After the same calculation process, the results show that the CB potential of all composite materials has the ability to generate •O2 − (Fig. S3b-c)."
12,Photocatalytic activity evaluation,"3.5 Photocatalytic activity evaluation 3.5.1 Photocatalytic degradation of TC The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was evaluated by degrading TC-HCl under visible light. As shown in Fig. 5 a, bare Cu2(OH)3F has an excellent adsorption capacity due to its abundant oxygen-containing groups, and the adsorption capacity of CFO/BWO increases dramatically with the addition of Cu2(OH)3F compared to Bi2WO6, and all samples remained stable after 30 min of adsorption. The lower TC-HCl degradation efficiency in the reaction system of Bi2WO6, Cu2(OH)3F which consistent with their poor visible-light response capability and separation efficiency of photogenerated charge. On the contrary, CFO/WBO heterojunctions exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the pure catalysts. Initially, the photocatalytic activity of CFO/WBO heterojunctions was proportional to the content of Cu2(OH)3F. The degradability of the composites was strongest when the Cu2(OH)3F content reached 25%, and the removal efficiency towards TC attained about 91% after 60 min irradiation. Further increasing the content of Cu2(OH)3F showed an inhibitory trend, this may be attributed to the fact that the excess Cu2(OH)3F nanoplates create a light-shielding effect that is detrimental to the absorption of visible light by Bi2WO6 and limit the light entry into the reaction system, thus reducing the production of reactive radicals [21]. In addition, the excess Cu2(OH)3F may act as a complex center for photogenerated carriers resulting in low separation efficiency [58]. Correspondingly, the characteristic absorption peak of TC-HCl (Fig. 5b) became weaker with the reaction time, indicating that TC-HCl is gradually degraded by 25%CFO/BWO. The eminently enhanced degradability of 25% CFO/WBO could be ascribed to that the optimal Cu2(OH)3F content advanced the most favorable separation and transfer of photo-generated charges. Moreover, the degradation rate constant of all the photocatalysts is selected to investigate the reaction dynamics of the TC-HCl photodecomposition process [46]: l n ( C o / C t ) = K t where K denotes the pseudo-first-order rate constant, Co and Ct represent the initial concentration and the concentration at time t of TC-HCl solution, respectively. Fig. 5c clearly illustrated that all curves conformed to the first-order reaction kinetics. The specific data of reaction rate constant k of whole catalyst was provided by Fig. 5d and in the order of 25%CFO/WBO > 15 %CFO/WBO > 35 %CFO/WBO > 45 %CFO/WBO > Bi2WO6 > Cu2(OH)3F. The remarkable improvement in photocatalytic performance results from the hydrogen-bonded Z-scheme heterojunction, leading to an increase in carrier concentration and electron transfer channels. More importantly, considering that the degree of absorption of visible light by the catalyst affects its catalytic performance, the degradation ability of the catalyst in different wavelength ranges was examined using a series of monochromatic filters. As revealed in Fig. S4a, 25%CFOBWO exhibited the best degradation ability for TC-HCl at λ = 400 nm, and the weakest at λ = 500 nm. Fig. S4b showed the relationship between the degradation rate of 25%CFO/BWO at different wavelength and the UV–vis absorption spectrum. It can be observed that the catalytic performance of 25%CFO/BWO is correlated with its light-trapping ability in this wavelength. Interestingly, the significant light absorption ability of Cu2(OH)3F in the near-red region allows 25%CFO/BWO to maintain a positive degradation effect in this region. Referring to previously reported calculations [59], the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 25%CFO/BWO was calculated to be 0.65% at λ = 400 nm (Fig. S5), and the AQE in all wavelength regions can approximately match the light absorption behavior (the quantum efficiency was still maintained at the end due to absorbance enhancement). Few AQEs have been reported by the literature for TC degradation on photocatalysts, and our 25% CFO/ BWO photocatalyst outperforms the CoO/BiVO4 p-n heterojunction, where an AQE of 0.54% was reported [60]. Hence, these results suggest that 25%CFO/BWO can serve as a promising and efficient photocatalyst. To study the degradation process and by-products of TC, the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MC) was employed to detect the intermediates of 25% CFO/BWO composites conversion in the photocatalytic system. The initial mass spectra of TC-HCl (Fig. S6) revealed a prominent peak at m/z = 445 from the protonated tetracycline molecule. The weakening of the peak with the increase of reaction time and the generation of several new peaks, indicating that TC-HCl has been gradually degraded into smaller molecules with simpler structures and further decomposed into CO2 and H2O, etc. After analysis of a series of intermediates revealed by the mass spectra, two possible TC degradation pathways were proposed (Fig. 6 ). Pathway I: P1 was first formed by TC demethylation, further converted to P2 by deamidation, and then decomposed into P3 by a ring opening reaction. Pathway II: TC is converted to P4 by hydroxyl rearrangement. Subsequently, P4 was fragmented into P5 (by dealkylation), P6 (by dehydration and hydroxylation) [61]. P6 was transferred to P7 by breaking the N-C bond and conducting the hydroxyl substitution reaction [62]. Then, P7 was converted into other intermediates by ring opening and deacidification (m/z = 217, 261, 305). As the photocatalytic reaction proceeds, the aforementioned intermediates are further fragmented into smaller molecules, which are eventually oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Importantly, the mineralization capacity of 25%CFO/BWO was investigated by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis (Fig. S7). The obtained result shows a mineralization rate of 64% for TC in 60 min for 25%CFO/BWO composites. Clearly, the photodegradation efficiency is higher than the mineralization efficiency, which corresponds reasonably well to the production of the intermediates described above. Moreover, the pH of the degradation system gradually decreased as the reaction proceeded, which is related to the presence of CO2 and nitric acid in the final degradation product. 3.5.2 Stability of CFO/BWO The stability of the catalyst is considered as a criterion to evaluate whether the catalysts achieve low energy consumption and avoid secondary pollution in practical application. The recycling tests for the photodegradation of TC-HCl were performed under visible light. The degradation rate of TC-HCl over the fresh samples was about 91% after 60 min irradiation Fig. 7 a. The efficiency still maintained at 79% after five recycles. The slight decrease in photodegradation efficiency (~12%) can be explained by the loss of catalyst and minor damage to the surface structure during the recirculation reaction. The XRD patterns and SEM images of the catalysts in Fig. 7c-d show that the surface morphology and chemical composition of the samples did not change significantly after cycling, implying that the constructed CFO/BWO heterojunction is less susceptible to photo-corrosion during the reaction. On the basis of the above results, it can be concluded that CFO/BWO heterojunctions with high reusability and practicality have enormous potential in the field of water treatment. 3.5.3 Comparison with other Bi2WO6 based Z-Scheme heterojunctions In recent years, many scholars have constructed a large number of Bi2WO6-based heterojunctions to degrade organic pollutants. As shown in Table S1, most Bi2WO6-based heterojunctions can degrade high concentrations of TC-HCl in a short time with a small amount of catalyst. Ideally, based on the performance of 25%CFO/BWO is also at an exceptional catalytic level, the application prospect of as-prepared 25%CFO/BWO is promising."
13,Possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism,"3.6 Possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism In order to further investigate on the fundamental active species in the process of degrading TC-HCl, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), 4-Hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL) and methanol (MeOH) were added into the solution as rapping agents for •OH, •O2 − and h+ to investigate the charges transfer route in the heterojunction. As displayed in Fig. 7b, the photocatalytic removal rate of TC-HCl from 0.0293 min−1 without any scavenger to 0.017 and 0.0118 min−1 in the presence of MeOH and IPA, respectively. Especially, the degradation rate dropped drastically to 0.0068 min−1 after adding TEMPOL, this obvious inhibition phenomenon indicates that •O2 − is the dominant active group generated in the decomposition of TC-HCl by 25%CFO/WBO heterojunctions under visible-light irradiation. Therefore, we conclude that •OH, •O2 − and h+ all participated in the reaction process, and the influence level satisfies the law of •O2 − >•OH > h+. Based on the above discussion, two possible transfer pathways of photogenerated e- and h + in the traditional type II and type Z -Scheme have been deduced. In traditional type II (Fig. 8 a), since the ECB value of Cu2(OH)3F is more negative than that of Bi2WO6, the photo-excited electrons in the CB of Cu2(OH)3F migrate to Bi2WO6 under visible light irradiation. Regretfully, the reduction ability of electrons on the CB of Bi2WO6 (−0.17 eV) was not enough to convert dissolved oxygen into •O2 – (O2/•O2 –, −0.33 eV) [63]. Correspondingly, the EVB values of Cu2(OH)3F are more positive than Bi2WO6 result in the photogenerated holes in the VB of Bi2WO6 transport to Cu2(OH)3F. It is unsatisfactory that the VB potential of Cu2(OH)3F is higher than OH/•OH(+2.40 eV) but lower than H2O/•OH(+2.72 eV) [26,33], so only part of •OH can be produced. Considering the paramount role of •O2 – radical in active species trapping experiments, the charge transfer of the CFO/ BWO composite does not fulfill a type-II heterojunction. Meanwhile, the photocatalysis mechanism of the Z-scheme CFO/BWO heterojunction is supported in Fig. 8b, the photo-induced electrons at the CB edge of Bi2WO6 and the holes at the VB edge of Cu2(OH)3F would be recombined. Hence, the electrons on the CB edge of Cu2(OH)3F with a higher negative potential can easily generate a large amount of •O2 –, while the holes on the CB of Bi2WO6 can maintain a higher positive potential to generate •OH. Subsequently, •O2 –, •OH, h+ participate in the degradation of TC-HCl. This photogenerated charges separation design accurately corresponds with the result of active species trapping experiments. Thus, the Z-scheme charge transfer system uses the solid–solid contact interface of CFO/ BWO as the recombination center between the electrons of Bi2WO6 and the holes of Cu2(OH)3F, which can effectively inhibit the recombination of photo-generated charges, and then significantly improve the photodegradation efficiency."
14,Z-scheme heterojunction charge transfer mechanism,"3.7 Z-scheme heterojunction charge transfer mechanism To further explore the interfacial charge transfer between Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6, the change in material binding energy was detected by a small scan of VB-XPS. As previously reported [64,65], the contact potential difference ΔV = Φ-φ (φ is the work function of the instrument with a value of 4.55 eV and Φ is a function of the work sample). As demonstrated in Fig. 9 , ΔV can be obtained from the distance of the inflection point (IP) and then Φ can be calculated. In addition, the VB value obtained by VB-XPS is in general agreement with the value previously obtained in Fig. 4. Accordingly, the work functions of Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6 can be calculated as 6.63 and 6.79 eV, respectively. Since Cu2(OH)3F occupies a higher Fermi energy level and smaller work function than Bi2WO6, the electrons in Cu2(OH)3F tend to transfer to Bi2WO6 to bring the Fermi energy level to equilibrium [66]. As a consequence, the change in the position of the Fermi energy level causes the energy band edge of Cu2(OH)3F to bend upward continuously toward the interface, while the energy band of Bi2WO6 bends in the opposite direction. In this case, the electrons in the conduction band of Bi2WO6 and the holes in the valence band of Cu2(OH)3F can easily migrate to the interface for compounding, while the electrons and holes at the two ends remain in their pristine energy bands, respectively. Thus, a typical Z-scheme heterojunction that facilitates charge separation and transfer is formed. It is clear that the heterogeneous interface is the center of charge carrier redistribution. Notably, the electronic coupling of surface hydrogen bonds can induce charge transfer and further enhance the interfacial electric field, thus greatly increasing the lifetimes of in situ electrons and holes and adding another guarantee for the enhanced photocatalytic ability. In order to demonstrate the charge transfer pathway more favorably, photodeposition experiments were performed on the as-prepared heterojunctions. According to previous reports [67], H2PtCl6 is reduced to Pt nanoparticles after accepting electrons, while Pb(NO3)2 can be oxidized by cavities to PbO2, which means they can be deposited on both ends of the Z-scheme heterojunction, respectively. Fig. S8 clearly show that the distribution of Pb and Bi elements after photodeposition is highly similar. Meanwhile, two closely connected particles with lattice spacing of 0.315 nm and 0.302 nm are observed in the HRTEM image, which are assigned to the (131) plane of Bi2WO6 and (020) plane of PbO2, respectively. Indicating that PbO2 particles are deposited onto the Bi2WO6 nanosheets. On the other hand, the Pt elements distribution follows the Cu elements, and the lattice edge space of the (111) plane of Pt nanoparticles in HRTEM is 0.227 nm and is in close contact with the (211) crystal plane of Cu2(OH)3F(0.270 nm). These results provide strong evidence that the formation of Z-scheme heterojunctions allows the photogenerated electrons and holes to be retained on Cu2(OH)3F and Bi2WO6, respectively. Furthermore, the linkage of hydrogen bonds between the heterogeneous interfaces contributes to the relatively good photochemical properties observed in CFO/BWO heterojunctions."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, a high-efficient Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6 Z-scheme heterojunction was successfully fabricated by in situ hydrothermal deposit of Cu2(OH)3F diametrically on the interstice of Bi2WO6 microspheres. A series of Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6 heterojunctions displayed improved photocatalytic properties of degradation towards TC-HCl. The optimal 25%CFO/BWO composite exhibited 2.1 and 2.2 times higher photocatalytic activity than pure Bi2WO6 and Cu2(OH)3F, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of Cu2(OH)3F/Bi2WO6 composite was credited to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction which can dramatically promote the separation of photo-generated electron and holes. Furthermore, the electron coupling of heterogeneous hydrogen bonds can induce charge transfer and further increase electron transport channels. The stability and recyclability of the material have also been proven. This heterogeneous structure introduces new members and provides inspiration for the design of photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants."
