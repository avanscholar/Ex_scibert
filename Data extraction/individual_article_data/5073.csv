0,Introduction,"Rising concerns over environmental pollution and the ongoing depletion of fossil fuels have spawned considerable research on ways of exploiting alternative renewable energy sources. Among the various alternative renewable sources, hydrogen (H2) is widely considered the most promising alternative energy carrier due to its high energy yield (122 kJ/g) and production of only water when combusted [1]. Among the various H2 production methods, biological production of H2 is an attractive area that utilizes bacteria which freely and efficiently produce H2 as a by-product during their metabolism. This form of hydrogen production can be broadly divided into photo-driven processes and dark fermentative H2 production (DFHP), but the latter is known to have superior aspects from a practical point of view, i.e. no need of light, fast H2 production rate, and degradation of organic substrates [2,3]. In DFHP, theoretically, up to 33% of the electrons in hexose sugars can convert to H2. This means that at least 66% of the substrate electrons remain on the liquid-state metabolites such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols [4]. In order to treat H2 fermented effluent and to maximize bioenergy production, CH4 fermentation, photo-fermentation, and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been proposed as post-treatment processes. Although a “dark + photo two-stage fermentation system” and a “dark + MFC system” could theoretically achieve maximum H2 yield and directly generate electricity, respectively, these two systems remain at an infancy stage [4,5]. One of the main economic burdens associated with DFHP is the requirement of continuous alkali addition to maintain the proper operational pH condition for H2 producing bacteria (HPB), Clostridium sp., of around 5.5. When a CH4 fermenter is followed by a H2 fermenter, the alkalinity is increased, because acids are removed and protein is degraded. Therefore, if the CH4 fermented effluent is successfully recirculated to the DFHP system, a “dark + CH4 fermentation system” would not only theoretically achieve maximum bioenergy recovery but also supply buffer capacity to the DFHP system [4–6]. Taking into consideration the aforementioned issues, Chu et al. [7] newly developed a pH-phased two-stage process involving a thermophilic H2 production reactor (55 °C), a mesophilic filter CH4 production reactor (35 °C), and a digested sludge storage tank. In the digester sludge storage tank, the precipitated sludge at the bottom of the tank is internally recirculated to the H2 production reactor in order to maintain a stable pH. As a result, the reactor was continuously operated for over 150 days, and stable performance for simultaneous H2 and CH4 fermentation was obtained. Similarly, Kraemer and Bagley [8] recycled CH4 fermenter (28 °C) effluent to a H2 fermenter (35 °C). Although the CH4 fermenter effluent decreased the alkali addition requirement by 40%, a 87% decrease of H2 productivity was observed, due mainly to the H2 consuming activity. This research indicates the need for thermophilic conditions in the DFHP system or pretreatment prior to adding CH4 fermented effluent to the H2 fermenter as diluting water for alkalinity supply. It is well documented that HRT and substrate concentration are key factors during continuous DFHP, because they affect microbial community and metabolic pathway, respectively. Even with DFHP operated under the same organic loading rate (OLR) condition, the H2 production performance will be different due to interactive effect of HRT and substrate concentration. In addition, the cycle-frequency affects the DFHP performance when operating an intermittent system, such as an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) and an intermittent-continuously stirred tank reactor (i-CSTR), due to variation of the reaction time for H2 production and degradation of substrate. Therefore, considering those facts, the present study aimed at developing a two-stage fermentation system for H2 and CH4 production with recycling of CH4 fermented effluent. In this study, Laminaria japonica, a type of brown algae, was utilized as feedstock and a previously optimized combined (acid + thermal) pretreatment was employed [9,10]. To optimize operational parameters (cycle-frequency, HRT, and substrate concentration) in the DFHP system, a response surface methodology (RSM) with a BBD was employed. In addition, in order to maximize the bioenergy recovery, the H2 fermented solid state (HFSS) and H2 fermented liquid state (HFLS) were subsequently treated by an ASBR and an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBr), respectively. Finally, the feasibility of employing CH4 fermented effluent from UASBr (MFEUASBr) for reduction of the alkali addition requirement in DFHP was evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and substrate for DFHP,"2.1 Seed sludge and substrate for DFHP The seed sludge was taken from an anaerobic digester in a local wastewater treatment plant. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 7.8, 4.78 g CaCO3/L, and 3.8 g/L, respectively. The sludge was heat-treated at 90 °C for 20 min to suppress H2 consuming bacteria. Prior to combined pretreatment, L. japonica was ground to below 0.5 mm particle size with a knife-milling Waring commercial blender. Subsequently, L. japonica was pretreated an HCl solution of 4.8% for 30 min at a S (solid)/L (liquid) ratio of 1:12, and thermal pretreatment was then applied in a 5 L stainless-steel reactor at 93 °C for 23 min [10], resulting in the soluble/total COD ratio of approximately 0.6. After combined pretreatment, mixed liquors were neutralized to pH 7.0 with 3 N KOH."
3,Box–Behnken design,"2.2 Box–Behnken design A 3k BBD (Box and Behnken, 1960) with Design-Expert (Stat-Ease, Inc., USA) software was employed to optimize the key process parameters for enhancing H2 production. H2 yield was chosen as the response variable, while cycle-frequency (X 1), HRT (X 2), and substrate concentration (X 3) were chosen as three independent variables. In developing the regression equation, the relationship between the coded values and the actual values was described by the following equation [11]: (1) x i = ( X i − X i ∗ ) / Δ X i where x i is the coded value of the i th independent variable, X i is the uncoded value of the i th independent variable, X i * is the uncoded value of the i th independent variable at the center point, and ΔX i is the step change value. In order to determine the individual and interactive effects of three parameters on H2 yield, the following response equation was used to correlate the dependent and independent variables [12]: (2) y = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 k β i x i + ∑ i = 1 k β i i x i 2 + ∑ i < j β i j x i x j where y is the response, β 0 is a constant, β i is a linear coefficient, β ii is a quadratic coefficient, and β ij is an interactive coefficient. A total of fourteen experimental sets were made, and two replicates at the center point were applied. Each factor was evaluated at one of high, central and low levels to estimate the experimental variability and the experiment design and the corresponding experimental results are shown in Table 1 ."
4,Two-stage fermentation system,"2.3 Two-stage fermentation system In this study, i-CSTR with a working volume of 5.0 L (325 mm high by 140 mm ID) was seeded with the heat-treated sludge equivalent to 30% of the working volume, and filled with a certain amount of pretreated L. japonica. There was no addition external nutrient. It was purged with N2 gas for 5 min to provide an anaerobic condition and agitated at 200 rpm. The initial and operation pH were maintained at 8.0 ± 0.1 and 5.5 ± 0.2, respectively, using pH sensors, pH controllers, and 3 N KOH. When the yield of produced H2 reached 60 mL H2/g dcw, the operation type was switched from batch to continuous mode. Prior to CH4 fermentation, H2 fermented effluent was sieved by a 25 μm mesh in order to separate the solid and liquid portions. For the CH4 fermentation system, an ASBR (working volume 3.0 L; 380 mm high by 135 mm ID) and UASBr (working volume 3.5 L; 690 mm high by 65 mm ID) were applied. One cycle period for the ASBR was 24 h: 18 h reaction time, 5 h settling time, and 1 h filling and decanting. The OLR was controlled by HRT change (1.0–3.0 g COD/L/d) and substrate concentration (1.0–6.0 g COD/L/d) in the ASBR and UASBr, respectively. The HRT was set to 2 days in UASBr. The seed sludge of the ASBR was taken from anaerobic digestion, while the CH4 production granule was collected from a brewery wastewater treatment plant for the UASBr. Reactors were installed in a temperature controlled room at 35±1 °C."
5,Batch test,"2.4 Batch test In order to determine the suitable mixing ratio of tap water and MFEUASBr (heat pretreated at 90 °C for 20 min), a batch test was conducted. The total volume of 250 mL serum bottles at various tap water and MFEUASBr mixing ratios (T/M ratios) ranging from 10:0 – 0:10 with 1 interval. The characteristics of MFEUASBr were as follows: alkalinity of 2700 mg CaCO3/L, pH 7.4 ± 0.2, COD concentration of 210 ± 60 mg COD/L, and ammonia concentration of 110 ± 16 mg NH4–N/L. The working volume was 100 mL and the bottles were seeded with heat pretreated anaerobic sludge up to 30% of the working volume, and filled with pretreated L. japonica. The initial and operation pH were uncontrolled. All batch tests were conducted in a shaking incubator at 35 °C and 200 rpm, and were carried out in triplicate."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods H2 content in biogas was determined by a gas chromatography (GC, Cow Mac series 580) using a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.8 m × 3.2 mm stainless-steel column packed with molecular sieve 5 A with N2 as a carrier gas. The contents of CH4, N2, and CO2 were measured using a GC of the same model noted previously with a 1.8 m × 3.2 mm stainless-steel column packed with porapak Q (80/100 mesh) using helium as a carrier gas. The temperatures of injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50 °C, respectively, in both GCs. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs, C2–C6) and lactic acid were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Finnigan Spectra SYSTEM LC, Thermo Electron Co.) with an ultraviolet (210 nm) detector (UV1000, Thermo Electron) and a 100 mm × 7.8 mm Fast Acid Analysis column (Bio-Rad Lab.) using 0.005 M H2SO4 as a mobile phase. Aliphatic alcohol was determined using another HPLC (DX-600, Dionex) with an electrochemical detector (ED50A, Dionex) and a 250 mm × 9 mm IonPac ICE-ASI column (Dionex) using 50 mM HClO4 as mobile phase. The liquid samples were pretreated with a 0.45 μm membrane filter before injection to both HPLC with COD and VS were measured according to Standard Methods [13]."
7,Microbial analysis,"2.6 Microbial analysis To identify the microbial communities in i-CSTR, the DNA at different operating conditions: (A) with alkali solution; (B) without alkali solution and with heat pretreatment of MFEUASBr; (C) without alkali solution and with non-heat pretreated MFEUASBr were extracted using an Ultraclean Soil DNA Kit (Cat # 12800-50; Mo Bio Laboratory Inc., USA). The 16S rDNA fragments were stored at −20 °C before being amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The region corresponding to positions 357F and 518R in the 16S rDNA of Escherichia coli was PCR-amplified using the forward primer EUB357f (5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) with a GC clamp (5′-CGCCCG CCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCC-3′) at the 5′ end to stabilize the melting behavior of the DNA fragments and the reverse primer UNIV518r (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′). PCR amplification was conducted in an automated thermal cycler (MWG-Bio TECH, Germany) using the following protocol: initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C, annealing for 40 s at 55 °C, extension for 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension for 8 min at 72 °C. PCR mixtures had a final volume of 50 μl of 10 × PCR buffer, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM of each primer, 0.1 mM dNTP, 25 pg template, and 1 U polymerase. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel in 1 × TAE for 30 min for 50 V, and then checked with ethidium bromide staining to confirm the amplification. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was carried out using a Dcode Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instruments. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1 × TAE buffer for 480 min at 70 V and 60 °C on a polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) containing a linear gradient ranging from 40% to 60% denaturant. After electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 30 min, and then visualized on a UV transilluminator. Most bands were excised from the DGGE polyacrylamide gel for 16S rDNA sequencing. DNA was eluted from the excised bands by immersion in 20 μl of Tris EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for one day, and then PCR-amplified with the forward primer EUB357f without a GC clamp and the reverse primer UNIV518r. After PCR amplification, PCR products were purified using a Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold (MILLIPORE com., USA). All strands of the purified PCR products were sequenced with primers EUB357f by an ABIPRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Search of the GenBank database was conducted using the BLAST program."
8,Results and discussion,
9,H2 and CH4 production using two-state fermentation system,"3.1 H2 and CH4 production using two-state fermentation system 3.1.1 Fist-stage fermentation system: optimization of DFHP using RSM with BBD The response independent variables and experimental results are presented in Table 1. Experiments 1–12 were performed at different combinations and those from 13 to 14 were under the center point. The maximum H2 yield of 115.2 mL H2/g dcw was achieved at the center point condition of 16 hr cycle-frequency, HRT 3.5 days, and 25 g COD/L. The quality of the regression, estimated by an analysis of variance (ANOVA), is shown in Table 2 . The model F-value of 8.28 implies that the model was significant, and a value of ‘Prob > F’ less than 0.05 indicates that the model terms were significant [11]. Based on the ANOVA results, Eq. (3) was obtained by using Eq. (2) to fit the experimental data of the H2 yield. (3) Y = − 178.734 + 23.989 X 1 + 25.558 X 2 + 3.613 X 3 − 0.516 X 1 X 2 + 0.022 X 1 X 3 − 0.186 X 2 X 3 − 0.676 X 1 2 − 2.009 X 2 2 − 0.059 X 3 2 where X 1, X 2, X 3, and Y are the cycle-frequency (hr), HRT (day), substrate concentration (g COD/L), and corresponding H2 yield (mL H2/g dcw), respectively. Although these results indicate that only X 1 2 (P < 0.05) was a significant model term for H2 yield in this study, the rest of the sources cannot be eliminated to support the hierarchy of the model, because the predicted values versus the experimental values of H2 yield clearly revealed that this model can explain up to 95% variability of the response (Fig. 1 ). The maximum H2 yield of 115.53 mL H2/g dcw was predicted at the following optimum operational conditions: cycle of 17 hr, HRT of 2.7 days, and substrate concentration of 31.1 g COD/L. The two-dimensional contour lines and three-dimensional response surfaces are shown in Fig. 2 (A)–(C) are based on Eq. (3) with one variable kept constant at its optimum level (cycle-frequency = 17 hr, HRT = 2.7 days, and substrate concentration = 31.1 g COD/L), and varying the other two variables within the experimental range. As shown by the three-dimensional response surfaces in Fig. 2(A)–(C), the response surface of H2 yield showed a clear peak, indicating that the optimum conditions fell inside the design boundary. H2 yield increased with increasing cycle-frequency, HRT, and substrate concentration to optimum conditions, and then decreased with a further increase. The results show that three independent variables all had an individual or interactive influence on H2 yield. In Fig. 2(A)–(B), two-dimensional contour lines present an elliptic characteristic with the long axis of the ellipse running along the respective HRT and substrate concentration axis, indicating that the variation of cycle-frequency remarkably affects the H2 yield compared to temperature and reaction time. As shown in Fig. 2(C), the variation of substrate concentration is relatively more important than that of HRT on H2 yield. Overall, the degree of importance of these three variables on H2 yield is: cycle-frequency > substrate concentration > HRT. In order to confirm the validity of the statistical results, a verification test was conducted at the obtained optimal conditions: cycle-frequency of 17 hr, HRT of 2.7 days, and substrate concentration of 31.1 g COD/L during 40 days operation. H2 yield of 113.1 mL H2/g dcw (97.8% of the predicted response value) and HPR of 128.4 mL H2/L/h were recorded with main liquid-state metabolites of acetate and butyrate. 3.1.2 The second-stage fermentation system: CH4 production from HFSS and HFLS To minimize organic matter in effluent and maximize bioenergy recovery, HFSS and HFLS were fermented by using CH4-ASBR and CH4-UASBr, respectively, as post-treatment processes. Fig. 3 (A) shows the daily variations of CH4 yield and CH4 production rate in ASBR with HFSS as a substrate. At the first 40 days, the ASBR was operated at a HRT of 30 days as a start-up period, and the HRT was thereafter gradually decreased from 30 to 10 days. Since then, CH4 yield and its production rate gradually increased to 226.5 mL CH4/g COD and 598.8 mL CH4/L/d, respectively, which were the average value from 110 to 133 days with COD removal of 90% (Table 3 ). CH4 content in biogas ranged from 70 to 76%. However, at a HRT of 10 days, COD removal and VS reduction were decreased to around 60%, resulting in wide fluctuation of CH4 yield and CH4 production rate. Therefore, it might be concluded that a HRT of 12 days was the optimal condition for treating HFSS, not only in terms of CH4 production but also with respect to reduction of the final discharge COD concentration. For CH4 production treating HFLS, as shown in Fig. 3(B), CH4-UASBr was fixed at a HRT of 2 days, while OLR was stepwise increased from 1 (start-up) to 6 g COD/L/d. As the OLR increased, both CH4 yield and production rate increased. A maximum CH4 yield of 329.8 mL CH4/g COD was achieved when the OLR was 3.5 g COD/L/d, while a maximum CH4 production rate of 1955 mL CH4/L/d was observed at an OLR of 4.5 g COD/L/d (Table 3). As the solid part was excluded in the feed, the CH4-UASBr showed much higher CH4 yield and CH4 production rate than those of the ASBR, reaching 94% of the theoretically achievable CH4 yield. Further increase of the OLR to 6 g COD/L/d caused the CH4 yield and production rate to fall with a decrease of COD removal. Subsequently, the OLR was decreased again to 3.5 g COD/L/d, and then the CH4 yield recovered rapidly; this indicated that an OLR of 3.5 g COD/L/d was the optimal condition for COD degradation and CH4 yield of the CH4-UASBr, while an OLR of 4.5 g COD/L/d was optimal for maximizing the CH4 production rate. As portrayed in Fig. 4 , bioenergy recovery and COD removal efficiency of the two-stage fermentation system using L. japonica were evaluated. In this evaluation, CH4 production performances at a HRT of 12 d and OLR of 4.5 g COD/L/d in UASBr were used, where the highest CH4 production rate was achieved with stable CH4 yield. In a previous work [14], although a two-stage fermentation system using non-pretreated L. japonica was developed with 49.9% biogas conversion (H2-ASBR: 3.8%, CH4-UASBr: 36.1%) and 55.1% COD removal, the overall performance of the system was limited duo to production of 41.8% of the influent COD in the sediment after centrifugation. However, in this process, 7.1% of the influent COD was converted to H2 in the i-CSTR system, and 35.1% and 38.7% of the influent COD were converted to CH4 in the ASBR and UASBr, respectively, with a resulting total of 80.9% of influent COD being converted to biogas from 31.1 g/L of L. japonica with 89.3% overall COD removal. The system performances obtained in this study are compared with those of previous works in Table 4 . A H2-generating CSTR followed by an up-flow anaerobic filter were operated using sucrose as a substrate at various sucrose concentration [15]. Similarly, cogeneration of H2 and CH4 from glucose was tested in batch system by Xie et al. [16]. In addition, extracted liquid fraction derived from sweet sorghum [18] and heat pretreated potato waste [19] were utilized as substrate for H2 and CH4 production and fed it into both CSTR type two-stage fermenter system. In this study, The H2 productivity was comparable with that of previous works, being only lower than that of a two-stage fermentation system treating synthetic wastewater [15,16]. Also, the sum of CH4 productivity (ASBR + UASBr) was comparable, especially CH4 production from H2 fermented effluent using sucrose as a substrate. The results indicate that L. japonica has strong potential as a carbon source for the production of H2 and CH4 by a two-stage fermentation system."
10,DFHP with MFEUASBr as diluting water,"3.2 DFHP with MFEUASBr as diluting water In order to check the feasibility of MFEUASBr as diluting water for the reduction of alkali addition in DFHP and to determine the optimal T/M ratio, batch tests were conducted with various T/M ratios. CH4 production was not detected in all batch tests, thus indicating that CH4-producing bacteria were suppressed by heat pretreatment. As shown in Table 5 , the initial pH was gradually increased to pH 7.8 ± 0.2 with an increase of the MFEUASBr mixing ratio. It is well known that pH is one of the key process parameters in DFHP, as it may directly affect the hydrogenase activity [20]. The optimal initial and operational pH values vary extensively from 4.5 to 9.0; however, it has been reported that maximum H2 production was detected at initial pH above 7.0 [21,22], whereas hydrogenic reactions by HPB are dominant at operational pH of 5.0–6.0. In this study, the initial pH values were above 7.0 in the whole T/M ratio due to neutralization (pH 7.0) after combined pretreatment. However, H2 was negligibly produced until a T/M ratio of 9:1; this might be due to the small amount of alkalinity in the reactor, where the final pH was around 4.0. On the other hand, the H2 yield was increased with an increase of the MFEUASBr portion, resulting in a maximum H2 yield of 151.8 ± 0.9 mL H2/g dcw being observed at a T/M ratio of 5:5, where the initial and operational pH were 7.5 and 5.4, respectively. Although this H2 yield was slightly lower than that of a previous study by the present authors [9] involving addition of an alkaline solution of 3 N KOH (159.6 mL H2/g dcw), there was only a 5% H2 yield drop in the case of adding heat pretreated MFEUASBr. This shows that MFEUASBr can potentially be used as an alkali provider for economic benefits; therefore, based on the results, the effect of heat pretreated MFEUASBr as diluting water on alkali addition requirement in continuous DFHP was monitored using an i-CSTR with three different operating conditions as follows: (1) with alkaline solution of 3 N KOH; (2) without alkaline solution, but with heat pretreated MFEUASBr; and (3) without alkaline solution and with non-heat pretreated MFEUASBr. Fig. 5 shows the daily variations of H2 production using MFEUASBr as diluting water. For the first 40 days, the reactor was operated at optimal conditions with use of the alkaline solution. Heat pretreated MFEUASBr was next mixed with L. japonica prior to injecting the substrate to the reactor, and the reactor was operated without the addition of an external alkali solution. H2 yield and HPR slightly decreased to 102.8 mL H2/g dcw and 123.1 mL H2/L/h, and no CH4 production was detected in this case. The liquid-stage metabolites were mainly acetate (29%) and butyrate (35%), while caproate (11%) was also detected. Although a 7.6% H2 yield and 3.5% HPR drop were observed in the case of adding heat pretreated MFEUASBr without alkaline solution, 100% reduction of alkali addition was possible, which could maximize the economic benefit of the two-stage fermentation system. In addition, in order to reduce the diluting water preparation cost, the utilization of MFEUASBr as diluting water in DFHP facilitates the realization of a zero-discharge system. However, in the case of the third condition, drastic decreases of H2 yield and H2 production rate (about 38.2% and 36.4%, respectively) were observed. Moreover, acetate (19%), butyrate (21%), and propionate (27%) were detected in the main liquid-stage metabolites. Similarly, in a previous work [8], an 87% decrease of H2 productivity was observed due to H2 consuming activity of methanogens. The change of the by-product distribution is thought to be due mainly to the contamination of non-HPB originating from MFEUASBr; this is further discussed in the next chapter."
11,Microbial analysis,"3.3 Microbial analysis In order to assess the effects of MFEUASBr on the dominant microbial community in continuous DFHP, bacterial diversity was monitored by PCR-DGGE. Fig. 6 illustrates the DGGE profiles of a 16S rDNA gene fragment amplified from i-CSTR, which was sampled with different operating conditions: (A) with alkali solution; (B) without alkali solution and with heat pretreatment of MFEUASBr; and (C) without alkali solution and with non-heat pretreated MFEUASBr. The major bands were excised and purified to determine the sequence. As shown in Table 6 , the major 12 bands were excised and purified to determine the sequence. In the first operating condition, well known HPB, Clostridium sp., Clostridium acetobytylicum, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium acidisoli, and Clostridium diolis, were only detected with above 95% similarity [23], indicating continuous DFHP using i-CSTR was successfully optimized via the RSM with BBD. Although some species of HPB (bands #3, #7) disappeared in the second operating condition, non-HPB was not detected, thus indicating that the reactor was protected from contamination by heat pretreatment. Furthermore, Megasphaera elsdenii, a putative HPB that is capable of producing caproate, was detected [24]. This result coincided with the distribution of liquid-stage metabolites in the second operating condition, where the portion of caproate exceeded 11%. In addition, propionate-producing bacteria that consume H2 [25], Selenomonas sp., only appeared in the third operating condition. This population shift could be linked to a decrease of H2 productivity with propionate production in the third operating condition."
12,Conclusions,"In this study, continuous H2 and CH4 fermentation from L. japonica was attempted using a two-stage fermentation system under mesophilic conditions, and the following conclusions have been drawn: 1. To optimize operational parameters in the first-stage system, a RSM with a BBD was employed. The most significant factor was found to be cycle-frequency, and optimal conditions were cycle-frequency of 17 hr, HRT of 2.7 days, and substrate concentration of 31.1 g COD/L, under which a H2 yield of 113.1 mL H2/g dcw and a H2 production rate of 128.4 mL H2/L/h were obtained. 2. In order to treat H2 fermented effluent, an ASBR and UASBr were employed for CH4 production from HFSS and HFLS, respectively. The best performance of CH4 production in the ASBR and UASBr was observed at a HRT of 12 days and an OLR of 3.5 g COD/L/d, respectively. Moreover, the CH4 yield in the UASBr was much higher than that in the ASBR, because the solid part was excluded from the UASBr feed. Overall COD removal of 89.3% and bioenergy recovery of 80.9% (H2 7.1%, CH4-ASBR 35.1%, CH4-UASBr 38.7%) were achieved with this system. 3. Although a slight decrease of H2 productivity was observed at a T/M ratio of 5:5 in the continuous system, the difference was not severe, with decreases of only 7% and 3.5% for H2 yield and H2 production rate, respectively, in the continuous mode. In addition to 100% reduction of alkali addition and reduction of the diluting water preparation cost, utilization of MFEUASBr as diluting water in DFHP helps to maximize the economic benefit of the two-stage fermentation system. 4. Microbial analysis clearly reveals that H2-producers, Clostridium sp., were dominantly existed in DFHP system, while H2-consumer, Selenomonas sp., was detected in the third operating condition. A microbial diversity analysis indicated that heat pretreatment is required to exclude non-HPB for stable DFHP with recycling of MFEUASBr as diluting water."
