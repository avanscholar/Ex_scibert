0,Introduction,"There are large numbers of metal complexes with imine-based Schiff bases which are commonly used as oxidation catalysts in various types of important organic reactions due to their commercially cheap, easy mode of preparation and outstanding chemical and thermal strength in both solid and liquid states [1-4]. Among these, oxovanadium(V) and dioxomolybdenum(VI) complexes achieved a prominent position for their utility as a catalyst in numerous oxidation reactions like, oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, epoxidation of olefins and hydroxylation of phenols [5-18]. The most demanding reactions in organic synthesis are the selective oxidation for the conversion of primary and secondary alcohols into their respective aldehydes and ketones [19]. This is because of the importance of these carbonyls as intermediates in the synthesis of other organic compounds which are required for the preparation of medicines, artificial flavoring, perfumes, agrochemicals and different kinds of dyes [20]. The routine procedure for the oxidation of alcohols involves the reaction of stoichiometric amounts of oxidants like chromates, permanganates, nitrates and bromates based reagents, with alcohols [21-23]. There are a lot of drawbacks associated with the use of these traditional reagents, such as poor efficiency, reduced yield and generation of large amounts of environmental pollutants in the form of heavy metals wastes [24]. These synthetic protocols not only consume the greater quantity of these oxidizing agents but also associated with the production of toxic side products [25,26]. In addition to this, the oxidation reactions require harsh reaction conditions like, elevated pressure of oxygen, high temperature and the use of unavoidable toxic solvents which are not only corrosive but also very dangerous from an environmental point of view [27]. In order to overcome above mentioned issues, a lot of manipulations in reaction conditions were carried out to control the rate of reaction and selectivity, accompanying the amount and nature of by-products produced [28-30]. These transformations include changes in the concentration of reactants, pressure, temperature, alternative environmentally friendly solvents, and to design and develop novel catalysts [31-34]. Consequently, catalytic oxidation schemes based on transition metals like copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, palladium, chromium and gold [35-41], along with molecular oxygen [42,43], hydrogen peroxide [44] and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) [45,46], as oxidizing agents, were investigated. In addition to above listed transition metal ions having high catalytic potential with H2O2, the metals with high oxidation states like oxovanadium(V) and dioxomolybdenum(VI), have shown better potential for catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol owing to their greater attribution with peroxide to make catalytically active intermediates [47-54]. These metal peroxy intermediates can easily shift the oxygen atom to the substrate to oxidize it [55]. Keeping in mind the greater affinity of VO(V) and MoO2(VI) complexes in the catalytic oxidation reactions, it can be predicted that oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes or ketones in the presence of urea hydrogen peroxide under lenient reaction conditions can carried out with the help of oxovanadium(V) and dioxomolybdenum(VI) complexes [56]. In continuation to our previous researches and work on Schiff base complexes for oxidation of organic compounds [57-60], we are hereby describing the synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, crystal structure, computational studies and catalytic potentials of two novel oxovanadium(V) and dioxomolybdenum(VI) complexes derived from nicotinic hydrazides."

2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods All the chemicals employed in the current work were 99.9% pure and purchased from well renowned suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich and Merck. Elemental analysis was carried out by Heraeus CHN-O-FLASH EA 1112 instrument. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured at ambient temperature by using BRUKER AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer by using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Coupling constant (J) and chemical shift (δ) values were reported in Hz and in ppm, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectra of the synthesized compounds were recorded by making their KBr pellets with the help of IRPrestige-21 (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer."
3,Synthesis,"2.2 Synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of ONO-tridentate Schiff base ligand (H2L) Nicotinic hydrazide (1.37 g, 10 mmol) and 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde (1.67 g, 10 mmol) were dissolved separately in an approximately 25 mL of hot methanol. After complete dissolution both solutions were mixed dropwise with continuous stirring. The resulting mixture was refluxed for round about 3 h until the completion of reaction was ensured by ongoing monitoring with the help of TLC. On allowing the reaction mixture to attain the room temperature, the product was settled down leaving behind the impurities in the solvent. Finally, the desired product was collected by filtration, aided by suction apparatus and washed thrice with cold methanol to remove impurities if any. H2L: Yield 75%. Anal.

The mixture was kept under reflux for 3 h to obtain the product in the form of precipitates which were filtered off and then washed thoroughly with equal amounts of water, methanol and diethyl ether, separately. The precipitates were dried in vacuo and then crystallized from CH3CH2OH to get orange-colored crystals. [MoVO2(L)(CH3CH2OH)]: Yield 72%. Anal.

4,"X-ray crystallographic analysis, data collection and structure determination of complexes","2.3 X-ray crystallographic analysis, data collection and structure determination of complexes Single crystal X-ray studies of oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum complexes were carried out on a STOE IPDS-II diffractometer by using Mo-Kα radiations monochromated by graphite. The data was collected at 298(2) K in a series of ω-scans in 1° oscillations and integrated using the Stöe X-AREA [61] software package. A numerical absorption correction was applied using the X-RED [62] and X-SHAPE [63] software for Mo complex. For V complex, absorption corrections based on multi-scan use were applied [64]. The data was corrected for Lorentz and Polarizing effects. The structures were solved by direct methods using SIR2004 [65]. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by the full-matrix least-squares method on F 2 using SHELXL [66]. The collected crystallographic data of the complexes are listed in Table 1 ."
5,Computational details,"2.4 Computational details Theoretical calculations involving geometry optimization in the gas and solution phases, vibrational frequencies and NMR chemical shifts of ligand and its complexes were performed with the Gaussian 09 package [67] at B3LYP level of theory [68]. The solution phase was modeled by using IEFPCM by considering the solvent [69]. The standard Def2-TZVP [70] was used for all atoms in ligand and complexes. Geometry optimizations were tested by frequency analysis to ensure that they were at the minima of potential energy surface (PES). The results showed that there is no imaginary frequency. The 1H and 13C NMR magnetic isotropic shielding tensors were calculated by the standard Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) approach in the solution phase [71]. Chemical shift values of compounds were calculated by using B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level and IEFPCM model as implicit model of solvent and compared with experimental data in DMSO‑d6 . The same solvent was used for all IEFPCM calculations for ligand, V and Mo complexes and TMS. Chemical shifts were calculated by subtracting the appropriate isotropic part of the shielding tensor from that of TMS δi = σTMS - σi. The isotropic magnetic shielding tensors for TMS calculated in the solution phase at the B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level of theory were equal to 31.92 and 184.52 ppm for the 1H nuclei and the 13C nuclei, respectively. The Chemissian program was used for drawing contour plots of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) [72]."
6,General procedure for oxidation of benzylic alcohols to benzaldehydes catalyzed by VOL and MoO2L Schiff base complexes,"2.5 General procedure for oxidation of benzylic alcohols to benzaldehydes catalyzed by VOL and MoO2L Schiff base complexes In a 25 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, to a solution of benzylic alcohol (1 mmol) and catalyst (0.006 mmol) in 10 mL CH3CN, urea hydrogen peroxide (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred under reflux conditions for specified interval of time. The proceedings of the reaction was monitored by TLC (eluent, n-hexane: ethyl acetate, 7:3). After completion, the reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent was then evaporated to get the pure targeted product by column chromatography employing silica gel as a stationary phase. All products were identified by comparing their physicochemical and spectroscopic (FT-IR and NMR) characteristics with those of authentic samples."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Syntheses,"3.1 Syntheses A tridentate Schiff base ligand (H2L) was prepared by treating nicotinic hydrazide with 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde in a methanolic environment. Reaction of VO(acac)2 and MoO2(acac)2 with H2L in methanol under reflux condition produces the required metal complexes (Scheme 1 ). After successful synthesis and characterization, the catalytic effectiveness of the complexes were also checked by oxidising various benzylic alcohols using UHP as a source of oxygen (Scheme 2 )."
9,Crystal structure determination,"3.2 Crystal structure determination In VOL (Fig. 1 , Table 1), the central V-atom is hexa-coordinated through phenolic and enolic O-atom of the nicotinohydrazone, oxo O-atom, O-atoms of methoxy groups and imine N-atom. The geometry around the coordination sphere of V-atom is slightly distorted octahedral in which equatorial sites are occupied by (N1/O1/O2/O5) atoms whereas apical sites are occupied by (O3/O4) atoms. Central V-atom is deviated by 0.3057 (1) Å from the mean plane defined by equatorial atoms whereas O-atom of oxo group (O3) and O-atom of methoxy group (O5) are deviated by 1.8913 (3) and −2.0206 (3) Å, respectively from mean plane defined by equatorial atoms. The hydrazone ligand coordinates to the vanadium metal in the dianionic form as evident from N1–C7 and O1–C1 bond lengths of 1.285(3) and 1.327(3) Å, respectively. These abnormal bond values indicate the presence of the enolate form of the amide groups. The V–O, V–N, and V = O bond lengths are within normal ranges and are comparable to those observed in similar oxovanadium(V) complexes [73-75]. Nitrophenyl ring A (C1-C6/N4/O6/O7) and pyridine ring B (C9-C13/N3) are found to be planar with respective r.m.s (root mean square) deviation of 0.0080 and 0.0068 Å with dihedral angle of 5.45 (2)° between ring A and B. This dihedral angle indicates that ring A and B are almost parallel to each other. The molecules are connected with each other in the form of dimers through OH…N bonding to form R 2 2 ( 16 ) loop (Fig. 2 ). The dimers are interlinked through C12-H12-O1 bonding as given in Table 3. The molecules are further interlinked through more CH…O bonding named as C10-H10…O6 and C14-H14A…O7 bonding to form R 2 2 ( 12 ) loop. In addition to H-bonding, a weak interaction of the type NO…π is found between molecules related by inversion symmetry in crystal packing. This interaction assists in further strengthening of crystal packing as displayed in Fig. 3 and specified in Table 2 . In MoO2L (Fig. 4 , Table 1) the coordination geometry around the molybdenum center can be described as distorted octahedral in which two cis positions being occupied by the two oxo groups, as bond angle O3-Mo-O4 is 105.5(2)° slightly deviates from 90°, a tridentate (ONO) dianionic hydrazone Schiff base ligand and one coordinated ethanol molecule. Hence a mononuclear dioxomolybdenum complex is formed. The distance between the molybdenum atom and the oxygen atom of the ethanol molecule, Mo1-O5 of 2.290(4) Å, represents the largest bond length within the distorted octahedron. The elongated Mo1–O5 bond length trans to oxo O3 group indicates weak coordination of ethanol at the axial position which is due to the strong π-donor character of the oxo opposite to coordinated ethanol, as commonly observed in similar complexes [76]. The distortion of the octahedral coordination of the structure can also be substantiated from the bond angles related to the Mo atom. The Mo–O and Mo–N bond lengths in the complex are comparable to those observed in other oxomolybdenum complexes with hydrazone ligands [76-78]. In accordance with the previously reported studies, the bond lengths of the N1–N2 [1.1.385(6) Ǻ] and iminic N1–C7 [1.280(6) Ǻ] groups were increased upon coordination to molybdenum center. The two Mo = O bond distances and the subtended O(3) = Mo(1) = O(4) are comparable to the previously reported molybdenum complexes in literature [76-78]. Nitrophenyl ring A (C1-C6/N4/O6/O7) and pyridine ring B (C9-C13/N3) are found to be planar with respective r.m.s (root mean square) deviation of 0.0746 and 0.0092 Å with dihedral angle of 11.9 (2)° between ring A and B. The molecules are connected with each through OH···N bonding to form a C8 chain that extends along the b crystallographic axis, where OH is from ethanol and acceptor N-atom is from a pyridine ring as displayed in Fig. 5 and specified in Table 2. These C8 chains are interlinked with each other through CH…O bonding in which the O-atom of one of the oxo groups acts as acceptor. Due to CH…O bonding, a C7 chain is formed that extends along the b crystallographic axis. Crystal Explorer version 17.5 is employed in order to perform Hirshfeld surface analysis which gives useful information about the non-covalent interactions of molecules with neighboring ones which are responsible for crystal packing [79]. These intermolecular interactions can be displayed on HS by color coding and by plotting the HS over dnorm [80-83]. The atomic contacts having distance shorter, equal and longer than summation of van der Waals radii are represented by red, white and blue regions on HS, respectively. Bright red spot-on HS near the N-atom of the pyridine ring is obvious for both compounds indicates that this N-atom is involved in strong intermolecular interaction as shown in Fig. 6 a and 6b. On HS of VOL, bright red spot is present near OH of methanol (O5/H5A/C15) indicating that this is involved in H-bonding whereas on HS of MoO2L, bright red spot is present near OH of ethanol (O5/H5A/C14/C15) indicating that this is involved in H-bonding as displayed in Fig. 6b. For both compounds, absence of red spots on HS near the N-atom of the nitro group and near imine N-atom indicate that these atoms are not engaged in H-bonding. Light red spots are present on the HS near the atoms which are involved in comparably weak bonding of type CH…O for both compounds. 2D fingerprint plot is an efficient way for quantitative analysis of intermolecular interactions [84-89]. Fingerprint plots empower us to compute the percentage contribution of each interatomic contact in crystal packing. 2D plot for overall interactions for VOL and MoO2L are displayed in Fig. 7 a and 8a, respectively, in which all the interatomic contacts are determined including the reciprocal contacts as well. de and di represent distance from the HS to the nearest nucleus outside and inside the HS, respectively. H…H interatomic contact is found to be the greatest contributor in crystal packing of VOL with percentage contribution of 36.1% (Fig. 7b), whereas O…H interatomic contact is found to be the greatest contributor in crystal packing for MoO2L with percentage contribution of 40% (Fig. 8 b). For VOL, irrespective to most significant contributor in crystal packing, the other interatomic contacts that contribute in crystal packing are O…H, C…H, N…H, C…C, O…C, N…C, O…N, N…N and O…O with percentage contribution of 31.3%, 10.9%, 5.9%, 4.2%, 3.9%, 3.7%, 2.1%, 1.4% and 0.5% as displayed in Fig. 7(c-k), respectively. In crystal packing of MoO2L, in addition to O…H interatomic contact, the other interatomic contacts for crystal packing are H…H, N…H, C…H, N…C, O…O, O…C and O…N with percentage contribution of 28.5%, 8.1%, 7.4%, 6.9%, 3.7%, 2.1%, 2% and 1.2% as displayed in Fig. 8(c-j). In order to investigate the interaction of an atom present inside the HS to all the atoms of molecules located in the surrounding of HS, 2D plots of corresponding HS are employed. It is found that H-atoms present inside the HS have stronger interaction with all the atoms of molecules located in the surrounding of HS as compared to other atoms present in HS for both compounds. Percentage contribution of H-ALL interaction is 57.8% (Fig. 9 a) and 53.7% (Fig. 9b) for VOL and MoO2L, respectively. Other such interactions are O-ALL, C-ALL and N-ALL with percentage contributions of 26.4%, 14.2%, 7.4% (Fig. 9a) for VOL, respectively and 24.9%, 14.4%, 7% (Fig. 9b) for MoO2L, respectively. Furthermore, the interaction of all the atoms present inside the HS to an atom located in the surrounding of HS is employed by utilizing HS and 2D plots. ALL-H interaction is found to be the most important contributor in crystal packing for both compounds with percentage contribution of 62.3% (Fig. 10 a) and 59.4% (Fig. 10b) for VOL and MoO2L, respectively. Other such interactions are ALL-O, ALL-C and ALL-N with percentage contributions of 18%, 12.4%, 7.1% (Fig. 10a) for VOL, respectively and 21.7%, 12.9%, 6% (Fig. 10b) for MoO2L, respectively."
10,Optimized structural parameters,"3.3 Optimized structural parameters DFT methods were used to determine and analyze the structure of ligand and its complexes at the B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level of theory in the gas phase. The optimized structures of compounds are presented in Fig. 11 and selected experimental and theoretical structural parameters including bond lengths and bond angles of the complexes are gathered in Table 3. It is obvious Table 3 that the theoretical data are quite comparable to the experimental findings. The differences between the theoretical and experimental values may be emanated from this fact that the experimental data belong to the solid state, while the calculated values describe a single molecule in the gaseous state. In accordance with X-ray crystal structures, the coordination of nitrogen and oxygen atoms to the metal center of V and Mo complexes in the gas phase exhibit the distorted octahedral geometry."
11,FT-IR spectra,"3.4 FT-IR spectra The FT-IR spectra of the Schiff base ligand and its oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum complexes are shown in Fig. 12 . A careful comparison of the spectra of the synthesized compounds was carried out to look deeply into the sites of coordination of ligands with metals. The FT-IR spectrum of the ligand shows two bands in the region of 3302 and 1631 cm−1 which correspond to the stretching vibrations of the ν(NH) and ν(CO). These bands disappear in the spectra of the complexes which is in accordance with the enolization of the amide functional group and succeeding the deprotonation to get attached with metal ions. The X-ray diffraction data also confirm the same mode of coordination of the ligand. The particular stretching vibration of azomethine group (–HC = N) in ligand appears at 1600 cm−1 also shows a slight shift on complexation. New bands emerging at 1263 and 1313 cm−1 are attributed to enolic ν(CO) moiety in molybdenum and vanadium complexes, respectively. The appearance of two new bands at 916 and 933 cm−1 are assigned to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the cis-Mo(O)2 moiety which are in accordance with similar structures reported previously in literature [90,91]. Similarly, oxovanadium complex also gives its characteristics peak of V = O at 918 cm−1 which is very close to the values of similar oxovanadium Schiff base complexes already reported in literature [92-94]. In addition, some new M−O and M−N peaks are also visible at 597 & 476 cm−1 for Mo complex and at 580 & 457 cm−1 for V complex, respectively. These values are also in agreement to the similar reported complexes [92-95]. Typical selected experimental and calculated vibrational modes of the ligand and its oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum complexes are listed in Table 4 . Theoretical calculations exhibit good agreement with experimental results."
12,1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra,"3.5 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of the H2L, VOL and MoO2L complex recorded in DMSO‑d6 are presented in the experimental section and the spectra are shown in Figures S1-S6. Two signals, appearing at δ = 12.35 and 12.09 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of the ligand correspond to OH (phenolic) and NH protons, respectively, disappear upon reaction with V and Mo salts. This disappearance demonstrates that the phenolate and enolate oxygens are the sites of coordination of the ligand with the metals. This also ascertains the occurrence of keto-imine tautomerism upon complexation. Moreover, a singlet for azomethine proton (–HC = N) at δ = 8.71 ppm observed in the spectra of the ligand was shifted downfield at δ = 9.09 ppm in VOL and δ = 9.19 ppm in MoO2L showing the deshielding due to the decrease in the electronic density upon the coordination of azomethine nitrogen with the metal ion. All the signals for aromatic protons in the 1H NMR spectrum of the ligand were observed in the expected range of δ = 7.08–9.09 ppm. There is a slight shift in the positions of aromatic protons signals of the ligand upon complex formation (δ = 7.11–9.25 ppm in VOL and δ = 7.17–9.19 ppm in MoO2L). The 13C NMR spectra of the ligand and its V and Mo complexes are shown in Figures S4-S6. The signals for the carbonyl, phenolic and methine carbon in the V complex were observed at δ = 167.8, 158.2 and 155.9 ppm, respectively and in the Mo complex were observed at δ = 167.8, 163.9 and 156.0 ppm, respectively. The chemical shift values of the carbons present in vicinity of the coordinating atoms (i.e., C8, C1 and C7) showed appreciable change in their position due to coordination-induced shifts confirming the association of these functionalities in coordination. The other aromatic carbons of ligand and its complexes appeared in their respective regions according to the literature. Hence, 13C NMR spectra also support the conclusions derived from 1H NMR spectral data. The experimental and calculated 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift values of the ligand and complexes are given in Table 5 ."
13,Mulliken atomic charges distribution,"3.6 Mulliken atomic charges distribution The calculated Mulliken charges for ligand and its oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum complexes are listed in Table 6 . The Mulliken charges at the central atoms are + 1.034e for V complex and + 1.477e for Mo complex. The charges on the metal atoms are considerably lower than the formal charges, 5 + and 6 + for vanadium and molybdenum, respectively, which indicate that the significant amount of charge density is transferred from the ligand to the metal atoms. Also, the highest charge density in the ligand was found on C1 and C8, while after the complexation, charge density on C1 in the gas phase increases from 0.204 to 0.360 and 0.397, and charge density on C8 in the gas phase increases from 0.290 to 0.355 and 0.429 in the VOL and MoO2L complexes, respectively."
14,Electronic properties,"3.7 Electronic properties In order to acquire the electronic distribution of frontier orbitals, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the ligand and its complexes, were calculated at B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level of theory. The results are presented in Fig. 13 while the HOMO and LUMO orbital energies and energy gaps (ΔE) for the compounds are given in Table 7 . As shown in Table 7, the energy gaps for the H2L (keto), H2L (enol), VOL and MoO2L were found to be 4.250, 4.041, 3.307 and 3.688 eV, respectively. The energy gap of H2L (keto) is slightly greater than H2L (enol), which can be attributed to higher stability of keto tautomeric form of the ligand. To investigate the linkage between molecular structure and physicochemical property of molecules, the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) can be used. The MEP can show electrophilic sites (positive regions) and nucleophilic sites (negative regions) of the molecule based on their electrostatic potentials which are illustrated by blue and red colors, respectively. The MEP diagrams and values of electrostatic potentials of ligand and its V and Mo complexes are shown in Fig. 14 . There is a significant difference between electrostatic potential values of enol and keto forms of H2L ligand. In keto form, the more negative site is located between phenolic and carbonylic oxygen atoms, with electrostatic values of ~ 61 kcal.mol−1, while in enol form, the blue color can be seen between two hydroxyl groups which means this area has the positive electrostatic potential (~46 kcal.mol−1). In the oxovanadium and dioxomolybdenum complexes with electrostatic potential values of ~ 34 and ~ 54 kcal.mol−1, respectively, the metal atom is the center of positive potential represented by blue color which means it is a good candidate for the attack by a nucleophile. These results are in agreement with the Mulliken atomic charges (Table 6). The sum of the electronic and the zero-point energy (E ZPE), enthalpy (H), and Gibbs free energy of both enol and keto forms of H2L Schiff base ligand are presented in Table 8 . The data showed that keto form is more stable in both, gas and solution phases. This result is consistent with the findings from the molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) values and from the comparison of energy gaps between HOMO and LUMO of keto and enol tautomeric forms of the ligand (See Figs. 13 and 14)."
15,Catalytic activity studies,"3.8 Catalytic activity studies Vanadium and molybdenum complexes have been used as catalysts for various organic reactions [74,97]. With comparison to reported species, the present two complexes have excellent performance. Catalytic abilities of VOL and MoO2L complexes have been studied in the oxidation reactions of benzylic alcohols. The oxidation of 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol using urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP), which cannot proceed in the absence of catalyst under mild and reflux conditions, was used as a model reaction. To find the optimum reaction conditions, the influence of different factors that may affect the conversion of the reaction was investigated. A systematic examination of oxidation of 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol in various solvents such as ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride were carried out in the presence of 0.006 mmol of V/Mo complexes catalysts. Keeping in mind the yield and reaction rate, acetonitrile was found to be the best solvent, which under reflux conditions, can complete the reaction in the desired period of time (Table 9 ). Considering our observations, higher reaction temperature has an overall benefit to achieve the better yield and hence the reactions under reflux conditions can be completed within 10 min. for VOL complex and 2 h for MoO2L complex. Similar findings about the association of higher reaction temperature with improved yields have also been reported earlier [98]. Among the screened oxidants, including NaIO4, H2O2, UHP, Bu4NIO4 and tert-BuOOH for the oxidation of 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol using VOL and MoO2L complexes, UHP was found to be the best source of oxygen (Table 10 ). Different amounts of the catalyst have been used for the oxidation of 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol with UHP in acetonitrile under reflux conditions (Table 11 ). It was observed that the subjected oxidation process requires 10 min. for completion by using 0.006 mmol of the V complex catalyst and an increase in this amount did not noticeably effect on the reaction rate and product yield. The optimized amount of the Mo complex catalyst was the same in this reaction, with the exception of longer reaction time (2 h). After investigation of the optimal conditions, we have explored that the substrate scope of the newly developed V and Mo complexes as catalyst, under the optimum condition, for the selective oxidation of a wide range of benzylic alcohols carrying electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups to their corresponding substituted benzaldehydes. The results are summarized in Table 12 . The chemoselectivity of the method was notable. The oxidative hydroxyl group was tolerated under the influence of this catalytic system and the corresponding aldehyde was obtained in 100% selectivity. The beauty of the protocol is that no overoxidation to benzoic acid took place with all the studied substrates. In addition, in the case of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, the benzyl hydroxyl group is selectively oxidized and while the phenolic hydroxyl group does not react at all. In order to further clarify the efficiency of the catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) is also calculated and given in Table 12. Based on experimental results and related literature [99], for the oxidation reactions mediated by oxometal complexes, a plausible mechanism for oxidation of benzyl alcohol with UHP catalyzed by VOL Schiff base complex is proposed in Scheme 3 . The catalyst, VOL which is an oxovanadium(V) complex, is inactive as such in the oxidation process. As shown in the MEP diagram of VOL and also previously mentioned, the metal atom in the complex is electropositive and can be attacked by nucleophiles. Thus, the VOL complex reacts with a hydrogen peroxide molecule released from UHP to form the peroxovanadium species (Intermediate 1). The peroxovanadium is active in oxidation and after etherification of OH group in intermediate 1 by benzyl alcohol, intermediate 2 is produced. Finally, this intermediate oxides benzyl alcohol to release one molecule of H2O to give benzaldehyde as the target product and regenerates the VOL Schiff base complex. A similar mechanism can also be drawn for the MoO2L complex. The sum of the electronic and the zero-point energy (E ZPE), enthalpy (H), and Gibbs free energy of all the materials involved in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using UHP in the presence of VOL catalyst are listed in Table 13 . By use of these values, ΔE ZPE, ΔH and ΔG of all steps for this reaction were calculated (Table 14 ). As shown in Table 13, the first step of the reaction is endothermic (ΔG = 29.49 kcal.mol−1) and can be carried out at 82 °C. The last step of the reaction is exothermic (ΔG = -112.95 kcal.mol−1) and overall, the reaction is exothermic."
16,Conclusion,A new tridentate ONO-donor Schiff base ligand and its V(V) and Mo(VI) complexes were synthesized and characterized by various physicochemical techniques. The molecular structures of complexes were determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The coordination geometry around V and Mo metal centers was described better as distorted octahedral. Theoretical calculations of the Schiff base ligand and its V and Mo complexes were performed by DFT at B3LYP level with Def2-TZVP basis set and it was found that the theoretical data is in good agreement with the experimental results. The catalytic activity of the complexes was also performed by the oxidation of benzylic alcohols with UHP in acetonitrile. The present method offers various advantages such as high yield of the products and short interval of time for completion of reaction.
