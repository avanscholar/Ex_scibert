0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes represents an important step in many fine chemical processes, since the desired products, unsaturated alcohols, are widely used in the fragrance and drug industries [1]. In the study of selectivity in this process, citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal) is considered to represent a model molecule since it presents three possible hydrogenation targets: a carbonyl group, a CC bond conjugated with the carbonyl group, and an isolated CC bond (Fig. 1 ). The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in an aqueous gas/liquid/liquid-multiphase catalytic system has previously been investigated in the context of capillary microreactors with channel diameters in the range of 500–1000μm [2]. In the various studies reported to date, a variety of methods has been attempted in order to improve the selectivity of the semihydrogenation reaction towards the unsaturated alcohol."
1,Addition of electropositive metal,"1.1 Addition of electropositive metal The modification of noble metal (Pt, Rh) [1] catalysts by the inclusion of a more electropositive metal (such as Sn) can increase both the selectivity of the formation of unsaturated alcohols [3–6] and catalyst stability [7]. Several mechanisms, explaining the positive effect of Sn addition on catalyst performance, have been reported [3,4,8]. The possible existence of Sn n+ ions on the surface of the noble metal nanoparticles that promote aldehyde coordination to the active site via the CO bond has also been postulated [8–10]. More recently, a new concept accounting for the rate-limiting step was proposed in [11,12]. The authors were able to show that, according to energy barrier calculations, the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohols was controlled by the rate of desorption of the partially hydrogenated products. In such cases, the catalyst favored the attack at the CO group in the adsorbed molecule to yield the unsaturated alcohol, whereas the activation energy for desorption was much lower for citronellal as compared to that for the unsaturated alcohol. These calculations showed that the desorption energy of the product was the critical tuning parameter for achieving selectivity in the reaction."
2,Supported titania catalysts doped with Au nanoparticles,"1.2 Supported titania catalysts doped with Au nanoparticles The use of supported Au nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalysis has been attracting much attention [13]. Although the overall rate of the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by Au is lower as compared to the reaction rates achievable with Pd and Pt catalysts [14], the application of Au catalysts in selective hydrogenations, where the selectivity is of primary importance, would nevertheless be promising. In the literature, several authors have applied supported Au catalysts to the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones [15–19]. An Au/TiO2 catalyst is less active than a Pt/TiO2 catalyst in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, but the former is highly selective for the production of the corresponding unsaturated alcohol, crotyl alcohol [15,17,19]. It is also reported that the hydrogenation reaction over Au/TiO2 catalysts is structure sensitive. The specific activity (turnover frequency) of small Au nanoparticles of 2nm mean size is larger by a factor of 7 as compared with that of larger Au nanoparticles of 4–9nm mean size. The practical application of Au catalysts for hydrogenation reactions remains a promising possibility. However, no comprehensive kinetics studies have been performed to date. Mesoporous titania films have recently been used as a catalyst support for metal nanoparticles due to their narrow pore size distribution, favorable surface acidic properties, and excellent chemical stability [20,21]. Recently we have shown that Pd and Au metal nanoparticles deposited onto mesoporous supports are efficient catalysts in fine chemicals synthesis, such as hydrogenations of acetylene alcohols and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes as well as in hydrogen clean-up technologies [21–24]. Several groups have performed the catalytic hydrogenation of citral. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) reaction kinetic model is usually applied to describe experimental data [25]. The hydrogenation step at the catalyst surface is assumed to be the rate-determining step, whereas the adsorption and desorption steps are supposed to be relatively fast. Furthermore, competitive adsorption of the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and its hydrogenated products with dissociative hydrogen adsorption is usually assumed [26]. Two LH models for hydrogenation of citral and its hydrogenated products were proposed in Ref. [27]. The first model is based on the competitive adsorption of the hydrogen atom and the organic substrate at a single site being followed by the addition of a second hydrogen atom to the reactant as the rate-determining step. The second model considers two different adsorption sites. Of the two, the first model showed the best fit with the experimental data for hydrogenation of citral, geraniol, nerol and citronellol. According to previously reported data, the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using Pt, Ir and Rh catalysts is a first-order reaction in hydrogen for citral [1], cinnamaldehyde [28] and acetophenone [29] hydrogenation at 298–373K and a hydrogen pressure of 5–40bar. This is indicative of the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen on the metal surface. The reaction order in the aldehyde was found to vary from −2 to 0.4. The negative-order dependences in aldehyde hydrogenation were explained by partial deactivation of the catalyst by CO, which is formed during decarbonylation of the aldehyde [25,30,31]. In the present study, the kinetics of the hydrogenation of citral and the identities of its hydrogenation products were studied over Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin films supported on the interior walls of SiO2 capillaries. The gas and liquid flows were fed into the capillary where an annular flow regime was created to avoid mass transfer limitations. The effect of the reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, citral concentration and catalyst composition was studied in order to obtain an experimental kinetic law over the Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin films. A suitable kinetic model is proposed to describe the experimental data."
3,Experimental,
4,Preparation of a SiO2-supported Au/TiO2 thin film,"2.1 Preparation of a SiO2-supported Au/TiO2 thin film Colloidal gold nanoparticles of calibrated particle size were synthesized as described in previous work following the reduction-by-solvent method [32] using NaAuCl4 as a precursor and poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone as a protecting agent. This yielded nanoparticles with an average size of 4.5±0.5nm. Gold-doped mesoporous titania films were prepared by one-pot synthesis using a precursor solution with the following molar composition: 1 Ti(O–2Pr)4:0.009 Pluronic F127:40 EtOH:1.3 H2O:0.13 HNO3:0.0041 Au. The amount of Au colloid solution was chosen such as to obtain 1wt.% Au in the catalyst assuming 100% uptake. Fused silica capillaries (250μm i.d., 10m length, Varian Inc.) were used as substrates. To enhance the adhesion qualities of the channel wall during the coating the capillary was pretreated by 1M NaOH solution at 343K for 2h. Then the capillary was consecutively washed with water and ethanol at room temperature. After 2h aging, the Au/TiO2 sol was used to dip-coat the internal surface of the pretreated capillary at a rate of ca. 1cms−1. The resulting capillary was calcined in a vacuum furnace at 573K under a residual pressure of 10mbar in order to minimize sintering of the Au particles. A similar coating was deposited on 1cm×1cm flat silicon substrates in order to perform characterization."
5,Preparation of a SiO2-supported Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin film,"2.2 Preparation of a SiO2-supported Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin film The Pt–Sn bimetallic clusters were synthesized by a procedure previously described in detail [33]. Mesoporous titania films were prepared with the following molar composition: 1 Ti(O–2Pr)4:0.009 Pluronic F127:40 EtOH:1.3H2O:0.13 HNO3 according to the procedure given in Ref. [24]. After aging, the mixture was used to dip-coat the internal surface of the pretreated capillary at a rate of ca. 1cms−1. The capillary was calcined in a vacuum furnace at 573K under a residual pressure of 10mbar. For the incorporation of the Pt–Sn catalysts on the titania film, a TiO2 coated capillary was flushed with an ethanol solution (2mg(Pt)ml−1, 1.2mg(Sn)ml−1) of the Pt–Sn mixed metal cluster [ P t 3 ( CO ) 3 ( SnCl 3 ) 2 ( SnCl 2 ⋅ H 2 O ) ] n − 2 n for 5h at a rate of ca. 1cms−1. After adsorption, the capillary was washed with ethanol and heated at 463K under a residual pressure of 10mbar. A similar coating was deposited on 1cm×1cm flat silicon substrates in order to perform characterization."
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The average Pt–Sn and Au nanoparticle size and the particle size distribution (PSD) were determined with a high-resolution JEOL JEM-2010 transition electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200kV and with a structural resolution of 0.14nm. The scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) were obtained on a Quanta 3D FEG microscope at 30kV with a resolution of 1.2nm. The open porosity and the mean pore size were determined from ethanol adsorption/desorption isotherms by ellipsometric porosimetry as described elsewhere [24]. The XPS measurements of the Pt–Sn/TiO2 catalytic films were carried out with a Kratos AXIS Ultra spectrometer, equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and a delay-line detector (DLD). Spectra were obtained using an aluminium anode (Al Kα=1486.6eV) operating at 150W. The background pressure was 2×10−9 mbar. The active metal loadings were determined by ICP-OES with SPECTRO CIROSCCD spectrometer operating at 27.12MHz, 1400W."
7,Catalytic activity tests,"2.4 Catalytic activity tests A two-phase flow composed of 0.25–10molm−3 citral (97wt.%, Fluka) in 2-propanol (99.5wt.%, Sigma–Aldrich) and a mixture of hydrogen (99.999vol.%, The Linde Group) in nitrogen (99.995vol.%, The Linde Group) was generated by employing a T-mixer (internal diameter 0.150mm, IDEX®) prior to the capillary. The liquid flow was varied between 3 and 30μlmin−1 and the gaseous flow was varied between 0.2 and 1.0mlmin−1 (STP), such that the flow was in the annular regime [34], whereby the gas core flows through the center of the capillary and the liquid flows as a film near the walls. The temperature was varied in the range 313–353K. Samples were collected at the outlet of the capillary and analyzed on a GC Varian CP-3800 equipped with a CP-Sil 5 CB capillary column. The main reaction products noted were nerol, geraniol, citronellol, citronellal, isopulegol, and 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol (Fig. 1). The carbon balance was closed within 99%. Prior to the experiments the catalysts were reduced in situ under a hydrogen flow of 1mlmin−1 at a temperature of 473K for 2h. For the evaluation of the kinetic and adsorption constants, the hydrogenations of unsaturated alcohols (mixture of geraniol and nerol), citronellol and citronellal were performed separately. The flow of 0.5molm−3 solutions in 2-propanol was varied between 6 and 15μlmin−1 and the gas flow was set at 1mlmin−1 (STP). The gas hold-up and the liquid residence time were calculated according to the Lockhart–Martinelli–Chisholm correlation [35]. Conversion (X) and selectivities towards the reaction products (S i ) were calculated as follows: X = 100 ⋅ n n 0 , S i = 100 ⋅ n i n , where n is the amount of reactant converted to product(s), n 0 is the initial amount of reactant, and n i is the amount of product formed."
8,Kinetic model,"2.5 Kinetic model The kinetic model used excludes reactant mass transfer, which was much faster as compared to the overall reaction rate. The maximum value of the overall mass transfer coefficient in a Pd/TiO2 coated capillary microreactor of 0.01 m L 3 m R − 3 s − 1 is already established as being rather low as compared with other gas–liquid–solid reactors (typically 0.1 m L 3 m R − 3 s − 1 ) [23]. However, the Hatta number in capillary microreactors is below 0.1, and often as small as 0.01, demonstrating that the catalytic reaction occurs in the kinetic regime, with the hydrogenation step at the catalyst surface considered to be rate-limiting. As hydrogen molecules are much smaller than the organic ones, it is reasonable to propose that some interstitial adsorption sites are available for hydrogen molecules. Therefore the adsorption behavior can be considered to be a noncompetitive one. The kinetic models for the hydrogenation of citral, citronellal, citronellol and the nerol/geraniol mixture on the Au/TiO2 and/or Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin films are listed in Table 1 . The kinetic parameters were obtained by using regression analysis to minimize the residual sum of squares between the experimental and calculated concentrations at the reactor outlet using Athena Visual Studio Inc. software, version 14.0.0.0. All experimental data were treated with equal statistical weights."
9,Results and discussion,"The thickness of the Au/TiO2 film was 90±10nm according to SEM analysis. The mean deposited Au particle size was found to be 4.5±0.5nm by TEM measurements. The mean pore size of the titania support, as determined by ellipsometric porosimetry, was 3.5nm. The Au-impregnated film showed a smaller mean pore size of 3.1nm as compared to that of the nanoparticle-free titania support, which we attribute to partial pore blockage by the Au nanoparticles [24]. The nanoparticle size in the Pt–Sn/TiO2 film deposited inside the capillary was found to be 1.9±0.2nm (Fig. 2a), which is close to the mean nanoparticle size noted (2.2±0.1nm) if an analogous film is deposited on a flat SiO2 substrate under the same conditions (Fig. 2b). The Pt and Sn loadings were determined by ICP-OES and were found to be 0.95 and 0.51wt.% for Pt and Sn, respectively. Pt/Sn bulk and surface ratios were determined by ICP-OES and XPS and were found to be 0.88 and 0.85, respectively. The XP spectra of the Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 films were registered on a flat silicon plates. The Pt–Sn/TiO2 film was obtained via adsorption of Pt–Sn clusters for 5h on the mesoporous TiO2 film deposited on a silicon plate. The XP spectrum of the Pt 4f region for the Pt–Sn/TiO2 catalytic film is shown in Fig. 3a. The spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks, the one at lower binding energy corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 level and the second one, at higher binding energy, to the Pt 4f5/2 level. The peaks are centered at 71.0 and 74.3eV, and they are assigned to metallic platinum species. Additionally, in the measured spectra two small peaks are observed at 74.9 and 78.1eV. These peaks can be assigned to Pt(IV) according to the literature data. Thus, it has been reported that the binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level for Pt(IV) is approximately 74.5–75.3eV [36,37]. The Sn 3d5/2 spectrum is plotted in Fig. 3b. The band observed at 486.0eV is assigned to oxidized tin species (Sn(II)/Sn(IV)). Discrimination between Sn(II) and Sn(IV) species by XPS is difficult because the difference in binding energy values is <0.5eV [38]. The second band appeared at lower binding energy (485.1eV), which is characteristic of metallic tin. The catalyst reveals tin in both its oxidized and metallic states. The presence of metallic tin in the catalysts indicates the possibility that the Pt–Sn alloy phases exist, although this cannot be readily assessed by XPS [36]. The XP spectrum of the Au 4f region for the Au/TiO2 catalytic film is shown in Fig. 3c. The peaks of Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 are centered at 83.5 and 87.1. They are assigned to Au(0) [39]."
10,Effect of the liquid residence time,"3.1 Effect of the liquid residence time 3.1.1 Au/TiO2 thin film on SiO2 A systematic study of the effect of liquid residence time on the conversion and selectivity was performed on the Au/TiO2 thin film deposited on the interior walls of a silica capillary. The rate of citronellol hydrogenation to 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol was studied in order to find reaction constant k 5 and adsorption constants K COL and K DMOL (Fig. 4 ). Thereafter, the hydrogenation of an equimolar mixture of geraniol and nerol was studied in order to find the reaction constant k 4 and the adsorption constant K UCOL (Fig. 5 ), the other kinetic parameters being fixed. No isomerization of the nerol/geraniol mixture to citronellal was observed during these experiments. Citral conversion and selectivity with which unsaturated alcohols were obtained are shown as a function of the liquid residence time in Fig. 6 . The citral conversion monotonously increased from 7 to 37% with increasing of the liquid residence time from 600 to 2900s. Meanwhile, the selectivity towards nerol/geraniol reduced from 94 to 85% at higher citral conversions. This is in agreement with previously reported results on the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene using a Pd/TiO2 catalyst [23]. The LH kinetic parameters for the reaction undertaken using Au/TiO2 are listed in Table 2 . It can be seen from the parity plot that the difference between the experimental and calculated data conversion and selectivities is <10% (Fig. 7 ). The K citral/K UCOL ratio of 3.7 is close to that reported elsewhere for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols at 383K over a Pd/C catalyst [40]. Clearly Au/TiO2 supported on SiO2 represents both a highly active and selective catalyst for the hydrogenation of citral. The formation of citronellal, the thermodynamically favored product, was not observed under any of a wide range of reaction conditions studied (Fig. 8 ). The possibility of citronellal formation and its subsequent fast hydrogenation to citronellol was investigated in a separate series of experiments in which citronellal was hydrogenated. Both citronellol and isopulegol were formed during citronellal hydrogenation (Fig. 9 ), while isopulegol was not observed in citral hydrogenation (Fig. 8). Isopulegol represents the product of citronellal cyclization over Broensted acid sites, which are present on the titania support [24,41]. Thus, citronellal seems not to be formed over the Au/TiO2 films. The selectivity with which unsaturated alcohols form decreases at higher liquid residence times as the result of consecutive hydrogenation reactions to citronellol and 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol. The kinetic parameters for citronellal hydrogenation are listed in Table 2. It can be seen from the parity plot, that the experimental data for citronellal consumption and isopulegol and citronellol formation are described by the LH model to within an accuracy of ±12% (Fig. 10 ). The k 3 value corresponding to citronellol formation from citronellal is an order of magnitude higher than the k 4 value corresponding to citronellol formation from unsaturated alcohols (Table 2). It is clear, therefore, that by preventing citronellal formation, the Au/TiO2 catalyst prevents its further fast hydrogenation to citronellol, and thus increases the selectivity of the reaction towards the unsaturated alcohols. 3.1.2 Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin film on SiO2 The reaction kinetics of citral hydrogenation over a Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin film on the inner walls of a SiO2 capillary were investigated, with shorter liquid residence times than were used for Au/TiO2 allowing achievement of the same level of reactant conversion as was seen in that system (see above). The results are listed in Fig. 11 . Overall, trends noted over Pt–Sn/TiO2 were similar to those observed over Au/TiO2. Geraniol and nerol were the main hydrogenation products over the Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin film, with a selectivity as high as 97% observed. Citronellal and citronellol were present to only minor levels (Figs. 8 and 12 ). Increasing the liquid residence time from 400 to 1100s showed a citral conversion increase from 29 to 98% and a decrease in selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols from 97 to 80%. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that use of the Pt–Sn/TiO2 film allowed a considerably higher yield of the unsaturated alcohols, with 79% formation noted under similar conditions to those that gave a 15% yield when Au/TiO2 was employed (Fig. 6). Hydrogenation of the unsaturated alcohols to citronellol is responsible for a lower selectivity to UCOL at higher citral conversion in the Pt–Sn/TiO2 system. The reaction kinetics can be described with a LH model using the parameters listed in Table 3 . The adsorption constants for citral onto the Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 films tested were 28 and 50m3 mol−1, respectively. These values are both close to those previously reported for cinnamaldehyde (20–30m3 mol−1) onto a Pd/C catalyst [26,40]. The K citral/K UCOL ratio achieved over the Pt–Sn/TiO2 film is two orders of magnitude higher than that reported when Au/TiO2 is used, mainly because of the difference in K UCOL (7.0×10−2 and 7.5 for Pt–Sn/TiO2 and Au/TiO2, respectively). The relative values of the adsorption equilibrium constants are in good agreement with those previously reported [42]: K citral > K CAL > K UCOL > K COL > K DMOL. The adsorption constant of 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol was fixed at 1×10−3 m3 mol−l. Since 3,7-dimethyloctanol has no unsaturated bonds, its adsorption equilibrium constant should be significantly lower than those of compounds such as citral, citronellal, and the unsaturated alcohols, which contain CC bonds [42]. The selectivity of hydrogenation towards the unsaturated alcohols over Pt–Sn/TiO2 is 7% higher than that achieved over Au/TiO2 at the same citral conversion of 27% (Figs. 6 and 11). This can be explained by a higher k 1/k 4 ratio of 0.50 over Pt–Sn/TiO2 as compared with that of 0.36 over Au/TiO2 (see Tables 2 and 3). Furthermore, an almost two orders of magnitude higher K citral/K UCOL ratio over Pt–Sn/TiO2 as compared to Au/TiO2 is consistent with prevention of the adsorption of unsaturated alcohols onto the Pt–Sn/TiO2 catalyst until almost all of the citral has been consumed. This prevents the subsequent hydrogenation of a geraniol/nerol mixture and keeps a high selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohols prior to citral being depleted. The LH model describes the experimental data over the whole range of reaction conditions studied here to within an accuracy of 10%, as can be seen from the parity plot presented in Fig. 13 ."
11,"Effect of the reaction temperature, hydrogen partial pressure and initial citral concentration","3.2 Effect of the reaction temperature, hydrogen partial pressure and initial citral concentration The kinetics of hydrogenation over both Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 films was studied in the temperature range of 313–353K (Fig. 14a and b). The apparent activation energies, calculated from Arrhenius plots (Fig. 14c and d) of the citral hydrogenation reaction over the Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 films were found to be 91±8 and 35±9kJmol−1, respectively. The value obtained over the Au/TiO2 catalyst is significantly higher than those of 31kJmol−1 [43] and 75kJmol−1 [44] previously reported. Rapid deactivation of the Au/TiO2 films was observed at 353K, with citral consumption rate decreasing to zero. However, the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 could be fully restored by regeneration at 573K in air for 2h. The selectivity towards unsaturated alcohol formation increased from 81 to 93% over Au/TiO2 as the temperature was increased from 338 to 348K (Fig. 14). This result is in good agreement with previously reported data indicating that the product distribution significantly depends on the reaction temperature. Hence, at a citral conversion of 30%, the selectivity towards geraniol and nerol has been previously found to increase from 21 to 72% as the temperature was raised from 298 to 373K [45]. Meanwhile, formation of the saturated aldehyde is known to be favored at reaction temperatures around 298K [42]. The selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols over Pt–Sn/TiO2 is found to decrease with increasing temperature. At citral conversions above 60%, the rate of subsequent hydrogenation of the unsaturated alcohols increased faster as compared with that of citral hydrogenation, resulting in a lowering of selectivity towards nerol/geraniol at temperatures above 325K. Fig. 15 shows both citral conversion and selectivities towards the main reaction products as a function of the hydrogen partial pressure over the Pt–Sn/TiO2 film on the inner walls of a SiO2 capillary. The selectivity of the reaction towards the unsaturated alcohols remains rather constant and close to 90% when hydrogen partial pressures in the range 0.2–0.8 are used. The selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols decreased to 77% at a citral conversion of 96%, which was observed when no N2 dilution was applied. These conditions correspond to those which furnished the highest yield of unsaturated alcohols (74%). The citral conversion linearly increased with the hydrogen partial pressure, demonstrating the process to be first order in hydrogen. We attribute these first order characteristics to there being weak hydrogen adsorption at the nanoparticle surface. The reaction order with respect to citral is close to zero. However, in order to determine the reaction order in citral accurately, the effect of the citral initial concentration on the reaction rate was studied using two different citral concentrations (0.25 and 0.36molm−3 over the Au/TiO2 film and 5.0 and 10.0molm−3 over the Pt–Sn/TiO2 film). Liquid flow rates were chosen such as to obtain citral conversions below 10% in order to neglect the concentration gradients along the reactor length. The subsequently observed reaction rates were (4.45±0.05)×10−8 and ( 6.45 ± 0.15 ) × 10 − 7 mol s − 1 g cat − 1 , while the reaction orders in citral were 0.07 and 0.08 over the Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 films, respectively. This is in agreement with literature data on the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes such as citral, cinnamaldehyde, and acetophenone [25]."
12,Conclusions,"The kinetics of citral hydrogenation over Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin films deposited onto the inner walls of microcapillaries has been studied. The influence of the reaction temperature, liquid residence time, initial citral concentration and hydrogen partial pressure on activity and selectivity towards the possible unsaturated alcohol products was elucidated. The highest yield of unsaturated alcohols (79%) was obtained on the Pt–Sn/TiO2 thin film at 343K, with a liquid residence time of 30min and a hydrogen partial pressure of 1. A detailed kinetic analysis of the hydrogenation of citral and its hydrogenated products, unsaturated alcohols, citronellol and citronellal, was performed. The proposed kinetic model suitably describes the kinetics of citral hydrogenation as well as of the hydrogenation of geraniol, nerol, citronellal and citronellol. The Pt–Sn/TiO2 films showed a higher yield of unsaturated alcohols under the same conditions as were used for Au/TiO2. This was explained by different k 1/k 4 and K citral/K UCOL ratios in the LH model for those systems. The reaction orders were found to be 1 for hydrogen over Pt–Sn/TiO2 film and 0.07 and 0.08 for citral over Au/TiO2 and Pt–Sn/TiO2 catalysts, respectively. In present work the potential of using wall-coated capillary microreactors for citral hydrogenation is shown. Capillary microreactors represent a promising way to reduce both the time and costs associated with chemical processes while also achieving increased selectivity and safety. The miniaturization of chemical reactors has many benefits, such as enhanced safety due to smaller volume, higher reactivity as a result of high surface area-to-volume ratio. The ease of scaling through the concept of numbering up is another advantage of capillary microreactors. The advantages of using the fused silica capillaries described here as catalytic substrates for multiphase reactions include effective product isolation from the catalysts, improved control of the catalyst-reactant contact time, and reduced waste."
