0,Introduction,"The recent scenario of the depleting natural fuels has indeed created an alarming situation for our planet. This rings the bell for definitely creating an alternative sustainable fuel. In such a scenario, hydrogen fuel production through solar energy is well considered to be one of a strategic solution for solving such a global energy crisis. Hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting would be a breakthrough as it is considered to be environmental friendly, economical and sustainable only if waste water is used. TiO2 is one such photocatalyst that has lived up to the expectation for such a theme to be materialised [1–3]. This was first achieved by Fujishma and Honda in 1972, where TiO2 electrodes were employed for water splitting reactions [4]. It was this discovery that has not only made TiO2 an indispensable tool in photocatalytic reaction but also gave hope, through more research in really finding an alternative that can be used as a clean energy fuel. A photocatalytic reaction, usually involves light absorption by the semiconductor followed by transition of electron from low energy level to high energy level. This transition is called as electron-hole separation. During this process, there is always a possibility of recombination of the charge carriers. The recombination of charge carriers before its migration to the surface results in low efficiency of the catalyst. In order, to increase the photochemical efficiency a few factors would be desirable i.e. long life of charge carrier's, less charge trapping centre (anomalous centre in the physical locality which can ""trap"" a charge carrier), proper energy level offset and stability against light. The reason for TiO2 to be broadly used as a standard photocatalyst is its high stability, low cost and toxicity, and also comparatively higher photochemical efficiency than other semiconductors [5]. However, TiO2 presents a significant challenge i.e. its less activity in visible region of solar spectrum [6,7]. This has been overcome by incorporation of metal nanoparticles exhibiting Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) or by the addition of other materials to provide a higher absorption spectrum [8–22]. In this direction, scientist have used Au-TiO2 to increase its absorption spectrum and have also used Pt, which acts as an electron sink and hence reduces the recombination rate, further increasing the efficiency of the catalyst [23–28]. As shown above, the scientific community know a lot about TiO2 in terms of its surface area, catalytic properties, band gap, and semiconductor properties etc. Similarly, in the case of graphene also where its high conductivity and high surface area is well known which help is increasing lifetime of charge carrier [29–36]. The objective of incorporating graphene with TiO2 did originate from its appropriate energy level offset (between TiO2 conduction band and above water reduction potential). Subsequent to the TiO2 photo-excitation, electron jump from TiO2 conduction band to graphene energy level and can reside there for longer time due to its high conductivity and surface area. This phenomenon finally results in achieving a higher efficiency of the water splitting. But there is a void in thorough understanding related to the combination of these two fantastic materials in terms of its synthetic procedure charge transfer and physical properties at the interface. Herein, we tried to explain and highlight some important aspects of this promising nanocomposite. We believe this would be helpful for researchers to get a concise and precise understanding of this photocatalyst i.e. TiO2/Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO). Further, we tried to elaborate modification of TiO2/RGO with metal and metal oxide. Overall we carried out comprehensive survey of all the literature related to TiO2/RGO (pristine and modified) for their physical property and comparative hydrogen production efficiency. From the comparative hydrogen production efficiency, we tried to make a conclusion about the current state of RGO as co-catalyst in increasing hydrogen production efficiency of TiO2."
1,Photocatalytic water splitting,"Basically, the term water splitting used is a given name for a chemical reaction. In this reaction, water is indeed photo catalytically cleaved (giving H2(g) and O2(g)) using two natural abundant source i.e. water and solar light [37,38]. Reaction of hydrogen and oxygen production is termed as photo reduction and oxidation of water [39]. The following is an equation that deals with the dissociation of the water molecule to yield H2 and O2 with respect to the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG): (1) H 2 O → 1 / 2O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ G = + 237 kJ / mol … … … … This definitely sounds to be a simple process, as the precursors used are simply water and solar energy. Even though the reaction seems simple, there is still a long way to go in terms of improving the efficiency. Extensive work been carried out among the scientific community in term of semiconductor band gap tuning to increase maximum absorption of solar spectra as well as to increase the charge carrier involvement in photocatalytic process. Whereas the laboratory synthesis of hydrogen is usually carried out at a temperature around 2500°C, which makes it impractical and also highly expensive for large scale production. This makes photocatalytic water splitting the most admired groom of the town by itself. Photochemical decomposition of water makes use of photons of energy 1.3eV. This energy corresponds to ~1100nm or below and is sufficient to split water. Thus facing a problem of energy barrier which is required to overcome. Hence the semiconductor indeed needs to absorb light of energy higher than 1.23eV (eV-electron volt-unit of energy) which corresponds to ≤1000nm (nm-nanometer-unit of wavelength). This energy is required for producing two electron-hole pairs. It then results in the formation of H2 and O2 from water. This makes bandgap most crucial factor for overall water splitting reaction, where the bandgap should be large enough to absorb sufficient light usually more than the requirement of water splitting redox process. In general, visible light (400–800nm in wavelength) which covers half of the solar energy spectrum is thermodynamically suitable for water splitting. In addition to that valence band should lie below the oxidation potential E° (O2/H2O) and the conduction band above to reduction potential E° (H+/H2) level, where E° is the electrode potential. According to Nernst equation the transformation of one water molecule into H2 and ½ O2 requires ΔE° =1.23eV for one electron transfer process where ΔE° is the difference of electrode potential for O2 and H2 formation i.e. 1.23 and 0.0 respectively [40]. The real challenge is to obtain semiconductor which should absorb longer wavelength along with its ability to split water [40–45]. Various inorganic photocatalyst have been tried for water splitting reaction as mentioned in the above reaction, however, amongst the variety of widely-investigated semiconductor molecule, TiO2 has been considered to be more promising due to its following peculiarities viz stability, non-corrosive, environmentally friendly and cost effective and natural abundance [46–50]. During water splitting reaction, usually hole recombination is frequently observed, thus the addition of scavenger reagent like methanol, ethanol or sulfide/sulfite is a necessary aspect for enhancing the photocatalytic process [40–53]. In this case the reaction that takes place is not the pure water splitting. In the presence of alcohol, the energy required for water splitting tends to be less as described by Kawai and Chen [54,55] through the following reaction: (2) CH 3 OH ( l ) ↔ HCHO ( g ) + H ( g ) Δ G ° = 64.1 kJ / mol … … … … … … … … … (3) HCHO ( g ) + H 2 O ( l ) ↔ HCOOH ( l ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ G ° = 47.8 kJ / mol … … ... . … . … … … … (4) HCOOH ( l ) ↔ CO ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ G ° = - 95.8 kJ / mol … … … … … … … .. . … . … ..... . With the overall reaction being (5) CH 3 OH ( l ) + H 2 O ( l ) ↔ CO ( g ) + 3H 2 ( g ) Δ G ° = 16.1 kJ / mol … … … … … … … … … … . . This reaction clearly indicates the higher feasibility of methanol decomposition when compared to water."
2,2 D carbon sheet/GR or RGO,"A revolution in the field of science and technology was the discovery of 2D carbon sheet discovered by condensed matter physicist Geim and Novoselov [29,56,57] in the year 2004. The term given to these sheets was graphene which is an allotrope of carbon and is made up of layer of hexagonal honeycomb network, consisting of carbon atoms. Different synthetic techniques such as thermal exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition, mechanical cleavage and chemical functionalization have already been employed to detached or exfoliate graphene layer from graphite [58–63] ( Fig. 1). Recent reports based on graphene synthesis and its tremendous influence in various fields and application makes it a very promising candidate for the future of material science. The sp2 (C˭C doubly bonded carbon) hybridized tightly packed carbon into a honey comb network of graphene is responsible for its high thermal conductivity (~ 5000Wm−1 K−1) with high charge mobility (200,000cm2 V−1 s−1) and surface area [29]. Graphene sheets show a strong tendency to form aggregates in solution due to van der Waals or hydrogen bond interaction [32]. This tendency of agglomeration can be overcome by electrostatic stabilization, chemical functionalization and also by size confinement as recently reported in various literatures [64–66]. There are various methods to obtain Graphene (GR) or Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) by reduction of GO. This further adds to its advantage and makes graphene a better choice for various application in pure and modified form. The easiest way of GO synthesis is by strong chemical oxidation of graphite which is first optimized by Hummers and Offeman [67], followed by sonication for efficient exfoliation. Since, large scale synthesis of GO is quite simple and reliable thus entire RGO synthesis cycle is also estimated as an easy and low cost technology as shown in Fig. 2. In the field of photocatalysis, especially with water splitting, pristine RGO is facing challenge of inability to utilize visible light and in-sufficient quantum efficiency etc. But, many intrinsic properties of RGO viz. high chemical and electrochemical stability, high surface area and superior electron mobility due to long conjugation makes RGO as a promoter for photocatalyst charge carrier [68]. Thus there is a requirement of RGO-based nanocomposite synthesis with rational design that can open up new possible pathways for the development of new photocatalyst."
3,TiO2-RGO nanocomposite synthesis,"As a efficient photocatalysis for high hydrogen productivity, TiO2/Graphene composites have been found to be as potential candidates [69]. Existing literatures support that several methods are known for the synthesis of composite of TiO2 with RGO nanosheet viz. simple mixing followed by stirring and sonication, sol-gel process, hydrothermal/solvothermal and photochemical, chemical and radiolytic reduction method [68–71]. Variation in synthesis methods is adopted to get uniform deposition of TiO2 over the surface of graphitic layer. The description of these methods is given in the following sub-section followed. Effect of metal/metal oxide deposition on the same composite is also described. The structural and morphological properties of the catalyst as a consequence of synthetic method are also taken into the account."
4,Simple mixing method,4.1 Simple mixing method Simple mixing followed by sonication is considered to be the most facile method employed for the synthesis of nanocomposites. But this method of synthesis exhibits a lack of interaction between the components because of the non-availability of chemical bonds. Park et al. synthesized TiO2/ RGO nanocomposite by simple mixing of TiO2 with electrochemically synthesized GO. Concentration of GO varied from 0.01 to 10wt%. It was found that GO remains unsuspended beyond 8wt%. Size of GO colloid get reduced in the presence of TiO2. Raman spectra revealed increase in intensity of D band related to decrease in crystallite size of GO after nanocomposite formation [72]. Similar procedure was also tried with sulfonated GO and TiO2. Nanocomposite also revealed the presence of sulphur in sulfonated GO confirmed by XPS in form of S 2p and along with reduced C-O peaks [73]. Pei et al. reported the oxy functionalities of GO decreased after nanocomposite formation [74]. Electrospun TiO2 nanofibre along with RGO resulted in the burying of RGO in the TiO2 matrix and its presence is further proved by High resolution Transmission electron microscopy HRTEM [75].
5,Sol-gel method,"4.2 Sol-gel method This is another facile technique which adequately helps in chemical interaction between GO and TiO2. Oxy and hydroxyl bridge formed between GO and metal centre during the process of hydrolysis to form leads to biphasic gel structure which increase with increase in amount of GO. Zhang et al. made TiO2/RGO nanocomposite by sol-gel technique using tetrabutyl titanate in alcoholic dispersion of GO using acidic medium. Prepared sol (colloidal solution) after drying followed by annealing resulted into TiO2/RGO nanocomposite. In XRD of GO peak at 12.8° corresponds to layered structure which gets disappeared after reduction and incorporation of TiO2 due to the transformation of GO to RGO. In XPS, feature of both elemental carbon and carbon bonded to oxygen species is clearly seen, however, the signal of Ti-C did not appear at higher binding energy side [76]."
6,Solvothermal or hydrothermal method,"4.3 Solvothermal or hydrothermal method Hydrothermal method takes place under specific temperature and pressure condition, carried out in a stainless body container i.e. autoclave. For making TiO2/RGO based nanocomposite, both GO and TiO2 is taken as the starting material where GO is reduced to RGO thermally or sometimes with some additional reducing agents like NaBH4 and hydrazine. Usually in the case of TiO2, the transformation of phase is observed during the process. Summary of the TiO2-RGO synthesized by hydrothermal method is shown in Table 1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the resulted nanocomposite depicted a clear feature of single layer RGO [77,78]. Reduction of GO to RGO is supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in which carbon peak related to C-O, C˭O and COOH of GO does get suppressed after formation of nanocomposite [77,78]. Appearance of C peaks at higher binding energy side belongs to O˭C-O-Ti formed by esterification reaction between COOH of GR and OH of TiO2 [78]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) depict the typical feature of anatase TiO2, however the crystallite size decreases with increase in the concentration of RGO. This indicates the role of RGO as support materials for the growth of TiO2. Transformation of rod-shape TiO2 nanoparticle (15nm) to spherical nanoparticle (6nm) with increasing RGO concentration and decoration on its surface is also observed in microscopic result [79,80]. Effect of N doping in TiO2 is seen as a XPS peak of N-Ti-O and O-Ti-O-N at low and higher binding energy side respectively. Peak belong to TiO2 at 142.6cm−1 in Raman spectra shows broadening after introducing RGO support strong connectivity of N-doped TiO2 with GO [81]. N-doped TiO2 and N-doped graphene nanocomposite studied for their interaction by XPS in form of Ti-O-C and Ti-C states reported by Pei et al. [82]. Reduced size of TiO2 and N- doping showed positive effect on hydrogen production efficiency [80,81] as mentioned in Table 3. Fan et al. synthesized TiO2/RGO composite by hydrothermal method and also made a comparison between TiO2/RGO composite synthesized by different method. It was found that the reduction is highest in case of TiO2/RGO composite synthesized by hydrothermal method along with the stability of the suspension [83] validated by decreased ID/IG ratio (ID-vibration comes from the sp3 hybridized carbon-carbon bond and IG-vibration comes from the sp2 hybridized carbon-carbon) [77–80,83,84]. Effect of nanoparticle and ionic liquid on the TiO2 morphology and its effect on hydrogen production is also studied [85–87]. Variation in TiO2 morphology from nanobelt and nanotube was achieved by simply varying the temperature of hydrothermal synthesis. However, the presence of RGO does not alter the crystallinity of nanotube. Moreover, the degree of GO reduction is also not much significant in nanobelt in comparison to nanotube [88]. Physical characterization could not show a big difference amongst different catalyst of this methodology. But a significant change was observed in the water splitting efficiency especially after N-doping (Nitrogen-doping; defect state) of either TiO2 and graphene and reducing the particle size of TiO2. This not only helps in increasing the efficiency of the catalyst but also making them more visible light active [80,81,82]."
7,Photochemical reduction,"4.4 Photochemical reduction Photochemical reduction is a simple method which is conducted usually in the presence of UV-radiation. In this reduction process, an electron is accumulated in TiO2 nanoparticle after the removal of a hole from TiO2 by alcohol (i.e. sacrificial agent). The accumulated electron is then transferred from TiO2 to GO, which helps in the reduction process of GO to RGO as shown in Fig. 3 and following equation. Reduction process can easily be monitored by change in colour from light brown to dark black. Fan et al. has reported the synthesis of TiO2/RGO nanocomposite formation by this technique and a clear evidence of GO reduction was given and explained through Raman and XPS techniques. However, the degree of reduction is comparatively less than that of hydrothermal method and higher than simple chemical reduction process [83]. Kim et al. synthesized nanosized graphene oxide (NGO) and large size graphene oxide (LGO) along with TiO2 by photochemical reduction method in aqueous medium. From AFM it was evident that NGO showed smaller size distribution (164±128 to 36±27nm) in comparison to LGO (520±480nm). It was observed by FT-IR and XPS that NGO retains its oxidized state after photocatalytic process relatively higher than that of LGO which is found to be good for interaction with TiO2 and photocatalysis [89]."
8,Other method,"4.5 Other method Some of the methods adopted rarely for TiO2/RGO nanocomposite synthesis such as chemical reduction and γ-radiolysis. In a chemical reduction processes, GO is reduced by some reducing agent like hydrazine hydrate and ammonia etc. in presence of TiO2. Fan et al. synthesized TiO2/RGO composite after the reduction of GO in the presence of TiO2 using hydrazine. Physical properties support fever interaction between GR and TiO2 and less stability of the suspension than other reduction method [84]. γ-radiolysis one of the clean and new technique which work on the basis of the generation of alcoholic electron in alcohol water mixture [90]."
9,Modification of TiO2-RGO nanocomposite,"Ternary composite based on M (metal or metal oxide)-TiO2/GO is also an effective way to further enhance catalytic activity. Metal containing plasmonic activity is basically used for this purpose which not only helps in enhancing the overall activity but also makes the catalyst suitable to perform in visible light. TiO2/RGO synthesized by any of the above mentioned method is suitable for such modification. Incorporation of Au nanoparticle and MoS2 on nanosheet of RGO in presence of TiO2 was carried out by hydrothermal synthesis. HRTEM supports the presence of Au nanoparticle on graphene scaffold along with Plasmon activity in UV-vis spectra. In addition to that, Raman scattering associated to TiO2 becomes more intense in the presence of Au nanoparticle due to SERs effect [91,92]. Sayed et al. reduced TiO2 and transformed some of its Ti+4 to Ti+3 for achieving higher catalytic activity in the presence of RGO. Ti+3 formations in TiO2 is confirmed by EPR signal which is further broadened in presence of RGO [93]. Yang et al. decorated Ag nanoparticle through a microwave irradiation in citric acid medium on hydrothermally synthesized TiO2-RGO composite. High surface area of RGO evades the chances of Ag nanoparticle aggregation which subsequently helps in enhancing the electric field on TiO2 resulting into an intense Raman signal [94]. Condition involved in the nanocomposite synthesis are reported in Table 2. Lv et al. made TiO2/RGO nanocomposite by hydrothermal method and latter deposited Cu by chemical reduction method to see the effect on various physical properties and photocatalytic activity. The distribution of Cu takes place on TiO2 as well on RGO surface ˭C [95]."
10,Physical property,
11,Optical property,"6.1 Optical property Absorption spectrum of TiO2 is significantly affected by the presence of RGO. Usually absorption takes place at higher wavelength region in presence of RGO and is estimated by diffuse reflectance mode of UV-vis spectroscopy. As much as the RGO content increases in the composite, the absorption in visible region is enhanced. The photoluminescence (PL) of TiO2 is generally quenched in the presence of GR due to the electro transfer from TiO2 to RGO as shown in Fig. 4. Increase in visible light absorption along with red shift in absorption onset with the increase in RGO concentration is observed. This is probably due to charge transfer complexation formed by oxy functionality over RGO [72]. This phenomenon is also influenced by the change in synthetic technique and size of TiO2 nanoparticle. It is found that absorption is superior in case of hydrothermally synthesized nanocomposite over simple mixed and photochemically synthesized one and for smaller TiO2 nanoparticle [83,87]. Similarly quenching in photoluminescence also enhances with the increase in concentration of RGO [77,80]. Effect of N doping in TiO2 came out in form of absorption at higher wavelength region in form of shoulder and band gap shifted from 2.84eV TiO2 to 2.69eV from N-doped TiO2 to N-doped TiO2/RGO composite. PL spectra of N-doped TiO2 get quenched in presence of RGO because conduction band of TiO2 is very near to the Fermi-level of RGO [82]. Wong et al. studied TiO2 nanotube and nanobelt absorption in presence of RGO. It was found that nanotube is more efficient in visible light absorption than nanobelt morphology due to feasible electron transport phenomenon [88]. Sayad et al. states combined effect of Ti+3 and RGO towards reduction of TiO2 band gap [93]. Shift in the absorption edge along with plasmonic feature of Au and Ag nanoparticle [91,94]. PL gets quenched when 1–2wt% of Ag is used, however further enhancement is observed when 3wt% amount of Ag is used. Such enhancement is probably due to the agglomeration of Ag nanoparticle that increases the Schottky barrier for feasible charge-separation."
12,Photoelectrochemical property,"6.2 Photoelectrochemical property Photoelectrochemistry is an electrochemical process that takes place at the interface of solid and liquid in the presence of light through electrochemical techniques such as chronoamperometry, impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry. Electrochemistry of semiconductor is significantly affected by light. To investigate the stability or degree of recombination of charge carrier in semiconductor, photo electrochemistry is usually carried out. Effect of the materials that could work as an electron sink or having high charge carrier mobility can also be justified. In this context, few authors have done photoelectrochemical characterization of TiO2/RGO nanocomposite. Xiang et al. observed three time stable photocurrent enhancement after RGO incorporation under UV light irradiation. RGO also helps in efficient charge separation. In addition to that a continues decrease before stabilization was also seen due to inefficient recombination for accumulated hole in TiO2 with reduced species in electrolyte [78]. In presence of redox couple (Fe+2/Fe+3) also both photochemical current enhancement and decrease in interfacial resistance observed in chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurement [72]. Cao et al. compared the synthesis technique with photo electrochemical technique. They found that TiO2/RGO composite synthesized by hydrothermal method is more photocatalytically active than the composite made by simple mixing [84]. Lv et al. carried out photoelectrochemical study of TiO2/RGO nanocomposite along with the Cu deposition in NaClO4. Photocurrent density is highest in presence of Cu for the composite and also shows fast and reproducible photocurrent that supports an improved charge separation from catalyst to the electrode surface and found good for photocatalytic water splitting [95]."
13,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"Hydrogen is indeed being promoted as the fuel of the future. As its environmental friendly and its high fuel efficiency adds to the advantages to be used as the fuel for the future. Photocatalytic hydrogen production has received considerable recognition as it turn to be the most productive and a cost effective way for the synthesis of hydrogen. TiO2 is widely used semiconductor for the purpose of hydrogen production in both pure and modified form [96–99]. Modifications have been done mainly with Pt on the surface of TiO2. The advantage of using Pt is the reduction in the recombination process of electron due to its role as an efficient electron sink. However, the disadvantage of using Pt is its high cost. Hence some alternate materials should be used which can play a substituent with an equivalent efficiency. Graphene has stood up to this expectation. Its high surface area, conductivity and the ability to act as an electron sink makes it an appropriate candidate to replace Pt. Hydrogen production rate for TiO2/RGO and M-TiO2/RGO nanocomposite as illustrated in Table 3 in ascending order under UV, UV-vis and visible light irradiation. Incorporation of RGO with TiO2 is beneficial for increasing hydrogen production in UV, UV-Vis and only visible region. Current interest is to make photocatalyst more suitable for visible light activity. In UV and UV-vis irradiation optimum amount of RGO, TiO2 hierarchical structure and overall amount of photocatalyst in the solvent (alcohol-water and Na2S-Na2SO3 mixture) is important to achieve photocatalytic activity. Larger amount of the RGO hides the catalytic centre of TiO2 [84]. Addition of Pt and MoS2 gives more surfaces for photocatalysis due to quantum confinement; however the possibility of electron transfer from TiO2 to Pt/MoS2 is either directly or via RGO reduce electron-hole recombination rate [72,92]. Doping which increase the acidity of the graphene increase the H2 production specifically in acidic medium as observed after sulphur doping [73]. Ionic liquid TiO2/RGO nanocomposite was found to be comparatively efficient and stable under UV light irradiation [86]. Similarly, in UV-vis irradiation both the graphene loading and the calcination temperatures shows its influence on the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst. Especially, with the photocatalyst synthesized through sol gel method [76,79,85,88]. Partial reduction of GO and strong interaction showed positive influence on the catalytic activity of TiO2 [74]. Typical anatase phase is very crucial for higher photocatalytic activity which retained during photochemical reduction procedure of the nanocomposite formation However, after hydrothermal method TiO2 partly converts to (hydrogen Titanate-H2Ti4O9) also responsible for declined water splitting feature [88]. Fan et al. systematically studied the influence of different reduction approaches on the efficiency of hydrogen evolution for TiO2/RGO nanocomposites. The photocatalytic results show that the TiO2/RGO composite prepared by the hydrothermal method possessed the best performance for hydrogen evolution under UV-Vis light irradiation, [83]. Hetero atom doping in RGO and TiO2 imparted positive effect on hydrogen production, however, excess noble metal doping reduces hydrogen production rate [81,82,94]. Hydrogen production yield is about 13.1 times to that of pure TiO2due to available N-active site in RGO layer for feasible electron transfer for H+ reduction [81]. In-situ deposition of metal nanoparticle during hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2-RGO nanocomposite is found to be inferior incomparison to the post synthetic deposition by photochemical method [87]. Sayed et al. reported the combined effect of Ti(IV) reduction into Ti(III) and Pd-RGO incorporation on overall photocatalytic activity. Author stated that TiO2 reduction increase visible light absorption, however, Pd and RGO increase the electron lifetime [93]. Lv et al. reported extensive H2 evolution (5 times) after copper (Cu) combination along with RGO than that of only RGO with TiO2. Apart from that the stability of the catalyst is also very high due to the formation of Cu(I) ion on the surface of TiO2 after solar irradiation which also plays a crucial role in solar harvesting [95]. Advancement came in the area of RGO research towards photocatalytic application when it shows visible light activity. Hence intensive research started was carried out to show TiO2/RGO activity as only vis light irradiation. The reason behind such activity is the visible light active p-n junction which does gets activated in the presence of noble metal [80,87,91]. Visible light activity is also gained by nitrogen doping of TiO2 due to the formation of defect band near to the valance band of TiO2 [81]. Kim et al. found enhancement in the activity by reducing the lateral dimension of the RGO upto nanometer size [89]. In certain cases, TiO2/RGO did not show visible light activity, however deposition of Au with plasmonic activity transform it to a strong visible light photocatalyst [91]."
14,Mechanism of enhanced photocatalysis,"Intrinsic property of RGO sheets i.e. excellent conductivity and higher charge carriers mobility helps in better and quicker transport of electrons from semiconductor under solar illumination subsequently reduce recombination resulting into efficient catalysis processes. Fig. 5 (I) is a schematic illustration charge transfer phenomenon that coexist with charge separation in the RGO/TiO2 nanosheets system in the presence of UV-Vis light irradiation. In case of pure semiconductor (TiO2), most of the charge carriers recombine resulting into low conversion efficiency. However, the incorporation of RGO tends to stabilize photogenerated electron into its conjugated sheets. This phenomenon is certainly suppressing the photogenerated electron-holes recombination. Above property of charge transfer from TiO2 to RGO is depending on the interaction between the two moieties. Degree of interaction varied according to the synthetic condition justified by spectroscopic (UV-Vis) and electrochemical technique (impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry etc.) [82,84,86]. Addition of Pt nanoparticle further enhances the hydrogen production rate due to the nature of graphene sheet as shuttle for electron towards Pt nanoparticle [72,89] as shown in Fig. 5 (II). In presence of metal nanoparticle (plasmon active), the ternary nanocomposite shows visible light activity. Here, the visible light absorption is carried out by metal nanoparticle under Schottky junction condition. Plasmonic absorption breaks Schottky barrier and induce electron transfer from metal nanoparticle to TiO2 conduction band. Electron coming from metal nanoparticle and due to induced electronic field created due to plasmonic phenomenon, transferred to RGO sheet which participates in hydrogen production along with the electron available on TiO2 surface [91] as shown in Fig. 5 (III)."
15,Conclusion,"RGO incorporation is described as an efficient supportive material in case of semiconductor materials. This is due to the possible increase in the photo excited electron lifetime in its presence. Since the above mentioned property along with structural, optical, electrochemical and morphological property is found to be significantly affected by the synthetic techniques employed in case of TiO2/RGO nanocomposites. Hence, all synthetic techniques i.e. sol-gel, hydrothermal, chemical reduction and photochemical methods and their effect on all above mentioned property has been elaborated. After a comparative investigation towards hydrogen production in co-relation with synthetic technique, it was found that hydrothermal is more versatile, efficient and highly adopted technique. Moreover, hydrothermal method is also known for its feasibility and in also synthesizing RGO with high surface area and strong interaction between TiO2 and RGO. The main breakthrough in this area is the transformation of TiO2 activity from UV to visible light. Further modification of TiO2/RGO nanocomposite is done with the desire of enhancing both overall as well as visible light activity. Thus ternary composite is also considered for making a comparative picture. By overall comparison it is observed that both TiO2/RGO and M-TiO2/RGO nanocomposite still less efficient than that of TiO2/Pt photocatalyst [95] under UV-vis light irradiation. Overall it seems that hydrogen production value is significant correlated with the interaction between the component of nanocomposite, hence, in case of TiO2/RGO nanocomposite some of the aspect still need to be investigated. It is required to make TiO2/RGO nanocomposite and incorporation of suitable co-catalyst either metal or metal oxide using some unique strategy. This will not only help in increasing interaction between them but also keep the morphology of RGO and crystallinity of TiO2 intact. Another most important objectives would be the reproducibility of the synthesized nanocomposite with consistent property. It can be concluded that TiO2/RGO nanocomposite containing potential advantage faces still many challenges and opportunity. Keeping all the challenges and opportunity into consideration, certainly it will provide an opportunity in solving future energy crisis."
