0,Introduction,"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are considered to be safe and beneficial microorganisms that play crucial roles in food fermentation and health in animals and humans (FAO/WTO, 2006; Han et al., 2017). LAB limit the growth of putrefactive and pathogenic bacteria, delay oxidative deterioration, and impart characteristic flavors and texture profiles to fermented foods (Chen et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020). In addition, LAB are widely used as probiotics that colonize the intestinal tract, stimulate the intestinal immune system, regulate intestinal microbiota homeostasis, and eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). These effects help to cure numerous chronic diseases (Nieuwboer et al., 2016; Seddik et al., 2017). Therefore, LAB have been cultivated and used in fermented foods (Bekhit et al., 2018; Evivie et al., 2017), health foods, and medicines (Zielińska and Kolożyn-Krajewska, 2018). LAB will inevitably encounter stress conditions that may affect viability and function during production, storage, or application. Oxidative stress is one of the most common stress factors in bacteria (Mills et al., 2011). Typically, oxidative stress refers to an excessive accumulation or rapid increase of ROS, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radicals. ROS induce the oxidation of cellular macromolecules, damage the cell membrane, alter cytoplasmic enzyme activities, affect growth and metabolism, and hinder the functional properties of LAB (Arcanjo et al., 2019; Athina et al., 2001; Papadimitriou et al., 2016; Zotta et al., 2008). Consequently, increasing LAB tolerance to oxidative stress may be an effective means of maintaining their normal physiological status and ensuring their desired probiotic effects. The LAB strain Pediococcus pentosaceus R1 used in this study was isolated from Harbin dry sausages, a traditional meat product in northeast China. Our previous study reported that this strain is particularly suited for meat fermentation because it improves product characteristics, such as color, flavor, aroma, and texture (Chen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2013). Another study of our lab showed that P. pentosaceus R1 has a great potential as probiotics in conferring health benefits to the host (Han et al., 2017). Using metabolomics, we found that three endogenous amino acids are excessively consumed in P. pentosaceus R1 under H2O2 induced oxidative stress: arginine (Arg), glycine (Gly), and glutamic acid (Glu). Consequently, we hypothesized that one or more of these amino acids might be involved in bacterial defenses against oxidative stress (Zhang et al., 2021). Gly, Arg, and Glu involvement in alleviating oxidative stress has been reported in rats, shrimp, crab, and humans (Díaz-Flores et al., 2013; Salyha and Salyha, 2018; Salyha, 2018; Senthilkumar et al., 2004; Xie et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, Arg exhibits an antioxidant effect in the food system (Park et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2018). The oxidative defense patterns involving Gly, Arg, and Glu can be divided into two categories: (1) agents that scavenge free-radicals or chelate ferrous ions to alleviate oxidative bursts (Kim et al., 2018; Kitazawa and Iwasaki, 1999; Meucci and Mele, 1997; Salyha and Salyha, 2018), or (2) agents that indirectly defend against oxidative stress. For example, Glu and Gly, precursors of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), improve tolerance to oxidative stress by increasing the cellular GSH content (Griffith, 1999; Senthilkumar et al., 2004). Exogenous Arg, Gly, and Glu have been reported to alleviate oxidative stress in cells by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (Salyha and Salyha, 2018; Shaikh and Tang, 1999; Zhang et al., 2020a, 2020b). An analysis of the literature found few studies on the effects of exogenous amino acids on oxidative stress in bacteria. Therefore, we investigated whether exogenous Arg, Gly, and Glu improve the oxidative stress tolerance of P. pentosaceus R1 by analyzing cell morphology and the levels of ROS, malondialdehyde, carbonylated protein, and ATP. Possible mechanisms were revealed by measuring the antioxidant activities of amino acids in vitro. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), levels of GSH, and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of cell-free extracts of P. pentosaceus R1 were also measured."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and culture conditions,"2.1 Bacterial strains and culture conditions P. pentosaceus R1 was isolated from Harbin dry sausages and identified by sequencing the 16S rDNA (Zhao and Kong, 2010). Cultures were maintained with 25% glycerol and preserved at −80 °C. First, an aliquot (100 μL) of the strain was inoculated into 10 mL of fresh MRS broth and activated. Next, the bacteria were inoculated into MRS broth and cultured in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 180 rpm) for 12 h. Subsequently, bacteria were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.02 M, pH = 7.2–7.4) and collected for use in experiments."
3,Bacterial proliferation and survival rates,"2.2 Bacterial proliferation and survival rates To investigate the effects of amino acids on bacteria proliferation and survival, proliferation rates of P. pentosaceus R1 were measured according to the method described by Wang et al. (2019). Briefly, bacterial cells (108 CFU/mL) were suspended in MRS broth with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mM) of Arg, Gly, or Glu (Solarbio Science & Technology, Beijing, China). The optical density at 600 nm was measured for each bacterial suspension before and after incubation for 1 h at 37 °C and recorded as A 0 and A 1, respectively. Proliferation rates were calculated according to the following formula: Proliferation rate = ( A 1 − A 0 ) / A 0 × 100 % . Bacterial cells (108 CFU/mL) were suspended in MRS broth containing various concentrations of H2O2 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 mM) to obtain the H2O2 concentration that induces moderate oxidative damage during incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Tolerance of P. pentosaceus R1 to H2O2 was determined as described by Oh et al. (2020). The number of viable bacteria before and after incubation was determined by a plate count method. Survival rates were calculated as follows: Survival rate ( % ) = log N t / log N 0 × 100 %, where Nt is the bacterial count after incubation in MRS broth with H2O2, and N0 is the bacterial count before incubation. Results showed that 4 mM H2O2 induces moderate oxidative stress, so this concentration was selected to evaluate oxidative damage in subsequent studies."
4,Intracellular ROS level,"2.3 Intracellular ROS level The effects of Arg, Gly, or Glu on ROS generation in P. pentosaceus R1 were assessed using a peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe: 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate (H2DCFDA, Beyotime Biological Technology, Shanghai, China). Intracellular ROS levels were measured in bacteria exposed to 4 mM H2O2 and different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mM) of Arg, Gly, or Glu according to the method described by Zhang et al. (2014). Briefly, bacteria (108 CFU/mL) were incubated in MRS broth containing 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mM of Arg, Gly, or Glu, in conjunction with 4 mM H2O2. Samples excluding amino acid and H2O2 were used as control. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, each sample was treated with 10 μM H2DCFDA and then incubated in the dark for 30 min. Intracellular fluorescence intensities were assessed at 488/525 nm (excitation/emission) using a fluorescence reader (SpectraMax M2e, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Data from the experiments described above showed that the optimal concentration for Gly or Glu to suppress ROS production was 10 mM, so this concentration was used in subsequent assays. The protective effects of Gly and Glu against oxidative damage induced by 4 mM H2O2 in P. pentosaceus R1 were investigated by treating bacteria (108 CFU/mL) with 10 mM Gly or Glu alone, 4 mM H2O2 alone, or a combination of one amino acid (10 mM) and 4 mM H2O2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Treated bacterial cells were washed three times with PBS (0.02 M, pH = 7.2–7.4) and then collected for subsequent studies."
5,"Intracellular ATP, malondialdehyde, and carbonylated protein levels","2.4 Intracellular ATP, malondialdehyde, and carbonylated protein levels Intracellular ATP was measured with an ATP kit (Beyotime Biological Technology, Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipid peroxidation was assessed according to Banu et al. (2009) by measuring the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Bacterial suspensions and 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid were mixed in a 1:2 v/v ratio and then homogenized by sonication. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000×g for 15 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was diluted 1:2 (v/v) with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 0.5% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid, placed in a 95 °C water bath for 25 min, and then centrifuged at 7500×g for 5 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was read at 532 nm. The MDA content was calculated using the extinction at 155 mM −1cm−1 (expressed as μmol/mg protein). Carbonylated protein levels were measured using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), as described by Liu et al. (2011)."
6,Transmission electron microscopy,"2.5 Transmission electron microscopy The intracellular morphology of bacterial cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) according to the method of Ngamdee et al. (2015). Bacteria were fixed in 2.5% phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde for at least 4 h and then washed three times with PBS. The bacterial cells were fixed with 1% osmic acid for 2 h, quickly washed thrice with cold PBS (0.1 M, pH 6.8), dehydrated in gradient concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, and 90%) for 15 min, and further dehydrated thrice in 100% ethanol for 20 min each. The dehydrated cells were washed twice in propylene oxide, infiltrated for 1 h with a 1:1 mixture of epoxy resin and propylene oxide at 37 °C, and then infiltrated overnight with a 2:1 mixture of epoxy resin and propylene oxide at 37 °C before being embedded in pure epoxy resin and polymerized at 60 °C overnight. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained, and mounted. The sections were observed using an H-7650 electron microscope (Hitachi H-800, Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 200 kV."
7,Atomic force microscopy,"2.6 Atomic force microscopy The surface topography of bacterial cells was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) according to the method of Li et al. (2017) with a minor modification. Briefly, cells were washed twice with sterile deionized water and resuspended in sterile saline at 1 × 105 CFU/mL. Next, cell suspensions (30 μL) were coated onto clean glass plates and air-dried. Images of treated cells were obtained using an AFM (Veeco Instruments, New York, USA.) equipped with ScanAsyst. AFM images were analyzed using NanoScope Analysis software (Veeco Instruments, New York, USA)."
8,Assessment of the antioxidation properties of amino acids,"2.7 Assessment of the antioxidation properties of amino acids 2.7.1 Radical scavenging rates, reducing power, and ferrous ion-chelating ability of Gly and Glu The antioxidation properties of Gly and Glu were evaluated by measuring 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging rates, hydroxyl radical scavenging rates, reducing power, and ferrous ion-chelation according to the method of Xu et al. (2018). In brief, 10 mM Gly and Glu aqueous solutions were used to measure DPPH radical scavenging rates, hydroxyl radical scavenging rates, and reducing power. In addition, Fe2+ chelation was measured with 0.2 mM Gly and Glu aqueous solutions. 2.7.2 Inhibition of lipid peroxidation The ability of Gly and Glu to inhibit lipid peroxidation was measured using a modification of the method published by Lee et al. (2010). First, the linoleic acid emulsion was prepared by mixing 0.1 mL linoleic acid, 0.2 mL Tween 20, and 19.7 mL deionized water. Next, the reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 1 mL linoleic acid emulsion, 0.5 mL PBS (20 mM, pH 7.4), 1 mL 1% FeSO4, and 1 mL Gly or Glu solution (10 mM). The mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. A 2 mL aliquot of reaction mixture was then mixed with 2 mL of 0.8% thiobarbituric acid (w/v) and 0.2 mL of 4% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), heated for 20 min in a boiling water bath, and rapidly cooled to room temperature. Cooled samples were centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min, and the absorbance (A s) at 532 nm was measured with 2 mL of supernatant. The control samples used to obtain the corresponding absorbance (A c) were prepared by substituting an equal volume of distilled water for the Gly or Glu in the reaction mixture. Inhibition rates were calculated according to the following formula: Inhibition rate ( % ) = ( A c - A s ) / A c × 100 %."
9,"Measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities, T-AOC, and GSH content","2.8 Measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities, T-AOC, and GSH content Bacterial suspensions (108 CFU/mL) were disrupted in an ice bath using an ultrasonic cell crusher (JY96-Ⅱ, Xinzhi Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Ningbo, China) and centrifuged at 8000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected to measure intracellular SOD and GSH-Px activities, T-AOC, and GSH content using commercially available assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). SOD activity and GSH content were measured following the method of Fukui and Bao (2010), GSH-Px activity and T-AOC were determined using the method of Chen et al. (2015) and Zhang et al. (2012), respectively. SOD and GSH-Px activities and T-AOC were expressed as U/mg protein."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis Each assay was performed in triplicate, and all experiments were conducted thrice. Calculations were carried out using the Statistix 8.1 software package (Analytical Software, St Paul, MN, USA). Data were presented as the mean ± standard error. Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between experimental groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparisons."
11,Results and discussion,
12,"Bacterial proliferation, survival, and intracellular ROS levels","3.1 Bacterial proliferation, survival, and intracellular ROS levels The effects of amino acids on bacterial proliferation were investigated. Results indicate that 5 mM and 10 mM had no significant impact on bacterial proliferation, whereas increasing the concentration to 20 and 40 mM, Arg and Glu significantly inhibited cell proliferation (P < 0.05; Fig. 1 A), indicating that concentrations of Arg and Glu above 10 mM were deleterious for cell proliferation. The harmful effects of exposure to >10 mM Arg and Glu are consistent with those reported by Morsy and Ahmed (2020). They suggested that an accumulation of Arg highly inhibits ATP production, promotes ROS generation, which leads to polyunsaturated fatty acids and proteins oxidation and DNA damage, resulting in cells damage and even death. Likewise, Fukui and Bao (2010) demonstrated that high concentrations of Glu cause neuronal death by disrupting calcium homeostasis, resulting in ROS accumulation. Akhmadishina et al. (2018) utilized 50 mM Glu to induce oxidative states in mammalian cells to determine the protect effects of oligopeptides. However, as discussed in the Introduction, other studies showed that appropriate doses of Gly, Arg, or Glu prevent or alleviate oxidative stress in many species. Díaz-Flores et al. (2013) demonstrated that Gly plays an important role in protecting against oxidative damage in metabolic syndrome patients by regulating the balance the redox reactions; and Glu alleviates the oxidative stress in rats by taking part in the GSH synthesis and inhabiting lipid peroxidation (Salyha, 2018; Salyha and Salyha, 2018). Moreover, in sausage, Arg directly scavenges ROS and radical products (Park et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2018). Therefore, we hypothesized that one or more of these amino acids alleviate oxidative stress and that the effect is related to concentration. P. pentosaceus R1 were initially treated with various concentrations of H2O2 (0–6 mM). The data suggest that H2O2-induced cytotoxicity is concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 4 mM H2O2, the survival rate is 51.26%; consequently, 4 mM H2O2 was used to pretreat P. pentosaceus R1 in subsequent experiments. H2O2 can disturb the electron transfer chain and generate superoxide, which can damage iron-sulphur clusters and subsequently trigger the formation of iron-catalyzed free radical by the Fenton reaction and finally result in the accumulation of ROS (Mols and Abee, 2010). Intracellular ROS content directly reflects the level of oxidative stress in cells (Serrazanetti et al., 2009). The effects of Arg, Gly, and Glu on P. pentosaceus R1 under oxidative stress were evaluated by measuring intracellular ROS (Fig. 1C). The data indicate that Arg, Gly, and Glu significantly reduce intracellular ROS levels in P. pentosaceus R1 under H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Each amino acid achieved the most significant inhibitory effect at 10 mM when compared with 5, 20, and 40 mM (P < 0.05). When Arg and Glu concentrations are increased to 20 and 40 mM, intracellular ROS levels elevate gradually and significantly (P < 0.05) relative to 10 mM. This effect is potentially due to these levels of Arg and Glu being cytotoxic, the excessive accumulation of Arg and Glu disturb homeostasis and lead to the ROS generation. (Fukui and Bao, 2010; Morsy and Ahmed, 2020). Notably, 10 mM Gly and Glu each suppressed ROS production most significantly compared to Arg, without inhibiting proliferation; consequently, 10 mM Gly and Glu were selected for subsequent experiments."
13,"Intracellular levels of ATP, MDA, and carbonylated proteins","3.2 Intracellular levels of ATP, MDA, and carbonylated proteins Oxidative stress elevates ROS production in bacteria, which induces lipid peroxidation and propagates a chain reaction. MDA is a key ROS metabolic biomarker; it reacts with cellular components, induces cellular oxidative damage, triggers energy metabolism disorders, and reduces intracellular ATP (Zhang et al., 2014). Intracellular ATP was measured to determine whether Gly or Glu affects energy metabolism in bacteria under oxidative stress (Table 1 ). Significantly decreased intracellular ATP levels are observed in cells treated with H2O2 relative to untreated control samples (P < 0.05), consistent with the findings reported by Jozefczuk et al., 2010, who confirmed that ATP levels decreased in Escherichia coli when oxidative stress occurred and highlighted that the accumulated ROS damage three major ATP-production pathways, including the metabolism of glycolysis, the pentosephosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, adding Gly or Glu suppresses the reduction of intracellular ATP level in P. pentosaceus R1 treated with H2O2, this result may be ascribed to the antioxidative potential of Gly and Glu. According to Senthilkumar et al. (2004) and Yin et al. (2015), Gly and Glu alleviate oxidative stress via enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities and inhibiting lipid oxidation. Notably, Gly has a more substantial effect than Glu (P < 0.05). According to Alhasawi et al. (2015), ketoacid is an essential metabolite of Gly in Pseudomonas fluorescens treated with H2O2 and is involved in ATP biosynthesis via substrate-level phosphorylation. This pathway may explain why Gly is more suppressive than Glu. The data presented in Fig. 1C suggest that Gly and Glu indirectly alleviate the reduction of intracellular ATP levels by suppressing ROS production in bacterial cells (Zhang et al., 2014). Gly and Glu also reduce intracellular ATP levels in the absence of H2O2 stress when compared with control. This response may be ascribed to the transmembrane transfer of Gly and Glu relied on the ATP-binding cassette transporter and l-glutamate transporter, respectively, and intracellular ATP is critical to the function of these two transporters (Hartwich et al., 2012; Mahmoud et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). Intracellular ATP is consumed during the intake of Gly and Glu, leading to the decrease of ATP level. Many studies have demonstrated that the accumulate of ROS can disturb cellular homeostasis, lead to the lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, so the MDA content and the level of carbonyl groups of proteins can be used as markers of oxidative damage (Liu et al., 2011). The extent of oxidative damage in bacterial cells was assessed to characterize the cytoprotective effects of Gly and Glu. Compared to control samples, treatment with 4 mM H2O2 significantly increases MDA levels. Conversely, adding Gly or Glu to P. pentosaceus R1 treated with H2O2 significantly suppresses the increase in MDA levels (P < 0.05). Levels of carbonylated protein in P. pentosaceus R1 cells were also measured to investigate the protective effect of Gly and Glu against 4 mM H2O2-induced protein oxidation (Table 1). The pattern of carbonylated protein levels in response to H2O2, Gly, and Glu is similar to that of MDA. Carbonylated protein levels in control samples, or samples treated with Gly or Glu alone, are low (less than 0.4 nmol/mg protein). However, in P. pentosaceus R1 treated with 4 mM H2O2, there are significantly increases in carbonyl content (1.27 nmol/mg protein). These findings are consistent with results obtained by Arcanjo et al. (2019) and Padilla et al. (2020), who found that the levels of ROS, MDA, and carbonylated proteins increased in Lactobacillus reuteri under oxidative stress. Conversely, the addition of 10 mM of Gly or Glu significantly reduces the carbonyl contents (P < 0.05). These data indicate that treatment with Gly or Glu decreases the production of ROS and oxidative metabolites. This may be ascribed to the antioxidant properties of Gly and Glu (Kitazawa and Iwasaki, 1999; Meucci and Mele, 1997), or/and they are involved in cellular antioxidant defense systems (Senthilkumar et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2019)."
14,Transmission electron microscopy,"3.3 Transmission electron microscopy The intracellular morphology of bacterial cells is a crucial indicator of cell status. Ultrastructural changes in P. pentosaceus R1 in response to H2O2 treatment and Gly or Glu exposure were investigated using TEM (Fig. 2 ). Intact, round cell shapes are observed for control samples and for cells treated with Gly or Glu alone. Treating cells with 4 mM H2O2 caused them to appear as oval shapes, with fewer intracellular components. A logical explanation is that oxidative stress cause lipid peroxidation, protein damage, and DNA lesions, leading to the degradation of intracellular components (Bhat et al., 2015; Papadimitriou et al., 2016). Adding Gly or Glu to P. pentosaceus R1 suspensions treated with 4 mM H2O2 suppressed the reduction of cytoplasmic inclusions induced by oxidative stress. Slauch (2011) reported that large amounts of ROS cause oxidative damage to cytoplasmic components, ultimately resulting in bacterial cell death. This finding is consistent with our data showing that 4 mM H2O2 resulted in the reduction of intracellular constituents. In addition, the P. pentosaceus R1 treated with Gly or Glu, in conjunction with 4 mM H2O2, exhibited complete cytoplasmic inclusions, possibly due to the scavenging of ROS by Gly and Glu."
15,Atomic force microscopy,"3.4 Atomic force microscopy High-resolution AFM was used to visualize the surface characteristics of P. pentosaceus R1. A relatively regular envelope border and smooth surface (Fig. 3 ) are observed in the 2D and 3D images of untreated (control) samples and in cells treated with Gly or Glu alone. Bacteria treated with 4 mM H2O2 appear inflated compared with control cells, indicating that 4 mM H2O2 deforms cellular structure. Li et al. (2017) found that heat treatment causes the deformation of Staphylococcus aureus cells and suggested that this phenomenon is due to the outflow of cell contents. The sizes of P. pentosaceus R1 cells under H2O2-induced stress treated with Gly or Glu are typical, although an apparent rugged surface is evident in the 3D micrographs. The Rq value, an indicator of surface roughness, was used to evaluate the effects of Gly and Glu treatment on the topography of P. pentosaceus R1 under H2O2-induced stress. The data show that 4 mM H2O2 significantly increases surface roughness, and Gly and Glu treatment of these cells substantially decreases the surface roughness (P < 0.05). These results are consistent with the 3D images. They indicate that Gly and Glu increase the tolerance of P. pentosaceus R1 to 4 mM H2O2-induced oxidative stress, maintain the bacterial morphology, and decrease surface roughness. Paul et al. (2011) demonstrated that the loss, damage or irregular packing of bacterial surface macromolecules under stress condition can affect the surface ultrastructure and roughness of bacteria. Storia et al. (2011), Uzoechi and Abu-Lail (2020) claimed that the stress factors promote an increase in bacterial cell roughness, and this roughness may be associated with cell membrane damage. Consequently, we propose that Gly and Glu can alleviate cell membrane damage caused by oxidative stress, leading to the decrease of surface roughness in P. pentosaceus R1."
16,Assessing the antioxidant activity of Gly and Glu in vitro,"3.5 Assessing the antioxidant activity of Gly and Glu in vitro Radical scavenging rates, reducing power, and ferrous ion-chelating ability of Gly and Glu were conducted to determine whether they suppress the ROS production induced by 4 mM H2O2 via antioxidation. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Gly and Glu on lipid peroxidation was evaluated. As shown in Table 2 , Glu exhibits significantly higher DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities and reducing power than Gly (P < 0.05). In contrast, Gly has a higher ferrous ion-chelating ability than Glu (P < 0.05) in vitro. There is no significant difference in the lipid peroxidation inhibition capacities between the two amino acids (P > 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that Gly and Glu possess antioxidant activities that may be attributed to the combined effect of their respective radical scavenging properties and metal chelating capacity. Senthilkumar et al. (2004) indicated that exogenous Gly suppresses free radical-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes, plasma, and erythrocyte membranes in humans and animals suffering from alcohol-induced liver damage. Bearson et al. (2009) showed that Glu provides significant protection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in Escherichia coli O157: H7."
17,"Antioxidant enzyme activity, T-AOC, and GSH content","3.6 Antioxidant enzyme activity, T-AOC, and GSH content SOD and GSH-Px are the major ROS scavengers in bacterial cells, playing pivotal roles in antioxidant defense systems (Toscano et al., 2016). Gly and Glu reduce oxidative stress in rats by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and/or participating in the synthesis of GSH (Griffith, 1999; Salyha and Salyha, 2018; Senthilkumar et al., 2004). The activities of SOD and GSH-Px, T-AOC, and GSH levels were measured to elucidate the cytoprotective mechanism of Gly and Glu in P. pentosaceus R1 under oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 4 A and B, H2O2 treatment significantly decreases SOD and GSH-Px activities in P. pentosaceus R1 compared to control samples (P < 0.05). There are no significant differences in T-AOC between H2O2-treated and control samples (P > 0.05; Fig. 4C). One reason may be that many metabolites induced by oxidative stress have antioxidant properties that maintain the T-AOC, even though oxidative stress decreases the antioxidant activity of individual enzymes (Zhang et al., 2021). Gly treatment significantly increases SOD activity and T-AOC compared to control samples and H2O2-treated cells (P < 0.05). Glu treatment showed no significant effect on SOD activity (P > 0.05). However, Glu treatment significantly increases GSH-Px activity and T-AOC compared to control samples, suppresses the H2O2 stress-induced decrease in GSH-Px activity, and improves the T-AOC under H2O2-induced stress (P < 0.05). Antioxidant enzymes play an essential role in protecting cells from oxidative damage in animals, bacteria, and fungus. Many studies have shown that Gly plays a protective role against oxidative stress in rats (Senthilkumar et al., 2004), humans (Díaz-Flores et al., 2013), Cystofilobasidium infirmominiatum yeast (Liu et al., 2011), and Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria (Alhasawi et al., 2015). In addition, Glu has been reported to suppress chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative stress by improving GSH levels and glutathione-related enzyme activity in rats (Salyha and Salyha, 2018). However, to our best knowledge, this is the first report identifying the protective effects of Gly and Glu against oxidative stress in LAB. During H2O2-induced stress, ROS production rates typically exceed the scavenging activity of antioxidant systems and cause damage to bacterial cells. The addition of Gly or Glu to LAB can stimulate antioxidant enzyme activities, regulate ROS levels, and reduce oxidative stress. Data reported in this study show that Gly and Glu play protective roles and regulate ROS levels by stimulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes. GSH is an endogenous tripeptide antioxidant; it is synthesized from Glu, cysteine, and Gly in a two-step enzymatic process catalyzed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GSH synthetase and is vital to antioxidant defense systems (Griffith, 1999). To determine whether exogenous Gly and Clu are involved in the synthesis of GSH, GSH levels were measured. Surprisingly, GSH was not detected in any sample. We consulted the relevant literature and learned that GSH had been seen only in gram-negative bacteria and a few gram-positive bacteria (Fahey et al., 1978). These findings suggest that Gly and Glu improve the antioxidant activity in P. pentosaceus R1 independently of GSH. Interestingly, Senthilkumar et al. (2004) and Salyha and Salyha (2018) reported that exogenous Gly and Glu, respectively, elevate GSH levels in rats suffering from oxidative stress. The disparity between their results and ours may be attributed to discrepancies between the organisms under investigation."
18,Conclusion,"We investigated the effects of exogenous Gly and Glu (10 mM) on oxidative stress tolerance in P. pentosaceus R1. The results show that the addition of 10 mM Gly or Glu significantly reduces 4 mM H2O2-induced ROS production and inhibits oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in P. pentosaceus R1. Treatment with Gly or Glu alleviates cellular deformation and damage in bacterial cells under H2O2-induced oxidative stress. These findings indicate that Gly and Glu exhibit physiological and morphological protective effects against H2O2-induced oxidative damage. The underlying protection mechanisms of Gly and Glu may be attributed to their radical-scavenging activities and ion chelating abilities. Gly and Glu also enhance endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities in P. pentosaceus R1. In summary, Gly and Glu play essential roles in alleviating oxidative stress in P. pentosaceus R1. These characteristics indicated that the addition of Gly and Glu may facilitate the use of P. pentosaceus R1 in the manufacture of fermented foods, health foods, and medicines."
