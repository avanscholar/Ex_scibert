0,Introduction,"Crude bio-oil obtained by pyrolysis of biomass is a complex mixture of acids, phenols, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, ketones, carbohydrates, and other compounds (Gayubo et al., 2004a,b; Iordanidis et al., 2006; Li et al., 2011a; Peng et al., 2009). The water content of crude bio-oil can be as high as 30wt.% and negatively influences on combustion performance of the bio-oil. It is difficult to remove the water completely from crude bio-oil through distillation because of the formation of azeotropes and the presence of compounds that have boiling points lower than that of water. Vacuum distillation of crude bio-oil at 328K produces about 40wt.% distillate (low-boiling fraction, LBF) and about 60wt.% high-boiling residuals. The latter can be catalytically upgraded to a liquid vehicle fuel (Li et al., 2011b). The distillate (LBF) contains about 75wt.% water and 25wt.% low boiling point oxygenated organics. Considering the large amount of water in LBF, aqueous-phase reforming (APR) (Huber and Dumesic, 2006), may be a better choice than steam reforming to utilize the organics in LBF because the reaction temperature in APR is about 400K lower than that employed in steam reforming (Tanksale et al., 2010). APR does not require high temperatures, reduces vaporization steps, and produces less CO and light hydrocarbons compared to steam reforming (SR) (Czernik et al., 2002; Garcia et al., 2000; Hou et al., 2009; Huber et al., 2006; Kan et al., 2010; Medrano et al., 2011; Rioche et al., 2005; Tokarev et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2008). APR reactions have been carried out with glycol (Wen et al., 2008), glucose (Irmak and Ozturk, 2010), glycerol (King et al., 2010; Meryemoglu et al., 2010), oxygenated hydrocarbons (Davda et al., 2005; Huber et al., 2004), sorbose (Tokarev et al., 2010), and some pyrolytic bio-oils such as biomass hydrolysates (Valenzuela et al., 2006; Meryemoglu et al., 2010, 2012) and the aqueous fraction of wood-derived pyrolysis oils (Vispute and Huber, 2009). These studies indicate that bio-oil is a feasible feedstock for the production of hydrogen. Pt is considered the best monometallic catalyst in terms of activity and selectivity for the production of hydrogen by APR, and the activity of this catalyst can be improved by supporting the metal on alumina supports (Huber and Dumesic, 2006; Meryemoglu et al., 2010). Two main reaction pathways involved in APR over Pt catalysts have been proposed (Huber and Dumesic, 2006; Menezes et al., 2011). One is the C–C bond cleavage pathway, which produces CO and H2. Adsorbed CO then reacts with water to form CO2 and H2 through the water–gas shift reaction. The process increases the amount of H2 and removes CO from the catalyst surface. The second pathway is C–O bond cleavage, which favors the formation of undesirable alkane products with a high consumption of hydrogen. Therefore, a good catalyst for production of hydrogen must facilitate C–C bond cleavage, promote removal of adsorbed CO species by the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction, and should not facilitate C–O bond cleavage and methanation of CO or CO2 (Basagiannis and Verykios, 2007; Huber and Dumesic, 2006). In the present study, the APR of LBF for hydrogen production was investigated on Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Crude bio-oil, obtained by fast pyrolysis of rice husk, was provided by the University of Science and Technology of China. The low-boiling fraction (LBF) was obtained by rotary evaporation of the crude oil at 328K under vacuum. The composition of crude bio-oil and LBF has been described previously (Peng et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011a). The LBF contains about 25wt.% organic compounds in water. Chloroplatinic acid, purchased from Hangzhou Kaiming Catalysts Co., Ltd., was used without further purification. Al2O3, purchased from Chendu Kelong Chemical Reagents Plant, was calcined at 773K for 3h before use."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation Pt/Al2O3 with a 1 and 2wt.% content of Pt was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the Al2O3 with aqueous solutions of chloroplatinic acid, followed by drying at 383K overnight, calcining at 773K in air for 3h, and reducing at 753K in a flow of H2 for 2h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the catalyst were recorded on a RIGAKU D/MAX 2550/PC diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ =1.540 56Å) at 40kV and 100mA, over a 2θ range of 10–80° with a resolution of 0.02° at a scanning speed of 6°/min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010 instrument at 300kV. The BET surface area of the sample was determined by N2 physisorption using a Micrometritics ASAP 2000 automated system. The sample was degassed at 200°C for 2h prior to N2 physisorption."
5,APR experimental procedures,"2.4 APR experimental procedures All reactions were carried out in a 100-mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an electric heating system. The dead volume of the autoclave was calibrated as 117.5ml. A given amount of LBF and water was used as APR reaction feedstock. In order to maintain the same dead space for each APR performance, the initial volume of the liquid mixture was kept at 40mL. The reactor was flushed five times with N2, and the N2 (1atm) served as internal standard. The reactor was heated to the desired temperature with stirring at a rate of 100rpm. The APR reaction was initiated by stirring the mixture at a rate of 400rpm. After the desired reaction time, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the volume of gaseous products was determined with a wet-type flowmeter. The liquid in the autoclave was separated from the catalyst by filtration through a funnel."
6,Products analysis,"2.5 Products analysis The filtrate was analyzed with a GC–MS (HP 6890GC and 5973MSD) instrument equipped with a HP-5 column. The gaseous products were analyzed on a GC (SP-6800A, Lunan Rainbow Chemical Instrument Co., Ltd. Shandong) equipped with a TDX-01 column and a TCD detector using He as carrier gas."
7,Carbon deposit determination,"2.6 Carbon deposit determination The carbon deposits on the catalyst were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) in a Perkin-Elmer TGA7HT analyzer. Before determination, the catalyst was washed with de-ionized water several times, and dried at 393K for 2h."
8,Results and discussion,"No Pt XRD peak could be identified for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and no deposits of electrodense material were seen in the TEM images (Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2), probably due to the low load of platinum. The specific surface area of the catalyst was 189m2 g−1. Results of APRs of 9.6g LBF and 30mL water, corresponding to a 6wt.% load of organics in 40mL (39.6g) aqueous solution, over 0.5g Pt/Al2O3 for different times are shown in Fig. 1 . For reaction times of 1, 4, and 8h, total gas volumes of 452, 554.5 and 822mL, respectively were collected. During the first hour, a considerable amount of methane was produced, indicating C–O bond cleavage at the beginning of the APR reaction. There are two possible pathways for methane formation, methanation of CO or CO2 and hydrogenolysis of organics (Basagiannis and Verykios, 2007; Huber and Dumesic, 2006). At 4h, a maximum H2 content of 65.9vol.% was observed. Only minor amounts of CO were detected, indicating the high efficiency of the WGS reaction. Although the least amount of gas was produced when a mixture containing 3wt.% of organics was used, the hydrogen content of the gas was the highest (Table 1 ). At an organics load of 12wt.%, the total volume of gas was 942mL, but the hydrogen content was only 53.1vol.%. At an organics load of 6wt.%, a gas volume of 554.5mL with a hydrogen content of 65.9vol.% was obtained, and this load was used to study the effect of other parameters on hydrogen production. Increasing the amount of catalyst increased the volume of gas produced (Table 2 ) and using 0.5g of 2wt.% Pt/Al2O3 gas with 65.9vol.% of hydrogen was produced. With 0.5g of 1wt.% Pt/Al2O3, of the percentage of alkanes increased, which was not favorable to hydrogen production. The results of APR carried out at different temperatures are shown in Table 3 . At 563K, about 1184mL gas was collected with the highest hydrogen content of 66.3vol.%. High temperatures seemed to favor the WGS reaction, so the content of CO at 563K was slightly lower than those at lower temperatures. The composition of the gas obtained at different temperatures was the same. Thus, temperature did not change the mechanisms of APR, but only increased the speed of reaction. The main organic components of LBF before and after mixing with water and of the liquid product after APR are listed in Tables 4–6 , respectively. Before APR, dozens of organics were detected in the LBF, but only about half of them were still detectable after dilution with water. After APR, the main compound was acetic acid. The content of other organic compounds was decreased to less than 4% (by area on the chromatograms). Compared with the biomass hydrolysates (Valenzuela et al., 2006; Meryemoglu et al., 2010, 2012) and the aqueous fraction of wood-derived pyrolysis oils (Vispute and Huber, 2009), the organics in LBF had lower carbon numbers, hence a higher hydrogen selectivity was achieved (Tanksale et al., 2010). TG curve of the catalyst, shown in Fig. 2 , indicated the presence of about 15wt.% of carbon, however, since carbon was also deposited on the wall of the autoclave, it was not possible to calculate the carbon balance of the APR reaction."
9,Conclusions,"APR is a promising route to make use of the oxygenated organics in LBF of bio-oil to produce hydrogen. Over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the hydrogen concentration reached about 65vol.% in the gas products. Prolonging the reaction time and increasing the temperature resulted in higher hydrogen yields and relative constant hydrogen content. Because of the complexity of the system, further research needs to be done to elucidate the conversion mechanisms."
