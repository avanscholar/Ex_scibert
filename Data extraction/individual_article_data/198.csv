0,Introduction,"With depletion of fossil energy and the increasing environmental issues, utilization of non-fossil carbon-based resources has received considerable attention from both academia and industry. Biomass is a promising resource due to its abundant reserves and renewable advantages [1]. Thus, production of renewable fuels and chemicals from biomass is an active field of research. Furfural (FF), which can be produced by acid-catalyzed dehydration of five‑carbon sugars, is one of the top value-added chemicals derived from biomass [2]. FF can be selectively hydrogenated to valuable products, such as furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2-methyl furan (MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) [3,4]. FA is an important intermediate for the manufacture of foundry resins, furan fiber-reinforced plastics, lubricants, fragrances, pharmaceuticals and pesticides [5]. FA production makes use of ~65% of the furfural produced globally [6]. Thus, improving catalyst performance for FA production from FF is an important subject and it has received great interest, especially in China which produces most of FF (about 70% production capacity in the world). The synthesis of FA is performed via catalytic hydrogenation of FF in gas or liquid phase [7]. Gas phase technology is preferred owing to its advantages, such as low cost, recoverable and reusable catalyst, low operating pressure, and low waste output [8]. The copper chromite catalyst (CuCr system) was usually used in the gas phase hydrogenation process. However, the presence of chromium species, which is hazardous to environment and human health, and its moderate activity has motivated the development of Cr-free catalysts [9]. Up to now, numerous Cr-free catalysts have been reported [10–21]. Pd, Pt, Co, Ni and Fe have been applied for the hydrogenation of FF. However, only silica supported copper catalyst (SiCu system) has been regarded as the most promising industrially applicable catalyst. The SiCu system has been optimized in terms of preparation method, promoter and support [22]. Wu et al. discovered that the Cu–Ca/SiO2 catalyst prepared by sol–gel method showed higher copper dispersion and higher activity than the catalyst derived from impregnation [21]. The activity and stability of Cu/SiO2 catalyst synthesized by ammonia evaporation for FF hydrogenation to MF are superior to that of the catalyst prepared by precipitation [23]. Introducing an appropriate amount of TiO2 into the Cu/SiO2 catalyst enhanced the yield of FA due to improved dispersity of Cu particles and inhibited growth of Cu particles [14]. These studies suggest that the preparation methods and promoter addition have obvious influence on the copper dispersion and hence on the FF hydrogenation performance. Besides, Cu/SiO2 has been widely used for the hydrogenation of ester and CO2 [22,24]. Dong et al. [25] illustrated that Cu/SiO2 catalyst synthesized from different methods showed different catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of methyl acetate to ethanol. The activity was in the order of ammonia evaporation derived sample > homogeneous deposition–precipitation assisted by urea hydrolysis derived sample > sample prepared by ion-exchange > deposition–precipitation derived sample. Urea hydrolysis derived Cu/SBA-15 catalyst was more efficient for methyl acetate hydrogenation to ethanol compared to the sample prepared by impregnation [26]. However, Compared with impregnation derived Cu/SiO2 catalyst, Cu/SiO2 prepared by homogeneous deposition–precipitation assisted by urea hydrolysis presented lower activity and higher stability for methanol synthesis from syngas [27]. The Cu/SiO2 catalyst accomplished by deposition precipitation using ammonium carbonate exhibited superior performance than ammonia evaporation method derived catalyst for the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol [28]. Thus, it can be speculated that preparation methods of Cu/SiO2 samples have different impact on the performances for different reactions. In order to design and optimize the FA production catalyst, the effect of Cu/SiO2 catalyst synthesis methods on the performance of FF selective hydrogenation to FA has to be systematically studied. Thus, this study investigated the effect of preparation methods for fumed silica supported copper catalysts on the performance of FF hydrogenation to FA under identical testing conditions. A commercial Cr2CuO4 catalyst from Strem was also included in this study as a bench mark."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99.99%) and fumed silica (named as SiO2, 100 m2/g) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Inc. Ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O), urea and sodium carbonate were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The spherical silica (250–380 μm, named as SiO2-QD) was purchased from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd. A commercial copper based hydrogenation catalyst (denoted as CuCr-Strem), which was made up of 62–64% Cr2CuO4, 6% BaO and 0–4% graphite, was purchased from Strem Chemicals as a reference. FF was procured from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The chemicals were used directly without purification except for FF. FF was distilled before employ."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The SiO2 supported Cu catalysts were prepared by impregnation (IM), ion exchange (IE), deposition precipitation (DP), urea hydrolysis induced homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and homogeneous precipitation induced by ammonia evaporation (EA), which are denoted as Cu/SiO2-IM, Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-DP, Cu/SiO2-HDP and Cu/SiO2-EA, respectively. As a comparison, Cu/SiO2-QD was prepared by impregnation using SiO2-QD as support. The nominal Cu loading of these catalysts was 20 wt%. Cu/SiO2-IM catalyst was prepared as listed below. 4.75 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 50 g deionized water. 5 g SiO2 was immersed in the solution. The mixture was aged at 333 K for 12 h under stirring. The obtained solid was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. Cu/SiO2-IE catalyst was prepared according to the method reported by Ge et al. [25]. 5 g SiO2 was added into a solution containing 4.75 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 8 mL NH3·H2O under stirring. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Solid was received by filtration and was washed with deionized water three times. Then the solid was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. Cu/SiO2-DP was synthesized by deposition precipitation using Na2CO3 as precipitator [26]. Firstly, 4.75 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 50 g deionized water. 5 g of SiO2 was dispersed in the solution and then stirred for 0.5 h. Then, 1 M Na2CO3 aqueous was added in dropwise until the pH of solution increased to about 8. The obtained mixture was aged for 3 h under stirring at room temperature. The solid was obtained by filtration and then washed for three times with deionized water. The material was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. Cu/SiO2-HDP catalyst was synthesized via a modified method of van der Grift et al. [29]. 4.75 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 11.8 g urea were added to 100 g deionized water. 5 g SiO2 was introduced to the vessel under stirring and then stirred for 1 h. The mixture was heated to 363 K and hold on this temperature under stirring for 24 h. The precipitate was obtained by hot filtration and then washed by deionized water three times. The obtained solid was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. Cu/SiO2-EA was prepared by ammonia evaporation method similar to Ma et al. [30]. 4.75 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 60 g of deionized water, and 8 mL of NH3·H2O was added within 30 min under agitation. Then, 5 g of SiO2 was added into the solution. The initial pH of the suspension was about 9–10. After stirring for 4 h at 303 K, the temperature was increased to 363 K to allow for the evaporation of ammonia and the deposition of copper species onto the silica. When the pH value of the suspension decreased to 6–7, the evaporation procedure was terminated. The filtrate was washed with deionized water. The obtained solid was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. Cu/SiO2-QD was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method according to the following procedure: the spherical SiO2 was impregnated at room temperature with an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. Then the sample was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. All the SiO2 derived samples were pressed and sieved to 40–60 mesh particles for future use. A fraction of samples was reduced under a flow of 10% H2/Ar at 523 K for 3 h and then passivated using 1% O2/N2 at room temperature for characterization. The obtained samples were denoted as passivated samples."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The N2 physisorption measurement was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 instrument at 77 K. About 50 mg calcined sample was applied for test. The sample was degassed for 5 h at 573 K before measurement. The specific surface area (SBET) was estimated based on the N2 isotherm using the BET method. The total pore volume (Vp) was obtained from the N2 amount adsorbed at a relative pressure close to unity. The pore size distribution was determined by the BJH method. The actual copper loading was determined by PerkinElmer Optima 8000 inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The calcined sample was dissolved in the aqueous mixture of HF and HNO3. The solution was used for measurement. The ex-situ X-ray diffraction (ex-situ XRD) measurements were conducted on a PANalytical X'Pert Powder equipment with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The spectra were recorded (2θ = 5–80°) at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scan speed of 5°/min. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) tests were carried out on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50. The calcined sample was mixed KBr with the mass ratio of 1/100, and then the mixture was grounded finely and pelletized. The spectra were collected with resolution of 4 cm−1 and 64 scans. The in-situ X-ray diffraction (in-situ XRD) experiments were performed using the Anton Paar XRK 900 reaction chamber on a PANalytical X'Pert3 instrument. The species evolution was monitored for copper samples during the temperature programmed reduction (5 K/min, from room temperature to 773 K) in a flow of H2. The data were collected ranging from 10 to 80°. The patterns were collected with a temperature interval of 20 K. Copper species particles in the calcined catalyst, passivated samples and spent samples were observed with TEM (JEM-2100). The samples were dispersed in ethanol. A few drops of the resulting suspension were then deposited on the TEM grid. Then, the grid was applied for observation. The nature of copper species in the calcined samples and fresh samples was measured by near ambient pressure in-situ XPS using EnviroESCA. Firstly, the calcined samples were pressed into sheet and fixed on the sample holder. The XPS spectra of calcined samples were collected in a flow of Ar at 1 mbar and room temperature. Then, the calcined sample was heated to 523 K and maintained for 2 h in a flow of 10% H2/Ar at 10 mbar. The XPS spectra of fresh catalysts were collected after the reduction treatment. The C 1s peak was used as the reference at 284.8 eV. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II instrument. 90 mg of calcined sample was first flushed with argon at 393 K for 0.5 h and then cooled down to 323 K. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 1073 K (10 K/min) in a flow of 5% H2/Ar mixture at 50 mL/min. TCD signal was recorded from 323 K to 1073 K. The metallic Cu specific surface area and copper dispersion were also measured on the same apparatus used for H2-TPR. The N2O titration process includes the following three steps: firstly, about 70 mg calcined sample was degassed at 393 K for 30 min under Ar followed by cooling to 323 K. Then the sample was reduced in a flow of 5% H2/Ar, the reactor was heated to 523 K from room temperature at a ramping rate of 10 K/min. The amount of H2 consumed was recorded by TCD and labeled as A. Secondly, the sample was flushed with Ar for 30 min upon the temperature was lowered to 333 K. Then the 10% N2O/Ar gas was introduced and lasted for 60 min to oxidation of surface metallic copper into Cu2O. Finally, the sample was purged with Ar for 30 min and then cooled to 523 K. Then sample was heated to 773 K in a flow of 5% H2/Ar with a heating rate of 10 K/min. The consumed H2 amount was monitored by TCD and denoted as B. The dispersion (DCu) of metallic copper and exposed Cu specific surface (SCu) were calculated from the following formulas [31]: D Cu = 2 × B A × 100 % S Cu = 2 × B × N A A × M Cu × 1.46 × 10 19 where NA is Avogadro's constant (6.02 × 1023 atoms mol−1), MCu is the molar mass of copper (63.546 g/mol), 1.46 × 1019 is the number of copper atoms per m2. The carbon content was measured on the VARIO Elementar. The thermo gravimetric analysis (TG) measurement was performed on the NETZSCH STA 449 F3 under air flow (sample mass: 10 mg, flow rate: 20 mL/min, heating rate: 10 K/min)."
5,Catalyst evaluation,"2.4 Catalyst evaluation FF hydrogenation reaction in gas phase was carried out in a stainless fixed-bed micro-reactor with an inner diameter of 9 mm. In each test, 1 g of calcined catalyst was packed at the center of the reactor. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was in-situ reduced at 523 K for 3 h in a flow of H2. After the reactor cooled to the desired reaction temperature (403 K), FF was fed into the reactor by plunger pump. The reaction conditions were selected based on the previous publications [3,21]. The relative higher FA selectivity was obtained in these studies. Typical test conditions were set to atmospheric pressure, a H2/FF molar ratio of 12, and the weight liquid hourly space velocity of FF (WHSV) of 0.4 or 1.8 h−1. The products were condensed with a cold trap and then analyzed by an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with HP-5 capillary column attached with a flame ionization detector. The conversion of FF and the selectivity of the products were calculated by the equations as follows: Conversion of FF % = 100 − moles of FF residual moles of FF initially × 100 Selectivity % = mole of specific product sum of mole of FF consumed × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The actual Cu loadings of calcined samples determined by ICP test are listed in Table 1 . The actual loadings were close to the respective nominal loadings except for IE derived sample. Since a large portion of copper precursors still remained in the solution in the form of copper–ammonia complexes after the stirring for 12 h, so the Cu loading of Cu/SiO2-IE was relative low. The low real loading has been reported for ion exchange derived sample [25]. N2 physisorption was performed to study the effect of catalyst preparation strategies on the textural properties. The specific surface areas (SBET), total pore volumes (VP) as well as average pore size (DP) of the support and calcined samples are shown in Table 1. The corresponding N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of calcined samples are shown in Fig. S1. The SBET and VP of the SiO2 support are 158 m2/g and 0.42 cm3/g. After incorporation of copper by IM, the VP increased to 0.60 cm3/g, whereas the SBET decreased to 121 m2/g. The results reveal that larger copper particles formed in the Cu/SiO2-IM sample. Similar comments were reported by Nouali et al. [32]. Surprisingly, the SBET of SiO2 supported catalysts derived from IE, HDP and EA increased from 158 for SiO2 to 221, 357 and 386 cm2/g, respectively. And the VP of the three samples also increased compared to the support. The variant in these textural parameters suggest that the textural properties have been changed during the catalyst preparation stages. Based on the following XRD results (Fig. 1), FTIR spectra (Fig. 2), XPS spectra (Fig. 3A) and TEM images (Fig. 4), the EA, HDP as well as IE methods lead to the formation of phyllosilicate in the catalysts, which resulted in the increasing of SBET [25,33,34]. N2 physisorption was performed to study the effect of catalyst preparation strategies on the textural properties. The specific surface areas (SBET), total pore volumes (VP) as well as average pore size (DP) of the support and calcined samples are shown in Table 1. The corresponding N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of calcined samples are shown in Fig. S1. The SBET and VP of the SiO2 support are 158 m2/g and 0.42 cm3/g. After incorporation of copper by IM, the VP increased to 0.60 cm3/g, whereas the SBET decreased to 121 m2/g. The results reveal that larger copper particles formed in the Cu/SiO2-IM sample. Similar comments were reported by Nouali et al. [32]. Surprisingly, the SBET of SiO2 supported catalysts derived from IE, HDP and EA increased from 158 for SiO2 to 221, 357 and 386 cm2/g, respectively. And the VP of the three samples also increased compared to the support. The variant in these textural parameters suggest that the textural properties have been changed during the catalyst preparation stages. Based on the following XRD results (Fig. 1), FTIR spectra (Fig. 2), XPS spectra (Fig. 3A) and TEM images (Fig. 4), the EA, HDP as well as IE methods lead to the formation of phyllosilicate in the catalysts, which resulted in the increasing of SBET [25,33,34]. XRD patterns of dried and calcined samples are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. A broad diffraction line at about 22° was attributed to the amorphous silica support [35]. There are several peaks, which are related to the basic copper nitrate species, appeared for the dried Cu/SiO2-IM sample. The weak peaks from basic copper nitrate were also detected in dried Cu/SiO2-DP sample. Different from the IM and DP derived samples, the dried samples derived from EA, HDP and IE methods demonstrated typical diffraction peaks from copper phyllosilicate (2θ = 31.2°, 35.8°, 57.3° and 63.2°, PDF 00-003-0219). The similar relative weak intensity of diffraction peaks from copper phyllosilicate was reported [33]. This denoted that the copper phyllosilicate structure formed before calcination for Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-HDP as well as Cu/SiO2-EA samples. As displayed in Fig. 1b, several sharp diffraction peaks (2θ = 32.5°, 35.5°, 38.7°, 48.7°, 53.4°, 58.3°, 61.5°, 65.7°, 68.0°, 72.3° and 75.0°) were observed in calcined Cu/SiO2-IM sample. According to PDF 01-080-1916, these peaks can be assigned to bulk CuO. The major peaks attributed to the CuO were also presented in Cu/SiO2-DP sample, but the intensity of the peaks was lower than that of impregnation derived sample. This signifies that the copper oxide particle size was small for the DP sample. For the EA, HDP as well as IE derived samples, peaks belong to bulk CuO were not detected. The absence of peaks from CuO indicated that CuO species resulted from the decomposition of copper phyllosilicate may be highly dispersed on the support. And characteristic peaks of copper phyllosilicate were also seen for calcined samples, which suggested that copper phyllosilicate was partly retained after calcination. In other words, the copper oxide may be highly dispersed in the matrix of phyllosilicate for calcined EA, HDP as well as IE derived samples. FTIR was applied to verify the copper phyllosilicate structure was partly retained in calcined samples. The FTIR spectra of the calcined samples prepared by different methods are shown in Fig. 2. The bands at approximately 470, 800 and 1110 cm−1 presented in all the samples are assigned to the different vibration modes of the SiO bonds in amorphous SiO2 [37]. The peaks at 674 cm−1 and 1035 cm−1 were clearly observed in the spectra of Cu/SiO2-HDP and Cu/SiO2-EA samples (Fig. 2e and f). These two peaks with weak intensity were also seen in the spectra of Cu/SiO2-IE (Fig. 2d) sample. The appearance of vibrations at 674 and 1035 cm−1 suggests that the existence of copper phyllosilicate in the samples [30]. While the copper phyllosilicate species were not detected for the samples produced by IM and DP. The observation is in agreed well with the results from XRD (Fig. 1b). In order to further testify the copper species in calcined samples, the XPS test was carried out. The binding energy (BE) of Cu 2p3/2 was 935.6 eV for Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-HDP and Cu/SiO2-EA samples (Fig. 3Ab, Ac and Ad). Cu 2p3/2 peak at 933.8 eV was observed for Cu/SiO2-DP sample (Fig. 3Aa). Chen et al. reported that the 935.6 eV and 933.1 eV were assigned to the two type of Cu2+, namely CuO and copper phyllosilicate, respectively [34]. Therefore, copper phyllosilicate was existed in calcined Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-HDP and Cu/SiO2-EA samples, while the CuO was existed in Cu/SiO2-DP sample. Furthermore, the morphology of calcined samples was assessed using TEM. The lamellar structure was observed in calcined Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-HDP and Cu/SiO2-EA samples (Fig. 4c, d, e). The existence of randomly oriented lamellar structure verified the copper phyllosilicate formation [25,34,36]. However, the lamellar structure was not observed in calcined Cu/SiO2-IM and Cu/SiO2-DP samples. The copper species particle dispersed on the silica was seen (Fig. 4a, b). Combined the XRD (Fig. 1b), FTIR (Fig. 2), XPS (Fig. 3A) and TEM (Fig. 4a–e) results, it can be confirmed that the copper phyllosilicate was existed in Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-HDP and Cu/SiO2-EA samples, whereas the copper oxide was existed in Cu/SiO2-IM and Cu/SiO2-DP samples. H2-TPR was used to investigate the reducibility of the calcined samples. As displayed in Fig. 5 , the TPR profiles of catalysts synthesized by EA, HDP, IE and DP methods exhibited a single hydrogen consumption peak at about 200–220 °C, which was ascribed to the reduction of highly dispersed Cu2+ species with particle size smaller than 10.5 nm [29]. For Cu/SiO2-IM, in addition to a major reduction peak at about 230 °C, a diminutive hydrogen consumption peak at 280 °C appeared. The presence of the peaks at 230 as well as 280 °C suggested that there are two types of copper species in the IM-derived sample, namely well dispersed Cu2+ species and bulk copper oxide. Shen et al. reported that transformation of well dispersed CuO to Cu and reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ or Cu0 were occurred at same temperature range [38]. Thus, whether the Cu0 or Cu+ is the predominant phase in the activated samples will be confirmed by in-situ XRD and near ambient pressure in-situ XPS. In order to identify the transformation of copper species during H2-TPR, the in-situ XRD experiments were performed with the conditions similar to H2-TPR. For the Cu/SiO2-IM sample (Fig. 6a), the metallic Cu (2θ = 43.2, 50.3 and 73.9°, PDF No. 01-070-3038) came from the reduction of CuO at the temperature higher than 140 °C. In Fig. 6b, the phase evolution of Cu/SiO2-DP during reduction is similar to that of Cu/SiO2-IM sample. When the temperature shifted to 160 °C, the peaks assigned to CuO were almost absent for Cu/SiO2-DP, whereas it was also observed in Cu/SiO2-IM. This means the copper species in the IM derived sample was relative hard to reduce than the Cu/SiO2-DP sample. The phenomenon was in line with the H2-TPR (Fig. 5). The XRD profiles during reduction for Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-HDP, Cu/SiO2-EA are analogous. Take Fig. 6e as example, the diffraction peaks resulted from Cu0 appeared at 140 °C. The intensity of the peaks belonging to Cu0 increased with the rising of temperature on the expense of copper phyllosilicate. The peaks assigned to copper phyllosilicate almost disappeared at temperature higher than 240 °C. The changes for the copper species during in-situ XRD illustrated that copper phyllosilicate can be reduced to metallic copper under the conditions used in the FF hydrogenation reaction (reduction conditions: H2, 250 °C, 3 h). Besides, peaks belong to Cu2O has not been observed during the reduction process. This means that the Cu+ species was not existed or existed as highly dispersed species in the fresh samples. The evolution of copper species for IE and HDP samples is parallel to Cu/SiO2-EA. Based on the results of XRD (Fig. 1b), H2-TPR (Fig. 5) and in-situ XRD (Fig. 6), the calcined copper based catalysts using fumed silica as support derived from EA, HDP and IE ways comprise mainly highly dispersed CuO and copper phyllosilicate, the DP derived sample mainly contained CuO with high dispersion, whereas the samples prepared by impregnation comprise both well dispersed CuO and bulk copper oxide. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of fresh samples were recorded in-situ (250 °C, 3 h) after reduction in XRK chamber without exposing to air and exhibited in Fig. 7 . The characteristic peaks (2θ = 43.3, 50.4 and 74.1°) of metallic copper were found on the fresh catalysts. The metallic copper was the single phase detected for fresh samples, which confirmed the consequence from in-situ XRD (Fig. 6) analysis. The particle size of Cu0 estimated by Scherrer equation was listed in Table 1. The metallic copper particle size increase follows the sequence of Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-EA, Cu/SiO2-HDP, Cu/SiO2-DP and Cu/SiO2-IM. In order to detect whether highly dispersed Cu+ species exist or not in the surface of fresh samples, near ambient pressure in-situ XPS test was carried out. The spectra of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu LMM XANES are shown in Fig. 3B and C, respectively. Compared to Cu2p BE of calcined samples (Fig. 3A), the peaks at 940–945 eV and 960–965 eV disappeared in the spectra of fresh samples. In addition, the peak at 933.8 eV has been shifted to about 932.6 eV. The alterations suggest that the Cu2+ had been reduced to Cu+ or Cu0 during the in-situ reduction. Since the Cu 2p BE of Cu+ and Cu0 are almost identical from XPS spectra, the modified Auger parameter (Table 2 ) was used to distinguish the Cu+ and Cu0. The modified Auger parameter equal to the sum of the BE of Cu 2p3/2 and the kinetic energy (KE) of Cu LMM Auger electron [34]. The value of modified Auger parameter at approximately 1847 eV and 1851 eV are ascribed to Cu+ and Cu0, respectively [34]. The results from Table 2 demonstrate that Cu+ and Cu0 coexisted on the surface of fresh samples. It can be seen that the molar ratio of Cu+/(Cu0 + Cu+) for Cu/SiO2-DP is lower than other samples, which has abundant of copper phyllosilicate in their calcined precursor. TEM was applied to survey the morphology of the passivated samples (Fig. 4f–j). From the TEM images of passivated samples, it can be seen that the copper species nanoparticles with small particle size were dispersed uniformly on the SiO2 support for Cu/SiO2-IE, Cu/SiO2-HDP and Cu/SiO2-EA samples (Fig. 4h, i and j). However, there were dominating high dispersed copper species particles and some aggregates appeared on the DP derived sample (Fig. 4g). For the Cu/SiO2-IM sample (Fig. 4f), most of copper species were existed in the form of copper particle aggregates. The trend of metallic copper particle size obtained by N2O titration is consistent with the results from XRD. Also, the exposed metallic copper specific surface area (SCu) and Cu dispersion (DCu) were calculated by dissociative N2O chemisorption and listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the preparation method had great influence on the SCu and DCu. Compared to the IM sample (SCu = 9.6 m2/g), all other catalysts exhibited higher Cu surface area and dispersion, presumably due to the formation of strong interaction between Cu and SiO2 species which can be instrumental in preventing thermal transmigration and sintering of Cu nanoparticles upon thermal treatment. The EA derived sample has the highest SCu and DCu."
8,Catalytic performances,"3.2 Catalytic performances The fumed silica supported copper catalysts prepared by various methods were applied for the catalytic FF hydrogenation to FA in gas phase. The influences of preparation methods on the performance were evaluated in terms of FF conversion, FA selectivity as well as stability. The FF conversion and FA selectivity were obtained for different catalysts under different FF flow rate, and the results are listed in Table 3 . For the commercial CuCr-Strem catalyst, the FF conversion is 99.5 and 63.9% under the WHSV of FF is 0.4 and 1.8, respectively. Compared to the CuCr-Strem catalyst, the activity (FF conversion is 24.8 and 3.1%) of Cu/SiO2-IM is lower. The FF conversion of Cu/SiO2-IM is even smaller than that of Cu/SiO2-QD, which was also prepared by impregnation using spherical SiO2 as support. When the reaction was carried out under lower WHSV (0.4 h−1), FF conversion over the catalysts synthesized by DP, IE, HDP and EA methods are similar, which are higher than that of CuCr-Strem sample. The active sites of metallic copper in DP, IE, HDP and EA derived catalysts were sufficient for FF adsorption and active under lower WHSV. Thus, the similar FF conversion with high value was obtained. Upon the WHSV of FF shifted to 1.8 h−1, the catalytic differences among these four samples were observed. The Cu/SiO2-EA exhibited the best performance while Cu/SiO2-IE showed poor. FF conversion related to the following issues. Firstly, the FF conversion is proportional to the metallic copper sites in the fresh samples. Secondly, FF hydrogenation over copper catalyst is a structural sensitivity reaction. Mérida-Robles et al. discovered that the TOF value increased with the decreasing of copper particle size in the Cu/SBA-15 catalysts prepared by IM [19]. The same conclusion was also obtained for EA derived Cu/SiO2 catalyst [39]. This means that copper particle with smaller size has higher intrinsic activity. Thirdly, Dandekar et al. reported that Cu+ species is capable of adoption and activation of the aldehyde group [40]. Thus, the existence of moderate amount of Cu+ species would promote the FF conversion. Finally, the sequence of FF conversion was in line with the order of surface area and pore volume of catalysts. The large of the catalyst might be beneficial for FF transfer then promote the conversion of FF. As a result，the highest copper surface area, smallest copper particle size, large surface area and pore volume as well as appropriate higher Cu+/(Cu+ + Cu0) ratio of the Cu/SiO2-EA catalyst responsible for its best FF hydrogenation performance. As listed in Table 3, the FA is the major product, and the selectivity towards FA is higher than 98% in all cases. The higher FA selectivity was also obtained over sol-gel method derived Cu/SiO2 catalyst conducted by Wu et al. under similar moderate reaction conditions [21]. The sole by-product is MF, which was resulted from the hydrogenolysis of FA [41]. The reference has been reported that the formation of MF would be promoted under the lower WHSV of FF, higher H2/FF ratio and especially higher temperature [20]. Thus, the similar product selectivity was observed over different samples under the moderate reaction conditions in the study. Since the stability is pivotal for the academic research and industrial application, the long-term catalytic performance of copper catalysts were assessed. The results were displayed in Fig. 8 . The stability of copper catalysts prepared by impregnation is similar in spite of different silica support used. The Cu/SiO2-DP showed superior stability than the impregnated catalysts. However, the Cu/SiO2-DP exhibited poor stability compared with CuCr-Strem catalyst. The copper catalysts synthesized from HDP and EA methods exhibit excellent stability for FF hydrogenation. The phyllosilicate structure resulted in the higher Cu0 surface area and higher molar ratio of Cu+/(Cu+ + Cu0) for HDP and EA derived samples, which put up outstanding performance for FA formation. Low copper loading take charge in the relative bad stability for IE derived catalyst. The FF conversion is still higher than 90% after 425 h running for Cu/SiO2-EA. Although the Cu/SiO2-EA sample exhibited excellent stability, the catalyst deactivated during the whole reaction process with a slow deactivation rate. Thus the deactivation reason was analyzed. The previous reports covered that the copper sintering and carbon deposition are major factors that may lead to the deactivation of copper catalysts [42–44]. To investigate whether the copper sintering was the major source for the deactivation or not, the XRD measurement for passivated samples and spent catalysts were conducted and the corresponding XRD patterns are also displayed in Fig. 9 . The peak position and intensity of studied catalysts has no obvious differences between the passivated and spent samples, indicating that the copper species forms and particle size have not changed during reaction. The TEM images (Fig. 4k–o) of spent samples show that the morphology of spent catalysts exhibited no obvious difference compared to the passivated samples (Fig. 4f–j). These results reveal that agglomeration of copper particles did not occurred under the moderate reaction conditions (130 °C). Therefore, the deactivation of the catalysts was hardly related to the copper sintering. The structure properties of the spent samples were assessed. SBET of spent Cu/SiO2-EA and Cu/SiO2-HDP is 42 and 33 m2/g, respectively. And the VP is 0.19 and 0.15 cm3/g for the spent Cu/SiO2-EA and Cu/SiO2-HDP. The losses of SBET and VP for the EA and HDP samples are greatest. Then, the elemental analysis and TG characterization were carried out for the spent catalysts, which were obtained after stability test (Fig. 8), to survey that whether carbon deposition occurred during FF hydrogenation or not. The results of elemental analysis (Table 1) reveal that carbon deposition took place during reaction for all the copper catalysts. The catalyst ran for longer time has high carbon content. The carbon deposition was resulted from the polymerization between the furfuryl alcohol molecule and furfural that was not conversed. As depicted in Fig. 10 , all of the spent catalysts present obvious weight loss between 200 and 500 °C. The weight loss during air treatment was related to the carbon oxidation [42]. The sample have higher amount of carbon content exhibited larger weight loss. This means that the mass increased obviously for the sample used for longer time which have large amount of carbon species deposition. Thus, the structural variation might be resulted from the pore block by carbon species matter and the increasing of sample mass from deposited carbon species that almost has no pores itself. From the stability results (Fig. 8), it can be seen that the EA method derived catalyst also exhibited relative higher furfural conversion after >400 h, when the surface area of the sample has decreased to 42 m2/g. The performance data suggested that the large amount of active sites still expose to the reactant. In other word, the decreasing of the surface area was not mainly resulted from the pore blocking. The mass increasing played a major role. Thus the coverage of active sites resulted from carbon deposition, which led to the reduction of active sites content, is the major reason for the deactivation. Besides, certain degree of pore blocking resulted from carbon deposition, which prevented reactants diffusing to the remaining active sites, is the secondary cause for the deactivation. Mérida-Robles et al. [19] reported that carbonaceous deposits caused the deactivation of Cu/SBA-15 based FF hydrogenation catalysts as well. Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the deactivation rate is related to the exposed active sites and the remaining SBET of catalyst. Since all the catalysts undergo carbon deposition, the catalysts with higher copper surface area show better stability. And the catalysts with higher SBET improve the stability due to the relative slow pore blockage rate. Therefore, the highest Cu dispersion and surface area is responsible for the best performance of the Cu/SiO2-EA catalyst among all the catalysts that had been investigated."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, FA manufacture from FF hydrogenation in gas phase over Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared by different methods has been investigated. The textural properties and copper states in the calcined samples were affected obviously by the preparation methods. Also, the FF hydrogenation performance was found to depend significantly on the catalyst synthesis methods. The catalytic performance of Cu/SiO2-IM is poorer than that of commercial CuCr-Strem catalyst. The DP and IE derived catalysts demonstrated the similar performance with CuCr-Strem sample. The Cu/SiO2-HDP showed superior performance than that of CuCr-Strem catalyst. The EA derived sample exhibited the best performance among the studied catalysts in the stand of FF conversion and FA selectivity (FF conversion was 85.2% and FA selectivity was 99% under the WHSV of FF was 1.8 h−1) as well as stability (FF conversion was higher than 90% after 425 h running under the WHSV of FF was 0.4 h−1). Characterization of the catalysts reveals that the FF hydrogenation performances are related to the exposed metallic copper surface area, copper particle, textural structure as well as Cu+ species in the activated samples. The deactivation of copper catalysts used in the study was resulted from the carbon deposition. The best performance of Cu/SiO2-EA catalyst was attributed to the highest copper dispersion, exposed metallic copper surface area, large surface area and pore volume as well as appropriate higher Cu+/(Cu+ + Cu0) ratio.
