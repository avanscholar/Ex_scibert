0,Introduction,"Compression ignition engines have been popular all over the world due to relatively high efficiency and reliability, fuel savings, longer life and high torque [1,2]. A typical fuel for compression-ignition engines is diesel fuel derived from crude oil, with its combustion involving substantial emissions of engine exhaust components such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (THC), carbon oxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM). It is known that global oil reserves are limited while production of diesel fuel is becoming more expensive. Combustion of fossil fuels, such as petroleum, leads to air pollution, climatic changes and gradual increase in mean global temperature. Most of CO2 emissions generated all over the world by people are connected with combustion of fossil fuels [3–6]. The contribution of carbon dioxide to the effects of global warming and climate change is commonly known. Therefore, the EU set forth far-reaching objectives to reduce emissions. The European Parliament adopted the Directive 2009/28/EC on promotion of the use of energy from renewable resources. Mandatory targets of 20% were defined for the percentage of energy from renewable sources in total energy consumptions for the countries of the European Union by 2020 [7]. The document also stipulates that the EU member states should increase the share of biofuels in total consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel in transport to at least 10% [8]. Furthermore, more and more urban complexes all over the world are going to impose a ban on vehicles with diesel engines. The ban is expected to reduce air pollution. By 2025, vehicles with conventional diesel engines will have been ousted from the streets of Paris, Athens, Mexico and Madrid [9]. Biofuels can offer an alternative to fossil fuels and be considered a renewable source of energy to be derived from processing of biomass from plants or animal matter, even using microalgae [10–12]. Emissions of toxic components of engine exhaust gas can be reduced by a controlled process of combustion inside the engine cylinder or by external exhaust treatment systems [13–18]. Modern exhaust treatment technologies, including oxidation catalyst, diesel particulate filter (DPF) and NOx reduction catalyst often do not lead to simultaneous reduction in both particulate matter and NOx. Nowadays, co-combustion of fossil fuels is gaining in popularity, thus reducing emissions of toxic compounds of fuels. Of liquid biofuels, alcohols are being used more and more frequently. The most popular are methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl alcohols. Although alcohols are not perfect fuels for diesel engines due to their low heating value, high latent heat of vaporization and substantial higher self-ignition temperature compared to diesel fuel, methyl and ethyl alcohols have been attracting much interest as replacement engine fuels compared to conventional ones [19–21]. Alcohols are fuels with substantial oxygen content (for example, half mass fraction of methanol is oxygen). Oxygen contained in fuel is conducive to intensification of the combustion process by increasing the phase of kinetic combustion at the expense of the diffusive phase and leading to the increased heat release rate and improved engine thermal efficiency [22–24]. Alcohols are characterized by a low cetane number, which virtually prevents from their direct use in the compression ignition engines. In recent years, alcohol fuels have been widely used in compression ignition engines with dual-fuel systems for combined combustion of alcohol and diesel [25,26]. Co-combustion can potentially reduce formation of nitrogen oxides which is generated in the premixed part and the post flame region and soot which is generated in the diffusion flame during combustion of diesel fuel [27,28]. Dual fuel combustion in compression ignition engines is ensured in two main ways. With the first method, previously prepared blend of diesel fuel and alcohol is supplied through the injection system to the engine cylinder. The second solution is alcohol fumigation through injection of liquid alcohol to the collector in the area of the inlet value and direct injection of diesel fuel to the cylinder. The first method is easier yet it has several drawbacks. Firstly, mixing lower alcohols with diesel fuel is difficult while the blends are characterized by phase instability and tends to become clouded and stratified. In case of higher alcohols as 1-butanol and 2-propanol with diesel the mixtures are stable. Therefore, stabilizing agents are needed. Secondly, it is impossible to control the content of the blend during engine's operation. With this solution, there is no need for a substantial modification of the engine. With the second method of dual-fuel combustion, with two independent fuel supply systems, additional injector, separate fuel tank, pipes and control components are needed. Despite this drawback, the solution offers several benefits, such as control of the moment of ignition through injection of a diesel fuel dose and accuracy of changes in alcohol-diesel fuel ratio depending on different conditions of engine operation. In this solution, it is usually necessary to modify the injection timing. Recent years have seen intensifying explorations of opportunities to use alcohol-based fuels in compression ignition engines. In paper [28], ethanol dual-fuel combustion was examined experimentally using a heavy duty diesel engine operating at 1200 rpm and IMEP equal to 0.615 MPa. The impact of various ethanol fractions and different diesel injection strategies on combustion, emissions and efficiency were analysed and discussed. Two separate engine calibrations with the highest efficiency and lowest emissions were quantified, complete with effects from EGR, intake air pressure, and injection pressure. Uses split diesel injection technology in dual fuel engine fuelled by ethanol causes higher indicated efficiency compared to diesel-only operation. A split injection strategy adjusted the mixture flammability and promoted in-cylinder reactivity gradients, increasing the fuel conversion efficiency and reducing CO and unburnt THC emissions. The split diesel injection strategy used in this work allowed for control over combustion phasing without the need for varying the overall fuel reactivity (i.e. ethanol substitution ratio). With the best emissions, NOx and soot emissions were reduced by 65% and 29%, respectively. After-treatment requirements, which are generally associated with cost and fuel economy penalties, can be minimised. Combustion efficiency of 98% was achieved at the expense of higher NOx emissions. In the study [29], experiments and simulations were used to explore the cyclic variability of an ethanol/diesel dual-fuel engine. The experiments were conducted on a light-duty diesel engine fueled with port injection of ethanol and direct injection of diesel. The effects of engine load, ethanol content and diesel injection timing on the cyclic variability were evaluated. In-cylinder pressure traces of 150 consecutive cycles were acquired at each test condition. Consequently, cyclic variations of ignition timing, combustion phasing, accumulated heat release and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) were used to quantify the cyclic variability. The experimental results showed that the fluctuations of ignition timing and combustion phasing were very small throughout the premixed ratio sweep for both the light and high loads. However, the cyclic variation of IMEP increased with the increasing ethanol ratio at both load conditions. Furthermore, cyclic variation of IMEP was reduced at the high load. The variations of IMEP and accumulated heat release showed similar trends for the test conditions, indicating that the cyclic variation of IMEP was mainly caused by the variation of accumulated heat release. Wei et al. [30] conducted an experiment on a diesel/methanol dual fuel engine to investigate the effects of single injection and pilot injection strategies on combustion characteristics, regulated and unregulated gaseous emission (included CO, THC, NOx, CO2, nitrous oxide, formaldehyde, unburned methanol, 1.3-butadiene, formic acid, benzene and toluene) characteristics at low load condition with four different methanol substitution ratios. Experimental results revealed that the application of pilot injection could improve combustion stability and fuel economy at high methanol substitution ratio, and it can also reduce regulated emissions of CO, THC except NOx. Nour et al. [31] investigated the dual fuel diesel engine operation as an important technique used for combustion control in diesel engines. In this study, ethanol was injected into the exhaust manifold of a single cylinder diesel engine. The exhaust valve opens during the intake stroke, enabling vaporized ethanol to enter the cylinder where it is ignited by diesel fuel injection. The effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratios, ethanol injection timing, and ethanol amount were studied. These results reveal that ethanol injection into the exhaust manifold increases the apparent heat release rate at the premixed combustion phase. Additionally, the ignition delay increases with ethanol injection by 0.2 deg crank angle. The indicated mean effective pressure and total heat released per cycle are increased by 8.2% and 14.2%, while the NOx and soot concentrations are reduced by 88% and 30%, respectively. Yu et al. [32] investigated the characteristics of combustion and emissions for various combinations of liquid fuels under dual-fuel diesel engine (i.e. diesel + ethanol, diesel + gasoline, and butanol + ethanol). The effects of fuel properties on ignition control were examined along with the optimization of combustion control strategies. Chen et al. [33] used methanol fumigation strategy in a multi-cylinder diesel engine. Experimental work was conducted in a turbocharged inline 4-cylinder diesel engine fuelled with diesel methanol dual fuel (DMDF). In DMDF engine, methanol fuel is injected into air inlet to form a premixed mixture with air, while diesel fuel is directly injected into the cylinder. The premixed methanol and air mixture enters into each cylinder through a long pipe of air inlet, and then ignited by diesel fuel. There were investigated different kinds of methanol injecting positions: first was in inlet manifold, second in distal end of inlet duct and third near end of inlet duct respectively. Authors stated that the unrepeatability degree of engine is better when methanol injector is placed at intake manifold and at distal end of inlet duct and the consistency of methanol that entered into each cylinder in the form of gaseous phase is better than that of not fully vaporized. The results indicate that the unevenness degree of each cylinder reduces as injection timing of diesel retarded. The cylinder-to-cylinder variation has a tendency to increase with an increase in methanol substitution percent. With the increasing engine load, the COVIMEP of 4 cylinders reduces. In addition, the COVIMEP rises with an increasing methanol substitution percent under 50% and 75% engine loads, while it has no significant change under 100% engine load. The paper [34] is an example of a numerical study of performance and NOx emissions in a diesel-methanol dual-fuel engine. The effect of methanol addition on performance and NOx emissions of a diesel engine was investigated using one-dimensional engine cycle simulation. The methanol component was injected into the intake manifold of a diesel engine at a certain energy fraction (0, 5, 10, or 15%) of the fuel. The in-cylinder pressure and temperature decreased as the methanol content increased due to the lower cetane number and lower heating value of methanol. The resulting decrease in the combustion efficiency lowered the NOx emission and brake thermal efficiency of the engine, and consequently deteriorated the brake specific fuel consumption. Fayyazbakhsh and Pirouzfar [35] presented a review that evaluated the modification of diesel fuel formulation and development of a new model to enhance engine performance, improve fuel properties and reduce exhaust emissions. Emissions arising from the fuel can be controlled by blending an oxygenated fuel (renewable fuel) with the diesel fuel. The blends of oxygenated fuels (methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol) were examined. This review also showed that the engine speed and load has a negative effect on all air pollutants. Increasing of the engine speed leads to reduction of air pollutants. However, engine load increases most exhaust emissions. It is necessary that the explorations of the use of alternative fuels in combustion engines, including alcohols used in diesel engines should be continued [36]. This mainly results from limited resources of fossil fuels and the increasingly high standards for vehicle exhaust purity. It is important that alternative fuels should be technically acceptable, economically competitive, environmentally friendly and accessible. This study presents experimental examinations of a stationary single-cylinder compression ignition dual-fuel engine based on co-combustion of diesel fuel with alcohols. The study evaluated the effect of addition of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol to diesel fuel on the combustion process, performance and emissions from a research engine. Percentage of the energy supplied in alcohol fuel was 15, 30, 45, 55 and 70% of total energy supplied with fuel to the engine. The results of the examinations were compared to the examinations for the engine fuelled with pure diesel fuel as a reference."
1,Experimental setup and procedure,
2,Research engine and apparatus,"2.1 Research engine and apparatus The examinations presented in this study were conducted on the Andoria 1CA90 single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine. This engine is a stationary two-valve unit with vertical arrangement of cylinders and air cooling system with axial fan. The engine is designed to be operated at constant maximum load and constant rotational speed of 1500 rpm. The main component of the fuel supply system is a one-section fuel pump and mechanical injector that allows for the direct injection of diesel fuel to cylinder. Previous studies have found that the optimal angle of diesel fuel injection is 17 deg aTDC [37]. This angle was obtained through adequate positioning of the pump shaft. The aim of the examinations in each of these studies was similar. Additional fuel supply system with light fuel injection to the intake manifold was added to the research engine to ensure co-combustion of two fuels. The injector was fed through the pneumatic cylinder that ensured constant overpressure of 3 bars. The injector was controlled by the external control system which allowed for synchronization of the injector and engine operation and determination of the time of its opening. This allowed for proper and even dosing of the alcohol during the suction stroke. In the beginning of the examination, the fuel supply system was calibrated in order to evaluate the amount of alcohol supplied by the injector for various opening time settings. Table 1 presents the most basic technical data for this engine. The design of the research stand equipped in the experimental dual-fuel engine is presented in Fig. 1 . The main components of the stand are research engine and the system for indication of the internal combustion engine. Indication involved the measurements and digital recording and analysis of fast-changing pressures in the engine combustion chamber. Furthermore, consumption of the fuels supplied to the cylinder into the intake manifold was measured. The engine indication system included piezoelectric pressure sensor, charge amplifier, crank angle sensor and the module for data acquisition with an A/D converter. The stand was also equipped in exhaust analysers that allowed for recording and analysis of changes in the content of individual components in engine exhaust (Table 2 and 3 ). The study used the following measurement apparatus: - data acquisition module, Measurement Computing USB-1608HS – 16 bits resolution, sampling frequency 20 kHz, - piezo-ceramic pressure transducer, Kistler 6061 SN 298131, sensitivity: ±0.5%, - charge amplifier, Kistler 5011, linearity of FS <±0,05%, - crank angle encoder, resolution 360 pulses/rev, - signal analysis oscilloscope Tektronix MSO2014, - air/fuel Ratio Meter LM-2 with lambda sensor, range 7.35–22.38,"
3,Experimental conditions,"2.2 Experimental conditions The dual-fuel compression engine fuelled with diesel fuel and alcohol was performed at full load and constant rotational speed of 1500 rpm. The measurement stand allowed for e.g. recording of the variable in-cylinder pressure in the research engine every 1 deg CA for three measurements of 200 engine operating cycles. Measurement of other values was repeated three times before the analysis of the results of engine indication, such as rotational speed, air consumption, diesel fuel consumption, alcohol fuel consumption, air temperature, exhaust gas temperature and ambient pressure and temperature. The exhaust gas analysers recorded concentration of components in engine exhaust gas, such as NOx, THC, CO and CO2. Changes in excess air ratio were also recorded each time for the air-fuel mixture. All the below profiles which present the results of the analysis of the research engine operation contain points which represent mean value of the three measurements performed on the test stand. Indication of the engine fuelled only with diesel fuel as a reference fuel was performed before the main part of the experiment. The main part of the experiment concerned combustion of the diesel fuel with addition of the alcohol fuel with its energy contribution of 15, 30, 45, 55 and 70%. The most popular alcohol fuels were chosen: methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol. Thermal stability was maintained in each measurement point by controlling exhaust gas temperature and exhaust gas composition."
4,Fuels characteristic,"2.3 Fuels characteristic Diesel fuel and technical alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol) were used in the study. The diesel fuel (C14H30) was commercial fuel sold by the Polish ORLEN Refinery and used commonly to feed diesel engines in cars. The fuel is a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons obtained through fuel diesel distillation. In the case of the diesel fuel, the most important parameter is cetane number that denotes compression autoignition capabilities of the fuel [38]. Polish standards define the minimal cetane number for diesel fuels that guarantees proper engine operation at the level of ca. 51. Alcohols are numbered among organic oxygen compounds with physical and chemical properties that ensure their use as engine fuels for internal combustion (Table 4 ). The most popular alcohols used to feed combustion engines, both as the main fuel and as an addition to the conventional fuel are methanol and ethanol. Both alcohols are characterized by high oxygen content, which has an effect on the combustion process. Methanol (CH3OH) is the simplest alcohol as its molecule contains only one carbon atom. Methanol is characterized by highest mass fraction of oxygen in structure compared to other alcohol fuels and higher oxygen to carbon ratio and oxygen to hydrogen ratio. Methanol can be derived from fossil fuels and biomass (by syn-gas process). High octane number, which points to good resistance to engine knocking combustion, causes that methanol is a good fuel for spark ignition engines. However, with low cetane number and difficulties with self-ignition, methanol cannot be used as an independent fuel in compression ignition engine. The main drawback of methanol as an engine fuel is inferior heating value (20.1 MJ/kg), substantially lower than for the diesel fuel or gasoline and reducing engine performance. LHV of methanol is equal to merely 47% of that of diesel fuel or gasoline. A characteristic feature of methanol is high heat of vaporization (1160 kJ/kg), which leads to a substantial cooling of the charge in the intake manifold, thus reducing the cylinder filling coefficient and consequently improving overall engine performance. On the other hand, in diesel engines, this leads to the ignition delay, increased rate of pressure rise, thus intensifying “hard” engine operation. Ethanol (C2H5OH) is an alcohol with two carbon atoms in its molecule. This fuel is obtained through processing of biological matter. Therefore, it can be considered a renewable energy source [39]. Ethanol can be produced using two methods: from petroleum materials (crude oil, natural gas or coal) using the chemical processes or from plant-based materials through alcohol fermentation of sugars such as glucose contained in biomass. Similar to methanol, this alcohol is numbered among strongly oxygenated alcohols and is characterized by an inferior heating value compared to conventional fuels (26.9 MJ/kg). LHV of pure ethyl alcohol is equal to merely 60% of that of diesel fuel or gasoline. High heat of vaporization (840 kJ/kg) improves filling coefficient and efficiency and delays self-ignition while magnifying the “hard” operation of the compression ignition engine. Ethanol is characterized by high octane number that limits the unfavourable phenomenon of engine knocking and low cetane number that makes it difficult to self-ignition. Ethanol, similar to other alcohol fuels, can be used in dual fuel compression ignition engines. Propyl alcohol (2-propanol) (C3H7OH) is an organic chemical compound from the group of alcohols with three carbon atoms in the molecule. It is obtained by e.g. catalytic oxidation of propane, which is the raw material for many organic synthesis processes. 2-propanol is characterized by higher cetane number and lower self-ignition temperature compared to lower order alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. This, however, is insufficient to use it as the main fuel in compression ignition engines. Relatively high heating value of 2-propanol makes it energy-efficient engine fuel. Despite high octane rating, this fuel is not used in gasoline engines (contrary to ethanol, methanol or 1-butanol) but mostly as a solvent. Butyl alcohol (C4H9OH), also called 1-butanol, is one of alcohols with four carbon atoms in its molecule. Butyl alcohol can be used to replace a conventional gasoline for internal combustion engines. Since its properties are much similar to chemical properties of gasoline, it can be used as a replacement fuel without redesign of the engine. 1-butanol is characterized by substantially higher cetane number compared to methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. However, it is twice lower than diesel fuel. Similar to other analysed alcohols, 1-butanol cannot be the only fuel to feed compression ignition engines. Lower heat of vaporization of 1-butanol compared to other alcohols is not conducive to higher self-ignition delay, thus not causing the “hard” engine operation. Since several years, 1-butanol has been derived mostly from fossil fuels. It can also be obtained through fermentation from plant biomass (usually straw) but also from any other plant waste that contains carbohydrates. The above properties of alcohol fuels show that they can be successfully used in spark ignition engines, whereas in compression ignition engines, they have to be mixed with diesel fuel. Using good self-ignition properties of diesel fuel, the air-fuel mixture with a substantial percentage of alcohol can be effectively ignited. The acceptable percentage of alcohol for co-combustion with diesel fuel depends on many factors, such as type of alcohol, type of engine and conditions of its operation and load, and the system of supplying and co-combustion of both fuels. The study presents the results of experimental examinations of a dual-fuel engine used for co-combustion of diesel fuel with four alcohols, with the alcohol accounting for up to 70%. Properties of all the fuels used in the study are described in Table 4. Fig. 2 presents the composition of the fuels analysed in the study i.e. diesel fuel and four alcohols. Hydrogen content in all the fuels is comparable. The main difference between them results from oxygen and carbon content. With its molecular structure, diesel fuel does not contain oxygen, whereas the most oxygenated alcohol (methanol) contains 50% of oxygen. Of all fuels, diesel fuel is characterized by the highest heating value. 1-butanol is characterized by the highest energy per mass ratio. The study evaluated the processes of co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol, diesel fuel with ethanol, diesel fuel with 2-propanol and diesel fuel with 1-butanol. Diesel fuel was used as a reference fuel, whereas alcohol was the addition with the above mentioned percentages. The following symbols were used during the analysis: for pure diesel fuel: D100, co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol: DM15, DM30, DM45, DM55, DM70, diesel fuel with ethanol: DE15, DE30, DE45, DE55, DE70, diesel fuel with 2-propanol: DP15, DP30, DP45, DP55, DP70 and diesel fuel with 1-butanol: DB15, DB30, DB45, DB55, DB70. The numbers in the symbols concern the percentage of alcohol energy in total fuel energy (alcohol and diesel fuel) supplied to the engine. At full load of the research engine, the level of the energy dose supplied to the engine during a single cycle was around 1100 J and was near the same for all the analysed percentages of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol. In order to ensure constant energy dosing, the test stand was equipped in a system for precision control of alcohol injector in the intake manifold. Fig. 3 shows the levels of energy doses supplied per one cycle of engine operation, in both diesel fuel and alcohol fuel, for DM (Fig. 3a), DE (Fig. 3b), DP (Fig. 3c) and DB (Fig. 3d). Although the amount of energy in the fuel supplied to the engine is at the constant level, fuel mass changes significantly. This results from different heating values of the fuels. In general, with lower LHV of alcohol fuels compared to diesel fuel, total fuel mass has to be increased with the increase in alcohol content in order to maintain constant energy dosing. Since methyl alcohol has the lowest LHV value of all the analysed fuels, its amount supplied to the engine has to be the highest. Fig. 3 also shows the increase in the fuel mass with the increase in alcohol content for DM (Fig. 3a), DE (Fig. 3b), DP (Fig. 3c) and DB (Fig. 3d). The case of 70% of alcohol energy used for co-combustion with diesel fuel shows that, in order to ensure the adopted energy dose of 1100 J/cycle, around 8 mg of diesel fuel and 39 mg of methanol, 30 mg of ethanol, 27 mg of 2-propanol or 23 mg of 1-butanol need to be supplied to the engine. Fig. 4 presents changes is carbon, hydrogen and oxygen supplied to the engine in the fuel dose per engine operation cycle depending on the percentage of alcohol fuel during co-combustion with diesel fuel. On the one hand, the substantial increase in fuel mass supplied to engine with the increase in alcohol in DM mixture (Fig. 3a) led to the increase in carbon, hydrogen and oxygen mass. On the other hand, in the DB case, with fuel mass almost unchanged (Fig. 3d), a decline in carbon mass was observed while hydrogen and oxygen mass increased. As substantially oxygenated fuels, alcohols increase oxygen content in the mixture with diesel fuel, thus affecting stoichiometric demand for air and contributing to changes in individual phases of the combustion process. The highest oxygen content for diesel fuel is supplied with methanol as its amount in this simplest alcohol accounts for 50%. Analysis of these results shows that in the case of co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol, oxygen mass was reduced to 10.5 mg/cycle for DM70 as the alcohol content rose. This value was 8 mg/cycle for DE, 7 mg/cycle for DP and 6.2 mg/cycle for DB. High content of oxygen supplied with fuel to the combustion chamber has a positive effect on the combustion process since this oxygen is characterized by higher activity compared to the molecular oxygen contained in air. It is conducive to intensification of combustion and significantly reduces emissions of toxic engine exhaust, including reduction in exhaust gas smokiness. Changes in mass content of oxygen in the mixtures analysed in the study are presented in Fig. 5 . The increase in the content of alcohol used for co-combustion with diesel fuel was accompanied by the increase in oxygen content in the air-fuel mixture. The highest oxygen content was found for co-combustion of DM, whereas its lowest values were observed for DB. In the case of co-combustion with 70% of alcohol compared to co-combustion with 15% of alcohol, oxygen content increased by ca. 15%. For example, for DM, the increase was from 7.14% for DM15 to 22.15% for DM70."
5,Operating parameters and error analysis,"Examination of the processes that occur in the cylinder of the combustion engine, including combustion process, are mainly based on the engine indication process. It consists mainly on the measurement, recording and analysis of fast-changing instantaneous changes in the engines' cylinder. Information obtained from indication provides the basis for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of thermal, chemical and flow phenomena that occur in engines, and diagnosis and optimization of the combustion process. Knowledge of changes in the pressure in cylinder is useful for determination of changes in several critical parameters of engine operation, such as temperature, heat release rate or total released heat, which in practice are virtually impossible to be measured. Cylinder pressure profiles also allow for determination of the main functional parameters of the engine, such as indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and indicated thermal efficiency (ITE). Information obtained from indication are used to diagnose and optimize engine operation. In practice, experimental measurement of physical properties is typically connected with a measurement error and measurement uncertainty. Engine indication is a typical measurement which depends to different degree on measurement accuracy and uncertainty of the obtained measurement. Therefore, evaluation of the characteristic values for the engine based on the indicator diagram must be connected with the analysis of measurement errors."
6,Indicated mean effective pressure – IMEP,"3.1 Indicated mean effective pressure – IMEP The indicated pressure is evaluated based on the recorded changes in the cylinder pressure and represents one of the indices that characterize operation of combustion engines in terms of the opportunities to ensure high and expected functional performance. Indicated mean effective pressure for a single engine cycle: (1) IMEP i = 1 V d ∫ 0 720 pdV where p is in-cylinder pressure, V is cylinder volume, Vd is displaced cylinder volume. Indicated mean effective pressure: (2) IMEP = ∑ i = 1 i = 200 IMEP i 200 where i is number of engine cycles. Heat release rate profiles in the cylinder of the engine can be also derived from the developed indicator diagram through calculation of changes in internal energy and indicated work of the medium. Heat release rate: (3) HRR = 1 κ - 1 κ p dV d φ + V dp d φ where κ is the ratio of specific heats, V is cylinder volume and p is in-cylinder pressure. The character of compression-ignition engine operation is substantially affected by the pressure rise rate. Pressure rise rate dp/dφ was determined from: (4) dp d φ = p i - p i - 1 φ i - φ i - 1 where p is in cylinder pressure and φ is crank angle."
7,Measurement error of IMEP,"3.2 Measurement error of IMEP The error of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and rate of heat release (HRR) is affected by the error of in-cylinder pressure measurement and the error of measurement of instantaneous displacement. The IMEP error can be determined from the equation [41]: (5) δ IMEP = δ p 2 + δ V 2 where δ p is measuring error of the in-cylinder pressure, δ V is measurement error of instantaneous cylinder displacement. The error of in-cylinder pressure measurement consists of the error of piezoelectric pressure transducer, amplifier error and the error of data acquisition from the A/D module: (6) δ p = δ p t 2 + δ a 2 + δ ( A / D ) 2 where δ pt is the error of piezoelectric pressure transducer, [42], δ a is the error of amplifier, [43], δ ( A / D ) is the error of A/D data acquisition [44]. The measurement error of the instantaneous cylinder volume is affected by the error of crank angle encoder and data acquisition measurement error: (7) δ V = δ k 2 + δ ( A / D ) 2 where δ k is the error of CA crank angle encoder [45], δ ( A / D ) is the error of A/D data acquisition."
8,The uncertainty designation of IMEP,"3.3 The uncertainty designation of IMEP The uncertainty designation of the indicated mean effective pressure is the dispersion (spread) of the average values of calculation results of the IMEP in the individual cycles of the three measurements containing 200 recorded engine cycles. It was assumed that the uncertainty designation of the IMEP has a normal distribution and it is calculated from the equation [41]: (8) Δ IMEP = t s · STD IMEP where t s is coefficient of the t-Student distribution for n−1 degrees of freedom and for the most commonly adopted technique in the 95% confidence level, STDIMEP is standard deviation of the IMEP."
9,Indicated thermal efficiency – ITE,"3.4 Indicated thermal efficiency – ITE One of very important parameters in evaluation of energy transitions in a piston engine is indicated thermal efficiency (ITE), expressed in%. Thermal efficiency reflects engine thermal characteristics and is defined as a ratio of indicated work to amount of energy (heat) supplied to the engine during one cycle. The average value of the indicated thermal efficiency of the research engine: (9) ITE = IMEP · V d Q e 100 % where IMEP is the indicated mean effective pressure, Vd is the displaced cylinder volume and Qe is the total heat in the fuel supplied to the engine. (10) ITE = IMEP · V d Q cyl + Q in 100 % where Qcyl is the heat in the fuel supplied to the cylinder and Qin is the heat in the fuel supplied to the intake manifold."
10,Measurement error of ITE,"3.5 Measurement error of ITE Indicated efficiency is the ratio of indicated work performed in an engine operating cycle to the heat supplied to the engine in this cycle. During the experiment, measurement of heat supplied in a single cycle was impossible since the amount of heat in the fuel was measured in ca. 1 min (750 cycles). Indicated efficiency was defined as a ratio of mean indicated work during the measurement of fuel consumption to mean heat. Indicated work is the product of indicated pressure (IMEP) and cylinder displacement. Therefore, the measurement error for the indicated mean efficiency represents the sum of the measurement error of indicated mean pressure and the measurement error of total heat supplied to the engine. (11) δ ITE = δ IME P 2 + δ Q e 2 (12) δ Q e = δ Q cyl 2 + δ Q in 2 where δIMEP is the error of indicated mean effective pressure, δQe is the error of total heat supplied to the engine, δQcyl is the error of heat in the fuel supplied to the cylinder and δQin is the error of heat in the fuel supplied to the intake manifold. The heat in the fuel supplied to the cylinder: (13) Q cyl = V cyl · ρ d · LH V d 0.5 · n · t where Vcyl is the volume of diesel fuel supplied to the engine cylinder, ρd is density of diesel fuel, LHVd is lower heating value, n is engine speed and t is time of consumption for the fuel in engine cylinder. The error of heat in the fuel supplied to the engine cylinder: (14) δ Q cyl = δ V cyl 2 + δ ρ d 2 + δ LH V d 2 + δ n 2 + δ t 2 where δVd is measurement error of volume of fuel delivered to the engine cylinder [22], δρd is estimated error of diesel fuel density [46], δLHV is estimated error of LHVd for diesel fuel, [47,48], δn is measurement error of engine speed in rpm [22], δt is measurement error of consumption time for the fuel supplied to the engine cylinder [22]. The heat in the fuel supplied to the intake manifold: (15) Q in = V ̇ in · ρ a · LH V a 0.5 · n where V in is diesel fuel jet delivered to the intake manifold, ρa is alcohol density, LHVa is lower heating value of alcohol and n is engine speed, rpm. The error of heat in the fuel supplied to the intake manifold: (16) δ Q in = δ V in 2 + δ ρ a 2 + δ LH V a 2 + δ n 2 where δ V in is measurement error of fuel jet delivered to the intake manifold [49], δρa is estimated error of density of alcohol [46], δLHVa is estimated error of LHVa of alcohol [47,48]."
11,The uncertainty of ITE,"3.6 The uncertainty of ITE The value of the uncertainty of determination of indicated efficiency is affected by the uncertainty of determination of indicated pressure, rotational speed, diesel fuel consumption time in the engine cylinder and jet of alcohol volume supplied to the intake manifold. Uncertainty of determination of indicated efficiency was determined based on three measurements of engine speed, time of diesel fuel consumption in the engine cylinder and jet of alcohol volume supplied to the intake manifold and three mean values of indicated pressure. Uncertainty of indicated efficiency was calculated from the formula [41]: (17) Δ ITE = ∂ ITE ∂ IMEP Δ IMEP 2 + ∂ ITE ∂ n Δ n 2 + ∂ ITE ∂ t Δ t 2 + ∂ ITE ∂ V ̇ in Δ V ̇ in 2 where ΔIMEP is uncertainty of indicated mean effective pressure, Δn is uncertainty of engine speed [22], Δt is uncertainty of time of consumption of fuel in the engine cylinder [22], Δ V ̇ in is uncertainty of fuel jet supplied to the intake manifold [49]."
12,Coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure – COVIMEP,"3.7 Coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure – COVIMEP One of the basic criteria for evaluation of the correct operation of combustion engines is non-repeatability of the work cycles. Coefficient of variation of indicated pressure COVIMEP, expressed in percentages and calculated as a ratio of standard deviation of the engine indicated pressure to its mean value from three measurements containing 200 recorded engine operation cycles, was adopted as a measure of non-repeatability. (18) COV IMEP = STD IMEP IMEP 100 % where STDIMEP is the standard deviation of indicated mean effective pressure."
13,The uncertainty of COVIMEP,"3.8 The uncertainty of COVIMEP It was adopted that uncertainty of determination of the coefficient of variation of the indicated pressure COVIMEP shows normal distribution and it was calculated from the following formula [41]: (19) Δ COV IMEP = t s · STD COVIMEP where STD COVIMEP is standard deviation of the coefficient COVIMEP. Standard deviation for the coefficient of variation of the indicated pressure (STDCOVIMEP) is composed of the uncertainty of determination of standard deviation of the indicated work (STDIMEP) and uncertainty of determination of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). Standard deviation of COVIMEP (STDCOVIMEP) was calculated using the formula for variance of the function of two variables [50]: (20) STD COVIMEP 2 = ∂ COV IMEP ∂ STD IMEP 2 STD STDIMEP 2 + ∂ COV IMEP ∂ IMEP 2 STD IMEP 2 where STD STDIMEP is standard deviation of IMEP, STD IMEP is standard deviation of average value of IMEP."
14,Results and discussion,"The first part of the study concerned indication and measurements of the 1CA90 compression ignition engine fuelled with diesel fuel used as a reference. The second part concerns the examinations of the engine fuelled by diesel fuel and selected alcohol fuels: methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol. Alcohol was injected to the intake manifold during the suction stroke whereas diesel fuel was injected directly to the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke. The effect of alcohol energy percentage in the combustion mixture with diesel fuel was evaluated. The percentage of energy supplied with alcohol fuel in total fuel energy supplied to the engine was 0, 15, 30, 45, 55 and 70%. Indication helped determine pressure profiles in the engine cylinder versus changes in crank angle that characterize the phenomena occurring in the engine, with particular focus on air-fuel mixture combustion in the cylinder. The results of the analysis of the indicator diagram can be used to determine many characteristic parameters of the combustion process (heat release rate, ignition delay, burn duration, indicated mean effective pressure and indicated thermal efficiency) and are likely to contribute to the evaluation of the research engine operation."
15,In-cylinder parameters and engine performance,"4.1 In-cylinder parameters and engine performance 4.1.1 Cylinder pressure history and heat release rate Fig. 6 presents profiles for pressure and heat release rate for engine cylinder with respect to changes in crank angle for the analysed percentages of methanol (Fig. 6a), ethanol (Fig. 6b), 2-propanol (Fig. 6c) and 1-butanol (Fig. 6d) for co-combustion with diesel fuel. Only a part of engine operation cycle (from 340 to 400 deg) was chosen to improve readability of the profiles. The profiles show that in any case, the increase in the amount of alcohol injected into the intake manifold and, consequently, the increase in alcohol during co-combustion with diesel fuel, leads to the delay in self-ignition of the air-fuel mixture. This is caused by the previously discussed properties of alcohol fuels, including high latent heat of vaporization and high self-ignition temperature. The cetane number of the injected diesel fuel is the same, but the temperature of the air and alcohol mixture are different due to the latent heat of the different alcohol type and ratio, so this has important influence of the ignition delay. Furthermore, for all the analysed cases, the increase in the amount of alcohol leads to the decline in pressure during the compression stroke, caused by high latent heat of vaporization of alcohol fuels. The heat of vaporization reduces the temperature of the charge in the cylinder and leads to the decline in compression pressure. Table 4 shows that each of the analysed alcohol is characterized by several-time higher heat of vaporization compared to diesel fuel. This value is 5 times higher for methanol and 2.5 higher for 1-butanol. Adding and increasing the percentage of each alcohol also lead to the increase in maximal combustion pressure (pmax) and heat release rate (HRR). Heat release rate is calculated from the indicator diagram for the engine and determines the amount of fuel used per each crankshaft degree during combustion. In diesel engines, the increase in the ignition delay leads to the increase in premixed combustion phase and at the same time reduces the diffusion combustion phase. The highest pmax and HRR values were obtained during co-combustion of diesel fuels with 55% of alcohol fuel. Fig. 6 shows that the type of alcohol did not have a significant effect on maximal pressure in the cylinder and heat release rate. This is likely to be caused by similar amount of energy supplied with fuel to the engine for the same percentage of each alcohol (Fig. 3). Fig. 6 also demonstrates that the highest delay at which pmax and HRR were obtained occurred for combustion of diesel fuel with methanol. Furthermore, the example of the delay in maximal pressure (pmax) was presented for the selected 55% for each alcohol. For DM55, this value was 26 deg and was higher compared to DB55 (23 deg) by 3 deg. This was caused by the dominant effect of the higher heat of vaporization of methanol compared to other alcohols that delayed the ignition of the air-fuel mixture. In the case of co-combustion of the diesel fuel with the highest alcohol percentage (70%), maximal pressure and heat release rate were unfavourably reduced. The highest decline was found for DB whereas the smallest - for DM. The best combustion process profile, observed for co-combustion with methanol, was connected with the highest oxygen content in the molecule of this alcohol. Additional oxygen supplied in the fuel has a positive effect on the combustion process, is conducive to the increase in the speed of fuel oxidation reaction at the second diffusive stage of the combustion process while reducing total combustion time. A decrease in pressure and heat release rate in cylinder, characteristic for improper combustion, was observed for diesel fuel co-combustion with 70% of 1-butanol. One of basic parameters that describe compression engine operation is combustion pressure increase rate – dp/dφ. Average pressure increase in combustion engine cylinders should occur at the rate ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 MPa/deg. This ensures proper and silent engine operation. If the rate of pressure increase is higher (ca. 1 MPa/deg), engine operation can be called “hard”, with the engine being noisy and the characteristic knocking heard outside the engine [51]. Higher values of maximal pressures and increased rate of pressure rise have a negative effect on the engine as they lead to increased load to the crankshaft and piston system. With ignition delay observed in diesel engines, the combustion process is accompanied by a rapid increase in the heat release rate and rapid pressure rise. In dual-fuel engines fuelled with diesel fuel and alcohol fuel, the delay in self-ignition is also observed, leading to the increase in the rate of pressure rise (Fig. 7 ). In the case of addition of ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol, the threshold permissible for compression ignition engines of dp/dφ = 1 MPa/deg (see Fig. 7b–d) was observed only for 55%. With methanol used as an addition, the threshold was exceeded for DM30, DM45 and DM55 (Fig. 7a). Higher values of pressure rise observed for the operation of the engine fed with DM are mainly caused by the intensifying and faster combustion process due to the presence of active oxygen supplied with methanol. When air-fuel mixtures with 70% of alcohol were burned, a decline in dp/dφ was found for each case, caused by a decrease in combustion speed and heat release rate in engine cylinder. 4.1.2 Ignition delay and burn duration The energy conversion during a combustion cycle can be described by the mass fraction burned (MFB) at a specific crank angle. MFB in each engine cycle is a normalized quantity with a scale of 0 to 1, describing the process of chemical energy release as a function of crank angle [52]. Similar to HRR, MFB is determined in an indirect manner, based on in-cylinder pressure profiles. Fig. 8 presents mass fraction burned versus crank angle for the research engine operating in the dual-fuel system. The MFB changes can be used to determine the time of two characteristic phases of the combustion process in the diesel engine i.e. ignition delay (ID) and burn duration (BD). Ignition delay is a period expressed by the degrees of crank angle from the instant of the beginning of fuel injection and the instant of the first ignition spots. According to the classic ignition theory by Semenov [53], self-ignition is characterized by the initial period when the key role is played by chemical reactions before ignition. The chemical delay is starts from the beginning of these reactions. The physical phenomena which lead to ignition delay in compression ignition engines include decomposition of fuel into separate drops, heating and vaporization of drops and, finally diffusion of fuel vapour into the air. Speed of burning of the liquid fuel is determined by the speed of its vaporization and mixing of the sprayed fuels with air [11]. The dynamics of these physical and chemical phenomena which occur at the beginning of the ignition depends on temperature. Shorter ignition delay in compression ignition engines improves engine performance (lower fuel consumption), makes it easier to adjust the engine (better control of the injection advance angle) and start up the engine, reduces the rate of pressure rise in the process of combustion in the cylinder, thus limiting the noise and load to the crankshaft and piston pin. According to [54], ignition delay (ID) can be defined as the time from the beginning of the fuel injection to the instant when 10% of MFB is reached during the combustion process. Burn duration (BD) is the period from 10 to 90% of MFB. Fig. 8 shows the differences in ignition delay (0.1MFB) and burn duration (0.9MFB) between diesel fuel (reference fuel) and diesel fuel during co-combustion with alcohols. The values of ignition delay and burn duration were also presented for co-combustion of fuels with 55% of alcohol, showing the differences between the alcohols analysed in the study. ID and BD values expressed in crank angle degrees, which characterize the process of co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol (Fig. 9 a), diesel fuel with ethanol (Fig. 9b), diesel fuel with 2-propanol (Fig. 9c) and diesel fuel with 1-butanol (Fig. 9d) were presented in Fig. 9. As a typical fuel for compression ignition engines, diesel fuel is characterized by insignificant ignition delay (ID = 15 deg) and relatively long burn duration (BD = 66 deg). The increase in the alcohol used for co-combustion with diesel fuel leads to the rise in ignition delay caused by high heat of vaporization of alcohol (cooling effect) and self-ignition temperature (see Table 4). Of the analysed alcohols, the highest heat of vaporization and ignition temperature can be found for methanol. Co-combustion of diesel fuel with this alcohol resulted in the highest ignition delay (ID) values, ranging from 19 deg for DM15 to 24 deg for DM70 (Fig. 9a). The lowest ID was found for butyl alcohol, ranging from 16 deg for DB15 to 22 deg for DB70 (see Fig. 9d). Addition and increased amount of alcohol during co-combustion with diesel fuel also had an effect on burn duration. Compared to the reference fuel, BD values were substantially shortened. The shortest burn duration values were obtained for air-fuel mixtures with addition of methanol. They ranged from 55 deg for DB15 to 36 deg for DB70. In the case of other alcohol fuels, BD values ranged from 38 deg for 15% of alcohol to 63 deg for 70% of alcohol. Burn duration was less affected by heat of vaporization, whereas stronger effect was observed for oxygen amount in the alcohol molecule. High oxygen content in the case of methanol/diesel fuel is conducive to the increase in the speed of fuel oxidation reaction at the second diffusive stage of the combustion process while reducing total burn duration. 4.1.3 Indicated mean effective pressure and indicated thermal efficiency Indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) is one of the most popular comparative indices that characterize engine capabilities to perform useful work. Apart from mean piston velocity in the cylinder and indicated power, IMEP represents an important factor in engine performance [51]. Based on engine indication performed in the study, the values of indicated mean effective pressure were determined for the dual-fuel engine used for co-combustion of diesel fuel with addition of selected alcohols. Fig. 10 a illustrates the effect of alcohol on indicated mean effective pressure for the engine fuelled with DM, DE, DP and DB. It is noticeable that the increase in percentage of alcohol used for co-combustion with diesel fuel to 55% leads to the increase in indicated pressure caused by the increase in ignition delay, shift of combustion process after TDC and the increase in the positive work field in the indicator diagram. Mean increase in IMEP was 22%, from 0.68 MPa to 0.83 MPa. For 70% of alcohol content, the decline in the indicated pressure was 0.73 MPa on average, caused by the decline in combustion pressure in the engine cylinder and reduction in the rate of heat release (Fig. 6). Fig. 10a also shows the effect of the type of alcohol on the value of indicated mean effective pressure. The best alcohol was methanol, with the highest IMEP values obtained over the entire range of energy percentages. The highest IMEP was obtained for DM55 (0.86 MPa). This fact was caused by the highest pressure and the highest speed of co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol. Fig. 10a also shows the value of the measurement error and uncertainty intervals for IMEP determination. The error of measurement of indicated mean effective pressure (δIMEP) was ±3.2%, whereas the uncertainty of determination of IMEP (showed in the figure as uncertainty ranges), connected with non-repeatability of consecutive engine work cycles ranged on average from ±0.92%, for 55% of alcohol to ±2.33% in the case of using pure diesel fuel. Indicated thermal efficiency is an important value used for evaluation of energy transitions that occur in internal combustion engines. The effect of alcohol on indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) of the engine for co-combustion of diesel fuel with the analysed alcohols was presented in Fig. 10b. The figure shows that the alcohol fuel injected into the intake manifold forms an air-fuel mixture in the engine cylinder which has a positive effect on combustion through improved thermal efficiency of the cycle. Mean increase in efficiency was observed for increasing the alcohol content to 55%. After exceeding this percentage, ITE was reducing. For 55% of alcohol compared to the reference fuel, mean indicated thermal efficiency increased by nearly 13%, from 30.75% to 34.65%. The increase in efficiency of the engine fuelled by alcohols results from the increase in combustion speed and high IMEP values. In the case of using alcohols, characterized by high heat of vaporization through reduction in the temperature of air-fuel mixture, filling coefficient was increased while loss of pumping of the charge to cylinder was reduced. Among the alcohols analysed, the most beneficial was methanol due to the high thermal efficiency. The highest ITE value for DM55 was 35.3%. Compared to other alcohols, addition of methanol led to the increase in combustion speed due to supply of higher content of chemically active oxygen to the cylinder. Furthermore, additional oxidant caused the increase in temperature of the medium in reaction zones in the beginning of the combustion process, simultaneously increasing the number of ignition spots for diesel fuel. Furthermore, the positive effect of methanol vaporization and its faster combustion leads to the substantial reduction in heat loss from the combustion chamber. Error of ITE measurement (δITE) was ±4.1%, whereas uncertainty of determination of ITE changed from ±1.7% in the case of pure diesel fuel to ±1.9% for co-combustion of diesel fuel with alcohols. 4.1.4 Coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure Stability and smooth operation of the combustion engine can be evaluated based on the non-repeatability of individual cycles of operation, which is typically represented by the coefficient of variation of the indicated mean effective pressure (COVIMEP). According to the study [51], stable operation of the combustion engine is observed when COVIMEP does not exceed 10%. Fig. 11 a presents the effect of addition of the alcohol fuel on the value of coefficient of variation of indicated mean effective pressure obtained during operation of dual-fuel engine. 55% contribution of each of the analysed alcohols during co-combustion with diesel fuel had a positive effect on stability of the research engine operation. Compared to the use of pure diesel fuel, COVIMEP was reduced by 52%, from 2.6% to 1.25%. For 70% of alcohol, an insignificant increase in the coefficient of variation of indicated mean effective pressure was observed, reflecting the insignificant deterioration in engine operation stability and resulting from poorer air-fuel mixture with substantial oxygen amount in the alcohol fuel. For the research engine fuelled with both pure diesel fuel and with the diesel fuel with addition of methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol, COVIMEP values were below 3%, demonstrating proper and stable engine operation. These values are substantially lower than the permissible limit for combustion engines (10%). Uncertainty of determination of COVIMEP ranged from ±6.4% to ±6.8%. The COVIMEP coefficient reflects the dispersion of individual values of the indicated pressure with respect to the mean value determined for selected number of engine operation cycles. Fig. 11b shows dispersion of IMEPi for DM55 and the corresponding pressure profiles in the cylinder for 200 dual-fuel engine operation cycle."
16,Emission characteristic,"4.2 Emission characteristic The test stand designed for the study allowed for the measurement of the content of components of the engine exhaust gas. Contents of toxic compounds of the exhaust were measured: nitrogen oxides NOx, hydrocarbons THC, carbon oxide CO, and CO2 emissions. Emissions from a combustion engine depend mainly on combustion process temperature and composition of air-fuel mixture. Fig. 12 shows changes in excess air ratio (λ) and maximal combustion temperature in the cylinder (Tmax) versus energy percentage for the alcohol fuel for co-combustion with diesel fuel for four analysed alcohols. The increase in alcohol content with substantial oxygen content led to leaner air-fuel mixture and higher excess air ratio. Methyl alcohol, with the highest oxygen content, led to obtaining the leanest mixture, for whom the value λ ranged from 1.15 for DM15 to 1.48 for DM70. The richest air-fuel mixture corresponded to butyl alcohol. In this case, λ ranged from 1.05 for DB15 to 1.3 for DB70 (Fig. 12a). Additional oxygen was supplied in the alcohol fuel for alcohol percentages from 15 to 55% caused the increase in maximal combustion temperature (Fig. 12b). The highest temperatures were found for co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol. After exceeding 55%, the temperature declined due to the substantially leaner air-fuel mixture. 4.2.1 NOx emission The main types of nitrogen oxides emitted by the internal combustion engine include nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The NOx formation rate has a strong relationship with temperature. The high NOx formation rate in the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine is due to high temperature in the combustion chamber during premixed combustion phase and in the post flame region. The formation of NO occurs most intensively in burn gases which represents the main source of emission. This thermal mechanism of NO formation is described by highly temperature-dependent chemical reactions known as the extended Zeldovich mechanism. The second mechanism relevant to NO formation is prompt which is relevant in pre-flame reactions and during diffusion combustion phase. The dominant is thermal mechanism [55,56]. Combustion processes lead primarily to the formation of NO, whereas NO2 is formatted from NO according to reaction with HOO radicals and subsequently NO2 is converted to NO by reaction with O. The NO2 formed in the flame in quenched by mixing with cooler fluids additionally flame in quenched by cooled wall. These oxides are denoted as NOx, i.e. mixture of NO and NO2. Generation of nitrogen oxide in the internal combustion engine results directly from reactions between nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) that occur in favorable conditions in the engine cylinder during combustion. The emission of NOx is the highest while the mixtures are leaner and characterized by the excess air ratio ranging from 1.05 to 1.1. Combustion of such mixtures is accompanied by the excess of free oxygen and high temperature. When leaner or richer mixtures are burnt, NOx emissions are lower than maximal. Content of nitrogen oxides depends on pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber, connected mainly with engine load. In diesel engines, combustion usually occurs under conditions of excess air, which is conducive to nitrogen oxide generation. Fig. 13 a presents NOx emissions from the research engine for co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol. The addition and increase in the amount of each alcohol in the blend of up to 55% leads to the increase in nitrogen oxide emissions. Compared to the engine fuelled with the reference fuel, mean increase in emissions was 139% (from 475 ppm to 1135 ppm). The increase in NOx content in exhaust gas results from the previously discussed increase in rate of fuel combustion and heat release rate (Fig. 6) and higher maximal combustion temperature (Fig. 12b) in the dual-fuel engine with addition of the alcohol fuel. For 70% of alcohol, NOx emissions declined to 831 ppm on average. Of all the analysed alcohol fuels, the highest emissions were found for co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol, which, with its highest content of active oxygen, intensified combustion while increase the rate and temperature of the process. 4.2.2 THC emission One of the causes of increased emissions of hydrocarbons in exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine can be incomplete combustion process. Hydrocarbons are generated due to incomplete or partial combustion of fuel, which is transported in the form of vapour with the exhaust gas. With oxygen deficiency and low temperature, part of fuel is not oxidised during the combustion process. The THC emission of the diesel engine is affected by the heterogeneous nature of combustion where simultaneously occurs fuel evaporation, air-fuel and burned-unburned gas mixing and combustion process. Due to this process complexity it contribute to diesel engine THC emission. The THC emission could be increased by the too lean air-fuel mixture which could not be able to flame propagation or too reach mixture to ignition. Unburned fuel can be consumed by slower thermal oxidation process during the expansion stroke after mixing with air [51,57]. Emission of THC of compression ignition engines depends on operating conditions. Engines operated with low loads are characterized by higher THC emission than for full load conditions. Increased THC emissions also affect the crevice effect, in combustion chamber are volumes which are escaping combustion. Fig. 13b presents emissions of hydrocarbons from the research engine for co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol. It is noticeable that addition of the alcohol fuel to diesel fuel of up to 55% does not lead to significant changes in emissions of THC from the dual-fuel engine. In this range, mean hydrocarbon content remained at a constant level between 151 and 163 ppm. Chapter 2.3 of this study showed that in order to ensure a constant energy dose per engine operation cycle, the increase in alcohol fuel content was accompanied by the increase in total fuel mass (diesel fuel and alcohol) supplied to the cylinder. Increased fuel mass used for combustion should lead to increased hydrocarbon emissions. However, this does not occur since the alcohol supplied to the combustion chamber adds more oxygen and increases maximal combustion temperature, which contribute to faster HC oxidation. The increase in THC content of up to 331 ppm occurred after exceeding 55% of alcohol. In this range, air-fuel mixture was leaner and the maximal combustion temperatures declined. 4.2.3 CO emission Carbon oxide (CO) is a colourless and odourless gas that is generated in the engine cylinder mainly due to incomplete burning of fuel. It is mainly generated during combustion of the mixtures which contain insufficient amount of oxygen needed for optimal combustion of the charge (λ < 1). Lack of homogeneous and uniform air-fuel mixture is conducive to the formation of carbon oxide also during combustion of stoichiometric mixtures (λ = 1). Non-homogeneity of the mixture can result from insufficient spraying and vaporization of fuel, insufficient mixing of air with fuel (inadequate swirling motion of the charge) and relatively low temperature of the diffusion stage of combustion. Another cause of CO formation is CO2 dissociation reactions that occur due to high temperature present in the flame front. Fig. 14 a presents emissions of CO from the research engine for co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol. Excess oxygen and high temperature in the cylinder that accompanies co-combustion for the alcohol content from 15 to 55% led to the decline in CO content in dual-fuel engine exhaust gas. For co-combustion with 55% of alcohol compared to the reference fuel, mean decline in CO content was 45%, from 2.72% to 1.49%. With 70% of alcohol, further reduction in CO emissions is noticeable. This is likely to be caused by deterioration of combustion process and a decline in maximal combustion temperature due to a substantially leaner air-fuel mixture. The highest carbon dioxide emissions was found for the use of methyl alcohol. For DM, the highest increase was observed for fuel mass supplied to the engine (see Fig. 3a) and, consequently, carbon mass, since carbon, through oxidation, caused an increase in CO content. 4.2.4 CO2 emission Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colourless and odourless gas which is generated in the process of hydrocarbon fuel combustion process and respiratory processes of living organisms. Unlike other basic components of engine exhaust, this gas is not toxic. However, the increase in carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is claimed to contribute to the greenhouse effect. The major sources of CO2 emissions include combustion of fossil fuels in the industry, households and transport, and clearance of tropical rainforests. Contribution of transport to emissions of carbon dioxide is evaluated at 10 to 15% [58]. In the case of combustion engines, CO2 emissions depend directly on the amount of fuel consumed. Fig. 14b shows that the increase in alcohol percentage of up to 55% led to the increase in CO2 emissions caused by leaner air-fuel mixture and increased maximal combustion temperature. Insignificant oxygen excess and high temperature was conducive to CO oxidation to CO2. Mean increase in CO2 content was 17%, from 10.1% to 11.79%. After exceeding the level of 55% of alcohol, a decline in carbon dioxide emissions was observed due to the deterioration of the combustion process. The highest content of CO2 in engine exhaust gas was found for co-combustion of fuels with addition of methanol since it occurred with the highest excess of air and highest maximal combustion temperatures."
17,Conclusions,"The use of alcohols for fuelling of compression ignition engines is one of the methods to eliminate conventional petroleum-based fuels and to increase contribution of energy derived from biofuels in transport and energy sectors based on the use combustion engines. Dual-fuel engines seem to be the solution that allows for effective combustion of alcohol fuels in the compression-ignition engine. The study presents the experimental examinations of the CI engine with dual-fuel system based on the use of diesel fuel injected directly to the cylinder and four most popular alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and 1-butanol) injected to the intake manifold. Energy of each alcohol used for co-combustion with diesel fuel was 0 ÷ 70%. Analysis of the results obtained in the study leads to the following conclusions: - Addition of alcohol to diesel fuel had a positive effect on the level of indicated mean effective pressure, the indicated thermal efficiency and the stability of the test engine. Increase in energy percentage of each alcohol to 55% during co-combustion with diesel fuel led to the mean increase in indicated mean effective pressure by 22%, mean increase of indicated thermal efficiency by almost 13% and reduction in coefficient of variation COVIMEP by 52%. After exceeding 55% of alcohol, an insignificant decline in IMEP and ITE and an insignificant increase in COVIMEP were observed. - Of the alcohols analysed in the study, methanol was the most beneficial in terms of high indicated pressure and high efficiency, with maximal values of IMEP = 0.86 MPa and ITE = 35.3% at DM55. - In dual-fuel engines fuelled with diesel fuel and alcohol fuel, an increase in the rate of pressure rise was found, reflecting the “hard” engine operation. For each of the analysed alcohols, in the case of the most advantageous (from the standpoint of engine performance) alcohol content of 55%, the permissible boundary value for compression ignition engines of dp/dφ = 1 MPa/deg was found. - Addition and increase in percentage of each alcohol to 55% during co-combustion with diesel fuel led to the increase in emissions of nitrogen oxides (by 139% on average), decline of carbon oxide emissions (by 45%) and increase in carbon dioxide emissions (by 17% on average). However, it did not lead to significant changes in emissions of hydrocarbons. The highest contents of NOx, CO and CO2 in engine exhaust were found for co-combustion of diesel fuel with methanol. - The experiments performed in this study demonstrated that the main drawback of the use of alcohol fuels to fuel compression engine is the increase in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Limitation of this emission can be achieved through better control over the processes of creation and combustion of air-fuel mixture in the engine cylinder. In addition to the precise alcohol fuel injection system, the research engine should also be equipped in a modern common-rail system that allows for control of the injection characteristics, injection pressure and rate of combustion in the engine cylinder."
