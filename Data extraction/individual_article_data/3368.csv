0,Introduction,"Hydrogen can be applied in fuel cells, and is also regarded as an important alternative energy carrier in the future [1,2]. Hydrogen can be obtained from various raw materials, such as traditional resources of coal and natural gas, and renewable resources of bio-alcohols and bio-oil through steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) [3–5]. Among the aforementioned routes, the hydrogen production from bio-oil via fast pyrolysis of biomass is regarded as one of the energy-saving technologies, as compared with the process from bio-alcohols via fermentation and distillation, and is a carbon-neutral route as well. Acetic acid is the main compound of bio-oil, and has been selected to investigate the reaction mechanism for hydrogen production from SR of bio-oil over various catalysts [6–9]. Among these catalysts, nickel-based catalysts, e.g. Ni/Al2O3, showed high activity in SR of AC, but it presents significant carbon deposition through thermal decomposition and ketonization reactions in the reforming process. To address the concern of coke deposition, cobalt was introduced in the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst to relief the formation of carbon on the catalyst surface [10], while the high acidity of Al2O3 still played important role in coke formation, as reported by Salehi et al. [11]. MgO, as an additive, was also introduced in Ni/Al2O3, and improved the catalytic performance in terms of both hydrogen yield and carbon conversion [11]. The periclase MgO from hydrotalcite-like precursor as a support had been investigated in our previous work in ATR of bio-ethanol [12,13], and showed high activity and stability for hydrogen production. Taking these factors into account, Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ catalysts with Ni–Co and without acidic Al2O3 support were prepared, and the MgO skeleton, which acts as a support with high thermal stability and low acidity, was also prepared via hydrotalcite-like precursors. SR of AC for hydrogen production was tested over these catalysts, and the mechanism was discussed as well."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation The Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ bimetallic catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation. Aqueous solutions of nitrate salts of nickel, cobalt, and magnesium (Chengdu Kelong, AR) were prepared at a set ratio, and then were co-precipitated dropwisely with the solution of Na2CO3 and NaOH at CO3 2−/OH− = 1/16 and (total of metal cation electron charge)/(OH−) = 1/8 at pH 10.5 ± 0.5. The resulting suspension was aged for 24 h at 75 °C, filtered and washed three times with deionized water, dried at 105 °C overnight, and then calcined at 650 °C for 4 h in air. The obtained Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ catalysts were listed in Table 1 . Another Ni0.2Co0.8/MgO catalyst was prepared by impregnation of MgO with Ni(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)3, and listed as N20C80-IMP in Table 1. The MgO support was prepared by precipitation of Mg(NO3)2 and Na2CO3, and calcined at 650 °C for 4 h. After calcination, the MgO support was impregnated with the aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)3, and then calcined at 650 °C."
3,Catalytic performance test,"2.2 Catalytic performance test The test on catalytic performance was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. In each experiment, 300 mg of catalyst was charged into a quartz tube reactor and reduced with H2 (30 ml/min) at 650 °C for 1 h. The feed of H2O/AC = 4/1 (molar) was vaporized at 330 °C with internal standard gas of N2 (30 ml/min) and introduced continuously into the reactor by a liquid pump. The tail gases were analyzed on-line using a gas chromatography (GC-7890, Lunan Ruihong, China) with a TCD detector and a Porapaq-Q column. AC conversion, selectivity to carbon products, and hydrogen yield were calculated according to the following equations. X AC = F AC in − F AC out F AC in S i carbon - containing product = F i carbon - containing product n i ( F AC in − F AC out ) Y H 2 = F H 2 product F AC in In the above equations, F i, in or out is the molar flow rate of the i species at the inlet or at the outlet of the reactor, and n i , the stoichiometric factor of the i species, is the molar ratio of carbon in acetic acid to carbon in the carbon-containing product."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out with a DX-2700 X-ray diffractometer (Haoyuan Instrument, China) for Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. Specific surface areas of the oxides were measured by nitrogen physisorption at −196 °C on an automatic adsorption instrument (NOVA 1000e, Quanta Chrome). Thermo gravimetric (TG) experiment was conducted in a TG analyzer (HCT-3, Hengjiu, China). The morphology of the catalyst was analyzed using a JEOL JEM 2010 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operated at 120.0 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded by a Kratos Axis-Ultra DLD spectrometer using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energies were calibrated relative to the C1s peak from the carbon contamination at 284.6 eV."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Steam reforming of acetic acid,"3.1 Steam reforming of acetic acid 3.1.1 Reaction routes of SR For steam reforming (SR) of AC, the first step is the activation of AC over catalysts, in which AC can be transformed via four main routes [14]: SR, decomposition, ketonization, and dehydration. The SR route is endothermic and produces high yield of H2 and CO2 (CH3COOH + 2H2O → 2CO2 + 4H2 + 151.2 kJ/mol). A relative low yield of H2 (2.0 mol-H2/mol-AC) can be also obtained from AC decomposition with products of CO, CH4, C2H4, and coke. There are two other routes: the ketonization route to acetone and the dehydration route to ketene. Acetone can form coke through polymerization, and ketene may produce ethylene by coupling reaction, while ethylene is a precursor of coke. As reported by Takanabe et al. [7,11], coke is one of the main reasons for deactivation of SR. It can be found that among these routes, the SR route favors to a high hydrogen production with less coke deposition. 3.1.2 Catalytic performance test To investigate the catalytic performance, these Ni/Co catalysts were tested in a 20-h SR test at 3.8 g-AC/g-catalyst/h, or 8600 h−1 of GHSV. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (A), over the Co-based catalyst of C100, the AC conversion was near 100% with a H2 yield near 2.8 mol-H2/mol-AC in the beginning. However, the AC conversion and H2 yield dropped rapidly overtime. In the meantime, the selectivity to CO2 and CO started at 59.9% and 30.0%, respectively, and then decreased to 56.5% and 14.9%, respectively. In contrast, the selectivity to acetone increased quickly from 7.9% in the beginning to 33.4% at 12 h. The CH4 selectivity remained at a low level of about 1.9%. The catalyst bed was blocked after 16 h, which was caused by coke deposition. For catalysts with nickel, better performance was observed over N20C80 in Fig. 1(B): not only AC was completely converted, but also the H2 yield reached 3.1 mol-H2/mol-AC and remained stable in the 20-h test. In the product gases, acetone disappeared, indicating that AC ketonization route was restrained. Meanwhile, the methane selectivity remained at a relatively low level near 3.0%, suggesting that AC decomposition was restrained as well, or the produced methane may have been transformed via SR route as well. The high H2 yield can be attributed to the high selectivity to CO2 and CO, which increased to 68.6% and 28.4%, respectively, as compared with that of nickel-free sample C100. These results indicated that the SR route dominated the reactions over N20C80, while routes of AC decomposition, ketonization, and dehydration were restrained. With higher nickel content in N50C50, as shown in Fig. 1(C), a decrease of activity was observed, and the conversion of AC dropped gradually to 64.5% in the end. Meanwhile, the H2 yield decreased from 2.6 to 0.8 mol-H2/mol-AC. This decrease in H2 yield can be attributed to the high selectivity to acetone via AC ketonization route. Over the cobalt-free nickel-based catalyst, N100 (Fig. 1(D)), a high selectivity to acetone was also observed in the beginning, and increased further overtime. As a result, the hydrogen yield decreased overtime. In view of the stability test, the N20C80 bimetallic catalyst showed a high activity and stability in SR of AC, which can be attributed to the higher activity for SR, and restraining of AC ketonization and decomposition, as compared with that of monometallic catalysts and N50C50 with high nickel content. 3.1.3 Effect of preparation method For comparison, to study the effect of preparation method, a N20C80-IMP catalyst was prepared by impregnation and tested in SR. As shown in Fig. 1(E), compared with N20C80, all AC was also consumed over N20C80-IMP and the H2 yield reached 3.1 mol-H2/mol-AC, but then decreased overtime. The decrease of H2 yield can be attributed to the increase of acetone via the ketonization route, which further leads to coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. During the 20-h test, the conversion of AC dropped to 77.5% and the H2 yield dropped to 2.1 mol-H2/mol-AC in the end. The difference of activity between the N20C80 and the N20C80-IMP can be attributed to the difference in structural and/or electronic properties, and will be further checked later."
7,Characterizations,"3.2 Characterizations To investigate the relationship between structure and reactivity, these Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ catalysts were screened by XRD. Fig. 2 (A) shows the structures of precursors of the Ni–Co catalysts before calcination. For the monometallic catalysts of C100 and N100, these strong peaks at 17.9°, 37.4°, 50.4°, and 58.2° can be assigned to a brucite structure (Mg(OH)2, PDF #: 44-1482). With both nickel and cobalt in N50C50, the brucite still remained as the main phase, while a hydrotalcite-like structure emerged [15]. In the N20C80, the brucite phase almost disappeared and the hydrotalcite-like structure became the main phase. The Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ oxides after calcination at 650 °C were also scanned by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2(B), all of the brucite and hydrotalcite-like structures disappeared after calcination, and transformed into similar cubic phases, e.g., periclase of MgO (PDF #: 74-1255), NiO (PDF #: 65-2901), and CoO (PDF #: 70-2855), and probably formed a mixed oxide or solid solution of cubic phase of Mg(Ni, Co)O [16]. The mean particle size of these Mg(Ni, Co)O species was calculated by the peak near 43.1°, as shown in Table 1. The N100 has a relatively smaller particle size of 15.6 nm, compared with 31.8 nm in the C100. The particle sizes of bimetallic oxides vary between those of N100 and C100. Nitrogen physisorption was used to estimate the surface area (SA) of Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ oxides. As shown in Table 1, C100 has an SA of 22.3 m2/g, which is lower than that of N100 (49.7 m2/g). With the partial replacement of Co by Ni in N20C80, the SA reached 38.6 m2/g. In order to study the structures of catalysts before reaction, the catalysts were reduced at 650 °C and scanned by XRD, as shown in Fig. 2(C). For all of the reduced samples, there is no obvious difference between the oxides and reduced samples, and there were no obvious peaks of Ni0-containing and Co0-containing species, indicating that the possible species of Ni0 and Co0 may be in amorphous state or formed micro grain which was below the detection limit of XRD. The species of Ni0 and Co0 will be checked in the following XPS method. XPS was then used to check the electronic properties of the Ni and Co species. As shown in Fig. 3 (A) of the Ni2p3/2 spectra of the reduced N50C50 sample, the characteristic peaks at 852.2 eV and 855.5 eV are corresponded to Ni0 and Ni2+ [17], respectively, while the satellite peak near 862.0 eV is the shake-up peak of the Ni2+ [17]. The Co2p3/2 XPS spectra were also recorded, as shown in Fig. 3(B). The strong peak near 780.7 eV can be attributed to the Co2+ species, with a peak at 786.5 eV for the shake-up peak of Co2+ [16]. The peak near 777.4 eV can be categorized as the Co0 species [18]. The XPS results confirm the existence of Ni0 and Co0 species in reduced catalysts, which cannot be found by XRD in Fig. 2(C), and also indicate that only part of Ni or Co species can be reduced to Ni0 or Co0 at 650 °C. Meanwhile, the quantitative results of XPS, as shown in Table 2 , indicate that there is no significant difference in the ratios of Ni0/(Ni0 + Ni2+) and Co0/(Co0 + Co2+) in catalysts of C100, N20C80 and N50C50 after reduction. To find the variation during the SR test, the spent catalysts were screened by XPS as well. As shown in Table 2, the percentage of Co0 in C100 decreased from 12.2% to about 5.3%. For the spent N50C50, the percentage of Co0 decreased from 15.8% to 4.9%, and the percentage of Ni0 decreased as well. The Ni and Co spectra of spent N50C50 were also provided in Fig. 3(C) and (D), and the decrease of Ni0 and Co0 can be found with the weakened peaks near 852.2 eV and 777.4 eV, respectively. The decrease of Ni0 or Co0 in C100, N50C50, and N100 may explain the decrease of activity in SR of AC. For the reduced N20C80 sample, the ratios of Ni0 and Co0 reached 22.3% and 15.3%, respectively. After the SR test, the Ni0/(Ni0 + Ni2+) ratio decreased slightly, while the Co0/(Co0 + Co2+) ratio remains stable. This stability in species of Ni0 and Co0 may explain the stability in SR of AC of N20C80. The reduced N20C80-IMP by impregnation was also scanned by XPS, and the ratios of Ni0 and Co0 reached 38.0% and 16.1%, but decreased obviously to 13.2% and 5.5% after the 20-h SR test. This result suggests that the N20C80-IMP catalyst prepared by impregnation is more reducible, but is less stable in SR test, as compared with the N20C80 prepared by co-precipitation. In order to investigate the surface coverage on these bimetallic catalysts, the (Ni + Co)/Mg atomic ratios over the surface of catalysts were analyzed from the peak areas after subtraction of the background, according to Cimino reported in Ref. [19]. Over the reduced catalysts, the (Ni + Co)/Mg atomic ratios increased in the following sequence: N20C80-IMP (2.6%) < C100 (3.4%) < N50C50 (4.0%) < N20C80 (4.8%). Over the spent catalysts after stability test, the (Ni + Co)/Mg atomic ratios decreased to 2.4% in N2080-IMP, 2.3% in C100, and 2.8% in N50C50. For the spent N20C80, the (Ni + Co)/Mg atomic ratio remained stable near 4.5%. This result suggests that there are more Ni and Co species remained over the N20C80 surface, which may have resulted in the higher H2 yield and stability, as indicated by the results of SR test. XRD was also employed to find the crystal variation and coke deposition over these Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ catalysts in the SR process. As shown in Fig. 2(D) of XRD patterns, there is no obvious difference between the reduced and spent samples, indicating that these catalysts with MgO skeleton has a thermal stability; Meanwhile, obvious peak of carbon in graphite was observed at 26.5° in N100. To target the possible carbon formed and deposited during SR, the spent catalysts were screened by a thermo gravimetric analyzer. As shown in Fig. 4 (A), the loss of mass varied in the following sequence: N50C50 (2.9%) < N20C80 (7.1%) < C100 (8.5%) < N100 (21.8%). The differential thermogravimetry (DTG) profiles can be used to identify the deposited carbon. As shown in Fig. 4(B), two well-separated exothermic peaks were observed, suggesting that there are two types of carbon over spent catalysts. The first one at 220–360 °C and the second one at 500–670 °C can be attributed to the combustion of amorphous carbon and crystalline carbon of graphite, respectively [20]. A strong peak near 605 °C was found over N100, and is consistent with the strong graphite peak in XRD. For the spent N20C80, the exothermic peaks shifted to low temperatures, and the peak at 280 °C was intensified. These results suggested that over the spent N20C80, the deposited carbon may exist in amorphous state which cannot be found by XRD, and can be gasified during SR test [20]. The morphology can be evaluated by TEM. As shown in Fig. 5 (left), trace of the deposited carbon was found, and is consistent with the TG results. Fig. 5 (right) shows the metal particle size distribution of spent bimetallic catalysts, which was estimated by measuring the size of at least 100 particles from original TEM images with a scale of 5 nm. The mean particle size for spent C100, N20C80, and N100 was 34.1, 27.2, and 22.4 nm, respectively, which was in line with the XRD results, as shown in Table 1. Based on results of characterizations, one can find that the hydrotalcite-like structure can be formed via co-precipitation over the Ni–Co bimetallic catalysts. After calcination, a mixed oxide or solid solution of cubic phase Mg(Ni, Co)O was formed over the Ni x Co1−x Mg6O7±δ (x = 0–1) catalysts. The poor activity and stability over the monometallic catalysts of C100 and N100 can be attributed to the oxidation of active metals, as well as carbon deposition, as shown by XPS, TEM, TG, and XRD. With both Ni and Co in N20C80, a relatively high SA and a low mean particle size were obtained. More importantly, the N20C80 remained stable in both structure and electronic properties. As a result, over N20C80 with both Ni and Co, by-products via routes of AC decomposition, ketonization, and dehydration were restrained, and a high H2 yield near 3.1 mol-H2/mol-AC was obtained and remained stable in a 20-h SR test. For the N20C80-IMP catalyst prepared by impregnation, although there were more Ni0 species over the surface of reduced catalyst, oxidation of these Ni0 species was recorded by XPS and the resulting deactivation was found during the SR test."
8,Conclusions,"The Ni–Co bimetallic MgO-based catalysts were tested in SR of AC for hydrogen production. The Ni0.2Co0.8Mg6O7±δ catalyst showed high activity and good stability: not only the conversion of AC was near 100%, but also the H2 yield maintained stable near 3.1 mol-H2/mol-AC. The selectivity to CO2 and CO reached 68.6% and 28.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, by-products via routes of AC decomposition, ketonization, and dehydration were restrained. The characterization results showed that this high catalytic performance over Ni0.2Co0.8Mg6O7±δ can be attributed to 1) resistance to oxidation of active metals, 2) resistance to coking, and 3) stability of structures and electronic properties in the SR test."
