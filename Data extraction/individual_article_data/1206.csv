0,Introduction,"Carbonyl compounds such as ketones and aldehydes are essential functional groups for chemical production in the laboratory and industry that are frequently prepared by oxidation of their corresponding alcohols or hydrocarbons [1]. Oxidation of alcohols is traditionally carried out utilizing stoichiometric quantities of inorganic oxidants, which are comparatively expensive, extremely toxic, and environmentally troublesome [2]. Due to the easy removal of gas from the reaction, utilizing gaseous reagents as an oxidant allows the ability to develop greener processes by decreasing the waste from purification [3]. Using oxygen as an oxidant is very common; however, reactions that require pure O2 as an oxidant do not fulfill the standard criteria for an appropriate reaction because of the cost of acquiring, supply, maintaining, and utilizing the pure O2 cylinder is expensive [4,5]. Thus, there is a definite need for catalysts that use air as the stoichiometric oxidant because air is an inexpensive and non-toxic oxidant and produces water as the only by-product [6]. Furthermore, in the past few decades, extensive research has been done to develop more economical, ecological, and greener methods that use natural and biocompatible support in heterogeneous catalyst scaffolds. The tandem oxidation process (TOP) has received a great deal of attention over the last decade due to the low cost, reducing waste production, decreasing energy consumption, minimizing the number of operations, high yields [7]. Also, in this type of reaction, it is often possible to use a volatile and toxic intermediate structure prepared in situ, thus avoiding separation problems [8]. The salient feature of TOP is a considerable increase in molecular complexity emerging from one synthetic step [9]. The TOP includes the reaction among alcohol, oxidant, and nucleophile in a one-pot process, and the intermediate aldehyde is rapidly trapped. TOP is the domino process because the alcohol will not react with the nucleophile, but the alcohol must be changed to the aldehyde, which will react with the nucleophile in the next step [10]. The synthesis of propargylamines is an excellent example of the TOP reaction, which is an essential intermediary for making agrochemicals and drug scaffolds [11]. Propargylamines are traditionally synthesized by nucleophilic attack of Grignard reagents or lithium acetylides on imine derivatives [12]. Multicomponent reaction (MCR) of aldehydes, alkynes, and amines are considered a unique alternative strategy in propargylamines production compared to traditional methods [13]. Although propargylamine has been produced via various methods, almost all of these methods have longer reaction times, inert gas, and costly catalysts such as Au(I)/Au(III) [14], Ag(I) [15], In(III) [16] and Ir-complex [17]. Although enormous research endeavors have been performed to improve TOP, the utilization of this process in MCRs is less investigated [18]; therefore, the development of inexpensive, efficient, and reusable catalyst frameworks can help expand TOP and MCRs. The catalyst frameworks based on metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) are the most common catalytic system because of their easy preparation on a large scale, chemical and thermal stability, inherent non-toxicity, recyclability, and low catalyst loading [19,20]. Hence, the worldwide production of MPcs is about 80,000 tonnes [21]. Post-synthetic modification (PSM) bestows attractive properties to phthalocyanines molecules so that more than seventy kinds of central metals can be implanted in phthalocyanine core, and diverse types of MPcs structures are yielded. Thus, by combining the different metals as an active catalytic site in the phthalocyanine framework, the modified phthalocyanines illustrate particular catalytic influences related to the metals used [22]. The framework resemblance of MPcs to metalloporphyrin in terms of structure and the active catalytic site has led to the use of MPcs as effective biomimetic catalysts in heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions [23]. It is well known that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) possesses catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of organic compounds [24]. Solubility is the disadvantage of the salt complexes of MPcs that extensively impacted their catalytic potential; furthermore, separation of the homogeneous catalysts from the reaction media is challenging. To settle these matters, it has been determined that implantation of the MPcs on the inert and insoluble supports such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) not only extends the effective surface area of the homogeneous MPcs but also streamlines the separation method of the MPcs [19,24]. MOFs are porous materials created from anionic organic linkers and cationic units. As a kind of organic-inorganic hybrid crystalline poriferous material, MOFs have been constructed from positively charged metal ions, and organic linker molecules restricted them. The form node metal ions fasten the linkers' arms to each other and are repeated in the cage-like scaffolds [25,26]. MOFs have received tremendous attention due to their unique applications in chemical and electrochemical energy storage [27], gas [28] and liquid separation [29], and adsorbent for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants [30–32]. These spongious materials’ have a massive surface area. More interestingly, their customizable scaffolds perform a key role in using them as solid supports and heterogeneous catalysts if unsaturated metal centers exist in MOFs compounds. Catalyst consistency and absence of metals leaching are two critical factors in each heterogeneous oxidation catalyst [33,34]. Metal leaching is less seen due to the chemical and thermal stability of MOFs [35]. Due to these points, MOFs’ application as the insoluble and inert supports for the immobilization of catalyst has grown dramatically in recent years. Various strategies were reported in the literature to the immobilization of MPcs on organic and inorganic supports, such as covalent anchoring [36–38], physical adsorption [39,40], electrostatic or ionic interaction [41–43], encapsulation [44,45], and doping process [46,47]. Electrostatic immobilization of MPcs on supports has the specific advantages of including: (i) It is straightforward with shortening in preparation steps, (ii) maximum interaction between MPcs and supports, and (iii) prevention of the aggregation MPcs [41–43]. In continuing our interest in the synthesis of MPc and also improving features of heterogeneous catalytic systems based on MPcs for utilizing in the various reactions [48,49], in this aspect, we report the synthesis of a new catalyst (MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc) which has been originated with CoTSPc that implanted to MIL-101-NH2 via a superior electrostatic interaction reaction. The catalytic activity of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc was investigated in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and one-pot tandem conversion of alcohols to propargylamines via oxidative A3 coupling reactions (Fig. 1 )."
1,Results and Discussion,"In this work, as shown in Fig. 2 , the strategy for preparing MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc includes creating electrostatic interaction between -NH3 + group from MIL-101-NH2 and -SO3 − group on CoTSPc in water as a solvent and producing the ionic bond between MOF and MPc. For clarification of the strategy, a control experiment was accomplished to verify the electrostatic interaction of CoTSPc with MIL-101-NH2 [50]. The same method for preparing MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc was carried out, using MIL-101 instead of MIL-101-NH2 (Detailed information can be seen in the Supporting Information). Then, ICP-OES analysis was performed for the obtained material after centrifugation to measure the amount of cobalt. The results showed 0.04 mmol/gr cobalt loading in the obtained solid, probably because of physical loading. In comparison, ICP-OES analysis for the obtained MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc showed 0.14 mmol/gr cobalt loading in the MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc. The performed control experiment clearly supports the electrostatic interaction between the NH2 and SO3H functionalities. Also, the loading of CoTSPc was calculated 0.14 mmol/gr based on the ICP-OES analysis results. In addition, previously reported showed that the pH of solution plays an important role in the adsorption process and electrostatic interaction [51–55]. The adsorption capacity of CoTSPc with MIL-101-NH2 under acidic conditions was much higher than alkaline conditions. Under acidic conditions, amine groups of MIL-101-NH2 were protonated and produced positively charged sites as MIL-101-NH3 +, which could electrostatically interact with negatively charged anionic Pc-SO3 − and the solution is obvious. On the other hand, under the basic conditions, the protonation process was decreased because of the low H+ concentration, and the solution turned blue, as indicated in Fig. 3. Based on our experimental results and the reported mechanism in the literature [56], an electrostatic interaction mechanism of Pc-SO3 − with MIL-101-NH3 + was proposed, as shown in Fig. 4. The following sections deliberated on the prepared catalyst's characterization and their catalytic activity in the alcohol oxidation reaction and one-pot tandem conversion of alcohols to propargylamines via oxidative A3 coupling reactions. The structure and configuration of the synthesized MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc were characterized by SEM, EDX, FT-IR, TGA, and XRD."
2,FT-IR analysis,"2.1 FT-IR analysis The samples were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy to confirm the successful synthesis of catalysts. The FT-IR spectrum of synthesized CoTSPc and MIL-101-NH2 (Fig. 5 ) were in excellent agreement with the previous report [57,58]. As shown in Fig. 5, the FT-IR spectrum of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc displayed a broad peak centered at 3400 cm−1, characteristic of NH- and -OH groups. In the lower frequency region, the two peaks around 1580 cm−1 correspond to the N–H bending vibration and the C–N stretching vibrations,1380 cm−1, and 1260 cm−1, respectively. Also, peaks at about 1500 cm−1 and 1430 cm−1 were associated with the –O–C–O– stretching vibrations. The FT-IR spectrum of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc displayed several peaks in the region 1200 cm−1, which were assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of the -SO2- group and the weak peak at 1020 cm−1 was assigned to S-O stretching vibration. Finally, the peak at 930 cm−1 can be attributed to the Co implanted bending vibrations in the Pc framework."
3,XRD analysis,"2.2 XRD analysis X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MIL-101-NH2, CoTSPc, and MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc were recorded to investigate the structure of the synthetic catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 the characteristic diffractions of MIL-101-NH2 appeared at 2θ of 3.3°, 5.1°, 8.9°, and 16.6° . In the XRD spectrum of CoTSPc, characteristic diffractions at 2θ = 18.8°, 23.3°, 27.8°, 28.6°, 31.6°, 33.6° and 48.4° were observed. The X-ray pattern of the synthetic MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc demonstrated the presence of both MIL-101-NH2 and CoTSPc in the catalyst without change in the structure of each component during the immobilization (Fig. 6)."
4,TGA analysis,"2.3 TGA analysis The thermal stability of the catalyst, MIL-101-NH2/CoPTSPc, was investigated by carrying out thermal analysis (TGA) under air from room temperature to 600 °C, and results are illustrated in Fig. 7 . The first mass loss (8.15%) in the TGA diagram of MIL-101-NH2/CoPTSPc below 200 °C corresponds to the release of water and probably other condensation reactions. The thermogram of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc and MIL-101-NH2 demonstrated a mass loss of about 67% and 80%, respectively, from 300 °C to 600 °C. Therefore, about 13% difference in remnant weight between the two mass losses in TGA diagrams is ascribed to the simultaneous presence of the cobalt and chromium oxides, which are remained constant above 450 °C. The results also demonstrated that the anchoring of CoTSPc with MIL-101-NH2 caused the final composites' thermal stability to be enhanced."
5,Morphological characteristic,"2.4 Morphological characteristic Fig. 8 shows the SEM images of the MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc at low and high magnification. As can be seen, the structure of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc is almost altered compared to MIL-101-NH2 because of the bulky structure of CoTSPc that is electrostatically implanted on the surface of MIL-101-NH2. As a result, the morphology of the MOF altered to a great extent [59]. Nevertheless, primary morphology has been maintained in some surfaces. The elemental analysis (chemical composition) was also examined by EDS analysis. As expected, Co and Cr in addition to S and N were detected in the catalyst structure, which further confirms the successful immobilization of CoTSPc on MIL-101-NH2."
6,Catalytic activity MIL-101-NH2 /CoTSPc in aerobic oxidation reaction,"2.5 Catalytic activity MIL-101-NH2 /CoTSPc in aerobic oxidation reaction Initially, the catalytic properties of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc was evaluated in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. To optimize the required amount of catalyst, temperature, and time, the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was performed as a model reaction, and the results are showed in Table 1 . Also, the effect of various solvents was examined on the reaction yields, as well. Based on these experiments, p-xylene was found as the preferred solvent (Table 1, Entries 1-5). In the absence of the catalyst under reflux conditions for 8 h in p-xylene as solvent, most of the initial material was retrieved, and the desired product was not obtained (Table 1, Entry 12). Using catalyst increased reaction efficiency, indicating the catalyst successfully performed the oxidation reaction to afford products. This reaction in the presence of 0.12, 0.21, 0.42, and 0.58 mol% of CoTSPc was examined (Table 1, Entries 6-9). The optimal amount of the MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc was 0.42 mol% due to higher yield and shorter reaction time than the other amount of catalyst loading (Table 1, Entry 8). When the reaction was carried out in the presence of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc (0.21 mol%) at 100°C, low progress in the reaction was observed, but, 70% yields were achieved by raising the temperature to reflux within 8 h (Table 1, Entries 5 and 6). The catalytic activity of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc was compared with MIL-101-NH2 and CoTSPc to verify the desired catalyst efficiency (Table 1, Entry 14 and 15). The results revealed that MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc has superior catalytic efficiency than the two individual components in the model reaction. To evaluate the influence of the bases on the model reaction, the reaction experimented in the presence and absence of different bases (Table 1, Entry 10-11 and 13). Due to the results, the optimal and suitable amount of base in the model reaction was 0.50 mmol of KOH. Viewing these results, the model reaction's optimal conditions were appointed 0.42 mol% of the MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc at reflux temperature under air bubbling (300 ml.min−1 flow rate) in p-xylene as a solvent. Also, the catalytic efficiency of physical mixing of MIL-101-NH2 and CoTSPc was investigated, and 75% conversion was obtained (Table 1, Entry 16). The optimized conditions were then used to oxidize various primary and secondary benzylic alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds. It can be seen that all products were obtained in high yields (Table 2 ). As indicated in Table 2, aerobic oxidation of various alcohols such as primary and secondary benzylic alcohols was investigated. According to the reaction times and yields, secondary benzylic alcohols were more active than others in this catalytic system. Primary benzylic alcohols with the electron-withdrawing group were better than primary benzylic alcohols with the electron-donating group. It should be noted that the optimal conditions were also applied for aliphatic alcohols, but the desired results were not obtained. Following the promising results in the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol derivatives, to evaluate the efficiency of the fabricated MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc, the optimized conditions were used to synthesize diverse propargylamines by benzyl alcohols, phenylacetylene, and amine derivatives. In the first step, the oxidation of alcohol generated the corresponding aldehyde as an intermediate. A secondary amine and phenylacetylene were then added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction continued at the same conditions. Benzaldehyde and secondary amine participated in a condensation reaction. Finally, the A3 coupling reaction was accomplished by attacking terminal acetylene anion to iminium ion (Table 3 ). Also, a control experiment was accomplished to investigate the catalytic efficiency of physical mixing of MIL-101-NH2 and CoTSPc and compound 5a was achieved in 48% yield (Table 3, Entry 1) As indicated in Table 3, some benzyl alcohols derivatives such as Cl, H, and Me, various amines, and phenylacetylene were employed, and the corresponding propargylamines were synthesized in good yields. The results showed that deviation from the phenyl substituent to a more electron-rich or electron-poor aromatic aldehyde decreased the yield. Various cyclic secondary amines such as piperidine, morpholine, and pyrrolidine were used to extend the scope of the reaction that piperidine and pyrrolidine showed better results. As shown mechanism in Scheme 1 , the mechanism for the oxidation process includes two steps: (i) the oxygen adsorption in the ROH by Co(II), which improves the hydrogen elimination rate via base. (ii) products were gained via the change in the state of transition complex between Co and ROH by eliminating the benzylic hydrogen connected to the -OH group of the ROH. In the following, the A3 coupling reaction mechanism includes two steps (Scheme 2 ): (i) The acidity of terminal alkane increases with the binding of Co(II) species, which in turn increases its activity. The oxidation state of the catalyst does not change in this step proceeds. (ii) Afterward, the coupling of Co(II) acetylide intermediate and the iminium ion, generated in situ from the aldehyde and secondary amine, leads to desired products. Finally, the Co(II) catalyst is regenerated for subsequent cycles. Also, two control experiments were performed to determine the alkali metal ion role in the A3 coupling reaction. The reactions for the preparation of compound 5a were done using benzaldehyde in the optimized conditions in the presence of KOH or KBr and in the absence of the catalyst, and no product was achieved in these reaction conditions. As a result, the alkali metal ion does not affect the A3 coupling reaction (Table 4 ). The results of this work with respect to solvent, time, temperature, and yield have been compared with reported catalysts (Table 5 ). The comparison of the studies shows that MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc needs not only milder reaction conditions than other reported works, but low-cost, straightforward preparation which reduced the manufacture steps and maximum contact between components, are the specific advantages of the electrostatic immobilization of MPCs on various support for the catalyst synthesis [41–43]. Therefore, MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc can be considered a superior catalyst with a remarkable performance compared to the existing catalysts. The recyclability of the catalyst was surveyed for the synthesis of propargylamines under the optimized conditions for the model reaction (utilizing piperidine, benzyl alcohol, and phenylacetylene). After the reaction time, the MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc was filtered, washed with ethanol, n-hexane, and water, then dried at 100°C and used in the next run. It was observed that the catalyst maintained good activity and could be reused for four-cycle runs without a significant decrease in its catalytic performance (Fig. 9 ). The recovered catalyst was analyzed by XRD to affirm the stability and reusability of MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc during the tandem oxidation process, and results were compared with the XRD pattern of the fresh catalyst. According to the XRD pattern of the MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc, no notable changes were observed in the used MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc. As a result, the structure of the catalyst has not changed during the reaction (Fig. 10 ). The minor differences between the two patterns could be related to changes in the orientation of the powder samples when recording XRD patterns. Finally, to determine whether the MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc was heterogeneous or working as an active soluble source of the CoTSPc, a hot filtration test was performed to synthesize propargylamines under the optimized conditions (utilizing piperidine, benzyl alcohol, and phenylacetylene). Upon ~50% completion of the reaction, the catalyst separated utilizing a filter, and reaction components were transferred to another condenser. Upon further stirring the catalyst‐free solution under the initial conditions, only minuscule progress (~10% by GC analysis) was observed after 12 h affirming the utilized catalyst's heterogeneous nature."
7,Conclusion,"This research aimed to introduce MIL-101-NH2/CoTSPc, which was prepared via dominance electrostatic immobilization CoTSPc on MIL-101-NH2 frameworks as an effective catalyst with features such as reusability, easy preparation, and apt catalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. After gaining the appropriate results in the aerobic oxidation reaction of alcohol derivatives, the behavior of the generated catalyst was investigated in the one-pot tandem oxidation process under the same set of conditions to demonstrate the potential of the introduced catalyst. It can be derived that CoTSPc implanted on the MIL-101-NH2 has better activity than pure CoTSPc because of the distribution of CoTSPc on the surface of MIL-101-NH2 and the expanding concentration of MPc monomeric molecules. The wide pore size and the massive surface area of the MIL-101-NH2 not only guaranteed sufficient contact between the catalytically active center of CoTSPc and the substrate with the reactants in the framework but also improved the evacuation of product molecules from the catalyst surface. The integration strategy of various types of catalytically active metal phthalocyanine in the MOF substrate generates a low-cost, simple, and efficient method for synthesizing heterogeneous catalysts. It is noteworthy that air as an oxidizing reagent in the absence of additional oxidants during the reaction, apt reaction time, high performance, and recyclability of the catalyst without losing its activity are other benefits of the introduced catalyst."
