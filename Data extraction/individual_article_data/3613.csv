0,Introduction,"The potential benefits of a hydrogen economy coming from renewable energy sources are creating a large consensus [1,2]. Hydrogen has to be produced, and hydrogen production from fossil fuels has been investigated for many years. While fossil fuel is not a sustainable energy source, one highly attractive route for hydrogen production is steam reforming of bio-ethanol, obtained from fermentation of biomass [3–13]. In theory, hydrogen production from biomass or biomass derived liquids can be a carbon-emission free process since all carbon dioxide produced can be recycled back to plants using solar energy. Because of its low toxicity and ease of deliverability, ethanol lends itself very well to a distributed-production strategy. Besides, there has arisen a strong interest in using H2-based fuel cells as future source of energy due to the high conversion efficiency of hydrogen energy to electricity as well as no emissions of pollutant gases [11–13]. The wide-spread application of fuel cells becomes closer to reality, so increased attention is focused on hydrogen production technologies. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are under development as energy production devices. The most typical temperature range for optimal operation is 700–1100°C [11,12]. Such a high temperature range allows the use of carbon-monoxide resistant nickel anodes and the use of fuels different from hydrogen at the anode, in the so-called direct internal reforming SOFC. However the high operating temperatures undergo catalytic deactivation due to sintering of nickel crystallites and carbon deposition. Hence, worldwide efforts are in progress to discover novel, more active and more stable catalysts. Performing the reaction at lower temperature than 700°C is a challenging goal. The ideal hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming (SR) only generates CO2 and hydrogen. However, in reality ethanol reaction occurs by a complex mechanism and product compositions are far more complicated due to the co-occurrence of multiple reactions [3,4]. Noble metals have shown to have significant activity at 500–600°C range, but high cost of these metals limits their application. As a less expensive alternative and high feedstock, Ni, Cu or Co based catalysts have also been studied. Nickel catalysts have been widely studied because of low cost and high activity [5–10,13], although this metal favours coke deposition. Deactivation, related to carbonaceous compounds deposition, is considered the principal inconvenience of the catalytic system based on transition metals supported on oxides. It has been reported that, the supported oxides transition metals have the inconvenience to produce carbonaceous compounds due to metal sintering. On the other hand, it is known that metal-support interaction plays an important role during the preparation step and thermal treatments, since both of them can define the properties of final catalysts: reducibility, resistance to thermal sintering of the active sites or metallic dispersion [3,4]. The reducibility, the catalytic activities and coking resistant behaviors of catalysts are affected by their surface and structural properties, so the methodology used in the preparation can lead to the obtainment of materials with important properties for applications in catalytic processes, such as ethanol reforming. Moreover, carbon formation can be minimized using a support with good redox properties, a promoter or enhancing the strong metal-support interaction. Better catalytic performance with good stability and high hydrogen selectivity can be expected over supports with redox properties, such as CeO2 [5–9]. Ceria, a stable fluorite-type oxide, has been studied for various reactions utilizing its particular properties, such for example, its redox properties, which can be further enhanced in the presence of a metal or metal oxide. In the laboratory, CeNi x OY mixed oxides were largely studied because of high interactions existing between Ni and Ce species inside the solid [14–17]. The catalysts were classified in two families, depending on the nickel content: the first family with x ≤0.5 corresponds to a solid solution with the substitution of Ni2+ ions in the CeO2 lattice and the second family with x >0.5 concerns compounds in which crystallized NiO and solid solution coexist. The size of nickel oxide varies considerably from clusters to a crystallized material depending on the x value and the experimental conditions (preparation conditions, calcination temperature, etc…). Furthermore, depth sputtering followed by XPS analysis evidenced on CeNi0.5OY, depending on whether the solid solution is, or is not, taken into account, small particles of NiO estimated between 3.1 and 3.6nm [16] and the difference observed between NiO and CeNi x OY reduction temperature was attributed to the presence of these small particles which are more easily reduced. A series of reactions were proposed accounting for the reduction mechanism that take place in the solid solution. Redox processes between Ce4+, Ce3+, Ni° and Ni2+ were demonstrated. These Ni species present the characteristic of being able to be reduced and reoxidized easily and reversibly allowed by their close interaction with Ce species. Moreover, in the partially reduced state anionic vacancies able to receive hydrogen, in a hydride form, are created at the surface and in the bulk of the solid and a reduction mechanism based on heterolytic dissociation of H2 was proposed (O2− +□+H2 →OH− +H− with □: anionic vacancy). Relation between the ability of the partially reduced solids for storing hydrogen, the nature of the occluded hydrogen species, and the degree of reduction of the cations were discussed [18]. It appears that different kinds of active sites which differ from each other in terms of the environment of Ni species can exist [19]. In the present study, we report on H2 formation activity over these CeNi x OY catalysts for reforming of ethanol. As a matter of fact, in relation with the reduction properties of the catalyst, the ability of the solid to accept hydrogen can be an important parameter for the reaction which requires to dehydrogenate ethanol. The aim of this work was to develop a highly active, selective, stable and cost effective catalyst at relatively low temperature which should avoid carbon formation and also allow an application to fuel cells."
1,Experimental methods,"The mixed oxides denoted CeNi x OY, where x is the Ni/Ce atomic ratio were prepared by coprecipitation of the corresponding hydroxides from mixtures of cerium and nickel nitrates (0.5M) using triethylamine (TEA) as a precipitating agent. After filtration, the solids were dried at 100°C and calcined in air at 500°C for 4h [16,17]. The metal concentration (M T) is the sum of Ce and Ni. The loading was measured by microanalysis (Centre d'analyses CNRS Vernaison). Catalytic performances were conducted at atmospheric pressure with a quartz fixed-bed reactor (inner diameter 10mm) fitted in a programmable oven, in the temperature range of 50–480°C. When noted, the catalyst was previously in-situ treated in H2 at 200°C for 10h in order to form the oxyhydride. The water:ethanol mixture (molar ratio 3:1) is pumped into a heated chamber and vaporized. The water–ethanol gas (N2) stream (total flow: 60mL/min) is then fed to the reactor containing 0.2g of catalyst. The gases at the outlet of the reactor were taken out intermittently with the aid of a sampler directly connected to the system and analyzed on-line by FID and TCD gas chromatography. Reaction data were collected as a function of time and reported after about 5h when the steady state was obtained for each temperature. Appropriate blank runs show that under our experimental test conditions the contribution of the gas phase reaction is negligible. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out with a D 5000 Siemens diffractometer using a copper target and a secondary beam monochromator. The XRD patterns were registered in the 2θ domain (15–80°) with a measured step of 0.02° and the time of integration was fixed to 12s. The Kα 2 contribution was eliminated from the diffraction by computer post-processing, the patterns obtained were not subjected to other treatments. The crystallites size was calculated using the Scherrer equation, from the most intense reflections observed for the NiO and CeO2 crystallographic structures: (111), (200), (220). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was performed on a Micrometrics Autochem 2920 analyser, and hydrogen consumption was measured by a TCD detector: 25mg of the sample was treated in the 5% H2–95% Ar gas mixture (2l/h). The temperature was increased to 800°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. To calibrate the amount of H2 consumption, the AgO powder was used. Measurement of the hydrogen stored in the solid is based on the ability of this class of compounds to hydrogenate 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) in absence of gaseous hydrogen [20]. The pretreatment and catalytic experiments were carried out in-situ at atmospheric pressure. The solid was treated first (10h) in a purified hydrogen flow at various temperatures T T between 50°C and 700°C, then after elimination of molecular hydrogen, hydrogenation reaction was performed in isoprene+helium mixture. The hydrogenation reaction involves the participation of reactive hydrogen species of the solid (noted H*), which can diffuse from the bulk to hydrogenate isoprene at the surface on a hydrogenation site. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the samples were obtained on a VG Escalab 220 XL instrument using Al Kα radiation (hν =1486.6eV). The details of the spectrometer and the experimental procedure are given in reference [16]. The anode was operated at a power of 300W and the fixed retardation ratio (FRR) was applied. The base pressure attained during the analysis was 1.33×10−6 Pa. The calcined samples, lightly pressed on an Au-holder, were applied to a sample rod, this allowed an in-situ calcination treatment at 773K (20% O2 in N2) to be carried out. This step was performed in the preparation chamber of the spectrometer, directly connected to the ultra-high vacuum analysis system. The measurements were performed at room temperature. For calibration of the binding energy (E B) scale of photoemission features, the Ce3d u′″ peak at 916.7eV was taken as an internal reference. In our experimental conditions, the reproducibility of E B was estimated at ±0.2eV. As for atomic ratios, they were calculated by assuming a homogeneous distribution of the catalyst components. The spectrometer allows ions to be bombarded directly onto the surface of compounds. For this, the solids were thinly pressed on an indium-holder and measurements were performed with the same analysis conditions as those previously described. Ions sputtering conditions were carried out with an ionic energy of 2000eV and an applied tension of 580V. The cumulated time of sputtering treatment under argon ions was varied from 1 to 5000s."
2,Results and discussion,
3,XRD,"3.1 XRD Fig. 1 reports the diffraction patterns obtained with different CeNi x OY solids. A ceria like phase is apparent in every solid analyzed (34-0394 JCPDS file) while crystallized NiO (4-0835 JCPDS file) appears when x ≥0.4. As already reported in previous studies for CeNi x OY compounds, a careful examination of the patterns shows that the addition of nickel affects not only the broadness of the ceria peaks, but also their position, attributed to the substitution of Ce4+ cations by Ni2+ cations inside the CeO2 lattice and interpreted by the formation of a cerium–nickel solid solution [17]. As a matter of fact, the nickel ionic radius (Ni2+: 0.07nm), is smaller than the cerium ionic radius (Ce4+: 0.09nm). It was reported that the highest proportion of solid solution is obtained for the CeNi0.5OY compound, as also observed here, when the molar ratio Ni/M T =0.33 (M T =Ni+Ce, Ni/M T = x/(1+ x)). The studied CeNi x OY mixed oxides with x <0.4 correspond to a solid solution with the substitution of Ni2+ ions in the CeO2 lattice, to compounds in which crystallized NiO and solid solution coexist when 0.4≤ x <1, and to a mixture of CeO2 and NiO when x >1. It was reported that the size of nickel oxide particles varies considerably from clusters to a crystallized material depending on the x value and the experimental conditions (preparation conditions, calcination temperature, etc…) [14–18]. In a similar manner as reported previously, the crystallite size was estimated from the XRD line widths taking into account the (111), (200) and (220) peaks, for both NiO and CeO2. The average dimensions obtained for CeNi x OY oxides are summarized in Table 1 . The size of the crystallites of the mixed oxides is found smaller than the size measured for the pure oxides. This phenomenon was already explained by an increase of the crystallographic disorder in the mixed oxides. This technique allows an estimation of the average crystallites size at about 5nm for CeO2-like species and at about 10nm for NiO species. However, it is important to recall that crystallites with a size smaller than 2nm cannot be detected by XRD (because of the limits of detection)."
4,XPS,"3.2 XPS Cerium compounds have XPS spectra with rather complex features due to numerous initial and final 4f electronic configurations. According to Barr et al., [21] the 3d spectrum, registered on pure ceria, can be resolved into three spin-orbits doublets 3d3/2–3d5/2, respectively denoted (u, v), (u″, v″) and (u′″, v′″). As for the CeNi x OY solids already studied by this technique in the laboratory [16], these characteristics are well visualized on the Ce3d spectra, presented in Fig. 2 for CeNi x OY compounds, and one can unambiguously ascribe the 3d envelope to Ce4+ cations in CeO2-like species. O1s lines of the compounds have all binding energies of 529.1±0.1eV, showing without doubt that the oxygen element is characteristic of some typical O2− lattice oxygen species. Moreover, Fig. 2 shows the Ni2p3/2 band shapes of the mixed oxides which were analyzed in a similar manner as reported previously [16]. A careful examination of these band shapes was performed and a line broadening effect is observed when the nickel content increases. As already published in previous works on cerium based compounds, it can be admitted that Ni2+ species mainly form a solid solution with ceria. For high Ni/Ce ratios several types of surface nickel seem to coexist, in agreement with XRD [17]. Therefore, the system can be described as a solid solution of nickel in ceria in close contact with nickel oxide. Ions sputtering in combination with surface analysis techniques such as XPS provide information on the in-depth distribution of elements inside the solid. This technique found many applications in materials that show some composition inhomogeneity in their topmost layers and was previously detailed and applied in our laboratory to characterize the CeNi x OY compounds [16]. The decrease of the superficial composition Ni/Ce versus the sputtering cumulated time is presented in Fig. 3 for CeNi0.2OY and CeNi0.5OY catalysts. Clearly, the distribution of the nickel species is preferably located on the top-surface. It is also interesting to note that all the initial tangents cut off the X-axis at about the same time. Assuming that there exists a relation between the time of ion bombarding and the solid sputtered depth, this evolution is in favor of a homogeneous sputtering process, occurring at the top layers of the binary oxides and can be explained by some common surface based-nickel species. During the first minutes of sputtering, there is a sharp decrease of the Ni/Ce ratio, registered on all the binary oxides, confirming that the structure does not correspond to a homogeneous solid solution, the presence of small crystallites in strong interaction with some bigger aggregates can be in such a case privileged, whatever the nickel content included in the CeNi x OY compounds. In order to estimate the size of the NiO particles on the support, two models were suggested, allowing simplifying the problem in two extreme cases, taking into account or not the presence of a solid solution of nickel in ceria. Despite the fact that these two cases describe a very simple structure of the CeNi x OY catalysts, they allow the calculation of the particles size by default and by excess. The results obtained using these models are summarized in Table 2 , showing an increase of the NiO crystallite size when the solid solution is taken into account. Therefore, as an example, the size of the NiO crystallites is respectively estimated to be 3.4nm and 2.1nm for the CeNi0.5OY compound, when taking into account or not the presence of a solid solution. However, as XRD analyses show the presence of cerium–nickel solid solution for low Ni contents, the first value is more probable. Clearly some small NiO particles (2–3nm), smaller than the ceria particles (5nm), coexist with larger NiO crystallites (10nm) observed by XRD. Despite the presence of a small amount of large NiO crystallites when observed on the CeNi x OY XRD patterns, the binary oxides with x <0.4 are constituted of small NiO crystallites on a ceria support modified by the incorporation of nickel cations. When x ≥0.5, the morphology of the compounds changes, there still exists some small NiO clusters but the solid solution tends to disappear to the benefit of the growth of crystallites of about 10nm. Preferential interactions between cerium and nickel are apparent in CeNi x OY compounds. These interactions are located either inside the fluorite lattice or at the interface between NiO particles and CeO2 (or solid solution) particles."
5,TPR in H2,"3.3 TPR in H2 The Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) profiles in H2 of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . A first temperature reduction peak at 266°C is more intense for a low Ni content, when x =0.2. When x increases from 0.2 up to 0.4 a second peak at about 370°C increases. For higher Ni contents, the first peak decreases while the second peak shifts to higher temperatures (390°C). It was already observed that a shoulder at 440°C is emerging in the shape of the curve obtained for higher Ni contents [22]. The reduction peak obtained at about 400°C increases with the Ni content. For temperatures lower than 600°C, a linear relationship is obtained between the total hydrogen consumed during TPR with the Ni content of the CeNi x OY compounds (Fig. 5 ), showing that H2 is consumed in majority to reduce nickel species in this range of temperatures. It is usually reported that TPR analysis of CeO2 presents two peaks at about 500°C and 820°C, and that the reduction peak obtained at temperature higher than 700°C corresponds to the reduction of bulk Ce4+ to Ce3+ [23]. Moreover, it was also shown that NiO facilitates the reduction of a cerium solid solution [22], therefore it can be proposed that the TPR peaks correspond to the reduction of nickel species in various environments. The low temperature peak can be attributed to nickel species: i) belonging to the solid solution and/or to ii) small NiO particles, easily reducible, but with the simultaneous reoxidation of a part of these species by reduction of the Ce4+ ions in their vicinity into Ce3+ species as the existence of a redox system was established (Eq. (1) and (2)) [17], then larger NiO crystallites are reduced when increasing temperature. (1) Ni2+ +O2− +H2 →NiO +H2O+□ (with □: anionic vacancy) (2) 2 Ce4+ +NiO ↔2 Ce3+ +Ni2+"
6,Hydrogen storage (chemical titration),"3.4 Hydrogen storage (chemical titration) At 150°C, in a helium+isoprene flow, alkadiene hydrogenation occurs on H2 treated compounds at adequate temperature. As a function of time on stream, the hydrogenation activity decreases and by integrating the curve obtained, the reactive hydrogen content (H*) of the solid can be determined [18–20]. For all the solids studied, the hydrogen content is found dependent on the treatment temperature T T in H2 and on the metallic content. For T T ≥150°C, a hydrogen storage up to about 35×10−3 molg−1 is measured for a specific treatment temperature of about 250°C. As shown in Fig. 6 , CeNi1OY presents higher results than CeNi0.5OY. When x =1 an optimum hydrogen storage is obtained, but the results obtained are very close to those obtained with x =0.7. With higher values of x, between 1 and up to 5, no better results were observed. For comparison, NiO prepared in the same conditions was also analyzed in a previous study. As for the binary mixed oxides, optimum hydrogen storage is observed for a treatment temperature of 250°C, but for higher T T the hydrogen content decreases drastically, showing that ceria allows slight increase of the reactive hydrogen storage but mainly brings to the system a better stability in temperature [24]. The insertion in the solid of particular hydrogen species created by heterolytic splitting of H2 on an O2− species and an anionic vacancy of the solid was summarized as follows [18–20]: (3) O2− M n + □+H2 →OH− M n + H− (with □: anionic vacancy, and M n +: cation) Compared to TPR analysis largely higher hydrogen storage is measured by chemical titration. Even if by TPR, a higher H/Ni atomic ratio is obtained than necessary to reduce NiO, in agreement with an insertion of hydrogen species in the solid, the difference obtained is too high to be explained easily. However, it is important to remark that TPR experiments are obtained with a progressive increase of temperature up to 800°C in 5% H2–95% Ar mixture while for chemical hydrogen titration the solid is activated in pure H2 during 10h at T T."
7,Ethanol steam reforming,"3.5 Ethanol steam reforming Ethanol steam reforming (SR) was studied as a function of reaction temperature, activation treatment in H2 and metal loading of CeNi x OY catalysts. Fig. 7 and 8 show, as examples, the results obtained over the fresh and treated in H2 CeNi0.4OY catalyst versus reaction temperature. On the fresh catalyst, without any H2 pretreatment, an ethanol conversion is observed at temperatures higher than 200°C and as expected it increases with temperature (Fig. 7). At 200°C ethanol conversion is lower than 1% and the main product observed is ethylacetate, typical of dehydrogenation reaction, as it is industrially produced by catalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol. Acetaldehyde presents an optimum at 250°C and H2 is observed at 300°C. At 300°C, ethanol conversion is of about 15% over CeNi0.4OY catalyst, and H2 concentration in the outlet gas stream is of about 70%, while ethylacetate, acetaldehyde, acetone and CO2 are found in concentration range between 5 and 10%. For higher temperatures, H2 slightly decreases in the outlet gas stream, while ethylacetate disappears, and acetone appears at 300°C and presents an optimum of 10% at 350°C. CO2 and CH4 appear respectively at 300°C and 350°C and they increase with temperature. CO appears at 350°C and presents an optimum at about 400°C. Moreover, the catalytic results obtained depend on the Ni content of the compounds, but mainly for ethanol conversion. Only the CeNi5OY compound, containing the highest Ni content, leads to a more specific comportment, giving at 300°C an ethanol conversion of about 3% and an outlet gas stream composition comprising mainly H2 at 60%, with 30% of acetaldehyde and 5% of ethylacetate. At 440°C ethanol conversion increases with Ni content and is of 100% when Ni/M T ≥0.4 (CeNi0.7OY) with an outlet gas stream composition constituted of about 48% H2, 20% CO2, 30% CH4 and 2% CO. As shown in Fig. 8, when the solid is previously in-situ treated in H2 at 200°C during 10h, H2 can be obtained at lower temperatures. So, the treatment of the catalyst in H2 at 200°C has a drastic effect on H2 production from ethanol at very low temperature (≤250°C). Moreover, whatever the temperature, ethylacetate and acetone formations are lower than 0.5%. Over CeNi0.4OY catalyst, an ethanol conversion of 13% is obtained with about 50% of H2 at a reaction temperature of 200°C. Total ethanol conversion is obtained at about 400°C, showing very good catalytic results at relatively low temperature compared to the literature [9]. It is well known that physicochemical properties of a catalyst play an important role in the evolution of surface reactions. In ethanol SR both dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde or dehydration to ethylene can occur upon the nature of the catalyst. Clearly, CeNi x OY catalysts possess good dehydrogenation properties, accentuated once treated in H2 at 200°C, i.e., in the oxyhydride form. The catalytic results obtained depend on the Ni content of the compounds. Therefore, ethanol conversion and products distribution in the outlet gas stream are reported for reaction temperatures of 200°C, 250°C and 400°C (Fig. 9 ) as a function of the Ni/M T molar ratio of the catalysts previously in-situ treated in H2 at 200°C. At 200°C and 250°C, ethanol conversion is optimum over a Ni/M T ratio of 0.33 (Fig. 10 ), which corresponds to the CeNi x OY catalyst presenting the highest proportion of Ni species in strong interaction with Ce species either in solid solution or at NiO and ceria or solid solution interfaces. In the applied conditions, H2 formation is quite stable at about 50% almost whatever the temperature and almost Ni content (Fig. 11 ). At 200°C and 250°C, acetaldehyde formation presents a minimum when Ni/M T =0.33 and reaches a value of about 40% for higher Ni contents, while at 400°C this product disappears when Ni/M T ≥0.3 (Fig. 12 ). CH4, CO and CO2 follow same evolutions at 200°C and 250°C with the same curves for CH4 and CO presenting optima when Ni/M T =0.33 while CO2 is obtained in small concentration (Fig. 13 ). At 400°C, CH4 and CO present different evolutions (Fig. 14 ). CH4 increases globally with Ni content while CO presents two optima (a higher one when Ni/MT ≅0.4) and it disappears at high Ni content to the benefit of CO2. As the treatment in H2 at 200°C leads to a dramatic effect on H2 formation at low temperature, the influence of the treatment temperature in H2 was studied over the CeNi0.7OY chosen catalyst. As shown in Fig. 15 , ethanol conversion at 200°C and 250°C presents an optimum for a treatment temperature T T in H2 of 300°C, following in a quite interesting way the hydrogen chemical titration (Fig. 6). Moreover, the products distribution in the outlet gas stream depends also on the treatment temperature applied (Fig. 16 and 17 ). H2 is formed at temperatures higher than 100°C over treated in H2 catalysts. For treatment temperatures T T in H2 lower than 200°C, ethylacetate is the main product obtained with acetaldehyde as by-product which concentration depends on the reaction temperature (200°C Fig. 16 and 250°C Fig. 17). Formation of H2 is optimum over a treated in H2 at 200°C catalyst, but for higher treatment temperatures it is relatively stable. Concentration of CO2 is lower than 1%, so as expected, the steam reforming of ethanol (Eq. (4)) is negligible at these low temperatures. (4) C2H5OH+3 H2O→2 CO2 +6 H2 CH4 and CO concentrations follow same evolutions; they are higher at 250°C than at 200°C and present optima for T T ≅250°C−300°C when acetaldehyde concentration presents a minimum. For T T ≥200°C, ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and ethanol decomposition reaction seem to occur as the main reactions (Eqs. (5) and (6)). And, the decomposition reaction (Eq. (6)) is accentuated at 250°C when the solid is activated in H2 between 250°C and 300°C. When the solid is activated in H2 at T T >300°C, decomposition reaction decreases but it is important to recall that conversion decreases too (Fig. 15). (5) C2H5OH→CH3CHO+H2 (6) C2H5OH→H2 +CH4 +CO After an in-situ treatment in H2 in particular at 250°C, it was shown that the CeNi x OY solids studied become hydrogen reservoirs. During the activation treatment in H2 in temperature, the anionic vacancies created are able to accept hydride species (Eq. (3)) and the solids were called oxyhydrides. Moreover, taking into account the structure of the catalysts, particular active sites were modeled, involving anionic vacancies, hydrogen species and cations in close interaction whatever in the solid solution or at the NiO and ceria, and/or solid solution (with Ni) interfaces, as reported as an example in Scheme 1 . These sites are noted XM− YM′ and x and y correspond to the number of coordinative unsaturations i.e., anionic vacancies on each cation M and M′. It appears that different kinds of active sites which differ from each other in terms of the environment of Ni can exist [19]. Therefore, H2 production from ethanol SR certainly involves particular Ni species in close interaction with Ce species. These Ni species are easily reducible and reoxidable by the presence of Ce in close vicinity (redox system). Clearly, the treatment in H2 between 200°C and 300°C leads to a beneficial effect on H2 production. It was shown that this treatment allows the CeNi x OY mixed oxides to accept large quantities of hydrogen by the presence of anionic vacancies. Taking into account that dehydrogenation step requires abstraction of hydrogen species from alcohol, the ability of the solid to accept hydrogen can be a prerequisite condition. Therefore, by analogy to heterolytic dissociation of H2, heterolytic dissociation of ethanol can be envisaged on a low coordination site involving an anionic vacancy, as it was already proposed for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [25] and methane activation [22] over CeNi x Oy compounds. As with H2, the hydride species formed will be localized in the anionic vacancy and the H+ species will form with the O2− species a hydroxyl group."
8,Conclusions,"Ethanol steam reforming was studied over CeNi x OY (0< x ≤5) catalysts. A mixture of products is obtained, so methods for purification and storage of the H2 would need to be added to the process if this technology were to be used for H2 production. However, hydrogen can be produced at low temperature ≤250°C over CeNi x OY oxyhydrides i.e., mixed oxides previously in-situ treated in H2 in a temperature range comprised between 200°C and 300°C. The active nickel species belongs to the NiO crystallites and/or to the cerium–nickel solid solution where Ni species are in close interaction with Ce species permitting a redox process. The presence of cerium–nickel solid solution and/or small NiO crystallites (nanoparticles) allows optimizing the content of these Ni species presenting the characteristic of being able to be reduced and reoxidized easily and reversibly. While the dehydrogenation step requires the abstraction of hydrogen from alcohol, by analogy to heterolytic dissociation of H2, an active site is proposed based on the presence of anionic vacancies able to abstract hydride species from ethanol."
