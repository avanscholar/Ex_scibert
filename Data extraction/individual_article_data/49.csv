0,Introduction,"As the increasing demand for using sustainable carbon to replace the diminishing fossil fuels, selective hydrogenation of biomasses to useful chemicals has become a research focus which attracted widespread concern [1–4]. Furfural (FUR) as a classical biomass is a key precursor for the production of biofuels and furfural-derived chemicals [5,6]. Furfuryl alcohol (FOL) with a wide application in chemical industry, such as the manufacture of resins, adhesives, and synthetic fibers, is an important furfural-derived chemical from the hydrogenation of FUR [7–10]. However, traditional thermocatalysis for the hydrogenation of FUR suffers from high-temperature and high-pressure while the selectivity of product is hard to control. Achieving the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL under a mild condition is a significant challenge. Recently, a new photocatalytic process which has exhibited huge potential for the selective organic synthesis may be promising to address this issue [11–14]. However, the study on hydrogenation of FUR to FOL over a photocatalyst under visible light is infrequent. The key issue for converting FUR to FOL is the selective hydrogenation of C = O groups in FUR rather than C = C groups [15,16]. Developing an appropriate photocatalyst will be a meaningful challenge for the selective hydrogenation of C = O groups in FUR. Nowadays, two-dimensional (2D) photocatalysts have attracted extensive concern because of their ultrathin nanosheets nature, abundant surface sites, better charge carrier separation and unique physicochemical properties [17–20]. The selective organic transformation over 2D ultrathin nanosheets has been widely studied [21–23]. In view of this, our group has developed a series of 2D ultrathin nanosheets photocatalysts, such as, HNb3O8 [24], BiOCl [25] and Bi2MoO6 [26] for the selective organic transformation. These studies reveal that designing ultrathin 2D structure for photocatalysts not only greatly enhances the photocatalytic performance of themselves, but also provides an in-depth insight for understanding the interaction between the organic molecules and the active sites at a molecular level. The surface unsaturated metal sites on nanosheets, such as Lewis acid sites, can selectively chemisorb and activate specific organic groups, achieving the precision synthesis of target product [27]. Moreover, 2D ultrathin nanosheets with rich surface unsaturated sites can support metal nanoparticles as functional sites to promote photocatalytic performance via the synergistic effects between nanosheets and metals nanoparticles [28,29]. Many studies about metals/nanosheets such as Pt/Sb2WO6 [30], Pd/H1.07Ti1.03O4 [31,32], Pt/C3N4 [33], Au/TiO2 [34] and Pd/HNb3O8 [35] have been further developed for greatly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. These studies highlight that the introduction of metal nanoparticles enriches the surface properties of nanosheets and accelerates the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, based on the synergistic effects between nanosheets and metals nanoparticles, a composite photocatalyst with a 2D ultrathin nanosheet structure and functional metals sites may be the promising candidate for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. SnNb2O6 as a typical layered niobate is constituted by the corner-sharing octahedral NbO6 units with Sn2+ ions located between two sheets [36]. The presence of Sn regulars the electronic band structure, making the photo-absorption of SnNb2O6 expand to the visible light region. Some previous studies have successfully prepared ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheets and exhibit excellent performance in hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction and degradation of pollutant under visible light due to the suitable energy band position of SnNb2O6 [37–39]. In addition, our latest work has reported that the Au-Pd/SnNb2O6 nanosheets can be used for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde under visible light [40]. It is revealed that the ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet with rich surface Lewis acid sites can selectively chemisorb and activate cinnamaldehyde, achieving the precise organic transformation via a photocatalytic route. Therefore, ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet may be an appropriate photocatalyst for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. Furthermore, the activation and dissociation of H2 for the hydrogenation reaction are indispensable. It is well known that Pt is a very useful metal for activating and dissociating H2 [41–45]. Thus, Pt nanoparticles supported on ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet as a functionalized photocatalyst can be designed for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. Herein, ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet with high dispersed Pt nanoparticles is successfully prepared for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL under visible light irradiation. The phase structures and morphologies of the prepared samples are well studied by XRD, SEM, TEM and AFM. Controlled experiments are carried out to investigate the influence of Pt, SN, temperature and time for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. The surface Lewis acid sites on prepared ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet are confirmed by the in situ FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption. The adsorption behavior of FUR molecule on SN is also revealed by in situ FTIR and XPS. Moreover, the active H species is detected using EPR technology. Based on the above experiments results, the surface/interface interaction between FUR molecules and surface sites of Pt/SN is revealed and a possible photocatalytic mechanism for selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL over Pt/SN is proposed at a molecular level."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet (SN) and bulk SnNb2O6 (LSN),2.1 Preparation of ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheet (SN) and bulk SnNb2O6 (LSN) The SnNb2O6 nanosheets and the layered SnNb2O6 (LSN) were prepared via a hydrothermal method according to the previous work [40]. Detailed process was shown in supporting information.
3,"Preparation of Pt/SnNb2O6 (Pt/SN, Pt/LSN)","2.2 Preparation of Pt/SnNb2O6 (Pt/SN, Pt/LSN) 1 wt% Pt/SN was prepared via a photoreduction method. The synthesis was carried as follows: Firstly, SN was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water. Then the solution of H2PtCl6·4H2O (10 mg mL−1) was added to the suspensions. Meanwhile, 5 mL of methanol as the hole sacrifice agent was added. The mixture was irradiated under a 300 W Xe-lamp ((Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd., PLS-SXE300D) for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. Finally, the samples were collected, washed with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. In addition, 1 wt% Pt/LSN was prepared via the same process."
4,Characterization,2.3 Characterization The detailed information for the characterization was shown in supporting information.
5,Photocatalytic hydrogenation of FUR to FOL,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogenation of FUR to FOL The hydrogenation of FUR was carried out as follows. 8 mg of catalyst was added in a 20 mL of Schlenk tube in a H2 atmosphere. Then a mixture of FUL (0.1 mmol) and methanol (2.0 mL) saturated with H2 was added to the tube. After the dark adsorption for 30 min, the reaction system was irradiated using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter for 2 h. After the reaction, the catalyst was removed through a Millipore filter (0.22 µm). The final solution was analyzed by a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph. The conversion of FUR and the selectivity of FOL were calculated as follows: Conversion (%) = [(C 0 − C FUR)/C 0] × 100, Selectivity (%) = [C FOL/(C 0 − C FUR)] × 100, Yield (%) = (C FOL/C 0) × 100. C 0 represents the initial concentration of FUR. C FUR and C FOL are the concentrations of FUR and FOL in solution after the photocatalytic reaction, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results The phase structures and morphology features of the prepared samples were determined using XRD, SEM, TEM and AFM. XRD patterns of the prepared SN, Pt/SN and LSN are shown in Fig. 1 (a). The diffraction peaks of all the samples are well matched with the standard monoclinic SnNb2O6 (JCPDS#84–1810), indicating the successful preparation of the SnNb2O6 samples [37]. Comparing with LSN, it is obvious that the XRD pattern of SN possesses weaker peak intensity and wider half peak width, suggesting the nanostructure characteristic of SN. However, no obvious Pt (111) diffraction peak at 39.1° can be observed which may be because the loading amounts of Pt are too low [46]. The SEM image (Fig. 1b) clearly exhibits nanosheets morphology of SN. Meanwhile, nearly transparent nanosheets can be also observed in TEM image of SN (Fig. 1c), indicating that SN has an ultrathin thickness. Moreover, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1d) shows the single crystalline nature of SN, demonstrating that SN ultrathin nanosheets retain a good crystallinity. The thickness of SN nanosheets is further investigated by AFM as shown in Fig. 1(e and f). The average thickness of SN nanosheets is about 4.1 nm, corresponding to 5-unit cells of the SnNb2O6 [40]. These results confirm that the SN ultrathin nanosheets with 4.1 nm thickness are successfully prepared. In addition, the SEM image of Pt/SN in Fig. S2(b) also shows the ultrathin nanosheets structures, suggesting that the nanosheet structure of SN is well preserved in Pt/SN. But it is difficult to find Pt nanoparticles in Fig. S2(b), which may be due to the very small size of Pt nanoparticle. To ascertain that Pt is successfully loaded on the SN nanosheets, the TEM images of Pt/SN are provided in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2(a), transparent nanosheets with evenly distributed nanoparticles can be observed. Meanwhile, HRTEM image of Pt/SN (Fig. 2b) exhibits distinct lattice fringes with the distance of 0.227 nm, corresponding to the (111) crystalline plane of Pt [47]. It is also revealed in Fig. 2(c) that the average diameter of Pt nanoparticles is about 3.3 nm. These results confirm that Pt nanoparticles with about 3.3 nm diameter are successfully loaded on the SN nanosheets. In addition, the element mapping of Pt/SN (Fig. 2d–g) also indicates that Pt element is well distributed on the SN nanosheets. XPS spectra of Pt/SN and SN are further provided to investigate the surface chemical state of Pt, Sn, Nb, and O elements. The XPS survey spectra of the SN and Pt/SN are shown in Fig. S2(a). Sn, Nb, and O elements have a strong signal while a weak signal of Pt element can also be found in Pt/SN spectrum, further confirming the existence of Pt element on the SN nanosheet. The reason for the weak signal of Pt is due to the low loading. Fig. 3 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Sn, Nb, O, Pt elements. For the XPS spectra of Sn 3d (Fig. 3a), the bind energy at 494.5 and 486.0 eV are respectively attributed to Sn 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2, revealing that the chemical state of Sn is Sn2+. It is interesting that Sn4+ can be fitted in Pt/SN [40]. It suggests that a small number of Sn2+ is oxidized after photo-deposition. The possible reason for the formation of small amount of Sn4+ is the oxidation of photo-generated holes. The presence of Sn4+ may be beneficial to enhance the interface interaction between SN and Pt nanoparticles, which would make the photo-generated electrons transfer easily to promote the photocatalytic activity. The XPS spectra of Nb 3d (Fig. 3b) have two peaks at 209.6 and 206.8 eV which are correspond to Nb5+ species [39]. The O 1 s signals of Pt/SN and SN (Fig. 3c) can be fitted to three peaks, respectively attributed to adsorbed oxygen species (Oabsorbed), hydroxy (OOH), and lattice oxygen (Olattice) [48–50]. In addition, the chemical state of Pt nanoparticles is also revealed in Fig. 3(d). The binding energy at 70.8 and 74.1 eV are attributed to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2, respectively, indicating that the Pt nanoparticles in Pt/SN are metallic Pt0 [51]. The metallic Pt0 can be also confirmed using the in situ FTIR spectra for absorbing CO over Pt/SN. As shown in Fig. S2(b), an obvious characteristic peak at 2053 cm−1 can be observed which is assigned to Pt···CO vibration peak, revealing the existence of Pt0 [46,52]. The photo-absorption ability of the prepared samples is studied by UV-DRS spectra. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the yellow LSN and SN samples have good ability for absorbing visible light. The band gap width (Eg) of LSN and SN are 2.46 and 2.52 eV, respectively. After loading Pt nanoparticles, the Eg of Pt/SN is almost no change comparing with the Eg of SN, indicating the suitable band gap width of SN is retained. In addition, nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption isotherms are used to reveal the specific surface area of the prepared samples. Fig. 4(b) clearly exhibits the specific surface area of LSN, SN and Pt/SN is 2.3, 44.1 and 48.3 m2 g−1, respectively. SN possesses a bigger specific surface area than LSN because of its ultrathin 2D structure. The huger specific surface area of SN will bring more surface sites for supporting Pt nanoparticle and absorbing organic molecule. The specific surface area of Pt/SN is bigger than that of SN which is attributed to the loading of Pt nanoparticles. The ability of the prepared samples for separating and transferring photo-generated carries is investigated by electrochemical test. The transient photocurrent response curves of LSN, SN and Pt/SN are shown in Fig. 4(c). The photocurrent intensity of SN is higher than that of LSN. Ultrathin nanosheets structure of SN shortens the distance between photo-generated carries and catalyst surface. It greatly accelerates the photo-generated carriers to transfer to the surface of catalyst. After loading Pt nanoparticle on SN, the photocurrent intensity is further enhanced because Pt nanoparticles with high work function can serve as the electron enrichment center to transfer photo-generated electrons, causing the efficient separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. It can be observed that the transient photocurrent intensity for the Pt/SN has obvious attenuation. The possible reason is that the photo-generated holes of SN would oxidize metallic Pt nanoparticles in the absence of hole sacrificial agent. Therefore, the transfer of photo-generated electrons is inhibited, resulting the attenuation of the transient photocurrent intensity. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results (Fig. 4d) also confirm that Pt/SN has a good ability for the separation of photo-generated carriers. The superiority of Pt/SN is highlighted based on the above results."
8,Photocatalytic performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance The prepared samples are further used for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL in an H2 atmosphere under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). As shown in Table 1 , FUR cannot convert to FOL over SN and LSN. It is because that pure SN and LSN lack Pt nanoparticles as functional sites to dissociate H2 for the hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. The photocatalytic performance is greatly improved when loading Pt nanoparticles on SnNb2O6. It is consistent with our expected results that the prepared Pt/SN exhibits the best activity, achieving the 99.9% conversion of FUR with 99.9% selectivity of FOL in 2 h. Moreover, when loading Pt on LSN, only 7.5% of FUR is converted with a 60.4% selectivity for FOL. The higher activity of Pt/SN may be because that the ultrathin nanosheets structure of SN brings more surface sites for absorbing and activating FUR molecules. It is worth noting that Pt/SN has a 14.2% conversion of FUR with 99.9% selectivity of FOL in the dark. This result suggests that thermal effect can influence the hydrogenation of FUR to FOL over Pt/SN. We further control the temperature at 333 K by oil bath. The conversion of FUR in the dark at 333 K increases to 63.4%, indicating that the conversion of FUR can be increased with the increasing temperature. Although the temperature has risen to 333 K, the conversion of FUR cannot arrive at 99.9%. Therefore, the promotion effect of photocatalysis on the performance for the hydrogenation of FUR to FOL is much higher than that of thermocatalysis at 298 K. In addition, the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL over Pt/P25 and Pt/SiO2 is conducted. The prepared 1 wt% Pt/P25 and 1 wt% Pt/SiO2 exhibit only 4.6% and 3.2% conversion of FUR, respectively. The low performance is because that P25 and SiO2 cannot be photoexcited under visible light. Even if there is no light, Pt/SN has 14.2% conversion of FUR with 99.9% selectivity of FOL which is much higher than Pt/P25 and Pt/SiO2, indicating that the rich surface sites of SN promote the selective adsorption and activation of FUR. Besides, we also compare the performance of Pt/SN with the reported studies. As shown in Table S1, it is clear that these studies are conducted with additional pressure or temperature. Comparing with the reported studiess, our work would achieve the hydrogenation of FUR to FOL without any byproducts in a normal temperature and pressure. The above results suggest that the prepared Pt/SN is a very potential photocatalyst to achieve the selective hydrogenation of FUR in a mild condition. The hydrogenation of FUR to FOL over Pt/SN with different reaction time is also studied to reveal the most optimal reaction time. As shown in Fig. S3(a), the conversion of FUR is gradually improved as time goes on. FUR can be completely converted in only 2 h. Meanwhile, the yield of FOL and the conversion of FUR are almost the same, indicating that FUR can be completely converted to FOL without any by-products. As time goes to 2.5 h, the yield of FOL is remained, suggesting the further hydrogenation of FOL over Pt/SN is hard to react. It achieves our goal for the precise photocatalytic synthesis of FOL from FUR. Moreover, Pt/SN with different mass fractions of Pt is prepared for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to reveal the influence of Pt loading amount. As shown in Fig. S3(b), 1 wt% Pt/SN exhibits the best performance. The conversion of FUR is increased with the increasing mass fraction of Pt. The possible reason is that the low loading amount of Pt would inhibit the dissociation of H2, causing the decreasing conversion of FUR. Therefore, the optimal loading amount of Pt is 1%. In addition, to reveal the stability of Pt/SN, recycle experiment for the hydrogenation of FUR is conducted as shown in Fig. S4(a). After 5 times of recycle, Pt/SN still keeps a high activity for the hydrogenation of FUR, confirming that Pt/SN have a good catalytic stability. The XRD pattern (Fig. S4b) and XPS spectra (Fig. S5) of Pt/SN after five photocatalytic reactions are basically unchanged, also exhibiting the excellent structure stability of Pt/SN. Overall, the photocatalytic hydrogenation experiments reveal that the prepared Pt/SN is a high-efficiency and stable photocatalyst for the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. To further explore the general applicability of Pt/SN, the photocatalytic hydrogenation of other substrates (Table 2 ) with C = O and C = C groups over Pt/SN is conducted. It is obvious that the acetophenone, benzaldehyde and 1-phenyl-1-propanone can be well hydrogenated to the corresponding alcohol with a high conversion and selectivity over Pt/SN. Therefore, Pt/SN as a functionalized photocatalyst exhibits a general applicability. In addition, Pt/SN is used for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamyl aldehyde (Table 2, entry 5). The conversion of cinnamyl aldehyde is 98.3% but the selectivity of cinnamyl alcohol is only 72.6%. The excessive hydrogenation product of 3-phenylpropanol will be produced which may be because that the single C = C is easier to break than the C = C of benzene or furan. It discloses that Pt/SN is more appropriate for the selective hydrogenation of furan aldehyde and aromatic aldehyde without additional C = C."
9,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism Based on the hydrogenation reaction results, Pt/SN exhibits the best performance for the selective hydrogenation of FUR, suggesting the good synergistic effect between SN ultrathin nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles. It is worth exploring the respective roles of SN ultrathin nanosheets and Pt nanoparticles for the selective hydrogenation of FUR. As we all know that one of the key factors affecting the performance of heterogeneous catalysis is the adsorption behavior of reactant on catalyst surface. Therefore, the adsorption behavior of FUR molecule on SN and LSN is investigated firstly via the in situ FTIR spectra. As shown in Fig. 5 , several characteristic peaks assigned to FUR can be observed in the FTIR spectrum of Pt/SN after adsorbing FUR for 30 min at 25 °C (Fig. 5a2). Even though the sample is further degassed in vacuum at 180 °C for 5 min to remove excess FUR, these characteristic peaks still remain (Fig. 5a3), revealing that a strong chemisorption interaction is formed between SN and FUR molecule. The characteristic peaks at 1673 and 1475 cm −1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of C = O (υ C=O) and C = C (υ C=C), respectively [40,52]. The peak of υ C=O shifts to low wavenumber after further degassing (Fig. 5a3) while the peak of υ C=C has no shift, indicating that SN tends to chemisorb C = O groups in FUR instead of C = C groups. This may be the reason for achieving 99.9% selectivity of FOL over Pt/SN. In addition, the in situ FTIR spectrum of LSN after further degassing (Fig. 5b3) is similar to the pristine FTIR spectrum of LSN (Fig. 5b1), suggesting the weak adsorption between LSN and FUR molecule. Thus, the conversion of FUR is only 7.5% and the selectivity of FOL is just 60.4% over Pt/LSN. The 2D structural superiority of SN ultrathin nanosheet makes that more FUR molecules can be easily absorbed and activated. The adsorption behavior of FUR molecules on Pt/SN is also studied to reveal the influence of Pt nanoparticles (Fig. S6a). It can be observed that the adsorption behavior of FUR molecules on Pt/SN is almost the same as that on SN, indicating that the interaction between Pt nanoparticles and FUR molecules is negligible. Furthermore, the adsorption behavior of FOL molecules on SN is shown in Fig. S5(b). It is obvious that after further degassing (Fig. S6b3), the characteristic peaks at 1671, 1401 and 1220 cm−1 are disappeared. This result demonstrates that FOL molecules are easy to desorb over SN, greatly promoting the selective transformation of FUR to FOL. What sites on SN nanosheet is responsible for absorbing C = O groups in FUR? Some previous studies have reported that the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst can absorb C = O groups in FUR via chemical coordination, achieving the selective hydrogenation of FUR. The in situ FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption (3 and 4 in Fig. 5) are provided to investigate the surface acid sites of SN and LSN. As shown in Fig. 5(b3), the characteristic peak at 1450 cm−1 is assigned to pyridine absorbs on the Lewis acid sites [24]. Even after further degassing in vacuum, this peak is still remained (Fig. 5 c3), indicating the strong Lewis acid sites of SN. Therefore, the main sites for absorbing C = O groups are the Lewis acid sites of SN ultrathin nanosheet. The possible adsorption behavior of FUR molecule over SN is proposed as shown in Fig. S7. For FUR molecule, the O atom has a bigger electronegativity than C atom in C = O groups, resulting in that the bonding electrons are biased toward O atom. Furthermore, it is reported that the unsaturated surface Nb5+ can serve as Lewis acid sites [24]. Thus, Nb5+ in SN as Lewis acid site is a good electron acceptor which can coordinate with electron-rich groups easily, forming surface coordination species. FUR molecule can be chemisorbed on SN via an Nb···O = C coordination, which makes the effective activation of FUR molecules and the further photocatalytic hydrogenation of the activated FUR molecules can be more easily. XPS spectra of Pt/SN absorbed FUR are used to demonstrate the change for electron cloud density of Nb, Sn, Pt and O element after absorbing FUR molecule. As shown in Fig. S8, after absorbing FUR, O 1s has an obvious new peak at binding energy 532.2 eV which is corresponding to organic C = O groups, confirming the chemisorption between SN and FUR molecule. In addition, the binding energy of Nb 3d shifts to lower binding energy after absorbing FUR, indicating that the electron cloud density of Nb is increased. The possible reason is that electron-rich O atom in C = O group can bind with Nb, forming an Nb···O = C coordination. Then the electron of O can shift to Nb via Nb···O = C coordination, causing the decreased binding energy of Nb. Meanwhile, the binding energy of Pt 4f and Sn 3d are hardly changed, suggesting that the contribution of Pt and Sn for absorbing FUR molecule is negligible. All the results demonstrate that Nb5+ in SN as Lewis acid site can selectively chemisorb C = O group in FUR via forming Nb···O = C coordination, causing the effective activation of FUR molecules. It is consistent with in situ FTIR results, further confirming the selective adsorption and activation of C = O groups over Pt/SN. Additionally, the dissociation of H2 in the hydrogenation of FUR is another important factor for affecting the performance of Pt/SN. The temperature-programmed reduction of hydro-oxygen titration for SN and Pt/SN is studied to elucidate that Pt nanoparticles can dissociate H2 molecules (Fig. 6 a). A strong peak at 320 °C over Pt/SN can be observed, attributing to the dissociative adsorption of H2 on the surface of Pt nanoparticles [53,54]. In addition, SN shows no signals for dissociation of H2 molecules, indicating that H2 molecules cannot be dissociated over SN. This also explains the reason why pure SN cannot convert FUR to FOL. Moreover, EPR test is conducted to reveal that the active H intermediate as main active species can be formed in the reaction process. As shown in Fig. 6(b), there are no signals for the spectra of SN, illustrating that SN cannot dissociate H2 to active H (H). This is the reason that SN cannot convert FUR to FOL. On the contrary, an obvious signal attributed to active H can be observed for the spectra of Pt/SN whether in the dark or under the light, indicating that Pt nanoparticles as co-catalyst are good functional sites for dissociating H2 [40]. It is worth noticing that the active H signal is very weak in the dark. Therefore, Pt/SN only converts little FUR to FOL in the dark. The intensity of active H signal is greatly enhanced under the visible light irradiation. This may be because that the photo-generated electrons can transfer to Pt nanoparticles forming electron enrichment centers which greatly promoting the dissociation of H2. The enough active H greatly supports the hydrogenation of FUR, achieving the 99.9% conversion of FUR in the photocatalytic route. In a word, Pt nanoparticles are the main sites for dissociating H2 molecules to active H and photo-generated electrons of SN can greatly promote the dissociation of H2 on Pt nanoparticles at room temperature. Based on the experimental results, as shown in Scheme 1 , a possible mechanism is proposed to elucidate the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL over Pt/SN. Firstly, the abundant surface Lewis acid sites of SN can chemisorb FUR molecules via forming Nb···O = C coordination between SN and C = O in FUR. FUR molecules would be efficiently activated over SN to produce the surface coordination species which can be further hydrogenated easily. In the dark, only a thermal catalytic process would be occurred. Under the H2 atmosphere, Pt nanoparticles as surface functional sites can slowly dissociate H2 to produce scanty active H species without light. Then the active H species as H source makes little FUR convert to FOL. This process makes 14.2% of FUR convert to FOL in 2 h. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalysis and thermocatalysis would be conducted at the same time. In the photocatalytic route, SN can be photoexcited, forming photo-generated electrons and holes. The holes may be consumed by CH3OH to avoid excess secondary reaction while the electrons quickly transfer to Pt nanoparticles forming electron enrichment centers to greatly promote the dissociation of H2 which is hard to react in the dark. Thus, there are rich active H species in the photocatalytic route, significantly supporting the selective hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. This is the reason that the promotion effect of photocatalysis for the hydrogenation of FUR to FOL is much higher than that of thermocatalysis at 298 K. The synergistic effect between photocatalysis and thermocatalysis achieves a high conversion (99.9%) of FUR with a high selectivity (99.9%) for FOL under visible light."
10,Conclusion,"In summary, SN ultrathin nanosheets with functional Pt nanoparticles are designed and prepared successfully for the precise hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. This composite photocatalyst exhibits a high conversion (99.9%) of FUR with a high selectivity (99.9%) for FOL under visible light. Pt/SN as a surface functionalized photocatalyst can be also expanded to hydrogenate other unsaturated aldehyde with a good performance. Comparing with LSN, SN with the ultrathin nanosheets structure has bigger specific surface area, quicker separation ability of photo-generated carriers and richer surface sites. In addition, the abundant Lewis acid sites of SN are responsible for absorbing and activating FUR molecules via forming Nb···O = C coordination. The surface high dispersed Pt nanoparticles can serve as electron enrichment centers to gather the photo-generated electrons and greatly promote the dissociation of H2. Therefore, the activated FUR molecules would easily react with rich active H species to achieve the efficient hydrogenation of FUR to FOL. This work not only achieves the precise upgrading of biomass by optimizing the structure and designing surface function mental sites for the photocatalyst but also gives insight into the inherent catalytic behavior at a molecular level."
