0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass has been viewed as a renewable and abundantly available sustainable resource for producing high-quality bio-fuels, bio-gases, carbon-based materials, and value-added pharmaceutical chemicals [1]. Pyrolysis is an efficient method to convert this lignocellulosic biomass to bio-oil (Py-oil), which is a clean liquid resource for the production of biofuel intended for transportation applications [2,3]. Quality of the Py-oil is mainly dependent on the lignocellulosic composition of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose present in the biomass samples [4,5]. Usually, the produced fresh Py-oil possess unfavorable fuel properties including high water content, high acidity, low heating value and high instability due to the presence of oxygenated compounds and unsaturated macromolecules [6]. A suitable conversion process for upgrading Py-oil is an essential step to facilitate the commercialization of the oil as a transportation fuel. Catalytic cracking over zeolite-based catalysts, alkylation, thermal condensation reactions, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), and electrochemical conversion process are the certain important methodologies for Py-oil upgradation to biofuels [7–12]. Among them, hydrothermal reactor-assisted HDO process seems to be cost-effective technique for the upgradation of Py-oil toward bio-fuel production [9,13–15]. The HDO of Py-oil is a catalytic process performed using a metal catalyst under high H2 partial pressure. Catalyst material is a crucial parameter that directs the quality and cost of biofuels production from Py-oil. Notably, noble monometallic catalysts such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru have demonstrated promising catalytic performance for upgradation of bio-oil in the HDO process [10,16–19]. These noble metal catalysts could effectively produce high quality upgraded bio-oil with much higher oil yield. Heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts including rare-earth and noble elements composition such as Pt-Pd and Rh-Pd showed excellent performance in upgrading bio-oil as compared to monometallic catalysts [20–22]. However, these catalysts are unattractive for industrialization due to, severe catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposition (coking) on the surface of the catalyst, and poor re-usability of the catalyst [23,24]. On the other hand, transition metal sulfides including MoS2, Ni-MoS2, VS2, WS2, TiS2, and Co-MoS2 nanohybrids have received considerable attention due to higher conversion efficiency of phenols and oxygenated components of Py-oil to alcohols and hydrocarbons than noble metals based catalysts [25,26]. However, decreased stability due to sulfur poisoning, lower selectivity, poor reusability, and high cost makes them unfit for industrialization [27]. Recently, transition metals elements and its nanocomposites such as Ni, Fe, Co, Ni2P, Ni/Ce, CoO, NiO/ZSM-5, Ni/Al2O3, and Mo/Al2O3–TiO2 are attracting great attention for bio-oil upgradation due to low cost and high catalytic activity [18,7,8,28–31]. Among them, Ni-based nanocomposites are usually considered as low cost and high-performance catalysts for industrialization of the HDO process. Specifically, Ni-Cu and Ni-Cu/ZSM based bimetallic catalysts showed better deoxygenation of the oxygenated compounds and favored the production of aliphatic and more number of aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil under H2 atmosphere [11,32,33]. However, these bimetallic catalysts display poor chemical stability due to bio-oil acidity and poor recyclability. To overcome these issues, Fe supported Ni-based bimetallic (Ni3Fe) catalyst was synthesized that showed increased catalytic activity in various reforming reactions and a higher magnetic property that may be beneficial for catalyst regeneration [34]. These unique properties of Ni3Fe bimetal could serve as an ideal hydrogenation catalyst for deoxygenation, aromatization, and alkylation of bio-oil. In this work, Ni3Fe bimetallic hybrid catalyst was successfully synthesized through a solvothermal assisted co-reduction method. Various characterization tools including FE-SEM, XRD, and VSM were used to investigate the physicochemical properties of the Ni3Fe catalyst. Py-oil produced from date seed biomass wastes at 500 °C under nitrogen atmosphere was fed to the catalyst for upgradation using hydrothermal assisted HDO process under partial H2 pressure. Several analytical techniques including proximate, ultimate, FT-IR and GC–MS were used to characterize the upgraded oil (HDO Py-oil). Interestingly, aromatics and unsaturated alkenes were produced at moderate temperature, low pressure, and minimal hydrogen consumption."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ajwa date seed (DS) biomass received from local date fruit industries in Abu Dhabi, UAE were washed several times to remove dust, foreign materials, dirt, and fibers, crushed and sieved to sizes in the range of 50–100 µm. Nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 99.9%), iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, 99.9%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.9%), hydrazine hydrate solution (NH2NH2·H2O, 50–60%), ethylene glycol solution (C2H6O2, 99.8%), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG, H(OCH2CH2)nOH), acetone (99.9%) and ethanol (96%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany. All the chemicals and solutions were of analytical grade and thus used in the experiments without any further treatment."
3,Preparation of Ni3Fe magnetic alloy nanoparticles,"2.2 Preparation of Ni3Fe magnetic alloy nanoparticles In this study, 1.5 g of NiCl2·6H2O, 0.5 g of FeCl2·4H2O and 0.1 g of NaOH were added into 30 mL ethylene glycol and stirred until completely dissolved. Afterwards, 2 mL of hydrazine hydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) solution was slowly added and the mixture was heated to 70 °C for 30 min. The resulting blackish/green mixture solution was transferred to a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitate was separated and collected, washed with ethanol, dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven and stored. The obtained magnetic alloy nanoparticles were characterized by several analytical techniques to investigate the physicochemical properties of the samples. The morphological features of the synthesized catalyst materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-7610F, JEOL, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Titan TEM 300 kV) with selected area diffraction (SAED). Crystallinity and structural studies of the samples were obtained through an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, USA). XRD analysis was performed under 10–80° of 2θ with 2° min−1 of scan-rate at 40 kV and 40 mA. Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (Lakeshore VSM 7410, USA) was used to examine the magnetic properties of the samples. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab Mk2) was used to determine the chemical structure and compositions of the Ni3Fe catalyst."
4,Production of date seed-derived pyrolysis-oil (Py-oil),"2.3 Production of date seed-derived pyrolysis-oil (Py-oil) Pyrolysis was carried out in a bench-scale setup, consisting of a horizontal reactor, feeding system, gas flow controllers, quenching system with cooling condensers and a char separation system, as shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor was first heated to 500 °C. Meanwhile, ca. 200 g of ground DS biomass was packed in ceramic boats and sealed into the silica tubes. Nitrogen gas was used as the purge stream to prevent oxidation effects. After 15 min, the silica tube was introduced into the pre-heated reactor and processed for 30 min. The resulting vapors were passed through water cooling condensers which removed the condensable organics (oil) and the remaining non-condensable gases were vented to a fume hood. The overall py-oil yield (YPy-oil) was calculated using Eq. (1) as: (1) Y b i o - o i l ( % ) = m P y - o i l m b i o m a s s × 100 where mbio-oil and mbiomass are the mass of condensed py-oil and biomass feed, respectively."
5,Catalytic upgradation and characterization of Py-oil,"2.4 Catalytic upgradation and characterization of Py-oil Pyrloyised oil was upgraded using the setup shown in Fig. 1. In this study, 20 mL of fresh Py-oil and 0.5 g of Ni3Fe catalyst were added into a stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 250 °C for 120 min in 10 bar H2 pressure. Afterwards, the hydrodeoxygenated Py-oil (HDO Py-oil) and coke/catalysts sediments were separated via ultracentrifugation (Ultracentrifuge – Sorvall MX 150 Plus, rotating speed-5000 rpm) for 30 min. The superannuated upgraded HDO Py-oil was collected and analyzed for proximate and ultimate analysis to understand their physical, chemical and thermal properties. The HDO Py-oil sample was characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker A 588 TG-FT-IR), Karl Fischer titration (H2O), pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Agilent 7890B GC & 5977A MSD), viscometer (Lovis 2000 M/ME rolling-ball viscometer), and elemental analysis using elemental analyzer (EA1110, CE instruments). The Higher heating value (HHV) of upgraded HDO Py-oil was determined through an oxygen combustion bomb calorimeter (DIN 51900, Parr Instrument Company). The following equations were used to estimate the conversion, yield, and selectivity of a specific compound in the HDO Py-oil: (2) C o n v e r s i o n % = I PO - F PO I PO × 100 (3) Y i e l d % = W PO I PO × 100 (4) S e l e c t i v i t y % = W PO I PO - F PO × 100 where IPO is the initial concentration of the compound in fresh Py-oil (in wt%), FPO is the final concentration of the compound in HDO Py-oil (in wt%), and WPO is the concentration of organic compound (in wt%) formed during the HDO of the Py-oil. Meanwhile, the Ni3Fe catalyst was separated from coke sediment using a permanent external magnet for reusability purposes. For the recyclability test, five consecutive upgradation cycles were conducted and for each run, the used Ni3Fe catalyst was washed three times with ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C overnight for regeneration. Then the post-reaction catalyst was annealed at 250 °C for 4 h under H2 atmosphere to remove the surface oxidation. The spent Ni3Fe catalyst was then collected for physicochemical analysis."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Nucleation growth mechanism and physicochemical properties of Ni3Fe catalyst,"3.1 Nucleation growth mechanism and physicochemical properties of Ni3Fe catalyst Solvothermal assisted wet chemical co-reduction method was used for the preparation of Ni3Fe magnetic nanoparticles (MANPs) catalysts. Fig. 2 (a) shows the schematic illustration for the formation mechanism of Ni3Fe MANPs. Generally, it is challenging to prepare magnetic alloy through a wet chemical co-reduction route in an open system because of the remarkably different potential energy between M2+/M (M = Metals) pairs [35,36]. However, solvothermal assisted co-reduction routes efficiently reduced iron (Fe2+) and nickel (Ni2+) ions in a closed system using a hot alkali solution. During the first stage, NaOH solution was added dropwise to the precursor solution (the yellow-green solution containing Fe2+ and Ni2+ ions) which immediately turned into muddy suspensions, indicating the formation of intermediate phases of solid hydroxides Fe(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 [37]. Meanwhile, the reaction temperature was increased to 70 °C and held for 30 min before adding the hydrazine hydrate that finally resulted in a black-colored solution. In the second stage, the solution was transferred into the hydrothermal vessel and heated up to 180 °C for 12 h. Specifically, a closed hydrothermal system generates a relatively high partial pressure of nitrogen (N2) and ammonia (NH3) with E0 = 1.05 V which contributed to the co-reduction of Fe2+ and Ni2+ ions. The chemical reactions could be expressed [38]: (1) 2 N i 2 + + 4 O H - + N 2 H 4 → 2 N i + N 2 + 4 H 2 O E 0 = 0.49 V (2) 2 F e 2 + + 4 O H - + N 2 H 4 → 2 F e + N 2 + 4 H 2 O E 0 = 0.49 V where E0 is the standard electromotive force of the chemical reduction reaction. The free Ni2+ and Fe2+ ions sharply decrease based on the dissolution-deposition equilibrium and the corresponding reduction in potential energy could be calculated using the Nernst equation. At this stage, the Ni2+ and Fe2+ species could be co-reduced to metallic Ni and Fe atoms followed by generation of alloyed Ni-Fe nuclei, which is thermodynamically a favorable process [39,40]. The following reaction mechanism describes the formation of Ni3Fe nuclei. (3) 3 N i + F e → N i 3 F e Consequently, Ni3Fe nucleation growth started in the ethylene glycol solution under the solvothermal condition in alkali solution leading to the formation of Ni3Fe MANPs. Furthermore, the obtained Ni3Fe MANPs were characterized by various analytical tools to understand the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDS was carried out to estimate the morphology and elemental composition of the synthesized Ni3Fe MANPs catalysts. A general impression SEM image is shown in Fig. 2(b) indicates homogeneously dispersed uniform-sized Ni3Fe MANPs particles are observed in the sample. The high enlarged SEM images (Fig. 2(c and d)) show well-defined octagon-like nanostructures with a diameter of ~ 130 nm present in Ni3Fe MANP’s. Evidently, a closed solvothermal condition successfully co-reduced Ni2+ and Fe2+ ions simultaneously and facilitated the formation of alloy phase without isolation under an alkaline condition and in the presence of hydrazine hydrate [38,40,41]. Further, in order to elucidate the elemental composition and atomic ratios, Ni3Fe MANPs were analyzed in EDS analysis. From Fig. 2(e), it can be observed that Ni3Fe MANPs are comprised of major elements of Ni and Fe with an atomic ratio of 65:22 which is in good agreement with the initial ratios of two elements in starting metallic precursors. Also, a small percentage of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) elements were also present in the sample due to the effect of surfactant (PEG) and formation of the oxide shell around the nanoparticles. Further, HR-TEM image in Fig. 2(f) confirm the crystalline nature and alloy formation of the Ni3Fe MANPs. The inset Fig. 2(f) clearely shows the lattice fringes of Ni3Fe with d-spacing of 0.205 nm consistent to (1 1 1) crystalline plane of Ni3Fe MANPs [39,40]. Additionally, SAED pattern of the alloyed Ni3Fe MANPs in Fig. 2(g) confirm the existence of the polycrystalline with electron diffraction rings of (1 1 1), (2 2 0), and (2 2 0) corresponds to the face centered cubic (fcc) Ni3Fe MANPs. The XRD pattern indicates that the bimetallic Ni3Fe MANPs are in the alloyed phase as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The sample exhibits three main diffraction peaks at (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) with fcc crystal structure which is in good agreement with the reported data (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, JCPDS card no. 38–0419) [42,43]. Especially, the reflection peak (1 1 1) exhibits a broader diffraction peak which suggests that the sample contains the presence of smaller crystallite size. Scherrer equation was used to estimate the average crystallite size of the Ni3Fe MANPs. The obtained catalyst showed an average crystallite size of 20 nm with a lattice constant of 0.3443 nm which is in accordance with the Pm-3 m space group of the ordered Ni3Fe intermetallic compound (standard lattice parameter: 0.3545 nm). Also, no additional peak was observed in the XRD pattern which indicates the formation of a highly pure Ni3Fe alloy. The magnetic properties of the Ni3Fe MANPs were determined via vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature in an external magnetic field ranging from − 20 kOe to + 20 kOe. Generally, magnetic properties of the chemically prepared nanostructured magnetic alloys suffer dramatic changes than bulk alloys due to variations in the domain structure [39,36]. Evidently, at the nanometer scale, the dipolar interactions, crystal packing density and magnetic anisotropy energy play critical roles resulting in the transition to a single domain regime. A low coercivity (Hc) and high saturation magnetization (Ms) are the characteristic features of the magnetic alloy nanoparticles. Fig. 3(b) shows the hysteresis loop of the Ni3Fe MANPs carried out at room temperature with applied magnetic field sweeping from − 20 to 20 kOe. Clearly, the figure indicates a typical ferromagnetic behavior with coercivity (Hc) of 103.0 Oe and saturation magnetization (Ms) of 78 emu g−1. The hysteresis curve of the Ni3Fe MANPs shows a symmetrical shape with higher saturation magnetization. Especially, Ni3Fe MANPs exhibits higher Ms which could be attributed to the larger uniform-sized single domain nanoparticles with negligible surface spin disorder [43]. The XPS analysis is an important technique to analyse the chemical structure of the as-prepared Ni3Fe MANPs. Fig. 3(c) shows the survey XPS spectra of Ni3Fe MANPs which confirm that the sample contains Fe, Ni, C elements and no other elements were detected in the survey spectra. The high resolution Fe 2p XPS spectra in inset Fig. 3c exhibited two intense peaks located at 707.2 eV and 724.3 eV can be given to Fe0 species of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. Thr high resolution Ni 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 3(d) showed the noticeable intense peaks at 853.1 eV and 870.5 eV corresponds to Ni0 species of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively. The analysis demonstrates that the solvothermal assisted wet-chemical co-reduction route is a suitable approach for the preparation of oxidation free metal alloy nanoparticles. Also, the preparation technique enabled the synthesis of controlled size of Ni3Fe catalyst particles at the atomic level which can efficiently tune the catalytic activity towards the hydrodeoxygenation of the bio-oil compounds."
8,Characterizations of feedstock materials,"3.2 Characterizations of feedstock materials The proximate and ultimate analysis of DS biomass is presented in Table S1. The proximate analysis of the DS biomass was performed in accordance with ASTM standard D5142-09. It was observed that the feedstock had a moisture content, volatile matter and ash-content of 6.02, 81.13 and 5.29 wt% respectively with a heating value of 20.27 MJ/kg. The O/C and H/C ratio was calculated to be 0.25 and 0.15 respectively. The lower moisture content, higher volatile matter and heating value ensured the suitability of biomass for pyrolysis, whilst the relatively high H/C values confirmed the ease of combustibility of date-seeds. The detrimental weight loss of the biomass during pyrolysis reaction was also analyzed using TG-DTA in the temperature range of 50–900 °C as shown in Fig. S-1. It was observed that TG-DTA indicated three-different degradation regimes in the temperature ranges of 50–170 °C, 180–550 °C and 450–900 °C corresponding to moisture removal, volatile matters (condensable gases) and non-condensable gases. TGA curve of DS shows a wider temperature range of 200–500 °C that could be related to the decomposition of lignocellulosic components in the DS sample making it difficult to differentiate between hemicellulose and cellulose decomposition zones. However, the lignocellulosic composition of biomass could be inferred indirectly by analyzing the products from the thermal decomposition of the biomass. As shown in Fig. S-1, a weight loss of 7.9% was observed in the initial temperature range 100–200 °C while a weight loss of 71.3% was observed in temperature range 200–500 °C. DTG pattern showed two distinct peaks in the range of 100–200 °C and 250–350 °C which corresponded to hemi-cellulosic content and overlapped cellulose and lignin content respectively. The results indicated that DS sample contained about 8 wt% of hemicellulose and about 70 wt% of lignin-cellulose content. The predominant amount of lignin and cellulose with significant concentration of hemicellulose in the DS feed indicated that pyrolysis products would major contain simple oxygenates such as acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones (obtained from the disintegration of cellulose and hemicellulose) as well as phenolic constituents (derived from lignin decomposition). TG-DTA data confirmed the potential aspects of date-seeds biomass for the production of bio-oil using the pyrolysis technique. However, the actual yield of biochar, bio-oil, and biogases depends on the reactor configuration and operation conditions of the pyrolysis process."
9,Chemical properties of fresh DS bio-oil and upgraded pyrolysis-oil,"3.3 Chemical properties of fresh DS bio-oil and upgraded pyrolysis-oil The DS bio-oil yield from the pyrolysis conversion process was maximized by varying the experimental parameters. A maximum bio-oil yield of 66 wt% was obtained at 500 °C operating temperature, 30 min operation time, 200 g feedstock loading and 10 mL min−1 carrier gas flow rate. In order to convert fresh DS Py-oil into transportation fuel and enhance its stability, HDO is a suitable method for reducing oxygen content in the Py-oil. This was achieved by reacting the oxygenated molecules with hydrogen using Ni3Fe metallic hybrid catalyst as schematically demonstrated in Fig. 1. The heterogeneous catalytic HDO process mainly involved the cleavage of CO and CO functional bonds of the acids, alcohols, esters, aldehydes and ketones of both aliphatic and aromatic constituents of the Py-oil, while the retaining the original length of carbon chain or dissociation/association of the CC linkages. HDO was effected on all range of carbon chains starting with simplest acetic acid to a larger carbon chain molecules such as D-glucose, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural and 2-Furaldehyde in addition to phenolic constituents such as M−Creosol. Further, the fresh DS Py-oil and HDO Py-oil were subjected to various physio-chemical characterization analyses, including density, viscosity, HHV, moisture content and total organic carbon (TOC) as presented in Table 1 . As can be seen from the various proximate and ultimate analyses, catalytic upgradation phenomena had a considerable effect on fresh DS Py-oil properties. In particular, the upgraded HDO Py-oil possessed lesser density (681 ± 0.05 kg/m3) and viscosity at 25 °C (0.8512 cP) than the fresh DS Py-oil and other upgraded bio-oils due to the formation of new by-products via reduction of the oxygenated macromolecules. HDO Py-oil showed a higher HHV value of 36.78 MJ kg−1 which was 30% higher than fresh DS Py-oil. The above results confirmed that the obtained fresh DS Py-oil was successfully upgraded via the HDO process in the presence of Ni3Fe catalyst. It was also found that the upgraded bio-oil sample exhibited similar properties and thus, may be effectively used as transportation fuels. Further refinement in the upgradation process could result in the extraction of specific compounds from HDO Py-oil."
10,Characterizations of catalytically upgraded Py-oil,"3.4 Characterizations of catalytically upgraded Py-oil 3.4.1 FTIR and elemental analysis FTIR analysis was performed to categorize the specific functional groups of the initial and final products in the fresh Py-oil and upgraded HDO Py-oil. Fig. 4 a shows the FTIR spectrum of freshly prepared Py-oil exhibiting five major functional compounds. The broad and high intense stretching vibration of OH group in the range of 3150–3500 cm−1 specifies the presence of alcohol group [44]. Also, a small number of alkanes could be recognized in the range of 2845–3000 cm−1 associated with CH stretching vibrations. The small intense carbonyl band (CO) at 1720 cm−1 specified the presence of a small number of carboxylic acids, ester, aldehydes, and ketones in the fresh Py-oil. The stretching vibration of the skeletal CC in aromatic rings and α, β-unsaturated ketone in the ranges of 1385–1649 cm−1 could be attributed to the lignin-derived components present in the samples [45]. The strong vibrations in the range of 1050–1200 cm−1 correspond to CO (stretch) of alcohol. Thus, the freshly prepared date seed derived Py-oil contains the major compounds of alcohol, skeletal CC in aromatic carbon, and a small amount of carboxylic acids, ester, aldehydes, and ketones [2,33,44–45]. Fig. 4b shows the FT-IR spectrum of upgraded HDO Py-oil in the presence of Ni3Fe hybrid catalysts. All the FT-IR spectrums confirm that the upgraded HDO Py-oil exhibited six final products including a small amount of alcohol, aromatic, alkene and methoxy and carbonyl groups. The strong and high intense bands at 2845–3000 cm−1 and 1650–1780 cm−1 correspond to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibration of CH and stretching vibration of CO respectively [33,45]. Moreover, upgraded HDO Py-oil exhibited less intense peaks at 3150–3500 cm−1, 1385–1649 cm−1, 1050–1200 cm−1 and 675–750 cm−1 that could be due to the stretching vibration of OH, stretching vibration of the skeletal CC in aromatic rings, stretching vibration of C-O and bending vibration of CH (alkene) respectively [44]. Interestingly, all the upgraded bio-oils exhibit high intense band of methoxyl groups (CH) at a frequency range of 2845–3000 cm−1 with an additional methyl and methylene bending vibration at 1379 and 1468 cm−1 due to presence of certain amounts of alkyl groups in the HDO Py-oil. The absorbance of these CH intense peaks is much greater in the upgraded bio-oils than fresh DS Py-oil due to deoxygenation and hydrocracking of the macromolecules, leading to the formation of straight-chain compounds. Meanwhile, a high intense CO band was observed in the upgraded bio-oils than fresh DS Py-oil, which indicates the presence of ketones, aldehydes and esters due to dehydration reaction during the upgradation process. Especially, the HDO Py-oil sample displays relatively higher intense bands of CH than CO. This indicates that Ni3Fe metallic alloy catalysts were deeply involved in the deoxygenation and hydrocracking of Py-oil at an upgradation temperature of 250 °C and 120 min of operation time. Furthermore, CO stretching vibration peaks between 1050 and 1200 cm−1, confirm that alcohols, phenols, and esters are present in the upgraded bio-oils. The enhancement of peak intensities of CH, CO and CO groups confirmed that Ni3Fe hybrid catalysts were successfully involved in the deoxygenation and hydrocracking of Py-oil during upgradation process. Moreover, results for the elemental analysis of the fresh and HDO Py-oil are presented in Table S-2. The results showed significant increase in hydrogen wt% by 3.17% with a substantial decrease in oxygen wt% by 5.97%. Additionally, the carbon wt% was also increased by 2.89% which was due to formation of new compounds in the HDO Py-oil. Results clearly showed the effect of hydro-deoxygenation in the upgraded Py-oil facilitated by the Ni3Fe catalyst. The Van Krevelen diagram for the fresh and HDO Py-oil is also presented in Figure S-2 which showed a 47.3% drop in O/C value along with 19.1% increase in H/C value. This trend exhibited the enhanced fuel standard for the HDO Py-oil with improved stability owing to the deoxygenation effects. 3.4.2 GC–MS analysis The qualitative chemical identification of various compounds present in the fresh and HDO Py-oil was performed through the GC–MS technique. The GC–MS analysis serves to be a reliable methodology for the initial assessment of various chemical compounds present in the bio-oil. Both large and small molecular weight products go through the same phenomena in GC–MS. The gas chromatographic analysis was performed to the fresh and upgraded py-oil in order to assess the initial and final concentrations of various compounds (on categorical basis) present in the oil, based on which the py-oil conversion, HDO yield and catalyst selectivity were evaluated. The chromatograms obtained by the GC–MS analysis for the fresh and HDO Py-oil are presented in Figure S-3. Fresh Py-oil obtained by the pyrolysis of the DS powder was a highly complex oxygenated organic product. The oil showed more density, opacity, and viscosity due to various functional compounds present in the samples. Upgraded Py-oil, the desirable HDO product, was of less dense and viscous nature with better transparency and smoky odor. The wt% compositions of different kinds of functional compounds detected in the fresh and HDO upgraded Py-oil are presented in Fig. 5 . In order to have better insight into the compositional structure of the bio-oil and the effect of the HDO process on the bio-oil, the components of Py-oil were categorized into four major groups as oxygenated compounds (including acids), hydrocarbons (straight-chain and cyclic), phenolic compounds and aldehydes & ketones. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the fresh Py-oil is largely composed of oxygenated products and less amount of hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis of the DS powder involved mainly the depolymerization and disintegration of the lignocellulosic biomass which were oxygen-containing organic polymers. This resulted in simple oxygenates such as alcohols, acids and esters followed with miscellaneous oxygenates of aldehydes and ketones. Phenolic constituents of the pristine Py-oil, usually obtained from the lignin decomposition, were almost equivalent to that of aldehydes and ketones composition [46]. The hydrocarbon portion of the fresh bio-oil was relatively less making it unsuitable for application. In addition, the thermodynamic instability of the fresh oil also leads to compositional changes, especially during the oil storage, which hampers the hydrocarbon availability in the oil. The predominant constituents of the bio-oil, as analyzed through GC–MS measurements are presented in Table 2 for both the raw and upgraded Py-oil. For fresh Py-oil, it can be seen that the major of the compounds were oxygenated compounds (58.07 wt%) in which Acetic acid, D-Glucose (Allose), 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, 2-Cyclopenten-1-one, 2-hydro and Maltol were present predominately. These products are usually obtained from the thermal depolymerization of hemicellulose fractions which indicated that the DS biomass was mostly composed of hemicellulosic components. Significant composition of aldehydes and ketones (15.83 wt%) such as 2-Furaldehyde and 2,3-Butanedione can also be ascribed to the cellulose content present in the DS biomass. Phenolic constituents such as M−Creosol, Catechol and 2,6-dimethoxy-Phenol which totally attributed to 14.08 wt% were obtained from the decomposition of lignin content of the biomass. A relatively smaller amount of hydrocarbons (12.02 wt%) was estimated in the fresh Py-oil which included straight-chain and cyclic compounds in addition to aromatics. Bio-oil enrichment was performed through HDO treatment of the raw Py-oil using the transition element based bi-metallic Ni3Fe catalyst. The basic principle of HDO mechanism consists of cleavage of the CO bond retaining the carbon chain length and elimination of oxygen, mostly as water. Recent trends in HDO of bio-mass derived Py-oil focuses on low temperature (<523 K) deoxygenation reactions using a high hydrogen pressure which results in better HDO performance. The results for the composition of HDO treated Py-oil at 250 °C and 10 bar H2 pressure is shown in Fig. 5(b) and Table 2. It can be seen that the hydrocarbon content of the HDO Py-oil was significantly improved to 23.79 wt% which is about 11.77% increase. The better solubility of hydrogen into the liquid bio-oil owing to the high gas pressure and catalytic activity caused the hydrogenation of various complex oxygenated compounds of Py-oil. This resulted in the higher composition of the hydrocarbons in the HDO product oil. For instance, compounds of heptadecane and Tridecane in the Py-oil showed improvement in weight composition after the HDO treatment while the presence of new saturated hydrocarbons such as methylcyclohexane and ethane with lower carbon chains was also identified in the HDO Py-oil. At the same time, the reduction in the composition of Phenolic compounds and aldehydes & ketones clearly showed the deoxygenation effect of the Ni3Fe catalyst due to CO and CO bonds breakdown [46]. Phenolic components were reduced by 10.52% while the aldehydes & ketones were lowered by 8.47% which indicated the selectivity of the Ni3Fe catalyst for CO than CO [47]. The increased amount of oxygenated compounds in the HDO Py-oil is due to the formation of several new compounds, as shown in Table 2, due to associated cracking, alkylation, reforming and isomerization reactions of the complex HDO reaction chemistry. These new compounds are mostly favorable oxygenates which ensured the stability and combustibility of the upgraded Py-oil. In particular, the formation of new oxygenates such as ethyl tridecanoate, ethyl acetate, furfuryl alcohol and 1, 5 Pentanediol increases the combustibility of the HDO py-oil elevating it to transportation fuel standards. 3.4.3 HDO mechanism for model compounds of Py-oil Fundamental knowledge on the mechanism of HDO process is very crucial to study the reaction kinetics and site requirements of the catalyst. This, in turn, forms the basis for industrial scale-up of the HDO process, both on batch and continuous-flow modes. Although the reaction chemistry of bio-oil hydrotreatment is very complex, attempts were made to study the plausible mechanism for desirable model components of the oil. This rational approach provides a better insight into the catalytic performance and optimization of the HDO treatment to a significant level. The basic step in HDO mechanism for any oxygenated component is the cleavage of the C-O bond for oxygen elimination [47]. Studies have clearly shown that the dissociation energy for aliphatic-oxygen bond (R-OR or R-OH) is considerably lower than the aromatic-oxygen bond (Ar-OR or Ar-OH). This implies an easy deoxygenation possibility for an aliphatic-oxygen bond, especially at low-temperature treatment. In the case of an aromatic-oxygen bond, a hydrogenation step prefixes the deoxygenation step to convert the aromatic ring to the cyclic ring leading to R-O formation which is subsequently broken down. Also, a low-temperature hydrotreatment would easily saturate the double bonds in acids, ketones, aldehydes and olefins whereas a very high temperature would be required for the complete elimination of phenolic and furanic oxygenated compounds. This was very much evident from the results obtained and shown in Table 2. The total reduction in wt% for the simple oxygenated compounds which underwent hydro-deoxygenation was 26.37% as compared to the 10.52% of total reduction for the analyzed phenolic constituents of the Py-oil. Considering all these facts, the following molecules such as acetic acid, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, D-Glucose, M−Creosol and 2-Furaldehyde were selected as model molecules to study the specific HDO mechanism on the Ni3Fe catalyst surface. Additionally, the conversion (X) percentages of the acetic acid, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, D-Glucose, M−Creosol and 2-Furaldehyde were estimated to be 54.65, 36.27, 59.2, 75.42, and 43.45%, respectively by using Eq (2). The acetic acid was obtained as the major component (~18 wt%) in the Py-oil. These simple carboxylic acids which impart the corrosive nature to the bio-oil, have to effectively be hydrotreated to elevate the product oil to the standards of transportation fuel. Many researchers have studied the hydrogenation of acetic acid using oxide and noble metal catalysts at higher HDO temperatures [48,49]. A substantial reduction of acetic acid (~45% conversion) in the current investigation clearly proved that the transition metal-based bi-metallic Ni3Fe catalyst was very effective for the HDO of acetic acid. The postulated reaction pathway for acetic acid conversion to more stable products such as ethane and ethyl acetate is presented in Fig. 6 a1. The mechanism starts with reaction with dissociatively adsorbed H2 and the acyl group of the acid causing the CO cleavage to reducing the acid to aldehyde with the elimination of water molecule. The as-formed acetaldehyde product on the catalyst surface is unstable and undergoes hydrogenation to form ethyl alcohol. The acidic nature of the intermediate complex mixture coupled with the catalyst functionality further promotes the dehydration of the ethanol to form ethylene as well as the formation of ethyl acetate via esterification between excess acetic acid and intermediate ethanol [49,50]. Ethane was obtained as a secondary stable product due to the high pressure of HDO process favoring the hydrogenation of unsaturated ethylene to saturated ethane. In general, the stability and rank of a product are determined as a function of catalyst selectivity and reaction time. Under prescribed reaction conditions, products such as acetaldehyde and ethanol were quite unstable for Ni3Fe catalyst which led to their conversion as ethyl acetate and ethane. Similarly, hydrotreatment of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to produce 2,5-Dimethylfurfural (DMF) is a highly desirable and potential step of HDO due to the high energy density and fuel compatibility of DMF [51]. In recent times, DMF is regarded as a better fuel additive equivalent to ethanol in the case of fuel bending operations. Conversion of HMF to DMF using non-noble bimetallic catalysts such as Co-Cu and Cu-Ni has been reported by other research works. The mechanism for HMF upgradations to DMF involves hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of alcohol and carbonyl groups as illustrated in Fig. 6a2. The first step of the reaction pathway involves the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxyl group of HMF at the catalyst surface to produce 5-methyfurfural (MFF) through CO cleavage and water removal. The activation energy for HMF conversion to MFF is very low activation energy (54.8 kJ/mol) preferably around 200 °C than another possible intermediate 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) [52]. Added, the formation of MFF from HMF ensures a better production of DMF than the DHMF pathway. Subsequent to MFF synthesis, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is activated by Lewis acid sites of Ni3Fe catalyst and further hydrogenation result in the formation of 5-methyl,2-furfuryl alcohol (MFA). Finally, DMF was obtained through hydrodeoxygenation of MFA due to the synergistic contribution from the bi-metallic catalyst activity and acidic nature of the reaction mixture. Moreover, pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass produces biogenic carbohydrates such as D-glucose, D-allose etc. which could be suitably upgraded to produce a wide range of carbon-based chemicals. Specifically, D-sorbitol obtained by hydrogenation of D-glucose is a very promising material for biofuel production as well as the synthesis of a large number of platform chemicals. Successful conversion of D-glucose to D-sorbitol under aqueous phase condition is highly dependent on the catalytic selectivity and operating parameters (such as temperature and pressure) of the HDO process. The postulated reaction route for hydrogenation of D-glucose to D-sorbitol is shown in Fig. 6a3. D-glucose in aqueous phase exists both in aldose and ketose open-chain networks. The aldose form of D-glucose is more preferentially adsorbed on metal catalyst surface through the carbonyl configuration (CO) [53]. Subsequently, hydrogenation of the aldehyde group through carbonyl scission results in the formation of D-sorbitol. The existence of D-glucose in cyclic pyranose form in case of aqueous phase leads to side reactions during the hydrogenation process. These side-products such as D-fructose and D-mannose can further lead to the isomerization of D-sorbitol to D-mannitol [54,55]. The selectivity of the catalyst along with its structural integrity and resistance to deactivation plays a critical role in the successful hydrogenation of D-glucose to D-sorbitol, suppressing the undesired polymerization and isomerization side reactions. The better yield of D-sorbitol in the HDO treatment of DS Py-oil than D-mannitol exhibited the sterically favorable Ni3Fe catalytic surface for the hydrogenation of aldose conformer of D-glucose than the ketose form. On the other hand, phenolic compounds are usually produced in the pyrolysis of biomass due to the lignin content of the feedstock and aromatization/condensation of simple oxygenates formed during the process. Deoxygenation of these phenolic compounds present in the bio-oil with the constraint of carbon retention makes the oil upgradation step more challenging. In this reported work, m-Cresol was obtained as the predominant phenolic compound during the pyrolysis of DS powder. The catalytic HDO treatment of the m-Cresol to result in methylcyclohexane is schematically presented in Fig. 6b. The initial step of m-Cresol hydrotreatment involves the tautomerization of m-Cresol methylcyclohexadienone which is a highly unstable intermediate form [56]. This dienone is quickly adsorbed on the metallic catalyst with the aromatic ring anchorage to undergo hydrogenation. The strong affinity of Nickel for the aromatic ring (CC) favors the planar adsorption of the intermediate and its subsequent saturation to form 3-methylcyclcohexanone. Following the aromatic ring saturation, hydrogenation of the unsaturated carbonyl group takes place leading to the synthesis of 3-methyl cyclohexanol. This saturated alcohol then undergoes dehydration due to the sufficient acidity of the catalyst induced by the Lewis acid sites resulting in the formation of methylcyclohexane. HDO upgradation of DS Py-oil under the prescribed conditions resulted in a synthesis of 1.28 wt% of methylcyclohexane from m-Cresol, which was not originally present in the fresh Py-oil. In the case of a bifunctional catalyst, this methylcyclohexane could further be dehydrogenated to form toluene [57]. Furthermore, 2-Furaldehyde (commercially known as Furfural) is one of the top-ranked chemicals for the synthesis of a wide range of commodity chemicals and fuel substitutes. The 2-Furaldehyde or furfural (FUR) is usually produced at a substantial level during the pyrolysis of lingo-cellulosic biomass. Selective separation of FUR and its subsequent conversion to commercial products such as Furfuryl alcohol, Levulinic acid, γ-Valerolactone, Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 1,5-Pentanediol, 2-Methyl furan, Cyclopentanone etc. has been reported by several research works [58]. In this work, upgradation of 2-Furaldehyde content in the fresh Py-oil using HDO route resulted in new products such as Furfuryl alcohol (FOL), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and 1,5-Pentanediol (PDO) in the enriched Py-oil [59]. The reaction pathway for the sequential conversion of FUR into FOL succeeded with THFA and finally, PDO is shown in Fig. 6c. The conversion starts with the adsorption of FUR on the catalyst site with the horizontal orientation of the furan ring on the metal surface. This creates a polarity in the aldehyde group of the compound favoring the hydrogenation of the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group to form a hydroxyalkyl intermediate. The electron craving carbon then undergoes hydrogenation converting the intermediate into FOL [59]. The relative stability of FOL usually prevents it from further hydrodeoxygenation. However, depending on the catalytic functionality and process conditions, it can undergo further hydrogenation to generate THFA. As highlighted before, the strong affinity between Ni metal and the furan ring anchors the FOL persistently on the catalyst surface. The lower activation energy for CC saturation on the metallic catalyst and high availability of dissociative H2 aids the furan ring saturation and produces THFA. Due to weak attraction between the Group VIII metals (Ni in this case) and saturated carbon ring, the as-formed THFA tends to desorb into the bulk phase. However, the availability of acid sites on the catalyst promotes the further hydrogenolysis of THFA to PDO. The proton transfer caused by the acid sites in the vicinity of catalyst prompts the ring-opening pursued with the displacement of the hydrogen atom of CH2OH group from α-position to the β-position. Hydrogenation of this resultant protonated aldehyde results in the PDO evolution. As shown in Table 2, HDO of DS Py-oil produced 3.22, 1.1 and 3.43 wt% of FOL, THFA, and PDO from an initial 13.01 wt% of FUR. The results show the multi-selectivity of Ni3Fe catalysts to produce FOL from FUR and PDO from THFA. All these products obtained from FUR have significant contribution in enriching the HDO Py-oil to transportation fuel grade. Thus, the HDO mechanisms described for the model molecules viz. acetic acid, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, D-Glucose, M−Creosol and 2-Furaldehyde which involved various chemical reactions such as deoxygenation, hydrogenation, oxidation, dehydration, hydration etc. provided an overall idea on the HDO mechanism of the DS Py-oil. These model compounds attributed to a total weight of 55.62 wt% of the fresh Py-oil and thus envisaging their HDO mechanism could be projected as the dominant mechanism for the upgradtion of complete Py-oil."
11,Reusability studies,"3.5 Reusability studies The reusability and catalyst stability are the key features for the industrial implementation of bimetallic Ni3Fe nanocatalysts. Presence of wide range of organic compounds in the fresh Py-oil and the complex HDO chemistry associated with each of them led to examine the reusability nature of the catalyst based on 2-Furaldehyde (FUR) as the probe molecule. Additionally, FUR being an essential intermediate precursor for biofuel upgrading and fine organic synthesis, made it as a suitable model molecule for the catalyst reusability and stability analysis. The catalyst reusability studies were performed over five consecutive cycles on the conversion of FUR in the fresh Py-oil at the prescribed experimental conditions. Results obtained for the reusability studies are as depicted in Fig. 7 a. As can be seen from Fig. 7(a), the FUR conversion efficiency over Ni3Fe nanocatalyst was found to decrease from 43.5% to 41% after 5 consecutive cycles. Specifically, the catalyst showed almost a constant conversion efficiency of FUR for the first three runs, with a very minimal reduction in conversion efficiency for the fourth and fifth cycles. The marginal drop in the conversion efficiency of FUR is ascribed to the detachment of catalytic active sites to the reaction and the formation of the oxidation layers on the surfaces of the catalyst after repeated washing and drying processes. Catalyst selectivity is another important parameter which determines its commercial success. Fig. 6(a) depicts the selectivity of the bimetallic Ni3Fe catalyst for the products FOL, THFA and PDO obtained during the HDO of 2-Furaldehyde. It can be seen that the Ni3Fe catalyst had the highest selectivity for PDO followed with FOL and THFA in the hydrodeoxygenation of FUR. Also, the selectivity of the catalyst reminded constant for all the products after several cycles. The consistent selectivity of the catalyst highlighted its stability in the successive HDO treatment of bio-oils. Thus, the well-retained conversion efficiency coupled with its persistent product selectivity exhibited the better reusability of the as-prepared Ni3Fe catalyst and its potential for industrial applications due to its well-defined octagon-like morphology which presented a better catalytic activity and HDO performance for bio-oil upgradation. Besides, the morphological, structural, and magnetic analysis of post-reaction catalysts were examined by SEM, X-ray diffractometer and VSM analysis at room temperature. The clear SEM image of the post-reaction Ni3Fe nanocatalyst showed a well-defined octagon-like morphology without agglomeration of the individual nanoparticles as depicted in Fig. 7(b). This highlighted the structural integrity of the prepared catalyst after several HDO cycles. This highlighted the structural integrity of the prepared catalyst after several HDO cycles. The XRD analysis is used to investigate the structural changes of the post-reaction catalyst and annealed catalyst. As illustrated XRD pattern of the post-reaction catalyst in Fig. 7(c), there are main crystalline phases of Ni3Fe and secondary crystalline phases of Fe3O4 due to mild surface oxidation of catalyst during HDO process. The attributed X-ray diffraction angles at 44.0°, 51.3°, and 75.6° which can be well indexed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes respectively corresponded to the fcc crystalline structure of Ni3Fe (PDF# 38–0419) [39]. The secondary crystalline phase of cubic spinel structure of Fe3O4 exhibited the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 35.7°, 57.5°, 63.1° and 87.2° corresponding to the miller indices of (3 1 1), (5 1 1), (4 4 0), and (6 4 2), respectively [60]. The mild oxidation layer of the Fe3O4 on Ni3Fe prevent the further oxidation of the core catalyst under air atmosphere. Further, the post reaction Ni3Fe sample was thermally annealed at 250 °C for 4 h under H2 atmosphere. The annealed Ni3Fe sample showed the diffraction angles at 44.0°, 51.1°, and 75.3° which can be well indexed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of fcc Ni3Fe without any metal oxides phases, thus indicating the successful removal of oxidation leayer on the surfaces of post-reaction catalyst. This annealing process can maintain the catalytic performance of the Ni3Fe catalyst. Fig. 7(d) depicts the magnetic hysteresis analysis of the post-reaction Ni3Fe catalyst carried out at room temperature. VSM measurement was performed with an applied magnetic field sweeping from − 20 to 20 kOe. The obtained hysteresis loop showed the ferromagnetic nature of Ni3Fe bimetallic catalyst with saturation magnetization (Ms) of 50 emu g−1. The inset Fig. 7d shows the enlarged hysteresis curve for the estimation of the coercivity (Hc) for the post-reaction catalyst. The Hc value of the spent form was 510 Oe which was higher than the Hc value (110 Oe) of the pristine form of the Ni3Fe bimetallic catalyst. The enhanced Hc value of the post-reaction catalyst could be related to the following aspects: (1) insertion of the oxygen atoms on the surfaces of Ni3Fe catalyst due to HDO effect, (2) formation of the Fe3O4 shell on the surfaces of Ni3Fe catalyst during washing and calcination processes, (3) coupling and spatial confinement effect between Fe3O4 shell and Ni3Fe core, and (4) interaction between the Py-oil components and the catalytic surface. On the other hand, the obtained stable oxidation layers of Fe3O4 on the Ni3Fe prevent the further oxidation of catalytic active sites which resulted in better stability of the post-reaction catalyst. Prior to the recyclability test, the oxidation layers was easily reduced into pure mettalic state of Ni3Fe to maintain their catalytic performance toward upgradation of Py-oil. Thus, it is concluded that a well-defined octagon-like Ni3Fe is a cost-effective bimetallic nanocatalyst for the upgrading of Py-oil causes to enhanced the biofuel quality."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, a cost-effective octagon-like bimetallic Ni3Fe nanocatalyst was developed for upgrading Py-oil derived from date seeds towards the production of biofuels. A solvothermal assisted co-reduction method was used for the preparation of Ni3Fe NPs with an average diameter in the ranges of 120 nm. The hysteresis analysis showed that the Ni3Fe NPs possess a good crystallinity with higher Ms of 75 emu g−1 and lower Hc of 110 Oe. Pyrolysis of date seeds was carried out at 500 °C for 30 min under Nitrogen atmosphere. Subjecting the Py-oil to HDO treatment upgraded the product-oil to transportation grade. In particular, the HHV value of the HDO Py-oil was increased from 29.06 to 36.78 MJ kg−1, while density, oxygen content, and viscosity were reduced from 1015 to 681 kg m−3, 28.5 to 7.3%, and 18.5 to 4.7 cSt respectively. FT-IR and GC–MS results demonstrated that the hydrocarbon content of the bio-oil increased from 12.021 to 23.787 wt%. Importantly, HDO of major Py-oil components such as acetic acid, 5 hydroxymethylfurfural, D-glucose, m-cresol and 2-furaldehyde resulted in the following products: (1) acetic acid was mainly converted into ethane and ethy1 acetate, (2) 5-hydroxymethyl furfural was hydrodeoxygenated into 2,5 methyl furan, (3) D-glucose was converted into D-sorbitol and D-mannitol, 4) m-Cresol was converted into methylcyclohexane, and 5) 2-furaldehyde was sequentially converted into furfural alcohol, tetrahydrofurfural alcohol, and 1,5-pentanediol, respectively. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited better reusability, stability and structural integrity for five cycles of Py-oil HDO treatment with a 97% retainment of FUR conversion efficiency. Future study scopes can include the effects of variation in HDO process parameters on the Ni3Fe catalyst performance and final product composition as well as establishment of detailed and specific reaction pathways for the HDO process based on experimental measurements of time profile for reaction intermediates. Thus, the bimetallic Ni3Fe nanocatalyst was found as an effective catalyst for the HDO treatment of Py-oil components with multi-functionality and a wide range of selectivity."
