0,Introduction,"Energy is a key factor in the economic and social developments of countries and it is the most important source of life in society and at every stage of life. Rapid population growth and industrialization in developing countries have caused more increase in demand for energy. Moreover, it plays important role in human health, comfort and in the use of technology. For these reasons, it is among the priority policies of the governments [1,2]. It is well known that the utilization of petroleum has the greatest share of the all energy resources and it has been widely used in the transportation sector, power plants, construction, agricultural applications and industrial activities [3–5]. According to International Energy Outlook, it is predicted that the energy needs of the world will rise by 53% in 2030 compared to 2005. Approximately 26–27% of this energy requirement will be obtained from fossil-based fuels worldwide [5,6]. However, coal, petroleum and natural gas reserves will come to an end for 218, 41 and 53 years, respectively according to the estimations [4]. Additionally, the continual increase in the fossil-based fuel prices, decline of known reserves over time, and environmental concerns related to the soil, water and air pollution have intensified calls to the alternative fuels [7]. Most of the vehicles used in the transportation sector around the world have diesel engines [8]. One of the most significant potential candidate fuels for compression ignition engines is biodiesel among the alternative fuels [9]. It has been reported that low emission profile, high cetane number, low sulphur content, high oxygen content, improving lubricity and biodegradability are the most important properties of biodiesel fuels [10,11]. Biodiesel fuels can be used in diesel engines with or without some minor modifications [12,13]. Biodiesel can be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, waste cooking oils, and algae oils that are chemically reacted with short chain alcohols (methanol, ethanol, etc.) and catalysts (NaOH, KOH, etc.) [14]. In recent years, the production and usage of biodiesel fuels has become increasingly widespread throughout the world. The countries have generally preferred edible vegetable oil sources grown in their countries. The most common feedstocks to be able to obtain biodiesel fuel are rapeseed and sunflower oils in Europe, soybean oil and waste vegetable oils in the USA and Canada, soybean oil in South America, palm, jatropha and coconut oils in Asia, palm and soybean oils in Australia, waste vegetable oil and animal fat in New Zealand [15]. Alcohols are liquid fuels that can be used in the internal combustion engines. Alcohols, served as a fuel additive, can be blended with certain proportions of petroleum-based diesel, biodiesel and diesel/biodiesel fuel blends [16,17]. At the same time, studies on the application of alcohol/diesel/biodiesel fuel blends have been included in the literature. It has been stated that the viscosity and surface tension of the fuel blends with alcohol addition decrease while the improvement of atomization and increasing oxygen content [16–18]. Also, alcohols are renewable fuels that can be acquired from biomass [19]. On the other hand, low heating value and cetane number, poor ignition quality, miscibility and stability issues of alcohols can restrict the usage in the diesel engine application [20]. The utilization of the alcohols as an additive component for the fuel blends is an important procedure in order to solve the source problem related to the fuels [21]. In these days, methanol and ethanol, which are lower carbon alcohols, have been researched as an alternative fuel for the diesel engines in the literature [22–29]. Butanol and pentanol are good fuel additives or attractive alternative fuels for apply in diesel engines. They have many advantages over lower carbon alcohols such as higher cetane number and heating value, lower heat of vaporization. Therefore, recent studies on the use of butanol and pentanol in diesel engines have increased [30–32]. Butyl alcohol, also called as n-butanol, n-butyl alcohol or butan-1-ol, is an alcohol that can be obtained from renewable resources. It is colorless, clear, and water-immiscible. Butanol has a moderate non-permanent odor. It has been used as a solvent in the plastic, cosmetic, paint, food sectors and mainly in the production of isobutyl acetate. Also, it can be added to the materials used against rust and wear. Butanol is a poisonous alcohol. It tends to burn. Heating value of butanol is less than diesel fuel and it can be used up to 40% in diesel fuel. Furthermore, the properties of butanol are very close to the diesel fuel [33–35]. Pentanol is also named as n-pentanol, n-amyl alcohol or pentan-1-ol. It can be produced from renewable raw materials. The cetane number and energy content of pentanol are higher than other alcohols. It can be used up to 45% by adding to diesel fuel [33,36]. There are many investigations about the analyze of engine performance, combustion, and exhaust emission characteristics of diesel engines fuelled with different fuels such as biodiesel, diesel, biodiesel/diesel fuel blends, alcohol/biodiesel blends, alcohol/diesel fuel blends, and alcohol/biodiesel/diesel fuel blends, etc. On the other hand, there have been limited numbers of studies on the use of butanol and pentanol in the diesel engines. Some of these studies were summarized as follows: Zhu et al. [17] analyzed the emission and combustion behaviors of four-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine fuelled with waste cooking oil biodiesel-pentanol blends. They detected that the beginning of the combustion and the crank angle at which maximum heat release occurs were removed from the top dead center, cylinder pressure and heat release rate were increased with the increasing the proportion of pentanol in the fuel blends. Although hydrocarbon (HC) and CO emissions of the fuel blends improved, NOX emissions worsened. Atmanli et al. [19] utilized n-butanol (as the common solvent) and crude canola, soybean, sunflower, corn, olive and hazelnut oils (as the vegetable oil components) for making micro-emulsification of vegetable oil-diesel fuel blends. 70% of diesel fuel, 20% of vegetable oil and 10% n-butanol blends were tested in a four-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged, direct-injection diesel engine at full load with various engine speeds. The experimental results demonstrated that brake torque, brake power, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), HC, and CO decreased while brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), NO, and CO increased as compared to those of diesel fuel. Imdadul et al. [20] added 10, 15 and 20% of tamanu oil biodiesel and pentanol into the diesel fuel and examined the engine performance and exhaust emissions of a single-cylinder, water cooled diesel engine running on test fuels. According to B20 fuel, BSFC value, smoke opacity, CO, HC and CO2 emissions of the alcohol blended fuels decreased by 8.7, 21.2, 33.1, 43.45 and 2.5%, respectively. However, the thermal efficiency, brake power and NO emission increased by 15, 10.4 and 4.4%, respectively. Imdadul et al. [21] produced biodiesel from tamanu oil via transesterification method and blended with conventional diesel fuel volumetrically as 15 and 20%. Afterwards, the butanol and pentanol with the ratios of 15 and 20% were added to mixed fuels. All of the test fuels were performed in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine. They determined that the alcohol additions reduced BSFC values compared to B15 and B20 fuels, increase brake power, NO and CO2 emissions, and decrease CO and HC emissions. Ibrahim [30] investigated the impacts of the butanol addition at ratios of 10 and 20% in the biodiesel-diesel fuel blends on the engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics of a single-cylinder diesel engine. The research indicated that the addition of up to 20% butanol can lead to tolerable variations in terms of engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics. On the other hand, they have found that the diesel engines for the usage of butanol need to be optimized and the change of fuel type did not have a significant effect on the combustion periods. Wei et al. [31] exposed that pentanol addition in diesel fuel can remarkably decrease particulate emissions and vaguely rise NOX emissions. Mehta et al. [32] reported that HC emission rises by adding n-butanol into the blends, while CO and smoke emissions decrease. Kumar and Saravanan [33] comprehensively reviewed the usage of higher alcohols (from 3-carbon propanol to 20-carbon phytol) in diesel engine applications. They indicated that the whole or partial replacement of diesel fuel with higher alcohols in the compression ignition engines were found to be generally successful due to the fact that higher alcohols decreased regulated emissions with improved efficiency. Yilmaz et al. [34] studied the influences of the butanol addition (5, 10 and 20%) in the waste cooking oil biodiesel on the performance and emission characteristics of an indirect injection diesel engine. It was determined that EGT and NOX emissions decreased with the addition of the butanol in comparison to biodiesel fuel, but CO and HC emissions increased. Also this BSFC values of fuel blends was measured higher than that of diesel fuel. Ozer [35] compared the engine performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine operating with diesel fuel by adding 3, 5, 8 and 10% butanol to the diesel fuel under different engine loads. As a result it has been stated that BSFC was increased due to the increase of the ratio of butanol in the fuel blends, while the thermal efficiency and EGT were decreased. Also he found that CO, NOX and smoke opacity reduced, although CO2 and HC emissions increased. Li et al. [36] performed the influence of pentanol addition to biodiesel and diesel fuels in different ratios on the emission and combustion characteristics of a single-cylinder, direct-injection diesel engine under various engine loads and 1600 rpm constant speed conditions. As a result of the experiments, 40% diesel-30% biodiesel-30% pentanol blend exhibited better combustion and emission data as well as economy performance. Keskin et al. [37] tested the diesel engine fuelled with two different fuel blends (60% diesel fuel+30% waste cooking oil biodiesel+5% ethanol+5% butanol and 40% diesel fuel+50% waste cooking oil biodiesel+5% ethanol+5% butanol). It is indicated that the engine torque and power values decreased with using fuel blends compared to the conventional diesel fuel. Additionally, they exhibited that NOX emissions slightly increased, however smoke opacity, CO and HC emissions decreased as 87.5, 87.01 and 57.14%, respectively. Sahin et al. [38] investigated the effects of n-butanol injection into the intake air of a diesel engine on the engine performance and exhaust emissions at different engine load. Consequently, 2% n-butanol spraying would be the optimum mixture ratio in terms of the engine characteristics and NOX emissions. At the same injection quantity, BSFC, smoke, and NOX emissions reduced as 0.58, 0.31 and 17.38%, respectively. On the other hand, they indicated that the thermal efficiency increased at a ratio of 1.01%. Tosun et al. [39] carried out experiments by adding 20% alcohols (methanol, ethanol and butanol) volumetrically into the biodiesel that was produced from groundnut oil. It was observed that the engine power increased by 2.4, 10 and 12.8% compared to the biodiesel in the experiments with methanol, ethanol and butanol addition fuels, and decreased by 26.36%, 20.85% and 18.91% respectively compared to diesel fuel. The engine torque values of methanol, ethanol and butanol blended fuels increased as 1.2%, 3.4% and 6.1%, respectively compared to the biodiesel, and decreased by 20.53%, 18.81% and 16.67%, respectively in comparison to the diesel fuel. In addition, CO emissions reduced with the alcohol blends, while NOX emissions increased. Atmanli [40] prepared fuel blends such as 50% diesel+50% biodiesel, 40% diesel+40% biodiesel+20% different alcohols (propanol, butanol and pentanol) and tested in a four-cylinder, naturally aspirated, indirect injection diesel engine under constant 1800 rpm engine speed and various engine loads (1, 3, 6 and 9 kW). The conclusion of the experiment showed that propanol, butanol and pentanol addition increased CO emission as 39.95, 38.83 and 12.60%, respectively, however NOX emissions decreased. Nanthagopal et al. [41] evaluated the effects of 1-pentanol and 1-butanol as additives with Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel on the diesel engine characteristics at different engine loads. They indicated that higher alcohol-biodiesel blends have shown lower BTE and higher BSFC. NOX decreased due to the cooling impact of higher alcohols, at the same time CO, HC and smoke emissions for all higher alcohol blended fuels. Babu and Anand [42] analyzed the performance, combustion and exhaust emission behaviors of diesel engine running on biodiesel/diesel/n-pentanol or n-hexanol blends without engine modification. They concluded that the performance and combustion were improved by adding higher alcohol into the biodiesel/diesel blends. Among the higher alcohol blended fuels, 85% biodiesel/5% diesel/10% pentanol fuel possessed the minimum CO, HC, and filter smoke number. Dhanasekaran et al. [43] investigated the effects of ternary blends of waste cooking oil biodiesel, diesel fuel and n-pentanol on the combustion, performance and emission characteristics in a stationary direct-injection diesel engine with and without exhaust gas recirculation. It can be concluded that ternary blends generated less NOX and smoke, however high HC and CO emissions. Also, they improved BSFC with n-pentanol addition according to B50 fuel. Atmanli et al. [44] suggested the ternary blend which containing 10% n-butanol/20% cotton oil/70% diesel fuel in order to satisfy the cold flow properties and it presented satisfactory engine performance and emission results. Celebi and Aydin [45] prepared binary blends of butanol/safflower oil biodiesel and ternary blends of butanol/safflower oil biodiesel/diesel fuel that were included 5%, 10, and 20% butanol in a volume basis. Afterwards, they were tested on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection diesel engine generator under the half load and constant speed of 1500 rpm. The ternary blends exhibited that the reductions on emissions were observed, higher BTE and BSFC compared to the diesel fuel were recorded up to 1.5% and 6%, respectively. The influences of the lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol addition into the diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, and diesel-biodiesel fuel blends on the engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics were investigated in detail by many researchers. There is a limited number of investigations of a diesel engine fuelled with butanol and pentanol addition into the diesel, biodiesel or diesel-biodiesel fuel blends, especially on theirs impacts on the combustion characteristics. Furthermore, as seen in the literature survey, it has not been examined the comparison of the engine performance, exhaust emissions, combustion characteristics of the diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel/diesel/1-butanol and biodiesel/diesel/n-pentanol fuel blends, in particular carried out on the same engine. Moreover, the additives of yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel in the ternary blends of diesel/biodiesel/alcohols blends have not been performed in the literature to the best of the author's knowledge. It is seen that yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel has not shown enough interest in all over the world. Further researches on this subject and the appropriate oilseed crops for the biodiesel industry are required. For these reasons, the present study is conducted in order to fulfill this gap in the literature. The aim of the present study is to perform the 1-butanol and n-pentanol addition into the biodiesel-diesel fuel blends and to investigate elaborately and deeply the engine performance (such as torque, power, BSFC, BTE, etc.), exhaust emissions (such as CO, CO2, NOX, etc.) and combustion behaviors (such as in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate) of a single cylinder, four-stroke, water cooled, direct-injection diesel engine. Also, the experimental results of 1-butanol and n-pentanol blended fuels were compared to the diesel fuel's results and with each other."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biodiesel production and preparation of test fuels,"2.1 Biodiesel production and preparation of test fuels In this study, the biodiesel fuel was produced from yellow mustard (Sinapis alba L.) seed oil via the single stage homogenous catalyst transesterification process in the small-scale and PLC controlled biodiesel production facility in the Biofuel Laboratory, Bozok University, Yozgat, Turkey. Methanol (32.04 g/mol, 99.8% of purity), which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA), was used as an alcohol. NaOH (40 g/mol, ≥97% of purity), which was taken from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), was preferred as a catalyst. In the transesterification reaction, alcohol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time were selected as 7.407:1, 0.627%, 61.8 °C, and 62.1 min, respectively. The reaction was realized under the optimum reaction conditions [46]. The reaction procedure, steps and biodiesel production facility were explained in our latest study by Eryilmaz and Yesilyurt [47]. The conventional diesel fuel were procured from a local petrol station in Yozgat, Turkey. 1-butanol (74.12 g/mol, ≥99% of purity) and n-pentanol (88.15 g/mol, ≥99% of purity) used in the fuel blends were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. The prepared samples were designated as ED (100% diesel fuel), B (yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel), Bt (1-butanol), P (n-pentanol), B2Bt5 (93% ED+2% B+5% Bt), B2B10 (88% ED+2% B+10% Bt), B20Bt5 (75% ED+20% B+5% Bt), B20Bt10 (70% ED+20% B+10% Bt), B2P5 (93% ED+2% B+5% P), B2P10 (88% ED+2% B+10% P), B20P5 (75% ED+20% B+5% P), and B20P10 (70% ED+20% B+10% P). The test fuels were stored in the in glass bottles with screw caps in the dark medium in order to avoid phase separation. Also, the fuel blends were homogenized prior to the experiments."
3,Fatty acid composition,2.2 Fatty acid composition The fatty acid composition of yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel was measured by using Agilent 6890 N network gas chromatography system combined with Agilent 5975C VL MSD network mass selective detector and HP Innowax capillary column of 60.0 m × 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm. The measuring procedure and detailed properties of gas chromatography system was found in our previous study [47].
4,Fuel characterization,"2.3 Fuel characterization The most important fuel specifications of the test fuels were measured according to the standards in the Biofuel Laboratory, Bozok University, Yozgat, Turkey. The technical properties of the fuel characterization test devices were given in Table 1 ."
5,Experimental apparatus,"2.4 Experimental apparatus Engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristic tests were carried out on engine test bed in Automotive Laboratory, Technical Sciences Vocational School Automotive Program, Aksaray University, Aksaray, Turkey. Technical specifications of the test engine, hydraulic dynamometer and measuring devices, and exhaust gas analyzers were presented in Table 2 . Extech brand HD600 model data logging sound level meter with a sensitivity of ±1.4 dBA and a measurement range of 30–130 dBA was used to measure the noise values during engine operations. The sound level meter was placed at a distance of about 1 m from the test engine and measured at all engine speeds. Extech brand HD600 model data logging sound level meter with a sensitivity of ±1.4 dBA and a measurement range of 30–130 dBA was used to measure the noise values during engine operations. The sound level meter was placed at a distance of about 1 m from the test engine and measured at all engine speeds. The technical characteristics of the measuring equipment used in the combustion analysis were also given in Table 2. The schematic view of the engine test bed were represented in Fig. 1 ."
6,Test methodology,"2.5 Test methodology The calibrations of the used apparatus were ensured before beginning the tests and pre-tests were carried out to determine the engine operating conditions. After the pre-tests, the engine stabilization time was detected so that the engine was stabilized for all of the test fuels. After all the deficiencies encountered in the pre-tests were eliminated, the main testing process was realized. The ambient temperature was found to be at 25 °C during the tests. Diesel fuel was tested as a reference fuel. The engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics of diesel engine fuelled with test fuels were achieved under 1000–3200 rpm engine speeds and full load operating conditions. The cylinder pressure was measured in each work cycle up to 720oCA for each 1oCA intervals at 1400 and 2600 rpm engine speeds. Because the maximum engine torque and brake power were found to be at 1400 and 2600 rpm, respectively. Furthermore, the average cylinder pressures of the test fuels were measured after applying Savitzky-Golay filtering method for at least 50 cycles. The increase in the internal energy during combustion and the net heat release rate (HRR) that turns into mechanical work depending on the crank angle were calculated using Eq. (1) with respect to the first law of thermodynamics. (1) d Q n e t d θ = γ γ − 1 P d V d θ + 1 γ − 1 V d P d θ where; dQ net (J) refers to the energy amount passing through the cylinder wall and combustion chamber wall at the end of combustion, θ ( o ) is the crank angle, γ denotes the specific heat ratio, P (Pa) is the cylinder pressure and V (m 3 ) refers to the cylinder volume."
7,Error analysis,"2.6 Error analysis In the present study, the method which was proposed by Holman [48] was applied to the engine test in order to determine the uncertainties. The following equation was utilized for the error analysis. (2) w R = [ ( ∂ R ∂ x 1 w 1 ) 2 + ( ∂ R ∂ x 2 w 2 ) 2 + … + ( ∂ R ∂ x n w n ) 2 ] 1 / 2 where; R is the function of the independent variables of x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , …, x n , w R shows the uncertainty, w 1 , w 2 , …, w n remark the uncertainties of independent variables. The uncertainty results calculated by the Eq. (2) were presented in Table 3 ."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Fatty acid composition of yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel,"3.1 Fatty acid composition of yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel Table 4 shows the fatty acid composition results of yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel and comparison with the other biodiesels produced from edible and in-edible feedstocks. These data revealed that the most dominant fatty acids of yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel were found to be at erucic (34.328%), oleic (28.586%), linolenic (11.607%), and gondoic (11.226%) acids, respectively. It is shown that yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel has high content of monounsaturated fatty acids in the structure. When Table 4 was evaluated, the main difference in the fatty acid profile of the yellow mustard seed oil biodiesel from others was the abundance of the erucic acid. Erucic acid is a long monounsaturated chain fatty acid and its formula is CH3(CH2)7CH = CH(CH2)11COOH. The oils which have high content of erucic acid is considered to be unsuitable for human consumption. Wendlinger et al. [49] pointed out that the erucic acid has been linked to myocardial lipidosis and heart lesions in laboratory rats. Therefore, most of the countries restricted the sale of the mustard oil. For instance, European Union and Australia allowed the maximum 5% and 2% of erucic acid in the fatty acid structure, respectively. The sale of the mustard oil as a foodstuff has not been allowed by United States Food and Drug Administration [49]. On the other hand, Asian countries, especially India, mustard oil accounts for 18% edible oil consumption [50]. In Turkey, there is no information about the commercial production and sale of mustard oil. The fatty acid structures influence the physicochemical properties of biodiesel as well as handling and storage processes. Fan et al. [51] indicated that a controlled amount of saturated, high percentage of monounsaturated, and low percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids should be involved in the ideal oil to produce biodiesel. Giakoumis [52] found that saturated oils were better in oxidation stability and cetane number, whereas unsaturated oils showed lower viscosity and excellent low temperature properties. Additionally, Ruhul et al. [53] stated hat increased the degree of saturation of oil caused to decrease the higher heating value. It should be highlighted at this point that the yellow mustard seed oil used in the present study has not been suitable for human consumption owing to the high content of erucic acid in the fatty acid composition. Thus, it might be used as an alternative non-edible feedstock in the biodiesel production."
10,Fuel specifications of test fuels,"3.2 Fuel specifications of test fuels The most important physical and chemical characteristics of the test fuels were exhibited in Table 5 . As can be seen in Table 5, some fuel properties such as kinematic viscosity, density and low temperature properties of fuel blends were improved with blending alcohols. On the other hand, cetane number, flash point, water content, and heating value of the fuel blends were worsened with alcohol addition. In general, n-pentanol showed better fuel properties than 1-butanol because of the difference of the carbon amount in the structure."
11,Engine torque,"3.3 Engine torque The engine torque values of biodiesel/diesel/1-butanol and biodiesel/diesel/n-pentanol fuel blends were presented in Fig. 2 . The maximum torque values were found to be at 1400 rpm engine speed for all of the test fuels. Furthermore, the maximum torques of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 were obtained as 34.08, 32.69, 32.73 and 32.53 Nm, respectively. The maximum torques of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were determined to be at 34.29, 33.13, 32.99 and 32.63 Nm, respectively. The engine torque values of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 fuels in comparison to ED fuel were reduced averagely by 1.26, 6.78, 6.13 and 7.62%, respectively. At the same time, the engine torque values of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 fuels were decreased averagely by 0.59, 4.27, 5.19 and 7.13%, respectively. There was a decreasing trend in torque values due to the increase in the ratio of alcohol in the blends. Similar decay trend was found by Celik et al. [8], who obtained the maximum reduction in engine torque by 5.98–9.59% at 1400 rpm, and 9.93–14.89% at 3200 rpm with using bioethanol-biodiesel blends. The lower cetane number of alcohols increases the ignition delay and reduces the time required for controlled combustion and occurs poor combustion [59]. Also, the heating value of the alcohols caused to decrease the engine torque values [60]. As can be noticed, 1-butanol and n-pentanol have quite low heating value 35033 and 36870 kJ/kg, respectively. Therefore, the heating values of the alcohol blended fuels were found to be at lower values than diesel fuel. It is expected that n-pentanol blends showed better results than 1-butanol added fuels. Indeed, experimental results shows that n-pentanol added fuels have better torque values. The main reason for this is the high heating value of n-pentanol than 1-butanol. Candan et al. [61] also revealed similar results in their experimental studies. They observed approximately 17.3% decay on average in the torques with the increase of methanol concentration (from 5 to 15%) in the blends."
12,Brake power,"3.4 Brake power The brake power of the test fuels at different engine speeds were given in Fig. 3 . The maximum brake power values of fuel blends were obtained under 2600 rpm of engine speed. The maximum brake powers of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 were 7.49, 7.03, 7.09 and 6.98 kW, respectively and the maximum brake powers of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were determined as 7.50, 7.26, 7.23 and 7.03 kW, respectively. The brake power of ED fuel was 7.51 kW. As a result, n-pentanol showed better results than 1-butanol. The brake power values were decreased when alcohol proportion increased in the blends owing to the heating value and cetane number of alcohols. Moreover, low viscosity and density values of alcohols affected the viscosity and density of fuel blends and caused to leakage in the fuel pump and injector of the test engine [59]. Another reason for the power lost occurred in the diesel engine when using alcohol is the latent heat of evaporation which was explained by Rahimi et al. [60]. Rahimi and coworkers indicated that a part of the energy was consumed for the vaporization of the fuels throughout the fuel injection process because of the higher latent heat of evaporation of alcohols. The compatible results were also found from Celik et al. [8] and Candan et al. [61]. Some modifications might be done in the engine operating conditions so as to avoid from power reductions in the engine output. The injected fuel quantity by fuel pump could be increased with minor modifications on the engine, particularly increasing fuel injection pressure. So that the more fuel is sent inside the cylinder and the more energy is obtained from the combustion process. The other method is to enhance the fuel properties such as cetane number, viscosity, density, etc. with various additives [59]. The compression ratio is another parameters that impacts the power performance of the engine. Fu et al. [62] showed that the power values of liquefied methane engine was obviously increased when the compression ratio increased. They also indicated the direct factor as the higher compression ratio caused to the bigger effective expansion ratio of liquefied methane engine and the larger power ability of the gas in the cylinder."
13,Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC),"3.5 Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) The BSFC values of the test fuels depending on the engine speed were demonstrated in Fig. 4 . The minimum BSFC values were found to be at the range of 2200–2600 rpm for test fuels. The minimum BSFC was obtained to be at 250.51 g/kWh for diesel fuel, while it was found to be at 252.15 g/kWh for B2P5 among other alcohol blends. Compared to ED fuel, BSFC values of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 were increased averagely as 1.84, 8.04, 6.19, and 8.07%, respectively. Therewithal, BSFC values of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were risen averagely by 0.77, 4.97, 5.00, and 7.27%, respectively. The results showed that BSFC values were increased when the alcohol ratio increased in the blends. Because, the heating value of alcohols was lower than both ED and biodiesel fuels [8]. Fuel consumption of n-pentanol-added fuels was lower because the n-pentanol's heating value is higher than that of 1-butanol-added fuels (as seen in Table 5). Additionally, the evaporation of alcohols occurs slowly due to the fact that the latent evaporation temperatures of the alcohols are higher than ED fuel [61]. The other reasons were also explained by Rahimi et al. [60] as follows. First one is cetane number of fuel blends is lower than that of diesel fuel due to the alcohol addition. Secondly, the energy values of the fuel blends were affected from the water content which were come from nature of the alcohol. The experimental results have showed the similar trends with the results of Yilmaz [63], who determined as the methanol and ethanol fraction rises, BSFC of the blended fuels also increases. He recommended some modifications to get rid some of this problem a bit as follows. The better vaporization of fuel blends could be ensured under the full or high load operating conditions, and/or the air should be heated prior to the intake process. Candan et al. [61] determined that BSFC values of methanol blended with diesel fuels increased approximately 4.43–16.76% on average. It is well known that heating value of methanol is lower than both 1-butanol and n-pentanol. It is concluded that our study were validated from above mentioned investigations."
14,In-cylinder pressure,"3.6 In-cylinder pressure The combustion analysis were performed for all of the test fuels at 1400 and 2600 rpm. These engine speeds were significant because the maximum engine torques and brake powers were obtained. The variation of in-cylinder pressure depending on the crank angle (CA) of diesel engine operating with the test fuels under 1400 and 2600 rpm were represented in Fig. 5 . As can be seen in Fig. 5, the maximum in-cylinder pressure of ED, B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, B20Bt10, B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were measured to be at 94.52, 95.82, 95.04, 94.55, 94.66, 95.23, 95.57, 94.73 and 95.41 bar, respectively under 1400 rpm. In-cylinder pressure of test fuels were decreased when the engine speed increased at different ratios. The maximum in-cylinder pressure of ED, B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, B20Bt10, B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were observed as 81.24, 82.19, 79.58, 78.19, 78.91, 80.20, 79.26, 79.24, and 79.51 bar, respectively at 2600 rpm. The maximum in-cylinder pressure of test fuels occurred at 371-372oCA for 1400 rpm, and 373-376oCA for 2600 rpm. Generally, the maximum in-cylinder pressure was moved away from top dead center with the addition of alcohol. This is because the cetane number of the alcohols is lower than ED and biodiesel fuel and therefore increases the ignition delay. Moreover, SOC was postponed due to the lower cetane number of alcohols. So that, more fuel was burned in the premixed phase, thus higher in-cylinder pressure was observed with the fuel blends. One of the important parameter that affects the in-cylinder pressure is latent heat of evaporation. Another reason for increasing ignition delay could be identified by the higher latent heat of evaporation values of alcohols than conventional diesel fuel. It can cause to decrease the in-cylinder temperature and thereby an increase in ignition delay was obtained [64]. This statement were understood when look at the section 3.10. The EGT were decreased since the alcohol treated fuels were utilized in the diesel engine. Anbarasu et al. [64] also stated another reason. Lower viscosity and density values of alcohol could cause to enhance the spray characteristics. Therefore better air-fuel mixture might be obtained in the combustion chamber and the in-cylinder pressure was increased. Örs et al. [65] revealed that more fuel sample accumulated at the point of SOC owing to the lower cetane number and it burned suddenly at the end of ignition delay period. So in-cylinder pressure was increased with the addition of alcohol to the blend fuels. Almost immediate results were also found by Celik et al. [8], and Tse et al. [66]."
15,Heat release rate (HRR),"3.7 Heat release rate (HRR) Similar to the in-cylinder pressure, HRR was analyzed at 1400 and 2600 rpm engine speeds. The change of HRR values depending on the engine CA of the diesel engine running on the test fuels under 1400 and 2600 rpm were drawn in Fig. 6 . A negative HRR was occurred at the beginning of the combustion since the fuel evaporation accumulated throughout ignition delay period. However, this got a positive when the combustion started [24]. When looking at Fig. 6, the maximum HRR values of ED, B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, B20Bt10, B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were obtained to be at 16.11, 17.14, 17.01, 16.76, 17.48, 17.26, and 17.31 J/o, respectively under 1400 rpm. At the same time, under 2600 rpm engine speed condition, the maximum HRR values of ED, B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, B20Bt10, B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were computed as 15.89, 16.47, 16.13, 15.80, 16.39, 16.45, 16.36, 16.30 and 16.38 J/o, respectively. When the maximum HRR values of the fuels subjected to alcohol addition were evaluated, it was generally seen that the increases occurred which is similar to the results of Örs et al. [65]. The above observations show that the HRR values of the fuel blends increased between 4.03 and 8.50% at 1400 rpm while between 1.38 and 3.65% at 2600 rpm. Only B20Bt5 fuel sample demonstrated 0.57% lower HRR value that diesel fuel. HRR values have risen due to almost similar reasons mentioned in in-cylinder pressure section. This can be explained as the effect of increasing the burning rate of the alcohols and the decrease in the heat transfer rate. It also causes the cetane numbers of the alcohols to be low and increases the ignition delay, thereby increasing the amount of fuel in the cylinder [26]. The addition of alcohol leads to increase latent heat of evaporation of the fuel blends. Therefore in-cylinder temperature was reduced because of increasing the ignition delay and it effected heat release rate. Additionally, the diffusive combustion phase was enhanced because of the higher oxygen content of fuel blends. At the same time HRR values were increased and it also lead to reduce the combustion period [64]. Zhu et al. [17] indicated that higher HRR values was obtained with pentanol addition into the biodiesel fuel because of lower viscosity. Pentanol addition caused to improve the atomization in the cylinder and advanced the air-fuel mixture. Tse et al. [66] reported that longer ignition delay, better volatility property and lower viscosity of the alcohol blended fuel samples might bring about more fuel accumulated in the ignition delay period so as to combust in the premixed burning phase thereby higher HRR was obtained."
16,Combustion parameters,"3.8 Combustion parameters The combustion process consists of ignition delay (ID), uncontrolled combustion, controlled combustion and after burning periods. During the ignition delay, fuel is injected into the combustion chamber and evaporates by mixing with air. Ignition delay period is the time span between commencement of fuel injection and the start of fuel ignition. Ignition delay, in other words, the main rate at which sudden pressure increase is observed. During this time, the physical and chemical processes required to prepare the fuel for combustion come into play. There is a temperature difference between the pressure of the fuel sprayed into the combustion chamber and the temperature elevated at the time of temperature compression with the temperature. During the vaporization of the fuel, the temperature of the heat overflows this temperature difference. During this transfer extracted heat, slow to some extent on the temperature and pressure increase in the cylinder [67]. Other important parameters in the analysis of combustion in diesel engines are start of injection (SOI), start of combustion (SOC), end of combustion (EOC) and combustion period (CP). Injection timing or SOI is the time when the injected fuel inside the combustion chamber starts. On one hand, SOC is defined at which the net HRR began to increase. On the other hand, EOC is described when the net HRR gets zero at the end of combustion process. Combustion duration or CP is identified to be at the time interval between SOC and EOC [30]. ID, SOI, SOC, EOC and CP values of the test fuels obtained from the combustion analysis were given in Table 6 . SOI, SOC and EOC values increased depending on the increases of engine speed, while ID and CP values decreased. Similar trend was also found by Celik and his team [8] who stated that the temperature of the inside cylinder increased by means of increasing engine speed and hence, ID occurred shorter. In another study conducted by Qi et al. [68], ID period was decreased when the engine load was increased because of the higher gas temperature in the cylinder. Unsurprisingly, the engine speed caused to rise the EGT. For this reason, when Table 6 and Fig. 8 were evaluated together, the values obtained were largely close to the expected results. Also, it can be seen that the alcohol addition on the diesel/biodiesel blends increased the ID values. One of the most influential features that affect the ID is the cetane numbers of fuels. The results of the cetane number of biodiesel being slightly higher than ED fuel, whereas the cetane number of the alcohols being low. Indeed, one of the most important parameter that affects the biodiesel's cetane number is the fatty acid composition of the sample. This subject was clearly discussed in Section 3.1. The cetane numbers of 1-butanol and n-pentanol were also found to be at 17.32 and 19.74, respectively. Although, the cetane number of biodiesel was higher than those of diesel fuel, the cetane numbers of the fuel blends were decreased owing to the alcohol addition. A low cetane number might cause to evaporate more fuel in the combustion chamber and occur a higher amount of heat. As a result, a longer ID is obtained. Ozener et al. [69] stated that the poor atomization, slower mixing process, higher penetration and lower cone angle became in the engine because of the high fuel viscosity and occurred a longer ID period. On the other hand, the viscosity and density values of the alcohol blended fuels were lower values which enhance the air-fuel mixture and thus higher amount of fuel are burned rapidly during the premixed burning phase. The increasing alcohol concentration in the fuel blends decreased the surface tension and density. This indicates that the blended fuels well mixed with the air owing to the alcohol's evaporation and atomization are enhanced in this way [18]. Tse et al. [66] found that the increasing the ethanol concentration (from 0 to 20%) in the fuel blends got a longer ID and hence SOC was retarded. In this study, the increasing 1-butanol and n-pentanol proportions in the blends were postponed SOC values in comparison to the diesel fuel. Additionally, Alptekin et al. [70] indicated that later SOI periods of alcohol blended fuels may bring about retarding SOC period. The results obtained from the experiments were largely similar to these explained works and done by other researchers such as Zhu et al. [17] and Örs et al. [65]."
17,Brake thermal efficiency,"3.9 Brake thermal efficiency The variation of the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of test fuels depending on the engine speed was demonstrated in Fig. 7 . As can be seen in Fig. 7, the BTEs of B2Bt5 and B2P5 fuel blends increased averagely by 0.69 and 0.85%, respectively in comparison to ED fuel, while the BTEs of B2Bt10 and B2P10 fuel blends decreased averagely by 2.42 and 0.68%, respectively. The increase in BTE having low concentration of biodiesel and alcohol in the blends is due to the improvement of the combustion. Either biodiesel or alcohol have much more oxygen content in the chemical structure. This cause to increase oxygen in the cylinder and hence a more complete combustion is achieved. The faster combustion might be a contributor to the high BTE [64]. An et al. [71] pointed out that the EGT and the viscosity effect of biodiesel became the predominant parameters, resulting a poor combustion inside cylinder of the engine. Compared to the ED fuel's results, the BTEs of B20Bt5, B20Bt10, B20P5 and B20P10 were reduced averagely by 0.84, 1.59, 0.04, and 1.55%, respectively. When the results were evaluated, it was seen that the BTEs decreased generally with alcohol addition, which is similar to the results of Candan et al. [61]. Ibrahim [30] found that the addition of 20% butanol into the B50 blend reduced the maximum thermal efficiency from 30.7% to 29.4%. Meanwhile, no obvious difference was monitored for the BTE with using n-pentanol/diesel fuel blends by Wei et al. [31]. On the other hand, 1-butanol and n-pentanol treated fuel blends showed tolerable variation in the BTE thus they have great potentials to be applied as an additive fuel in the diesel engines. Furthermore, it was determined that this ratio increased due to the increase of alcohol ratio. It could be explained as the heating values of the biodiesel and alcohol are lower than the diesel fuel. Besides this, the BTE of n-pentanol added fuels were higher than that of 1-butanol added fuels owing to the fact that the heating value of 1-butanol is lower than the heating value of n-pentanol. ID increases due to the lower cetane number and so it causes to decrease the BTE. The BTE can be improved by applying different ways on the engine. For instance, Fu et al. [62] represented that both engine torque and thermal efficiency of liquefied methane engine could be enhanced by increasing compression ratio."
18,Exhaust gas temperature,"3.10 Exhaust gas temperature The change of the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) depending on the engine speed was represented in Fig. 8. The maximum EGT values of the test fuels were happened at 2600 rpm. The maximum EGTs of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5 and B20Bt10 were found to be at 652.0, 648.4, 654.8 and 651 °C, respectively, while the maximum EGTs of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5 and B20P10 were determined as 653.0, 644.1, 656.8 and 651.5 °C, respectively. The highest EGT was observed as 658.9 °C in ED fuel. EGT is an important variable that affects the exhaust emissions. EGT depends on the fuel specifications like cetane number, density, viscosity, heating value, etc. and engine operating conditions such as compression ratio, injection pressure, etc. [61]. There is not significant difference between the experimental results, EGT of alcohol blended fuels were slightly lower than ED fuel. The alcohols can withdraw the heat from the medium due to the having high evaporation heat and EGT can decreases slightly. Moreover, the combustion end temperature decreases when the diesel engine operating with the fuel which is the high oxygen content and low heating value. The high content of oxygen in the alcohol structure causes to decrease EGT by increasing the combustion rate [63,72]."
19,CO emission,"3.11 CO emission CO emission results of test fuels versus engine speed were shown in Fig. 9 . As can be seen in Fig. 9, CO emissions of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 were reduced averagely by 6.90, 11.02, 20.18, and 27.54%, respectively compared to ED fuel results. Meanwhile similar trend was observed in the n-pentanol added fuels. CO emissions of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were decreased averagely by 19.23, 27.32, 24.80 and 32.40%, respectively. It was observed that the alcohol addition decreased the CO emission. Also, n-pentanol added fuels showed better result than 1-butanol added fuels owing to the oxygen content in the structure. CO emission, expresses the lost chemical energy, is an important parameter through the exhaust gases. Also, CO emission in the exhaust can identify the incomplete combustion because of the inadequate amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber. Therefore, the oxygen content in the medium is effective in order not to form CO emission. Biodiesel fuel and alcohols include much more oxygen in the structure than ED fuel. For this reason, it is predicted that less CO emissions will be released as a result of these fuels. However, the excess oxygen is attached with carbon atoms and forms CO2 emission [61]. In addition to this, alcohols have less carbon atoms in the bound, resulting less amount of CO emission [59]. Another reason for decreasing the CO emission is cetane number of the fuel, because the high cetane number can ensure a near complete combustion in the chamber. Imdadul et al. [73] remarked that pentanol evaporated easily in the cylinder owing to the lower density value of pentanol than diesel fuel thereby the length of the spray atomization was reduced. They also indicated that pentanol added fuel samples lead to a leaning influence as pentanol had low stoichiometric air–fuel ratio. For that, CO emission was decreased. Ajav et al. [74] found that the percentage of CO emissions were reduced from 36.8 to 62.5% with the use of 5–20% ethanol-diesel blends compared to the diesel fuel. Choi et al. [75] reported that split injection could be applied on the diesel engine instead of single injection in order to obtain more decreasing CO emission level. Li et al. [36] also obtained decreased CO emissions with using diesel/biodiesel/pentanol blends and Akar [14] also found that butanol addition to diesel/flax oil biodiesel decreased CO emission in comparison to the diesel fuel. The opposite outcome in CO emission was obtained by Wei et al. [31], who indicated that diesel/pentanol blends showed higher CO emission, and its influence was prominent under the lower engine loads. Zhu et al. [17] concluded that CO emissions of waste cooking oil biodiesel/n-pentanol blends were higher than both diesel and biodiesel fuels, particularly low engine load from 0.08 to 0.24 MPa. Randazzo and Sodré [28] noticed that CO emission was increased proportionally to ethanol concentration in B20 fuel blend."
20,CO2 emission,"3.12 CO2 emission The change of CO2 emissions of the test fuels were exhibited in Fig. 10 . When the Fig. 10 was analyzed, the maximum results were found to be at 2800 rpm that was near the engine speed of maximum brake power. The maximum CO2 emissions of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 were found to be at 14.4, 14.2, 14.1 and 13.8%, respectively. At the same time, the maximum CO2 emissions of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were measured at 14.5, 14.2, 14.5, and 14.0%, respectively. Almost the same results were obtained in all test fuels. On the other hand, alcohol added fuels formed less CO2 emissions than ED fuel. CO2 emission can give an information about the complete combustion in the chamber. One of the most important parameter is the oxygen content for generating complete combustion. However, the opposite results were obtained in the experiments. Alcohols and biodiesel fuel have much more oxygen in the structure, but CO2 emissions decreased. The main reason for this, alcohols have less carbon atoms in the structure than ED and biodiesel fuels. It caused to less CO2 emissions. This result is in agreement with that obtained by Randazzo and Sodré [28], who detected that increasing ethanol concentration in the B20 fuel blend lead to decrease CO2 emission because of low carbon to hydrogen ratio in the ethanol molecule. It was seen that n-pentanol added fuels formed more CO2 emission than 1-butanol added fuels because one has 5 carbons and the other has 4 carbons. Another reason can be that the alcohols prevent the homogeneous mixture of fuel in the cylinder. The combustion speed and the reaction time of the carbon and oxygen atoms can decreases. Thus, less CO2 emission can form in the exhaust gas after the combustion process [61]. Alptekin et al. [70] presented that CO2 emission of fuel sample (20% waste oil biodiesel + 20% bioethanol + 60% diesel fuel) decreased up to 7.1% compared with diesel fuel at 600 Nm because of the low carbon to hydrogen ratio of bioethanol. The reduction trend of CO2 emission with butanol addition to the diesel/biodiesel blends were verified from Akar [16]. It can be concluded that 1-butanol and n-pentanol treated fuel blends may be conducted as an important additives to struggle with the global warming. An opposite trend in CO2 emission was also reported by different authors. Hulwan and Joshi [18] stated that CO2 emission values of fuel blends, which included 20 and 30% ethanol in the diesel-biodiesel blend, were ascended at low load engine operating conditions. Because, the fuel consumption was increased so as to obtain same power since the poor combustion. They also found that CO2 emissions were not changed at all loads when the injection timing were adjusted from 21° to 13° CA before top dead center. Another study conducted by Babu and Anand [42], who found that the CO2 emission of used frying oil biodiesel/diesel/alcohol blends had higher than diesel and biodiesel fuel because of complete combustion. However, they observed maximum CO2 emission with using B85D5P10 which was 1.1 and 0.85% vol. higher than that of diesel fuel and biodiesel fuel, respectively."
21,O2 emission,"3.13 O2 emission Fig. 11 exhibits O2 emissions as a function of engine speed for ED, biodiesel/ED/1-butanol and biodiesel/ED/n-pentanol blends. The maximum O2 emissions of the test fuels were observed at 3200 rpm engine speed. O2 emissions of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 were increased averagely by 84.62, 93.45, 102.59 and 121.34%, respectively in comparison to ED fuel results. And also, O2 emissions of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were risen averagely by 52.74, 67.72, 62.82 and 78.38%, respectively. One of the most important parameter in order to occur combustion in the internal combustion engines is the amount of oxygen in combustion chamber. O2 emissions increased with the increase of alcohol and biodiesel addition in the fuels. Because, the alcohols and biodiesel fuel have oxygen content at different rates [76]. There has not been previously reported study about oxygen emission of 1-butanol and n-pentanol treated fuel samples to the best of the authors’ knowledge."
22,NOX emissions,"3.14 NOX emissions Approximately 78% of the air is composed of N2 and it cannot react in normal conditions. However, N2 reacts with O2 owing to the high temperature in the combustion chamber. NOX is composed of higher amount of NO and lesser amount of NO2. In general, the other nitrogen oxides likewise N2O, N2O5, NO3 are not taken into account. It is very important to understand NOX formation mechanism in terms of decreasing NOX emissions. The most common mechanisms for NOX formation during the diesel combustion are Zeldovich (thermal), Fenimore (prompt), N2O pathway, fuel-bound nitrogen and the NNH. Zeldovich and Fenimore mechanisms are dominant mechanisms in biodiesel combustion [77]. These mechanisms are summarized in the following paragraphs. Zeldovich mechanism describes the oxidation of nitrogen and NOX formation. It is believed that Zeldovich mechanism is the predominant pathway for NOX formation in the exhaust during the combustion of biodiesel and diesel fuel [78]. N2 and O2 react with a series of chemical reactions because of combustion above 1700 K in this mechanism. Saravanan et al. [79] indicated that the rate of the thermal NO formation is dependent on the temperature of the combustion gases. Furthermore, the concentration of oxygen and nitrogen, and residence time have affected the production of thermal NO [80]. The pathways including chemical reactions (3)–(5) is known as Zeldovich mechanism [81]. (3) N 2 + O ↔ N O + N (4) N + O 2 ↔ N O + O (5) N + O H ↔ N O + H Another significant NOX formation pathway is firstly identified by Fenimore and was labeled as prompt NOX. Fenimore indicated that NO emission was begun by means of molecular nitrogen and hydrocarbon radicals likewise CH, CH2, C2, C, and C2H [82]. The prompt NOX is formed through the following reactions between (6) and (10) [77]. (6) C H + N 2 ↔ H C N + N (7) C H 2 + N 2 ↔ H C N + N H (8) N + O 2 ↔ N O + O (9) H C N + O H ↔ C N + H 2 O (10) C N + O 2 ↔ N O + C O It is noted that the most important contributors are CH and CH2 demonstrated in Equations (6) and (7) to form prompt NOX [77]. NOX formation rate from non-thermal pathway such as prompt and fuel-bound nitrogen are remarked as less important than thermal NOX formation [79]. On the other hand, thermal mechanism is necessary for considering in this study according to the excess air ratio is bigger than 1.0. As mentioned above in the first paragraph, NOX calculated as the sum of NO and NO2 without regard to other nitrogen oxides. NO and NO2 emission values were presented in Table 1s which is given in the supplementary material document for better understanding. NOX emissions as a function of engine speed for ED, biodiesel/ED/1-butanol and biodiesel/ED/n-pentanol blends were drawn in Fig. 12 , and as seen in Fig. 12, the maximum NOX emissions of the test fuels were measured at 1400 rpm that was the maximum engine torques. Generally, NOX emissions increases with the increase of biodiesel fuel proportion in the blends. This point was explained by many researchers [83–86]. However, NOX emissions decreased with the addition of alcohols in the fuels. In the present study, NOX emissions could decrease this way. While NOX emission of ED fuel was measured at 1244 ppm, NOX emission of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B20Bt5, and B20Bt10 were found to be at 1214, 1169, 1283, and 1239 ppm, respectively and NOX emission of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 were determined to be at 1211, 1167, 1279, and 1237 ppm, respectively. The in-cylinder pressure and temperature, ID and CP are the most significant parameters for the formation of NOX emissions in the exhaust gas. Yilmaz et al. [34,63] indicated that the overall oxygen contents of blends were increased by adding alcohol and leading to better combustion in the cylinder, while decreasing the cetane number. These changes can occur a cooling effect in the cylinder. The oxygen content of 1-butanol was calculated to be at 21.63%, while the oxygen content of n-pentanol was 18.18%. Anbarasu et al. [64] noted that alcohol blended fuels decreased the cetane number, which expresses a longer ID and more quantity of fuel combusted in the premixed mode. They also presented that the key factors which influence the NOX formation are combustion temperature, local oxygen concentration, and residence time in the high temperature zone based on the thermal NOX formation mechanism. Although this situation might emit the higher NOX emissions, the cetane numbers and also ID values of fuel blends in this study were very close to each other (51.37–53.76). For this reason, NOX emissions are not adversely affected. Celik et al. [8] and Sayin [87] highlighted that the alcohols’ cooling effect can cause to reduce the combustion temperature in the cylinder owing to the latent heat of evaporation and thus NOX emission decreased. The latent heat of evaporation of 1-butanol, n-pentanol and diesel fuel were given as 581.4 kJ/kg, 308. kJ/kg, and 270–375 kJ/kg, respectively by Kumar and Saravanan [33]. Huang et al. [88] pointed out that 1-butanol and n-pentanol have lower heating value and for that combustion temperature were reduced. In the present study, the heating value of 1-butanol and n-pentanol were found to be at 35033 kJ/kg and 36870 kJ/kg, respectively. So that, the nitrogen and oxygen atoms cannot react properly with each other and reduce the NOX emissions by decreasing the temperature of residual gases inside the combustion chamber. In addition, since the density and viscosity of alcohols are lower than the biodiesel and diesel fuel, the combustion temperature in the cylinder directly affects the final temperature. Above mentioned reasons were evaluated, n-pentanol added fuels showed better results than 1-butanol blended fuels. Tse et al. [66], and Aydin and Ogut [76] also revealed similar results in their experimental studies. Shu et al. [89] recommended that the retarding of the pilot injection degree could be an effective way to decease NOX emissions of diesel engine fuelled with natural gas/diesel fuel blend."
23,Smoke opacity,"3.15 Smoke opacity The variation of smoke opacity of test fuels under different engine speeds were shown in Fig. 13 . The maximum smoke opacity values were measured at the engine speed of 1800 rpm. Compared to ED fuel, the smoke opacity of B2Bt5, B2Bt10, B2P5, and B20Bt5 were decreased averagely by 21.20, 35.43, 30.94 and 44.43%, respectively. Meanwhile, the smoke opacities of B2P5, B2P10, B20P5, and B20P10 fuel blends were reduced averagely by 10.47, 16.39, 15.86, and 25.81%, respectively. First of all, smoke occurs due to the incomplete combustion process. Biodiesel fuels have more oxygen content in the chemical structure. Biodiesel-diesel blends showed less smoke emission than diesel fuel [69]. However, the opposite result was given by Subbabiah and Gopal [29]. They found that the smoke opacity of biodiesel increase by 27.93% than diesel fuel. The experimental results showed that the alcohol addition also decreased the smoke opacity of the diesel engine. Furthermore, the increasing the alcohol ratio in the blends lead to the more decreasing smoke emissions. The results are also comparable to those reported by Subbabiah and Gopal and Huang et al. [88]. The smoke opacity values of the alcohol added fuels decreased owing to the oxygen content of the alcohol in the bond. Celik et al. [8] obtained the maximum reduction of 33.11% with using 20% bioethanol-80% biodiesel blends compared to the neat biodiesel fuels. Can et al. [59] also stated that the smoke emission were reduced with addition ethanol to the diesel fuel under the original injection pressure. They also tested the engine at various injection pressure such as 200 and 250 bars, and thus even more decreasing smoke emissions were observed in all engine speeds. Lei et al. [27] showed that the atmospheric pressure has an important impact on the smoke emission if it's lower than 90 kPa, otherwise the impacts were declined. Candan et al. [61] noticed that cetane improver addition into the methanol-diesel fuel blends increased the cetane number, whereas smoke opacity also increased approximately 5% on average on account for extended combustion period, though methanol blends showed the decay in smoke emission by 29.6% on average. Imdadul et al. [73] noted that an average decrement 21.2% in smoke for pentanol added fuels in contrast to B20 biodiesel fuel. Sayin [87] found that methanol blended fuels generated less smoke rather than ethanol blended fuels because of higher oxygen content of methanol. The compatible results were observed in the present study. 1-butanol has higher amount of oxygen than n-pentanol and hence even lower smoke emissions were occurred in the exhaust. Fang et al. [90] concluded that ethanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel blends were an efficient way to decrease both NOX and smoke emissions in premixed low temperature combustion process."
24,Engine noise,"3.16 Engine noise The engine noise variation of the test fuels at different engine speeds were given in Fig. 14 . The engine noise results fluctuates at different rations for the test fuels. The maximum engine noise were measured at 3000–3200 rpm, while the minimum engine noise values were found to be at 1000–1200 rpm. Generally, the graph was examined, the engine noises were decreased with using alcohol added fuels. It can be explained that the alcohols have much more oxygen amount than ED fuel and it improves the combustion. Although, the alcohol addition increased oxygen content of the fuel blends, it causes to decrease viscosity, density and heating value. On the other hand, biodiesel can slightly improve the viscosity and density of the fuel blends. Moreover, the cetane number was increased by means of biodiesel addition. Also, biodiesel proportion in the fuel blends positively impacts the noise level because of lubricity properties of biodiesel. So that, the engine noise values decrease slightly. One of the most important parameters that affects the vehicle comfort is noise. Also, engine noise adversely influences human health. In spite of the fact that many researches have been carried out by automotive manufacturers in order to reduce the noise of diesel engine, the engines have still too noisy. Approximately 20% of the European Union population have been exposed to inadmissible noise level [91]. For these reason, further investigation should be conducted in order to decrease the noise level. There are few studies previously published considering noise impact of the diesel engine fuelled with various fuels. Uludamar et al. [92] tested the noise level of the diesel engine run on hydrogen as well as biodiesel blends. They determined that these fuels improved the engine noise. In another study conducted by Uludamar et al. [93], they applied regression analysis to investigate the effects of biodiesel on the diesel engine noise level and observed that noise level was decreased with biodiesel usage. Celebi et al. [94] found that the engine noise level was decreased with natural gas addition into intake air as well as biodiesel blend utilization. In an interesting study conducted by Mondal et al. [95], they investigated the impact of vehicle noise on the bus and truck drivers health and clearly presented that engine noise negatively affects the cardiovascular health of both bus and truck drivers. Literature survey indicated that a study of the noise values of the diesel engine using ternary blends of diesel, biodiesel, and alcohol has not been found within the knowledge of the authors."
25,Conclusions,"Recently, alternative fuels have gotten to the foreground because of rapid declining of fossil-based fuel reserves, increasing petroleum prices, more stringent emission regulations, rising environmental pollution from conventional fuels and concerns over security of energy. These anxieties direct scientists to conduct research on alternative fuels. One of the most significant alternative fuel sources for internal combustion engines are higher alcohols on account of their environmental and economic advantages. 1-butanol and n-pentanol, which are higher alcohols and can be produced from renewable feedstocks, have four and five carbons in molecular structure, respectively. In this study, ternary blends of diesel/biodiesel/1-butanol and diesel/biodiesel/n-pentanol were performed in a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled, direct injection diesel engine and the following findings were outlined point by point. • The fuel properties showed that the alcohol treatments slightly decreased the kinematic viscosities, densities, heating values, flash points, and cetane numbers. However, addition of alcohol into the biodiesel/diesel fuel blends reasonably improved the low temperature properties. • 1-butanol blended fuels decreased by 1.26–7.62%, while n-pentanol blended fuels had 0.59–7.13% lower engine torque than diesel fuel. The maximum brake powers of 1-butanol blends were found to be at between 6.98 kW and 7.49 kW, while n-pentanol blends showed closer values to diesel fuel, which were obtained as between 7.03 kW and 7.50 kW. • BSFC values of 1-butanol and n-pentanol treated fuels were up to 8.07% and 7.27% on average higher than that of diesel fuel, respectively. Indeed, these results were predicted due to the heating values of fuel samples. BTEof most ternary blends was lower than diesel fuel except from B2Bt5 and B2P5. Nevertheless, no obvious difference was monitored for the BTE. • The maximum in-cylinder pressure of higher alcohol blended fuels found to be as between 94.55 bar and 95.82 bar at 371-372oCA for 1400 rpm, and as between 78.19 bar and 82.19 bar at 375-376oCA for 2600 rpm. The maximum HRR values of 1-butanol and n-pentanol treated fuels were higher than diesel fuel under 1400 rpm and 2600 rpm. Solely B20Bt5 fuel showed a negligible reduction level by 0.57% from diesel fuel. • When compared with diesel fuel, SOI timing for alcohol blended fuels extended 2-3oCA at low engine speed and 2-4oCA at high engine speed. Furthermore, the alcohol addition on the diesel/biodiesel blends increased the ID values. • It was observed that the maximum EGT reduction of fuel blends were obtained to be at 2.25% for B2P10 blend when compared to diesel fuel. • In comparison that of diesel fuel, n-pentanol and 1-butanol added fuels drastically reduced CO emissions up to the average of 32.40% and 27.54%, respectively compared to diesel fuel. At the same time, CO2 emissions of fuel blends were observed between 13.8% and 14.5%. • Although the biodiesel fuel showed a negative effect on the NOX emission formation, higher alcohols, especially n-pentanol, could be an effective additives to decrease NOX emissions by considering the results. Furthermore, the smoke opacity of the alcohol treated fuel blends decreased up to 44.43% on average as compared to diesel fuel. • The engine noises were generally decreased with using alcohol added fuels. The influence of the engine noise on the drivers' health should be deeply investigated by researchers. It can be concluded that n-pentanol and 1-butanol are promising alternative additives for use in compression ignition engines. In further studies, the other higher alcohols can be applied in the diesel engine. Similar experiments can be conducted with different test engines and vehicle engines to generalize the results. Also, the engine operating conditions such as injection pressure, engine load, compression ratio, etc. can be changed and the results were compared. Moreover, thermodynamic, environmental and economic analyzes will be applied to the diesel engine fuelled with the alcohol blended fuels."
