0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation reaction is an important reaction process in the field of fine chemicals and petrochemical industries [1–2]. In particular, the chemically selective hydrogenation reaction is more favored due to the specific valuable products which are difficult to obtain from natural sources. As a typical α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, citral is considered as the representative model molecule for selective hydrogenation, since it has three different double bonds: conjugated CC and CO double bonds, and isolated CC double bond [3]. Hydrogenating the three different double bonds can obtain unequal reduction products, such as citronellal (Cal), citronellol (Col), and two isomers of unsaturated alcohols (UAs) of nerol and geraniol. Among them, industrially important unsaturated alcohols (nerol and geraniol) possess the highest economic value and have a wide application in diet, food, perfumes, and pharmaceutical intermediates [4]. However, from a thermodynamic point of view, the CC double bond is easier to hydrogenate among the conjugated double bonds of citral molecular due to that the CC bond has lower bond energy and shorter bond length. Consequently, the selectivity from citral to unsaturated alcohols usually drop rapidly along with the reaction temperature increase due to the competing reaction of CC hydrogen reduction [5]. Therefore, it is a challenging task to design and develop the high-performance catalytic system for chemoselective catalysis of citral to unsaturated alcohols. In order to achieve both high conversion and selectivity, precious metal based catalysts such as Pt [6], Ru [7] and Ir [8] are used to facilitate the hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols, but their expensive price and sacacity limit the large-scale industrial application. In this context, the transition metals, especially Co, attract people’s attention due to the low price and excellent selective hydrogenation performance for catalyzing crital to unsaturated alcohols [9–10]. In most instances, the excellent effect of the citral catalytic hydrogenation is difficult to achieve with single metal cobalt [11–12]. Therefore, the fabrication of complex noble-transition metal nanocomposites by alloying could not only reduce the cost of the precious metal catalyst, but also enhance the selectivity and activity of the catalyst by changing the electronic structure via the interaction with the noble metal and transition metal [13–15]. For example, it was reported that the incorporation of Re in Co-base catalyst can increase the hydrogenation selectivity from citral to unsaturated alcohols by 20%, and the incorporation of Sn in Pt-base catalyst can increase selectivity by 30% [16–17]. Nonetheless, the reported noble-transition metals alloy catalysts have some disadvantages, such as the high price, complicated preparation process and easy leaching during the reaction. In particular, after adding the reducing agent, the reduction products can remain in the catalyst system and affect the entire catalytic reaction process. In addition, metal alloy nanoparticles catalysts prepared by common methods, such as co-precipitation method and impregnation method, tend to be large in size and easy to be agglomerated and lost under harsh reaction conditions, leading to reduced catalytic activity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new facile method to prepare cheaper, stable and tiny metal alloy nanoparticles without additional reducing agent. Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a new type of crystalline porous material which is constructed by inorganic metal center and organic functional group through covalent bond or ion-covalent bond. Due to the unique characteristics such as periodic porous structure, high surface area, tailored composition, and adjustable functionality, MOFs have achieved rapid development and have a wide range of applications in separation and purification, energy storage, medical imaging, drug delivery, and catalysis [18–19]. Moreover, employing MOFs as self-sacrificed precursors or templates, a series of nano-structural materials such as porous metal/carbons, metal oxides and metal-free heteroatoms doped carbons could be prepared facilely [19–21]. Compared with the traditional synthetic methods, the MOF-derived nano-structural materials can not only inherit the structure property of corresponding MOFs, but also allow precise control of the composition and integration of certain functionalities [22–24]. Among them, the metal nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous carbon constructed from MOF templates/precursors were considered as good candidates as the catalytic materials due to the following aspects: (1) the carbon layer of the metal/carbons plays an excellent role in promoting the electron transfer and improving the electric conductivity [25]. (2) The metal nanoparticles from MOF pyrolysis are packaged by the porous carbon cloth, which limits the loss of the catalysts during the reaction process [26–27], and (3) the carbon layer derived from MOFs pyrolysis process, in which the carbon layer shows well reducibility at the high temperature, potentially results in an element by reduction of metal ions without adding any reducing agent [28–29]. Based on the above viewpoints, we herein present a new carbon-coated AgCo alloy by using Ag(I)-doped Co-MOF as precursor. Using the precursor of Ag(I)-doped Co-MOF was based on the following considerations: (1) Ag is cheaper and has more abundant reserve than other noble metals. (2) The Ag(I)-doped Co-MOF can be facile synthesized by one-pot method, in which Ag ions are well dispersed in Co-MOF due to the ordered porosity of metal-organic framework. (3) The carbon layer derived from MOF pyrolysis process can protect Ag nanoparticles from aggregation, resulting in active metal nanoparticles with a small size. (4) The interaction with Co and Ag can regulate the surface electronic structure, thereby increasing the chemoselective of the hydrogenation reaction. Using the above strategy, a series of carbon layer packaged AgCo alloy nanoparticles with a small particle size of 7 ~ 9 nm and different silver contents is generated from Ag(I)-doped Co-MOF catalyst precursor. The resultant 6AgCo@C-510 composites serve as high efficiency and stable catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of citral to produce nerol and geraniol. Near full conversions of citral with 69% selectivity toward geraniol and nerol, and excellent cycle stability have been achieved in low H2 pressure and low temperature, exhibiting superior catalytic activities compared with other noble metal catalysts [30–31]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All reagents and chemicals, 2,5-Dihydroxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (DOBDC), Cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), Silver nitrate (AgNO3), Dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol (EtOH), and methanol (MeOH), were purchased from J&K Chemicals and used without any further purification."
3,Preparation,"2.2 Preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of catalyst precursor xAg/Co-MOF was prepared by one-pot hydrothermal method (x represents the weight percentage of Ag in the catalyst precursor). Typically, 0.2216 g DOBDC, 0.077 g AgNO3 and 0.9896 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dispersed in 75 mL solution of H2O, EtOH and DMF with a 1/1/1 ratio. After the solid were completely dissolved, the mixture was transformed into a 100 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and heated to 120 °C for 24 h. After natural cooling, the crystalline product was centrifugally separated from the mixture and washed with DMF and methanol. Finally, the crystals were dried in vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h to get the final product 6Ag/Co-MOF. Using the similar preparation procedure, a serial of xAg/Co-MOF (2Ag/Co-MOF, 4Ag/Co-MOF, 8Ag/Co-MOF and 10Ag/Co-MOF), could be obtained by changing the quality of AgNO3 with 0.025 g, 0.050 g, 0.105 g and 0.134 g, respectively. For comparison, Co-MOF without Ag species was also prepared by the similar synthesized method without AgNO3. 2.2.2 Synthesis of catalyst with different Ag content The xAgCo@C was prepared by calcining the xAg/Co-MOF in N2 atmosphere. Typically, the xAg/Co-MOF was placed in a tubular furnace and heated from room temperature to 510 °C at which hold for 6 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under N2 flow. After cooling naturally, black catalysts were obtained and named as xAgCo@C-510. For comparison, Co@C-510 was obtained by the analogous way. 2.2.3 Synthesis of catalyst with different calcination temperatures The 6AgCo@C-T was prepared by calcining the 6Ag/Co-MOF in N2 atmosphere. Similarly, the calcination process for 6AgCo@C-T is the same as xAgCo@C-510 except that the temperature is different. The calcination temperature was increased to the target temperature at 420 °C, 450 °C, 480 °C, 540 °C, 570 °C, and 600 °C respectively, and maintained 6 h at the target temperature. The obtained catalysts were named as 6AgCo@C-420, 6AgCo@C-450, 6AgCo@C-480, 6AgCo@C-540, 6AgCo@C-570, and 6AgCo@C-600, respectively. 2.2.4 Synthesis of comparative catalyst 6Ag/Co@C-510 For comparison, doped 6Ag/Co@C-510 was synthesized by impregnation method. Typically, AgNO3 solid was dispersed in water to form AgNO3 aqueous solution (10 mL, C Ag + = 10 mg mL−1) by ultrasound. Then, the as-prepared AgNO3 solution was added dropwise to the Co@C-510 (1000 mg). After stirring 12 h at the room temperature, the mixture was separated by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum. Lastly, the mixture was reduced in H2 flow. After cooling to ambient temperature, the 6Ag/Co@C-510 catalyst by impregnation method can be gained. 2.2.5 Synthesis of comparative catalyst AgCo@C For comparison, AgCo alloy catalysts supported on activated carbon were synthesized. Firstly, AgNO3 and Co(NO3)2·6H2O was dispersed in deionized water to form a mixed aqueous solution of AgNO3 and Co(NO3)2 by ultrasound. Secondly, the as-prepared mixed aqueous solution was added dropwise to activated carbon at the room temperature. After stirring 12 h, the mixture was separated by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum. Lastly, the mixture was reduced in H2 flow by the same method as above and the product was obtained and labelled as AgCo@C."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a DX-3 diffractometer (Puxi) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, with a scan speed of 2θ = 1°/min from 4° to 90°. The TGA curves were collected on TGA/DSC 3+STARe system (Mettler Toledo) under an N2 flow with heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined by autosorb iQ/AsiQwin analyzer (Quantachrome). Before the adsorption, the samples were degassed at 120 °C for 8 h. The specific surface areas were calculated by the multipoint BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) method and the pore size distribution were calculated by the DFT (discrete Fourier transform) method. The Co and Ag content of the samples were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry on Aglient 5100 ICP-OES. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired by Talos F200x instruments with a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (HRTEM-EDX, Oxford INCA). And the mean particle diameters were calculated by counting ~200 particles from the TEM images. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected on scan electronic microscopy (JSM-6701F), which was used to observe the morphology of the prepared samples. Surface electronic states were test by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 Xi). The binding energy was calibrated for surface charging by using the contaminant carbon (C1s = 284.8 eV) as a reference. The Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw Dispersive System equipped with a laser excitation wave length of 532 nm. Temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) was obtained in a quartz reactor connected to a TCD with H2/Ar mixture (30 mL min−1, 10% of H2 by volume) as a reducing gas. Temperature programmed desorption of H2 (H2-TPD) cuvers were obtained by Micromeritics-Auto-Chem II 2920 Chemisorption Analyzer. Before the analysis, the samples (about 50 mg) were flushed by pure nitrogen at 120 °C for 30 min and then natural cooling in nitrogen atmosphere."
5,Catalyst measurements,"2.4 Catalyst measurements The selective hydrogenation reaction of citral was performed in a micro high pressure hydrogenation reactor (Beijing Century Senlang). First of all, 40 mg catalyst, 300 uL citral, 150 uL N-dodecane and 15 mL ethanol were add to the hydrogenation reactor. Afterwards, the air was removed by purging and bleeding five times under the pressure of 1.0 MPa H2. Then, the reactor was put in a heating jacket and heated to the reaction temperature. Finally, 1.0 MPa H2 was injected and the reaction system was initiated by starting stirring at a speed of 400 rpm to eliminate the diffusion effect. After the reaction, a small amount of mixed liquid was collected and filtrated by oil film. It was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC 7820A) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS 7890B-5977A). The injector temperature was 300 °C and the detector column temperature was increased from 80 to 300 °C. Compared with the average data of three repeated measurements, the analysis error was between 0.1 and 2.0%.The conversion (Conv.), selectivity (Sel.) and yield data for the reaction were calculated by the following: (1) Conversion % = 1 - moles of residual citral moles of initial citral × 100 % (2) Selectivity % = moles of product moles of reacted citral × 100 % (3) Yield % = Conversion % × Selectivity % × 100 %"
6,Reusability and recyclability test of 6AgCo@C-510 NPs for the chemoselective hydrogenation of citral,"2.5 Reusability and recyclability test of 6AgCo@C-510 NPs for the chemoselective hydrogenation of citral The reusability test of the catalysts was conducted according to the reported literature [32]. The used catalyst was conveniently recovered through a magnet after the complete of the first hydrogenation reaction, and then washed three times with ethanol to remove impurities. For recyclability test, hydrogenation reactions were repeated ten times by putting in the same reactant and internal standard each times after the previous cycle."
7,Kinetic studies of chemoselective hydrogenation of citral catalyzed by 6AgCo@C-510 and Co@C-510 NPs,"2.6 Kinetic studies of chemoselective hydrogenation of citral catalyzed by 6AgCo@C-510 and Co@C-510 NPs A set of reactions were performed at different reaction time (20, 40, 60, and 80 min). The H2 pressure, mass of catalyst and reactant were kept the same (1 MPa, 40 mg, 300 uL) to investigate the rate law of the chemoselective hydrogenation. Afterwards, the reaction temperature was performed at 60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C to get the activation energy (Ea). For the sake of comparison, Co@C-510 was tested by the same method."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Synthesis and microstructure of xAgCo@C,"3.1 Synthesis and microstructure of xAgCo@C In this work, Co-MOF containing different Ag contents was synthesized by one-pot method and used as a template to further synthesize the xAgCo@C composites. It is evident that the diffraction peaks of Co-MOF match well with the simulated Co-MOF, demonstrating that the well-defined structure of Co-MOF is obtained (curves simulation and a, Fig. 1 ). After adding different Ag content by one-pot method, the similar diffraction peaks in xAg/Co-MOF crystal are still observed, meaning the main structure of Co-MOF is not affected by the addition of Ag ions (curves b, c, d, e and f, Fig. 1). However, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution profiles of xAg/Co-MOF present different curve types (Fig. S1a) to that of Co-MOF. Although all of the Co-MOF and xAg/Co-MOF samples exhibit type I isotherm, which is characteristic of microporous structure, the xAg/Co-MOF samples show H4-type hysteresis loop, which could be ascribed to materials that have both microporous and mesoporous structures. It indicates that Ag ions are incorporated into the pores of the MOF, causing the reduction of the proportion of micropores. And the relative adsorption amount gradually increases along with the rise in pressure, indicating that the number of larger pores is increased. The increase can be observed by the pore size distribution curve which analyzed by the NLDFT algorithm (Fig. S1b). The BET surface areas are 1004, 782, 617, 554, 443, and 418 m2 g−1 corresponding to Co-MOF, 2Ag/Co-MOF, 4Ag/Co-MOF, 6Ag/Co-MOF, 8Ag/Co-MOF and 10Ag/Co-MOF, respectively. Compared with bare Co-MOF, the specific surface area of xAg/Co-MOF decreases greatly as the Ag increases (Table S1). This proves that Ag nanoparticles have been successfully introduced into the Co-MOF support. The xAgCo@C composites were obtained by direct pyrolysis of xAg/Co-MOF under the flow of N2. During this process, the ligands of Co-MOF (DOBDC) were gradually decomposed, while the Ag+ and Co2+ ion were reduced to elemental Ag and Co by the carbon layer produced during pyrolysis. The XRD patterns of the xAgCo@C-510, in which the diffraction peaks are well matched with the Ag standard card (JCPDS card no. 04–0783, space group Fm-3m(2 2 5)). The peak values at 38.2°, 44.3°, 64.4°, and 77.5° are attributed into the characteristic peaks of the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) crystal planes of Ag respectively (Fig. 2 a). Similarly, the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.6° can be clearly assigned to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) crystal planes of Co metal (JCPDS card no. 15-0806, space group Fm-3m(2 2 5)). That means the Ag+ and Co2+ ions are in situ reduced to elemental Ag and Co without adding additional reducing agent. Furthermore, as the Ag content increases, the diffraction peak of Ag becomes sharper and the diffraction peak of Co becomes weaker gradually, indicating that the Co-MOF is incorporated by different Ag content during the one-pot synthesis. Surprisingly, it is clear that two diffraction peaks of Ag (1 1 1) and Co (1 1 1) were shift to a low angle degree (Fig. 2b). According to the Bragg equation, the interplanar spacing is inversely proportional to the θ angle. Such decrease in angle means that the interplanar spacing increases, that is, the Co and Ag elements are intermixed, thus demonstrating the formation of the alloy. In order to understand the exact calcination temperature for the best catalytic consequent, a set of thermogravimetric experiments was carried out. As shown in the TGA curve (Fig. 3 ), the framework of xAg/Co-MOF began to decompose at about 240 °C and completely thermal decomposed at around 570 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. The thermogravimetric loss was nearly 36% before 450 °C, which corresponded to the mass percentage of the external and internal guest molecule, such as crystal water, EtOH and DMF of the Co-MOF structure in the theory (37%). When the temperature exceeded 450 °C, the metal cations were gradually reduced to the metallic NPs by the ligand-derived carbon layer until the temperature reached 570 °C, which can be observed by XRD (Fig. 4 ). Then, the prepared 6Ag/Co-MOF precursor was pyrolyzed around pyrolysis temperature, such as 450, 480, 510, 540 and 570 °C, to produce the final 6AgCo@C-T composites. As suggested by Fig. 4, the XRD patterns of 6AgCo@C-T exhibit characteristic Ag NP and Co NP diffraction peaks at high pyrolysis temperatures, and the diffraction peaks of CoO gradually disappear while the diffraction peaks of Co appear and become distinct with increasing calcination temperature. It indicates that cobalt oxide is gradually reduced with increasing temperature. There are no diffraction peaks of Ag2O. This is because Ag is more easily reduced by ligand-derived carbon matrix due to its lower reduction potential than Co. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of 6AgCo@C-T displayed a type-IV curves which presented obvious hysteresis loops in the range of P/P0 from 0.5 to 1.0 (Fig. 5 ), indicating the existence of mesopore structures in these samples. In addition, the BET surface area of the 6AgCo@C-450, 6AgCo@C-480, 6AgCo@C-510, 6AgCo@C-540, and 6AgCo@C-570 are calculated to be 318 m2 g−1, 307 m2 g−1, 291 m2 g−1, 285 m2 g−1, and 257 m2 g−1, respectively. It means that as the calcination temperature increases, the micropores disappear and the proportion of mesopores increases gradually (Table S2). The carbonaceous structure of the 6AgCo@C-T was further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 6 ). The two peaks centered around at 1350 and 1588 cm−1 are observed in all of the samples, which are attributed to the D band and G band of the disordered and graphitized carbons respectively. Furthermore, the D band commonly corresponds to the breathing vibrations of sp2 rings, characterizing A1g symmetry disallowed in graphite or the double resonance Raman process in disordered carbon, whereas the G band refers to graphite lattice in-plane vibration mode with E2g symmetry [33]. Generally, the graphitization degree of carbonaceous materials can be evaluated by the intensity ratio of the D band to G band (ID/IG). All of the samples exhibit significant graphitization (ID/IG < 0.9) and the degree of graphitization increases with the temperature of the calcination (Table S2). In order to observe the surface electronic interaction between Co and Ag atom, the XPS spectral analysis of 6AgCo@C-510 was performed (Fig. 7 a). For comparison, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Co@C-510 is also shown in Fig. 7b. The doublets of Ag3d region of the 6AgCo@C-510 catalyst have a spin-orbit splitting of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 state of ca. 6.0 eV which is matched with the relative binding energy of metallic Ag (Fig. 7c), developing a chemical shift of 0.3 eV compared to its standard values (368.2 eV). The binding energy of the Co2p level of Co@C-510 (Fig. 7d) and 6AgCo@C-510 (Fig. 7e) are 778.1 and 778.4 eV, respectively. Comparing the relative binding energy of Co and Ag, it can be found that metal Co transfers partial electrons to Ag, resulting in Ag electron-enriched and Co electron–deficient in the AgCo alloy NPs. Due to the abundant electrons on the surface of Ag, the negatively charged metal Ag can polarize the CO double bond in the citral molecule, resulting in the increase of the selectivity for the hydrogenation reaction. Surprisingly, it is found from XPS spectra that the content of Ag, Co, O, and C is 1.2%, 9.3%, 5.5%, and 84.0%, respectively in 6AgCo@C-510. It can be seen the content of carbon is much higher and the content of the metals is lower than the total elemental contents measured by elemental and ICP analyses (Ag: 9.6% Co: 48.7% C: 40.0%). It further demonstrates the AgCo alloy NPs are protected by the carbon layer, since XPS is used to detect the element composition of the surface (5–10 molecular layers) of materials. To confirm that the metal nanoparticles in the catalyst were reduced in situ to element by MOFs pyrolysis process, Temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) profiles of the AgCo@C, 6Ag/Co@C-510, Co@C-510 and 6AgCo@C-510 catalysts were depicted in Fig. 8 . The H2-TPR cuver of AgCo@C shows two distinct peaks which are assigned to the typical hydrogen reduction profiles of cobalt oxide [34–35]. The first peak is the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, and the second peak is the reduction of CoO to the metallic cobalt. The ratio of the peak area at higher temperature to that at the lower temperature is equal to the theoretical ratio of 1:3. Although the samples were reduced by hydrogen, they still showed significant oxide peaks, which indicated the fact that the metal nanoparticles of the AgCo@C were not encapsulated by the carbon layer. However, the two-stage reduction is not suitable to the catalysts derived from MOF. Obviously, only a weak peak centered at 185 °C was observed for Co@C-510 catalysts, which confirmed that few Co NPs were oxidized, and most of Co NPs in carbon layer were metallic and did not oxidize after the MOF pyrolysis process. And there was a broad H2 consumption peak after 400 °C followed by the weak peak at 185 °C. This may be due to the collapse of unstable structures of MOF-derived carbon-based catalysts at high temperatures under a H2 atmosphere [36]. After loading Ag ions on Co@C-510 by impregnation method, two weak peaks appeared at similar situations for 6Ag/Co@C-510. It can be interpreted as part of the Co NPs being oxidized during impregnation. However, for 6AgCo@C-510 that incorporating Ag+ by one-pot method, no obvious reduction peak appeared before 400 °C, which can be explained by following. It is known that Co2+ with lower reduction potentials (ø 0(Co2+/Co) = 0.28 eV) cannot be directly completely reduced during the MOF pyrolysis process. The Ag+ with high reduction potential of 0.80 eV vs. SHE can be firstly reduced during the MOF pyrolysis process to form the Ag nanoparticles, which in situ generated the Ag-H species with strong reducing ability to induce the continuous growth of the Co NPs, forming the AgCo alloy nanoparticles [37–39]. 6AgCo@C-510 catalyst also displays broad peak after 400 °C which can be explained by the same reason as Co@C-510. Furthermore, the catalysts were evaluated bv H2-TPD since the hydrogen chemical adsorption–desorption behavior plays an key role in chemselective hydrogenation reactions. Considering that the reaction temperature is lower than 200 °C in the experiment, the H2-TPD experiments were performed between 50 and 200 °C. From the profiles in Fig. 9 , four samples showed a peak from 50 °C to 130 °C. Typically, the temperature of the H2 desorption peak is increased in different samples: 6AgCo@C-510 < Co@C-510 < 6Ag/Co@C-510 < AgCo@C, indicating that hydrogen molecules are more easily desorbed on 6AgCo@C-510. These results suggest that 6AgCo@C-510 has the best ability to activate hydrogen. For better understanding the structural details of the 6AgCo@C-510, SEM, TEM, and HAADF-STEM characterizations were performed. As revealed by SEM images (Fig. S2), the morphology of Ag(I)-doped Co-MOF shows well-defined hexagonal prism crystals, which is very similar as that of Co-MOF. It suggests that Ag-doping did not affect the morphology of Co-MOF. This is also consistent with the XRD result. After pyrolysis treatment, 6AgCo@C-510 still exhibited similar sizes and shapes as the parent MOFs. However, the surface of 6AgCo@C-510 become fairly rougher with a large number of loose porous structures appearing, which was consistent with the N2 physical adsorption test result. And the loose porous structures in catalysts are thought to be beneficial to mass transfer during reaction processes. As shown in Fig. 10 a, the metal NPs of 6AgCo@C-510 is uniformly distributed with a size of 7–9 nm. Further HRTEM image (Fig. 10e) indicated that the spherical nanoparticles are tightly packaged and well dispersed in the carbon shells derived from the ligand with a typical distance value of graphite (0.343 nm), which was consistent with the results of Raman analysis. Meanwhile, the porous graphene shell sizes of 6AgCo@C-510 composites are about 7 nm, which can prevent metal nanoparticles from leaching during the catalytic reaction. The AgCo NPs in the 6AgCo@C-510 composites exhibit distinct lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.204 nm and 0.239 nm in the selected particle, indicating the high crystallinity of the alloy NPs (Fig. 10f). The spacings are consistent with the (1 1 1) lattice plane of the metallic Co (0.205 nm) and the (1 1 1) lattice plane of the metallic Ag (0.236 nm) respectively. In addition, the HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding EDX mappings showed that the Co and Ag elements were well-proportionally dispersed in the same area that can directly confirm the alloy structure of AgCo NPs. Furthermore, the TEM images and the corresponding size distributions of comparative samples prepared by different methods reveal that the preparation methods play a key role on the sizes of AgCo alloy nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 10b, the mean size of nanoparticles is about 12.8 nm in 6Ag/Co@C-510 prepared by impregnating Ag ions on Co@C-510, and it can be clearly observed that Ag NPs aggregate on the sample in darker part. This appearance becomes more obvious on AgCo@C which was prepared by depositing AgCo NPs on activated carbon. The mean size of alloy nanoparticles increased from 7.5 nm to 29 nm in contrast to nanoparticles obtained by calcination MOF by one-pot method (Fig. 10c). The difference in particle size of metal alloys can be explained by the following. For the synthetic method by Ag/Co-MOF precursor in which the metal ions are orderly separated by organic ligands, the ligands can gradually transform into a carbon matrix and encloses the in situ generated metal particles in a restricted area during the pyrolysis process. Therefore, the AgCo alloy with small particle size can be formed. On the contrary, for the AgCo alloy supported on the activated carbon by impregnation method, the metal ions tend to accumulate in the pores of the activated carbon and then aggregate during the high temperature reduction process."
10,Catalytic activities of various catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic activities of various catalysts The selective hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols was employed to evaluate the catalytic activities of xAgCo@C-T. The catalytic results were summarized in Table 1 . For the catalysts contain different Ag content, the conversion of citral increased when the silver content went up to 6% and then decreased as content being further increased (Table 1, entry 1–5). It might be due to the agglomeration after the increase of Ag content, leading to a decrease in catalyst activity. Conversion of citral reached 99.6% when silver nitrate loading was 6%. Overall, the selectivity of unsaturated alcohols was above 60%. For the catalysts with different calcination temperature, the conversion of citral increased with increase of the calcination temperature (Table 1, entry 3, and 6–9). However, the selectivity of unsaturated alcohols showed the opposite. The selectivity of unsaturated alcohols declined from 71.3% to 47.2%. The catalytic performances of 6Ag/Co@C-510 and AgCo@C prepared by impregnation method have been tested and compared with that of 6AgCo@C-510. As listed in Table 1 (entry 10 and 11), the 6Ag/Co@C-510 catalyst shows a conversion rate of 88.4% and a selectivity of 53.5% for the selective hydrogenation of citral, and AgCo@C shows 36.6% and 35.0%, respectively. The poorer catalytic performance of them might be due to the fact that the agglomeration of AgCo nanoparticles occurs more easily in the impregnation synthesized method. In all cases, 6AgCo@C-510 exhibted the best catalytic performance (nearly full conversion of citral and 70% selectivity for unsaturated alcohols) among the catalysts, which is comparable to precious metal catalysts reported in other literature (Table 1, entry 12 and 13) [6,16,40]. Various influencing factors of the reaction including temperature, H2 pressure and time were investigated to optimize the reaction conditions. The influence of reaction temperature on the selective hydrogenation of citral was studied for 6AgCo@C-510 and the results were depicted in Fig. 11 a. It could be observed that the conversion of citral sharply increase from 27% to 100% with increasing temperature until 90 °C. Afterwards, the conversion remained unchanged. However, with an increase in reaction temperatures from 60 °C to 120 °C, the unsaturated alcohols selectivity rose from 58% to 69% and then reduced to 34%, indicating that the selective conversion of citral to unsaturated alcohol is a low temperature favorable reaction. And the selectivity of citronellal and citronellol changed in opposite ways. The selectivity of citronellol increased from 20% to 66% while that of citronellal declined from 21% to 0%. The effect of H2 pressure on the catalytic activity was recorded in Fig. 11b. With the increase of hydrogen pressure from 0.5 MPa to 4 MPa, the conversion also went up from 18% to 100%. It is suggested that the increase of hydrogen pressure is beneficial to the conversion. However, the unsaturated alcohols selectivity reduced from 77% to 28%, indicating that the selective conversion of citral to unsaturated alcohol is a low hydrogen pressure favorable reaction. In contrast, the selectivity of citronellol increased from 9.7% to 72%. That might be further hydrogenations of the CC bond in unsaturated alcohols give citronellol in the high condition. With reaction time being extended to 60 min, citral almost completely reacted (Fig. 11c). The unsaturated alcohols selectivity changed slightly. At the same time, the selectivity of citronellol increased and the selectivity of citronellal declined. This result indicates that the reaction time mainly affects the conversion rate without affecting the selectivity of the reaction. From the above reaction conditions, we know that the optimal reaction condition is 1 MPa H2, 80 °C and 60 min."
11,Recyclability of the catalyst,"3.3 Recyclability of the catalyst Reusability of 6AgCo@C-510 was investigated and results are depicted in Fig. 12 . After ten cycles, the yield of the conversion of citral remained at 100% without any decrease and the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols was also not changed. For comparison, catalytic cycle test was also carried out on 6Ag/Co@C-510. Different from the 6AgCo@C-510, the conversion started to decrease in the first run and decreased to around 60% after five runs with 6Ag/Co@C-510 as the catalyst. This might be the instability of Ag loading on Co@C-510 by impregnation method, which could be seen in the Fig. 10b. The decrease in activity is attributed to a possible agglomeration or loss of metal nanoparticles upon prolonged stirring of the reaction mixture. In the 6AgCo@C-510 catalyst, metal nanoparticles were protected by mesoporous carbon, thus the catalyst was not activated."
12,Kinetic study of citral selective hydrogenation network,"3.4 Kinetic study of citral selective hydrogenation network Due to the complexity of catalytic selective hydrogenation of citral with the multi-products, the kinetic features on both reactant and product should be carefully surveyed in order to deepen the understanding on whole catalytic network. For the sake of comparison, the kinetic measurements were performed by choosing 6AgCo@C-510 and Co@C-510 as contrast samples. The concentration change of citral (reactant) and unsaturated alcohols (target product) were focused to estimate the kinetic feature of reaction network following the reaction rate equations below. r = - d c d t = k × c m × p H 2 n = K × c m 1 ln K = ln A - E a / R T In which, r means the reaction rate, c means the concentration of unsaturated alcohols, t means reaction time, m and n are the reaction order for citral and H2, and k means rate constant. K means the rate constant for the simplified reaction rate equation by assuming that p(H2) was slightly changed during reaction in view of the high pressure of H2. A means pre-exponential coefficient, Ea means apparent reaction activation energy, R is gas constant and T represents the reaction temperature. Based on the catalytic measurement results at 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C, the kinetic dependencies obtained over 6AgCo@C-510 catalyst were given in Fig. 13 a. Similarly, Ea was determined by plotting natural log of rate constants against reciprocal of temperature for the Co@C-510 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 13c. It was worth pointing out that Co@C-510 catalyst was inactive at temperatures below 80 °C and the apparent activation energy was measured at 70 °C, 80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C. The obtained straight line of lnk = 4.63(1000/T)–21.12 with a R2 of 0.99 can translate to an Ea of ca. 39.1 kJ mol−1 over 6AgCo@C-510 catalyst. The much lower Ea than Co@C-510 catalyst (76.7 kJ mol−1) confirmed the positive synergetic effect between Co and Ag metals on the 6AgCo@C-510 for the selective hydrogenation of citral to UAs (Table 2 )."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, a highly efficient and cost-effective AgCo@C catalyst system has been developed for the selective hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols (nerol and geraniol). The catalyst exhibited remarkable selective hydrogenation activity of citral to unsaturated alcohols, which is comparable to the reported Ru and Re catalysts. The lower activation energy (Ea) (39.1 kJ mol−1 for 6Ag/Co@C-510 vs. 76.7 kJ mol−1 for Co@C-510) suggested the strong positive synergistic effect between Ag and Co. Additionally, the catalyst showed good recyclability and magnetically reusability. Thus it is believed that the AgCo alloy-based catalyst has great potential in industrial application for the production of nerol and geraniol from citral."
