0,Introduction,"A very important point for the economic use of precious metal catalysts is its recovery, besides refining and recycling of the metal. This procedure is simplified by the use of a support for the metals. The final catalytic properties of supported metal catalysts depend on the combination of the type of metal and supportive material [1]. It was reported that effect of support on reforming activity and selectivity of the catalyst is greater than the effect of metal dispersion on the support [2]. The high cost of noble metal catalysts makes it necessary to optimize their catalytic yield and to maximize the dispersion of the metal component on an appropriate support. Carbon-supported platinum catalysts have been recognized as active catalysts for aqueous-phase reforming of biomass-derived compounds for hydrogen-rich gas production [1]. Activated carbon is a material that has all the required characteristics to be used as a catalyst support and additionally it has unique properties like its stability in both acidic and basic media [3–5]. Use of activated carbon as the support for noble metals, rather than other supports (e.g. silica, alumina) facilitates recovery of the metal, which is achieved by simply burning the catalyst [6]. It is well known from literature that porous structure and surface chemistry of activated carbon support highly affect the activity of the catalyst [7,8]. The oxygen-containing functional groups (also denoted as surface oxides) were widely recognized and the most common species formed on the surface of carbons, which significantly influenced their performance in catalytic reactions [4]. Among the many different activating agents that were used in activation process of carbon, the most frequent ones are phosphoric acid and sodium and potassium hydroxides [9]. It was found that modification of the pitch-based activated carbon fibers with nitric acid caused formation of carboxyl acid groups on the surface and the number of them decreased while the lactone and ketone groups increased after sodium hydroxide treatment [10]. The supercritical fluid (SCF) deposition technique has been used to prepare nanoparticles of a wide variety of metals especially precious metals. This process involves the dissolution of a metallic precursor in a supercritical fluid in presence of a support. After adsorption of the precursor onto the support, the metallic precursor is converted to its metal form by chemical or thermal reduction [11–14]. An SCF exhibits an attractive combination of the solvent properties of a gas and a liquid. The gas-like diffusivity and viscosity of SCF favor rapid diffusion and permeation, while its liquid-like density allows for dissolution of a wide range of organometallic precursors. A wide variety of solvents are available for use as supercritical fluids including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ethane, propane, n-pentane, ammonia, and water. CO2 has its critical point at 31.1 °C and 73 atm, therefore it can easily be elevated to supercritical conditions without using excess energy. Supercritical carbon dioxide is particularly attractive since it is environmentally friendly and safe because of its low toxicity, low reactivity and nonflammability. CO2 leaves no residue in the processed product because of its gaseous character near ambient conditions. In this study, a commercial activated carbon material exposed to different chemical treatments for use of a catalyst support for preparation of Pt loaded catalyst for hydrogen-rich gas production from glucose, a biomass-derived carbohydrate model compound, by gasification in aqueous media. Surface modification of activated carbon by chemical treatments was applied to enhance the attachment and anchoring of nano-sized Pt particles on the support. Surface modification of activated carbon was carried out using two different weak acids (CH3COOH and H3PO4), one strong acid (HCl) and one strong base (KOH). The Pt loading on activated carbon supports was performed in supercritical carbon dioxide media and impregnation in aqueous medium. Pt metals were reduced by heat treatment and/or use of NaBH4 which is common reducing agent for preparation of platinum catalysts because of its strong reduction ability at low temperature [15]."
1,Experimental,"Activated carbon support (AC) used in the study was provided from Norit Corp. (Elorit 8028-0). The AC was chemically treated with KOH, HCl, CH3COOH and H3PO4 to obtain different porous and surface structure of catalyst support. All chemicals used in this study were either analytical or reagent grade."
2,Chemical treatment of activated carbon support,"2.1 Chemical treatment of activated carbon support The 30 g AC was mixed with 90 ml of 3.0 M KOH, HCl, CH3COOH or H3PO4 and refluxed at 75–80 °C for 3 h. Following filtration the treated AC was dried at 110 °C in a vacuum oven and then heated to 700 °C in inert atmosphere for 3 h before use as a support for deposition of Pt metals. Infrared spectra of samples were obtained by Perkin Elmer Spectrum RX-I FTIR System. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of AC samples were taken using a Leo-Evo 40 instrument. Surface area and porosity of treated samples were determined by using a Quantachrome-Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer. The Leco CHNS-932 instrument was used for elemental composition analysis of the samples."
3,Deposition of Pt particles on chemical treated and untreated AC supports,"2.2 Deposition of Pt particles on chemical treated and untreated AC supports 2.2.1 Deposition in supercritical carbon dioxide media Deposition of Pt particles on AC supports was performed using modified method described by Bayrakceken et al. [13]. The AC samples were placed into a pouch made out of filter paper. The pouch was placed into Parr 4740 model 70 ml HT/HP reactor together with the dimethyl(1,5-cyclooctadiene)platinum(II) (PtMe2COD) precursor corresponding to 8 wt.% Pt and a stirring bar. A stainless steel cage was used to separate the stirring bar from the filter paper pouch. The reactor was sealed and heated to 80 °C and pressurized to 27.58 MPa with CO2 using ISCO 260D pump. Organometallic precursor has high solubility in this supercritical carbon dioxide condition [12]. The reactor was kept in this condition for 24 h and then allowed to cool before depressurized. The samples were placed in an alumina process tube [25.4 mm(external diameter) × 19.25 mm(internal diameter) × 457.2 mm(length)] within a furnace (TF55035C-1 model Thermo Scientific Lindberg Blue M), and the precursor was reduced thermally under flowing H2 for 6 h at 300 °C. The Pt/AC catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 2010 HRTEM. The amount of Pt deposited on AC support was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Spectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer Optima 7000 DV instrument. The samples were burned in a furnace at 500 °C for 4 h to remove carbon. The solid residue left was dissolved in 90 ml of HCl:HNO3 mixture (v/v; 1:1) and refluxed at 90 °C for 4 h before analysis in ICP. 2.2.2 Impregnation in aqueous media Catalysts were prepared via the incipient wetness impregnation method aiming for 8 wt.% Pt on the AC using precursor salt, platinum (IV) chloride (Sigma–Aldrich, +99%). The platinum salt was dissolved in 20 ml water/methanol (v/v, 50/50) mixture and AC added into solution. The mixture was mixed for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 10 ml 0.20 M NaBH4 was added drop by drop to reduce Pt metal on AC. The solvent was evaporated by mixing and heating the solution. The catalyst was dried at 110 °C before use. To achieve reduction of platinum metals on AC thermal reduction was also applied after NaBH4 treatment as described above in Section 2.2.1. In some experiments, impregnation of platinum salt on AC carried out in 20 ml of ethylene glycol/water solution (v/v, 70/30) instead of water–methanol mixture for obtaining a finely dispersed AC supported Pt catalyst with a narrow particle-size distribution [16]."
4,Gasification in aqueous media,"2.3 Gasification in aqueous media Gasification was performed in a Parr 4590 model 100 ml stainless steel micro bench reactor equipped with magnetic drive stirrer and a temperature controller system (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL). The 50 ml of 0.056 M glucose solution was placed in the reactor and 0.12 g of Pt on AC catalyst was added. The reactor was sealed and air inside reactor was purged with argon. The reactor was heated with a rate of 4.7 °C/min upto 250 °C and gasification was continued for 2 h at this temperature. The pressure inside the reactor was 34–41 × 105 Pa during gasification process. After 2 h reaction time, the reactor was taken out of the heating system and rapidly quenched in a water bath. The gas mixture in the reactor was collected into gas buret that was filled with water and the volume of gas mixture produced was measured by water displacement. All APR experiments were performed in triplicate."
5,Gas analysis,"2.4 Gas analysis All gaseous products were analyzed by a dual-channel gas chromatograph (GC) system equipped with two thermal conductivity detectors (Varian-450 GC, Varian Inc., Netherlands). One channel was used with argon carrier to obtain good sensitivity and linearity for hydrogen and the second one with helium carrier for detection of other gases (CO, CO2, alkanes etc). The columns used in hydrogen and other gases channels were MolSieve 5A 1 m × 1/8"" Ultimetal and Shincarbon 100/120 mesh 2 m × 1/16"" × 1 mm, respectively. The triplicate gas mixture (250 μl) was injected into GC with 1:3 split injection mode via SSL injector in helium carrier gas channel. Oven temperature settings were as follows: 3 min at 40 °C; from 40 °C to 230 °C with 8 °C/min heating rate and maintained at this temperature for 5 min. Inlet temperature was 230 °C and filament was at 300 °C. The standard gas mixture was obtained from Elite Gaz Teknolojileri (Istanbul, Turkey). The composition of gas mixture based on mole percent was 1.80 ± 0.04 acetylene, 4.00 ± 0.08 ethylene, 3.90 ± 0.08 ethane, 4.90 ± 0.10 methane, 16.00 ± 0.32 carbon monoxide, 22.00 ± 0.44 carbon dioxide and balance amount of hydrogen (47.40 ± 0.47)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of chemical treated activated carbon samples,"3.1 Characterization of chemical treated activated carbon samples The activated carbon (AC) was exposed to chemical treatment using various chemicals (H3PO4, CH3COOH, HCl and KOH). The samples after treatment had different physical properties. The physical structure characterization results of ACs treated with different chemicals were illustrated in Table 1 . The total surface areas of KOH, HCl and CH3COOH treated AC samples increased compared to original (untreated-as received) one. However, opposite trend was observed in case use of H3PO4 in the treatment method. The use of KOH caused highest total surface area and pore volume while H3PO4 resulted in lowest values for both parameters. There was no significant difference in average pore size between treated and untreated AC samples. SEM images indicated the changes in the morphological structure of AC before and after treatment with KOH (Fig. 1 ). The porous structure of untreated activated carbon increased after treatment and left highly degraded porous solids. The FTIR spectra of chemical treated AC samples are shown in Fig. 2 . The spectra indicate the chemical changes occurred in the activated carbons after treatment, before Pt deposition process (Fig. 2a) and after Pt deposition process (Fig. 2b). The absorption around 1200–1000 cm−1 associated with the existence of C–O single bond in carboxylic acids, alcohols, phenols, and esters [17,18]. The band in the region of 1600 cm−1 has been observed by many authors and has not been interpreted unequivocally. This has been assigned to aromatic ring stretching coupled to highly conjugated carbonyl groups (CO) [19]. The remarkable bands at around 2920 cm−1 in Fig. 2b ascribed to the C–H stretching in methyl and methylene groups [18]. The absorption band observed at around 3450 cm−1 is assigned to O–H stretching vibrations of surface hydroxylic groups (Fig. 2a). The relative intensity of this band decreased markedly or completely disappeared after Pt deposition process was applied. In HCl-treated AC sample O–H band was still existed with lower intensity after Pt loading (Fig. 2b). The intensity of the O–H peaks suggests that the content of O–H in chemical treated AC samples before Pt deposition process is much higher and this is true especially for HCl, H3PO4 and CH3COOH treated ones. Fig. 3 shows possible oxygenated groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, quinone, hydroxyl and lactone groups might existed on activated carbon structure after chemical treatments."
8,Comparison of activities of AC supported Pt catalysts,"3.2 Comparison of activities of AC supported Pt catalysts 3.2.1 Effect of deposition method Pt on AC catalysts were developed by deposition of the metal on untreated activated carbon support using nanotechnological approaches in supercritical carbon dioxide media (ScCO2) and impregnation in aqueous media (IMP). According to TEM images of the catalysts prepared, metal particles deposited on AC in ScCO2 had smaller sizes than those prepared by IMP in aqueous media (Fig. 4 ). Besides, distribution of Pt particles on AC was more uniform with well dispersion in ScCO2. The use of prepared catalysts in gasification of glucose showed that activities of the catalysts for yield and selectivity of hydrogen production varied with deposition method used as well as reduction method applied (Table 2 ). 3.2.2 Effect of reduction method Performing Pt reduction with NaBH4 followed thermal process resulted in more active catalysts than one prepared by only thermal reduction (Table 2). It is known from literature that heat treatment of carbon could increase carbon hydrophobicity by removing hydrophilic surface functionalities, particularly various acidic groups [20–22]. The use of H2 in heat treatment could effectively stabilize the carbon surface by deactivation of active sites (i.e., forming stable C–H bonds) found at the edges of the crystallites [20]. The use of NaBH4 in platinum reduction process caused formation of residual hydroxyl functional groups on the support that was determined by taken infrared spectra of the catalysts [23]. It was reported that depending on concentration of NaBH4 carbonyl groups on the activated carbon surface are first transformed into C–O bonds (hydroxyl groups), while some carboxyl groups are partially removed. At high NaBH4 concentration all of the carbonyl groups are nearly removed, and the C–O bonds are reduced as well [24]. The reduction of a carbonyl group by NaBH4 was illustrated in the reaction below. Pt catalysts prepared by deposition of the metal on AC in ScCO2 media exhibited better activity than impregnation in aqueous media in case of thermal reduction method was applied. However, Pt catalyst prepared by IMP and performing reduction with NaBH4 followed heat treatment showed best activity for hydrogen production. The use of ethylene glycol resulted in catalyst that had similar activity as one prepared in ScCO2 medium followed sequential NaBH4 and thermal reduction methods. It has been reported that reaction of ethylene glycol with NaBH4 forms a complex reducing agent and has performed roles as both a reducing agent for Pt reduction and a stabilizer for the reduced Pt nanoparticles with a narrow particle-size and fine dispersion [16,25]. Therefore, the use of ethylene glycol in impregnation method prevented metal growth and allowing to disperse the reduced Pt particles on AC support that was observed from TEM images however, catalytic activity was not improved significantly. The reason of the lower performance of ScCO2–Pt–NaBH4 + T catalyst compared to IMP–Pt–NaBH4 + T could be attributed to deposition of Pt particles in narrow pores inside the AC support of ScCO2–Pt–NaBH4 + T, which made the organic substrate inaccessible to react with Pt particles. ICP results showed that amount of Pt loading in both media was almost same. For instance, dissolved Pt from IMP–Pt–NaBH4 + T and ScCO2–Pt–NaBH4 + T catalysts found to be 7.5 ± 1.3% and 7.7 ± 1.8%, respectively. 3.2.3 Effect of chemical treatment In this section of the study, KOH, HCl, CH3COOH and H3PO4 treated AC samples were used as catalyst supports for deposition of Pt metals. The prepared catalysts were evaluated for hydrogen-rich gas production activity. The hydrogen selectivity and activity of thermal reduction method applied Pt catalysts on chemical treated AC were differed based on chemicals used (Table 3 ). The catalyst having KOH treated support that was most degraded catalyst support with highest total surface area exhibited lowest activity (4.0 mmol H2/g catalyst) among all supercritical carbon dioxide deposition method applied catalysts. Hydrogen production activity of H3PO4, CH3COOH and HCl treated AC containing catalysts were 11, 14 and 12 mmol H2/g catalyst, respectively. In addition to O–H, CO and C–O situated in acids, phenols, ethers or esters phosphoric acid treated activated carbon can have P-containing structures like acid phosphates and polyphosphates. These structural differences can highly affect Pt deposition and catalyst activity compared to other types of chemicals. The low activity of H3PO4 and KOH treated supported catalysts can attributed to presence of bulk polar groupings. These groups around the entrances to the pores with entrapped metal particles amplify the metal blocking and make a part of the metal particles inaccessible to organic molecules even if the dimensions of the pores exceed considerably the size of the molecules [7]. Hydrogen production activity and selectivity significantly decreased when impregnation method was used for Pt deposition except HCl treated support containing catalyst (Table 3). The activity of Pt on HCl treated AC was almost same for both deposition methods. The use of sequential reduction methods multiplied activity of the catalysts prepared by IMP (Table 4 ). The steep increase in activity was observed in case of CH3COOH (46 mmol H2/g catalyst) and HCl (56 mmol H2/g catalyst) treated supports were used. In the reported studies, acid treatment was generally used to oxidize the porous carbon surface; it enhanced the acidic properties by introduction of surface-bound polar hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups for subsequent anchoring and reductive conversion of precursor metal ions to metal nanoparticles [26]. The recent study showed that acetic acid modified carbon had more microporous structure, narrower Pt particle-size distribution, sufficient carbonyl functional groups on surface [27]. Some researchers reported that increase of carboxylic groups on carbon surface enhanced the loading number of PtCl6 2−, while carbonyl groups strengthened the adsorption of PtCl6 2− on carbon support [4,28]. In our study, all the catalysts prepared by using CH3COOH treated AC support exhibited high catalytic performance compared to H3PO4 and KOH treated AC ones that might mainly be due to the strong interaction between Pt particles and carbon by carbonyl functional groups. On the other hand, HCl treated catalyst had highest activity among all chemically treated AC supports containing catalysts. However, untreated AC had still better activity in hydrogen production compared to chemical treated AC supports. Treatment of the activated carbon with HCl left some chlorine chemisorbed on its surface, slightly decreasing its micropore volume and width [29]. These properties might be caused an increase in activity of the catalyst prepared by use of that support. Our results showed that the use of ethylene glycol in impregnation decreased or did not significantly change activity of the catalyst prepared using chemical treated AC supports (Table 4). 3.2.4 Evaluation XRD analysis and elemental compositions of chemical treated catalysts Pt particles doped on the treated AC support by impregnation method were confirmed from the respective X-ray diffractograms (Fig. 5 ). It is known that pure Pt particles have faced-centered cubic (fcc) structures those are characterized with the 2θ = 40°, 47°and 68° peaks corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) planes, respectively [30]. The prominent peaks were absent in some catalyst supports. The disappearance of the peaks was very significant in NaHB4 + T treated samples. Platinum crystallite sizes were determined by Scherrer equation using (111) plane peak and found to be very close to each other (10–13 nm) [31]. No significant correlation was observed between Pt particle size and activity of the catalyst since deposited Pt particles were very small in all supports. Table 5 demonstrates the elemental composition of chemical treated and untreated activated carbon before and after Pt loading. Regardless of the chemical used the carbon content of all samples decreased or unchanged after Pt deposition process. The extent of the decrease was highest in HCl-treated AC. Since HCl did not provide oxygen containing group to the surface the treated AC had lowest oxygen but highest carbon contents. However, it is interesting to point out that Pt deposited HCl-treated AC support had almost same percentages of carbon and oxygen as Pt loaded-untreated AC and those catalysts are most active catalysts for hydrogen-rich gas production activity."
9,Conclusion,"The gasification of glucose via aqueous phase reforming in the presence of catalysts developed in the present study showed that activities of catalysts in hydrogen production varied with deposition method used as well as reduction method applied. The use of ethylene glycol did not have significant effect on catalyst activity. Chemical treatment of activated carbon changed the activity of catalysts that highly depended on the types of chemicals used in the treatment. HCl treated catalyst had the highest activity among all chemically treated AC supports, however, untreated AC had still better activity in hydrogen production when sequential reduction methods applied."
