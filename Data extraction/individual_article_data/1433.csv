0,Introduction,"Environmental quality and the energy shortage have become two major issues faced by modern society [1–3]. Due to the rapid development of industrialization, the consumption of fossil fuels has increased in recent decades. Because of its high energy capacity and lack of secondary pollution, hydrogen is a promising green and sustainable energy carrier for replacing fossil fuels in the future [4–7]. The production of hydrogen via water splitting is considered a promising and environmental method and has attracted increasing interest [8–11]. In recent years, many researchers have studied this process. [12–16] However, the reaction Gibbs free energy (ΔrG) of 1mol H2 produced by water splitting equals +237kJmol−1, and this reaction must be driven by an external energy source. In addition, the water splitting reaction, which consists of an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is limited by its high thermodynamic potential, which is at least 1.23V [17–22]. Because the standard potential of HER is 0V, the OER must have a high external bias to occur. The hydrogen production from water splitting in the cathode area is limited by the oxidation reaction in the anode area. Despite extensive research efforts, the current efficiency of producing hydrogen directly from water is still very low. Accordingly, hydrogen production from water splitting requires further study to promote its practical applications. To overcome these disadvantages and to achieve the goal of producing hydrogen, many studies have been performed to decrease the anodic oxidation potential for promoting hydrogen production [23,24]. The primary method involves adding sacrificial reagents to replace the anode reaction. From a thermodynamic perspective, the oxidation of most organic compounds requires a smaller external bias than that required for water oxidation [25]. In past decades, the oxidation of biomass and its derivatives, such as glucose, glycerol, ethanol and methane, from biological substrates to promote the hydrogen production has been widely studied. [26–28] However, to convert biomass and its derivatives into hydrogen, various complicated processes that require harsh conditions or operations are required, leading to high costs and a relatively low efficiency. It has been found that the organic pollutants in wastewater that contain a high level of chemical energy are excellent electron donors and are available to promote hydrogen production. Thus, the simultaneous degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production has been researched. This approach also resolves the issues regarding environmental pollution [29]. However, the traditional system for hydrogen production from organic pollutants requires an external bias, thus requiring an additional energy input. Therefore, new and efficient methods for simultaneous pollutant degradation and the promotion of hydrogen production are urgently sought. In the last several years, an increasing number of studies has focused on photoelectrochemical energy conversion from solar light to hydrogen [30–33]. To overcome the mentioned shortcomings and to achieve the goal of producing hydrogen, a promising method may be via a self-biasing photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell for the simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants and the promotion of hydrogen production. This system is composed of an n-type semiconductor photoanode with a p-type semiconductor photocathode with different Fermi levels [34–37]. In this system, under light illumination, both of the photoelectrodes can generate electron–hole pairs. When the Fermi level of the photoanode is more negative than that of the photocathode, a self-bias is generated by the Fermi level difference between the photoanode and photocathode, thus providing the driving force. Then, the electrons on the photoanode are transferred through the external circuit to combine with the holes on the photocathode. The holes are separated at the photoanode, and the electrons are separated at the photocathode. Thus, there is a cooperative synergistic effect between the two photoelectrodes (Scheme 1 ). The highlight of our previous study was the influence of the Fermi level of the electrode on the self-biasing PEC cell [38]. Compared with traditional wastewater treatment in which the main purpose is pollutant degradation, this system for simultaneous pollutant degradation and the promotion of hydrogen production has great development potential [39]. As previously mentioned, hydrogen production in the cathode area is limited by the pollutant oxidation in the anode area. Thus, the aim of this work is to study how the oxidation of different pollutants can promote hydrogen production. To investigate the influence of the pollutants, two classes of aromatic organic pollutants (phenols (-OH) and alkylbenzenes (-CH3)) are selected for this research, including the compounds phenol, hydroquinone, phloroglucinol, toluene, p-xylene, and mesitylene. The molecular structures of these compounds are shown in Table S1. The oxidation of different classes of pollutants leads to different levels of hydrogen production due to the different redox properties. Specifically, the hydrogen production is limited by the transfer of electrons or the average oxidation current efficiency during the pollutant oxidation process. In this study, TiO2 nanorods and carbon-coated Cu2O nanowires were chosen as the photoanode and photocathode, respectively, because of their excellent performance in our previous research [38]. This work provides clear theoretical guidance for the simultaneous oxidation of aromatic organic pollutants and the promotion of hydrogen production via a self-biasing PEC cell."
1,Experiment section,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Phenol (AR, ≥99%), mesitylene (AR, 97%), titanium butoxide (AR, 99.0%), p-xylene (GC, ≥99.0%) and NaOH (AR, 96.0%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagents Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Hydroquinone (AR, ≥99.5%), phloroglucinol (AR, ≥99.0%), toluene (AR, ≥99.5%) and HCl (AR, 36.0%-38.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). The Cu mesh (100mesh, 0.11-mm wire diameter) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Shanghai, China)."
3,Electrode preparation,"2.2 Electrode preparation TiO2 NRs/FTO. First, titanium butoxide (0.35mL) was added to a HCl aqueous solution (6molL−1, 15mL), and the mixture was stirred continuously for 30min at normal atmospheric temperature. Then, the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and an F-doped tin oxide (FTO) sample was placed face down into the autoclave as the conductive surface. The autoclave was placed and well-sealed in an oven at 150°C for 4h. The oven temperature changed at a rate of 5°C min−1 until the autoclave reached the appropriate temperature. The TiO2 NRs/FTO was rinsed several times with deionized water and dried in air [38]. C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh. A sample of Cu mesh was anodized in a NaOH solution (3molL−1) for 20min at 25°C under 10mAcm−2 to generate Cu(OH)2 NWAs/Cu. Then, the Cu mesh was immersed into a glucose solution (3mgmL−1) for glucose coating. Subsequently, the Cu(OH)2 NWAs/Cu mesh with the glucose coating was annealed at 550°C under a N2 atmosphere for 4h with heating and cooling rates of 5°C min−1 [38]."
4,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements A three-electrode configuration whose working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode were the samples, platinum foil and Ag/AgCl2, respectively, was used to characterize the photoelectrochemical properties of the photoelectrodes. The working electrode parameters were controlled by an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., USA). The characterizations of the simultaneous system used a two-electrode configuration whose counter electrode and reference electrode were the same. The two photoelectrodes were immersed side-by-side into a quartz reactor (V=435mL) and illuminated by one simulated solar light source (Microsolar 300, Perfectlight, China) with an AM 1.5 filter (Perfectlight, China). In our experiments, the light intensity was maintained at 100mWcm−2. The other experimental conditions included a 3cm−2 working area of the photoelectrodes, moderate stirring, and the absence of an applied external potential. The I–V characteristics curve was obtained using linear sweep voltammetry with one typical cycle at a scan rate of 0.02Vs−1 [38]. The voltage and power were obtained as a function of current density and were normalized to the photocathode area. The simultaneous degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production was performed in the same quartz reactor under the same conditions. The target pollutants were the 6 types of organic compounds, as previously mentioned, with an initial concentration of 20mgL−1 and with 0.01molL−1 Na2SO4 used as the electrolyte. The TOC removal was measured using a multi N/C 3100 TOC/TNb analyzer (Analytikjena, Germany). The hydrogen production amounts were obtained using an off-line method in which the hydrogen content in a 1-mL gas sample is multiplied by the headspace volume of the reactor (200mL) [38]. The hydrogen was monitored using gas chromatography (GC 7900, Techcomp, Shanghai, China)."
5,Intermediate product analysis,"2.4 Intermediate product analysis Analysis of the photodegradation intermediates was performed with the LC-MS technique. The samples were held at room temperature before analysis. LC-MS analysis was performed using a Agilent C18 column (150×4.6mm, 5μm) in an Varian 310 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The injection volume was 10μL, and the column oven was maintained at room temperature. The separation and detection were performed in a simple isocratic solvent mode with a mobile phase of water/methanol solution (60/40v/v) at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The detection wavelength is 276nm. The MS working conditions were as follows: The drying nitrogen gas temperature was set at 350°C, and the gas introduced into the capillary region was held at a flow rate of 101min−1. The capillary was held at a potential of 3500V relative to the counter electrode for negative-ion mode."
6,Results and discussion,"The self-biasing PEC cell performance of the TiO2/NRs-C/Cu2O/Cu with the 8 kinds of organic pollutants are displayed in Table S2. Here, the PFC with phloroglucinol as pollutant has a best cell performance. The VOC, JSC, Pmax of this PEC cell reaches as high as 0.41V, 0.5mAcm−2 and 0.093mWcm−2. And the PEC cell with toluene as pollutant has a poorest performance. The degradation rate curves of the 6 types of pollutants are shown in Fig. 1 A. Here, the phloroglucinol curve only has four points because the compound was completely removed. The order for the degradation rate constant k is phloroglucinol (0.401)>hydroquinone (0.342)>phenol (0.297)>toluene (0.249)>p-xylene (0.230)>mesitylene (0.198). This order also represents the redox properties order. To verify the validity of the redox properties order of these pollutants, the Tafel slope is used to characterize the redox properties. The Tafel plot can be used to intuitively characterize the oxidation situation at the electrode solution interface. Thus, the oxidation ability of the TiO2 photoanode in the system of different pollutants can be characterized using the Tafel slope of the different types of pollutants. The Tafel slope is shown in Fig. S1. A smaller Tafel slope indicates a stronger oxidation ability of the TiO2 photoanode in the system of different pollutants [40]. Here, the only variate of this system is the pollutant, thus indicating the strength of the redox properties of the pollutants, which are listed in descending order as phloroglucinol>hydroquinone>phenol>benzaldehyde>toluene. This order is consistent with the TOC removal rates as well as the hydrogen production amount and efficiency order. The Gibbs free energy of a reaction (ΔrG) reflects the degree of spontaneity of a reaction. When ΔrG<0, the reaction can proceed spontaneously, and when ΔrG>0, it cannot proceed spontaneously. In this study, all the ΔrG values are greater than 0; thus, none of the reactions can proceed spontaneously. For these reactions to proceed, an input of external energy, such as electricity or light illumination, is required. The amount of external energy input increases with the ΔrG value. Thus, when the ΔrG value is low, the reaction can proceed more easily. Table 1 shows that the ΔrG (phloroglucinol) value is 795.8kJ/mol, which is the minimum value of the tested pollutants, so this reaction is the easiest to proceed and the hydrogen production amount is at its maximum. Here, the potential (E) is negative, meaning that for these reactions to proceed, an external potential is required whose value equals the value of E. When the absolute value of the potential is higher, then the ability for the reaction to progress requires a higher potential, which means that it is more difficult for the reaction to proceed and the pollutant is more difficult to degrade. Therefore, the potential can also reflect the difficulty level of the pollutant oxidation. The order of the potential values also approximately matches that of hydrogen production; the difference between these potential values is very small. Thus, the potential can only be used as a superficial reference. Meanwhile, due to the complicated reaction process of the entire reaction, the potential alone cannot reflect the difficulty level of degrading the pollutants. Therefore, the experimental oxidation potential is detected using cyclic voltammetry (CV) to verify the experimental oxidation. The ascending order of the experimental oxidation potential (EPEC) is as follows: phloroglucinol (0.251V)<hydroquinone (0.263V)<phenol (0.306V)<toluene (0.338V)<p-xylene (0.374V)<mesitylene (0.409V). This order is also consistent with the degradation rate constant order. The redox properties distribution of the pollutants is shown in Fig. 1B. Fig. 1B shows the relationship between EPEC and the degradation rate constant k. When EPEC is lower and k is higher, the redox properties are stronger. It is well known that the relationship between the reaction rate constant and the activation energy described in the chemical kinetics is also applicable to electrochemical reactions according to the equation. (1) k = A 0 · e x p ( − E a R T ) The effect of the electrode potential on the activation energy of the electrode reaction can be expressed by the formula[41–43]: (2) E a , O x = E a , O x 0 − β n F Δ φ Where the activation energies before and after the oxidation process are expressed by Ea,Ox and E a,Ox 0 respectively, Δφ represents the changes in electrode potential, β as the transfer coefficient, to measure the effect of electrode potential changes on the activation energy of the electrode reaction. Therefore the activation energy of the oxidation reaction decreases with the increase of the electrode potential so that facilitate the progress of the oxidation process. It is well known that the reaction rate constant represents the degree of reaction, the greater the reaction rate constant, the faster the degradation of pollutants. Therefore, the degradation rate constant decreases as the experimental photoelectrocatalytic oxidation potential increases. Thus, the redox properties in descending order are phloroglucinol>hydroquinone>phenol>toluene>p-xylene>mesitylene. As previously mentioned, the redox properties of a pollutant are a significant parameter. In general, the ring-opening reactions of simple benzodiazepine organic compounds are similar. Thus, the initial steps of the reactions have a great effect on the difficulty level of the entire oxidation process, emphasizing the importance of determining the intermediate products of the degradation process of the studied pollutants. Here, the products generated during the first hour from every pollutant were detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Phenol and toluene were used to represent the phenol and alkylbenzene class of pollutants, respectively. The product analysis is shown in Table S3. For the 1st hour products of phenol, the m/z values are 94, 110 and 116. Referring to the literature, these three compounds are considered to be phenol, hydroquinone (or catechol) and maleic acid, respectively. Therefore, the most probable reaction pathway is phenol to hydroquinone to p-benzoquinone to the ring-opened products, ultimately producing CO2. To verify this assumption, theoretical calculation software was used for analog computations. Initially, the Hammett substituent constant was used for qualitative analysis. Because the o-positon is influenced by both electronic and steric effects, the substituent constant is divided into the m-position and p-position constants (σm and σp). The Hammett substituent constants of these substituent groups are shown in Table S1. It is clear that OH is a strong electron-withdrawing group. When an OH group is present on benzene, the electron cloud density on benzene increases and benzene is activated. The σp value is more negative than that of σm. Thus, the 4-C at the p-position has more charge than the 3, 5-C at the m-position, and the 4-C at the p-position is more easily oxidized. In the Z-scheme photoelectrochemical system, large amounts of ·OH are generated in the anode area. Thus, the ·OH will primarily attack the 4-C at the p-position, and phenol be converted into hydroquinone. Then, the hydroquinone will be oxidized to p-benzoquinone, and finally, the ring will open. The electron cloud density distribution of phenol is used as a secondary proof to verify the proposed mechanism, which is shown in Fig. S2. The gold atoms represent the probable reaction sites. From Fig. S2, the Hückel charge of 4-C at the p-position is −0.095, which is exactly negative than that of the 3, 5-C at the m-position (-0.020). Therefore, the p-position is the main oxidation site. There is no substituent constant for the C at the o-position; thus, it is not discussed here. However, in Fig. S2, it is shown that the Hückel charge of the 2, 6-C at the o-position is the highest, and the gold atoms are the most probable reaction sites. Thus, the ·OH will also attack the o-position C to generate a catechol. This result is consistent with the LC-MS results. Here, the most probable reaction path is that previously mentioned. [44–46] Hydroquinone is considered to be the initial degradation product, and the standard Gibbs free energy (ΔrGΘ) of this reaction is 139.9kJ/mol. According to the Nernst equation, the potential of phenol to hydroquinone Ephenol/hydroquinone is 0.725V. Fig. 2 C shows the relative energy of the intermediate products during the oxidation of phenol. For hydroquinone, the initial step of the reaction is the oxidation to p-benzoquinone, and the subsequent reaction is the same oxidation with phenol. Therefore, the reaction path of hydroquinone is shorter than that of phenol. Meanwhile, the double OH groups increase the electron density of benzene so that the electron density is larger than that of phenol; thus, hydroquinone can be more easily oxidized than phenol. For phloroglucinol, the triple OH groups increase the electron density of benzene so that the electron density is larger than that of hydroquinone and phenol. In other studies, it was mentioned that phloroglucinol is also an intermediate product of phenol degradation and appears simultaneously with hydroquinone [47]. Therefore, the initial reaction step of phloroglucinol degradation is the ring-opening reaction, and the large electron density of benzene is favorable for this reaction. In conclusion, the difficulty level of the degradation of the three pollutants from easy to difficult is phloroglucinol>hydroquinone>phenol, which is consistent with the order of hydrogen production efficiency. When CH3 (a weak electron-donating group) is a substituent on benzene, the electron cloud density on benzene increases and benzene is activated. The σp value is also more negative than the σm value, but the difference between them is smaller than that those values for OH. Here, except for the C atoms on benzene, the C of the CH3 group can also be oxidized. Many holes are generated on the photoanode under light illumination, and these holes can directly oxidize the pollutants. Therefore, there are two probable pathways. One pathway is where the benzene of toluene is attacked by H+, giving benzene a positive charge and a free electron, and the benzene finally loses H+ to become a benzyl radical. Then, the benzyl radical can be further oxidized to benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde. The next product is benzoic acid; then, the ring opens, and CO2 is produced. Another pathway is where the CH3 of toluene is directly oxidized to the benzyl radical. From Fig. S2, the Hückel charge of CH3 is greater than the charge of the other C atoms of benzene. Combined with the LC-MS results, the initial stable product is benzyl alcohol, and the most probable degradation pathway is shown in Fig. 3 B [48,49]. The standard Gibbs free energy (ΔrGΘ) of this reaction is 214.2kJ/mol. According to the Nernst equation, the potential of phenol to hydroquinone Etoluene/benzylalcohol is 1.11V. Fig. 2D shows the relative energy of the intermediate products during the oxidation of toluene. The order of the initial oxidation reaction potential (E) of the three pollutants is Ephenol/hydroquinone <Etoluene/benzylalcohol. Therefore, the order of the redox properties of the pollutants is phenol>toluene, which is consistent with the previous results. In conclusion, the order of the redox properties for these pollutants is confirmed as follows: phloroglucinol>hydroquinone>phenol>toluene>p-xylene>mesitylene. The TOC removal rates show a clear trend in which the TOC removal rates increase with the redox properties of the pollutants. The TOC removal rates and hydrogen production amounts of phloroglucinol as the pollutant are the highest of those studied. However, there is no uniform trend for the hydrogen production amounts. In Table 2 , data with no pollutants added are displayed, and the hydrogen production amount in this case is very low. It is clear that the amount of hydrogen produced by all the pollutants is much higher than that of water splitting (0.0186mmol) and the hydrogen production amounts of phenols are much higher than those of alkylbenzenes. It’s speculated that different kinds of pollutant affect the amount of hydrogen production to a large extent as shown in Fig. 3. This finding, along with the thermodynamics and kinetics mentioned above, shows that the hydrogen production in the cathode area is limited by the oxidation of the pollutants in the anode area. The primary explanation for these results is the number of transferred electrons from the pollutant mineralization; however, this explanation cannot be simply expressed because for the different types of pollutants, the number of transferred electrons differs during the oxidation process. When OH (containing no C atoms) is a substituent on benzene, the number of transferred electrons decreases with the number of substituent groups. In contrast, when CH3 (containing a C atom) is a substituent on benzene, the number of transferred electrons increases with the number of substituent groups. Thus, the trends of the two types of pollutants are opposite to each other. Initially, it is necessary to determine the reactions that these pollutants undergo. The reactions, Gibbs free energy and electrode potential of these pollutants are displayed in Table 1. From the reactions, when the initial concentration and the degradation level are the same, the amount of hydrogen produced by mesitylene should be the highest of the pollutants studied. However, the final hydrogen production amount is limited by the different degradation abilities of the pollutants. In the degradation experiment, the initial pollutant concentrations differ. Thus, the number of transferred electrons for every reaction should differ as well. First, it is considered whether the order of the degradation rate constant k is consistent with the order of hydrogen production amounts nH2,exper. Fig. 4 A shows the relationship between k and nH2,exper. Unfortunately, there is no uniform trend, and nH2,exper does not increase or decrease with k. The change trend of phenols is opposite to that of alkylbenzenes. It is clear that the hydrogen production amounts of phenols are higher than those of alkylbenzenes, and phenol degradation occurs much easier than alkylbenzene degradation. Therefore, the hydrogen production does not depend on the value of k. Then, it was considered whether the order of TOC removal amounts, ΔTOCexper, is consistent with the order of nH2,exper. The relationship between ΔTOCexper and ηH2 is shown in Fig. 4B. However, no uniform trend is found. For only phenols or alkylbenzenes, nH2,exper decreases with ΔTOCexper. Thus, the hydrogen production does not depend on ΔTOCexper. In the photoelectrochemical hydrogen production system, there is another significant parameter for the evaluation of hydrogen production, which is called the quantum efficiency of hydrogen production [50]. Therefore, the hydrogen production efficiency should be considered in the present study. The TOC removal indicates the amount of organic carbon completely mineralized to CO2. However, for the incompletely mineralized part, the degree of mineralization is unknown. To facilitate discussion, we assume that all the transferred electrons come from the completely removed TOC. Here, the number of actual transferred electrons of every reaction can be calculated using the following equation: (3) n e = n e θ ⋅ c 0 ⋅ V ⋅ TOC % where ne is the experimental amount of transferred electrons, ne θ is the theoretical number of transferred electrons in the complete mineralization of an organic molecule, c0 is the initial concentration of pollutants, V is the initial volume of pollutants, and TOC% is the TOC removal rate of the corresponding pollutant. It is shown that the maximum hydrogen production amount occurs with phloroglucinol, but the calculated number of actual transferred electrons of this pollutant is the minimum, thus not matching with the theory, at least superficially. However, the actual hydrogen production amount is not equal to the theoretical hydrogen production amount. A simple comparison of the hydrogen amount cannot explain the mechanism. The data of hydrogen amounts in Table 2 are the hydrogen production amounts per unit of electrode area. To obtain the entire hydrogen production amount, the values should be multiplied by the electrode area of 3cm2. Then, the hydrogen production efficiency (ηH2) can be calculated using equation (4): (4) η H2 = n H2,exper / n H2,theor where nH2,exper represents the entire hydrogen production amount in the cathode area during the experiment. The value of nH2,theor is the theoretical hydrogen production amount in the actual reaction by the transferred electrons from the anode, which is half of the value of ne. From the two equations, the hydrogen production amount is limited by the TOC removal rates. Thus, the hydrogen production in the cathode area is limited by the oxidation of pollutants in the anode area, according to the thermodynamics and kinetics; this enables a detailed study of the trends of this process. The results show that the order of hydrogen production efficiency ηH2 is consistent with that of the hydrogen production amounts nH2,exper. There is no firm trend between ηH2 and k or between ηH2 and ΔTOCexper. Therefore, it is considered whether ηH2 is related to an efficiency value of the pollutant oxidation. The average oxidation current efficiency (ACE) of the pollutant oxidation in the anode area can be calculated using the following equation (5): (5) ACE = Δ TOC exper / Δ TOC theor where ΔTOCexper is the experimental TOC removal amount of the aqueous solution after 8h of reaction, and ΔTOCtheor is the theoretical TOC removal amount after 8h of reaction. The relationship between electric quantity at time and the required electrons of an organic molecule after complete mineralization can be calculated. The ACE is the average current efficiency of the pollutant degradation in the anode area. The relationship between hydrogen production efficiency (ηH2) and the ACE of pollutants is shown in Fig. 4C. The value of ηH2 increases with ACE. For phenols, the influence of ACE is much larger than that for alkylbenzenes because for the three types of phenols, the small ACE difference causes a large ηH2 difference. However, for the alkylbenzenes, the opposite is true. A recycling experiment of PEC pollution oxidation to promote hydrogen production was investigated to evaluate PEC stability of TiO2NRs/FTO photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu photocathode material. It can be found that the degradation of pollutants and hydrogen production remained stable in the self-biasing photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) by performing three cycles testing of the hydrogen production and degradation of the 6 types of pollutants (as shown in Fig. 5 )."
7,Conclusion,"In this study, two classes (phenols and alkylbenzenes) and six types of aromatic organic compounds are chosen as target pollutants and are treated by a self-biasing PEC cell for simultaneous pollutant degradation and hydrogen production. The TOC removal rates of these pollutants range from 63.5% to 93.6%, and the highest hydrogen production efficiency is 81.52%. The value of k decreases with the experimental photoelectrocatalytic oxidation potential (EPEC), and the oxidation factor calculated by Tafel’s equation increases with EPEC. The TOC removal rates increase with the redox properties of the pollutants. The hydrogen production amounts and the efficiency of the phenols are higher than those of the alkylbenzenes. To promote hydrogen production, the oxidation of organic pollutants is much easier than the oxidation of water. The hydrogen production promotion is not determined by k or ΔTOC. In addition, the ηH2 value depends on the ACE, and ηH2 increases with ACE. The orders of ηH2 and ACE are consistent: phloroglucinol>hydroquinone>phenol>mesitylene>p-xylene>toluene. This work reveals the theory behind the simultaneous pollutant degradation and hydrogen production and expands the application to wastewater treatment."
