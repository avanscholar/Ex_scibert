0,Introduction,"The global demands for energy are rapidly increasing along with population and economic growth [1]. Fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal) cover almost 80 % of the total energy demands [2], with their use being accompanied by a harmful carbon footprint. Handling CO2, one of the main greenhouse gasses, is of vital importance for climate change mitigation. In this respect, the CO2 hydrogenation reaction is among the most effective and viable ways to manage and reduce CO2 emissions, using hydrogen generated from water electrolysis powered by renewable and sustainable sources, such as solar or wind energy [3,4]. The reuse of CO2 for the production of value-added hydrocarbons and therefore the promotion of renewable energy in the chemical production chain is preferable to direct CO2 storage, since the amount of CO2 reduced is one order of magnitude larger than simple sequestration can eliminate [5–7]. CO2 hydrogenation gives the opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions and to also produce useful like methane, higher hydrocarbons, and alcohols or carbon monoxide which can be also hydrogenated to produce higher hydrocarbons [4,5,8–15]. Depending on the metal catalyst used, the reaction conditions and the type of the reactor the products of the reaction may be varied. In the case of ruthenium-based catalysts CO2 hydrogenation has been studied in detail and the main products were found to be methane and carbon monoxide [16–21]. The two reactions occurring in this case, are: (1) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H r , 298 K o = - 165.0 kJ / mol (2) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O Δ H r , 298 K o = 41.5 kJ / mol Equation (1) describes the methanation reaction (well-known as Sabatier reaction [22]), which is an exothermic reaction and is favored at low temperatures. It exhibits high equilibrium conversion in a temperature range between 25 and 400 °C [23]). Sabatier reaction, using Ru-based catalysts, is one of the most economical choices, since it shows high turnover frequency numbers resulting in high methanation reaction rates, and therefore low required metal loading [24]. The CO2 methanation reaction mechanism is still debatable. The intermediate compounds and the rate-determining steps have not yet been clarified. They all depend on the nature of the metal catalyst, the kind of the support and the reaction operating conditions [25]. There are two main mechanisms proposed for the methanation reaction. The dissociation of CO2 to COad and Oad and further to Oad and Cad, which are finally hydrogenated to H2O and CH4, respectively is the first proposed mechanism. The intermediate species involved in this mechanism have been determined spectroscopically using various techniques, including Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy (DRIFTS) [26], and Raman spectroscopy [27]. The second proposed mechanism involves atomically adsorbed hydrogen (derived from the dissociative adsorption of H2 from the gaseous phase [21]), which decreases the dissociation energy of CO [28–31]. Adsorbed hydrogen reacts with the adsorbed CO2, producing surface formates (e.g. COOHad or HCOOad) and/or formyl adspecies (CHxO) [19], followed by the formation of CHad, COad and/or COHad/HCOad, with further dissociation to OHad and Cad or CHad. Methane and water are the final products of the hydrogenation of these species [32]. This hydrogen-assisted mechanism has been supported by infrared spectroscopy techniques [17,28] and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy [30,33]. According to the literature, the majority of the kinetic data on the methanation reaction on Ru-based catalysts, have been obtained in laboratory-scale reactors. A strong dependence on H2 partial pressure (reaction orders between 0.3 and 2.5) has been observed, and a weaker dependence on CO2 partial pressures (reaction order between 0 and 1) [25,34,35]. The Reverse Water Gas Shift reaction (RWGS), expressed by equation (2), is a mildly endothermic reaction and is thermodynamically favored at higher temperatures. Carbon monoxide, the main product of this reaction, is very useful for many industrial applications such as the Fischer–Tropsch process [36–38], as well as processes that require syngas as the reaction mixture [39] for the production of various chemicals like methanol or other long-chain hydrocarbons. The Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis (EPOC) or non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic activity (NEMCA) effect has been applied in a wide range of catalytic reactions [40–46], using a variety of metals or metal oxides as catalysts in conjunction with various solid electrolytes [19–21,40,47–50] in the last 40 years. EPOC offers the opportunity to significantly change the catalytic properties of a conductive metal in a reversible and predictable manner by simply applying a constant potential, (ΔUWR) between the catalyst (working electrode) and a second electrically conductive metal (counter electrode), both deposited onto a solid electrolyte. The effect of EPOC is related to the electrochemically induced and controlled migration (reverse spillover or backspillover) of ions from the bulk of the solid electrolyte onto the gas-exposed catalytic surface [40] via the three-phase boundary. This migration is responsible for the formation of an effective electrochemical double layer, which modifies the work function, Φ, of the metal catalyst by ΔΦ = eΔUWR [40,46]. Therefore, the chemisorption energy of the reactants and the intermediate compounds is changing and consequently the selectivity and the activity of the catalyst are affected. Backspillover of promoting ionic species has been documented and investigated using various surface spectroscopic techniques including XPS, UPS, STM, AES, TPD as well as electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance, which have shown clearly an electrochemically controlled reversible migration of ionic species (e.g. O2–, Na+, K+, H+) between solid electrolytes and catalysts deposited on them [51–58]. Depending on their composition (anionic, cationic, or mixed conducting materials) solid electrolytes offer a huge operational temperature range (typically between 25 °C and 1000 °C), where almost all of the heterogeneous catalytic reactions are taking place. These electrolytes are available to induce the EPOC effect and therefore activate these reactions, as active catalyst supports by becoming in situ promoter donors or poison acceptors for the catalytic active sites. Using promoters on catalysts can lead to changes in the catalytic kinetics and the kinetic order of the reaction with respect to partial pressures of the reactants, which can change drastically between positive, zero, and negative values. Two basic indicators are widely used to quantify the extent of the EPOC effect: the rate enhancement ratio, ρ, defined by equation (3) and the apparent Faradic efficiency, Λ, described by equation (4): (3) ρ = r r o (4) Λ = Δ r ( I / n F ) where, r is the catalytic rate during electropromotion (i.e., under potential application, thus close circuit conditions, and therefore current flow through the electrical circuit of the electrochemical cell), whereas ro is the unpromoted rate (i.e., the open-circuit catalytic rate), Δr stands for the induced observed catalytic rate change, (Δr = r - ro), in g-eq/s, I is the corresponding current to the potential application, n is the ion charge and F is the Faraday constant. Λ values higher than unity denote non-Faradaic behavior, whereas ρ describes the quantitative change of the catalytic production rate. The catalyst potential, UWR, is the potential of the catalyst (working electrode) with respect to a reference electrode. In the absence of a reference electrode (two electrodes configuration) which is the case for this study, the catalyst potential, UCAT, is the potential of the catalyst with respect to the Au counter electrode. Another useful index in EPOC is the conversion enhancement index (CEI) defined as: (5) CEI = X i - X i o X i o % can also be used to discuss the degree of the promotion. In equation (5), Xi expresses the conversion of the reactant i under polarization (electropromoted state), whereas X i o is the conversion of the reactant i under open-circuit conditions. In the present study, CO2 was selected as the reactant species for the CEI calculation. The behavior under electropromoted conditions can be predicted from simple rules that have been developed and are valid both for classical promotion and for electrochemical promotion of catalysis [40,59–62]. The kinetic study of the reaction (i.e., the effect of the partial pressure of the electron acceptor (A) and the electron donor (B) reactants on the catalytic rate) can be used to predict the effect of catalyst potential on the electropromoted catalytic rate. There are four types of reaction behavior [40,59–62]: Rule 1: Electophobic or nucleophilic behavior: The catalytic rate increases with increasing catalyst potential application (i.e., ∂r/∂U > 0). In this case, the kinetics are positive order in the electron donor (D) reactant and negative or zero-order in the electron acceptor (A) reactant. The electron acceptor reactant (A) is strongly adsorbed and much more strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface than the electron donor reactant (D). Rule 2: Electrophilic or nucleophobic behavior: The catalytic rate decreases with increasing catalyst potential application (i.e., ∂r/∂U < 0). In this case, the kinetics are positive order in the electron acceptor (A) reactant and negative or zero-order in the electron donor (D) reactant. During this type of behavior, the electron donor reactant (D) is strongly adsorbed and much more strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface than the electron acceptor reactant (A). Rule 3: Volcano-type behavior: The reaction catalytic rate exhibits a maximum by changing the potential. In this case, the rate changes from positive order with respect to A and negative order with respect to D (at low pressures of A) to negative order with respect to A and positive order with respect to D (at low pressures of D). Both the electron donor D and electron acceptor A are strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Rule 4: Inverted volcano-type behavior: The reaction catalytic rate shows a minimum by changing the potential. In this case, the kinetics are positive order in both the electron acceptor (A) and electron donor (D) reactant. Both the electron acceptor A and the electron donor D are weakly adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The aforementioned four behaviors/rules that describe the EPOC [40,59–62] effect are summarized in Fig. 1 , where a characteristic example is given for each case [63–66]. The electrochemical promotion of CO2 hydrogenation has been already studied in single pellet reactors using Ru catalysts on various electrolytes, including YSZ [19,20,67], Na-β”-Al2O3 [20,67], Κ-β”-Al2O3 [48] and BZY [21]. It was found that the EPOC effect is valid in any case, independently of the promoted species used (O2–, Na+, K+, H+). In the case of YSZ and BZY, positive potential application, which corresponds to O2– supply to, or H+ removal from the catalyst, leads to enhanced rate of methanation and suppressed rate of CO production. The same suppression of CO production with increasing potential is observed with the Na+ and K+ conducting supports. In this case, however, the rate of methanation passes through a maximum with increasing potential, i.e. volcano-type behavior is observed. In the present study, for the first time, a complete kinetic study of CO2 hydrogenation reaction, on thin porous ruthenium catalytic films deposited on YSZ, is carried out using a monolithic electropromoted reactor. This type of semi-pilot reactor, operating under high flowrates (far higher compared to the values used in laboratory scale reactors), is used also to study the effect of the reactants partial pressure on the catalytic active surface area."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Nine square plates of 8 mol% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), provided by Kerafol, with a thickness of 300 μm and dimensions of 50 mm × 50 mm, were utilized as oxygen ions conductors. On all electrolytic plates gold films were used, as the counter electrodes. They were deposited on the one side of each plate via magnetron sputtering method, prior to any other deposition. The YSZ support plates were introduced into the sputtering chamber, filled with pure argon, and then the Au target (99.99 %) was deposited onto the substrate. It has been found that the optimum deposition conditions were the following: direct current (dc) mode of 0.5 A with a discharge of 500 V, Ar pressure 0.4 Pa. Under these conditions and 10 min deposition time the loading of 1.2 mg/cm2 surface plate was achieved. An advantage of this method is that the electrical conductivity of the prepared Au counter electrode is high in ambient conditions (i.e. ohmic resistance equal to 0.1 Ω/cm2). Prior to any catalytic run, blank experiments with Au electrodes on both surfaces of each plate were performed, suggesting that Au is inert for methanation and RWGS reactions both under open-circuit and electropromoted conditions. The wet impregnation method was used for the deposition of the Ru catalyst film, also served as working electrode, on the opposite side of the discs. An 150 mM RuCl3 (Alfa Aesar) solution diluted in isopropanol at 50 °C, was deposited by brush painting on each YSZ plate, followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 1 h. The resulting total mass of the catalyst film was 9–10 mg per cell with a loading of approximately 0.44 mg/cm2. The catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalysts remained stable after several months of experiments since the obtained results were reproducible with a very small deviation (±5%). 2.1.1 Catalyst characterization X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the structure and the morphology of the Ru film deposited on YSZ solid electrolytes. An X-ray diffractometer Siemens D500 equipped with COOLIDGE radiation (Cu Ka lamp) which operated at 40 kV and 30 mA (λ = 1.542 Å) was used to extract diffractograms for the fresh and the used working electrode. SEM images were obtained with a Zeiss Supra 35 field emission, variable pressure scanning electron microscope equipped with a Bruker AXS energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The magnification of the taken images was at the range of 300,000–900,000 times with a distinctive limit of 1 nm resolution in high vacuum mode and 2 nm resolution at variable pressure (130 Pa) mode. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (base pressure 3·10-9 mbar) with a non-monochromatized Alka X-ray source operating at 1486.6 eV (12 kV with a 20 mA anode current) and a Leybold LH EA11 electron energy analyzer with a constant pass energy of 100 eV. The acquisition energy step was 0.1 eV for all spectra. The as-received catalyst in the form of square plates (10 × 10 mm) were loaded in the ultra-high vacuum chamber while the analysis area was 2 × 5 mm2. Data analysis was performed using the XPSPEAK 4.1 after Shirley's background subtraction. Peak asymmetry was described by employing a Lorentzian asymmetric lineshape for Ru core levels, according to Morgan et al. [68]. The photoelectron peaks for all other core levels (Y 3d, Zr 3d, and O 1 s) were fitted using a Gaussian Lorentzian line shape. Finally, the Fermi edge (Figure S4) was used to adjust sample charging firstly due to the absence of a considerable amount of carbon contamination on the surface and secondly because of C1s and Ru3d photoelectron peaks overlap. 2.1.2 MEP reactor operation The configuration of the MEP reactor was proposed in 2004 [69] in an effort to develop a scaled up reactor for EPOC studies without problems related to expensive thick catalytic films with low metal dispersion (<0.01 %) and inefficient and complex reactor designs like those used in laboratory scale experiments. The first generation of MEPR was used successfully to study the reactions of ethylene oxidation and NO reduction by C2H4 in presence of O2 [50,69]. The exact design and specifications of the MEPR were described in detail elsewhere [50,69,70]. In the present study, the monolithic electrochemically promoted reactor was placed in a tubular furnace and its temperature was measured and controlled by a type K thermocouple embedded in the metal casing at a distance of 1 mm from the gas mixture entrance. In order to accomplish uniform temperature in the reactor under high reactants flow rates, a pre-heater was placed directly in front of the furnace entrance. The feed gas composition and total flow rate, FT, was controlled by three mass flowmeters (Brooks instrument, SLA 5800 series). Reactants were commercial compressed gases, provided by Linde Hellas, with certified standards of 5.0 % CO2 in He and 15.0 % H2 in He. The total flow rate and inlet gas composition were adjusting (at the desired levels, FT = 1000 cm3/min) by using pure He (99.999 %) feed through the third flowmeter. All the experiments were performed at ambient pressure and temperature equal to 370 °C. This specific temperature was chosen in order to detect both CH4 and CO as products from equations (1) and (2). For the kinetic experiments, various partial pressures of hydrogen (PH2 = 1–12 kPa) and carbon dioxide (PCO2 = 0.3–4 kPa) were studied. Reactants and products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (Chromatec Analytic GC-2018) in conjunction with an infrared gas analyzer CO2-CO-CH4-O2 (Fuji Electric, ZRE-3). Constant currents and potentials were applied using an AMEL 2053 galvanostat–potentiostat."
3,Results and discussion,
4,Physicochemical characterization,"3.1 Physicochemical characterization The morphology and the size distribution of the Ru particles have been explored by SEM, EDS and XRD analysis. The SEM analysis is presented in Fig. 2 . More specifically, Fig. 2 (a) and (b), which correspond to the fresh sample, display a porous film microstructure consisting mostly of small particles together with the presence of a minor number of larger crystallites. Representative EDS analysis of the fresh samples is given in Figure S1 in the supplementary information, which as expected shows the presence of ruthenium, yttrium, zirconium, and oxygen in the fresh sample. The line-scan analysis presented in Figures S2 and S3 clearly demonstrates that both the nanoparticles and the larger crystallites are composed of ruthenium. The corresponding particle size distribution of the fresh sample, as calculated by measuring>100 particles, shows that their size ranges between 6 and 40 nm (mean size 23.2 ± 9.4 nm). Note that the small number of larger crystallites observed in the SEM images of the fresh sample ranges from 500 to 800 nm and they have not been used in the estimation of the mean size. Fig. 2(d) – (e) show the SEM images and the particle size distribution histogram of the used film. It is evident that the extensive use of the sample under reaction conditions induces textural changes to the sample which now appears to be more homogeneous and less porous. However, the close-up image shown in Fig. 2 (e), together with particle size distribution histogram (Fig. 2(f)) display some agglomeration of the particles, with the mean size being at 34.5 ± 11.8 nm. The cross-section images shown in Fig. 2(g)-(i) show that the film thickness can range approximately from 180 to 400 nm depending on the size of the Ru particles present at the point where the cross section image has been taken from. Fig. 3 shows XRD patterns of the Ru films deposited on YSZ before (denoted as Ru fresh) and after (denoted as Ru used) reaction (PCO2: PH2 = 1:7, FT, 200 cc/min, 370 °C). In the case of the fresh sample, well-defined reflections were observed before the reduction step, at 28.5O, 35.8O, 41O, 58.7O and 74.5O corresponding to RuO2. The diffractogram did not show any reflections attributed to metallic Ru. The other peaks seen in the diffractogram correspond to the solid electrolyte (Y2O3 and ZrO2). On the other hand, after reaction the intensity of the RuO2 peaks has decreased dramatically, while intense reflections corresponding to metallic Ru are clearly seen at 38.7O, 42.5O and 45O. The result strongly suggests that under the presence of both CO2 and H2 conditions the catalyst surface is predominantly metallic. As we shall see this observation aligns well with the XPS results presented below. Furthermore, Scherrer’s equation was used to estimate the Ru0 and RuO2 particle sizes for both samples. In the case of the fresh catalyst the RuO2 particle size was found to be approximately 14.5 ± 2 nm. After reaction the metallic Ru particle size was 15.5 ± 3 nm. These values are in agreement with particle sizes calculated from the SEM images. Fig. 4 displays a comparison of the XP spectra of the Ru catalyst film obtained after five different treatment conditions. More specifically, the Ru/YSZ5 sample corresponds to the fresh catalyst (untreated), whereas Ru/YSZ1-4 samples are obtained after reducing the catalyst for 1 h at 350 °C followed by exposure to different ratios of PCO2: PH2 (gas mixture flowrate, FT, 200 cc/min) for 3 h at 370 °C (Ru/YSZ1 - PCO2: PH2 = 1:7, Ru/YSZ2 - PCO2: PH2 = 2:1, Ru/YSZ3 - PCO2: PH2 = 1:1, Ru/YSZ4 - PCO2: PH2 = 1:0). Fig. 4a and 4b shows the Ru 3d and Ru 3p3/2 spectral regions respectively. In both figures we observe that the catalysts exposed to both mild and high oxidizing conditions, after reduction (i.e. Ru/YSZ1-3), exhibit a single metallic state, whereas the fresh catalyst (Ru/YSZ5) and the catalyst that has been exposed to CO2 (Ru/YSZ4) exhibit a single Ru (IV) oxide state. The photoelectron peaks in the Ru 3d and Ru 3p3/2 regions were fitted to identify the difference in ruthenium chemical states. Fig. 4a shows the deconvolution of metallic ruthenium peaks in Ru/YSZ1-3 catalysts, revealing the characteristic asymmetric doublet Ru 3d5/2-Ru 3d3/2 (BE: 280.2–284.4 ± 0.1 eV, spin–orbit-splitting: 4.2 ± 0.1 eV) with the expected intensity ratio (3:2) [71]. The binding energy of the Ru 3p3/2 was found to be 461.6 ± 0.1 eV. According to Ernst et al [72], the satellite peak at approximately 9.7 eV higher BE from Ru 3p3/2 peak maximum, is ascribed to a plasmon feature, which indicates a metallic state. In addition, for the Ru/YSZ4-5 catalysts, peak deconvolution was performed using the method developed by Morgan et al. [68]. More specifically, the asymmetry of the Ru 3d doublet (BE: 281–285.3 ± 0.1 eV, spin–orbit-splitting: 4.2 ± 0.1 eV) is related to the RuO2 rutile structure, which, according to the literature, enhances the asymmetry of the peaks. Two additional satellites at 1.8 ± 0.1 eV higher BE were added to the main peaks due to both core–hole screening [73] and surface plasmon generation [74], as well as in the crystallinity of the oxide itself, according to Foelske et al. [75] observations. The peak maximum for Ru 3p3/2 is 462.8 ± 0.1 eV, whereas the satellite structure at 3.2 ± 0.1 eV higher BE from the main peak is attributed to the previously described phenomena. The latter observations suggest that the presence of molecular H2 even in relatively small quantities moderates the oxidation of the catalyst surface, which has major implications in the kinetics of CO2 methanation. The results presented in this study satisfy the findings originally presented by Carenco et al. [76]. The authors employed ambient pressure XPS to determine the chemical state of Ru/TiO2 catalysts under reaction conditions to show that the ruthenium metallic state is catalytically active towards methanation, whereas the formation of CHx species are favored by the temperature increase over adsorbed carbon monoxide. Moreover, it is worth noting that ruthenium retained its metallic form even in the presence of a CO2:H2 mixture. This behavior may be explained by the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on the metal surface and the subsequent reaction of the adsorbed CO and O with hydrogen [77]. It is worth noting that the enhanced ratio of Ru/RuOx in the samples of the current study, after reduction step, can be associated with the harsh (temperature and PH2) reduction conditions in comparison with previous study [19]."
5,Catalytic and electrochemical measurements,"3.2 Catalytic and electrochemical measurements The CO2 consumption rate and conversion with respect to the partial pressure of H2, PH2, is shown in Fig. 5 . High partial pressures of PH2 favors CH4 formation, resulting in higher consumption rates of CO2 despite the decrease of the RWGS reaction rate. The latter is one order of magnitude lower than the observed increase of the methanation rate. As a result, the CO2 conversion increases for the whole PH2 range and taking values close to 40 % (under o.c. conditions) for PH2/PCO2 = 12:1. The conversion enhancement index (CEI), calculated by eq.5, follows an increasing trend up to 4 kPa of PH2 under anodic polarization (Fig. 5). Under H2 excess conditions CEI approaches a constant value of 23 %, which denotes a 23 % increase of the open circuit (o.c.) conversion of CO2 by a + 2.5 V potential application. The negligible effect of potential on CEI for PH2 > 4 kPa can be attributed to the already increased coverage of the surface with hydrogen, which is used to hydrogenate the CO2. Under low values of PH2 and thus low surface hydrogen coverages, anodic polarization strengthens the bond of the adsorbed electron donor (i.e. hydrogen) resulting in higher number of active sites occupied by adsorbed hydrogen, higher rates of CH4 formation and therefore increase of the conversion enhancement index (CEI). Fig. 6 shows how CO2 partial pressure under steady-state conditions affect the CO2 rate of consumption, CO2 conversion, and conversion enhancement index (CEI). The consumption rate of CO2 increases with the increase of the electron acceptor partial pressure (i.e PCO2). This is mainly due to the CO production rate increase, since the low coverage of hydrogen under high PCO2/PH2 ratios results in small amounts of produced CH4. It is worth noting that under oxidizing conditions (PCO2 ≥ 2 kPa), the conversion of CO2 is quite low (∼5%), signifying the importance of H2 presence in the reaction gas mixture and thus on the catalytic surface. According to our results, the CO2 consumption rate is mainly attributed to the methanation production rate rather than to the RWGS reaction rate. Under positive polarization, the CEI decreases with PCO2, since the methanation reaction is suppressed (due to the lack of hydrogen) and the RWGS reaction, which shows an electrophilic behavior [19,70] decreases too. Therefore, for PCO2 values higher than 2 kPa, where methane production rate is one order of magnitude lower than CO formation, negative CEI values are observed. On the other hand, negative potential application, causes a slight increase on the RWGS reaction rate, leading also to a small increase of CEI. It should be noted that in a broad region of PH2/PCO2 the observed CO2 conversion was lower than 20 %. On the other hand, although higher conversion values were observed for PH2/PCO2 > 5, the proposed scaled up monolithic electropromoted reactor (MEPR) is not suffering from mass transfer limitation phenomena as has been already discussed in a previous study [70]. Moreover, as shown in Figure S5 and S6, the kinetic behavior of the reaction is exactly the same if the observed conversions are taken into account and replot Figs. 7 and 8 as a function of the outlet partial pressures of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Figs. 7 and 8 show how changing the reactants partial pressures (PH2 and PCO2) at steady state affects the methanation and the RWGS reaction rates and selectivities. More specifically, Fig. 7a shows the dependence of the catalytic rate of CH4 and CO formation on the partial pressure of H2 under a constant CO2 partial pressure equal to 1 kPa with a gas mixture flow rate of 1000 cm3/min at 370 °C. The methanation rate is positive order in PH2 for the examined PH2 range, both under o.c. conditions and polarization. This behavior is in agreement with the literature, where CH4 formation rate represents a positive order kinetic for catalytic Ru films over various supports [17,78,79]. In contrast, the RWGS reaction rate reaches a maximum at PH2 of 1 kPa at which point there is strong competitive adsorption between the reactants. For higher PH2 the strong Ru-H bonds suppress the RWGS and enhance the coverage of the surface with hydrogen which favors the methanation reaction. Fig. 7b shows how changing the hydrogen partial pressure, PH2, affects the CH4 and CO selectivities at steady state for o.c. conditions and positive or negative polarization. For oxidizing conditions, PH2/PCO2 = 1, CO is the dominant product, with a selectivity close to 90 %, which decreases dramatically by increasing the hydrogen partial pressure. On the other hand, the selectivity to CH4 is very low for low PH2/PCO2 ratios, whereas in H2 excess conditions it increases reaching values close to 100 %, under positive polarization and PH2 = 12 kPa. Fig. 8a demonstrates the effect of changing PCO2 (under constant PH2 = 2 kPa) on the catalytic reaction rate for the methanation and RWGS reaction. The methanation rate exhibits a maximum at 0.15 kPa followed by slight decrease by increasing PCO2, denoting a negative to zero order in CO2 (∂rCH4/∂PCO2 ≤ 0). This behavior can be attributed to a continuous decrease of θH/θCHxO ratio by increasing PCO2, a fact that suppresses the methanation rate and favors the RWGS reaction rate, as shown in Fig. 10 a. In the whole range of PCO2, the RWGS reaction rate exhibits positive order with respect to the electron acceptor (i.e. CO2). This behavior remains the same both under o.c. conditions and anodic or cathodic polarization of 2.5 V. The effect of changing the partial pressure of the CO2 at steady-state on the selectivities of the products is presented in Fig. 8b. The selectivity to methane decreases by increasing PCO2 (from approximately 80 % at 0.15 kPa to 10 % at 4 kPa of PCO2). Positive polarization enhances the selectivity to methane by almost 10 %. The selectivity to CO is low (close to 20 %) at low PCO2 and is reaching a plateau for PCO2 ≥ 2 kPa. Negative polarization does not affect the selectivity to CO, whereas a decrease by 10 % is achieved in the case of positive polarization. The effect of the partial pressure of H2 on the rate enhancement ratio, ρ, and Faradaic efficiency, Λ, are shown in Fig. 9a, both under positive and negative polarization. Under anodic polarization there is a constant 40 % increase (ρCH4 = 1.4) of the catalytic methane formation rate for partial pressures of H2 higher than 2 kPa, whereas higher values observed at low partial pressure of H2 (PH2 = 1 kPa). The corresponding Faradaic efficiency, ΛCH4, varies between 0 and 4. For PH2 higher than 8 kPa the faradaic efficiency is constant and close to 4. This agrees with the behavior of ΔrCH4, under positive polarization, shown in Fig. 7a in conjunction with the fact that the resulted current under close circuit conditions is slightly affected by the reactant composition (for PH2 > 8 kPa). The opposite behavior is observed for CO formation rate under positive polarization, where a decrease of 50 % (ρCO∼0.5) is noted, while the Faradaic efficiency of CO is close to 0 (ΛCO∼0.2) due to the negligible production of CO under the existing reducing conditions. For cathodic polarization (UCAT = -2.5 V), the RWGS reaction is favored, with a 30 % increase in CO production rate (ρCO = 1.3), while the methanation rate is suppressed by almost 20 % (ρCH4∼0.8). The effect of CO2 partial pressure, PCO2, on the Faradaic efficiency, Λ, and the rate enhancement ratio, ρ, of the two reaction products is presented in Fig. 9b both for negative and positive polarization. One observes that ΛCH4 exhibits a smooth peak for reducing conditions (i.e. low PCO2), where the observed catalytic rate change of CH4, ΔrCH4, is more intense, while in more oxidizing conditions it remains constant with values close to unity. Negative polarization leads to negative Λ values (∼-0.4) for CH4, since the catalytic rate of methane is inhibited due to O2– pumping from the Ru catalytic surface area, that leads to catalyst work function decrease, which weakens the Ru-H bonds and strengthens the Ru − CHxO bonds. The corresponding rate enhancement ratio of methane (ρCH4) during positive polarization approaches the value of 1.7, indicating a 70 % increase of the methane catalytic rate, whereas for negative polarization it is constant at 0.9, which denotes a 10 % decrease of the initial catalytic rate. The RWGS reaction is not affected by the change of the CO2 partial pressure both for positive and negative potential application. More specific, a ΛCO value equal to 0.2 with a corresponding ρCO value slightly higher than unity is achieved for negative polarization, whereas positive polarization causes a decrease that is quantified by a ΛCO value equal to 0.3 and ρCO value equal to 0.8. Based on the kinetic results, presented in Fig. 7a and 8a and the rules of chemical and electrochemical promotion [40,59–62], which have been already discussed in the introduction one can predict both the behavior of the methanation and RWGS reaction under electropromoted conditions. Following these predictions, CH4 production should be favored under positive polarization showing an electrophobic behavior while CO production should be enhanced under negative polarization showing an electrophilic behavior. The potentiostatic transient of a continuous anodic (i.e. O2− supply to the catalyst) and cathodic (i.e. O2− removal from the catalyst) polarization obtained under extremely reducing gas feed composition (PCO2/PH2 = 1/10) at 370 °C and a total gas flowrate equal of 1000 cm3/min is presented in Fig. 10a. At the beginning, under open circuit conditions, the initial CO2 conversion is approximately 34 % (with a corresponding consumption rate equal to 27x10-7 mol/sec), whereas after a constant application of 2.5 V the CO2 conversion increases up to 42 % (with a corresponding consumption rate equal to 34x10-7 mol/sec). The CO2 conversion remains constant until the potential interruption, which leads to its initial value. Reducing conditions favor the methane production, therefore the main component for the CO2 consumption is the methanation reaction rather than the RWGS reaction (which its rate is one order of magnitude lower than the methanation one). Thus, during positive polarization, the increase of the CO2 consumption is mainly attributed to the increase of the methane production rate (electrophobic behavior). This is the result of the O2– pumping from the electrolyte bulk onto the ruthenium surface, a process that leads to stronger bonds of Ru-H (electron donor species), which is the crucial step for the methanation processes through a hydrogen assisted mechanism. At the same time, the Ru − CHxO (electron acceptor species) bonds are weakened and thus, an increase in the H/CHxO coverage ratio value (i.e., θH/θCHxO) occurs, which favors the methanation reaction and suppresses the RWGS reaction [19]. It is worth noting that “CHxO” (with × = 0, 1, 2) corresponds to all possible intermediate oxygen-containing compounds, formed by CO2 dissociation. The methane reaction is enhanced by 30 % (ρCH4 = 1.3) with a corresponding faradaic efficiency, ΛCH4 = 4.2, which denotes a non-Faradaic behavior. On the other hand, as mentioned above the RWGS reaction is inhibited (electrophobic behavior) by a ρ = 0.6, i.e., 40 % decrease of its initial catalytic rate. Both methanation and RWGS reaction catalytic rates are returning to their initial o.c. values, after potential interruption. During the depolarization, all the present ionic species (Oδ− or OHζ−) on the catalytic surface consumed by hydrogen. Upon negative polarization (Fig. 10a) a decrease in CO2 conversion of almost 4 %, with a simultaneously decrease of 10 % (ρCH4 = 0.9) in methanation rate and a 70 % increase of the RWGS reaction rate (ρCO = 1.2) is observed. The apparent faradaic efficiency values were found to be −1.7 and 0.1 for the methanation and the RWGS reaction, respectively. A similar potentiostatic transient under oxidizing conditions (PCO2/PH2 = 3/2) at the same temperature (370 °C) and gas flow rate (1000 cm3/min) is presented in Fig. 10b. As predicted in this case, the RWGS is the dominant reaction. Due to the excess of CO2 and the lack of H2, the adsorbed species of “CHxO” (with x = 0,1,2) resulted from the CO2 adsorption are easily transformed to CO rather than CH4. Therefore, the CO2 consumption rate and conversion as well are dictated by the RWGS reaction rate, which exhibits an electrophilic behavior (i.e. positive application leads to a decrease of the catalytic rate). CO2 conversion drops by 0.5 % with an application of + 2.5 V. The methanation rate, although it is extremely low, is 60 % enhanced by the positive polarization (ρ = 1.6), whereas the CO production is lowered by a factor of 20 % (ρ = 0.8). Conversely, the negative potential application is increasing the CO production rate about 10 %, while at the same time CH4 production decreases by 30 %, leading to 4 % increase of the CO2 consumption rate (ρCO2 = 1.04) and 0.3 % increase of the CO2 conversion. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) of CO2, CH4, and CO were determined using the obtained catalytic rates over the calculated reactive oxygen uptake, NG, which corresponds to the catalytic active surface area. According to Equation (7) the NG can be estimated using the relaxation time, τ, which is the time required for the reaction formation rate to reach the 63 % of its final value after positive polarization [40]: (7) τ = 2 F N G I where I is the observed current at the new steady-state after potential application. The calculated reactive oxygen uptake, NG, was estimated to be close to 2.58 × 10-5 mol O, both for reducing and for oxidizing conditions, denoting that this value is independent of the PCO2 and PH2 as represented in Fig. 11 . Comparing the TOF values, both for reducing and oxidizing conditions (Fig. 10a and 10b), one observes that upon PCO2/PH2 = 1/10 ratio, the calculated TOFs for CH4 are one order of magnitude higher (∼0.1 s−1) than the observed under PCO2/PH2 = 3/2 ratio (∼0.01 s−1) since the methanation catalytic rate is higher in lower PCO2/PH2 ratios. Conversely, the TOFs values for the RWGS reaction are almost five times higher (0.05 s−1) under oxidizing conditions in comparison to the observed upon reducing conditions (0.01 s−1), which favors the CO production rather than methanation. The aforementioned TOF values are very close to the literature mentioned ones [24,80]."
6,Conclusions,"We have utilized, for the first time, a scaled up monolithic electrochemical reactor for the kinetic study of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The results confirm earlier kinetic studies based on laboratory scale reactors, showing that the methanation reaction is positive order to the partial pressure of hydrogen and negative order to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide while RWGS reaction follows the opposite behavior. This suggests, in agreement with the rules of chemical and electrochemical promotion, that anodic polarization (supply of electronegative promoters on the catalytic surface) favors methane production while negative potential application favors the formation of carbon monoxide through the RWGS reaction. The characterization of the working electrode both with XRD and XPS indicates that the presence of hydrogen, even in small quantities, in the reaction feed keeps the working electrode in the metallic state. The TOFs achieved with the up scaled monolithic reactor, under both oxidizing and reducing conditions, align well with those achieved with laboratory scale reactors indicating the successful scale up of the process."
