0,Introduction,"In view of constantly increasing global energy demands and related environmental issues, the pursuit of renewable and ecofriendly energy sources has become extremely important [1,2]. In electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be performed in acidic, basic and neutral media [3]. Among these conditions, HER in basic and neutral media are the most challenging, as their kinetics are slowed by the requirement of an additional water dissociation step [4]. So far, various catalysts have been developed for HER. At present, Pt-based materials are still considered to be one of the most active catalysts for, but large-scale application is limited by their high price and scarcity [5]. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have gradually focused on non-precious metal materials with abundant reserves to prepare high-activity and low-cost electrocatalysts [6]. Various non-precious metals such as transition metals Fe [7,8], Cu [9,10], Ni [11–13], Co [14,15], Mo [16,17], etc, have been proven to be the very promising catalysts. In particular, the transition metal nickel-based electrocatalysts have high catalytic activity for HER, which exhibit strong corrosion resistance in alkaline solutions [18]. The outer layer electrons of metallic nickel have unpaired 3 d electrons, which are easy to pair with the 1s orbitals of ionized hydrogen atoms during the hydrogen evolution reaction to form M − H bonds, and exhibit a faster reaction rate [19]. In recent years, a large number of nickel-based catalysts widely used in HER have appeared and gradually replaced PtC commercial catalysts, such as Ni alloy [20], NiS [21], NiP [22] and Ni-based MOF [23] catalysts. Therefore, using Ni-based materials to reduce HER overpotential and improve stability has always been a hot research topic. Apart from metal-based materials, carbon-based materials have also become a member of low-cost materials with high catalytic activity for HER. Graphene has the advantages of good electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, and good mechanical properties [24,25]. It is widely used as a support material for electrocatalysts. Recently, more and more researchers have found that carbon materials have outstanding performance among HER catalysts [26]. In order to further improve the reaction activity of the transition metal catalysts and reduce the amount of metal in catalysts, a reasonable structural design between the carbon material and the transition metal in catalyst has important significance [27]. For example, Zhang et al. used a simple precipitation-phosphating process to uniformly load MoP nanoparticles onto the surface of carbon nanotubes [28]. The obtained MoP/CNT composite catalyst has high HER activity in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Han et al. obtained a composite material of transition metal phosphide (MoP, FeP) and porous carbon by ion exchange method. The material has high catalytic activity, and only needs an overpotential of 51 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm2 [29]. In this paper, the nickel particles were loaded on two kinds of carbon-based catalyst by a mild chemical method to obtain Ni/Graphene and Ni/Vxc-72 electrocatalysts. The effect of loading nickel on the HER performance in basic media was investigated. The results suggest that nickel can boost the HER activities of the catalysts."
1,Methods and experiments,
2,Nickel load on carbon-based materials,"2.1 Nickel load on carbon-based materials A chemical reduction method [30–32] was used to load nickel on two carbon-based materials. Firstly, the reagents of 1.8 g boric acid, 1.8 g nickel sulfate, 1.8 g trisodium citrate, 1.2 g ammonium chloride and 1.2 g ammonium sulfate were sequentially added to a beaker, which was put in a water bath at 60 °C, containing 20 mL deionized water for dissolution. Secondly, all the reagents dissolved and the solution cooled to room temperature (25 °C). The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.0 with sodium hydroxide. Then added the prepared 0.125 g graphene or Cabot superconducting carbon black (Vxc-72) into the solution, stirring at 30 °C for 30 min. Thirdly, a 25 mL solution containing 1.0 g sodium hypophosphate was added and maintained reaction for about 180 min. After reaction, the suction filtration was performed and the residual reaction solution was washed with deionized water for several times. Finally, the solid obtained by suction filtration was put into an oven at 50 °C and dried for 12 h to obtain the Ni/Graphene or Ni/Vxc-72 catalyst."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The morphologies of catalysts were analyzed through a JEM-3010 (JEOL, Japan) transmission electron microscope (TEM) at an acceleration of 120 kV, and a JSM-7500 F (JEOL, Japan, which was equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)) scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 20 kV, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer at a scanning rate of 40 min−1, using Cu-Kα radiation (λ＝1.5418 Å)). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired using a VG ESCALAB MK II spectrometer with a monochromatic Mg Ka source (1253.6 eV)."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements of catalysts for HER were carried out by electrochemical workstation (IVIUM 1307, Netherlands) using 1.0 M KOH at 25 °C. The electrochemical performance of the electrocatalysts was studied with a standard three-electrode system. 3.5 M Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode and a platinum plate was used as the counter electrode. 5 mg powder catalyst was added to 100 μL isopropyl alcohol and 5 μL Nafion solution (5 % wt%) in 395 μL deionized water to form a uniform ink by ultrasonic assistance. Then a micropipette was used to apply 6 μL ink to the center of the glassy carbon electrode and dried it at room temperature (25 °C) as a working electrode. The voltage range of the polarization curve was −0.5～0.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and the scan rate was 5 mV/s. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under an open circuit potential with a disturbance amplitude of 5 mV, and the frequency range was from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve was measured to record the electric double layer capacitance (C dl). The RHE calibration can be performed on the measured potential with the following formula: (1) E vs . RHE = E ( 3.5 M Ag / AgCl ) + 0.208 + 0.059 pH"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology It is shown in Fig. 1 a and b that Vxc-72 consists of irregular particles with the size from 30 to 100 nm. The particles are densely aggregated and the surface seems to smooth (shown in Fig. 1a). In contrast, the surface of Ni/Vxc-72 particles becomes rough and fluffy (shown in Fig. 1b), attributing to a number of nickel particles attached on the surface of Vxc-72. Meanwhile, it is showed in Fig. 1c that the graphene is in the form of a transparent flake. As shown in Fig. 1d some nickel nanoparticles are dispersed on the graphene flake. Thus, surface morphology observation reveals that nickel particles are successfully loaded on the surface of Vxc-72 and graphene. Further mapping analysis by EDS also reveals the existence of Ni and C elements in the Ni/Graphene structure (Fig. 2 ). It also indicates that the distribution of each element is uniform in the selected area. The phase composition of the catalysts is studied by XRD and the XRD patterns of Vxc-72, Ni/Vxc-72, Graphene and Ni/Graphene are shown in Fig. 3 . The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ of Ni/Vxc-72 XRD spectrum are 44.5°, 51.8°, 76.3°, respectively, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220) crystal planes of nickel (JCPDS PDF#41–1487). It demonstrates that nickel is successfully loaded on Vxc-72 [33]. Compared with pure Vxc-72, the (002) crystal plane peak of C in Ni/Vxc-72 (JCPDS PDF# 4–0850) is wider. It may be due to the nickel nanoparticles are loaded on the surface of Vxc-72, resulting in the diffraction lines of C become diffuse and broad. Therefore, it leads to the wider diffraction peak [34]. At the same time, the nickel diffraction peaks of Ni/Vxc-72 are stronger than that of Ni/Graphene, indicating that more nickel particles are loaded on the surface of Vxc-72. The possible explanation is that the morphology of Vxc-72 is beneficial to grow the nickel particles, which can be easier to aggregate and form the nickel particles. It is found that the nickel diffraction peaks of Ni/Graphene are not obvious compared with the sample of Ni/Vxc-72. This is due to the special two-dimensional lamellar structure of graphene will improve nucleus in the early stage of nickel particle growth. The more nickel nucleates on the graphene sheets, the smaller the size of nickel particles will be formed (as seen in TEM in Fig. 1d). So, the characteristic peak intensity of nickel in XRD pattern is relatively weak. On the other hand, the nickel particles loaded on the surface of the graphene lead to decrease the amount of carbon participate in diffraction per unit area. As a result, the peak intensity of the graphene (002) crystal plane becomes weaker, which can also prove the successful loading of nickel [35]. Furthermore, the surface elemental composition and electronic states of Ni/graphene and Ni/Vxc-72 were probed by XPS spectra analysis. The survey spectra (as shown in Fig. 4 a) indicate that the samples are constituted of nickel, carbon, and oxygen elements. In Fig. 4b the characteristic peaks of the C 1s in the XPS wide scan spectra can be observed. The C 1s spectra of the Ni/Graphene and Ni/Vxc-72 confirm that the spectra show a peak at 284.0 eV corresponding to CC bond. According to the high-resolution spectra of Ni 2p (shown in Fig. 4c), there are weak peaks of low energy band Ni 2p3/2 at 852.3 eV and high energy band Ni 2p1/2 at 869.9 eV, which can prove that metallic nickel exists in the samples [41,46]."
7,Electrochemical performance,"3.2 Electrochemical performance The HER activity of the catalysts is investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1.0 M KOH solutions (Fig. 5 a). It can be found form Table S1 that the overpotential of Ni/Graphene is as low as 29 mV (10 mA/cm), which is significantly smaller than Ni/Vxc-72 (107 mV), Graphene (412 mV) and Vxc-72 (476 mV). It is very close to the overpotential of commercial Pt/C (15 mV). The result indicates that Ni/Graphene catalyst has excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. Table 1 shows the hydrogen evolution performance of several supported nickel catalysts. It is found that our catalysts exhibit the excellent hydrogen generation activity. The Tafel slope is the intrinsic property of the material and the determining step of the reaction rate. It is also very important for evaluating the activity of the catalyst. Therefore, the pathway of HER can be judged according to the magnitude of the Tafel slope [36,37]. The Tafel slope derived from the polarization curve is shown in Fig. 5b. The Tafel slopes of Vxc-72, Graphene, Ni/Vxc-72 and Ni/Graphene are 136 mV/dec, 201 mV/dec, 116 mV/dec and 87 mV/dec, respectively. As expected, the Tafel slope of Ni/Graphene is the lowest, indicating that the Ni/Graphene catalyst has higher kinetic activity. The mechanism of the HER pathway meets Volmer-Heyrovsky. To further explain the efficient of HER performance, the Nyquist plots of different catalysts are shown in Fig. 5c. Compared to pure Vxc-72 and Graphene, it is obvious that Ni/Vxc-72 and Ni/Graphene have significantly reduced charge transfer resistance (R ct ) suggesting a higher conductivity between interface of the catalyst and electrolyte, and leading to eﬃcient HER kinetics [49]. While Vxc-72 and Graphene exhibit higher R ct values resulting in lower electron transfer rate and poorer HER activity. In addition, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) directly affects the active sites on the catalyst surface, which in turn affects the occurrence of the HER reaction. Fig. S1 shows the CV curves in the non-polarization potential range. The measured double-layer capacitance (C dl) is shown in Fig. 5d. At the same time, the corresponding ECSA value through calculation is obtained (the results are shown in Table S1). Obviously, Ni/Graphene has the largest ECSA, indicating that the hydrogen evolution reaction has the most active sites and the probability of the reverse reaction is greater. For the matrix materials, graphene has a larger ECSA than Vxc-72. Therefore, it can provide more active sites. At the same time, the value of C dl of Ni/Graphene is larger than Ni/Vxc-72. It may be that the synergistic effect of nickel particles and graphene improve the HER activity of the Ni/Graphene catalyst. Chronoamperometry measurements and long-term continuous cycling tests are used to evaluate the durability of Ni/Vxc-72 and Ni/Graphene. As shown in Fig. 6 a, within 12 h, the current density of Ni/Graphene and Ni/Vxc-72 in the electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) shows no significant change. It can be seen that under the same overpotential (−0.2 V vs. RHE), Ni/Graphene can obtain greater current density. It also indicates that Ni/Graphene has better hydrogen performance, which is consistent with the results of the previous polarization curves. In the same way, as presented in Fig. 6b, only slight attenuation can be observed by comparing LSV curves of the first cycle to the 500th cycle, confirming its remarkable durability of the catalysts."
8,Discussion catalytic mechanism,"3.3 Discussion catalytic mechanism According to the previous performance analysis, the possible catalytic mechanism of the two catalysts for HER in alkaline media is shown in Fig. 7 . From the Tafel slope value, we can infer that the hydrogen evolution mechanism of Graphene and Vxc-72 meets the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The first step of the reaction is the Volmer step ( H 2 O + M + e − → M ﹣ H a d s + OH − ). Proton exchange occurred between nickel and electrolyte leads to produce adsorbed hydrogen ions (H*). The second step is the Heyrovsky step ( M ﹣ H a d s + H 2 O + e − → H 2 , M represents metal nickel). Then the adsorbed H* combines with the H* in the water to form H2, which will be desorbed from the catalyst surface [50]. Therefore, the decisive factor affecting the hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst is to affect the adsorption and desorption of H*. On the one hand, in the entire hydrogen evolution process, the hydrogen evolution reaction needs to overcome the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔG (H*)) [51,52]. The ΔG (H*) of carbon matrix materials is between 0.2 eV and 0.3 eV (graphene is 0.22 eV), which is far away from the equilibrium position of 0 eV. So, the HER performance is poor. When the matrix material is loaded with nickel, ΔG (H*) will be significantly reduced (−0.08 eV), which is more conducive to the formation of adsorbed hydrogen ions and promotes HER reaction [53]. Meanwhile, the presence of graphene plays an important role due to its higher protons. Its thin layer affinity can stabilize the H* species. The increase of the electron density on the Ni/Graphene surface synergistically promotes the adsorption of hydrogen on the graphene sheet, and ultimately improves the HER activity [41,43]. On the other hand, the HER performance of Ni/Graphene is significantly better than Ni/Vxc-72. It is due to the nature of the matrix material itself. Because graphene is a two-dimensional single-layer structure. The graphene not only shows good electrical conductivity, but also its thin-layer structure makes the transfer of electrons among the layers fast, leading to a faster hydrogen evolution reaction. Vxc-72 is composed of countless carbon particles so that the transfer of electrons between particles is relatively slow due to the difference in particle spacing and size (as shown in Table S1, the Rct of Graphene is smaller than Vxc-72). Moreover, nano-Ni particles can enhance ECSA of matrix materials. Graphene with good conductivity is more able to promote proton and electron transport in the channel, resulting in low Tafel slope. Therefore, two-dimensional lamellar graphene generates additional electrochemically active sites compared with Vxc-72, which are the main sites for hydrogen evolution reaction, while maintaining high HER properties and enhancing chemical stability against acidic electrolytes [44]. That is why hydrogen evolution performance of Ni/Graphene is better than that of Ni/Vxc-72."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts by loading nickel on the surface of two kinds of carbon-based materials were synthesized by a mild method. The synergistic effect between the matrix material and nickel enhances the HRE performance of catalysts. Ni/Graphene has highest catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, with an overpotential of only 29 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 87 mV/dec. It also exhibits good stable performance within 12 h. The excellent HER performance is attributed to the special structure of graphene, which provides the fastest path for electron transfer. In addition, the presence of nickel can reduce the ΔG (H*), thereby promoting the adsorption of H* on the catalyst surface and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction."
