0,Introduction,"In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, significant attention has been paid to enhancing catalytic properties by the highly dispersed deposition of an active metal onto a support [1–3]. To minimize the consumption of precious metals and achieve the desired high dispersion, the preparation of small (i.e., nanometer or atomic scale) metal particles is of particular interest. Indeed, the recent development of nanochemistry offers efficient ways to load small nanoparticles (NPs) onto high surface area supports [4–6]. However, the organic capping molecules stabilize colloidal NPs must be removed to maximize the number of active sites on the NP surfaces [7,8]. Although the use of harsh washing conditions and high-temperature treatment methods has been applied to eliminate these organic molecules, the resulting colloidal NPs tend to be a poor alternative to existing supported catalysts prepared by general impregnation methods, due to the trace amount of organics [9,10]. As such, the development of an efficient preparation method to produce a highly dispersed active species on a support with a large specific surface area is of particular importance. With the increasing demand for eco-friendly products and the associated replacement of petroleum-based chemicals, the interest in biomass conversion has also increased [11–15]. As unsaturated oxygenate species are abundant in decomposed biomass components, the catalytic conversion of biomass derivatives, such as heterocyclic molecules containing alcohol or aldehyde moieties, is important not only for the energy industry but also to improve the fundamental understanding of various catalytic processes [16–24]. In this case, furfural (FAL) was selected as a model compound [22,23], as it can be catalytically converted into furan, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2-methylfuran (MF), furfuryl alcohol (FA), and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) through the reaction pathways shown in Scheme 1 . In furfural hydrogenation, production of FA has been most intensively studied, because FA can be used as a potential fuel/fuel additive or solvent for the production of resins [25]. On the other hand, THFA is widely used as an environmentally benign solvent, because it is degradable, less toxic, and more stable than unsaturated furan compounds. Furthermore, it is used as a feedstock for the preparation of 1,5-pentanediols which have applications in mono esters and polyurethane manufacturing [26–28]. Therefore, needs for the production of THFA from furfural are gradually increasing. To date, several catalysts have been employed for the selective hydrogenation of FAL, with its liquid-phase hydrogenation being carried out using supported metal catalysts based on copper chromite, Cu, Ni, Mo, Co, Pt, Rh, Re, and Pd [29–37]. The products obtained following the chemical transformation of FAL on such transition metal catalysts are mainly determined by the affinity of the reaction intermediates towards the metal itself. For example, FAL undergoes hydrogenation to FA on weakly-binding Cu catalysts through carbonyl adsorption [29,30], whereas “flat” adsorption through the furan ring is anticipated on Pd catalysts [31–32,38]. In addition, the Pd-catalyzed FAL hydrogenation demonstrated competition between the aldehyde hydrogenation and decarbonylation pathways upon variation in the reaction conditions and the specific characteristics of the Pd catalyst. Indeed, FAL undergoes selective hydrogenation to MF and THFA over Pd catalysts at low temperatures in the aqueous phase [39,40], while at higher temperatures, decarbonylation to furan is favored [31–32,40–43]. Recent results have also revealed that the activity and product selectivity are also affected by the size of NPs and the type of support employed [35–36,44–46]. Herein, we report preparation ways of supported catalysts composed of well-dispersed Pd NPs immobilized on a range of supports. The chemical reduction (CR), impregnation followed by thermal reduction (TR), and capillary inclusion of the Pd NPs (CI) were used for the preparation of the Pd NP catalysts [6]. To verify the efficiency of these methods in varying both the size of the Pd NPs and the degree of metal dispersion, the use of three different supports (i.e., carbon, SiO2, and Al2O3) were examined and the resulting supported catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 physisorption, CO chemisorption, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) techniques. Finally, liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation was conducted over the as-prepared Pd catalysts to determine the effect of the Pd catalyst structure on the catalytic activity and selectivity. We found higher performances in the production of THFA over highly dispersed Pd/C catalysts which were prepared by chemical reduction method than over conventional supported catalysts with larger Pd particles. The hydrogenation of FAL to THFA was significantly enhanced by highly dispersed small Pd NPs with large metallic Pd surface areas, which shown in high conversion and selectivity towards THFA."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Three different methods (i.e., CR, TR, and CI) were employed to prepare the supported Pd NP catalysts. The Pd/C catalysts were initially prepared using the CR method, which involved the pretreatment of carbon (Black Pearl 2000, Cabot Corp.) in acidic solution by sonication to enhance the textural properties of the support and render the surfaces more hydrophilic [47]. More specifically, carbon power (1.00 g) was sonochemically treated in a solution containing 4 M HNO3 and 4 M H2SO4 (30 mL) at 25 °C for 2 h. After this time, the modified carbon powder was filtered, washed with deionized (DI) water until the filtrate reached a pH of 5–6, and dried at 100 °C. The Pd precursors were prepared separately by dissolving palladium(II) chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 90%) in a 38% HCl solution to form dihydrotetrachloropalladate (H2PdCl4). A pre-determined amount of the H2PdCl4 solution was then added dropwise to a solution of trisodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7, 0.526 mM, Pd/trisodium citrate ratio = 10:1, Sigma-Aldrich, >98%) with stirring at 5 °C. The pH of the resulting solution was then adjusted to ∼7 by the addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 0.2 M aqueous solution, Sigma-Aldrich, >98%). The pretreated carbon sample was then combined with the Pd solution with stirring over 2 h to give the desired Pd loading (i.e., 5, 3, 1, 0.5, and 0.2 wt% Pd). A freshly prepared ice-cold sodium borohydride solution (5mL of a 0.3 M NaBH4 solution, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) was then added dropwise, and the mixture stirred for an additional 3 h at 5 °C. After filtration and washing with DI water to give a filtrate pH of 5–6, the final Pd/C catalysts were dried at 105 °C for 5 h. The obtained catalysts were labeled as xPd/C, where x is equal to the wt% of Pd in the catalyst. For preparation of the alumina-supported catalysts, commercial alumina (γ-Al2O3, Sigma-Aldrich) was purchased and used without modification. As a silica support, mesoporous silica, SBA-15, with a hexagonally ordered porous structure, was synthesized according to a previously reported method [48,49]. The supported Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2 catalysts containing 5 wt% Pd were then prepared using the above CR method and labeled as 5.0Pd/Al2O3(CR) and 5.0Pd/SiO2(CR). The impregnation and thermal reduction method was also employed for comparison. In this case, the Pd/SiO2 (5 wt% Pd) catalyst was prepared by adding mesoporous SiO2 to an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)2·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich). After drying, calcination was carried out at 400 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The resulting catalysts were thermally reduced under a flow of H2 (4% H2 in Ar) at 250 °C for 120 min to give the 5.0Pd/SiO2(TR) sample. Commercially obtained Pd/activated carbon (5 wt% Pd, Sigma-Aldrich) and Pd/Al2O3 (5 wt% Pd, Alfa Aesar) catalysts were employed for comparison and were labeled 5.0Pd/C(TR) and 5.0Pd/Al2O3(TR), respectively. Colloidal Pd NPs capped by poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Sigma-Aldrich, MW = 55000) were synthesized by the polyol reduction method. Briefly, 0.03 g of K2PdCl4 (0.1 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and 0.1 g of PVP were dissolved into 10 mL of ethylene glycol (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich, >99.8%) in a 50 mL three-neck round bottom flask [50]. The solution was heated to 50 °C and evacuated at this temperature for 20 min to remove water and oxygen under vigorous magnetic stirring. The flask was then heated to 200 °C and maintained at this temperature for 10 min under Ar atmosphere. The solution was then cooled to room temperature and an excess of acetone was poured into the solution. The resulting Pd NPs were precipitated by centrifugation and re-dispersed in ethanol. For the preparation of supported Pd catalysts by the CI method, the support powder was dispersed with the colloidal Pd NPs dispersed in excess ethanol [49]. After sonication for 1 h, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation and dried at 105 °C. The dried catalysts were calcined at 350 °C for 1 h in air to remove the PVP surfactant, then thermally reduced under a flow of H2 (4% H2 in Ar) at 250 °C for 2 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Several physical and chemical techniques were employed to characterize the supported Pd catalysts. Structural information, including the size of the Pd NPs on the support, was determined by TEM (JEOL JEM-1400). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) dark field and bright field images were also obtained. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen physisorption using a BESORP-max unit, while the Pd loading was verified by ICP-AES (Varian 700-ES). The XRD patterns of the obtained catalysts were recorded on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm). The average crystallite size was evaluated using XRD data and the Scherrer equation: L = k λ β cos θ Here, k = 0.94 is the shape factor, λ is the X-ray radiation wavelength, θ is the Bragg angle, and β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a certain diffraction peak. The dispersion of Pd was evaluated based on the CO adsorption capacity using a pulse technique (CO chemisorption, AutoChem II 2920, Micromeritics Instruments Co.). More specifically, the Pd/C sample was dried under air at 105 °C over 2 h prior to purging with He for 10 min in a U-shaped tube. The resulting sample was then heated to 200 °C under a flow of He, then H2 for 10 min, and He again for 10 min. Subsequently, pulses of CO were repeatedly injected to the carrier gas (He) at 50 °C until no further adsorption was detected (∼5–20 pulses). The Pd particle dispersion was estimated from the quantities of chemisorbed CO and Pd, assuming a ratio of 2:1 for the chemisorbed Pd atoms. Finally, N2 adsorption–desorption, ICP, and CO-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) (AutoChem II 2920, Micromeritics) investigations were performed using fresh catalyst samples, while the XRD and TEM measurements were carried out using the catalysts reduced with H2."
4,Reaction procedure and product analysis,"2.3 Reaction procedure and product analysis Prior to carrying out the reaction, all catalysts were reduced under H2 (4% H2 in Ar, flow rate = 100 mL/min) at 250 °C for 120 min. Avoiding exposure to air/moisture, a sample of the reduced catalyst (10 mg) was rapidly transferred into a 100-mL stainless-steel high-pressure reactor (Parr 5500) containing FAL (1g, Acros, 99%) and isopropanol (20 mL, Sigma-Aldrich). After flushing the reactor with hydrogen, it was pressurized with hydrogen to a pressure of 20 bar. The temperature of the reactor was then raised to 180 °C and maintained at the same temperature with stirring at 600 rpm for 5 h. After this time, the resulting liquid product was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a flame ionization detector (FID; Agilent 7820A) equipped with a capillary column (DB-Wax, 30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness). The following program was repeated: hold at 50 °C for 3 min, increase temperature to 50–100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and hold for 3 min, and increase temperature to 100–200 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min and hold for 3 min. The products were FA, THFA, furan, THF, MF, and others. Cyclopentanol was detected as a small amount in other products. In addition, FA (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), THFA (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), furan (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), THF (Alfa Aesar, 99%), and MF (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were tested as substrates in the reaction. Finally, the product conversion and selectivity were calculated and defined as follows: Conversion ( % ) = mol furfural consumed mol furfural fed × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = mol product formed mol furfural consumed × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of the various catalysts pretreated with H2 at 250 °C for 2 h are shown in Fig. 1 . As indicated, the reduced Pd catalysts (5 wt%) exhibited three distinct XRD peaks at 40.1, 46.6, and 67.6°, which corresponded to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of the Pd fcc structure (JCPDS No. 05-0681). The XRD peak intensities were influenced by both the type of support employed and the catalyst preparation method. For example, as shown in in Fig. 1a, the Pd/SiO2(CR) and Pd/SiO2(TR) catalysts produced sharp peaks, while Pd/C gave relatively broad peaks. Although it was hard to clearly distinguish the signals corresponding to Pd(1 1 1) in the Pd/Al2O3(CR) and Pd/Al2O3(TR) catalysts due to overlapping from the γ-Al2O3 peaks, it was apparent that peak intensities were greater for the Pd/SiO2 catalysts than for Pd/C. Indeed, the weak and broad peaks of the Pd/C catalysts indicate that small Pd NPs were dispersed homogeneously on the carbon support. Over the various samples prepared, broader Pd peaks were observed for the catalysts prepared by the CR method compared to those prepared by the TR method. The average Pd crystallite sizes were estimated from the most intense Pd(1 1 1) reflection using the Debye-Scherrer formula and are summarized in Table 1 . As expected from the XRD results, the mean size of the Pd NPs in the catalysts prepared by CR was smaller than those of the catalysts prepared by TR. The measured BET surface areas of the catalysts are also listed in Table 1, where it is apparent that the specific surface areas of the Pd/C catalysts prepared by the CR method (1205–1392 m2/g) were significantly higher than those prepared by the TR method and those based on Al2O3 and SiO2, likely due to the high surface area of the carbon support employed in their preparation. Significant structural information regarding the supported Pd NPs can be obtained from the TEM images shown in Fig. 2 . These images and the corresponding size distribution histograms of the reduced Pd catalysts indicate that the NPs present on the carbon support are smaller than those on the Al2O3 and SiO2 supports are. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 2a, Pd NPs with an average diameter of 2.3 nm were dispersed uniformly over the carbon surface, thereby confirming the XRD results. However, the Pd NPs of the Pd/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 2e and f) form large aggregates with mean diameters of 7.9 and 19.5 nm for the 5.0Pd/SiO2(CR) and 5.0Pd/SiO2(TR) catalysts, respectively. In addition, the spherical and homogeneously dispersed Pd NPs of the 5.0Pd/C catalysts were clearly observed by HRTEM (Fig. 3 a), while the HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3b confirms the presence of lattice fringes on the Pd(1 1 1) planes with a d-spacing of 0.22 nm, as determined from the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of a selected area (see Fig. 3b inset). Furthermore, the bright field scanning TEM (BF-STEM) (Fig. 3c) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 3d) images indicate that no aggregation or overgrowth of the Pd NPs took place on the carbon supports. These results confirm that the CR method facilitates the high dispersion of small Pd NPs over the supports. Indeed, the carbon support exhibited outstanding dispersion of Pd, which was also demonstrated by CO-adsorption measurements. In contrast, despite its high surface area (i.e., 592 m2/g), SBA-15, the mesoporous SiO2 support, did not exhibit homogeneous Pd NP dispersion following catalyst preparation via either the CR or TR methods. The Pd dispersions of the various catalysts were calculated based on CO adsorption measurements (Table 1), with a dispersion of 51.2% being achieved for the 5.0Pd/C catalyst, which is significantly greater than those obtained for the Al2O3 and SiO2 supports. It is expected that the high amount of surface oxygen species on the carbon support resulted from the acidic pretreatment method employed, thereby yielding a high Pd dispersion through specific interactions between the Pd precursor and the modified carbon surface. More specifically, upon oxidation of the carbon surface by sulfuric and nitric acids, oxygen-containing functional groups, such as carboxyl groups (COOH), hydroxyl groups (–OH), and carbonyl groups (CO) could be generated [51–53]. During catalyst preparation via the CR method, the Pd salts then interact with the surface oxygen groups to produce highly dispersed Pd NPs on the carbon surfaces in the presence of a suitable reducing agent and trisodium citrate as a stabilizer [47]. In contrast, the Al2O3- and SiO2-supported Pd catalysts exhibited significantly larger Pd NPs on their surfaces. It was apparent that the novel CR method provided an efficient route to the preparation of small (1.6–2.8 nm) and well-dispersed Pd NPs on carbon supports at all Pd loadings examined (0.2–5 wt%) (Fig. S1, see the Supplementary Material)."
7,FAL hydrogenation over various catalysts,"3.2 FAL hydrogenation over various catalysts The hydrogenation of FAL was carried out over the supported Pd catalysts (5 wt%) to examine the effect of metal dispersion and type of support on the catalytic activity and selectivity. Following the reaction of FAL in isopropanol under pressurized hydrogen gas (20 bar) at 180 °C for 5 h, the catalytic conversion and product selectivity were measured using a TCD and are summarized in Table 2 . Initially, the effect of the support was examined at a constant Pd loading of 5 wt%. Under all preparation methods employed herein, the FAL conversions obtained using the supported catalysts decreased in the following order: Pd/C (100%) > Pd/Al2O3 (78–92%) > Pd/SiO2 (9–31%), which indicated that a high Pd dispersion induced high conversions in the FAL hydrogenation reaction (Fig. 4 a). Upon comparison of the different preparation methods, we found that the Pd catalysts prepared by the CR method exhibited higher conversions than those prepared using the TR method, demonstrating again that the CR approach produced more efficient catalysts with higher Pd dispersions. As indicated in Fig. 4b, the selectivity yield was also influenced by the type of support. More specifically, the main product obtained following reaction over the Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts was FA, while THFA and MF were the dominant products over the Pd/C catalysts. Furthermore, furan was produced as a minor product from reaction over Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3, whereas THF was produced over the Pd/C catalysts. It appears that two parallel reaction pathways take place in the liquid-phase FAL hydrogenation over the Pd-supported catalysts: (i) Hydrogenation to FA and subsequent hydrogenation of FA to THFA or conversion to MF via hydrogenolysis, and (ii) conversion to furan via decarbonylation and subsequent hydrogenation to yield THF (Scheme 1). As shown in Fig. 4, Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 were selective towards FA formation (the carbonyl group hydrogenation product), while Pd/C promoted the total hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis of THFA and MF, respectively. Interestingly, the method of catalyst preparation also influenced the selectivity, with higher FAL conversions and higher quantities of THFA resulting from the reactions over catalysts prepared using the CR technique. These results therefore indicate that increased hydrogenation promoted the conversion of FAL. We investigated the relationship between the Pd dispersion and particle size on different supports and the FAL hydrogenation conversion, as it was previously established that the Pd particle size and dispersion were strongly influenced both by the type of support and by the preparation method employed. As indicated in Fig. 5 a, the conversion was increased as a function of Pd dispersion. In addition, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5a, large Pd particles were formed on the SiO2 support, while uniform small Pd NPs were formed on the carbon support. Furthermore, use of the CR preparation technique led to smaller Pd NPs than preparation by impregnation followed by TR. As such, the conversion and selectivity towards THFA were superior for the carbon support, due to the large surface area, enhanced metal dispersion, and small particle size of Pd, while Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 were selective towards FA formation. Moreover, the activity of Pd-based catalysts in the FAL hydrogenation reaction is known to depend on various properties, including crystal phase, pore structure, BET surface area, redox of the Pd species, acid-base sites, and interaction between Pd and the support oxides. Among these factors, the metallic surface area and metal dispersion are the key factors in determining catalyst activity. Indeed, a linear correlation was observed between the metallic Pd surface area and the FAL conversion (Fig. 5b), with 100% conversion being achieved on the Pd/C catalysts exhibiting a metallic surface area >6 m2/g. These observations indicate that the FAL hydrogenation activity increases upon increasing the metallic Pd surface area, generating core active sites. In this case, the support simply provides a surface to load the Pd species rather than playing any active role in the catalytic cycle."
8,FAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts,"3.3 FAL hydrogenation over Pd/C catalysts After establishing the carbon-supported Pd (5 wt%) catalyst prepared by the CR method as the optimal catalyst for FAL conversion, we focused on the effect of Pd loading on the catalytic reaction. As expected, the results shown in Table 3 and Fig. 6 indicate that the FAL conversion increased as a function of Pd loading. Upon increasing the Pd loading, the conversion and selectivity towards THFA increased significantly at the expense of FA, with complete FAL conversion being accompanied by a THFA selectivity of 64% over the 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst. Slight differences were also observed for the furan and MF selectivities upon increasing the Pd loading. More specifically, an increased Pd loading from 0.2 to 5 wt% resulted in a decreased selectivity towards furan (from 18 to < 1 wt%), while the MF selectivity increased from 7 to 11 wt%, demonstrating that a high Pd loading facilitated the production of fully hydrogenated products, such as THFA. Furthermore, as indicated in Fig. 6b, increased metallic Pd surface areas originating from high Pd loadings exhibited a linear relationship with the FAL conversion for Pd loadings of 0.2–1.0 wt% Pd/C, reaching 100% conversion with loadings of 3.0–5.0 wt% on the Pd/C catalysts. We concluded that increased Pd loadings provided additional active Pd sites for hydrogenation reactions, thereby increasing the FAL conversion and THFA selectivity through the hydrogenation of both CC and CO groups. The effect of reaction time over the 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst was investigated on the FAL conversion and product selectivity. As shown in Fig. 7 , the conversion of FAL increased upon increasing the reaction time. More specifically, after 0.1 h, a conversion of 78% was achieved, which increased steadily to 100% after 1 h. The formation of FA, THFA, and MF was also monitored. Although the selectivity towards FA decreased steadily upon increasing the reaction time to the extent that almost no FA was formed after 5 h, the selectivity towards THFA increased from 16 to 64% under the same conditions. These results indicate the stepwise nature of the reaction, in which the initial hydrogenation of C = O yielded FA, while subsequent ring hydrogenation of FA produced THFA in the second step. For recycling test, 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst was selected. In detail, 40 mg of Pd/C catalyst was loaded with FAL (2g) in 20 mL of isopropanol under pressurized hydrogen gas (20 bar) at 180 °C for 5 h. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration from the reaction mixture, washed with ethanol, and dried in air at 100 °C for 2 h. Then the catalysts was used for next run after hydrogen reduction. After 5 cycles were performed with the retrieved catalysts, no significant change was found in conversion and yield (Fig. S2, see the Supplementary Material), although a little decrease of THFA yield was found. It is demonstrated that 5 wt% Pd/C possesses a high reactivity and stability for recycling."
9,FAL hydrogenation over colloidal Pd NP catalysts,"3.4 FAL hydrogenation over colloidal Pd NP catalysts Recently, the preparation of colloidal metallic NPs of uniform size has been reported, and so to verify the possibility of colloidal NPs being an efficient commercial catalyst, we prepared Pd NPs via the polyol reduction method and deposited these NPs on various supports according to the CI method [49–50]. TEM images of the as-synthesized uniform Pd NPs encapsulated by PVP are shown in Fig. 8 a, where an average diameter of 2.8 nm is apparent. Because the surfactant PVP affected catalytic performance in FAL hydrogenation, thermal treatment of PdNP/C catalysts at 350 °C for 1 h in air was carried out to remove PVP (see Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Material). Following deposition of the obtained Pd NPs onto carbon and SiO2 supports, followed by thermal treatment at 350 °C in air and reduction by H2 at 250 °C resulted in an increase in the average NP diameters to 5.6 and 7.3 nm for the PdNP/C and PdNP/SiO2 catalysts, respectively (Fig. 8b and c). Interestingly, the carbon support significantly stabilized the Pd NPs against sintering during thermal treatment (Fig. S4, see the Supplementary Material). The activities of the supported Pd NP catalysts, prepared using the CI technique, were compared to those of the catalysts prepared via the CR method. As shown in Fig. 8d, both the Pd/C(CR) and PdNP/C(CI) catalysts exhibited high activities in the hydrogenation of FAL, which correlates with the obtained Pd dispersion results. In addition, although both SiO2-based Pd catalysts gave low conversions, PdNP/SiO2 (20% conversion) exhibited a higher conversion than Pd/SiO2 (6% conversion). Indeed, the TEM image shown in Fig. 8c clearly indicates that the Pd NPs present in the PdNP/SiO2 catalysts were distributed more homogeneously than those of the Pd/SiO2 catalysts (see Fig. 2e), contributing to the enhanced conversion. Furthermore, compared with product selectivities obtained for the carbon-supported Pd catalysts, the PdNP/SiO2 and PdNP/SiO2 catalysts tended to generate products with a lower degree of hydrogenation. It was clear that carbon played an important role in the high Pd dispersion of the catalysts, which ultimately resulted in high FAL conversions."
10,Conclusion,"We reported the preparation of highly dispersed and ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on carbon, silica, and alumina supports using a chemical reduction (CR) method in the presence of sodium borohydride and a trisodium citrate stabilizer. The obtained catalysts were applied in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural (FAL). Among the various catalysts examined, Pd/C exhibited the highest activity in the FAL hydrogenation reaction, in addition to exhibiting high selectivity towards tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) formation due to the high metal dispersion and small Pd particle size compared to those of the other supported catalysts (i.e., on SiO2 and Al2O3). In addition, the product selectivity was highly dependent on the type of support employed, with Pd/SiO2 and Pd/Al2O3 facilitating carbonyl group hydrogenation (to yield furfuryl alcohol, FA), while Pd/C was selective towards ring hydrogenation (producing THFA). Furthermore, the catalyst preparation method also influenced the obtained conversion and product selectivity. More specifically, the Pd catalysts prepared via the CR method exhibited smaller particle sizes and higher metal dispersions, leading to greater conversions than those achieved using the catalysts prepared via the impregnation followed by thermal reduction (TR) method. These results indicated that the increased metal loadings on the Pd/C catalysts provided additional active sites for the hydrogenation reaction to take place, thereby increasing the total conversion and exhibiting selectivity towards THFA. It is expected that the acidic pretreatment of carbon was responsible for the high metallic dispersion of small Pd NPs. Moreover, the variation in product selectivity as a function of reaction time revealed that the hydrogenation of FAL over the Pd/C catalyst induced a sequential hydrogenation step, where hydrogenation of the FAL carbonyl group produced FA, which was followed by ring hydrogenation to give THFA. Colloidal Pd NPs of uniform size (i.e., 2.8 nm) were also synthesized and dispersed on the carbon, silica, and alumina supports for application in the FAL hydrogenation reaction. However, the PdNP/C catalysts exhibited lower conversions than the Pd/C(CR) catalysts. The FAL hydrogenation reaction was also influenced by the metallic Pd surface areas of the catalysts. From these results, it was concluded that optimal catalyst activity and product selectivity was achieved using the CR preparation method and acidic pretreatment of the carbon support to ultimately yield an exceptionally high metallic Pd surface area and highly dispersed catalytic species. We expect that our developed method will promote the formation of highly dispersed active catalytic species on large specific surface area supports for application in biomass catalysis, ultimately to address the increasing demand for eco-friendly products and the associated replacement of petroleum-based chemicals."
