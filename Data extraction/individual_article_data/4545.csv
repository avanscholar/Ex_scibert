0,Introduction,"Renewable resources have attracted much attention due to their potential applications as substitutes for petrochemical-based feedstocks. In this respect, the production of organic compounds, raw materials, intermediates, fine chemicals, organic polymers, solvents, among others, based on renewable resources has been the main subject of numerous investigations since they represent a serious alternative to achieve sustainable development. It is well known that raw materials such as diols and polyols have been extensively used to synthesize polyurethanes (PUs) through polycondensation reaction. Diols and macrodiols with functionality two lead to linear thermoplastic PUs, whereas polyols with three or more hydroxyl group are required to prepare polyurethane networks [1,2]. In this regard, alcohols, diols and polyols can be obtained from bio-based resources such as vegetable oils and their derivatives (fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids), terpenes and terpenoids [3–5]. Fatty alcohols (long chain hydrocarbon alcohols) such as 10-undecen-1-ol (10un) can be obtained from castor oil (Ricinus communis) by pyrolysis under vacuum and reduction with LiAlH4 at 0 °C [5–7]. Commonly, diols can be prepared from dicarboxylic acids since these groups are susceptible to being reduced by hydrogenation. The Ru–Sn–Al2O3 catalyst has been used for hydrogenation of dicarboxylic groups in the succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, phthalic, isophthalic, terephthalic acids gave the corresponding diols. In all cases the yield was strongly dependent on the length of the chain. In this respect, the yield of 1,4-butanediol prepared from succinic acid was only 10.8%, meanwhile, long chain acids such as suberic and azelaic acids gave diols with good yields (74.2–89.4%) [8]. Furthermore, diols and polyols had been prepared via oxirane ring-opening reaction of epoxidized unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of dibutyltin dilaurate as catalyst. The number of hydroxyl groups depends directly from the number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chains [9]. On the other hand, they are 25,000 known species of terpenes and terpenoids. These natural occurring compounds include not only natural rubber (NR) that is a linear polyterpene which is isolated from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis and other tropical plants [10,11], but also many other terpenes that have been used as flavoring and fragrance [12]. In regard to transformation of terpenes into diols and polyols authors have reported the transformation of citronellal to menthane-3,8-diol by Solanum aviculare [13] or by treatment with sulfuric acid (0.25% w, 50 °C, products crystallized from n-heptane at −50 °C, for 20 h) [14], and the transformation of β-citronellol by the fungi Cystoderma carcharias into 3,7-dimethyl-1,6,7-octane-triol and the allylic diols: 2,6-dimethyl-2-octene-1,8-diol, 3,7-dimethyl-5-octene-1,7-diol and 3,7-dimethyl-7-octene-1,6-diol [15]. Olefin metathesis has proved to be a powerful tool in advance organic synthesis. In contrast with methods aforementioned above, telechelic compounds (well-defined compounds by their structure, molecular weight and with an average number of functional groups per chain (Fn) close to 2) have been obtained by metathesis reaction [16–18]. However, the preparation of hydroxytelechelic compounds (such as the macrodiols) has been a challenging task for years, even using the metathesis reaction. Many reports indicate that several aspects such as chain transfer agent (CTA) (steric hindrance or highly functionalized unsaturated alcohols), catalyst, solvent (coordinating and non-coordinating) and olefin ring-strain all dramatically affect the hydroxytelechelic synthesis. Thus, for example, unprotected alcohols as CTA's are not completely compatible with the Ru-catalysts. More specifically, catalyst [RuCl2(PCy3)2 (=CPh2)] (first generation Grubbs catalyst) decomposes rapidly in the presence of the free alcohol cis-2-butene-1,4-diol (CTA), this suggest that the number of active sites has an important decrease avoiding the formation of products in the reaction media [19]. Thus, changing the catalyst by [(1,3-dimesityl-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene) (PCy3)Cl2Ru-(=CHCHC(CH3)2)] (alkylidene-vinylidene catalyst) in the polymerization process of cyclooctadiene (COD) via ring opening metathesis (ROMP), in the presence of the aforementioned CTA, using tetrahydrofuran as solvent (THF); a modest yield 29% was obtained [20]. The latter can be attributed by the coordination between oxygen (coming from the THF solvent) and ruthenium center after the phosphine dissociation in the catalyst. Nevertheless, using a non-coordinating solvent such as 1,2-dicloroethane or benzene side reactions may occur, and it promote isomerization of hydroxyl group lead to enolic (aldehyde) compound even after the CTA has been incorporated into the polymer chains [21]. Besides, it is important to note that ring-strain energy of metathesis substrates has been shown to significantly affect the monomer reactivity toward ring-opening metathesis polymerization, since the tension of the ring in olefin acts as driving force towards metathesis reaction, the more ring-strain, the most reactivity observed. For instance, strained seven-member norbornene exhibits significantly enhanced reactivity over less strained eight-member cyclooctadiene (COD) and dimethylcyclooctadiene (DMCOD) [22,23]. The development of highly active metathesis catalysts has allowed the synthesis of hydroxytelechelic compounds with Fn close to 2, by a route involving two steps: ROMP of cyclic olefins in the presence of CTA bearing a hydroxy-type protector group and further deprotection [19,24,25]. In contrast, we report, an original strategy of synthesis of macrodiols in one-pot reaction approach via cross-metathesis degradation from natural rubber and cis-1,4-polybutadiene using as CTA's fatty alcohols (9-decen-1-ol and 10-undecen-1-ol) and an acyclic monoterpenoid (β-citronellol) with the catalyst [(1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro (o-isopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium] (second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst). Macrodiols from bio-based resources with control on the molecular weight and Fn close to 2 are reported. Also, the diols preparation via self-metathesis of fatty alcohols and β-citronellol with high yields are described."

3,Techniques,"2.2 Techniques Proton (1H) and carbon 13 (13C) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, both conducted at 298 K, in deuterated chloroform CDCl3. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal standard. Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements, all samples were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Frontier MIR FT-IR spectrometer fitted with a Frontier Universal Diamond/ZnSe ATR with single reflection top-plate and pressure arm. Data are presented as the frequency of absorption (cm−1). The spectra were recorded in the region of 4000–500 cm−1. The molecular weight (M n ) and molecular weight distributions (M w /M n ) were determined with reference to monodisperse polystyrene standards on a Waters 2695 ALLIANCE gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) instrument, at 30 °C, with tetrahydrofuran (THF), a universal column and a flow rate of 0.30 ml/min. HPLC-MS analysis was conducted in an Agilent 1260 Liquid Chromatography equipment coupled to an Agilent 6530 Mass Spectrometer (ESI-TOF). The column utilized for HPLC measurements was a Poroshell 120 EC-C8 (3.00 × 50 mm x 2.70 μm) at 30 °C, flow 0.50 mL/min with an injection volume of 25.00 μL. The conditions for the mass spectrometer were set as follows: the auto MS parameter, positive ion mode (ESI+) and nitrogen drying with a flow of 8 L/min, nebulizer at the pressure of 35 psi, gas temperature at 300 °C. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Microflex software equipped with a nitrogen laser that operates to λ = 337 nm. All mass spectra were obtained in the linear mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The irradiation targets were prepared from THF solutions using 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) as matrix and silver trifluoroacetate (AgTFA) as cationization agent in a 1:5:1 polymer: matrix:salt ratio."
4,Synthesis of diols via self-metathesis using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol,"2.3 Synthesis of diols via self-metathesis using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol The synthesis of diols 1,18-diol, 1,20-diol and 1,12-diol were carried out via self-metathesis of fatty alcohols 9de (5 ml, 28 mmol), 10un (5 ml, 25 mmol) and monoterpene βc (5 ml, 27.50 mmol); respectively, in the presence of second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst in a molar ratio [CC]/[Ru] = 500. All reactions were conducted in a glass vial under a dry nitrogen atmosphere, in the absence of solvent, at temperature of 60 °C. For the products 1,18-diol and 1,20-diol, ethylene is generated as a by-product, in both cases pressure was released letting escape ethylene-gas, promoting the formation of diols, after 6 h of reaction and no further purification, the corresponding diols were obtained as viscous slight yellow liquids with 98% of purity (for 1,18-diol and 1,20-diol) in yields higher than 92%. After 8 h, the self-metathesis reaction of βc generates 1,12-diol and 2,3-dimethyl-but-ene (DMB). The latter compound, consider as by-product can be easily removed by heating the crude mixture above 80 °C. (DMB: bp 73 °C, 760 mmHg). All diols were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C- NMR and HPLC-MS."
5,"Synthesis of macrodiols via cross-metathesis degradation of cis-1,4-polybutadiene using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol","2.4 Synthesis of macrodiols via cross-metathesis degradation of cis-1,4-polybutadiene using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol The synthesis of macrodiols was carried out via cross-metathesis degradation of polybutadiene (PB) (3.00 g, 55.50 mmol) using fatty alcohols (9de, 10un) and monoterpene βc as chain transfer agents CTA's, with different molar ratio of double bonds of PB to CTA ([PB]/[CTA] = 1:1, 10:1, 20:1 and 50:1) in the presence of second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst in a molar ratio of [PB]/[Ru] = 500. All reactions were carried out in a glass vial under a dry nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 60 °C (9de, 10un) and 80 °C ( βc). After terminating the reaction by addition of a small amount of ethyl vinyl ether (0.30 ml, 3.00 mmol), the solution was poured into an excess of methanol. The products were isolated and dried under vacuum giving a viscous brown liquid as product (the viscosity of macrodiol depends on the molecular weight); yield (97–99%); purity (98%). The macrodiols were characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR, GPC and MALDI-TOF."

A slightly difference between molar ratio of double bonds of NR to CTA was performed as follows: [NR]/[CTA] = 1:1, 10:1 and 50:1. Degradations were carried out in glass vials under nitrogen atmosphere at 60 °C (9de, 10un) and 80 °C ( βc).

Finally, the products (viscous brown liquid, with a purity of 98%) were characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR, GPC and MALDI-TOF."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Diols via self-metathesis using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol,"3.1 Diols via self-metathesis using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol The unsaturated diol compounds occur from the self-metathesis reaction from fatty alcohols and a natural acyclic monoterpenoid. Scheme 1 shows the self-metathesis reactions of the α-olefins 9-decen-1-ol (9de), 10-undecen-1-ol (10un) and the acyclic β-citronellol ( βc) using second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs as catalyst ([CC]/[Ru] = 500). In all cases, the reactions were run in the absence of solvent. In such reactions, the unsaturated diols octadec-9-ene-1,18-diol (1,18-diol), icos-10-ene-1,20-diol (1,20-diol) and 3,10-dimethyl-dodec-6-ene-1,12-diol (1,12-diol) were obtained as major products. It is important to mention that in the self-metathesis reactions of fatty alcohols (α-olefins) the formation of diols was favored by the release of ethylene (by-product) from the reaction media. In the case of βc self-metathesis 2,3-dimethyl-but-2-ene (DMB) was form as by-product. The products obtained from the self-metathesis of fatty alcohols 9de and 10un were identified by 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis. Fig. 1 shows 1H NMR spectra of 10un initial (A) and 1,20-diol (B) prepared via self-metathesis. Signals at 5.86–5.76 ppm and 5.02–4.91 ppm that corresponded to the proton of the double bond (=CH) and the protons of a vinyl group (CCH2) respectively, in the fatty alcohol disappeared (Fig. 1A), and a new broader signal appeared at 5.38 ppm that was attributed to the formation of the internal double bond of the diol (HCCH) (Fig. 1B). The signal at 3.63 ppm correspond to the protons close to the hydroxyl groups (CH2–OH) in unsaturated 1,20-diol. A similar result was observed with the double bonds of the 9de that were converted into 1,18-diol. On the other hand, the cis and trans isomers of the 1,20-diol were detected by 13C NMR analysis (Fig. 1C). The spectrum shows signals at 132.59 ppm and 131.93 ppm that corresponded to the cis and trans configuration (CC), respectively. It has been demonstrated that α-olefin metathesis is accompanied by the exchange of methylene groups during dissociation of catalyst and this reaction occurs significantly faster than the metathesis of olefins with internal double bonds [22]. Thus, the 9de and 10un conversions to the corresponding unsaturated diol resulted greater than 92% according to the isolated product and the absence of by-product signals in 1H NMR and HPLC-MS spectra. Fig. 2 A shows the HPLC-MS mass-spectra of the unsaturated 1,20-diol with molecular weight of 312 g/mol. Likewise, the self-metathesis of the βc under the same conditions mentioned above were studied. Thus, such acyclic monoterpenoid were converted to 1,12-diol and 2,3-dimethyl-but-2-ene (DMB) with yields ranging from 37 to 45%. The conversion of βc was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 3 B). The self-metathesis of βc using second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst gave a conversion of 51% towards 1,12-diol with a mixture of cis-trans isomers (69% of trans structure). The diol olefinic signals are observed at 5.42–5.23 ppm, which correspond to the cis and trans double bonds of the unsaturated diol. Also, signals located at 2.33 ppm and 2.25 ppm are assigned to = C–CH2 methylene group in the diol molecule. It can see that the signals of the DMB arising in 1.70 ppm correspond to the protons of CH3. This compound is considered by-product and it can be easily removed by evaporation of the reaction media (DMB: bp 73 °C, 760 mmHg). Fig. 2B shows the HPLC-MS mass-spectra of the unsaturated 1,12-diol with molecular weight of 228 g/mol. Experimental studies have demonstrated that monoterpenes as β-pinene and d -limonene did not undergo productive self-metathesis reaction [26–29]. Computational modeling of monoterpene β-pinene metathesis using second-generation Grubbs catalyst demonstrated that the initiation step leads to the formation of tertiary instead of primary metalcarbene, which in turn undergoes the nonproductive metathesis reaction with β-pinene. Thus, the self-metathesis productive reaction path is inhibited by unfavorable kinetic and thermodynamic factors [28]. In contrast with the monoterpenes afforded above, the acyclic monoterpene βc undergoes productive self-metathesis reaction due steric hindrance is avoided. Indeed, in this case, during the initiation step in self-metathesis, a secondary metalcarbene is formed and propagates the productive reaction. On the other hand, Table 1 show comparative data of various methods reported in literature [2,5,30,31] for synthetize diols. The comparative analysis showed that diols can be prepared in high yields under mild conditions according to the self-metathesis of fatty alcohols and β-citronellol performed in this work."
9,"Macrodiols via cross-metathesis degradation of natural rubber and cis-1,4-polybutadiene using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol","3.2 Macrodiols via cross-metathesis degradation of natural rubber and cis-1,4-polybutadiene using fatty alcohols and β-citronellol In order to prepare macrodiols (hydroxytelechelic compounds) both NR and PB were degraded via metathesis reaction 9de, 10un and βc, according to Scheme 2 . Currently, there are not reports about cross-metathesis degradation of unsaturated polymers using fatty alcohols and the monoterpenoid β-citronellol as CTA's. Reactions were carried out using second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst. All results are summarized in Table 2 . According to the metathesis degradation reactions (Table 2) the NR and the PB were degraded in a controlled manner with high yields in a range of 97%–99% and molecular weight distributions (M w /M n ) close to 2. Thus, macrodiols with an average number of functional groups per chain (Fn) close to 2 were obtained by cross-metathesis degradation of PB with different fatty alcohols (9de and 10un) and the monoterpenoid βc as CTA's (Entries 1 to 9, Table 2). Fig. 4 displays the comparative FT-IR spectra of cis-1,4-polybutadiene before (A) and after of their cross-metathesis degradation with 10un (B) and βc (C). In contrast with Fig. 4A, Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C show a broad absorption band at 3400-3500 cm−1 that is associated to –OH stretching vibration of the macrodiols. The formation of macrodiol also was confirmed by 1H NMR. Fig. 5 shows the comparative 1H NMR spectra of PB before (A) and after of their cross-metathesis degradation with 10un (B) and βc (C). In (A) spectrum the signal at 5.30 ppm corresponds to the olefinic proton (=CH) of PB and the signal at 2.00 ppm corresponds to methylene protons (CH2). In (B) spectrum the signals that appeared in the range of 5.50–5.60 ppm were attributed to the formation of the double bonds (HCCH) between the PB and the CTA (10un) and the signal at 3.53 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons attached to the hydroxyl groups (CH2–OH) in the unsaturated macrodiol. In (C) spectrum the signals that appeared in the range of 5.50–5.60 ppm were also attributed to the formation of the double bond (HCCH) between the PB and the CTA ( βc) and the signal at 3.60 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons attached to the hydroxyl groups (CH2–OH) in unsaturated macrodiols. In all cases, in 1H NMR spectra were not observed signals corresponding to aldehyde groups. This suggests that the side reaction involving isomerization of free alcohol to give the corresponding enol (aldehyde) is not occurring. This is according with the reports where aldehyde as byproducts were observed in metathesis reactions with short chain alcohols. The fatty alcohols and the acyclic monoterpenoid are long chain CTA's [32]. Moreover, it was shown that both 10un and βc are effective CTA's in metathesis degradation of PB due to they allowed to control the molecular weight of the macrodiols varying the molar ratio [PB]/[CTA]. These results are clearly depicted in Fig. 6 . For instance, using 10un as CTA, macrodiols with molecular weights of 561, 930, 1,587 and 3,350 g/mol were obtained changing the molar ratio [PB]/[10un] = 1:1, 10:1, 20:1 and 50:1, respectively (Entries 2–5, Table 2). Similar results were observed using βc as CTA (Entries 6–9, Table 2). Thus, the molecular weights obtained by GPC were slightly higher than predicted values (MW Theoretical) and may be explained by the differences in hydrodynamic volume of the macrodiols and the polystyrene standards used for calibration. Besides, the molecular weights obtained by 1H NMR end-groups analysis were in excellent agreement with their theoretical values (based on yield). On the other hand, MALDI-TOF was used to analyze the products distribution of metathesis degradation reactions. Fig. 7 depicts the mass spectrum of the products of PB with βc (Entry 8, Table 2). According with the spectrum, the average peak-to-peak distance is in a good agreement with the molar mass of the monomer repeat unit of 54 g/mol. Moreover, the spectrum is dominated by a series of peaks ranging from a mass of 1,523 g/mol to a mass of 1,901 g/mol, corresponding to the macrodiols with bis-hydroxy terminated groups doped with Ag+ ions. The theoretical masses were calculated by equation following: mass = m (end group) + m (repeating units) + m (Ag+); m = 228 + m (54) + Ag+; where the values of monomer repeat units (m) varying from m = 22 to m = 29. The theoretical PB/CTA molar ratio using in such reaction was m = 20. It is noteworthy that, varying the PB/CTA molar ratio the molecular weight of the products was controlled despite the olefins used as CTA are not symmetric. These results indicate that both CTA (10un and βc) not only aids in regulating molecular weight but also effectively transfers the functionality. As has been mentioned above, the metathesis reactions were carried out using asymmetric CTA's, its means that in addition to the macrodiols other compounds can be obtained. For instance, when the 10un was used as CTA in the cross-metathesis degradation of the rubber: macrodiols, oligomers terminated by –OH on one end and = CH2 on the other (I), α,ω-vinyl terminated oligomers (II) and ethylene (Scheme 3 ) were formed as products. The 1H NMR technique showed evidence of the formation of such compounds. In the spectrum (B) (Fig. 5), the signal around 4.90 ppm was attributed to the protons of methylene end groups (=CH2) correspond to products I and II. However, the intensity of such signal is much lower than the corresponding signal of methylene attached to the hydroxyl groups (CH2–OH) in the unsaturated macrodiol at 3.63 ppm. It means that the equilibrium is shifted to the macrodiols formation due to the release of ethylene. It has been observed that there are not steric or electronic impediments for the fatty alcohols or βc macrodiols to be completely converted into macrodiols. The formation (in low yields) of the products I and II derived from to use of an asymmetric CTA (9de, 10un and βc) can be avoided if before of the metathesis degradation reaction is carried out the self-metathesis reaction of the CTA. Thus, the self-metathesis reaction of 10un or βc it can be conduct according to Scheme 1 to produce the corresponding symmetric CTA (1,20-diol or 1,12-diol, respectively) and ethylene and DMB which can be easily separated. For instance, the ethylene can be eliminated by simple pressure release and the equilibrium is shifted towards the symmetric CTA formation, with a high conversion (higher than 98%). After this reaction, in the same reactor, with the same catalyst, the metathesis degradation reaction can be carried out by simple addition of the rubber. In the other hand, macrodiols (hydroxytelechelic compounds) were obtained in one-pot reaction via metathesis degradation from NR using fatty alcohols (9de and 10un) and the monoterpenoid βc as CTA's. The results are depicted in Table 2 (Entries 10–15). The molecular weight of NR before the metathesis degradation was 1.70 × 106 g/mol and after that the number average molecular weight of the macrodiols obtained with the several CTA's was ranged from Mn = 1,100 g/mol to Mn = 13,650 g/mol with a polydispersity index (M w /M n ) close to 2. In all cases, the experimental molecular weights (determined by GPC and end-groups 1H NMR analysis) were higher than the corresponding theoretical values. Furthermore, the results indicated that the molecular weight can be partially controlled by changing the molar ratio of double bonds of NR to CTA [NR]/[CTA] = 1:1, 10:1 and 50:1 (Entries 11–13, Table 2). In spite of the limitations in the molecular weight control, the results are interesting due to the values achieved allow the application of diols and macrodiols in the synthesis of polyurethanes (PU). Industrially, for such application the molecular weight of diol and macrodiols are ranging between M n = 500 to 3,000 g/mol. It is worth to noting that, a better control in the molecular weight of the macrodiols was obtained in the metathesis degradation reactions of PB (Entries 2–9, Table 2) than the metathesis degradation reactions of NR (Entries 11–15, Table 2), under the same reaction conditions and with the same CTA's. The NR is a polymer with trisubstituted unsaturations and such substrates are traditionally challenging for metathesis catalysts. The reports indicate that, reactivity of polymers with trisubstituted unsaturations noticeably decrease compared with the polymers with disubstituted unsaturations. It has been showed that the NR degraded much slower than the PB and other polyalkenamers with disubstituted unsaturations [33–35]. This may be explained due to the presence of an alkyl group directly linked to the double bond which can impede the coordination reaction with a metal active center of the second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst. Indeed, the computational modeling has showed that the metathesis reactions of trisubstituted olefins will always have higher activation energies compared to those of disubstituted olefins. The metalcarbene active center having a highly substituted carbene will show the elevated activation energy compared to the less substituted metal-carbene [36]. The formation of macrodiols from NR was confirmed by 1H NMR. Fig. 8 depicts the comparative 1H NMR spectra of NR before (A) and after of their cross-metathesis degradation with 10un (B) and βc (C). In (A) spectrum the signal at 5.05 ppm corresponds to the olefinic proton (=CH) of NR, the signal at 2.00 ppm corresponds to methylene protons (CH2) and the signal at 1.50 ppm correspond to the protons of methyl substituent group (-CH3). In the spectrum (B) the signals range at 5.00–5.30 ppm were attributed to the formation of the double bond (HCCH) between the NR and the CTA (10un), the signal at 3.57 ppm corresponds to the protons of methylene group attached to the hydroxyl groups (CH2–OH) in the unsaturated macrodiol. In the spectrum (C) the signals range of 5.09–5.21 ppm were attributed to the formation of the double bond (HCCH) between the NR and βc. The signal at 3.62 ppm corresponds to the protons of methylene group attached to the hydroxyl groups (CH2–OH) in the unsaturated macrodiol. MALDI-TOF was used to analyze the products distribution formed during the via metathesis degradation of natural rubber using βc (Entry 14, Table 2). In Fig. 9 is showed the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, which is dominated by a series of peaks ranging from a mass of 1,151 g/mol to a mass of 1,355 g/mol, corresponding to the macrodiol with bis-hydroxy terminated groups doped with Ag+ ions. The values of monomer repeat units (m) varying from m = 12 to m = 15. The average peak-to-peak distance is in a good agreement with the molar mass of the monomer repeat unit of 68 g/mol. The second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst, a highly active and long-lived Ru–alkylidene catalysts, allowed the well-defined products synthesis such diols and macrodiols from bio-based resources as well as the controlled degradation of polymers. In this regard, their broad tolerance to functional groups made it possible to metathesize high functionalized olefins (alcohols) and the degradation of a polymer with trisubstituted unsaturations (sterically hindered). Furthermore, the process of synthesis of diols and macrodiols would be greener and more sustainable using well-defined supported metathesis catalysts which can be recovered and recycled. In this regard, second generation Hoveyda–Grubbs metathesis catalyst has been successfully immobilized on silica in pellet and onto a broad variety of soluble and insoluble polymers ranging from poly (ethylene glycol), poly (oxa-norbornene) and dendrimers with Si core to a poly (ethylene glycol) dimethylacrylamide copolymer resin (PEGA) and butyl-diethyl silyl poly (styrene) resin [37–39]."
10,Conclusions,"Unsaturated diols with yields between 45 and 92% were synthesized via self-metathesis using fatty alcohols (9de, 10un) and β-citronellol ( βc), in the absence of solvent under mild conditions of reaction. In contrast with the β-pinene and d -limonene, the βc participated in the productive self-metathesis reaction due to that this is an acyclic monoterpene and the steric hindrance factors are avoided and the reaction propagating occurs by a metalcarbene secondary. Besides, macrodiols (hydroxytelechelic compounds) with high yields (>97%) were synthetized in one-pot reaction by cross-metathesis degradation from the NR and the PB, using the unprotected free alcohols (9de, 10un, βc), as CTA's and second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst. The molecular weights of the macrodiols were changed varying the rubber/CTA ratio and were in good agreement with their theoretical values. In this respect, a better control in the molecular weight was obtained in the metathesis degradation reactions of PB than the NR. In the NR, an alkyl group directly linked to the double bond impede the coordination reaction with a metal active center and the activation energies required is higher than polymers in disubstituted unsaturations (such as PB). The obtention of macrodiols with Fn close to 2 was supported by MALDI-TOF analysis. The results suggest that 9de, 10un and βc were effective CTA's on metathesis reactions. Obtaining raw materials through this environmentally friendly route is promising for the synthesis of engineering design polymers, in specific, polyurethanes that widely used in flame retarding and packing application among others."
