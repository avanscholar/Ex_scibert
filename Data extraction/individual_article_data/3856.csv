0,Introduction,"Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) has recently received much attention as a potential alternative to conventional reforming methods for hydrogen production; this is because of the unique physical properties of supercritical water [1,2]. Noncatalytic reforming reactions are possible because of the high reactivity of supercritical water. The low dielectric constant (2–20, depending on the temperature and pressure [3]) and low degree of hydrogen bonding of water in its supercritical state can lead to high solubilities of hydrocarbon feeds. The produced gases are also soluble in supercritical water. Thus, a single-phase reforming reaction can be carried out in supercritical water. The high density, high thermal conductivity, and high heat/mass transfer associated with supercritical water are beneficial in developing a compact reformer system. Over the last ten years, there has been considerable interest in the use of biomass as a renewable energy source. Many studies have demonstrated that supercritical water is an excellent reaction medium for producing hydrogen from biomass and its model compounds [4–8]. In the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts, high hydrogen gas yields, up to the theoretical value, can be achieved. Hydrogen produced from biomass may be used in the future in renewable energy sources. For a seamless transition from a fossil fuel economy to a hydrogen economy, it may be necessary to explore hydrogen production from fossil oil sources. In spite of the advantages of SCWG, only a few studies have focused on hydrogen production from long-chain hydrocarbons (>C6) using SCWG [9–11]. It is more difficult to reform longer-chain hydrocarbons because many competing reactions take place, so, in some cases, catalysts are needed to achieve high hydrogen gas yields [10,11]. In such cases, the catalyst deactivation associated with the sulfur compounds present in fossils fuels [12] and coke/tar formation [2] can cause major problems. Development of a noncatalytic SCWG system that can generate high hydrogen gas yields is therefore highly desirable. Our group has worked on noncatalytic SCWG of isooctane (C8H18) as a model gasoline compound [9,13]. The first work was carried out using a downdraft tubular reactor system, made from Hastelloy® C-276, at temperatures of 593–694 °C, residence times of 8–16 s, concentrations of 15–23 wt%, and a pressure of 25 MPa [13]. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as an oxidant source to enhance the hydrogen gas yield by running partial oxidation in supercritical water. The maximum hydrogen yield achieved using the downdraft reactor configuration was very low: 1.68 mol H2/mol isooctane at 664 °C, 25 MPa, a residence time of 15 s, an isooctane concentration of 22 wt%, and a H2O2 concentration of 1560.2 mmol/L. The experimentally obtained maximum hydrogen gas yield corresponds to only 7% of the theoretical maximum hydrogen gas yield (24.2 mol/mol isooctane). In our second study of noncatalytic SCWG of isooctane, a significant modification of the gasification system was made to enhance the hydrogen gas yield. This included tilting of the gasification reactor to 75° from the vertical position, positioning the reactor inlet at the bottom and the reactor outlet at the top (updraft configuration), and installing an insulation zone and a cooling zone [9]. A higher hydrogen gas yield of 6.13 mol H2/mol isooctane was achieved at 637 °C, 25 MPa, 18 s, an isooctane concentration of 9.9 wt%, and a H2O2 concentration of 2701.1 mmol/L. Under similar gasification conditions, the updraft configuration resulted in a higher hydrogen gas yield, approximately four times higher than that obtained with the downdraft gasification system. The gasification efficiency also increased dramatically. However, the maximum hydrogen yield of 6.13 mol H2/mol isooctane is still low. This value only corresponds to 28% of the theoretical maximum yield of hydrogen (21.9 mol/mol isooctane). Even though previous work suggests that higher hydrogen gas yields can be achieved at higher reaction temperatures and/or longer residence times, it was not possible to explore noncatalytic SCWG further because the temperature was limited to 640 °C, and because the reactor volume was small. In this paper, we demonstrate that a much higher hydrogen gas yield of 12.6 mol H2/mol isooctane can be achieved, in the presence of a small amount of oxidant, using the updraft gasification configuration. This value corresponds to 56% of the theoretical maximum (22.4 mol/mol isooctane), or to 98% of the equilibrium hydrogen gas yield, under given conditions. A new SCWG reactor was developed to enable the investigation to be carried out at higher reaction temperatures and longer residence times. The reactor material was changed from Hastelloy® C-276 to Haynes® 230® alloy, to enable the SCWG to be run at a temperature of 763 °C and a pressure of 25 MPa. In addition, the reactor volume was enlarged 5.7-fold to examine long residence time conditions. The Haynes® 230® alloy retains a higher strength and has a longer lifetime at elevated temperatures and pressures than those achieved by other alloy materials, including Hastelloy® C-276 [14–16]. The use of the Haynes® 230® alloy for SCWG was pioneered by Lee et al. [10,17]. The following sections describe the gasification apparatus and process, and the effects of temperature, feed concentration, residence time, and oxidant concentration on the gas yields, gas compositions, and total content of polar compounds in the liquid effluent. A comparison of the hydrogen gas yields obtained by steam reforming, autothermal reforming, and partial oxidation of isooctane with the yields obtained by noncatalytic SCWG of isooctane will also be presented."
1,Experimental method,
2,Materials and analysis,"2.1 Materials and analysis Details of the materials and analytical tools (gas chromatography (GC) for gas analysis and total organic carbon (TOC) for liquid analysis) were given in our previous work in Ref. [9]. The compositions of liquid products were analyzed using a GC Agilent 6890N (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA)/TOF-MS LECO Pegasus III (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) with high-purity helium (>99.9999%) as the carrier gas. The column was an Ultra-2 (5% phenylmethylsiloxane) of length of 25 m, inner diameter (ID) 0.2 mm, and thickness 0.25 μm. The temperature of the column was first maintained at 100 °C for 1 min, then ramped up to 300 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min, and held at 300 °C for 7 min. The injector port temperature was 280 °C and the injection volume was 2 μL."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure The supercritical water gasification was carried out using a custom-built, continuous-flow tubular reactor system. A schematic diagram of the gasification apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 . The apparatus consists of a tubular reactor (R); a water pre-heater (WP); a feed pre-heater (FP); several heat furnaces, including pre-heater furnaces (PF); a mixing part furnace (MF); a reactor furnace (RF); an insulation part furnace (IF); three high-pressure pumps (P-01, P-02, and P-03); cooling units (CT and C-01); a metal filter (F); a back-pressure regulator (BPR); a gas–liquid separator (S); a container for liquids (L); feed tanks (T-01, T-02, T-03, and T-04); isolation and safety valves (V1, V2, V3, and V4), pressure gauges (P); and thermocouples (T). The details of the gasification apparatus and the gasification procedure were described in our previous work in Ref. [9]. Only modifications of the previous system will be described here. The reactor (R) was tubular and made from Haynes® 230® alloy. The size of the reactor was ID 2 cm and length 54 cm, giving an effective volume of 170 mL. All the cooling work was done by an air-cooled tube (CT) and C-01. The condenser (C-01) was a shell and tube type heat exchanger consisting of seven tubes enclosed in a cylindrical shell. The shell had an outer diameter (OD) of 6 cm, an ID of 3.55 cm, and a length of 24 cm. Each tube had an OD of 0.95 cm and an ID of 0.5 cm. The high-pressure pumps P-01 and P-02 were model HKS-600 digital metering pumps, manufactured by Hanyang Accuracy (Seoul, Korea). P-01 was used to deliver isooctane at a maximum flow rate of 162 mL/h, and P-02 was used to deliver water to replace isooctane feed during heating and cooling of the system. The flow-rate range of the water pump was 60–600 mL/h. Pump P-03 was a model HKS-3000 high-pressure digital metering pump (Hanyang Accuracy) with a maximum flow rate of 3000 mL/h; it was used as the main distilled de-ionized (DDI) water pump. In this paper, total gas yield is defined as the volume (L) of total gaseous products at room temperature (25 °C) and pressure (0.1 MPa) per weight (g) of feed, estimated by real-time volumetric flow-rate measurements and feed concentrations. Carbon gasification efficiency (CE) is defined as the total number of moles of carbon in the produced gases per total number of moles of carbon in the feed. The individual gas yields in the produced gases are defined as the number of moles of each produced gas per mole of isooctane fed to the reactor. The number of moles of each produced gas was estimated by real-time volumetric flow-rate measurements and the gas compositions as determined by GC. The dry gas composition is defined as the mole per cent of each produced gas in the sample. Oxygen (O2), which may be present in the gaseous product when the oxidant effect is explored, and nitrogen (N2), which was used to pressurize the feed tanks T-01 and T-03, were not included in the number of moles of each gas produced by the gasification. The oxygen equivalent ratio (ER) is defined as the amount of oxidant added per oxidant required for complete oxidation. For example, an ER of 1 indicates that the amount of oxidant is equivalent to complete oxidation estimated by stoichiometry calculations. The standard error (SD of the mean) is used to describe statistically the uncertainties in the measurements from four samplings. In the experimental results, the standard errors are shown as error bars."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Chemical reactions,"3.1 Chemical reactions Supercritical water gasification of organic compounds is a very complex process and various chemical reactions can take place. The major chemical reactions can include steam reforming, the water–gas shift reaction, pyrolysis, partial oxidation if an oxidant is present, and methanation. The most important reaction in SCWG is steam reforming. The steam reforming reaction of isooctane is (1) C8H18 + 8H2O ↔ 8CO + 17H2 ∆H 298 K = 1274.47 kJ/mol The large and positive value of the heat of enthalpy indicates that steam reforming of isooctane is highly endothermic. A higher reaction temperature can therefore enhance steam reforming, leading to higher yields of hydrogen gas. Since the steam reforming reaction produces carbon monoxide, and a large amount of water exists under typical SCWG conditions, the water–gas shift reaction can take place. (2) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 ∆H 298 K = −41.15 kJ/mol This is a highly desirable reaction because the forward reaction can increase the hydrogen gas yield. The water–gas shift reaction is exothermic and the forward reaction is thermodynamically favored at temperatures lower than 815 °C [18]. When the steam reforming reaction and the water–gas shift reaction are combined, the overall reaction is (3) C8H18 + 16H2O ↔ 8CO2 + 25H2 ∆H 298 K = 945.27 kJ/mol If all the isooctane is steam reformed, and all the CO generated by steam reforming is consumed by the water–gas shift reaction, the maximum hydrogen gas yield that can theoretically be obtained from isooctane is 25 mol/mol isooctane. Any of the other competing reactions, including pyrolysis, partial oxidation, and methanation, that can occur during SCWG would lead to a decrease in the hydrogen gas yield. The combined reaction for the maximum hydrogen gas yield is highly endothermic, so a high reaction temperature may be favorable in enhancing the hydrogen gas yield. Pyrolysis (or cracking) can take place during the SCWG of isooctane. Complete pyrolysis produces hydrogen and solid compounds such as coke and tar. In the course of pyrolysis, cracked light gaseous compounds such as methane and ethane can be formed. (4) C8H18 ↔ 8C + 9H2 ∆H 298 K = 224.1 kJ/mol (5) C8H18 ↔ C x H y + zH2 Pyrolysis is also endothermic, but the heat of enthalpy is much smaller than that of steam reforming. When an oxidant is used in SCWG, partial oxidation or total oxidation can take place, depending on the amount of oxidant fed into the system. (6) Partial oxidation: C8H18 + 4O2 ↔ 8CO + 9H2 ∆H 298 K = −748.13 kJ/mol (7) Total oxidation: C8H18 + 25/2O2 ↔ 8CO2 + 9H2O∆H298 K = −5100.53 kJ/mol The partial oxidation reaction is desirable because it can generate hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The generated carbon monoxide can react with water, yielding hydrogen by the water–gas shift reaction. In addition, the exothermic oxidation reaction can help to reduce coke or tar formation by rapid internal heating of the reactants and reduce the external energy required for the steam reforming reaction [19,20]. The rapid internal heating by the partial oxidation can often lead to an increase in the gasification reaction. Note that the maximum hydrogen yield that can be produced by the combined partial oxidation and water–gas shift reactions is smaller than that of the combined steam reforming and water–gas shift reactions. In fact, the theoretical hydrogen gas yield in the presence of an oxidant can be calculated as below: (8) C8H18 + xO2 + (16 − 2x)H2O ↔ 8CO2 + (25 − 2x)H2 Thus the higher the amount of oxidant added, the lower the theoretical hydrogen gas yield. For example, the maximum hydrogen yield of isooctane is estimated to be 22.4 at ER 0.1, 19.8 at ER 0.2, and 17.5 at ER 0.3. At large values of ER, the total oxidation can be a dominant reaction pathway, producing the undesirable compounds carbon dioxide and water. Methane can be produced during SCWG by reaction of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or carbon with hydrogen. (9) Methanation of CO: CO + 3H2 ↔ CH4 + H2O∆H 298 K = −206.17 kJ/mol (10) Methanation of CO2: CO2 + 4H2 ↔ CH4 + 2H2O∆H 298 K = −165.01 kJ/mol (11) Methanation of C: C + 2H2 ↔ CH4 ∆H298 K = −74.87 kJ/mol Methanation is undesirable because it consumes hydrogen produced by SCWG and decreases the hydrogen gas yield. Methane formation increases with decreasing temperature or increasing amounts of reactants (H2, CO, CO2, or C). A high reaction temperature is therefore favorable as it avoids methanation. The methanation of CO and CO2 can be catalyzed by ruthenium, iridium, rhodium, nickel, cobalt, osmium, platinum, iron, palladium (group VIII), and molybdenum (group VI), or silver (group I) [21,22]. Supercritical water reactor materials such as Hastelloy® C-276, Inconel®, and Haynes® 230® contain nickel as the major component. It is well known that nickel is a good catalyst for methanation [21] and for steam reforming [23], suggesting that the presence of nickel in the reactor wall can catalyze methanation or steam reforming. Wall effects in SCWG have been studied in Refs. [24,25]."
6,Equilibrium calculation,"3.2 Equilibrium calculation The equilibrium composition of isooctane gasification under supercritical water conditions was calculated using Gibbs free energy minimization and the Peng–Robinson equation of state. The calculation indicates that the formation of solid carbon is not observed and that C2–C4 gases are formed in negligible quantities (10−4–10−10 mol/mol isooctane), so these are not discussed in the results. At feed concentrations of less than 15 wt%, the isooctane is consumed completely. Trace amounts of isooctane are found in the output at feed concentrations of 15–30 wt%. Fig. 2 a shows the effect of temperature on the calculated gas yield at a pressure of 25 MPa and an isooctane concentration of 6.2 wt%. An increase in gasification temperature leads to a large increase in hydrogen formation, a drastic decrease in methane formation, and a slight increase in carbon monoxide formation. The carbon dioxide gas yield increases with increasing temperature, but the increase is not as large as that of hydrogen. At a temperature of 763 °C and an isooctane concentration of 6.2 wt% (the experimental gasification conditions explored in this study), the equilibrium hydrogen gas yield is estimated to be 13.6 mol/mol isooctane. The concentration dependence of the effluent gas yield composition was calculated at a temperature of 763 °C and a pressure of 25 MPa, and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. The change in gas composition is obvious at low feed concentrations. The hydrogen yield decreases dramatically and the methane yield increases slightly as the feed concentration increases from 1 wt% to 15 wt%. The theoretical hydrogen gas yield of 25 mol/mol isooctane can be achieved when a dilute feed concentration of ∼1 wt% isooctane is used at 763 °C and 25 MPa. Fig. 3 shows the effects of oxygen concentration on the equilibrium gas yield at 25 MPa and 6.2 wt% isooctane at various temperatures. It can be seen that as the amount of oxidant increases, the hydrogen and methane gas yields decrease, but the carbon dioxide gas yield increases. The effect of ER on the hydrogen gas yield is more obvious at high temperatures."
7,Effects of residence time,"3.3 Effects of residence time Fig. 4 shows the effects of residence time on the total gas yield, carbon gasification efficiency (CE), total organic carbon (TOC), individual gas yield, and dry gas composition at a temperature of 763 ± 2 °C, a pressure of 25 MPa, and an isooctane concentration of 6.3 ± 0.3 wt%. A reaction temperature of 763 ± 2 °C was the maximum temperature achievable with the current gasification system. The effects of residence time were studied by varying the total flow rate of the feeds that were charged to the reactor. The residence time was estimated from τ = V R ρ R υ 0 ρ 0 where VR is the effective reactor volume (cm3), υ 0 is the volumetric flow-rate of the liquid fed to the reactor (cm3/min), ρ 0 is the density of the liquid feed (g/cm3), and ρR is the density of the fluid at the experimental temperature and pressure (g/cm3). As shown in Fig. 4a, as the residence time increased from 60 s to 106 s, the gas yield increased from 3.1 L/g to 4.2 L/g isooctane. A further increase in residence time to 120 s resulted in a slight decrease in the gas yield to 3.9 L/g. A decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) value from 55 ppm to 17 ppm was observed when the residence time was increased from 60 s to 91 s. The TOC value at longer residence times of 106–120 s showed negligible changes. The carbon gasification efficiency (CE) was in the range 75–80% and did not change much with residence time. It is noteworthy that in this study, higher gas yields, much lower TOC values, and much higher CE values were obtained than in previous gasification studies at shorter residence times (<40 s) and a lower reaction temperature (632 °C) [9]. The total gas yields in the previous work were 1.1–2.9 L/g isooctane, the TOC values were 198–2790 ppm, and the CE values were 26.6–52.5%, depending on the residence time. As shown in Fig. 4d, the liquid was yellowish for a residence time of 60 s, but the liquid effluents were transparent at longer residence times. This agrees well with the changes in the TOC value with residence time. It was shown in our previous work that the liquid product was yellow with a thin layer of dark brown viscous oil on the surface when isooctane was gasified in supercritical water at a lower temperature of 632 °C and shorter residence time of 6 s in Ref. [9]. The liquid effluent produced at the residence time of 6 s in the previous study, which consisted of a translucent water-dispersible product and an oily product on the water surface, was not observed in this study. This indicates that higher temperatures and longer residence times are beneficial for higher isooctane conversion. At least eight compounds were found in the liquid products by GC/TOF-MS analysis, including fluoranthene, 2-phenylnaphthalene, 9H-fluorene, phenanthrene, 1-methylnaphthalene, hydroxybenzene, bicyclo[4,4,0]deca-1,3,5,7,9-pentene and cyclohexylcyclohexane, for both of the yellowish samples at a residence time of 60 s and for the transparent liquid at 91 s. A representative GC/TOF-MS analysis profile of the liquid phase is provided in the Supplementary data. The increased total gas yields and reduced TOC values at longer residence times suggest that isooctane was converted to gaseous products instead of being converting to liquid products. It has been reported by other researchers that longer residence times decreased the concentration of organic acids and 2,5-hexanedione in the liquid product in the gasification of glucose at 650 °C, suggesting conversion of the organic species to gaseous products [26]. From carbon balance analysis, it was estimated that approximately 17–24% of the carbon in isooctane was converted to solid products. In fact, after each reaction, a very small amount of coke was observed in the filter and in the cooling tube. The dependences of the individual gas yields on the residence time are shown in Fig. 4b, and the dry gas compositions (mol%) are shown in Fig. 4c. When the residence time was increased from 60 s to 91 s, a significant increase in hydrogen gas yield, from 7.7 mol/mol isooctane to 12.4 mol/mol isooctane, was observed, and a slight decrease to 11.8 mol/mol isooctane was seen at the longer residence time of 120 s. The higher hydrogen gas yields at longer residence times observed in this study agree well with the results of previous work on the supercritical water gasification of wood sawdust, glucose, aviation fuel, and microalgae in Refs. [5,7,10,27]. The hydrogen gas yield of 12.4 mol/mol isooctane almost reached the value of 13.6 mol/mol isooctane predicted using the equilibrium calculation described in Section 3.2. Note that this hydrogen gas yield of 12.4 mol/mol isooctane is comparable to the yield obtained by steam reforming of isooctane at 900 °C with a molybdenum carbide catalyst (∼12.6 mol/mol isooctane) in Ref. [28]. This value is much higher than the hydrogen gas yield from autothermal reforming (ATR) of isooctane at 800 °C with platinum/doped ceria (∼9.5 mol/mol isooctane) in Ref. [29] and that from partial oxidation (POX) of isooctane at 750 °C with noble metal and base metal/alumina (∼8.4 mol/mol isooctane) in Ref. [30]. Details of the hydrogen gas yield comparison will be given later. The methane gas yield showed the opposite trend to the hydrogen gas yield; the methane gas yield decreased from 2.33 mol/mol isooctane to 1.78 mol/mol isooctane with an increment in residence time from 60 s to 106 s, and increased to 1.93 mol/mol isooctane at the longer residence time of 120 s. The decrease in the hydrogen gas yield and the increase in the methane yield at the longer residence time may indicate that the hydrogen produced was consumed by methanation reactions (Eqs. 9–11). Byrd et al. [31] also reported an increase in methane and a decrease in hydrogen at higher residence times (≥2 s at 700 °C and ≥6 s 800 °C) at 221 bar in the gasification of ethanol in supercritical water. As shown in Fig. 4b, very small amounts of carbon monoxide and ethane were produced. The carbon monoxide gas yield was in the range 0.19–0.29 mol/mol isooctane and the ethane gas yield was in the range 0.17–0.23 mol/mol isooctane. The gas composition analysis (Fig. 4c) showed that the amount of hydrogen in the produced gas increased with increasing residence time. At 106 s, the composition of the produced gases was H2 (68.0%), CO (1.3%), CO2 (20.0%), CH4 (9.8%), and C2H6 (0.9%). In contrast to the previous results at shorter residence times (6–33 s) and a lower temperature (632 °C) in Ref. [9], hydrocarbon gas products with a carbon number higher than C2 (e.g., propane, propylene, butane, butylenes) were not detected in this work. This clearly indicates that the current gasification system and the reaction conditions were favorable for cracking of longer-chain hydrocarbons to shorter-chain species. The cracking reaction is an endothermic process (Eqs. 4 and 5), so higher reaction temperatures can enhance cracking. The longer residence time can lead to better conversion to hydrogen. In fact, the hydrogen composition of 68.0% is much higher than the maximum hydrogen composition (56.5%) observed in our previous work in Ref. [9]. Note that the carbon monoxide concentration in the gaseous products was extremely low, in the range 87–107 ppm. These values are comparable to the allowable carbon monoxide concentration for proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications (in the range 10–100 ppm) in Ref. [32]. The water–gas shift reaction under supercritical water conditions, i.e. formation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide with the consumption of carbon monoxide (Eq. (2)), may be responsible for the low carbon monoxide content. The kinetics of the noncatalytic water–gas shift reaction under supercritical conditions has been reported by other researchers in Refs. [33–35]."
8,Effects of feed concentration,"3.4 Effects of feed concentration Fig. 5 shows the effects of isooctane concentration on the total gas yield, CE, TOC, individual gas yields, and dry gas composition at a pressure of 25 MPa, a temperature of 764 ± 1 °C and a residence time of 106 s. When the concentration was increased from 6.3 wt% to 14.7 wt%, the total gas yield decreased from 4.2 L/g to 2.8 L/g, CE decreased from 75.1% to 65.5%, and TOC increased from 17 ppm to 38.5 ppm. Similar trends were observed in the supercritical water gasification of wood sawdust [36]. The lower total gas yield and the higher TOC value at higher concentrations are caused by a shortage of water as a reactant. Compared to previous results at a lower temperature of 630 °C, a shorter residence time of 18 s in Ref. [9], and the same feed concentration (10 wt%), the carbon efficiency increased by ∼74% and the TOC values were two to three orders of magnitude smaller. As shown in Fig. 5b, the hydrogen gas yield decreased from 12.4 mol/mol isooctane to 8.6 mol/mol isooctane, the carbon dioxide gas yield decreased from 3.65 mol/mol isooctane to 2.32 mol/mol isooctane, and the methane gas yield increased from 1.78 mol/mol isooctane to 2.34 mol/mol isooctane when the feed concentration was increased from 6.3 wt% to 14.7 wt%. The dry gas composition in Fig. 5c clearly shows that methane formation was suppressed at high water/isooctane ratios. This is because the excess water will shift the equilibrium of the methanation reaction (Eqs. 9 and 10) to the left. The amount of CO increased from 1.3% to 1.75% and that of C2H6 increased from 0.93% to 1.22% as the isooctane concentration increased from 6.3 wt% to 14.7 wt%. Compared to our previous work in Ref. [9], the formation of hydrocarbon species > C2 and formation of CO were greatly suppressed at higher temperatures and longer residence times, using the same concentration of isooctane."
9,Effects of oxidant,"3.5 Effects of oxidant Partial oxidation in supercritical water gasification has typically been carried out to enhance the total gas and hydrogen gas yields [10,20,37,38]. We performed a set of experiments to investigate the oxidant role in the hydrogen gas yield, using the current supercritical water gasification system. Fig. 6 shows the effects of hydrogen peroxide on the total gas yield, CE, TOC, individual gas yield, and dry gas composition when the oxygen equivalent ratio (ER) increased from 0 to 0.3 at 25 MPa, 764 ± 1 °C, a residence time of 105 ± 1 s, and an isooctane concentration of 6.2 ± 0.1 wt%. In sharp contrast to previous results in Refs. [9,13], the total gas yield did not increase on addition of hydrogen peroxide. In fact, the total gas yield decreased from 4.22 L/g to 3.73 L/g when the ER increased from 0 to 0.3, indicating that with the current gasification system and experimental conditions, partial oxidation did not encourage gas production. The decrease in the gas yield at higher ER values is due to the decrease in hydrogen gas production. Since hydrogen is the major gas in the gaseous products (58–68%, see Fig. 6c), a decrease in hydrogen gas yield led to a decrease in the total gas yield. The dependence of CE on ER showed a different trend. As shown in Fig. 6a, when the ER increased from 0 to 0.3, the CE increased significantly from 75.1% to 90.6%. Thus, at the high ER of 0.3, only ∼8.5% of the carbon in isooctane is converted to a solid product and ∼0.9% of the carbon is converted to a liquid product. The increase in CE with increasing ER may occur because the oxidant helps to enhance the rate of the gasification reaction [20], resulting in an increased conversion of isooctane to gaseous products. Since the oxidation reaction enhanced the production of carbon dioxide, which is the second major compound in the gaseous products (see Fig. 6b and c), the CE increased as the ER increased. The TOC value increased from 14 ppm to 24 ppm as the ER increased from 0 to 0.3. Oxidation reactions of solid product such as tar/coke may be responsible for the increase in TOC value at higher ER. A similar trend was also previously observed in the supercritical water oxidation of dog food, used as a model municipal solid waste in Ref. [39], and supercritical water oxidation of municipal excess sludge and alcohol distillery waste water in Ref. [40]. As shown in Fig. 6b, the hydrogen gas yield increased slightly from 12.4 mol/mol isooctane to 12.6 mol/mol isooctane as the ER increased from 0 to 0.1. A further increase in ER to 0.3 resulted in a decrease in the hydrogen gas yield to 10.1 mol/mol isooctane. This clearly indicates that partial oxidation did not play an important role in enhancing hydrogen production when the reaction temperature was high (764 ± 1 °C) and the residence time was long (105 ± 1 s). In our previous papers, we showed that the hydrogen gas yield could be increased to the maximum value by increasing the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the SCWG of isooctane in Refs. [9,13]. For example, the hydrogen gas yield increased from 4.0 mol/mol isooctane to 6.13 mol/mol isooctane (an increase of ∼38%) at 637 °C, 25 MPa, and a residence time of 18 s, with addition of 2701.1 mmol/L of H2O2 (or ER = 0.12) as the oxidant in Ref. [9]. Other groups have observed similar trends. Picou et al. [10] reported that the hydrogen gas yield increased to 26% as the O2/fuel ratio increased from 0 to 5 at 767 ± 1 °C, 24.1 ± 0.1 MPa, and a space time of 38 ± 1 s in the SCWG of aviation fuel. Jin et al. [20] reported a 26% increase in hydrogen gas yield as the ER increased from 0 to 0.1 in the SCWG of lignin at 600 °C, 25 MPa, and a feedstock flow rate of 25 g/min. Williams et al. [38] reported an increase in hydrogen gas yield from 0.4 wt% to 1.26 wt% at 380 °C and from 0.2 wt% to 1.27 wt% at 374 °C as the H2O2 concentration increased from 0 wt% to 4.5 wt%. Further oxidant increases resulted in decreases in the hydrogen gas yield. At least two possible reasons may be responsible for the enhancements of the hydrogen gas yield as a result of adding oxidants seen in the previous studies. Low reaction temperatures (<600 °C) and/or short residence times often result in incomplete gasification, leading to formation of unreacted hydrocarbon species with carbon numbers higher than two (>C2). In this case, partial oxidation can enhance the total gasification rate by rapid heating of the >C2 species, which can contribute to an increase in the hydrogen gas yield in Refs. [20,38]. When the reaction temperature is sufficiently high, partial oxidation can compete with pyrolysis (Eq. 4–6) and/or can oxidize the coke produced by pyrolysis. Partial oxidation would therefore produce more hydrogen and fewer hydrocarbons [10]. The decrease in the hydrogen gas yield obtained by adding large amounts of oxidants can be attributed to more complete oxidation to form carbon dioxide and water (Eq. (7)). Based on the previous observations, the decrease in the hydrogen gas yield obtained by addition of oxidant in the current system may imply that there may be competition between steam reforming (Eq. (1)) and partial oxidation (Eq. (6)). As discussed in the previous section, the theoretical hydrogen yield of steam reforming is higher than that of partial oxidation. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, the calculated hydrogen gas yield decreases with increasing ER. Thus, when steam reforming is dominant at a sufficiently high reaction temperature and/or with a sufficiently long residence time, partial oxidation may suppress the hydrogen gas yield. A similar trend was observed in the SCWG of aviation fuel in Ref. [10]. When the O2/fuel ratio was increased, the hydrogen gas yield increased at shorter residence times (38 ± 1 s and 75 ± 2 s), but the hydrogen gas yield decreased at a longer residence time of 151 ± 5 s at 767 ± 1 °C, 24.1 ± 0.1 MPa, and an aviation fuel concentration of 6.25 wt%. It may therefore be unnecessary to use partial oxidation reactions to enhance hydrogen gas yields when high temperatures, long residence times, and low feedstock concentrations are used. However, note that partial oxidation can reduce the energy required for the gasification reaction and can reduce coke/tar formation. The energy balance and reactor plugging by coke/tar should therefore be taken into account in determining the optimal amount of oxidant in SCWG. The maximum hydrogen gas yield obtained in our study was ∼12.6 mol/mol isooctane, which is ∼56% of the theoretical maximum and 98% of the equilibrium hydrogen gas yield for an ER of 0.1. The maximum hydrogen gas yields obtained by noncatalytic SCWG using various feedstocks are compared in Table 1 . When methanol was used as a low carbon number feedstock, 85% of the theoretical maximum hydrogen gas yield was achieved at 700 °C. When medium carbon number species (C2–C6) such as ethanol, glycerol, and glucose were used, 11–73% of the theoretical maximums were obtained at temperatures of 500–740 °C. Much lower hydrogen gas yields, 0.16–14.8% of the theoretical maximums, were observed with higher carbon number feedstocks (C10–C12) at temperatures of 550–767 °C. The yield obtained in this study, >50% of the theoretical maximum hydrogen yield, was therefore very high compared to the yields obtained in previous studies with high carbon number feedstocks. As shown in Fig. 6b, the methane gas yield decreased from 1.78 mol/mol isooctane to 1.49 mol/mol isooctane, and the ethane gas yield decreased from 0.17 mol/mol isooctane to 0.08 mol/mol isooctane, but the carbon dioxide gas yield increased from 3.65 mol/mol isooctane to 5.2 mol/mol isooctane, when the ER increased from 0 to 0.3. This may be because the pyrolysis products (methane and ethane) react with oxygen, producing carbon dioxide via the total oxidation reaction (Eq. (7)). The oxidant can react with solid products (tar and char), producing carbon dioxide via C + O2 → CO2. The compositions of the produced gases are illustrated in Fig. 6c. The amount of hydrogen in the gaseous products decreased from 68.0% to 58.4%, carbon dioxide increased from 20.0% to 30.0%, methane decreased from 9.8% to 8.6%, carbon monoxide increased from 1.3% to 2.5%, and ethane decreased from 0.9% to 0.5% when the ER was increased from 0 to 3. This gas yield trend with changing ER is similar to that predicted by the equilibrium calculation in Fig. 3."
10,Comparison with other reforming methods,"3.6 Comparison with other reforming methods Steam reforming (SR), autothermal reforming (ATR), and partial oxidation (POX) methods have been used to reform isooctane to hydrogen in Refs. [28–30]. Each method has different theoretical hydrogen gas yields. The addition of oxygen in ATR or POX can drive the endothermic reforming reaction; this is beneficial in lowering the reforming energy consumption. In contrast, the presence of oxygen decreases the theoretical hydrogen gas yield that can be achieved by isooctane reforming. The SR reaction and the ATR reaction, assuming all carbon monoxide is converted to hydrogen by the water–gas shift reaction, and the POX reaction can be described as shown below. Combination of SR and WGS reactions: (12) C8H18 + 16H2O → 8CO2 + 25H2 ATR reaction: (13) C n H m O p + x(O2 + 3.7N2) + (2n − 2x − p)H2O → nCO2 + [2n − 2x – p + (1/2m)]H2 + 3.7xN2 POX reaction: (14) C8H18 + 4O2 → 8CO + 9H2 A comparison of the hydrogen gas yields from isooctane reforming using the various reforming methods are given in Table 2 . SR or SCWG give the highest theoretical hydrogen gas yields, a value of 25 mol H2/mol isooctane. The theoretical hydrogen gas yield using ATR is dependent on the amount of oxygen used. The lower the amount of oxygen used, the higher the theoretical hydrogen gas yield that can be achieved. The hydrogen gas yield by SR was ∼17 mol/mol isooctane at a very high temperature (1000 °C) in the presence of a molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) catalyst. ATR achieved a yield of up to ∼9.5 mol/mol isooctane at 800 °C using a platinum/doped ceria catalyst. POX gave a relatively lower hydrogen gas yield of ∼8.4 mol/mol isooctane in the presence of noble metal and base metal/alumina catalysts. Therefore, compared to the other reforming methods, our noncatalytic SCWG system resulted in a relatively higher hydrogen gas yield of 12.4 mol H2/mol isooctane at a much lower temperature (764.7 °C). Note that the typical residence time of a catalytic reformer in operation is very small. For example, the residence time of a reactor of volume 170 mL, operating at a gas hourly space velocity of 15 000 h−1, is 0.24 s."
11,Conclusion,"Continuous noncatalytic supercritical water gasification of isooctane was investigated using an updraft configuration and a 170-mL gasification reactor, with Haynes® 230® alloy as the reactor material, to run gasification at a high temperature of 763 ± 2 °C. The hydrogen gas yield increased with increasing residence time and decreasing feed concentration. At a residence time of 106 s and an isooctane concentration of 6.3 wt%, a very high hydrogen gas yield of 12.4 mol/mol isooctane, which corresponds to 50% of the theoretical maximum hydrogen gas yield and 92% of the equilibrium hydrogen gas yield, was achieved without using oxidants. Under these conditions, the gas yield was 4.2 L/g isooctane, the carbon gasification efficiency was 75.1%, and the TOC value of the liquid effluent was 17 ppm. The produced gas consisted of hydrogen (68.0 mol%), carbon dioxide (20.0 mol%), methane (9.8 mol%), carbon monoxide (1.3 mol%), and ethane (0.9 mol%). Gaseous products with carbon numbers higher than three (>C3) were not produced. As the oxidant concentration increased, methane/ethane decreased and carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide increased, as a result of oxidation reactions. The carbon gasification efficiency increased to 91% at the higher oxidant concentration of ER = 0.3. The noncatalytic SCWG of isooctane achieved higher hydrogen gas yields at lower gasification temperatures than the yield obtained by steam reforming, autothermal reforming, and partial oxidation methods."
