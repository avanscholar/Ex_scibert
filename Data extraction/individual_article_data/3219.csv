0,Introduction,"The design of chiral ligands plays a key role in the development of asymmetric catalytic reactions. To date, a large number of chiral ligands have been prepared and their application for asymmetric reactions has been investigated. Among of them, chiral P x N y -type ligands possessing a combination of hard and soft donor atoms have attracted considerable attention [1–5]. The advantage of this combination is to stabilize metal center and provide unique chiral coordination environments during a catalytic reaction. Although many encouraging advances had been achieved in the design and synthesis of chiral ligands, it is still an attractive goal to develop more new chiral ligands with both high activity as well as excellent enantioselectivity for different kinds of asymmetric catalytic reactions. The enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones catalyzed by transition metal complexes is a powerful method to obtain optically active alcohols, which are important intermediates in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fragrances industries. Especially, the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of ketones, which used a hydrogen donor rather than hydrogen gas, has become an efficient and practical method due to its operational simplicity and versatility [6–17]. For these years, we have devoted ourselves to the development of novel chiral P x N y -type ligands, including bidentate, tridentate, tetradentate, multidentate, and macrocycle aminophosphine ligands, further studied their application in asymmetric catalysis [18–28]. As continuation of our study, herein we firstly reported the synthesis of novel chiral P3N4-type multidentate ligands, which displayed highly catalytic activity and enantioselectivity for the ATH of various aromatic ketones under mild conditions."
1,Experimental,"All reactions were carried out under a N2 atmosphere using Schlenk glassware. Solvents were dried according to standard procedures. Chiral ligand (R,R,R,R)-1 was prepared as our previous procedure [26]. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV 400 spectrometer with TMS as the internal standard. Melting point was measured in sealed tubes and was not corrected. Mass spectra were obtained on Bruker En Apex ultra 7.0T FT-MS. Optical rotation values were measured on Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. The yield and ee values were determined by a GC-950 instrument with an FID detector and a CP-Chiralsil-Dex CB column. The NMR spectra and HRMS spectra of chiral multidentate ligand (R,R,R,R)-3 and GC traces of ATH products are given in the Supporting information.

2,Synthesis of chiral multidentate P3N4-type ligand,"2.1 Synthesis of chiral multidentate P3N4-type ligand Chiral multidentate P3N4-type ligand (R,R,R,R)-3 was synthesized as Scheme 1 . A mixture of o-(diphenylphosphine)benzaldehyde (0.61g, 2.1mmol), (R,R,R,R)-1 (0.5g, 0.97mmol) and anhydrous Na2SO4 (5.0g) in CH2Cl2 (50mL) was stirred at room temperature for 2 days. The resulting yellow solution was filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a pale yellow solid (R,R,R,R)-2 (1.0g, 97% yield). A solution of (R,R,R,R)-2 (1.0g, 0.94mmol) and NaBH4 (2.5g, 66.0mmol) in absolute ethanol (120mL) was refluxed with stirring for 42h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and H2O (30mL) was added to decompose excess NaBH4. The mixture solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 (50mL). Then, the combined extracts were washed with saturated NH4Cl solution, H2O and saturated brine solution, successively. The organic layers were combined and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford (R,R,R,R)-3 as a white solid in 90% yield (0.9g). Mp 113–116°C. 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.74 (d, 4H, J =8.7Hz), 1.00 (d, 4H, J =29.8Hz), 1.48 (s, 4H), 1.85 (m, 8H), 2.01 (s, 4H), 3.63–3.82 (m, 4H), 3.83–4.00 (m, 4H), 6.61–6.80 (m, 4H), 6.93–7.32 (m, 31H), 7.49 (ddd, 6H, J =28.2, 14.1, 7.0Hz); 13C NMR (100MHz, CDCl3): δ 24.86, 31.02, 48.82, 60.47, 60.85 (d, J =6.13Hz), 62.81, 63.05, 127.36, 128.68, 129.15 (d, J =7.01Hz), 132.28 (d, J =26.97Hz), 133.57, 134.22, 135.01, 135.63, 136.21 (d, J =9.48Hz), 136.71 (dd, J =4.03, 10.23Hz), 144.40, 144.64, 145.43, 145.66; 31P NMR (162MHz, CDCl3): δ −15.84, −15.86, −25.81.

3,Typical procedure for ATH,"2.2 Typical procedure for ATH Under nitrogen atmosphere, the catalyst precursor IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 (3.9mg, 0.005mmol) and (R,R,R,R)-3 (5.3mg, 0.005mmol) were placed in a tube equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. i-PrOH was then added and the mixture was stirred at 40°C for 20min. An appropriate amount of KOH/i-PrOH solution was then added, and the mixture was continually stirred for another 20min. Next, ketone (0.5mmol) was introduced and the mixture was stirred at 40°C for the required reaction time. At the end of the reaction, the product was analyzed by GC using a chiral CP-Chirasil-Dex CB column."
4,Results and discussion,"The condensation of chiral aminophosphine ligand (R,R,R,R)-1 and o-(diphenylphosphine)benzaldehyde proceeded in CH2Cl2 for 48h, obtaining a pale yellow solid (R,R,R,R)-2 in 97% yield. Reduction of (R,R,R,R)-2 with excess NaBH4 was carried out in refluxing ethanol, giving the corresponding P3N4-type amine ligand (R,R,R,R)-3 as a white solid in 90% yield, which features the HRMS signals at 1063.5117 (M+H). The 31P NMR spectrum of (R,R,R,R)-3 in CDCl3 solution exhibited three singlets at δ −15.84 ( PPh2), −15.86 ( PPh2), and −25.81 ( PPh). Compound (R,R,R,R)-3 contains four chiral carbon atoms and seven possible coordination sites, which is hopeful to exhibit unique performance in both coordination chemistry and asymmetric catalysis. Next, we are interested in the asymmetric catalytic behavior of this novel chiral multidentate ligand (R,R,R,R)-3. Using i-PrOH as hydrogen donor, we examined the ATH of propiophenone catalyzed by combining (R,R,R,R)-3 with various iridium compounds (Table 1 ). It can be seen that the ATH of propiophenone proceeded smoothly to yield (S)-1-phenylpropanol under mild conditions. Notably, the catalyst system generated in situ from IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 and (R,R,R,R)-3 gave 92% yield with 93% ee in just half an hour at 40°C (Table 1, entry 5), surpassing those previously reported chiral PN4-type ligand (R,R,R,R)-1 [26]. Furthermore, we performed the reaction at lower catalyst loading (0.02mol%), obtaining 61% yield with 90% ee (Table 1, entry 6). These results showed that the chiral multidentate ligand (R,R,R,R)-3 is highly effective for Ir-catalyzed enantioselective reduction of propiophenone. As we reported previously, adding an appropriate base is important for the reaction of ATH in terms of both reactivity and enantioselectivity [18]. Therefore, we examined the effect of the amount of KOH on ATH of propiophenone with IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2/(R,R,R,R)-3. It showed that no reaction carried out if the base was absent or at low concentration. As the base concentration was increased, both the reaction rate and ee increased greatly. However, excess base decreased slightly the enantioselectivity although the conversion increased (For more details, see the Supporting information).

However, excess base decreased slightly the enantioselectivity although the conversion increased (For more details, see the Supporting information). With the optimized conditions in hand, we further investigated the ATH of a broad scope of aromatic ketones using the catalytic system formed in situ from of IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 and chiral ligand (R,R,R,R)-3 (Table 2 ). For the ATH of acetophenone, the catalyst exhibited high activity and good enantioselectivity (98% yield, 81% ee, Table 2, entry 1). To our delight, the ATH of various α-substituted aromatic ketones proceeded smoothly, affording the corresponding chiral alcohols with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee, Table 2, entries 2–6). When aryl methyl ketones were used as substrates, high yields and ee were obtained (Table 2, entries 7–12). An exception is found in the ATH of 2-methylacetophenone, which gave low activity (10h, 87% yield, Table 2, entry 8). This result hints that the steric hindrance of substituent on the phenyl ring may hamper the reaction. Interestingly, more hindered ketone, 1,1′-diphenylpropan-2-one, could be reduced with high yield as well as excellent enantioselectivity (99% ee, Table 2, entry 12)."
5,Conclusion,"In summary, we demonstrated novel chiral multidentate P3N4-type ligand (R,R,R,R)-3, which displayed highly catalytic activity and enantioselectivity for the ATH of aromatic ketones under mild conditions. Using i-PrOH as hydrogen source, various aromatic ketones could be enantioselectively reduced by IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2/(R,R,R,R)-3 to the corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 99% ee. Compared with the chiral P x N y -type ligands traditionally used in the ATH reactions, this novel ligand is multidentate aminophosphine ligand. This unique structure would afford more coordination sites, which maybe result in excellent catalytic performance in asymmetric reaction. Considering its highly catalytic activity and enantioselectivity, the chiral multidentate ligand represents an interesting direction for design and synthesis of novel chiral ligands. Further study of these chiral aminophosphine ligands is in progress to develop more efficient chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis."
