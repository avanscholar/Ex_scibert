0,Introduction,"Some small gas molecules [such as nitric oxide (NO), hydrogren sulfide (H2S) and methane (CH4)] in plants, are involved in a range of physiological and developmental procedures, such as adventitious rooting, horticultural production freshness, stomatal movement, seed germination, and endogenous ethylene biosynthesis. Some gas molecules also play crucial roles in plant response to various abiotic stresses, including salinity, drought, heat stress and metal stress (Wang and Liao, 2016). Some gasotransmitters have been suggest to increase vase life and maintain postharvest quality in cut flowers. For example, a NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) delayed the senescence of cut carnations by supressing the synthesis of ethylene and enhancing the antioxidant ability (Naing et al., 2017). H2S positivly regulated the senescence of cut roses and chrysanthemums by maintaining water balance and improving nutrient and anthocyanin content (Wei et al., 2021). By re-establishing redox balance, CH4 alleviated the postharvest deterioration and tissue browning of daylily buds (Hu et al., 2018). Other gasotransmitters such as carbon monoxide (CO) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) served as fungicides during the postharvest freshness of horticultural products (Kader et al., 1982; Macnish et al., 2008). Previous study has shown that hydrogen gas (H2) might participate in signal transduction pathways of plant hormones and improve plant resistance to various abiotic stresses, including drought, cold, salt stress and heavy metals (Li et al., 2018). The effects of H2 on postharvest preservation ability have been investigated extensively. Owing to the antioxidant properties of H2 or H2 mixtures with other gases may contribute to the preservation of agricultural products. Both NO and H2 may increase the vase life of cut flowers (Li et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2019). Our previous study observed that treatment with a suitable concentration of HRW increased the postharvest life and maximum flower diameter in cut lily ‘Manissa’ and cut roses ‘Kardinal’ (Ren et al., 2017). Our previous results also found that H2 alleviated postharvest senescence of cut roses by suppressing ethylene biosynthesis (Wang et al., 2019). Due to the security of hydrogen, no poison, no residue, it has a strong advantage of food safety compared with other chemical treatment of fresh agricultural products. Thus, H2 as a crucial gasotransmitters has drawn great attention because of it roles in the postharvest senescence of cut flowers. Medical research suggests that HRW ameliorated clinical features of gut microbiota disturbances, such as diarrhea rate, weight, and fluid loss. HRW might be an up-and-coming compound that might tune endogenous H2 homeostasis and modulate gut microbiota. A recent human trial confirmed the beneficial effects of HRW consumption on gut microbiota (Sha et al., 2018). HRW maintained favorable microbial balance by leading to higher abundance and diversity of gut flora(Valdes et al., 2018). Althouth the medical roles of H2 as a regulators of gut microbiota have been widely reported, research into the effects of H2 on the bacterial community of cut roses has often been of lesser concern. Modern roses (Rosa hybrida L.), as an economically important cut flower, is one of the most favorite cut flowers. After being cut from maternal plants, cut flowers begin to loss water and energy gradually, causing petals wither or even abscission, and then terminate the vase life eventually (Gong et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018). Thus, it is a very significant strategy to obtain higher ornamental value and commercial benefit by delaying the postharvest senescence of fresh cut flowers. Preservation technology plays an important roles in the preservation of the postharvest quality of horticultural products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to apply new techniques to improve the postharvest quality of cut flowers. Previous studies found that there was a direct or indirect relationship between the wilting of cut flower and the bacteria in the xylem vessels (Van Doorn and Reid, 1995; Liu et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012, 2017). The accumulation of bacteria in the xylem vessels shortened the vase life of cut gladiolus ‘Eerde’ spikes (Li et al., 2017). High concentrations of bacteria affected the vase life of cut Boronia heterophylla F. Muell. (Red Boronia) and Acacia holosericea (Ratnayake et al., 2012; Williamson and Joyce, 2013). However, beneficial bacteria have multiple characteristics, such as slowing down yellowing of cut flower leaves, delaying senescence, reducing ethylene activity, and improving the formation and quality of high-quality flowers (Hunter et al., 2004). The influence of the bacteria depends on their types and locations. In recent years, two biological control bacteria Pseudomonas fulva and Escherichia coli increased the vase life of cut Zinnia elegans L. ‘Benary’s Giant Wine’ (Carlson et al., 2015). Enterobacter cloacae exhibited a positive effect on the vase life of cut carnations (Xie et al., 2014). The plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) Burkholderia phytofirmans (PsJN), Caulobacter sp. (FA-13), Enterobacter sp. (MN-17) and Bacillus sp. (MN-54) increased the water absorption rate and increased the maximum flower diameter of tulips, thereby extending the vase life and increasing the ornamental quality (Bashir et al., 2019). Therefore, PGPB does not only increase plant growth and development, but also has a certain effect on the preservation of cut flowers. In medical research, higher abundance and diversity of gut flora, an indicator of favorable microbial balance, were induced by H2 (Valdes et al., 2018). Our previous results have shown that H2 could improve the vase life and maintain the ornamental quality of cut roses (Ren et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). However, the specific mechanisms of H2-regulated the bacterial community in the stem ends of cut flowers during fresh preservation are still unknown. In this experiment, physiological approaches and high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis were used to investigate the effects of H2 on the bacterial community on the stem-end cut surface and in the xylem vessels of cut roses (R. hybrida L. ‘Movie star’). Thus, the study was designed to explore whether HRW could extend the vase life and postharvest quality of cut roses by regulating bacteria community."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Plant material,"2.1 Plant material Cut rose (Movie Star) flowers were purchased from a wholesale cut flower farm in Lanzhou city, China. The flower stems were covered with a plastic film shroud to minimize moisture loss during transportation. In the laboratory, the cut flower stems were placed in distilled water and re-cut to achieve a length of about 35 cm. The upper three leaves were retained on each stem. The stem base was inserted into distilled water for 2 h and then the surface was disinfected with alcohol. The flowers with identical size, color and no mechanical damage were selected and labeled for different treatments. The experimental environment was kept at 20 °C, 60 ± 5 % relative humidity and 15 mol m−2 •s-1 photons irradiance in 16/8 h (light/dark) cycles."
3,Preparation of hydrogen-rich water and treatments,"2.2 Preparation of hydrogen-rich water and treatments Hydrogen-rich water (HRW, as a H2 donor) was used as hydrogen treatment. Purified H2 gas (99.99 %, v/v) was produced from H2-producing apparatus (QL-300, Saikesaisi Hydrogen Energy Co., Ltd., China) and bubbled into 1 L distilled water (20 °C) at a rate of 5 mL·s−1 for 30 min to make up the HRW solution with saturated HRW. The concentration of H2 in freshly prepared HRW was 0.47 mM, which was analyzed by a dissolved hydrogen portable meter (Trustlex Co., Led, ENH-1000, Japan). The H2 content of HRW could maintain for at least 12 h at 20 °C at a relatively constant level (Zhu et al., 2016). The solution above was defined as 100 % HRW. The 100 % HRW was immediately diluted to required concentration (0.5 %, 1 %, 25 % and 50 %, [v/v]). The distilled water was used as control treatment. In each experiment, 6 cut rose stems were held in bottle, and flowering stems were arranged using a completely randomized selected. The bottle placed in a ventilated place without direct sunlight. The test solutions were replaced with freshly made solutions for every day."
4,"Evaluation of vase life, flower diameter and rate of fresh weight changes","2.3 Evaluation of vase life, flower diameter and rate of fresh weight changes The vase life of each flower was determined by the number of days from the day that the flowers were placed in the test solutions until flowers had no decorative value. The definition of no decorative value is that the petals appear to be wilting, the flowers are bent, and the flowers and leaves are browned and fall off. The vase life of the bottle is the average of 18 flowers. The flower diameter was defined as the maximum width of each flower and measured by vernier caliper twice. The fresh weight of cut flower stems were measured immediately after cutting and before placing the stems in the test solution. The fresh weight of each flower was recorded at 1-day intervals at a fixed time, and the change in fresh weight of each stem was calculated as: Rate of fresh weight changes (%) = [(W t − W 0) /W 0] ×100 Where W t is the weight of the stem at t = day 1, 2, 3 and so on; and W 0 is the weight of the stem at t = day 0. The mean values of maximum flower diameter and rate of fresh weight changes in each treatment were calculated by six flowers in each replication. Experiments were repeated at least three times."
5,"Measurement of water uptake, water loss and water balance","2.4 Measurement of water uptake, water loss and water balance The method was calculated according to Lü et al. (2010). The water content of cut roses was recorded in 2-day intervals. At each time point, three replicates were performed. Water uptake (g stem−1 2d−1) = (St-1 - St)W here St is the weight of the vase solution and vase (g) at t = day 1, 2, 3, etc.; St-1 is the weight of the vase solution and vase (g) on the previous day. Water loss (g stem−1 2d−1) = (Ct-1 - Ct)W here Ct is the combined weights of the cut stem and vase (g) at t = day 1, 2, 3, etc.; Ct-1 is the combined weights of the stem, and vase (g) on the previous day. Water balance (g stem−1 2d−1) = water uptake - water loss"
6,Anatomical observations of the stem ends,"2.5 Anatomical observations of the stem ends 2.5.1 Optical microscope Stem segments of cut rose (0.5 mm long) were cut from the base of each stem using sterilizing blade and dyed with diluted red ink on day 2, 4 and 6 of vase period. The internal tissues of stem ends were observed and photographed by BX61 Optical microscope (Olympus, Japan) in a field of 40 * 10. 2.5.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The development of bacteria blocking in the xylem vessels of cut-stems was observed by SEM. Stem segments (1∼2 mm long) were cut from the base of each stem using sterilizing blade on day 0, 2, 4 and 6 of vase period. The stem segment samples were immediately fixed in FAA. Dehydration of the samples was in a graded ethanol series. Explants were dried by CO2 critical point drying and coated with gold. Samples were observed and photographed by S-3400 N SEM (Hitachi, Japan). 2.5.3 Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) The development of bacteria and biofilm in the xylem vessels of the cut-stems was observed by CLSM. Samples were obtained on day 0, 2, 4, and 6 of the vase periods. Freehand longitudinal and transverse sections (0.1 to 0.3 mm thick) of the stem-ends were transferred onto microscope slides. 0.025 μg L−1 concanavalin A-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (ConA488, Life Technologies Corporation, USA) and 10 μmol L-1 SytoX Green (Life Technologies Corporation, USA) was mixed in 1:1 and added onto each section. After staining for 30 min in the dark, the phosphate buffer washes away excess dye on the surface of the sample. Put it in a glass slide, seal it with a cover slide, samples were observed and photographed by LSM800 CLSM (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Hamburg Germany)."
7,"Bacteria isolation, DNA extraction and sequencing of the stem ends","2.6 Bacteria isolation, DNA extraction and sequencing of the stem ends After 6 d, the stem ends were stirred in sterilizing distilled water and transferred into sterile tubes (1 mL). The tubes were vortex-mixed for 5 min and then an aliquot (0.1 mL) serially diluted with sterilizing distilled. Water samples were plated on nutrient agar and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The colonies were visually inspected and some single colonies were selected by differences in colony characteristics such as, color, shape, size, and texture and plated on nutrient agar. Pure colonies were obtained and identified using the gram staining, cell morphology was characterized morphologically was based on Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology. Genomic DNA was extracted from the stem-end cut surface using the Genomic DNA Mini Preparation Kit (OMEGA). The DNA samples were sent to Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. for Miseq library construction and Illumina Miseq sequencing for bacterial identification. The V3–V4 region gene sequences from isolated genomic DNA samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primer sequences were used bacterial universal primers 341 F (CCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTG (barcode) CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 805R (GACTGGAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCAGACTACHVGGGTA TCTAATCC). Molecular identification of bacteria was based on 16SrDNA gene sequences of the isolated bacteria. We estimated the relative abundance and the composition of bacterial communities."
8,Individual bacteria inoculations and treatments,"2.7 Individual bacteria inoculations and treatments 2.7.1 Preparation of the bacterial strains The bacterial strains, Pseudomonas fluorescens (No. 231887) and Brevundimonas diminuta (No. 138603) used in this study were purchased from Bena Culture Collection (BNCC). After successful activation, both strains had been cultivated two times on nutrient agar to ensure viability and purity. Bacterial suspensions were diluted to 108, 107, 106 CFU mL−1 with sterilized distill water before used in vases as the preservation solution. All solutions were freshly prepared at the beginning of the experiments and were not renewed. 2.7.2 Treatments of cut roses Stems were sorted into treatments of three stems each, according to flower head size, and stems cut to 35 cm, labeled, and placed into treatments. All glassware and distilled water were sterilized via autoclaving before inoculation. In order to prevent water evaporation and being infected by other microorganisms during the test, the bottle sealed with plastic wrap and placed in a ventilated place without direct sunlight. The vase life and maximum flower diameter were calculated as above mentioned."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis The data was analyzed using the software SPSS 22.0 (SPPS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). In all experiments, at least three biological replicates were used for each experiment. All data from three independent experiments were used. Statistical differences between measurements at different times or in different treatments were analyzed using Duncan s multiple range test. Differences were considered significant at a probability level of P < 0.05."
10,Results,
11,HRW improves the vase life of cut roses,"3.1 HRW improves the vase life of cut roses Various concentrations of HRW changed the vase life of cut roses (Table 1 ). Treatment with 1 % HRW improved the vase life of cut ‘Movie star’. There was no difference in vase life between control and 25 % HRW treatments. Senescence symptoms of cut roses were more pronounced in control than in 1 % and 25 % HRW treatments, and flowers treated with 1 % HRW exhibited less wilting and color change and were still in full bloom (Fig. 1 ). However, the vase life of cut roses treated with 0.5 % and 50 % HRW considerably reduced, compared to control (Table 1). Cut roses treated with 0.5 % and 50 % HRW had bent necks, indicating that treatments with too low or too high levels of H2 reduced its vase life and postharvest quality (Fig. 1). From Fig. 1, it can be observed that 1 % HRW inhibited leaf yellowing and withered on day 6. However, all other treatments showed leaf yellowing and withered. The cut flowers placed in distilled water (control) showed leaf yellowing and withered as early as 3 days of vase life. Therefore, 1 % HRW would be used in the following experiments."
12,HRW increases the water content of cut roses,"3.2 HRW increases the water content of cut roses The water uptake in cut rose flowers initially increased, and then declined in both control and 1 % HRW treatments (Fig. 2 A). Control showed an upward and then began to flatten trend, from 0 to 2 d. However, 1 % HRW showed a constant increase till day 4. The water uptake content showed a increase in 1 % HRW from day 4 and 6, and the increase was higher than that in control. Water loss sustained slow growth in 1 % HRW and control on day 0–8 (Fig. 2B). Treatment with 1 % HRW reduced the water loss compared to control at day 2 and 8, and control sharply increased on day 8. Clearly, water balance presented the same trend with water uptake (Fig. 2C). 1 % HRW maintained high levels of water balance value in cut roses. It was most higher than control on day 4 d, and the decreased tendency of 1 % HRW was slower than that of control. On day 6, the water balance in 1 % HRW was still positive and higher than that in control, while the water balance of control reduced to negative after day 2, indicating that cut roses had begun to senescence. Meanwhile, the rate of fresh weight changes in cut roses initially increased, and then declined in both control and 1 % HRW treatments (Fig. 2D). Treatment with 1 % HRW increased the rate of fresh weight compared with control at days 3 and 4. The rate of fresh weight changes of control dropped under zero at day 5, which suggested that the cut roses began to lose water and entered its senescence phase. However, the rate in treatment with 1 % HRW is still above zero at that time. Therefore, treatment with 1 % HRW might help reduce water loss and maintain high fresh weight in cut roses."
13,HRW influences the cellular structure and reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels of cut roses,"3.3 HRW influences the cellular structure and reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels of cut roses Optical microscope observations showed that clear parenchyma cells and tissue on the stem ends of cut roses on day 0–2 were observed. A small amount of dark substances and spots appeared in the xylem vessels of control, and the cell morphology changed 2 d after treatment. On day 6, some parenchyma cells disorganized in the xylem vessel in control, and a large blockage of dark plugs appeared, which was alleviated by 1 % HRW (Fig. 3 A). Further observation by SEM showed that bacteria appeared in the xylem vessels of control on day 2 and there was no visual evidence of bacteria in their xylem vessels (Fig. 3B). However, bacterial and biofilm were evident in the xylem vessels of control from day 2 to 4. On days 4 and 6, the internal tissues of control stem ends were covered with bacteria and biofilm and the presence of bacteria increased within the xylem vessels. In contrast, few bacteria were observed in the xylem vessels in 1 % HRW treatment on day 2. Even on days 4 and 6 there was relatively limited bacteria growth in the xylem vessels treated with 1 % HRW. Few bacterial blockages were observed inside their xylem vessels. Thus, 1 % HRW markedly reduced bacterial growth and colonization in the xylem vessels of cut roses as compared to control. CLSM observations showed that 1 % HRW inhibited bacterial colonization of and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels of cut roses compared to control (Fig. 3C). A small amount of bacteria were seen on the cross sections and in xylem vessels of control on day 0. By day 2 of the vase period, bacteria and biofilm were highly evident in the internal tissues of control stems on day 2. The colonization became denser in the xylem vessels in control than in 1 % HRW on day 4 and 6. In contrast, few bacteria were observed in the xylem vessels in 1 % HRW on days 2 and 4. It revealed that 1 % HRW inhibited bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels of cut roses."
14,HRW enhances the bacterial growth on the stem-end cut surface of cut roses,"3.4 HRW enhances the bacterial growth on the stem-end cut surface of cut roses We found that both the sterilized distilled water and HRW made from sterilized water reduced the vase life, and had bent necks of cut roses at day 4 (Fig. S1). It indicates that the bacteria may play a vital role on the stem-end cut surface. With the extension of culture time, it was observed visually that the bacterial growth on the stem-end cut surface increased in 1 % HRW compared to control (Fig. 4 A). Grey and yellow circular spots with opaque, sticky and smooth colony morphotypes were observed on the plate colony from control and 1 % HRW. Characterization of short rod-shaped was observed in 1% HRW treatment. The results demonstrate that 1 % HRW can improve bacterial quantity on the stem-end cut surface. Similar results were obtained in multiple trials. When the single bacterial colony characterization was isolated from the plate colony, 1 % HRW promoted growth compared with control (Fig. 4B). Two colony morphotypes were identified. Control and 1 % HRW showed a similar colony of flattened, opaque and white colony morphotypes. Furthermore, under the same incubation conditions, the colony morphotypes of 1 % HRW appeared grey, round, convex, and opaque with irregular margin. Using optical microscope, we found that the colonies in 1 % HRW treatment were rod-shaped bacteria. Both of strains studied consisted of gram-negative bacteria. The morphology analysis and Gram stain revealed that the bacteria might be Pseudomonas fluorescens and Brevundimonas diminuta."
15,HRW regulates the bacterial community and diversity on the stem-end cut surface of cut roses,"3.5 HRW regulates the bacterial community and diversity on the stem-end cut surface of cut roses A similarity level of 97 % was used to identify operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and to estimate the diversity of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in treatments. The high-quality reads were clustered into 60,586 and 61,889 from control and 1 % HRW, respectively (Table S1). Low-abundance OTUs (< 5 total counts) were discarded, resulting in the number of sequences remaining was 4521.67 and 5476.67. The coverage was 99 % in the sample sequences of control and 1 % HRW, indicating the sequencing depth and complete coverage for investigation of the associated microbiota (Table 2 ). There were noteworthy overlaps in differentially abundant OTUs between the treatments (Fig. 5 A). Two hundred and two out of the 270 OTUs enriched in the 1 % HRW were also enriched in control, implying that these taxa are highly ubiquitous in vase life. Alpha diversity analysis was used to analyze the complexity of species diversity in each sample by using several indices, including observed species, Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indices. The Simpson indexes in control and 1 % HRW were 0.1 and 0.11, respectively. The Shannon indexes were 3.13 and 3.02, respectively. There were no differences in bacterial species diversity, which could be observed between control and 1 % HRW. The Chao1 indexes in control and 1 % HRW were 197.52 and 205.95, and the ACE indexes were 218.26 and 245.25, respectively. The richness index of 1 % HRW was higher than control. A comprehensive analysis indicated that the bacterial species abundance of the stem-end cut surface was increased in 1 % HRW treatment, which was in agreement with the results of the bacterial culture as shown in Fig. 4. There were notable differences in the proportions of various phyla and genus across the compartments (Fig. 5B). The 1 % HRW had a greater proportion of Proteobacteria than that of control, whereas Firmicutes were mostly depleted in 1 % HRW. Next, histograms and the heatmap analysis were used to intuitively display the differences in the relative abundances of bacterial OTUs between treatments at Phylum level (Fig. 5C). The results indicated that the relative abundance of Massilia, Methylobacterium, Brevundimonas, Rhodoferax and Azohydromonas increased in 1 % HRW. The relative abundance of Janthinobacterium, Erwinia, Bacillus, Acidovorax and Comamonas increased in control. Duganella, Pseodomonas and Methylobacterium were the common dominant bacteria in both control and 1 % HRW treatments. LEfSe identified the most differentially abundant taxons between control and 1 % HRW treatments (Fig. 5D). LDA effect size taxonomic cladogram was obtained from LEfSe analysis of 16S sequences (relative abundance ⩾ 0.5 %). Proteobacteria, Caulobacterales, Caulobacteraceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, Mesorhizobium, Brevundimonas, which were most abundant in 1 % HRW, and Alcaligenaceae and Azohydromonas, which were most abundant in control, were the dominant phylotypes that contributed to the difference between control and 1 % HRW. Therefore, Pseudomonas of Proteobacteria and Brevundimonas would be used in the following experiments."
16,The dominant bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Brevundimonas diminuta promote the vase life and maximum flower diameter of cut roses,"3.6 The dominant bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Brevundimonas diminuta promote the vase life and maximum flower diameter of cut roses Compared with control, treatments with 106 and 107 CFU mL−1 P. fluorescens improved the vase life of cut ‘Movie star’ by 27.2 % and 37.5 % respectively (Table 3 ). There was no difference in vase life between 106 and 107 CFU mL−1 P. fluorescens treatments. Meanwhile, 106 and 107 CFU mL−1 P. fluorescens treatments improved the maximum flower diameter. On the contrary, the roses treated with 108 CFU mL-1 P. fluorescens conducted the most obvious senescent phenotype from day 4 (Fig. 6 ), which terminated their vase life in 6.89 d. The maximum flower diameter of cut roses treated with 108 CFU mL-1 P. fluorescens was also reduced compare to control. The flowers treated with 107and 106 CFU mL−1 P. fluorescens exhibited less wilting and color change and were still in full bloom on day 8 (Fig. 6). Treatments with 106 and 107 CFU mL−1 B. diminuta improved the vase life, which was prolonged by 30.6 % and 47.5 %, respectively, compared with control (Table 4 ). In addition, treatments with 106 and 107 CFU mL−1 B. diminuta also improved the maximum flower diameter. Result showed that the treatments of 1 % HRW and 107 CFU mL-1 B. diminuta similarly increased the vase life and maximum flower diameter. However, the vase life of cut roses treated with 108 CFU mL-1 B. diminuta was considerably reduced to 7.31 d, which was less than that of control. The maximum flower diameter of cut roses treated with 108 CFU mL-1 B. diminuta was also reduced. Senescence symptoms of cut roses were more pronounced in 108 CFU mL−1 B. diminuta from day 4 (Fig. 7 ). The flowers treated with 107and 106 CFU mL−1 B. diminuta exhibited better postharvest quality as compared to control. 107and 106 CFU mL−1 B. diminuta treatment manifested similar senescence alleviated effect as 1 % HRW. The results above suggested that the bacteria solution of low concentrations improved the shelf life and quality but high concentration of bacteria solution reduced them."
17,Discussion,"In recent year, the roles of gasmolecules, such as NO, CO, H2S, and H2, are involved in wide biological applications (Wang, 2014). H2 has been considered as a novel signaling molecule that involves in developmental and physiological processes in plants, such as seed germination (Renwick et al., 1964), adventitious root formation (Lin et al., 2014), stomata movement (Xie et al., 2014), flowering (Zeng et al., 2013), and anthocyanin biosynthesis (Su et al., 2014). In kiwifruit (Actinidia chinesis cv. Huayou), HRW delayed the occurrence of diseases and preserved postharvest quality during storage by regulating antioxidant capacity (Hu et al., 2014). The postharvest life of cut flowers is usually short because of wilting, color changing, abscission, and early leaf yellowing. In the experiment, 1 % HRW had a positive effect on the vase life, maximum flower diameter and leaf withered of cut rose flowers (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, 0.5 % HRW performed adverse effects on vase life and postharvest quality. This is a very interesting phenomenon, which can be explored in future research. Our previous study observed that treatment with a suitable concentration of HRW increased the postharvest life and maximum flower diameter in cut lily ‘Manissa’ and cut roses ‘Kardinal’ (Ren et al., 2017). Our previous results also found that H2 alleviated postharvest senescence of cut roses by suppressing ethylene biosynthesis (Wang et al., 2019). Thus, our results further certified the conclusion that H2 as a crucial gasotransmitters has drawn great attention because of it roles in the postharvest senescence of cut flowers. Water plays an important role in plant photosynthesis, material metabolism and the maintenance of normal cell morphology. The absorption and transportation of nutrients by plants also rely on water. Under drought stress, HRW increased the relative water content in alfalfa seedling leaves (Jin et al., 2013). Exogenous application of H2 could increase the fresh weight of cabbage seedlings under cadmium stress (Wu et al., 2015). Moreover, it has been known that water balances are one of the most important indicators to determine the degree of senescence of horticultural products. Wang et al. (2019)observed that H2 could extend the vase life and improve the vase quality of cut roses by decreasing the water loss and enlarging the maximum flower diameter. The fresh weight and leaf relative water content in cut lilies and roses were enhanced by HRW (Ren et al., 2017). Here, our results indicated that HRW had a certain effect on the water content in cut roses (Fig. 2). Treatment with 1 % HRW significantly increased water uptake and lowered water loss. As a result, a more favorable water balance and higher fresh weight were obtained in 1 % HRW (Fig. 2). During postharvest of cut flowers, the flower stem becomes blocked (mainly by bacterial growth, secretions, and air embolism) (Meeteren et al., 1999). The water loss through the flowers in cut flowers is greater than the amount of water absorbed, triggering a loss in water balance. Li et al. (2012) indicated that the decline of vase solution uptake was associated with the bacterial growth on and in the stem ends of cut ‘Movie Star’ roses. Moreover, the inhibition of bacteria growth at stem ends of cut ‘Ruikou’ gerbera increased its solution uptake (Liu et al., 2009). Here, we strongly argue that H2 may act as a molecule in the senescence of cut roses by regulating bacterial community in the stem ends. The microbial growth in the xylem vessels results in blockage and rot, it will lead to reduction of plant water uptake (Carlson et al., 2015). In the study, some parenchyma cells disorganized and a large blockage of dark plugs appeared in the xylem vessels from day 2 to 6, that limits the supply of vase solution to the stems. However, the bacterial growth internal tissues of stem ends were significantly alleviated by 1 % HRW (Fig. 3A and B). Thus, H2 might be recognized as a novel inhibitor of bacteria in internal tissues of cut rose stems during vase life. The vascular blockage is believed to be mainly due to the bacterial biofilm formation by the proliferation of the bacteria (Wouter et al., 1989). Biofilm development contributes to the virulence of phytopathogenic bacteria through various mechanisms, including blockage of xylem vessels, increased resistance to plant antimicrobial compounds, and enhanced colonization of specific habitats (Mansfield et al., 2012). Jacob and Kim observed that aggregates of bacterial cells in the xylem vessels as biofilms may result in vascular blockage and early withering of cut flowers (Jacob and Kim, 2010). Bacteria in biofilms become less susceptible to antibacterial agents and can become more difficult to eradicate (Costerton et al., 1999). CLSM observations further showed that 1 % HRW inhibited bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels of cut roses (Fig. 3C). Thus, HRW had demonstrated efficacy in alleviating vascular occlusion of cut roses by evidently inhibiting bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels of cut roses. This is similar to the result that nano-silver pretreatment could inhibit the xylem blockage by bacteria (Lin et al., 2019). Nano-silver promoted the vase life of cut gladiolus ‘Eerde’ spikes by inhibited the growth of stem-end bacteria, which may be the main cause of vascular blockage in the stem-ends, thus limiting the water supply to the stem (Lin et al., 2019). Our previous study also found that increasing the fresh weight and keeping water of cut flowers played an important role in extending the vase life of cut rose and chrysanthemum (Wei et al., 2021). Then, HRW improved water uptake and reduced water loss of cut roses by inhibiting bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels of cut roses. Interestingly, we found that both the sterilized distilled water and HRW made from sterilized water reduced the vase life of cut roses, indicating that the bacteria on the stem-end cut surface induced by H2 may play a vital role in delaying the postharvest senescence of cut roses. In addition, 1 % HRW can remarkably improve bacterial quantity on the stem-end cut surface (Fig. 4A). The HRW-gut microbiota case becomes a hot research topic in biomedicine. According to data of the Human Microbiome Project, most intestinal bacteria can metabolize H2, suggesting that H2 might affect the gut microbial composition (Wolf et al., 2016). A recent human trial confirmed the beneficial effects of HRW consumption on gut microbiota (Sha et al., 2018). Valdes et al. (2018) reported that HRW maintained favorable microbial balance by keeping higher abundance and diversity of gut flora. Generally, in plants, there are many beneficial bacteria on the stem-end cut surface as their harmful bacteria in the xylem vessels. Beneficial bacteria could help plants absorb nutrients, and its production of secondary metabolites which may promote plant growth and development, but could also inhibit the occurrence of plant diseases and insect pests (Mendes et al., 2011). We suggest that the surface serves a critical gating role; of the microbes that are attracted to the stem ends, only a subset can bind on the surface, and a fraction of these are permitted to enter and proliferate inside tissues of the stem ends. To investigate this phenomenon, by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, we found that 1 % HRW significantly increased the richness index of bacteria on the stem-end cut surface were increased by 1 % HRW. A comprehensive analysis indicated that the bacterial species abundance of the stem-end cut surface was increased in 1 % HRW, which agreed with the results of the bacterial culture as shown in Fig. 4. Thus, HRW treatment decrease bacterial blockages rot in the xylem vessels. For example, Pseudomonas was identified from 1 % HRW and control. The vase life of cut carnation flowers treated by Pseudomonas fluorescens (YsS6) and Pseudomonas migulae (8R6) was prolonged (Ali et al., 2012). Aiello et al. (2019) conducted an in vivo and in vitro experiment on Pseudomonas endophytic bacteria to study the effect of Pseudomonas on the prevention of brown rot of peach fruit. The authors found that Pseudomonas has a significant inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth of two pathogens on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Methylobacterium was identified in 1 % HRW. The study of the potato endophyte Methylobacterium sp. IMBG290 demonstrated both growth-promoting and biocontrol capacities (Pavlo et al., 2011). Moreover, Erwinia was identified in control almost not in 1 % HRW, which is a phytopathogenic bacteria found on Medicago sativa, Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Pisum sativum, the environmental adaptation capacity of Erwinia indicated its probable survival within a wide range of environmental conditions and an ability to endure arid, saline and alkaline environments (Zhang and Nan, 2014). Medical research found that drinking hydrogen water for 4 weeks promoted the growth of more than 20 types of bacteria in the intestines (Higashimura et al., 2018). The authors also suggested that hydrogen water may produce a variety of biological effects by optimizing the organization of the intestinal flora. These findings revealed that 1 % HRW could increase beneficial bacteria on the stem-end cut surface and can accordingly decrease bacterial blockages rot in the xylem vessels. However, the specific mechanism needs to be further investigation. Thus, the bacterial binding on the stem-end cut surface acts as a prerequisite for bacterial colonization in the xylem vessels, which belongs to an interdependent relationship in which the bacteria play a key role on the stem-end cut surface. Naturally occurring microorganisms, which are either found as epiphytes on the surface or as endophytes in plant tissues, are comprise of a great variety of microbial species. A larger fraction of these microbes are hypothesized to play a key role in fruit health, quality and disease resistance (Droby and Wisniewski, 2018). In postharvest applications, the beneficial bacteria that promote plant growth can mitigate the yellowing of cut flower leaves, delay senescence, reducing ethylene activity, and improving the formation and quality of high-quality flowers (Hunter et al., 2004). In addition, previous study has shown that Bacillus and Pseudomonas can increase the water uptake rate of chrysanthemum (Kumari et al., 2016). In order to verify the results of high-throughput sequencing, the inoculations of the dominant bacterial were performed, and we found that the roses treated with 107and 106 CFU mL−1 B. diminuta exhibited better postharvest quality that manifested similar senescence alleviation effect as 1 % HRW (Fig. 7). Similar results were also found in two bacterial strains (Pseudomonas fulva and Escherichia coli), referred to as biocontrol bacteria, improved the vase life of cut zinnias (Carlson et al., 2015). Intriguingly, we found that the vase life of cut roses treated with 108 CFU mL-1 P. fluorescens and B. diminuta showed a considerably obvious inhibition. The results above suggested that the bacteria solution of low concentrations improved the vase life and quality, but the high concentration of bacteria solution reduced them. Robinson et al. also reported a correlation between the vase life of cut cv. Pascha roses and the concentration of P. fluorescens in the vase water (Robinson et al., 2007). The previous study showed that Brevundimonas diminuta mediated alleviation of arsenic toxicity and plant growth promotion in Oryza sativa L. (Singh et al., 2016). However, Brevundimonas are first reported from cut flowers."
18,Conclusion,"This study has demonstrated that the acceleration effect of 1 % HRW on the beneficial bacterial taxa may be the key factor in prolonging flower longevity. In brief, the beneficial bacteria abundances were increased by 1 % HRW on the stem-end cut surface. Accordingly, bacterial blockages and rot in the xylem vessels of cut roses decreased in HRW treatment, thus promoting water uptake and prolonging the vase life of cut flowers (Fig. 8 ). However, this claim is still of very limited scope due to a small research in this area, and many unresolved biological attributes of H2. Our research results prove that further scientific endeavors in this direction are reasonable. Therefore, further researches need to be done to investigate the deeper mechanisms, including physiological and biochemical responses and molecular biological mechanism, which will further lay a solid theoretical foundation for the application of H2 preservation and biological control in the senescence of cut flowers."
