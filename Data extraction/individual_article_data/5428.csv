0,Introduction,"Aviation plays a crucial role in domestic and international transport. However, air transport emits greenhouse gases (GHG) and other pollutants. Apart from carbon dioxide (CO2), aviation also emits water vapor, nitrogen oxide (NOX), unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) [1,2]. The direct emissions from aircraft depend primarily on the type of fuel, engine type, and engine load [3]. In total, aviation generated around 2.4 % of global CO2 emissions related to fuel combustion in 2018 [4]. This is expected to grow by more than three-fold between 2000 and 2050 if no measures are taken to reduce emissions [5–9]. On the other hand, fuel consumption per passenger-kilometer from passenger aircraft went down by 24 % from 1990 to 2016, but this reduction in intensity cannot compensate for the increase in the number of flights and distance flown [1]. The year 2020 is an exception, during which the majority of flights have been grounded due to the corona virus pandemic, leading to a reduction in aircraft-related GHG emissions [10]. Global policies have been developed to address the climate impact of aviation. For example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has committed to (i) cutting CO2 emissions from aviation by half by 2050 compared to 2005 levels, (ii) improving average fuel efficiency by 1.5 % per year from 2009 to 2020, and (iii) achieving carbon-neutral growth from 2020 (recently changed to the 2019 level due to the pandemic) [1,11,12]. Low-emitting alternative fuels, CO2 certification of new aircraft, improvements to the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft, and/or enhancements to the efficiency of the propulsion system are proposed to reduce emissions. The transition of the aviation sector to lower GHG emissions is being encouraged through the global Carbon Offsetting and Reducing Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a regulatory framework that aims to stabilize CO2 emissions from the international civil aviation sector at the 2020 level (recently changed to 2019 level) [11,12]. Alternative aviation fuels include bio-jet fuels (fuels of the “kerosene type,” produced from biomass), synthetic jet fuels (kerosene-type fuels produced from natural gas and coal), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied methane gas [13] from other origins than natural gas [13], liquefied hydrogen (LH2), electrofuels, and electricity. The development and commercialization of different bio-jet fuels is on-going, and many airlines around the world have already tested bio-jet fuels in some of their aircraft [14]. There are also some airlines that are using blends of bio-jet fuels for their regular flights [1,5,15]. Bio-jet fuels are one of the main options expected to replace a significant share of conventional jet fuels in the aviation sector [1,16]. In parallel, there is growing interest for production and testing of other types of fuels (e.g., electricity, hydrogen, and electrofuels) [17]. Electrofuels (also known as power-to-gas/liquids/fuels, or e-fuels) are hydrogen-derived fuels produced from water and CO2 or water and nitrogen, with electricity as the primary source of energy [18]. Electrofuels of interest for the aviation sector include, for example, electro-jet fuel (e-jet fuel) and liquefied electro methane gas (e-LMG). Synthetic-jet fuels from coal and natural gas are beneficial in terms of drop-in capability and costs, but their life-cycle CO2 emissions are potentially (1.5–1.8 times) higher than the corresponding emissions from conventional jet fuel [19,20]. In recent years, there have been several reviews of alternative aviation fuels focusing on, for example, (i) different bio-jet fuel production processes for a diverse set of feedstocks [21–27], (ii) bio-jet fuel production pathways and combustion characteristics in gas turbines [28,29], (iii) commercialization status and future prospects of bio-jet fuels [25,30], and (iv) the performance of alternative drop-in jet fuels [20,31]. However, the existing studies generally do not review the operating costs of bio-jet fuels nor the production or operating costs of other potential low-carbon alternative aviation fuel options. Exceptions are [14,32], which reviewed the production and fuel selling price of bio-jet fuels. However, comparisons with the cost and status of other alternative jet fuels are not included. This study reviews a broad set of alternative aviation fuels and possible propulsion systems, focusing on costs and technology/fuel readiness. More specifically, this study include the costs for alternative aviation fuels and model conceptual aircraft design for some alternative aviation fuels to estimate the direct operating costs for these aircraft. This study contributes to an understanding of the potential technology pathways to low- or zero-carbon-emission air transport and the associated costs. Section 2 presents the approach, and Section 3 gives an overview of the status of different alternative aviation fuels. Section 4 describes propulsion systems, and Section 5 includes the modeling of conceptual aircraft for alternative aviation fuels. Section 6 reviews the cost of alternative aviation fuels, and in Section 7 the direct operating cost for conceptual aircraft is estimated, and, finally, the findings are discussed."
1,Method and reviewed literature,"In this article, a literature review of alternative aviation fuels and propulsion systems, focusing on costs, is combined with an assessment of direct operating costs for two aircraft types using selected fuels and propulsion systems. Based on the literature review, options for a more detailed analysis are selected. In this study, the term ‘alternative jet fuels’ refers to different types of refined fuels with similar properties to Jet A/Jet A-1 and other conventional kerosene-based fuels, while the broader term “alternative aviation fuels” represents all types of low-to zero-carbon-emitting aircraft fuels. For the literature review, the online database ‘Scopus’ is used to find the literature for different combinations of complementary search terms. 1 1 ‘alternative aviation fuels,' ‘alternative jet fuels,' ‘sustainable aviation fuels,' ‘aircraft engine test biofuel,’ ‘bio-jet fuels,' ‘synthetic jet fuels,' ‘synfuel jet,’ ‘bio kerosene,' ‘gas turbine fuels,' ‘liquefied natural gas,’ ‘liquefied methane,’ ‘bio-methane,’ ‘electro-fuels,’ ‘power to liquid fuel,’ ‘gas to liquid,’ ‘coal to liquid,’ ‘hydrogen,’ ‘liquefied hydrogen,’ ‘jet propulsion cost,' ‘gas turbine engines cost,' ‘future aircraft technologies,' ‘economic feasibility,' ‘alternative jet fuel cost,' ‘all-electric aircraft,' ‘hybrid-electric aircraft,’ ‘LNG aircraft cost,' ‘fuel cell aircraft cost'. As an example, Scopus tracks 1,711 publications related to alternative jet fuels from 1955 to 2020 with the search term (”jet fuel*”OR jetfuel* OR “aviation fuel*” OR “aircraft* fuel*”) AND (sustainable OR renewable OR alternative). The major publications related to alternative jet fuels primarily started around 2005; our review covers the period from 2005 to 2019. The search terms yielded 1,423 publications in the period 2005–2019, including 4 planned for publication in 2020. Different types of alternative aviation fuels is separated by adding search terms such as ‘bio-jet fuels,’ ‘synthetic jet fuels,’ ‘hydrogen,’ ‘liquefied natural gas,’ and ‘ammonia’ to the main search term. Then, all these articles are checked to find out whether the articles focus on alternative aviation fuels or not. Hybrid and electric aircraft-related publications are searched with different search terms such as ‘all-electric aircraft,' ‘hybrid-electric aircraft,’ and ‘future aircraft technologies.' Of the 1423 publications, 847 are specifically related to alternative aviation fuels. Of these, 91 publications either describe the relationship between aircraft's engines and alternative fuels or the costs related to the aviation fuels and aircraft engines and are therefore selected for our systematic review of alternative aviation fuels and related propulsion systems (including electric and hybrid propulsions for future aircraft). Fig. 1 illustrates the number of papers in Scopus on different types of alternative aviation fuels, published between 2005 and 2019. Most studies include comparisons of alternative fuels with conventional jet fuels. The number of papers on alternative aviation fuels published annually has increased since 2005. The majority (73 %) of the total published papers focus on bio-jet fuels, whereas 20 % of the publications focus on synthetic jet fuel based on natural gas or coal; there are very few publications related to other alternative fuels. The literature on alternative fuels and related propulsion reviewed in this study includes peer-reviewed scientific articles, a doctoral dissertation, conference papers, and reports. For the electric propulsion systems, recently published master's degree theses [33–37] are also reviewed as these contain valuable information about the design, concept, and cost of electric aircraft. The selected publications are examined in terms of the following aspects: a) included alternative aviation fuels (for simplicity, electricity is defined as a fuel in our study) and production processes, b) included propulsion technologies for next-generation aircraft (including fuel cells and batteries), c) included costs, i.e., minimum jet fuel selling prices (MJFSPs), costs for aircraft propulsion systems as well as operating costs for alternative aviation fuels, and d) costs for different components of propulsion technologies. The MJFSP is the minimum bio-jet fuel price to make a bio-jet fuel plant profitable or, more specifically, the minimum price a customer has to pay to purchase the jet fuel such that a zero net present value (NPV, the sum of future cash flows to and from the shareholders) of profit is achieved for a certain rate of return [38,39]. The literature review is summarized in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material, which lists the alternative jet fuels and aircraft propulsion technologies studied, fuel production pathways, and costs. In this study, liquefied natural gas is denoted LNG, liquefied methane gas from sources other than natural gas is denoted LMG, and the broader term of liquefied methane, including both LNG and LMG, is denoted LCH4."
2,Design of aircraft concepts with alternative aviation fuels,"2.1 Design of aircraft concepts with alternative aviation fuels To understand the differences in characteristics among alternative aircraft fuels, eight aircraft designs/concepts (four aircraft concepts each for medium- and long-range market segments) based on existing modified tube-and-wing aircraft designs are modeled. The baseline aircraft are the A321-neo for the medium-range segment and the A350-900 for the long-range segment, both operating on conventional jet fuel (Jet-A). Six additional aircraft (three aircraft for each segment) are designed to comply with the requirements for different types of aviation fuels: bio-jet fuels, liquefied methane (LCH4), and liquefied hydrogen (LH2). Electric aircraft is not included in this modeling and only the electro-jet fuels with the same characteristics as the chosen fuels (e.g., in the form of methane or hydrogen) in order to limit the scope. Table 1 lists the properties of the different fuels, where conventional Jet-A and biofuel data are provided by public sources, whereas the properties of methane and H2 are obtained using REFPROP [40] and H2 tools [41]. The properties listed in Table 1 are extremely important in aircraft design, since they dictate the mass of fuel to be carried as well as the volume of the storage tanks. For example, the gravimetric energy density of hydrogen (MJ/kg) is 2.8 times higher than that of Jet A-1, meaning that the aircraft fuel mass can be reduced by the same amount, provided that the overall system efficiency is retained. On the other hand, the fuel's lower volumetric energy density (MJ/m3) leads to a four-fold increase in volume storage. For LH2 and LCH4, the cryogenic storage temperatures require the use of heavy insulated tanks, resulting in additional weight penalties. All the aircraft rely on turbofan engines for propulsion. The commercial aircraft conceptual design tool Pacelab APD is used to design, optimize, and model the performance of all 8 aircraft. The aircraft top-level requirements (ATLR) are listed in Table S3, together with the fixed aircraft parameters. The ATLR are derived from Airbus public data [44–47] and are used to calibrate the two baseline aircraft models (based on A350–900 and A321neo). After calibration, the sizing parameters are fixed to allow for the redesign and optimization of the four cryogenically fueled aircraft (two for each range segment). Note that the aircraft design does not change when replacing Jet A-1 with 100 % bio-jet fuel; operating with bio-jet fuel is therefore assumed to be an off-design condition of the Jet A-1-powered aircraft. Trade studies (a multi-criteria decision-making process to identify the preferable technical solution among a set of solutions, commonly used in design of aircraft) are then carried out to find the combination of wing loading and thrust-to-weight ratio that returns the minimum fuel burn. The aircraft models included rubberized engine models for which the performance and thrust-to-weight ratio is defined using engine certification data [48,49] and engine performance from in-house engine models calibrated using publicly available data such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s emissions data bank [50]. In the proposed LH2 and LCH4 aircraft concepts, the cylindrical tanks, with semi-sphere end caps, are mounted externally on the upper surface of the fuselage. The two tanks are separated by a fail-safe gap to account for the path of possible engine debris (Fig. 2 ). The cryogenic fuel tanks require adequate insulation as well as the use of materials that are resistant to embrittlement and to the cyclic loads caused by the thermal expansion and contraction during re-filling and fuel consumption. The selected insulation material is polyvinyl chloride and its thickness is sized for the allowable mission boil-off rate that normally differs for the different mission segments. The tanks are made of 2219 aluminum alloy and the wall thickness is sized for a pressure of 2.2 bar. The methodology used for the mechanical and thermal design can be found in Ref. [51]."
3,Alternative aviation-fuel production cost,"2.2 Alternative aviation-fuel production cost For the review of costs of alternative aviation fuels, the MJFSP are considered when available. MJFSPs are dependent on the net present value (NPV) or rate of return on capital expenditure, feedstocks used, and production pathways. The MJFSP for 9 different alternative aviation fuels for 12 different alternative aviation fuel pathways based on 26 different sources are reviewed (Table S2). For LH2 and LNG, the market purchase prices are available and included in the comparison [52,53]. The electro-jet fuel production cost represents estimated ‘well-to-tank’ costs from renewable resources [54], and the H2 production costs are estimated from different pathways [55] such as electrolysis, gasification of biomass, and steam methane-reforming [56] of natural gas [31,57,58]. All obtained cost values are converted to the same unit ($2019/GJ) using the consumer price index (CPI–U) [59]. For LH2 and electrolysis LCH4 as jet fuel, there are a limited number of cost estimates, and these are therefore to some extent based on cost estimates for other applications reported in Refs. [18,53,55,61,62]."
4,Direct operating cost (DOC),"2.3 Direct operating cost (DOC) Aircraft operating expenses are not only important for the potential customer but also very significant in the design of new aircraft systems [63]. Estimation of direct operating cost (DOC) helps in understanding the economic feasibility of alternative aviation fuels in new and existing aircraft. DOC for an aircraft system based on an alternative aviation fuel is calculated based on the design parameters stated in Section 5. Two different flight routes; medium route distance (1117 nautical miles, 2068.7 km) from Hong Kong to Seoul for medium-range [56] aircraft and long route distance (6008 nautical miles, 11,126.8 km) from Hong Kong to San Francisco for long-range (LR) aircraft are established as in Ref. [64]. All the formulas and the DOC calculating method are based on the aircraft cost estimation formula in Ref. [65] (pp. 546–547; other parameters considered are based on [64]). The aircraft and engine costs are estimated according to the formula used in Ref. [66]. The overall formula to calculate DOC is presented in (1), with details of the calculations specified in Table S5. (1) D O C = T o t a l f i n a n c i a l cos t + T o t a l c r e w cos t + T o t a l c h arg e s a n d f e e s + A i r f r a m e m a int e n a n c e cos t + E n g i n e m a int e n a n c e cos t + F u e l o p e r a t i n g cos t The fuel costs used in the base case are 0.62 $/kg for Jet A-1, 2.10 $/kg for bio-jet fuel, 6. 87$/kg for electro-jet, 0.49 $/kg for LNG, 3.61 $/kg for LCH4, 5.62 $/kg for LH2 (NG), and 10.25 $/kg for LH2 (Renew) produced by water electrolysis. All fuel costs in $2019/kg are the average of our review results for fuel prices (MJFSP) in Section 6. The highest and lowest fuel costs from the range of costs in our review is used for sensitivity assessment. Current fuel cost for liquid biogas (LBG) and LNG are taken from Refs. [52,67] respectively. The electro-jet concept aircraft are not modeled but assumed to have similar characteristics as the bio-jet concept aircraft. The DOC of an aircraft is largely dependent on the ratio of the price of alternative aviation fuel to that of jet fuel, aircraft manufacturing cost, and total investment cost. Crew cost and total charges and fees are constant for the respective aircraft size and specified flight route. Financial costs (depreciation, insurance, and interest costs) are also fixed costs and reliant on the aircraft manufacturing cost and investment cost components. Two different types of sensitivity analyses are done, (i) to analyze the effects on DOC of high and low MJFSP and propulsion system cost (see Table 2) and ( ii) to investigate the influence of a decreasing fuel production cost for alternative aviation fuels (LH2 and electro-jet) versus an increasing carbon tax on the conventional Jet A-1 fuel."
5,Alternative aviation fuels,"Currently, aviation mainly uses jet fuels including Jet A-1, Jet A (only US), JP-5, and JP-8 (military aircraft), although Jet B and JP-4 are also used as blends of kerosene-naphtha and kerosene-gasoline [3,68,69]. Aviation also uses a small amount of aviation gasoline (Avgas), a residual lead-blended aviation fuel, mainly used in reciprocating-engine or piston-engine aircraft [70]. However, the use of Avgas is declining, and no new aircraft using the Avgas fuel technology are expected to be built, mainly due to environmental concerns [71,72]. The alternative aviation fuels, including electricity as energy carrier for electric aircraft, differ in their feedstocks and production processes [20; see Fig. 3 for the production pathways. The major pathways include Fischer-Tropsch, pyrolysis, alcohol to jet, hydroprocessing, hydrothermolysis, liquefaction, fermentation, electrolysis, and electrochemical processes (details below). Electricity is used in all pathways, but its main use is in electrolysis and for charging batteries, the latter representing the only direct use of electricity. In contrast to several of the bio-jet fuels, H2 and LH2 as well as LCH4 have not been certified for use in aviation. Most of the reviewed studies are based on gas turbines, primarily with turboprop/turbofan configurations. Most articles are based on the current state of technologies. However, some articles consider future developments until 2035 and 2050 or beyond. Since methanol, ethanol, and butanol have poor fuel combustion characteristics, from a jet-fuel perspective, these fuels are not included in this study [31,58,68,73,74]. Table 3 compares the alternative aviation fuels; more details are provided in the following sections."
6,Bio-jet fuels,"3.1 Bio-jet fuels A total number of 617 studies related to bio-jet fuels were published in 2005–2019, with recent years seeing a marked increase. Bio-jet fuels are generally found to possess a lot of advantages over conventional jet fuel, especially regarding climate impact and soot emissions [58,75]. Similarly, low blending of bio-jet fuels with conventional jet fuel reduces exhaust toxicity [76]. The energy content (by weight) and other fuel properties of bio-jet fuels are rather similar to those of conventional jet fuel, which aids adoption in existing engines. However, bio-jet fuels may increase emissions of water vapor, NOx, carbon monoxide, and CO2 emissions [58,77,78]. Some technical challenges have been reported related to seals shrinking, potentially resulting in leakage from fuel tanks [79]. One study suggested retrofitting conventional engines when burning blends of bio-jet fuels and conventional jet fuel [80]. Current engine and propulsion systems are not compatible with 100 % bio-jet fuels which require retrofitting and development of new engine propulsion systems. Bio-jet fuels are limited by the sustainable biomass supply potential and potential competition for the raw biomass from other sectors [1,6]. Yang et al. [81] highlight that the aromatic-free jet fuels such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) typically have lower specific energy density than those including aromatics, e.g., synthetic iso-paraffinic kerosene [82], synthetic paraffinic kerosene/aromatic (SPK/A) and conventional jet fuels. The lower specific energy density is also noted by Refs. [14,83]. Currently, seven different technological pathways for bio-based aviation fuels have been, or are in the process of becoming, certified for blending with conventional aviation fuels (Table 3). The technology readiness level (TRL) refers in the reviewed literature to validation of the full-scale development of technologies (what technology are not always specified) and fuel readiness level (FRL) refers to the implementation of alternative aviation fuels in the operation of aircraft once the business model is validated and the production capability established [30,84]. Considering TRL and FRL, only the HEFA pathway is currently commercially ready (Table 3). Some other alternative bio-jet fuels from additional pathways such as alcohol-to-jet synthetic kerosene with aromatics (ATJ-SKA), synthetic aromatic kerosene (SAK), shell-integrated hydropyrolysis hydroprocessed (IH2), high freeze point hydrotreated esters and fatty Acids (HFP-HEFA), and synthetic kerosene (SK) for aviation gas turbines are under consideration by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), while hydrocarbon-hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HC-HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch co-processing (FT-co-processing) have just passed the ASTM ballot [58,85]. Bio-jet fuels can be produced from different biomass sources using different processes; see Fig. 3 for the main pathways."
7,Electro-jet fuels,"3.2 Electro-jet fuels In this study, electrofuels are defined as fuels that are achieved by storing electrical energy from renewable sources in the chemical bonds of liquid or gaseous fuels. Electrofuels are primarily produced from electricity via electrolysis of water with the use of captured carbon (or nitrogen), forming, for example, Fischer-Tropsch kerosene, methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), hydrogen [41], ammonia (NH3), and n-octane (nC8H18) [31,86,87]. Our definition of electrofuels also includes electrochemical synthesis pathways. Electrofuels have the potential to become carbon-neutral fuels if renewable electricity is used in the production processes [88]. A few studies, such as [31,54,89], have emphasized the use of electrofuels in the aviation sector. The total number of publications related to electro-jet fuel in 2005–2019 is 14, with an increasing trend since 2014. Current commercial actors mention electro-jet fuel candidates such as Fischer-Tropsch kerosene [87]; according to Goldmann et al., electro-n-octane could also be a possible electrofuel for the aviation sector [31]. The TRL of alkaline electrolysis, proton-exchange membrane (PEM), and high-temperature electrolysis (SOEC) are 9, 7–8, and 5–6, respectively [90]. The carbon needed for electro-jet fuels can come from a variety of sources. Depending on the technology, CO2 extraction from industrial exhaust gas has a TRL of 6–9, whereas CO2 absorption from air has a TRL of 6 [54,90]. Several companies plan to produce electrofuels, including electro-jet fuels, at commercial scale. For instance, Norsk e-Fuel AS, an industry consortium, is building an electro-jet fuel plant in Norway that aims to produce 8,000 tons of electro-jet fuel per year in the near future [86]. Full-scale operation of an electro-jet fuel factory based on gas-to-liquid technology is expected to be possible by 2025 [91]. Electro-jet fuels for use in commercial aviation are not yet certified by ASTM."
8,Liquefied methane,"3.3 Liquefied methane The interest in use of liquefied methane in aircraft started with LNG, which has been tested and studied for decades, with interest increasing in recent years [58,92–94]. A total of 17 papers related to LNG for aviation were published in 2005–2019. The studies and experimental tests have shown that LNG is a viable option as an alternative aviation fuel; however, it is not used in normal service and operations [31,94–97]. The main energy carrier in LNG is methane, which can also be produced from biomass pathways (e.g., liquefied biogas) and electrofuels pathways. However, several challenges remain in operating LCH4 aircraft, where design and construction of the LCH4 storage tanks and supply chain infrastructure are the biggest challenges [95]. Cryogenic fuel tanks are required to operate LCH4 in an aircraft; these are larger and heavier than other fuel tanks [94,97]. It is possible to construct spherical and cylindrical cryogenic tanks for LCH4 using welded structure of aluminum [97,98] that can be placed at the bottom of the wing as an external fuel tank [97]. Burston et al. [93] estimated that fuel tanks in the tail engine or under wing configurations will be advantageous, as fuel tanks within the fuselage consume useful space. The energy density, storage issues, and lack of drop-in capability make LCH4 score low in Goldmann et al. [31]."
9,Hydrogen/liquefied hydrogen (H2/LH2),"3.4 Hydrogen/liquefied hydrogen (H2/LH2) A total of 25 papers related to hydrogen [41] for aviation were published in 2005–2019. H2 is perceived as an attractive alternative aviation fuel both in recent and past research as it has a great supply potential, contains three times the energy content per weight of traditional jet kerosene (43.2 MJ/kg vs 120 MJ/kg respectively), and does not produce CO2 from combustion [3,31,100,101]. It is flammable, has a very short ignition time in comparison to conventional jet fuel [102], and provides a wider stability range. It has the highest thermal conductivity among all fuels, and high heat capacity and low dynamic viscosity, which provide superior cooling properties for operation at high speeds and high combustor temperatures [103]. Due to the high diffusivity, it mixes very well with air and other fuels. From use in the aircraft, it does not produce any harmful pollutants or particulate matter, except NOX emissions [57,103]. H2 is the lightest among all molecules and rises in the free atmosphere, which reduces the danger associated with accidental leakages. H2-based aircraft engines are possible to operate at a slightly lower turbine temperature, and the lifetime is expected to potentially increase by 25 % relative to identical gas turbines operating on jet fuel [3]. H2 is also the preferred fuel for aircraft propulsion systems based on fuel cells. The use of H2 in a turbine engine or a fuel cell currently yields efficiencies of 44 % up to 60 % (fuel cell) [103,104]. H2 can be produced via gasification of coal, natural gas, and biomass followed by reforming of the syngas [57,58]. Water electrolysis is another production method. The PEM electrolysers, the alkaline electrolysers, and the solid oxide electrolysers have estimated future efficiencies (lower heating values) in the range of 62–79 %, 50–74 %, and approx. 80 %, respectively [18,105]. H2 production from the gasification and pyrolysis of coal and natural gas are not renewable pathways, while H2 production from biomass or water electrolysis are renewable pathways with low or zero fossil-CO2 emissions [57]. The density of LH2 is two times greater than for compressed gaseous H2 at 700 bar [106]. Therefore, LH2 is frequently considered the prime candidate for H2 storage in aviation. Liquefaction is the process of converting solid or gaseous fuels to liquid fuels via a variety of industrial processes. For H2 fuel, the liquefication of gaseous H2 requires compression and the removal of large amounts of heat. The liquefaction process consumes about 25 % of the energy content in hydrogen [107]. The first successful experimental LH2-powered aircraft was a modified B–57B twin-engine bomber. In 1955, the aircraft was successfully flight tested for LH2 operation in one of its J-65 turbojet engines, in cruise conditions for a total of 21 min [103]. Similarly, LH2 was successfully tested to power a Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft in 1988 [103]. Since LH2 has a very low density (71 kg/m3) relative to conventional jet fuel (800 kg/m3), storage requires four times the conventional volume. Thus, new aircraft designs and engine modifications are required to accommodate the H2 fuel. In addition, a dedicated heat management system is required to supply the LH2 to the combustion chamber at an adequate temperature [3]. Moreover, the extremely low storage temperatures of LH2 require careful tank insulation to control the boil-off rate and avoid the explosion of tanks [108]. The tank construction should also consider hydrogen embrittlement, where the use of specific aluminum alloys provides a good compromise between weight and performance [3]. The energy density, storage issues, and lack of drop-in capability make LH2 score low in Goldmann et al. [31]."
10,Electricity,"3.5 Electricity It is possible to use direct electricity in aviation. Direct use of electricity requires electric engines and electricity storage onboard. Batteries and ultracapacitors are the most common types of electricity storage options discussed, but require further development [109]. Current electricity generation is emissions-intensive in many regions, but increasing trends in the use of renewables for energy production will help reduce emissions from this sector in the future, where for example wind and solar are expected to be cost-competitive due to current mass production [110,111]."
11,Ammonia,"3.6 Ammonia Ammonia (NH3) is perceived as a potential fuel for gas turbines in a few studies as it has a high H2 content but not any carbon atoms [31,112–115]. These and other studies have suggested that NH3 mixed with H2 or LCH4, can be used as aviation fuel in low blending or as a dual fuel solution in modified aircraft engines and fuel cells [31,88,112–116]. Ammonia has been tested in different types of aircraft, including rocket aircraft and an NH3-based gas turbine is being developed [114–116]. However, the performance of NH3 in aircraft engines is not well known and requires additional study. For example, it has been shown that NH3 as turbine fuel increases NOX emissions [31,116]. However, blending NH3 with other fuels (e.g. H2) can improve NH3 combustion as well as reduce NOx emissions in turbine and reciprocal engines [31,117,118]. Toxicity and corrosiveness are problematic issues with NH3 which calls for new materials for storage tanks and fuel lines as well as safe handling methods for fuel distribution [31,114,116]. The energy density of LNH3 is very low (13.6 GJ/m3), which means that larger storage tanks are required, and the weight is greater, compared to jet fuel [31]. The most common way to produce NH3 is via the Haber-Bosch process, synthesizing H2 and nitrogen (N) to NH3 [31]. The Haber–Bosch process has an energy efficiency of about 60–65 % if the H2 is produced via steam reforming of fossil fuels, while for water electrolysis pathways the efficiency is around 40 % [31]. NH3 can also be produced via the electrochemical reduction of molecular nitrogen via solid-state NH3 synthesis; this process can have an efficiency as high as 66 % [31]."
12,Propulsion systems,"The type of alternative aviation fuels used will influence which type of propulsion system is applicable (and vice versa). Fuel consumption on an aircraft is strongly connected to the propulsion system employed, as well as aircraft aerodynamic performance and weight. It is also affected by operations, more specifically flight routes, air traffic management, and weather patterns. Most of today's commercial aircraft are powered by turbofan engines, where a large fan is driven by a gas turbine engine [126]. For the next generation aircraft, the engine industry is developing more advanced propulsion concepts, e.g., ultra-high bypass-ratio-geared turbofan technology and open-rotor technology. Additionally, more radical engine-core technologies, including pressurized combustion [127,128], LH2 [129,130] and hybrid or all-electric aircraft [37,131,132] are being envisaged for aircraft with the potential to curb CO2 and non-CO2 emissions."
13,Conventional aircraft propulsion,"4.1 Conventional aircraft propulsion The majority of today's single- and twin-aisle commercial aircraft rely on turbofan or turboprop propulsion systems [133,134]. The core of such systems is based on gas turbine technology powered by kerosene fuel (jet fuel). For medium- and long-range applications, the turbofan engine provides a good compromise between high subsonic speed thrust capability and fuel consumption, relative to propeller-based aeroengines [36,133]. The turbofan takes in surrounding air by the engine inlet, some of which passes through the fan to the compressor and then to the burner where it is mixed with fuel, and combustion occurs. Then, hot exhaust gas passes through the turbines and moves towards the nozzle, producing thrust. Most of the air pushed by the fan bypasses the engine core through a duct to create additional thrust. Due to the extra thrust by the fan-bypass air, it produces higher thrust for nearly the same amount of fuel used by the core and becomes more fuel-efficient. The turbofan has undergone a considerable reduction in fuel consumption since its introduction, by about 50 % from the early JT3D to today's engines such as the GENX. Advancements in cooling technology and materials have allowed overall pressure ratios to increase from around 20 to today's 50+, enabling an increase in the thermal efficiency of the engine. The progress in core engine technology, combined with low-weight solutions, has allowed engines to increase their propulsive efficiency, leading to a continuous increase in size and weight for an ever-improving fuel economy. Long-term, it may be possible to reduce specific fuel consumption (SFC) by another 20 % by 2050 compared to today's best engines [135]. In a turboprop engine, the propeller shaft is driven by the power produced by the gas turbine core. For lower-speed aircraft, this combination provides the best propulsive efficiency. Most of the thrust is produced by the propeller, with a small contribution from the engine exhaust [136,137]. The engine core is very similar to that of a turbofan but substantially smaller and therefore less efficient. Turboprop is used in many low-speed aircraft and in commuter aviation. Turboprop is a much more cost-effective choice for short-distance fuel economy, when speed is not critical. Bio-jet fuel in blended form is already utilized in conventional propulsion systems, and electro-jet fuels if produced via the FT-process may also be of the right type."
14,Electric propulsion systems,"4.2 Electric propulsion systems The development of electric aircraft is driven by the necessity of meeting the ambitious environmental targets [56]. Three different types of electric propulsion configurations are classified based on the electrical powertrain arrangement and the use of electricity: 1) all-electric, 2) turbo-electric, and 3) hybrid-electric. An all-electric propulsion system relies solely on the battery or fuel cell as energy source, while the hybrid-electric propulsion system relies on both battery or fuel cells and jet-fuel- based gas turbine engines. A turbo-electric configuration is based on the combination of a gas turbine with an electric generator, which converts the fuel's chemical energy into electric power to fully or partially drive the electric propulsor [56]. Hybrid-electric propulsion configurations can be further classified as series- or parallel-based architectures, depending on how the two sources of energy are connected [56]. There are numerous projects underway developing electric aircraft based on all of the aforementioned propulsion configurations [35]. Different types of aircraft require different values of specific energy and specific power to become operational. Today's batteries can be used to power 2-4-seat short-range planes, but do not have enough energy density to support the needs of single- and twin-aisle aircraft. The latter requires 20,000 to 300,000 kW of shaft power at take-off and start off with 200,000 to 3,000,000 kWh of energy onboard [138,139]. Thus, although several demonstration electric aircraft exist, these are still at the pilot stage. IATA suggests that technological feasibility for hybrid-electric aircraft will be achieved after 2035 [140]. All-electric aircraft carrying 50–100 passengers will, if developed, probably not be possible before mid-century [9,139]. Hybrid systems introduce the option of more integrated technologies, such as distributed electric propulsion or boundary layer ingestion, resulting in improved propulsive efficiency. The hybrid-electric system consists of gas turbine engines, electrically driven propulsors, electric generators, electric motors, and optional storage systems [37,141]. Currently, hybrid demonstrators are under development, and some have already been flight tested [142–144]. One challenge of hybrid aircraft is that the maximum take-off weight (MTOW) increases with the increasing supply power ratio of the batteries, which limits the range of the aircraft [131]. Again, battery performance seems to be a critical aspect of technological feasibility [141]. Also, hybridization does not promise a major CO2-emission reduction [141], and no certification process exists yet for hybrid-electric aircraft. A key challenge of electric aviation is the limited onboard energy-storage capacity in batteries [31]. Currently, battery-based electric aircraft with carrying capacities of 1–9 passengers have been developed and flown for demonstration and training purposes, while larger all-electric aircraft concepts with passenger capacities up to 189 are being studied [35]. The newest flyable demonstrator programs are scaling up the power to 100 kW and above [109]. To put this in perspective, we refer back to the 20,000–300,000 kW power requirement for take-off in commercial aircraft. Fuel cells are also a potential solution in future aircraft propulsion systems [145]. Alkaline fuel cells have been used in spacecraft for four decades and are currently deployed in some self-piloted aircraft [146]. Fuel cells have higher specific energy (>250 Wh/kg) and energy density (1600 Wh/L) than Li-ion batteries [147,148]. Energy-density targets of 2000 Wh/kg have been set by actors in the aviation industry [149]. Electricity produced in the fuel cell is used to drive the electric motor, while heat produced can be used to enhance a combined-cycle application [146]. For aircraft applications, PEM fuel cells are often considered most promising due to the quick start up, use of air as oxidant, and their operating temperature range [145,150]. Hydrogen is the main fuel considered for fuel cells, but other fuels such as jet fuel, NH3, LCH4, methanol, and ethanol can also be utilized in different types of fuel cells and fuel-reforming steps [116,138,151,152]. In addition, Fleckner et al. [153] assessed the aircraft application of the multi-fuel reforming fuel cell systems (fuel processing system) using biodiesel."
15,Conceptual design of aircraft based on alternative aviation fuels and propulsion systems,"A comparison between the different aircraft in terms of performance and design parameters is given in Tables 4 and S4. The ranges vary among the different designs. The bio-jet aircraft have the same design as the Jet A-1 baseline configurations (same operational empty weight (OEW) and manufacturer's empty weight (MEW) values). Thus, it represents a Jet A-1 aircraft operating with a slightly different fuel. The bio-jet long-range (LR) aircraft shows an increase in range relative to the Jet A-1 counterpart. This is due to an increase in specific energy density (MJ/kg) by approximately 1.6 %. On the other hand, the range of the medium-range (MR) bio-jet aircraft is reduced relative to the Jet A baseline. This reflects the impact of the lower volumetric energy density (MJ/m3) of bio-jet, which requires more volume for the same amount of energy. In the LR aircraft, excess tank volume is available, but that is not the case for the MR aircraft, and therefore the aircraft cannot carry enough fuel mass to satisfy the range requirement. Aircraft aerodynamic performance, given as the ratio between lift and drag (L/D) at mid-cruise conditions for the aircraft, also varies. The larger fuselage volume required to accommodate the tanks, and consequent increase in wetted area, results in a deterioration in aerodynamic performance for the cryogenically powered aircraft. This effect is slightly outweighed by an increased wing loading (less wing area per kg) in the LCH4 aircraft. The reason the wing loading can increase is that the fuel is now carried in external tanks and not inside the wing structure. Therefore, the wing can be made smaller, provided that it is still compliant with low-speed performance (take-off field length, landing field length, approach speed). For the LH2 aircraft, the wing loading is reduced due to the increased landing weight that requires more wing area per mass to meet the minimum approach speed requirement. Interesting enough, in absolute values, the wing area of both cryogenically fueled aircraft is similar for the long-range segment due to the lower hydrogen fuel weight. The higher OEW figure in the LH2 and LCH4 is due to the need for externally mounted heavy fuel tanks that require a support structure, insulation, fairing, and individual pumping and fuel distribution systems. The aircraft are compared in terms of block energy use per passenger/km. Block energy includes the energy stored in the fuel consumed during the mission (excluding reserves). The best performing aircraft are the ones fueled by Jet A-1 followed by bio-jet. Recall that the bio-jet-fueled aircraft is designed to operate with Jet A-1, and therefore operation with bio-jet is under off-design conditions, this can explain the worse performance despite the increased fuel energy content. The worst performing aircraft in terms of block energy is the LCH4 LR. This is due to a combination of increased weight and drag, caused by the required tank volume and cryogenic storage requirements. Note that the fuel mass required by the LCH4 LR is substantial, despite the improvement of gravimetric energy density by approximately 15 % relative to Jet A-1. The required fuel mass carried by the LH2 LR aircraft is reduced by 61 % relative to the LCH4 configuration. This seems to lead to a slightly better energy performance, despite having the worst L/D performance and increased OEW. In contrast with the LR configurations, the LH2 MR aircraft performs slightly worse than the LCH4 counterpart. This appears to be driven by a combination of the smaller fuel fraction of the take-off weight and relatively higher increase in operational empty weight. To conclude, no matter what type of aircraft is chosen as a baseline, the increase in fuel volume requirement and structural weight is expected to lead to an increase in energy consumption for the cryogenically fueled concepts relative to existing Jet A-1 configurations."
16,Cost of alternative aviation fuels,"Among the reviewed literature, 26 articles include costs, and the majority (73 %) of these include cost estimations of bio-jet fuel pathways, with most of them focusing on the MJFSP for bio-jet fuels. The majority of the studies use an ‘Aspen Plus’ and ‘discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR)’ analysis for estimating the MJFSPs, while some others use ’SuperPro Designer’, ‘Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI)’, ‘Guthrie's method‘ and ‘Economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model’. The rates of return on investment cost vary between 10 % and 20 % in different publications. The assumed maturity, size or production capacity of the bio-jet fuel production plant influences the production cost and MJFSP of bio-jet fuels. Though, most of the studies aim to represent a situation with relatively mature and large-scale production of the included jet fuels. However, future cost reductions are uncertain, and costs may be reduced further. Table 2 shows the MJFSPs based on the literature review, and Fig. 4 illustrates the ranges. The ranges shown for LBG, LCH4, and LH2, included for comparison (based on data from Refs. [18,53,55,61,62], are for fuel production costs based on review studies focusing on fuel applications but are not specific to the aviation sector. The ranges for each fuel option are rather wide, mainly depending on varying feedstock and feedstock production costs. For HEFA pathways, the relatively wide range of MJFSPs (23–310 $/GJ) is due to bio-jet fuels produced from microalgae being much more expensive than other feedstocks. The reasons for this are the high investment cost for microalgae harvesting equipment and the raceway ponds as well as the relatively high operating cost [154]. The yield and oil content of feedstocks are also important for determining the production cost of jet fuel and other co-products that influence the MJFSP. In the ATJ pathway, the use of wheat grain, forestry residues, and wheat straw seem to result in lower MJFSPs than the use of lignocellulose, switchgrass, sugarcane, and herbaceous biomass (range: 4–215 $/GJ). The lignocellulosic feedstocks are generally more expensive, capital costs are higher, more conversion steps are required, and the fuel yield is lower [39,155]. It seems possible to produce ATJ at a relatively low cost compared to other bio-jet fuels due to its high thermal conversion efficiency (Fig. 4 and tblS2Table S2), but the cost increases if lignocellulosic feedstock, e.g., switchgrass, is used. For catalytic hydrothermolysis/hydrothermal liquefaction (CHJ/HTL) pathway, wheat straw and forestry residues seem to have lower MJFSPs than woody biomass (range: 31–108 $/GJ). CHJ/HTL has a relatively high conversion efficiency compared to other bio-jet fuel technologies [39]. For the HDCJ/PTJ pathway, sugarcane and forestry residues show lower MJFSPs than corn stover and wheat straw (range: 37–60 $/GJ, which is the smallest cost range of the studied bio-jet fuel pathways). For the FT pathway (with cost range of 34–82 $/GJ), willow and wheat straw seem to be cheaper options than other feedstocks, although [39] reports a higher MJFSP from wheat straw. Woody biomass and municipal solid waste result in the highest MJFSPs. The lowest MJFSP for DSHC found in the literature (104 $/GJ) is relatively high compared to the lower estimates of all other studied bio-jet fuel pathways, indicating that the DSHC pathway represents a relatively expensive jet fuel production pathway. This is largely due to the lower conversion efficiency of lignocellulosic feedstocks [39]. All studied bio-jet fuel pathways except DSHC report MJFSP estimates below 50 $/GJ. Camelina oils (HEFA), palm oil (HEFA), yellow grease (HEFA), willow (FT), wheat straws (ATJ), and forestry residues (CHJ/HTL) yield the lowest MJFSPs (Fig. 4, tblS2Table S2). As expected, MJFSPs of most bio-jet fuels are higher than the selling price of conventional jet fuel (around 18 $/GJ) [156]. One reason is that more than half of the production cost of the bio-jet fuel goes to upgrading the fuel due to the high cost of hydrotreating and hydroreforming reactors [120,157]. Other reasons are high feedstock costs for some bio-jet fuel options and high capital investments and operational costs for the bio-jet fuel production plant. Feedstock costs vary significantly across the studies, even for a single feedstock, which is mainly due to the different market economics of feedstock harvesting/production in different locations. For instance, the camelina cost ranges from 281 to 1,890 $/ton [158–160]. Similarly, reported cost ranges for sugarcane and woody biomass are 37–682 $/ton [75,154,155,161] and 72–1510 $/ton [39,120,122,125,155,162], respectively. Variation in feedstock costs is also due to the feedstock productivity (e.g., the cost of fertilizer used to harvest feedstock), lignocellulose vs crop-/vegetable-based feedstocks, and the oil content [157,161]. The production cost of electro-jet fuels (80–231 $/GJ) is higher than for most bio-jet fuel production pathways and is dependent on assumptions made for the cost for carbon capture, electrolysis, and electricity costs which are uncertain [54,89,169]. Also, the final fuel produced influences the production cost to some extent. For example, the e-methanol pathway is less expensive than the e-FT pathway [54]. Depending on the future cost reduction for e.g., electrolysers the electro-jet fuel production cost may be further reduced [54,169]. The market price of LNG (about 11 $2019/GJ [52]) is of the same order of magnitude as the lowest costs reviewed (Fig. 4). This is mainly due to the relatively low purchase price and liquefaction cost of natural gas [52,163]. The fuel selling price for LNG, as an aviation fuel, is estimated to be about 7–8 $/GJ in the near future and around 11 $/GJ in 2048 [163]. The identified fuel production cost of fossil LH2 from SMRP of natural gas (17–72 $/GJ) is lower than the MJFSP for most of the bio-jet fuel pathways but higher than for LNG (Fig. 4). LH2 production from electrolysis is more costly in current production cost estimates (52–135 $/GJ). The purchase price of H2 at the airport may be costlier due to transportation costs, estimated to range from 1.56 to 1.80 $/GJ for LH2 tanker ships, 1.68–3.11 $/GJ for pipelines, and 5.98–7.18 $/GJ for tube trailers (100 km) [164]. Different interest rates applied on loan-based investments and the shareholder structure of the total capital cost impact the MJFSP to some extent [165]. Different scales of refinery plant capacities [157,160] and the assumed operating hours per year [166] also play a role. For example, increasing the plant capacity of HEFA bio-jet fuel, from relatively small-scale, 5 times is indicated to have the potential to results in an up to 34 % drop in the MJFSP [157], while increasing operating hours per year from 75 % to 90 % for ethanol-to-jet from sugarcane decreases the MJFSP by 10 % [166]. In addition, assumptions on operating cost components such as labor cost, maintenance cost, administrative cost, water cost, hydrogen cost [165], electricity cost [161], oil upgrading catalyst loadings, catalyst cost, and operating incentives [160,167] also influence estimates of bio-jet fuel MJFSPs. The income from co-products such as naptha, biodiesel, propane, butane, A-molasses, LPG, and gasoline also have a great impact on the production cost and MJFSP of bio-jet fuels [157]. In addition, the cost estimates to some extent also vary due to the use of different calculation methods and assumptions for estimating MJFSPs [39,168]. For instance Ref. [165], considers the accuracy of the actual project cost in their calculation to be ±25 %, while [162] states the uncertainty in the capital cost may be ±30 %. However, the reported ranges are still interesting to give an overview of the cost situation for the different aviation fuels from an overall perspective."
17,Direct operating costs for various conceptual aircraft with alternative aviation fuels,"The estimated DOCs of the studied alternative aviation fuel-based aircraft and conventional (Jet A-1) aircraft for medium-range (MR) and long-range (LR) conceptual aircraft including low- and high-cost cases are shown in Fig. 5 . The DOC for bio-jet fuel (5.0–9.2 ¢/PAX/km), LNG (4.2–5.5 ¢/PAX/km), electro-methane (5.6–16.7 ¢/PAX/km), electro-jet fuel (9.2–23.7 ¢/PAX/km) renewable and fossil based liquefied hydrogen (8.1–23.9 and 5.9–10.1 ¢/PAX/km, respectively) are higher than for the conventional jet fuel (3.9–4.8 ¢/PAX/km) and liquefied natural gas (4.2–5.2 ¢/PAX/km). The DOC excluding fuel operating cost is lower per km and passenger for the LR aircraft concepts than for MR. However, fuel consumption and therefore the fuel operating cost is higher for the LR aircraft. In comparison to the fuel operating cost, the aircraft cost differs only slightly between different fuel concepts for the same range. The fuel operating cost contributes to 15 % and 26 % of total DOC in conventional jet fuel for MR and LR aircraft, respectively, and 14 % and 24 % for the LNG case. For bio-jet fuel, electro-jet fuel, LCH4, fossil-H2 and renewable-H2 based aircraft fuel operating cost represent a considerable share of the DOC for MR and LR aircraft (43 % and 59 %, 71 % and 83 %, 45 % and 71 %, 43 % and 58 %, and 69 % and 80 % respectively). Thus, for most alternative aviation fuel cases, the fuel operating cost greatly influences the DOC. The financial cost (depreciation, interest, and insurance) represents 40–45 % of the DOC for conventional jet-fuel based aircraft while 10–30 % for the renewable alternative aviation fuel cases. For financial cost, loan interest repayment is the key cost factor (representing 6–31 % of total DOC) (Fig. 5). The low cost of LNG makes the DOC for LNG aircraft concepts comparable to that for Jet A-1. However, if renewable liquefied methane is used instead, the DOC increases considerably. Following Jet A-1 and LNG, bio-jet fuel concept aircraft has the lowest DOC. Among the assessed aircraft concepts, LH2-based aircraft using renewable hydrogen and electro-jet-based aircraft are associated with the highest DOCs, almost three times those for Jet A-1 aircraft (4.8 ¢/PAX/km for MR and 3.9 ¢/PAX/km for LR) (Fig. 5), but these could be even higher if for example higher fuel costs are assumed as in the high-cost cases. The high DOC for LH2 MR aircraft is primarily driven by the high fuel cost for LH2 and high investment cost for LH2 aircraft incurred due to the high OEW; the DOC for bio-jet and electro-jet fuel-based aircraft is also driven by the fuel mass required and the high price of the fuels. In the short term bio-jet fuels is the most promising option to reduce climate impact from aviation. In the long term the limited availability of sustainable biomass resources makes electrofuels option (LCH4 and electro-jet) and LH2 interesting even if these are associated with high costs in this analysis. Renewable alternative aviation fuel-based aircraft (with the exception of bio-jet) cannot compete on cost with conventional aircraft at current or in the near future. However, a price on fossil CO2 emissions from aviation could change this. The impact of a carbon tax on conventional jet fuels is investigated in Fig. 6 . The DOC of Jet-A fuel-based aircraft is shown for different carbon tax levels and compared to the DOC of LH2- and electro-jet-based aircraft for different price levels for LH2. Without a carbon tax, the cost of LH2 needs to be lower than 20 $2019/GJ for hydrogen-based aircraft options to be competitive with conventional Jet A-1 fuel. With a carbon tax of 50 $/ton, the DOC of hydrogen-based aircraft options could be competitive with Jet A-1 aircraft for an LH2 price below 50 $2019/GJ. There are only small cost differences between LH2- and electro-jet-based aircraft in this simplified comparison with a small advantage shown for electro-jet. Also note in Fig. 6 is that the LR aircraft have a higher fuel consumption and therefore increases faster in DOC with increasing fuel cost (i.e. higher carbon tax) and decreases faster with decreasing fuel cost (i.e. lower hydrogen price) than the MR concept aircraft. Several factors introduce uncertainties in DOC calculations. Fuel costs (MJFSPs) diverge across publications (see Section 6), and MJFSPs for fuels not yet on the market are uncertain. The costs linked to new aircraft depend on technical maturity and on production scale. The cost used for new aircraft technologies in this study represents cost estimates for when the new technologies are relatively mature, and not the cost for building the first aircraft of this type. However, cost estimates for new aircraft technologies such as engines and airframe materials are uncertain. Our estimations for standard aircraft costs are based on operating empty weights of aircraft, and engine costs are based on the engine thrusts; the variables are formulated according to the historical prices of aircraft provided by Airbus and Boeing [66]. Our DOC results are in line with the results from previous studies. For instance, Deane and Pye [83] reviewed the operating cost of bio-jet fuel in the EU and found additional bio-jet fuel costs (compared to conventional fuels) estimated between 0.42 €/L (15.1 $/GJ) and 1.20 €/L (43.2 $/GJ). Nojoumi et al. [3] state that the operating cost of H2 in 2009 was much higher than for conventional jet fuel due to the lower purchase price of jet kerosene. Likewise, according to Bicer & Dincer [115], the direct operating cost of H2 is significantly higher than for conventional jet fuel. Similarly, Gibs and Nagel [96] estimate the operative cost advantage (up to 15 %) of an LNG-fueled turboprop propulsion system, which is somewhat similar to the fuel operating cost of LNG in our result. However, Rory et al. [94] estimate savings of nearly 90 % in fuel operating costs if the entire United States Air Force fleet is converted to burn LNG. This is more optimistic than our results."
18,Discussion and conclusions,"Bio-jet fuels, synthetic jet fuels, electro-jet fuels, LH2, and LCH4 all are potential future alternative aviation fuels but significant modifications to engines, fuel storage tanks, and aerodynamic systems are required in most cases. Also, electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems may be deployed in future aircraft systems, hybrid propulsions seeming more feasible in the near term. The literature review shows that there is a wide range of estimates of MJFSPs and fuel production costs for most aviation fuel production pathways studied. The studies are performed with different feedstocks and varying prices of feedstocks, for different geographical locations and markets, with different assumptions about production capacities, and with different assumptions about capital and operational costs for the fuel production plants, which results in varying fuel production costs and fuel selling prices. In many cases, the relatively large range depends on the large variety of possible feedstocks and feedstock costs. In addition, assumptions linked to co-product revenues, reactor construction, catalyst used, heat, electricity and electrolysis cost, and rate of return on capital costs lie behind the variation of MJFSPs [121,159,169]. In terms of scale, larger plants generally have lower production costs and jet fuel selling prices compared to smaller plants due to economies of scale [121]. However, cost estimates for first of a kind plant is not included in our assessment. There are, thus, many reasons for the divergence of MJFSPs, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on precise future costs, but possible cost relation ranges compared to conventional fuels can still be presented. Based on our DOC estimates for different conceptual aircraft systems, it is shown that the fuel operating cost is the main cost factor for all aircraft types except LNG-based aircraft. The larger the aircraft, the higher the fuel operating cost as well as the DOC [64]. The DOC of liquefied methane in the form of LNG is low due to the low market price of natural gas, but if the methane is produced via electrolysis (electro-methane), the DOC increases. However, the electrolysis cost is expected to be reduced in the future due to advances in electrolyzers and reductions in renewable electricity production costs [169] that not only lower the cost of electro-methane but of all fuels based on electrolysis. In the short-term, bio-jet fuels seem to be the most viable alternative fuels for the aviation sector in terms of fuel-production technology maturity, compatibility of blending bio-jet fuels in existing jet engines, and, for some bio-jet fuel options, the relatively low MJFSP. However, the literature shows mixed results for the operating costs for bio-jet fuels. Our DOC estimation for renewable aviation fuel-based aircraft concepts reaches 50 % (bio-jet fuel MR case) to 4 times (electro-jet fuel LR case) that for conventional jet fuel in the base case. If the lower range of the reviewed fuel costs for bio-jet fuels is considered, the DOC is reduced but still about 15 % higher than for conventional Jet A-1 fuel. Fuel production costs for alternative aviation fuels including bio-jet fuels may be reduced when production technologies mature, and MJFSPs are expected to decrease further. In addition, location optimization and process integration may improve the profitability of the bio-jet fuel production, by e.g., locating feedstock production, feedstock processors, and bio-jet fuel refineries close to each other. A key challenge for the HEFA pathway is the limited supply potential of feedstocks. The major feedstocks are cooking oil, animal fats, vegetable oils (e.g. camelina and canola) and waste oils. For bio-jet fuels in general the availability of sustainable feedstock and the production cost represent key challenges. Large-scale expansion of biofuels can cause several negative environmental effects such as direct and indirect land use changes, deforestation, water depletion, and loss of biodiversity and can compete with food production, highlighting the need for policies for energy, land use, water management, and use of sustainable biomass resources [170]. Besides sustainability requirements, the availability of bio-jet fuels will depend on the fuel choices made in other transport modes, primarily shipping and heavy-duty road transport [171,172]. The exclusive use of bio-jet fuels in existing aircraft fleets may be difficult to realize in the near term but may happen after advances in aircraft engines and other components of propulsion systems or reduction of costs. Hydrogen and electrofuels are interesting in a longer time perspective. Aircraft technology development as well and fuel production and new infrastructure are required. In general, the main challenges for scaling up electro-jet fuel production is the supply of large-scale sustainable CO2, renewable electricity, and green hydrogen at competitive costs. The major challenges for scaling up cryogenic alternative fuels (LH2, LCH4) include high infrastructure, storage, and liquefaction costs. As for other transport modes several parallel fuel options may be used for aviation in the future i.e., a mix of bio-jet fuels, hydrogen, and other electro-jet fuels, complemented with electric solutions for suitable distances. Another possibility, not assessed in this article, is the combined bio- and electro-jet fuel production utilizing all carbon in the biomass. This is a way to make the fuel more resource efficient [62]. The purchase price of conventional jet fuel is significantly lower than the renewable alternatives as the conventional jet fuel currently is tax free [119]. Government policies such as carbon taxes and fuel-production or operating subsidies can play a vital role in the implementation of alternative fuels in aviation [173]. For instance, aviation is included in the EU emission trading system, and the ICAO has planned to establish a global market-based mechanism for aviation carbon trading where the carbon abatement cost for aviation is higher than for other sectors [174,175]. Norway aims to introduce an annual quota system for advanced biofuels in jet fuels at 0.5 % in 2020 increasing up to 30 % by 2030, and the Swedish government has announced their intention to introduce a CO2 emission reduction obligation for jet fuels, which is suggested to start in 2021 with a potential 0.8 % reduction of CO2e/MJ and increase over the years to 27 % by 2030 [176]. Governments can also provide financial support for projects and companies exploring the development of hybrid- and all-electric aircraft propulsion systems. All renewable alternative aviation fuels can reduce GHG emissions from the aviation sector. The use of biomass for fuel implies that the carbon is re-released into the atmosphere, creating a closed carbon cycle at best, if there are no, or negligible, GHG emissions linked to the production. Emissions from electricity, hydrogen, and electrofuels largely depend on the primary fuels/energy carriers used to produce them. While it is possible to produce these energy carriers using renewable resources only and thus have near-zero lifecycle GHG emissions, this would entail a large-scale expansion of the renewable electricity systems that are already struggling with acceptance and transmission expansion issues, in several countries. At the same time, many other sectors such as steel and cement industries and road-based transport highlight electrification as an important option for reducing their emissions, increasing the future demand for electricity even more. Thus, the availability and the price of renewable electricity in the future energy system is uncertain. It is also important to note that the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions may be higher for LH2 compared to Jet A-1 fuel due to increased amount of water vapor emissions [58,149]. This needs to be further investigated and measures to reduce the non-CO2 emissions during flight is important. This study has reviewed potential alternative aviation fuels and aircraft propulsion systems focusing on economic performance and technology/fuel readiness and providing insights on production costs as well as MJFSPs and DOCs for the operation of these alternative aviation fuels in aircraft. The main conclusions are: • Bio-jet fuel is the most promising renewable aviation fuel in the near term. HEFA bio-jet fuel is the only bio-jet fuel option which is commercially ready by now. HEFA, ATJ, and CHJ/HTL bio-jet fuels are more mature and energy efficient, and their MJFSPs are also lower than those of other bio-jet fuels. Thus, these fuels can be used in the aviation sector in the near term. Feedstock options such as camelina oils, palm oil, yellow grease, willow, wheat straw, and forestry residues represent the cheapest feedstock options for bio-jet fuels. • LNG represents the alternative aviation fuel option with the lowest costs. • Renewable hydrogen and electrofuels together with electricity represent promising options in the more long-term perspective where additional cost reductions are possible. LH2, as well as LNG/LCH4, require modifications to engines (combustion chamber, turbines, engines, and fuel burners), and the aerodynamic systems of the aircraft due to low volumetric energy density, which increases the aircraft development costs for these fuels compared to other fuel options. • The estimated DOC for the studied renewable aviation fuels i.e., bio-jet, electro-jet fuel, electro-methane, and renewable liquefied hydrogen, are overall 15–500 % higher than for conventional jet fuel. • The introduction of a carbon tax on conventional jet fuels can make alternative aviation fuels competitive. The carbon tax level needed depend e.g., on the future price of conventional jet fuels, and the future production cost of renewable aviation fuels. As an example, it is indicated that a carbon tax of 50 $/tCO2 can make low cost LH2 competitive with Jet A-1."
