0,Introduction,"At present, due to the simple charge process of TNT-based melt-cast explosives, the price is cheap, and it can adapt to various shapes of drug rooms. It has good comprehensive performance and is widely used in conventional weapons. Therefore, it is the most widely used military hybrid explosive in the world [1]. But such explosives have obvious defects [2]. 2-Methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNT) is toxic to humans and cannot meet the requirements in the standard test of insensitive ammunition. In addition, it has high sensitivity and poor safety during transportation. 3,4-Dinitropyrazole (DNP, C3H2O4N4, 158.09, Fig. 1 ) is a five-membered nitrogen heterocyclic nitro compound with (4n + 2) electrons, which has certain aromaticity, and the structure contains N–N, C–N, N–O and other heights generate thermal groups to make the material have a higher energy (energy output of 8210.32 kJ·cm−3). In addition, due to high nitrogen (35.67%), high oxygen (40.67%), low carbon (22.93%) and other characteristics, the density of DNP is higher than TNP (DNP of 1.87 g·cm−3, TNT of 1.64 g·cm−3), and it is easy to reach oxygen balance (25.48%). Compared with cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and other explosives, it is a high-energy, low-melting and low-explosive explosive, which is a potential melt-cast explosive carrier and can replace TNT [3,4]. Furthermore, the single crystal structure and spatial structure have been studied [5] and the results showed that DNP was monoclinic and the space group was P21/c, with unit cell parameters of a = 9.9801(8) Å, b = 11.9959(9) Å, c = 9.7192(7) Å, β = 94.232(1) °, V = 1160.41(15) Å3, Z = 8, F (000) = 640, D c = 1.80969 g·cm−3. Due to the large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the π-π stacking interactions between the DNP molecules, the structure of DNP is very stable. The structure of DNP have been characterized [6], and the experimental values of explosion heat and explosion velocity were 4326 kJ·kg−1 and 7633 m·s−1, respectively. The solubility of solid substances in different solvents is one of the most important parameters in fundamental research, which can also show the knowledge of physical properties and optimal crystallization conditions. It can help estimate a suitable solvents ratio for maximum solubility, playing an important role in the determination of appropriate solvents for the crystallization process [7]. Moreover, many studies have focused on the synthesis of DNP [8–10], but only a few have attempted to establish purification methods to obtain products with high purity and yield. The industrial crystallization process based on the solubility data has many advantages, such as high efficiency, high yield, low energy consumption, low pollution, high product purity, etc. Furthermore, it is especially suitable for industrial fields of solid products, such as fine chemicals and biopharmaceuticals. At the same time, the study of solubility data defines the separation limit for the crystallization separation process, and provides basic data for the design of the equipment structure size and the determination of operating conditions, which is an important prerequisite for realizing chemical production. The solubility data of DNP has important research significance for the crystallization process of DNP. The solubility of DNP in four binary solvent mixtures has been determined at temperatures ranging from (283.15 to 323.15) K with a dynamic laser monitor. The solubility data was regressed with different thermodynamic models including the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, NRTL model and Wilson model. Hansen solubility parameters of DNP and mixed binary solvents were applied to investigate the dissolution behavior. Besides, the mixing thermodynamic properties of DNP in different binary solvent mixtures, including mixing enthalpy, mixing entropy and mixing Gibbs energy, were calculated and discussed by Wilson model. Additionally, the identification of DNP crystal was verified by using X-ray diffraction (XRD)."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemical materials,"2.1 Chemical materials DNP was synthesized from pyrazole by a three-step reaction of nitration, rearrangement and nitration [11], and the synthetic route is showed in Fig. 2 . It was purified by crystallization in benzene and its mass fraction purity, measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), was 0.990. All solvents used in this experiment, such as benzene, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol, were purchased from local reagent factories without further purification, and their mass fraction purity was not less than 0.990. More information of all the materials used in this experiment is presented in Table 1 ."
3,Differential scanning calorimetry,"2.2 Differential scanning calorimetry The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC 1/500, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) was used to determine the melting temperature (T m) and fusion enthalpy (Δ fus H) of DNP. The standard uncertainties of the measurement were a temperature of 0.5 K and a fusion enthalpy of 400 J·mol−1. Fig. 3 indicates that the fusion enthalpy is 11.744 kJ·mol−1 and the melting temperature is 360.98 K."
4,X-ray diffraction,"2.3 X-ray diffraction Since the solubility may change with the crystal structure, it is necessary to confirm the crystal structure before the measurement of its solubility. The DNP crystal used to measure the solubility was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Bruker D8 Advance (Bruker Corporation, Germany). The data was carried out in the range of 2θ from 5° to 80°, with a voltage of 45 kV and a scanning rate of 10°·min−1. The XRD curves of DNP in binary solvents were showed in Fig. 4 . The results showed that no polymorph transformation of DNP was identified."
5,Hansen solubility parameter,"2.4 Hansen solubility parameter The concept of Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) has been widely used for selecting suitable solvents for solute [12]. The basis of the HSP approach is to assume that the total cohesive energy (E t) of a pure compound consists of three parts, including nonpolar (dispersion) interactions (E d), polar (dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole) interactions (E p) and hydrogen bonding or other specific association interactions including Lewis acid-base interactions (E h): (1) E t = E d + E p + E h Dividing each contribution by the molar volume: (2) E t V = E d V + E p V + E h V = δ d 2 + δ p 2 + δ h 2 Therefore, the total solubility parameter (δ t) can be expressed as: (3) δ t = δ d 2 + δ p 2 + δ h 2 Where δd, δ p and δ H represent the Hansen dispersion solubility parameter, polar solubility parameter and hydrogen bonding solubility parameter, respectively. The values of δd, δ p and δ H for selected solvents can be obtained from literature [12]. The solubility parameter for binary solvents (δ mix) can be expressed as: [13] (4) δ mix = αδ 1 + 1 − α δ 2 Where α stands for the volume fraction of solvent 1 (benzene); δ 1 and δ 2 are the Hansen solubility parameters of solvent 1 (benzene) and solvent 2 (ethanol / n-propanol / n-butanol / isoamyl alcohol). The group contribution (Hoftyzer-Van Krevelen) method was used to calculate the values of δd, δ p and δ H of DNP [14]. The molar volume of DNP, Vs = 95.0 cm3·mol−1, was taken from the SciFinder database [15]. In addition, the difference of total solubility parameter between solute and solvent (Δδ t) can be used to estimate the miscibility of two compounds: [16] (5) Δ δ t = δ t 2 − δ t 1 Where δ t1 and δ t2 are total Hansen solubility parameters of solute and binary solvents, respectively."
6,Experimental procedures,"2.5 Experimental procedures In this research work, the solubility of DNP in four selected binary solvents including “benzene + ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol” at 283.15–323.15 K was investigated by laser monitoring method. The experimental approach and apparatus were similar to our previous published paper and briefly described here [17–19]. Firstly, about 50 mL binary solvent was added into a double-layer glass bottle (customized through the glasswork). The temperature of solvent was controlled by circulating water bath (type 501, Gongyi Yuhua Instrument Co., Ltd., China) with an uncertainty of 0.05 K and determined by thermometer mercury. Then, excess amount of solid was added into double-layer glass bottle at the setting temperature. A magnetic agitator was used for accelerating the dissolution rate of DNP in selected binary solvents. The mixture solution was stirred for more than 30 min. After 30 min, the selected binary solvents of known weight were added dropwise into mixture solution by a syringe with the dropping rate of 2–3 drops per minute till the last trace of DNP was dissolved in mixture solution. The mixture solution reached saturation and the electrical signal of laser monitoring arrived at its maximum at this moment. The weights of solute and solvent were weighed by an electronic analytical balance (type AB 204, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) with an accuracy of 0.0001 g. Three parallel experiments for each temperature point were performed in this work and the average values were considered the final results. The mole-fraction solubility of DNP (x 1) in binary solvents can be expressed as: (6) x 1 = m 1 / M 1 m 1 / M 1 + m 2 / M 2 + m 3 / M 3 (7) x 2 = m 2 / M 2 m 2 / M 2 + m 3 / M 3 (8) x 3 = 1 − x 2 (9) w 1 = m 2 m 2 + m 3 (10) w 2 = 1 − w 1 Where x 1 represents the solubility of DNP in binary solvents; x 2 is the mole fraction of benzene in binary mixed solvents; x 3 is the mole fraction of (ethanol / n-propanol / n-butanol / isoamyl alcohol) in binary solvents; w 1 is the mass fraction of benzene in binary solvents mixtures; w 2 is the mass fraction of (ethanol / n-propanol / n-butanol / isoamyl alcohol) in binary solvents; m 1, m 2, m 3, and M 1, M 2, M 3 represent the mass and molar mass of DNP, benzene and (ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol), respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Solubility models,"3.1 Solubility models Since (solid + liquid) equilibrium is usually not available, correlation and prediction schemes are frequently utilized. The modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, NRTL model and Wilson model are used to correlate the experimental values. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of four binary solvents is used to evaluate the fitting results of the correlation models. The RMSD is defined as: (11) RMSD = ∑ i = 1 n x i c − x i e 2 N 1 / 2 Where x e and x c denote experimental data and the calculated values, respectively, and N is the number of experimental data. 3.1.1 The modified Apelblat equation The temperature and solubility of DNP were correlated by the modified Apelblat equation [20–22]. It is simple and commonly to be written as follows: (12) ln x 1 = A + B T + C ln T Where A, B, C are the empirical constants and T is the absolute temperature. The values of A and B reflect the variation of the activity coefficient, C represents the temperature effect upon the fusion enthalpy. 3.1.2 Jouyban-Acree model The Jouyban-Acree model [23,24] is a semi-empirical thermodynamic model that it is widely used to correlate the relationship between temperature and solvent composition with the solubility. The equation can be expressed as: (13) ln x 1 = x 2 ln x 1 2 + x 3 ln x 1 3 + x 2 x 3 ∑ i = 0 2 J i x 2 − x 3 i T Where J i is the model constant. In order to extent the application of the temperature ranges where non-linear solubility behavior is observed, Jouyban et al. proposed a combination of Jouyban-Acree model and the modified Apelblat equation to correlate the solubility of a solute in binary solvent mixtures at different temperatures. According to the modified Apelblat equation, ln(x 1)2 and ln(x 1)3 can be expressed by Eqs. (14) and (15): (14) ln x 1 2 = A 2 + B 2 / T + C 2 ln T ln x 1 2 = A 2 + B 2 / T + C 2 ln T (15) ln x 1 3 = A 3 + B 3 / T + C 3 ln T Put Eqs. (14), (15) and x 3 = 1 - x 2 into Eq. (13), a new equation can be obtained: (16) ln x 1 = A 2 + B 2 / T + C 2 ln T + A 2 − A 3 x 2 + B 2 − B 3 + J 0 − J 1 + J 2 x 2 T + 3 J 1 − J 0 − 5 J 2 x 2 2 T + 8 J 2 − 2 J 1 x 2 3 T + − 4 J 2 x 2 4 T + C 2 − C 3 x 2 ln T When introducing constant term, Eq. (16) can be further simplified as Eq. (17): (17) ln x 1 = A 1 + A 2 / T + A 3 ln T + A 4 x 2 + A 5 x 2 / T + A 6 x 2 2 / T + A 7 x 2 3 / T + A 8 x 2 4 / T + A 9 x 2 ln T Where A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4, A 5, A 6, A 7, A 8 and A 9 are empirical model parameters. 3.1.3 NRTL model Based on Scott's two-liquid approach, Renon and Prausnitz's NRTL model has some similarities to Guggenheim's quasi-chemical approach [25,26]. Rather than using interaction potential energies and volume fractions, NRTL model was described by using Gibbs energies of interaction (G ij and G ii ), mole fractions and a non-randomness parameter of the molecular distribution (α ij and α ji ). The NRTL expression of g E for ternary mixture can be given by: (18) g E RT = ∑ i = 1 3 x i τ ji x j G ji ∑ l = 1 3 x l G li Where the adjustable parameters (τ ij and τ ji ) can be expressed by using the difference between energy parameter characteristics (Δg ij and Δg ji ) as: (19) τ ij = g ij − g jj RT = Δ g ij RT (20) τ ji = g ji − g ii RT = Δ g ji RT The expressions of G ij and G ji can be given by: (21) G ij = exp − α ij ⋅ τ ij (22) G ji = exp − α ji ⋅ τ ji α ij = α ji For a solute in binary solvent, the lnγ1 can be expressed as: (23) ln γ 1 = τ 21 x 2 G 21 + τ 31 x 3 G 31 x 2 G 21 + x 3 G 31 x 1 + x 2 G 21 + x 3 G 31 2 + x 2 G 12 τ 12 x 2 + τ 12 x 3 G 32 − τ 32 x 3 G 32 x 1 G 12 + x 2 + x 3 G 32 2 + x 3 G 13 τ 13 x 3 + τ 13 x 2 G 23 − τ 23 x 2 G 23 x 1 G 13 + x 2 G 23 + x 3 2 Where x 1 represents the mole fraction of DNP; x 2 and x 3 stand for the mole fraction of benzene and (ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol) in ternary mixture solution. 3.1.4 Wilson model The Wilson model based on the Flory-Huggins non-thermal mixture expression has been widely used for correlating solubility data. The expression of Wilson model for ternary mixtures could be expressed as: [27,28]. (24) g E RT = − ∑ i = 1 3 x i ln ∑ j = 1 3 x j Λ ij Where g E stands for the excess Gibbs energy; Λ ij and Λ ij are adjustable parameters of Wilson model, which can be estimated by corresponding molar volumes of pure-component (ν i and ν j ) and characteristic energy differences (Δλ ij and Δλ ji ): (25) Λ ij = v j v i exp − λ ij − λ ii RT = v j v i exp − Δ λ ij RT (26) Λ ji = v i v j exp − λ ji − λ jj RT = v i v j exp − Δ λ ji RT For ternary mixture system, activity coefficient of ln γ1 could be expressed as: (27) ln γ 1 = 1 − ln x 1 + x 2 Λ 12 + x 3 Λ 13 − x 1 x 1 + x 2 Λ 12 + x 3 Λ 13 − x 2 x 1 Λ 21 + x 2 + x 3 Λ 23 − x 3 x 1 Λ 31 + x 2 Λ 32 + x 3 Where x 1 represents the mole fraction of DNP; x 2 and x 3 stand for the mole fraction of benzene and (ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol) in ternary mixture solution."
9,Solubility data,"3.2 Solubility data The Hansen solubility parameters (δd, δ p, δ h, δ t and Δδ t) of four binary systems and DNP are listed in Table 2 . As can be seen from Table 2, values of δ t for ethanol and n-propanol are mainly contributed by δ H. However, values of δ t for benzene, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol are mainly contributed by δd. It indicates that the major forces of ethanol and n-propanol differ from theses of benzene, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol. Therefore, solubility of DNP in ethanol and n-propanol is higher than that in benzene, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol. In addition, values of ∆δ t between DNP and binary solvents (benzene + ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and isoamyl alcohol) decrease as the mass fraction of benzene decreases. For four binary solvents, the difference of δ d between mixed solvent and DNP reduces as mass fraction of benzene decreases. So the solubility of DNP increases with the decrease of mass fraction of benzene. Moreover, the values of the Hildebrand solubility parameter δ increases with decreasing the content of benzene, and the solubility of DNP also increases. The solubility data is fitted by the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, NRTL model and Wilson model, the results were listed in Table 3 . And the experimental values correlated by NRTL model are given in Figs. 5-8 . The results showed that solubility data increases with increasing temperature in all selected solvents, and as the benzene content in the mixed solvents decreases, the solubility data also increases, which suggests that cooling crystallization using the above solvents is appropriate for crystallization of DNP. At a given temperature and mass fraction of benzene, the solubility order of DNP in four binary solvents is benzene + ethanol (w 1 = 0.30) > benzene + n-propanol (w 1 = 0.26) > benzene + n-butanol (w 1 = 0.30) > benzene + isoamyl alcohol (w 1 = 0.23) in general. It can be inferred that the solubility order of DNP is ethanol > n-propanol > n-butanol > isoamyl alcohol > benzene. In addition, the polarity order of pure solvents is ethanol (65.4) > n-propanol (61.7) > n-butanol (60.2) > isoamyl alcohol (56.5) > benzene (11.1) [29], which is strictly consistent with the solubility sequence of DNP. The phenomenon can be explained by the “like dissolves like” rule [30] that the solubility of materials highly corresponds to the similarities between the solutes and the solvents. As displayed in Fig. 1, DNP is a five-membered ring structure. Because -NO2 is an electron-withdrawing group, the electron cloud density of the H atoms on N is reduced, and DNP molecule exhibits N–H hydrogen bonding donor group, meaning that a hydrogen bond can be formed between the DNP and solvent molecules, so the solubility increases with the increasing mole fraction of alcohols. Moreover, when the increasing mole fraction of benzene, the interaction of benzene and organic solvent will be weakened. Therefore, the solubility of DNP decreases with the increasing mole fraction of benzene in the determined temperature. When the temperature is changed from 283.15 K to 323.15 K, the maximum increased solubility of DNP in each mixed solvents (benzene + ethanol, benzene + n-propanol, benzene + n-butanol and benzene + isoamyl alcohol) with different mole fractions of benzene are 191.15% (w 1 = 0.86), 179.92% (w 1 = 0.88), 159.36% (w 1 = 0.90) and 79.05% (w 1 = 0.75), respectively. The calculated solubility data by these models, along with the values of 104RMSD, were presented in Tables 4-7 . It can be easily observed that for the studied binary solvent mixtures, the maximum values of 104RMSD of selected four models: the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, NRTL model and Wilson model are 64.38, 128.41, 2.17 and 120.21, respectively. In addition, the average 104RMSD within the experimental temperature range of these models are 36.07 (the modified Apelblat equation), 98.93 (Jouyban-Acree model), 0.52 (NRTL model) and 43.80 (Wilson model). Because the average 104RMSD and the maximum 104RMSD of NRTL model are the smallest in four binary mixtures of (benzene + ethanol), (benzene + n-propanol), (benzene + n-butanol) and (benzene + isoamyl alcohol) at all initial composition ranges, and R2 is close to 1, the NRTL model can better correlate the solubility data than other three models. The accuracy of the correlation is acceptable for industrial design and operation purpose. From the result, it can be concluded that, the solubility as a function of temperature is correlated well with the NRTL model as a function of solvent composition in binary solvent mixtures. The experimental solubility and correlation models in this paper can be used as basic data and applicable simulation equations in the industrial separation and purification process of DNP. The results mentioned above suggest that the experimental data provide a certain foundation for crystallization process of DNP in the future."
10,Thermodynamic properties,"For a non-ideal solution, it is necessary to study the mixing thermodynamic properties of the solute in different binary solvent mixtures, such as the mixing enthalpy, the mixing Gibbs energy and the mixing entropy. The mixing properties can be calculated by the following equations [31]. (28) Δ mix G = G E + Δ mix G id (29) Δ mix H = H E + Δ mix H id (30) Δ mix S = S E + Δ mix S id Where G E and Δ mix G id , S E and Δ mix S id , H E and Δ mix H id stand for the excess properties and mixing properties of ideal systems. The mixing thermodynamic properties of the ideal solution can be calculated by the following equations [32]. (31) Δ mix G id = RT ∑ i n x i ln x i (32) Δ mix H id = 0 (33) Δ mix S id = − R ∑ i n x i ln x i (34) G E = RT ∑ i n x i ln γ i Where x i and γ i are the mole fraction and activity coefficient of component i in real solution, respectively. i = 2 means a binary solution and i = 3 means a ternary solution. In addition, the activity coefficient can be calculated by the given Wilson model. The excess mixing properties can be calculated by the following equations [33]. (35) H E = − RT 2 ∑ i n x i ∂ ln γ i ∂ T P , x (36) S E = H E − G E T The calculated mixing thermodynamic properties in four binary solvent mixtures are given in Table 8 , in addition, these mixing thermodynamic parameters are calculated based on per mole mixture. As shown in Table 8, it can be found that the values of Δ mix G are all negative and decrease with increasing temperature, which indicates that the dissolution process of DNP in all investigated solvents is a spontaneous and favorable process [34]. The negative Δ mix H illustrates that the dissolution process in binary solvents is exothermic. The values of Δ mix S in all tested solvents are positive and increase with increasing temperature, which indicates that the mixing process is also entropy-driven [31]. In brief, these results are helpful for the optimization of the mixing and crystallization processes of DNP."
11,Conclusions,"The solubility of DNP in four binary mixed solvents like benzene + ethanol, benzene + n-propanol, benzene + n-butanol and benzene + isoamyl alcohol was investigated by laser monitoring technique in the temperature range from 283.15 K to 323.15 K under 0.1 MPa. Experimental solubility increases with increasing temperature at given solvent composition and increases with decreasing mass fraction of benzene at constant temperature. Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) were used to explain and predict the solubility behavior. If the Hildebrand solubility parameter δ of some solvent was known, the solubility of DNP in some solvent may be predicted based on solubility and selected solvents. In addition, four correlation models (i.e., the modified Apelblat equation, Jouyban-Acree model, NRTL model and Wilson model) selected in this study can all be used to fit the solubility values of DNP precisely. What's more, all of the 252 experimental values are used to correlate the parameters of NRTL model and the correlated results are superior to the other three models by comparing the average 104RMSD and R 2 . Moreover, mixing properties of DNP in selected binary solvents, including mixing enthalpy (Δ mix H), mixing entropy (Δ mix S) and mixing Gibbs energy (Δ mix G) were studied based on solubility data and Wilson model. The results show that the dissolution process of DNP in selected binary solvents is spontaneous and entropy-driven, and the mixing process in most solvents is exothermic. Furthermore, the solubility data and correlation results are worthwhile and very useful for choosing a suitable solvent for the purification process of DNP on an industrial scale and further theoretical studies."
