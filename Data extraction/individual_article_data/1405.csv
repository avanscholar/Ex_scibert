0,Introduction,"Xylanase is a hydrolytic enzyme closely related to the biodegradable hemicellulosic materials. Xylanase breaks down the β-1,4 xylan by cleaving the β-1,4-d-glycosidic linkages which yields simple sugar units [1]. Xylanase is originated both from eukaryotes such as the fungi, protozoa and plant cells and a wide range of prokaryotes such as the bacteria and algae [2]. Microbial xylanase has attracted considerable attention from various industries owing to the high specificity and mild reaction conditions [3]. Xylanase is widely applied in food industry to increase the stability and texture of the baked-good products [4]. Xylanase is also incorporated in the preparation of beverages to enhance the clarity of the beverages [5]. In agricultural industry, xylanase is supplemented in animal feeds to improve the digestibility and nutrient adsorption efficacy via the bioconversion of hemicellulose [6,7]. Furthermore, xylanase can serve as a bio-bleaching agent as the substitute to the toxic chlorinated compounds in the production of pulp and paper [8]. In view of the increasing market demands for xylanase, the alternatives for cost-effective downstream processes of xylanase are worth for deeper research. The common conventional downstream processing of xylanase such as the size exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography and electro-elution are often associated with high production costs and complication in large-scale implementation [9,10]. Additionally, the purification process of xylanase from microbial sources usually requires multi-step operation such as salt precipitation, followed by chromatographic method to achieve desired purity of enzyme. However, the recovery yield of xylanase was relatively low despite the high purification fold of xylanase attained [11–13]. Considering the above-mentioned drawbacks, liquid biphasic flotation (LBF) is suggested as a potential tool for the direct recovery of extracellular xylanase from crude feedstock in this study. LBF is a novel integration method of aqueous biphasic system (ABS) and solvent sublation (SS) technique, involving the application of gas bubbles to ease the partition of target bioproducts in the biphasic system [14,15]. LBF is usually carried out in a special designed flotation tube incorporated with sintered glass disk (G4 porosity) at the bottom and connected to the compressed air for the generation of gas bubbles (Fig. 1 ) [16]. The surface-active target bioproducts will adsorb to the surface of the air bubbles following the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of the bioproducts, and gas bubbles will drive the migration of target bioproducts to the LBF top phase by overcoming the interfacial tension for an effective separation of target biomolecules [17,18]. LBF overcomes the industrial demands for simple, minimal operation cost and high productivity technique by combining the advantages of ABS and SS for the downstream processing of target bioproducts [19]. Additionally, high concentration coefficient and high separation efficiency of target bioproducts could be achieved with the aid of gas bubbles in the biphasic system [16,17]. LBF features high scalability and capability for continuous operation, making it applicable for industrial implementation of the downstream processes. Bacillus subtilis is a potential xylanase producer which can utilize the agro-industrial wastes as substrates for xylanase fermentation with the aim of lowering the production cost and minimizing the environmental impacts. In view of the wide availability and rich organic components content of sugarcane bagasse, sugarcane bagasse is employed in this study for xylanase fermentation by B. subtilis [1]. In this study, the recovery and purification of Bacillus subtilis xylanase from crude feedstock using an alcohol/ salt LBF was attempted via the optimization of several factors: types of phase-forming components; phase composition; concentration of crude feedstock load; and floatation time of LBF. Alcohol/salt LBF is regarded as an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach owing to the low price and recyclability of phase-forming components [20]. Additionally, previous studies revealed that organic solvents such as ethanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol could preserve and improve the stability and activity of various enzymes [21]."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Difco™ nutrient broth was sourced from BD (Franklin Lake, USA). Ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), potassium di-hydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), di-potassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4) and tri-sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7) were supplied by R&M Chemicals (Selangor, Malaysia). Bradford reagent, ethanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All the chemicals used were of analytical grade."
3,Cultivation of Bacillus subtilis for xylanase fermentation,"2.2 Cultivation of Bacillus subtilis for xylanase fermentation The cultivation of B. subtilis was done by transferring 10 % (v/v) of bacterial glycerol stock into 500 mL conical flask containing 90 mL of nutrient broth. The inoculum was incubated at 37 °C with agitation speed of 150 rpm [1]. After 24 h, the 10 % (v/v) of inoculum was inoculated into the fermentation medium with formulation as described by [20], followed by incubation at 37 °C with agitation speed of 150 rpm for 48 h. The fermentation broth was collected, and the crude xylanase was obtained by centrifugation at 8000 xg at 4 °C for 10 min. The crude xylanase was then stored at 4 °C for subsequent experiments [20]."
4,LBF partitioning experiment,"2.3 LBF partitioning experiment LBF partitioning experiment was carried out in a flotation tube at room temperature. Appropriate amounts of alcohol, salt stock solution, crude feedstock and diluent were added into a 50 mL falcon tube for formation of biphasic system of 25 g. The mixture was transferred into the flotation tube and the mouth of the flotation tube was covered with an aluminum foil to prevent the evaporation of alcohol. LBF was performed at a flow rate of 30 mL/min with 15 min of flotation time unless otherwise stated. The volume of both phases of LBF were measured and the phase samples were collected separately from each phase for the determination of xylanase enzyme activity and total protein concentration [15,16]."
5,Xylanase enzyme activity assay,"2.4 Xylanase enzyme activity assay Xylanase activity was determined based on [1], as described with modification. Briefly, a total of 0.5 mL of enzyme-containing phase sample was mixed with 0.5 mL of 1% (w/v) solubilized birchwood xylan diluted in 0.05 M citrate buffer at pH 5.0. The resultant mixture was incubated for 15 min at 50 °C, followed by the addition of 1.5 mL of 3, 5- dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent. After boiled for 10 min and cooled down at room temperature, the absorbance was assessed at a wavelength of 550 nm using a microtitre plate reader (ELx800, Bioteck Instrument, USA) [20]. One unit of xylanase activity was described as the amount of xylanase needed to produce 1 μmole of xylose equivalent per minute under the above assay conditions."
6,Bradford protein assay,"2.5 Bradford protein assay Bradford protein assay was performed for the quantification of total protein concentration in phase samples [22]. A 20 μL of enzyme-containing phase sample was mixed with 200 μL of Bradford reagent in a microtitre plate, followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm against the reagent blank, which contained appropriate diluted phase solution without any protein sample. The total protein concentration in phase sample was determined by referring to the standard curve constructed using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard."

(1): (1) K e = Xylanase activity in top phase ( A T ) Xylanase activity in bottom phase ( A B ) The ratio of the total protein concentration in the top phase to the bottom phase was denoted by the partition coefficient of total protein (Kp) according to Eq.

K e ) where VR is the ratio of the volume of top phase to the volume of the bottom phase.
8,Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis,"2.7 Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis B. subtilis crude feedstock and phase samples collected from the LBF were precipitated and concentrated using 100 % (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution. The polyacrylamide gel composed of 4 % stacking gel and 12 % resolving gel was prepared. SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out using the ATTO electrophoresis unit (Tokyo, Japan) at a voltage of 90 V for 15 min, followed by 120 V for 2 h at room temperature. The polyacrylamide gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 staining solution, followed by de-staining process to visualize the protein bands on the polyacrylamide gel [23]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of types of phase-forming components on the recovery of xylanase,"3.1 Effect of types of phase-forming components on the recovery of xylanase Various types of alcohol (ethanol, 1-propanol and 2 propanol) and inorganic salts (sulfate, phosphate and citrate) were employed as phase-forming components for the formation of alcohol/salt LBF. Table 1 illustrates the effect of types of alcohol and salt on the Ke and YT of xylanase in LBF. Based on Table 1, the 2-propanol/sulfate LBF resulted in the greatest recovery efficiency of xylanase with Ke of 5.29 ± 0.07 and YT of 69.47 % ± 0.30 recorded. The recovery efficiency of xylanase in alcohol/salt LBF was decreased in the order of 2-propanol > 1-propanol > ethanol. Increase of alkyl chain length of alcohol enhances the phase-forming ability and the hydrophobic interaction between the target enzyme and alcohol molecules [24]. Propanol made up of longer alkyl chain length exhibits relatively greater hydrophobicity than ethanol, while 1-propanol exhibits greater hydrophobicity than 2-propanol due to the differential position of hydroxyl group [21]. However, the greatest recovery efficiency of xylanase was demonstrated in LBF composed of 2-propanol instead of 1-propanol. This phenomenon could be due to the high interfacial tension in the biphasic system as a consequence to the exponential increase of hydrophobicity in 1-propanol-rich top phase [25]. Hence, the gas bubbles are difficult to traverse through the phase interface, leading to the redissolution of gas bubbles in the salt-rich bottom phase [26]. In 2-propanol-based LBF, the Ke greater than 1 (Ke > 1) was obtained in the LBF with sulfate-rich and phosphate-rich bottom phase indicating the preferentially migration of xylanase to the alcohol-rich top phase. On the other hand, xylanase was partitioned to the salt-rich bottom phase in LBF composed of citrate with Ke below 1 (Ke < 1) obtained. According to the Hofmeister series, sulfate ions is a strong kosmotropic salt which decreases the availability of free water molecules to hydrate alcohols via the formation of strongly bound hydration shell, thereby enhances the hydrophobicity of alcohols and the salting-out ability of salt [26,27]. In this way, more of the xylanase was excluded to the alcohol-rich top phase owing to the high salting-out effects and the high hydrophobicity of alcohol-rich top phase. Therefore, the 2-propanol/sulfate LBF was identified as the ideal system for the recovery and purification of xylanase in alcohol-rich top phase."
11,Effect of phase composition on the recovery of xylanase,"3.2 Effect of phase composition on the recovery of xylanase The effect of concentration of 2-propanol and sulfate on the recovery performance of xylanase in LBF was studied by differing the concentration of 2-propanol from 16 % (w/w) to 28 % (w/w) and concentration of sulfate from 20 % (w/w) to 26 % (w/w). The Ke, S and YT of xylanase in alcohol-rich top phase are showed in Table 2 . The salt concentration possessed significant effect on the recovery of xylanase in LBF. For instance, when the concentration of 2-propanol was fixed at 18 % (w/w), the recovery efficiency of xylanase was notably improved with the increase of salt concentration from 20 % (w/w) (Ke = 5.07 ± 0.38, S of 8.85 ± 0.81 and YT of 68.53 % ± 1.61) to 24 % (w/w) (Ke = 10.54 ± 0.79, S of 24.87 ± 2.74 and YT of 82.23 % ± 1.14). Increase of salt concentration strengthens the salt salting-out ability which promotes the migration of target bioproducts towards the alcohol-rich top phase [20,28]. However, extreme high salt concentration exhibited adverse effect on the recovery performance of xylanase. In LBF comprised of 20 % (w/w) 2-propanol, increase of salt concentration from 20 % (w/w) to 26 % (w/w) decreased the recovery efficiency of xylanase. This could be due to the high viscosity of salt solution which hinders the transfer of xylanase to the air-water interface of rising gas bubble, thereby lowers the sublation efficiency of xylanase to the alcohol-rich top phase [26]. Furthermore, extreme high concentration of salt may affect the enzyme stability and result in the denaturation of enzyme [29]. Other than that, increase of alcohol concentration corresponded to the recovery efficiency of xylanase in LBF due to the greater hydrophobicity of alcohol-rich top phase. For instance, the Ke and YT of xylanase in the LBF with salt concentration of 22 % (w/w) was gradually improved with the increase of 2-propanol concentration from 22 % (w/w) (Ke = 7.53 ± 0.57 and YT of 81.33 % ± 1.18) to 26 % (w/w) (Ke = 11.39 ± 0.90 and YT of 89.49 % ± 0.77). Higher 2-propanol concentration increases the availability of free space in the alcohol-rich top phase for the accommodation of target bioproducts, thus improved the recovery efficiency of xylanase [30]. The greatest recovery efficiency of xylanase was achieved in the LBF comprised of 28 % (w/w) 2-propanol and 22 % (w/w) sulfate salt with Ke of 12.76 ± 0.08, S of 19.94 ± 0.39 and YT of 91.46 % ± 0.05. The sulfate salt concentration above 22 % (w/w) was not studied due to the occurrence of salt precipitation. Therefore, LBF with phase composition of 28 % (w/w) 2-propanol and 22 % (w/w) sulfate were chosen for subsequent optimization experiment."
12,Effect of crude feedstock load on the recovery of xylanase,"3.3 Effect of crude feedstock load on the recovery of xylanase Increase of crude feedstock load enhances the recovery performance of target biomolecules due to the greater amount of target biomolecules loaded into the biphasic system, allowing more of the target biomolecules to adsorb on the surface of gas bubbles and transfer to the alcohol-rich top phase [15,31]. The effect of concentration of crude feedstock load ranging from 10 % (w/w) to 25 % (w/w) on the recovery of xylanase in 2-propanol/sulfate LBF was investigated. Based on Fig. 2 , LBF loaded with 10 % (w/w) crude feedstock was the optimum system for the recovery and purification of xylanase. Highest Ke of 12.95 ± 0.16, S of 25.44 ± 0.32 and YT of 89.80 % ± 0.11 were recorded, indicating the maximum capacity of the 2-propanol/salt LBF was only 10 % (w/w) crude feedstock. Further increment of crude feedstock load was unfavorable for the recovery of xylanase in LBF as the recovery efficiency was significantly decreased with the further increase of crude feedstock load. For instance, low Ke (4.81 ± 0.08), S (8.5 ± 0.47) and YT (78.29 % ± 0.31) of xylanase were obtained when 15 % (w/w) crude feedstock was added into the LBF. Increase of crude feedstock load changes the phase composition which reduces the VR of biphasic system, hence the availability of free volume for xylanase in the alcohol-rich top phase was decreased [16]. Furthermore, greater concentration of crude feedstock load often corresponds to greater content of unwanted impurities in the crude feedstock [32]. Interphase precipitation was observed with the increase of crude feedstock load to 25 % (w/w) because the solubility limit of xylanase in alcohol-rich top phase was exceeded, thereby resulted in low recovery efficiency of xylanase (Ke = 2.62 ± 0.08, S = 3.86 ± 0.15, YT = 71.30 % ± 0.62) [33]."
13,Effect of flotation time on the recovery of xylanase,"3.4 Effect of flotation time on the recovery of xylanase Different flotation time varies the duration allowing for the gas bubbles to transfer the target biomolecules to the alcohol-rich top phase and affects the air-water interface area per unit volume of aqueous solution in time, thereby affecting the migration of target biomolecules across the interface to the alcohol-rich top phase [34]. The flotation time of LBF ranging from 10 to 25 min on the recovery of xylanase was studied and illustrated in Fig. 3 . The Ke, S and YT of xylanase were enhanced with the increase of flotation time from 10 min (Ke = 4.70 ± 0.31, S = 25.93 ± 2.03, YT = 76.11 % ± 1.21) to 15 min (Ke = 5.48 ± 0.08, S = 27.44 ± 2.04, YT = 78.82 % ± 0.25). Longer flotation time allows more target biomolecules to come in contact with the ascending gas bubbles and provides sufficient time for the migration of more target bioproducts to the alcohol-rich top phase, hence increases the sublation efficient of target biomolecules [15,35]. The greatest recovery efficiency of xylanase was attained with 20 min of flotation time in 2-propanol/sulfate LBF with highest Ke of 13.29 ± 0.14 and YT of 90.03 % ± 0.10 recorded, suggesting that the effective sublation of xylanase to alcohol-rich top phase was achieved. However, the recovery efficiency of xylanase was notably decreased as the flotation time was further extended to 25 min with low Ke of 53.60 ± 0.20, S of 24.24 ± 0.70 and YT of 70.97 % ± 1.11 obtained. Prolonged flotation time promotes the migration of water molecules to the alcohol-rich top phase which greatly reduced the hydrophobicity of alcohol-rich top phase, resulting in poor recovery efficiency of xylanase [14,36]. Moreover, longer flotation time increases the duration of target bioproducts to expose to the phase interface, hence decreases the recovery of xylanase in the alcohol-rich top phase as a result from the high interfacial tension in biphasic system [14,15]."
14,SDS-PAGE analysis of xylanase recovered from the 2-propanol/ sulfate LBF,"3.5 SDS-PAGE analysis of xylanase recovered from the 2-propanol/ sulfate LBF The purity of xylanase recovered in alcohol-rich top phase from the optimized LBF was evaluated using SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4 ). Based on the SDS-PAGE profile, lane M were the standard protein marker with molecular weight ranged from 10 kDa to 245 kDa, lane 1 was the B. subtilis crude feedstock and lane 2 was the top phase sample of LBF. Multiple clear bands were exhibited in Lane 1, indicating the presence of xylanase and other extracellular proteins in the crude feedstock. The general molecular weight of xylanase synthesized by Bacillus sp. falls in the range of 32−45 kDa [37]. In agreement with this fact, the realization of the primary capture of xylanase from B. subtilis crude feedstock using the alcohol/salt LBF was confirmed by the presence of a clear and distinct band in Lane 2 with a molecular weight between 35–45 kDa. This is in accordance with the molecular weight of B. subtilis xylanase reported by [20] whereby the xylanase has a molecular weight of 37 kDa. Therefore, the proposed alcohol/salt LBF is suggested as an effective tool for the recovery and purification of B. subtilis xylanase from crude feedstock."
15,Conclusions,"The single-step recovery and purification of B. subtilis xylanase from crude feedstock was successfully demonstrated in alcohol/salt LBF. Highest recovery efficiency (Ke of 13.29 ± 0.14 and S of 24.71 ± 0.96) was attained in the LBF comprised of 28 % (w/w) 2-propanol, 22 %(w/w) ammonium sulfate and 10 % (w/w) B. subtilis crude feedstock load. A high YT of 90.03 % ± 0.10 was achieved in the alcohol-rich top phase of 2-propanol/sulfate LBF with flotation time of 20 min. The findings prove that alcohol/salt LBF could be served as a cost-effective and sustainable recovery tool for the large-scale production of highly purified xylanase with desired yield owing to the high recovery efficiency and low processing time."
