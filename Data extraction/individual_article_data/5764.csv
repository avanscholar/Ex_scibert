0,Introduction,"Sequencing batch reactor (SBR), either aerobic or anaerobic, is generally reputed for more biomass retention. The inherent capacity to compensate for variable loading conditions in biological systems for wastewater treatment is limited by a relatively slow adaptation of the mass of active bacteria in the system. SBR processes offer distinct advantages when compared with continuous processes, including a high degree of process flexibility and no requirement for a separate clarifier. In SBR, feed injection, reaction, settling, and decanting occur in a reactor sequentially. SBR can decouple SRT from HRT and maintain higher biomass concentration than continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). As settling, liquid/solid separation, happens in SBR itself, a separate clarifier is not needed. The reactor configuration is also suitable for treating organic solid waste, unlike other high-rate configurations, such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. With its intrinsic flexibility, the modern SBR enjoys a gradually widening application, and is subject to extensive research to better comprehend and exploit the advantages it offers. The perplexing abundance of possible design choices in the SBR makes it an important task to develop a unified design basis [1–3]. An ASBR (anaerobic sequencing batch reactor) process is one of the novel and promising high-rate anaerobic processes and has been used for treating organic wastewaters [4,5]. Although ASBR was extensively explored in methane production [1,2,6,7], yet there is limited literature on ASBR producing hydrogen. Lin and Jo [8] showed the effect of various HRTs in hydrogen-producing ASBR using sucrose as a substrate in a continuous mode. Maximum hydrogen yield of 2.6mol H2/mol sucroseadded in the experiment was comparable to values obtained from CSTR fermenters using glucose as a substrate [9]. However, experimental conditions such as feedstock, pH, substrate concentration, etc., were somehow different. According to Benemann [10], the most promising method is to produce biohydrogen from low cost substrates using anaerobic fermentation. Much of the waste is carried in water and is a product of food processing usually having high COD values. However, most low cost organic waste products are complex substrates and information on their conversion to hydrogen in continuous processes, whether by defined cultures or mixed microflora, is very limited [11]. Starch is an important biopolymer in foods [12] and the most abundant storage reserve carbohydrate in plants. By far the largest source of starch is corn (maize) with other commonly used sources being wheat, potato, tapioca and rice [13]. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to analyze and explore the potential feasibility of ASBR in continuous biohydrogen production using biopolymer such as corn starch as a substrate. Effect of various HRTs on the performance of ASBR, with non-continuous operation mode, producing H2 was also analyzed."
1,Materials and methods,A lab-scale experimental setup was organized to examine the performance feasibility of ASBR to produce continuous hydrogen under various HRTs. Following material and methods were employed during the study.
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester in Daejeon Municipal wastewater treatment plant and heat-treated at 90°C for 10min to inhibit the methane-producing bacteria activity [14,15]. The digester was operated at a temperature of 35°C and an HRT of 25 days by feeding a mixture (1.5–2.0% VS) of primary sludge and waste activated sludge. The pH, alkalinity and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 7.5, 1150mg/L as CaCO3 and 13,500mg/L, respectively."
3,Substrate,"2.2 Substrate The seed sludge was acclimated with starch (20g COD/L). Concentrations of NH4Cl, KH2PO4, and FeCl2·4H2O were added for COD:N:P:Fe ratio of 100:5:1:0.33 [16]. Feed also contained the following nutrients (in mg/L): peptone 1000; NaHCO3 1000; MgCl2·6H2O 100; CaCl2·2H2O 75; Na2MoO4·4H2O 0.01; H3BO3 0.05; MnCl2·4H2O 0.5; ZnCl2 0.05; CuCl2 0.03; NiCl2·6H2O 0.05; CoCl2·2H2O 0.5; Na2SeO3 0.05 [17,18]."
4,Experimental setup and conditions,"2.3 Experimental setup and conditions Fig. 1 schematically describes the lab-scale ASBR with a working volume of 3L. The pH was maintained at 5.3 using a pH controller [17,19]. The stirring rate was 100rpm [20] and the temperature was kept at 35°C. The initial organic loading rate was 26.7g/Ld, which corresponded to 18h HRT. The loading rate was increased stepwise by reducing HRT from 18 to 15, 12, 9, 6 and 4h. At each HRT, the reactor was operated over ample time to allow steady-state conditions. Table 1 represents the experimental loading conditions in the system at various HRTs. Reactor was initially operated as a CSTR for 33 days and converted to batch type (ASBR) after steady-state conditions had been obtained. Steady-state conditions were established when the variation in the product concentrations was constant (gas production rate ±5%, effluent COD concentrations ±10%)."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Biogas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Gow-Mac series 580) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two columns. The contents of methane and carbon dioxide were determined using a 1.83m×3.18mm (inside diameter) stainless-steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh). Hydrogen content was measured with a 1.83m×3.18mm (inside diameter) stainless-steel column packed with molecular sieve 5A. The operational temperatures of injector, detector and column were kept at 80, 90 and 50°C, respectively. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 40ml/min. The concentrations of individual volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (LC, SpectraSYSTEM P2000) equipped with an ultraviolet (210nm) detector and a 300m×7.8mm Aminex HPX-97H column after pretreatment with a 0.45μm membrane filter. Sulfuric acid of 0.005M was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6ml/min. Alcohols were determined by a high-performance LC (DX-600 Bio-LC system) equipped with an ED 50A electrochemical detector and a 250m×4mm CarboPac PA10 column after pretreatment with a 0.45μm membrane filter. Deionized water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6ml/min. The parameters such as COD, VSS and pH of the samples were measured according to Standard Methods [21]. Glucose concentration was determined by the colorimetric method of Dubois et al. [22]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Feasibility of continuous H2 production in ASBR with varying HRTs,"3.1 Feasibility of continuous H2 production in ASBR with varying HRTs ASBR was found inefficient in continuous H2 production with varying HRTs as shown in Fig. 2 provided that no artificial control had been employed in the system. The following figure illustrates that there was a slight increase in H2 yield when HRT decreased from 18 to 15h. But when HRT further decreased from 15 to 12h, H2 yield as low as 0.28mol H2/mol glucoseadded was observed. Reason for the poor performance of ASBR in continuous operation with varying HRTs was investigated. As for SBR, mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) concentration plays an important role. Solid retention time (SRT) in SBR can be calculated as follows: (1) SRT = ( MLVSS concentration in react phase / MLVSS concentration in decant phase ) × HRT Since, MLVSS concentration in decant phase remains almost the same at all observed HRTs. So, major factor which affects the SRT is the MLVSS concentration in the react phase. When the reactor was shifted from HRT of 18 to 15h, the SRT shifted from 35 to 108h, respectively. Also, introduction of new MLVSS concentration in the system shifted from 100% to 78%. At this HRT, there was still sufficient capacity for new microorganisms in the system to bring about population shift of hydrogen-producing bacteria, that lead the change in hydrogen production as shown in Fig. 2. But when HRT further decreased from 15 to 12h, the SRT shifted from 108 to 120h. Introduction of new MLVSS concentration in the system shifted from 78% to 11%. Consequently, there was little or no introduction of new biomass concentration in the system. So, the system collapsed. So, it can be concluded that continuous biohydrogen production in ASBR is inefficient with varying HRTs. Also, it can be concluded that varying HRTs in the operational ASBR producing H2 might result in the process failure."
8,Effect of HRT in ASBR producing H2,"3.2 Effect of HRT in ASBR producing H2 For the unbiased analysis of the effect of HRTs on hydrogen production in ASBR, the reactor was shifted into CSTR mode after each HRT till the MLVSS and H2 yield became equal to as that measured before in CSTR [23]. It is then shifted to ASBR mode for biomass retention at new HRT. Research emphasis was shifted from the continuous H2 production in ASBR with varying HRTs to explore the effect of various HRTs in ASBR producing H2 with non-continuous operation mode. It was observed that the variation in HRT affected metabolic products and microbial population, which led to variation in operating parameters such as H2 yield, H2 composition, H2 production rate (HPR) and specific H2 production rate (SHPR) in H2 fermentation. Table 2 shows that H2 yield increased from 0.28mol H2/mol hexoseadded to 0.48mol H2/mol hexoseadded, when the HRT was adjusted from 18 to 15h. Highest H2 yield of 0.51 (mol H2/mol hexoseadded) was observed, at 12h HRT, which was found less when compared with CSTR. Highest H2 yield of 0.92 (mol H2/mol hexoseadded) was observed in CSTR at the same HRT, using the same substrate under similar environmental conditions [23]. Effect of stratification in settling phase, which results in decanting of non-settleable sludge with more specific H2 activity and long settling time, was found to be the main reasons of low yield in hydrogen-producing ASBR [24]. When the HRT was further adjusted to 9, 6 and 4h, a decreasing trend of H2 yield was observed. Specific hydrogen production rate remained almost unchanged at the HRTs of 18, 15, 12 and 9h. No change in specific hydrogen production rate refers to the increase in SRT with the decrease in HRT. However, specific hydrogen production rate at 6h HRT was found almost doubled than the above-mentioned HRTs. This high specific hydrogen production rate shows that the microorganisms resulted at this HRT were more efficient in producing hydrogen. Washout of microorganisms took place when HRT decreased from 4 to 3h. Performance of the reactor at various HRTs can be best described with the help of organic acid concentrations shown in Table 3 . Butyrate concentration was found unnoticeably varying at HRTs of 15, 12, 9 and 6h. However, propionate concentration was observed to be the primary varying factor at various HRTs. Propionate concentration decreased noticeably, when the HRT decreased from 18 to 15h and further to 12h. It sharply increased at lower HRTs of 9, 6 and 4h. The cause of varying propionate production is more likely that bacteria grow in the ASBR that are different at different HRTs. Propionate is a H2 consumer so its increment at various HRTs would be affecting in less H2 yield. Highest hydrogen yield at 12h HRT was found accompanied with high butyrate concentration and low propionate concentration. Highest butyrate to propionate ratio (B/P), i.e., 40.5 at 12h HRT, was found to be very high as compared to other HRTs. Vavilin et al. [25] state that the limiting substrate for butyrate production was glucose, while the limiting substrate for propionate production was H2, and the two groups of organisms producing these end products were in balance in the microbial consortium producing H2. In another experiment, using activated sludge inocula and continuous operation on a glucose–mineral salts medium at HRT from 14 to 6h at pH 5.5 or 6.0, Cohen et al. [26] showed a linear inverse relationship between propionate and butyrate formation, and a linear positive correlation between butyrate and H2 production. Thus, high butyrate and low propionate concentration might be the reason of microbial shift and affects in high H2 production at 12h HRT. Unlike CSTR, where butyrate to acetate (B/A) ratio played a significant role [23], B/P ratio was found to be the most governing factor in hydrogen-producing ASBR. Lactate concentration was found significant at short retention times, i.e., 9, 6 and 4h. Table 4 shows the COD balance in ASBR for H2 production at various HRTs. Substrate concentration was 20g COD/L. The major portion of the substrate was consumed in producing VFAs as shown in the table. At 9h HRT, almost 3 quarters of substrate was utilized in producing VFAs. The maximum butyrate concentration was also observed at this HRT as shown in Table 3. However, high concentrations of acetate and propionate producing bacteria at the same HRT mitigate the effect of butyrate producing bacteria in generating highest hydrogen yield at the HRT. Percentage of substrate concentration converted into biomass was found significant at 15 and 12h HRT. High hydrogen yield at these HRTs affirms that introduction of new considerable biomass into the system by the substrate is favorable for hydrogen-producing ASBR. The introduction of new considerable biomass might also have brought about microbial and population shifts favoring hydrogen production at these HRTs. Alcohol concentration was found noticeably higher at 18, 6 and 4h HRT. Unlike CSTR, in which starch removal efficiency decreased with the decrease in HRT [23], ASBR was found quite efficient in starch removal. Starch concentration in the effluent was found almost 6% as shown in the table. It means that starch removal efficiency was almost 94%. This property of ASBR tempts its usage in the industrial biodegradable wastewaters with high COD values, where to remove high COD is of primary concern rather than to produce alternate fuel energy efficiently. Acetate production in anaerobic systems has been thought favorable in the metabolic pathway for H2 production [16], however, a portion of acetate concentration is regenerated by utilizing H2, which is the required end product [27]. Homoacetogenism had been predicted in many H2-producing systems [11,28,29]. The quantity of H2-consuming acetate production of the total acetate was also evaluated in CSTR [23]. Estimation modeling to quantify homoacetogenism, at various HRTs, was also carried out to explore its effect on hydrogen-producing systems using Arooj et al.'s [23] model to quantify homoacetogenism. Table 5 shows the quantity of H2-consuming acetate production at various HRTs. Homoacetogenism was found to play an important role in limiting H2 production in ASBR at various HRTs. Hydrogen-consuming acetate production was estimated as almost 40±5% of the total acetate production at 18, 15, 12, 9 and 4h HRT. Hydrogen-consuming acetate production was mostly significant at 6h HRT. Such a high H2-consuming acetate production revealed that acetate concentration, as a whole, did not contribute positive role in H2 activity. H2-consuming acetate was almost equal to H2-producing acetate, indicating that acetate producing shift did not contribute in producing hydrogen."
9,Conclusions,"The work demonstrated that continuous biohydrogen production in ASBR with varying HRTs, from corn starch by a mixed culture, was inefficient. For efficient hydrogen production, reactor had to be shifted into CSTR mode after each HRT before it could be shifted back to ASBR mode. In the second part of the paper, it was concluded that HRT affects the performance of the ASBR converting biopolymer, i.e., corn starch into hydrogen. Acetogenic and propionic metabolism, inferred from a rise in acetate and propane levels and no increase in H2 yield, was observed in the experiment with varying HRTs. B/P ratio was concluded to be the most important factor affecting hydrogen yield. Maximum H2 yield of 0.51mol H2/mol glucoseadded was witnessed at 12h HRT. Highest H2 yield at 12h HRT was found accompanied with high butyrate concentration and low propionate concentration. Propionate concentration decreased noticeably, when the HRT was adjusted from 18 to 15h and further to 12h. It sharply increased at lower HRTs of 9, 6 and 4h resulting in lower H2 yield. Lactate concentration was found significant at short retention times, i.e., 9, 6 and 4h. No change in specific hydrogen production rate at the HRTs of 18, 15, 12 and 9h refers to the increase in SRT with the decrease in HRT. The introduction of new considerable biomass might also have brought about microbial and population shifts favoring H2 production at these HRTs. Specific hydrogen production rate at 6h HRT was found almost doubled than the above-mentioned HRTs showing suitable microbial and population shifts favoring H2 production at the HRT. ASBR was found quite efficient in starch removal almost at each HRT. Starch removal efficiency was almost 94%. Estimation modeling to quantify homoacetogenism revealed that H2-consuming acetate was almost 45% of the total acetate production at 18, 15, 12, 9 and 4h HRT. Homoacetogenism was found significant at 6h HRT."
