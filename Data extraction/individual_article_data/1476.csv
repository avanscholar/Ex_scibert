0,Introduction,"Due to the important role as the feedstock for chemical productions, fuel for transportation, and H2 source for direct fuel cells, methanol synthesis has received both scientific and industrial interest [1]. Methanol (CH3OH) is the simplest alcohol, consisting of one carbon, one oxygen, and four hydrogen atoms. Global methanol production has increased annually and the demand is still rising. Methanol production can be achieved by using the syngas as the feedstock which is produced by reforming reaction from fossil fuel or renewable sources [2–4]. Today, more than 80% of the methanol produced worldwide is obtained from natural gas [5]. To resolve the environmental problem due to massive fossil fuel usage, the search for new and more sustainable alternatives as energy resources becomes an important issue. In this sense, biomass is considered as one of the promising choices for the replacement of conventional fossil fuels due to its carbon neutrality [6]. Among biomass, biogas is an attractive renewable carbon source because it is considered as a true carbon-negative from both economic and environmental points of view [7,8]. Biogas is generally produced by anaerobic digestion of organic waste and mainly contains CH4 and CO2 with minor quantities of N2, O2, H2S, and aromatic compounds [9–11]. In addition to producing electricity by combustion, a promising alternative for using biogas is the production of syngas by reforming processes [12–14]. Because biogas contains CH4, the traditional reforming reaction for syngas production, such as dry reforming of methane (DRM) [15], steam methane reforming (SMR) [16], and partial oxidation of methane (POM) [17], can be used for syngas production from biogas. In the study by Ghosh et al. [18], methanol production from a large-scale biogas plant was studied. The biogas was upgraded to biomethane by removing CO2 from the biogas and syngas was produced through steam reforming. In the study by dos Santos et al. [19], a design of a methanol synthesis process using four different biogases as feedstock was proposed. It was consisting of dry reforming of biogas feed and conversion of the produced syngas to methanol. The optimization study was also performed for maximizing the methanol production. In the study by Vita et al. [20], a comparative thermodynamic and energetic analysis of the biogas reforming process was studied by Gibbs free energy minimization method. Their simulations suggested that the steam reforming of biogas with high methane content is the most appropriate route to produce a syngas quality suitable for their methanol synthesis model. In the study by Kiss et al. [21], an efficient process for methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation using wet hydrogen by-product from chlor-alkali production was proposed. In this process, a stripping unit was used to avoid the negative impact of water formation on the equilibrium conversion. In the study by Leonzio et al. [22], the methanol production from CO2 based on the so-called “Power-to-Fuel” concept by using three novel reactors was analyzed. Their results indicated that the recycling of unconverted gases ensures high CO2 conversion. In methanol synthesis using syngas as feedstock, CO hydrogenation, CO2 hydrogenation, and water gas shift reactions are involved. Based on the stoichiometric reactions of methanol synthesis, the syngas composition is one of the important factors that affect the methanol yield. In the study by Skrzypek et al. [23], it was pointed out that the product composition and feedstock conversion resulted under equilibrium reaction were strongly influenced by the initial composition of the feed. In the study by Iyer et al. [24], a thermodynamic equilibrium model was used to analyze the effect of feed composition on the methanol synthesis performance for isothermal and adiabatic operation under single- and two-phase conditions. For isothermal and single-phase conditions, they found that CO conversion increased with an increase in CO/H2 ratio and decreased with an increase in CO2/H2 ratio. For adiabatic operation, they found the reactor outlet temperature was higher than the inlet temperature and it increased with an increase in CO/H2 ratio. Methanol synthesis from syngas is a well-known catalytic process [25]. In the literature, the optimum design of various types of methanol synthesis reactors has been reported [26,27]. In addition to conventional fixed-bed reactors, membrane reactors for enhancing methanol yield were also reported [28,29]. One of the main challenges in the reactor designs of this system is the efficient removal of the reaction heat. A packed microstructured reactor-heat exchanger was proposed for efficient heat removal by Bakhtiary-Davijany et al. [30]. In the study by Cui and Kær [31], the performance of three reactor types for methanol synthesis was compared. It was found that the water-cooled reactor has advantages in efficient heat removal, low hot-spot temperature, and a wide range of operation inlet temperature, while the adiabatic reactor and the gas-cooled reactor demonstrated a relatively low and medium performance. Although methanol synthesis has been studied extensively in the literature, relatively few works were performed for a systematic analysis with a wide range of operating conditions. In this study, a systematic analysis for the effects of reactor geometry, operating conditions, syngas composition, and unreacted syngas recycle on methanol synthesis performance is carried out. The biogas with various CH4/CO2 compositions is used as the feedstock for syngas production. A combined dry and steam reforming process for producing a suitable composition of syngas is discussed. In addition, the performance of a green process for methanol synthesis using captured CO2 as the feedstock is also presented and compared with the results from traditional syngas feedstock. Both thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic models are employed in this study and detail comparisons on feedstock conversion and methanol yield between these two models are addressed."
1,Thermodynamic background,"The stoichiometric reactions involved in the methanol synthesis using syngas as feedstock are, COhydrogenation (1) CO + 2 H 2 ⇌ C H 3 O H , Δ H 298 K = - 90.7 k J · m o l - 1 CO 2 h y d r o g e n a t i o n (2) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ⇌ C H 3 O H + H 2 O , Δ H 298 K = - 49.51 k J · m o l - 1 From Eq. (1), CO reacts with H2 to form methanol. From Eq. (2), CO2 reacts with H2 to form methanol with water as a side product. In addition to the two methanol producing reactions, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [32] could also take place, (3) H 2 + CO 2 ⇌ C O + H 2 O , Δ H 298 K = 41.19 k J · m o l - 1 These reactions are reversible and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. The CO and CO2 hydrogenations are exothermic reactions and proceed with a decrease in the number of moles. Hence, lower temperatures and higher pressures drive the equilibrium of the methanol synthesis reactions forward, following Le Chatelier’s principle. The RWGS reaction is endothermic and proceeds with no change in the number of moles [33]. From Eqs. (1) and (2), one mole of CO2 consumes three moles of H2 and one mole of CO consumes two moles of H2 for the conversion to methanol. The stoichiometric amounts of reactants can be described by the line of stoichiometry given as, (4) 2 F CO F H 2 + 3 F CO 2 F H 2 = 1 where Fi is the molar flow rate of species i. For 2 F CO F H 2 + 3 F CO 2 F H 2 with a value less than one, it implies that the amount of hydrogen available is greater than the stoichiometric amount. Alternatively, the line of stoichiometry can be represented by the stoichiometric number defined as, (5) SN = F H 2 - F CO 2 F CO + F CO 2 From Eqs. (1) and (2), the SN has a value of 2 [34]. Similar to the line of stoichiometry, SN with a value higher than 2 implies that excess H2 supply in the feedstock for methanol production."
2,Kinetic model,"The most common catalyst used in methanol production is the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst [35]. As the RWGS reaction connects Eqs. (1) and (2), only two of the reactions described in Eqs. (1)-(3) are stoichiometric independent and need to be considered for the overall reaction. The kinetics of methanol synthesis over the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst developed by Vanden Bussche and Froment [36] is used in this work. This model is based on the LHHW mechanism and assumes that CO2 is the main source of methanol and the rate expressions are given as follows, (6) r MeOH = k MeOH P CO 2 P H 2 - 1 / K eq , M e O H P CH 3 O H P H 2 O / P H 2 3 1 + K a P H 2 O / P H 2 + K b P H 2 + K c P H 2 O 3 m o l ∙ s - 1 ∙ kg cat - 1 (7) r RWGS = k RWGS P CO 2 - 1 / K eq , W G S P CO P H 2 O / P H 2 1 + K a P H 2 O / P H 2 + K b P H 2 + K c P H 2 O m o l ∙ s - 1 ∙ kg cat - 1 In Eqs. (6) and (7), Pi is the partial pressure of component i (bar), kMeOH and kWGS are rate constants, K eq , M e O H and K eq , W G S are equilibrium constants, and K a , K b and K c are adsorption constants. These variables are given as, (8a) k MeOH = 1.07 e x p 36696 RT , k WGS = 1.22 e x p - 94765 RT (8b) log 10 K eq , M e O H = - 10.592 + 3066 T , log 10 K eq , W G S = 2.029 - 2073 T (8c) K a = 0.499 e x p 17197 RT , K b = 6.62 × 10 - 11 e x p 124119 RT , K c = 3453.38 In this study, a tubular fixed-bed reactor is used to perform the methanol synthesis using syngas or captured CO2 as the feedstock. As there are no significant deviations between gas- and solid-phase concentrations of different components along the reactor axis, the pseudo-homogeneous reactor model seems to be a good choice for the methanol synthesis process [3]. The basic assumptions involved in the homogeneous reactor model are given below. (1) The reactor is operated under a steady-state flow condition. (2) The catalyst effectiveness is constant. The axial mass diffusion and heat conduction are negligible. (3) There is no accumulation of coolant in the cooling jacket. Effective heat removal can be achieved for reactors operated under an isothermal condition. (4) The side reactions are negligible. Based on these assumptions, the balances of mass and energy, and pressure variation along the reactor length can be written as, Mass (9) d F i dz = 1 - ε b ρ cat A c R i , i = C H 3 O H , H 2 O , CO 2 , C O , H 2 Energy (10) ∑ i = 1 N F I C pi dT dz = A c ∑ j = 1 N R r j Δ H j - U T - T C Pressure (11) dP dz = - 150 μ 1 - ε b 2 ∅ p ε b 3 d p 2 u + 1.75 ρ 1 - ε b ∅ p ε b 3 d p u 2 In Eqs. (9), z is the axial location along the reactor length, ε b is the catalyst bed porosity, ρ cat is the catalyst density, A c is the cross-sectional area of the reactor tube, R i is the rate of production or consumption of species i. Based on the chemical reactions described in Eqs. (1)–(3) and reaction rate expressions described in Eqs. (6) and (7), the rate of production or consumption of each species can be expressed as, (12a) R C H 3 O H = r MeOH (12b) R H 2 O = r MeOH + r RWGS (12c) R CO = r RWGS (12d) R CO 2 = - r MeOH - r RWGS (12e) R H 2 = - 3 r MeOH - r RWGS In Eq. (10), T is the temperature of the gas mixture, N R is the number of reactions, r j is the rate of reaction described in Eqs. (6) and (7), Δ H j is the heat of reaction of the jth reaction, U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, Tc is the temperature of the coolant, and Cpi is the heat capacity of gas species i. The temperature-dependent specific heat and heat of reaction can be expressed as [37], (13) C p = a + b T / 1000 + c T / 1000 2 + d T / 1000 3 (14a) Δ H MeOH = - 49.51 + C pC H 3 O H + C p H 2 O - C p CO 2 - 3 C p H 2 T - 298 (14b) Δ H RWGS = 41.19 + C pCO + C p H 2 O - C p CO 2 - C p H 2 T - 298 In Eq. (11), the pressure variation along the reactor length is described by the Ergun equation [38]. In Eq. (11), μ and ρ are the viscosity and density of the gas mixture, respectively, u is the superficial velocity, and dp and ϕp are the catalyst diameter and spherical factor, respectively."
3,Results and discussion,
4,Model verification,"4.1 Model verification The homogeneous model described above is verified using the results reported in the study by Vanden Bussche and Froment [36]. Under the same operation conditions, Fig. 1 shows the molar concentrations of species and gas mixture temperature along the reactor length. By comparing the results shown in Fig. 1 with that reported by Vanden Bussche and Froment [36], almost identical results are obtained from the model described in Eqs. (9)–(11). Based on the agreement stated above, the built model is extended to study methanol synthesis based on industrial applications described by Luyben [39]. The geometric configuration, operation conditions, and catalyst bed specifications are listed in Table 1 . Fig. 2 shows the molar flow rates of species as a function of reactor length for a single tube under isothermal operation with a temperature of 250 °C and adiabatic condition with an inlet temperature of 250 °C. The performance of methanol synthesis can be characterized by CO conversion, CO2 conversion, H2 utility, and product yield defined as, (15) X i ( % ) = F in , i - F out , i F in , i × 100 , i = C O , CO 2 (16) E H 2 ( % ) = F in , H 2 - F out , H 2 F in , H 2 × 100 (17) Y i % = F out , i - F in , i F in , C O + F in , CO 2 × 100 , i = C H 3 O H , C O , H 2 O From Eq. (15), the combined CO and CO2 conversion can be defined as, (18) X CO + CO 2 ( % ) = F in , C O + F in , CO 2 - F out , C O + F out , CO 2 F in , C O + F in , CO 2 × 100 Based on the results shown in Fig. 2, it can be seen that CO and CO2 conversions, H2 utility, and methanol yield are quite low. Further enhancement of the methanol synthesis performance is necessary. Also, note that the methanol yield is identical to the combined CO and CO2 conversion based on the definitions shown in Eqs. (17) and (18)."
5,Effect of reactor size,"4.2 Effect of reactor size The reactor size is one of the factors that affect the methanol synthesis performance. Essentially, a change in reactor size implies the change in the residential time of the reactant inside the reactor. In this study, the effect of reactor size on the methanol synthesis is examined based on the data listed in Table 1. There are two ways to change the reactor size, either by changing the reactor diameter or by changing reactor length. In Fig. 3 , the effect of reactor length on methanol synthesis performance as a function inlet temperature under isothermal conditions is shown. To obtain the results shown in Fig. 3, the data listed in Table 1 are used except that the reactor length is varied. In Fig. 3(a), the methanol yield for various reactor lengths is shown along with the thermodynamic equilibrium results under the same operating conditions. The thermodynamic equilibrium results are predicted using the RStoic reactor provided in Aspen Plus (v.11). Note that the methanol yields from both gaseous and two-phase (vapor and liquid) synthetic products are shown in Fig. 3(a). With product condensation included in the prediction model, a greater methanol yield can be obtained. This is due to the condensation of products results in their removal from the reacting gaseous mixture, thus driving the equilibrium toward product formation [40–42]. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the enhanced methanol yield by condensation can only be obtained for temperatures lower than 165 °C under the operation of 5 MPa. For the kinetic approach results shown in Fig. 3(a), it can be seen that the methanol yield increases as reactor inlet temperature increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases with inlet temperature. That is, as the temperature increases, the reaction shows a transition from the kinetic regime to the equilibrium regime where the methanol yield obtained from the kinetic model agrees with the variation trend predicted by the thermodynamic model discussed above. It is expected that the methanol yield obtained from kinetic model approaches to that obtained from equilibrium model as the reactant residential time is high enough. The increase in methanol yield with temperature in the kinetic regime is attributed to the increase in the reaction rate as temperature increases and the decrease in equilibrium regime is due to the thermodynamic limit being approached. Because the reaction is reversible and exothermic, it follows Le Chatelier’s principle that methanol yield will decrease when the temperature is increased. Fig. 3(a) also shows that the methanol yield variation depends on the tube length. With longer tube length, higher methanol yield can be obtained due to higher residential time for temperatures in the kinetic regime. However, decreased methanol yield results for temperatures in the equilibrium regime. The reason for this decrease in methanol yield can be explained by the pressure drop across the reactor length as shown in Fig. 3(b). In Fig. 3(b), the pressure drop is defined as the pressure difference between reactor inlet and outlet. With an increase in tube length, it is seen that pressure drop increases. Because methanol synthesis is favorable with high pressure, higher pressure drop causes methanol yield decrease based on Le Chatelier’s principle. From Fig. 3(b), it is interesting to point out the pressure drop increases with increased inlet temperature. A local maximum and a local minimum pressure drop can be found which is related to the reaction transition from kinetic regime to equilibrium regime. The effect of reactor diameter on methanol synthesis performance is shown in Fig. 4 . To obtain the results shown in Fig. 4, the data listed in Table 1 is used except that the reactor diameter is varied. In Fig. 4(a), the methanol yield predicted from the kinetic model as a function of inlet temperatures for various reactor diameters under isothermal operation is shown. For comparison purposes, the thermodynamic equilibrium predictions are also shown in Fig. 4(a). Similar to the reactor length case, the residential time of the reactant can be varied by varying the rector diameters. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the methanol yield variation trend is similar to those shown in Fig. 3(a). For the kinetic model, the methanol yield increases with increased inlet temperature, reaches a maximum value, and then decreases with increased inlet temperatures. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 3(a) for the kinetic regime, the increase in methanol yield with temperature is due to the increase in the reaction rate as temperature increases and the decrease is due to the thermodynamic limit being approached in the equilibrium regime. Unlike the varied length case shown in Fig. 3(a), no significant difference in methanol yields obtained from the kinetic model for various reactor diameters in the equilibrium regime. This is because less pressure drop is produced by the reactor diameter variation as shown in Fig. 4(b). From Fig. 4(b), the magnitude of pressure drop across the reactor is small and decreases with increased reactor diameter."
6,Effect of reaction operating conditions,"4.3 Effect of reaction operating conditions From the results discussed in section 4.2, a reactor with a large diameter and short length would be preferred for getting higher methanol yield in the reactor design under isothermal operation. However, a large amount of cooling is required for the isothermal operation due to exothermic reaction. For more convenient operation, methanol synthesis can also be operated adiabatically [31]. Fig. 5 shows the methanol synthesis performance under the same conditions used in Fig. 4, except that reactor is operated adiabatically. Fig. 5(a) shows the methanol yield as a function of inlet temperature predicted by both thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic models. Without heat removal from the reactor, gas product temperature is expected to increase along the reactor length. Fig. 5(b) shows the reactor outlet temperature as a function of inlet temperature corresponding to the results shown in Fig. 5(a). Because methanol synthesis favors at low temperatures and high pressures, the methanol yield from the thermodynamic equilibrium model decreases with increased inlet temperatures. Also, note that no methanol yield enhancement by the product condensation occurs due to the increased product temperature. As compared with the isothermal case shown in Fig. 4(a), much low methanol yield results from the adiabatic reactor under thermodynamic equilibrium. For the kinetic model, the variation trend of methanol yield is similar to the isothermal case, except for the sharp increase in the transition from kinetic to equilibrium regime. For low inlet temperatures, the increase in methanol yield with temperature is attributed to the increase of the reaction rate as temperature increases in the kinetic regime while the decreased methanol yield in the equilibrium regime is due to the thermodynamic limit. Because of increased residential time as the reactor diameter increases, methanol yield increases with the increased diameter for inlet temperatures in the kinetic regime. For inlet temperatures in the equilibrium regime, it is seen that no significant difference in methanol yields obtained from kinetic and equilibrium models as shown in Fig. 5(a). As also shown in Fig. 5(a) for the kinetic model, it can be seen that to have methanol yield, the inlet temperature must be higher than a certain temperature which depends on the reactor diameter. Taking the reactor with a diameter of 2d case as an example, Tin must be higher than 140 °C to activate the reaction. With temperatures higher than 140 °C, it follows that there is a narrow range of inlet temperatures between which the conversion increases rapidly. For the reactor diameter of the 2d case, the maximum methanol yield can be obtained when Tin is 165 °C. As inlet temperatures beyond 165 °C, the methanol yield from the kinetic model decreases with increased temperature and matches with the equilibrium conversion obtained from the thermodynamic model. Based on Fig. 5(a), the optimum methanol yield can be obtained with the temperature at which the thermodynamic limit is reached. It is also interesting to point out that the reactor outlet temperatures are almost identical for various reactor diameters and follows the same variation trend as that of thermodynamic equilibrium prediction in the equilibrium regime as shown in Fig. 5(b)."
7,Methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation,"4.4 Methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation By using the data list in Table 1 except that the CO molar flow rate is set to zero, the methanol produced from CO2 hydrogenation can be studied by using the isothermal reactor. As referring to methanol synthesis from syngas, CO2 hydrogenation is regarded as a new process for methanol production [43]. This new process can be considered as a green chemical process because it uses CO2 that contributing to the mitigation of CO2. To realize the effect of reaction temperature, the inlet temperature is varied from 100 to 500 °C. Fig. 6 (a) shows the results of methanol yield from CO2 hydrogenation predicted by both thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic models. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 3(a), methanol yield decreases with the increased temperature predicted from the thermodynamic equilibrium model, and enhanced methanol yield can be obtained at low temperatures due to product condensation. For the kinetic model, the variation trend of methanol yield is also similar to the results shown in Fig. 3(a). A maximum methanol yield with a value of 25.48% results at 252 °C. That is the equilibrium regime is reached when the inlet temperature is higher than 252 °C. Based on Eq. (2), it is expected that the water yield would be identical to methanol. Therefore, with the removal of water, for example by using a membrane reactor [31], the methanol yield can be enhanced. Fig. 6(b) shows the CO2 conversion corresponding to the result shown in Fig. 6(a). For the thermodynamic equilibrium model, CO2 conversion decreases as temperature increases. This is due to exothermic CO2 hydrogenation for producing methanol and water. With a temperature higher than 252 °C, CO2 conversion increases as temperature increases due to endothermic RWGS reaction for producing CO and H2O. For the kinetic model, it is seen that CO2 conversion increases as temperature increases. The variation trends of CO2 conversion shown in Fig. 6(b) can be explained by the reactions involved in the reactor. For low temperatures, the exothermic CO2 hydrogenation reaction is dominant and results in methanol and water productions. For high temperatures, the endothermic RWGS reaction is dominant and results in CO and water productions. Therefore, CO2 is consumed in higher temperature regimes and results in increased CO2 conversion for both thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic models. Fig. 6(c) shows the CO yield from CO2 hydrogenation. It is seen that a small amount of CO can be produced at a low-temperature regime. In a high-temperature regime, CO yield increases as temperature increases due to RWGS reaction. The corresponding H2 utility is shown in Fig. 6(d). As described above, H2 utility depends on temperature which determines the dominance of reactions that occur in the reactor. For the thermodynamic equilibrium model, a minimum H2 utility occurs at 252 °C. After that H2 utility increases with temperatures. As mentioned above, H2 is consumed along with CO2 to form H2O via RWGS reaction when the temperature is high. For the kinetic model, H2 utility increases with temperature due to increased chemical kinetics, reaches a maximum value at 252 °C, decreases to a local minimum, and then increases with temperature. Similar to thermodynamic equilibrium prediction, the increased H2 in a higher temperature regime is mainly used to form H2O according to endothermic RWGS reaction. It is also noted that the H2 utility is low because the H2 flow rate listed in Table 1 is much higher than the stoichiometric flow rate required for the CO2 hydrogenation."
8,Effect of syngas composition,"4.5 Effect of syngas composition From the above discussion, the highest methanol yield of 55% can be reached, as shown in Fig. 4(a) for the syngas composition listed in Table 1 and the reactor diameter is five times the original design. In addition to reactor geometry, it would also be desired to understand the effect of syngas composition on methanol yield. Although there is a slight difference between kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium models based on the results shown in Fig. 3 ~ 6, the thermodynamic equilibrium model is adopted to examine the effect of syngas composition on methanol yield because it is reactor geometry independent. From Eqs. (1) and (2), one mole of CO2 consumes three moles of H2 and one mole of CO consumes two moles of H2 for conversion to methanol. Therefore, the molar ratios of CO/H2 and CO2/H2 range in 0–1/2 and 0–1/3, respectively, are used to examine the effect of syngas composition on methanol yield. By using the operating pressure of 5 MPa and inlet temperature of 250 °C, Fig. 7 shows the methanol synthesis performance as functions of CO/H2 and CO2/H2 ratios under isothermal operation. Fig. 7(a) shows the SN distribution. As discussed above, the line with SN = 2 is known as the stoichiometric line which is clearly shown as the diagonal line in Fig. 7(a). Below the stoichiometric line, SN has a value greater than 2. Very high SN can be obtained when CO/H2 and CO2/H2 ratios are low. Fig. 7 (b) shows the combined CO and CO2 conversion ( X CO + CO 2 ) distribution. It can be seen that high X CO + CO 2 can be obtained for syngas with a high CO/H2 ratio and a low CO2/H2 ratio for the region having SN greater than 2. For a given CO/H2 ratio, X CO + CO 2 decreases with an increased CO2/H2 ratio. In the region with SN less than 2, lower X CO + CO 2 is obtained. As noted earlier, the methanol yield is identical to X CO + CO 2 according to the definitions defined in Eqs. (17) and (18). Fig. 7(c) shows the H2 utility. High H2 utility occurs in the region with high CO/H2 and low CO2/H2. Fig. 7(d) shows the methanol production per mole of H2 supplied. It can be seen that high X CO + CO 2 does not correspond to high methanol production. From Fig. 7(d), high methanol production can be obtained at conditions of high CO/H2 ratio, low CO2/H2 ratio, and high H2 utility. Based on the suggestion by Rostrup-Nielsen [44] and Shahhosseini et al. [45] for industrial methanol production, the suitable syngas composition is that SN has a value of 2.1. In addition to SN, as pointed out by Grabow and Mavrikakis [46], syngas with a water content lower than 0.05% is desired to avoid catalyst deactivation [47]. Moreover, the CO2 content needs to be controlled to prevent enhancing the RWGS reaction for water production. It is suggested that the CO2 content is lower than 12% and the carbon ratio defined as (19) C R = F in , CO 2 F in , C O + F in , CO 2 falls in the range between 0.2 and 0.5. The CR corresponding to Fig. 7 is shown in Fig. 8 . CR with a value between 0.2 and 0.5 can be obtained in the region with CO/H2 ratio less than 0.36 and CO2/H2 ratio less than 0.2."
9,Syngas production from biogas reforming,"4.6 Syngas production from biogas reforming Biogas mainly contains CH4 and CO2. It is also assumed that the impurities present in biogas can be removed effectively by some of the well-known methods [48]. Using reforming techniques such as steam reforming (SR), dry reforming (DR), or partial oxidation (POX), or tri-reforming (TR), biogas can be converted to syngas for use in methanol synthesis [13,14]. By using DR, biogas can be directly converted into syngas without separation of CO2 along with its utilization. However, a large amount of solid carbon is formed due to insufficient CO2 supply [49,50]. To reduce the carbon formation and obtain suitable syngas composition for methanol synthesis, combined DR and SR, combined DR and POX, or TR may be used. Among these alternatives, combined DR and SR is preferred because H2O is easier to obtain as compared to O2 which is required in POX and TR. Moreover, the carbon formation can be reduced or eliminated by the H2O addition in the reforming reaction. In addition to H2O addition, CH4 is also added to get the desired SN, CR, water content, and CO2 content. The reforming reactions are assumed to occur under thermodynamic equilibrium at a given pressure and temperature. The Gibbs reactor provided by Aspen Plus is used to carry out the combined DR and SR syngas production. Under the pressure of 1 atm and reforming temperature varied in the range of 600–1000 °C, the SN, CR, and CO2 and water mole fractions, are shown in Fig. 9 (a), 9(b), and 9(c), respectively. To obtain the results shown in Figs. 9, 1 mol of biogas with various CH4/CO2 ratios is used as the feedstock. The amounts of CH4 and H2O added are 1 and 3 mol, respectively. Also, note that there is no carbon formation under the operating conditions described above. From Fig. 9(a), SN increases with increased reforming temperature and reaches a constant value. The SN has a value greater than 2 for all the three biogas compositions studied. Moreover, SN decreases when CO2 content is increased. In Fig. 9(b), the CR corresponding to Fig. 9(a) is shown. The CR decreases with increased reforming temperature. Also, note that CR increases with CO2 content in biogas. In Fig. 9(c), the mole fractions of CO2 and H2O in the syngas are shown. Similar to CR, the CO2 mole fraction increases with increased CO2 content in the biogas. For all the three biogas compositions studied, variation in mole fraction of water is not significant and has a value of 0.011. As compared with the suggestions for the industrial applications [44,46], the combined DR and SR for biogas reforming described above produces suitable syngas for methanol synthesis."
10,Methanol synthesis process,"4.7 Methanol synthesis process The methanol synthesis process built by using Aspen Plus is shown in Fig. 10 . As described above, the syngas is produced from combined DR and SR using biogas as the feedstock. The liquid water (FW) is vaporized by using a heater (FWH) and then mixed with biogas (BG) and methane (CH4) in a mixer (MIX-1). After mixing, the mixed feedstock enters the reformer (SYNGAS-R) at which the syngas is produced. As described above, the reforming reactions are assumed to occur under thermodynamic equilibrium at a given pressure and temperature. After solid particle removal (SEP1) and water removal by using a flush chamber (FLUSH), the syngas is sent to a multi-stage compressor equipped with intercooling. The syngas is compressed to the operating pressure of methanol synthesis. After cooled to the desired reaction temperature for methanol synthesis, the syngas enters the methanol reactor (MEOH-R). Since the methanol synthesis reactions are relatively clear, the Requil reactor that can perform the thermodynamic equilibrium reactions more accurately is selected in this study. After pressure reduction by an expansion value, methanol and water are separated in a separator (SEP). To enhance methanol production, the recycling of unreacted syngas is necessary. Using a splitter (SPLIT) with a specified recycle ratio, part of the unreacted syngas mixes with the syngas and enters the methanol reactor. The rest of the unreacted syngas is emitted to suppress the gas accumulation and used as fuel gas to reduce the consumption of fuel in the reformer. Using the syngas production described in Fig. 9 and the flow process shown in Fig. 10, the methanol synthesis performance is shown in Fig. 11 without unreacted syngas recycle. The operation pressure and temperature are 5 MPa and 250 °C, respectively, for the methanol reactor. From Fig. 11(a), it is seen that methanol production increases with increased methane amount in the biogas. The methanol production decreases with increased reforming temperature, reaches a minimum value, and then increases again with increased reforming temperature. From Fig. 11(b), it is seen that syngas produced for reforming temperatures lower than 700 °C. favors water production and lower methanol production, as shown in Fig. 11(a). The variations of methanol and water productions are related to the variations of SN and CR shown in Fig. 9(a) and 9(b). Because the water formation reduces methanol production, it is suggested to use the syngas produced at higher gasification temperatures [51]. Fig. 12 shows the recycle ratio effect on the methanol yield using syngas produced from biogas with CH4/CO2 = 0.60/0.40. With an increased recycle ratio, a larger amount of unreacted syngas is recycled to the methanol synthesis reactor. From Fig. 12, it is seen that methanol production is enhanced when the unreacted syngas is recycled."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, the performance of methanol synthesis was analyzed systematically using syngas or captured CO2 as feed and tubular fixed-bed reactors. Based on the results, the following conclusions are made: (1) A reactor with a greater diameter and shorter length is suggested for increasing the residential time of reactant and enhancing the methanol production. (2) The isothermal reactor can have a higher methanol yield as compared to the adiabatic reactor under the same operating conditions. (3) The methanol yield from CO2 hydrogenation can be enhanced by the removal of side product water. The optimum methanol yield of 25.48% with CO2 inlet temperature of 252 °C was obtained. (4) High methanol production can be obtained for syngas with a high CO/H2 ratio, low CO2/H2 ratio, and high H2 utility. (5) With CH4 and H2O additions and using combined dry and steam reforming with molar ratio of Biogas/CH4/H2O = 1/1/3, syngas with composition satisfied industrial applications for methanol synthesis can be obtained. (6) Higher methanol production can be obtained for higher CH4 content in biogas. (7) Recycle of unreacted syngas enhances methanol production."
