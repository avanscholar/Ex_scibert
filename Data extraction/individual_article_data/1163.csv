0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) is an efficient, clean, safe and sustainable secondary energy, is also recognized as the cleanest energy in the world [1,2]. It behaves huge potential to solve global energy crisis. At the same time, it is in line with Chinese carbon emission reduction strategy [3]. For the production of green H2, there are various chemical and biological methods, including photocatalytic [4–7], photoelectrocatalytic [8] and electrocatalytic [9] water splitting, etc. Among these methods, STH conversion is a very promising and effective way attribute to its unique advantages, such as environment-friendly, energy-saving, pollution-free and high efficiency [10]. Many inorganic and organic semiconductor materials have been used as photocatalysts for water splitting to H2, e.g., CN [1,11,12], titanium dioxide (TiO2) [13,14], cadmium sulfide (CdS) [15–18], and black phosphorus (BP) [19], etc. Among these, the metal-free organic polymer CN is the most popular one because of its inherent characteristics including suitable band gap (~2.7 eV) [20], simple preparation method, economy and low-toxicity. Nevertheless, the H2-evolution efficiency of pristine CN is unsatisfactory due to the serious recombination of photo-generated carriers and poor conductivity. For this, construct CN-based heterojunction has been proved to be an effective strategy, which can precisely regulate the redox active sites, and realize the controllable operation of oxidation and reduction half-reactions [21]. To our knowledge, RhxP/CN [22], single-atom Pt/CN [23], CN/amorphous NiS [24], carbon nanotubes/CN [25], CN-based donor-acceptor conjugated copolymers and Ni(OH)2/3D porous CN [26] heterojunctions have exhibited excellent photocatalytic H2-evolution performance. Recently, 2D lanthanum vanadate (LaVO4) nanoflakes with high crystallinity is an attractive semiconductor to regulate reduction and oxidation sites via the directional transfer of photo-generated charges [27]. Moreover, it exhibits good surface catalytic property, and its electrons in V 3d orbitals can be activated by sunlight to adjust its visible light response [28], making itself a potential candidate for photocatalytic H2-evolution. At present, LaVO4 has been used in photocatalytic dye degradation [29,30], antibiotic removal [31], water splitting [32] and carbon dioxide reduction [33], etc. Holes scavenger is usually necessary to improve the H2-evolution rate in water splitting. However, most reports on photocatalytic water splitting using TEOA [34,35] or lactic acid as h+ scavengers, which are uneconomical, wasteful and environment-unfriendly [36,37]. These electron donors will be oxidized into worthless substances, such as carbon-containing organic matter, CO2, etc., which are harmful to water resources and air [36]. To solve these shortcomings, converting sacrificial agents into valuable chemicals is a feasible and interesting method. The oxidation half reaction can switch the useless scavengers to valuable organic chemicals by photo-generated h+ [38]. More interestingly, the produced valuable oxidized products exist in liquid, while the reduced H2 exists as gas, the two useful products are separated automatically, which is extremely meaningful in industrial production that can greatly reduce separation cost [39]. It is acknowledged that biomass exists abundantly in nature, which is often obtained from discarded plant stalks [40]. Therefore, it is meaningful to directly convert biomass into high valuable chemicals by the photo-generated h+. In order to meet the needs of sustainable development, solar-light-driven valorization of biomass-derived alcohols (such as ethanol [41], FFA [42], p-methoxybenzyl alcohol [43], cinnamyl alcohol [44], benzylamine [45–47], benzyl alcohol [48,49], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [50–52], etc.) have attracted widespread attention. For example, the common biomass FFA can be converted into high value-added chemicals (e.g. furfural) via oxidation reaction. Furfural is a raw material for the preparation of many drugs and industrial products, and some derivatives of furfural have strong bactericidal ability and a wide range of bacteriostasis. At the same time, this strategy can simultaneously solve the dual problems of inability to handle straw and waste of photo-generated h+. In this work, a fantastic 2D/2D heterostructure of LaVO4/CN is designed and fabricated for efficient photocatalytic H2-evolution coupled with high value-added furfural production, as shown in Scheme 1. The 2D/2D photocatalyst is constructed by self-assembly method, where square LaVO4 nanoflakes are tightly anchored on the surface of thin-layer CN nanosheets. The well-formed hetero-interfaces are beneficial for this photocatalytic reaction. The structural properties of LaVO4/CN heterojunctions were investigated by series of characterizations, and the photocatalytic performance was evaluated by water splitting reaction using FFA as h+ scavenger. The oxidation and reduction abilities of LaVO4/CN were determined by the yields of H2 and furfural, respectively. More importantly, the corresponding photocatalytic mechanism was also proposed based on various mechanism verification experiments."

3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The morphologies and elemental analysis of samples were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H600 with 200 kV acceleration voltage), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, selected area electron diffraction (SAED). X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD, Bruker D8) were carried out to characterize the crystallographic structures of samples. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was measured by NICOLE iS50 FT-IR. The optical properties of the as-prepared samples were measured by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS, Shimadzu UV-2600), steady state photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) spectra (FL/FSTCSPC920). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on ESCALAB 250Xi. The photoelectrochemical tests including transient photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky plots (M-S) curves were measured on CHI660E electrochemistry workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd) with a three-electrode system, in which Ag/AgCl, Pt sheet and samples coated on ITO acted as the reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. For photocurrent response and M-S tests, 150 mL of 0.1 M and 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions were used as electrolyte, respectively. In addition, a 150 mL aqueous solution of 0.5 M KCl containing 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] was used for EIS measurements. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out by ThermoFischer ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with a He discharge lamp (He I, 21.22 eV). Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET) was tested by Quantachrome, FL 33426. The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals were detected on the Bruker Desktop microESR using DMPO as free radical trapping reagent."
4,Synthesis of samples,"2.3 Synthesis of samples Two-dimensional CN nanosheets were prepared through a two-step calcination process, and the obtained light yellow thin layer CN. The square LaVO4 nanoflakes were prepared by a hydrothermal method [53]. The detailed operate processes were displayed in Supporting Information. The 2D/2D LaVO4/CN heterojunctions were prepared by thermal treatment method [54]. A certain proportion of CN and square LaVO4 nanoflakes were mixed in an agate mortar to ground for 30 min. The mixtures (wrapped by aluminum foil) were putted into a tube furnace and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h under argon atmosphere. For the weight percent of LaVO4 in LaVO4/CN heterojunctions were 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%, the corresponding products were labeled as 5% LaVO4/CN, 10% LaVO4/CN, 15% LaVO4/CN, 20% LaVO4/CN and 25% LaVO4/CN, respectively. The weight loss during the thermal treatment process of LaVO4/CN mixture was almost negligible (yield is 96%), which experimentally was experimentally verified."
5,Photocatalytic H2-evolution,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2-evolution The photocatalytic H2 production activities of samples were studied on a high airtight automatic analysis (Labsolar-6A) system. A suspension of catalyst (20 mg) in a mixed aqueous solution (100 mL) containing 10 mL of FFA or TEOA was prepared, then 3 wt% H2PtCl6•6H2O was added accompanied by fully sonicated, and vacuumed for 30 min to fully remove air. In this experiment, a Xenon lamp (300 W, PLS-SXE 300) with light power density of 250 mW cm−2 was used as a simulated sunlight source. In the process of photocatalytic H2 production, the temperature of the condensing cycle system was maintained at 15 °C. Online gas chromatograph (GC9790 Ⅱ, TCD detector, FL Instrument) was used to detect the H2 yield of the sample every hour. The yield of liquid phase production was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity Ⅱ). For the circulation experiment, the above process was repeated four times using the 15% LaVO4/CN sample as model. In addition, the AQE of 15% LaVO4/CN was measured using single wavelength light source of 400, 475 and 500 nm under the above reaction conditions. The test time is 2 h and the calculation formula is as follows: AQE = 100 % × the number of reacted electrons the number of incident photons"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology and structural characteristics,"3.1 Morphology and structural characteristics The morphology and lattice fringe spacing of as-prepared materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, HRTEM and element mapping images. As shown in Fig. 1a, the obtained CN presents a thin layer structure with folds, which looks like a layer of tulle. The square nanosheet structure of LaVO4 can be observed clearly by the TEM images in Fig. 1b, these square LaVO4 nanoflakes are evenly distributed with uniformed size of about 60 nm. The LaVO4 nanosheet depicts high crystallinity, whose obvious lattice fringes can be seen in the inset of Fig. 1b. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.42 nm is attributed to its (103) plane, which indicates the high crystallinity of LaVO4 nanosheet. The CN and square LaVO4 nanoflakes are easily integrated together via thermal interaction to form a 2D/2D LaVO4/CN heterostructure, which can be seen intuitively in its TEM image (Fig. 1c). The square LaVO4 nanoflakes are attached on the surface of CN nanosheets evenly and closely, which is beneficial for the formation of hetero-interfaces. The same conclusion can also be acquired from their SEM images in the Fig. S1a -b (Supporting Information). In order to further prove the successful formation of 2D/2D LaVO4/CN heterojunction, HRTEM analysis was conducted. Fig. 1d is the enlarged image of the yellow frame area in Fig. 1c, in which the square LaVO4 nanoflakes were tightly integrated with CN, the hetero-interface and boundary contour could be clearly observed. The lattice fringes of CN can’t be detected due to its poor crystallinity, while the (200) plane of LaVO4 was discovered that correspond to the lattice spacing of 0.37 nm. In addition, the good crystallinity of square LaVO4 nanoflakes is further confirmed by the element mapping and SAED test (inset in Fig. 1d), the evident diffused diffraction rings indicate its polycrystals structure, the rings from inside to outside corresponded to its (200), (202) and (400) planes, respectively. The elements analysis of LaVO4/CN photocatalyst was implemented by TEM ( Fig. 2) and SEM (Fig. S1c -g) EDS mapping images. As shown in Fig. 2, C, N, La, O and V elements were all detected and marked with bright colors. The existing areas of C and N elements are consistent well with CN nanosheet, and the shapes of La, O and V elements are identical with the square LaVO4 nanosheet. This shows that CN and LaVO4 nanosheets are well combined with each other. The EDS results (Fig. S2) also confirm the presence of La, V, O, C and N elements. The results further demonstrate that LaVO4/CN heterostructure has been constructed successfully. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of catalysts were detected by BET, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms show the specific surface areas of thin-layer CN nanosheets and 15% LaVO4/CN hybrid are 70.838 and 52.036 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3), respectively, is much higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 (~5–30 m2 g−1), which implies abundant photocatalytic reactive sites. The CN and 15% LaVO4/CN mainly contain mesopores, which is beneficial for the release of small molecule H2."
8,Phase and crystal structure,"3.2 Phase and crystal structure The surface chemical state and element composition of CN, LaVO4 and 15% LaVO4/CN hybrid were analyzed by XPS ( Fig. 3). The elements contained in samples could be further affirmed by XPS spectra, such as the C, N, O, La and V elements in LaVO4/CN heterojunction (Fig. 3a). The binding energies of covalent bonds involved in different elements can be analyzed via their high resolution XPS spectra. For La 3d (Fig. 3b), four XPS peaks were detected, the peaks at 834.2 and 838.8 eV belong to La 3d5/2, and the peaks at 851.5 and 856.0 eV belong to the binding energies of La 3d3/2. In Fig. 3c, the peaks at 517.2 and 524.8 eV are ascribed to the binding energies of V 2p2/5 and V 2p3/2, respectively, which are the characteristic signals of V 2p [54]. Fig. 3d shows that the C 1s XPS spectra could be divided into three peaks, corresponding to CC (284.6 eV), C-O (286 eV) and NC-N (288 eV), respectively [55]. And the N 1s high-resolution spectra (Fig. 3e) are divided into three peaks at 398.4 eV, 399.8 eV and 401.2 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of CN-C, N-C3 and N-H functional groups, respectively [56,57]. Meanwhile, the O 1s spectra of LaVO4 and LaVO4/CN (Fig. 3f) are constructed by two peaks, which may originate from the crystal lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species in samples, respectively. For 15% LaVO4/CN hybrid, its binding energies of all elements are almost the same compared with pure CN or LaVO4, illustrating the structural stability of this heterostructure. The crystal structures of photocatalysts were investigated by XRD examination. As shown in Fig. 4a, it’s well known that the 2θ peaks of CN nanosheets at 13.1° and 27.3° were corresponding to its (100) and (002) crystal planes, respectively. The diffraction peaks of prepared square LaVO4 nanoflakes matches well with its standard card (JCPDS No. 32-0504), and no other crystalline phases were detected (Fig. S4). The characteristic XRD peaks of square LaVO4 nanosheets at 17.9°, 23.8°, 32.5°, 45.7° and 47.3° are attributed to its (101), (200), (112), (321) and (312) planes, respectively [27]. For LaVO4/CN hybrids, both characteristic peaks of LaVO4 and CN could be detected, and the peak intensities of 23.8°, 32.5° and 47.3° gradually increased with the increasing contents of LaVO4. The XRD results further confirm the successful fabrication and high stability of LaVO4/CN heterostructures. Fig. S5 shows the FTIR spectra of samples, for CN, the peak at 800 cm−1 is the characteristic absorption peak of the triazine ring, and the multiple peak bands at 1200–1600 cm−1 belong to the stretching vibration peak of the CN and C-N heterocyclic rings [58]. The broad peak at 3000–3600 cm−1 is caused by N-H stretching vibration [59]. And for LaVO4, the strong absorption peak at 769 cm−1 is attributed to the absorption of V-O (from the VO4 3- group) [53]. For LaVO4/CN hybrids, we can see the both characteristic absorption peaks of LaVO4 and CN, which can further prove their combination."
9,Optical properties,"3.3 Optical properties The optical properties of CN, LaVO4 and LaVO4/CN hybrids were investigated by UV-Vis DRS, PL and TRPL. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the light absorption edges of CN and LaVO4 are located at about 450 and 370 nm, respectively. Thus, their corresponding band gap energies (Eg) are calculated to be 2.77 and 3.30 eV (Fig. S6) according to the formula: (ahv)2 =A(hv-Eg) [60]. The light absorption of LaVO4/CN hybrids over 250–450 nm are similar to the pure CN because g-C3N4 occupies the main component, while LaVO4/CN hybrids exhibit higher intensity over a wider absorption range (450–800 nm), which attributes to the interaction between V 3d orbitals and g-C3N4 [28], indicating that the light absorption capacity of CN could be improved by the combination of LaVO4. The recombination and utilization rate of photo-generated electrons (e-) and h+ of photocatalysts could be evaluated by PL spectra. The faster recombination of e- and h+ would promote the enhancement of PL signal. When excited at 350 nm, CN exhibits a strong PL signal at around 440 nm (Fig. 4c), which is related to the near-band edge emission. The strong PL signal of CN mean that photo-generated carriers could easily transferred to its surface, but with rapid recombination, which was unconductive to the photocatalytic H2-evolution process. After loading LaVO4 nanoflakes, the PL emission peak intensity of CN was significantly reduced, indicating LaVO4/CN could effectively realize the efficient suppression to radioactive recombination of photoinduced e- and h+. Especially, 15% LaVO4/CN exhibits the lowest PL intensity, implying the maximum utilization of photogenerated carriers, which is both beneficial to the H2-evolution via e- reduction and the furfural generation via h+ oxidation. In addition, the charge transfer dynamics were investigated by TRPL, as shown in Fig. 4d. The fluorescence lifetimes of CN and 15% LaVO4/CN are 7.27 and 4.23 ns, respectively. The shorter fluorescence lifetime of 15% LaVO4/CN indicates a non-radiative pathway for the electronic interaction between LaVO4 and CN [61,62], implies the effective migration and higher utilization of photogenerated carriers, which is favorable to the photocatalytic reaction [63]. The results of samples could further confirm the above speculation."
10,Photoelectrochemical properties,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical properties In order to further study the charge separation, transfer and recombination of photo-generated e- and h+ on fabricated photocatalysts, photoelectrochemical experiments including photocurrent transient response and EIS were carried out. As displayed in Fig. 5a, these samples are very sensitive to sunlight due to their sudden rise/drop of photocurrent response at the moment of turn on/off the light source. The photocurrent densities of LaVO4/CN hybrids are much higher than that of pristine CN and LaVO4 nanosheets because of their faster charge separation and transfer efficiency. Particularly, 15% LaVO4/CN behaves the most optimal result and its photocurrent density is 2.5 times than that of pristine CN. Therefore, 15% LaVO4/CN possesses a higher charge-separation efficiency and plays an irreplaceable role in the coupling reaction of photocatalytic H2 production and FFA oxidation. Similarly, EIS plots (Fig. 5b) could be used to investigate the pohtocatalytic process. A number of critical photocatalytic parameters including Rs, R1, CPE1, R2, and CPE2 can be fitted out from the measured Nyquist diagrams of samples by an equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 5b). These parameters represent the series impedance of the system, the impedance and the capacitance of space charge and double layer, respectively [64]. It is known that the smaller radius represents the smaller resistance of charge transfer at surface or hetero-interface of photocatalyst, which is conducive to the improvement of photocatalytic activity. As we can see, the pure CN and 15% LaVO4/CN exhibit the biggest and smallest arc radius, respectively, corresponding to the worst and best photocatalytic performance. It indicates a lower resistance and higher charge transfer efficiency between 15% LaVO4/CN composite and electrolyte. Furthermore, the semiconductor types, flat band positions, Fermi levels (Ef), work functions (φ) and valence band (VB) values of CN and LaVO4 were determined by M-S plots and UPS tests. As displayed in Fig. 5c-d, CN and LaVO4 are classified as n-type semiconductors because of their positive M-S slopes. The determined flat band positions of CN and LaVO4 were − 1.18 and − 0.81 V (vs Ag/AgCl, pH = 7), respectively. Thus the determined Fermi levels (Ef) of CN and LaVO4 were − 0.98 and − 0.61 V (vs NHE, pH = 7), respectively, because Ef for a n-type semiconductor is close to its flat band potential [65]. In addition, the ionization potentials (equal to EVB) and φ of CN and LaVO4 were determined by UPS. As shown in Fig. S7, the cutoff energy (E cutoff) and onset energy (E onset) of CN are 17.35 and 2.36 eV, respectively. Similarly, the E cutoff and E onset of LaVO4 are 16.52 and 2.43 eV, respectively. Then, the calculated VB potentials of CN and LaVO4 are 6.23 and 7.13 eV, respectively, by subtracting the width of He I UPS (21.22 eV is the excitation energy) via formula: E VB = 21.22 − (Ecutoff − Eonset) [66]. Based on the reference standard, for which 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode equals − 4.44 eV, the converted EVBs of CN and LaVO4 are 1.79 and 2.69 V, respectively. Therefore, according to formula EVB = ECB + Eg, the calculated conduction band (CB) potentials of CN and LaVO4 are − 0.98 and − 0.61 V, respectively. Moreover, the obtained φs of CN and LaVO4 are 3.87 and 4.70 eV (φ = 21.22 − Ecutoff), respectively [67]."
11,Photocatalytic H2-production evaluation,"3.5 Photocatalytic H2-production evaluation The photocatalytic activities of photocatalysts were evaluated by splitting water to H2 under visible light irradiation ( Fig. 6a-c). Fig. 6a shows the photocatalytic H2-evolution performance of LaVO4, CN and LaVO4/CN nanocomposites using FFA as h+ scavenger. It is obvious that the H2 production increase linearly with the time extension, indicating the stability of catalysts for this H2-evolution reaction. Here, the H2 yields of LaVO4/CN hybrids are much higher than that of pure CN (0.46 mmol g−1) and LaVO4 (trace). Especially the H2 yield of 15% LaVO4/CN reaches to 1.44 mmol g−1, which is 3 times as high as the pristine CN. The corresponding H2-evolution rates of samples are presented in Fig. 6b. The H2-evolution rate of 15% LaVO4/CN reaches to 0.287 mmol g−1 h−1. For comparison, TEOA was also used as a scavenger to further verify the H2-evolution performance of photocatalysts, and the same photocatalytic activity order of samples was obtained (Fig. 6c). 15% LaVO4/CN also exhibits the greatest H2 production of 12.93 mmol g−1, which is 9 times higher than that when FFA was used as sacrificial agent. Evidently, FFA was not as effective as TEOA for H2-evolution but FFA could produce more valuable furfural chemicals. However, the excessive high content of LaVO4 in LaVO4/CN is unfavorable for H2 generation, such as the photocatalytic performance of 25% LaVO4/CN is unsatisfactory. We deduces that the excessive LaVO4 nanoflakes will block the photocatalytic active sites of CN and leaded to the decrease of its H2 evolution abilities. The H2-evolution abilities of pure CN and 15% LaVO4/CN without Pt co-catalyst were also investigated, but the H2 yields are very low (Fig. S8), which demonstrating Pt co-catalyst is pivotal in this pohtocatalytic system. Electrons in CB of the catalyst can be quickly transferred to Pt and react with H+, and thus H2 is easier to be released from Pt-H bonds to dramatically enhance the H2-evolution rates of catalysts. The H2-evolution performance of 15% LaVO4/CN is much higher than that of reported CN-based materials, such as WS2/CN (1021 μmol g−1 h−1 with TEOA) [68], Bi2MoO6/CN (563.4 μmol g−1 h−1 with TEOA) [69], as shown in Table S1. In order to assess the sunlight utilization and stability of the LaVO4/CN hybrid, the wavelength dependence AQE and multiple cyclic experiments of H2-evolution were conducted on 15% LaVO4/CN. As shown in Fig. 6d and Table S2, the AQE of H2-evolution on 15% LaVO4/CN are calculated about 22.16%, 8.67% and 2.03% at λ = 400, 475 and 500 nm, respectively, revealing its high solar energy utilization. Additionally, the prepared LaVO4/CN complex displayed good photocatalytic stability. The H2 yields of 15% LaVO4/CN continuously increased within 20 h (inset in Fig. 6d), and could still remain high with only negligible decrease after four cycles (Fig. 6e), in which the slightly decrease of H2 generation rates may be caused by the consumption of FFA. In addition, in order to prove the stability of the catalyst, we compared the crystal phase of the material and the separation of photogenerated carriers before and after the reaction, as shown in Fig. S9 and Fig. S10. The similarily of the results between used and fresh catalyst indicate the stability of prepared LaVO4/CN photocatalyst."
12,Furfural production evaluation,"3.6 Furfural production evaluation Scavenger is necessary for this half-reaction: although TEOA was proved to be most suitable for H2-evolution, however, converting sacrificial agents into useful chemicals is more meaningful. Here, FFA is used as an h+ sacrificial agent to replace TEOA, because the biomass FFA could be transformed to valuable furfural, which is a precious chemical reagent [70]. As shown in Fig. 6f, the furfural yield on 15% LaVO4/CN via its oxidation of photo-generated h+ achieved 4.76 mmol g−1 (corresponded to the rate of 0.952 mmol g−1 h−1), is much higher than that of pure CN (0.26 mmol g−1) and LaVO4 (trace). The results demonstrate that 15% LaVO4/CN is an useful photocatalyst to produce furfural coupled with H2-evolution."
13,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.7 Photocatalytic mechanism The band gap, CB and VB potentials of CN and LaVO4 have been discussed above according to the UV-Vis DRS and M-S plots results, respectively. To further identify the oxidation-reduction potentials of photocatalysts, DMPO was used as radical capture reagent, methanol and water were solvents for detecting ·O2 − and ·OH, respectively. The ESR spin-trapping spectra were recorded to detect their hydroxyl radicals (DMPO-·OH) (·OH/H2O = 2.27 V vs NHE) and superoxide radicals (DMPO-·O2 −) (O2/·O2 - = −0.33 V vs NHE) production abilities, which could evaluate their H2 (H+/H2 = 0 V vs NHE) [60] and furfural evolution capabilities indirectly. As displayed in Fig. 7, no characteristic peaks of ·O2 − or ·OH were observed under dark conditions, suggesting that H2 can’t be generated without light. The six characteristic peaks of ·O2 − (1:2:2:1) (Fig. 7a) and the four characteristic peaks of ·OH (Fig. 7b) were all detected after illuminating 2 min, the CB potentials of CN and LaVO4 were more negatively than that of O2/·O2 - (−0.33 V vs NHE) [20] that can be inferred, and the VB potentials were maybe more positive than that of ·OH/H2O (2.27 V vs NHE) [60], or ·OH was derived from the further reduction of ·O2 − (·O2 − + e− + 2H+ → H2O2, H2O2 + e− →·OH + OH-) [63]. The ·O2 − peak intensity of LaVO4 is weaker than that of CN, demonstrating the more negative CB value of CN. It is worth noting that the ESR peak intensities of LaVO4/CN are higher than that of pure CN and LaVO4, deducing that the oxidation/reduction potentials and photo-generated carriers’ utilization are greatly enhanced after constructing LaVO4/CN heterojunction, which is favorable for the oxidation and reduction reactions. Based on the results of above mechanism verification experiments, a possible Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism for water splitting of LaVO4/CN heterojunction was proposed ( Fig. 8). Generally, the Ef is close to the flatband potential in n-type semiconductors [71]. Thus, a staggered energy band structure forms between CN and LaVO4 with the Ef position of LaVO4 much lower than that of CN. Under sunlight irradiation, the electron-hole (e--h+) pairs of LaVO4 and CN will be separated, photo-generated e- are excited to their CB positions while h+ are maintained on VB places. The Ef of these two n-type LaVO4 and CN will reach to an equal level once the heterojunction interfaces are formed, and then the internal electric field between the two semiconductors will be constructed due to carriers’ migration. Subsequently, the photo-generated e- on CB potential of LaVO4 will combine with the photo-generated h+ on VB potential of CN, the e- with stronger reduction ability and the h+ with stronger oxidation ability are remained on the CB level of CN and VB level of LaVO4, respectively. This LaVO4/CN heterostructure can effectively suppress the recombination of e- and h+, further enhance the utilization of photoexcited carriers to improve the photocatalytic ability. Finally, the e- on CB level of CN can split water to H2 with the help of Pt co-catalyst, and the h+ on VB level of LaVO4 can oxidize FFA to the valuable furfural. The proposed photocatalytic mechanism of LaVO4/CN heterojunction is consistent well with the above H2-evolution performance."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, an efficient 2D/2D LaVO4/CN heterostructure was constructed for photocatalytic H2-evolution coupled with production of high value-added furfural, in which FFA was used as an oxidation agent for the h+ half-reaction. The square LaVO4 nanosheets self-assembled on the thin-layer CN nanosheets, resulting in abundant 2D/2D hetero-interfaces, which is favorable for effective transport of e- and h+. Thus, the LaVO4/CN heterostructure exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance, with a H2-evolution rate of 0.287 mmol g−1 h−1, a furfural production rate of 0.95 mmol g−1 h−1 and 22.16% H2-evolution AQE at 400 nm. Moreover, a reasonable Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism of LaVO4/CN hybrid is proposed based on our verification experiments. This work provides an efficient photocatalyst for H2-evolution, and also offers a new strategy to effectively utilize the photo-generated h+ in the reaction."
