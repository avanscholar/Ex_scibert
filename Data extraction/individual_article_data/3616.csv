0,Introduction,"Hydrogen must be made from renewable resources if its use is to impact global CO2 levels. The sustainable generation of hydrogen may be achieved by a range of technologies, including biological processes. These utilise algae and bacteria in photobioreactors in the light, or bacteria growing fermentatively in the dark in bioreactors resembling the well-characterised anaerobic digestion process [1,2]. Suitable substrates for dark fermentative hydrogen production include carbohydrate-rich crops and food industry wastes [3,4]. CO2 produced by metabolism of these renewable biomass sources is carbon-neutral as it is part of the natural carbon cycle. Since dark fermentative hydrogen production processes take in non-sterile feedstock, a common approach has been to use mixed microflora derived from natural sources, often enriched in hydrogen-producing clostridial species [5]. Much laboratory work has used batch processes, particularly to investigate nutrient requirements and obtain hydrogen yields from particulate feedstocks. Pure cultures of clostridia were used in batch processes at industrial scale for many years to produce the solvents acetone, butanol and ethanol [6]. Study of conditions used in batch processes [7,8] to yield solvents is relevant, since the inverse of these conditions is presumably required in continuous processes to produce H2. However, batch processes involve regular down-time and non-steady-state conditions, hence continuous processes are potentially more attractive. Some challenges for optimising continuous processes were summarised by Hawkes et al. [5] and there has been considerable progress in research in the last few years, although an economically and technically feasible process is yet to be established. Both mesophilic and thermophilic continuous dark fermentative hydrogen production have been investigated. Thermophilic operation may be particularly appropriate when meeting legislation for treatment of feedstock containing pathogens or coupled to a process with associated waste heat. Otherwise, because of the energy input needed, thermophilic operation is less likely to be the technically and economically favoured option. Substrates studied for fermentative hydrogen production have mostly been rich in carbohydrates, although hydrogen production from proteins has also been reported [4]. The maximum theoretical hydrogen yield from fermentation of carbohydrates is 4 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose converted, with acetic acid as the fermentation end product. In practice yields are lower, as some carbohydrate is converted to bacterial cells, and end-products other than acetic acid, e.g. butyric acid, are formed. When using mixed microflora, experimental conditions to suppress methanogenic activity (which consumes hydrogen) and favour hydrogen producing metabolism are necessary. These include heat treating the inoculum to select for spore-forming clostridia, optimising operating conditions such as hydraulic retention time (HRT), pH and substrate concentration and reducing hydrogen partial pressure [5,9,10]. A stage after the fermentative hydrogen-production process is required to convert the fermentation end-products to other forms of energy or to further amounts of hydrogen with a theoretical maximum of 12 mol H 2 mol - 1 of hexose mineralised. At present the most near-market alternative for this second stage is anaerobic digestion to methane. If cost-effective photobioreactors or microbial fuel cells were developed, these could produce more hydrogen or electricity, respectively, in the second stage and may prove attractive options. This paper reviews current progress in continuous processes utilising mixed mesophilic microflora and highlights gaps in our knowledge affecting practical applications."
1,Microbiology and biochemistry of dark fermentative hydrogen production,"Like the mature technologies of activated sludge and anaerobic digestion for wastewater treatment, hydrogen production using mixed microflora was demonstrated before advances in molecular biology allowed study of the microbial communities responsible. Many microorganisms are able to produce hydrogen from carbohydrates but molecular techniques have mainly identified clostridial species [11–13]. An early study by Fang et al. [14] analysed the microbial species present in a hydrogen producing culture (CSTR, pH 5.5, 36 ∘ C , 6.6hHRT, sewage sludge inoculum) with glucose. They found that 64.4% of all clones present were Clostridiaceae, with 43.8% being most closely related to Clostridium cellulosi, 12.5% most closely related to Clostridium acetobutylicum and 8.3% most closely related to Clostridium tyrobutyricum. 18.8% of all clones were affiliated with Enterobacteriaceae, and 3.1% with Streptococcus bovis. A study of granular sludge ( 26 ∘ C , pH5.5, 6hHRT, sucrose as substrate) showed 69% of the clones associated with four Clostridium species and 13.5% with Sporolactobacillus racemicus in the Bacillus/Staphylococcus group [15]. Clostridia are versatile and can utilise a range of carbohydrate substrates including starch, cellulose and hemicellulose [16]. Thus, unlike bioethanol production, complex substrates may be used for hydrogen production without pretreatment. However, metabolic flexibility of clostridia allows the production of a range of end-products which may lower the H2 yield from the theoretical maximum of 4 mol mol - 1 hexose achieved when acetate is the sole fermentation end product (Eq. (1)): (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 . Hydrogen production in clostridia is the property of hydrogenase enzymes. These transfer electrons from reduced ferredoxin or NADH to protons to regenerate the oxidised forms ( Fd ox and NAD + ) required so that glycolysis and oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate can proceed to generate ATP. The effect of hydrogen partial pressure on these reactions is summarised by Agenent et al. [17]. If the hydrogen partial pressure is sufficiently low, NADH may be oxidised via hydrogenase, producing H2 up to the maximum theoretical yield of 4 mol mol - 1 hexose consumed and a maximal yield of ATP. However, under normal reactor conditions, most of the NADH will be oxidised in reactions producing reduced fermentation end products, such as butyrate [4,17] with a lower molar hydrogen yield (Eq. (2)) and lower ATP yield: (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 . Many continuous experiments with mixed microflora show acetate and butyrate as major end products, with butyrate in excess of acetate [18–20]. Kim et al. [13] found during operation of a CSTR on sucrose ( 10 – 60 g COD l - 1 , pH 5.5, 12hHRT) that butyrate to acetate ( B / A ) ratios were directly proportional to H2 yields as mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose consumed. Thus B / A ratios might be a quantitative indicator of substrate metabolism and H2 production. The B / A ratios of Kim et al. [13] are given on a COD basis and when converted to a molar basis are between 0.64 and 3.69. From an example of known stoichiometry, the molar B / A ratio of 1.5 from Eq. (3) [21]: (3) 4 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 3 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 CH 3 COOH + 8 CO 2 + 10 H 2 would result in a theoretical molar H2 yield of 2.5 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose fermented. However, Kim et al. [13] experimentally predict a molar yield around 0.85; with approximately 11% of sucrose converted to microbial biomass and 7.4–10.6% to ethanol, a large amount of hexose must have been converted to other metabolic products to account for this discrepancy. The B / A ratio of 1.2 on a TOC basis (corresponding to a ratio on a molar basis of 0.6 and on a COD basis of 1.5) reported by Fang and Liu [18] in a CSTR operating at 7 g l - 1 glucose (pH 5.5, 6hHRT) gave a molar H2 yield of 2.1, rather than around 0.65 as predicted by Kim et al. [13]. Further work is thus needed to clarify the nature and usefulness of the relationship of B / A ratio to molar hydrogen yield. Although production of the reduced end product ethanol from hexose consumes NADH, Ren's group has shown that a fermentation producing ethanol and acetate from carbohydrate in a molar ratio close to 1 is favourable for hydrogen production [22,23]. The reactor, with flocculant sludge at pH 4.5 (approx.) could operate on molasses at a high organic loading rate (OLR), giving 5.6 m 3 H 2 m - 3 reactor d - 1 at an OLR of 68.2 kg COD m - 3 reactor d - 1 . Although a molar H2 yield per mol hexose fermented was not given, from the reaction stoichiometry the theoretical maximum is 2 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose fermented [24]: (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + CH 3 CH 2 OH + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 . Lactate and propionate can be produced either by clostridia themselves or by other bacteria competing in the mixed microflora, lowering the hydrogen yield. Clostridia such as C. aceticum can lower the H2 yield by converting H2 and CO2 to acetate or can convert hexose directly to acetate alone by the process of homoacetogenesis (Eqs. (5) and (6)) [25]: (5) 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O , (6) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 CH 3 COOH . Thus increased acetate production need not signal an improved H2 yield [13]. During operation on a particulate starch substrate (pH 5.2, 30 ∘ C , 18hHRT, heat-treated inoculum) Hussy et al. [19] observed a doubling in acetate concentration not linked to an increased H2 yield. When sparged with N2 to lower the H2 and CO2 partial pressure, such an increase in acetate was not seen. A number of bacteria including clostridia are homoacetogenic and the threshold concentrations of H2 and CO2 required are not well characterised [25]. The influence of homoacetogenesis on H2 yield and conditions which might suppress homoacetogenic H2 consumption deserve further study. The metabolic reactions serving to lower the molar hydrogen yield by the production of reduced fermentation end products may be the result of a shift in metabolism within species in the microflora or a shift in the abundance of acetogenic or lactate-, ethanol- or propionate-producing species. Iyer et al. [26] and Xing et al. [27] appear to be the first to follow bacterial population shifts under different conditions in a H2-producing reactor. Iyer et al. [26] studied a CSTR at pH 5.5 operating on glucose. At 10hHRT only Clostridiaceae were detected while at 30hHRT the populations were more diverse and included Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. At 10hHRT when the temperature was changed from 30 to 37 ∘ C there was a population shift from populations related to Clostridium acidisoli to C. acetobutylicum. Xing et al. [27] followed communities in a CSTR operating on molasses at a low pH with acidophilic bacteria from sewage, which established an ethanol-acetate-hydrogen producing community after 28 days. The hydrogen production rate increased with the increase of Ethanologenbacterium sp., Clostridium sp. and Spirochaetes. Some types of Clostridium sp., Acidovorax sp., Kluyvera sp. and Bacteriodes were dominant populations throughout. It appeared that hydrogen production depended not only on hydrogen producers but also on co-metabolism in the whole community. Lin et al. [12] using a CSTR with 20 g l - 1 sucrose COD at HRTs between 2 and 12h showed a Clostridium ramosum related species present at all HRTs, but a Clostridium pasteurinum related species to be present at 12, 8 and 4hHRT only. A transition in the community structure as HRT was decreased to 0.5h in a stirred granular reactor showed a dominant species with high similarity to a C. pasteurianum strain associated with an increased specific hydrogen production rate and referred to by Wu et al. [28] as the “superstar” hydrogen-producing species in the consortium used. Kim et al. [13] studying a CSTR operating at 12hHRT with different sucrose concentrations found a predominance of clostridial species, one of which at 10 g l - 1 sucrose COD was related to an acetogen, and at 60 g l - 1 sucrose COD a band related to the spore-forming, lactic acid-producing Bacillus racemilacticus. These species have a deleterious effect on hydrogen production and it is interesting that they predominate at different substrate concentrations. Genetic analysis can add value to H2 producing technology if the species identified have well characterised optimum operating conditions which can be implemented to improve hydrogen production. As molecular techniques develop, information on species abundance and on proteomics indicating changes in metabolism with operating conditions could prove particularly useful in optimisation studies. The yield coefficient for microbial biomass generation in hydrogen-producing reactors is an important parameter for fundamental considerations. It is related to the amount of energy made available as ATP per unit of substrate fermented, which depends on the fermentation end products and hence the reactor operating conditions. The degree of conversion of substrate to biomass influences both the amount of substrate available for hydrogen production and the amount of biomass generated for disposal or for passage to a second stage such as an anaerobic digester. Kim et al. [13] experimentally investigated the relationship between sucrose consumed and microbial biomass produced, measured as volatile suspended solids (VSS) in a CSTR at pH 5.4. A biomass or sludge yield of 0.08 g VSS g - 1 sucrose COD consumed was determined. A sludge yield of 0.21 g VSS g - 1 glucose was determined for a CSTR at pH 5.5, 36 ∘ C , 6hHRT, consuming 27% of influent TOC [18]. An average sludge yield of 0.20 g VSS g - 1 sucrose was determined for a granular sludge operated at pH 5.5, 26 ∘ C , between 5 and 28hHRT at a constant OLR of 25 g l - 1 d - 1 (influent sucrose 5 – 30 g l - 1 ) [29] and a yield coefficient of 0.1 g VSS g - 1 COD was given by Chang and Lin [30] for a granular reactor operating on 20 g COD l - 1 sucrose between 4 and 24hHRT. Yu and Mu [31] found the yield coefficient of H2-producing granules operating on sucrose at pH 4.4 was 0.334 g VSS g - 1 COD. It can be seen from this range that experimental work should be performed to provide the yield coefficient for a variety of operating conditions and fermentation end products, to give data for modelling [10] and to identify conditions which minimise excess microbial biomass production for practical operation."
2,Inocula and start-up for hydrogen production,"A range of natural sources has been used to provide inocula for continuous H2 production by mixed microflora, including sewage sludge, soils [5], cattle dung compost [32] and river sediment [33]. Inocula are commonly pretreated to select for spore formers and destroy methanogens. Lin and Chou [34] investigated acid treatment (pH 3–4 with HCl for 24h) of waste activated sludge from a municipal sewage treatment works. This inoculum has been used to develop the carrier-induced granular sludge bed reactor [35,36]. In a later paper, Lin et al. [12] recommended base-enrichment rather than acid enrichment, and produced a seed sludge with no methanogenic activity after incubation of waste activated sludge from a municipal sewage treatment works with 1M NaOH for 24h. However, spore-former enrichment by heat treatment is more common, although there is variation in the temperature attained and the time for which it is applied. Heat treatment of the inoculum at industrial scale would be technically more difficult than acid or alkali treatment so it is important to determine whether it improves hydrogen production in practice. Han et al. [20] used heat treatment at pilot scale, starting up four 50l batch reactors on food waste every 8 days. Heat treatment may prevent development of non-spore-forming propionate producers which convert hexose without forming H2 [37,38]. However, Hussy et al. [39] used non-heat treated anaerobically digested sludge to establish H2 production from sucrose and sugar beet within 5 days, in two experiments which remained stable for 45 and 32 days before termination because of time constraints. Other workers obtaining H2 production using non-heat treated sludge include Lin and Jo [40] although a period of acclimation was required. By contrast Shizas and Bagley [41] found with non-heat treated anaerobic digester sludge inoculum that operating a CSTR at pH 5.5 and 10hHRT was not sufficient to prevent methanogenesis for more than approximately one week. Further work is thus needed to establish whether the additional technical complexity of heat-treating the inoculum at industrial scale is cost-effective. The heat treatment of inocula not only reduces the non-spore-forming microorganisms present but also activates clostridial spores to commence germination. Spores of clostridial strains used for industrial solvent production were routinely activated by heat-shock. Heat alters the germination receptor so that it is more responsive to the presence of germinants. When using a pre-treated inoculum, germination of spores is allowed to occur in a batch phase before continuous operation so that wash-out of the inoculum does not occur. The reactor headspace is commonly flushed with inert gas, but it is not known if this is necessary, since germination of clostridial spores is generally less susceptible to oxygen inhibition than subsequent growth [42]. Germination has been induced by amino acids, sugars, ribosides, enzymes and hydrostatic pressure, but often a species specific combination of germinants was required [42–44] e.g. alanine and lactate for Clostridium botulinum spores. Faster and more successful start-up might be achieved if the required germinants were known. Information on restart up after periods without feed is also needed. It is not yet clear whether H2 producing reactors can be efficiently restarted after shut-down by providing conditions favouring germination, or whether re-inoculation is preferable. This would be valuable process information to obtain. During continuous operation sporulation has to be avoided in CSTR reactors, since it will result in washout of clostridia [19] and could allow non-spore formers to take over. Exposure to oxygen triggers sporulation in continuous cultures of some species e.g. Clostridium beijerinckii. Clostridium strain C7 was more tolerant to trace concentrations of oxygen and to nutrient stress [45] while carbon starvation gave sporulation with C. cellulolyticum on cellobiose [46]. The accumulation of acetic and butyric acid fermentation end-products may cause clostridia to switch to solvent production and sporulate [47]. However, exact information is lacking on the adverse conditions causing sporulation."
3,Nutrient requirement,"As well as N and P, nutrients known to be significant for efficient hydrogen production include S and Fe, significant components in hydrogen-producing hydrogenases. For most laboratory studies with pure substrates, nutrient concentrations were presumably well in excess to ensure carbon limitation, though few papers actually state this. The simple salts medium chosen by Zoetemeyer et al. [48] was said to guarantee excess of all essential nutrients other than glucose and thereby allow glucose-limited growth of the bacteria. Most laboratory work to date seeking to optimise nutrient addition has used batch cultures. More information is needed on minimum amounts of nutrients needed for continuous operation. Although some clostridia are nitrogen fixing, laboratory studies with defined carbohydrates all use a nitrogen source and many report yields of more than 1 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose with addition of mineral nutrients only. Whilst Ren et al. [49] report hydrogen production from sugar or corn starch with addition only of N and P salts, most studies have used more complex mineral salts solutions. Six examples are given in Table 1 of element concentrations and COD:N and COD:P ratios in studies using defined media with glucose [18,48,50,51] starch [19] or sucrose [52] as substrate. Table 1 shows COD:N ratios varying between 11:1 and 73:1; Ren et al. [49] reported hydrogen production at an even higher COD:N of 160–200:1. From Table 1 COD:P ratios show an even wider variation from 73:1 to 970:1. Though the earliest work in Table 1 [48] did not measure hydrogen yield, all other hydrogen yields are between 1.4 and 2.1 mol mol - 1 hexose. Thus reasonable hydrogen yields were obtained despite the wide variety of nutrients added. Apart from a N and P source, only K, Mg and Fe are common to all recipes in Table 1. There is a 20-fold variation in the amount of Fe added with respect to hexose concentration, One or more workers did not add one or more of the elements Ni, Ca, B, Mo, Zn, Co, Cu, Mn or I. Mu and Yu [52] exceptionally did not add a S source to the medium. The actual concentration of all elements in the reactor for a defined medium includes tap water concentrations and impurities in reagents used. Our information on true concentrations is even less certain when using substrates from crops or food wastes. As the technology is applied to a greater range of substrates, studies of nutrient requirement will become more necessary for process optimisation and cost-effectiveness. The minimum amounts of N, P, S, Fe and trace minerals needed for efficient H2 production in continuous reactors at various conditions, e.g. pH and substrate concentrations, must be determined."
4,Process pH and HRT,"A number of workers have used low pH, short retention time in a CSTR or a combination of both to exclude methanogenesis [9]. Fang and Liu [18] observed development of methane production in a CSTR operating with a mesophilic hydrogen producing mixed culture when the pH was increased to 6.0, even at the short HRT of 6h, as methanogens may be able to attach to the reactor. The findings of other workers at pH > 6.0 , however, contradict this. Chang et al. [53], with acid-pretreated inoculum, operated a fixed-bed reactor where the bacteria were deliberately retained at pH 6.7 and found methane not detectable. It is possible that a methanogenic population had not developed in the time the reactors operated (16 days). Lin et al. [12] operated a CSTR on 20 g l - 1 sucrose for over 350 days at pH 6.8 between 2 and 12hHRT with no methane detected, giving a maximum molar hydrogen yield of 1.75 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose. With heat treated inoculum and brewery waste in a CSTR over a 10 month period, Fan et al. [32] did not detect methane even at conditions of pH 6.5 and 18hHRT. Lee et al. [54] reported excellent performance of a granular sludge bed type reactor at pH 6.7 on sucrose, as did Wu et al. [28] at pH 6.6. Experience in the laboratory so far suggests that there may be no problem with methanogenic population build-up, even in retained biomass reactors [55]. However, more experience with real wastewaters which may themselves contain methanogens is required. The above examples suggest acceptable hydrogen yields can be obtained at pH around 6.5–6.8. However, using a mixed culture on glucose, Zoetmeyer et al. [56] reported strong lactic acid production at pH > 6 and increasing acetate/formate/ethanol production with pH ⩾ 7 . Horiuchi et al. [57,58] report that the dominant metabolism in a mesophilic CSTR, seeded with anaerobic digester sludge operating on glucose, changed slowly from butyrate/acetate to acetate/propionate production when the pH was increased to 8 or above, attributed to a shift in microbial population. Onset of propionate production was also observed by Fang and Liu [18] when the pH was increased to 7.0 in a hydrogen producing CSTR on glucose (6hHRT, 36 ∘ C ) and conversion also decreased at pH < 5.5 . It can be concluded that the H2-producing butyrate–acetate metabolism is more competitive at pH ⩽ 6 than at near neutral pH. Where a range of pH has been tested in continuous conditions, investigations point towards an optimum for hydrogen production in the pH range 5.2–5.8 over a variety of HRT (6–32h) and substrate types (sucrose, starch and beer industry wastes) (Table 2). Where it is possible to calculate the molar H2 yield, where pure carbohydrate substrates are used, the maximum yield from Table 2 is in the range 2.15– 1.7 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose consumed, comparatively high yields. However, there is some evidence that acceptable hydrogen production may occur at even lower pH with strong production of ethanol (see Eq. (4)). Khanal et al. [61] using 8 g l - 1 sucrose and a sequencing batch reactor, stated that on lowering the operating pH from 5.2 to 4.8 the performance improved. In a review of their work, Ren et al. [23] gave the optimal operating conditions for the ethanol/acetate hydrogen-producing fermentation of molasses as pH 4.0–4.5, HRT 4–6h. Ren et al. [62] reported continuous hydrogen production with ethanol and acetate production at pH around 4.5 from CSTR experiments with a mixed culture and molasses at 30 ∘ C , whilst no gas was produced at pH 4.9. They claim propionic acid fermentation is dominant in the pH range 5–6. Wang et al. [63] also state that avoiding pH 5.5 and working at pH 4.5 could produce more hydrogen without propionic acid accumulation. A H2 yield of 26 mol kg - 1 COD removed was obtained from molasses [22] with effluent pH between 4.5 and 5 and an acetate:ethanol ratio on a molar basis of about 1. With an effluent pH between 4.3 and 4.5, Mu and Yu [52] working with a granular sludge bed reactor and sucrose as substrate ( 4.7 g l - 1 , 18hHRT) obtained a molar H2 yield of 1.44 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose. Butyrate and ethanol were the dominant end-products on a molar basis. It is thus clear that reactors can operate at pH around 4.5, although with a slightly lower H2 yield than those at 5.2–5.7 (Table 2). Further advantages are that, as stated by Hussy et al. [19], at pH < 5 homoacetogenesis is unlikely to occur and that operation at the lowest possible pH would reduce alkali requirements. Zoetemeyer et al. [56] found NaOH requirements for an acidogenic CSTR fed on 10 g l - 1 glucose increased by 50% when operating pH increased from 4.5 to 5.0 and by more than 100% when the pH was increased from 4.5 to 5.7. However, the proportion of undissociated acetic and butyric acids increases as the pH falls towards the pK a s of 4.78 and 4.81, respectively. The undissociated forms can pass across the cell membrane, collapsing the membrane pH gradient, and the cell will convert to solvent formation, sporulate or die [47]. At pH < 5 it was observed that hydrogen production switched to solvent production in a mixed culture on soluble starch [59]. The shift to solvent production at the end of batch process may be a mechanism for the cell to detoxify from undissociated acid end products. Van Ginkel and Logan [60] reviewed the effects of undissociated acid concentration on the H2/solvent shift and concluded the threshold value cannot be predicted because of the wide range reported. Thus it is important to establish the optimal substrate concentration and minimum operating pH, a balance between lowest alkali cost and ion concentration in the effluent and highest H2 production. Short HRTs in CSTRs may wash out slow growing methanogens and can reduce reactor size and capital cost. In CSTRs operating on sucrose, optimum retention times of 8.0h [64], 8.7h [65], 12h [66] and 13.7h [29] have been reported for maximum hydrogen yields with inhibition of methanogenesis. For cellulose, Ueno et al. [67] reported continuous hydrogen production from a mixed culture at the long HRT of 3 days (pH 6.4), without encountering problems with methanogenesis. With soluble starch, statistical analysis of 23 short (approx. 4 day) experiments by a mixed culture indicated an optimum HRT between 12.7 and 20.2h, with 17hHRT giving maximum hydrogen yields [66]. Hussy et al. [19] operating on a particulate wheat starch showed that reducing HRT from 18 to 12h improved H2 yield without affecting starch removal efficiency. At the 12hHRT propionate production was lowered, suggesting wash-out of a non-clostridial propionate-forming community. For beer processing wastes Lay et al. [11] statistically analysed 16 short (4 day) CSTR experiments to determine the optimum pH and HRT for H2 production and found a maximum specific H2 production rate of 0.019 l H 2 g - 1 VSS h - 1 should occur at pH 5.8 and 32hHRT (Table 2). Fan et al. [32] evaluated five HRTs and three pHs in a CSTR at 37 ∘ C using the bottom layer from a beer manufacturing plant and showed that maximum H2 production occurred at 18hHRT, pH 5.5 and OLR of 70 g COD l - 1 d - 1 . For CSTRs operating on more complex substrates, starch, brewery waste and waste yeast, longer HRTs may be needed than for glucose (Table 2)."
5,Feedstock,"Hydrogen production from soluble and particulate starch and cellulose [19,59,67] from xylose [68], from sugar beet [39] and the wastewater from a sugar beet refinery [63] and the bottom layer from a beer manufacturing plant [32] has been demonstrated in CSTR experiments using mesophilic mixed microflora. Hydrogen production from other carbohydrate-rich complex materials has been shown mainly in batch conditions, presumably because of the difficulty of delivering particulate matter to continuous reactors at laboratory scale. Hydrogen production from dining hall food waste as a solid has been studied in a mesophilic leaching bed reactor [69] and solid waste as a slurry has been used in CSTRs fed daily by the draw-and-fill method [70,71]. Substrate concentrations used in continuous H2 production with mixed microflora in CSTRs have until recently been commonly around 10 g l - 1 carbohydrate. Higher substrate concentrations should allow more energy-efficient operation but product inhibition is likely to set the upper limit. With glucose concentrations between 2.5 and 10 g COD l - 1 and HRTs of 1–10h, increased OLR decreased H2 yield from 2.8 to 1.7 mol H 2 mol - 1 glucose at 30 ∘ C and pH 5.5 [72]. This effect was mostly related to increased glucose concentration rather than changes in HRT and was attributed to H2 inhibition. However, Kim et al. [13], investigating the effect of a range of sucrose concentrations ( 10 – 60 g l - 1 as COD) in a CSTR at pH 5.4, 12hHRT, found the hydrogen yield at hexose concentrations below 20 g COD l - 1 decreased. Above 35 g COD l - 1 , overload occurred, with the maximum molar H2 yield of 1.22 mol mol - 1 hexose consumed at an inlet sucrose concentration of 30 g COD l - 1 . A decrease in performance in terms of molar H2 yield at 40 g l - 1 was noted by van Ginkel and Logan [60] when comparing operation of a CSTR on 10, 20, 30 and 40 g l - 1 glucose at 2.5 and 10hHRTs. Kyazze et al. [73] examined continuous operation at pH 5.2, 12hHRT on 10 – 50 g l - 1 sucrose. Stable operation was obtained with influent sucrose concentration up to 40 g l - 1 sucrose within 5 days from start-up. At 50 g l - 1 the system was less able to maintain steady state but sparging with N2 improved stability. The H2 yield decreased from 1.7 ± 0.2 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose added at 10 g l - 1 sucrose to 0.8 ± 0.1 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose added at 50 g l - 1 . Thus the upper limit of substrate concentration for sucrose or glucose without a marked decrease in molar hydrogen yield may be around 30 g l - 1 . The level of undissociated acetic and butyric acid (a function of pH and substrate level) as well as the H2 concentration may set the upper limit of substrate concentration. The initiation of solventogenesis above an undissociated butyric acid concentration of 13mM was suggested experimentally by Van Ginkel and Logan [60]. Kyazze et al. [73] report that adding butyric acid to a stable reactor to raise the free butyric acid level from 33 to 63mM stopped gas production completely, although the reactor recovered 84h after the spike. Similarly, near-complete H2 production inhibition was observed by Van Ginkel and Logan [60] with added acetic and butyric acids at pH 5.0 to give undissociated acid concentrations in the reactor of 50 and 63mM, respectively. Inhibition of biohydrogen production by ammonia, which is also related to pH, may be a factor in the fermentation of animal manures. Salerno et al. [74] showed that increasing ammonia-N from 0.8 to 7.8 g l - 1 gave a progressive decrease of molar H2 yield from 1.9 mol mol - 1 hexose to 1.1 mol mol - 1 hexose in a CSTR operating on glucose at pH 5.5 and 10hHRT. It should be noted that the feedstock entering the reactor should not be allowed to pre-ferment in a holding tank [61,71] as this lowers hydrogen production. For commercial operations, it will be necessary for the feedstock to be delivered in a fresh state to the reactor, a difference from anaerobic digester technology. There is a need for industrially-significant complex substrates to be investigated in continuous operation to determine the relation between substrate concentration, pH, OLR and H2 production. In view of the particulate nature of many such substrates, this is likely to require pilot-scale work."
6,Hydrogen and CO2 partial pressure,"In a natural environment or a single stage anaerobic digester, hydrogenotrophic bacteria such as methanogens keep the hydrogen partial pressure low. In an acidogenic reactor hydrogen and CO2 levels can be lowered artificially [5]. Stirring, gas sparging and extraction through membranes may all affect H2 yield. In continuous experiments with a heat-shocked mixed culture, an increase in the speed of a magnetic mixer more than doubled the hydrogen production rate [59]. Overall, stirring clearly aids hydrogen production [75]. More physico-chemical information on the effect of stirring would be useful for reactor design. Sparging with N2 at around 15 times the hydrogen production rate in experiments with mixed cultures on glucose ( 35 ∘ C , pH 6, 8.5hHRT) increased hydrogen yields from 0.85 to 1.43 mol H 2 mol - 1 glucose [51]. Hussy et al. [39] showed for CSTR operation on 10 g l - 1 sucrose, sparging with N2 increased H2 yield from 1.0 ± 0.1 to 1.7 ± 0.2 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose. Kyazze et al. [73] in similar experiments extending the concentration range, reported that sparging with N2 improved the H2 yield by at least 35% at 40 g l - 1 sucrose and 33% at 50 g l - 1 , and also improved the stability of operation at 50 g l - 1 sucrose. With particulate starch, Hussy et al. [19] found sparging with N2 to reduce H2 in the off-gas from 50% to 7% increased H2 yield from 1.3 to 1.9 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose converted. It is thus proven that sparging does improve H2 yield, and may improve process stability, but an assessment of the overall process must be made to determine whether dilution of the H2 stream is acceptable. A range of membranes for separation of gas components are commercially available and are commonly used to purify hydrogen for use in fuel cells. Teplyakov et al. [76] have used a system of two polyvinyltrimethylsilane membranes to separate components of gas produced in a biohydrogen reactor, achieving gas purities of 90% for hydrogen and 99% for carbon dioxide. More research is needed to develop low-cost gas purification systems at appropriate scales which deliver H2 at the specifications required. Continuous sparging of the reactor to lower H2 partial pressure may use other process gases such as methane and/or CO2 from anaerobic digestion or recycled gas after hydrogen has been stripped. Liu et al. [71], using biogas from an anaerobic digestion second stage, stripped CO2 and H2S and sparged the first stage hydrogen-producing reactor with the resulting methane-rich gas. An 88% increase in hydrogen production rate resulted. Evidence from a batch study suggested reducing CO2 content may reduce acetogenesis and increase H2 yield [77]. However, recent results from Kim et al. [78] with a CSTR operating on 20 g COD l - 1 sucrose (pH 5.3, 12hHRT), comparing sparging with CO2 and with N2, showed CO 2 sparging was more effective. Contrary to expectations, microbial analysis indicated acetogens and lactic acid bacteria were inhibited by the high CO2 partial pressure and substrate conversion to microbial biomass was reduced. These results could prove useful in industrial situations if they can be extrapolated to other substrates. It is possible that comparison of the results of Park et al. [77] and Kim et al. [78] highlight differences which may exist between experimentation in batch and continuous conditions."
7,Reactor types,"CSTRs are the most frequently used reactor type for continuous fermentative H2 production. However, a range of other reactor types exist, based on those available for methanogenic anaerobic digestion. High rate reactors are widely used in methane production in order to retain large amounts of bacterial catalyst in the reactor as flocs, films or granules or by membranes, allowing shorter HRTs (higher hydraulic loads) without wash-out of slow growing methanogens. In H2-producing reactors, retention of bacteria in the reactor should provide more catalytic power allowing greater OLRs and volumetric H2 production rates. The difficulty may be that slower-growing methanogens and propionate producers are also retained, decreasing H2 yield, but there seems little evidence so far that this occurs. Fed-batch (draw and fill) operation of CSTRs can result from manual feeding at laboratory scale. Fan and Chen [79] using a brewery waste showed that a CSTR at 8hHRT can recover from repeated replacement of 25% of the volume, but simulating the fed-batch approach in this way gave variability in H2 production. Youn and Shin [70] used daily fed-batch reactors to examine H2 production from slurried food waste. At 35 ∘ C , 5 day HRT, pH 5.5, OLR 3 – 8 gVS l - 1 d - 1 , methane was formed, lowering H2 yield and operation at 55 ∘ C was preferable. Liu et al. [71] fed household solid waste slurry (7.5% VS) twice daily to a hydrogen-producing reactor at a 2 day HRT, 37 ∘ C , pH 5.2 and found effective prevention of methanogenesis. Sequencing batch reactors in which the microorganisms are retained by settling in a quiescent settling period ( S ) inside the reactor also operate on a fed-batch system and require optimisation of the R (reaction period) to S ratio. Lin and Jo [40] with a sequencing batch reactor ( 35 ∘ C , pH 6.7, OLR 82 g sucrose l - 1 reactor d - 1 , R / S 5.6) obtained (at standard temperature and pressure) a yield of 1.3 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose compared to 1.15 mol H 2 mol - 1 hexose obtained by Kyazze et al. [73] with a CSTR at similar OLR. The volumetric production rate and specific H2 production rates from the sequencing batch reactor were comparable with CSTR values, while the upper value of VSS was higher (Table 3 ). Lin and Chou [34] using the same sequencing batch system report the high alkalinities occurring ( > 6 g l - 1 as CaCO3), presumably due to operation at pH 6.7. This may give rise to problems of alkali consumption in the overall process. Khanal et al. [61] used a sequencing batch reactor operating on sucrose with a portion of the settled effluent returned to the reactor after heat treatment. They suggest a sequencing batch reactor operating in a “feast and fast” mode might favour spore germination and also flush out inhibitory unionised acids. The authors do not say what portion of the settled effluent was heat-treated in continuous operation, but suggest the 14 fold increase in hydrogen production arising may be due to the promotion of germination. Food waste from a Korean dining hall [20] was used in the BIOCELL process (see Section 9) with leaching bed reactors operated at varying liquid throughput appropriate to the rate of VFA production in a 6 day batch process [69]. The process yielded H2 continuously as four reactors were used sequentially. At an OLR of 11.9 kg VS m - 3 reactor d - 1 , a volumetric production rate of 0.15 l H 2 l - 1 reactor h - 1 was obtained. Little is known about process optimisation for mesophilic H2 production from solid wastes such as food wastes. The ability of microorganisms to form flocs retained in a settler is the basis of the aerobic activated sludge process. H2-forming mixed cultures also form flocs in continuous culture, and the floc properties from a reactor at 23 ∘ C , pH 5.5, HRT 4.5h have been examined by Zhang et al. [80]. Dense, relatively impermeable flocs with mean sizes increasing with OLR had settling properties in reasonable agreement with Stokes’ law. The lower temperature used may have favoured floc formation. Methods of retaining bacterial biomass in reactors include immobilisation. Sewage sludge after acid pre-treatment was immobilised by gel entrapment and used in 24 repeat fed-batch experiments with 20 g l - 1 sucrose. A specific H2 production rate of 0.24 l g - 1 VSS h - 1 was obtained, rising to the very high value of 6.08 l g - 1 VSS h - 1 with repeated use [81]. However, as the authors say, the stability and durability of the immobilisation system is a more critical issue than the production rate. Silicone-immobilised sludge was used as inoculum in a stirred reactor and may have provided a reservoir of bacteria during operation at high hydraulic loading [28]. Biofilm attachment on solid supports are common in anaerobic digesters. Kim et al. [82] using poly-vinyl alcohol as solid support medium (non-heat-treated sewage sludge seed, pH 5.0, 20hHRT, 20 g l - 1 glucose) found variable H2 production in a 30 day experiment, with approximately 4 g l - 1 biomass retained in the reactor. Biofilms seeded with acid-shocked sewage sludge were developed on activated carbon and sucrose ( 17.8 g l - 1 ) fed to reactors at 0.5–5hHRT, 35 ∘ C , pH 6.7 giving a maximum volumetric production rate of 7.4 l H 2 l - 1 reactor h - 1 at 0.5hHRT [85] and 1.32 l H 2 l - 1 reactor h - 1 at 1hHRT [53] (Table 3). At higher substrate concentration performance declined due to competition from non-hydrogen producers but thermal treatment restored H2 production rates, suggesting spore-formers were part of the attached biofilm. Thus activated carbon has so far given better performance than polyvinyl alcohol as support medium. The retention of bacteria in the reactor by a membrane has been developed for aerobic and anaerobic biological wastewater treatment, Oh et al. [83] coupled a cross-flow membrane to a CSTR ( 10 g l - 1 glucose, pH 5.5, 26 ∘ C ). Intermittent backpulsing was used to limit fouling. At system HRTs of 3.3 and 5h and solids retention time (SRT) of 3.3 to 48h, no methane was in the biogas. At 3.3hHRT using the membrane to give a 12h SRT increased total suspended solids (TSS) from 2.2 to 5.8 g l - 1 and volumetric production rate from 0.30 to 0.37 l H 2 h - 1 l - 1 reactor, assuming 58.5% H2 in the biogas. At a 5hHRT using the membrane to give a SRT of 48h increased TSS from 2.4 to 8.8 g l - 1 but volumetric H2 production rate and yield decreased. Fouling and high capital and operating costs are cited as disadvantages of membrane bioreactors and so this may not be the technology of choice. In methanogenic UASBs, well-settling and mechanically stable granules form spontaneously, requiring the presence of calcium. Fang et al. [15] demonstrated that H2-producing biomass could also develop granules with high activity. In a 90 day experiment (non-heat treated sewage sludge inoculum, 26 ∘ C , 6hHRT, 2 – 12 g l - 1 sucrose) granules were visible by day 15 and by day 60 the reactor was operating on an OLR of 49 g l - 1 d - 1 at 97% conversion of sucrose with a H2 yield of 2.2 mol mol - 1 hexose converted (Table 3). Average granule diameter was 1.6mm. Chang and Lin [30] after a 39d start-up period from heat-treated sewage sludge developed visible granules after 120 days and produced H2 from 20 g l - 1 sucrose at 4–24hHRT, pH 6.7. VSS was 7.2 g l - 1 at 24h HRT and 3.6 g l - 1 at 4hHRT. H2 productivity was nearly constant between 8 and 20hHRT, with volumetric H2 production rate and specific H2 production rate peaking at 8hHRT (OLR 60 g l - 1 d - 1 , see Table 3). 0.1gVSS were generated/gCOD removed. The mean cell retention time was 22.2h. Operation at pH 6.7 gave rise to high alkalinities. The long start-up period for this type of UASB reactor should be noted as should the 8 month period of stable operation. In a 90 day experiment, Lee et al. [35], using granules developed after seeding with activated carbon bearing a H2-producing biofilm, found the shortest HRT at 17.8 g l - 1 sucrose giving successful operation was 1h at 35 ∘ C . Addition of 5.4 mg l - 1 Ca 2 + increased granule retention giving a biomass concentration of 15.5 g VSS l - 1 . At 1d HRT with 89% conversion of sucrose and H2 yield 1.2 mol mol - 1 hexose converted, the OLR of 427 g l - 1 d - 1 and H2 production rates resulting shown in Table 3 are higher than for most reactors. Lee et al. [36] showed spherical activated carbon was the most effective inducer for granular sludge formation, giving granules within 100h of start-up which reached 3–5mm diameter. Operation at 0.5hHRT (OLR 854 gl - 1 d - 1 ) for a short time period gave the very high maximal volumetric H2 production rate of 7.3 l l - 1 h - 1 (Table 3). Lee et al. [54] improved this rate at 98% sucrose conversion to 9.31 l l - 1 h - 1 in a carrier-induced granular sludge bed reactor of height:diameter ratio 8, with agitation. The highest volumetric hydrogen production rate to our knowledge ever reported is 15.09 l l - 1 h - 1 at 93% sucrose conversion, OLR 1708 g sucrose l - 1 d - 1 , in a novel continuously stirred granular sludge type reactor seeded with silicone-immobilised sludge[28] (Table 3). If these rates could be maintained, the granulation approach to conversion of soluble simple sugars is very promising. It appears that bacterial retention in H2-producing reactors as a biofilm or as activated carbon seeded granules can increase reactor bacterial biomass and allow higher OLRs without leading to retention of slow growing bacteria such as methanogens detrimental to H2 production, even at pH 6.6 [28]. One advantage of a retained biomass system is that technical problems in operation such as power failure will not result in washout of the population [53,54] unlike the situation in CSTRs. It should be noted that these studies have been performed on soluble substrates. Commercial methane-producing granule-containing UASB reactors are limited when operating on particulate substrates with high suspended solids contents, and this is likely to be also true for H2-producing granular reactors. For anaerobic digestion, biofilm reactors (upflow and downflow filters) have proved successful at dealing with particulate feedstocks. Thus it is likely that the reactor of choice for particulate substrates will be the biofilm reactor or, for lower volumetric H2 production rates, the CSTR. Values for OLR, volumetric H2 production rate, VSS in the reactor and specific H2 production rate for CSTR operation at laboratory scale are given in Table 3. It can be seen that the highest volumetric hydrogen production rate (7.3 and 15.09 l H 2 l - 1 reactor h - 1 ) were obtained from activated carbon seeded granules and a stirred granular sludge type reactor. These reactors also have the highest OLR (854 and 1708 g sucrose l - 1 reactor d - 1 ). With the exception of gel immobilised sludge, where durability was an issue, granular sludges had the highest specific H2 production rate and the highest amount of VSS per litre of reactor when operated on soluble substrates. Gavala et al. [55] compared H2-producing CSTR and UASB reactors operating on glucose, showing that the UASB configuration was more stable and had a higher volumetric H2 production rate. However, the molar H2 yield was higher in the CSTR for all conditions tested. As Yu and Mu [31] note, it may not be molar hydrogen yield but loading rate and volumetric hydrogen production rate on which reactor performance should be judged."
8,Second stage processes,"A second stage process is necessary to follow the dark fermentative stage, producing more hydrogen, methane or electricity. Thus the fermentative hydrogen reactor becomes part of a process train, analogous to a sewage treatment works, and the overall process must be optimised for energy production and environmental impact. Three possible second stage processes are discussed below."
9,Photofermentation,"9.1 Photofermentation Fang et al. [86] showed for the first time that mixed photofermentative microflora enriched from a reservoir could be used to convert acetate and butyrate effectively to H2. Previous work had concentrated on pure cultures. If technologically and cost effective photobioreactors were available, the two-stage dark and light H2 fermentation process using mixed microflora would be a promising method as it has a theoretical maximal molar H2 yield of 12 mol mol - 1 hexose converted in the two-stage process."
10,Microbial fuel cells,"9.2 Microbial fuel cells Microbial fuel cells (MFC) can utilise acetate and butyrate to produce electricity [87]. Oh and Logan [88] demonstrated the fermentation end-products of batch hydrogen production from a cereal processing wastewater high in sugar could be used by a MFC to produce electricity with 95% COD removal. MFC technology is currently at the research stage and still developing; the amount of electrons transferred to the anode in relation to the amount of electrons theoretically delivered by the substrate (Coulombic efficiency), surface area of electrodes required and power densities achievable remain to be established [89]. A recently reported option for enhancing biohydrogen recovery is the bio-electrochemically assisted microbial reactor (BEAMR) with low voltage conversion of acetate to H2 [90,91]. BEAMR technology is a modified application of microbial fuel cells with an additional small potential applied. It allows another process configuration in which additional hydrogen can be produced from fermentation end products, possibly with effluent then passing to a MFC to generate electricity. Either enhanced hydrogen production or electricity generation may prove an attractive option for the second stage as these technologies develop. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential for energy generation and wastewater treatment by the combined dark H2 fermentation/MFC technologies."
11,Anaerobic digestion,"9.3 Anaerobic digestion Two-stage anaerobic digestion is a process related to fermentative H2 production already in use at commercial scale, in which an acidogenic first stage is used before the methanogenic stage. This achieves enhanced stability, higher loading capacities and greater process efficiencies but there is a need for more process experience with a variety of wastes [92]. The acidogenic stage is not optimised for hydrogen production and normally effluent recycle from the second stage is used to minimise alkali addition. However, Kraemer and Bagley [93] using 15 g l - 1 glucose found that recycling lowered H2 output from the first stage, which showed more H2-consuming methanogenesis and propionate, ethanol and butanol production. It is not certain which of the effluent constituents when recycled (e.g. volatile acids, CO2, methanogens) had this effect on hydrogen production. In contrast, in the BIOCELL process where process water from the second stage methanogenic UASB was recycled to the H2 producing reactor [84] no problems in the first stage with methanogenesis were reported. The effluent leaving the H2 producing stage had a high alkalinity ( 2158 mg l - 1 as CaCO 3 ) . It may be that the methanogenic UASB granules used by Han and Shin [84] allowed less H2-consuming or propionate-producing bacteria to be recycled to the first stage than the sludge blanket anaerobic digester of Kraemer and Bagley. Also possibly with complex biomass substrates there is less need for alkali addition than with glucose. Further studies of the two-stage process are needed, including those with food wastes and crops, to optimise operation for both H2 production and alkali addition. The two-stage BIOCELL process [94] consisted of two main parts; three leaching bed reactors for acidogenic hydrogenesis and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for methanogenesis. The three leaching bed reactors were operated in a rotation mode with a two-day interval between degradation stages. Hydrogen fermentation of 6 days was followed by post-treatment (dewatering/aeration) for 2 days in the reactor. The UASB converted VFA and alcohol generated from the leaching bed reactors into methane. Han and Shin [69] operated the process at laboratory-scale for 110 days. The leaching bed reactors operated in sequential mode without pH control with recycle of the UASB effluent and a proportion of fresh water to keep NH3 and Na + below inhibitory levels. At 35 ∘ C and an OLR of 11.9 kg VS m - 3 reactor d - 1 , overall 72.5% of VS was removed and converted to H2 (28.2%) and CH4 (69.9%) on a COD basis in 8 days. Yield values of 0.31l H2 and 0.21l CH4 per gram of VS added were obtained, with volumetric production rates of 0.15l H2 and 0.071l CH 4 l - 1 reactor h - 1 . Each leaching bed reactor was operated for 6 days and the solid residue after draining and aeration in situ for 45h met Korean regulations for use as compost. In another study a UASB reactor treated influent generated during H2 production from the food waste with over 96% COD removal up to an OLR of 12.9 g COD l - 1 d - 1 [94]. The BIOCELL process operated for over 120 days at pilot scale using 50l leaching bed reactors followed by a 219l UASB reactor obtained similar results. 70.9% VS reduction at OLR of 12.5 kgVS m - 3 d - 1 and solids retention time of 8 days was obtained with 18.7% of the COD added converted to H2 and 52% to methane [20]. A two-stage batch-fed study of dining hall waste slurry compared H2 producing reactors at 35 and 55 ∘ C (both pH 5.5, 5 day HRT) followed by mesophilic methanogenic reactors (each 20d HRT). At an OLR of 8 g l - 1 d - 1 the process with the thermophilic reactor yielded 8.9% of the COD added as H2 and 66% as methane, while the mesophilic reactor process gave poorer H2 yields [70]. Liu et al. [71] used a 7.5% VS slurry of household solid waste fed manually twice daily at an OLR of 37.5 kgVS m - 3 d - 1 to the hydrogen reactor operating at 2d HRT, pH 5.2. The hydrogen yield was 43 cm 3 g - 1 VS added or 250 cm 3 g - 1 VS removed. The second stage methanogenic reactor generated 21% more methane than the analogous single-stage reactor, although the HRT was 17 rather than 15 days. Few details are yet widely available of the two-stage process developed by Sapporo Breweries Ltd. in partnership with Shimadzu Corp. and Hiroshima University which successfully produced H2 and CH4 from bread waste over 6 months [95]. The technology produced over 10% more biogas compared to the existing method of producing methane alone. About 80% of the bread waste was converted in one quarter of the conventional processing time. The Energy Technology Research Institute of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan, has a semi-pilot scale hydrogen/methane plant operating on high water content kitchen refuse, paper waste and food waste. The overall processing time was reduced from 25 to 15 days, the decomposition of organic waste was increased from 60–65% to 80% and energy recovery increased from 40–46% to 55% in comparison to conventional methane fermentation [96]. Two-stage processes currently appear to be essential, and it is therefore promising that there are good indications a two-stage process with an acidifying H2-producing first stage and a methanogenic second stage gives rise to more efficient waste treatment and energy recovery than a single-stage methanogenic process. It is likely that food industry and kitchen wastes will prove initially most attractive as substrates. Experience with these complex substrates is likely to develop as fuel costs rise and climate change mitigation becomes more pressing. Reactor capital and operating costs are likely to be similar to those already well known for anaerobic digestion. The next major challenge is to determine whether the economics and reliability of dark fermentative H2 production are sufficiently attractive for commercial applications to be installed."
