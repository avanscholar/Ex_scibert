0,Introduction,"Halogenated organic compounds constitute a large and ever-increasing group of environmental chemicals [1]. Natural organic halides are widespread especially in marine organisms but man-made organohalides are even more abundant being produced in multi-tons quantities for a wide variety of industrial applications. Also, organic halides have been extensively used as reagents and solvents in organic synthesis [2]. Hydroxyl-containing compounds have been identified as an attractive and practical source of organohalides since they are plentiful and often cheap chemicals. There are presently many practical procedures for the deoxyhalogenation of alcohols and oxyacids but they often require strong acid conditions and lack sustainability (production of large amounts of waste, poor atom economy, toxic reagents) [2,3]. Also, the synthesis of more complex organohalides often pose chemoselectivity problems which are not properly handled by many existing methods. Several years ago, we discovered that α-halo-enamines [4] performed the deoxyhalogenation of carboxylic acids and alcohols under very mild conditions [5]. These early results attracted the attention of several research groups who reported additional successful examples of deoxyhalogenaton reactions using α-halo-enamine reagents [2g,h, 4]. α-Chloroenamine 2a is commercially available and large amounts of α-chloro- and bromoenamines 2a,b and 3a,b can be readily prepared (Scheme 1 ) by the reaction of tertiary amides 1a,b with OPCl3 or OPBr3 followed by addition of triethylamine [8]. They are bench-stable reagents which can be purified by distillation. The corresponding α-iodo-enamines 4a,b were prepared from 2a and 2b by halide exchange with an alkali iodide [9]. Two detailed accounts of this practical deoxyhalogenation method [6,7] have been published recently. The discovery that both α-bromo- or α-iodo-enamines 3a,b and 4a,b could be formed in situ from 2a,b in the deoxy-bromination or iodination reactions further increased the practicality of the method [7]. All α-halo-enamines 2–4 had to be kept away from moisture. However small amounts of hydrolysis products (tertiary amides 1a,b) in the reagents were found to be harmless to the deoxyhalogenation reaction which anyway produced one equivalent of these amides as co-products. The deoxyhalogenation reaction was shown to take place via a keteniminium halide 5 in equilibrium with the α-halo-enamine (Scheme 2, X = Cl, Br, I) [6,7]. Addition of an alcohol or a carboxylic acid to this highly electrophilic iminium salt generated oxy-iminium halides 6 or 7 which can be regarded as an activated form of the hydroxyl-containing substrates. Nucleophilic attack of the halide ion on these intermediates gave the corresponding acyl or alkyl halides and regenerated amides 1a or 1b which were the starting materials for the synthesis of reagents 2, 3 and 4. Thus the reaction showed a high atom-economy. Reaction conditions were very mild and yields were high. This allowed successful deoxyhalogenation reactions of alcohols or carboxylic acids carrying sensitive functional groups. Furthermore both the reactivity and selectivity of these deoxyhalogenation reactions could be finely tuned by increasing the size of the nitrogen substituents. Remarkably the bulkier α-halo-enamines 2b, 3b, 4b were found to be both more selective [6] and more reactive [7] than 2a, 3a, 4a carrying methyl groups on nitrogen. The substitution step took place with inversion of configuration [7]. Allylic and propargylic halides are extremely useful synthetic building blocks and therefore a great deal of effort has gone into the development of practical synthesis of these classes of organohalides [1]. Here again the deoxyhalogenation of the corresponding allylic and propargylic alcohols attracted the attention of many research groups as a practical source of the allylic and propargylic halides [1d,10,11]. The interaction of the double or triple bond with the neighboring functional group in allylic and propargylic systems raises however regio- and stereochemical problems not encountered with saturated alcohols. In this report we describe the details of our studies on the deoxyhalogenation reactions of allylic and propargylic alcohols using α-halo-enamines 2a, 3a and 4a. We will also show that adding a base to the reaction mixture dramatically modified the course of the reaction leading to an interesting variant of the Eschenmoser-Claisen (amide Claisen) reaction which allowed the allylation or allenylation of 2,2′-disubstituted amides under mild conditions."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Deoxyhalogenations of allylic alcohols,"2.1 Deoxyhalogenations of allylic alcohols Scheme 3 is another illustration of the usefulness of TMXE as deoxyhalogenation reagents: their reactions with a series of primary allylic alcohols took indeed place in a few minutes at room temperature to give exclusively the primary allylic halides in high yields. The co-product of the reaction was the tertiary amide 1a which, if desired [6,7], can be recovered by distillatin and recycled as starting material for the synthesis of the α-halo-enamines. All reactions took place without isomerization of the olefinic double bond even with a (Z)-olefin as in 8d. Thus, the α-halo-enamine reagents TMXE compared very favorably with the best reagents (e.g.: Ph3P/CCl4, Ph3P/(Cl3C)2CO, Ph3P/I2) [2,11] available for the deoxyhalogenation of primary allylic alcohols: aside from the high yields and total regioselectivity, one should mention the mild conditions and the high atom economy. The method was applied to the synthesis of the chlorides 8a-f, bromides 9a-c and the more reactive iodides 10a-d. Deoxyhalogenations of secondary allylic alcohols with TMCE, TMBE and TMIE also occurred under mild conditions and gave high yields of the corresponding halides (Scheme 4 ). However, the reactions were less regioselective yielding mixtures of secondary and primary halides. The regioselectivity decreased in the order TMCE > TMBE > TMIE. Deoxychlorinations gave a high yield of the secondary chlorides 11a-c. Deoxybrominations were somewhat less regioselective but still gave the secondary bromides 12a,b as major products. Deoxyiodination reactions gave almost equimolar mixtures of secondary 13a,b and primary allylic iodides 10a and 10e. The formation of an allylic carbocation from the reactive iminium salt 14 could be rejected on the basis of the formation of distinct halides from (E)-but-2-en-1-ol (8a, 9a and 10a, Scheme 3) and from but-3-en-2-ol (11a + 8a, 12a + 9a and 13a + 10a) (Scheme 4). Thus, the formation of the secondary halides must result from a SN2 reaction (route a). A competing SN2′reaction could account for the formation of the primary halide (route b). Increasing the size of the nucleophilic halide expectedly favored route b at the expense of route a. Interestingly, we also observed that the amount of primary halide slowly increased when the reaction mixture was left for 2 days at room temperature: the 3:1 mixture of bromides 12a:9a then became a 1:1 mixture. The equimolecular mixture of secondary and primary iodides 13a:10a became a 1:6 mixture after 2 days at room temperature. This slow equilibrium between secondary and primary allylic halides could result from the presence of a stoichiometric amount of amide 1a as co-product of the deoxyhalogenation reaction. The heterolytic cleavage of the C–Br or C–I bonds could be more favorable as a result of the higher polarity of the mixture and a possible stabilization of cationic species by amide 1a acting as a Lewis base. The take-home message is that best yields of secondary halides will be obtained if the deoxyhalogenation reaction is stopped as soon as completed. The deoxyhalogenation of tertiary allylic alcohols usually yielded complex mixtures resulting from the presence of rearranged and elimination products [1d,10,11]. Thus, TMCE and 2-methylbut-3-en-2-ol yielded a mixture of three products (Scheme 5 ). The rearranged chloride 8b was the major product of the reaction. We also observed almost equimolecular amounts of unrearranged tertiary chloride 15 and isoprene. Elimination of hydrogen halide became thus significant in this weakly basic reaction mixture. Thus, in spite of the very mild conditions of the reaction, TMCE did not perform better towards tertiary allylic alcohols than most other deoxychlorination reagents. The reaction of 2-methylbut-3-en-2-ol with TMIE was more interesting although no tertiary iodide was formed. The reaction gave a 41% of primary iodide 10b and two unexpected products. These were shown to be the α-allylated amide 18a and the cyclic iminium salt 19. We had shown in our early studies that the key step of the deoxyhalogenation reaction was the formation of an alkoxy-iminium halide 16. The reaction mixture being slightly basic, the loose ion pair 16 could be in equilibrium with 17 which underwent an amide acetal Claisen rearrangement (Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement) to yield the α-allylated amide 18 [4d,12,13]. The third reaction product 19 must have resulted from a cyclization of either amide 18 or intermediate 17a. To test this mechanistic scheme, we reacted TMCE with 2-methylbut-3-en-2-ol in the presence of triethylamine (Scheme 6 ). This was expected to favor the formation of intermediate 17a at the expenses of the substitution product 10b. The Claisen rearrangement was very fast and amide 18a was formed in 85% yield. The cyclization of amide 18a took place readily in an aqueous solution of HI. Iminium salt 19 was obtained in 78% yield. It was readily hydrolyzed to the corresponding lactone under basic conditions."
3,-Allylation of 2-disubstituted amides,"2.2 -Allylation of 2-disubstituted amides We were both intrigued and interested by the Claisen-Eschenmoser rearrangement of intermediate 17. This compound appeared to rearrange as soon as formed even at room temperature. This was all the more surprising since the rearrangement involved the creation of a quaternary carbon atom. Thus, if the competing substitution pathways from 16 could be suppressed, the reaction of a β-disubstituted-α-chloro-enamine with an allylic alcohol in the presence of a base could be an attractive variant of the Claisen-Eschenmoser route for the synthesis of amides carrying a quaternary α-carbon atom (Scheme 7 ). However, the reaction of TMCE in dichloromethane with a variety of allylic alcohols in the presence of triethylamine (conditions A) still yielded allylic chlorides as major products. Low yields of allylic amides 18 were obtained except with the tertiary alcohol 2-methylbut-3-en-2-ol which gave a high yield of 18a. It was thus necessary to decrease the concentration of chloride ion in the solution by using a solvent which would not dissolve triethylamine hydrochloride. Rewardingly the reaction in cyclohexane (conditions B) gave better yields of allylated amides 18b,c,d but the reactions were much slower probably as a result of the heterogeneity of the reaction mixture. We had also shown that intermediate tetramethyl keteniminium salt 5a formed much more slowly in solvents like benzene or cyclohexane than in dichloromethane [3]. Not surprisingly isoprenyl alcohol only gave a 18% yield of the desired amide 18e and the major product was isoprenyl chloride. This resulted from steric hindrance caused by the formation of two vicinal quaternary carbon atoms. The formation of the chloride could be reduced by using the corresponding isoprenyl alkoxide (conditions C or D). The corresponding allylic amide 18e was then obtained in 66% (C) and 75% (D) yields. Similarly the reaction with cyclohex-2-en-1-ol in dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine (conditions A) only gave 3-chlorocyclohex-1-ene. However, the desired amide 18f could be isolated in 59% yield when the reaction was run in dimethoxyethane at 100 °C with the preformed lithium cyclohexenolate (conditions D). Reactions were not optimized in terms of time and temperature. We expanded this study to α-chloroenamine 2c which was prepared in good yields by the published procedure [7]. Routes C and D gave moderate yields of the Eschenmoser-Claisen products 21a-c. As expected, a substituent cis to the allylic group was shown to slow down the [3.3] rearrangement (Scheme 8 ): the reaction of (E)-hex-2-en-1-ol with TMCE in the presence of triethylamine in cyclohexane (conditions B) at 60 °C yielded 42% of 18g whereas the corresponding (Z) isomer merely led to a 15% yield. In this case nucleophilic substitution by a chloride ion competed favorably with the rearrangement as a result of strong steric interactions between Me and i-Pr groups in the s-cis conformation required for the sigmatropic rearrangement (Scheme 8). Generation of the lithium alkoxide prior to the addition of TMCE (conditions C) resulted in the formation of 18g in 45% yield but the reaction required 72 h. Similar observations were made for the reaction of (Z)- and (E)-hex-2-en-1-ol with 2c. The allylation reaction with (Z)-hex-2-en-1-ol required the use of the corresponding lithium alkoxide (conditions C). The results described in Scheme 7 for the reaction of TMCE 2a with isoprenol and cyclohex-2-en-1-ol to yield 18a and 18f are further illustrations of this inhibiting effect. In contrast with the reported examples of Eschenmoser- or Ficini-Claisen rearrangements [4d,12,13], the N,O-ketene acetals intermediates 17a-f and 20a-c derived from α-chloro-enamines 2a-c carry two substituents at the olefinic β-carbon atom. The steric interaction between an olefin β-substituent (eg: Me in 2a,b) and a nitrogen substituent causes a twist around the C–N bond which reduces the interaction of the nitrogen lone pair with the π orbital and induces an interaction with the σ orbital. This had been shown to be responsible for both the low nucleophilicity and the enhanced electrophilicity of these α-chloro-enamines. It should therefore be expected that this effect should also show up in the rearrangement of N,O-ketene acetals generated from these tetrasubstituted α-chloro-enamines. It was indeed found that the replacement of two methyl by two i-propyl groups on nitrogen slowed down the formation of the Eschenmoser-Claisen product (Scheme 9 ). As shown, the Me/i-Pr interaction should bring the amine group of the N,O ketene acetal out of conjugation with the CC bond. Thus, in contrast with what had been observed for the deoxyhalogenation reactions of alcools, increasing the size of the nitrogen substituents was detrimental on the Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement of these β -substituted N,O-ketene acetals. We also examined the reaction of allylic alcohols with an α-chloro-enamine 2d carrying two different substituents at C-2 (Scheme 10 ). Compound 2d was prepared as a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers in 65% yield from the treatment of amide 1d with OPCl3 followed by HCl elimination with Et3N. The reaction with the allylic alcohols was performed under conditions B to yield 55%–77% of allylated amides as a mixture of diastereoisomers 23a,b,c and 24a,b,c. Compound 23c could be purified by recrystallisation in acetone/water. Analysis of the crystals by X-ray diffraction firmly established the relative configurations of the two diastereoisomeric centers [14]. We believe that the poor diastereoselectivity mainly resulted from the formation of a mixture of (E) and (Z) ketene acetals (Scheme 11 ). Both (E) and (Z) isomers of 2d should give the same keteniminium chloride intermediate which meant that the configuration of the α-chloro-enamine 2d should have no importance on the stereochemistry of the substitution reaction yielding the N,O-ketene acetal intermediate. The stereoselectivity should rather be the result of the relative rates of addition to the diastereoisomeric faces of the iminium salt. It thus appeared that there was a slight preference for an addition of the alcohol to the a face (cis to the methyl group). A chair transition state for the Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement would account for the selective formation of either 23a-c or 24a-c from the (Z) or (E)-N,O-ketene acetals 25. We believe that this “variation” of the Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement reaction has some synthetic value: it allows the β-allylation of 2-disubstituted tertiary amides and thus the creation of a quaternary carbon atom under rather mild conditions. The limitation of the method results from the poor diastereoselectivity encountered with amides carrying two different groups at C-2."
4,Deoxyhalogenations of primary and secondary propargylic alcohols,"2.3 Deoxyhalogenations of primary and secondary propargylic alcohols A mild, non-acidic and sustainable route towards propargylic halides would also be welcome, in particular for the iodides which are difficult to obtain with a high degree of purity as a result of their easy isomerization to the corresponding iodoallenes [15]. The reaction of TMXE 2a-c (X = Cl, Br, I) with primary and secondary propargylic alcohols 26 for 1 h at room temperature gave high yields of the corresponding propargylic halides 27a-f and N,N-dimethylisobutyramide 1a (Scheme 12 ). Under these mild conditions, we observed no allenic halide in the mixtures except for the secondary propargylic iodides 27e and 27f which were contaminated by 6% of the corresponding allenic iodides. Decreasing reaction times should probably suppress the formation of this small amount of allenic iodides. We found indeed that the isomerization was catalyzed by amide 1a which was the coproduct of the deoxyhalogenation reaction: the deoxyiodination of oct-1-yn-3-ol 26 (R = C5H11) yielded a 15:1 mixture of propargylic 27f and allenic 28 iodides (conditions a). Under these conditions, only one equivalent of amide 1a was present at the end of the reaction. Refluxing the CHCl3 solution for 19 h led to the almost quantitative transformation of propargylic iodide 27f into the isomeric allenic iodide 28 (conditions b). We also showed that propargyl iodide 27f isomerized much more slowly in the absence of amide 1a (conditions c). This agreed with the early observations that propargyl iodides readily isomerized to allenic iodides in the presence of triphenylphosphite methiodide in DMF but remained unchanged when DMF was replaced by dichloromethane [15d]. However, our observations did not support the mechanism proposed by the authors who claimed that the rate enhancement in DMF resulted from an increase concentration of iodide ion resulting from the better solubility of triphenylphosphite methiodide in this solvent. Iodide ion would then add to the activated triple bond to generate an iodoallene. This explanation did indeed not hold here since there were no iodide ions in the starting materials. Iodide ions can only be produced by a nucleophilic attack of amide 1a on the propargyl iodide to yield an oxyiminium salt 29 which would then undergo a SN2’ reaction to yield the allenic iodide 28. These observations showed that both propargyl and allenyl iodides could be readily obtained from the reaction of TMIE 4a and a secondary propargylic alcohol (see Scheme 13 )."
5,Reaction of α-haloenamine 2a with a tertiary propargylic alcohol 30a,"2.4 Reaction of α-haloenamine 2a with a tertiary propargylic alcohol 30a The reaction of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol 30a with TMCE 2a gave low yields of deoxychlorination product 31 and chloroallene 32 (Scheme 14 ). The major product 33 resulted from an elimination of HCl. Interestingly we also observed an amide product 34 resulting from a [3.3] rearrangement of an intermediate α-propargyloxyenamine. The reaction of TMIE 4a with alcohol 30a was less complex but more intriguing (Scheme 15 ). No deoxyiodination product was formed. The major product was amide 39 (51%) which can be regarded as an isoprenylation product of amide 1a. The minor product 40 (27%) was even more surprising: the dihydropyridone ring must indeed have been the result of a cyclization involving the amide nitrogen and a cationic center on the side-chain. It also supposed the formation of methyl iodide which was indeed observed by 1H NMR ( δ CH3 = 2.16 ppm) in the crude reaction mixture. A possible mechanism would involve a nucleophilic attack of alcohol 30a on the keteniminium iodide in equilibrium with TMIE 4a to generate an oxonium salt 35 which should be easily converted into the more stable ammonium iodide 36. Deprotonation would generate the ketene N,O-acetal 37 which would undergo a fast [3.3] sigmatropic shift to 34a. Protonation of 34a by the acidic ammonium 36 (or oxonium 35) iodide would lead to a cationic intermediate 38. The cyclization reaction occurred on the amide nitrogen rather than on the more nucleophilic oxygen atom. This was very surprising since we had shown earlier (Scheme 5) that the cyclization of a rather similar cationic intermediate occurred on the amide oxygen. We have no explanation for this difference. However it is not unprecedented: a similar example of a AgBF4 catalyzed cyclization of an allenic amide involving a primary nitrogen atom has been reported [16]. Loss of a methyl group by nucleophilic attack of an iodide ion on a methyl substituent carried by the amide nitrogen would drive the equilibrium toward the observed dihydropyridone 40. The hypothesis of Brønsted acid catalyzed isomerization of 34a was further confirmed as shown in Scheme 16 ."
6,-Allenylation of 2-disubstituted amides,"2.5 -Allenylation of 2-disubstituted amides The formation of a dienylated amide 39 from a tertiary propargylic alcohol and TMIE 4a could probably find synthetic applications but we did not further explore this pathway. We rather explored the scope of the transformation of α-chloroenamines 2a,c,e into α -allenyl-amides 34 (Scheme 17 ). α-Chloroenamine 2e characterized by an isoprenyl carbon skeleton was prepared by the published procedure [6b]. Treatment of the α-chloroenamines 2a,c,e with a tertiary or a secondary propargylic alcohol 30 in the presence of triethylamine or with the corresponding alkoxide rewardingly led to α-allenic amides 34a-g in good yields. No deoxychlorination products were observed except for 34d which carries a substituent in place of hydrogen on the allenic carbon atom next to the quaternary carbon atom. These results perfectly complement earlier studies of similar [3.3] sigmatropic rearrangements yielding allenic ketones, aldehydes and amides [14]. Since β-disubstituted α-chloroenamines are readily available from the corresponding amides, this method offers an attractive route towards β -allenic amides carrying a quaternary carbon atom at C2."
7,Conclusions,"A first conclusion is that the above results significantly broaden the scope of the deoxyhalogenation method of alcohols with TMXE and DIXE reagents. The method had already been shown to be chemo- and stereoselective and it also occurred with high atom economy and sustainability. Now we showed that it could be successfully applied to the deoxyhalogenation of primary and secondary allylic and propargylic alcohols into the corresponding halides in excellent yields and under mild and neutral conditions. The deoxyhalogenation of secondary allylic alcohols gave only small amounts of rearranged halides with TMCE and TMBE. The iodination reagent TMIE gave higher amounts of rearranged iodides. We also found that the isomerization of propargylic iodide was catalyzed by the presence of the N,N-dimethylisobutyramide in the reaction mixture. Thus it was possible to obtain either a propargylic or an allenic iodide depending on the reaction time. As pointed out in the introduction allylic, propargylic and allenyl halides are very useful synthetic intermediates. An additional advantage of the deoxyhalogenation method with TMXE and DIXE is that the tertiary amide coproduct of the reaction is rather inert: in many instances, it will thus be possible to use these halides in situ. A second interesting fall-out of our studies came from the failure of the method for tertiary allylic and propargylic alcohols. The major products of these reactions resulted from a Claisen-Eschenmoser rearrangement of an intermediate N,O-ketene acetal. These intermediates could be generated more efficiently from the reaction of allylic and propargylic alcohols under basic conditions. Under these conditions, no or very little deoxyhalogenation product was observed. Rewardingly this unplanned spin-off from these studies led to the discovery of a mild and a practical method for allylation, propargylation and allenylation of α-disubstituted amides under mild conditions with simultaneous creation of a quaternary carbon atom. This further illustrated the importance of α-chloroenamines as activated derivatives of amides."

9,General,"4.1 General All reactions were carried out in oven or flame-dried glassware under argon atmosphere using freshly dried solvents. Distillations of products were performed using a 10 cm Vigreux column or a Büchi Kugelrohr GKR-50 apparatus. Solvents were distilled under argon or under reduced pressure. Chlorinated solvents (chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride) were dried over P4O10 then distilled. Cyclohexane was dried over CaH2 and distilled. Triethylamine was dried over solid KOH or CaH2 and distilled. Alcohols were dried over Mg/I2 then distilled. Dimethoxyethane was distilled over sodium/benzophenone. Commercial reagents were reagent grade and used without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 60 MHz (Varian T 60), 200 MHz (Varian Gemini-200 and VXR-200), 300 MHz (Bruker Avance 300) and 500 MHz (Bruker AM 500). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 50, 75 and 125 MHz. Infra-red spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer 681 spectrometer.1H and 13C chemical shifts are expressed in part per million (ppm) with respect to tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on Varian Mat 44 and Finnigan Mat-TSQ 70 using electronic impact at 70 eV, chemical ionization (100 eV, acetone or mixture of nitrogen oxide and methane) or FAB (70 eV). Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (230–400 Mesh). Thin layer chromatography was performed using silicagel 60 F254. GLCs were performed using Varian Aerograph 1400 (detector FID, nitrogen) or Carlo Erba Fractovap (detector FID, nitrogen) on either a SE30 column or a capillary column type 3700 (length 30 m, polydimethylsiloxane). HPLCs were performed using Waters 600 pump and Waters 486 UV variable wavelength detector. Elemental analyses were performed in Dr Bieler University of Vienna and Dr Stones laboratories. The known α-chloro-, -bromo-, and -iodo-enamines 2a, 2c, 2d, 3a, 4a were prepared from the corresponding amides following the procedures previously described [8b,9]."
10,General procedure for the reaction of α-haloenamines with allylic and propargylic alcohols,"4.2 General procedure for the reaction of α-haloenamines with allylic and propargylic alcohols Reactions were performed in an oven- or flame-dried three-neck round-bottomed flask under dry argon and with magnetic stirring. The flask was equipped with a septum and a refrigerator isolated from moisture by an oil trap. A solution of alcohol in CDCl3 or CH2Cl2 was syringed in through the septum and cooled down at 0 °C. A solution of α-haloenamine (1.1 equiv.) was then syringed into the flask and the mixture was left at room temperature. The reaction was followed by 1H NMR. Yields were determined after removal of the solvent either by 1H NMR using an added standard (usually benzene or toluene) or by GLC. In some cases, the halides were purified by distillation or flash chromatography. The isolated yields were always very close to those measured by NMR or GLC. Most of the halogenation products obtained in this study were known compounds: their spectroscopic properties have been shown to be identical to those reported in the literature Therefore, no data or only 1H NMR are reported for these molecules."

Under these conditions, no rearranged product was detected. However, after four days at room temperature, the crude reaction mixture was shown to contain a 1:3 mixture of 1-iodopropa-1,2-diene and 3-iodo-1-propyne (72%). The spectral properties were identical with those of authentic samples: for 3-iodo-1-propyne 27d: 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm): 3.64 (d, J = 2.5 Hz, 2H), 2.43 (t, J = 2.5 Hz, 1).

A mixture of 3-iodo-1-butyne 27e (92%) and 1-iodobuta-1,2-diene (6%) was obtained (yields determined by 1H NMR). After 4 days at r.t. the crude reaction mixture only contained 1-iodobuta-1,2-diene (90%). The spectral properties were identical with those of authentic samples: for 3-iodobut-1-yne 27e, 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm): 4.59 (qd, J1 = 7 Hz, J2 = 2.5 Hz, 1H), 2.67 (d, J = 2,5 Hz, 1H), 2.07 (d, J = 7Hz, 3H); for 1- iodobuta-1,2-diene, 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm); 5.59 (m, 1H), 5.01 (m, 1H), 1.72 (dd, J1 = 7.4 Hz, J2 = 2.6 Hz, 3H). 4.6.6 3-Iodooct-1-yne 27f Oct-1-yn-3-ol 0.59 ml (0.51 g, 4 mmol); 1 g (4.4 mmol)TMIE 4a; 1 h. A mixture of 3-iodo-1-octyne 27f (91%) and 1-iodoocta-1,2-diene (6%) was obtained (yields determined by 1H NMR). After 12 h at r.t., the crude mixture (which also contained N,N-dimethylisobutyramide) contained a 15:1 mixture of 3-iodooct-1-yne/1-iodoocta-1,2-diene. After 19 h in refluxing chloroform, isomerization into 1-iodoocta-1,2-diene was almost completed (1:13.3). N,N-dimethylisobutyramide 1a was separated from the iodide mixture by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate: 2/1). In the absence of 1a, the isomerization was very slow: after 4 days at r.t., the mixture of the 2 iodides remained unchanged (74% of propargylic iodide + 26% of iodoallene). However, after 24 h in refluxing chloroform, the ratio 3-iodooct-1-yne/1-iodoocta-1,2-diene became 1/3. The spectral properties were identical with those of authentic samples.
