0,Introduction,"Conventional power generation is always accompanied with heavy pollution including green house gases and emission of other harmful pollutants, which intrigues urgent search for environmentally friendly alternatives to meet the ever increasing needs of power [1]. As a clean and renewable energy carrier, hydrogen has become more and more attractive since its final product is merely clean water [2]. Hydrogen can be used in many areas, such as electric vehicles, rockets, chemical industries, and direct combustion [3]. Particularly, it serves as fuel for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), providing a promising approach to high energy efficiency. Currently there are several methods to produce H2, such as reforming of hydrocarbon, alcohols, aldehydes and formic acid [5–10], nuclear-based thermochemical water decomposition [4], electrolysis of water with photovoltaic energy [11], direct electrolysis [12], and digestion of certain remains of biomaterials [13,14]. However, hydrogen production still remains a grand challenge as the process desires being energy efficient, cost effective, and environmentally friendly. For example, in the case of PEMFCs, reformers have been explored to produce H2, which usually work at temperature above 250 °C and are difficult to start up quickly [6]. When electrolysis of water is employed, the required voltage is higher than that for PEMFC primarily due to overpotential or polarization [3,12]. At the present time, most of hydrogen comes from fossil fuels, and the main reason lies in that the processes based on fossil fuels are by far the cheapest since the fossil fuels are still abundant. However, as the reserve of fossil fuels starts to deplete at a rapid rate, not only the production cost will increase but also the sustainable development of human being will be endangered. One promising alternative is to use small organic compounds, which can be derived from biomass, as a primary starting material. Alcohols such as methanol [15–18] and ethanol [19] can be good substitutes to water in hydrogen production via electrolysis, as its electrolytic voltages are much lower than those for water, implying much lower energy consumption during hydrogen production. Formic acid and its solution, on the other hand, are considered industrial hazardous wastes because of their toxicity to human health, and they sometimes form waste solution in large amounts in chemical industries. Thus using formic acid and its solution to produce hydrogen will have two benefits: tackling pollution and generating clean energy. Aqueous solutions of formic acid were employed to produce hydrogen through catalytic decomposition [20–23] and electrolysis using solid polymer electrolytes [24]. If its solutions can be directly used for electrolysis to produce hydrogen, the required energy or power will theoretically be much lower than that for electrolysis of water, which will be of more economic interest. Consequently, in this paper, electrolysis of formic solutions is explored for the first time, and the dependence of the electrolytic voltage on the concentrations of formic acid and sodium hydroxide is investigated. The initial voltage is found to be as low as 0.30 V, which is much lower than that for water or methanol [3,12,15–17], suggesting a promise for practical industrial applications."
1,Experimental,"The electrochemical reactions for the electrolysis of formic acid solutions undergo mainly as follows [21]: (1) Anode : HCOOH + 2 OH − → CO 2 + H 2 O + 2 e − (2) Cathode : 2 H 2 O + 2 e − → H 2 + 2 OH − (3) Overall : HCOOH → H 2 + CO 2 Platinum foils with a surface area of 1.0 cm2 and thickness of 0.2 mm were used as both cathode and anode. Prior to the reactions, the platinum foils were dipped in a concentrated HNO3 solution (63 wt.%) over 4 h and washed with deionized water. After burning with an ethanol lamp, they were ready for use in experiment. In order to analyze the components of the produced gases, a sealed system was designed as shown in Fig. 1 . The condenser in the system allowed the minor amount of formic acid and water vapor in the produced gases to cool down. Direct current was controlled by a battery charger (Land 3.2) from Kingnuo Company, China. GC analysis was carried out on a GC-1690 gas chromatograph from Kexiao Company, China, and the contents of H2, CO and CO2 for control were adjusted prior to measurement."
2,Results and discussion,"Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the electrolytic voltage on time at different concentrations of NaOH and 3.0 M HCOOH at a current density of 1.0 mA/cm2. The electrolytic voltage increases slowly with increase in time. Such voltage increase is mainly because of the overpotential from the accumulation of certain gases or organic compounds on the surface of the Pt foils. When the initial concentration of NaOH is below 3.0 M and that of HCOOH is 3.0 M, the voltage is lower than 0.6 V, indicating that the electrolysis of formic acid is desirable to produce H2 for PEMFC. When the concentration of NaOH is increased to above 3.0 M, such as 3.5 or 4.0 M, the voltage increases very sharply, reaching above 1.5 V. Meanwhile, when the NaOH concentration is fixed at 4.0 M with a current density of 1.0 mA/cm2, the change in electrolytic voltage with time at different formic acid concentrations is observed and compared in Fig. 3 . When the initial concentration of formic acid is lower than 4.0 M, the voltage is above 1.5 V, whereas the voltage drops quickly below 0.6 V when the initial concentration of formic acid is raised to above 4.0 M. Figs. 2 and 3 reveal that when the initial concentration of formic acid is equal to or higher than that of NaOH, the voltage is below 0.6 V and can even be as low as 0.3 V. This is much lower compared with that for the electrolysis of water, and the main reason is the different ΔG for the decomposition reactions, which are shown as follows: (4) HCOOH ( l ) → CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ G = − 48.38 kJ / mol (5) H 2 O ( l ) → H 2 ( g ) + 1 / 2 O 2 ( g ) Δ G = 237 kJ / mol When the initial concentration of formic acid is lower than that of NaOH, the voltage is, however, very high, above 1.5 V. It is known that formic acid and sodium hydroxide form a buffer solution to provide formic acid a stable concentration. Perhaps it is the actual concentration of formic acid that affects the electrolytic voltage. In order to confirm the relationship between the actual concentration of formic acid and electrolytic voltage, electrolysis experiments with less change in the concentrations of formic acid and sodium hydroxide were carried out. Fig. 4 compares the electrolytic voltage at different NaOH concentrations from 3.0 to 3.5 M with 3.0 M formic acid at the current density of 1.0 mA/cm2, while Fig. 5 compares the electrolytic voltage at different formic acid concentrations from 4.0 to 3.5 M with 4.0 M NaOH at the current density of 1.0 mA/cm2. As shown in these two figures, the initial electrolytic voltage is below 0.6 V when the initial concentration of NaOH is 3.0 or 3.1 M and that of formic acid is 3 M or when the concentration of formic acid is 4.0 or 3.9 M and that of NaOH is 4.0 M. Meanwhile, the ionization constant of formic acid at room temperature is 1.8 × 10−4 M, and ion-product constant of water is 10−14 (M)2 as follows: (6) [ H + ] [ HCOO − ] / [ HCOOH ] = 1.8 × 10 − 4 (7) [ H + ] [ OH − ] = 10 − 14 According to Eqs. (6) and (7), when the initial concentration of formic acid is 3.0 M and those of NaOH are 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 M, the actual concentrations of formic acid are calculated to be 1.67 × 10−9, 0.83 × 10−9 and 0.56 × 10−9 M, respectively; when the initial concentration of NaOH is 4.0 M and those of formic acid are 3.9, 3.8, and 3.7 M, the actual concentrations of formic acid are 2.2 × 10−9, 1.1 × 10−9 and 0.74 × 10−9 M, respectively. If the electrolytic voltage is below 0.6 V, the actual concentration of formic acid in the solution should be higher than 0.8 × 10−9 M. Thus, the free formic acid is closely involved in the voltage-determining step during the electrolytic process, and the OH− is just a spectator as shown in above Eqs. (1)–(3). If the concentration of free formic acid is low, which is equal to the initial concentration of NaOH is high, the polarization or overpotential during the electrolytic process will be very high, leading to the sharp increase of electrolytic voltage [25]. Fig. 6 shows the change in the voltage with the current density during the electrolysis of formic acid. The initial concentration of NaOH is 1.0 M and that of formic acid varies from 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 to 4.0 M. The voltages were recorded after 65 min. From Fig. 6, it is found that the voltage increases with the increase of the current density, while the voltage for 1.0 M formic acid is higher than for the others. Based on the above results and discussion, the higher the concentration of formic acid is, the lower the electrolytic voltage becomes. An increase in the initial concentration of HCOOH from 1.0 to 4.0 M with 1.0 M NaOH leads to a decrease in the electrolytic voltage from 0.72 to 0.55 V during the electrolysis at the current density of 1.0 mA/cm2, while from 0.90 to 0.70 V at the current density of 6.0 mA/cm2. Fig. 7 shows the amount of H2 produced at 3.0 M HCOOH and 2.5 M NaOH at a constant current density of 8.0 mA/cm2. The production rate of H2 can be calculated at 53 μmol/h. Given the small scale the above experiments were carried out, the production rate is quite satisfactory compared with other methods of hydrogen production [5,22,24]."
3,Conclusion,"The electrolytic voltage of formic acid in sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was investigated, and the actual concentration of formic acid was found to affect the electrolytic voltage: (1) When the initial concentration of formic acid is less than that of sodium hydroxide and the actual concentration of formic acid is less than 0.80 × 10−9 M, the voltage is very high, above 1.5 V, which is similar to water electrolysis. (2) When the initial concentration of formic acid is equal to or more than that of sodium hydroxide, i.e., the actual concentration of formic acid is more than 0.80 × 10−9 M in aqueous solution, the electrolytic voltage is below 0.6 V and the lowest can reach 0.3 V, which is enough to enable continuous work of PEMFC. (3) The electrolysis voltage increases with the increase of the electrolytic current density. Specifically at 1.0 M NaOH and 4.0 M HCOOH after 65 min, the voltage increases from 0.62 to 0.70 V when the current density increases from 1.0 to 6.0 mA/cm2. (4) At 3.0 M HCOOH and 2.5 M NaOH, the hydrogen production rate is 53 μmol/h when the current density is 8.0 mA/cm2, which is very satisfactory for such a small unit. These preliminary results indicate that electrolysis of formic acid solutions will be another promising direction to produce hydrogen and solve the possible problems from formic acid waste."
