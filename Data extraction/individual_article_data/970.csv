0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green and efficient oxidant, which has been widely used in the fields of medical sterilization, papermaking, textile, electronics, food, environmental remediation and chemical synthesis [1–5]. H2O2 is also receiving much attention as a sustainable energy carrier for fuel cells alternative to H2 because it is soluble in water and can be used in a convenient and safe one-compartment cell with the sole byproduct water [6–8]. Industrial scale H2O2 production has been achieved via anthraquinone oxidation, alcohol oxidation and electrochemical synthesis [9–12]. However, those techniques usually require high energy and emit toxicants, which increase the cost of production, transportation and storage. Alternatively, direct synthesis of H2O2 form hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) over the supported noble metal (Au, Pd and Pd-Au alloy) catalysts had been frequently reported [12–14], whereas explosion limit of the reacting gas became the major problem during applications. In this regard, photocatalytic production of H2O2 becomes a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to the above methods because only water (H2O), O2 and light are involved [15–19]. Photocatalytic production of H2O2 from H2O and O2 mainly follows two half reactions: i) the generation of O2 and H+ via the oxidation of H2O by the photogenerated holes (Eq. (1)), ii) the generation of H2O2 via the two-electron reduction of O2 (Eq. (2)). Recently, the novel multi-channel routes have been proposed on the basis of the Z‐scheme heterojunction photocatalysis systems [20,21]. In brief, the electrons in the conduction band (CB) of a host semiconductor reduce O2 to generate H2O2 dominantly (Eqs. (1) and (2)); while the holes in the valence band (VB) of a guest semiconductor synergistically promote the H2O2 production in two ways: i) the holes are responsible for the formation of ·OH radicals (Eq. (3)), which further combine with each other to generate H2O2 (Eq. (4)), ii) the holes oxidize H2O to O2 (Eq. (1)), enhancing the separation of photocarriers. (1) H2O + 2h+ → 1/2O2 + 2H+ (1.23 V vs. NHE) (2) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2 (0.68 V vs. NHE) (3) h+ + OH− → OH (1.99 V vs.NHE) (4) OH + OH → H2O2 So far, TiO2 [18,22–26], g-C3N4 [16,17,20,21,27–35], CdS [15,36], Cd3(C3N3S3)2 [37,38], BiVO4 [39], transition metal complexes [40–44] and organic ions [45,46] based catalysts have been investigated in photocatalytic production of H2O2, among which g-C3N4 materials are the research focus. Most of the photocatalytic H2O2 production systems face the challenges of (i) saving the pure O2 or organic electron donors to achieve the convenient and green synthesis; (ii) increasing the H2O2 productivity to a higher level; (iii) effective utilization of the photogenerated H2O2 in situ for oxidation reactions. In a previous work, an in situ H2O2 oxidation process has been proposed that a catalytic oxidation process can be integrated into the photocatalytic H2O2 production system by introduction of required active species into the parent catalyst [47]. For in situ H2O2 oxidations, it is expected that the continuously generated H2O2 driven by visible light can satisfy many oxidation procedures that require small scale of H2O2 instead of the costly commercial H2O2. Recently, metal chalcogenides as an important research topic exhibit application potential in many fields. Among those materials, Co9S8 family has exhibited good electrochemical performance in electrocatalytic water splitting [48], oxygen reduction reaction [49], dye-sensitized solar cells [50] and supercapacitors [51]. The photocatalytic performance of Co9S8 has just been discovered and requires to be further developed. Most of the related works are focused on the photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting [52–54]. Co9S8 possessing a narrow band gap and a high flat band (FB) potential can display efficient charge transfer through intermediate sulfur atoms bonded to other metals at the interface [48,52]. Therefore, Co9S8 has become an ideal candidate as an electron donor semiconductor for the construction of redox-mediator-free Z-scheme systems with applicability in photocatalytic water splitting. Co9S8 is also expected to exhibit efficient solar light harvesting in photocatalytic H2O2 production following a Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. The Z-scheme pathway can effectively accelerate the separation of photoexcited charge carriers, and improve the redox ability of Co9S8 by enhancing the redox potential, thus promoting the two-electron reduction of O2 to H2O2. Fabrication of heterojunction between Co9S8 and other semiconductors could be a preferred way to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production via the Z-scheme pathway. Mn3O4 is a p-type semiconductor with stronger visible-light harvesting property, which mainly acts as a good co-catalyst or hybrid component [55,56]. The charge transfer synergy can form between the implanted Mn3O4 and the parent photocatalyst, which can enhance the photocatalytic performance. In addition, introduction of a p-type semiconductor (i.e. Mn3O4) into a photocatalyst could achieve higher water reduction efficiency due to its downward band bending when contacting with water. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports regarding the Z-scheme heterojunction formed between Co9S8 and Mn3O4, and the photoproductions of H2O2 over the Z-scheme photocatalysts require further investigation. In this work, we initially find that Co9S8 can become a potential photocatalyst to obtain mM scale of H2O2. Accordingly, a hybrid Z-scheme system of p-Mn3O4/n-Co9S8 is designed and fabricated at room temperature in order to further enhance the productivity of H2O2. Both Co9S8 and Mn3O4 exhibit regulable morphologies in the nanocomposites as the guest Mn3O4 content is modulated. The photoelectrons transportability and carrier density are significantly improved via the formation of heterojunction between the enlarged surface of Co9S8 nanosheets and well dispersed Mn3O4 nanorods. The photocatalytic system was performed in the ambient air without using pure O2 as oxidant and organic electron donors, which was convenient and feasible. In the alkaline water, an optimal Mn3O4/Co9S8 composite can obtain 2 times of H2O2 productivity in comparison to bare Co9S8. Finally, we designed a Fenton-like process oxidized by the in situ H2O2 for the methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) dyes degradation over the Mn3O4/Co9S8 system, achieving an efficient use of the photogenerated H2O2."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Mn3O4/Co9S8 nanocomposites,"2.1 Preparation of Mn3O4/Co9S8 nanocomposites Preparation of Co9S8 loaded with Mn3O4 materials followed a synchronous crystallization procedure at a room temperature. Typically, 3.0 g of Co(NO3)2 6H2O was dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water under continuous stirring. Then, 3.09 g of CH3CSNH2, 2.2 g of NaOH and 0.4 g of MnCl2 4H2O were successively added to the above solution until they were dissolved. After stirring for 2 h, the precipitate was washed by water, centrifuged, and dried at 50 °C overnight. Finally, a black product of Co9S8 loaded with theoretical 20 wt.% of Mn3O4 was obtained and denoted as Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8. A series of compared samples denoted as Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 with different Mn3O4 loadings (x = 0−30 wt.%) were prepared following the same procedure by changing the mass of MnCl2 4H2O. For comparison, the precipitation method [57,58] was adopted to prepare pure Mn3O4, which was similar to that of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 without adding Co(NO3)2 6H2O and CH3CSNH2."
3,Materials characterizations,"2.2 Materials characterizations The actual contents of Mn and Co elements in the samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Agilent730). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using Rigaku D/Max 2400 diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, λ = 1.5417 Å) at a scanning rate of 2°/min. FT–IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Thermo 360 spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Escalab 250 Xi instrument to analyze the elemental compositions and electronic states of the elements, with the scanning spectra of Co 2p, Mn 2p, S 2p and O 1s, which were decomposed with the XPSPEAK software (Version 4.0). Surface area and pore size distribution were measured by an ASAP 2420 surface area analyzer at 77 K that used N2 adsorption-desorption method. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area was computed by using data within the linear range of relative pressure between 0.04 and 0.32 according to IUPAC recommendations. Total pore volume was calculated from the amount of N2 adsorbed at 0.9 of relative pressure. Pore volumes and diameters were estimated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded at room temperature by a fluorescence spectrometer (EDAX Orbis PC) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed on a fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instrument Xe900) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images of as-prepared samples were observed on a JSM-7500 F field emission SEM (JEOL, Japan). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, element mapping images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were achieved on a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN instrument. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained on a JASCO V-770 spectrometer with BaSO4 as the internal standard. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis was performed on a photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi) using He I excitation (21.22 eV) with a pass energy of 1.0 eV and a sample bias of −5 eV. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL FA300 spectrometer using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin-trapping reagent under the irradiation of a 300 W of Xe lamp with a 420 nm of filter. Transient photocurrent, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Mott-Schottky measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E). The as-prepared photocatalyst photoanode (1.0 × 1.0 cm2) was used as a working electrode, the Pt foil was used as a counter electrode, the Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M of Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte. A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used as the visible light source. The photocurrent was measured at -0.2 V bias voltage versus Ag/AgCl. EIS tests were performed on the electrochemical workstation over a frequency range of 105-10−2 Hz and 5 mV of amplitude. CV curves were recorded at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s."
4,Photocatalytic production and decomposition of H2O2,"2.3 Photocatalytic production and decomposition of H2O2 Photocatalytic production of H2O2 was performed in the ambient atmosphere (unless otherwise noted). The reaction temperature was constantly controlled at 10 °C by a water bath during the entire reaction. In a typical procedure, 0.05 g of catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water under continuous stirring. After dark adsorption for 30 min, the mixture was exposed to a 300 W Xe lamp equipping with a cooling system and a cut-off filter as the visible light irradiation to start the photoreaction. The irradiation intensity was measured to be 10.95 W/m2 by a light power detector (SM206-SOLAR). At every time interval, the suspension was sampled, centrifuged and analyzed by the KMnO4 titration method to determine the concentration of H2O2. The comparative experiments were performed following the similar procedure by adjusting pH with dilute H2SO4 or NaOH solution, or purging with pure O2 gas for 15 min before photoreaction. The recycling test was also performed following the same procedure by using the regenerated photocatalyst in every cycle. In a mechanism study, the main active species generated in photoreaction were determined by the trapping experiments, during which 2 mmol of ethanol, AgNO3 and tert-butanol (TBA) scavengers was added, or N2 was filled in the photocatalytic H2O2 production system, respectively. The apparent quantum yields (AQY) for photocatalytic production of H2O2 over Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 were measured using a monochromatic lamp with band pass filters of 320, 450, 550, 600 and 750 nm. The irradiation intensity was measured to be 10.95 W/m2 by a light power detector (SM206-SOLAR). The irradiation area was controlled as 13.5 cm2. The AQY of H2O2 production for 1 h was calculated by the equation of AQY (%) = (2N e /N p )×100 %, where N e is the number of H2O2 molecules formed, N p is the number of incident photons [24,59]. Photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2 was performed in the same instrument as photocatalytic production of H2O2. In detail, 0.05 g of catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of H2O2 solution (2.0 mM) under continuous stirring. After 30 min of dark adsorption, the mixture was exposed to a 300 W Xe lamp equipping with a cooling system and a cut-off filter as the visible light irradiation to start the photoreaction. At the time intervals, the suspension was sampled, centrifuged and analyzed by the KMnO4 titration method to determine the concentration of H2O2."
5,In-situ-Fenton process for dyes degradation,"2.4 In-situ-Fenton process for dyes degradation Dye degradation was integrated with photocatalytic H2O2 production in order to verify the generation of H2O2 and achieve its in situ usage, which was proposed as in-situ-Fenton process. In detail, 0.05 g of catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL of model wastewater containing 2 × 10−5 M of MB or RhB dye under continuous stirring. After a dark adsorption process for 60 min, the mixture was exposed to a 300 W Xe lamp equipping with a cooling system and a cut-off filter as the visible light irradiation to start the photoreaction. In every time interval, the mixture was sampled, centrifuged and analyzed using a TU-1800 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Degradation rate (D) of dye was measured by the equation of D = (C 0 -C t )/C 0 = (A 0 -A t )/A 0 , where C is the concentration of dye and A is the absorbance of dye."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology and structure of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8,"3.1 Morphology and structure of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 A series of morphology regulable Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 composites were synthesized at ambient conditions (Scheme 1 ). Pure Co9S8 was obtained via room temperature crystallization following the reaction of Co2+ and CH3CSNH2 in an alkaline environment [52]. Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 composites were constructed in the same system with the addition of Mn salt. The formed Mn(OH)2 precipitate was easily oxidized to Mn3O4 by the oxygen from air in the alkaline surroundings [60,61]. Finally, Mn3O4 and Co9S8 simultaneously formed and hybridized together. The SEM and TEM images of the Co9S8 and Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples are presented to observe the morphology changes with the Mn3O4 content. In SEM images (Fig. 1 ), the pristine Co9S8 presents the aggregative nanoflowers morphology, which is consistent with a reported Co9S8 material [53]. The Co9S8 nanoflowers transform into the close packing of nanoplates as 10 wt.% of Mn3O4 is loaded, and further transform into the larger and dispersed polygonal nanoplates as the Mn3O4 content exceeds 20 wt.%. In TEM images (Fig. 2 ), it is observed that Mn3O4 of 10 wt.% loading exists as nanoparticles on Co9S8 nanosheets, and grows into the crystals of nanorods as the content exceeds 20 wt.%. However, the Mn3O4 nanorods on Co9S8 start to be nonuniform and aggregated as the Mn3O4 content comes up to 30 wt.%. Elemental mapping images of a typical Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 sample are shown in Fig. S1a. Co and S as the major elements of matrix widely distribute in the global region of the Mn3O4/Co9S8 composite. Mn and O elements concentratively distribute in the long and narrow regions to be described as nanorods. On the nanorods, Co and S elements of low-density distribution coexist and overlap with the Mn and O elements, indicating that the interface generates between Mn3O4 and Co9S8 to further form the heterostructure. The major elements content distribution in Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 can be observed from the EDS spectrum (Fig. S1b). Table S1 lists the actual contents of Mn and Co elements in the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples analyzed by ICP-AES. Further, the actual Mn3O4 contents of Mn3O4(10 %)/Co9S8, Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 and Mn3O4(30 %)/Co9S8 are calculated to be 8.44 wt.%, 13.87 wt.% and 22.50 wt.%, respectively, indicating the reasonable weight percent of introduced Mn3O4 into the Co9S8 matrix. Fig. 3 presents the HRTEM images of Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 to observe the lattice structure of the heterojunction. In the left image, we can see that the Mn3O4 nanorods tightly attach to the Co9S8 matrix via a strong interaction, and the clear interface exists between the two phases with the different lattice fringe spacings. By magnification (the right image), two sets of lattice fringes can be found. The lattice fringe of 0.49 nm corresponds to the (101) crystal plane of Mn3O4 [62], while the fringe spacing of 0.29 nm corresponds to the (311) plane of Co9S8 [63,64], which agree with the reports. Scheme 1 illustrates that the hybridization of Mn3O4 achieves the dual regulation on the crystallizations of the host (Co9S8) and guest (Mn3O4) component, which might further adjust the photoelectric properties. A series of characterizations were employed to analyze the chemical compositions and the regulated structure of the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 materials. In the XRD patterns (Fig. 4 ), major diffraction peaks near 2θ = 16.8°, 29.7°, 31.2°, 47.5° and 52.3° assigned to the (111), (311), (222), (511) and (440) planes of Co9S8 phase can be identified (PDF#03-0631) [52,53,65]. In contrast to the pure Mn3O4 (PDF#75-1560), the major peaks of the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples corresponding to the (101), (112), (103), (211), (105), (321) and (224) planes confirm the existence of the tetragonal Mn3O4 [66], which generates from the oxidation of Mn(OH)2 in alkaline medium [60]. The clues about the regulation effect of Mn3O4 on the morphology of Mn3O4/Co9S8 composites can be provided by XRD. When Mn3O4 is in a low amount (x =10 wt.%), the (101), (103), (105) and (321) peaks of Mn3O4 are very close in intensity, indicating that the growth of Mn3O4 crystals is homogeneous along those orientations. Therefore, Mn3O4 exists as nanoparticles in the Mn3O4(10 %)/Co9S8 sample. When the Mn3O4 content is increased (x =20 wt.% and 30 wt.%), the (101) and (211) peaks of Mn3O4 gradually become more intensive than that of the other planes, while the (112) peak gradually disappears. The above changes show that the Mn3O4 crystals grow much faster along one or several orientations than the others, resulting in the lengthening and narrowing of Mn3O4 to form the nanorods appearance. Although Mn3O4 and Co9S8 show several overlapped peaks (e.g. 16.8° and 31.2°), the major diffraction signals of Co9S8 can be observed at 29.7° and 52.3° for the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples to show the well maintained structure of Co9S8 after the modification of Mn3O4. It should be noted that the diffraction signals of Co9S8 in several faces such as (311) and (511) are slightly weakened possibly due to that the growth of Co9S8 crystals is influenced by the growth of Mn3O4. In detail, the increased amount of Mn3O4 implanted in the Co9S8 crystals lowers the purity of Co9S8, and gradually enlarges the Co9S8 crystals from more dispersive nanoflowers to larger nanosheets. However, the tendency to form the Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction is increased due to the increased contacting area between Mn3O4 nanorods and Co9S8 nanosheets. In FT-IR spectra (Fig. 5 ), the two peaks at 1093.3 and 620.0 cm−1 are assigned to the CoS vibration in the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples [67]. Each Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 sample shows one more peak at 3627.5 cm-1 than pure Co9S8, the intensity of which increases with Mn content. The signal is assigned to the OH stretching and bending modes of water due to the introduction of Mn species. The intrinsic structure and framework of Co9S8 matrix well maintains after Mn3O4 hybridization. XPS spectra of Co9S8 and Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples are shown in Fig. 6 a–e. In XPS survey spectra (Fig. 6a), major elements of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 can be identified. The Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 6b) is deconvoluted into two shake peaks (805.2 and 790.0 eV), and two pairs of spin-orbit doublets assigning to Co2+ (795.0 eV of 2p1/2 and 783.7 eV of 2p3/2) and Co3+ (800.4 eV of 2p1/2 and 786.4 eV of 2p3/2) valences of Co element in Co9S8 [52,68]. The Mn 2p spectrum (Fig. 6c) is deconvoluted into two peaks around 642.4 (Mn 2p3/2) and 654.5 eV (Mn 2p1/2) assigning to Mn2+ [60,69], and two peaks around 643.0 (Mn 2p3/2) and 655.4 eV (Mn 2p1/2) assigning to Mn3+ in Mn3O4 [60,70]. The S 2p spectra (Fig. 6d) are shifted to the lower binding energies with the increase of Mn3O4 loading in Mn3O4/Co9S8. The shift of binding energy generally indicates a good electronic interaction and transfer between the matrix (e.g. Co9S8) and the introduced species (e.g. Mn3O4), which can improve the electron separation efficiency [71]. On the one hand, the charge redistribution between the two semiconductors is aroused by the S atoms existing in their interface region [71], which can also be reflected by the binding energy shift in the S 2p spectra. It means that that the S atoms in the interface can also participate in the charge transfer between Co9S8 and another semiconductor [52]. On the other hand, the interface of the two semiconductors can promote the electron transfer between two metals (e.g. Co and Mn) through the intermediate sulfur atoms bonded to both metals [48,52]. Therefore, those changes in the S species after the formation of heterojunction are expected to enhance the photocatalytic activity. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 6e) of each Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 sample is deconvoluted into three peaks centered at 533.5, 532.5 and 531.9 eV. The peak at the lower binding energy (531.9 eV) is assigned to the lattice oxygen (Mn-O-Mn) in Mn3O4 [62,72]. The peaks at around 532.5 and 533.5 eV are respectively assigned to the MnOH and HOH groups due to the existence of crystal water on the catalysts [62,72]. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 7 a) and pore size distributions (Fig. 7b) present the effect of Mn3O4 decoration on the surface and pores properties of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8. In comparison to pure Co9S8, Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 gradually presents more obvious type IV isotherm as the Mn3O4 content is increased. Each of the isotherm possesses a spindly hysteresis loop to show the typical characteristics of a mesoporous solid (Fig. 7a). Mesopore size distributions of the samples between 12.43 and 15.84 nm can be observed (Fig. 7b), and the pore size distribution peak intensifies with the increase of Mn3O4 content in Co9S8. The introduction of Mn3O4 into Co9S8 increases the dispersity of their hybrid crystals, and thus formed more intergranular pores (Figs. 1 and 2). Table S2 lists the pores and surface parameters of the samples. As the Mn3O4 content is increased from 0 to 20 wt.%, the BET surface area of the sample is increased from 5.13 m2/g to 16.58 m2/g, and the pore volume is increased from 0.01 cm3/g to 0.14 cm3/g. However, the BET surface area and pore volume start to decrease as the Mn3O4 content is further increased to 30 wt.%, resulting from the agglomeration of Mn3O4 nanorods (Fig. 2). The improvements in the surface and pores properties of Co9S8 contribute to the reactant molecules contacting with more active sites in the capacious channels, and further enhancing the photocatalytic performance."
8,Photoelectric properties of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8,"3.2 Photoelectric properties of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 Photoelectric properties of the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples were comparatively studied via the transient photocurrent response, EIS, CV curves and Mott-Schottky plots. In the transient photocurrent response (Fig. 8 a), the intensities present the order of 0 wt.% < 10 wt.% < 30 wt.% < 20 wt.% of Mn3O4 in Co9S8, suggesting that appropriate Mn3O4 decoration can improve the photogenerated electrons transport ability of Co9S8 nanosheets and increase the lifetime of electrons. Mn3O4(30 %)/Co9S8 shows a weaker transient photocurrent response than Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8, indicating the inhibiting effect of the overloaded Mn3O4 on the electrons transport ability of Mn3O4/Co9S8 composite. As discussed above, the nonuniformity and agglomeration of the overloaded Mn3O4 on Co9S8 (Fig. 2) lower their interface area for electron transfer. In addition, the specific surface area is decreased after 30 wt.% of Mn3O4 is introduced into Co9S8 (Table S2), which decreases the light adsorption efficiency of material, and further lowers the photocarrier separation efficiency. The separation and transfer of e−-h+ pairs are analyzed by Nyquist plots from EIS test (Fig. 8b). In the Nyquist plots, pure Co9S8 shows the largest capacitive arc radius among the samples. The radius of Nyquist plot obviously decreases as 10 wt.% or 20 wt.% of Mn3O4 is introduced into Co9S8, and starts to increase as the content of Mn3O4 is over 30 wt.%. The Nyquist plot with smaller radius conveys that Co9S8 nanosheets loaded with moderate amount of Mn3O4 nanorods can obtain the most effective separation of photogenerated charges under visible-light irradiation. Accordingly, appropriate content of Mn3O4 can promote the electron transfer of composite, while the overloaded Mn3O4 increases the resistance to the separation of e−-h+ pairs, the rules of which will be reflected by the following photocatalytic performance. In the CV curves (Fig. S2), Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 presents more intense current signals of the anodic and cathodic peaks than the pristine Mn3O4 and Co9S8 samples. The observation indicates that the formation of heterojunction between two semiconductors increases the electrical conductivity of electrode, which promotes the electron transfer on the interface [73,74]. The above improvements in the photoelectric properties mainly benefit from two changes in the structure of Co9S8 after Mn3O4 is combined: (i) the high area of heterojunction can form between the interface of Mn3O4 nanorods and Co9S8 nanosheets (Fig. 2), which increases the light absorption and accelerates the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers [75]; (ii) Mn3O4 nanorods increase the specific surface area of Co9S8 (Fig. 7), and changes Co9S8 from nanoflowers to the smooth nanosheets (Fig. 1), which promote the electrons transfer on the surface of semiconductor. Therefore, Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 obtains the highest photocurrent response and the lowest impedance. The different values of electron donor density (Nd) bring about the presence of the internal electric field in the heterojunction interface between two composite semiconductors. The charges in a semiconductor with a larger Nd value easily transfer into another semiconductor with a smaller Nd value, resulting in the formation of a built-in electric field [76]. Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 8c) of Co9S8, Mn3O4 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 are displayed to analyze the attributes of the photocatalysts and to estimate the Nd values. Nd values of Co9S8 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 are calculated by using the equation of Nd = (2/eεε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1 [76,77], where e is the electron charge (1.6 × 10-19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of Co9S8, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.86 × 10-12 F·m-1), V is the potential applied at the electrode, and C is the electric capacity. The slopes of Co9S8 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 are 3.66 × 109 and 2.92 × 109, respectively, which are estimated from their Mott-Schottky curves. We approximatively take the dielectric constants of Co9S8 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 as a same value ε of the major component Co9S8. Therefore, the Nd values of Co9S8 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 are expressed as 3.86 × 1020/ε and 4.84 × 1020/ε cm−3, respectively. The higher Nd value of Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 indicates that the electron density of Co9S8 is increased by the introduction of a multicarrier Mn3O4. In the Mott-Schottky curves, Co9S8 and Mn3O4 present n-type (positive linear slope) and p-type (negative linear slope) semiconductor features, respectively. Once Co9S8 and Mn3O4 are tightly combined, a p-n heterojunction forms between them, and the transfer of the interfacial electrons is enhanced due to the diffusion of electrons from the multicarrier p-Mn3O4 to the minor-carrier n-Co9S8. The electron transfer between the p-n heterojunction of Mn3O4/Co9S8 is quite in accordance with a reported p→n pattern [76]. In addition, the separation of photoinduced carriers is promoted by the typical electron donor effect of the combined Mn3O4, which can be inferred from the more negative slope of Mott-Schottky curve presented by Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 than that of the pristine Co9S8. PL spectra (Fig. 8d) excited at 380 nm were recorded to further compare the photoinduced carriers separation efficiency of the as-prepared photocatalysts. Pure Co9S8 gives the most intensive emission peak at around 540 nm among the samples. All the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples present obvious decrease in PL emission intensity, indicating that Mn3O4 has a good ability to lower the recombination rate of the e−-h+ pairs in Co9S8 under visible light irradiation. The successive decrease in luminescence intensities of characteristic bands of Co9S8 with the increasing surface content of Mn3O4 (from 10 wt.% to 20 wt.%) establishes the existence of the charge transfer synergy between the components of Mn3O4 and Co9S8, leading to an extended lifetime of the excited states. However, the PL emission intensity starts to be enhanced as the Mn3O4 content is over 30 wt.%, possibly resulting from the surplus lattice defect in Co9S8 after Mn3O4 overloading to form the recombination sites of e−-h+ pairs [78]. TRPL spectra and decay times (τa) of the Co9S8 and Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples are shown in Fig. S3. It is observed that the lifetimes (τa) of the photogenerated charge carriers in the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples are prolonged compared with pure Co9S8, which is attributed to the accelerated interfacial electron transfer after the formation of Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction. Although Mn3O4(30 %)/Co9S8 shows a lower separation rate of the e−-h+ pairs than Mn3O4(10 %)/Co9S8 (Fig. 8d), the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers in Mn3O4(30 %)/Co9S8 (τa =11.44 ns) is longer than that in Mn3O4(10 %)/Co9S8 (τa =8.38 ns). Therefore, the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers possibly becomes the main reason for the higher photocatalytic activity of Mn3O4(30 %)/Co9S8 than that of Mn3O4(10 %)/Co9S8 for the following H2O2 generation. The photoelectric properties and regularities obtained from the transient photocurrent response, EIS, PL and TRPL measurements are almost in accordance with each other, and further provide the evidence for the different performances in photocatalytic production of H2O2."
9,Photocatalytic performance of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance of Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 Photocatalytic production of H2O2 over various photocatalysts are compared and analyzed by the PL spectra, as shown in Fig. 9 . In a previous work, a mM scale of H2O2 could be produced over MoS2 under visible light irradiation [47], which was comparable to that over most of the g-C3N4 based photocatalysts. In this work, we found that the pristine Co9S8 could obtain 0.97 mM of H2O2 for 6 h, which was 1.8 and 11.4 times in comparison to the pristine MoS2 and g-C3N4, respectively (Fig. 9a). Further, various metal oxides (CuO, ZnO, Ag2O, Mn3O4) were tried to be decorated on Co9S8 in order to increase the H2O2 productivity. Among the oxides, Mn3O4 increases the H2O2 concentration into 1.36 mM for 6 h, which shows the most significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity for Co9S8 (Fig. 9a). The order of H2O2 productivities (Fig. 9a) over Co9S8 loaded with different metal oxides is almost in accordance with that of the e−-h+ pairs recombination reflected by the PL spectra (Fig. 9b). It is known that a p-type semiconductor with surplus holes presents the typical downward band bending [79], especially contacting with water. Therefore, it is expected that H2O2 production via the route of h+ generated OH (Eq. 3) is enhanced by the conjunction of Mn3O4 on the Co9S8 matrix. The content of Mn3O4 in Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 composite is optimized via H2O2 photoproduction, as shown in Fig. 10 a. It is observed that pure Mn3O4 obtains only 0.08 mM of H2O2 for 6 h, showing almost no activity for H2O2 photoproduction. The H2O2 concentration increases with Mn3O4 content until it reaches 20 wt.% for Co9S8 matrix. Combined with the characterization results, the Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 sample possessing the increased surface area and well dispersed Mn3O4 nanorods in structure, and the improved photoelectrons transportability, carrier density and inhibition ability of the e−-h+ pairs recombination in photoelectric property, reasonably achieving the highest H2O2 productivity among the Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples. Mn3O4(30 %)/Co9S8 shows weakening in photocatalytic performance compared with Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8, resulting from the nonuniform Mn3O4 species and the high recombination rate of the e−-h+ pairs as the Mn3O4 content comes up to 30 wt.%. Table S2 lists the photocatalytic productivity of H2O2 over per specific surface area of catalyst. We can see that the photocatalytic efficiency gradually decreases with the increase in specific surface area of catalyst. The following investigations are carried out by using Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 as the optimal photocatalyst. Fig. 10b shows the effect of pH on H2O2 production. H2O2 productivity of 6 h can be increased to 1.6 mM in the alkaline medium, which is 1.4 times as that in the neutral medium, and it dramatically decreases in the acidic medium. The observation can be explained by that the OH− in alkaline solution is a good scavenger of hole to form numerous OH for H2O2 generation via a two- OH-reaction pathway. It is also observed that the H2O2 productions rate start to decelerate after 1 h (Fig. 10 a, b), which is possibly attributed to the following cases. i) The initial H2O2 concentration is low, resulting in a much lower photocatalytic decomposition rate of H2O2. Therefore, the apparent formation rate of H2O2 is higher in a short reaction time. But the decomposition rate of H2O2 gradually increases with the concentration of generated H2O2 to show a lower apparent formation rate after 1 h. ii) The following H2O2 poisoning experiment indicates that the accumulated H2O2 gives an inactivation effect on the photocatalyst, which gradually lowers the formation rate of H2O2. Photocatalytic H2O2 production in the ambient atmosphere and in the pure O2 was also compared, as shown in Fig. 10c. Pure O2 as oxidant can increase the H2O2 concentration from 1.6 mM to 1.7 mM in comparison to air, but the increased level is not so considerable. This result shows that the present photocatalysis system can take full advantage of the H2O dissolved O2 (DO: 8.0–9.0 mg L−1) and the H2O/h+ formed O2 (Eq. (1)), which can meaningfully save the additional oxidant pure O2 gas for H2O2 generation. In another aspect, it is very likely that the present H2O2 photoproduction system is not O2− dependent due to the role of Z‐scheme heterojunction, which will be verified by the following mechanism study. In the recycling test, the spent photocatalyst Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 was analyzed by the XPS, XRD and SEM techniques, as shown in Fig. S4. The XPS spectra (Fig. S4a-e) show that the surface chemical state and composition of the spent photocatalyst remain stable in comparison to that of the fresh one (Fig. 6). The SEM image (Fig. S4f) and XRD pattern (Fig. S4g) respectively present the original morphology and structure of Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 (Figs. 1 and 4). Accordingly, the adsorbed peroxide species possibly become the main factor that influences the recyclability of the catalyst. In order to verify this effect, a fresh Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 catalyst was dispersed into 20 mL of H2O2 solution (5 mM), stirred for 2 h and dried at 50 °C to be reused for photocatalytic H2O2 production. As shown in Fig. S5, the H2O2 poisoned catalyst indeed shows decrease in the H2O2 productivity compared with the fresh one. For regeneration, the spent photocatalyst of every cycle was treated by a solution containing CH3CSNH2 and NaOH in order to eliminate the adsorbed peroxide species. The regenerated photocatalyst shows good recyclability in photoproduction of H2O2 and can be reused for 4 cycles (Fig. 10d). Fig. S6 shows the AQY values for photocatalytic production of H2O2 over Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 under various monochromatic light irradiations. The variation tendency of the AQY values well matches with the diffuse reflectance spectrum. In detail, the AQY value of 320 nm near the UV region is lower than those of other visible light regions, indicating that the reaction is indeed driven by the visible light irradiation. The highest AQY can achieve 26.33 % at around 450 nm. As the light absorption declines from 450 to 750 nm, the AQY values gradually decrease. Photocatalytic performance of the Mn3O4/Co9S8 composite is compared with that in other works, which are summarized in Table S3. With the efficient apparent quantum yield, the present Mn3O4/Co9S8 system exhibits considerable H2O2 productivity by saving the organic electron donors and pure O2, which has the potential to be further enhanced after appropriate modification. Fig. S7a shows the photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition over the Co9S8 and Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 samples to compare the competition between the formation and decomposition of H2O2. Obviously, each Mn3O4(x)/Co9S8 sample shows higher decomposition rate of H2O2 than the pristine Co9S8, and the decomposition increases with the Mn3O4 content, because Mn3O4 usually acts as the Fenton-like active center to catalyze the H2O2 decomposition. The rate constants of photocatalytic H2O2 production (Kf, mM h−1) and decomposition (Kd, h−1) are assumed by the zero-order and the first-order kinetics, respectively [15,80]. Fig. S7b gives the fitted lines from Fig. S7a by a pseudo-first-order kinetics, from which the Kd values can be estimated. The Kf values are estimated by fitting the data of Fig. 10a combined with the equation of [H2O2] = kf/kd(1-exp(-kdt)). Fig. S7c shows the formation rate constants (Kf) and decomposition rate constants (Kd) of H2O2. The kd value of Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 is a little higher than that of pure Co9S8, but Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 gives more than 2-fold enhancement in kf value compared to pure Co9S8. The competitive reactions indicate that Co9S8 mainly catalyzes the formation of H2O2, which is superior to the decomposition. In addition, the overall H2O2 formation over the Mn3O4/Co9S8 composite greatly exceeds the H2O2 decomposition catalyzed by the introduced Mn3O4. However, the decomposition rate constant is gradually increased as the Mn3O4 content reaches 30 wt.%, weakening the net formation of H2O2. Therefore, moderate amount of Mn3O4 can exhibit the positive effect and plays the dominant role in construction of the heterojunction with Co9S8 to further increase the H2O2 formation rate constant."
10,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra and UPS spectra were measured to investigate the band structures of Mn3O4, Co9S8 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 (Fig. 11 ). In Fig. 11a, the pristine Co9S8 shows a broad absorption in the range of 350−800 nm, indicating that Co9S8 possesses very strong light harvesting capacity in the visible region [52,53]. The pristine Mn3O4 shows a light absorption capacity mainly in the region of 250−570 nm, which agrees with the reported wide direct band gap values around 2.0–2.3 eV [56,57,62]. Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 exhibits a stronger absorption band than the pristine Co9S8. As reported similarly, the Mn3O4 component can improve the photo-responsive ability of a host semiconductor [57,62]; in addition, the improved pores and surface structure (Fig. 7) of the Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 composite provides multiple reflections inside the cavity of the hollow or porous structure [52]. Therefore, the light absorption of Co9S8 can be enhanced benefiting by the hybridization with Mn3O4. Transformation of UV–vis diffuse reflectance (Fig. 11b) by using the Kubelka-Munk function was employed to determine the band gaps of the compared samples [81]. The band gap energy is calculated by the equation of αhv = A(hv - Eg)n/2 , where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck constant, v is light frequency, A is factor depended on the inter band transition possibility, E g is the energy band gap, and n = 1 for the two direct transition semiconductors Mn3O4 [57] and Co9S8 [52]. Therefore, the band gaps (E g ) of Mn3O4 and Co9S8 are obtained to be 2.07 and 1.49 eV, respectively. The two pristine semiconductors meet the primary requirement for construction of a Z-scheme system, because the band gaps of them are narrower than 3.0 eV [52]. In addition, the band gap of Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 is increased from 1.49 eV to 1.66 eV after Co9S8 is combined with Mn3O4, which provides more appropriate band structure for the photoproduction of H2O2. Fig. 11c presents the high and low kinetic energy regions in the UPS spectra of Mn3O4, Co9S8 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8. The Fermi level (E F ), valence band maximum (E VBM ) and conduction band minimum (E CBM ) are determined by the equations of E F = E L , E VBM = hν - E H + E L , E CBM = hν - E H + E L - E g , respectively [82]. In the equations, the low kinetic energy cutoff (E L ) and high kinetic energy cutoff (E H ) values are obtained from the corresponding tangent lines in each region, hν is the incident photon energy (21.22 eV) in UPS, and E g is the energy bandgap. The absolute potential energy of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) is 4.44 ± 0.02 V at 25 °C, according to which the energy levels of the photocatalysts are calculated and listed in Table S4. Active species trapping experiments were performed to clarify the mechanism of the present H2O2 photoproduction system (Fig. 12 a). The scavengers including TBA, N2, C2H5OH and AgNO3 were employed to trap or eliminate the OH, O2 −, h+ and e− radicals, respectively. In addition, ESR was performed to probe the contributive radicals for H2O2 photoproduction (Fig. 12b, c). As shown in Fig. 12a, the e− scavenger (AgNO3) almost depresses the H2O2 productivity to an undetectable level, indicating that the Mn3O4/Co9S8 increased electrons are the major active species contributing to the two-electron reduction of O2 as the major channel of H2O2 production (Eqs. (1) and (2)). Secondarily, the h+ scavenger (C2H5OH) also shows remarkable inhibiting effect on H2O2 production. This observation suggests another channel that the alkaline medium provides significant OH− to be combined with h+ to generate quite a number of OH radicals (Eq. (3)), which further contributes to the H2O2 generation (Eq. (4)). It should be noted that the OH scavenger (TBA) does not show so obvious inhibiting effect as the h+ scavenger, indicating that the alkaline water with h+ can supplement a certain amount of the trapped OH for H2O2 generation. In the ESR spectra (Fig. 12b), Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 presents the more intense DMPO- OH signals than the pristine Mn3O4, while Co9S8 shows no DMPO- OH signals, indicating that the two OH combination as another channel (Eqs. (3) and (4)) for H2O2 generation can be enhanced after Co9S8 combining with Mn3O4, while single Co9S8 achieves only one channel (Eqs. (1) and (2)). The high H2O2 productivity in the presence of the O2− inhibitor (N2) indicates that this H2O2 photoproduction system does not depend on the O2− too much. Therefore, the H2O dissolved O2 can provide sufficient oxidant to directly generate H2O2 in the ambient atmosphere (Fig. 10c) bypassing the O2− route ( O2− + 2H+ + e− → H2O2). As shown in the ESR spectra (Fig. 12c), all the photocatalysts give almost no DMPO- O2 − signals, which is in accordance with the above O2− inhibition experiment. Scheme 2 presents the proposed Z-scheme and type-II charge transfer mechanisms for p-Mn3O4/n-Co9S8 heterojunction in photocatalytic H2O2 production. For the present Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction, since Co9S8 possesses a lower Fermi level than Mn3O4 (Table S4), the ECBM and EVBM of Co9S8 bend upward, and those of Mn3O4 bend downward at the interface (Scheme 2a). Under this band bending structure, photogenerated charges transfer through a Z-scheme mechanism, where photogenerated electrons of Mn3O4 and photogenerated holes of Co9S8 are recombined at the interface according to the direction of band bending. If Mn3O4/Co9S8 follows the type II mechanism, the ECBM and EVBM of Co9S8 should bend downward, and those of Mn3O4 should bend upward at the interface (Scheme 2b), the principle of which is contrary to the Fermi level values of Co9S8 and Mn3O4 (Table S4). Therefore, type II fails to occur on Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction. ESR measurements can provide the further information to verify the charge transfer mechanism. If Mn3O4/Co9S8 follows the type II mechanism, the electrons in CB of Co9S8 with lower ECB value should transfer into CB of Mn3O4 with higher ECB value, and the holes in VB of Mn3O4 with higher EVB value should transfer into VB of Co9S8 with lower EVB value (Scheme 2b). Therefore, the two-electron reduction of O2 to generate H2O2 should occur on the CB of Mn3O4, and the two ·OH combination to generate H2O2 should occur on the VB of Co9S8, due to the accumulation of electrons and holes, respectively. Theoretically, the former reaction can occur, because the ECB value of Mn3O4 (-0.04 V) is more negative than the potential of O2/H2O2 (0.68 V); whereas the latter reaction fails to occur due to the more positive potential of OH−/ OH (1.99 V) than the EVB value (1.19 V) of Co9S8. In fact, Co9S8 gives no DMPO- OH signals in the ESR spectra (Fig. 12b), confirming that the two OH combination can not occur on the VB of Co9S8. As a result, type II mechanism is unsuitable for the Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction. A gold deposition experiment was designed in order to further verify the possibility of Z-scheme from another way. In brief, 0.1 g of Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 powder was dispersed in 20 mL of HAuCl4 solution (1.2 mM). The mixture was irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp equipping with a cooling system and a cut-off filter, and was continuously stirred for 4 h. The solid was washed by water, centrifuged, and dried at 50 °C overnight to be analyzed by the TEM-Mapping technique (Fig. S8). If there is a Z-scheme for the Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction, quite a lot of electrons will be accumulated in the CB of Co9S8, resulting from the photoexcited electrons transfer from the CB of Mn3O4 into the VB of Co9S8 and their recombination with holes of Co9S8. Therefore, gold deposition will occur via the reduction of electrons, and will be observed on a component with the abundant electrons. As shown in Fig. S8a, the Au element mainly distributes in the coexisting regions of Co and S elements, indicating that gold can be deposited on the Co9S8 component. While some long and narrow regions of Mn and O coexistence are empty in the Au mapping, indicating that gold deposition does not occur on Mn3O4 nanorods. Major elements content distribution can be observed from the EDS spectrum (Fig. S8b). Those observations well verify the existence of Z-scheme for Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction. According to the above findings, a Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism for the p-Mn3O4/n-Co9S8 heterostructure is finally proposed (Scheme 2a). The photoexcited electrons in CB of Mn3O4 transfer into VB of Co9S8, and recombine with the photogenerated holes of VB in Co9S8 according to the direction of band bending. Therefore, the CB of Co9S8 and the VB of Mn3O4 are responsible for the electrons and the holes involved reactions, respectively. Since the ECB value of Co9S8 (−0.30 V) is more negative than the potential of O2/H2O2 (0.68 V), the electrons in CB of Co9S8 are responsible for the two-electron reduction of O2 (Channel 1 in Scheme 2a), which is the major channel for H2O2 production. For the auxiliary channel (Channel 2 in Scheme 2a), the holes in the VB of Mn3O4 could achieve the generation of OH for the further H2O2 production due to the more positive EVB value (2.03 V) of Mn3O4 than the potential of OH−/ OH (1.99 V); while the holes in single Co9S8 with a more negative EVB value (1.19 V) can not achieve this channel. ESR spectra (Fig. 12b) can provide the evidence for the OH channel, in which the DMPO- OH signals of single Mn3O4 and Mn3O4/Co9S8 can be detected, also indicating that the auxiliary channel is opened by the Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction. In addition, the ECB values of Mn3O4 (−0.04 V) and Co9S8 (−0.30 V) are both more positive than the redox potential of O2/ O2 − (−0.33 V). Therefore, the electrons in the CB of the two semiconductors could hardly convert O2 into O2 −, which blocks the following generation of H2O2 ( O2− + 2H+ + e− → H2O2). As a support, the DMPO- O2 − signals fail to be detected for all the photocatalysts in ESR spectra (Fig. 12c). The electrons from the CB of Mn3O4 are responsible for combining with the holes from the VB of Co9S8 between the p-Mn3O4/n-Co9S8 heterojunction at their contacting interface, improving the overall separation efficiency of the photocarriers. The photoinduced electrons migrate to the n-type Co9S8, and the photogenerated holes migrate to the p-type Mn3O4 under the internal electric field [76], which is assigned to the Z-type migration mechanism for the Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction. The accumulated electrons on the more negative CB of Co9S8 directly convert O2 into H2O2, while the accumulated holes remaining on the more positive VB of Mn3O4 produce abundant OH for H2O2 generation. Finally, the photoactivity is remarkably boosted."
11,In situ application of photogenerated H2O2,"3.5 In situ application of photogenerated H2O2 Using the photogenerated H2O2 in situ in oxidation processes is a good way to put the system into practice. The samples Co9S8 and Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 were compared in the designed degradation of MB and RhB dyes by the in-situ-H2O2 oxidation (Fig. 13 ), during which AgNO3 was added in order to testify the contribution of photogenerated H2O2 for dyes oxidation. The samples show the similar observations for degradation of the two dyes. Both the single Mn3O4 and Co9S8 show the poor photocatalytic activity for the two dyes degradation due to the low H2O2 concentration produced by Mn3O4 and the low Fenton catalytic activity of Co9S8, respectively. Compared with pure Co9S8, Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 achieves an obvious enhancement in the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. The enhancement can be explained by two factors: i) Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 can obtain higher productivity of in situ H2O2 for dyes oxidation than Co9S8 (Fig. 10a), ii) Mn species can act as the active sites and provide the synergistic effect to enhance the catalytic performance in the Fenton-like process [83,84]. For comparison, Fig. S9 supplements the dyes degradation percentage with the commercial H2O2 in the absence of photocatalyst, and with the simply mixed Mn3O4-Co9S8 powder. There is almost no degradation for dyes with H2O2 only. Compared with the heterojunction, the mechanical mixed Mn3O4-Co9S8 powder shows obvious decrease in dyes degradation, because there is no interface between the two solids, and thus it has low photocarrier separation efficiency to decrease the H2O2 production. Since the single Mn3O4 gives almost no activity for H2O2 production (Fig. 10a), the enhanced H2O2 productivity over Mn3O4/Co9S8 composite is attributed to the formation of heterojunction after Mn3O4 is introduced into Co9S8. In addition, single Mn3O4 also shows much lower dyes degradation rate than the Mn3O4/Co9S8 composite due to the low H2O2 productivity, but the introduced Mn3O4 can act as the active center to enhance the Fenton-like reaction for dyes degradation. Therefore, Mn3O4 not only provides active center for the Fenton-like reaction, but also prominently increase the H2O2 productivity for Co9S8 parent material. In Fig. 13, it is observed that the degradation rates of dyes over Mn3O4(20 %)/Co9S8 are lowered with the addition of AgNO3. AgNO3 shows the remarkable inhibiting effect on H2O2 production (Fig. 12a), therefore H2O2 can not sufficiently generate for dyes oxidation, indicating the important role of the photogenerated H2O2 as an in situ oxidant. Fig. S10 gives the H2O2 productivity dependent dyes degradation rate. It is seen that the degradation rates of the two dyes obviously increase with the net H2O2 productivity at the same reaction time, which further confirms the contribution of the in situ H2O2 oxidation. A mechanism of the Fenton-like system with the in-situ-H2O2 oxidation is proposed, as shown in Scheme 3 . It has been confirmed that the two-electron reduction of O2 is the major channel for H2O2 photoproduction (Route 1), and the two OH combination is an auxiliary channel (Route 2). There is an equilibrium between the as-prepared H2O2 and the OH radicals. Once a dye is involved in the H2O2 photoproduction system, the OH radicals are consumed by the dye over the Fenton-like active center Mn3O4 on Co9S8 (Route 3, 4). Therefore, the equilibrium is broken and shifts into the OH generating direction. Most of the newly generated OH radicals participate in dye degradation, while the other OH radicals combine with each other catalyzed by the interface of Mn3O4/Co9S8 heterojunction to continue to produce H2O2 (Route 5). The proposed in-situ-H2O2-Fenton system has the potential to become a cost-efficient and eco-friendly advanced oxidation process due to the nonuse of the additional oxidant and the polluting Fe containing catalyst."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, a Z-scheme photocatalytic H2O2 production system was constructed by using a nanocomposite of p-type Mn3O4 and n-type Co9S8 semiconductors with p-n heterostructure. The Mn3O4/Co9S8 composites were synthesized via a simple strategy at ambient conditions. Both the Co9S8 and the Mn3O4 phase in composites achieved the morphology and structure regulations with the change of Mn3O4 content. The regulation effect played an important role in the improvement of the electrons transport ability, electrons donor density, and separation rate of the e−-h+ pairs for the composites. The optimized Z-scheme Mn3O4/Co9S8 obtained 1.6 mM of H2O2 for 6 h in alkaline medium without the addition of organic electron donors and pure O2, and showed good recyclability. Energy band calculations and active species trapping experiments proposed the Z-scheme mechanism that the electrons in the CB of the p-type Mn3O4 migrated into the VB of the n-type Co9S8, and combined with the holes in the heterojunction formed between their interface. The photocatalytic H2O2 production system followed a two-channel pathway, and thus the H2O2 productivity was significantly improved. The electrons in Co9S8 predominantly accomplished the major channel of two-electron reduction of O2 for H2O2 production, while the holes in Mn3O4 involved in the generation of OH to be an auxiliary channel. Finally, the photogenerated H2O2 achieved an efficient in situ use for MB and RhB dyes degradation over the Mn3O4/Co9S8 photocatalyst."
