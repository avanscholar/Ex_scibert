0,Introduction,"The decline of nonrenewable sources of supply of liquid fuels is accelerating because of global growth of population and increased consumption rate of transportation and energy generating fuels. Consumption of liquid fuels derived from oil, natural gas, coal, shale oil, and shale gas, imposes unbearable environmental burdens on urban communities and immensely contributes to the global climate change. Environmental concerns and rapid decline of nonrenewable sources of energy have made the diversity of the basket of energy of all nations imperative, and is an undeniable energy security issue worldwide. The price of nonrenewable fossil energy sources is continuously changing. The price change of these commodities is unpredictable, and is oftentimes a shock to the global economy in general, and to the economy of fossil fuel importing and exporting countries, in specific. For instance, a decline in oil prices leads to a negative impact on both real and total oil trade balances, while an increase in oil prices has a positive impact on real oil trade balance, but it is harmful to the total oil trade balance [1]. One environmentally responsible and economically promising approach to energy diversification is conversion of waste bio-resources through various pyrolysis processes. Over the last several decades, in quest for diversification of supply side of energy, various researchers have investigated thermochemical pathways for the conversion of a variety of readily available and inexpensive biomass samples to biofuels (e.g., wood and its residues [2,3], agricultural wastes [4], municipal solid waste (MSW) [5,6], animal wastes [7], wastes of food industry [8], aquatic plants and algae [9], among others). Among different thermal processes for conversion of biomass to biofuel, pyrolysis has received more attention because of its ability to produce biofuel with high yields (i.e., high biofuel/dry biomass ratio). In the 1970s, pyrolysis was used for converting biomass to valuable products, and this technique was rapidly developed [10]. Sugarcane is among the principal agricultural crops, which is native to the moderate to tropical climates. About 1.6 billion tons per annum (BT/y) of sugarcane are produced worldwide. It generates about 279 million metric tons/y (MT/y) of biomass residues [11]. This calls for a proper strategy to benefit from this huge amount of agricultural waste. Bagasse possesses a fibrous texture and is used in a variety of industrial activities such as the production of fuel, paper, building materials, preparation of organic fertilizers, as the substrate for the production of edible mushrooms, yeast production, and in the feeding of ruminants [12]. Pyrolysis of bagasse for the production of biofuel, biochar and non-condensable gases (i.e., CO, CO2, CH4, and H2) has been subject to a large number of investigations in the two last decades (Pèrez et al. [13], Rofiqul Islam et al. [14,15], Erlich et al. [16], Keown et al. [17], Tsai et al. [18], Asadullah et al. [4], Parihar et al. [19], Peng and Wu [20], Hugo [21], Carrier et al. [22], Xu et al. [23], Ounas et al. [24], Mesa-pèrez et al. [25], Durange et al. [26], Aboyade et al. [27], Mantilla et al. [28], Montoya et al. [29], Lin and Chen [30], Chen et al. [31], Luo et al. [32], Parthasarathy and Narayanan [33], Gonçalves et al. [34], Huang et al. [35], among others). The pyrolysis oil is environmentally-friendly, but because it contains a considerable amount of oxygenated compounds and carboxylic acids, its fuel properties are not similar to those of fossil fuels. The high composition of carboxylic acids renders bio-fuel a low caloric value, acidic behavior and corrosiveness, and unstable organizational structure. There are several upgrading techniques for elimination or reduction of these harmful compounds from fuels. Among them, co-pyrolysis [36–39], catalytic pyrolysis [40–43], catalytic co-pyrolysis [44,45] and pretreatment of biomass [46] are the best methods because they are simple, inexpensive, and they need not complicated equipment. Co-pyrolysis is a simple and effective method for producing high quality bio-oil. Co-pyrolysis is similar to pyrolysis process, except that it involves two or more materials as feedstock. There exist a large number of studies showing that via co-pyrolysis and selection of proper feedstock, quality and quantity of bio-oil increases and a more stable and homogenous oil phase is obtained. In co-pyrolysis, if synergic effects of dissimilar compounds are observed, efficiency and calorific value of bio-oil may be increased, and water and oxygenated content may be diminished. Furthermore, should appropriate co-pyrolysis processes are developed by using bio-resources along with industrial synthetic wastes, it would highly assist to mitigate various aspects of environmental problems, waste management, and dependency on fossil fuels. Most of the reported co-pyrolysis investigations lack a priori considerations for taking advantages of synergic effects. They are mostly based on a haphazard sort of way or a trial-and-error procedure. In the present study, waste heavy paraffin is considered for co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse. The premise under which waste paraffin is considered for co-pyrolysis of bagasse in the present study is the fact that the effective hydrogen to carbon ratio of heavy paraffin is many times greater than sugarcane bagasse which suffers from hydrogen deficiency. As a result, presence of heavy paraffin in co-pyrolysis of bagasse would act as a source of hydrogen; and one expects that would change the compositional organization of the produced bio-oil, as well as its yield. On the other hand, use of Y-type zeolite catalyst is a matter of common practice as a gasoline booster in cracking and reforming processes. Use of this type of catalyst in pyrolysis would definitely improve the stability of the produced liquid phase; however, one cannot determine a priori, how the composition of bio-oil changes, and how it would affect the yield of bio-oil in pyrolysis. Based on our extensive literature survey, co-pyrolysis and catalytic co-pyrolysis of bagasse using waste heavy paraffin and Y-type zeolite catalysts have not been studied yet. Therefore, the aim and scope of the present work is to address the co-pyrolysis of bagasse using waste heavy paraffin, on one hand, and determining how use of Y-type zeolite would affect the yield of bio-oil. For these purposes, various operational conditions are considered, and catalytic and non-catalytic co-pyrolysis of intact and pretreated bagasse are examined."
1,Materials and methods,"Sugarcane bagasse was gifted by Debal Khozaei Co., Iran. Heavy paraffin was gifted by Sepahan Oil Company (SOC), Iran. The properties of heavy paraffin were determined and reported by SOC and are listed in Table 1 . HGY-A zeolite catalyst manufactured by Sinopec, China, was gifted by Shazand Oil Refinery, Iran. The specifications of the zeolite catalyst were provided by the donor and are listed in Table 2 . Industrial grade HCl was purchased from local vendors. Sodium hydroxide, glucose, xylose, mannose, arabinose and galactose were all analytical grade (Merck). The design of experiments was carried out using Minitab 17 software package. The results of all bio-oil yields in this paper are the average value of 3 runs and the errors in most cases are less that ±2%."
2,Sugarcane bagasse preparation and characterization,"2.1 Sugarcane bagasse preparation and characterization Sugarcane bagasse was dried at room temperature for a week. The dried bagasse was ground in a hammer mill to pass through a 20-mesh sieve (maximum particle size = 0.841 mm). To evaluate the effect of pretreatment on the composition of sugarcane bagasse, the presence of different hydrocarbons in pretreated and intact bagasse were analyzed according to NREL protocols (Sluiter et al., 2011) [47]. Elemental analysis of biomass was determined using CHNSO Analyzer (Elementar, Vario EL III). The elemental analysis results were used to calculate the gross higher heating value (GHHV), by Dulong relation equation [48], Equation (1), and the net lower heating value (NLHV) by Oasmaa equation [49], Equation (2). It should be mentioned that during the biomass combustion some water is produced which its latent heat of vaporization is equal to the difference between GHHV and NLHV values. (1) G H H V ( M J K g ) = 338.2 × C + 1442.8 × ( H − O 8 ) 1000 + 9.428 × S (2) N L H V ( M J K g ) = G H H V − ( 0.218 × H ) where C, H, O, and S are the mass fractions obtained from ultimate analysis. Sugarcane bagasse like other biomass materials is a hydrogen-deficient material. In order to decrease the char formation and increase the pyrolysis bio-oil products, heavy paraffin that has high hydrogen to carbon ratio, was added to sugarcane bagasse in some co-pyrolysis experiments. The relative hydrogen content of sugarcane bagasse and its blend with paraffin was estimated using Equation (3) suggested by Chen et al. [50]. (3) H C e f f = H − 2 O − 3 N − 2 S C where H, O, N, S, and C are mole percentage of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon, respectively. H/Ceff is hydrogen to effective carbon ratio. Total solids (TS) based on the dry weight and volatile solids (VS) of bagasse were determined using the following equations. (4) T S = W 3 − W 1 W 2 − W 1 × 100 (5) V S = W 3 − W 4 W 2 − W 1 × 100 where, W 1 is the weight of empty crucible, W 2 is the weight of crucible and wet solid, W 3 is the weight of the dried solid for 4 h at 105 °C, and W4 is the weight of ash and crucible after retaining the sample at 550 °C for 0.5 h."
3,Pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse,"2.2 Pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse Generally, sugarcane bagasse is pretreated by base [51,52] or acid [52,53]. In this research, we have utilized acid pretreatment because of the fact that using acid would retain the lignin fraction of the biomass and this fraction dominantly possesses an aromatic structure [54]. After drying and grinding, for pretreatment, 200 g of bagasse and 1000 cm3 of 30% w/w HCl were mixed in a 2 L beaker at room temperature for 3 h. The solid residue was neutralized with 1 M NaOH and washed with copious water distilled (ca 4 L). The neutralization was checked using pH paper. Further, the absence of inorganic Cl− ions was verified by addition of AgNO3 to the water collected from the washing of the pretreated bagasse. Subsequently, the pretreated bagasse sample was dried at room temperature for 48 h to prevent structural changes. The dried sample was saved in a plastic bag for future use."
4,Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis,"2.3 Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis The schematic of the experimental setup for pyrolysis experiments is shown in Fig. 1 . In each run, 60 gr of the feedstock mixture (paraffin to sugarcane bagasse weight ratio, 0:100, 10:90, 15:85, 20:80) was fed into a homemade stainless steel reactor and the reactor was placed in the furnace. Then, the furnace was purged with nitrogen with a volumetric flow rate of 50 mL/min and the feedstock was heated under vacuum with an average heating rate of 20 °C/min to the desired final temperature (i.e. 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C). The absolute pressure of the furnace was about 230 ± 5 mbar. The pyrolysis products of pretreated sugarcane bagasse were essentially char, liquid, and non-condensable gases. The volatiles produced from the pyrolysis of the feedstock were sucked by a vacuum pump and passed through four consecutive condensers and separated into liquid and permanent gases. As shown in Fig. 1, the coolant in the first condenser was air, the second one was a typical Dimroth condenser, and the third and fourth condensers were placed in a mixture of water and ice. The permanent gases (i.e., CO, CO2, CH4, and H2) were discharged into the air via the vacuum pump. In each run, the pyrolysis process was terminated after 1 h and at the specified temperature and pressure, by turning off the furnace and allowing the system to cool down under the nitrogen purge. The solid residue (char) and the liquid cuts in each stage were weighted after pyrolysis. Practically, the produced char of pyrolysis can be used as a solid fuel or can be converted to carbon black or active carbon. However, in this research we merely measured its amount for performing the mass balances. The weight of the permanent gas fraction was evaluated by overall mass balance."
5,Bio-oil characterization,"2.4 Bio-oil characterization The pH of oil products of pyrolysis (bio-oil) was measured by a Metrohm 744 pH meter at room temperature. The density and viscosity of bio-oil were measured by a 10 mL pycnometer and Cannon-Fenske viscometer tube size 100, respectively. The viscosity of bio-oil (in mm2/s) was measured at 98.89 °C according to ASTM D445 and D2515 standard methods. The bio-oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) (Agilent 5975C, BPX5 Column: 30 m (length) × 25 mm (diameter) × 25 μm (film thickness)). The heating of the GC-MS column was programmed to heat up the column to 50 °C, then to 280 °C with a rate of 3 °C/min and a split ratio of 1–100 and a run time of 40 m."
6,Thermal methods,"2.5 Thermal methods The results of the weight change of the sample (thermogravimetry, TG), the rate of weight change (differential thermogravimetry, DTG), and the enthalpy change (differential thermal analysis, DTA) can be expressed graphically. Separately, 6 mg of bagasse, 12 mg heavy paraffin, and 10 mg of a 50/50% w mixture of bagasse and heavy paraffin were analyzed by BÄHR-Thermoanalyse GmbH - Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer STA 503. Under an inert atmosphere of argon with a volumetric flow rate of 30 mL/min, the temperature of the samples in the Al2O3 crucible was gradually increased with an average rate of 20 °C/min from room temperature to 800 °C. Also, in order to achieve the DTA thermograms 17.31 mg of Al2O3 was used as a reference material."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Thermogravimetric analysis,"3.1 Thermogravimetric analysis The experimental results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) for sugarcane bagasse, heavy paraffin, and their mixture are shown in Fig. 2 . The results are recorded at the heating rate of 20 k min−1 under argon atmosphere. Fig. 2 (a) is divided into three stages, in the first stage (<270 °C), the mass loss is because of the evaporation of the imbedded moisture in biomass and in this step active cellulose (dehydrated cellulose) is produced by slight de-polymerization of cellulose. It is established that inter and intra-molecular dehydration occurs either by formation of covalent bonds and greater networking and thermal stability of the possible produced polymers, or, by creation of double bonds that increase the formation of benzene rings which are char precursors. The DTA diagram in Fig. 2 (a) is endothermic in the above temperature range which confirms the dehydration process. In addition, in this temperature range, in parallel to the dehydration and fragmentation of hemicellulose, side and end chains of hemicellulose undergo depolymerization. In the second stage (270–390 °C), the main de-volatilization and the major decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin occur. Specifically, hemicellulose (the light fraction) decomposes in the range of 270 and 330 °C, while cellulose degradation occurs between 330 and 390 °C. The destruction of hemicellulose takes place at lower temperatures than cellulose, due to the structural differences. Hemicellulose is a smaller branched carbohydrate which can be made of different mono-saccharides; cellulose is made of very long linear chains composed exclusively of glucose, held together by hydrogen bonding. Decomposition of lignin is observed over a wide temperature range of 270–800 °C. In the third stage (>390 °C), the aromatization process of lignin leads to a slight weight loss. In this Figure, the end section of the DTA diagram is exothermic. Formation of olefins in thermal cracking is endothermic and aromatization of olefins is exothermic. Thus, the end section of the DTA diagram in Fig. 2 (a) confirms the aromatization of olefin hydrocarbons produced in the cracking of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [21,55]. Fig. 2 (b) belongs to the heavy paraffin sample. The TGA diagram for paraffin shows one peak at 375 °C and its decomposition takes place between 220 and 435 °C. At the beginning of the TGA diagram, some weight gain is observed, which is because of the initial reactions and the formation of products with higher molecular weights and their return into the sample container. Fig. 2 (c) presents the thermal analysis results for a mixture of bagasse (50% w) and heavy paraffin (50% w). The comparison of Fig. 2 (c) with Fig. 2 (a) and (b) reveals that the main peaks of the DTG diagram for the mixture of bagasse and paraffin (50/50% w) are essentially at the corresponding temperatures of the peaks observed for the thermal analysis of bagasse and heavy paraffin alone and only the peak for paraffin is slightly shifted to the higher temperature. This observation is similar to what that is reported in Ref. [56]. This behavior may be attributed to the mass transfer resistances induced by bagasse in coexistence with heavy paraffin. The total weight loss at 800 °C is 80.89%, 96.55%, and 87.99% for sugarcane bagasse, heavy paraffin, and their mixture, respectively. It should be added that the total weight loss is higher for the heavy paraffin. This is because of the fact that heavy paraffin is a mixture of hydrocarbons that are highly volatile at elevated temperatures and its ash is practically zero."
9,Effect of temperature on pyrolysis bio-oil yield,"3.2 Effect of temperature on pyrolysis bio-oil yield Four temperatures (i.e., 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C) were considered for studying the impact of temperature on the bulk yield of the pyrolysis bio-oil. Fig. 3 presents how the bio-oil yield changes with temperature in various cases. For intact bagasse alone, the yield of the produced bio-oil is almost unchanged with increased temperature. However, the char and gas yields are decreased and increased, respectively. These results are consistent with the TGA results discussed in section 3.1. The main portion of bagasse is degraded at temperatures lower than 400 °C, and a slight weight loss is observed at higher temperatures. For bagasse alone, the highest bio-oil yield is obtained at 600 °C. As it pertains to heavy paraffin, one can see from Fig. 3 (b) that with increasing the temperature from 400 to 700 °C the bio-oil yield is increased to a maximum value at about 600 °C and then it is decreased. The char yield is practically zero for pyrolysis of heavy paraffin. On the other hand, the gas yield is decreased to a minimum at 600 °C and then it goes up at higher temperatures. It is speculated that at temperatures higher than 600 °C, the secondary cracking reactions and decomposition of bio-oil vapors to lighter hydrocarbons are responsible for the increased gas yield and reduced bio-oil yield. However, at temperatures below 500 °C, the fragmentation reactions are dominant. Since, the highest bio-oil yields were achieved at 600 °C, and this temperature is also reported in the literature [40,57], the pyrolysis of combination of bagasse and heavy paraffin in the presence and absence of zeolite catalyst was performed at 600 °C. In Fig. 3 (c) one can compare the bio-oil bulk yield for bagasse, heavy paraffin and a mixture thereof with and without HGA-Y zeolite catalyst. This Figure vividly shows that the addition of 15% w of heavy paraffin has increased the bio-oil yield by about 11%. The reason for such a considerable increase in bio-oil yield is definitely because of the fact that the heavy paraffin has high hydrogen to carbon ratio, and acts as a source for in situ hydrogen supply. The presence of this hydrogen-rich material has a remarkable impact on the yield and composition of the pyrolysis bio-oil. On the other hand, these results reveal that the addition of zeolite catalyst to the mixture of bagasse and heavy paraffin reduces the bio-oil yield. This means that the role of the zeolite catalyst is merely reduction of the oxygenated compounds as expected, and the catalyst does not improve the bio-oil yield."
10,Effect of HGY-A zeolite catalyst on bio-oil yield of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of bagasse,"3.3 Effect of HGY-A zeolite catalyst on bio-oil yield of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of bagasse In all of the experiments in this part of the study, the pyrolysis temperature was set to 600 °C and the catalyst ratios used were 0, 10, and 20% w. From Fig. 4 (a), the bio-oil, gas, and solid yields remained almost unchanged with an increase in catalyst ratio. Fig. 4 (b) presents the effect of catalyst on the bio-oil yield produced by co-pyrolysis of bagasse and heavy paraffin (90:10 w:w). These results indicate that catalytic co-pyrolysis of bagasse and heavy paraffin leads to reduction of the bio-oil yield by about 18%, and in parallel, it increases the yield of char by about the same value of 18%, and it has no impact on the amount of the produced gas. As it was mentioned before, these data confirms that the role of zeolite catalyst in pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of bagasse is merely to change the composition of the produced bio-oil."
11,Features of co-pyrolysis of bagasse and heavy paraffin,"3.4 Features of co-pyrolysis of bagasse and heavy paraffin The elemental composition of sugarcane bagasse, paraffin, and their mixtures are listed in Table 3 . The results listed in Table 3 indicate that the effective hydrogen to carbon ratio is remarkably greater for paraffin compared with intact and pretreated bagasse, and the addition of heavy paraffin to each one of the two kinds of biomass improves their hydrogen deficiency. Therefore, heavy paraffin can be regarded as an in situ solid source of supply of hydrogen in catalytic and non-catalytic co-pyrolysis of bagasse. Hence, it is expected that the addition of heavy paraffin to intact and pretreated bagasse would change the yields of pyrolysis products as well as the composition of the produced bio-oil. Fig. 5 shows how the yield of pyrolysis of intact bagasse is changed when heavy paraffin is added to intact bagasse at 600 °C. By addition of 10% w to bagasse the yield of bio-oil of co-pyrolysis is increased by about 11% and at the same time, roughly, about the same percent the yield of gas is reduced. Meanwhile, the yield of char is almost remained unchanged. This result is in compliance with the conservation of mass. The addition of 15% w to bagasse hardly changes the yield of co-pyrolysis products, and the slight changes are within the order of experimental errors involved. However, co-pyrolysis of bagasse with 20% w of heavy paraffin leads to reduced bio-oil product, and beyond that it did not have any positive impact on the production of bio-oil. Clearly, the reaction networks of co-pyrolysis of bagasse are much more complicated than that of simple pyrolysis of bagasse, and it is extremely difficult if not next to impossible to give a rigorous analysis of the reaction networks involved in both. However, one can speculate that because of the fact that heavy paraffin is way more amenable to bond breakdown at lower temperatures, it is highly likely that highly active free radicals including hydrogen free radicals are produced first from pyrolysis of heavy paraffin at temperatures around 400 °C. The production of free radical would increase the number of condensation reactions, and presence of hydrogen free radicals would increase the hydrogenolysis reactions at elevated temperatures above 400 °C, hence an increased bio-oil yield is achieved. On the other hand, when the heavy paraffin is increased beyond 15% w, the intensity of hydrocarbon and hydrogen free radicals would prevail. This in turn, would lead to rapid capping of hydrocarbon free radicals and production of more gaseous hydrocarbons, and increased yield of gaseous products."
12,Effect of acidic pretreatment on composition ingredients of bagasse,"3.5 Effect of acidic pretreatment on composition ingredients of bagasse To evaluate the effect of acid pretreatment on composition of ingredients of the bagasse matrix, the carbohydrates, lignin, and ash in the pretreated and untreated samples were determined via NREL protocols [46], and are listed in Table 4 . This table presents the compositions of different carbohydrates for pretreated and intact bagasse. These results show that by acidic pretreatment of bagasse, the glucan content is increased by about 27% w. The xylan content is totally removed, and the total lignin which is the sum of soluble and insoluble lignin in acid is increased by about 1% w. Thus, one can conclude that the acidic pretreatment removes hemicelluloses and increases the relative total lignin content of the pretreated bagasse. In addition, for raw bagasse samples, the total solids content and volatile solids using Equations (4) and (5) would be 94.6% and 94.1%, respectively. Accordingly, these values for pretreated bagasse are 97.1% and 95.3%, respectively. The values of pertinent parameters for calculation of total solids and volatile solids are listed in Table 5 ."
13,Effect of pretreatment on products yields,"3.6 Effect of pretreatment on products yields The results of pyrolysis of intact and acid pretreated bagasse at 600 °C are presented in Fig. 6 . These experimental results demonstrate the acidic pretreatment of bagasse leads to reduction of bio-oil yield by about 11%, while it increases the yield of char and gas by about 9% and 2%, respectively. Similar effects are reported by Zhou et al. [58] and Wang et al. [59]. It is speculated that remains of inorganics in the pretreated bagasse as well as compositional changes presented in previous section are responsible for this behavior. The remaining inorganic phase in the pretreated bagasse is usually in form of salts and oxides. It is speculated that these inorganic components play an inhibition role with regard to the decomposition and fragmentation reactions involved in pyrolysis in one hand, and play a catalytic role with regard to the polymerization and oligomerization reactions [60] and leads to increased char yield. That in turn leads to formation of more char and gas fractions. Furthermore, the presence of the inorganic phase in the treated bagasse favors inter- and or intra-molecular chain scission and dehydration reactions which winds up in increasing the yield of char and decreasing the yield of bio-oil [55]. Moreover, acidic pretreatment of bagasse results in the solubility of the hemicellulose and to a lesser extent lignin. This increases the accessibility to cellulose. However, the acidic pretreatment decreases the carbohydrates of the biomass and as a result reduces the yield of the liquid fraction [61]."
14,Study of possible interaction of operational conditions,"3.7 Study of possible interaction of operational conditions To study the possible interaction between operational parameters on the bulk yields of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of bagasse, the minimum number of experiments and various combinations of operational conditions were determined by design of experiments methodology and use of Taguchi method. Four operational conditions, i.e., presence or absence of heavy paraffin, temperature, presence or absence of zeolite catalyst, and pretreated or intact bagasse with different levels were considered. The total number of 16 experiments was obtained. The results of experimental design are listed in Table 6 . Each one of the experiments listed in Table 6 was performed three times. Fig. 7 shows the product yields for pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of intact bagasse and acidic pretreated bagasse at various operational conditions based on the results obtained from the design of experiments. In Fig. 7 (a) and (b), effects of the interactions between different operating conditions on the bulk yield of the products are demonstrated. In these Figures, the yield of gas is obtained by mass balance. From Fig. 7 (a), it is revealed that the best result with regard to the bio-oil yield is achieved when 15% heavy paraffin is added to intact bagasse and the pyrolysis is carried out at 600 °C (ca 52%). Almost similar result is obtained for catalytic co-pyrolysis of intact bagasse at 700 °C. The slight difference between these two results is because of the catalytic co-pyrolysis of intact bagasse is performed at a more elevated temperature. From Fig. 7 (b), one can conclude that the highest bio-oil yield (39%) is achieved for co-pyrolysis of pretreated bagasse with use of 20% w heavy paraffin at 700 °C. On the other hand, catalytic co-pyrolysis of pretreated bagasse with use of 20% w heavy paraffin at 600 °C leads to a bio-oil yield of ca 35%. The difference between these two results is because of the fact that use of catalyst does not have any impact on the yield of bio-oil as we observed in pyrolysis of intact bagasse."
15,Bio-oil characterization,"3.8 Bio-oil characterization Results of measurement of major physical properties of all bio-oil samples prepared are listed in Table 7 . It is difficult to find meaningful correlations between the physical properties of bio-oil samples and experimental conditions. From this Table, it is understood that all bio-oil samples are acidic. Further, one can find that samples SB9 and SB5 possess the highest and lowest densities, respectively; samples SB1 and SB3 have highest and lowest viscosities, respectively; and samples SB16 and SB13 are the most acidic and less acidic bio-oil samples, respectively. From a chemical point of view, it is revealed that the liquid products of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of bagasse are complex mixtures of a large number of aromatic, aliphatic, and olefinic hydrocarbons along with various oxygenated and nitrogenated organic compounds. It is impossible to characterize such a mixture thoroughly and quantitatively. To have a semi-quantitative understanding of the compositional changes of the bio-oil under various operational conditions, bio-oil samples were subject to GC-MS spectroscopy. The results obtained from pyrolysis of intact bagasse, pretreated bagasse, bagasse and paraffin, bagasse and paraffin with zeolite catalyst are listed in Table 8 . The GC-MS spectra of examined samples are provided as a supplement. In Table 8, the components of the produced bio-oil detected by GC-MS apparatus are classified into pseudo-components such as esters, ethers, acids, ketones, furans, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols, hydrocarbons, and saccharides. The quantity of each pseudo-compound is determined semi-quantitatively by normalization and summation of the area integral of the related peaks. These results vividly demonstrate the diversity of the compositional distribution of the bio-oil produced under various pyrolysis operating conditions. Comparison of the amounts of each group of pyrolysis products in Table 8 reveals that pyrolysis of pretreated bagasse produces no saccharides. Since the major part of hemicellulose in bagasse is removed by acid pretreatment, one can conclude that hemicellulose is responsible for formation of saccharides. Further, this shows that with bagasse pretreatment and destruction of its structure with breaking of hydrogen and covalent bonds, the supplied energy by heating, instead of breaking the initial bonds of the structure, is consumed to convert the initial compounds to the secondary materials and as a result the yield of saccharides decreases. This result complies with previous reports that believe sugar structures in bio-oil are linked with holocellulose structures [62], among others]. In addition, increased amount of the produced hydrocarbons in pyrolysis of pretreated bagasse (from 0.31% to 1.3%) is because of the fact that the aromatic compounds are mostly produced by phenols de-oxygenation and condensation reactions or by Diels-Alder reactions of furan compounds with low molecular weight olefins. Also, it is established that olefins are produced by oligomerization reactions and by cracking of furans and other olefins. Hence, one can conclude that bagasse pretreatment is responsible for increased formation of furans and phenols which their conversion is more amenable to formation of hydrocarbons [63]. Also, removal of hemicellulose is responsible for reduced esters and ketones, and increased ethers, alcohols, and phenols. Yang and coworkers [64] showed that simultaneous presence of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in biomass has no interaction in pyrolysis of plant biomass; and, given the fact that semi-quantitative method used in preparation of Table 8 involves large values of computational errors, one can conclude that comparison of other products of pyrolysis of intact and pretreated bagasse does not practically show distinct and remarkable differences and it seems that the differences are about the expected errors (i.e., 15–20%). However, there exist major differences between the distribution of products of co-pyrolysis of bagasse and heavy paraffin and catalytic co-pyrolysis of the same with respect to pyrolysis of intact bagasse and pretreated bagasse. Addition of hydrogen-rich heavy paraffin to bagasse (bagasse to paraffin ratio was 85:15 w/w) leads to reduction of ethers, ketones, furans, and increased acids and aldehydes. This can be attributed to the presence of a higher amount of hydrogen radicals derived from paraffin pyrolysis in reaction. On the other hand, inclusion of zeolite catalyst considerably reduces formation of esters, ketones, and furans, and leads to increased acids, hydrocarbons, and saccharides."
16,Conclusions,"Co-pyrolysis and catalytic co-pyrolysis of natural and synthetic wastes are highly complicated. From a fundamental point of view, the detailed and mechanistic analysis of the results of these processes is far reached. In this contribution, an attempt was made to study the bulk effects of pretreatment, and utilization of waste heavy paraffin on co-pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis under the premise that heavy paraffin is a hydrogen-rich material, and its use in co-pyrolysis of intact and pretreated bagasse can act as an in situ supply of hydrogen that can enhance the yield of the produced bio-oil. The catalyst examined in this study was HGY-A, a Y-type zeolite catalyst which is a gasoline boosting catalyst, suitable for cracking hydro-treated residues or vacuum gas oil (VGO) feedstock in oil refining industries. The purpose of using this catalyst was to determine whether this catalyst can have any positive effect on the bulk yield of pyrolysis of bagasse. Results revealed that the hydrocracking catalyst does not have any positive impact on the bulk yield of the produced bio-oil under various operational conditions. However, it did significantly changed the compositional structure of the bio-oil, and specifically, it reduced the percentage of oxygenated compounds. The addition of heavy paraffin had a significant impact on the bulk yield of the produced bio-oil. Further, the major results of the present study are summarized as follows. • The best operating temperature for all pyrolysis experiment was 600 °C. • Pretreatment did significantly change the composition of ingredients of bagasse, but did not have any significant impact on the inorganic phase of bagasse. • The best amount of paraffin addition to achieve the highest yield of liquid products was 15 wt%, and the most favorable temperature was 600 °C. • Increased H/Ceff ratio of feed increases the bio-oil production."
