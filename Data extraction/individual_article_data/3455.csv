0,Introduction,"Anaerobic fermentation processes convert biomass to hydrogen [1–4]. Production of biohydrogen from waste materials is considered as an attractive future energy source [5–9]. Cellulose is a predominant constituent of agricultural waste and waste generated by the pulp and paper industry. Lay [10] investigated the potential of producing hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose using mesophilic digestion with heat-shocked sludge. Liu et al. [11] determined that their mixed culture comprising microbes closely affiliated with the genus Thermoanaerobacterium produced hydrogen that peaked at 7.56mgH2 g−1 cellulose from a 5gcellulosel−1 suspension maintained at pH 6.5 and 55°C. Wang et al. [12] reported enhanced biohydrogen production from microcrystalline cellulose using two cultures, in batch reactor. To generate hydrogen directly from lignocellulose materials using dark fermentation normally requires expensive pretreatment processes such as delignification and hydrolysis to dissolve organic matter from a lignocellulose complex [13–15]. For instance, steam explosion treatment forces high pressure steam to penetrate the lignocellulosic structures to hydrolyze the hemicellulose fractions and releases suddenly the pressure to breakdown lignocellulosic structures. Acid treatment uses hydrogen ions as catalyst to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds at the surfaces or in the amorphous regions of the cellulose. Pretreatment processes are in general expensive and time consuming. Mesophilic isolates (bacteria) that effectively hydrolyze the partially delignified lignocellulose complex are of significant practical interest to decrease biohydrogen production cost. This study isolated nine strains from a full-scale hydrogen fermenter. The strains that could effectively produce biohydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose suspensions were tested. The isolated strain, X9, was used to hydrolyze and produce hydrogen from pretreated corn stalks."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strain cultivation,"2.1 Strain cultivation Liquor samples were obtained from a pilot-scale hydrogen fermenter in Harbin, China, which is a continuous flow anaerobic fermentation reactor with working volume of 1.48m3 and fed with molasses as the substrate. The operation was performed under organic loading rates of 3.11–85.8kgCODm−3 d−1 for over 200 days. The liquid samples were placed in aseptically mixed sterilized tubes containing 50ml medium containing cellulosic materials. The compositions are (per liter): microcrystalline cellulose or CMC 10g, peptone 4.0g, beef extract 2.0g, yeast extract 1.0g, MgCl2 0.15g, FeSO4 0.15g, NaCl 1.0g, K2HPO4 1.5g, and l-cysteine 0.5g. Moreover, 10mll−1 medium of both vitamins (per liter: cyanocobalamin 0.01g, ascorbic acid 0.025g, riboflavin 0.025g, citric acid 0.02g, pyridoxin 0.05g, folic acid 0.01g, 4-aminobenzoic acid 0.01g, and creatine 0.025g) and micronutrients (MnSO4·7H2O 0.01g, ZnSO4·7H2O 0.05g, H3BO3 0.01g, N(CH2COOH)3 0.01g, CaCl2·2H2O 0.01g, Na2MoO4 0.01g, CoCl2·6H2O 0.2g, AlK(SO4)2 0.01g), and 1ml of resazurin (0.2%) were also added. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C, anaerobic condition for 18h. Suspension samples collected from the incubated tubes were plated on agar plates. Nine isolates from screened strains were tested for their potential to produce hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose or CMC."
3,Fermenting test – CMC,"2.2 Fermenting test – CMC Fermentation tests were performed using the same medium as that in cultivation stage (Section 2.1). Briefly, 50ml sterilized medium was mixed with 10ml inoculum (biomass of 0.375g dry cells) and was kept at 37°C, anaerobic condition for 18h. The strain that had highest hydrogen potential among those isolates from microcrystalline cellulose or CMC suspensions was further tested. Another strain isolated by authors in Ref. [15], B49, AF481148 in NCBI, was utilized to co-work with the isolated strain X9 in fermentation tests. In the co-culture tests, the two strains were mixed at the same volumes at fixed total biomass quantities (0.375g dry cells)."
4,Tests with corn stalks,"2.3 Tests with corn stalks The corn stalks used in this study was taken from the agricultural area in countryside close to Harbin city. Four pretreatment methods were adopted to pretreat the corn stalks, including the use of H2SO4 (0.2, 0.5, 1% w/v), NaOH (0.5, 1.0, 2.0% w/v), NH3·H2O (2.0, 5.0, 10% w/v), and steam explosion with H2SO4. In the former three chemical treatments, 15g dried corn stalks powder (30–60 meshes) was mixed at room temperature with the solutions at prescribed concentrations at solid: solution ratio of 1:10 (w/w) for 24h. In the steam explosion treatment, 15g dried corn stalks powder (30–60 meshes) was first mixed with 150ml, 1% w/v H2SO4 and was placed in an autoclave kept at 121°C, 15psi for 2h. The residue following steam explosion was filtered with water to separate it into lignocellulose solid (LS) and hydrolyzed solution (HS). The LS fraction was tested with X9. In fermentative tests, hydrogen production capabilities, liquid end products, cellulose degradation rate, quantities of reductive saccharides, and suspension pH were measured."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods A wet gas meter was utilized to measure biogas production volume at room temperature. A gas chromatography (GC112, Perkin–Elmer, USA) with nitrogen as the carrier gas was used to determine VFA and alcohols content in centrifugated (4000rpm) fermenting liquor. The hydrogen flame detector with hydrogen and air flow rates of 50 and 490mlmin−1, respectively, and a stainless steel column (2m) packed with GDX-103 (60–80 meshes) were employed at 190°C. Hydrogen content in the gas phase was determined by gas chromatography with nitrogen as the carrier gas (70mlmin−1) and a thermal conductivity detector. The column (2m) was packed with TDS-01 (60–80 meshes). The column and detector were kept at 150°C. Based on the measured hydrogen production quantity and cell amount, the maximum hydrogen production rate was calculated as Q H 2 =(maximum hydrogen production rate)×(hydrogen content in gas)/dry cell mass (mmolg−1 dry cells). The specific hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) was approximated as Y H 2 =(accumulated biogas production quantity)×(hydrogen content in gas)/(medium volume). The hydrolysis content in cellulosic materials was estimated using the carbon balance calculation as follows [12]: Hydrolysis ratio ( % ) = ( C ( CO 2 ) + C ( EtOH ) + C ( Ac ) + C ( Bu ) + C ( reduced sugar ) ) / C ( cellulose ) A scanning electron microscope (model S-4500, Hitachi Co., Japan) was utilized to assess the morphology of isolates. A control test conducted with all applied nutrients but no cellulosic materials, which revealed minor hydrogen production compared with the ones with added cellulose. Hence, the effects of added extracts and peptone on hydrogen production are not discussed herein."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Isolated strains and screening tests,"3.1 Isolated strains and screening tests All nine strains were noted capable of hydrolyzing microcrystalline cellulose and CMC to fatty acids. However, only three of them, X9, B2, and C3, had high hydrogen yields from both cellulosic materials (Table 1 ). The associated metabolites for strain X9 were primarily acetate and butyrate; whereas those for B2 and C3 were ethanol and acetate. That is, strain X9 had typical butyrate-type fermentation metabolism [17], whereas B2 and C3 underwent so-called ethanol-type fermentation metabolism. The strain X9 has 96% sequence similarity with Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 [12]. At 37°C and pH 5.0, the co-cultures of any two of the three strains, X9, B2 and C3, exhibited 3–4 times hydrogen yields compared with the mono-culture tests. Particularly, the co-cultures of X9 and strain Ethanoigenens harbinense B49, which are a gram-positive, strict anaerobe that cannot utilize cellulosic materials [16], produced the highest hydrogen yield from both cellulosic materials amongst all strain pairs. Meanwhile, the strain X9 yielded the highest quantities of volatile fatty acids from the two cellulosic materials. To determine the maximum hydrogen yield the present isolates could derive from CMC, strain X9 is discussed further in subsequent sections (Fig. 1 )."
8,Mono-culture X9 and co-cultured X9 +B49 tests using CMC,"3.2 Mono-culture X9 and co-cultured X9 +B49 tests using CMC Fig. 2 presents the hydrogen yield and cellulose hydrolysis ratio for strain X9 to degrade CMC at 37°C and pH 5.0. With no lag time, biogas was yielded (Fig. 2a) together with the noted cellulose hydrolysis (Fig. 2b). However, hydrogen was present only on 3h and above. Hydrogen production and cellulose hydrolysis were completed in 5h. About 52% of CMC was hydrolyzed by X9. The strain X9 has effectively hydrolyzed CMC and then converted it to hydrogen. The co-culture X9 +B49 completed fermentation process in 5h, generating a high cellulose hydrolysis ratio of 70%. The hydrogen yield by strains X9 +B49 was roughly 2.7 times that by the mono-culture test with only X9 (Fig. 2a). In a mono-cultured test with X9, the suspension pH dropped from 6.7 during the initial 3h to approximately 4.2, as shown in Fig. 3 . In this initial stage, only 10% of CMC was hydrolyzed. The subsequent cellulose hydrolysis and hydrogen formation did not change further the suspension pH. The end liquid products of mono-culture test were primarily acetate and butyrate (Fig. 4a), whose molar ratio (acetate/butyrate) was near 1.5. In the co-culture test with X9 +B49, the pH dropped to near 4.1 in merely 1h of test (Fig. 3). The end liquid products were acetate, ethanol, and butyrate (Fig. 4b), with a molar ratio (acetate/ethanol/butyrate) of nearly 2:1:1. That strain B49 degrades glucose via an ethanol-type fermentation pathway [17]. The co-culture could rapidly hydrolyze cellulose and produce hydrogen, indicating the presence of certain bioaugmentation between these two strains on cellulose hydrolysis/hydrogen production. One possible scenario is the enhanced role of X9 as cellulose hydrolyzer and that of B49 as hydrogen producer. The higher hydrogen yield by X9 +B49 compared with B2 +B49 or C3 +B49 (Table 1) indicated that the ethanol-type fermentation metabolism does not comply with the role of cellulose hydrolyzer."
9,Hydrolysis of partially delignified corn stalks and yield of hydrogen by X9,"3.3 Hydrolysis of partially delignified corn stalks and yield of hydrogen by X9 The four pretreatments, H2SO4, NaOH and NH3 soaking, and steam explosion, hydrolyzed corn stalks at a fraction of (in w/w) 15–16%, 7–13%, 13–17%, and approximately 10%, respectively (Fig. 5 ). The strain X9 further hydrolyzed the pretreated corn stalks in 10–12h to (w/w) 39–46%, 37–45%, 33–43%, and approximately 47%, respectively. Restated, the strain X9 significantly hydrolyzed the pretreated corn stalks, a consequence attributable to the decrease in cellulose crystallinity and removal of lignin following pretreatments [18,19]. Consistent with the trend of cellulose hydrolysis, the hydrogen yield from pretreated corn stalks followed stream explosion (188mlH2 l−1 medium)>0.5% sulfuric acid (150mlH2 l−1 medium)>1.0% sodium hydroxide (80.7mlH2 l−1 medium)>2.0% ammonia liquor (76.2mlH2 l−1 medium). Additionally, the lag time for hydrogen yield from stream exploded (2h) stalks is much less than that of sulfuric acid pretreated (>24h). The steam explosion presents the most effective method amongst the four tested pretreatments for hydrolyzing cellulose and yielding hydrogen. Based on the data of accumulated hydrogen yield, the specific hydrogen production rate ( Y H 2 / s ) of strain X9 is 3.4mmolg−1 steam exploded corn stalks."
10,Conclusions,"This study produced directly biohydrogen from cellulosic materials using dark fermentation with selected isolates. Three isolates, B2, C3 and X9, could yield hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose or from CMC. The strain X9, identified as C. acetobutylicum, underwent typical butyrate-type fermentation metabolism, whereas B2 and C3 had so-called ethanol-type fermentation metabolism. At 37°C and pH 5.0, the mono-culture tests with X9 revealed much higher hydrogen yield than did other strains. Meanwhile, the co-cultures of any two of the three strains exhibited 3–4 times hydrogen yields compared with the mono-culture tests. Particularly, the co-cultures of X9 and strain E. harbinense B49 yielded the highest hydrogen yield. The corresponding end liquid products were acetate, ethanol, and butyrate. Co-culturing these strains revealed bioaugmentation effects for promoting biohydrogen production from cellulosic materials. The corn stalks pretreated with four processes: H2SO4, NaOH and NH3 soaking, and steam explosion were further hydrolyzed using the strain X9. Over 10–12h the hydrolysis ratio reached (in w/w) 39–46%, 37–45%, 33–43%, and approximately 47%, respectively, for the four pretreated corn stalks. The yielded hydrogen followed the same order. The steam explosion+hydrolysis/fermentation with X9 present the most effective method amongst the four tested pretreatments for hydrolyzing cellulose and yielding hydrogen."
