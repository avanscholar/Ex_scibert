0,Introduction,"Some alcohols and ketones such as methyl alcohol (MeOH) - methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) - tert butyl alcohol (TBA) are widely used as good organic solvents. A great deal of waste mixed solvents can be discharged in the same chemical, pharmaceutical or coating plants. MeOH is an important chemical feedstock for several valuable chemicals and also is used as a fuel additive or clean fuel. MEK is an important fine chemical raw material. It is often used as an intermediate in the production of antioxidant, perfume and catalyst. TBA is often consumed as gasoline additive, etherifying agent, hydrogen hydrocarbon stabilizer in many fields. Therefore, it is of importance for the acquisition of large economic and environmental benefits to efficiently separate the MeOH-MEK-TBA ternary mixture into high-purity products. Because of the presentence of multiple binary azeotropes, thus some special distillation methods have to be considered, for example, pressure swing distillation (PSD) [1–6] azeotropic distillation (AD) [7–10] and extractive distillation (ED) [11–16]. Among ED is one of the most common methods for separating close-boiling and azeotropic mixtures, but consumes high amount of energy due to the nature of low thermodynamic efficiency and the requirement of recycling large quantities of solvents. Thus, researchers have been trying to develop new energy-saving configurations by using process intensification and integration technologies and seeking alternative green and effective solvents. At present, some thermal efficiency improvement methods have been developed, for instance, all kinds of heat pump-assisted distillation [17,18] thermally coupled double-column like divided-wall column (DWC) [19–22] side-stream extractive distillation (SSED) [23,24] and also heat integration distillation [25–27]. Some of these methods such as DWC are regarded as successful and have been built in industrial scale [28] which is still being studied extensively. For example, Kiss et al. [29] extended the application of DWC to ED and AD, took ethanol dehydration as an example. The results showed that energy savings of 10–20% are possible for the novel process intensification alternatives based on DWC, while using less equipment units as compared to the respective conventional configurations. Zhai et al. [30] designed two DWC distillation configurations for cumene production and accomplished the optimization with total annual cost (TAC) as a target. It was indicated that appropriately utilizing DWC can reduce significant energy requirement and TAC. Patraşcu et al. [31] proposed a new process to recover butanol from acetone-butanol-ethanol, in which the technologies of DWC heat integration were employed. It was found that the new process resulted in fundament reduction in the cost and improved the economy of biological butanol production. Zhao et al. [32] proposed the process of separating ternary azeotropic mixtures of tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water by extractive dividing wall distillation (EDWC) using dimethyl sulfoxide and ethylene glycol as mixed extractant, leading to apparent benefits on economics and environment aspects. Li et al. [33] established an efficient and energy-saving extractive-azeotropic divided-wall column distillation configuration (EADWC) for the separation of industrial wastewater rich in iso-butanol and ethanol. It was claimed that EADWC can be reduced energy consumption by 15.82% and TAC by 23.21% in compared with traditional ED. In our recent work [34,35] different EDWC schemes were studied to separate a quaternary organic mixture of acetone-MeOH-MEK-TBA with monochlorobenzene (MCB) as extractant and displayed great economic and environmental benefits. On the other hand, many studies [36,37] have shown that using ionic liquids (ILs) as extractant can effectively achieve the azeotrope separation with low energy consumption and ILs have some obvious merits such as nonflammability [38] comparatively high thermal stability [39] and low melting point [40]. Therefore, the application of IL as extractant has become a research focus in recent years. For instance, Dong et al. [41] proposed to use the mixed extractant of dimethylformamide (DMF) + IL instead of conventional DMF for the separation of methylal and MeOH by ED, and claimed [EMIM]+[Ac]− might be the most promising extractant screened by COSMO-RS model considering relative volatility and solvent capacity together. It was found that the overall heat duty of reboilers decreased 9.25% using the proposed mixed extractants as compared to pure DMF. Ma et al. [42] explored the ternary ED intensification process using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([bmim][OAc]) as extractant for the separation of ethyl ether-ethanol–water. This process performed great benefits in energy-saving and environment protection aspects. Hu et al. [43] carried out process design and optimization for the separation of MeOH-acetone azeotrope by ED with two ILs and dimethyl sulfoxide as optional extractant. The results demonstrated that 1-Methylimidazolium acetate ([MIM][OAc]) was the best extractant and can lead to the TAC-reduction of 31.39% as compared to dimethyl sulfoxide. Ayuso et al. [44] studied the effect of different ILs on the ED of cyclohexane-benzene, and claimed 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium tricyanomethanide ([4bmpy][TCM]) was the most promising extractant among the seven studied ILs. The results showed that compared with the traditional process using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as extractant, ED using [4bmpy][TCM] has obvious energy saving effect. Li et al. [45] studied the extractive separation ability of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([BMIM][NTF2]) and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([HMIM][NTF2]) for MeOH-MEK system. It was proved that both ILs can break the azeotrope and be used as extractants for the ED process of this mixture. Xu et al. [46] studied the extraction mechanism using [BMIM][NTF2] to separate cyclohexane and TBA mixture by means of experiments and simulation. So far, there are few reports on the separation of MeOH-MEK-TBA ternary system, and even the MEK-TBA binary system. In our recent works [34,35] MCB was used as extractant for the quaternary separation of acetone-MeOH-MEK-TBA by ED. It is noticed that the usage amount of MCB as regular extractant is very large, leading to an increased energy consumption and equipment investment and a certain environmental impact as well. Therefore, in order to improve the energy and environmental benefits as much as possible, we propose to use a green and high efficient IL ([BMIM][NTF2]) instead of MCB and DWC to separate this ternary mixture. At the same time, a series of new thermodynamically feasible configurations are designed and compared to get the most economical and effective one. A simulated annealing (SA) based systematic optimization methodology is proposed to carry out parametric optimization for the proposed configurations."
1,Process design and optimization,
2,Property analysis through thermodynamic modelling,"2.1 Property analysis through thermodynamic modelling 2.1.1 Thermo-physical properties of [BMIM][NTF2] and MCB In the simulated ED system below, MeOH, MEK, TBA and MCB are all conventional components in Aspen Plus database except [BMIM][NTF2]. Therefore, it is necessary to customize this new IL through basic physical properties data from Gardas’s work [47] such as molecular structure and formula, molecular weight and standard boiling point of [BMIM][NTF2], as well as some temperature-related parameters, such as liquid vapor pressure constants and ideal gas heat capacity constants. Table 1 shows some important property data of [BMIM][NTF2] and MCB. 2.1.2 Extractive performances of [BMIM][NTF2] and MCB In this paper, NRTL model is chosen as a reliable property method to describe the system’s vapor–liquid equilibria and correlate other thermodynamic properties due to the calculated values are in good agreement with the experimental values, as shown in Figs. 1-2 . The binary interaction parameters between conventional components are shown in Table S1, which are sourced from APV100 VLE-IG. The binary interaction parameters between [BMIM][NTF2] and conventional components are shown in Table 2 , which are regressed values of VLE experimental data by Xu et al. [45] and Li et al. [46]. In their research works, the validity of these model parameters has been verified in details through the good correlation of calculated values with experimental data. In order to compare two solvents of [BMIM][NTF2] and MCB from the perspective of thermodynamics, VLE diagrams with different molar ratios of solvent-to-feed are plotted for two azeotropic systems. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that both solvents can break the MeOH-MEK azeotrope and significantly increase their relative volatility, but [BMIM][NTF2] is slightly more efficient than MCB. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 2 that both solvents also work for the MEK-TBA azeotrope, but [BMIM][NTF2] is much better than MCB."
3,Conceptual design schemes,"2.2 Conceptual design schemes 2.2.1 Thermodynamic feasibility analysis In order to gain insight into the thermodynamic feasibility of all separation processes below, overall ternary diagrams at atmospheric pressure are given as Fig. 3 . Such an overall phase diagram consists of four ternary diagrams with the residue curves and distillation boundary, i.e., MeOH-MEK-TBA, MeOH-MEK-extractant, MEK-TBA-extractant, MeOH-TBA-extractant. The extractant is MCB in Fig. 3a and [BMIM][NTF2] in Fig. 3b. It can be seen from the middle ternary diagram that the system to be separated has two minimum binary azeotropes (i.e., MeOH-MEK and TBA-MEK) connected by a curved distillation boundary. Due to this restriction, only pure TBA is partially obtained when this ternary mixture is simply distilled from the feed point within region I-1. The composition of kettle residual liquid is represented as the point D in Fig. 3b. In addition, no distillation boundary is observed in the other three ternary diagrams. Any residue curves always start from the unstable node and end at the stable node along the temperature rising direction. For example, the residue curves in region III and IV are directed from minimum azeotrope to heavy extractant, while those in region II is are directed from light MeOH to heavy extractant since MeOH and TBA is zeotropic mixture. Combined with Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we infer with respect to the continuous ED process that MeOH is separated from the top of the first column, then TBA are distilled from the top of the second column and finally MEK is obtained along with the recovery of extractant. Moreover, the interesting thing is that TBA is also separated via azeotropic distillation with MeOH as an entrainer, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. When a certain amount of MeOH is added to the feed, F will move toward the vertex to F’. In this case, a feasible split from the new feed point is to obtain pure TBA at the bottom of the column and the almost binary mixture of MeOH and MEK at the top of the column (represented as with D’). As the increasing content of MeOH in the feed, F is able to reach F’’, while the corresponding distillate changes to be the azeotrope of MeOH and MEK (represented as with D’’) without TBA. Therefore, the obtained distillate composition is within the range of D’ and D”. But to reduce energy consumption resulting from the recycling of a great deal of MeOH, F’ should be the most suitable mixed feed point, which is confirmed by the following optimization results. 2.2.2 Process conceptual design Fig. 4 displays six separation schemes heuristically designed following thermodynamic analysis and process simulation. Fig. 4a is a flowsheet of CED with MCB as extractant, comprising two extractive distillation columns (C-1, C-2) and an extractant recovery column (C-3). The top products of these columns are MeOH, TBA and MEK respectively. The extractant from the bottom of C-3 after cooling goes back to C-1 and C-2. Fig. 4b is an intensified flowsheet of the above CED, known as CEDWC. The two extractive distillation columns in the CED are combined into a column shell with a middle partition wall. In the simulation, thermodynamic equivalent two-column model is used, that is, main column (MC) and sub column (SC). The two columns share a common reboiler and achieve thermal coupling through the connection of vapor and liquid streams. Thus, it can effectively reduce energy consumption and investment cost as compared with the use of two extractive distillation columns, leading to a great decrease in TAC of the overall process. The top products of MC and SC are MeOH and TBA. The bottom effluent of MC is a binary mixture of MEK and MCB (see Fig. 4b). Fig. 4c is a direct-ED process using [BMIM][NTF2] as extractant, including two extractive distillation columns (C-1, C-2) and IL recovery unit (Flash and Stripper). An isobaric flash tank is capable of separating MEK and [BMIM][NTF2] with little problem. The flash pressure is set as 10 kPa through multiple tests and adjustments to assure less heat duty and below decomposition temperature of [BMIM][NTF2] (423 °C). The flash temperature needs to be optimized under the condition of limiting product purity. An inert nitrogen (N2) stripper is exploited to further remove a small amount of MEK in the recycling IL. The suitable input temperature of N2 is set at room temperature (25 °C) through preliminary simulation trials. Such IL recovery unit is more economical and safety than the secondary flash tank, and also applied to the following flowsheets. Fig. 4d is a flowsheet of azeotropic extractive distillation (AED) using MeOH and [BMIM][NTF2] as solvent, mainly including an azeotropic distillation column (C-1), an extractive distillation column (C-2) and IL recovery unit. In C-1, MeOH as azeotropic entrainer brings all the MEK to the top, and TBA as the bottom product is obtained. In C-2, MeOH-MEK is further separated with [BMIM][NTF2] as extractant. Fig. 4e is an indirect-ED process using [BMIM][NTF2] as extractant, including an extractive distillation column (C-1), an ordinary distillation column (C-2) and IL recovery unit. The difference from direct-ED is that MeOH-TBA are obtained at the top of C-1 and MEK-[BMIM][NTF2] is received at the bottom of C-1. Because of no azeotrope forming, TBA and MeOH can be separated directly in C-2. Fig. 4f is an intensified flowsheet of the above direct-ED, known as EDWC. In the flowsheet simulation and optimization below, a fresh feed is assumed as the flowrate of 100 kmol/h and the mole composition of 40% MeOH, 30% MEK and 30% TBA. The target products are chemical pure (≥99.5 mol%). The purity of the recovered extractant was set at 99.95%. In order to avoid the influence of season and other factors on feed temperature, resulting in the variations of target parameters, the feed thermal state is saturated liquid. In addition, the top pressure of each column is 1 atm, and the pressure drop of the tray is 0.0068 atm [48]. In the real industrial column, either plate with high efficiency and low pressure drop or structured packaging can be installed as internals."
4,Economic optimization methodology,"2.3 Economic optimization methodology In implementing economic optimization for the above schemes, the objective function is to minimize TAC, and other performance indexes such as TCC, TOC and CO2 emissions are also evaluated. The calculation procedure of TAC and CO2 emissions are shown in S1 and S2 in supplementary material. All optimization works assume that a stable process simulation has been established. The decision variables of the configurations to be optimized are classified into dependent variable and independent variable, as shown Table 3 . The former is continuously optimized through design specification in Aspen simulator to meet the required product purities, including distillate flowrate (D), reflux ratio (RR), flash tank temperature (TFlash), flowrate of N2 (FN₂), side vapor flowrate (Vside). The latter is a few continuous variables and all discrete variable and optimized via SAA, including the number of rectifying stages (NR), extractive stages (NE) and stripping stages (NS) of ED, the number of azeotropic stages (NA) of AD, the number of stripper stages (NTS), the side vapor position in DWC (Nside) and recycling extractant flowrate (SF). In order to find a better global optimal solution, reduce and avoid falling into local optimum, a simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) based optimization methodology is programed, as shown in Fig. 5 . Firstly, a base case should be simulated by Aspen Plus to find the suitable initial values and variation range of independent variables under purity constraints. Next, TAC is calculated and compared by running the programmed SAA in MATLAB, and give the independent variables set for the next step. Finally, all process variables are transferred between Aspen Plus and MATLAB through an ActiveX interface. As for the parameters of SAA, the interpretation of SAA parameters as shown in S3 in supplementary material. the initial and final temperatures (T0, Tf) are set as 100 and 0.001 respectively. The temperature decay coefficient (α) is 0.9. Bozeman's constant (k) depends on the magnitude of objective function. The length of Markov chain is generally greater than the amount of optimization variables and less than twice this number. In the optimization progress, all convergent solutions are judged and probabilistically accepted according to the Metropolis criterion. Nevertheless, all non-convergent solutions are directly rejected and meanwhile new generated variables by SAA are reassigned to the Aspen plus simulation."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Stochastic optimization results,"3.1 Stochastic optimization results In order to obtain a stable global optimal solution, three rounds of optimization are accomplished for each process. The convergence process of the third round optimization to the minimum TAC is shown in Fig. 6 . The optimization process of the former two rounds is given in supplementary material Figs.S1-S6. The whole annealing process illustrates that as decreasing annealing temperature the objective function can effectively jump out of the local optimum and get to the lowest point shortly. The third round optimization results of process variables are shown in Table 4 . The first and second round optimization results are in supplementary material Tables S1-S6. In the supplementary material, Figs.S7-S12 give more detailed optimization results of each process, such as complete mass and energy balance, and all parameters used in the simulation. As compared to other SA studies, optimization variables are divided into two types of dependent and independent. This optimization strategy takes full advantage of Aspen’s powerful simulation capability and Matlab’s algorithm development role. However, the application of this methodology for other highly nonlinear processes such as reactive distillation with multiple reaction stages, multiple-dividing-wall column and heat pump distillation has yet to be tested."
7,Performance assessment,"3.2 Performance assessment To facilitate the comparison of these processes from economic to energy and environmental aspects, several performance indices under their respective optimal conditions are calculated including as TAC, TCC, TOC and CO2 emissions, as shown in Fig. 7 . Here, CED is used as a benchmark process due to the use of traditional flowsheet and regular extractant. Obviously, AED is a particular hybrid process but has the worst performances in all TAC, TCC, TOC and CO2 emissions aspects. Regarding other processes, CEDWC, indirect-ED, direct-ED and EDWC have respectively reduced 2.17%, 14.76%, 18.04% and 22.19% in terms of TAC, as shown in Fig. 7a. It is also demonstrated that the use of IL plays a more important role than the DWC intensification technology for the best EDWC process. Fig. 7b shows the comparison in the TCC for these processes. It can be seen that CEDWC, direct-ED, indirect-ED and EDWC are respectively reduced 2.95%, 25.87%, 30.53% and 31.47% than CED. Besides, the three processes using [BMIM][NTF2] (direct-ED, indirect-ED and EDWC) have much less TCC than the two processes using MCB (CED and CEDWC) because the recovery of IL is very easier and lower-cost than regular extractant. Fig. 7c compares the energy consumption of these processes. It can be seen that TOC of CEDWC, direct-ED and EDWC can respectively reduce TOC by 1.00%, 5.61%, 8.35% as compared to CED. This also explains that [BMIM][NTF2] as extractant has a greater the separation capacity than MCB. However, indirect-ED has a greater TOC than CED because C-1 requires more extractant to remove all TBA at the bottom and on the other hand the relative volatility between MeOH and TBA is not very high in C-2. Fig. 7d shows a comparison of CO2 emissions directly related to the amount of TOC. It can be seen that CEDWC, direct-ED and EDWC can respectively decrease CO2 emissions by 3.20%, 6.25%, 7.7% than CED. In a word, EDWC has the best economic, energy and environmental performances."
8,Liquid composition profiles,"3.3 Liquid composition profiles Fig. 8 shows liquid composition profiles of each one of the above optimal processes.Fig.8a-b and Fig.8e-f are liquid composition profiles of CED and direct-ED respectively. It can be seen that both processes have the same liquid composition distribution trend. From Fig.8a, the composition of TBA goes through a maximum in the middle of stripping and then decreases toward the column bottom, indicating that remixing phenomenon in C-1 exhibits here. There is a sharp split between two components of MeOH and MCB from the 18th stage. In this section, high purity MeOH is obtained at the top of the column and small amounts of volatilized extractant MCB is back into the column. There is a marked change in the composition of each component near the 30th stage due to introducing a fresh feed. From Fig. 8 b, the TBA composition rapidly rises from the 22nd stage and then TBA gradually separates from other heavy components, thereby achieves the specified product at the top of the column. As for the two processes of CEDWC and EDWC, it can be seen from Fig.8c and Fig.8 k that there are roughly the same liquid composition distribution trend in the MC of the two processes. Similarly, the liquid composition distribution trend of SC is also roughly the same, as shown in Fig.8d and Fig.8 l. From Fig.8c and Fig.8 k, the MeOH composition increases rapidly from the right stage and above, and achieves the purity requirement at the top. The remixing effect of TBA also exists in MC. Therefore, a side vapor is withdrawn from the right stage with a high concentration of MCB and TBA and enters the bottom of the SC to avoid the mixing effect of TBA. From Fig.8d and Fig.8 l, the qualified TBA product is obtained at the top of the SC. For AED process, it can be seen from Fig.8 g, because MeOH as azeotropic entrainer brings all the MEK, MeOH and MEK are extracted from the top of the column and the qualified TBA product is obtained at the top of the C-1. From Fig.8 h, the MeOH composition is rapidly raised from the 8th stage and above, thereby obtaining the specified MeOH product at the top in C-2. For indirect-ED process, it can be seen from Fig.8i, the MeOH and TBA compositions increases rapidly from the 3rd stage and above, MeOH and TBA are extracted from the top of the column. Because of no azeotrope forming, it can be seen from Fig.8j, TBA and MeOH can be separated directly in column, MeOH is extracted from the top of the column and reaches the required purity."
9,Conclusions,"This study proposed different ED configurations for the separation of the MeOH-MEK-TBA multiazeortopic system and compared their performances. The EDWC configuration with [BMIM][NTF2] as extractant was the most economical and effective one among these schemes. This configuration performs much greater advantages in decreasing equipment cost, energy consumption and environment impact over other feasible schemes using ordinary column or regular solvent. For example, this process can reduce 22.19% TAC, 31.47% TCC, 8.35% TOC and 7.70% CO2 emissions as compared to the most traditional process CED. In addition, to guarantee that each scheme being compared is under optimal conditions, a SA-based optimization methodology is adopted with the minimum TAC as an objective function. It is demonstrated that this method is very simple, high-efficient and expresses a strong adaptability to the complex extractive distillation system. It is believed that this current work is of a certain guiding significance for the development of a green and sustainable chemical industry."
