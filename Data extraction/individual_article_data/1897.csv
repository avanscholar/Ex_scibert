0,Introduction,"The world's energy demand is currently being met to a large extent by non-renewable resources, particularly fossil fuels. As these reserves are depleted, alternative, renewable sources of energy are being researched to meet the demand in a sustainable manner. One alternative to fossil fuel consumption is hydrogen. Upon combustion hydrogen generates 122kJg−1 of energy, the highest energy yield per unit mass of any known substance [1]. In comparison, the energy value of gasoline is 42.6kJg−1. Unlike the combustion of fossil fuels, no greenhouse gas emissions are generated by hydrogen combustion, only water. Hydrogen is produced by the activity of the hydrogenase enzyme during the degradation of fermentation intermediates, such as volatile fatty acids (VFA) and solvents, to acetate. Hydrogenase activity enables the re-oxidation of electron carriers such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and ferredoxin, which is required for glycolysis to continue [2]. The formation of acetate from VFA and solvents is thermodynamically unfavourable, and hydrogen removal via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is necessary to ensure that the biochemical pathways involved in fermentative degradation can proceed continuously [2]. However, when hydrogen itself is the desired product of the fermentation process, methanogenic activity is detrimental and must be eliminated to maximize yields [3]. This can be accomplished by, e.g.: heat treating the inoculum to remove heat-sensitive methanogens, maintaining a pH<6.0, sparging the system with acetylene, or adding chemical methanogen inhibitors such as Sodium 2-Bromoethanesulfonat [4,5]. A variety of factors are important in the fermentative production of hydrogen from organic substrates. These factors include the substrate concentration and characteristics, the type of inoculant used, fermentation pH and temperature, the partial pressure of hydrogen (pH2) in the fermentation vessel, etc. [4,7–9]. Fermentation pH is extremely important because of the pH-sensitive nature of the hydrogenase enzyme, as well as the tendency for microbial metabolism to shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis (the production of alcohols instead of VFA) at pH values below 4.5 [10,11]. The composition of microbial communities changes with pH as well, and methanogenic activity is reduced or absent at pH<6.0 [12,13]. Temperature affects not only the rate of biochemical processes, but also the composition of the microbial community [14–16]. Although the rate of biodegradation is higher at thermophilic temperatures, the microbial community is more genetically diverse at mesophilic temperatures [14]. While the optimal conditions reported for each of these parameters varies in the literature depending on the substrate and inoculum used, a pH value of 5.5 and temperatures from 35 to 40°C are common. Some thermophilic experiments have also been reported [17–19]. In order for fermentative hydrogen production to be practical at a commercial scale, non-sterile substrate and readily available microbial inoculant must be available [20]. Animal manures, such as feedlot cattle manure, can serve as both substrate (or co-substrate) and inoculant for the fermentative process [19]. There is a high concentration of beef feedlot operations in the region of southern Alberta, Canada, resulting in large amounts of manure that are typically applied to nearby cropland. This practice can have negative effects such as greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions to the atmosphere and nutrient runoff into water sources [21,22]. Less than 1% of manure produced in Canada is currently anaerobically digested [23]. Applying anaerobic digestion to the handling of beef feedlot manure would result in reduced environmental impact while simultaneously producing hydrogen energy. Stabilized biosolids can be produced after anaerobic hydrogen production through further subsequent anaerobic digestion or aerobic treatment (composting) which can be used as soil amendment for agricultural production [24]. The objective of this study is to investigate anaerobic fermentative hydrogen production of beef feedlot cattle manure over a temperature gradient spanning from 36 to 60°C. The beef manure itself was used as both inoculum and substrate for the study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental design and procedures,"2.1 Experimental design and procedures Fermentation temperatures of 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, and 60°C were tested in triplicate (21 total trials) using 4 bench-top fermenters. As fresh manure was used for each batch of 4 trials that was conducted, the 36, 40, 44, and 48°C treatments were conducted together (trials carried out 4 at a time and repeated in triplicate) while the 52, 56, and 60°C were conducted together (carried out 3 at a time and repeated in triplicate). This created some variation in the starting substrate characteristics between the 2 groups of experiments. Results reported for each temperature treatment are based on the average of values obtained in triplicate, unless otherwise stated. Cattle manure was obtained from a commercial beef feedlot located northwest of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Manure was collected from cement feeding pads to exclude bedding material. After collection, manure was mixed manually and stored in a 4°C cooler until use (<72h). A 1kg aliquot of the mixed manure was immediately tested for moisture content according to standard methods [25]. To kill hydrogenotrophs and retain spore-forming hydrogen producers [4,5], the manure was spread to a thickness of 1cm in aluminium baking trays and then placed in an oven set to 90°C for 3h. The heat-shock treated manure was then mixed with distilled water in a standard kitchen blender to obtain a slurry mixture with 8% solids and subsequently immediately used in the experiment. An 1800 mL slurry mixture was placed into a 2L Minifors fermenter (Infors AG, Switzerland); a total of 4 fermenters were used simultaneously in this study for batch fermentations. Each fermenter was continuously mixed at 600rpm. Temperature was automatically controlled by an electric heating plate, pH monitored in situ and data were recorded using Windows IRIS NT software (Infors AG, Switzerland). The pH of the slurry was allowed to fall from initial values (ranging from 7.0 to 8.0) to 5.2 via acidogenesis, after which point a pH of 5.2±0.1 was automatically maintained by the addition of 5M NaOH and/or 2M HCl. Preliminary study indicated that a pH of 5.2 gives the highest H2 yield using this feedlot cattle manure inoculum (data not shown). The volume of gas produced during fermentation was measured using a digital mass flow meter (Model #DFMS-010056, Aalborg, USA) and the fermentation experiment was terminated when the amount of gas produced in a day approached zero. Experiments lasted from 120 to 360h depending on the fermentation temperature used. A 30mL slurry sample was withdrawn from a liquid sampling port once per day. In order to prevent blockage of the liquid sampling port, a 0.5mm filter was placed at the intake end. The 30mL slurry sample was divided into 2mL aliquots and then immediately frozen at −20°C and stored for further analysis. Two 10mL gas samples were taken from a gas sampling port using a syringe and were injected into evacuated 6.8mL Exetainer® vials (Labco Limited, UK) until analysis (up to 1 week). After gas or liquid samples were taken, an equal volume of helium was injected into the headspace of the fermenter to replace the lost volume and return the headspace to a positive pressure. Gas and slurry samples for time zero were taken after the target temperature was reached in the fermentation vessel."
3,Analyses,"2.2 Analyses Total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) were determined using 4mL of slurry aliquots dried in ovens at 105 and 550°C, respectively, according to standard methods [35]. Total carbon and nitrogen were determined from liquid samples dried at 60°C and then finely ground (<0.150mm) for analysis using dry combustion-gas chromatography (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). Slurry samples were analyzed for VFA, alcohols, and ammonium (NH4 +) content. For VFA and alcohol analysis, slurry samples (2mL) were centrifuged for 10min at 13,000rpm. After centrifuging, 1.5mL of supernatant was removed and combined with 200L of 25% m-HPO3 to acidify the solution. This mixture was allowed to stand 10min before centrifuging again for 5min at 13,000rpm. One milliliter of the supernatant was taken and mixed with 200μL of crotonic acid which was used as an internal standard. Concentrations of VFA and alcohols were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC, Varian 3800, USA; flame ionization detector 250°C; fused-silica capillary column 25m×0.32mm WCOT FFAP-CB; oven temperature program: 40°C 1min, ramp 10°Cmin−1, 200°C 4.5min; injector 200°C; carrier gas Helium 25mLmin−1). Acetate, formate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, and caproate were the VFA analyzed. Alcohols measured included ethanol, propanol, and butanol. For NH4 +–N determination, a 2mL slurry sample was centrifuged for 10min at 13,000G and the supernatant was collected and diluted 50 times in ultra pure water. The concentration was determined colorimetrically after the addition of a solution containing sodium salicylate and sodium nitroprusside using an Auto Analyzer 3 (Bran+Luebbe, Germany) at 650nm. Gas samples were analyzed for H2, CO2, CH4, and H2S. For H2, CO2, and CH4 analysis, a 2 channel GC (Varian 4900 micro GC, USA; thermal conductivity detector (TCD); stainless steel column packed with Porapak N (80–100 mesh) 2m×2mm (inside diameter)). Injector and column temperatures were kept at 110 and 40°C, respectively, for H2 analysis on Channel A (argon carrier gas, 150kPa static), and at 110 and 60°C, respectively, for CH4 and CO2 analysis on Channel B (helium carrier gas, 150kPa static). A GC was also used for H2S analysis (Varian CP3800, USA; pulsed flame photometric detector 260°C; Supel-Q Plot column oven program: 50°C 1min, ramp 10°C min−1, 250°C 10min; injector 230°C; helium carrier gas 3mLmin−1.)"
4,Results and discussion,"The heat-shock treatment to remove methanogens altered the characteristics of the manure to be fermented. Typically the moisture content, VS, NH4 +–N, and total VFA were reduced by 5%, 1%, 44%, and 42%, respectively (data not shown). The initial slurry samples (particle size<0.5mm) for the 36, 40, 44, and 48°C treatments had similar TS, VS, and C/N ratios because they were conducted using the same manure samples. Similarly, the 52, 56, and 60°C treatments had similar initial characteristics to each other (Table 1 ). The 52, 56, and 60°C treatments had lower initial TS and VS values than the 36, 40, 44, and 48°C treatments, although the VS/TS ratio was similar. Variation in the initial manure characteristics between the 2 groups of experiments was likely due to sampling (e.g.: manure age, incorporation of bedding material into sample) and differences in cattle diets, as animals were fed differently before arriving at the feedlot and may have been on the transition or finishing diets for variable lengths of time, resulting in differences in the composition of their manure. The greatest reduction in both TS and VS occurred at 48°C (47% reduction in TS; 39% reduction in VS), 52°C (28% reduction in TS; 28% reduction in VS), and 60°C (19% reduction in TS; 26% reduction in VS) suggesting that substrate degradation was greatest at these temperatures. At 36°C TS actually increased over the course of the experiment, which may be explained by disintegration and hydrolysis of TS to a size <0.5mm at a rate faster than they could subsequently be degraded [26]. Total VFA concentration increased over time in every treatment, with the largest increase at 36°C (261% increase) and lowest at 56°C (77% increase) (Fig. 1a). This increase in VFA was a repercussion of the heat-shock treatment to remove methanogens. In the absence of hydrogen and acetate consuming species, VFA accumulation was inevitable as there was no biological removal mechanism remaining [27]. The accumulation of total VFA decreased with increasing temperature up to 60°C, at which point total VFA accumulation more closely resembled the 48°C treatment. Thus at lower temperatures, VFA production and/or accumulation was greater, inferring higher hydrolysis rates than at 52°C and above. This does not agree with the reported results for TS removal, but a possible explanation could be that the 5M NaOH added for pH control was responsible. At 36°C there was a 261% increase in total VFA concentration, which would have required a larger volume of 5M NaOH to maintain a pH of 5.2 when compared to the 77% increase in VFA shown at 56°C. The extra NaOH added would likely have had some hydrolytic effects on the substrate [28], possibly increasing the number of particles able to fit through the 0.5mm filter on the liquid sampling line, hence the increase in TS measured over time at 36°C. In this context, it is difficult to determine whether mesophilic or thermophilic conditions produced the highest substrate hydrolysis rates. Total alcohol accumulation patterns varied considerably between temperature treatments, although all treatments except 52°C reached a concentration of at least 10mM at some point during the fermentation period (Fig. 1b). In the 52°C treatment total alcohol accumulation never exceeded a concentration of 5mM, while in the 40°C treatment a maximum concentration of 25.5mM was reached. In general, alcohol production was more prevalent in the fermentations conducted at 36, 40, 44, and 56°C. Alcohol formation is less valuable energetically to bacteria than acetate formation, but solventogenesis can occur as a result of butyrate accumulation [29]. Free NH3 is toxic at low levels (4gNl−1) to anaerobic communities, particularly if they have not been acclimated first [30]. Ammonia has a pKa of 9.25, so at the operating pH of 5.2 used in this study, most ammonia should be in the NH4 + form, which is much less toxic than free NH3 [31]. Initial NH4 +–N concentrations (118–145mgL−1) were similar for the 36, 40, 44, and 48°C treatments and higher than values (81–101mgL−1) for the 52, 56, and 60°C treatments (Table 1). This variation can be attributed to variation in the starting manure used between the 2 groups of experiments, as well as the differential loss of NH3 through volatilization at different temperatures. Initial pH of the substrate slurry was in the range of 7.0–8.0 (data not shown) for all treatments, so NH3 loss in the early heating phase of each experiment likely occurred. The heating times to reach the target temperature varied from ∼30min for the 36°C treatment to ∼120min for the 60°C treatment. Final NH4 +–N concentrations were higher than initial values for all treatments, with the 36, 40, 44, and 48°C treatments showing a greater increase than the 52, 56, and 60°C treatments. The lowest final NH4 +–N concentration (107mgL−1) and the smallest increase (20%) were found in the 52°C treatment while the highest concentration (330.5mgL−1) and largest increase (128%) were found in the 48°C treatment. High ammonia (NH3 +NH4 +) concentrations can reduce the efficiency of H2 production even at pH 5.2 [31]. As NH4 + is a product of protein deamination, the large increase in concentration found at temperatures from 36 to 48°C might suggest that more protein degradation is occurring in those treatments versus the 52–60°C treatments. Whether this was due to a higher level of overall substrate degradation or because the microbial communities present at 36–48°C are better at protein degradation is uncertain. If the latter explanation is true, substrates containing high protein levels may be more suited for digestion in the 36–48°C temperature range. Because the system is anaerobic, removal of NH4 + via nitrification/denitrification is not possible as nitrification is an aerobic process [2]. No NO2 − or NO3 − was detected in any treatment beyond the initial time point (data not shown). Total gas production rate and the period of gas production varied greatly over the range of temperatures examined (Fig. 2a, b). Gas production approached zero after a period of no more than 7 days for the 36, 40, and 44°C treatments. The production period was extended an additional 4 days for the 48°C treatment and 8 days for the 52, 56, and 60°C treatments. The high VFA accumulation observed in the 36–44°C treatments may explain the early halt in gas production because of the inhibiting effect VFA have on hydrolysis [27]. With no way to remove VFA from the system, and in turn alleviate the thermodynamic constraints of anaerobic digestion, degradation essentially stopped and gas production was subsequently halted. The higher levels of ammonia found in the 36–48°C treatments may also have contributed to the reduced gas production observed at these temperatures. The maximum single-day total gas production rate (6.9Lday−1) and the highest overall gas volume (27.4L) were achieved at 52°C. The second highest gas production was achieved with the 56°C treatment (21.2L), followed by the 60°C treatment (20.9L). The treatments with the least VFA accumulation produced the most total gas in our study. The highest H2 content in the gas stream (46%) was found with the 56°C treatment (Fig. 2c). The maximum H2 content achieved in a single replicate from all treatments and replicates was 60%, found in the 52, 56, and 60°C treatments (data not shown). The balance of gas produced was composed primarily of CO2. CH4 and H2S were not detected in any of the treatments. H2 production is a by-product of acidogenesis and acetate generation from VFA and alcohols and its generation along with the other fermentation products is part of the mechanism for achieving redox balance that is essential for fermentation to occur [32,33]. VFA production in these experiments favoured butyrate generation, which agrees with the findings of others who have used heat-shock pre-treatments [1,34]. In the 52°C treatment, which yielded the highest H2 production rate, the proportion of butyrate to acetate was almost equal (∼45% of total VFA each) and that ratio remained fairly consistent over the course of the trial (Fig. 3e). In contrast, at temperatures below 52°C butyrate contributed more to total VFA than acetate, suggesting that butyrate degradation to acetate was being inhibited (Fig. 3a–d). The accumulation of butyrate could also explain the enhanced production of alcohols observed at these temperatures [29]. At 56 and 60°C, the ratio of butyrate to acetate was much lower (Fig. 3f, g), which suggests VFA conversion to acetate was not rate limiting. In these cases, acetate accumulation should still eventually inhibit degradation of VFA [35]. If VFA accumulation is not relieved, the anaerobic degradation process stops. An interesting question that arises from this study concerns the fate of acetate in the system. Under typical methanogenic conditions, acetate is consumed in the generation of CH4 via the reaction: (1) CH3COOH→CO2 +CH4 If sulfur reducing bacteria (SRB) are present, they will also consume acetate via the following reactions [2]: (2) CH3COOH→2CO2 +8H+ (3) 4S°+8H+ →4H2S The heat-shock methodology used in this study prevented the formation of any CH4 for all temperature trials. Based on this, it could be expected that SRB may fill the role of utilizing acetate in the absence of methanogens. However, our analysis of the gaseous fermentation products did not detect H2S in any of our trials, suggesting the absence of SRB in the substrate, possibly due to the heat-shock pretreatment used. In the absence of both methanogens and SRB, an accumulation of acetate in the system should occur, ultimately inhibiting conversion of VFA and solvents to acetate, which in turn would inhibit fermentation of the substrate to fermentation products. This agrees with the observations made here, with the exception of the 52°C treatment. Acetate levels were very stable for almost the entire gas production period in the 52°C treatment, indicating that acetate is being removed from the system in some way. Some sulphate reduction may have been occurring as the fermentation substrate changed to a darker black color over the course of the trial at 52°C. This observation may be due to the production of iron sulphide (FeS), which would indicate that SRB activity is in fact present despite the absence of detectable H2S in the gas stream [16]. Iron sulphide levels were not quantified in this study. The presence of SRB in the system could act as a sink for acetate, explaining the plateau in acetate concentration observed at 52°C and the ongoing production of biogas. A partial flush of the headspace with helium occurred daily after sampling in this experiment, likely providing some of the beneficial effects to hydrogen production of more complete sparging by reducing the partial pressure of H2 [8]. It should be noted, however, that the highest average H2 levels were found at 56, 60, and 48°C, with maximum H2 content in the biogas of 46%, 44%, and 42%, respectively (Fig. 2c). This increased hydrogen concentration over that found at 52°C (37%) may have helped contribute to the lower total gas volume produced because of the negative correlation between pH2 and acetate production. The maximum hydrogen concentration achieved at 36, 40, and 44°C were 17%, 24%, and 29%, respectively, so other factors such as butyrate accumulation, ammonia toxicity, etc appear to be playing a larger role than the partial pressure of hydrogen on overall hydrogen production at these temperatures. Formate can be used by microbes as an alternative to H2 as an electron carrier [36]. At the temperatures studied here, formate was only detected in the 56 and 60°C treatments (data not shown). Wu et al. [37] found that formate played a role in the degradation of isobutyrate and butyrate by a defined methanogenic culture. It is possible that the microbial community operating at 56 and 60°C is utilizing formate due to differences in kinetics or thermodynamics compared to lower temperatures, or it may be that the composition of the microbial community at these temperatures is simply different. If this is the case, then different biochemical pathways may be being utilized, resulting in the production and accumulation of measurable quantities of formate. The substrate concentration used in these trials, 80gL−1 TS, is higher than would be optimal for hydrogen production since substrate dilution is positively correlated with hydrogen production [7,38]. Given this, it seems that the 52°C treatment in particular, and the thermophilic treatments as a whole, were better able to tolerate the organic load present in these experiments. In a typical thermophilic anaerobic digestion process the rate of degradation is rapid, increasing the importance of hydrogen removal by methanogenic bacteria [39]. In the digestion system utilized here, hydrogen removal by methanogens was not occurring so the higher degradation efficiencies expected at 56 and 60°C versus the 52°C temperature were not being realized. This could have major implications for maximizing the efficiency of large scale commercial processes, where higher organic loading rates would equal higher throughput for wastes being utilized as substrate. The C/N ratios of 9.5–13.6 prevalent in this experiment were also likely not optimal based on the findings of Lin and Lay [9] who suggest an optimal value of 47. The C/N values in our study are a reflection of what would be present in a large scale H2 production process utilizing cattle manure as a substrate."
5,Conclusions,"The results of this study indicate that a heat treated cattle manure inoculum incubated at 52°C produces the largest amount of hydrogen in a batch culture system (Fig. 4 ). Inhibiting factors such as ammonia concentration, VFA accumulation, and solvent production were less prolific at 52°C than at the other temperatures tested. The detectable presence of formate in the 56 and 60°C treatments may indicate that the microbial communities present at these temperatures are not the same as those found at lower temperatures. It appears that small variations in incubation temperature (only 4°C) can considerably affect the metabolic flux of heat treated cattle manure inoculum. This fact, coupled with the ability of the microbial community present at 52°C to tolerate high organic loads, should be taken into consideration for higher throughput designs utilizing cattle manure which are required for commercial feasibility [40]."
