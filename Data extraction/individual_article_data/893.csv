0,Introduction,"The importance of the livestock sector has attracted significant attention in the last decade as a user of natural resources, a source of livelihoods, and a stimulus of economic growth (Steinfeld et al., 2006; Herrero et al., 2010; Thornton, 2010; Herrero et al., 2013). Livestock systems are estimated to occupy nearly 30% of the ice-free terrestrial surface area on earth (Steinfeld et al., 2006), and livestock products are important providers of micronutrients and proteins for humans, which can contribute approximately 17% to the kilocalorie and 33% to the protein consumption around the world, although large differences exist between rich and poor countries (Thornton, 2010). The demand for livestock products has been increasing rapidly, especially in developing countries with the growth of human population, urbanization and increasing incomes (Delgado and Mcgilloway, 2005). As one of the fastest growing agricultural subsectors in developing countries, the livestock industry can provide income for more than 1.3 billion people globally, and contribute to approximately 33% of the agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) (Thornton et al., 2006). However, some negative effects are also derived from this sector. For example, it can consume about one-third of the global cropland as well as one-third of global freshwater as feed, which would cause many environmental problems such as land degradation and air pollution (Steinfeld et al., 2006). Therefore, to ensure the sustainability of global food system, there are growing requirements to improve the environmental performance of livestock systems. As an important sector in livestock systems, ruminants have great significances for humans, as they can convert the energy stored in plant biomass polymers that are indigestible for humans, to digestible food products in the form of milk and meat (Kamra et al., 2012). The global demand for beef and dairy milk has increased rapidly in recent decades, and is estimated to continue increasing in upcoming decades due to human population expansion and improved living standards (Gerber et al., 2013; Caro et al., 2014; Patra, 2014). However, these animals always emit methane, which is a highly potent greenhouse gas with nearly 25 times greater warming potential than carbon dioxide (CO2) (Y.Y. Zhou et al., 2011b). Methane emission from ruminants contributes to nearly 16% of the global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as 33% of global anthropogenic methane emissions (Scheehle and Kruger, 2006). Approximately 75 million tonnes (Tg) of enteric methane were derived from cattle around the world in 2004, and 9 Tg were derived from small ruminants such as sheep and goats (McMichael et al., 2007). Enteric fermentation is the main contributor of methane production from ruminants, with approximately 87% derived from rumen and 13% from hindgut (Murray et al., 1976). One method to solve this problem is to improve the energetic efficiency of animals, specifically, the efficiency with which they convert feed to energy, thereby increasing feed availability and decreasing the environmental burden (Bradford, 1999; Thornton and Herrero, 2010). Generally, methane emission would represent a 2–12% loss of the ingested feed energy (Johnson and Johnson, 1995), varying with the feed intake, feed composition and animal breed (Kumar et al., 2009; Hook et al., 2010). This negatively affects the potential conversion of feed energy into metabolizable energy and serves as one of the most important inefficiencies in ruminant production systems (Johnson and Johnson, 1995; Moss et al., 2000). Therefore, lowering methane productions from ruminants has both environmental and nutritional benefits. Intensive research has been done to explore the proper strategies in suppressing methane production from ruminants in recent years, include using high-quality feed to improve animal performance and feed utilization, using different feed rations or additives to regulate rumen fermentation, and genetically improving host animals. However, there are always some associated problems in their practical applications (Table 2). Considering that ideal feed additives should reduce methane production while not adversely affect feed digestion, energy balance and animal performance (Jouany and Morgavi, 2007), one promising method is to manipulate the biochemical pathways existing in the rumen to synthesize less methane. The ability of ruminants to digest and ferment plant biomass polymers largely depends on the complex microbial community that resides in their rumen. The anaerobic environment of the rumen and highly complex food webs maintained by rumen microbiota enable the efficient fermentation of plant material into available products such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are absorbed through the rumen wall and serves as important energy substances for ruminants (Ørskov and Ryle, 1990). Hydrogen (H2) is an important intermediate produced during the ruminal fermentation process from the reducing equivalents released from glycolysis and pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1 ) (Russell and Wallace, 1997; Lourenço et al., 2010), which need to be moved efficiently for the facilitation of further rumen fermentation (Mcallister and Newbold, 2008). Methane production is considered the main H2 sink in the rumen, which is synthesized by methanogenic archaea with H2 and CO2 as substrates (Kumar et al., 2014). The interspecies H2 transfer, from the fermentative community of protozoa, fungi and bacteria to methanogens is of great importance for methane production in rumen. Incorporating the accumulated H2 into electron sinks that are nutritionally useful to animals is probably an excellent methanogenesis-inhibition strategy, due to its ability to minimize digestible energy (DE) losses from gas production while avoiding fermentation inhibition. In addition to methanogenesis, there are other important H2 disposal pathways presenting in the rumen such as propionate production, reductive acetogenesis, sulfate reduction and nitrate/nitrite reduction (Fig. 1) (Drake, 1994; Newbold et al., 2005; Zijderveld et al., 2010). Although the hydrogenation of long chain fatty acids also uses the metabolic H2 produced during fermentation, the proportion is very small. Additionally, some studies indicated the synthesis of microbial biomass could also use reducing power, but the effects of methanogenesis suppression on microbial growth are still not quantified or understood completely because many anabolic pathways are involved (Ungerfeld et al., 2007b; Guo et al., 2009). Therefore, these two H2 sinks are will not be discussed in this review."
1,Rumen microbial ecosystem and their associations with methane production,
2,Rumen microbes,"2.1 Rumen microbes Rumen is an anaerobic fermenter that contains many and diverse bacteria, protozoa, fungi and archaea. It is estimated that only a small percentage of rumen microorganisms have been cultured and characterized (Kim et al., 2011; Morgavi et al., 2013). Knowledge of this ecosystem is quickly accumulating with the development of molecular biology methods such as sequencing of the small-subunit rRNA genes (Edwards et al., 2004; Deng et al., 2008) and the more advanced metagenomic analysis (McCann et al., 2014). These novel technologies can provide a deeper description of the diverse microbial species in the rumen, and many studies have used them to study the ruminal microbial community at different taxonomic levels over these years (McSweeney and Mackie, 2012; McCann et al., 2014; Henderson et al., 2015). The ruminal microbiota and its collective genomes contains about 100 times more genes than host animal, offering them genetic and metabolic abilities that the host has not evolved on its own, including digest inaccessible nutrients (McSweeney and Mackie, 2012). The ruminal microbial diversity, density, and functions can be affected by many factors, including the diet, breed, season, geographic location, feeding strategies, feed additives, intake level, and growth stages and physiological conditions of the host animals etc. (Weimer et al., 2010; Romero-Pérez et al., 2011; Hernandez-Sanabria et al., 2012; McCann et al., 2014). However, the microbial community is generally stable because of its ecological redundancy and its resilience to resist and recover from internal or external perturbations. Although this stability provides significance to animals' nutrition and metabolism, it also brings great challenges for the engineering of rumen function via exogenous intervention (Weimer, 2015). Methane production is a result of the biochemistry of feed fermentation by the microbial community within the rumen. Due to its close association with decreased feed efficiency, more and more efforts have been made to characterize the microbial community of ruminants that differ in feed efficiency. Different microbial communities have been found in the animals differ in methane production or feed efficiency (Zhou et al., 2009; Jami et al., 2014; Kittelmann et al., 2014). Targeted manipulation of methane production will be more effectively achieved via a fuller understanding of the microecosystem relating to methane production within the rumen."
3,Methanogenic archaea,"2.2 Methanogenic archaea Methanogenic archaea in the rumen are relatively limited in both abundance and diversity (Sharp et al., 1998). According to the archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences contained in the data set, most of the methanogenic archaea (92.3%) detected in rumen are assigned into three groups at the genus level, which are Methanobrevibacter (61.6%), Methanomicrobium (14.9%) and a large group of uncultured ruminal archaea named as rumen cluster C (RCC) (15.8%) (Janssen and Kirs, 2008). The proportions of these different groups differ greatly between studies, and it is still unclear whether these differences are due to methodological differences, host selection, diet control or animal management strategies (Tajima et al., 2001; Whitford et al., 2001; Shin et al., 2004; Wright et al., 2007). Methanobrevibacter spp. is the dominant ruminal methanogens in many studies (Yanagita et al., 2000; Wright et al., 2007). Most of the ruminal methanogens can use H2 and often formate as the energy sources, and reduce CO2 to methane using the electrons derived from H2 or formate (Janssen and Kirs, 2008; Mcallister et al., 2015). Some species can also grow with methyl groups such as methylamines and methanol, by oxidizing them into CO2 to produce electrons that are further used to reduce methyl groups to methane (Neill et al., 1978; Poulsen et al., 2013). A few species, such as Methanosarcinales, can even grow with acetate, by dissimilating acetate to CO2 and methane effectively (Liu and Whitman, 2008). The hydrogenotrophic pathway is the most important methane-producing pathway present in the rumen, with approximately 82% of methane synthesis in the rumen derived from the reduction of CO2 with H2, and the major hydrogenotrophic methanogen in rumen belongs to the genus Methanobrevibacter (Janssen and Kirs, 2008; Kittelmann et al., 2013). Some members of methanogens, such as Methanosphaera, Methanimicrococcus and Methanobacterium, are also important hydrogenotrophic genera in the rumen. The communities of methylotrophs are less abundant and mainly include Methanosarcinales, Methanosphaera and Methanomassiliicoccaceae (Liu and Whitman, 2008). Using comparative genomic and metabolic pathway analyses, some conserved and methanogen-specific gene sets that are suitable as targets for anti-methanogen were also identified (Leahy et al., 2010). The ruminal methanogens can be either free-living, or associated with protozoa (PAM) or fungi (FAM) to improve the exposure to H2. Methanobacterium and Methanosphaera are free-living methanogens with no sequences discovered from protozoa or fungi (Belanche et al., 2014). Approximately 9–25% of ruminal methanogens are PAM (Newbold et al., 1995), and contribute to nearly 37% of the methane production from ruminants (Finlay et al., 1994). Methanobrevibacter and Methanomicrobium are thought to be the first and second largest genera that belong to PAM, which account for 32.8% and 23.0% of the total PAM sequences respectively (Janssen and Kirs, 2008; Patra et al., 2017). Some methanogens may also be associated with fungi. But the information concerning FAM is limited, and it is unclear if methanogens and fungi have any physical associations (Jin et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2016). Methanogens should be the microbial group that is most closely associated with methane emissions. The relative abundance of methanogen communities could affect, in part, the amount of methane emissions. The proportion of Methanosphaera spp. in total archaea was negatively associated with methane production from sheep (Kittelmann et al., 2014). Using an in vitro ruminal fermentation system, Z. Zhou et al. (2011c) also found that the addition of anti-methanogenic compounds reduced methane production, and was accompanied by a decrease in methanogen populations. However, the overall abundance of methanogens does not always positively correlate with methane emissions, for example, the numbers of methanogens and methane productions from dairy cows showed no correspondence in the studies of M. Zhou et al. (2011a), Danielsson et al. (2012) and Morgavi et al. (2012). Thus, the composition of the methanogen community might contribute more than its size to methane emissions. The study of Shi et al. (2014) supported this hypothesis to some extent, which indicated that gene expression, but not gene abundance of methanogens correlated with methane productions from individual sheep. In the studies of M. Zhou et al. (2011a), Danielsson et al. (2012) and Danielsson et al. (2017), a positive correlation was found between the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii-gottschalkii-millerae-thaurei (SGMT) clade and methane productions. Danielsson et al. (2017) further pointed out that this correlation was caused by the different H2 affinities of SGMT and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium-olleyae (RO) clade. The SGMT clade has methyl coenzyme M reductase isozymes McrI and McrII (Leahy et al., 2010), which enable the methanogens to use H2 at higher concentrations, but the RO clade just has McrI (Leahy et al., 2010; Mcallister et al., 2015)."
4,Ciliate protozoa,"2.3 Ciliate protozoa Protozoa can contribute up to 50% of the biomass in rumen, but their roles in rumen microbial ecosystem remain unclear, molecular techniques are becoming more popular in analyzing ecological status of ruminal protozoa (Karnati et al., 2003; Regensbogenova et al., 2004; Sylvester et al., 2004; Skillman et al., 2006). Considerable protozoal diversity at different genera and species levels have been found and Entodinium is suggested to be the dominant genus. Although ruminal ciliate protozoa themselves are not able to synthesize methane according to current knowledge, they are important candidates associated with methane production, especially through their abilities of abundant H2 production in their hydrogenosomes, their ability to host epi- or endo-symbiotic methanogens and to protect them from the toxicity of oxygen (Fenchel and Finlay, 2006; Belanche et al., 2014). Comparing to entodiniomorphids, holotrich protozoa are considered to have a greater effect on methanogenesis (Belanche et al., 2015) because holotrich protozoa own more active hydrogenosomes (Paul et al., 1990) and/or holotrich protozoa can rapidly synthesize glycogen when excess carbohydrates are present, and more H2 can be generated (Hall, 2011; Denton et al., 2015). From metagenomic screening of protozoal glucosidases and eukaryotic metatranscriptome, diverse glycoside hydrolases are confirmed to present in the ruminal protozoa (Findley et al., 2011; Qi et al., 2011). According to the large-scale construction and analysis of phylogenies of over 4000 Expressed Sequence Tag libraries from the rumen ciliate protozoa, extensive horizontal gene transfer from bacteria and archaea were found in the rumen ciliate genomes, among which more than 75% of genes were related to metabolism especially in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates (Ricard et al., 2006), suggesting the close interspecies interaction present in rumen and the high fibrolytic ability of protozoa. Fiber content is an important factor in determining the protozoal communities in rumen, some genera such as Ophryoscolex and Polyplastron like to present in high grain conditions (Tymensen et al., 2012), which deserve more attentions in methane mitigations. Most protozoa have no selective colonized endo-symbiotic methanogens, and different protozoal species also host different abundance or/and predominant genera/species of methanogens (Fuente et al., 2010). Removal of ciliate protozoa (defaunation) has been done to study the relationship between protozoa and methanogens, and the population and diversity of methanogens was indicated to be positively affected by the presence or absence of protozoa (Ohene-Adjei et al., 2007). A 9–37% reduction of methane production had also been observed by eliminating protozoa from the rumen in previous studies (Hook et al., 2010; Morgavi et al., 2010), while some other studies suggested that the effects of eliminating protozoa on methane production was not encouraging (Kreuzer et al., 1986; Ranilla et al., 2007; Bird et al., 2008; Hegarty et al., 2008). According to the report of Newbold et al. (2015), removal of protozoa could correlate to up to 11% of methane reduction, although the total methanogen abundance was not decreased significantly. Guyader et al. (2014) also found a positive linear relationship between the log10 numbers of protozoa and methane production expressed as per unit dry matter intake (DMI), using a meta-analysis comprising 28 experiments and 91 treatments."
5,Bacteria,"2.4 Bacteria Bacteria are the largest component of microbial biomass in the rumen, with an abundance of 1010–1011 cells/ml, the diversity of bacteria in rumen is estimated to be 7000 species of which about 30% are still not identified (McSweeney and Mackie, 2012; Patra, 2012). Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria are the most abundant bacterial phyla in the rumen (Henderson et al., 2015). Some bacteria are good H2 producers, such as cellulolytic Ruminococcus and several Eubacterium species (Firmicutes), but the cellulolytic genus Fibrobacter does not produce H2 and Bacteroidetes are net H2 utilizers (Stewart et al., 1997). By analyzing the bacterial community in 236 rumen samples from 118 low- and high-methane emitting sheep respectively, a previous study indicated that the differences in ruminal microbial community structures were associated with the level of methane emissions from sheep (Kittelmann et al., 2014). The lower-methane production ruminotype possessed a high relative number of propionate-producing Quinella ovalis, or lactate- and succinate-producing bacteria such as Fibrobacter spp., Kandleria vitulina, Olsenella spp., Prevotella bryantii and Sharpea azabuensis, while the higher-methane production ruminotype had higher relative abundances of bacterial species that belong to Ruminococcus, other Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Catabacteriaceae, Coprococcus, other Clostridiales, Prevotella, other Bacteroidales and Alphaproteobacteria. Besides, from analyzing the bacterial community in animals with varied feed efficiency, the proportion of Succiniclasticum, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus and Prevotella was rather different and thereafter probably impacting methane production from host animals (Myer et al., 2015). The relationship between bacterial community and feed efficiency were also observed in the studies of Hernandez-Sanabria et al. (2012), Jami et al. (2014). It would be helpful to investigate more about the phenotypes of the dominant ruminal H2 metabolizing bacteria for efficient methane mitigation. Proteobacteria are obviously less abundant in high methane emitting beef cattle (Wallace et al., 2015) and dairy cows (Danielsson et al., 2017). Succinivibrionaceae, the dominant family of Proteobacteria, is also present in high numbers in the foregut of the tammar wallaby (Pope et al., 2011), which partly explained the significantly lower methane production per unit of feed intake from the tammar wallaby compared with ruminants, although both of them are foregut fermenters. The Prevotella genus, however, shows some functional versatility, some of which is associated with a high methane phenotype while others are associated with low production (Kittelmann et al., 2014; Danielsson et al., 2017). And the increased abundance of H2-consuming bacteria, such as Prevotella and Selenomonas spp., in goats with the treatment of methanogenesis inhibitor perhaps could further certify this hypothesis (Denman et al., 2015). The integration of methanogens into bacterial biofilms on feed particles also represents a specific form of interaction, the ruminal methanogens and bacteria can interact via interspecies H2 transfer (Freitag et al., 2010). This interspecies H2 transfer can largely affect ruminal fermentation and volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles, energy conservation and methane production, as shown in the studies of co-cultures of methanogens with Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens and Selenomonas ruminantium (Scheifinger et al., 1975; Latham and Wolin, 1977; Wolin et al., 1997)."
6,Fungi,"2.5 Fungi Until now, more than 18 species of anaerobic rumen fungi have been described basing on molecular biological techniques such as real-time PCR and high throughput sequencing (Denman et al., 2008). Rumen fungi have been assigned into six genera including the monocentric Neocallimastix, Caecomyces, Piromyces, and the polycentric Anaeromyces, Orpinomyces and Cyllamyces (Ishaq et al., 2015). Most of the ruminal fungi are anaerobic, which produce large amounts of H2, along with CO2, formate and acetate as the metabolic products, just as protozoa (Gruninger et al., 2014). Methanogens have a close relationship with fungal hyphae (Bauchop and Mountfort, 1981), but the relationship of fungal abundance with methane emission is still not well known. Some ruminal fungal cultures have revealed the presence of methanogens, for example, a recent study found the presence of a species of Methanobrevibacter in the cultures of Anaeromyces, Neocallimastix and Piromyces (Jin et al., 2011). However, Kittelmann et al. (2014) indicated that there was no positive relationship between the fungal community structure and methane emissions from sheep. According to a meta-analysis, Newbold et al. (2015) suggested that the decreased abundance of fungi was perhaps related to the lower methane production caused by defaunation."
7,Effect of H2 transfer on ruminal methanogenesis,"H2 and CO2, produced during the process of ruminal fermentation, are the major substrates used by methanogens, and methanogenesis represents the largest H2 sink in the rumen. The partial pressure of H2 (or expressed as the concentration of dissolved H2) in the rumen generally is kept at a low level (range from 1 to 10 Pa) and has a close relationship with the fermentative pathways that use or produce H2 (Zinder, 1993; Moate et al., 1997; Janssen, 2010). As stated by Zinder (1993), the minimum H2 partial pressure threshold that is required for the occurrence of a reaction is closely related to the thermodynamics of the reaction involved, and there is an inverse relationship between the Gibb's free energy (△G0) for a reaction and the threshold of H2 partial pressure for a H2 utilizing reaction to occur. Ruminal microorganisms can change their fermentation patterns in response to even quite small differences in free energy change, by decreasing their dependence on pathways that become thermodynamically less favorable and shift to thermodynamically more favorable pathways (Cord-Ruwisch et al., 1988; Achtnich et al., 1995; Kappler et al., 1997; Chin and Janssen, 2002). The thermodynamics of different ruminal H2 disposal pathways is described in Table 1 . It seems to be advantageous to keep the partial H2 pressure in the rumen as high as possible, enabling the H2 utilization by other ruminal bacteria to be more energetically favorable. However, this is always not the case. The ruminal conditions should also be actively favorable for H2 producers, as accumulation of too much H2 would inhibit their growth (Immig, 1996). To keep the balance between H2 production and utilization, ruminal H2 partial pressure generally stays in a relatively narrow range. In an unmodified ruminal condition, the H2 partial pressure is high enough that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) do not have a competitive advantage compared to methanogens, and are low enough that acetogenesis cannot outcompete methanogens (Ellis et al., 2008). The interspecies H2 transfer in the rumen, however, actually provides many advantages for methanogens, for example, their close associations with protozoa in the rumen offers great benefits to methanogens via the direct supply of H2 to them as discussed previously. The flow of metabolic hydrogen plays a key role in energy metabolism of ruminants via driving different fermentation pathways (Janssen, 2010). Decreased methanogenesis has been supposed to enhance the allocation of H2 to other fermentation pathways that are more energetically beneficial to the host animal, but few studies have confirmed this hypothesis in animal experiments. A recent experiment conducted by Martinez-Fernandez et al. (2016) indicated that there was a shift in rumen fermentation to the production of propionate and branched-chain fatty acids when methanogenesis was inhibited, with a reduced methane emission and an increased H2 emission. According to the published batch (28 experiments, N = 193) and continuous-culture experiment (16 experiments, N = 79), Ungerfeld (2015) found that the inhibition of methane production directed the metabolic hydrogen to produce more propionate and H2, but not butyrate in batch cultures, while the overall metabolic hydrogen was not directed to propionate or butyrate in continuous cultures. The recovered metabolic hydrogen was always lower compared to the sum of propionate, butyrate, methane and H2 in both batch and continuous cultures with methanogenesis inhibited, suggesting that more metabolic hydrogen would be directed to the synthesis of formate and microbial biomass and, probably, reductive acetogenesis in continuous cultures. Furthermore, the type of substrate and methanogenesis inhibitor can affect the accumulation of H2 with methanogenesis suppressed. The highly fermentative substrates led to a greater accumulation of H2, while some oils resulted in no or minimal accumulation of H2 (Denman et al., 2015; Cobellis et al., 2016; Martinez-Fernandez et al., 2016; Martinez-Fernandez et al., 2017;). Thus, the energetic benefits of methanogenesis inhibition would depend on many factors."
8,Potential candidates for methane mitigation involving in H2 utilization,
9,Homoacetogens,"4.1 Homoacetogens Homoacetogens are a group of obligate anaerobic bacteria that can convert two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) into acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP) (Drake, 1994). Acetogenesis plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, with nearly 1013 kg of acetate formed in anaerobic habitats annually (Wood, 1991). Acetogens are phylogenetically diverse and metabolically versatile, as they can grow either heterotrophically or autotrophically and utilize various substances, including organic ones such as pentoses, hexoses, alcohols, formic acid and methyl groups, as well as inorganic substrates such as H2/CO2, carbon monoxide (CO) and formate (Drake, 1994; Schink, 1994). Some of the same substrates (H2 and CO2) are shared by methanogens and homoacetogens, enhancing the autotrophic growth of homoacetogens is a competitive pathway to methanogenesis. Acetate, as the end product of acetogenesis, can also serve as an excellent energy source for the host animal, as well as for other microorganisms within the rumen (Ørskov and Ryle, 1990). The abundance of ruminal homoacetogens highly varies (from undetectable to 107cells/ml) according to dietary composition, age of the host animal and sampling time (Leedle and Greening, 1988; Fonty et al., 2007). Acetogens are considered the dominant hydrogenotrophic populations present in the developing rumen before the establishment of methanogen, but their abundance proportionally decrease as methanogens gradually colonize the rumen during the first week of life (Morvan et al., 1994). Accompanying the development of ruminants, the abundance of homoacetogens and methanogens showed a negative correlation in the rumen of adult ruminants due to their competitive relationships (Doré et al., 1995). Some studies suggested that acetogens could replace methanogens as a H2 sink to sustain a functional rumen. In a study conducted by Fonty et al. (2007), the population of ruminal acetogens rose to a concentration as high as 107–108 cells/g when germfree lambs were inoculated with a functional rumen microbiota lacking methanogens. The feed intake and ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations also showed no significant difference from conventional lambs fed the same diet. Another study showed the abundance of acetogens increased up to 5 × 108 cells/ml at 150 days when lambs were placed in a sterile isolator at 17 h after birth, before the inoculation of methanogens. And the further inoculation of the methanogens Methanobrevibacter spp. 87.7 did not significantly affect the acetogen diversity when the lambs were reared to adulthood compared with the conventional ones (Gagen et al., 2012). However, using homoacetogens to suppress ruminal methanogenesis have some limitations that the conversion of H2 and CO2 into methane is thermodynamically more favorable than the conversion of H2 and CO2 into acetate, and the requirement of H2 threshold for methanogens is lower than most acetogens (Thauer et al., 1977). In previous studies, the direct utilization of acetogens, originating from the rumen or non-rumen, did not always successfully suppress methane production. Lopez et al. (1999a) studied the ability of six reductive acetogens to suppress methane production in vitro and found that only two of them, E. limosum strains ATCC 8486 and Ser 5 could decrease methane production by approximately 5% after 24 h of incubation. The acetogen Peptostreptococcus productus, which was isolated from an anaerobic sludge digester, promoted acetogenesis only when methanogenesis was inhibited previously (Nollet et al., 1997; Nollet et al., 1998). In the study of Yang et al. (2015), the addition of acetogen TWA4, which was isolated from the tammar wallaby, also had non significantly reduced methane production from the in vitro ruminal fermentation system, but changed the acetogen communities to some extent. The ability of an acetogen to compete with methanogens can be determined by many factors including the nature of acetogens, the environment and whether the acetogen population reaches the minimum requirement. The metabolic diversity of acetogens provides them some advantages to compete with methanogens. Acetogens can use H2 more efficiently when some specific electron acceptors are provided rather than CO2. For example, when CO2 served as electron acceptor, the minimum H2 pressure required for the growth of acetogen Acetobacterium woodii was 520 ppm, while when aromatic acrylics such as caffeic acid served as electron acceptor, the minimum H2 pressure required was just 3 ppm (Cord-Ruwisch et al., 1988). Thus, one strategy to improve the capacity of acetogens to compete with methanogens is to enable them grow in mixotrophy, namely, using H2/CO2 with other substrates simultaneously. The mixotrophic growth of acetogens has advantages in the termite gut, human gut and tammar wallaby, among others, where acetogens can dominant over methanogens. The termite acetogen Sporomusa termitida can mixotrophically grow on methanol and H2/CO2 (Breznak and Blum, 1991), the human-gut acetogen Ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus could use H2/CO2 and glucose simultaneously during growth (Leclerc et al., 1997), and the acetogen isolate TWA4 from the tammar wallaby can simultaneously utilize H2/CO2 and glycerol (Gagen et al., 2014). The information on the mixotrophic growth of ruminal acetogens is still limited, but in the study of Morvan and Fonty (1996), the acetogen Ser5 isolated from lamb utilized H2/CO2 and either xylose, cellobiose or glucose simultaneously. In consideration of this, we can regulate the dietary composition to provide the preferable substrates of acetogens to enhance their metabolism. The combination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an acetogen isolate from lamb significantly promoted acetogenesis with methanogens presented (Chaucheyras et al., 1995). Therefore, another strategy to increase the acetogenesis in the rumen is to develop selective additives to stimulate ruminal acetogenesis. Identifying the acetogen strains that are competitive with methanogens may also be a promising way to inhibit methanogenesis in the rumen. Although ruminal acetogens always have a high H2 threshold, using H2-limited continuous cultures, an acetogen has been successfully isolated from rumen and grew on a low H2 threshold (Boccazzi and Patterson, 2011). Additionally, acetogens with lower H2 threshold (approximately 800 ppm) have been found in the gut of termites (Breznak et al., 1988). The community of homoacetogens in the forestomach of the low methane producing tammar wallaby was rather different from that in ruminants (Gagen et al., 2010), which indicates there may be more effective hydrogenotrophs that can compete with methanogens in the tammar wallaby compared with ruminants. In addition to developing a novel low-H2-threshold acetogen, increasing the acetogen populations is a promising method to inhibit methanogenesis in the rumen. In the study of Le Van et al. (1998), the acetogen A. ruminis, which had an H2 threshold of 3830 ppm much higher than methanogens (approximately 126 ppm), could act as a hydrogenotroph against methanogens when cell densities reach 107/mL. Regulating the ruminal pH could also be promising strategy to increase the competition of acetogens over methanogens. It was suggested that acetogens can survive well at pH 6–6.5, but the ruminal methanogenesis would be decreased at a pH lower than 6.5 (Van Kessel and Russell, 1996)."
10,Propionate-forming bacteria,"4.2 Propionate-forming bacteria The reduction of propionate, which is one of the major VFAs that provides energy for ruminants, would consume reducing equivalents and is considered a H2-utilization pathway in the rumen, and the increase in ruminal propionate formation is stoichiometrically associated with a reduction in methane production. Succinate pathway is the primary propionate producing pathway in rumen, which involves in the propionate-forming bacteria such as lactate producers (Streptococcus bovis), lactate utilizers (Selenomonas ruminantium), fumarate reducers (Wolinella succinogenes), succinate producers (Fibrobacter succinogenes) and succinate utilizers (Selenomonas ruminantium), via reducing the dicarboxylic acids including fumarate, malate and aspartate or their metabolites to propionate with H2 or formate as electron donors (Ungerfeld and Kohn, 2006). The acrylate pathway is also an important propionate producing pathway presenting in the rumen that involves the lactate-utilizing Megasphaera elsdenii when lactate is present (Russell and Wallace, 1997). The effects of propionate-forming bacteria on methane mitigation have been reported in many studies. In the in vivo study of Jeyanathan et al. (2016), addition of Lactobacillus pentosus D31 could reduce methane production by 13% after 2 wk. of administration, and changed the diversity of bacteria and archaea at the same time. The positive effects of M. elsdenii on ruminal fermentation, energy balance and productivity of cows have also been identified in some studies, via shifting the ruminal fermentation pattern to more propionate production (Henning et al., 2010; Aikman et al., 2011). However, the effects of propionate-forming bacteria on methane mitigation probably be influenced by dietary composition in some situations. In the study of Alazzeh et al. (2012), sixteen strains of propionibacteria were used in in vitro ruminal incubation systems with concentrate and forage as substrates, respectively. Among them, Propionibacterium freudenreichii T114, Propionibacterium thoenii T159 and Propionibacterium thoenii ATCC 4874 significantly decreased methane production with either concentrate or forage as substrate, but Propionibacterium jensenii T1, Propionibacterium freudenreichii T31 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii T54 significantly decreased methane production only with corn as substrate. Propionibacterium propionicus T83 did not significantly decreased methane production, but resulted in an increased ratio of propionate production and decreased ratio of acetate to propionate production with corn as substrate. In another study, when beef cattle were supplied with high-forage diets, the supplementation of Propionibacterium acidipropionici (P169 or P54) or Propionibacterium jensenii P54 effectively reduced methane emission by an average of 13% (per kg of DMI), but when beef cattle were fed with high-concentrate diets, the supplementation of propionate-forming bacteria did not affect methane emission efficiently (Vyas et al., 2014). To enhance the metabolic activity of propionate forming bacteria and allow more H2 flow into the synthesize of propionate, one strategy is to supplement propionate precursors to the animals. The positive effects of fumarate and malate on ruminal methane reduction had been observed in many studies (Asanuma et al., 1999; Carro and Ranilla, 2003a; Newbold et al., 2005; Li et al., 2018). In the in vitro ruminal fermentation experiment conducted by Asanuma et al. (1999), when fumarate and malate were added to the co-culture of fumarate-utilizing bacteria and methanogens, methane production was always markedly decreased, both derived from formate and H2, and propionate production increased. In another in vitro study conducted by Lopez et al. (1999b), the supplementation of fumarate also positively diverted some H2 from methane production, with significantly increased propionate production and reduced methane production during 24 of fermentation. And the inhibition of methane production did not decline after a long term supplementation that lasted for 19d, the methane reduction had corresponded well to the fraction of fumarate that was converted to propionate. Combination of functionally complementary propionate producing bacteria is also a good strategy in efficient methane mitigation. In the study of Hino et al. (1994), the combination of lactate-producing bacteria with M. elsdenii increased propionate production effectively. The combination of Propionibacterium P63 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus 32 also showed the similar results, which reduced methane emissions by an average of 26.5% from dairy cows fed with a low starch diet (Philippeau et al., 2017). Through analyzing the ruminal microbiome in low methane yield and high methane yield sheep, Kamke et al. (2016) indicated the low methane yield animals had a higher abundance of lactate-producing Sharpea spp. and lactate-utilization Megasphaera spp., and increased gene and transcript abundances for propionate production was also observed."
11,Nitrate/nitrite-reducing bacteria,"4.3 Nitrate/nitrite-reducing bacteria The reduction of nitrate also serves as an alternative H2 sink in the rumen, which mainly contains a two-step processes: the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, and the reduction of nitrite to ammonia. According to the changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG), the reduction of nitrate to ammonium (ΔG = −254 kJ/mol H2) is thermodynamically more favorable than the reduction of CO2 to methane via methanogens (ΔG = −16.9 kJ/mol H2) (Ungerfeld and Kohn, 2006). The bacteria that have the ability to reduce nitrate, nitrite or both compounds are present in rumen naturally. W. succinogenes and S. ruminantium are the major nitrate-reducing bacteria present in rumen, all of which are at a concentration of 106 cells/ml of rumen fluid (Asanuma et al., 2002; Yoshii et al., 2003). However, in order to efficiently compete with methanogens, the number or activity of nitrate-reducing bacteria need to be increased due to the number of methanogen in rumen was suggested to be about 109 cells/ml of rumen fluid (Jeyanathan et al., 2011). Supplementation of nitrate to the diet of animal is a useful strategy to increase the activity of nitrate-reducing bacteria in rumen, for example, increased number of nitrate-reducing bacteria such as W. succinogenes and Veillonella parvula was observed in the study of Iwamoto et al. (2002) with the addition of nitrate. The positive effects of nitrate were also shown in the experiments of Zijderveld et al. (2011), Lund et al. (2014) and Klop et al. (2016). The methane emission decreased by 16–25% grams per kilogram of DMI or liters per kilogram of DMI when nitrate was provided at a level of 21 g NO3−/kg dry matter (DM). From a meta-analysis conducted by Lee (2014), a linear relationship was found in the decrease in methane production and increasing levels of nitrate supplementation per kilogram of body weight (BW), which were based on the data from eight studies with sheep, beef cattle, and dairy cattle. The linear decrease in methane production with increasing fed levels of nitrate was also observed in the steers and beef heifers (Newbold et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015). Considering the positive effect of nitrate on methane mitigation, urea has been replaced by nitrate as the nitrogen source in low nitrogen diets to ensure normal rumen microbial protein synthesis, and suppress methanogenesis at the same time (Li et al., 2012). The toxicity of the intermediate product nitrite has been considered an obstacle in the utilization of nitrate to suppress ruminal methanogenesis (Lund et al., 2014; Guyader et al., 2015). Perhaps nitrite, nitrate or both have toxic effects on ruminal microorganisms, including the fibrolytic bacteria and methanogens (Latham et al., 2016). Although ruminal microorganisms can reduce the nitrate into nitrite rapidly, the rate of nitrite reduction into ammonia is slower, which would result in the accumulation of nitrate in rumen (Iwamoto et al., 1999). Nitrite can be absorbed from the rumen into the blood, and it convert the blood haemoglobin into methaemoglobin. High concentrations of methaemoglobin result in methemoglobinemia. The condition of methemoglobinemia decreases the capacity of blood to transport oxygen into tissues, leading to the depressed animal performances and even the death of the animal (Morris et al., 1958). To avoid the problems associated with the toxicity of nitrite, many studies have been done to find proper solutions (Alaboudi and Jones, 1985; Takahashi and Young, 1991; Zijderveld et al., 2010). One strategy is to add nitrite-reducing bacteria and nitrate together to animals. In the in vitro experiment conducted by Anderson and Rasmussen (1998), the co-addition of nitrate-reducing ruminal bacteria Denitrobacterium detoxificans strain NPOH1 and nitrate eliminated 95% of methane production and no nitrite was accumulated, but there was only a 25% reduction of methane production with the absence of D. detoxificans, and the accumulation of nitrate was also observed. In another in vitro study conducted by Iwamoto et al. (2002), the addition of the nitrate-reducing bacterial species W. succinogenes, S. ruminantium or V. parvula to the culture of methanogens significantly reduced methanogenesis by more than 70% when nitrate was presented. Furthermore, a buffalo rumen isolate showed good capacities to alleviate nitrite toxicity and inhibit methanogenesis when used together with nitrate, without negatively affecting feed digestibility (Sakthivel et al., 2012). In addition, some engineering bacteria such as Escherichia coli strains that own the ability to inhibit nitrite accumulation and methane production have been developed, which can serve as good candidates to be used as novel nitrate-reducing bacteria for methane mitigation. (Sar et al., 2005a; Sar et al., 2005b)."
12,Sulfate-reducing bacteria,"4.4 Sulfate-reducing bacteria Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are a diverse group of anaerobic bacteria that mainly use sulfate, the most oxidized form of sulfur, as terminal electron acceptor for the oxidation of H2 and many kinds of organic compounds such as alcohols, amino acids and some aromatic compounds (Muyzer and Stams, 2008). The metabolism of SRB is flexible, which can perform two different life styles, known as sulfidogenic and acetogenic, hydrogenogenic metabolism. When sulfate is present, they can usually outcompete methanogens because of their high affinities for common substrates, which divert carbon and electron flow of organic compounds away from methanogenesis to sulfidogenesis. In the sulfate-depleted environment, SRB and methanogens do not compete but complement each other for the degradation of organic matter, in which case some SRB can ferment organic acids and alcohols with the production of H2, CO2 and acetate, and then H2– or acetate-utilizing methanogens convert them to methane. Therefore, sulfate-reducing bacteria may compete with methanogens and grow in syntrophy with methanogens depending on the prevailing environmental conditions (Muyzer and Stams, 2008). The abundance of SRB in the rumen is generally low at a concentration of approximately 105–106 cells/ml, with Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum as the main genus (Campbell and Postgate, 1965; Huisingh et al., 1974). Although the reduction of sulfate has a thermodynamic advantage over the reduction of CO2 to methane (ΔG = −21.1 kJ/mol H2 v. −16.9 kJ/mol H2) (Ungerfeld and Kohn, 2006), the actual occurrence of sulfate-reduction in the rumen is significantly limited by the amount of sulfur containing compounds present (Zinder, 1993). The level of sulfur in a normal/healthy animal diet is recommended at 0.15% by National Research Council (w/w, on dry matter basis), usually not high enough to permit sulfate-reducers to outcompete methanogens as the major H2 sink in the rumen. The concentration of sulfate of 10–22 mM could effectively decrease the rate of methenogenesis during alkane degradation (Zengler et al., 1999; Gieg et al., 2008; Siegert et al., 2011), but the interactions of SRB and methanogens in the rumen have not been fully described. Increasing the sulfate levels in the animals' diet can be a useful strategy to increase the competiveness of SRB against methanogens for H2 in the rumen (Kuivila et al., 1990; Holmer and Kristensen, 1994). Cummings et al. (1995) indicated that the introduction of a high-sulfate diet to steers could significantly improve the sulfate reducing capacity of SRB without significantly increasing the numbers of SRB. Wu et al. (2015) also found that increasing the sulfur content could increase the population of sulfate-reducing bacteria and reduce methane emission without significantly changing total archaeal population. Although some studies proposed the positive effect of sulfate on methanogenesis inhibition (Morvan et al., 1996; Zijderveld et al., 2010), the toxicity of H2S derived from sulfate reduction has to be considered when using sulfate as an additive. Some SRB are versatile organisms that possess the ability to oxidize H2S to sulfate and prevent the accumulation of toxic levels of H2S (Dröge et al., 2005). In addition, some ruminal microorganisms such as cellulolytic bacteria and fungi, can use H2S to synthesize sulfur-containing amino acids (Bryant, 1973). A newly isolated group of sulfate-reducing bacteria, known as Fusobacterium spp., reduce methane production by approximately 62% at 72 h of in vitro incubation without accumulation of H2S, and the abundance of cellulolytic bacteria and digestion of fiber were also increased (Paul et al., 2011). Thus, selecting specific sulfate-reducing bacterial strains that have the ability to oxidize H2S, or using a combination of sulfate-reducing bacteria and other ruminal microorganisms that can utilize H2S is a promising strategies in methane mitigation. Nitrate-reducing-sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (NR-SOB) are a subset bacterial group that can use sulfides as electron donors for nitrite ammonification (Garcia-De-Lomas et al., 2007; Hubert and Voordouw, 2007). Metabolic interaction between SRB and NR-SOB have been described in many anaerobic environments, For example, in anaerobic marine sediments, the organic matter is mostly oxidized by SRB with the production of sulfide that is being re-oxidized by NR-SOB (Fossing et al., 1995). However, the presence of NR-SOB is limited in the rumen due to the low concentration of ruminal sulfide. The ruminal SRB W. succinogenes was suggested to have physiological similarities with NR-SOB Sulfurospirillium deleyianum, which have the ability to use sulfide as an electron donor and fumarate as an electron acceptor for its growth (Macy et al., 1978; Simon, 2002). Co-supplementation of SRB and NR-SOB to ruminants thus may be an excellent way for methane mitigation, and it is also a good choice to avoid the toxic problems associated with the intermediate of H2S and nitrite. Some SRB such as the species of Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum can also reduce nitrite to ammonia (Mitchell et al., 1986; Seitz and Cypionka, 1986), which are good candidates to be added together with nitrate when using as methane inhibitors, simultaneously solving the problems of nitrite toxicity. The positive effects of co-addition of sulfate and nitrate on methane mitigation have been found in the studies of Zijderveld et al. (2010) and Patra and Yu (2014), and the combination of nitrate and SRB need further exploration."
13,Perspective and conclusions,"Ruminal methane production is a result of the biochemistry of feed fermentation by the microbial community within the rumen. Methanogen is the direct methane producer in the rumen, but other microorganisms including ciliate protozoa, bacteria and fungi would closely interact with methanogens, either physically or functionally. A comprehensive understanding of the micro-ecosystem, such as the functional microorganisms or genes that have been detected in the low- and high- methane producing animals, can provide more targeted manipulation for methane mitigation. Since H2 is the primary substrate for the process of methanogenesis in the rumen, other H2-utilizing ruminal microorganisms such as the homoacetogens, propionate-forming bacteria, nitrate/nitrite-reducing bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria, are promising candidates for decreasing methanogenesis in the rumen. Although homoacetogenesis is thermodynamically less favorable than methanogenesis process, many strategies can be done to improve its competitiveness, including providing them with some preferable substrates such as glucose, glycerol and xylose together with H2 and CO2 due to their mixotrophic advantages, supplementing them with some acetogenesis stimulants such as yeast culture, regulating the ruminal environment at a lower pH, and identifying novel acetogen strains that grow on low H2 threshold or improving their densities in the rumen. Propionate producing bacteria, nitrate/nitrite-reducing bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria have some thermodynamic advantages compared to methanogens when using H2 as an electron donor, however, their metabolism would be limited in normal ruminal environment due to their low abundance or lack of essential substrates. Supplementing animals with propionate precursors such as fumarate and malate, or using combination of functionally complementary propionate producing bacteria as additives are both promising strategies to enhance propionate producing pathway in rumen. Considering the low presence of nitrate and sulfate in rumen, using nitrate or/and sulfate as additives are optional strategies to enhance the activity of nitrate-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Due to the toxic problems derived from nitrite or H2S, it is better to use the combinations of SRB and NR-SOB, or some SRB that can utilize H2S or nitrite together as additives in practical application. Given the dynamic nature of ruminal microorganisms, the persistence of these strategies on methane mitigation need to be further explored in large scale animal experiments."
