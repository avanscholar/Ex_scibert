0,Introduction,"The demand for energy resources is increasing in recent years due to the rise in the global population and fast-growing industries. At the same time, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is increasing with time due to burning of fossil fuels [1–3]. Hence, there is an urgent need to utilize carbon–neutral renewable energy resources over carbon-based non-renewable resources. In this regard, hydrogen (H2) has been considered an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels that can be directly utilized in vehicles or fuel cells for electricity generation [4–6]. The H2 production from renewable resources like water has been achieved via various ways, such as electrolysis, high-temperature water splitting, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and photocatalytic water splitting [7–10]. Amongst these methods, the photocatalytic path has emerged as a promising greener route for the production of clean fuel, H2, from water catalyzed by photocatalysts which is facilitated by absorption of natural sunlight [11–16]. However, significant efforts are being made to develop efficient photocatalysts which can catalyze a high rate of H2 generation from water with high quantum yield. On the other hand, biomass is considered an alternative renewable carbon resource that is highly abundant and available at low cost [17–20]. Literature reports have demonstrated that controlled degradation of biomass can lead to generation of various biomass-derived compounds like alcohols, furans, lactic acid, etc. The subsequent conversion of these biomass-derivatives to value-added products such as aldehydes, olefins, xylose, levulinic acid, polylactic acid, etc., is of potential significance. Especially, the conversion of biomass-derived alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes has gained significant interest due to their potential applications in bio-refinery as commodity chemicals for high-value products, such as agrochemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and so on [21–24]. Among them, furfuraldehyde has been listed among the top 14 important bio-based chemicals by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [25]. It is a key platform chemical to produce biofuels and high-value products widely utilized in the agrochemical, plastic, pharmaceutical, and oil refining industries. In literature, conventional approaches like chemical/photochemical oxidation routes have been employed to convert biomass-derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes using strong oxidizing agents in non-green solvents like benzotriflouride, DMF, DMSO, etc [26–30]. These approaches often require high temperature, toxic chemical oxidants, and noble metal catalysts. Moreover, harsh reaction conditions employed result in lower catalytic conversion and selectivity of the product. Further, recent literature reports have shown that the photocatalytic H2 production half-reaction can be combined with oxidation of biomass derivatives to achieve sustainable conversion of biomass derivatives and simultaneous H2 production under mild and greener conditions [31–35]. In these photocatalytic processes, the photogenerated electrons and holes are utilized to reduce protons of water to H2, and oxidation of biomass-derived molecules, respectively. In this context, Sun et al. reported the application of Ni/CdS as photocatalyst for simultaneous H2 production and oxidation of biomass-derived alcohols (furfuryl alcohol/HMF) to corresponding aldehydes under visible light [31]. Very recently, Li et al. demonstrated the fabrication of Ti3C2Tx/CdS composites for H2 generation with a rate of 777 μmol g−1 combined with furfuryl alcohol oxidation to furfuraldehyde with a yield of 40% and selectivity of 93% [35]. However, there is significant scope for developing efficient photocatalytic systems to achieve high yield and selectivity of furfuraldehyde along with enhanced H2 production. In this direction, we report the fabrication of a noble metal-free CoTiO3/xZn0.5Cd0.5S binary heterojunction Z-scheme photocatalyst which possesses optimal band edge position suitable for the production of H2 from water and oxidation of biomass derivatives [36]. Thus, we synthesized CoTiO3/xZn0.5Cd0.5S (x = 5 (S1), 10 (S2), 15 (S3) and 20 wt% (S4)) heterostructures by in situ decoration of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles on CoTiO3 microrods. Interestingly, the heterostructure, CoTiO3/10 wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S2), exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with a H2 generation rate of 1929 μmol g−1h−1 coupled with oxidation of furfuryl alcohol to furfuraldehyde in 95% yield, which is about 4-times higher than that of pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S catalyst. Furthermore, the heterostructure catalyst, S2, exhibited good photostability and recyclability for up to five cycles and retained the catalytic activity. Overall, this work highlights the rational integration of H2 production combined with oxidation of biomass derivative under environment-friendly conditions."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of CoTiO3 microrods,"2.1 Synthesis of CoTiO3 microrods Typically, Co(Ac)2·2H2O (1 mmol) and 3.4 mL of Ti(OC4H9)4 were dissolved in 60 mL of ethylene glycol under constant stirring for 5 h. Afterward, the pink-colored precipitate of CoTiO3 microrods formed was centrifuged and washed by water/ethanol and dried under vacuum for 12 h. Then the solid was further calcinated at 700 °C in a tube furnace under air for 2 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min to obtain CoTiO3 microrods. The CoTiO3 microrods were synthesized following the procedure reported earlier [36]."
3,Preparation of CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructure,"2.2 Preparation of CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructure The CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructures were prepared by in situ decoration of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles on CoTiO3 microrods. In a typical procedure for the synthesis of CoTiO3/10 wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S2), about 100 mg of CoTiO3 was dispersed in 50 mL of water and to which 40 mL of an aqueous solution containing 0.1 mmol Cd(Ac)2·2H2O and 0.1 mmol Zn(Ac)2·2H2O was added with constant stirring for 1 h. The above solution was dropwise added to CoTiO3 suspension under constant stirring for 30 min followed by slow addition of Na2S solution (0.2 mmol, 40 mL). The mixture was allowed to stir for 24 h, and the product obtained was collected by centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol and water alternatively. A similar procedure was used to prepare other heterostructures, CoTiO3/xZn0.5Cd0.5S (x = 5 (S1), 15 (S3), and 20 wt% (S4)) in which the Zn0.5Cd0.5S precursor ratio was varied with respect to CoTiO3. Pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S was also prepared following a similar procedure in the absence of CoTiO3."
4,Photocatalytic studies,"2.3 Photocatalytic studies 2.3.1 Photocatalytic H2 generation studies Photocatalytic H2 generation studies were performed under an inert atmosphere at room temperature and ambient pressure using a 105 mL Pyrex reactor. Three white LED (3 X 30 W) bulbs were used as a visible light source (λ > 420 nm) emitting at λmax = 450 nm. Typically, 10 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in a 40 mL aqueous solution of sacrificial electron donor (15 vol% lactic acid or 0.25 M Na2S/0.35 M Na2SO3). Then the reactor was sealed and the mixture was saturated with N2 to remove dissolved oxygen and then the mixture was irradiated with white LED light with continuous stirring. At regular intervals, 2 mL of head gas was taken from the reactor's headspace and injected into GC to quantify H2 produced. 2.3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production integrated with biomass derivative oxidation study The photocatalytic studies for H2 production integrated with biomass derivative furfuryl alcohol oxidation were performed in a 105 mL pyrex glass reactor. The photocatalyst (25 mg) and furfuryl alcohol (2 mg/mL) were dispersed in 20 mL of deionized water by sonication. After that, the reactor was sealed tightly and dissolved oxygen was removed by N2 saturation, followed by irradiation by white LED light under continuous stirring. For the quantification of H2 produced, 2 mL of gas was taken from the reactor's headspace and injected into GC. Once the reaction is completed, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation. The product was extracted using ethyl acetate and the yield of furfuraldehyde was determined by GC–MS analysis. It is noteworthy to mention here that no sacrificial agents were used in this process. 2.3.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a scanning potentiostat (Metrohm, Autolab) in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. The 2.6 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL DMF in the presence of 4 µL 0.25% Nafion solution by ultrasonication for 15 min. After that the suspension was drop casted to form a uniform film on an indium doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate with a 1 × 1 cm2 area. The glass substrate was dried for 2 h and used as working electrode. The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt wire were used as reference and counter electrode, respectively, and the Na2SO4 was employed as an aqueous electrolyte. The experiments were performed using light-emitting LED (14 W, 1400 Lumen, Wipro) lamp as visible light source which was positioned at 10 cm from the electrochemical cell."
5,Results and discussion,"The CoTiO3 microrods were prepared by following the ethylene glycol mediated synthesis route (Scheme 1 ) [36]. The CoTiO3/xZn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructures were obtained by in situ decoration of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles on CoTiO3 microrods as depicted in Scheme 1. The CoTiO3/xZn0.5Cd0.5S (x = 5 (S1), 10 (S2), 15 (S3) and 20 wt% (S4)) heterostructures were obtained by varying the percentage of Zn0.5Cd0.5S precursors."
6,Structure and morphology,"3.1 Structure and morphology X-ray powder diffraction patterns of as-prepared CoTiO3 microrods show diffraction peaks at 2θ = 23.9, 32.8, 35.4, 40.5, 49.0, 53.5, 61.9, and 63.5° (Fig. 1 ) which are indexed to (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (214), and (300) diffraction planes of phase pure hexagonal phase of CoTiO3 (JCPDS No. 15-0866) [36–39]. All the diffraction peaks matched well with CoTiO3 and no extra peaks were observed, indicating phase purity of the sample. Further, with an increase in the loading of Zn0.5Cd0.5S from S1 to S4, the peak corresponding to cubic Zinc-Blende (ZB) phase of Zn0.5Cd0.5S was observed at 2θ = 26.4° (Fig. 1). Upon further increase in the content of Zn0.5Cd0.5S beyond 40 wt% the peaks corresponding to Zn0.5Cd0.5S were seen in the XRD pattern (Figure S1). For the sake of comparison, pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S was synthesized and the XRD pattern show peaks at 2θ = 26.4, 43.7 and 52.2° corresponding to (111), (220), and (311) planes of ZB structure [40–42]. The elemental content of the samples was determined by microwave-plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MP-AES) analysis and the corresponding results are presented in Table 1 . The weight percentages of the constituent metals, Cd, Zn, Co, and Ti estimated from MP-AES matched well with the theoretical calculations based on the precursor’s composition used for the synthesis. Further, FESEM analysis of pristine CoTiO3 revealed the presence of microrod-like morphology with an average length of 1–3 μm (Fig. 2 a). At the same time, the FESEM images (Fig. 2b-e) of CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S1-S4) heterostructures showed that the Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles are decorated on the surface of CoTiO3 microrods. Also, the FESEM image of pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S showed the presence of aggregated nanoparticles morphology (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EDAX) analyses of pure CoTiO3, Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructures confirm the presence of constituent elements, Co, Ti, O, Zn, Cd, and S (Figure S2) and the homogeneous distribution of the elements in the heterostructures is evidenced from the elemental mapping analysis (Figure S3). The HRTEM images of CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S2) heterostructure confirmed the decoration of Zn0.5Cd0.5S (5–8 nm) nanoparticles on the surface of CoTiO3 microrods (Fig. 3 a and b). Further, the lattice fringes with calculated d-spacing of 0.27 nm and 0.32 nm correspond to (104) and (111) plane of CoTiO3 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, respectively (Fig. 3c and d) [43,44]. As shown in (Fig. 3d), the Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoTiO3 lattice fringes confirmed the heterojunction formation."
7,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis,"3.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis XPS analysis was performed to investigate the surface chemical compositions and the oxidation states of the CoTiO3, Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and S2. The survey spectrum of the samples is presented in Figure S4 and the high resolution deconvoluted XPS spectrum of each element is given in Fig. 4 . All the XPS spectra were calibrated using the fixed value of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV. In (Fig. 4a), the intense peaks at 780.3 and 796.7 eV correspond to Co 2p of CoTiO3. These two peaks are 16.2 eV apart, which confirms the + 2 oxidation state of cobalt ions. While the Co 2p peaks for S2 shift slightly to 780.4 and 796.8 eV [39,42]. The peaks with binding energy at 458.0, 463.7 eV (Fig. 4b) corresponds to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of CoTiO3, respectively. The splitting energy of 5.64 eV between the two peaks confirms the presence of Ti4+ [37,38]. With the introduction of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, the peaks of Ti4+ shift to 458.1 and 463.8 eV, indicating a slight increase in binding energy. The oxygen spectrum is shown in (Fig. 4c) with an intense peak at 529.6 eV for Co-O and 529.0 eV for Ti-O as TiO2 can be formed in trace amounts in CoTiO3 [44]. These peaks of O 1 s for S2 shift to 529.9 and 528.7 eV. The broad peaks in the spectra at 531.3 and 532.0 eV correspond to the environmental oxygen and surface hydroxyl groups [37]. The peaks in Zn 2p spectra (Fig. 4d) for Zn0.5Cd0.5S appear at 1021.9 and 1044.9 eV, while the peaks of Zn 2p for S2 shift towards lower binding energy at 1021.6 and 1044.7 eV. These peaks can be assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. The 2p doublet is separated by 23.1 eV, which confirms the binding of zinc to sulfur [45,46]. (Fig. 4e) shows the stacked Cd 3d spectra of both Zn0.5Cd0.5S and S2. The peaks at 411.9 and 405.2 eV are attributed to Cd of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, while the peaks of Cd for S2 at 411.8 and 405.0 eV are shifted towards lower binding energy [46]. The XPS spectra of S 2p for both Zn0.5Cd0.5S and S2 (Fig. 4f) show peaks at 162.7, 161.5 and 162.5, 161.3 eV, respectively. The peaks at higher binding energy for both the samples are assigned to 2p1/2 and those at lower energy correspond to 2p3/2 of S2- ions [47]. The shifting of peaks in XPS spectra of elements indicates ionic interaction between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoTiO3 in S2 heterostructure. The binding energies of Zn, Cd and S decrease, whereas those of Co, Ti, and O increase. This opposite electron flow is evident in the ionic interactions of CoTiO3 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, supporting the formation of heterojunction [34,48]."
8,Optical properties,"3.3 Optical properties Solid-state UV–Visible absorption spectra were recorded to study the optical properties of as-synthesized heterostructures. As shown in Fig. 5 , the pristine CoTiO3 absorbs over a wide spectrum from UV to visible region. It exhibits broad absorption in the region between 300 and 500 nm due to the charge-transfer interaction between O2− → Ti4+ and two bands at 537 and 610 nm, corresponding to Co2+ → Ti4+ charge-transfer transitions [38,44,49]. As the content of Zn0.5Cd0.5S increases in S1-S4, a slight redshift in the absorption edge of CoTiO3 was observed, suggesting their ability to absorb visible light more efficiently. The bandgap (BG) energy of the samples calculated using the Tauc relationship [50] were found to be 2.29 eV and 2.37 eV for CoTiO3 (indirect transition) and Zn0.5Cd0.5S (direct transition), respectively (Fig. 5b and 5c). The calculated bandgap values for CoTiO3 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S are in good agreement with literature reported systems and also Zn0.5Cd0.5S has a bandgap higher than CdS (2.18 eV, Figure S5), suggesting the formation of Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution [39,16,51,43]. The Tauc plots for heterostructures are given in Figure S5 and the estimated BG values of heterostructures (S1-S4) were found to lie in between 2.30 and 2.37 eV (Table 1) [45]. The BG calculations revealed that the heterostructures are visible light active."
9,Photocatalytic studies,"3.4 Photocatalytic studies 3.4.1 Photocatalytic H2 evolution studies The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructures was tested under visible light irradiation. Optimization of the catalytic reaction revealed the necessity of catalyst, visible light and sacrificial electron donors for a high rate of H2 production activity. The plots of time-dependent H2 generation from water catalyzed by pure CoTiO3, Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S1-S4) heterostructures are shown in Fig. 6 . From the H2 generation plots, it can be seen that the heterostructures exhibit higher catalytic activity with an enhanced rate of H2 generation over pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S. While pure CoTiO3 does not show H2 production activity, which can be attributed to the absence of favorable conduction band potential to reduce the protons of water to H2. It is interesting to note that among the heterostructures, CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, S2 exhibited the best H2 evolution activity with the rate of 4.32 mmol g−1h−1 and 9 mmol g−1h−1 in acidic and basic medium, respectively, which are about 6 and 6.5 times higher than the corresponding values observed for pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The enhanced H2 generation activity of S2 can be attributed to effective charge separation at the CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S interface aided by the Z-scheme mechanism. For the sake of comparison, the H2 generation activity studied for CoTiO3/10 wt% CdS was found to be 0.31 mmol g−1h−1 and 0.35 mmol g−1h−1 under acidic and basic conditions, respectively. These studies highlight the excellent catalytic activity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution in comparison to pure CdS. A proposed mechanism for H2 production from water catalyzed by heterostructure S2 is given in Scheme S1. Further, the catalyst was recycled for five cycles and no appreciable loss in the H2 generation rate was observed (Figure S6). The comparison of the catalytic activity (Table S1) showed a higher/comparable rate of H2 evolution catalyzed by S2 over the literature reported catalysts based on Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H2 production activity in presence of Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial electron donor is calculated to be 8.96% at 450 nm. 3.4.2 Photocatalytic H2 production integrated with oxidation of biomass derivative Motivated by the high H2 generation activity of the heterostructures, we turned our attention to investigate simultaneous H2 generation and oxidation of biomass derivative, furfuryl alcohol in the absence of sacrificial electron donors. A series of controlled experiments were conducted using CoTiO3/10 wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S, S2 as a model catalyst which exhibited the best H2 production activity in the presence of sacrificial electron donors. Various control experiments were conducted to evaluate the role of photocatalyst, visible light, and water (Table S2, Figure S7-S14). At the optimized reaction conditions, the catalytic activity of the samples was investigated for simultaneous H2 generation and furfuryl alcohol oxidation using 25 mg photocatalyst, 2 mg/mL of furfuryl alcohol in 20 mL water under visible light irradiation with three 30 W white LED lamps. The catalytic activity carried out using pure CoTiO3 as catalyst showed no H2 generation and negligible yield of furfuraldehyde (Figure S15). In contrast, pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S showed 448 μmol g−1h−1 of H2 generation along with furfuraldehyde yield of 24% (Figure S16) at the optimized conditions. At the same time, the use of CoTiO3/5wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S, S1 as photocatalyst resulted in a H2 generation rate of 845 μmol g−1h−1 and furfuraldehyde yield of 39% after 24 h (Figure S17), which was higher than that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. To our delight, CoTiO3/10 wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S2) as catalyst led to a superior H2 generation rate of 1929 μmol g−1h−1 (Fig. 7 ) and furfuraldehyde yield of 95% with 100% selectivity (Figure S18). Indeed, GC–MS analysis of the aliquots extracted at regular intervals confirmed the time-dependent conversion of furfuryl alcohol to furfuraldehyde, accompanied by an increase in the rate of H2 generation supporting our hypothesis that furfuryl alcohol oxidation is coupled with H2 production (Figure S19). The photocatalytic activity of the heterostructures S1-S4 for the combined activity of furfuryl alcohol oxidation and H2 production is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from Fig. 7, with an increase in the content of Zn0.5Cd0.5S from 5 to 10 wt% in the heterostructures (S1 and S2), the rate of H2 production and yield of furfuraldehyde increases. However, an increase in the Zn0.5Cd0.5S content to 20 wt% in S4 led to a decline in the activity (Table 2 , Fig. 7 and Figure S20-S21). This decrease in the activity can be attributed to an increase in the concentration of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles resulting in their partial aggregation on the surface of CoTiO3 microrods, thereby reducing the number of active sites as well as visible light absorption property. The heterostructure S2 exhibited a maximum H2 generation rate of 1929 μmol g−1h−1 and furfuraldehyde yield of 95% within 24 h over other heterostructures. Interestingly, the use of CoTiO3/10 wt%CdS heterostructure as a catalyst led to a H2 generation rate of 275 μmol g−1h−1 and furfuraldehyde yield of about 12% only (Figure S22). These observations highlight the advantage of using Zn0.5Cd0.5S over CdS to achieve improved catalytic activity for high yield production of H2 and furfuraldehyde. Hence the improved catalytic activity of the heterostructure, S2, over the parent samples can be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between CoTiO3 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, promoting facile separation of charge carriers at the interface aided by Z-scheme heterojunction formation. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H2 production activity in presence of furfuryl alcohol as sacrificial electron donor is calculated to be 4.78% at 450 nm. The recyclability of photocatalyst S2 was tested for five cycles, and it was observed that the catalyst showed good photostability and recyclability with retaining the catalytic activity (Fig. 8 a). The XPS analysis of the recovered S2 after five cycles of catalysis matched well with that of the pristine sample confirming the presence of all the constituent elements in their original oxidation state (Figure S23). Further, MP-AES analysis of the recovered S2 supports that elemental composition was retained even after five cycles of catalysis. Besides, powder XRD pattern and FESEM images of the recovered catalyst matched with that of as prepared samples suggesting the structural stability (Figure S24). It is worth highlighting that the heterostructure CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S reported here exhibited superior catalytic activity with enhanced yield and selectivity for furfuraldehyde formation in comparison to several previously reported catalysts in the literature (Table S3) [31,35]."
10,Photocatalytic mechanistic study,"3.5 Photocatalytic mechanistic study To investigate the mechanistic details of the reaction, a series of control experiments were conducted to understand the insight mechanistic path of photocatalytic reactions (Figure 8b). The role of water in catalysis was examined by carrying out the reaction in an aprotic solvent, i.e., acetonitrile (dried) as a reaction medium. Interestingly, the yield of furfuraldehyde formed was only up to 3.5% (Figure S25), along with a H2 production rate of 16 μmol g-1h−1. This decrease in the yield of furfuraldehyde and the H2 generation rate suggests that the major source of H+ was water. The contribution of H+ by self-oxidation of furfuryl alcohol is relatively less. To further elucidate our hypothesis on holes-driven furfuryl alcohol oxidation, the catalysis experiment was performed in the presence of an electron scavenger, i.e., Na2S2O8. In this case, the H2 evolution was quenched; however, about 98% yield of furfuraldehyde was obtained within 12 h of visible light irradiation (Figure S26). The high yield of furfuraldehyde in 12 h suggests that the photogenerated electrons were utilized for H2 generation and holes for oxidation of biomass derivative, furfuryl alcohol. Further, the participation of OH radicals in photocatalysis was evaluated by conducting the catalytic reactions in the presence of isopropanol (IPA), a radical quencher. To our delight, about 94% of furfuryl alcohol was converted to furfuraldehyde (Figure S27) which is close to the yield of furfuraldehyde obtained even in the absence of IPA, suggesting no participation of OH radicals. Photoluminescence studies were carried out to understand the activity pattern of different heterostructures at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the PL spectra of parent Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoTiO3 show intense emission bands around 485 nm (λexc = 340 nm). The PL emission of CoTiO3 at 485 nm was quenched in the heterostructure, supporting the efficient transfer of charge carriers at the heterojunction. Further, PL emission intensity of the heterostructures follows their reactivity trend with maximum quenching observed with S2, which exhibits the best photocatalytic activity. Further, transient photocurrent measurements were carried out without any external bias at 0 V potential for CoTiO3 and S2. As shown in Fig. 9b, the heterostructure, CoTiO3/10 wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S2), showed a higher photocurrent density than CoTiO3. These results suggest the facile separation and transfer of photo-excited charge carriers in the heterostructure, S2, compared to the parent sample. The appearance of a small photocurrent in the dark could be attributed to internal charge carriers in these samples, which respond to the electrolyte environment's reaction [52–54]. Thus, both PL and the photocurrent measurements support the experimental observations and established the superior charge separation and transfer in the case of CoTiO3/10 wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S2). Based on the discussion mentioned above, a plausible mechanism for simultaneous H2 generation and oxidation of biomass derivative, furfuryl alcohol catalyzed by CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructure is shown in Scheme 2 . Upon irradiation with light, both Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoTiO3 absorb visible light, leading to electron-hole pair formation. Their recombination is prevented due to the Z-scheme heterojunction formation, which facilitates the movement of these charge carriers to the respective catalytic sites. The VB (EVB) and CB (ECB) were calculated by following Mulliken electronegativity theory [55–57]: (1) E CB = x - E C - 0.5 E g (2) E VB = E CB + E g Here Ec is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), Eg is bandgap and χ is electronegativity. The CB and VB positions of CoTiO3 were calculated to be 0.11 and 2.40 eV, respectively, whereas, for Zn0.5Cd0.5S, CB and VB lie at −0.64 and 1.74 eV, respectively [38,40,44]. The calculated values of CB and VB positions matched well with the reported values and the band structure before heterojunction formation is represented in Scheme 2a [39,40,43]. It is reported in the literature that the difference in electronegativity and work function of photocatalysts play a vital role in illustrating the facile electron-hole transfer aided by the Z-scheme mechanism [58]. The electronegativity values of CoTiO3 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S are 5.76 and 5.05, respectively [39,59]. Since the work function of Zn0.5Cd0.5S (6.70 eV) is lower than CoTiO3 (6.79 eV), the Fermi level of Zn0.5Cd0.5S is higher as compared to CoTiO3 [60,61]. Hence, when the heterostructure was irradiated by visible light as shown in Scheme 2b, the positive charge accumulates at Zn0.5Cd0.5S side and negative charge at CoTiO3, which results in a built-in electric field and band edges bending at the interface between CoTiO3 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, facilitating the facile transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between CB of CoTiO3 and VB of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The factors like, internal electric field, band bending and Coulomb repulsion, collectively hinder the photogenerated electron transfer from CB of Zn0.5Cd0.5S to CB of CoTiO3 as well as the transfer of holes from VB of CoTiO3 to VB of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. This facilitates the efficient electron-hole separation and enhanced catalytic activity of the heterostructures [34]. Moreover, it is reported in literature that alcohols generally adsorb on metal oxide through hydroxyl group in water [31]. Similarly, here also furfuryl alcohol will adsorb through its hydroxyl group on CoTiO3, takes up holes from VB of CoTiO3 and undergoes oxidation, whereas the electrons of CB of Zn0.5Cd0.5S reduce the protons of water into H2."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the development of noble metal-free CoTiO3/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructure photocatalyst exhibiting excellent photocatalytic activity for visible light assisted H2 generation combined with oxidation of biomass derivative, furfuryl alcohol to value-added product, furfuraldehyde is presented. The heterostructure, CoTiO3/10 wt%Zn0.5Cd0.5S (S2), showed enhanced photocatalytic activity with a H2 generation rate of 1929 μmol g−1h−1 combined with selective oxidation of furfuryl alcohol to furfuraldehyde with 95% yield. The combined H2 generation rate and furfuraldehyde yield was about 4-fold higher than those of pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The enhancement in the catalytic activity of heterostructure, S2, has been attributed to the synergistic interaction aided by the Z-scheme heterojunction formation between CoTiO3 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Also, the photocatalyst showed good photostability and recyclability with retaining the catalytic activity for five cycles of catalysis. Overall, in this work, the application of noble-metal-free photocatalyst for simultaneous production of H2 and value-added chemicals under environment-friendly conditions is reported, which can pave the way for the rational design of future photocatalytic systems."
