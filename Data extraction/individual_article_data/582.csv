0,Introduction,"Currently, the main technology to deal with NOx is selective catalytic reduction with NH3 (NH3-SCR) [1–4]. After the Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst reaches the end of its service life, it is discarded and a large amount of solid waste is generated [5]. Until 2017, more than 1.2 million cubic meters of SCR catalyst is in service. According to calculated, the average life of Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 is 3–5 years. It has reached the end of its using life since the deNOx project started in 2013. The following are two methods for treating abandoned Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst: (1) refining TiO2 and WO3; (2) landfill treatment. However, landfill is just wasting resources. It can't completely solve solid waste pollution at all. Refining TiO2 and WO3 is cumbersome and low economic return. Therefore, it is necessary to make rational use of the waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst. On the other hand, hydrogen energy has been widely regarded as an ideal non-polluting green energy [6]. To meet the huge demand for hydrogen energy, it is urgent to develop the technologies for production, transportation and storage of H2 [7–9]. Catalytic reforming to produce hydrogen is a promising way of mass production, compared to photocatalytic, electrochemical and biological [10,11]. There have been many researches focuses on the reforming of low molecular weight organic matter such as methane [12,13], formic acid [14], methanol [15,16], formaldehyde [17,18], ethyl alcohol [19,20] and acetic acid [21–23]. Ag, Pt and Au are considered as ideal catalysts due to their high selectivity, high catalytic activity and low carbon deposition [24–26]. However, their high price limits the practical application [27–30]. To solve the current predicament, a new resource utilization way of waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 deNOx catalysts for steam reforming reaction using different hydrogen resources was proposed. The waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst is calcined as ceramic carrier. Then the ceramic carrier is supported NiO (the cheaper substitute of noble metals) nanoparticles, and forms the fresh catalyst. Finally, steam reforming with different hydrogen resources were carried out so that the capability of waste deNOx supported NiO can be verified. Herein are the advantages of this idea: (1) CeO2 still has good redox capacity and can be used as an excellent additive after high temperature treatment [31–36]; (2) Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 cannot be placed in high water vapor for long time [37], so they are prepared into ceramics, which increases the strength; (3) TiO2 transforms into rutile phase at high temperature and has good performance [38]; (4) Compared with other methods, this kind of treatment is more reasonable and the return is higher. Under the guidance of such an idea, the waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst is calcined into a ceramic powder carrier and loaded with NiO to prepare the reforming hydrogen production catalyst. The obtained catalyst has good hydrogenation performance of steam reforming using methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, ethyl alcohol and acetic acid. In short, the solution can solve two problems at the same time: solid pollution of waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst and energy shortage."
1,Experiment,"Supporting Information (SI) provided the detail information about materials, chemicals, catalysis measurement and characterization. Fig. 1 represented the preparation of reforming hydrogen production catalyst."
2,Synthesis of waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst,2.1 Synthesis of waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 catalyst The mass percent of ceric oxide and tungsten trioxide were both 5 wt%. Ce(NO3)3 and (NH4)6H2W12O40 were added into citric acid solution and fully stirred until completely dissolved. Titanium dioxide was added to the cerium-tungsten acidic composite solution and stirred for 2 h. Then the catalyst was dried in oven by 12 h at 80 °C and calcined in muffle furnace by 2 h at 500 °C to form a monolithic catalyst (denoted as TCW).
3,Synthesis of ceramic carrier,"2.2 Synthesis of ceramic carrier Firstly, the TCW was ground into powder with the diameter of 106–125 μm. Secondly, aluminium hydroxide (5 wt%) and diatomite (5 wt%) were mixed and stirred with the catalyst powder. Then the polyvinyl alcohol solution was added in turn to the prepared powder for mixing so that the catalyst powder was formed into spherical particles with the diameter of 250–425 μm. Finally, the powder was calcined in muffle furnace by 2 h at 1000 °C to form the ceramic carrier."
4,Synthesis of reforming hydrogen production catalyst,"2.3 Synthesis of reforming hydrogen production catalyst The mass percent of NiO in the catalyst were designed as 4 wt%, 8 wt% and 12 wt%, respectively. The TCW ceramic powder was added into the solution of Ni(NO3)2, and fully stirred for 2 h. Then the powder was dried in oven by 12 h at 80 °C and calcined in muffle furnace by 2 h at 700 °C. The obtained catalysts were denoted as 4 N/TCW, 8 N/TCW and 12 N/TCW, respectively. Table 1 S showed the x-ray fluorescence results of different catalysts. It could be seen that the loading amount of NiO for 4 N/TCW, 8 N/TCW and 12 N/TCW were 4.25%, 8.67%, and 13.01%, respectively. The slight difference between the actual loading amount and the feed ratio may be because the ceramic sample prepared by the impregnation method was not very uniform."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance,"3.1 Catalytic performance The result of H2 selectivity was shown in Fig. 2 (a). It was seen that the TCW ceramic itself had a certain degree of catalytic activity for reforming hydrogen production. TCW showed the highest H2 selectivity of 90.1% at 550 °C. Although the H2 selectivity of 4 N/TCW was very similar with that of TCW, the optimum addition of NiO improved the selectivity obviously. 8 N/TCW showed 100% H2 selectivity at 450-600 °C while the H2 selectivity of TCW was only 67.7% at 450 °C (different value of 32.3%). The hydrogen selectivity decreased mildly when the loading of NiO increased to 12%. Furthermore, the temperatures at which the hydrogen selectivity reached the highest value over N/TCW decreased gradually with the increase of the loading amount of NiO，demonstrating that the active sites on the catalyst surface were adequately utilized. Namely, the distribution of NiO on the TCW carrier surface was uniform. In addition, the activation points (the temperature at which hydrogen selectivity begun to rise sharply) were 350–400 °C. It showed that the activity of NiO and CeO2 was substantially equivalent at 350-400 °C. In summary, TCW was adaptive as a carrier, and N/TCW showed superior catalytic performance for formaldehyde steam reforming. Carbon monoxide was a useful by-product and it would be generated by the decomposition of formaldehyde (Eq. (1)). Fig. 2(b) exhibited the carbon monoxide selectivity. The carbon monoxide selectivity of TCW increased linearly (43.7% at 600 °C) with the increase of reaction temperature. It indicated that formaldehyde was less likely to undergo a decomposition reaction directly on the surface of the TCW. Opposite to this, the carbon monoxide selectivity of N/TCW exhibited a parabolic trend with the increase of temperature. It can be seen that the temperatures at which the carbon monoxide selectivity reached the highest value decreased linearly with the increase of NiO amount. The temperatures of 4 N/TCW, 8 N/TCW and 12 N/TCW were 550 °C, 450 °C and 400 °C, respectively. Exceptionally, the NiO modification was beneficial to increase the carbon monoxide selectivity at low temperatures. 8 N/TCW exhibited the highest carbon monoxide selectivity of 86.2% at 450 °C. Furthermore, the carbon monoxide selectivity of all N/TCW catalysts increased explosively at 350-450 °C. It meant that N/TCW and the temperature could not provide enough energy to promote the direct decomposition of formaldehyde at 300-350 °C, and it mainly occurred at temperatures above 350 °C. (1) CH2O → CO + H2 Fig. 2(c) exhibited the carbon dioxide selectivity of different catalysts. Although temperatures at which the carbon dioxide selectivity reached the highest value also decreased with the addition of NiO, there was no obvious change for the carbon dioxide selectivity. It was well known that formaldehyde reacted with water to form CO2, and formaldehyde decomposed to form CO. That was to say, NiO just improved the selectivity of formaldehyde decomposition (CH2O → CO + H2), but had no obvious effect on formaldehyde steam reforming reaction (CH2O + H2O → CO2 + 2H2). This also explained why the significant increase in the hydrogen and carbon monoxide selectivity after the addition of NiO, while there was no obvious difference on carbon dioxide selectivity. Meanwhile, for all N/TCW catalysts, the temperature at which the carbon dioxide selectivity reached the highest value was higher than that of carbon monoxide selectivity. That was to say, the formaldehyde decomposition was the dominant portion at low temperature while the formaldehyde steam reforming reaction had the main effect at high temperature. Although TCW and N/TCW catalysts exhibited high hydrogen and carbon monoxide selectivity, the formaldehyde conversion was also a significant reference factor affecting their practical application. Therefore, the formaldehyde conversion of 8 N/TCW was obtained and the result was shown in Fig. 2(d). It was seen that 8 N/TCW also exhibited the high formaldehyde conversion. It reached 82.4% at 400 °C and higher than 96.0% at 450-600 °C. The result showed that formaldehyde could be easily converted by 8 N/TCW catalyst. At last, Fig. S1 showed the stability of 8 N/TCW catalyst. It could be seen that the H2 selectivity had no great change when 8 N/TCW catalyst was reused for five times or run for 50 h. The purpose of this work was to provide a new idea for solving the waste deNOx catalyst, so doing the research about the industrial catalyst had more practical meaning. However, waste industrial deNOx catalysts contained various pollutants, such as heavy metals, alkalis and etc. The industrial catalysts produced by different manufacturers and used under different working conditions would have different compositions. Therefore, if a single industrial catalyst was used directly for research, it was not fully representative. The catalytic mechanism was also difficult to analysis because of the diversity and complexity of industrial waste catalyst components. For the above reasons, we added the catalytic performance comparison of industrial catalyst and laboratory simulated waste catalysts. The reforming hydrogen production catalyst using waste industrial catalyst was denoted as 8 N/TCW-in. As shown in Fig. 3 , 8 N/TCW-in catalyst exhibited higher H2 and CO selectivity than 8 N/TCW at low temperature. There was no great change between the catalytic performance of 8 N/TCW-in and 8 N/TCW. In other words, the waste industrial catalyst had superior catalytic performance, which may be because trace elements in the waste industrial catalyst have a certain promoting effect. Meanwhile, it was planned to carry out multi-factor impact research on waste industrial deNOx catalysts in the later stage. In order to verify the universality of 8 N/TCW catalyst, different hydrogen sources were used for the steam reforming reaction (Fig. 4 ). The comparison of catalytic performance with different hydrogen sources and catalysts was also shown in Table 1. Compared with formaldehyde, methanol and formic acid, it could be found that the formic acid was easiest to be catalyzed, and it reached 58.3% H2 selectivity and 75.5% CO selectivity at 350 °C. The formaldehyde was more likely to be reformed to produce hydrogen when the temperature continued to rise. It reached 103.1% H2 selectivity and 86.2% CO selectivity at 450 °C. In other words, the order of difficulty in reforming hydrogen production was methanol > formaldehyde > formic acid. This may be because the catalyst will first oxidize these three hydrogen sources to form formic acid, and then dehydrogenate to form H2 and CO (or CO2). Meanwhile, there was no CO double bond in methanol, so the reaction was not easy among the three hydrogen sources. The reaction process would be explained in the next section. Similar with the results of formaldehyde, methanol and formic acid, acetic acid was also easier to be catalyzed than ethyl alcohol. For acetic acid, the H2 and CO selectivity could reach 103.8% and 50.9%, respectively when the reaction temperature was 550 °C. Opposite to this, ethyl alcohol only reached 74.7% H2 selectivity at 600 °C. Although the temperature required for hydrogen production was relatively high, since the molecule contained more hydrogen atoms, the hydrogen production rate by methanol and ethanol was higher than other hydrogen sources in the case where the reaction conditions were the same. Considering various factors, formaldehyde was the most excellent hydrogen source. It required the lowest temperature (500 °C) when the hydrogen selectivity reached the highest value (104.5%). The hydrogen production rate (13.1 L min−1) was also only slightly lower than ethanol. In addition, the hydrogen selectivity exceeds 100%, indicating that hydrogen atoms in the water were also converted to hydrogen. Furthermore, the formaldehyde was a gas pollutant, and formaldehyde reforming hydrogen production technology can not only solve energy problems, but also solve air pollution problems. At last, to compare with the performance of reported catalysts, the details of these catalysts were shown Table 1. It was verified that 8 N/TCW also had advantages regardless of the stable time and H2 selectivity."
7,Physical structure and chemical properties,"3.2 Physical structure and chemical properties Fig. 5 (a) and Fig. 5(b) exhibited the scanning electron microscope graphs of TCW carrier. TCW was composed of submicron sponges and a small amount of spherical particles. The middle of the sponge is thin and the two ends are thick, so that the diameter of sponge was 250–800 nm and the diameter of small spherical particle was 100–200 nm. In addition, the smooth surface of submicron sponge verified that waste TCW catalyst has transformed to ceramics powder after the calcination at 1000 °C. However, TCW did not transform to ceramics powder completely because the small spherical particles and micron-sized channels between sponges still remained. In practical use, the structure of TCW carrier could remain unchanged in the presence of water vapor. In other words, calcination at 1000 °C was enough to convert the waste TCW catalyst into ceramic, which not only improved the physical strength but also ensured its water absorption performance. Meanwhile, Fig. S2 showed the distribution of different elements for TCW carrier. It was found that there were O, Ce, W and Ti elements but no Al or Si for TCW carrier, which speculated that Al2O3 and SiO2 have entered the interior of TCW ceramic grain. It was also verified that O, Ce, W and Ti elements distributed homogeneously in the TCW carrier. Fig. 5(c) and (d) exhibited the scanning electron microscope graphs of 8 N/TCW catalyst. The microstructure of 8 N/TCW was different with that of TCW obviously. With the loading of NiO, the submicron sponge has gradually formed cuboid block and the diameter increased to 400-800 nm. This was because the particles grew again. Meanwhile, the interaction between TCW and NiO guaranteed that the CeO2 and WO3 of TCW carrier could be used as the cocatalyst. Furthermore, Fig. S3 showed the distribution of different elements for 8 N/TCW. It was found that there were W, O, Ce, Ni and Ti elements but no Al or Si for 8 N/TCW, which also speculated that Al2O3 and SiO2 have entered the interior of 8 N/TCW. It was also verified that W, O, Ce, Ni and Ti elements distributed homogeneously in the 8 N/TCW. Finally, two used 8 N/TCW catalysts were chosen for the SEM test to confirm its stability: one was used for 20 h, and another one was used for 50 h. From Fig. S4, the morphology of the catalyst changed after 20 h of reaction. The particle diameter became smaller, probably because of the long time treatment at high temperature. Carbon deposits grew on the catalyst surface so that the grain boundaries became blurred. However, the morphology of 8 N/TCW, which was used for 50 h, was similar with that of catalyst used for 20 h. It indicated that the morphology of 8 N/TCW has been stabilized after the treatment in the reaction atmosphere for a long time. In other words, the morphology and performance of the catalyst would gradually stabilize after a certain period of reaction. That was also the reason why its catalytic performance became significantly better in the three times of recycling. Fig. 6 (a) exhibited x-ray diffraction spectra of TCW and 8 N/TCW. All the reflections corresponded to the rutile TiO2 (PDF-ICDD 78-1509), anatase TiO2 (PDF-ICDD 83-2243), CeO2 (PDF-ICDD 78-694), NiO (PDF-ICDD 73-1519), NiTiO3 (PDF-ICDD 76-334) and SiO2 (PDF-ICDD 77-1316). TCW and 8 N/TCW catalysts contained both rutile and anatase TiO2. Soliman et al. found that the concentration of localized electronic defect states over rutile TiO2 was higher than that over anatase TiO2, which was not conducive to the improvement of catalytic activity [43]. Furthermore, Ni element existed as NiTiO3 for 8 N/TCW catalyst. In the scanning electron microscope graphs of 8 N/TCW, NiO reacted with TCW and formed the cuboid block. Meanwhile, the presence of peaks attributed to CeO2 was due to the high loading amount. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of TCW and 8 N/TCW separated at the medium sized relative pressure (Fig. 6(b)). It corresponded to the adsorption curve of Langmuir III. Both the hysteresis loop belonged to H4-type, which verified that there was mesopores (3-12 nm, Fig. S5) in the TCW and 8 N/TCW catalysts. The relative separation pressure decreased after the addition of NiO. In other words, the addition of NiO would cause the increase of the average pore size. Table 2 showed the specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of TCW and 8 N/TCW. It could be seen than there was no great change between the surface area of TCW (2.77 m2 g−1) and 8 N/TCW (3.41 m2 g−1), indicating that addition of NiO would not cause the decrease of adsorption capacity. The surface acidity was very significant to guarantee the catalytic performance for various catalytic reactions [44–46]. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) exhibited the NH3-TPD profiles and acid quantity of TCW and 8 N/TCW catalysts. All of the ammonia desorption of the catalysts displayed three distinct regions: one peak spanned at 50-200 °C corresponded to the weak acid site; the peak spanned at 200-700 °C was ascribed to the medium acid site; the other peak spanned at 700-900 °C was attributed to the strong acid site. The total area of three distinct regions over 8 N/TCW was larger than that over TCW, indicating that the acid quantity increased with the addition of NiO. To compare the redox properties and H2 consumption of TCW and 8 N/TCW, the H2-TPR was conducted on these two samples and the results were shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). As well known, NiO had excellent redox properties while the redox properties of TCW decreased greatly after high temperature calcination. On the other hand, H2-TPR profile was obtained by the temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen, and the sample with 0.500g was used for the test each time. Therefore, if we want to investigate the interaction between NiO and TCW, the hydrogen consumption of 8% NiO, TCW and 8%NiO/TCW need to be compared at the same level. Meanwhile, from Fig. S6, NaF did not have redox properties. Therefore, the 8% NiO/NaF (prepared by mechanical stirring) was used to replace pure NiO and compare with TCW and 8 N/TCW catalysts so that they could be compared at the same level. The peak of NiO spanned at 300-420 °C corresponded to the reduction of Ni2+-O. TCW has transformed to ceramic powder so that it was difficult to react with hydrogen atmosphere. That was why there was no peak for the reduction of Ce4+→Ce3+ [47,48]. Although TCW only showed an obvious broad peak at 717 °C, it may be the result of the overlapping of the W6+ and Ti4+ reduction peaks. There were three peaks for 8 N/TCW: the broad peak located at 470 °C corresponded to the reduction of Ni2+; the peak at medium temperature was attributed to the reduction of Ce4+ →Ce3+ and the last peak around 675 °C was attributed to the reduction of Ti4+ →Ti3+. The reduction temperature of NiO increased while the amount of H2 consumption decreased with the addition of NiO. However, the ceramic CeO2 recovered to be reduced. That was to say, there was a strong interaction between TCW ceramic carrier and active component (NiO), which promoted the more difficult reduction of NiO and the easier reduction of CeO2. From Fig. 7(d), the H2 consumption of NiO and TCW was at the same level while the oxygen storage capacity of 8 N/TCW (29.16 cm3 g−1 STP) was much higher than pure NiO or TCW. This was beneficial for the reaction molecules adsorbed at low temperature to be more easily activated on the surface of the catalyst and participate in the reaction. That was why 8 N/TCW exhibited higher H2 selectivity than TCW."
8,Surface active species,"3.3 Surface active species The detailed chemical states of Ti, O, W, Ce and Ni atoms on the surface of fresh and used catalysts were tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results were shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S7. Table 3 showed the atomic distribution of TCW and 8 N/TCW catalysts. According to Fig. 8(a), the spectra of Ti 2p corresponded to Ti3+ and Ti4+ [49]. For Ti 2p, 8 N/TCW had a transition to lower binding energy and its intensity was reduced. This was due to the decrease of the Ti amount after the addition of NiO and the strong interaction between Ni and Ti atoms. On the other hand, the intensity of the used 8 N/TCW catalyst decreased slightly and it shifted to higher binding energy after using for 50 h. It was because carbon was deposited on the used catalyst surface, and the H2 treatment changed the chemical environment of the atoms on the catalyst surface. In addition, the atomic ratios of Ti3+ increased after the modification of NiO (Table 3). The interaction between carrier and active component led to the generation of oxygen vacancies. From Fig. 8(b), the O 1s of TCW corresponded to the chemisorbed oxygen (Oα) and lattice oxygen (Oβ) [50]. Obviously, a new peak corresponding to surface oxygen by hydroxyl species (Oγ) appeared after the loading of NiO [51]. There was little amount of adsorbed hydroxyl species on the TCW carrier because it was ceramic material. Opposite to this, NiO was uniformly loaded on the surface of the TCW and was not sintered as ceramic at 700 °C so that there was a large amount of adsorbed hydroxyl species. In summary, Oγ was mainly provided by the active component NiO. According to previous literature, hydroxyl species was the most active oxygen and had the obvious effect to promote the catalytic reaction [52]. Therefore, a significant increase in the ratio of Oα+Oγ was advantageous for enhancing the catalytic performance. For the used 8 N/TCW catalyst, the ratio of Oα+Oγ increased obviously after using for 50 h. It was because Ce4+ and Ni2+ on the catalyst surface were reduced to a lower state, resulting in the consumption of lattice oxygen. Meanwhile, the separation peaks of O 1s for TCW shifted slightly toward the lower binding energy with the addition of NiO. It verified that there was strong interaction among Ni and Ti atoms, which promoted the electron transmission. This was beneficial for the reaction molecules adsorbed at low temperature to be more easily activated on the surface of the catalyst and participate in the steam reforming catalytic reaction. Fig. 8(c) exhibited the W 4f XPS spectra of TCW and N/TCW catalysts. The two peaks were ascribed to W6+ [53,54]. It was found that the separation peaks of W 4f for TCW shifted slightly toward the lower binding energy with the addition of NiO. It was also verified the strong interactions among different atoms. Fig. 8(d) exhibited Ce 3d spectra of TCW and 8 N/TCW catalysts. All the spectral peaks corresponded to Ce4+ and Ce3+ [55]. Obviously, the peak intensity of Ce 3d decreased as TCW > 8 N/TCW > used 8 N/TCW, indicating a decrease in the Ce amount on the catalyst surface. The Ce3+ atomic ratios of TCW catalyst surface was 0.447 while that of 8 N/TCW was only 0.037. It indicated that the loading of NiO and the secondary calcination of catalyst caused the transformation of Ce3+ → Ce4+. This transformation would increase the amount of oxygen species, which was also verified in the result of O 1s spectra. On the other hand, the Ce3+ atomic ratio of used 8 N/TCW catalyst was much higher than that of 8 N/TCW. It was because there was H2 in the reaction system, and the H2 treatment reduced Ce4+ to Ce3+ and consumed the lattice oxygen of catalyst surface. The representative Ni 2p spectra of fresh 8 N/TCW were showed in Fig. S7, and it was divided into Ni2+ and satellite [56]. The additional peak located at 882.2 eV for 8 N/TCW catalyst was attributed to Ce 3d because the part of peaks of Ce 3d and Ni 2p were overlapping. There was no peak ascribed to Ni0 so that Ni species only existed as NiO. On the other hand, the intensity of the used 8 N/TCW catalyst decreased slightly and it shifted to higher binding energy after using for 50 h. A new peak attributed to Ni0 also appeared. It was because carbon was deposited on the used catalyst surface, and the part Ni2+ transformed to Ni0 after the H2 treatment."
9,Reaction mechanism study,"3.4 Reaction mechanism study In situ infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to investigate the reforming hydrogen production reaction mechanism over NiO, TCW and 8 N/TCW catalysts (Fig. 9 and Fig. S8). Table 4 exhibited the representative species of each peak. Four species were generated after the adsorption of formaldehyde: adsorbed di-oxymethylene; dissociated formate adsorption species (HCOOad); formate adsorption species that linked to the hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface by hydrogen bond (HCOOHad); and COx species [41,57,58]. The band at 2928 cm−1 was assigned to the characteristic peak of di-oxymethylene. The bands at 2881 cm−1 and 2826 cm−1 represented the v (CH) in HCOOad [59]. The bands around 2380-2300 cm−1 represented COx [60]. The band at 1714 cm−1 represented the v (CO) in HCOOHad [61]. The band at 1557 cm−1 represented ν as (COO) in HCOOad of formate [62]. According to Fig. 9(a) and (b), the intensity of COx and HCOOad increased and that of di-oxymethylene decreased with the time at 300 °C. It was indicated that the adsorbed formaldehyde converted to di-oxymethylene firstly, then transformed to formate, and finally dehydrogenated to form H2 and CO. There was no band attributed to HCOOHad while it appeared obviously at 450 °C. The intensity of bands also increased obviously when the reaction temperature rose. The possibility of formic acid species production improved at high temperature. Therefore, TCW exhibited very low H2 selectivity at 300 °C, and the catalytic selectivity increased significantly at 450 °C. Furthermore, from Fig. 9(c), the intensity of COx species decreased while there was no great change for the intensity of formate species after N2 purging. This may be because water molecules were an indispensable component of the formic acid dehydrogenation reaction, so the adsorbed formate species could not be converted to hydrogen while the COx species were gradually desorbed in the case of only nitrogen purge. As shown in Fig. 9(d) and (e), the band intensity of HCOOad was lower than that of HCOOHad. Meanwhile, the concentration of hydroxyl and chemisorbed oxygen improved with the modification of NiO, and the formate species tended to link with hydroxyl by hydrogen bond. That was to say, the hydroxyl and chemisorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface begun to dominate in the catalytic reaction. In addition, the band intensity at 450 °C was obviously higher than that at 300 °C, which indicated that the formate species was easier to generate at high temperature. The band intensity of COx species decreased while there was no great change for the intensity of formate species after N2 purging (Fig. 9(f)). According to Fig. S8, it was found that the peak position of the species adsorbed on the surface of pure NiO was consistent with that of TCW and 8 N/TCW. That was to say, the TCW carrier did not change the catalytic path of NiO. At the same time, the peak intensity of the species on the pure NiO surface was lower than that of TCW and 8 N/TCW, indicating that the TCW carrier enhanced the catalytic ability of NiO. Generally, HCOOHad was more active than HCOOad in the steam reforming reaction, and the hydrogen bond played a significant role in the reaction. Combined with the above analysis, Fig. 10 showed the mechanism of formaldehyde steam reforming reaction. Two types of reaction processes was proposed: (1) CH2O adsorbed on the TCW or N/TCW surface firstly so that the CH2O(ads) generated. CH2O(ads) reacted with hydroxyl group, and hydrogen generated by dehydrogenation. Then water molecular reacted with the intermediate so that the hydrogen generated again. At last, hydroxyl group and carbon dioxide generated through the decomposition of the intermediate. (2) CH2O adsorbed on the TCW or N/TCW surface firstly so that the CH2O(ads) generated. CH2O(ads) linked with hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface by hydrogen bond. Then water molecular reacted with the intermediate. Next, hydrogen generated through the dehydrogenation of the intermediate. At last, hydroxyl group, water molecular and carbon monoxide generated through the decomposition of the intermediate. The reaction intermediate of formic acid as formaldehyde has been verified in the in situ diffuse reflection infrared spectra and the easiest reaction molecular among various hydrogen sources. However, no matter which type of reaction process, the richness of hydroxyl group determined the reaction rate and selectivity, which was verified by the results of in situ diffuse ref lection infrared spectra and XPS. Furthermore, water molecules must participate in the two types of reaction processes for the steam reforming reaction and the hydrogen bond accelerate the reaction by reducing reaction steps."
10,Conclusions,"A new resource path of waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 deNOx catalysts for steam reforming reaction was verified. Different hydrogen resources were used and compared for hydrogen production by steam reforming reaction. The structure of TCW ceramic carrier was submicron sponge while that of NiO was nanoparticle. The strong interaction between active component (NiO nanoparticle) and TCW carrier promoted the catalytic reaction. 8 N/TCW, the optimum sample, exhibited 104.5% H2 selectivity at 500 °C and high H2 production rate (13.1 L min−1). Its formaldehyde conversion reached 82.4% at 400 °C and higher than 96.0% at the range of 450–600 °C. Results showed that the richness of hydroxyl group determined the reaction rate and selectivity. The enhancement of surface acid quantity and redox properties could improve the catalytic selectivity and activity. According to the in situ DRIFT study, the adsorbed formaldehyde species firstly converted to di-oxymethylene, then transformed to formate, species. Finally, the H2 and CO2 generated by the dehydrogenation of intermediate. Water molecules must participate in the two types of reaction processes for the steam reforming reaction and the hydrogen bond accelerate the reaction by reducing reaction steps. Herein it was verified that the waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 deNOx catalyst could be used as the carrier and the prepared catalyst exhibited high hydrogen selectivity from various resources. All of these factors guaranteed that the waste Ce–W-Ox/TiO2 carrier was suitable for practical application."
