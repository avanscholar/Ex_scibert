0,Introduction,"The energy crisis and environmental pollution caused by carbon-based fuels have attracted immense attention [1], which are detrimental to the ecosystem [2]. The development of renewable and eco-friendly energy sources that can replace traditional non-renewable sources has gained significant academic and industrial attention. Owing to its high energy density of 143 kJ g−1, H2 is considered as a promising clean energy source [3]. Moreover, it does not produce any secondary pollution. There are three main strategies to produce H2: H2 evolution from fossil fuels, biofuels, and water splitting [4]. Currently, H2 evolution from fossil fuels is the most popular approach, which includes methane reforming, natural gas pyrolysis, coal vaporization, and heavy oil partial oxidation. Methane reforming is a widely used technique for H2 evolution and is cost-effective. However, it consumes a large amount of energy, and the reaction progresses as follows: (1) CH 4 + H 2 O → 3 H 2 + CO Δ H 298 0 = 206 k J / m o l (2) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 0 = - 41 k J / m o l Moreover, finally produced CO2 may cause greenhouse effect, resulting environmental problems [5]. Biological H2 evolution involves the pyrolysis or gasification of biomass, fermentation of organic matter, photosynthetic bacteria breakage of organic matter, etc. [6,7]. The process is renewable and has very little harmful impact on the environment. These characteristics make this process suitable for civilian use. However, large-scale H2 production using this approach is costly. H2 production from water splitting is an eco-friendly approach, which utilizes wastewater as the source. Depending upon the resource used, the processes of water splitting can be classified as photochemical, thermochemical, and electrochemical [8]. Since the first report of H2 evolution on TiO2 single crystal electrodes using photoelectrochemistry in 1972 [9], photochemical H2 evolution from water splitting has been a constant hot spot both for academic and industrial interests. Depending upon the reaction mechanism, photochemical H2 evolution can be classified into two main processes: photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 evolution. Along with light irradiation, the photoelectrocatalytic method uses photocatalysts as electrodes, which require an additional bias voltage to suppress the recombination of the photogenerated carriers. Photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution is widely used owing to its high efficiency. However, it requires additional energy, and hence will not be discussed in detail in this review. On the contrary, photocatalysis directly uses the abundant solar energy to split water into H2 through a four-electron or two-electron process, which can effectively avoid environmental pollution and the consumption of extra energy. It is the simplest route for water splitting and provides low-cost and large-scale H2 production. The recent publication trend of the reports focusing on the photocatalytic generation of H2 is shown in Fig. 1 . It can be clearly observed that the number of studies focusing on the development of photocatalysts without noble metals (denoted as non-noble metal photocatalysts) has increased significantly over the past few years. However, they are still less in number than those on the photocatalysts containing noble metals (named as noble-metal photocatalysts). Noble metals may work generally as the effective redox co-catalysts due to their excellent physicochemical properties, electrical properties and high catalytic activities [10,11]. Nevertheless, noble-metal photocatalysts are costly because of the low abundance of the noble metals present in them, and hence find limited practical applications in water splitting. On the other hand, non-noble-metal photocatalysts are promising candidates for water splitting because of their low cost and good efficiency. In addition, non-noble metal photocatalysts exhibit good stability, and hence do not suffer from deactivation under specific conditions unlike Pt-based photocatalysts (noble-metal photocatalysts), which suffer from Pt deactivation in the presence of halide ions. This makes non-noble metal photocatalysts suitable for the conversion of wastewater to H2. However, despite the above merits, very few reviews are available on the photocatalytic generation of H2 using non-noble metal photocatalysts. In addition, the strategy for improving the H2 production efficiency of non-noble metal photocatalysts needs to be investigated systematically. This review mainly focuses on photocatalytic water splitting H2 production, and pay intense attention to the latest advances in H2 production on non-noble metal photocatalysts such as metal oxides (TiO2, etc.), metal sulfides (CdS, etc), metal phosphides (NiP, etc.), and metal-free materials (g-C3N4, etc.). The strategies used for controlling and enhancing the efficiency of photocatalytic H2 production are discussed. Finally, the current and future challenges in the production of H2 on non-noble metal photocatalysts as well as the outlooks for their potential applications are described. This review provides an insight into the design of high-efficient and inexpensive photocatalysts for solar energy utilization and will create a pathway for the potential conversion of waste into H2."
1,Fundamentals of photocatalytic H2 production,"It is reported that all the lanthanides and other elements in the s, p, and d regions of the periodic table can be used to produce H2 [12]. The process of photocatalytic H2 evolution can be divided into three successive stages: (1) the electrons in the valence band (VB) are excited and transmitted to the conduction band (CB) when the semiconductor absorbs high-energy photons greater than the bandgap, simultaneously generating holes in the VB; (2) the induced electron-hole pairs separate and transfer to the surface of the material; (3) the electrons in the CB reduce the adsorbed H+ to H2 and the holes in the VB oxidize water into oxygen. However, a prerequisite must be met for H2 production according to the following redox reactions [8]: (3) Oxidation: 2 H 2 O → O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − E 0 = 1.23 e V (4) Reduction: 2 H + + 2 e - →H 2 E 0 = 0.00 e V (5) Overall: 2 H 2 O → O 2 + 2 H 2 E 0 = − 1.23 e V Under the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE), the CB energy level should be lower than 0 V (E(H+/H2)) for the occurrence of the H2 evolution reaction (HER). In addition, the VB energy level should be higher than 1.23 V (E(O2/H2O)) for the occurrence of the reduction reaction of H2O [13]. H2 generation on non-noble metal photocatalysts is mainly restricted by their poor visible light response, fast recombination of the photogenerated carriers, low surface reaction rate, and high thermodynamic potential barriers. Various approaches such as energy band engineering, heterojunction construction [14], and reactive activity enhancement [15] have been used to overcome the above limitations. Immobilizing the co-catalyst on semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising approach to overcome the above mentioned limitations. Co-catalysts are classified as metallic, non-metallic, and semiconducting according to the category of material. Metallic co-catalysts can further be classified into precious metal and non-noble (base) metal catalysts depending upon the cost of the metal [5]. Over the past few decades, noble metals such as Ru [16], Rh [17], Pd [18], Ag [19], Pt [20], and Au [21] have been widely used as efficient co-catalysts for H2 production. The addition of precious metal co-catalysts can vividly augment the activity of the photocatalyst. However, the use of noble-metal co-catalysts is not suitable for large-scale applications because of the high cost involved and limited storage. Therefore, the development of high-performance photocatalysts containing non-precious metals is an effective approach for sustainable and large-scale production of H2 from water splitting. The non-noble-metal photocatalysts for H2 production in this review are summarized in Table 1 ."
2,Non-precious metal photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution,"In this review, we have discussed various non-noble-metal photocatalysts such as metal oxides (TiO2, etc.), metal sulfides (CdS, etc.), metal phosphides (NiP, etc.), and metal-free catalysts (g-C3N4, etc.). Diverse methods such as elemental doping, constructing heterojunctions, and enhancing the reactivity all can be used to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic H2 production [65,66]. The general route for boosting the activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution is shown in modification Scheme 1 ."
3,Metal oxide-based photocatalysts,"3.1 Metal oxide-based photocatalysts Metal oxide semiconductors have become the most sought-after photocatalysts since the discovery of the photoelectrocatalytic generation of H2 on anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) in 1972 [9]. Apart from TiO2, other metal oxide semiconductors (including ZnO are used as high efficiency photocatalysts without noble metals. 3.1.1 TiO2 As an n-type semiconductor material, TiO2 has good chemical stability, biological inertness, good thermal stability, and non-toxicity. It crystallizes in three common crystal structures: anatase, rutile, and brookite. Anatase TiO2 is the most widely used photocatalyst owing to its high efficiency and stability. However, it has a wide bandgap (3.2 eV), leading to limited visible light absorption and solar energy utilization. The fast recombination of photogenerated carriers is another disadvantage of anatase TiO2, which limits its hydrogen yield [67]. Structural and morphological control is used to increase the light absorption and charge separation/transmission of TiO2 photocatalysts. It can also increase the surface area and produce new active sites, thus improving their performance and stability. TiO2 photocatalysts with diverse morphologies such as nanosphere (0-D) [68], nanowire or nanotube (1-D) [69], and nanosheet (2-D) [70] have been developed (Fig. 2 ). In addition, dye sensitization is another way to increase the efficiency of H2 production since it can broaden the light absorption. Table 2 summarizes the photocatalytic H2 evolution on TiO2 by structural and morphological control as well as dye sensitization. Elemental doping is another strategy to tune the H2 generation rate of TiO2. Taherinia et al. [22] successfully incorporated N and S atoms into TiO2 adopting a sol-gel method. The ultraviolet–visible spectra of the catalysts revealed that the S-doped TiO2 sample exhibited a narrower bandgap than the N-doped one, and hence improved visible light absorption although the catalytic activity is influenced by the presence of sulfur ions. Moreover, the photocatalytic efficiency of N-doped TiO2 grew with an augment in the number of N atoms. The highest H2 yield was obtained at the N-doping amount of 6 wt% [22]. Jia et al. synthesized a hierarchical structure of highly carbon-doped TiO2 (HC–TiO2) by low-temperature stripping of the MXene supernatant [23]. The resulting HC-TiO2 showed a flower-like morphology with tightly packed petals. The improved photocurrent on HC-TiO2 can be attributed to the increased lifetime of its carriers, which in turn improved its H2 production efficiency. The H2 generation rate on HC-TiO2 was 8.9 times greater than that upon P25. It was found that a valence band tail was induced at high carbon contents, which narrowed the bandgap and enhanced the utilization of light for the HER [23]. Additionally, Niu et al. theoretically investigated I and N co-doped TiO2 by density functional theory (DFT) and proposed the chemical reaction pathways of water splitting through the climbing nudged elastic band (cNEB) method [24]. They pointed out that I and N co-doping could not only restrain the recombination of the photogenerated carriers but also reduce the bandgap of TiO2 [24]. Apart from binary non-metal elemental doping, binary metal-element Fe, Ni [25] co-catalysts have also been applied to boost the productivity of H2 production on TiO2. Metal/non-metal doping can tune the energy band configuration of TiO2, thus improving the light utilization and electron transport. In addition, a synergetic effect may be induced by multi-elemental doping, which may further improve the photocatalytic behavior of TiO2. Elemental doping mixed with metal and non-metal has also been used to improve the H2 production efficiency of TiO2. Xiao et al. co-doped TiO2 nanocrystals with Ti3+ and P5+ using a shape-controlled reagent-free method. The as-obtained product showed an ultra-high H2 generation efficiency of 724 μmol h−1 g−1 [26]. The mixed doping approach induced a synergetic effect of metal and metalloid (non-metal), which improved the activity on TiO2. Constructing heterojunctions is another effective approach to tune the photocatalytic behavior of TiO2 by adjusting the light absorption and facilitating the charge separation/transfer at the interface. Coupling TiO2 with co-catalysts including oxides, sulfides, and others has also been carried out [88–91]. Fujita et al. fabricated NiO/TiO2 catalysts with high H2 production efficiency by adding NiO/TiO2 to an aqueous solution of glycerin [27]. The addition of NiO could reduce the bandgap of TiO2 and improve its photocatalytic activity without changing its structure and surface area. The highest H2 production was achieved at the NiO content of 2 wt% [27]. Li et al. synthesized titanate nanotubes (TNTs) with tunable pore sizes and successfully incorporated CdS into the tubes by a simple ion-synthesis method. The incorporation of CdS induced a synergistic effect, which significantly improved the H2 evolution efficiency of TiO2. The CdS/TiO2 composites showed a maximum apparent quantum efficiency of 43.3% under visible light [28]. Moreover, Chen et al. successfully loaded CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto the TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) through successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method [29]. Enhanced and tunable performance for photocatalytic H2 generation was observed, and the maximum activity of H2 production was 1.89 μmol h−1 cm−2 when TNTAs were deposited with CdS QDs for 15 cycles. Fig. 3 shows the schematic diagram for the fabrication of CdS/TNTAs and the corresponding transport route of photogenerated carriers. Han et al. loaded few-layered 1 T-MoS2 onto TiO2 (001) nanosheets to produce a photocatalyst with reduced charge recombination and improved durability, resulting in increased photocatalytic activity of 31.9% comparing with pure TiO2 (001) [30]. Huang et al. immobilized NiS on TNTS using a hot solvent method and the obtained H2 yield was 7486 μmol h−1 g−1 at the 8 wt% NiS loaded sample, which is 79 times greater than that from single TNTs [31]. Paramasivan et al. investigated the H2 generation on metal-loaded TiO2 through introducing Cu, Pb, Sn, and Zn metal particles into a TiO2 aqueous methanol solution [32]. It was found that only the copper-loaded sample could produce H2, and its activity was about 68 times greater than that of pristine TiO2. 3.1.2 Zinc oxide (ZnO) In the 1930s, ZnO was mainly used in the rubber and paper industries [92]. With the modification of ZnO using semiconductors, its applications extended to photocatalysis. Owing to its strong charge transport capability, direct bandgap, easy crystallization, and anisotropic growth, ZnO is considered as one of the potential photocatalysts for H2 production. The electron mobility of bulk ZnO is about 100 cm2·v−1·s−1, which is 10 times larger than that upon TiO2 [93,94]. This indicates that the photogenerated carriers in ZnO can easily migrate to its surface, thus improving its photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, ZnO suffers from poor solar light utilization, poor chemical stability, and a high photo-generated carrier recombination rate. Modification with highly efficient co-catalysts is an effective approach to adjust its photocatalytic H2 generation yield. Elemental doping is another efficient route to boost the photocatalytic behavior of ZnO for H2 generation. Various non-metallic (C, N, S, etc.), alkali metal (Li, Na, K, etc.), and transition metal (Cr, Mn, Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, etc.) elements have been used as dopants for ZnO [95]. Hsu and co-workers designed hierarchical S-doped ZnO photocatalysts for the HER and found that this special structure showed the high surface area and light trapping ability comparable to those ZnO nanorods. S-doped ZnO showed high stability even after five cycles, and the maximum H2 generation yield was 3640 μmol g−1 h−1 [33]. Huo et al. prepared yttrium (Y) and aluminum (Al) co-doped ZnO (Y-AZO) through a sol-gel method. They found that 5%Y-AZO showed the best H2 generation performance and an extremely high H2 generation yield of 5.71 mmol h−1 g−1 [34]. The introduction of additional components on ZnO to construct heterojunctions is a prominent approach to enhance its photocatalytic H2 yield. Wang et al. fabricated core-shell g-C3N4/ZnO (CN/OD-ZnO) heterojunctions by coupling g-C3N4 nanosheets with oxygen-deficient ZnO nanorods (OD-ZnO) and proposed the Z-scheme mechanism of electron transport in the photocatalysts [35]. As shown from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results, the composite photocatalyst with 10 wt% g-C3N4 (CN-10/OD-ZnO) had the smallest diameter i.e., the lowest electron-transfer resistance (Ret). On the other hand, pure g-C3N4 showed the largest diameter i.e., the highest Ret. The heterojunctions significantly improved the electroconductivity of the ZnO, as shown in Fig. 4 A. EIS is generally used to analyze the photocurrent response of a material. Accordingly, CN-10/OD-ZnO demonstrated the maximum photocurrent response, which was nearly eight folds greater than that upon g-C3N4 (Fig. 4B), due to its minimum Ret. Among the three characteristic heterostructures shown in Fig. 4C, the Z-scheme showed highly improved separation of the photogenerated carriers and the highest charge lifetimes, and hence the highest H2 yield [35]. Yuan et al. synthesized a new MoS2 nanosheet-coated ZnO heterojunction using a hydrothermal method [36]. They found that 1 wt% MoS2/ZnO had the maximum H2 generation rate of 768 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 14.8 times greater than that on single ZnO. It may be mentioned that the HER photocatalytic activity of MoS2 is greater than those on precious metals including Pt or Au, demonstrating its potential to replace noble-metal co-catalysts. Ma et al. prepared a new CdS/ZnO heterostructure by combining 0-D CdS quantum dots (QDs) with 2-D ZnO nanosheets (NSs) [37]. CdS/ZnO-12 (12 is the deposition number of the CdS QDs) showed the maximum H2 generation yield about 22.12 mmol h−1 g−1, which is 138 folds greater than that upon ZnO (0.16 mmol g−1 h−1). 3.1.3 Other metal oxides In addition, other metal oxides such as CuO, Fe2O3, and In2O3 have also been used for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Yanalak et al. [38] designed a series of metal oxide nanofibers (NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4) for high-efficiency H2 generation by using eosin-y (EY) as the photosensitizer and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the electron donor. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed that the NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 nanofibers had diameters of 156 ± 10, 240 ± 10, and 140 ± 10 nm, respectively. The addition of the EY and TEOA co-catalysts improved the electron transfer of the nanofibers. The photocatalytic H2 generation yield upon the NiO, Co3O4, Mn3O4 composite photocatalysts was 7757, 5552, 196 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The efficiency of the photocatalysts increased in the following order: Mn3O4 < Co3O4 < NiO. The H2 evolution efficiencies of NiO, Co3O4, Mn3O4 nanofibers photocatalysts were higher than those of their bulk counterparts."
4,Metal sulfide-based photocatalysts,"3.2 Metal sulfide-based photocatalysts Metal sulfides are well-known photocatalysts for H2 generation through water splitting. Metal sulfides are suitable for water reduction and exhibit better light response than oxides owing to their relatively high CB positions [96]. CdS (Eg = 2.4 eV) and ZnS (Eg = 3.6 eV) are the most investigated metal sulfide-based photocatalysts. However, metal sulfides photocatalysts suffer from photocorrosion, which may cause low stability. Strategies such as elemental doping and heterojunction construction have been used to improve their photocatalytic H2 production efficiency. 3.2.1 Cadmium sulfide (CdS) CdS shows two crystal phases: hexagonal wurtzite and cubic sphalerite. The CB and VB positions of CdS are −0.52 and 1.88 eV, respectively. The CB position of CdS is more negative than the H+/H2 potential, while the VB position is more positive than the O2/H2O potential. Hence, CdS shows a large potential for H2 evolution through water splitting. However, CdS photocatalysts suffer from two major disadvantages. They are highly susceptible to irreversible photocorrosion under irradiation, which seriously deteriorates their stability and limits their photocatalytic activity. The process of photocorrosion occurs as follows: (6) C d S + h v → e − + h + (7) 2 h + + C d S → C d 2 + + S The other disadvantage is that they are deficient in active sites and exhibit low quantum efficiencies owing to the rapid recombination of photoinduced charges. Various co-catalysts were studied to adjust the H2 production of CdS-based photocatalysts. Ma et al. used Ni3C nanoparticles as co-catalysts to modify CdS nanosheets for H2 evolution by illuminating with a 350-W Xe lamp [39]. CdS–1%Ni3C showed the largest H2 generation yield about 450.5 μm h−1 in a 10 vol% lactic acid solution corresponding to a quantum yield of 8.72% at the wavelength of 420 nm, which is 4.79 multiples greater than that on bare CdS nanosheets. The article shows that the bandgaps of the CdS nanosheets and CdS-1% Ni3C are 2.23 and 2.06 eV, respectively. The positive slopes of the Mott-Schottky (MS) spectra indicate that both the CdS nanosheets and CdS–1%Ni3C were n-type semiconductors, and the CB positions (vs. Ag/AgCl) of CdS nanosheets and CdS–1%NiC were −1.07 and −1 V, respectively. Moreover, the VB position could be calculated using the formula: Eg = Ec - Ev. Lang et al. combined the p-type Co3O4 with an n-type CdS semiconductor to construct a CdS/Co3O4 p-n heterojunction, which displayed a high photocatalytic quantum efficiency of 9.4% [40]. Meng et al. successfully synthesized Z-scheme CdS/TiO2 (Fig. 5 ) and achieved a H2 evolution efficiency of 51.4 mol h−1 [41]. Apart from binary complexes, ternary CdS-based photocatalysts with improved photocatalytic H2 evolution have also been synthesized. Yu et al. synthesized CdS/MoS2/graphene hollow microspheres via a facile biomolecule-assisted self-assembly route and carried out photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light by employing an aqueous lactic acid solution as the sacrificial reagent [42]. The reaction rate on the composite photocatalyst with the MoS2 content of 5% was 5 times larger than that on 1%Pt/CdS (Fig. 6 A). The EIS results revealed that the CdS/MoS2/graphene showed faster carrier transport than pure CdS because of its smaller diameter (Fig. 6C). The MS analysis of the photocatalysts revealed that both CdS and CdS/MoS2/graphene were n-type semiconductors owing to their positive slopes, indicating that the flat band potentials (EFB) were close to the CB of the semiconductors (Fig. 6D). CdS/MoS2/graphene shows more negative EFB (−0.99 V) than CdS (−0.88 V). This demonstrates that CdS/MoS2/graphene exhibits a stronger redox potential which facilitates H2 evolution. Moreover, the inserted graphene can augment the separation of carriers in CdS and improve the utilization of photogenerated electrons, as shown in Fig. 6E. In addition, the ternary system can also restrain the photocorrosion of CdS to some extent [42]. The strategies discussed thus far including the construction of binary, ternary, and Z-scheme systems can effectively improve the H2 production and sustainability of CdS-type photocatalysts. However, the H2 evolution reaction mechanism on CdS-based materials is still not clear and requires further investigation. The investigation of this mechanism will be helpful in designing novel powerful CdS-based photocatalysts. 3.2.2 Zinc sulfide (ZnS) Similar to CdS, zinc sulfide (ZnS) is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 3.3–3.7 eV and shows two crystal structures: hexagonal wurtzite (α-ZnS) and cubic sphalerite (β-ZnS). As a direct bandgap semiconductor material, ZnS shows high photon efficiency and excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. However, its wide bandgap (3.34 eV for sphalerite structure and 3.71 eV for wurtzite structure) and the fast recombination of photoinduced carriers restrain its applications in photocatalytic H2 evolution. Various approaches such as elemental doping and heterojunction construction have been used to address the issues of ZnS photocatalysts. Lee et al. successfully synthesized Cu/ZnS microspheres using a microwave-irradiation method and found that 2 mol% Cu2+-doped ZnS displayed the maximum photocatalytic H2 generation yield about 973.1 μmol h−1 g−1 [43]. They further synthesized In and Cu co-doped ZnS nanoparticles via using citric acid as the surfactant in deionized water and ethanol. The prepared samples were applied for splitting water to generate H2 under simulated sunlight. The 4In4CuZnS photocatalyst exhibited the maximum H2 generation yield of 752.7 μmol h−1 g−1 [43,44]. Dong et al. synthesized ternary ZnO/ZnS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites, a double Z-scheme heterojunction, by a simple two-step chemical conversion method. The ternary ZnO/ZnS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites showed abundant active sites and improved photocatalytic activity. A high H2 generation rate of 1205 μmol g−1 could be realized via water splitting after solar illumination for 4 h [45]. The modification strategies described above can effectively boost the light utilization, charge separation/transport, and active sites of ZnS-based photocatalysts, and hence can significantly improve their photocatalytic H2 generation efficiency (from water splitting). Reddy and co-workers developed an ultra-thin core/shell CdS/ZnS photocatalyst for H2 evolution by adopting a one-step hydrothermal approach. The shell prevented the photo-corrosion of the core, and hence increased the stability of the core/shell CdS/ZnS photocatalysts for constant H2 generation. The activity of the core/shell CdS/ZnS photocatalysts was 763- and 2.4-folds greater than those of pristine CdS and ZnS, respectively. The core/shell CdS/ZnS photocatalysts showed a quantum efficiency of 8.78%. Moreover, the core/shell CdS/ZnS photocatalysts exhibited excellent stability even under 20-W LED light irradiation at 420 nm for 100 h [46]. 3.2.3 Other metal sulfides Like single-metal sulfides, multi-metal sulfides also show a tunable band energy structure, which can improve their light response and charge separation/transfer, and thus their photocatalytic H2 production efficiency. Huang et al. fabricated hollow bimetallic sulfides (MxCo3-xS4, M = Zn, Ni, Cu) through a facile self-template strategy. Compared to other sulfides, Co3S4 is a promising sulfide photocatalyst for the HER. Its photocatalytic behavior is significantly augmented by the addition of secondary homogeneous metallic elements such as Zn, Ni, and Cu. Especially, hollow Zn0·30Co2·70S4 displays an excellent photocatalytic H2 generation yield of 155.2 μmol h−1 when it is sensitized with EY. This H2 generation activity is comparative to that on commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, Zn0·30Co2·70S4 shows good stability under neutral or alkaline conditions [47]."
5,Metal phosphide-based photocatalysts,"3.3 Metal phosphide-based photocatalysts Metal phosphides exhibit good mechanical stability, electron conductivity, and chemical stability. Metal phosphides show a crystal structure with a triangular prism configuration because of the large radius (0.109 nm) of P atoms. Metal phosphides tend to form isotropic crystal structures and contain a large number of unsaturated coordinated surface atoms, which may induce a high photocatalytic activity. It has been reported that some metal phosphides such as MoP [97], Fe2P, Ni2P, Co2P [98,99], and WP [100] work efficiently as co-catalysts to modify TiO2, CdS, and g-C3N4 photocatalysts. The incorporation of these metal phosphides induces a synergistic effect and improves the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, CdS, and g-C3N4. However, metal phosphides can serve as prominent photocatalysts by themselves for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Li et al. synthesized pure CoP and WP with low crystallinity and excellent optical properties. The H2 evolution kinetics revealed that H2 could be continuously produced by water splitting for 60 h on 10 mg CoP and WP. The amounts of H2 generated on CoP and WP were 601.1 and 483.9 μmol, respectively. Both the catalysts showed remarkable photocatalytic activity and stability [48]. Metal-doping has been employed to improve the photocatalytic H2 generation efficiency of phosphide-based photocatalysts. Man et al. reported the doping of NiP with transition metal elements including Mo, Mn, Fe, and Co through a facile wet-chemical method. These transition metals can replace nickel atoms in the crystal to form NiMP (M = Mo, Mn, Fe, Co) without changing its structure and shape, which is evidenced from the TEM analyses (Fig. 7 A and B). H2 evolution rates of 15.3, 16.7, 17, 20.4, and 17.7 mmol h−1 g−1 were observed for NiMoP, NiMnP, NiFeP, NiCoP, and Ni2P, respectively, when EY was used as the photosensitizer [49], as shown in Fig. 7C. Dye sensitization has also been introduced to promote the H2 production on the phosphide-based photocatalysts. Li et al. [50] synthesized bimetallic Fe–Ni–P nanotubes through a metal-organic framework derived method and injected different dyes on the tubes. The dye-sensitized Fe–Ni–P nanotubes exhibited prominent photocatalytic H2 production performance by coordinating the Fe/Ni ratio, and the maximum H2 production rate of 5420 μmol h−1 g−1 was achieved at eosin-Y sensitized Fe-1-Ni-2-P [50]. To construct heterojunction is another route to suppress the electron-hole recombination. Song et al. prepared MoP–Cu3P hybrids and the Schottky junctions were formed between intimate interfaces. The hybrids showed promoted features for visible–light harvesting, carrier separation and transfer, which resulted in an enhanced photocatalytic H2 production of 855 μmol h−1 g−1 [51]."
6,Metal-free photocatalysts,"3.4 Metal-free photocatalysts Since Wang et al. [101] reported the application of g-C3N4 for H2 evolution from water splitting in 2009 for the first time, metal-free g-C3N4 photocatalysts have gained immense attention and have been widely used. SiC is another metal-free photocatalyst for the HER and the investigation of its photocatalytic properties can be traced back to 1990. Significant advances have already been made to improve the photocatalytic H2 generation on SiC. 3.4.1 Graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) Graphite phase g-C3N4 is a non-metallic organic semiconductor possessing a narrow bandgap of 2.7 eV. It has two chemical structures: triazine rings and 3-s-triazine rings. In addition, its conduction band is lower than the standard hydrogen electrode potential, which facilitates water splitting to produce H2. Although g-C3N4 is considered as an efficient photocatalyst, it still suffers from a low specific surface area, wide bandgap, and fast recombination of electron-hole pairs, which restrain its practical applications. Various modification methods such as morphology control, metal or non-metal element doping, and constructing heterojunctions are used to improve its photocatalytic properties. Morphology control is an effective route to tune the intrinsic activity of g-C3N4, which in turn, can improve its H2 evolution efficiency. As can be observed from Table 3 , various g-C3N4 photocatalysts with diverse shapes have successfully prepared. These photocatalysts show distinct specific surface areas and exhibit different intrinsic activities, which significantly affect the rate of H2 evolution. Apart from morphology control, metal (Fe, Cu, and Zn, etc.) and/or non-metal (B, C, N, O, F, P, and S, etc.) doping has been investigated intensively to tune the photocatalytic behavior of g-C3N4. Zhou et al. synthesized N-doped graphitic carbon-incorporated g-C3N4 via thermal polymerization by adding urea and citric acid as the precursor [52]. The doped samples showed remarkably improved photogenerated carrier separation efficiency. The samples showed the highest H2 generation rate of 64 μmol h−1, which is 4.3 multiples larger than that of single-phase g-C3N4 [52]. Wang et al. prepared O-doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts by a one-pot solvothermal method [53]. With an increase in the dopant concentration, the bandgap of the photocatalyst decreased and the light utilization and charge separation improved. The highest H2 yield obtained under visible-light irradiation was 348 μmol h−1g−1. Cui et al. prepared B- and F-co-coped g-C3N4 photocatalysts through a simple two-step approach using [Emim] F-4 as the dopant [54]. B was doped in the internal framework of g-C3N4, which enhanced its visible light absorption and produced uniform porous structures after post-sintering. On the other hand, F was doped only on the surface layer. The photoelectron generation and separation of the g-C3N4 improved observably because of the synergistic effect of B and F doping. As a result, a good H2 generation yield of 351 μmol h−1 was achieved. Zhu et al. designed binary black phosphorus/graphite carbonitride (BP/g-C3N4) heterojunctions by introducing 2-D BP as the co-catalyst [55]. By strengthening the interfacial reaction, the charge transfer at the heterojunctions could be optimized, which efficiently improved their photocatalytic performance. The maximum H2 release yield of 428 μmol g−1 h−1 was obtained at the optimal BP/g-C3N4 ratio of 1/4. Other compounds with wide bandgaps have also been investigated to modify g-C3N4 for advancing its photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. It should be noted that the photocatalysts obtained using this approach are different from the abovementioned g-C3N4 photocatalysts, in which g-C3N4 played as the co-catalyst. Yu et al. modified g-C3N4 with Fe3+-doped TiO2 through a facile pyrolysis method [56]. The prepared composites exhibited significantly improved visible light response and photocatalytic performance. The maximum H2 production of 3748.46 μmol g−1 h−1 was realized and the quantum efficiency at 400 nm reached 1.42% when the mass ratio of g-C3N4 and TiO2 was 3:1. Cong et al. used an in-situ hydrothermal method to synthesize CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites containing a large surface area and improved charge separation [57]. A great photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 216.48 μmol h−1 g−1 was obtained at the optimal CdS amount of 10 wt%. Tian et al. prepared a new MoS2/g-C3N4 heterostructure photocatalyst through a facile impregnation and calcination method by using cyanamide, ammonium molybdate, and thiourea as the precursors [58]. A H2 generation yield of 23.10 μmol h−1 was achieved under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). This H2 generation rate was 11.3 folds than that obtained with pure g-C3N4. MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions can also be prepared using the ion-exchange and hydrothermal method [105]. Ye et al. grew Ni2P on the g-C3N4 surface by annealing, which facilitated the formation of a strong interface [59]. The prepared Ni2P/g-C3N4 exhibited a super H2 production rate of 82.5 μmol h−1 g−1, which is much larger than that obtained on Pt-loaded g-C3N4 under the same experimental conditions. The H2 generation rates on different improved g-C3N4 samples are listed in Table 4 . 3.4.2 Silicon carbide (SiC) SiC is the only solid binary carbide in group IV with a strong sp3 hybrid covalent bond. The crystal units of SiC are tetrahedrons formed by four Si/C atoms and a C/Si atom at the center. Since the electronegativities of Si and C are different (Si = 1.8 and C = 2.6), the covalent bond between them is polarized, resulting in different bond lengths between Si–C and the adjacent carbon layers. This generates relatively low stacking fault energy in SiC despite its strong covalent bonds. As a result, SiC shows different shapes and more than 250 structures have been reported. The application of SiC in photocatalysis can be traced back to 1990. Nariki, a Japanese researcher, used the arc-discharge method to produce various SiC nanopowders and used them for photocatalytic water splitting [128]. The reduction ability of SiC under UV irradiation is very strong and can be even an order of magnitude larger than that of Pt/TiO2. Till date, various methods have been developed to generate H2 from photocatalytic water decomposition on SiC based photocatalysts. Wang et al. fabricated a core-shell hierarchical architecture by growing ultrathin SnO2 nanosheets on mesoporous SiC nanofibers through a facile hydrothermal method [60]. The H2 evolution rate could reach 471.8 μmol h−1 g−1 under simulated sunlight. This good H2 generation yield is ascribed to the production of a large number of active sites by the ultrathin SnO2 nanosheets, hierarchical structure, and synergy of the SnO2/SiC composite. Wang and co-workers employed an in-situ method to synthesize g-C3N4/SiC composites with tunable mass quantities [61]. First, the SiC powder was put into a thiourea solution and the resulting mixture was constantly stirred at 55 °C to completely evaporate deionized water. Finally, graphitic g-C3N4/SiC was obtained after heating the mixture at 550 °C for 2 h. The prepared g-C3N4/SiC exhibited high stability in the H2 generation process and the highest H2 yield reached 182 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 3.4 folds greater than that obtained on pure g-C3N4. The improved performance of g-C3N4/SiC is mainly ascribed to the following two aspects: one is the increased surface area, and the efficiently promoted separation and migration of the photoinduced carriers; the other is the increased polymerization degree of g-C3N4 and the improved hydrophilicity of SiC. However, the extensive application of SiC in photocatalytic H2 evolution is limited and its modification with a suitable co-catalyst is still a challenge."
7,Other photocatalysts,"3.5 Other photocatalysts The application of metal oxynitride as a photocatalyst was firstly reported by the scientists from Nippon Institute of Technology. TaON, a metal oxynitride, has a small bandgap of 2.5 eV and can respond to visible light. Furthermore, its CB potential is slightly negative than the standard hydrogen electrode potential and its VB potential is 2.2 V, which is sufficient for water decomposition [129,130]. Chen et al. used Ni(OH)2 as the co-catalyst to modify TaON by loading Ni(OH)2 on TaON via a precipitation method [62]. They found that the H2 generation yield on Ni(OH)2/TaON reached 3.15 μmol h−1, which was greater than that obtained 0.5 wt% Pt/TaON (1.48 μmol h−1). Qi et al. firstly prepared a 1-D Ta3N5/BaTaO2N (BTON) heterostructure via a facile one-step ammonia thermal pathway by using single-phase KBa2Ta5O15 (KBTO) as the precursor [63]. This heterostructure showed an absorption edge at 600 nm. The special interface and increscent surface area provided a large number of channels for electron transfer and charge separation, which remarkably improved the H2 generation yield of Ta3N5/BaTaO2N (4.8 μmol h−1, higher than those of bare Ta3N5 and BTON nanoparticles). Li and co-authors summarized the recent advances in H2 generation on nickel-based photocatalysts (noble co-catalysts are also included) [15]. Modification strategies such as enhancing the light capture rate, improving the charge separation/transport, and reinforcing the interfacial interaction of semiconductor/co-catalyst assemblies were discussed in detail, providing new pathways for designing high-activity and high-stability nickel-based photocatalysts for H2 evolution. The methods used for enhancing the light trapping rate of photocatalysts include designing hierarchical photocatalysts, using surface sensitization, and developing broad-spectrum catalysts. For example, Zhang et al. used a solvothermal route to prepare core-shell TiO2 nanothorns/C nanofiber photocatalysts [64], which exhibited 13.5 times higher H2 generation rate than that of doped NiS. The separation of photogenerated carriers in photocatalysts can be improved by constructing Schottky junctions or semiconductor heterojunctions. Li et al. immobilized NiS on g-C3N4/C black Schottky junctions and achieved a H2 generation efficiency of 992 μmol g−1 h−1 [131]. Strengthening the interfacial interactions (increase interface contact area or tightness) is another approach to improve the H2 generation efficiency of photocatalysts. He et al. reported a g-C3N4 nanosheet/NiS heterojunction with a close-contact interface via one-step in-situ calcination of urea, thiourea, and nickel acetate. This heterojunction exhibited a maximum H2 yield of 29.68 μmol h−1 [132]."
8,Conclusions and future perspectives,"Photocatalytic water splitting is the simplest approach to robustly convert and utilize the abundant solar energy to produce H2, which is a promising and green alternative to fossil fuels. Intensive efforts have been made to improve the H2 evolution efficiency of the commonly used photocatalysts for practical applications. This review mainly focuses on the H2 evolution of high-performance photocatalysts without precious metals. Five types of non-noble metal photocatalysts including metal oxide-based, metal sulfide-based, metal phosphide-based, metal-free, and other non-precious metal photocatalysts have been comprehensively reviewed. Various strategies used for enhancing the photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting involving (1) metal or metalloid (non-metal) doping, (2) ion co-doping, (3) establishing heterojunctions (p-n type or Z-scheme), (4) constructing core-shell structures, (5) constructing ternary systems, (6) dye-sensitization, (7) controlling the morphology of the catalysts, and (8) increasing the contact area and strength of the interface have been discussed in detail. It should be noted that high H2 evolution efficiency can be achieved on photocatalysts without noble metals (even greater than those on the photocatalysts containing precious metals). Unlike noble metal photocatalysts, which deactivate in the presence of contaminants, non-noble metal photocatalysts exhibit high stability even in the presence of contaminants. Considerable progress has been achieved in improving the H2 evolution efficiency of photocatalysts. However, the photocatalysts developed till date are not suitable for large-scale practical applications. The challenges for large-scale H2 generation on photocatalysts without noble metals should not be ignored. (1) The long-term stability of the catalysts. The generally used photocatalysis loop tests are limited to several cycles, and long-term testing based on months or years is hardly reported. This makes it difficult to comment on the industrial applicability of present-day non-noble metal photocatalysts. (2) Low utilization of sunlight. Various approaches such as composition engineering have been used to expand the light absorption range. However, it is still a challenge to achieve solar-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution. (3) Rapid annihilation of electron-hole pairs. Although approaches, for instance, the construction of the Schottky barrier, p-n junctions, and heterojunctions have been proposed to improve the charge separation of non-noble-metal photocatalysts, significant progress has not been achieved in this regard. (4) The cost of the photocatalyst is always a challenge for its practical applications. (5) The low efficiency or deactivation of photocatalysts in the presence of contaminants. It should be noted that photocatalytic H2 generation on non-noble metal photocatalyst is desirable for practical applications because of their low expense and high efficiency. Further efforts should be made to obviously augment the H2 generation behavior of non-noble metal catalysts. The kinetics of catalytic reactions, active sites, and reaction routes should be investigated both theoretically and experimentally. DFT calculation is a good auxiliary tool to investigate the reaction barrier and adsorption energy of H2, which will provide an insight into the reaction mechanism. Multi-disciplinary strategies such as facet engineering, hierarchical structure design, heterojunction construction, and surface/interface engineering should also be investigated comprehensively in order to design and fabricate novel solar-driven non-noble metal photocatalysts. Finally, more attention should be paid to develop new sources for photocatalytic H2 generation such as wastewater in order to realize the conversion of waste to H2. This will address both the energy- and environment-related concerns. Recently, Wang et al. realized the co-production of H2 and diesel precursors from methylfurans on Ru-doped ZnIn2S4 under visible light [133], which opened a new pathway for producing biomass/hydrogen energy. The use of non-noble-metal photocatalysts may prominently accelerate H2 generation from photocatalysis."
