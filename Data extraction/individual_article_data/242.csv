0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a clean and reproducible energy carrier, and can be used for automobiles through fuel cell technology [1]. The hydrogen supply for fuel cell vehicles presents a technical challenge. Hydrogen storage using high pressure hydrogen tanks [2] and in-situ hydrogen production [3] are two common methods used. Generally, in-situ hydrogen production features strong safety and thus can be more acceptable for hydrogen storage and transportation [4]. For hydrogen production [5], a renewable source material such as methanol is attractive due to low reforming reaction temperature, low cracking and boiling temperature, and a high H/C ratio [6]. In recent years, methanol steam reforming (MSR) has been reported to produce hydrogen and supply high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) [7] and low-temperature PEMFCs [8,9] with the aim of generating electricity and powering mobile apparatuses and vehicles. The MSR reactor is a key component for MSR hydrogen production system, and the heat and mass transfer characteristics of the MSR reactor are determined mainly by the design of the catalyst support. Several types of catalyst supports have been proposed, such as microchannel [10–14], porous metal foam [15–19], micro-pin-fin array [20–23], etc. Pan et al. [11] developed an MSR reactor using a microchannel structure as a catalyst support, and two copper plates were used as vaporization and reforming units, respectively. They studied the effects of the structural parameters of the microchannel structure on hydrogen production. Sanz et al. [12] enhanced the methanol conversion and hydrogen production using a multi-channel block as the micro-reformer. This study demonstrated that the micro-reformer unit after optimized design can produce 170 LH2/h, which allows 218–255 W in a commercial PEMFC. Zhou et al. [16] utilized laminated porous Cu–Al fiber sintered felt as a catalyst support to develop a cylindrical-stacked MSR reactor. Experimental tests showed that the reactor has a higher methanol conversion and a higher hydrogen flow rate. Qian et al. [20] proposed a microreactor using micro-pin-fin arrays as catalyst supports to increase the compactness of the MSR microreactor. Both numerical and experimental results demonstrated that the methanol conversion of micro-pin-fin array type microreactors is higher than that in microchannel reactor. The catalyst supports used in MSR reactors are mostly made of metal materials, such as stainless steel [24,25], aluminum [10,26], copper [15,27], cordierite [28], etc. These materials, used in catalyst supports, have a relatively small specific surface area, which leads to low catalyst loading capacity. Table 1 summarizes the mechanical properties of these materials commonly used for the manufacture of catalyst supports in MSR reactors. The detailed parameters are provided through the material property data in MetWeb. The SiC honeycomb ceramic has been determined an attractive option due to its generally low density (~2.7 g/cm3), high specific heat capacity (~720 J/kg·K), higher thermal conductivity (~190 W/m·K), and high melting point (>1600 °C) [29–33]. Thus, this material has been applied in diesel particulate filters, heat exchangers, and volumetric solar receivers [34–38]. For example, Tsuneyoshi et al. [32] developed two types of diesel particulate filters using SiC honeycomb ceramic with square and hexagonal cells, and investigate the soot combustion on bare and catalyzed DPFs under controlled and uncontrolled regeneration. Fend et al. [39] utilized SiC honeycomb ceramics with a high heat transfer surface/volume ratio of 995 to develop a high-temperature heat exchanger. Experimental results show that the heat exchanging efficiency of the heat exchanger can reach up to 65% at a temperature of 950 °C. In our study, the SiC honeycomb ceramic is used as a catalyst support for a novel MSR microreactor with the goal of improving the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics for high volume hydrogen production. In addition, the structural design of the MSR microreactor is also investigated to enable thermally autonomous operation. Numerical modeling has been widely used to analyze the heat and fluid flow characteristics of MSR reactors. In recent years, several numerical models for MSR reactors have been developed [40–46]. Klenov et al. [40] presented a 1/6 numerical model to study a thermally autonomous multichannel reactor. Simulation results showed that the maximum value of the nonuniformity of temperature was 2.4% in the multichannel catalytic unit. Mei et al. [41] developed a numerical model to compare the performances of an A-type microchannel reactor with a conventional Z-type microchannel reactor. Both numerical simulations and experimental testing results demonstrated that the A-type microchannel reactor had higher methanol conversion and a relatively lower pressure drop than that of the Z-type microchannel reactor. Uriz et al. [42] created a 3D numerical model with 100 parallel microchannels to study the effects of fluid flow distribution and heat loss on performance in hydrogen production. The optimization of the structural parameter of this microchannel reactor was achieved based on the numerical model. Zeng et al. [40] compared two manifold structures by developing a three-dimensional CFD model under no reaction and methanol steam reforming occurs. The simulation and experimental results showed that the microchannel plate with right-angle manifold had a better conversion rate and selectivity than that of the microchannel plate with oblique-angle manifold. In this study, the utilized SiC honeycomb ceramics have numerous microchannels and thin wall thicknesses, and the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are different from those of traditional microchannel-typed reactors. Therefore, we developed a 3D numerical model to analyze heat transfer and fluid flow performances of SiC ceramic catalyst supports with the aim of validating our hypothesis about using SiC ceramics to develop a highly efficient MSR microreactor for hydrogen production. In this study, a novel thermally autonomous MSR microreactor is developed by using a SiC honeycomb ceramic as catalyst support. Firstly, the structural design and working principle of an MSR reactor for the thermally autonomous operation are described. Then, a 3D numerical model is developed to study the benefits of using SiC ceramic catalyst support to enhance the heat and fluid flow transfer characteristics of the MSR microreactor. This is followed by the fabrication of the MSR microreactor, system setup, and experimental testing. Finally, the results and discussion are conducted in this paper."
