0,Introduction,"With the depletion of fossil fuels, energy shortage is an important issue that constrains economic and social development [1]. Hydrogen is an ideal alternative energy carrier to fossil fuels in the future which is clean, efficient, and zero pollutant emissions [2–5]. Up to now, electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a simple, effective, and pollution-free hydrogen production process. Although the rare Pt-based materials are found to be the most effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [6]. Its large-scale applications are still limited due to the drawback of high consumption and expensive price [7–9]. Therefore, efficient, non-precious metal electrocatalysts that can be produced on a large scale are needed for the future hydrogen economy [10,11]. In the past decade, 3d metal based-materials, such as Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, either alone or composites, have been reported as excellent electrocatalysts for hydrogen production, among which Ni-based catalysts attract more attention, owing to their significant availability, low overpotential and excellent corrosion resistance [12–15]. Meanwhile, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) has been extensively studied as HER catalysts, in virtue of excellent electrocatalytic performance, such as significant electrical conductivity, wide range pH stability, and similar d-band electronic structure to Pt-group metals [5,9]. Inspired by the aforementioned results, several outstanding researches have been studied, focusing on Ni-Mo2C based composite catalysts [2,16–18]. It has been proven that doping Ni into Mo2C can achieve a better HER performance compared with the bare Mo2C [19]. Although the Ni and Mo2C composite modified materials have exhibited good HER properties, it is convinced that constructing novel Ni-Mo2C based materials with numerous active interfaces between Ni and Mo2C can improve their interaction and further significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performance towards HER. Herein, we have made it a success to fabricate strongly coupled Mo2C and Ni nanoparticles encapsulated by porous carbon nanofibers (Ni-Mo2C-CNF) through annealing hydrothermally obtained NiMoO4 modified electrospinning polyvinyl alcohol fibers under Ar atmosphere. With NiMoO4 as single metal precursor, the resultant Ni-Mo2C-CNF can be endowed with massive Ni/Mo2C interfaces, which exhibits an outstanding activity for HER with a low overpotential (196 mV) to reach current density of 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel plot (54.7 mV dec−1) and remarkable stability during operation in basic solution. Therefore, this work will provide positive inspirations for the designable construction of heterostructured composite materials with outstanding electrocatalytic performance for various future energy applications. The Ni-Mo2C-CNF electrocatalysts were prepared by three step procedures, as shown in Scheme 1 . The NiMoO4 nanorods, as homologous bimetallic precursor, were firstly synthesized by a hydrothermal method based on the published literature and appropriately characterized in Fig. S1. Then, the nanofibers containing NiMoO4 are prepared by electrospinning the mixture of NiMoO4 and PVA. Finally, the electrospinning resultant was carbonized under the Ar atmosphere to achieve the targeted catalyst. In order to understand whether the homogenous bimetal oxide improves the performance of the catalyst, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H (NiAc2·4H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O as precursors), Ni-CNF, and Mo2C-CNF were synthesized in the same methods as described above."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of NiMoO4 nanorods,"2.1 Preparation of NiMoO4 nanorods The NiMoO4 nanorods were prepared by a hydrothermal method according to the reported literature [20]. Briefly, 0.49 g NiAc2·4H2O and 0.34 g (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O were dissolved in 35 ml H2O. The clear solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 6 h. After reaction, the solution was centrifuged, washed, and dried to obtain NiMoO4 nanorods."
3,Preparation of Ni-Mo2C-CNF catalyst,"2.2 Preparation of Ni-Mo2C-CNF catalyst The NiMoO4 nanorods (0.3 g) and 10 wt% PVA aqueous solution (20 g) were mixed together. The obtained precursor solution was loaded into a 5 ml plastic syringe with a stainless-steel needle at the pushing rate of 0.28 ml h−1. The electrospinning process was carried out at a positive potential of 20 kV. The obtained sample was treated at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere to get the final Ni-Mo2C-CNF catalyst. The samples were cooled to room temperature naturally. For comparison, the catalysts treated at 700, 800 and 900 °C were prepared as sample-700, sample-800 and sample-900, respectively. Meanwhile, the catalysts with 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 g NiMoO4 added were also prepared under 800 °C and other conditions unchanged (Ni-Mo2C-CNF1, Ni-Mo2C-CNF2, and Ni-Mo2C-CNF3)."
4,"Preparation of Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H, Mo2C-CNF and Ni-CNF catalysts","2.3 Preparation of Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H, Mo2C-CNF and Ni-CNF catalysts According to the content of NiMoO4 (0.3 g) used in Ni-Mo2C-CNF, the same amount of Ni and Mo are converted into C4H6NiO4·4H2O (0.34 g) and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.24 g). 2.3.1 Preparation of Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H C4H6NiO4·4H2O (0.34 g), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.24 g) and 10 wt% PVA aqueous solution (20 g) were mixed together. The obtained precursor solution was loaded into a 5 ml plastic syringe with a stainless-steel needle at the pushing rate of 0.28 ml h−1. The electrospinning process was carried out at a positive potential of 20 kV. The obtained sample was treated at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere to get the final Ni-Mo2C-CNF catalyst. The samples were cooled to room temperature naturally. 2.3.2 Preparation of Ni-CNF C4H6NiO4·4H2O (0.34 g), and 10 wt% PVA aqueous solution (20 g) were mixed together. The rest of the operation is the same as the above preparation method of Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H. 2.3.3 Preparation of Mo2C-CNF (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.24 g) and 10 wt% PVA aqueous solution (20 g) were mixed together. The rest of the operation is the same as the above preparation method of Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The crystalline structures of as-obtain catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD RINT 2000 vertical goniometer using K radiation with λ = 15418 Å, 40 kV, 100 mA, scanning rate 5° min−1). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Tecnai F-20) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Hillsboro, OR, USA) were used to investigate morphologies and elemental components of samples. The N2 sorption tests were carried out on automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Autosorb Station 1). XPS was carried with Thermo ESCALAB 250."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements The HER performance of as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by adopting electrochemical workstation (CHI852C, China) with a typical three-electrode system in 1 M KOH. Graphite electrodes and saturated Ag/AgCl were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. A GCE (3 mm in diameter) with the Ni-Mo2C-CNF was used as the working electrode, 3 mg of the catalyst was mixed with 1 ml solution of ethanol and deionized water in 1:1 vol ratio under sonication for 20 min. Immediately, Nafion of 5 μL was dispersed in the above solution and sonicated for 10 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then the above ink of 5 μL was dropped onto polished glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with 3 mm in diameter. All potentials were corrected with respect to the reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE). Tafel curves were calculated from linear polarization with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with an advanced electrochemical system (PARSTAT 2273, Ametek, USA) at room temperature and was performed at −125 mV (vs. RHE) with from 100 kHz to 100 mHz and AC amplitude of 10 mV."
7,Results and discussion,"The crystal phase and morphology of as-prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1 a, the XRD patterns of Ni-Mo2C-CNF and Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H completely coincide with the standard cards of Ni (PDF#04-0850) and Mo2C (PDF#35-0787), which proves the successful synthesis of carbon nanofibers modified by Ni and Mo2C. Furthermore, it is also indicated that the employment of homologous or heterologous metal precursor has no effect on the phase composition of materials. Expectedly, the contrast samples Ni-CNF and Mo2C-CNF fabricated with only Ni or Mo precursor display characteristic peaks ascribed to Ni and Mo2C. The SEM measurement (Fig. S2a–b) demonstrates a net-like structure formed by interlaced carbon fibers, which facilitates mass transport and active sites exposure in the catalytic process. Simultaneously, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF possesses a distinctly rougher surface than Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H, which should be ascribed to larger metal nanoparticles derived from NiMoO4 nanorod. Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 1b and d, the SEM and TEM images of Ni-Mo2C-CNF reveal several nanoparticles are well encapsulated inside the nanofibers, which facilitates the electrocatalytic stability of materials. On the contrary, as observed from Fig. 1e, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H demonstrates the uniform distribution of small nanoparticles over the composite fibers. HRTEM image of Ni-Mo2C-CNF (Fig. 1c) illustrates obvious lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 0.20 and 0.24 nm, which corresponds to the (1 1 1) plane of Ni and the (0 0 2) plane of Mo2C, respectively. Moreover, apparent phase interface can be detected from the overlapping region of Ni and Mo2C nanoparticles, which facilitates the electron interactions between Ni and Mo2C, and create abundant active sites and further improve the HER activity. Moreover, the EDX elemental mapping (Fig. 1f–i) clearly shows that Ni and Mo element signals are connected to each other or wrapped together, which reconfirms the improvement of the contact interface between Ni and Mo2C resulting by the application of NiMoO4 as single metal precursor. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out to further investigate the surface composition and valence states of the as-synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. S3, the XPS survey reveals the presence of Ni, Mo and C elements in the Ni-Mo2C-CNF and Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H. In the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2 a), the peak at 853.0 and 870.3 eV can be assigned to the metallic Ni and the peak centered at 856.4 and 874.2 eV belong to the characteristic peaks of Ni2+ in Ni-Mo2C-CNF [21]. In comparison, the corresponding Ni peaks for Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H and Ni-CNF display positive shift about 0.2 and 0.4 eV. Fig. 2b illustrates the Mo 3d XPS spectra of Ni-Mo2C-CNF, Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H and Mo2C-CNF, demonstrating three characteristic states (+2, +4 and +6) for Mo on the surface of these nanocarbon fibers. The peak located at 228.5 and 231.7 eV for Ni-Mo2C-CNF are assigned to Mo2+ while Mo4+ and Mo6+ may be derived from oxidized Mo species, owing to the unavoidable oxidation on the surface. Compared with Ni-Mo2C-CNF, the characteristic doublet Mo2+ peaks for Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H and Mo2C-CNF are negatively shifted 0.3 and 0.6 eV while the Mo4+ and Mo6+ signals are also shifted [22–24]. It is worth highlighting that, compared with Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H, the distinct binding energy shifts of Ni-Mo2C-CNF should be attributed to the improved electron transfer from Ni to Mo2C via abundant Ni/Mo2C phase interfaces generated from NiMoO4 as single metal precursor, which contributes to the synergistic effect between Ni and Mo2C, reduces the hydrogen bond energy, and thereby promotes the absorption and desorption of H2. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity of Ni-Mo2C-CNF and Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H are examined by the N2 sorption measurement (Fig. 2c and d). Ni-Mo2C-CNF manifests a larger specific surface area (93.51 m2/g) than Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H (62.68 m2/g). Meanwhile, the pore size distribution curves displayed in Fig. 2d suggest that the pore diameter of Ni-Mo2C-CNF is mainly distributed at 3.9 nm while that of Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H is mainly distributed at 3.7 and 7.5 nm [25]. The better porosity and higher specific surface area of Ni-Mo2C-CNF can benefit the exposure of active sites, transport of reactive species and further boost the HER activity. The HER performance of as-prepared catalysts is evaluated by adopting a typical three-electrode system in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 under iR drop compensation (Fig. 3 a). In comparison, commercial 20 wt% Pt/C, Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H, Mo2C-CNF and Ni-CNF are also investigated under the same conditions. The Pt/C electrode exhibits as-imagined HER performance with an overpotential of 116 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, the LSV polarization curves of Ni-Mo2C-CNF and Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H show improved HER performance with smaller overpotentials of 196 and 287 mV at current density of 10 mA cm−2, compared with those of Ni-CNF (343 mV) and Mo2C-CNF (372 mV), which validates the importance of interaction between Ni and Mo2C for the enhancement of HER activity. In accordance with the morphological and crystal structure characterization described above, compared to the Ni-Mo2C-CNF, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H possesses the same net-like structure and phase composition with smaller metal nanoparticles unfirmly dispersed in the materials, which generally implying enhanced density of active sites for the electrocatalysis. However, on the contrary, Ni-Mo2C-CNF significantly presents a better HER activity than that of Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H, owing to the improved interaction between Ni and Mo2C through the formation of numerous active interfaces stemmed from NiMoO4. The Tafel slope is an important parameter to estimate the kinetic activities of electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Tafel slope of Pt/C is 33.5 mV dec−1, ranking the lowest among these catalysts. In the meantime, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF manifests a faster reaction kinetic in HER with a Tafel slope of 54.7 mV dec−1, which is lower than Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H (107.8 mV dec−1), Ni-CNF (120.1 mV dec−1) and Mo2C-CNF (160.9 mV dec−1). In accordance with previous report, the HER process of Ni-Mo2C-CNF follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism due to its Tafel slope between 40 and 120 mV dec−1 in alkaline conditions [26]. Furthermore, it is noted that, the impressive HER performance of Ni-Mo2C-CNF demonstrated above is also comparable to the other Ni or Mo2C-based electrocatalysts reported recently (Table S1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) conducted at overpotentials (−125 mV) from 100 kHz to 100 mHz is used to investigate the electrode kinetics interface reactions of as-prepared catalysts. At −125 mV (vs. RHE), the catalyst has started to produce hydrogen and its proton transfer impedance can be measured. As seen from the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 3c, the Ni-Mo2C-CNF is a smaller semicircle compared to the Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H, Ni-CMF and Mo2C-CNF, evidencing the enhanced electronic transfer capability resulting by the formation of abundant Ni/Mo2C interfaces [5]. The optimization of HER performance for Ni-Mo2C-CNF is performed by the adjustment of annealing temperature and ratio of NiMoO4 and PVA. As depicted in Fig. 4 , the Ni-Mo2C-CNF synthesized at 800 °C with additional of 0.3 g NiMoO4 exhibits the best HER performance among these catalysts and the detailed HER performance is summarized in Table S2. We further investigate the electrochemically double layer capacitance (C dl ) to evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (Fig. S4) [18,27–29]. As shown in Fig. S5, Ni-Mo2C-CNF exhibits a larger C dl of 8.9 mF cm−2 than Ni-Mo2C-CNF-H(6.46 mF cm−2), Ni-CMF(2.62 mF cm−2) and Mo2C-CN(2.06 mF cm−2), revealing the improved ECSA arising from the plentiful active sites for electrocatalysis. The stability test of Ni-Mo2C-CNF is carried out at current densities of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3d). Since the electrocatalytic active components are encapsulated inside carbon fibers, Ni-Mo2C-CNF exhibits excellent HER stability under alkaline conditions. After the stability test, no significant change can be found in the morphology and crystal structure of the electrocatalyst through the SEM and XRD characterization (Fig. S6)."
8,Conclusions,"Based on previous reports on the interaction between Mo2C and Ni, which can effectively speed up the sluggish HER Kinetics [2,16–18]. The present work that application of NiMoO4 as homologous bimetallic precursor can promote the in-situ formation of interfaces between Ni and Mo2C phase, thereby reinforce the corresponding interaction for generating numerous HER active sites and further boost the HER activity of electrocatalyst. The Ni-Mo2C-CNF obtained by pyrolyzing electrospinning polyvinyl alcohol fibers containing NiMoO4 performs well in HER with low overpotential of 196 mV to deliver current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 54.7 mV dec−1 under alkaline conditions. It is the application of electrospinning that allows Ni and Mo2C nanoparticles to be well encapsulated in the porous carbon fibers, which contributes to the stability of the HER process. Therefore, this work will provide positive inspirations to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of bimetallic composite catalysts for large-scale hydrogen production and conversion."
