0,Introduction,"Alcohols, as methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), ethylene glycol (EgOH) and glycerol (GlOH) have been considered as potential fuels for direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs). DAFCs produce electrical energy through a coupled electrochemical reaction, wherein the alcohol is electrooxidized at the anode and an oxidant, generally oxygen, is electro reduced at the cathode. The possibility of obtaining alcohols from biomass makes the DAFCs an environmental friendly alternative to fossil fuels for the production of clean energy. Considerable theoretical energy densities can be realized with DAFCs, namely 6.1, 5.3 and 5.0 kW h kg−1 by using MeOH, EgOH or GlOH [1], respectively. The differences in energy density are related to the chemical structure, elemental composition and number of electrons that can be harvested per molecule, as depicted in eqs. (1)–(3) for the complete electrooxidation of the alcohols in alkaline medium. However, the limited ability of widely used Pt-based electrocatalysts to break CC bonds of small-chain alcohols leads the surface reaction towards partially electrooxidized compounds, as acids, ketones and aldehydes [2–7]. Although the surface electrochemical reactions involving alcohols are still not clear, such fuels have been used in order to generate power for practical applications. (1) CH3(OH) + 8OH− → CO3 2− + 6H2O + 6e− (2) C2H4(OH)2 + 14OH− → 2CO3 2− + 10H2O + 10e− (3) C3H5(OH)3 + 20OH−→ 3CO3 2− + 14H2O + 14e− Besides conventional polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, biomass-derived alcohols can be used to feed the anode of microfluidic fuel cells (μFC) [8–10]. μFCs utilize laminar flow to separate the reactant streams. This design permits ionic transport through the interface between the co-laminar flows, excluding the need for an ionic exchange membrane [8,9]. Therefore, the crossover issues and ohmic drop related to the use of a membrane are eliminated, while simultaneously reducing cost [8]. Additionally, μFCs enable individually selected reactant media, which may shift the reversible half-cell potentials due to pH modification toward a higher cell potential window [11–13]. The concept behind mixed-media operation for microfluidic fuel cells is described by Cohen et al. [11] and Choban et al. [14], wherein the tuning of the pH of the flowing streams separately were shown to increase the reversible potentials in both H2/O2 and DMFC systems, respectively. Since the Nernstian potential is pH dependent, the onset potential of the electrooxidation reaction is shifted towards lower values in alkaline medium while the onset of the reduction reaction is displaced towards higher values in acid medium. In addition, those authors described that the mixed-media operation may form the exothermic neutralization of OH− and H+ at the co-laminar interface in the middle of the microfluidic channel and away from the electrodes, generating liquid junction potential which the two works estimated to be less than 50 mV [11,14]. This well-established concept has been previously used in organic redox species, formic acid and various alcohols fuel cells [10,15–17]. It is also possible to design μFCs wherein the anolyte and catholyte streams flow through porous electrodes, which maximizes the use of active surface area, mass transport and the reaction efficiency, accordingly [9,18–20]. The flow-through porous electrode configuration boosted the performance of membraneless microfluidic direct alcohol fuel cells (μDAFCs) [21–23]. For instance, the peak power density of a μDAFC fed by ethylene glycol increased from 1.6 mW cm−2 in a cell designed with flow over electrodes [23] towards 20 mW cm−2 by using flow-through porous electrode configuration [24]. However, the opportunities of combining mixed-media conditions with flow-through porous electrodes have been underexplored in μDAFCs to date [10,15,17,23]. Arriaga's group proposed the use of different alcohols (or even mixed) to feed the same all-alkaline μDAFCs [24]. Their work enabled the possibility to change the fuel depending on its availability. This idea opens up a new way of designing μDAFCs, since the production of similar power output for different fuels becomes desirable. In this case, the choice of cell architecture, catalyst(s) and chemical environment are important. Different carbon supports [25] and metals [21,24] were recently investigated for such μDAFCs. For instance, Cu@Pt/C as anode in an all-alkaline μDAFC with air-breathing cathode produced 23 mW cm−2 at 0.37 V [21]. Miao et al. developed a monolithic microtubular μDMFC using TiO2 PtRuO2 as anode to produce 257 mW cm−2 of maximum power density [22]. By using commercial Pt/C nanoparticles (NPs) as catalyst on both electrodes and bleach as catholyte, our group recently developed a microfluidic direct glycerol fuel cell (μDGFC) that produced ∼315 mW cm−2 of peak power density at 0.81 V [17]. To achieve such performance levels, both mixed-media operation and flow-through electrode configuration were aptly incorporated [17]. Maya-Cornejo et al. [24] compared the performance of all-alkaline μDAFCs fed by MeOH, EtOH, EgOH and GlOH at a fixed concentration of 0.1 M. They found that EtOH released the highest power output. Interestingly, EtOH was the only fuel containing a non-hydrated carbon in its structure. In fact, the ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EtEOR) produces higher current densities than GlOH, even though the glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GEOR) produces more CO2, especially at high overpotentials [5]. This is a consequence of the complexity of the reaction mechanism in each case. GlOH is converted into CO2 through a sequential pathway involving several carbonyl compounds, releasing few electrons per step. For EtEOR, CO2 is directly produced from CO, while acetic acid is generated in parallel reactions [5]. Teles et al. compared the electrocatalytic parameters of the methanol electrooxidation reaction (MEOR) with the EtEOR and GEOR, taking into account the same number of carbons in the molecule chains of each alcohol participating at the anodic reaction [26]. This choice was made in order to provide theoretically comparable conditions, since the complete electrooxidation is proportional to the amount of CO2 generated [5], which in turn is proportional to the number of carbons of the molecules. Furthermore, this scenario converges all the cases towards a theoretically similar CO poisoning limitation since it is the main intermediate and constraint for the complete electrooxidation of all alcohols. By using classic half-cell measurements in stationary conditions, they found a slightly decreased onset potential for the MEOR and GEOR compared to the EtEOR, and higher current densities for the MEOR [26]. However, no similar investigations comparing MEOR, ethylene glycol electrooxidation reaction (EgEOR) and GEOR have been reported to date. Moreover, the literature lacks information regarding the comparison of these three anodic half-cell reactions on flow-through porous electrodes. Therefore, we present a fuel-flexible μDAFC fed by renewable biomass-derived alcohols, namely, methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol at the anode coupled to oxygen reduction at the cathode. For the first time, the fuel-flexible μDAFC is designed with flow-through porous electrodes operating in mixed media to enable high power output and a practical assessment of the different fuel chemistries for low-cost fuel cell applications. The evaluation emphasizes cell performance in terms of power density and cell polarization in the context of the number of carbons participating in the cell reaction at different concentrations of each fuel."
1,Experimental,"The microfluidic channels for the microfluidic fuel cell with flow-through electrodes configuration used here are built by UV soft-lithography of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) from a photoresist designed template, as previously reported [27]. The cell is designed to have two inlets, two outlets and two electrical contacts, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The electrodes are separated by a 1 mm wide co-laminar microchannel. The two electrodes and the co-laminar channels are 10 mm long and 0.15 mm deep, forming an electrode cross sectional area of 0.015 cm2 normal to the flow direction, obtained by multiplying the electrode height (depth) by the length. This area is equivalent to the area of physical separators or membranes used in a conventional PEM DMFC (normal to the ion transport) and is thus used to normalize the current and the power output of the cell as generally used in μFCs with flow-through porous electrodes [9]. Both anode and cathode supports are cut from carbon paper (CP) Toray® TGP-060. The Pt/C-modified CP catalysts are obtained by 50x successive immersions in an ink of commercial Pt/C NPs (E-TEK 47%) and dried at 65 °C for 3 h. The inks are prepared by adding 70 mg Pt/C NPs powder in 6 mL methanol solution (50% V/V) and 687 μL Nafion® 5% (Aldrich). After modifying CP with Pt/C NPs, these 1 mm wide rectangular electrode strips are placed in their respective grooves in the PDMS template and enduringly bonded to a glass slide substrate by submitting both surfaces to a plasma treatment (BD-20AC, Electro-Technic Products) followed by 12–24 h of slight compression. The electrical contacts for anode and cathode are made by silver conductive epoxy (ref. number 8331, MG Chemicals). The CP-modified Pt/C NPs are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a FEI Helios NanoLab 650 SEM/FIB instrument. SEM images are collected at 10 kV with 100 pA beam current and 4.9 mm working distance. Furthermore, the morphology and mean size analysis were investigated using a FEI Tecnai Osiris S/TEM equipment. The mean diameter of the NPs was calculated by measuring approximately 200 NPs through the software Axio Vision SE64 Rel.4.8. The electrolyte flow through the cell is driven by a dual syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus), operating at flow rates ranging from 10 to 400 μL min−1, as indicated elsewhere. The alcohol anodic reactions are investigated in a range of 0.05–2 M for glycerol, 0.075 and 1 M for ethylene glycol and 0.15 and 3 M for methanol. The concentrations of the alcohols are also indicated through the text. All cells operate in N2-saturated 1 M KOH as electrolyte at the anode and saturated dissolved O2 in 1 M H2SO4 catholyte. The anolyte is prepared by adding proper amounts of the alcohol (microliters) to a vial containing proper volume of the alkaline solution. 7 mL of each electrolyte is bubbled with each respective gas in order to prepare the respective gas-saturated solution. All polarization measurements are performed with a potentiostat/galvanostat (Gamry, Reference 3000). The polarization curves are recorded from OCV to 0.1 V at a scan rate of 0.01 V s−1 and the cell resistance is acquired by measuring the high frequency intercept of the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy by sweeping the frequency from 106 Hz."
2,Results and discussion,"The proposed fuel-flexible μDAFC architecture used in this work is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The cell is designed to incorporate two flow-through porous electrodes separated by co-laminar flow in a thin micro-channel. Both electrodes are composed of Pt/C-modified carbon paper (CP). The carbon fibers of the CP are partially covered by ∼5 nm Pt/C NPs, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 1(b). The Pt/C NPs are well-distributed over the carbon support, as can be seen in the inset of Fig. 1(b) and by the representative TEM image shown in Fig. S1. The successful use of such catalyst as both anode and cathode for μFCs has been previously reported [17]. The present cell employs mixed media conditions with an alkaline anodic half-cell and an acidic cathodic half-cell. While different fuels are considered at the anode, the cathode utilizes dissolved oxygen as oxidant in all cases."
3,Evaluation of glycerol as fuel,"3.1 Evaluation of glycerol as fuel Prior to investigating microfluidic direct ethylene glycol (μDEFCs) and methanol fuel cells (μDMFCs), we studied the influence of the GlOH concentration on the power density and polarization curves of the mixed media μDGFC with flow-through porous electrode configuration. The aim was to use the GlOH concentrations as benchmark to choose EgOH and MeOH concentrations. The influence of the GlOH concentration on the activity of a Pt electrode was studied by Gomes et al. by in situ FTIR and classic half-cell measurements in acidic medium [3]. They found that glycerol and hydrogen compete for the Pt active sites, while CO is progressively formed due to the alcohol dissociative adsorption. At high glycerol concentration, the co-adsorption of water was inhibited by excess glycerol and partially oxidized products, preventing CO electrochemical removal, which decreased the pseudo-stationary current densities [3]. Ilie et al. investigated the influence of the GlOH concentration in a solid alkaline membrane DGFC [28] and found that the ionic mobility was compromised by using high glycerol concentrations, which led to an increase in ionic resistance. Here, this issue is systematically addressed for μDGFCs with flow-through porous electrodes and mixed media conditions. Fig. 2 shows the polarization and power density curves of the μDGFCs for GlOH concentrations from 0.05 M to 2 M in 1 M KOH with saturated dissolved O2 in 1 M H2SO4 as catholyte, at a flow rate of 400 μL min−1. Additional experiments were performed at different flow rates from 10 to 400 μL min−1 per stream, as shown in Figs. S1(a)-(e) in the Supplementary Information. The use of mixed media condition enables ∼1.2 V open circuit voltage (OCV), which is a higher cell potential window than those found for all-alkaline μDGFCs [21,24]. This is a consequence of the displacement in half-cell reversible potential of the oxygen reduction reaction towards more positive values due to the acidic cathodic reaction, since the Nernstian potential is pH dependent [12]. In general, the results show an alteration from mass transport limited polarization at 10 μL min−1 towards a mostly ohmic limited behavior at 400 μL min−1. The mass transport limitation is likely due to the starvation in the catholyte stream using dissolved O2. This behavior has been previously observed for dissolved oxygen catholyte [29]. The limiting current density is increased by increasing the flow rate for all concentrations, as a result of the augmented supply of O2 to the cathode (Figs. S1(a)-(e)). Interestingly, at low flow rates, a sudden rise in current density is observed at low cell potentials below ∼0.2 V after reaching the regular limiting current density. This feature can be ascribed to a side reaction, most likely proton reduction to hydrogen due to the high cathodic overpotentials in oxygen starved states enabled by the high cell voltage window under mixed media conditions. Gas bubbles, presumably hydrogen, were observed at the cathode at such conditions. This phenomenon was however suppressed at high flow rates due to improved oxygen supply. The overall polarization performance at high flow rates was found to decrease with increasing GlOH concentration, as shown in Fig. 2. The onset potential of the GEOR does not change significantly with GlOH concentration [3]. Thus, the OCV was consistent for all concentrations, ranging from 1.23 to 1.29 V, as shown in Table 1 . On the other hand, the GEOR kinetics is compromised by increasing glycerol concentration. The use of 2 M GlOH fuel contributed large activation polarization losses (Fig. 2). However, good kinetics is observed at low concentrations consistently up to 0.5 M GlOH (Fig. 2). The influence of the GlOH concentration on the kinetics of the μDGFC differs from previous reports using half-cell measurements in stationary condition [3]. Gomes et al. reported a sudden decrease in pseudo-stationary current density by increasing the GlOH concentration from 0.05 to 0.3 M [3]. The enhanced surface area utilization in the flow-through porous electrode used here improves the collision factor of the GEOR, enhancing the kinetics in concentrated solution. On the other hand, the thin layer close to the bulk electrode surface in stationary solution, as that used by Gomes et al. [3], saturates with partially oxidized GlOH species at earlier stages, compromising the GEOR. Fig. 2 also reveals that ohmic losses are more significant at high concentrations, which can be noted from the differences in the slope of the polarization curves. At GlOH concentrations of 0.05–0.5 M, the cells displayed similar ohmic cell resistance in the range of 50.1–54.8 Ω as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). However, the resistance reached 60.5 and 74.2 Ω for 1 and 2 M GlOH, respectively (Table 1). The increase in viscosity, as a result of using high GlOH concentrations, diminishes the ionic mobility and augments the ionic resistance accordingly, as shown by the ohmic loss contribution in Fig. 2. Similar implications were reported by Ilie et al. for conventional DAFCs [28], as discussed before. Moreover, at high current densities, the limiting current densities were comparable at low GlOH concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 M. On the other hand, the limiting current density significantly decreased at higher concentrations, which may be a consequence of the poor mobility of GlOH and OH− in the viscous anolyte. Since the cathode condition was fixed, this effect is strictly associated with the anode half-cell. Therefore, the limited performance of μDGFC operation using high GlOH concentrations coupled to oxygen reduction was evident. As shown by the performance metrics in Table 1, the maximum power density of the cell decreased from 39.5 mW cm−2 at 0.05 M to 24.4 mW cm−2 at 2 M. The potential at peak power also decreased with the increase in GlOH concentration. The excess GlOH and partially oxidized carbonyl compounds prevent the water co-adsorption required for stripping of CO from the electrode surface [2,3,5], which compromises the overall reaction. It is worth to note that although the efficiency of the half-cell reaction at the anode is unclear, the cell performance clearly depends on the glycerol concentration. Nevertheless, the peak power density output of 39.5 and 38.7 mW cm−2 found by using 0.05 and 0.1 M GlOH, respectively, are higher than for other μDGFCs coupled to the O2 reduction reaction reported to date [21,24]. This improvement is attributed to the use of mixed-media condition, which enables a cell potential window approximately twice higher than those found for all-alkaline media."
4,Fuel comparison in direct alcohol microfluidic fuel cells,"3.2 Fuel comparison in direct alcohol microfluidic fuel cells After the comprehensive investigation of the μDGFC, we compare its cell performance with those for the corresponding mixed media μDEFC and μDMFC with flow-through porous electrode configuration. The GlOH concentrations for the highest and lowest cell performance are used as benchmarks to select the MeOH and EgOH concentrations. Considering that the cell performance of the μDGFC fed by 1 and 2 M were similarly low, we use 1 M due to its more frequent use in the literature, which facilitates further comparisons, while 0.05 M GlOH is the reference concentration for high cell performance. The EgOH and MeOH concentrations are selected to match the same numbers of hydrated carbons participating in the anodic reaction. Therefore, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.15 M were used for GlOH, EgOH and MeOH representing the low concentration condition, whereas 1, 1.5 and 3 M were used for the GlOH, EgOH and MeOH high concentration condition, respectively. The polarization and power density curves of the μDAFC fed by alcohols in the low concentration condition are shown in Fig. 3 . Based on the previous results from GlOH, we used 400 μL min−1 as flow rate to alleviate oxygen mass transport limitations. The three cells display similar OCV of ∼1.2 V. The μDMFC and μDEFC show similar kinetic and ohmic limited polarization curves, while the cell fed by GlOH shows considerably increased cell performance. The μDMFC and μDEFC display a peak power density of ∼25 mW cm−2, which is 40% lower than that found for the μDGFC. These results are different from those found by Maya-Cornejo et al. [24], where a concentration of 0.1 M was fixed for all fuels. With equal fuel concentration, the μDMFC had the lowest peak power density followed by comparable peak power densities for the μDEFC and μDGFC [24]. This outcome is a direct consequence of the lower number of carbons available for methanol at this condition, rendering a disparately high influence of CO poisoning. Here, this constraint is surpassed by providing the same number of hydrated carbons for the anodic reactions, allowing a fair comparison of cell performance. The comparatively high cell performance achieved with the μDGFC at this condition is a consequence of a favorable balance between the use of a fuel with three hydrated carbons per molecule and the relatively low kinetic, ohmic and mass transport losses. This result evidences that glycerol, a bulk industrial waste product, can be a competitive fuel for μDAFCs when the system is appropriately engineered. On the other hand, at the high alcohol concentration condition, the μDMFC and μDEFC power densities are raised considerably compared to the low concentration condition, as depicted in Fig. 4 . In both cells, the increase in concentration increases the peak power density to 30 mW cm−2 at ∼570 mV. Thus, the μDAFC cell performance benefits by increasing MeOH and EgOH concentrations - at least under the experimental conditions investigated here, mainly due to improved mass transport. Improved performance at high MeOH concentration was previously observed by Liu et al. [24] by operating an air-breathing passive DMFC in the 1 M–5 M range [30]. An et al. reported a similar trend for a conventional DEFC [31] and claimed that low concentration of EgOH cannot supply sufficient reactant for high current densities, resulting in anode mass transport limited performance. However, very high concentration (3 M) may cover the active sites at the anode catalyst, which decreases its performance [31], similar to the μDGFC performance described in the previous section. Conversely, the μDGFC reveals the lowest power density in the high concentration case (Fig. 4). The use of concentrated GlOH results in a peak power density of ∼25 mW cm−2, which is 17% lower than for the μDMFC and μDEFC at the high concentration condition and 38% lower than the peak power density achieved with the same cell at the low concentration condition (Table 1). The diminished cell performance of the μDGFC is caused by the increased viscosity, higher cell resistance, limited mass transport and due to the limited ability of Pt surfaces to strip CO at the high fuel concentration condition. Therefore, the μDAFC cell performance is proportional to MeOH and EgOH concentration and inversely proportional to GlOH concentration. Fig. 5 shows the features of the peak power densities for the μDAFC fed by low and high fuel concentrations. It is evident that the cells fed by MeOH or EgOH have similar power densities at each of the low and high concentration conditions, given that the concentrations used are scaled according to the number of carbons in the molecules. On the contrary, the maximum power density of the μDGFC fed with 1 M GlOH (‘high concentration’) approximately matches the power density of the other cells operated on 0.15 M MeOH and 0.075 M EgOH (‘low concentration’), while 0.05 M GlOH (‘low concentration’) is needed to achieve high cell performance, similar to that of the μDMFC and μDEFC fed by 3 M and 1.5 M (‘high concentration’), respectively. In summary, we showed the practicality of using the same μDAFC with flow-through porous electrodes in mixed media condition fuelled by different biomass-derived alcohols at the anode coupled with oxygen reduction as a common, fixed model system at the cathode. Considering that a fuel-flexible μDAFC requires comparable power density at similar potentials regardless of the fuel used, we showed that the number of oxidizable carbons must be taken into account to feed the cell with MeOH and EgOH, which can be achieved by controlling the alcohol concentrations. Special attention must be given when feeding the fuel-flexible μDAFC with GlOH at high concentrations, since the anode may experience poisoning effects and mass transport limitations while the increased viscosity leads to high cell resistance, decreasing the cell performance. Specifically, we found that the fuel-flexible μDAFC can be interchangeably fed by 3 M MeOH, 1.5 M EgOH or 0.05 M GlOH in order to achieve a consistently high peak power density output of 30–40 mW cm−2 at a cell potential range of 570–640 mV. These results evidence the potential practical application of the fuel-flexible μDAFC fed by biomass-derived fuels to provide energy for low-power devices. In order to transit towards optimized efficient low-cost μDAFCs, the next challenge is to replace the Pt catalysts at one or both electrodes by electroactive materials with negligible cost."
5,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated the feasibility of a fuel-flexible mixed media microfluidic direct alcohol fuel cell with flow-through porous electrodes. Renewable biomass-derived methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol were found to be interchangeable as fuels in an otherwise identical fuel cell configuration using a common oxygen cathode. The fuel-flexible system is achieved by coupling alcohol electrooxidation in alkaline medium to oxygen electroreduction in acidic medium catalyzed by Pt/C-modified carbon paper to convert energy. By comparing cells fed by different glycerol concentrations, it was discovered that high glycerol concentrations are deleterious for the anodic half-cell reaction in the cell with electrodes in flow-through configuration, compromising the output power due to poisoning effects, mass transport limitations and high cell resistance cause by increased viscosity. On the other hand, the use of low glycerol concentrations enables a microfluidic fuel cell with prominent overall performance by overcoming said issues. Although the understanding of the glycerol electrooxidation reaction is complex and still unknown, the relatively high number of electrons theoretically available per glycerol molecule further implies that adequate energy density can be maintained even with low fuel concentrations. Comparable cell performance was achieved by feeding the fuel-flexible microfluidic fuel cells with ethylene glycol or methanol wherein each individual concentration was set to provide the same number of oxidizable carbons at the anode half-cell. Furthermore, an increase in the concentration of these two fuels improved the cell performance accordingly. Interestingly, the output power density of the cells fuelled by high concentration methanol or ethylene glycol is comparable to that of the cell fed by low glycerol concentration. Maximum power densities in a range of 30–40 mW cm−2 at 570–640 mV cell voltage were reached by feeding the microfluidic fuel cells with 3 M methanol, 1.5 M ethylene glycol or 0.05 M glycerol. Therefore, it is possible to exchange the fuel for the same microfluidic fuel cell in accordance with their availability and still produce comparable power output. Here, we investigated all cells by using Pt/C nanoparticles dispersed on carbon paper. Nevertheless, low-cost multi-metallic catalysts immobilized on advanced carbon supports specifically active for each anodic half-cell reaction could be explored in order to improve kinetics and by extension the overall performance at minimal cost."
