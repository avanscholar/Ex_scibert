0,Introduction,"Industrial development during the last centuries has made a leap in the progress of human life. However, recently, the alarming effects of this development on the environment is being appeared dramatically (Dincer and Rosen, 2012; Akalin et al., 2012). Climate change and energy security are among the most important concerns of the recent era (Jones and Warner, 2016; Shoja et al., 2013). Production of energy carriers with a minimum carbon content in the combustion process would be promising (Ali et al., 2013). Moreover, availability and renewability of the primary resources are crucial. In the recent decade, extensive research has been carried out on the production of gaseous and liquid energy carriers from bio-renewable resources (Krishnan and McCalley, 2016). Biomass feedstocks are rich in carbon and hydrogen and can be converted into valuable fuels and chemicals (Phillips et al., 2016). However, agricultural wastes as the second generation of feedstocks are dependent on landing availability and have some competition with food production (Guragain et al., 2016). The third generation of feedstock may overcome the shortcomings associated to the first and second generation feedstocks. Utilization of algal biomass instead of other terrestrial feedstocks can reduce the land use and water consumption in the cycle of bioenergy production (Savage, 2012; Singh et al., 2011). Macroalgae do not require land or fresh water for cultivation (Vassilev and Vassileva, 2016). In the estimation of Chung et al. (2011), cultivation of macroalgae along the coastlines can annually capture one billion tons of carbon. However, a lower amount of carbohydrates may results in lower value products compared with agricultural wastes but, the presence of lipid and protein in the macroalgae and lower amount of lignin in their structure can make the conversion process much easier and less energy intensive (Safari et al., 2016a). C. glomerata has a widespread distribution in Caspian Sea Coast, which results in environmental damages and are a cause of a eutrophication of the water (Soltani et al., 2014). Thus, there is a big social demand to explore an efficient and cost effective process for conversion of this bio-resource (Mihranyan, 2011). Holistic analysis of the Pyrolysis products of C. glomerata as a widespread green alga has not been investigated before. Plis et al. (2015) studied the thermochemical properties of this strain for possible conversion to value-added product. Due to the high content of volatile matter, pyrolysis process was strongly recommended for producing liquid and gaseous fuels. The liquid bio-oil from pyrolysis of algae is CO2 neutral and environment-friendly. However, the crude bio-oil can be upgraded via a catalytic process for the production of transportation fuel. In addition, the syngas derived from pyrolysis can be applied for both hydrogen and power production in the industry (Jafarian et al., 2016; Safari et al., 2016b). And to date, various bio-chars, particularly those derived from terrestrial biomass have been applied as a soil amendment, water treatment, and fertilizer (de la Rosa et al., 2014). However, studies using bio-char as a catalyst in biomass pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading have been lacking. Ren et al. (2014) investigated the effects of Corn stover bio-char as a catalyst in biomass catalytic pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading. Recently, the use of algal bio-char has gained extensive attention for various applications because marine macroalgae are massively abundant and bio-char converted from this source has a relatively high porosity and surface area, and it contains higher ash and functional groups on the surface than the bio-char that derived from terrestrial biomass (Jung et al., 2016). These properties make the algal bio-char interesting as catalyst support and catalyst. No published data corresponding to investigating the effects of algal bio-char as a catalyst for the production of bio-oil, syngas, and bio-char through pyrolysis of macroalgae is available. Several studies on pyrolysis of algal biomass have been reported in the literature, including Microcystis sp. and S. platensis (Li et al., 2012). Omoriyekomwan et al. (2016) reported microwave pyrolysis of palm kernel shell using activated carbon (AC) and lignite char (LC) as catalysts. The maximum concentration of phenol in bio-oil was 64.58 (%Area). Yildiz et al. (2015) investigated the effect of biomass ash on the fast pyrolysis of pinewood. The presence of inorganic compounds on the ash promoted the conversion of phenols and suppressed the conversion of sugars and acids. Song Hu et al. (2015) reported the effect of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) on the promotion of hydrogen via an increase in the absorption of H2O molecule. These mineral nutrients are a part of the biomass structure, bound at hydroxyl and/or phenolic groups in the form of cations or as a salt. In this study, the focus has been given on upgrading of bio-oil and improvement of hydrogen-rich gas production through pyrolysis of C. glomerata via the addition of its bio-char as a catalyst. C. glomerata offers a promising feedstock for production bio-energy using thermochemical technology. In the previous work of the authors, it was shown that Enteromorpha intestinalis as a Caspian Sea macroalgae had a great potential for hydrogen production (Norouzi et al., 2016). In this study, another major algal biomass of southern coast of Caspian Sea was investigated to determine its potential for hydrogen-rich gas and bio-oil production. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous work in the literature on the detailed and holistic investigation of the pyrolysis of C. glomerata macroalgae. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of bio-char on the conversion of macroalgae to gaseous and liquid products. The main novel investigation of the current study were to: • Holistic characterization of C. glomerata as widespread macroalgae found in the Caspian Sea coast of Iran. • Investigate of the gaseous, liquid and solid products of C. glomerata as a third generation bioresource for the first time to determine it potential for further technical development. • Characterize and utilize the pyrolysis derived solid bio-char of C. glomerata as a catalyst for enhancement in Hydrogen production and upgrading the bio-oil."
1,Material and methods,
2,Feedstock preparation,"2.1 Feedstock preparation The selected macroalgae used in the present study was C. glomerata, which was collected from Sisangan area located in Southern Caspian Sea coast, Iran, where a stable coverage was found. It was dried under atmospheric conditions for 48h and ground to the particle size <150μm in diameter."
3,Feedstock characterization,"2.2 Feedstock characterization The proximate analysis for determination of volatile matter and moisture content of the C. glomerata was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The experiments were carried out by feeding the algae to a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA/SDTA851 and METTLER-TOLEDO compact). The tested conditions were controlled under the nitrogen atmosphere at the temperatures in the range of 30–900°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. The temperature was kept constant for 5min before increasing it up to 900°C at a rate of 100°Cmin−1 for measurement of ash content the method of Sluiter et al. (2008), was adapted to biochar samples. Briefly, after drying at 105°C for 5h, the samples were placed in a porcelain crucible and heated in a muffle furnace at 575±25°C for 24±6h to constant weight in a muffle furnace. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Fixed carbon was calculated via Eq. (1). (1) Fixed carbon % = 100 - Ash % - volatile matter % - moisture % The elemental analysis of the biomass sample was performed using a CHNS analyzer (Vario ELIII by Elementar, Germany). Also, the percentage of oxygen was determined through the balance via Eq. (2). (2) O % = 100 - C % - H % - N % - S % - Ash % The amount of protein in the sample was recognized in accordance with National Standard in China GB/T 6432-1994 by the method of Kjeldahl, while the amount of lipid was determined via the method of solvent extraction in accordance with National Standard in China GB/T 6433-2006 (Zhao et al., 2015). Carbohydrate content was calculated by mass balance method by Eq. (3). (3) Carbohydrate % = 100 - Protein % - lipid % - ash % In order to determine the physical properties of the raw C. glomerata, surface analysis and porous textural analysis of the material was measured by an ASAP-2010 system from micromeritics. The samples were degassed at 200°C for 4h under 50mTorr vacuum and their BET area and pore volume were determined."
4,Experimental setup and procedure,"2.3 Experimental setup and procedure Fig. 1 , shows the reaction setup. As shown, the reaction was performed in a fixed bed reactor made of a quartz glass tube with 800mm long and 10mm internal diameter. Quartz wool, feed, and catalyst bed were fixed in the center of the reactor. The reactor was located inside a tubular furnace with 20mm ID and 200mm OD with the total heating length of 700mm. The furnace temperature was controlled using an electrical heater and a PID temperature controller and measured using a K-type thermocouple. Argon was used as inert carrier gas with exactly 30ml/min flow rate using mass flow controller. The reaction products included char, gas and bio-oil compounds. The bio-oil was collected in a liquid trap of ice-salt bath and the gaseous fraction was collected over a sodium chloride saturated brine solution in a graduated column and the char remained in the center of the reactor. For the catalytic tests, the biochar obtained from the pyrolysis at the optimum condition, were used as a catalyst. This biochar was blended as a catalyst with biomass sample and fed into the reactor. After the catalytic process, the certain amount of the collected biochar (equals to the non-catalytic biochar) was added back to the reactor for the next experiment. To better understanding of the process and clarifying the method of this study. This process is self-promoted by giving a feedback from its own products. 1 g of C. glomerata is dried first, and then, sieved and chopped for pyrolysis. The process starts with non-catalytic pyrolysis which the amount of the obtained bio-char is 0.4g. Then, catalytic pyrolysis in the presence of this bio-char is carried out. Catalytic process results in 0.75g overall bio-char (0.4g as a catalyst and 0.35 from the process). In this case, 0.4g of bio-char is added back to the reactor as a catalyst each time, and the remaining, which is equal to 0.35g, is collected for further usage such as soil amendment. For carbon balance, the amount of carbon in the bio-oil and biochar was analyzed by a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu, TOC-L) and a CHNS analyzer, respectively. Moreover, the amount of carbon in the gas phase was calculated as the total moles of carbon in carbon-containing gaseous products in mass basis."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The volume of collected gasses was measured from the displacement of the solution in the column. The quality and quantity of produced gaseous mixture were analyzed using gas chromatography technique (Varian 3400 and Teyfgostar-Compact). The bio-oil in glass condenser and char left inside the reactor were measured by measuring the difference in weights of glass condenser and reactor before and after the reaction. Considering the small reactor volume and feedstock quantity added into the system, reported data are the averages of several observations for each experiment in order to make results more statistically confident. Also, the accuracy of data collection and comparison between means of compositions and yields from the processing of two samples was studied through ANOVA (analysis of variance). The statistical level was 5% with p<0.05. 2.4.1 Gaseous product analysis Gas samples were taken by tight syringes and injected into Gas chromatograph’s column. A gas chromatograph (Varian 3400 and Teyfgostar-Compact) had been equipped with PORAPAK Q-S 80/100 (30m long, 0.53mm I.D) column, a methanizer and Flame Ionization Detector (FID). Argon was used as carrier gas and oven temperature program was in the following: 40°C isothermal for 5min, an increase in the temperature from 40 to 75°C in 17.5min and isothermal in 75°C for 5min. The methanizer option enables the FID to detect levels of CO and CO2. During analysis, methanizer is heated to 380°C with the FID detector body. When the column effluent mixes with the FID hydrogen supply and passes through the methanizer, CO and CO2 are converted to methane. GC was calibrated with standard gas mixture supplied by Roham Company in Tehran, Iran. The standard deviation for the results of gas composition was calculated to be ±2%. 2.4.2 Liquid product analysis The chemical composition of bio-oil was analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Agilent Technology (HP)). An HP-5 column (30m×0.25mm i.d., 0.25μm film thickness) was applied to the analysis. Helium (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1mLmin−1. The oven temperature was programmed from 50 to 250°C at the heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. MS was conducted under the following operational conditions: transfer line 23°C, ion source 230°C, and electron energy 70eV. 2.4.3 Solid product analysis Biochar derived from pyrolysis of C. glomerata, was elementally analyzed by a CHNS analyzer. Also, a Field Emission Scanning Electro Microscope (FESEM – MIRA3 LM, Tuscan), provided by Nanostructure and coating Lab, Sharif university of technology, was used for scanning the morphology of the surface for raw feedstock and bio-char. Coating of the sample is required in the field of electron microscopy to enable and improve the imaging of samples. All samples in this study were coated with a thin layer of gold to create a conductive layer of metal which inhibits charging, reduce thermal damage and improve the secondary electron signal required for topographic characterization. The surface area, total pore volume of the C. glomerata bio-char were determined as mentioned in Section 2.2."
6,Data interpretation,"2.5 Data interpretation Concentration of different pyrolysis products has been presented in terms of volume concentration which is presented by Eq. (4): (4) Concentration ( v / v % ) = Volume of the intended Product ( Total volume of the pyrolysis product ) In order to determine the heating value of the raw C. glomerata and its bio-char, the higher heating value (HHV) was calculated through Eq. (5) as below (Ly et al., 2015): (5) HHV Mj kg = { 33.5 × C + 142.3 × H - 15.4 × O - 14.5 × N } × 0.01 Hydrogen selectivity was also calculated through following Eq. (6) for performance analysis of hydrogen-rich gas production via Pyrolysis of macroalgae. (6) Hydrogen Selectivity = ( Concentration of H 2 ) ( Concentration of other gasses ) Carbon liquefaction efficiency (CLE), Carbon solidification efficiency (CSE) and Carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) are mentioned below as Eqs. (7)–(9) to obtain the total carbon balance (Norouzi et al., 2016; Safari et al., 2016a) (7) CLE = ( Carbon in aqueous products ) ( Carbon in Cladophora ) (8) CSE = ( Carbon in solid residues ) ( Carbon in Cladophora ) (9) CGE = ( Carbon in gaseous products ) ( Carbon in Cladophora ) (10) Carbon balance = CGE + CLE + CSE"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Results,"3.1 Results 3.1.1 Biomass characterization The elemental analysis of C. glomerata was carried out to determine the weight percentage of each element. The results were as follows: 34.4wt% C, 5wt% H, 5.2wt% N, 2.3wt% S, 18.6wt% O. The heating value of the C. glomerata is about 14.97MJ/kg and is relatively high compared to other agricultural residues (Nanda et al., 2016). The TGA curves and DTG (Fig. 2 ) shows that the thermal decomposition of C. glomerata occurs in three steps. The first stage occurs in the 30–200°C which corresponds for the drying, and slight volatile release. The second stage of decomposition, ranging from 200 to 500°C with the major weight loss (46%), is associated to the major pyrolysis in which devolatilization takes place. And the last stage corresponds to solid residue. The main three picks in DTG diagram are corresponding to the water and water loosely bound to biomolecules (46°C), thermal cracking of protein and carbohydrates (270°C) and lipids non-extracted (360°C), respectively. The percent of light volatiles for the C. glomerata is 46.31wt%. Finally, the third stage from 500 to 800°C correspond to the ulterior decomposition of the forming bio-char. The results for proximate analysis were: 4.5wt% moisture, 34.5wt.% ash, 46.3wt% volatile matter, 14.7wt% fixed carbon, 27.8wt% protein, 5.3wt% lipid, and 32.4wt% carbohydrate. Also, the results of the BET surface area of C. glomerata was 0.15m2 g−1 and the total pore volume was 0.0028cm3 g−1. 3.1.2 Non-catalytic tests 3.1.2.1 Product distribution analysis Pyrolysis products are gaseous, bio-oil and bio-char. The char and bio-oil were quantified and the yields of gaseous products were calculated by difference. Pyrolysis temperature varied from 400 to 600°C in order to determine the effect of temperature on the pyrolytic conversion of C. glomerata into gaseous, liquid and solid products and their distributions among the total products while the reaction time and the feed content were fixed at 30min and 1g, respectively. Moreover, the optimum temperature at which the bio-oil portion of pyrolysis process is maximum was determined. As shown in Table 1 , by increasing the temperature from 400 to 600°C, the gas portion increased steadily and the char portion kept declining. The highest gas portion obtained in this study was equaled to 28wt% which occurred at 600°C while The highest char yield for C. glomerata was 44wt% at 400°C. The highest portion of char was observed mostly at the lower temperatures, whereas the highest yield of gas was observed mostly at the temperatures above the 500°C. Besides, the highest portion of bio-oil for C. glomerata was equal to 39wt% at the 500°C. The influence of the temperature on the distribution of pyrolytic products from macroalgae was similar to previous observations with lignocellulosic biomass and also other microalgae (Li et al., 2012; Maddi et al., 2011). It was possible that the higher ash content and lower volatile content in algal biomass led to greater char formation but less oil production (Maddi et al., 2011). 3.1.2.2 Gaseous product analysis The main gaseous products produced from pyrolysis of C. glomerata were H2, CH4, CO and CO2 which are shown by their concentration in Table 1. By increasing the temperature of pyrolysis, The H2 concentration from C. glomerata was increased by a factor of 2.6. It is reported that depolymerization of phenyl groups in lignin, dehydrogenation reactions and also Protein degradation are favored at a higher temperature (Al-Rahbi et al., 2016). Hence, H2 can be produced as a result of these reactions during pyrolysis. Moreover, it is mentioned that secondary reactions such as tar cracking are promoted in higher temperatures which result in more H2 production. CH4 yield during pyrolysis of C. glomerata is commonly increased with increasing temperature by the factor of 1.5. The production of methane can be associated with the cracking of lignin and formation of methoxy groups which results in the cleaving of CC bonds. As seen in Table 1, the concentration of CO2 was decreased by increasing the temperature. CO2 as the main component of the gaseous product is generally originated from carbohydrates and protein which is in agreement with the results of Yuan et al. (2015). 3.1.2.3 Liquid product analysis The bio-oil was affected by pyrolysis temperature. The highest Bio-oil portion of 39wt% was obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 500°C. Hence, this condition was selected as a representative experiment to analyze the bio-oil composition. The bio-oil produced from non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of macroalgae at the temperature of 500°C was collected and subjected to GC–MS analysis to determine its contained components. The identified compounds are given in Tables 2 . The nitrogenous products (29% area), were the most prevalent in the pyrolysis of macroalgae. As expected, pyrolysis of high-protein biomass formed a nitrogen containing liquid range products. The acids are the second major compounds identified in the bio-oil with the selectivity of 28.6area% which contains 26.88area% of acetic acid. This compound can be utilized in microalgae cultivation with the potential of producing lipid-based biofuel (Liang et al., 2013). Phenol and its derivatives (8.5area%), was detected in the pyrolysis of C. glomerata. Despite the lower amount of lignin in algae compared with agricultural waste which tends to produce less phenol, the protein content of algae and decomposition of oxygenate compounds results in phenols production. The phenol can be used to resin production, additives in fertilizing and pharmaceutical industries, flavoring agents (such as glycolaldehyde) in food industries and other special chemicals (Kim, 2015). 3.1.2.4 Solid product analysis Different analysis has been done to determine the physical and chemical properties of bio-char for its further application. As we know, bio-char can be used for many applications. Porous bio-char can be utilized as a carbon activated material for using as a catalyst support for enhancement in hydrogen production and upgrading of bio oil (Yao et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2014). The Presence of some alkali metals in the biochar promises a versatile material for using as a catalyst for enhancing the rate of the reactions. According to the ICP analysis, a number of AAEMs are as follows: 10.4wt% Ca, 24.7% K, 7.8wt% Mg, 14.8wt% Na. Elemental composition of biochar was also carried out and the results were: 45.4wt% C, 1.1wt% H, 3.7wt% N, 1.7wt% S, 8.4wt% O and 39.7wt% ash. The results of the BET surface area of bio-char was 42.4m2 g−1 and the total pore volume was 0.0386cm3 g−1. As shown, the weight percentage of carbon content of C. glomerata bio-char is increased while the hydrogen content is decreased compared with the raw C. glomerata. This cause a higher heating value of 17.19MJ/kg which promises an upgraded solid fuel. On the other hand, the BET surface area of 42.4m2/g and the total pore volume of 0.0386m3/g, which are much higher than that of raw C. glomerata, shows the high porosity of bio-char. This significant increase in the surface area and total pore volume of feedstock after pyrolysis are in strong agreement with previous results in the literature (Jung et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016). The formation of pores in the bio-char investigated by FESEM method. According to the FESEM analysis, numerous pores spread all over the surfaces of the bio-char. These large pores originate from the vascular structure of the raw biomass. The thermal decomposition of volatile matter has left the cell walls which results in the formation of pores in the surface (Usman et al., 2015). 3.1.3 Algal bio-char as a catalyst According to the results of non-catalytic experiments, the optimum temperature in the terms of bio-oil yield in pyrolysis of C. glomerata was 500°C. Therefore, this pyrolysis conditions was selected as a representative experiment to analyze product compositions and catalytic tests were performed in this condition to observe the effect of an algal bio-char catalyst on the pyrolysis products. Results from pyrolysis experiments are presented in Table 3 . In this study, the algal bio-char catalyst significantly influenced the product concentrations and distributions. 3.1.3.1 Effect of the algal bio-char on the product distribution As seen in Table 3, the addition of algal bio-char as a catalyst improved the portion of gaseous products from 22 to 35% among the whole product. However, the solid and liquid portion decreased slightly to the 35% and 30%, respectively. This effect may be associated with the more degradation of volatiles in the presence of porous structure with the high surface area which accelerates the reactions to form gaseous products. It is known that the biochar has variable amounts of inorganic ash in the form of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) which have been suggested to catalytic activity in carbon conversion (Yildiz et al., 2015). This catalytic effect of AAEMS was mainly because of the increase of water molecule and also the hydrocarbon volatiles which have been decomposed by oxygen-containing functional groups presented in biochar. In addition to AAEMS, some transition metals such as Iron exist inside the biomass. Despite the cracking behavior of the Fe, the presence of it as iron oxide on the biochar surface results in low catalytic reactivity of this metal (Mahadevan et al., 2016). 3.1.3.2 Effect of algal bio-char on the gas composition The effect of the algal bio-char on the composition of pyrolysis products at the temperature of 500°C is shown in Table 3. The addition of bio-char as a catalyst increased the total gas concentration from 22% to 37%. Noticeable differences in the concentrations of CO2 and H2 between catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis were observed but there were no significant changes in the production rate of CO and CH4. Therefore, by adding catalyst the CO2 concentration decreased from 56.08% to 47.09% and H2 production increased from 27% to 37%. Enhancement of reaction activity by addition of bio-char can be explained by results of BET and FESEM. The existence of numerous pores all over the surfaces of bio-char can provide surface reaction causing further decomposition of complicated structure biomass (Brewer et al., 2009). 3.1.3.3 Effect of the algal bio-char on the hydrogen selectivity Hydrogen selectivity increased by the increasing of Temperature. The highest hydrogen selectivity of 0.59 was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C. In addition, in the presence of algal bio-char at the temperature of 500°C, H2 selectivity increased slightly due to the catalytic effect of algal bio-char. 3.1.3.4 Effect of the algal bio-char on the bio-oil quality The composition of bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis of C. glomerata and its blends with algal bio-char as a catalyst is shown in Table 2. As seen in Fig. 3 , the addition of algal bio-char as a catalyst results in producing more interesting compounds. This part has been focused on some noteworthy compounds based on the functional groups such as acids, phenols, ketones, N-compounds, furans and alcohols, in the terms of area%. As seen in Fig. 3, the main effect of bio-char on the bio-oil component is the decrement in acids (28.55–23.09% for C. glomerata) which is followed by a decrease in ketones which could be in association with the ketonization reactions, in which acids in the pyrolysis vapor convert to ketones (Liu et al., 2014). Moreover, the phenols were increased with the addition of algal bio-char catalyst (8.5–20.76%). The furans content of the bio-oil from C. glomerata was found to decrease from 3% to 2.1% with the addition of bio-char. This effect can be attributed to the presence of alkali metals (K, Na), which was reported earlier by Mahadevan et al. (2016) this effect can be associated with decarbonylation and oligomerization reactions to produce olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of bio-char as a catalyst (Mahadevan et al., 2015). These results were in agreement with those reported in the literature (Ren et al., 2014). 3.1.3.5 Carbon balance Results for carbon conversion in each phase of products has been given in Table 4 . As seen, the conversion of carbon into the liquid phase has been improved by the increase of temperature. Also, conversion of carbon into gas phase was enhanced by the addition of biochar due to its catalytic behavior. Carbon balance of a total carbon conversion efficiency was closed in 94–98%."
9,Conclusion,"C. glomerata as green macroalgae of Caspian Sea showed a promising performance for production of bio-oil and hydrogen. Non-catalytic Pyrolysis of this green macroalgae resulted in acid-rich bio-oil while the addition of its bio-char as a catalyst promoted the production of phenolics. In addition algal, bio-char enhanced the hydrogen production and hydrogen selectivity. FESEM, BET and ICP analysis demonstrated the porous structure and the presence of AAEMs in the bio-char which makes it suitable for utilization as a catalyst or catalyst support in the industry."
