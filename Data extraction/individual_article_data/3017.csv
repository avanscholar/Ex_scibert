1,Energy and transport fuel,"1.1 Energy and transport fuel Global primary energy consumption in 2013 has reached 535EJ (or 12,730Mtoe equivalent); this is an increase of 28% when compared with 2003, almost double the figure compared with 1978. Fossil fuels were still the dominant energy source in 2013, accounting for 87% of total primary consumption (BP, 2014). Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel utilisation have resulted in serious environmental problems, such as climate change, rise in sea level and biodiversity loss (Nigam and Singh, 2011). On a global scale, the conversion ratio from primary energy to final energy is 1.49 (IEA, 2014). About one-third of final energy consumption is associated with transport, the resources of which are dominated by liquid fuels (i.e., petrol and diesel) (IEA, 2014; Murphy et al., 2013). Gaseous fuels play an increasingly important role nowadays: in excess of 17 million natural gas vehicles (NGVs) exist, with an annual energy consumption of 2.7EJ (or 63.5Mtoe equivalent), predominately in developing countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Iran and Pakistan (NGVA Europe, 2013)."
2,Role of biofuels,"1.2 Role of biofuels The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive states that 10% of energy in transport should be renewable by 2020 (European Union, 2009). Biofuels, which are predominantly produced from biomass, may play a major role for renewable energy supply in transport (Allen et al., 2014; Nigam and Singh, 2011). Biofuels, such as biogas, biomethanol, bioethanol and biodiesel, are considered an alternative to fossil fuels in the future because they can reduce transport emissions and increase the security of supply (Nigam and Singh, 2011). In 2008, biofuels provided about 21% of road transport fuels in Brazil, 4% of road transport fuels in the United States, and 3% of road transport fuels in the EU. The International Energy Agency (IEA) suggested that biofuels can provide 27% of global transport fuel (equal to 32EJ) by 2050; meanwhile, the global bioenergy potential of “low-risk” biomass feedstocks may reach 475EJ (IEA, 2011). 1.2.1 Generations of biofuels Biofuels may be classified into three different generations, depending on biomass feedstock (see Table 1 ). The first generation biofuels can also be called conventional biofuels, and they are mainly obtained from food crops and edible oil seeds; their technologies are mature and relatively inexpensive (Kiran et al., 2014a; Nigam and Singh, 2011). However, first generation biofuels draw wide criticism because of their competition with food and fibre production, as well as large consumption of fertiliser and fresh water. Excess production of first generation biofuels will significantly increase food prices (Kiran et al., 2014a). Second generation biofuels are mainly produced from lignocellulosic biomass, non-edible oil seeds and waste streams (Nigam and Singh, 2011). They have the advantages of having less food crop competition. In many developing countries, waste lignocellulosic residues such as straws are traditionally burned in the fields, which may result in serious air pollution. Conversion of waste lignocellulosic residues to biofuels via clean technologies would be beneficial for the environment. Lignocellulosic biomass may need energy-intensive pre-treatments prior to the first generation biofuel production stage (Zheng et al., 2014). Therefore, the energy requirements for second generation biofuels can be higher than those for first generation biofuels. Meanwhile, the energy cost in the production of substrates in second generation processes may be low compared with food crops (e.g., costs in ploughing, fertilising and harvesting). Second generation biofuels may be cheaper than first generation biofuels, if the capital costs and more complex pre-treatment processes can be offset by the cheap substrate resources. However, second generation biofuels may not be commercially available by 2020, either because of their techniques or costs (Murphy et al., 2015). Third generation biofuels are mainly derived from algae (Dutta et al., 2014). Algae, which can be classified as microalgae and macroalgae (seaweeds), are known for high photosynthesis efficiencies and productivities, thereby resulting in lower area requirements compared with land-based plants, such as maize, corn and switch grass (Demirbas, 2010; Dismukes et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2015c). Algae can be cultivated in non-freshwater sources, such as salt water and seawater on non-arable land, and do not compete with common food resources (Jones and Mayfieldt, 2012). Furthermore, algal cultivation combining wastewater and flue gas treatment shows significant environmental benefits in pollutant reduction. Algae can provide extremely versatile biofuels because their organic components (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) can be easily changed and controlled by various species and cultivation conditions (Jones and Mayfieldt, 2012). EU legislation requires that first generation biofuels should not exceed 6% of final energy consumption in transport by 2020 (European Parliament, 2013). A draft law, which states advanced biofuels sourced from seaweed or certain types of waste should account for at least 1.25% of energy consumption in transport by 2020, has been recently approved by the Environment Committee of EU (European Parliament, 2015). This law would significantly boost the development of third generation biofuels. Currently, high cost and energy consumption in cultivation and harvesting are the main constraints for algal biofuels. Commercially viable production of third generation algal biofuels is dependent on effective strategies to produce high-volume and low-cost biofuels coupled with high-value co-products (IEA, 2011; Xia et al., 2015c). 1.2.2 Gaseous biofuels The GHG balance has been considered an important indicator of biofuel system sustainability (Murphy and Thamsiriroj, 2011). The EU Renewable Energy Directive states that future biofuel systems should have at least 60% GHG savings compared with the fossil fuel replacement (European Union, 2009). As shown in Table 2 , sugarcane ethanol shows a high GHG saving of 71% as compared to other liquid biofuel systems (European Union, 2009); however, sugarcane can only provide a significant crop resource per hectare in tropical climates, but not in temperate climates. The biogas from waste streams, which combines waste treatment and biofuel production, has a “double” effect on GHG reduction (Borjesson and Mattiasson, 2008; Romano and Zhang, 2011). For instance, biogas production from wet manure is particularly effective in GHG saving (up to 180%) because it not only reduces the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but also reduces the emission of methane produced during manure storage (Borjesson and Mattiasson, 2008). The GHG balance can be improved through: using wastes and residues as substrates; maximising land-use efficiency via increasing productivities of energy crops; enhancing energy efficiency of the process; reducing process based emissions; and by cascade utilisation of biomass via biorefinery concepts (IEA, 2011). Furthermore, gaseous biofuels may have additional advantages over liquid biofuels. • The energy efficiency of converting a substrate to gaseous biofuel is far superior than the conversion of the same substrate to liquid fuel, specifically for third generation algal biofuels (Borjesson and Mattiasson, 2008; Power and Murphy, 2009; Stephenson et al., 2010). • The local air quality is less damaged by NGVs than vehicles using liquid fuels (Murphy et al., 2013). • The existing natural gas grid system can act as a distribution system for gaseous biofuels (Uusitalo et al., 2014)."
3,Biogas for transport,"1.3 Biogas for transport Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion (AD) of various biomass feedstocks, such as dedicated energy crops, algal biomass, food wastes, animal manure, agricultural residues, industrial wastes and organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSWs), can be renewable and sustainable energy sources (Gissen et al., 2014; IEA Bioenergy, 2014; Linke et al., 2015; Murto et al., 2013; Oechsner et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014). The biogas industry has rapidly developed in recent years, specifically in EU and Asian countries (Oechsner et al., 2015). Within the EU, the majority of the biogas plants have been built in Germany (IEA Bioenergy, 2014). A total of 7960 biogas plants, with a total installed electric capacity of 3804MW, are in operation in Germany in 2014 (see Fig. 1 ) (German Biogas Association, 2014). The annual biogas production potential in Germany by 2020 will be 418PJ (or 116TWh), mainly from energy crops (252PJ), crop residues and animal manure (104PJ) and OFMSW (47PJ) (IEA Bioenergy, 2014). In China, approximately 31 million biogas digesters have been built by 2010; these are dominated by small-scale household digesters (Bruun et al., 2014). In 2009, the annual biogas output from household digesters reached 12.4billionm3 (295PJ) (Jiang et al., 2011). Household biogas is the dominant biofuel produced in China (Song et al., 2014). China plans to increase the number of household digesters to 80 million by 2020 (Bruun et al., 2014). The number of medium and large-scale biogas plants is relatively small, but it is rapidly growing. In 2010, approximately 27,000 biogas plants with an annual biogas yield of 1billionm3 (24PJ) mainly sourced from agricultural and industrial wastes are in operation in China (Jiang et al., 2011; Song et al., 2014). Biogas can be used as an energy source for various applications, such as heat, electricity, flare and vehicle fuel (Weiland, 2006). Currently, most of the produced biogas is used for heat and/or electricity production (see Table 3 ) (Borjesson and Mattiasson, 2008; IEA Bioenergy, 2014). The use of biogas as a transport fuel is receiving increased attention (Borjesson and Mattiasson, 2008). Sweden has taken the leading role in biogas utilisation in transport; over 50% of biogas was used in transport in 2012 (IEA Bioenergy, 2014). Interest and significant developments have also emerged in other countries, such as Switzerland, Germany, China, US, France, Spain and Austria (Borjesson and Mattiasson, 2008). This paper reviews the developments of fermentative biogas production and its transformation to a transport fuel; it focuses on state of the art and proposed innovations. Conventional biogas production and upgrading processes are reviewed and alternative processes are highlighted. The potential and challenges of biogas as a transport fuel are discussed."
4,Fermentation for biogas generation,
5,Single-stage fermentation for methane production,"2.1 Single-stage fermentation for methane production 2.1.1 AD process AD (or methane fermentation) comprises four stages (hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis), which convert organic substrates into metabolites mainly composed of methane and carbon dioxide, as well as some heat, through a complex microbial community of bacteria and archaea (see Fig. 2 ) (Angenent et al., 2004; Saady, 2013; Xia et al., 2015c). Each stage plays a different role during AD (Drapcho et al., 2008; Lauwers et al., 2013; Wellinger et al., 2013): • Hydrolysis: degradation of complex high-molecular-weight organic macromolecules into low-molecular-weight monomers. The active genera in hydrolysis include Lactobacillus, Sporobacterium, Bacteroides, etc. • Acidogenesis: conversion of soluble monomers to various metabolic products, including (a) gaseous metabolic products, such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and (b) soluble metabolic products (SMPs), such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols. The active genera in acidogenesis include Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Paenibacillus, etc. • Acetogenesis: conversion of products from acidogenesis to acetic acid and hydrogen. The active genera in acetogenesis include Aminobacterium, Acidaminococcus, Desulfovibrio, etc. • Methanogenesis: methane production by (a) hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea via consumption of hydrogen and carbon dioxide and (b) aceticlastic methanogenic archaea via consumption of acetic acid. The active genera in methanogenesis include Methanobacterium, Methanosphaera, Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta, Methanobrevibacter, etc. A well-operated AD process requires the rates from all stages to be balanced. For instance, if the acidogenesis stage runs too fast, the VFA concentration significantly increases, and the pH quickly drops below 7, thereby resulting in the inhibition of methanogenic microorganisms. In this case the methanogenesis stage will be rate limiting. However, if the later stage runs too fast, the whole process is limited by the hydrolysis stage (Weiland, 2010). Therefore, the rate-limiting stage depends on the substrate type. Insoluble organic components, such as fats, proteins and cellulose, are slowly degraded to monomers within a few days; AD of such substrates is usually limited by the hydrolysis stage. Meanwhile, the hydrolysis of soluble carbohydrates is usually carried out within several hours, making methanogenesis a rate-limiting stage (Borjesson and Mattiasson, 2008; Lauwers et al., 2013; Weiland, 2010). 2.1.2 Theoretical biogas yield A modified Buswell equation (Eq. (1)) can be used for biogas potential calculations based on the main compositions of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen (Angelidaki and Sanders, 2004; Buswell and Neave, 1930; Sialve et al., 2009). (1) C a H b N c O d + a + 3 4 c − b 4 − d 2 H 2 O → a 2 + 3 8 c + d 4 − b 8 b C O 2 + c N H 3 + a 2 + b 8 − 3 8 c − d 4 C H 4 This equation assumes that all organic materials are theoretically converted to methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia (Sialve et al., 2009). The theoretical specific methane yield (SMY, mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS)) can be predicted in Eq. (2). (2) SMY = a 2 + b 8 − 3 8 c − d 4 12 a + b + 14 c + 16 d × 22.4 × 1000 mL / g VS where 22.4 (L) is the volume of 1mol gas at standard conditions, and 1000 is the conversion factor from litres to millilitres. However, the real SMY is lower than the theoretical value because some organic fractions, such as lignin, are hardly degraded and used for methane production (Montgomery and Bochmann, 2014; Weiland, 2010). Based on the Buswell equation, the theoretical SMY from typical carbohydrates ((C6H10O5)n), proteins (C5H7NO2) and lipids (C57H104O6) are 415, 496 and 1014mL/gVS, respectively (Angelidaki and Sanders, 2004). The lipids provide the highest potential of SMY, but they are neither easily treated by conventional methods nor decomposed biologically because of their insoluble aggregate formation and tendency to float on surfaces (Chen et al., 2014a; Sialve et al., 2009; Stoll and Gupta, 1997). The methane content (MC) in biogas can be roughly predicted as the percentage of methane in the gas mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, as shown in Eq. (3). (3) MC = 4 a + b − 3 c − 2 d 8 a The real MC is dependent on the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide in the liquid phase, which is significantly related to the pH, and it can improve the MC (Sialve et al., 2009; Weiland, 2010). Meanwhile, the released minor compositions (e.g., ammonia and hydrogen sulphide), as well as residual air/nitrogen and water vapour in the headspace of the reactor, can dilute the MC in biogas. The specific ammonia yield (SAY) can be calculated using Eq. (4). (4) SAY = 17 c 12 a + b + 14 c + 16 d g N H 3 / g VS 2.1.3 Operational parameters 2.1.3.1 Wet and dry fermentation Biogas production can be classified according to wet or dry conditions. Wet fermentation, which is suitable for the application of completely stirred tank reactors, is usually operated with a total solids (TS) content below 10%. Dry fermentation is usually operated with a TS content between 15% and 35%. Currently, wet fermentation processes are dominant in the agricultural sector (Weiland, 2010). 2.1.3.2 Hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) The HRT (Eq. (5)) and OLR (Eq. (6)) are considered important parameters for AD (Dareioti and Kornaros, 2015; Dinopoulou et al., 1988; Kinnunen et al., 2014; Sialve et al., 2009). HRT has to be sufficiently high to avoid the washout of the microbial community, and also sufficient for the hydrolysis step for slowly degradable substrates. When the fermentation process is operated at low OLR and high HRT, the SMY is usually constant and maximised. By contrast, high OLR and low HRT may lead to low degradation efficiency of the substrate, thereby resulting in a decrease in SMY (Sialve et al., 2009). (5) HRT d = Fermenter capacity L Daily fresh substrate added L / d (6) OLR g / L / d = Daily organic dry solids added g / d Fermenter capacity L 2.1.3.3 Temperature In the natural process, methane can be generated in a temperature range from 0°C to 97°C, such as in ice field (0°C), in marshes and sediments (4–15°C), in rumen (39°C) and in hot springs (>50°C) (Kashyap et al., 2003). Most studies on biogas have been carried out in mesophilic (20–45°C) and thermophilic (45–60°C) conditions (Kashyap et al., 2003; Niu et al., 2013a; Niu et al., 2013b; Weiland, 2010). Thermophilic conditions lead to higher hydrolysis and degradation rates, thereby resulting in shorter HRT and smaller digester volumes compared with mesophilic conditions (Chen et al., 2003; Fu et al., 2015; Weiland, 2010). Furthermore, higher temperatures also offer advantages in the destruction of pathogens and weed seeds, and improvement in dewatering of post-treatment sludge (Kim et al., 2006; Lo et al., 1985). However, the temperature shift in thermophilic conditions (e.g., decrease from 55°C to 50°C or below) can significantly reduce the growth rate of microorganisms. Thus a risk of washout of the microbial community may occur, as the growth rate is lower at 50°C than at 55°C and as such the HRT may be too low for the lower temperature (Weiland, 2010). In current industrial applications, most of the biogas digesters in Germany are operated in mesophilic conditions, and only a few digesters are operated in thermophilic conditions. The increased energy requirement to maintain the thermophilic temperature is not a critical issue at present as most of the produced biogas is used for combined heat and power generation, and surplus heat cannot be effectively used and is usually wasted. However, with the development of improved heat supply systems and direct use of upgraded biogas, thermophilic processes will become less competitive (Weiland, 2010). 2.1.3.4 Trace elements Nutrient supply in AD is important for digester stability and performance. Successful AD involves a sufficient concentration of both macronutrients and trace elements (Demirel and Scherer, 2011; Wall et al., 2014). The macronutrients, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), are important compounds in digestion systems, and they are associated with further utilisation of digestate (Wall et al., 2014). The trace elements, such as nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W), are critical to AD performance, and the unavailability of trace elements can inhibit methanogenesis (Banks et al., 2012; Demirel and Scherer, 2011; Schattauer et al., 2011; Wall et al., 2014). The requirements of trace elements for methanogens, such as Methanospirillum hungatii, Methanobacterium wolfei, Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanococcus voltae and Methanocorpusculum parvum, have been widely reported (Demirel and Scherer, 2011). Agricultural digesters operating with energy crops, such as grass or maize as the mono-substrate, usually require the addition of trace elements (Demirel and Scherer, 2011). Pobeheim et al. (2011) found that the SMY in mono-digestion of maize silage can be increased by 30% through the addition of trace element solution, with Ni and Co as the most important components. Wall et al. (2014) reported that the SMY in mono-digestion of grass silage at high OLR of 4.0g/L/d increased by 12% when Co, Ni and Fe were added. Trace elements can be provided not only by the addition of chemicals, but also through co-digestion with animal excreta, wastewater sludge and OFMSW (Demirel and Scherer, 2011). 2.1.4 Inhibition Various substances, which can cause an adverse shift in microbial communities or inhibition of bacterial growth, have been reported to be inhibitory to AD. The inhibitors in AD commonly involve high concentrations of ammonia, sulphide, metals and organics (e.g., long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), chlorophenols and halogenated aliphatics) (Chen et al., 2014a). Inhibition is usually reflected by a decrease in methane production and accumulation of VFAs (Chen et al., 2008). 2.1.4.1 Ammonia According to Eq. (1), the nitrogen compositions in biomass, such as proteins, nucleic acids and urea, can be converted to ammonia during AD (Gonzalez-Fernandez and Garcia-Encina, 2009). Suitable ammonia concentration benefits bacterial growth and provides the buffer capacity of AD medium, which can increase the stability of AD. However, high ammonia concentrations may cause a significant decrease in the microbial activities of methanogens, leading to the accumulation of VFAs and process failure. Ammonia may inhibit methanogenic microorganisms via two ways: (1) unionised ammonia can diffuse passively into cells, which leads to potassium deficiency and proton imbalance, and (2) ionised ammonium can directly inhibit methane-producing enzymes (Chen et al., 2008; Gallert et al., 1998). The total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration is considered an important indicator for AD. Low TAN level (<200mg/L) is beneficial for AD, whereas high TAN level (>1500mg/L) may lead to serious inhibition (Angelidaki and Ahring, 1993; Prochazka et al., 2012; Rajagopal et al., 2013; Sung and Liu, 2003). The free (unionised) ammonia nitrogen (FAN) is mainly responsible for the inhibition of methanogenic microorganisms because of its high permeability to cell membrane (Muller et al., 2006). The equilibrium between ionised ammonium and FAN is shown in Eq. (7). The FAN concentration is generally dependent on the TAN, temperature and pH (Eq. (8)). For instance, FAN only consists of less than 1% of TAN at pH7 and 35°C, but increases to 10% at pH8 (Chen et al., 2008; Rajagopal et al., 2013). (7) N H 3 + H 2 O ↔ N H 4 + + O H − (8) FAN = TAN 1 + 10 − pH 10 − 0.09018 + 2729.92 T K Adjusting the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of feedstock is the most important strategy to control the TAN level. The high protein content substrate can produce high ammonia levels during AD. Samson and Leduy (1986) reported a high TAN level up to 7000mg/L when the microalgae Arthrospira maxima (C/N ratio: 4.2) was used as a substrate. The optimal C/N ratio in AD is suggested to be between 20 and 30 (Kinnunen et al., 2014; Montingelli et al., 2015). Carbon-rich substrates, such as glycerine from the biodiesel industry and starch from energy crops, can be used as co-substrates to adjust the C/N ratio to an optimal value for stable AD (Resch et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2012). Inoculum acclimation can increase the toxicity threshold level of ammonia (Chen et al., 2008). Koster and Lettinga (1988) reported a 6.2-fold increase in the toxic threshold after inoculum acclimation. The adapted inoculums can produce methane at TAN levels of up to 11,800mg/L. Temperature and pH control is also considered an effective method to control ammonia toxicity. According to Eq. (8), decreases in pH and temperature reduce the FAN percentage, thereby resulting in a decrease in the inhibitory effect. Moreover, the dilution of reactor contents and microorganism immobilisation can reduce ammonia toxicity and improve process stability. Furthermore, numerous ammonia removal techniques, such as the use of zeolite and carbon fibre textiles, anammox and struvite precipitation, are efficient for inhibiting ammonia release in AD; however, they are too expensive for industrial applications (Nelson et al., 2003; Rajagopal et al., 2013; Sasaki et al., 2011; Sawayama et al., 2004; Tada et al., 2005). 2.1.4.2 Sodium Algal biomass harvested from marine or saline environments and acid/alkali pre-treated biomass, as well as some wastewaters produced in the food processing industry, may comprise high sodium concentrations. Sodium ions at low levels (e.g., 100–350mg/L) are necessary for AD microbial community metabolism because of their role in the oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate formation (Chen et al., 2008; Sialve et al., 2009). However, high sodium levels show inhibitory effects. For instance, 3500–5500mg/L sodium concentration shows moderate inhibition to methanogens, whereas this effect becomes strong with the further increase in sodium concentrations above 8000mg/L (Chen et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2011). Sodium in thermophilic conditions is more inhibitory than that in mesophilic conditions (Sialve et al., 2009). The inhibitory effect of sodium to AD microorganisms may be listed in the following order: lignocellulose-degrading organisms > acetate-utilising organisms > propionate-utilising organisms > hydrogen/carbon dioxide-utilising organisms (Liu and Boone, 1991). The presence of other ions, such as potassium, calcium and magnesium, can play an antagonistic or synergistic role on the potential sodium toxicity (Sialve et al., 2009). Inoculum acclimation to high sodium concentration over long periods (e.g., 1–2years) can improve tolerance and reduce the lag phase time (Feijoo et al., 1995; Mendez et al., 1995). However, the sodium concentration should be stable because anaerobic microorganisms are sensitive to environmental changes (Lefebvre and Moletta, 2006). Direct use of marine inoculum may be an effective method to overcome sodium inhibition (Aspe et al., 1997). 2.1.4.3 Sulphate Sulphur is rich in many industrial effluents, as well as some algal biomass (Allen et al., 2013a; O'Flaherty et al., 1998; Peu et al., 2012). In AD, sulphur is a necessary nutrient for microorganisms, particularly for methanogens (O'Flaherty et al., 1999). The optimal concentration of sulphur is suggested between 1 and 25mg/L (Scherer and Sahm, 1981). Excess sulphur content in substrates may lead to inhibition. Organic and inorganic sulphur can be reduced to sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria under anaerobic conditions (Chen et al., 2008; Peu et al., 2012). This process can inhibit methane production. Primary inhibition is from the competition for organic substrates (e.g., propionate and acetate) and hydrogen, which reduces the substrate amounts for methane production. Secondary inhibition is from the toxicity of produced sulphide to various microorganisms in AD (Chen et al., 2008). Hydrogen sulphide is the toxic form of sulphide because it can diffuse into the cell membrane, denature native proteins, interfere with the coenzyme sulphate linkages and interfere with the assimilatory sulphur metabolism (Chen et al., 2008; Speece, 1983). Sulphate toxicity increases with increasing pH (McCartney and Oleszkiewicz, 1991). For instance, the concentration of hydrogen sulphide, which can cause significant inhibition, is reduced from 250mg/L at pH6.4–7.2 to 90mg/L at pH7.8–8.0 (Chen et al., 2008). Peu et al. (2012) suggested that the carbon to sulphur (C/S) ratio in the substrate should be higher than 40 to minimise the risk of hydrogen sulphide for AD. Co-substrates with high C/S ratios can be used to improve AD stability when sulphur-rich substrates are used for biogas production. Allen et al. (2014) investigated the effects of different mix ratios of green seaweed Ulva lactuca (C/S ratio: 11) and dairy slurry (C/S ratio: 71) on long-term AD. An optimal biomethane yield of 170mL/gVS was achieved from the mixture of 25% U. lactuca and 75% dairy slurry (C/S ratio of 56) at an OLR of 2.5g/L/d. Levels in excess of 50% U. lactuca (C/S ratio of 41) were not recommended for biogas production. Combining a sulphide removal step, such as chemical (e.g., coagulation, oxidation and precipitation) and biological (e.g., partial oxidation of elemental sulphur) techniques, is effective to reduce sulphate toxicity (Elferink et al., 1994; Song et al., 2001). Inoculum acclimation to free hydrogen sulphide can also increase the tolerance of microorganisms to sulphate (Chen et al., 2008). Isa et al. (1986) found that the acclimated inoculums are only inhibited slightly at hydrogen sulphide levels above 1000mg/L. 2.1.5 Pre-treatment as an effective method to enhance biogas production 2.1.5.1 Pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass For the recalcitrant biomass feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, hydrolysis is the rate-limiting stage for biogas production. Pre-treatment of recalcitrant biomass is necessary to facilitate biogas production (Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009; Zheng et al., 2014). The organic components of lignocellulosic biomass comprise abundant cellulose (17%–61% of TS), hemicellulose (10%–37% of TS) and lignin (4%–35% of TS), and small amounts of proteins, pectins and soluble sugars (Monlau et al., 2014; Ruiz et al., 2013). Cellulose is a linear polysaccharide comprising several hundred to many thousands of β-(1→4) linked D-glucose units. Most cellulose has a well-organised crystalline structure, whereas only a small percentage is in the form of an unorganised amorphous structure. Amorphous cellulose is more easily degraded than crystalline cellulose (Monlau et al., 2013a). Hemicellulose is mainly composed of abundant pentose (e.g., xylose) and hexose (e.g., mannose) and small amounts of acetyl groups (Emmel et al., 2003; Monlau et al., 2013a; Sun and Cheng, 2002). Lignin, as a main component of cell walls providing structural rigidity and resistance against oxidative stress and microbial attack, is mainly composed of phenylpropionic alcohols (Monlau et al., 2014; Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008). Various pre-treatments, such as physical, chemical and biological methods, have been employed to improve biogas production from lignocellulosic biomass (see Table 4 ) (Zheng et al., 2014). Single or combined pre-treatment approaches can effectively improve the performance of AD (Alzate et al., 2012; Montgomery and Bochmann, 2014; Nkemka and Murto, 2013; Ometto et al., 2014). Herrmann et al. (2012) reported that size reduction can promote ensiling and methane production from energy crops. A maximal increase of 11%–13% in SMY was achieved using median size particles (6–33mm). Jackowiak et al. (2011) used microwave pre-treatment on wheat straw at 150°C. The SMY was increased by 28% compared with the raw sample. Meanwhile, the fermentation time to reach 80% of SMY was significantly reduced by 65%. Chandra et al. (2012) conducted alkaline pre-treatment on wheat straw under 37°C for 120h at 4% sodium hydroxide concentration based on the TS of substrate, thereby resulting in an increase of 111.6% in SMY during subsequent AD. Monlau et al. (2013b) found that the SMY of sunflower oil cake, which was pre-treated by 1% sulphuric acid at 170°C, was increased by 48.2%. The further increase in temperature or acid concentration showed no improvement in SMY, probably because of the Maillard (or caramel) reaction. Teghammar et al. (2012) used N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (ionic liquid) to pre-treat spruce, rice straw and triticale straw at 130°C for 1–15h. The pre-treatments improved the SMYs of those substrates by 400%–1200% during six weeks of fermentation. Muthangya et al. (2009) conducted fungal pre-treatment on sisal leaf decortication residue. Two fungal strains, CCHT-1 and Trichoderma reesei, were sequentially employed during pre-treatment prior to AD, resulting in 30%–101% increases in SMYs compared with the raw material. Nkemka and Murto (2013) pre-treated wheat straw via combined catalysed steam pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, leading to 95% of sugar release and 57% improvement in SMY compared with the raw sample. 2.1.5.2 Pre-treatment of microalgal biomass Microalgae are microscopic photosynthetic organisms that are mainly unicellular. The three most representative classes of microalgae are green microalgae, diatoms and golden microalgae. Cyanobacteria are also referred to as microalgae (Demirbas, 2010; Monlau et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2015c). The organic components of microalgal biomass are normally composed of 10%–70% carbohydrates, 6%–70% proteins and 4%–57% lipids based on TS (Fernandes et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2008; Lv et al., 2010; Monlau et al., 2014). The percentage of organic components of algal biomass can be significantly changed depending on the environmental conditions, such as nutrient depletion, sodium stress, concentration, pH, temperature and irradiance (Chen et al., 2013; Dismukes et al., 2008). Carrieri et al. (2010) found that the carbohydrate content of A. maxima increases from approximately 20% to 50% of TS dominated by low-molecular-weight glucosylglycerol and trehalose under sodium stress. Liu et al. (2008) found that the lipid content of Chlorella vulgaris significantly increases from 8% to 57% of TS at optimal iron concentrations. Fernandes et al. (2013) found that the lipid content of Parachlorella kessleri increases from near zero to 29% of TS, whereas the carbohydrate content decreases from approximately 25% of TS to 10% of TS under nutrient depletion. The cell walls of microalgae may effectively resist bacterial attack and reduce bacterial accessibility; intact microalgal cells can be found after one to six months in AD (Chen and Oswald, 1998; Mussgnug et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2014). Mussgnug et al. (2010) reported that cell wall degradation significantly corresponds to increased biogas production. Microalgae without cell walls (e.g., Dunaliella salina) or with protein-based cell walls containing no cellulose or hemicellulose (e.g., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arthrospira platensis and Euglena gracilis) can produce high SMYs. On the contrary, carbohydrate-based cell walls containing hemicellulose can remarkably reduce biogas production. Particularly, microalgae (e.g., Scenedesmus obliquus) with rigid cell walls containing sporopollenin-like biopolymers show strong resistance to microalgal degradation in AD, resulting in low SMYs (Mussgnug et al., 2010). Pre-treatment to increase cell wall disruption and substrate solubilisation may be a necessary step to enhance the AD of microalgae (Montingelli et al., 2015; Ward et al., 2014). Gonzalez-Fernandez et al. (2012) reported that the SMY of Scenedesmus sp. pre-treated by thermal heating at 90°C was 2.2 times higher than that of raw biomass at 33d of their batch test. Another study conducted by the same authors reported that SMYs in the continuous test increased by 2.9- and 3.4-fold at OLRs of 1 and 2.5g chemical oxygen demand/L/d, respectively, when Scenedesmus sp. was pre-treated at 90°C for 1h (Gonzalez-Fernandez et al., 2013). Chen and Oswald (1998) used thermal pre-treatment to enhance biogas yield from microalgae. The SMY improved by 33% when microalgae were pre-treated at 100°C for 8h. Alzate et al. (2012) used ultrasound in the pre-treatment of mixed microalgae at 10MJ/kg TS, resulting in 6%–24% increases in SMYs. Thermal pre-treatment at 110–170°C was highly effective; SMYs were increased by 46–62%. Keymer et al. (2013) demonstrated that high pressure thermal hydrolysis and lipid extraction can effectively improve biogas production from mixed microalgae; the SMYs were increased by 81% and 33%, respectively. Physical and chemical pre-treatment methods can improve the SMYs of microalgae; however, they may require high energy inputs (equal or higher than energy produced from microalgal biomass) (Alzate et al., 2012; Ward et al., 2014). Biological pre-treatment can be an alternative option. Ehimen et al. (2013) reported that a combination of blending and enzymatic pre-treatment of Rhizoclonium sp. improved the SMYs by at least 20% compared with blending pre-treatment alone. Lu et al. (2013) found that the SMY of C. vulgaris was enhanced by 17%–24% with the addition of Clostridium thermocellum because of the improved cell disruption of microalgae. Ometto et al. (2014) investigated the effects of various pre-treatments on S. obliquus, C. vulgaris and A. maxima. They concluded that enzymatic hydrolysis showed the greatest improvements in biogas yields (>270%), followed by thermal hydrolysis (60%–100%) and ultrasonication (30%–60%). 2.1.5.3 Pre-treatment choice Current pre-treatments usually show positive results in biogas production. However, no single pre-treatment technique is suitable for all substrates and fermentation systems. The most important issue is to combine the right substrate with the correct pre-treatment technique to improve the bioavailability of the substrate in fermentation (Montgomery and Bochmann, 2014). An optimal pre-treatment method should be economically feasible with minimum parasitic energy input (Nizami et al., 2009). For instance, chemical pre-treatment and thermal pre-treatment at high temperature may significantly enhance AD, but the costs and environmental impacts of such methods can make them less desirable (Ariunbaatar et al., 2014). Furthermore, the excessive formation of by-products (e.g., furanic and phenolic compounds) during pre-treatment, which can inhibit subsequent fermentation processes, should be controlled and avoided (Monlau et al., 2014). In contrast, continuous low temperature thermal pre-treatment based on excess heat (e.g., waste heat from boilers) may be a promising option for industrial applications. Alternatively, efficient enzymatic hydrolysis with low energy input may be another cost-effective option for pre-treatment. 2.1.6 Ensiling as a storage method for AD of energy crops The harvest of energy crops and seaweeds may be carried out at optimal times during the year to maximise the biomass productivities and improve SMYs (Adams et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2015). Industrial-scale biogas production is commonly a continuous process, which requires a continuous supply of high-quality substrate (Murphy et al., 2015). These seasonal biomass feedstocks can be stored by ensiling process (Weiland, 2010). Ensiling process can anaerobically convert water-soluble carbohydrates to VFAs (mainly lactic acid) via lactic acid-producing bacteria. VFA accumulation leads to a significant decrease in pH to about 4, which can prevent further decomposition of organic compounds for many months before use (Herrmann et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2015; Weiland, 2010). Optimal ensiling process leads to rapid formation of lactic acid (5%–10%) and acetic acid (2%–4%) in a few days. To achieve optimal conditions, the total TS particle length should be reduced to 10–20mm, and the TS content should be between 20% and 40%. The ensiling process may be controlled and accelerated through the addition of enzymes, starter inoculums and easily degradable carbohydrates (Murphy et al., 2011; Weiland, 2010). The ensiling process can result in 8%–20% of energy losses in original feedstocks via aerobic degradation. For large-scale application, compaction of the feedstocks in silos and covering them by plastic wrap are necessary to prevent aerobic losses. The ensiling process may be considered an alternative pre-treatment process because of the part hydrolysis of polysaccharides, which is resistant to AD (Weiland, 2010). The subsequent AD of silage may increase SMY and compensate for the energy loss during ensiling process (Herrmann et al., 2011). 2.1.7 Biogas yield from various biomass and waste streams 2.1.7.1 Biogas from land-based crops and algae As shown in Table 5 , most of the land-based crops and algae have relatively similar SMYs, within the range of 200mL/gVS to 500mL/gVS. However, the biomass productivities per hectare are significantly different, leading to large variations in gross energy yields (EYs) per hectare (up to 715GJ/ha/a for land-based crops and up to 3293GJ/ha/a for algae). Maize is widely used as a substrate in many agricultural biogas plants in Europe because of its high biomass productivity of up to 30tTS/ha/a. Root crops, such as sugar beet (9–18tTS/ha/a) and potato (11–50tTS/ha/a), also provide high biomass productivities. Root crops are seldom used in AD because of their disadvantages in soil contamination and sand accumulation in the digesters (Murphy et al., 2011). Microalgae, such as Arthrospira (27–80tTS/ha/a), Chlorella (27–160tTS/ha/a), Dunaliella (6–110tTS/ha/a), Scenedesmus (25–55tTS/ha/a), Tetraselmis (38–95tTS/ha/a) and Nannochloropsis (91–234tTS/ha/a) species, can potentially achieve much higher biomass productivities compared with land-based crops. Nevertheless, high biomass productivities of microalgae require optimal growth conditions (e.g., temperature, light intensity, gas sparging, pH and nutrients) and well-designed photo-bioreactors, which are expensive and energy-intensive at the current stage (Chisti, 2013; Pegallapati et al., 2014; Zhu, 2015; Ziolkowska and Simon, 2014). Potential algal biomass for industrial biogas production can be obtained from (1) algae grown for waste treatments (e.g., wastewater and/or waste gas with concentrated carbon dioxide), (2) waste biomass from natural algal bloom and (3) algal biomass residues after valuable component and lipid extraction (Risen et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2015b). Seaweeds or macroalgae, such as Laminaria (8–150tTS/ha/a), Ulva (27–74tTS/ha/a), Ascophyllum (10–12tTS/ha/a) and Gracilaria (18–36tTS/ha/a) species, also have high productivities similar to microalgae. However, some caution is advised in using these figures. For example present large-scale cultivation techniques of seaweeds such as Laminaria species can annually generate 40t of wet seaweed biomass per hectare (20kgperm line with 20 lines per 100m length); this is equivalent to 8tTS/ha/a at 20% moisture content. Other (as yet unproven) techniques purport to generate far higher yields of seaweed per hectare. 2.1.7.2 Biogas from waste streams As shown in Fig. 3 , the SMYs from various waste streams are significantly different. The lipid-rich substrates can give higher methane yields compared with carbohydrate-rich substrates (Abouelenien et al., 2010; Angelidaki and Ellegaard, 2003; Ariunbaatar et al., 2014; Kiran et al., 2014b). Manure includes a large amount of lignocellulose, which makes it recalcitrant to degradation, leading to a low SMY (195–300mL/gVS). However, manure is an excellent substrate in AD because of the following reasons. Firstly, it is rich in various nutrients that are necessary for bacterial growth. Secondly, it provides high buffering capacity that prevents a drop in pH caused by VFA accumulation. Thirdly, the high water content in manure can act as a solvent for dry substrates, thereby facilitating the problems of mechanical treatment and pumping (Angelidaki and Ellegaard, 2003). Straw is a main agricultural residue associated with food production (Kim and Dale, 2004; Lal, 2005). Straw mainly comprises lignocellulose and little proteins. The high C/N ratio (>40) makes straw an excellent co-substrate to improve AD of nitrogen-rich substrates, such as manure and algae (Menardo et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2012), if the carbon is made available by a pre-treatment process. Industrial waste, household waste, food waste and OFMSW are usually easily degraded and can achieve higher SMYs (150–800mL/gVS) compared with lignocellulosic substrates (Abouelenien et al., 2010; Angelidaki and Ellegaard, 2003; Ariunbaatar et al., 2014; Banks et al., 2011; Kiran et al., 2014b). Most wastes/residues tend to have either low C/N ratios or the potential to result in VFA accumulation during continuous fermentation, which usually requires co-fermentation (Allen et al., 2013b). The high lipid content in wastes, such as food waste, can increase the methane potential; however, AD of such wastes is usually hampered because of the inhibitory effect of LCFAs derived from lipid compositions (Chen et al., 2008). LCFAs can be adsorbed onto the cell wall or cell membrane of anaerobic consortium, interfering with the protection and transport functions (Rinzema et al., 1994). Furthermore, the adsorption of LCFAs results in the flotation and wash out of the inoculums (Rinzema et al., 1989)."
6,Two-stage fermentation combining hydrogen and methane production,"2.2 Two-stage fermentation combining hydrogen and methane production 2.2.1 Fermentative hydrogen fermentation isolated from AD Fermentative hydrogen production (also known as dark fermentation) can be realised by blocking the hydrogen to methane pathways in AD (Liu et al., 2013). Hydrogen fermentation is mainly composed of hydrolysis and acidogenesis stages of AD (Wellinger et al., 2013). High-molecular-weight organic substrates (e.g., carbohydrates and proteins) are first hydrolysed to low-molecular-weight ones (e.g., monosaccharides and amino acids), and they are then converted to VFAs, alcohols, hydrogen and carbon dioxide by anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB) (Guwy et al., 2011; Hay et al., 2013). Hydrogenase is the key enzyme that catalyses molecular hydrogen generation through combining protons and electrons (Argun and Kargi, 2011). Typical AFB genera in hydrogen fermentation that are related to hydrogen fermentation include Clostridium, Enterobacter, Lactobacillus, Caldicellulosiruptor, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Citrobacter and Thermotoga (Maru et al., 2013; Pawar and van Niel, 2013). Single-species and mixed cultures have been widely reported as inoculum for hydrogen fermentation (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Fang and Liu, 2002; Lay et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2010; Lin and Chang, 1999). Single-species cultures can be obtained by wild strains or modified strains via physiochemical mutation and genetic modification. Mixed AFB are usually isolated from AD inoculum by various pre-treatments (e.g., heat, acid, alkaline and aeration) (Van Ginkel et al., 2001; Xia et al., 2015a; Zhu and Beland, 2006). Compared with single-species cultures, mixed cultures are more promising for large-scale application because of the following reasons. Firstly, they can use a wider range of substrates, thereby improving energy production from complex biomass wastes. Secondly, they offer resilience to contamination when unsterilised substrates are used, facilitating stable hydrogen production in continuous operation (Pawar and van Niel, 2013). The basic reaction in hydrogen fermentation involves the monomers of carbohydrates (i.e., monosaccharides), proteins (i.e., amino acids) and lipids (i.e., LCFAs and glycerol). Table 6 summarises the characteristics of substrate degradation and hydrogen production in dark fermentation. Monosaccharides derived from carbohydrates are considered the main substrates for fermentative hydrogen production. The theoretical specific hydrogen yields (SHYs) of monosaccharides depend on their type. For example, the theoretical SHY of glucose is 4mol/mol glucose (i.e., 498mL/g glucose), whereas that of xylose is 10/3mol/mol xylose (i.e., 498mL/g xylose) (Guwy et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2015a). The experimental SHYs from monosaccharides are usually in the range of 160–448mL/g monosaccharides, corresponding to 32%–90% of theoretical values (de Vrije et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2009; Lin and Chang, 1999; Song et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2010). The protein compositions have much lower hydrogen potential compared with carbohydrate compositions (Sambusiti et al., 2015). Amino acids derived from proteins are usually not advantageous for hydrogen production. The experimental SHYs of amino acids are very low under normal environments of hydrogen fermentation (e.g., acidic or neutral condition) (Xia et al., 2015a; Xia et al., 2013c). Such low values can be attributed to slow hydrogen production rates compared with fast hydrogen consumption rates when amino acids are used as substrates. Xiao et al. (2014) found that some hydrogen can be produced under alkali environment (pH10–12) and a low substrate concentration (2g/L) with the aid of chloroform (0.02% v/v or 0.3g/L) to inhibit the hydrogen consumption pathway. However, the addition of chloroform may cause a problem in the subsequent use of the effluents from dark fermentation for methane fermentation; very low concentrations of chloroform (0.09mg/L) can completely inhibit methanogenesis (Chen et al., 2014a). Glycerol derived from lipids are suitable for hydrogen production, with a theoretical SHY of 3mol/mol glycerol (i.e., 730mL/g glycerol) (Maru et al., 2013). The experimental SHYs from glycerol are usually in the range of 29–696mL/g glycerol, corresponding to 4%–95% of the theoretical values (Maru et al., 2013; Reungsang et al., 2013; Varrone et al., 2013). In contrast, LCFAs derived from lipids can form insoluble hydrophobic aggregates, and are hardly degraded in dark fermentation (Chen et al., 2014a). Furthermore, LCFA fermentation to shorter chain equivalents is thermodynamically unfavourable, unless combined with methanogenesis (Oh and Martin, 2010). However, methanogenesis is usually inhibited in the hydrogen fermentation process (Liu et al., 2013; Monlau et al., 2014; Saady, 2013). 2.2.2 Hydrogen production and consumption pathways Hydrogen production and consumption simultaneously proceed through various metabolic pathways. Table 7 presents the main hydrogen production and consumption pathways using glucose as a model substrate. Hydrogen is generally generated by combining protons and electron donors, which can be in the forms of reduced ferredoxin and NADH, with the aid of hydrogenase from hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) (Angenent et al., 2004). The electron donor consumption can be equally considered as hydrogen consumption (Saady, 2013). In acidogenesis, acetic and butyric acid routes are well-known hydrogen production pathways of glucose; theoretically, 2mol hydrogen is produced with 1mol acetic acid (or 4molH2/mol glucose) or butyric acid (or 2molH2/mol glucose) during fermentation (Angenent et al., 2004). By contrast, no hydrogen is generated during the production of lactic acid or ethanol (Antonopoulou et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2010). Propionic, valeric and caproic acid pathways, which can potentially consume 1mol hydrogen, 7mol hydrogen and 4mol hydrogen, along with 1mol propionic, valeric and caproic acid production, respectively, may play major hydrogen consumption roles during metabolic shifts in HPB or increase in the population of non-HPB (Angenent et al., 2004; Antonopoulou et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2010; Saady, 2013). Methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis are well-known hydrogen consumption pathways (Saady, 2013). In dark fermentation, the methanogenic process is usually inhibited because (1) operational parameters, such as low HRT (e.g., 0.5h–2days) and pH (e.g., 5.5–6.5) caused by VFA production can greatly inhibit the methanogenic microorganisms, and (2) inoculum pre-treatments for dark fermentation, such as heat shock, can suppress the activities of non-spore-forming methanogenic microorganisms (Chu et al., 2008; Fang and Liu, 2002; Lee et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2004; Lin and Cheng, 2006; Saady, 2013; Song et al., 2010). Homoacetogenic bacteria, which are commonly related to the genera of Acetobacterium, Butyribacterium, Clostridium and Sporomusa, are strict anaerobes with fast growth rates, and some of them are spore-forming microorganisms. To date, no effective method can completely eliminate homoacetogenic hydrogen consumption; homoacetogenesis does not depend on the source and pre-treatment of inoculum, substrate, operational method or reactor type (Saady, 2013). Hydrogen production, neutral and consumption pathways are thermodynamically favourable under standard conditions (ΔG 0 <0). Nevertheless, the accumulation of hydrogen, which is produced in dark fermentation, can enhance the thermodynamic favourability of hydrogen consumption reactions, while reducing the thermodynamic favourability of hydrogen production reactions. A shift in the metabolic pathways of AFB to non-hydrogen-producing pathways may occur. Furthermore, the high concentration of carbon dioxide in the later stage of hydrogen fermentation can significantly enhance homoacetogenic reaction, leading to fast hydrogen consumption (Saady, 2013). 2.2.3 Two-stage fermentation comprising hydrogen and methane production Less than one-third of energy in substrates is converted to hydrogen in dark fermentation. More than two-thirds of energy is contained in the effluent of dark fermentation in the form of VFAs and alcohols; they can be further converted to methane via AD to enhance gaseous fuel production (Xia et al., 2015c). Table 8 presents the theoretical SMYs from various organic products of dark fermentation. Interestingly, although some hydrogen is consumed by various pathways (e.g., caproic acid and homoacetogenic pathways, see Table 7) in the first stage of dark fermentation, energy can still be recovered in the form of methane via subsequent conversion of the SMPs through methane fermentation. Thus, the use of expensive methods to inhibit hydrogen consumption pathways may not be necessary in the first stage of hydrogen fermentation if subsequent methane fermentation is carried out to re-use the effluent of dark fermentation (Xia et al., in press). Compared with single-stage methane fermentation, the two-stage process combining hydrogen and methane fermentation exhibits the following advantages. Firstly, the two-stage process can achieve higher energy production of gaseous fuel based on thermodynamic calculation. When sugars and glycerol are used as substrates, the theoretical EY via the two-stage process is increased by 10%–12%, compared with single-stage methane fermentation (see Table 9 ). The two-stage process has a better energy balance calculated by the energy input (pre-treatment and fermentation operation) and output (gaseous biofuels) (Liu et al., 2013). Secondly, the two-stage process is more stable, and the process parameters (e.g., pH, OLR and HRT) are more easily optimised via separation of hydrogen and methane fermentation. Biogas production can be improved under the optimised conditions for each group of microorganisms (Cooney et al., 2007; Gomez et al., 2006; Weiland, 2010). Thirdly, the two-stage process can greatly reduce the overall fermentation time, which allows shorter HRT and higher OLR for the two-stage system (Liu et al., 2013). Fourthly, the microorganisms in the first stage fermentation can break down some inhibitors (e.g., phenols); this is favourable for improving the process stability of the second stage (Montgomery and Bochmann, 2014). Table 10 presents a brief summary of the advantages of two-stage systems over single-stage systems obtained in previous studies. The two-stage systems were usually carried out under mesophilic conditions (Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2014; Massanet-Nicolau et al., 2013; Siddiqui et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011). Massanet-Nicolau et al. (2013) reported the cogeneration of hydrogen and methane from wheat feed pellets. Two-stage fermentation showed a 37% increase in SMY (359mL/gVS) compared with single-stage fermentation under the same overall HRT of 20days. The two-stage system can further reduce the HRT to 12days with a slight change in SMY (306mL/gVS). Yang et al. (2011) employed two-stage fermentation using lipid-extracted microalgal residue as a substrate. SHY of 46mL/gVS and SMY of 393.6mL/gVS were obtained via the two-stage process. The overall EY was increased by 27% compared with single-stage methane fermentation. Liu et al. (2014) used cornstalk pre-treated by wet steam explosion as a substrate for hydrogen and methane fermentation. Two-stage fermentation gave an SHY of 12 and SMY of 195mL/g TS. The overall EY showed an increase of 26% compared with single-stage methane fermentation. A two-stage process combining hydrogen and methane fermentation using household solid waste was carried out by Liu et al. (2006). The first stage generated an SHY of 43mL/gVS, whereas the second stage generated an SMY of 500mL, which was 21% higher than that of single-stage methane fermentation. The low pH (5.0–5.5) and short HRT (2days) can successfully separate hydrogen fermentation by preventing methanogenesis in the first stage without any additional control. Siddiqui et al. (2011) operated single and two-stage reactors under optimal conditions using food waste and sewage sludge as co-substrates. The two-stage system achieved an SHY of 130mL/gVSdestroyed and SMY of 670mL/gVSdestroyed, which was a 40% increase compared with single-stage methane fermentation (480mL/gVSdestroyed). The first stage of hydrogen production may be inhibited by the pH drop caused by the accumulation of VFAs. A pH adjustment in a range of 5.5–6.5 by external alkali is usually required to maintain optimal conditions for HPB (Jung et al., 2012; Lin and Chang, 1999; Xia et al., 2015a). Supplemental alkalinity is expensive and can be a major operation cost in the treatment of carbohydrate-rich wastes (Romli et al., 1994). Kraemer and Bagley (2005) collected effluent from the second stage (the methane reactor) and recycled to the first stage (the hydrogen reactor), leading to a 40% reduction in alkalinity requirement for pH control; however the increased population of hydrogen consumers reduced hydrogen production in the first stage. Jung et al. (2012) reported a 100% reduction in external alkali via recirculation of methane fermentation effluent in the two-stage process. The heat pre-treated effluent led to a slight decrease in SHY, whereas the effluent without pre-treatment led to a significant decrease in SHY and changes in SMPs during the first stage of hydrogen fermentation. The use of pre-treatment techniques for recycled effluent, such as autoclave, heat shock or membrane filtration, can exclude the hydrogen-consuming microorganisms (Jung et al., 2012; Kraemer and Bagley, 2005). A temperature-phased two-stage process may benefit for the recirculation of methane fermentation effluent. The increased temperature range in the hydrogen phase not only can improve the thermodynamic favourability of hydrogen production and boost the metabolic activities of HPB, but also inhibit most of the hydrogen consumers under mesophilic conditions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of hydrogen fermentation (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Maru et al., 2013). Chu et al. (2008) combined thermophilic hydrogen fermentation and mesophilic methane fermentation for food waste treatment. Thermophilic hydrogen fermentation allowed a short HRT of 1.3days and a high OLR of 38.4gVS/L/d. Meanwhile, the recirculation of methane fermentation effluent made the hydrogen fermentation stable without additional alkali. The low HRT and pH successfully maintained high-performance hydrogen fermentation. A stable SHY of 205mL/gVS and SMY of 464mL/gVS were achieved via continuous operation over 150days. The two-stage process also exhibits advantages over the single-stage process under thermophilic conditions. Pakarinen et al. (2009) compared the two-stage process combining thermophilic hydrogen fermentation and mesophilic methane fermentation with single-stage mesophilic methane fermentation using grass silage as a substrate. The results showed an 8% increase in SMY (467mL/gVS) in the two-stage system compared with the single-stage system (431mL/gVS). Luo et al. (2011) investigated the effects of HRT and OLR on two-stage systems under a thermophilic environment using waste stillage, rapeseed cake and glycerol as substrates. The two-stage system, under an optimal HRT of 3days for a hydrogen reactor and 12days for a methane reactor, showed an increase of 11% in EY under OLR of 3gVS/L/d compared with single-stage methane fermentation. As the OLR further increased to 4.5gVS/L/d, the two-stage system remained stable, whereas the single-stage system failed. 2.2.4 Role of synthetic biology Synthetic biology would be very beneficial for the enhancement of biogas production and maximising efficiency toward thermodynamic optimum (Savage et al., 2008). For feedstock improvement, possible strategies include: engineering energy crops and algae to improve biomass productivity; synthesise more desirable polymers that are easily degradable; and development of novel enzymes to improve biomass hydrolysis in fermentation (Savage et al., 2008). For inoculum improvement, systems metabolic engineering, such as high-throughput screening, gene synthesis, and enzyme and pathway engineering, would be very helpful for improving strain performance during biogas production (Jang et al., 2012). Strain engineering has been successfully applied in hydrogen fermentation systems operated with single-species cultures, such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Clostridium butyricum. Approaches include: overexpression of genes encoding for substrate utilisation; blocking the formation of by-products via molecular methodologies; and activating the pathway regulating carbon flux towards desired products (Abo-Hashesh et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011; Soo et al., 2015). For mixed culture systems, the addition of improved or wild type strains would be possible to enhance the rate-limiting stage (such as hydrolysis) to improve the overall performance of biogas production. To achieve economical and sustainable biogas production, more work on strain engineering should be devoted to improving the yield and rate of yield of gaseous biofuels (methane and hydrogen) produced from a wide range of inexpensive substrates (Jang et al., 2012)."
7,Biogas upgrading with carbon dioxide removal,"Raw biogas mainly comprises abundant methane (40%–75%) and carbon dioxide (15%–60%), and trace amounts of water (5%–10%), hydrogen sulphide (0.005%–2%), ammonia (<1%), nitrogen (0%–5%), oxygen (0%–2%), carbon monoxide (<0.6%), halogenated hydrocarbons (<0.6%), siloxanes (0%–0.02%) and organic sulphur molecules (<0.002%) (Basu et al., 2010; Chaemchuen et al., 2013; Scholz et al., 2013; Weiland, 2010). The transformation of biogas to meet the standard of vehicle fuel (see Table 11 ) includes: (1) a cleaning process, in which the trace components that are harmful to the natural gas grid and end-users are purified, and (2) an upgrading process, in which carbon dioxide is removed to increase the heating value and relative density to meet the specification of the Wobbe index (Petersson and Wellinger, 2009; Ryckebosch et al., 2011). The purified and upgraded biogas, which typically contains an MC higher than 97% and carbon dioxide content less than 3%, can be compressed and further used as transport fuel (Ryckebosch et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2015c)."
8,Current biogas upgrading technologies,"3.1 Current biogas upgrading technologies Carbon dioxide removal is the most important step for the transformation of biogas to meet the standard of vehicle fuel (Ryckebosch et al., 2011). The current 276 biogas upgrading units has been identified by IEA Bioenergy Task 37 (IEA Bioenergy, 2014). Germany has the highest number of upgrading units (121), but this number is relatively low compared with the total number of biogas plants (ca. 8000) (German Biogas Association, 2014). This relatively low number of upgrading facilities is due to the fact that the feed-in tariffs for electricity in Germany are high and have led to electricity production in most biogas plants. By contrast, Sweden favours the use of biogas as a transport fuel, and has a high percentage of upgrading units in biogas plants (55/242) because of the tax exemption policy (German Biogas Association, 2014). The current techniques of biogas upgrading units are as shown in Fig. 4 . Water scrubbing is the current dominant technique (41%), followed by chemical scrubbing (22%) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) (21%). Membrane separation has been employed by 10% of upgrading units, and this technique has shown rapid growth in recent years. Organic scrubbing and cryogenic separation have been employed in the remaining upgrading units (IEA Bioenergy, 2014). The advantages and disadvantages of current upgrading techniques are summarised in Table 12 . Selection of the best technique is dependent on the specific parameters of the biogas plant, such as the electricity price, availability of inexpensive heat and presence of a supplier for this technique. For instance, water scrubber units are highly common in Sweden, whereas PSA units are preferred in Germany (Ryckebosch et al., 2011). The upgrading cost is dependent on the size of the plant and the specific technique; it decreases with increasing capacity of the biogas plant (Petersson and Wellinger, 2009). Generally, biogas upgrading takes 3%–6% of the energy in biogas and may cost €10/GJ in small biogas plants (Chaemchuen et al., 2013)."
9,Alternative biogas upgrading technologies,"3.2 Alternative biogas upgrading technologies Carbon dioxide can be efficiently removed from biogas via current techniques, such as water scrubbing and PSA; however, it is usually released to the atmosphere, leading to the global warming effect (Gunnarsson et al., 2014; Ryckebosch et al., 2011). Current carbon dioxide capture and storage techniques are expensive, making the combination of biogas upgrading and carbon dioxide utilisation more attractive (Aresta et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2015c). 3.2.1 Sabatier reaction with hydrogen from surplus renewable electricity 3.2.1.1 The concept of power to gas (P2G) The concept of P2G combines two stages. The former stage converts water to hydrogen and oxygen using electricity through electrolysis. The later stage converts hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane and water via methanation (Mohd Yasin et al., 2015; Vandewalle et al., 2015). A reliable P2G process depends on cheap electricity and a cheap carbon dioxide source (Ahern et al., 2015). Cheap electricity may be sourced from surplus renewable electricity, such as wind electricity (when supply exceeds demand), whereas cheap carbon dioxide may be sourced from flue gases produced from power plants and anaerobic digesters (Persson et al., 2014). The combination of biogas production and P2G (see Fig. 5 ) can simultaneously upgrade biogas and improve the methane yield. 3.2.1.2 Biogas upgrading by methanation Methanation (see Methanogenesis in Table 7) can be either catalytic or biological. This process is exothermic (ΔH 0 =−252.8kJ) and thermodynamically favourable (ΔG 0 =−130.4kJ) under standard conditions. Catalytic methanation (Sabatier reaction) is usually performed at high temperatures (e.g., 300°C) and high pressures (e.g., 5–20MPa) with the aid of a nickel-based catalyst. The impurities of biogas, such as hydrogen sulphide, ammonia, halogens and particles, should be removed prior to catalytic methanation (Ahern et al., 2015). Biological methanation is mainly performed by hydrogenotrophic methanogens under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions (Ahern et al., 2015; Vandewalle et al., 2015), which may be realised either via an “in-situ” or “ex-situ” process. An “in-situ” system introduces hydrogen into the biogas production reactor; this can lead to an increase in pH because of the consumption of dissolved carbon dioxide, which may inhibit or reduce methane production (Luo et al., 2012). This process can improve the MC from 50% to approximately 75%; further upgrading processes will still be required for use as transport fuel. The “ex-situ” process is carried out in a separate reactor by methanogens to avoid many biological and mechanical challenges compared with the “in-situ” process. This process may achieve high MC in upgraded biogas for use in transport (Ahern et al., 2015). The low solubility of hydrogen in water is the limiting step for both “in-situ” and “ex-situ” processes. The solubility of hydrogen increases with increasing partial pressure, which can be realised by minimising hydrogen bubble size. Hydrogen may be directly diffused in solution with the aid of microporous ceramic diffusers and hollow fibre membrane modules (Ahern et al., 2015; Luo and Angelidaki, 2013a, 2013b). 3.2.2 Carbon dioxide biofixation by microalgae High-growth rate microalgae have attracted increasing attention in the capture of carbon dioxide from flue gas produced from power plants (Cheng et al., 2013; Pires et al., 2012; Stephenson et al., 2010; Zhao and Su, 2014). Carbon dioxide fixation by microalgae via efficient photosynthesis (Eq. (9)) also offers an alternative approach for biogas upgrading (Ho et al., 2011; Zhao and Su, 2014). (9) 6 C O 2 + 6 H 2 O → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 O 2 3.2.2.1 Microalgal upgrading system Several studies have reported biogas upgrading by microalgae (Prajapati et al., 2013). Mann et al. (2009) employed microalgae Chlorella sp. to upgrade biogas directly, and found that the carbon dioxide content in biogas can be significantly reduced by 97%. Nevertheless, the increasing oxygen levels to approximately 20% via photosynthesis make the gas mixture potentially explosive. This gas mixture needs a high energy input and expensive process to further separate oxygen (Chaemchuen et al., 2013; Ryckebosch et al., 2011). Similar studies by others also led to oxygen content concentrations in a range of 10%–24% (Converti et al., 2009; Kao et al., 2012a; Kao et al., 2012b). According to Eq. (9), the volume of fixed carbon dioxide is equal to the produced oxygen by photosynthesis. However, carbon dioxide can also be captured by dissolving into water, particularly in an alkali environment (Cheng et al., 2013). Thus direct biogas upgrading by microalgae may be restricted by photosynthetic oxygen production. Xia et al. (2015c) suggested an indirect system for biogas upgrading, which comprises carbon dioxide capture by carbonate solution and carbonate regeneration by microalgal cultivation. In the first stage, carbon dioxide in biogas can be fixed by carbonate solution under alkali environment and formed as bicarbonate, as shown in Eq. (10). In the second stage, bicarbonate can be used as a carbon source for microalgal growth. According to the carbon concentration mechanisms, most of the microalgae can import carbon dioxide and bicarbonate through their cell membranes (Chi et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2011). Imported carbon dioxide and bicarbonate mainly accumulate as bicarbonate, with a typical concentration range of 20–40mM (Chi et al., 2011). Carbonic anhydrase in carboxysome can convert accumulated bicarbonate to carbon dioxide (see Eq. (11)), which is further fixed via the Calvin cycle to produce organic carbon (e.g., glucose; see Eq. (9)) (Chi et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2011; Zhao and Su, 2014). The conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide generates hydroxide and increases pH, resulting in carbonate production (Eq. (12)) (Chi et al., 2011). Overall, carbonate is recovered from bicarbonate via carbon dioxide biofixation by microalgae. (10) C O 2 + C O 3 2 − + H 2 O → 2 HC O 3 − (11) HC O 3 − → C O 2 + O H − (12) HC O 3 − + O H − → H 2 O + C O 3 2 − An indirect two-stage microalgal upgrading system may exhibit several advantages compared with a direct system. Firstly, high energy required by the gas distribution system in a photo-bioreactor, which usually consumes more than 38% of the energy in the produced microalgae, can be avoided (Pegallapati et al., 2014). Less energy through stirring can be used as an alternative approach to prevent biomass settling in the indirect system. In addition, carbon dioxide is easily stored in bicarbonate solution at night and then used for microalgal cultivation in the day. Furthermore, high concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate are associated with alkali condition (8.5–10.0) and high ion concentration (0.2–1.0M Na+); a parasitic microbial contamination system can be prevented in microalgal cultivation (Ananyev et al., 2008; Chi et al., 2011). 3.2.2.2 Microalgal–bacterial upgrading system A recent study conducted by Bahr et al. (2014) demonstrated the feasibility of using mixed cultures of microalgae and hydrogen sulphide-oxidising bacteria to upgrade biogas in an absorption column connected with a high rate algal pond. Carbon dioxide can be fixed by microalgae via photosynthesis, whereas the produced oxygen can be consumed by hydrogen sulphide-oxidising bacteria to oxidise hydrogen sulphide in biogas to sulphate. The authors achieved 90% of carbon dioxide removal efficiency and 100% of hydrogen sulphide removal efficiency from simulated biogas (nitrogen instead of methane); meanwhile, the oxygen concentration in upgraded biogas was less than 0.2% (Bahr et al., 2014). A further study optimised the biogas flow rate and external liquid recirculation/biogas ratio for biogas upgrading by microalgal-bacterial processes in the similar systems (Serejo et al., 2015). 3.2.2.3 Advanced system integrating coastal biogas production and offshore biogas upgrading Offshore systems may significantly reduce the cost and energy requirement for microalgal cultivation. For instance, an “Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae” (OMEGA) system has been developed using flexible and clear plastic photo-bioreactors attached to floating infrastructures in marine environments (NASA, 2012). The OMEGA system may offer some advantages in energy, economics, land use, cooling, water and mixing over conventional land-based systems. Solar and wind facilities can be integrated in this system (Ziolkowska and Simon, 2014). A future biogas system for transport fuel production may integrate a coastal biogas plant (biogas production from coastal biomass) and a modified OMEGA system (offshore biogas upgrading by microalgae), as shown in Fig. 6 . Coastal biomass, such as algal (macro and micro) and agricultural biomass maybe used as substrate for biogas production. Biogas is purified to remove impurities (e.g., hydrogen sulphide) and then upgraded by microalgae to meet the vehicle fuel standard. Indirect microalgal biogas upgrading involving the carbonate/bicarbonate cycle may be applied in this system. The produced microalgae are concentrated and used as co-substrates for further biogas production. The liquid effluent from biogas production can provide various nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus sources) for microalgal cultivation (Cheng et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015)."
10,Gaseous biofuels in transport system,
11,Hydrogen and methane,"4.1 Hydrogen and methane 4.1.1 Characteristics of methane and hydrogen as transport fuel Table 13 presents a comparison of physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and methane as transport fuel in engine. The mass lower heating value (LHV) of hydrogen (120MJ/kg) is 2.4 times higher than that of methane (50MJ/kg); however, hydrogen has a low density under normal temperature and pressure (NTP; 293.15K, 1atm), leading to a low volumetric LHV of 10.0MJ/m3, which is much lower compared with methane (32.6MJ/m3) (Bauer and Forest, 2001a). Compared with methane, the wide range flammable limits of hydrogen, which shows that flammable mixtures can range from as rich as λ =0.14 to as lean as λ =10 (0.1< φ <0.7), facilitate a wide power output range of engine via variations in the mixture equivalence ratio (Verhelst and Wallner, 2009). The burning speed of hydrogen in NTP air (265–325cm/s) is about seven times higher than that of methane, resulting in a shorter combustion time and less heat transfer from the hydrogen flame. Consequently, only 17%–25% of the thermal energy produced in hydrogen combustion is lost to the surrounding environment via radiation. The quenching distance of hydrogen in NTP air (0.064cm) is only about one-third of the quenching distance of methane (Bauer and Forest, 2001a). 4.1.2 Distribution The natural gas distribution system is mature and extensive in numerous counties (Murphy and Thamsiriroj, 2011; Thamsiriroj et al., 2011). Current natural gas pipelines can be used to distribute hydrogen with some modifications. For example, the use of steel that is less prone to hydrogen embrittlement under pressure is necessary for hydrogen pipelines, particularly for very pure hydrogen (>99.5%) (Sherif et al., 2015). Modification of the distribution system from natural gas to hydrogen may require significant infrastructural investment cost and intensive energy. Similarly, construction of a hydrogen distribution system may involve massive infrastructure projects over several years (Murphy and Thamsiriroj, 2011; Thamsiriroj et al., 2011). 4.1.3 Compression Hydrogen and methane must be compressed as vehicle fuel because of their low volumetric energy density compared with diesel (37MJ/L) (Murphy and Thamsiriroj, 2011). The current standard of hydrogen compression is 70MPa; this process may consume 15% of the total energy content in hydrogen (Jensen et al., 2007). By contrast, compressed methane (20–22MPa), which is the similar volumetric energy density to compressed hydrogen, only requires 3.3% of the energy in methane. Furthermore, safety for compressing hydrogen to 70MPa is an important issue (Murphy and Thamsiriroj, 2011). 4.1.4 Role of methane and hydrogen in transport system Natural gas or methane vehicles have potential to replace petrol and diesel vehicles in the near future; they are less polluting, and the fuels are wildly available. Hydrogen is a cleaner and more promising fuel in the long term, but hydrogen systems may still require a significant period to develop (e.g., safety, distribution, cost and availability) (Bauer and Forest, 2001a; Murphy and Thamsiriroj, 2011; Sherif et al., 2015)."
12,Hythane,"4.2 Hythane 4.2.1 Hythane as transport fuel The high ignition temperature, slow burning speed and narrow flammability range of methane (see Table 13) lead to high energy requirements of ignition and relatively poor combustion efficiencies for methane vehicles or NGVs. However, the addition of hydrogen to methane, namely, hythane, may overcome several disadvantages of pure methane in engines. Firstly, the ignition temperature and energy requirement of methane can be reduced by the addition of hydrogen, resulting in less energy input during ignition. Secondly, the burning speed of methane can be significantly improved by introducing hydrogen, thereby reducing the combustion duration and improving heat efficiency. Thirdly, the narrow flammability range of methane can be remarkably extended with the aid of hydrogen, enhancing fuel efficiency. Fourthly, the carbon to hydrogen ratio is reduced by adding hydrogen, leading to less carbon dioxide emissions (Liu et al., 2013). Furthermore, the improved combustion efficiency by adding hydrogen can further reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions (e.g., nitrogen monoxide and carbon monoxide) (Bauer and Forest, 2001b). Hythane may play an important role in the transport system during the transition period from a fossil fuel-based society to a hydrogen-based society (Bauer and Forest, 2001a; Liu et al., 2013). Hythane has been commercially used as transport fuel in USA and India, and has received worldwide attention from many companies, such Air Products and Volvo (Das et al., 2000; Eden Energy, 2013; Liu et al., 2013). 4.2.2 Flexible biohythane production via fermentation Hythane may comprise 10%–25% of hydrogen in the mixed gas of hydrogen and methane (Liu et al., 2013). Previous studies have demonstrated that two-stage fermentation combining hydrogen and methane production can provide a promising hythane source, with a wide range of hydrogen fractions (1%–75%) (Cooney et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009; Pakarinen et al., 2009; Ting and Lee, 2007). The hydrogen fraction in produced biogas can be flexibly controlled by the feedstock compositions (e.g., carbohydrate to protein ratio) and operational parameters (e.g., pre-treatment, microorganism option and HRTs in hydrogen and methane reactors) to fulfil the requirements of hythane as a transport fuel (Liu et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2015a)."
13,Potential of biogas as transport fuel,"4.3 Potential of biogas as transport fuel 4.3.1 Future biogas systems Three integrated biogas production and upgrading systems, which may have potential for use in future applications, have been compared in Table 14 . Scenario 1: Conventional biogas production and upgrading system. This system is based on the dominant technique in EU. Biogas production is mainly sourced from AD of land-based crops and manure. Other organic wastes, such as food wastes, industrial wastes and OFMSWs, may also be used as substrates in this system. The upgrading unit mainly employs relatively inexpensive techniques, such as water scrubbing and PSA (IEA Bioenergy, 2014). Carbon dioxide is released to the environment after the upgrading process (Gunnarsson et al., 2014; Ryckebosch et al., 2011). This system offers methane as a transport fuel, and has a theoretical EY of 14.8GJ/t VS using substrates rich in carbohydrates (Eq. (13)). (13) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 3 C O 2 + 3 C H 4 Scenario 2: Conventional biogas production and surplus P2G system. This system employs the conventional biogas production technique similar to Scenario 1; however, the upgrading technique is based on the P2G concept. Hydrogen derived from electrolysis powered by surplus renewable electricity is introduced to biological or catalytic processes for biogas upgrading (Ahern et al., 2015). Carbon dioxide is converted to methane, thereby doubling the potential of SMY. This system provides a theoretical EY of 29.7GJ/tVS (Eq. (14)). (14) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 12 H 2 → 6 C H 4 + 6 H 2 O Scenario 3: Coastal biogas production and upgrading system. Land-based biomass and marine-based biomass (e.g., algae) may be used as substrates in this system. Two-stage biogas fermentation combining hydrogen and methane production (see Eq. (15) which allows the maximum SHY (4mol/mol glucose) obtained in the first stage fermentation) is used to replace the single-stage methane production system. The biogas upgrading process is integrated with microalgal cultivation (Eq. (9)). The produced microalgae can be used as co-substrates to improve biogas production. The theoretical EY of this system (48.7GJ/tVS; see Eq. (16) which is obtained by combining Eq. (9) and Eq. (15)) is approximately three times higher than that of conventional system (Scenario 1), which is attributed to the fact that produced microalgae increase the substrate inputs (Xia et al., 2015c). (15) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 C O 2 + 4 H 2 + 2 C H 4 (16) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 18 H 2 O → 12 H 2 + 6 C H 4 + 12 O 2 4.3.2 Potential of biogas production as transport fuel: a case study in China In 2012, the transport sector of China consumed 10EJ (or 240Mtoe equivalent), corresponding to 9.6% of the global transport energy consumption (IEA, 2012, 2014). Biogas has great potential to be used in the transport sector in China. However, China has a large population and relatively low levels of arable land per person; this limits the use of land-based energy crops for biogas production. By contrast, various organic wastes are abundant in China, and can be potentially used as substrates (see Table 15 ). Typical organic wastes in China include straws (annual productivity: 830Mt; VS content: 77%), manure (annual productivity: 3800Mt; VS content: 21%) and food wastes (annual productivity: 83Mt; VS content 20%) (Chen et al., 2014b; Kiran et al., 2014b; Miao et al., 2014; National Development and Reform Commision, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). If 60% of theoretical energy values of produced gaseous fuels (as suggested in Table 14) are achieved, straws, manure and food wastes may fulfil 56.8%–186.7%, 70.9%–233.2% and 1.5%–4.9% of the transport energy requirement in China, respectively, which are dependent on different scenario systems. 4.3.2.1 Application of Scenario 1 Scenario 1 has the lowest gaseous fuel output based on the original substrate. However, this system involves mature proven commercially available techniques both in biogas production and upgrading, and has been operated in many countries (IEA Bioenergy, 2014). Various organic wastes, which are dependent on location, can be used as substrates in this system. For instance, straws and manure can be used as the main substrates in agricultural areas, such as Henan Province, Hunan Province, Hubei Province and Sichuan Province. By contrast, food wastes and OFMSWs may be used as the main substrates in well-populated urban areas, such as Beijing and Shanghai. 4.3.2.2 Application of Scenario 2 Scenario 2 may achieve a higher gaseous fuel output compared with Scenario 1. However, methanation is not a mature technique. Only a few demonstration methanation systems were in operation by 2014. Furthermore, methanation requires surplus electricity input. For instance, upgrading of 1m3 biogas under standard temperature and pressure may require 6.9–10.0kWh of electricity input (overall efficiency of P2G: 55%–80%) (Ahern et al., 2015). Surplus renewable electricity, such as wind electricity, may be used in this system. China is one of the top wind power producing countries; in 2012, the installed capacity of wind power in China reached 75GW, making China the largest wind energy market in the world (Jin et al., 2014). However, the production capacity of wind turbines is much higher than the domestic grid demand. The gap between installed capacity and integrated capacity indicates that a large proportion of installed capacity cannot access the power grid. Approximately 30% of wind turbines are idling, which may produce large amounts of surplus electricity (Ming et al., 2013). Furthermore, wind turbines can also produce surplus electricity at night when the electricity demand is low. Such surplus electricity should be used effectively. The P2G system offers an option to store surplus electricity in the form of methane. This system has the potential to be used in areas abundant in wind power, such as Inner Mongolia, Gansu Province and Hebei Province (Ming et al., 2013). 4.3.2.3 Application of Scenario 3 Scenario 3 may use marine-based biomass (e.g., microalgae and macroalgae) to produce various gaseous biofuels (e.g., methane and hythane). This system has the highest potential of gaseous biofuel output; however, the techniques for this system are not mature. To our knowledge, neither biogas production using algal biomass nor biogas upgrading by microalgae has been commercialised. In biogas production, several technical issues, such as sodium toxicity, hydrogen sulphide inhibition and bacterial accessibility, need to be addressed to further improve the stability and the EY of biogas production from algal biomass (Allen et al., 2014; Montingelli et al., 2015; Sialve et al., 2009; Ward et al., 2014). Currently, microalgal cultivation is technically feasible, but it is not economically feasible (Mussgnug et al., 2010). The high-value components, such as human nutrition, fine chemicals, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, can be extracted before biogas production to improve economic feasibility (Zhu, 2015). For some lipid-rich species, biodiesel production via lipid extraction may also be applied (Sialve et al., 2009). This system may be realised in coastal areas. Temperature is a key factor for large-scale microalgal cultivation. On an annual basis, the acceptable minimum temperature for microalgal cultivation is in the range of 10–35°C, whereas the maximum temperature for microalgal cultivation is in the range of 15–40°C (Speranza et al., 2015). The southeast coastlines of China (e.g., Hainan Province, Guangxi Province, Guangdong Province, Fujian Province and Zhejiang Province) may be suitable to apply such a system."
14,Perspective and conclusion,"There are many routes to abundant levels of renewable electricity both in the literature and in practice; these include for example wind power and photovoltaic systems. This is not the case for renewable transport fuel. Across the planet existing levels of renewable energy in transport are a small fraction of renewable electricity. Nor is there an agreed road map for renewable transport fuel. Solutions have been suggested for second and third generation biofuel systems (e.g., lignocellulosic bioethanol systems and microalgal biodiesel systems) but these are not as yet commercially available or financially viable. Biogas systems are well understood and well used. However innovative techniques can greatly enhance the generated output through production of hydrogen, storage of surplus electricity and growth of microalgae. Biogas systems and innovations in such systems as proposed in this paper can provide abundant levels of renewable transport energy. Three scenarios (proposed in Table 15) may be viewed as: available now (Scenario 1: conventional biogas production and upgrading); available in the next ten years (Scenario 2: conventional biogas production and P2G); and in twenty years (Scenario 3: two-stage biogas production and microalgal biogas upgrading). Applications of these scenarios show that the potential for China (most populated country on planet Earth) can lead to ca. 130% renewable transport fuel with Scenario 1 if all residues (straws, manures and food wastes) are collected and treated. Scenario 2 can double the output; while Scenario 3 can triple the output."
