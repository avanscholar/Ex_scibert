1,Potential of mean force calculations,"1.1 Potential of mean force calculations Here, the QM/MM simulations (Hu et al., 2008; Senn et al., 2009) with the umbrella-sampling method (Torrie et al., 1977) were carried out using Amber 12 program to identify the activation free energy for the zwitterion formation step from the reaction of MEA with CO2 in various solvents. The semi-empirical method PM3-PDDG (parameterized model 3 improved by pairwise distance directed Gaussian function) (Repasky et al., 2002; Walker et al., 2008) was selected as the QM method for all studied systems. Our previous study found the potential for CO2 attacking N-atom of MEA to form zwitterion at PM3-PDDG level is qualitatively consistent with one at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) (the Becke's three-parameter exchange (B3)+Lee-Yang-Parr (LYP) correlation functional) level although the PM3-PDDG slightly underestimates the stability of zwitterion compared with B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) method (Sousa et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2014, 2010). Therefore, it is expected that PM3-PDDG/MM method can qualitatively predict the difference in activation free energy and stability of zwitterion for the zwitterion formation step in various solvents. In addition, some critical results are further confirmed by QM/MM simulation with B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) as QM method within Gaussian 09 package (Frisch et al., 2009) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The QM/MM simulation systems were built by immersing one MEA and one CO2 in various solvents with periodic boundary conditions. 2238 water molecules, 1587 MEA molecules, 1584 CHCl3 molecules, 1586 PA molecules and 1159 MA molecules were involved in their respective simulation systems (Appendix A Fig. S3). The QM subsystem consists of CO2 and MEA for all studied systems, while all solvent molecules were treated with molecular mechanics. The TIP3P (transferable intermolecular potential with 3 points) model (Jorgensen et al., 1983; Wang et al., 2004; Zielkiewicz, 2005) for water and general Amber force field for MEA, PA, CHCl3 and MA were employed. Computational densities by adopted force field parameters agree well with corresponding values from experiments for pure solvents (Appendix A Table S1), indicating the reliability of the adopted force field for solvents. For the PM3-PDDG/MM simulation, it was carried out in two successive steps. Each system was equilibrated in NPT (a fixed number of atoms N, pressure P, and temperature T) ensemble for 200–300 psec (Appendix A Fig. S2), followed by 1 nsec NVT (a fixed number of atoms N, volume V, and temperature T) ensemble production simulation with the umbrella-sampling method for each window. The configuration of last step in 1 nsec simulation with PM3-PDDG/MM potential was selected as initial one for 50 psec NVT ensemble simulation with B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM potential. In all QM/MM simulations, the time step was 1 fsec and Newton's equations of motion were integrated with the Beeman algorithm. Cutoff (10 Å) was employed for both electrostatic and all non-bonded interactions. The long-range electrostatic energy was evaluated using the particle-mesh Ewald summation (Cerutti et al., 2010). The trajectory was saved every 1000 fsec in simulation with PM3-PDDG/MM potential for further hydrogen bond capacity analysis. The distance between the C atom of CO2 and the N atom of MEA was chosen as the reaction coordinate. Thirty-six NVT-ensemble simulation windows were placed along the reaction coordinate from 5.0 to 1.5 Å and per window was run with harmonic-restraint potentials imposed on the reaction coordinate (x) between the N atom of MEA and C atom of CO2. (1) V(x) = k (x – x 0)2 where V(x) is harmonic-restraint potential, the force constant is k = 20 kcal/(mol·Å2) and the “equilibrium” reaction coordinate (x 0) for a given window is set every 0.1 Å from 5.0 to 1.5 Å. The points from the PM3-PDDG/MM simulations were saved every 0.1 psec and a total number of 10,000 points were collected for each window. The points from the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM simulations were saved every 20 fsec and a total number of 2500 points were collected for each window. To determine the potential of mean force (PMF) for all studied systems, we processed the data from all the windows using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) (Kumar et al., 1992). The bin dimension and temperature applied in the WHAM calculation of the PMF was 0.05 Å and 298 K, respectively."
2,Hydrogen bond capacity analysis,"1.2 Hydrogen bond capacity analysis Currently, there is no appropriate empirical parameter to describe the hydrogen bond capacity. We noted that Seiler et al. tried to use the difference between the 1-octanol-water partition coefficient and the cyclohexane-water partition coefficient as a measure of the hydrogen bonding capacity (Seiler et al., 1974). However, el Tayar et al. thought it mainly accounts for the hydrogen bond donor capacity, but not total hydrogen bonding capacity of solvent (el Tayar et al., 1991). In fact, it is understandable that the hydrogen bond capacity of solvent is hard to be quantitatively described by a static parameter since it also depends on the characters of specific solutes. Instead, the hydrogen bond occurrence probability was used to present hydrogen bond capacity of solvents here, a similar strategy used in previous study (el Tayar et al., 1993). The Ptraj module in AMBER 12 was utilized to probe hydrogen bond occurrence probability between MEA + CO2 solute and solvents in the simulation. The hydrogen bond is defined by the geometric criteria, i.e., the distance between X and Y (X = O, N of solvent and Y = O, N of solute) shorter than 3.5 Å and the angle X–H…Y or Y–H…X within 150–180° (Chowdhuri et al., 2002). The hydrogen bond occurrence probability (P HB) can be calculated by the following formula: (2) P HB = N 7000 × 100 % where N is the number forming the hydrogen bonds, 7000 is the total number of hydrogen bonds when all possible hydrogen bond donors and acceptors of MEA and CO2 form hydrogen bonds with solvents. Computational details for the total number of all hydrogen bonds are shown in Appendix A Supplementary data."
3,Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations,"1.3 Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations To further confirm the results obtained from QM/MM simulation, AIMD simulations were performed to assess the stability of zwitterion in PA and CHCl3 solvent. For PA solvent system, the cubic simulation box consists of 1 zwitterion molecule and 21 PA molecules with a cell parameter of 15.211 Å. For the CHCl3 solvent system, the cubic simulation box consists of 1 zwitterion and 35 CHCl3 molecules with a cell parameter of 16.800 Å (Appendix A Fig. S4). Initial configurations in AIMD simulations were obtained by cutting off redundant solvent molecules from PM3-PDDG/MM simulations for windows with N–C equilibrium distance close to identified (or assumed) N–C distance of zwitterion. All AIMD simulations were performed in NVT ensemble for 10 psec by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP, version 5.4.1) (Hafner, 2008). The time step is 1 fsec. The simulation temperature was set as 298 K. Periodic density functional theory (DFT) with the PW91 exchange-correlation functional was used for electronic structure calculation (Perdew et al., 1996). The projector augmented wave (PAW) method with a potpaw GGA-wave basis set was employed to describe the interaction between the core and valence electrons (Blochl et al., 2003). Given the simulation system is asymmetric, only the gamma point was sampled for Brillouin zone integration."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Potential of mean force calculations with PM3-PDDG/MM potential,"2.1 Potential of mean force calculations with PM3-PDDG/MM potential The PMF curves, obtained at PM3-PDDG/MM level and 298 K, for C-atom of CO2 approaching N-atom of MEA from 5.0 to 1.5 Å in five selected solvents were presented in Fig. 1 . It can be observed that, except CHCl3, the free energy increases with the decrease of C–N distance from 5.0 Å to about 1.8–2.0 Å in all solvents, where the free energy reaches a maximum. The maximum corresponds to the transition state structure for the zwitterion formation reaction. Then, the free energy decreases from the transition state to a local minimum with the C–N distances about 1.6 Å. The local minimum corresponds to the zwitterion intermediate MEA+COO−. Exactly, the C–N distances of transition states in water, MA, MEA, PA, are 2.02, 1.84, 2.02 and 1.93 Å, and corresponding distances of zwitterion are 1.63, 1.66, 1.63, 1.63 Å, respectively. The snapshots of transition states and zwitterion in different solvent are presented in Appendix A Fig. S5. In CHCl3 solvent, the free energy continuously increases with the decrease of C–N distance from 5.0 to 1.5 Å, indicating that the transition state and the zwitterion intermediate are not formed in CHCl3 solvent, and therefore no zwitterion formation reaction occurs between MEA and CO2 in CHCl3 solvent. Since the dielectric constant of CHCl3 is similar to that of PA (Table 1), the key difference between CHCl3 and PA that could affect the chemical process of MEA with CO2 is the hydrogen bond capacity (CHCl3 can not form hydrogen bond with solute, while PA can). Therefore, the different reaction process of CO2 toward MEA in CHCl3 and PA solvents indicates that the hydrogen bond capacity of solvent plays a vital role in determining the zwitterion formation from MEA and CO2. The activation free energies (ΔG ‡) for the zwitterion formation predicted by PMF calculation are 11.0, 10.6, 11.2 and 12.6 kcal/mol in water, MEA, PA and MA solvent, respectively. Obviously, ΔG ‡ in MA (ΔG ‡ MA) solvent is the highest among all considered solvents and the ΔG ‡ in water (ΔG ‡ Water), MEA (ΔG ‡ MEA) and PA (ΔG ‡ PA) are similar. In addition, the free energy difference (ΔG Z-T) between zwitterion and corresponding transition state, an important parameter affecting the kinetics of reaction of MEA with CO2 (the greater ΔG Z-T, the more favorable the formation of zwitterion in kinetics) (Xie et al., 2010), are 2.2, 1.6, 0.9 and 0.3 kcal/mol in water, MEA, PA, and MA solvent, respectively. ΔG Z-T is the highest in water solvent and is the lowest in MA solvent. It deserves mentioning that the dielectric constant of PA is the lowest among all considered solvents, and MA is similar to that of MEA, which both are lower than that of water. Thus, there is no good relationship between ΔG ‡/ΔG Z-T and dielectric constant of solvent, implying dielectric constant of solvent is not the only important parameter to determine reaction kinetics of MEA with CO2. Combined with results from the comparison for the chemical process of zwitterion formation from the reaction of MEA with CO2 in CHCl3 and PA solvent, it can be concluded that the hydrogen bond capacity of solvents plays an important role in determining the occurrence or kinetics of the reaction of MEA with CO2."
6,Hydrogen bond occurrence probability analysis,"2.2 Hydrogen bond occurrence probability analysis To identify the difference in hydrogen bond occurrence probability between MEA + CO2 solute with solvent molecules in various solvents, three typical windows with C–N equilibrium distance 5.0 Å and close to identified C–N distance of zwitterion, transition state from PMF simulation were selected as trajectories of reactants, zwitterion and transition state, to do hydrogen bond occurrence probability analysis. Since no hydrogen bond can be formed between MEA + CO2 solute and CHCl3 solvent molecules, hydrogen bond occurrence probability between MEA + CO2 and CHCl3 is zero. Therefore, hydrogen bond occurrence probability statistics were only performed in water, MA, MEA and PA solvents with Ptraj module in Amber 12. Results of hydrogen bond occurrence probability were shown in Fig. 2 and the detailed statistical data of different types hydrogen bonds are summarized in Appendix A Table S2. As can be seen in Fig. 2, for each solvent, the hydrogen bond occurrence probability of zwitterion (P Z), transition state (P T) and reactant (P R) follows an order of P Z > P T > P R. This indicates that with the decreasing C–N distance in the process of C-atom of CO2 attacking N-atom of MEA, the interaction between MEA and CO2 increases the hydrogen bond capacity of MEA + CO2 solute. The zwitterion formation leads to more hydrogen bond formation between MEA + CO2 solute and solvents. However, for the same species of MEA + CO2 system, the hydrogen bond occurrence probability is different in various solvents. The hydrogen bond occurrence probability (P water, P MEA, P PA and P MA in water, MEA, PA and MA) for the same species in various solvents follows P water > P MEA > P PA > P MA, well consistent with the order of ΔG Z-T and little different from the order of stability of transition states (which reverses to the order of ΔG ‡ (ΔG ‡ MEA < ΔG ‡ Water < ΔG ‡ PA < ΔG ‡ MA)) with MEA as an exception in these solvents (detailed relationship between the kinetic parameters ( Δ G Z − T and ΔG ‡) and hydrogen bond capacity (P) is presented in Appendix A Fig. S7). Thus, the hydrogen bond capacity of solvent is more relevant to the kinetics of MEA with CO2 than the dielectric constant of solvent. More importantly, for solvents MEA and MA, which have the similar dielectric constant, the zwitterion formation in MEA solvent with higher hydrogen bond capacity is more favorable than that in MA solvent since the reaction in MEA solvent has higher Δ G Z − T and lower ΔG ‡. Besides, for solvents CHCl3 and PA, which have a similar dielectric constant and different hydrogen bond capacity, MEA can not react with CO2 in CHCl3 solvent, but can in PA solvent. These could indicate that the hydrogen bond capacity of solvents is more important than dielectric constant in determining kinetics of MEA with CO2. To be best of our knowledge, it is the first time to point the importance of hydrogen bond capacity of solvent in affecting the reaction kinetics of amine with CO2."
7,"B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM and AIMD simulations","2.3 B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM and AIMD simulations Perhaps the most questionable part of the above results is that low-level PM3-PDDG method is used to simulate solute and molecular mechanics method is used to simulate solvent. Here, both PMF with B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM potential and AIMD simulation were performed to further confirm the important results from PM3-PDDG/MM method. The difference in reaction process of MEA with CO2 in CHCl3 and PA solvent clearly present the importance of hydrogen bond capacity of solvent in determining the zwitterion formation from the reaction of MEA with CO2. Thus, the confirmation simulation is only performed on the reaction of MEA with CO2 in CHCl3 and PA solvent to save computational resources. In addition, since the reaction of CO2 with MEA could not occur in CHCl3 solvent and could take a very long time to react in PA solvent, AIMD simulations were performed starting from zwitterion intermediate. The PMF curves, obtained at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM level, for C-atom of CO2 approaching N of MEA from 5.0 to 1.5 Å in PA and CHCl3 solvents are presented in Fig. 3 . As can be seen in Fig. 3, the reaction of MEA with CO2 to form zwitterion still can occur in PA solvent. ΔG ‡ value for the reaction of MEA with CO2 in PA solvent at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM level is lower than that at PM3-PDDG/MM level. However, the reaction still can not occur in CHCl3 solvent. The difference in the reaction process of MEA with CO2 in these two solvents, predicted by B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM level is well consistent with results from PM3-PDDG/MM level. Therefore, although PM3-PDDG/MM potential could not be quantitatively accurate enough, it is still expected it can provide an acceptable qualitative result for the reaction of MEA with CO2 in various solvents. The time evolution of the C–N distance between the C atom of CO2 and N atom of MEA in PA and CHCl3 solvent during 10 psec AIMD simulation is shown in Fig. 4 . In PA solvent (Fig. 4a), the initial C–N distance of zwitterion is 1.64 Å (Appendix A Fig. S4a). The zwitterion keeps stable for the first 1.1 psec and then separates to form CO2 and MEA. This indirectly indicates that zwitterion can be formed in the PA solvent, however, the lifetime is short. We also try to compare the lifetime from AIMD with that from QM/MM simulation. Based on transition state theory and ΔG ‡ from QM/MM simulation, the lifetime of zwitterion in PA was calculated (see details in Appendix A Supplementary data). The calculated lifetime of zwitterion in PA solvent is 0.687 and 0.723 psec with PM3-PDDG/MM and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM as the potential in the QM/MM simulation, respectively, well consistent with that (1.1 psec) from AIMD simulation. In addition, we also observed that the zwitterion is not formed again during 10 psec simulation after the decomposition. It could be understandable since ΔG ‡ for the reaction of MEA with CO2 is high, it will take a longer time to make the reaction of MEA with CO2 occur than the 10 psec simulation time. In CHCl3 solvent (Fig. 4b), the initial C–N distance of zwitterion is 1.69 Å (Appendix A Fig. S4b). The C–N distance rapidly increased once the simulation was started. Even 1.62 Å was used as the initial C–N distance, the same as in PA solvent, C–N distance still rapidly increased once the simulation was started (Appendix A Fig. S6) in CHCl3 solvent. This indirectly indicates that the zwitterion can not be formed in the CHCl3 solvent, consistent with that from QM/MM simulation. Therefore, the AIMD simulation on the stability of zwitterion further confirms the findings from QM/MM simulation that the reaction of MEA with CO2 can form the zwitterion in PA solvent, but not in the CHCl3 solvent."
8,Conclusions,"Here, to probe the effect of hydrogen bond capacity of solvents on the reaction of amine with CO2, various computational methods including PM3-PDDG/MM, B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/MM and AIMD were employed to investigate the zwitterion formation from the reaction of MEA with CO2 in water, MEA, PA, MA and CHCl3 solvent by explicitly considering the solvent effect. The results indicate that the zwitterion can be formed in water, MEA, PA and MA solvent, but not in CHCl3 solvent. For two pairs of solvents (MA and MEA, PA and CHCl3) with similar dielectric constant but different hydrogen bond capacity, the solvents with higher hydrogen bond capacity (MEA and PA) facilitate the zwitterion formation. More importantly, ΔG ‡ and ΔG Z-T values, two important parameters determining the kinetics of zwitterion formation, are more relevant to the hydrogen bond capacity than to dielectric constant of the solvents. Therefore, it was concluded that the hydrogen bond capacity of solvent is more important than dielectric constant in determining the kinetics of MEA with CO2. To be best of our knowledge, it is the first time to point out the importance of hydrogen bond capacity of solvent in affecting the reaction kinetics of amine with CO2. The hydrogen bond capacity of solvent should be considered in the optimal design of amine for CO2 capture in the future."
