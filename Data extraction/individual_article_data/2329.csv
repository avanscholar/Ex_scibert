0,Introduction,"A large effort to find both renewable and sustainable energy sources is being undertaken around the world. Anaerobic biological processes commonly used to treat wastewaters are able to generate sustainable fuels such as methane or hydrogen, and rather than aerobic processes, are considered to be energy producer systems [1]. Special attention has been paid to biohydrogen production from organic wastes such as wastewaters and organic residues or by-products [2–5]. Regarding biohydrogen production, it is known that the by-products from the dairy industry represent a potential source of substrates for energy generation. Among them, cheese whey (CW), a lactose-rich by-product, which accounts for the 85% of the total volume of processed milk [6] and cheese whey powder (CWP) have been tested. According to Eq. (1), the maximum theoretical hydrogen molar yield (HMY) is 8 mol H2 per mol of lactose consumed, when acetate is the main metabolite produced, whereas HMY of 4 mol mol−1 is typically obtained when the butyric fermentation occurs Eq. (2), [7]. However, the HMY based on lactose could be lower than 4 mol mol−1 if other metabolites such as lactic acid, ethanol, butanol or acetone are also formed [8]. (1) C 12 H 22 O 11 + 5 H 2 O → 4 CH 3 COOH + 4 CO 2 + 8 H 2 (2) C 12 H 22 O 11 + H 2 O → 2 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 4 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Biohydrogen generation by dark fermentation is highly dependent on the process conditions such as temperature, pH, mineral medium formulation, kind of inoculum, profile of organic acids produced, type of substrate and concentration, hydrogen partial pressure, and reactor configuration [9,10]. Particularly, pH is a key parameter in biological processes, because it affects the enzyme activities, the metabolite transport, the microbial community in non-axenic cultures, among others [11,12]; therefore the production media formulation must include buffering compounds to reduce pH variations during cultivations. There are reports about biohydrogen production using CW, and in all cases the use of a carbonated compound in the buffer mineral media such as sodium or ammonium bicarbonate prevails [13–18], presumably because carbonated-media were extensively and successfully used in anaerobic digestion processes (methanogenesis). Unlike methanogenic process where organic acids are consumed, in fermentative hydrogen production besides H2 and CO2 production, there is an intrinsic generation of organic acids mainly acetic, propionic, lactic and butyric. These acids could be toxic to cells, but they also react with the bicarbonate, generating additional dissolved CO2, and the buffer capacity of the medium is diminished (Eq. (3)). (3) HCO 3 − + H + ⇄ H 2 CO 3 ⇄ H 2 O + CO 2 As pH is an important parameter influencing the efficiency and productivity of fermentative biohydrogen process, the use of carbonate-buffered media is being reconsidered [11,12]. In this work phosphate salts were considered as the alternative buffering supplement due to their wide application even at full-scale level processes such as in wastewater treatment plants [11]. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of two different mineral media composition on the important parameters in fermentative hydrogen production such as hydrogen yield, volumetric production and pH profiles due to the change in metabolites’ composition. Besides, the effect on the microbial communities was also analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biohydrogen production experiments,"2.1 Biohydrogen production experiments Cheese whey powder (CWP, Land O'Lakes Inc., Minnesota, USA) was used as a source of lactose (770 g kg−1), and protein (110 g kg−1). All chemicals were purchased as reagent grade from Sigma–Aldrich. Anaerobic granular sludge from a full-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) was used as inoculum for biohydrogen production. The UASB reactor treats wastewater from a candy factory in San Luis Potosí, México. The granular sludge was washed with tap water and then boiled for 40 min to inactivate methanogenic microorganisms. Batch experiments were conducted in duplicate using 120 cm3 vials with a working volume of 80 cm3. Two different mineral media were used: medium A, modified from [19] and medium B, modified from [12]. The mineral media composition is shown in Table 1 . CWP at 25 g dm−3 was used as substrate and the inoculum concentration as volatile suspended solids (VSS) was 4.5 g dm−3. An initial pH of 7.5 was selected and vials were set as previously described [17]. All experiments were performed without pH control in order to follow the pH drop due to volatile fatty acids (VFA) production with each medium. One scale-up batch experiment for each medium was carried out in a 3 dm3 (2.4 dm3 working volume) stirred bioreactor equipped with an ADI 1030 system controller, ADI 1035 bioconsole and BioXpert 1.3 data-acquisition software (Applikon Biotechnology, Schiedam, The Netherlands). Mixing at 4.16 Hz was performed with two Rushton turbines and pH was monitored online using an autocleavable pH electrode (AppliSens, Applikon, Schiedam, The Netherlands). Temperature was kept at 37 °C using an electric jacket. Initial CWP concentration and pH were 25 g dm−3 and 7.5, respectively. Gas production and composition in the headspace were measured periodically as described in analytical methods."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods Gas production was measured using two different liquid-displacement devices filled with acidified water (pH = 2). For the 120 cm3 vials, an inverted burette (250 cm3) modified to have a gas-sampling port in the top was used, while in the case of the 3 dm3 bioreactor, a manometer (SEV, Puebla, México) calibrated to periodically count a fixed volume of gas was employed. Cumulative hydrogen production was calculated for each vial considering the headspace composition and the volume of gas released at each time interval, using a mass balance equation [4,17,20]. Standard condition for temperature and pressure were considered to report gas volumes (0 °C and 101.325 kPa). H2 and CO2 were quantified using a gas chromatograph 6890 N (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The column used was a Hayesep D (Alltech, Deerfield, Illinois, USA). Temperatures of the injection port, oven and the detector were 250, 60 and 250 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow-rate of 12 cm3 min−1. Liquid samples were withdrawn at the end of each experiment (for the 120 cm3 vials) and periodically for the 3 dm3 reactor as follows: 10 cm3 of liquid samples were taken and 0.06 cm3 of HgCl2 (16 g dm−3) were added before centrifugation at 6610g for 15 min to minimize microorganisms activity [21]. Both, remaining substrate and products, such as formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids (VFA) were analyzed in the filtrate by capillary electrophoresis in the same run [17]. Analytes were quantified by comparison with high purity standards. For this purpose a capillary electrophoresis system (Agilent 1600A, Waldbronn, Germany) was used with a basic anion buffer (Agilent, pH = 12.1) and a fused silica capillary column (Agilent, id = 50 μm, L = 80.5 cm, effective length = 72 cm). Temperature and voltage were 20 °C and −30 kV, respectively. The samples were injected with a pressure of 30 kPa for 6 s. Detection was carried out with indirect UV detection using a diode-array detector. The signal wavelength was set at 350 nm with a reference at 230 nm. A buffer flush for 4 min at 1 bar was done prior to each run. Solvents such as acetone, ethanol, propanol and butanol were analyzed by injecting a 1 mm3 sample in a gas chromatograph 6890 N equipped with an auto-sampler 7863 (Agilent, Wilmington, USA) and a capillary column HP-Innowax (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent, Wilmington, USA). Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 cm3 min−1. Temperatures for the injector and flame ionization detector (FID) were 220 and 250 °C, respectively. The solvents’ analyses were performed with a split ratio of 1:0.1 and a temperature program of 35 °C for 2 min, increased to 80 °C (10 °C min−1), and was maintained at this temperature to a final time of 15 min. VSS were analyzed according to the Standard Methods [22]."
4,Data analysis,"2.3 Data analysis Once cumulative hydrogen production was calculated from experimental data, a modified Gompertz equation was used to fit the kinetics of biohydrogen production and to obtain the parameters H max, R max and λ using KaleidaGraph ver. 4.0 (Synergy software). This equation has been widely used to model gas production data [23–26]: (4) H ( t ) = H max • exp { − exp [ 2.71828 • R max H max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where H(t) in cm3 is the total amount of hydrogen produced at culture time t (h); H max (cm3) is the maximal amount of hydrogen produced; R max (cm3 h−1) is the maximum hydrogen production rate; λ (h) is the lag time before exponential hydrogen production. HMY and VHPR were defined as response variables; HMY was calculated from H max and defined as mol H2 (mol consumed substrate)−1 whereas VHPR was obtained from R max standardized to the working volume (cm3 H2 dm−3 h−1). For the experiments in the 3 dm3 reactor, a modeling of the substrate consumption was performed according to a modified Gompertz model Eq. (5), [24]): (5) S 0 − S = S max • exp { − exp [ 2.71828 • R max , S S max ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where S 0 is the initial lactose concentration (g dm−3); S is the lactose concentration (g dm−3) at fermentation time t (h); S max is maximum lactose consumption (g dm−3); R max,S is the maximum lactose consumption rate (g dm−3 h−1); λ is the lag time before exponential substrate consumption (h)."
5,Microbial community analyses by 16S rRNA genes using DGGE,"2.4 Microbial community analyses by 16S rRNA genes using DGGE 2.4.1 DNA extraction Ten-milliliter samples were withdrawn from the 120 cm3 vials at the end of the exponential hydrogen production phase and were stored at −20 °C in glycerol (150 dm3 m−3) until analysis. DNA extraction protocols reported elsewhere [27,28] were optimized to be used on granular sludge samples. In brief, the samples were slowly thawed and 0.5 cm3 were taken and centrifuged at 7000 g for 10 min. The pellet was washed two-times with PBS buffer (10 mmol dm−3, pH 7.5), resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mmol dm−3 Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmol dm−3 EDTA, 0.5 mol dm−3 NaCl) and sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic processor (Sonics & Materials, Newtown, USA). Afterward, the mixture was incubated with 0.01 cm3 of RNase (20 mg cm−3, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), 0.02 cm3 of lysozyme (20 mg cm−3, USB, Cleveland, Ohio, USA) and 0.015 cm3 of proteinase K (20 mg cm−3, Invitrogen, Germany) during 2 h at 37 °C and 5.83 Hz. 0.1 cm3 of SDS (100 g kg−1) and 0.2 cm3 of sodium acetate (5 mol dm−3, pH 8) were added to the mixture and incubated for 10 min at 60 °C. For the purification of the nucleic acids present in the mixture, one volume of chloroform-isoamylic alcohol (24:1) was added, mixed and centrifuged during 10 min at 7000g. This purification step was repeated two times with the liquid supernatant. To precipitate nucleic acids, one volume of isopropanol at −20 °C was added to the supernatant and incubated for 3 h at −20 °C before centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 7000g. The pellet was first washed with absolute ethanol and centrifuged at 7000g for 1min, and then washed again with diluted ethanol (700 cm3 dm−3) and centrifuged with the same conditions. DNA pellet was dried at room temperature and resuspended in 0.05 cm3 of sterile deionized water. A DNA integrity analysis was performed in 10 g dm3 agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide. 2.4.2 PCR amplification Amplification of the hypervariable 3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from the purified nucleic acids preparations was carried out by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Biotools, Spain). The PCR primers used were the forward primer C356F (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGTCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCCCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and the reverse primer 517R (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) described elsewhere by Muyzer et al. [29] for bacterial identification of complex microbial population. The primer C356F contains the GC clamp shown with bold letters led to carry out the DGGE. Reaction conditions were as follows: initial DNA denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min using 1.5 U of Pfu polymerase (Biotools, Madrid, Spain), followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing from 65 to 60 °C for 30 s, lowering the temperature 0.5 °C each cycle, and followed by an extension at 72 °C for 1 min. In addition, 20 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min; with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min were performed. The PCR product was loaded onto a 15 g dm3 agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to assess the size, purity and concentration of DNA. 2.4.3 DGGE analysis DGGE was performed with DCode Universal Mutation Detection System (Biorad, Hercules, California, USA). The PCR products were loaded onto 100 g dm−3 polyacrylamide gels in 1 × TAE buffer (20 mmol dm−3 Tris-acetate, 10 mmol dm−3 sodium acetate, 0.5 mmol dm−3 EDTA, pH 7.4) with a denaturing gradient (urea-formamide) that ranged from 300 to 600 g dm−3. Electrophoresis was carried out at 60 °C at a constant voltage of 39 V during 14 h. After electrophoresis the gel was stained using SYBR© Safe for 30 min (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, Oregon, USA) before being visualized on a UV transilluminator (Biorad, Hercules, California, USA). The dominant bands were excised from the gel, eluted in 10 mmol dm−3 Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C. The eluted DNA was reamplified by PCR with the conditions mentioned before (Section 2.4.2). The PCR products from reamplification were sent to purification and sequencing to Molecular Cloning Laboratories (MCLAB, San Francisco, California, USA). Sequence data were analyzed with Bioedit v 7.0.9 software (Ibis Bioscience, Carlsbad CA, USA) and submitted to the non-redundant nucleotide data base at GenBank using the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) and Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp) for bacterial identification."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Biohydrogen production in the 120 cm3 vials,"3.1 Biohydrogen production in the 120 cm3 vials Batch fermentations carried out in 120 cm3 serum vials were conducted for biohydrogen production. After 44 h of fermentation, there was a clear difference in biohydrogen production experiments using the two media (Table 2 ). One considerable difference in the experiments was the lactose consumption rate with each medium; lactose was not detected at the end of the experiments with medium B, while in contrast only 63.7% of initial lactose was consumed using medium A. This significant difference is reflected in the higher maximum hydrogen production achieved (H max: 170.7 cm3) using the medium B, which yielded around twice the volume produced with medium A (73.1 cm3). Also the production rate (R max) was enhanced with the use of medium B (Table 2). Due to the lost in buffer capacity for medium A from the reaction with acids (Eq. (3)), there was a difference of one unit in the final pH of the medium, being higher with the use of medium B. Consequently, due to the highest hydrogen production with medium B, total VFA concentration was 7.427 g dm−3, while the use of medium A resulted in a total VFA concentration of 3.468 g dm−3. Ethanol was the only solvent detected at around 2.4 g dm−3 with the use of medium B, and near half the concentration with medium A. In terms of the profile of VFA, these results are similar to those obtained by Yang et al. [18]. Using a carbonate-based buffer, mixed microflora and CWP as substrate the authors found mainly acetic and butyric acids with propionic acid present at low substrate-to-microorganism ratio. Moreover, the presence of residual lactose was detected in their experiments with uncontrolled pH that fell from 7.33 to as low as 4.48. One difference is that the authors found a maximum VHPR of near 400 cm3 dm−3 h−1 while in this work we report a maximum of 94.5 cm3 dm−3 h−1. To our knowledge, there is only one report regarding non-continuous lactose or CW fermentation for biohydrogen production using mixed cultures and phosphate-based medium [7]. The authors used pure lactose, as well as xylose, at thermophilic conditions at 55 °C in both controlled and uncontrolled pH experiments in fed-batch operation for each substrate. For lactose, they found the best results on pH controlled at 5.3 with HMY reaching 3.45 mol mol−1 and VHPR was 57 cm3 dm−3 h−1. In their uncontrolled pH experiments, VHPR were below 9 cm3 dm−3 h−1 and lactose consumption was 62% with an average HMY of 1.5 mol mol−1; the pH dropped from an initial value of 6.0 to 4.2. In all cases the initial lactose concentration was 2 g dm−3. The lactose consumption and HMY obtained by the authors are similar to the reported here for uncontrolled pH experiments with carbonate-based medium in which pH fell from 7.5 to 4.8. However, the VHPR we report for the mesophilic experiments are at least 10 times higher than the best result reported by Calli et al. [7] in thermophilic controlled pH experiments. One reason for this is due to both higher initial substrate concentration (25 g dm−3) and initial pH of 7.5 used in this work, since previous findings showed that both factors had a significant effect on hydrogen production from either pure lactose or CWP [17]."
8,Biohydrogen production in the bioreactor experiments,"3.2 Biohydrogen production in the bioreactor experiments To further explore the behavior of pH, and follow the substrate consumption, metabolites production and hydrogen generation, single scale-up experiments were performed for each medium in a fermenter with a working volume of 2.4 dm3. As noticed in Fig. 1 total hydrogen production was 4.863 dm3 with medium B while 3 dm3 of H2 were produced using the medium A. The VHPR was also increased with the use of medium B (Table 2). The increment in the working volume from vials to fermenter by a factor of 30, was reflected in the increase of H max being the increment factor of 41 for the medium A and 28.5 for the medium B. However, the VHPR was nearly doubled from the vials to the fermenter for both media (Table 2). Considering the lactose content (770 g kg−1) in the CWP, it was expected to detect 19.25 g lactose dm−3 as initial concentration in the batch experiments, however a maximum initial lactose concentration of around 16.5 g dm−3 was measured (Fig. 2 a). A possible reason for this could be the adsorption of lactose to anaerobic biomass and/or to protein present in CWP, and since the methodology includes the precipitation of the solids, only dissolved lactose could be detected. Therefore, all calculations were performed using dissolved lactose found in the media. Fig. 2a shows that using medium A, lactose was not completely consumed by the microorganisms, and a residual concentration of around 6 g dm−3 was observed. Whereas, with the use of medium B (Fig. 2b), lactose was rapidly metabolized and was not detected in the culture medium after 18 h of fermentation. This difference could be explained due to the different rates at which pH dropped for each medium (Fig. 1), but also due to the concentration of undissociated acids at certain fermentation times, because some VFA, such as acetic, butyric and propionic acids, are toxic to cells or inhibitory for the hydrogen production metabolism [30,31]. Both features (low pH and concentration of undissociated VFA) are connected because for a lower pH there is a higher amount of undisocciated acid form according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation [30]. Therefore, for medium A the consumption of only 1.1 g lactose from fermentation time 17.3 h–19.3 h, where consumption stopped, could be related to the concentration of undissociated acids such as butyric acid between those fermentation times. At time 17.3 h (Fig. 2a) the undissociated concentration of butyric acid (pH 5.16) was 583 mg dm−3 (6.6 mmol dm−3) and had a slight decrease at time 19.3 h. In the case of medium B, the concentration of butyric acid at time 15 h was only 21 mg dm−3 (0.24 mmol dm−3) at pH 5.88, this concentration is far below the reported threshold for butyrate toxicity to cells (2–30 mmol dm−3). It suggests that the low butyric acid concentration in time 15 h allowed the bacterial cells to further metabolize the residual 6 g lactose dm−3 in 3 h, because from time 18 h lactose was not detected (Fig. 2b). This was reflected in a higher maximum lactose consumption (S max) for medium B of 17.3 g dm−3 calculated by the fitting of Eq. (5), although the real figure was 16.3 g dm−3 as shown as initial lactose concentration in Fig. 2b. The low butyrate concentration with the use of medium B during the first 15 h of fermentation could be the reason of a higher lactose consumption rate (R max,S; Table 2) that was near three times the calculated for the experiment with medium A. Besides butyric acid concentration, the faster drop in pH for medium A could have a negative effect in cells and also inhibit hydrogen production metabolism. Fig. 1 shows that the beginning of exponential hydrogen production with medium A occurs at time 12.3 h, and the pH had already dropped to 5.45, while for the same fermentation time the pH for medium B was 6.75. It is reported that the optimum pH for fermentative hydrogen production for different substrates is from 5.5–6 [19,25], but hydrogen production has also been reported for higher pH [12,32]. However, pH below 5.0 has not been reported as optimum because it is around the pH where the switch from acidogenesis to alcohol production triggers [33]. Thus, the lower pH at the beginning of the exponential phase using medium A, could also explain the lower biohydrogen production compared to medium B, because for the latter there was a bigger period of time before reaching a harsh low pH. Moreover, for medium B, pH fell to 5.4 which still is near the optimum reported range for hydrogen production, while for medium A the pH fell to below 5. It is hypothesized that these different rates of pH drop could also have an effect over the microbial communities that better adapt for each pH change."
9,Microbial community analyses,"3.3 Microbial community analyses The effect of the A and B culture media on the microbial communities was studied through the PCR-DGGE technique in the 120 cm3 vials. Fig. 3 shows that one clear band (1) was present in the experiment with medium A, while three bands (2, 3 and 4) were observed when medium B was used in batch fermentations. It is important to remark that the results from these duplicated analyses are shown in Fig. 3. For the experiment with medium A the DGGE band profile was exactly the same, while for experiment with medium B only one band (3) was predominant in the duplicate (Fig. 3). The band detected in the experiments with medium A, had a closest relative match to Citrobacter freundii JCM (100% identity, accession number AB548824.1); while for medium B, three bands were observed (Table 3 ). Sequences from these bands presented high homology to sequences from Clostridium perfringens W11 (95% identity, accession number JF499889.1), uncultured Lachnospiraceae bacterium clone MS146A1 E12 (100% identity, accession number EF706759) and Enterobacter cloacae GH1 (100% identity, accession number JF261136.1) (Table 3). Although species of Clostridium, Enterobacter and Citrobacter genera are known as efficient hydrogen-producing microorganisms [34–45], the results presented here suggest that, under the culture conditions assessed, the selection of both Clostridium and Enterobacter genera might be related to best results obtained with medium B. These findings are supported by reports in which bacterial populations from a mixed culture were pH- and substrate-dependent [46,47]. Lin and Hung performed batch cultivations using cow dung sludge as inoculum and found Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Clostridium and Streptococcus species at different initial pH (5.5–9) with xylose and cellulose as substrates [46]. While Xiao et al., showed that even with the same inocula, the use of different substrates and also the change in pH during hydrogen production in batch tests would lead to the development of different microorganisms under a transient biohydrogen production pH environment, with glucose and protein as substrates [47]."
10,Conclusions,"From the results showed in this work it is clear that the utilization of two different mineral media formulation, with CWP as substrate, had a strong effect on biohydrogen production. Differences were observed regarding the microorganisms present in each culture condition, consequently, deviations from metabolic hydrogen-production pathways occurred. Moreover, the kinetics had also an effect on the microbial community developed with two media and therefore these could be the reasons of higher hydrogen production with the use of medium B. These findings are significant because the improvement of the hydrogen production is critical for the scaling-up of bioenergy production processes."
