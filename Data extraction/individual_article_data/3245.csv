0,Introduction,"Considering the worldwide challenges regarding climate change, pollution, and the ever growing global energy consumption as a result from the current use of non-renewable fossil fuels, more sustainable alternatives are required that shift us towards more renewable feedstocks that are environmentally friendly and carbon neutral. Presently, reports indicate that renewables comprise only around 5% of the total world energy consumption, falling considerably behind the combined contribution of oil, coal, and natural gas of 85%. Lignocellulosic biomass has progressively been considered a promising renewable substitute for the production of bio-based fuels and chemicals with tremendous potential due to its abundancy, relatively low cost, and does not compete with food resources [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass is composed of 3 main components; cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Since cellulose, a polysaccharide of C6 hexose sugars, comprises approximately half of all lignocellulosic biomass, its conversion to valuable chemicals and fuels has been of vital significance [2]. Specifically, the formation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucose has received particular attention for its immense versatility in forming a vast range of platform chemicals for bio-polymer and biofuel production, even being referred to as a sleeping giant in the field of renewables [3-5]. HMF contains three desirable functional constituents (an alcohol, a carbonyl group in the form of an aldehyde, and furan ring) which permits flexible access to several industrially relevant compounds. Of particular interest are dimethylfuran (DMF), and the diols 2,5-bishydroxymethalfuran (BHMF), and 2,5-bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTF). DMF has been recognized as a biofuel more suitable than bioethanol with a higher energy density, high research octane number, and lower water solubility allowing it to be more easily blended into gasoline [6-8]. BHMF and BHMTF are highly desirable for applications in the polymer industry in the manufacturing of polyesters and heat insulating polymers, which are currently made exclusively from petroleum-based feedstocks [9,10]. Catalytic hydrotreatment with hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been accepted as one of the most promising conversion routes to obtain these value-added chemicals as it takes advantage of the decades of extensive research that has been employed in conventional petroleum hydrotreating involving hydrodesulfurization which it is closely linked [11]. Generally, HDO occurs at moderate temperatures (100–250 °C) and high hydrogen pressures (3–10 MPa) in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst where oxygen is typically expelled in the form of H2O [12]. Nickel has been identified as an ideal transition metal that elicits adequate hydrogenation activity [13-15]. Additionally, its low cost and availability makes it highly attractive in comparison to noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ru, although hydrogenation activity and stability are typically substandard in comparison [16]. To increase activity and stability of transition metal catalysts, additional metals (promoters) are added to the catalyst to contribute additional functionality and enhance performance. The addition of a second, promoter metal to nickel catalysts has been widely demonstrated to greatly enhance catalytic activity and augment product selectivity. This study investigates the impact of lanthanum and niobium on the hydrogenation activity of nickel-based catalysts for HDO of HMF. Both lanthanum and niobium have demonstrated great potential as effective Ni promoters for hydrogenation reactions by improving particle dispersion and reducibility, though by opposing behaviors [16-19]. Lanthanum has been commonly employed as a nickel promoter, which has been described to increase reducibility by forming a layer around the support (‘under’ nickel) that weakens metal-support interactions, thus enhancing metallic dispersion and thermal stability [19-22]. Niobium incorporated into nickel-containing catalysts has been shown to also enhance metal dispersion, instead by partially encompassing NiO particles (‘over’ nickel), preventing particle growth and agglomeration which can occur during high temperature pretreatments [23-25]. Activated carbon was selected as support material as it provides a high surface area for maximum metal dispersion, and its relative inert surface evades high rates of undesirable side reactions compared to other supports such as alumina and silica [26 27]. The same intrinsic flexible nature of HMF also creates major challenges when attempting to control the selectivity of catalytic reactions and often results in a complex mixture of products [28]. Alongside hydrodeoxygenation, several alternative side reactions can also arise such as decarbonylation, (hydro)cracking, and saturation of the furan ring depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst used, causing difficulties in accurately determining reaction mechanisms [29]. Several publications have been able to achieve high product selectivities of both DMF and BHMF. Kong et al. achieved 92% selectivity of DMF with comparable alumina-supported nickel catalysts in 1,4-dioxane as the solvent [14]. Yu et al. obtained 96% selectivity to BHMF when using Ni-Fe nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes in n-butanol [30]. Likewise, comparable studies for the selective catalytic hydrotreatment of furfural, an analogous furanic derived from pentoses, have also been reported with excellent selectivies [3132]. Although high selectivies have been reached, a comprehensive understanding of their reaction kinetics is essentially absent. Kinetic modelling can provide valuable insights for the in-depth understanding and describing of surface chemistry on a fundamental level, and subsequent improvements in the design of catalytic systems which is not possible through conventional methods. These microkinetic models, based on first-principles, consider several elementary steps within the experimental system including; gas solubility in the liquid phase, adsorption and desorption kinetics, and catalyst surface reactions. Kinetic studies on HMF are scarce in the literature and have primarily been restricted to the formation of HMF from sugars rather than its catalytic conversion to value-added products [33-35]. The rare kinetic study that does involve HMF conversion have been based on simple systems that provide limited knowledge [36,37]. Kinetic studies are of high importance and its further development is essential to better understand optimal operating conditions and catalyst compositions to reach maximum yields of a desired product. In this study, the microkinetics of HMF HDO in a batch system is reported at relevant temperatures (170–230 °C) for hydrogenation, and concentrations of all liquid intermediates and products as a function of time are included in the kinetic analysis. Based on experimental data and detectable compounds, a reaction pathway is proposed and a kinetic scheme was employed to model experimental conclusions. To our knowledge, a detailed microkinetic model of HDO of HMF is generally lacking in the literature, therefore this study aims to cultivate a microkinetic model with the capability to predict reaction rates with experimental data using promoted activated carbon-supported nickel-based catalysts. These promoters were selected as they have been shown to beneficially influence nickel metallic species and reducibility, and their irreducible nature (at least under the implemented experimental conditions in the case of niobium) is anticipated to not provide any additional metallic active phase themselves [38-40]."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All gases, chemical reactants, and calibration standards were purchased from various commercial suppliers and used as is without further purification; (5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (>97 wt%, Carbonsynth, reference number FH10853), 5-methylfurfural (99 wt%, Sigma Aldrich), dimethylfuran (99 wt%, Sigma Aldrich), 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (98 wt%, VWR), 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (>95 wt%, Carbosynth), (5-methyl-2-furyl)methanol (98 wt%, Carbosynth), hydrogen (5.0, Messer, Bad Soden am Taunas, Germany), nitrogen (5.0, Messer, Bad Soden am Taunas, Germany), NH3 (5 vol% in He, Linde, Pullach, Germany), helium (5.0 Messer, Bad Soden am Taunas, Germany), carbon monoxide (5 vol% CO in He, Linde, Pullach, Germany), and tetrahydrofuran (>95 wt%, EMD Millipore) used as solvent. Lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate (99 wt%, Honeywell Fluka) and nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (97 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, reference number 72253), niobium pentachloride (99 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were implemented in catalyst preparation using Vulcan XC-72R carbon powder (Cabot Corporations, Bilerica, MA, USA) as support. VXC-72R carbon powder has a bulk density between 20–380 kg/m3 and a density of 1.7–1.9 g/cm3."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Catalysts containing nickel and/or lanthanum were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and La(NO3)3·6H2O precursors dissolved in deionized water that was equal to the total pore volume of the activated carbon to obtain 5 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively (5Ni10La). Prior to impregnation, the activated carbon (VXC-72R) was crushed and sieved to obtain the 40–100 µm fraction to ease any internal mass-transfer limitations within the catalysts particle. Following impregnation, catalysts were dried at 110 °C overnight in an oven. NiLa catalyst was impregnated in 2 subsequent steps; firstly lanthanum was impregnated, dried, followed by nickel impregnation and drying. Niobium-doped catalysts were prepared by ammonium precipitation where activated carbon was vigorously mixed under reflux at 85 °C in absolute ethanol, ammonium solution, and specific amount of pentachloride to obtain the desired 10 wt% loading. After filtration and cleaning with deionized water, the catalysts were dried overnight at 110 °C and subsequently impregnated with nickel nitrate exactly as mentioned above. Incipient wetness impregnation was chosen for lanthanum promotion as this has been reported to be ideal in forming a thorough layer on the catalyst surface, as opposed to ammonium precipitation used for niobium promotion which is more suitable to form fine and uniform particles [41 42]. These preparation methods were expected to best achieve the ‘under’ ‘over’ benefits to nickel dispersion and reducibility previously mentioned."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization 2.3.1 Surface and textural properties Surface and textural properties of the blank support and doped-activated carbon catalysts were analyzed with nitrogen physisorption; specifically, adsorption–desorption isotherms to determine specific surface area (S BET), average pore diameter (d p), and pore volume (V P) using an ASAP 2020 gas adsorption instrument (Micrometrics, Norcross, GA, USA). Catalyst composition was measured by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine actual metal loadings in addition to final reaction mixtures to identify if any metal leaching was present. Morphological properties of catalysts particles were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (SUPRA 35 VP, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis was conducted at 200 kV using a thermionic electron-source TEM JEOL model 2100. Particle size distribution is presented as equivalent diameters for at least 100 individual particles, such that the diameter of a circle having equal surface area as the imaged particle. The empirical number-weighted distribution functions were fitted with a normal distribution function. The average size (d NTEM) with standard deviation (σ NTEM) are the arithmetic moments normal distribution function. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were characterized using PW3040/60 X’Pert PRO MPD diffractometer at 35 kV and 45 mA with Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm) in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°, and using JCPDS database for reference. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis were performed on a PHI-TFA XPS spectrometer manufactured by Physical Electronics Inc. coupled with a Mg X-ray source. The analyzed area was 0.4 mm in diameter. The high-energy resolution spectra were acquired with energy analyzer operating at resolution of 0.6 eV and pass energy of 29 eV. The accuracy of binding energies was about ± 0.3 eV. Catalysts were reduced under hydrogen atmosphere with the same conditions as applied prior to activity tests. 2.3.2 Hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed with a Micrometrics AutoChem II Chemisorption Analyser (Micrometrics, Norcross, GA, USA). Initially, 100 mg of catalyst was introduced into a quartz U-tube and pretreated under 50 mL min−1 of argon at 300 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 30 K min−1 before reduction. Immediately following, the sample was subjected with 40 mL min−1 of a 5 vol% H2 in Ar mixture at a constant heating rate of 10 K min−1 up to a maximum of 900 °C. Hydrogen consumption was determined using a TCD detector and a calibration using CuO. 2.3.3 Ammonia / carbon monoxide-temperature programmed desorption Ammonia and carbon monoxide temperature programmed desorption (NH3 − TPD / CO − TPD) analysis were performed with a Micrometrics AutoChem II Chemisorption Analyser (Micrometrics, Norcross, GA, USA). Prior to TPD, 100 mg catalyst samples were initially pretreated under the same reduction conditions used for experiments (400 °C for 3 h). Samples were subjected to 40 mL min−1 of ammonia or carbon monoxide mixtures (10 vol% NH3 or 5 vol% CO in He) at 60 °C before being purged with He and heated-up to 600 °C with a constant heating rate of 10 K min−1. Desorbed compounds were detected using a TCD detector and preferred mass spectrums were identified with a GSD 301 T3 Thermostar Mass Spectrometer. Metallic and acid sites were calculated based on known response of calibration gas mixtures. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) experiments were attempted with a DiffusIR cell (PIKE Technologies) attached to Perkin Elmer Frontier spectrometer using pyridine as the probe molecule. 10 mg samples of catalyst was initially pre-treated for 20 min in a 100 mL min−1 flow of N2 at 350 °C, left to cool for 25 min, than saturated with pyridine vapour in a 50 mL min−1 flow of N2 gas stream for 10 min and subsequently evacuated for 10 min at 10-5 mbar (Pfeiffer Vacuum turbomolecular pump, model HiCube). The spectra collected are the average of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and over 1000–4000 cm−1 wave number range."
5,Catalytic activity tests,"2.4 Catalytic activity tests Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reactions were conducted in 75 mL multi-reactor stainless steel batch reactor system (Parr 5000 Series). Activity tests were performed with 0.1 g of catalyst (weight of pre-reduced catalyst), 40 mL of THF, and 1 g of HMF. Prior to catalytic tests, catalysts were reduced at 400 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 and a pure hydrogen flow of 40 mL min−1. Reactor temperatures ranging from 170 to 230 °C with a heating rate of 5 K min−1 were implemented and reactions lasted 6 h once the desired reaction temperature was reached. Mixing was induced by magnetic stir bars with a maximum stirring speed of 1200 min−1 to ensure negligible external mass transfer effect between gas–liquid-solid phases. Following purging three times with nitrogen and hydrogen to ensure no residual air was left in the system, the reactor was pressurized with 5.0 MPa of H2 to ensure the amount of hydrogen was well in excess with an approximate H2:O ratio of 20:1. Liquid samples were collected once the desired reaction temperature was achieved and then at every hour following during isothermal conditions from the same experiment. Immediately following activity tests, the reactors were quenched in water until a final temperature of 40 °C was reached and final liquid mixtures were collected. After the initial activity test, the spent catalysts were subjected to recyclability tests. Following the first reaction, catalysts were separated from the liquid phase by centrifugation, washed with THF twice, dried in nitrogen, and then pretreated in hydrogen under the same conditions as prior (400 °C for 3 h, 40 mL min−1) before the next activity tests. After three recycled tests (R1-R3), the catalysts were washed once again in THF, then calcined in air at 400 °C for 2 h just before the final reduction pretreatment in the attempt to regenerate the recycled catalyst (R4)."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis Liquid samples were filtered with 45 µm PET filters and then quantitatively evaluated off-line by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) (2010 Ultra, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Compounds were separated by Zebron ZB-5MS capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) and identified with a mass spectrometer. GC analysis parameters were set with a starting oven temperature of 60 °C and subsequent heat-up to match the injector temperature of 290 °C. Calibration was determined for each product with commercially purchased external standards. The catalytic activity test with 5Ni catalyst at 230 °C was performed in triplicate to validate the reproducibility of catalytic activity tests. Mean concentrations of the triplicates are shown in Fig. S1 and standard deviations of the mean are shown as error bars. The average standard deviation of the mean for all products was 0.003. Further analysis of the gas phase, spent catalyst, and humin formation in liquid phase was conducted to investigate where the loss in carbon balance occurred. Gas products were analyzed offline with a Micro-GC (490 Micro GC System, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) by the separation on PoraPLOT U (PPU) and MolSieve 5A (MS5A) columns and quantification by TCD detector. The gas phase from all tests detected negligible CO or CO2 production (<1%). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted to evaluate the coking of the catalyst using RuboTherm TG with dynamic GDS on ~ 10 mg sample of spent catalysts in both air and nitrogen environments up to 700 °C. Finally, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed (Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000, ThermoFischer, Waltham, MA, USA) with UV detector and polystyrene standards, following a similar procedure reported elsewhere [43], to follow the eventual formation of oligomers."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Surface and textural properties N2 physisorption results are reported in Table 1 . N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. S7, in which the blank carbon support and all promoted catalysts displayed similar isotherm characteristics. Due to the fact that VXC-72R activated carbon contains large quantities of micropores (<2 nm), calculated surface areas, average pore size and pore volumes of catalysts should be considered apprehensively. Nevertheless, it would appear that the initial impregnation of lanthanum blocks a large portion of pores as surface area (S BET and t-plot areas) and pore volume are significantly lower in comparison to the bare AC support and 5Ni catalyst. Nickel catalysts doped with niobium were observed to have almost identical surface area and pore volume. These variations in textural properties between catalysts is to be expected as a result from the different catalyst preparation methods conducted. As mentioned previously, incipient wetness impregnation of lanthanum was implemented to form a thorough layer on the catalyst surface, thus leading to the loss in specific surface area, increase in the average pore diameter, and decrease in pore volume via blocking of smaller pores. Alternatively, the minimal difference in specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter observed between the Ni and NiNb catalysts is due to the more fine niobium particles that have been reported to form by ammonium precipitation [41 42] . SEM images of reduced and spent catalysts are presented in Fig. 1 . By external observation of the SEM images, it appears that all three catalysts used in this study are analogous and demonstrate homogenous dispersion across the support after reduction at 400 °C. No major alterations were perceived in catalyst structure or dispersion after reduction or in spent catalysts following activity tests, suggesting that particle coarsening and/or coking was minimal under the conditions implemented in this study. TEM was performed to observe surface and textural properties in more detail compared to SEM, and images are displayed in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2a and 2b of reduced catalysts demonstrate that the high dispersion of metal particles appears to be relatively retained during the reduction process at elevated temperatures with minimal particle growth or agglomeration into larger particles. The bimetallic catalysts NiLa and NiNb were determined to have a significantly smaller average particle size with a dNTEM of 8 nm and 7 nm respectively, compared to 11 nm of the Ni catalyst, indicating that nickel particle dispersion was likely improved from the promotion of La and Nb as originally hypothesized. Fig. 2c captured individual nickel particles on the Ni catalyst surface approximately 5–8 nm in size. The spent 5Ni catalyst shown in Fig. 2d suggests that individual nickel particles preserve their distinctiveness following reduction and catalytic testing, in alignment with the nearly equal average particle size observed (dNTEM of 10 nm) relative to reduced Ni catalyst prior to activity tests (dNTEM of 11 nm). XRD profiles for fresh and reduced carbon-supported catalysts are displayed in Fig. S3 (Supplementary Material). The broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 25° detected for all catalysts has been associated with (002) plane of amorphous coke-like structures that are present as disordered, carbonaceous layers in the carbon support [44 45]. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 44° corresponds to (100) plane, owing to crystalline carbon within the support [46 47]. Due to the nature of the carbon, which generated wide and intense diffraction peaks, especially after reduction, it is not possible to precisely identify the presence of explicit metallic phases or the formation of mixed oxides of Ni with La or Nb species. XPS analyses were performed on three samples. Elements C, O, Ni, Nb and La were detected on the surface of these samples. High energy resolution Ni 2p, Nb 3d and La 3d spectra were acquired and are shown in Fig. 3 in Supplementary Material. The Ni 2p spectra from samples 5Ni and 5Ni10Nb are similar (Fig. 3a and 3b). The Ni 2p3/2 peaks consist of three components. The peak at 852.7 eV is assigned to metallic Ni(0) and the peak at 855.8 eV is assigned to Ni(3 + ) in Ni2O3-like compound [48]. There is also a Ni-satellite peak at 861.4 eV related with Ni(3 + ). Unfortunately, Ni 2p spectrum from 5Ni10La sample is overlapping with La 3d spectra (Fig. 3d) and it cannot be used for identification of oxidation state of Ni in this sample [49]. In sample 5Ni10Nb, the XPS spectrum Nb 3d (Fig. 3c) has a main peak Nb 3d5/2 at 207.7 eV and it is assigned to Nb2O5-like environment [48]. No metallic Nb at 202 eV was detected in this spectrum at 202 eV. In sample 5Ni10La the XPS spectrum La 3d5/2 (Fig. 3d) has a double structure, where La 3d5/2 peaks are at 834.7 and 838.3 eV [49]. This double structure is assigned to La-oxide. No metallic La was identified in this spectrum. 3.1.2 Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction H2-TPR is an important method that can identify the optimal reduction temperature that activates a maximum amount of metal while restricting the amount of sintering that can occur at elevated temperatures [50]. H2-TPR profiles for bare AC support, La and Nb-doped activated carbon without Ni, and nickel and lanthanum oxides are presented in Fig. 4 for comparative purposes. An initial reduction test was conducted on the bare activated carbon support indicating negligible reducibility. A slight negative shoulder is observed at higher temperatures beginning at 600 °C. This is attributed to CO desorption from thermal decomposition of the oxidized carbon surface as oxygen chemisorbed onto carbon is frequently reported [51]. Literature commonly reports the irreducible nature of lanthanum oxides (La2O3) which can be clearly observed in Fig. 4 with no detectable H2 uptake [38]. Therefore, the peak detected for La-doped AC at ~ 500 °C has been described to correspond to the decomposition of readily formed lanthanum oxycarbonates (La2O2CO3) or hydroxycarbonates (LaOHCO3), not corresponding to any reduction capability [52-54]. This was further confirmed by performing H2-TPR-MS on the La-doped AC catalyst which detected the presence of CO (m/z = 28) and CO2 (m/z = 44) (Fig. S6). H2-TPR profile of Nb-doped catalyst indicated, although rather minor, two reduction peaks at ~ 585 °C and ~ 860 °C. The first peak is associated with the reduction of superficial NbOx species [55,56]. The second peak at 860 °C is attributed to the partial reduction (Nb+5 → Nb+4) of bulk Nb2O5 phase to NbO2. [57–59] . The complete reduction to NbO (Nb+4 → Nb+2) is reported in the literature to occur at much higher temperatures (~1300 °C) which was not possible to achieve under these implemented TPR parameters [39,40]. Finally, pure NiO was also subjected to reduction for comparative purposes and a major peak was observed between 240 °C and 400 °C, attributing to the complete reduction of NiO (Ni+2 directly to Ni0) [59]. Based on these results, 400 °C was selected as an optimal reduction temperature for catalytic activity tests as it would reduce the vast majority of NiO species in all Ni-containing catalysts. Broad H2-TPR profiles for catalysts containing Ni were then deconvoluted into symmetrical peaks to further investigate the individual NiO species and provide more detailed information on catalysts reducibility. Deconvolution was carried out via Origin software using Lorentzian multi-peak curve fitting and are presented in Fig. 5 . Quantitative results for overall hydrogen consumption as well as each deconvoluted peak are shown in Table 2 . The deconvoluted H2-TPR profile for 5Ni (Fig. 5a) indicate the presence of several overlapping elemental reduction progressions between 150 °C and 800 °C due to altering strengths of interaction with surface functional groups on the activated carbon support [60]. The first 3 bands can be associated as follows; peak I at 218 °C is related to well dispersed NiO species that are interacting weakly with the AC support and are the most readily reduced, peak II at 281 °C is also associated with moderately dispersed nickel, and peak III at 357 °C is associated with bulk NiO that is more strongly interacting with the support [61-63]. The harder to reduce peak IV at 478 °C and peak V at 681 °C are not present in the TPR of pure NiO and are likely intensely interacting with functional groups on the surface of the support. This correlates well with the H2-TPR profile of the bare AC (Fig. 4) as oxygen-containing functional groups such as phenolics, quinones, and carbonyls are not thermally stable above 600 °C [64]. Furthermore, these functional groups may affect the distribution or occurrence of neighbouring oxygen surface vacancies to NiO when in tight contact with the carbon support, which is presumed to be the initiating factor for NiO reduction [59,65]. Fig. 5b of 5Ni10La deconvoluted H2-TPR profile resulted in a significant shift in reduction to lower temperatures with a major peak at 315 °C. Relative to 5Ni, it appears that NiO dispersion was substantially improved and more uniformly distributed as the reduction peak(s) corresponding to dispersed NiO is much more pronounced and bulk NiO appears to be almost non-existent. Total hydrogen consumption remained relatively equal with 0.230 mmol g−1 for 5Ni and 0.227 mmol g−1 when lanthanum was initially impregnated, however the percentage below 400 °C varied greatly with 41% and 66%, respectively. This aligns well with literature that reports the capability of lanthanum to lessen the interaction between metal-support by forming a layer on the surface of the support, and possibly forming La-Ni oxides [19,21]. The drop in surface area and pore volume observed during N2 adsorption in Table 1 also confirms this probable covering of the support by lanthanum. Furthermore, lanthanum addition also has been described to improve the stability of nickel by preventing sintering/agglomeration into larger, less dispersed Ni particles at elevated temperatures during reduction [20,66]. Alternatively, niobium addition compressed the reducibility of nickel which positioned sharply around 360 °C as shown in Fig. 5c. H2-TPR analysis indicates that niobium diminished the amount of well dispersed NiO (peaks I and II) relative to the amount of bulk NiO species with a stronger interaction with the support. Interestingly, contrary to the influence of lanthanum, niobium significantly decreased the overall H2 consumption from 0.230 mmol g−1 to 0.153 mmol g−1, although most of this loss in H2 consumption corresponds to nickel species strongly interacting with the support (>400 °C). This suggests niobium likely deteriorates the strong interaction between nickel and the support by forming a layer over the activated carbon. Some studies have reported Nb to embed itself into and weaken the Ni-O-Ni lattice bonds resulting in a lower NiO reduction temperature, but this was not observed in this case [23,67]. It is possible that the higher portion of bulk NiO and diminished H2 consumption transpires due to niobium oxides partially encompassing NiO particles which has been mentioned elsewhere, hindering their reducibility [25]."
9,Acid and metal sites determined by NH3-TPD and CO-TPD,"3.2 Acid and metal sites determined by NH3-TPD and CO-TPD Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption coupled with a mass spectrometer (NH3-TPD-MS) was performed on catalysts to determine total acidity and relative strength of acid sites by quantification of desorbed ammonia. The mass spectroscopy signals displayed in Fig. 6 a are from m/z = 15 to isolate desorbed ammonia from water (both have mass spectrums of m/z = 17). Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) FTIR technique was attempted on the catalyst samples but no conclusive information could be obtained about the type of acid sites present due to the poor transmittance nature of the activated carbon support. An initial NH3-TPD test was conducted on bare AC support and its profile concluded negligible acidity contribution. All doped-catalysts indicated very low overall acidity corresponding to very weak acid site strength, desorbing from as low as 75 °C up to 350 °C. The 13 µmol g−1 of acid sites determined for 5Ni catalyst is associated with the Lewis acidic nature typical of Ni2+ sites [68,69]. The NH3-TPD profile for lanthanum-containing catalysts also indicated the presence of weak acid sites, likewise Lewis acid sites from La3+ oxidation state [70,71]. Compared to 5Ni, the NH3-TPD profile for 5Ni10Nb catalyst confirms more than five times the amount of acid sites with seemingly slightly stronger character relative to only Ni. Niobium can yield both Lewis acid sites, in the form of Nb = O bonds, and Brønsted acid sites in the form of Nb-OH groups, which would be expected to be more prevalent following reduction in a hydrogen environment [72,73]. Carbon monoxide – temperature programmed desorption coupled to a mass spectrometer (CO-TPD-MS) was conducted to determine CO chemisorption and quantified to estimate the concentration of metallic active sites on the catalyst surface, shown in Table 3 , and mass spectrum signals associated with CO (m/z = 28 with deduction from CO2 contribution) are displayed in Fig. 6b. Mass spectrums corresponding to CO2 (m/z = 44) are also shown in Fig. 6c. Although determined to be irreducible, 10La catalyst resulted in significant CO desorption starting around 450 °C owing to metallic active sites. With 5Ni10La catalyst, after deducting the contribution from lanthanum, resulted in approximately two times as many metal sites with 345 µmol g−1 relative to the 5Ni catalyst. This correlates well with the improved reducibility observed during H2-TPR and related studies that have reported increased nickel dispersion with lanthanum promotion [19-21]. Alternatively, the niobium-doped catalyst contributed very few metallic sites with only 19 µmol g−1, resulting in almost equal metallic sites between 5Ni and 5Ni10Nb catalysts, after deducing contribution from Nb, with 160 µmol g−1 and 180 µmol g−1, respectively. Carbon dioxide formation during CO-TPD with 5Ni10La catalyst was ~ 400% and ~ 800% higher in comparison to 5Ni and 5Ni10Nb catalysts, respectively, and thus its contribution had to be considered when determining total metallic sites. The production of CO2 during CO-TPD has been regularly described to occur via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism where CO reacts with the oxygen atoms within the lattice of the metal oxides present, leading to oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface [74,75]."
10,Reaction pathway network and microkinetic model development,"3.3 Reaction pathway network and microkinetic model development Before the model development, a detailed reaction pathway has been proposed as shown in Fig. 7 that is based on all detected intermediates and products during catalytic activity tests. The colours of each compound displayed in the reaction network match the colours presented later in Figs. 7-9 that display concentration profiles. Tetrahydro-5-methylfuran-2-methanol (MTHFA) in grey has been reported in other studies but was not detected under these experimental conditions. The model intends to describe a three phase system that considers a hydrogen solubility being in the thermodynamic equilibrium at the gas–liquid interface, competitive adsorption and desorption of all components on/from the catalyst surface, and their catalytic transformation on the catalyst surface. Modelled concentration and catalyst coverage values for each component were calculated by solving a set of ordinary differential equations based on the proposed reaction pathway stated above, with regard to the following assumptions; 1) Based on experiments performed with blank AC support (shown in Fig. 8f) resulting in negligible activity, it is assumed that all reactions are heterogeneous occurring on the catalyst surface, 2) Surface reactions are considered to exclusively transpire only on metallic sites. Experiments conducted with 10Nb and 10La on AC (shown in Fig. 9f and 10f) resulting in negligible activity justify the implementation of this assumption that reactions are undeniably dependent on metallic sites. Therefore adsorption, desorption, and surface coverages of both organic compounds and hydrogen were only considered to occur on metallic sites, 3) Vacant sites relevant for adsorption are all equivalent and independent of the overall coverage, 4) Each active (metal) site is covered by one organic or hydrogen molecule at a time as they absorb competitively, 5) Adsorption and desorption constants of all organic products are considered equivalent due to their similar structure, 6) Hydrogen solubility in THF was linearized from previously reported Henry constant values to fit the reaction conditions implemented in this study (170 – 230 °C and 5 MPa of H2) [76], 7) Since the initial large H2 pressure of 5 MPa, concentrations of other (initially liquid) products in the gas phase were considered to be negligible and their balances were not included in the set of ordinary differential equations in this work, 8) Humin formation was presumed to follow what has been reported in the literature and its concentration was estimated to equate to the concentration of the unaccounted carbon balance [77]. For simplicity in the model, humin formation was considered to be limited to dimers and not larger oligomers. Adsorption rate (r j ads) of each compound j depends on the adsorption rate constant (k ads), its concentration in liquid phase (Cj L), and concentration of vacant sites (θVS), defined in Eq. (1) (1) r j ads = k j ads C j L θ VS Desorption rate (r j des) of each compound j depends on the desorption rate constant (k des), and coverage of j adsorbed to active sites (θj), defined in Eq. (2). (2) r j d e s = k j d e s θ j Surface reaction rate (r i surf) of each reaction i depends on the surface reaction rate constant (k surf) and coverage of corresponding reactant j (θj) and hydrogen (for hydrogenation and HDO reactions) adsorbed to active sites, defined in Eq. (3). (3) r i surf = k i surf θ j θ H The kinetic model accounts for not only the isothermal segment of the process at final temperature but also the initial heating-up of reaction mixture to the desired reaction temperature. Temperatures and pressures recorded during every experiment were used for each time step to calculate mass transfer constants, reaction rate constants, and thermodynamic properties like equilibrium hydrogen solubility, while both adsorption and desorption rate constants were considered independent of temperature and orders of magnitude higher than the (rather low) reaction rate constants. The influence of temperature on rate constants for surface reactions was employed to follow Arrhenius law as presented in Eq. (4); (4) k i s u r f T 2 = k i s u r f T 1 × e x p Ea i R 1 T 1 - 1 T 2 Differential balance equations based on the proposed reaction network (Fig. 7) and Eq. 5–8 were implemented as follows; General balance for H2 concentration C H 2 G in the headspace volume of the reactor (VG), where k G L a dependence on the stirring speed in this type of reactor was adopted from our previous work [78]: (5) dC H 2 G dt = - k G L a p H 2 H - C H 2 L V L V G General balance for liquid phase, where n TS is the surface concentration of metal sites and V is the volume of the liquid phase: (6a) dC j L dt = - r j ads + r j des n TS V General balance for concentration of H2 in liquid phase: (6b) dC H 2 L dt = + k G L a p H 2 H - C H 2 L - r j a d s + r j d e s n T S V General balance for coverage of active sites: (7) d θ j dt = r j a d s V n T S + r j d e s + ∑ i I ± r i s u r f For all the reactions i-s (I is their number) that consume or form j. The vacant active site coverage was balanced with the consideration of Eq. (8). (8) d θ v s dt = ∑ j J r j a d s V n T S + ∑ j J r j d e s + ∑ i I ( ± r j s u r f ) For all compounds j-s (J is their number) that adsorb or desorb and for all reactions i-s (I is their number) that have unstoichiometric balance of sites. If the reactant-product molar ratio is always 1–1 or 2–2, then the last sum can be omitted. Concentration profiles were modelled by a set of ordinary differential equation (ODE) solved with Runge-Kutta (2,3), based on the Matlab solver used. Initial concentrations of all components were set at zero, excluding the starting reactant (HMF) in the liquid phase, hydrogen partial pressure in the gas phase (calculated by Henry law). To the best of our knowledge, the solubility of hydrogen in tetrahydrofuran has been measured only by Brunner [76] which was used in the calculation of Henry’s constant in Eq. (9) and application in Eq. (6b), where H denotes Henry’s constant defined via concentration, p H2 is the partial pressure of hydrogen in the gas phase and c H2 stands for the concentration of hydrogen in the solvent, hence reaction mixture. Brunner provided phase-equilibrium and the obtained Henry’s constant showed exponential dependence on temperature in the form of (9) H = 2544.132 × e - 0.007272 ∙ T The total concentration of active sites on the catalyst surface (θVS) were determined independently by CO-TPD chemisorption (see Table 3). (10) f k i - j , Ea i - j = ∑ ( C exp - C mod ( k i - j , Ea i - j ) ) 2 Nelder–Mead method was used for coarse regression of all experiments with the same catalyst type simultaneously by minimization of the objective function (Eq. (10)), whereas Levenberg–Marquardt method was used for fine regression analysis and to calculate Jacobian matrix and 95% confidence intervals. Turnover frequencies (TOF) for each catalyst were calculated using the general equation; (11) TOF = k i s u r f θ j θ H Where a constant maximum reaction temperature of 230 °C and equivalent initial concentrations of each reactant j were applied for best comparative purposes."
11,Catalytic activity tests and modelled results,"3.4 Catalytic activity tests and modelled results Liquid products analyzed by GC–MS for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural HDO over nickel-based activated carbon catalysts under our reaction conditions established the most foremost intermediates and products to be; 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), (5-methyl-2-furyl)methanol (2-HM-5-MF), dimethylfuran (DMF), dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), and 5-methylfurfural (MF). 5-methyltetrahydro-2-furanyl methanol (MTHFA) was not detected in this study but has been reported elsewhere using similar nickel-carbon catalysts [36,79]. Based on these detected products, a reaction pathway is presented in Fig. 7 in which the kinetic model relies on. Experimental (symbols) and modelled (lines) concentrations in the liquid phase as a function of time for reaction temperatures between 170 °C − 230 °C are shown in Figs. 8-10 and their corresponding kinetic parameters based on regression analysis are presented in Table 4. At lower temperatures < 200 °C, catalytic tests with 5Ni resulted in BHMF as the major product (57% and 54% at 170 °C and 185 °C, respectively), 2-HM-5-MF as the secondary product (13% and 21%, respectively) with trace amounts of DMF and BHMTHF. As the reaction temperature was increased to 200 °C, DMF production began to prevail at 215 min with a final product selectivity around 60% after the full reaction time. At reaction temperatures above 200 °C, DMF production dominated with 78% selectivity and nearly complete conversion after only 2 h from initial heating. According to rate constants shown in Table 4 , evidently for 5Ni catalyst, the highest rate constant is k 1 of 60.9 min−1, indicating that the first reaction involving the reduction of the aldehyde occurs relatively fast. Activity tests performed with blank AC (Fig. 8f), and Nb/La-doped support (Fig. 9f and 10f, respectively) that demonstrated trivial activity also demonstrate that k 1 is highly reliant on the presence of nickel metallic sites and cannot proceed without them. Nickel has been well-established as a suitable hydrogenation catalyst for the hydrogenation of carbonyl groups where the reduction of aldehydes to alcohol is relatively easy compared to other carbonyl groups such as ketones and esters [80-82]. This reaction can occur by either hydrogen attack to the O or C atom of the carbonyl group, though it has been suggested that the former is more preferred due to the stabilization the furan ring provides for the hydroxyalkyl intermediate [83,84]. Conversely, the primary dehydration of BHMF to yield 2-HM-5-MF (k 2) is approximately a third that of k 1 with 23.3 min−1 whereas the second and final dehydration to yield DMF (k 6) occurred relatively faster with 37.2 min−1. The related TOF values calculated at 230 °C was almost double for the second dehydration step relative to the first with 7.23 min−1 and 4.56 min−1, respectively. These reaction rate constants signify 2-HM-5-MF formation (k 2) to be the rate-limiting step in the major reaction pathway towards complete deoxygenated DMF. This is likely due to the low acidity of the 5Ni catalyst (as shown in Table 3) since hydrodeoxygenation reactions generally encompasses bifunctional metal–acid catalysts that provide dehydration function via acid sites whereas metal sites are involved in hydrogenation reactions. Strong acid sites alone could not catalyze this reaction, as shown in Fig. 10f with 10Nb, demonstrating the constraint for the synergistic effects of both metal and acid sites for effective hydrodeoxygenation. The alternative reaction pathway associated with the direct dehydration to yield 5-MF (k 3 and k 4) were significantly slower than the main reaction pathway with < 0.1 min−1 and 0.2 min−1, respectively. Due to the moderately high bond dissociation energies of the C–OH group to be around 280 kJ mol−1, it seems logical that the direct dehydration to 5-MF while keeping the aldehyde group intact would not readily occur [85 86]. The side reaction involving the formation of humins (k 8) was also quite slow with 1.4 min−1, although was not insignificant with a final product selectivity of 7% at 230 °C (Fig. 9e). Minimal furan ring saturation to produce BHMTHF (k 5) occurred and zero DMTHF (k 7) was detected at any reaction temperature. This is likely due to the mode at which the substrates bind to the catalyst where the carbonyl or hydroxyl group adsorb much more strongly, inhibiting any type of flat mode of adsorption with the π electrons of the furan ring [87]. A similar outcome was described in the hydrogenation of furfural where the furan ring was believed to employ a repulsion effect away from Cu atoms on SiO2 support [88]. The incorporation of La to the nickel catalyst altered the catalyst activity and product selectivity significantly. At reaction temperatures below 200 °C, k 1 involving the reduction of the aldehyde slowed extensively to 7.5 min−1 with BHMF being the key product with 42% and 73% product selectivity at 170 °C and 185 °C, respectively. Furthermore, complete HMF conversion was finally achieved only once the reaction temperature reached 215 °C (Fig. 9d). Dehydration reaction (k 2 and k 6) yielding 2-HM-MF and DMF, respectively, were both halted to a meagre 0.9 min−1 and remained the rate-limiting step in the main reaction pathway. Even when the reaction temperature was 230 °C, complete deoxygenation to DMF was extremely hindered reaching only 11% product selectivity, trivial to the 78% that was obtained with 5Ni experiments under the same conditions. Humin formation (k 8) was also determined to be negligible. This unexpected drop in activity appeared rather contrary to the improvement in reducibility and increase in available metallic sites that was observed during H2-TPR and CO-TPD when lanthanum was incorporated into the nickel catalyst. Additionally, activation energies corresponding to the main reaction pathway towards DMF (k 1, k 2, and k 6) were all determined to be considerably lower compared to 5Ni experiments. Similarly, TOF reduced substantially after lanthanum promotion from 12.94 min−1 to 1.75 min−1 for k 1 and from 7.23 min−1 to 0.20 min−1 for k 6. Literature has described the carbonyl group amongst HMF to adsorb via the oxygen atom to Ni metallic sites on the surface of the catalyst [89]. In the absence of lanthanum, the lone pair of electrons provided by the oxygen could be donated to the vacant d-orbital in Ni, enabling strong adsorption of the carbonyl group to the catalyst. Conversely, in the presence of a promoter such as lanthanum which is highly electron dense, Ni would become more electron rich and consequentially, perhaps switch adsorption favourability to hydrogen adsorption rather than the carbonyl group which has been described elsewhere [90,91]. This may explain the increase in reducibility but decrease in activity that was observed. Particle size effects have also been reported to influence adsorption configurations by altering the geometric properties of particles and corresponding active sites (higher content of edge and corner sites on smaller particles)[92]. As determined by particle size distribution diagrams in Fig. 2, nickel particles after the initial impregnation of lanthanum are likely smaller in size with a higher content of edge and corner sites, owing to the increase in metallic sites and reducibility that was previously mentioned. In terms of the lower reaction rates and TOF compared to the unpromoted Ni catalyst, Englisch et al. reported similar conclusions with hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde where larger Pt particles favoured the adsorption of the carbonyl group and yielded higher selectivity to alcohols [93]. This was also observed during hydrogenation of furfural where Pt particle sizes > 3 nm improved aldehyde reduction to form furfuryl alcohol with a 40-fold increase in TOR compared to smaller particles around 1.5 nm [94]. This influence has been associated with a greater partial positive charge (Niδ + ) on larger nickel particles which attracts the oxygen in the carbonyl (or alcohol) group more readily, allowing a more accessible adsorption configuration [95,96]. Additionally, as determined from N2 physisorption (Table 1), lanthanum promotion significantly decreased catalyst surface area and total pore volume approximately 3-fold compared to both 5Ni and 5Ni10Nb catalysts, suggesting a large number of pores were blocked. This could have allowed more Ni particles to be dispersed across the surface of the catalyst and the reason for the highest concentration of metallic sites and H2 consumption that was identified by CO-TPD and H2-TPR, respectively. Blocking of pores has also been reported in the literature to adversely impact catalyst activity in the same way that was observed with lanthanum promotion which resulted in considerably lower reaction rates and TOF for every reaction compared to the other tested catalysts [97-99]. Incorporation of niobium to the nickel catalyst demonstrated rather opposing results. Although k 1 was approximately half relative to 5Ni with 30.8 min−1, dehydration reactions k 2 and k 6 radically increased to 58.0 min−1 and 67.4 min−1, respectively, and consequentially made k 1 the rate-limiting step in the reaction. This was also reflected in the calculated TOF where k 2 increased significantly to 11.38 min−1 and k 6 to 13.92 min−1, the highest of the three tested catalyst. This significant decrease in k 1 does not correlate with the total concentration of Ni metallic sites which was determined by CO-TPD to be relatively equal between 5Ni and 5Ni10Nb catalysts with 160 µmol g−1 and 180 µmol g−1 , respectively. Although, if we consider H2-TPR results regarding the reducibility of the catalysts, it is clear that 5Ni10Nb catalyst has considerably lower total hydrogen consumption with 0.153 mmol g−1 compared to the 0.230 mmol g−1 which was observed for the 5Ni catalyst. This correlates very well with the difference in k 1 reaction rates between the two catalysts. Furthermore, average Ni particle size was determined to be around 7 nm with niobium promotion relative to 11 nm for the unpromoted 5Ni catalyst. This likely hindered carbonyl adsorption of HMF in a similar manner as observed with the 5Ni10La catalyst, owing to the lower k 1 and TOF relative to the 5Ni catalyst. At only 185 °C, DMF was the main product with 54% selectivity and steadily increased to 69% product selectivity at 230 °C. This is likely a consequence of the higher number of acid sites that the 5Ni10Nb catalyst provided (5 times higher relative to 5Ni and 5Ni10La) and their expected Brønsted nature. Several studies have reported the preferential role Brønsted acid sites have over Lewis acidity for the dehydration of glycerol and furfural alcohol due to the fact that Nb-OH bonds are highly polarized for easier cleavage of the C-O bond [72,73,100,101]. The alternative reaction pathway via 5-MF remained insignificant, however, humin formation (k 8) increased modestly to 3.8 min−1 with an activation energy of only 107 kJ mol−1, half that was observed with 5Ni. This correlates with reports specifically identifying the strong acidity associated with niobium to attribute to acid-catalyzed formation of humins and has even been observed to occur as low as 120 °C during dehydration of glucose [102–104]. Carbon balances considering only liquid phase products varied between catalysts; >85% for 5Ni, >96% for 5Ni10La, and as low as 75% for 5Ni10Nb. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted (RuboTherm TG with dynamic GDS) on ~ 10 mg sample of spent 5Ni10Nb catalyst (used at 230 °C) in both air and nitrogen environments up to 700 °C. Fresh activated carbon support was also tested under air in the attempt to distinguish the contribution from formed coke and support as shown in Fig. S2. As observed in Fig. S2, the blank carbon support decomposed completely by approximately 600 °C in an oxygen-containing environment. We observed a similar trend when the spent 5Ni10Nb catalyst was subjected to the same TGA conditions in which a sudden loss in mass occurred between 525 °C and 600 °C which we contributed to the degradation of the carbon support. We also performed TGA in a nitrogen atmosphere with the spent catalyst to indicate the mass loss associated with desorption of water and other liquid products that were strongly adsorbed to the surface of the catalyst. Therefore, we associated the mass loss that occurred between 300 °C and 500 °C to be attributed to soft coke deposits, although this is an approximation. This temperature range is in good agreement with other studies which have attributed this mass loss to correspond to soft coke deposits on the catalyst [100–103]. It is expected that this spent catalyst would contain the maximum amount of carbonaceous depositions out of all activity tests performed as coke is known to be more readily formed in the presence of acid sites and at higher temperatures [105]. By extrapolating these results to the total amount of catalyst originally introduced prior to activity tests, even with generous approximations, coke was determined to only contribute roughly 4% to the missing carbon balance. Finally, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed, where larger compounds above the molecular weight of HMF ranging between 200 Da up to 2000 Da were identified to be present in the liquid phase, shown in Fig. S4. Higher content was seen for tests conducted with niobium catalysts, although could not be quantified preciously. This confirms the presence of humins in the liquid phase and clarifies where the missing carbon balance equated from. Interestingly, ring saturation of DMF to yield DMTHF (k 7) began to emerge at 230 °C but was not detected for the other catalysts under the same reaction conditions, contrary to the diminished reducibility observed during H2-TPR (Table 2). This is possibly due to a combination of factors including reducing steric hindrance following removal of both alcohols, the presence of Brønsted acidity to allow adsorbance of the C = C bonds amongst the furan ring, and then finally the harsh reaction conditions to overcome the high energy barrier of 405 kJ mol−1 [106,107]."
12,Catalyst recyclability and stability,"3.5 Catalyst recyclability and stability Recyclability tests of the carbon-supported catalysts with associated conversions and product selectivities are presented in Fig. 11 where R1-4 represents the number of cycles. All carbon balances were determined to be > 91% for all recycle tests and elemental analysis of the liquid products indicated no major Ni leaching (below 0.5 wt% of starting Ni loading). Variations in catalyst activity and selectivity varied considerably between catalysts. 5Ni catalyst (left) demonstrated the smallest drop in conversion from 100% in the first test to 94% after the fourth recycle test. Product selectivity was significantly impacted, specifically impeding complete dehydration towards DMF where selectivity dropped from 60% in the initial activity test to only 3% after the final recycle test. Saturation of the furan ring to form BHMTHF was also undetectable following the first recycled test. Regeneration attempts via calcination had no favourable effect on restoring either activity or dehydration reactivity. Niobium and lanthanum promoted catalysts were much more significantly impacted during recyclability tests. 5Ni10Nb catalyst (middle) demonstrated a substantial decrease in conversion from 100% in the initial test to as low as 32% during the third recycle. Likewise to the 5Ni catalyst, dehydration reactions were also considerably hindered as DMF selectivity plunged from 66% to 1% from the first test to the third recycled test, respectively. Interestingly, calcination in air restored activity of the niobium-containing catalyst to 94% conversion in the fourth recycle test, in proximity to its former original test. This return of activity following regeneration strongly implies that soft coke deposits were responsible for the decline in activity which were also observed to be present during TGA analysis of spent 5Ni10Nb (Fig. S2). In terms of selectivity, the first dehydration reaction to 2-HM-5-MF was renewed to 23%, but similarly to 5Ni catalyst, complete dehydration to DMF was not renewed to its prior selectivity. 5Ni10La catalyst underwent the most severe deactivation during recycling tests with HMF conversion falling from 92% in the first activity test to 21% in the third recycle test. Dehydration reactions were relatively nonexistent after the first activity test. Contrary to the niobium-promoted catalyst, regeneration of the 5Ni10La catalyst via calcination in air resulted in negligible improvements in activity. Following the fourth recycle test, the 5Ni10La catalyst was washed in THF and calcined once again under the same conditions as prior to remove any potential coke deposits before being subjected to H2-TPR. The H2 – TPR profile demonstrates a major double peak between 550 °C and 800 °C which was not present in the initial H2-TPR profile prior to activity tests (Fig. S11). Literature has commonly shown this to be associated with perovskite-like structure of lanthanum nickelates (such as LaNiO3) which require reduction temperatures above 400 °C to achieve complete reduction to metallic Ni [108–110]. The repetitive reduction and subsequent calcination of the 5Ni10La catalyst at elevated temperatures likely formed increasing amounts of irreducible (at least under our conditions) mixed oxides of Ni and La, owing to its consistent deactivation throughout the recyclability tests, although this could not be precisely confirmed from XRD analysis. It is difficult to explain the reasoning behind the consistent drop in dehydration reactions during the cumulative recyclability tests. SEM images of recycled catalysts (Fig. S8) do not indicate any obvious morphological alterations to the surface of the catalysts. Additionally, the variation of average particle diameter obtained from TEM lies in close proximity to the standard deviation with negligible differences between reduced, spent, and recycled catalysts suggesting no substantial nickel particle agglomerations or coarsening occurred (Fig. S10). Active sites necessary for dehydration reactions are anticipated to be negatively influenced or blocked by types of coke that could not be removed with a calcination temperature of 400 °C as has been similarly reported in Ni-containing catalysts, however, this could not be distinguished from the carbon support during TGA analysis [111–113]."
13,Conclusion,"This work prepared promoted nickel-based catalysts supported on activated carbon and tested their catalytic activity towards hydrodeoxygenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to value-added products. Catalytic testing was conducted at 5 MPa of hydrogen over a range of reaction temperatures between 170 °C and 230 °C, offering a kinetic and mechanistic approach to HDO of HMF. Product distribution varied considerably between catalysts and was greatly influenced by reaction temperature. At reaction temperatures below 200 °C, 5Ni catalyst resulted in BHMF as the major product whereas deoxygenation products of 2-HM-5-MF and DMF formed at higher temperatures due to having to overcome higher activation energies. Lanthanum addition slowed all reaction rates and activity relative to non-promoted nickel, particularly dehydration reactions k 2 and k 6, thus significantly restricting product selectivity to mainly BHMF despite the enhancement to reducibility. Conversely, incorporation of niobium accelerated dehydration reactions, enabling DMF to form at lower temperatures and predominately higher selectivity relative to only nickel. A microkinetic model is presented based on the proposed reaction pathway that considers adsorption and desorption kinetics onto active metallic sites, mass transfer between gas–liquid phases, and thermodynamic influences. Modelled values fit experimental results adequately well, providing insights into complex reaction mechanisms and catalyst design for efficient hydrodeoxygenation of bio-based compounds. Future work will expand on this microkinetic model by considering the participation of more than one active site, in addition to extended mass-transfer and adsorption kinetic phenomena."
