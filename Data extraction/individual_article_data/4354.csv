0,Introduction,"Energy shortage and environmental deterioration expedite the search for green and renewable biofuels, such as bioethanol and biobutanol. However, bioalcohol recovery from fermentation broths, mainly based on distillation, account for 60–80% of the whole biofuel production consumption [1–3]. An effective and energy-saving purification technology is membrane-based organophilic pervaporation (OPV) because only the minor component in mixture consumes the major potential heat [4–6]. Integrated with the fermentation of biofuels, it can reduce the product inhibition and improve the fermentation efficiency. There is a pressing need for the robust PV membranes in long-term use with high selectivity and permeability [7]. Although the inorganic membranes usually have excellent durability, high selectivity and permeability [8], the polymer membranes still dominate due to their low cost and good workability. However, the polymer membranes generally suffer from a trade-off between permeability and selectivity known as Robeson's upper bound [9]. Vital design criteria of new membranes have emerged: (i) more thermally, chemically, and mechanically robust membranes; (ii) high selectivity and permeability for practical applications; and (iii) tunable interactions between membrane and target penetrants. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), combined the merits of polymer and inorganic phases, emerge at the right moment [10–12]. The polymer phase exhibits the superior workability for a defect-free active layer; meanwhile, the inorganic phase confers the high separation performance and requisite mechanical properties on the MMMs because it is selective and robust. The common fillers include polymer nanoparticles [13], carbon nanotubes [14], silicalites [15], and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [16–18]. However, one of the major challenges confronted by MMMs is the incompatibility between the fillers and polymer matrix. Moorea and Koros [19] summarized the non-ideal structures in MMMs including interfacial voids (gaps), rigidified polymer bulk, and pore blockage of inorganic fillers. Moreover, the high filler loading is prerequisite to achieve high selectivity and permeability [4,20]. But it also causes the mechanical failure readily due to the agglomeration of inorganic particles. As an emerging class of inorganic–organic porous materials, MOFs possess better compatibility with a polymer matrix since they have organic ligands [10]. Indeed, MOFs are attractive candidates as fillers for preparing the membranes with high performance [21,22]. Their versatile architecture and chemical flexibility provide the opportunities to tailor the interfacial interactions between the MOFs and polymer matrix, thereby decreasing the chances for mechanical failure. Furthermore, the high surface area, thermal stability, adsorption specificity, and tunable but rigid pore size of MOFs make the membranes overcome the inherent trade-off between permeability and selectivity. Until now, diverse MOFs, such as ZIF-8 [23,24], ZIF-67 [18], ZIF-90 [17], MAF-6 [25], and MIL-53 [26] have been incorporated into a polymeric matrix for fabricating the MMMs. Although the dispersed MOFs improve the membrane performance, we believe that the full benefit of MOF-incorporated MMMs is still limited unless a continuous MOF phase exists in a membrane, which would construct a continuous permeation highway for penetrants. As a representative of two-dimensional (2D) MOF, ZIF-L has a unique leaf-like morphology with the semi-SOD topology, high hydrophobicity, and same building blocks as ZIF-8 [27]. ZIF-L has an aperture of 3.4 Å in diameter perpendicular to the 2D crystal layer and a cushion-shaped cavity with dimensions of 9.4 Å × 7.0 Å × 5.3 Å, which allows the small molecules to transport across [28]. Coincidently, the kinetic diameters of bio-alcohols are in this range. Due to the high aspect ratio and anisotropic nature, ZIF-L can spontaneously form a brick-and-mortar architecture in the polymer matrix [21,29]. It is reasonably envisaged that the continuous permeation pathways for penetrants could be constructed if the ZIF-L nanosheets are connected to each other within polymer matrix. The embedding ZIF-L would regulate elaborately the molecular diffusion and hence optimize the membrane selectivity and permeability. The integration of ZIF-L with a polymer matrix to prepare the MMMs has been widely studied for gas separation [29], water treatment [30] and organic dehydration [21]. However, the studies of ZIF-L in the OPV field lag behind. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a hydrophobic and generic membrane material for OPV [5,31], was chosen as the polymer matrix. In this study, ZIF-L nanosheets were incorporated into PDMS matrix to fabricate the MMMs for alcohol recovery (ethanol, n-propanol, or n-butanol) from aqueous solution. Inspired by the seashell nacre [32], the brick-and-mortar arrangement of ZIF-L and excellent interfacial compatibility facilitated the efficient load transfer between the ZIF-L and PDMS matrix, thus resulting in the outstanding mechanical properties. The subtle interconnection of ZIF-L nanosheets constructed the relatively continuous permeation pathways for penetrants. The morphology, microstructure, thermal stability, mechanical and surface properties, and solvent uptake of the membranes were extensively investigated. The influence of ZIF-L loading on the membrane performance was examined in detail, along with the effects of feed composition and operating temperature. To elucidate the application potential, the long-term stability of the membrane was also explored."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.99% metals basis) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. 2-methylimidazole (Hmim, 98%), (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES, 99%) and dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL, 95%) were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Flat-sheet PVDF ultrafiltration membrane with an average pore size of 25 nm was purchased from North Membrane Technology Industry Co., Ltd. Hydroxyl-terminated PDMS with a viscosity of 5000 mPa s was provided by Beijing Chemical Works. Ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and n-heptane were supplied by Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Works. All reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. Deionized water was utilized throughout the experiments. Basic properties of the solvents and PDMS were listed in Table 1 , as shown below."
3,Synthesis of the ZIF-L nanosheets,"2.2 Synthesis of the ZIF-L nanosheets ZIF-L was fabricated as reported in literature [21,27]. The typical procedure was shown as follows (Scheme S1): 1.475 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.25 g of Hmim were dissolved in 100 mL water at 30 °C, separately. Under vigorous stirring, the zinc nitrate solution was rapidly poured into the Hmim solution. The mixture became milky instantly. After 4-h reaction, the product was collected by repeated centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min) and rinsed sequentially with water and ethanol to remove the residual reagents. Finally, the ZIF-L nanosheets were vacuum dried at 60 °C overnight. 80% yield of ZIF-L was obtained based on the zinc."
4,Membrane preparation,"2.3 Membrane preparation A certain amount of ZIF-L was dispersed into n-heptane (40.0 g) using a probe-type sonicator (SCIENTZ) in an ice bath for 1 h to break the crystal aggregates. Afterwards, the ZIF-L was “primed” by adding a portion amount of PDMS equal to 10 wt% of the total ZIF-L mass, and stirred for another 4 h. By the priming method, a thin polymer layer is supposed to coat on the MOF to enhance interaction and homogeneity between the MOF and polymer matrix [25,33,34]. The remaining PDMS was added into the ZIF-L suspension and kept on stirring overnight. The cross-linker (APTES) and catalyst (DBTDL) were then added into the above mixture with a constant mass ratio of 1:0.1:0.05:4 (PDMS: APTES: DBTDL: n-heptane). APTES acted not only as a cross-linker for PDMS chains but also as a binding agent anchoring PDMS to PVDF support [35]. After degassing, the resultant solution was cast onto the PVDF support by a home-made flat membrane casting apparatus using a 0.2 mm steel casting knife. The membranes were placed in air atmosphere for 10 min to evaporate the residual solvent and further cross-linked at 120 °C for 3 h. For simplicity, the as-prepared membranes were labeled as ZIF-L/PDMS-X, where X (X = 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50) represents the weight percentage of ZIF-L to PDMS (wt%). For comparison, the PDMS control membrane was prepared without embedding the ZIF-L nanosheets. The thin-film samples were fabricated by casting the relevant solutions in a Petri dish for characterization, solvent uptake and mechanical measurements. The active layer thickness of each membrane was determined by a scanning electron microscope."
5,Membrane characterization,"2.4 Membrane characterization The morphology of the ZIF-L and the membranes was observed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7500F). Membrane cross-sections were obtained by freeze-fracture after immersion in liquid nitrogen for several minutes. All samples were coated with gold by a high resolution sputter coater (JEOL JFC-1600) in a vacuum of 5 Pa to enhance the conductivity. Element distribution in the ZIF-L and the membranes was detected by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) coupled with SEM. The chemical structure of the ZIF-L and the membranes was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR, Thermo Nicolet IS10) with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The crystalline structure of the ZIF-L and membranes were determined by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD, Ultima IV) in the range of 5–45° at the speed of 5° min−1 (Cu-Kα, 40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 1.54056 Å). Simulated powder diffraction patterns of ZIF-L were attained by software Mercury 3.6 (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center). The structure of the ZIF-L and solvents were carried out by software Materials Studio (Schemes S2 and S3). Nitrogen adsorption measurements of ZIF-L were performed at 77 K on an automatic gas sorption analyzer (Ankersmid BelSorp Max). Surface area values were determined from N2 adsorption data following the multi-point Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method over a relative pressure range, p/p 0, of 0.05–0.25 [36]. Thermal properties of the ZIF-L and the membranes were measured under nitrogen atmosphere by thermos-gravimetric analysis (TGA, SHIMADZU TGA-60) at temperatures ranging from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Mechanical properties of the membranes (1 cm × 4 cm) were tested by an Instron mechanical tester (Testometric AX350) with a stretching rate of 2 mm min−1 at ambient temperature. Water and alcohol contact angles of the membranes were performed by a contact angle analyzer (Data-Physics OCA-15E) through the sessile drop method [37]. The resultant ZIF-L nanosheets were adhered onto slides and compacted into flakes. A water droplet with volume of 2 μL with a rate of 1 μL s−1 was formed on the surface. A side-view picture was captured after 10 s to acquire the static water contact angle [38]. Contact angles of each sample were measured at five different sites and then averaged. Time-dependent changes in the contact angle for alcohols (ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol) were recorded and the results are presented in Fig. S1. The contact angle value was determined till a stable state was reached. The surface properties of the membranes were normally determined by surface free energy following the Owens and Wendt's method [39], as shown below: (1) γ s ( 1 + cos θ ) = 2 γ s d γ m d + 2 γ s h γ m h (2) γ m = γ m d + γ m h where θ (o) is the contact angle between solvent and membrane, γ s and γ m (ergs cm−2) are the surface energies of the solvent and membrane, and γ d and γ h (ergs cm−2) are the dispersion force and hydrogen bonding components of surface energy, respectively."
6,Measurement of solvent uptake,"2.5 Measurement of solvent uptake Solvent uptake of the membrane was determined by sorption method [40]. Dried square films (2 cm × 2 cm) were precisely weighed on a microbalance (W dry, g). Then the films were immersed in different solvents (water, ethanol, n-propanol, or n-butanol) at room temperature. After the swelling equilibrium was reached, the films were wiped with tissue paper quickly to remove the residual solvent and weighed again (W wet, g). Each film was measured three times under the same conditions, and an average value was taken with an error within 4.8%. Solvent uptake was calculated by the changes in weight from swollen to dry membranes as follows: (3) Solvent uptake(%) = W wet − W dry W dry × 100"
7,Membrane pervaporation performance evaluation,"2.6 Membrane pervaporation performance evaluation Pervaporation experiments were conducted with a cross-flow apparatus with a flow rate of 90 L h−1, as determined by our previous studies [40,41]. The effective membrane area was 20 cm2. Diluted alcohol aqueous solutions (ethanol, n-propanol, or n-butanol) were circulated in the upstream side using a magnetic drive pump. The feed temperature was conducted by a heating mantle at a given temperature. The downstream side was maintained below 300 Pa by a vacuum pump. The initial experiment was run for 2 h to acquire the stable temperature and establish the mass transfer equilibrium. The permeate sample was collected using a cold trap immersed in liquid nitrogen at intervals of 1 h. When the operating condition was varied, another 1 h was permitted to regain a steady state. The alcohol concentrations in the feed and permeate were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7890II, Tianmei Science Instruments Co. Ltd.). The standard deviations were obtained from three independent membranes fabricated in exactly the same way. Each membrane was measured three times under the identical conditions. The permeation total flux (J) and separation factor (α i/j) were determined as follows: (4) J = W A × t (5) α i/j = m ip / ( 1 − m ip ) m if / ( 1 − m if ) where W (g) is the total weight of the permeate collected in t hours, A (m2) is the effective membrane area, and m if and m ip are the concentrations (wt%) of component i in the feed and permeate sample, respectively. Fluxes were normalized to a membrane thickness of 10 μm. Partial flux (water or alcohol) was calculated according to the total flux and the permeate composition. The intrinsic properties of MMMs are usually expressed in terms of permeability and selectivity. Permeability (barrer, 1 barrer = 10−10 cm3 (STP) cm cm−2 s−1 cmHg−1) was determined by eliminating the effect of driving forces on permeation flux [42]. The permeability (P) and the selectivity (β i/j) were defined as follows: (6) P i = J i × δ p if − p ip = J i × δ χ if n if p if sat − n ip p p (7) β i/j = P i P j where J i (g m−2 h−1) is the permeation flux of component i, δ (m) is the active layer thickness, p if and p ip (Pa) are the partial pressure of component i over and under the membrane, χ if, n if, and p sat if (Pa) are the activity coefficient, mole fraction, and saturation pressure of component i over the membrane, n ip is the mole fraction of component i under the membrane, p p (300 Pa) is the permeate side pressure, and P i and P j (barrer) are the permeability of component i and j, respectively. The saturation vapor pressure of component i was determined by the Antoine equation. The activity coefficients of different feed concentrations and temperatures were calculated by the software Aspen Plus [4,42]. Permeation flux of component i should be converted to the volumes under standard temperature and pressure (STP)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the ZIF-L,"3.1 Characterization of the ZIF-L ZIF-L nanosheets were prepared by the coordination of Zn2+ ions with Hmim in aqueous solution. Fig. 1 a shows that the ZIF-L exhibited a unique leaf-like shape with dimensions of about 5.6 μm × 2.2 μm and a thickness of about 136 nm. The composition of ZIF-L (C10H16N5O3/2Zn) was determined by elemental analysis, which was confirmed by EDXS mapping (Fig. 1b). The textural properties of ZIF-L were investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. 1c), suggesting a typical type-I profile. The calculated BET surface area, Langmuir surface area and micropore volume were 152 m2 g−1, 201 m2 g−1, and 0.062 cm3 g−1, respectively, in good accordance with literature data [27]. ZIF-L has the permanent microporosity and accessible voids available for guest inclusion. High purity and crystallinity of the ZIF-L were testified by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1d, the diffraction peaks matched well with those of ZIF-L powder and simulated ZIF-L. Indeed, ZIF-L has an aperture of 3.4 Å in diameter perpendicular to the 2D crystal layer. Moreover, ZIF-L has a cushion-shaped cavity with dimensions of 9.4 Å × 7.0 Å × 5.3 Å (See Scheme S2). As determined by a Rietveld refinement, such a special cavity is very suitable for accommodating small molecules [21,29]. Contact angle measurements of ZIF-L verified the close affinities with each of these alcohols (Fig. 1e). The contact angles of ZIF-L for the alcohols reached 0° in 7 s. The longer chain alcohols showed stronger affinity with the ZIF-L. By contrast, a water contact angle of about 132° revealed the strongly water-repellent nature of ZIF-L. Collectively, the leaf-like porous ZIF-L was successfully synthesized and presented great potential as fillers in the MMMs for alcohol recovery from aqueous solution."
10,Characterization of the membranes,"3.2 Characterization of the membranes 3.2.1 Morphology of the membranes Surface morphologies of the membranes were observed by SEM in Fig. 2 . The surface of PDMS control membrane was dense and homogeneous without appreciable defects (Fig. 2a). More ZIF-L nanosheets appeared on membrane surface as the loading increased (Fig. 2b–e). And the ZIF-L nanosheets were dispersed uniformly within PDMS matrix, implying their good compatibility. The incorporation of ZIF-L gave rough surface to the membranes with some sheet wrinkles. Note that some ZIF-L nanosheets were not parallel to the membrane surface of ZIF-L/PDMS-30 (Fig. 2d). It was thus expected that the transport properties of in ZIF-L/PDMS-30 were different from the other membranes. As the loading was increased up to 40 wt%, the membrane still presented the homogeneity between the PDMS and ZIF-L (Fig. 2e). Considering strong surface tension and weak affinity with polymer matrix, the fillers tended to aggregate at excessive loading. Fig. 2f shows the obvious sheet agglomeration on the membrane surface of ZIF-L/PDMS-50. Thus the higher loading was not pursued. Cross-sectional morphologies of the membranes were presented in Fig. 3 and S2 at low and high magnifications, respectively. There was no sign of pinhole voids between the active layer and the PVDF support. By comparison, the ZIF-L was discerned clearly as sheet wrinkles in the membranes. For ZIF-L/PDMS-X (X < 30) membranes, the ZIF-L was completely wrapped within PDMS bulk. Coupled with the surface SEM images (Fig. 2b and c), a nacre-like brick-and-mortar architecture might be established in the membrane. When the ZIF-L loading reached 30 wt% (Fig. 3d and S2d), the ZIF-L nanosheets were interconnected throughout the PDMS matrix without interfacial defects. However, at MOF loadings of 40 wt% and above, it was not easy to distinguish the MOF and polymer regions (Fig. 3 and S2). And visible interfacial voids were observed between the ZIF-L and PDMS matrix. Two reasons were probably the major contributions to this phenomenon. On one hand, the excessive loading caused the severe agglomeration of ZIF-L within PDMS matrix. On the other hand, the interfacial voids would generate during the membrane freeze-fracture in liquid nitrogen. Note that the thickness of active layer varied with ZIF-L loading. The active layer thickness for each membrane was averaged to be 10.7 μm (PDMS), 8.8 μm (10 wt%), 14 μm (20 wt%), 17.3 μm (30 wt%), 23.2 μm (40 wt%), and 38.7 μm (50 wt%), respectively. To more accurately determine the active layer thickness, the elemental composition of ZIF-L/PDMS-30 cross-section was analyzed by EDXS. As shown in Fig. 3g, a contrast difference about 18 μm was observed between the PDMS layer (Si signal) and the PVDF support (F signal). The pores of PVDF support were partially intruded by PDMS matrix (Si signal), thus increasing the membrane stability. Moreover, the well-distributed Zn and N signals verified the uniform dispersion of ZIF-L nanosheets in the PDMS matrix. 3.2.2 Microstructure of the membranes The XRD patterns and FTIR spectra of the membranes were recorded to explore the microstructure of polymer matrix and the presence of ZIF-L. As shown in Fig. 4 a, a broad peak centered at 2θ value of 12° was observed in the XRD pattern of PDMS control membrane, implying its amorphous property. By comparison, the XRD patterns of ZIF-L and ZIF-L/PDMS membranes matched well. And the peak intensity increased with the increase of ZIF-L loading. So the PDMS matrix did not change the intrinsic structure of ZIF-L. Furthermore, the XRD patterns elucidated the preferential orientation of ZIF-L in the membrane. The (004) reflection (red dot in Fig. 4a) appeared in various ZIF-L orientation. Only the (h00) peaks (blue triangles in Fig. 4a) corresponded to the [200], [400] and [800] planes of ZIF-L were observed in patterns of ZIF-L/PDMS-X (X < 30) [43]. This finding corroborated that the formation of brick-and-mortar architecture in the membrane. However, the (020) reflection (olive star in Fig. 4a) was observed in the XRD pattern of ZIF-L/PDMS-30, which was attributed to the vertical orientation of ZIF-L [21,28]. As the ZIF-L loading further increased, the diffraction peaks belonging to ZIF-L were exactly consistent with the diffraction peaks of randomly oriented ZIF-L powder (Fig. 1d). Further evidence of the presence of ZIF-L in the membrane was provided by FTIR spectra. As shown in Fig. 4b, the characteristic band of PVDF support at 1178 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of F–C–F. In the spectrum of PDMS control membrane, this band disappeared after coating PDMS layer, which indicated that the PVDF support was entirely covered without defects. Three bands at 1259 cm−1, 1086 cm−1, and 1012 cm−1 (dashed lines in Fig. 4b) corresponded to the CH3 symmetric bending in Si–CH3, Si–O–Si stretching vibration, and CH3 rocking in Si–CH3, respectively. The characteristic bands (olive stars in Fig. 4b) of ZIF-L appeared at 1568 cm−1 (stretching vibration of CN), 1307 cm−1 (stretching vibration of C–N), 1145 cm−1 (bending vibration of C–H), and 754 cm−1 (bending vibration of C–N). By comparison, no new bands were observed in the spectrum of ZIF-L/PDMS-30, which indicated that the ZIF-L nanosheets were physically dispersed within PDMS matrix. 3.2.3 Thermal and mechanical properties of the membranes As a critical component in PV, the membrane must have sufficient thermal and mechanical properties under complex conditions and long-term use. Thermal properties of the membranes were explored by TGA in nitrogen. As shown in Fig. 5 a, all the membranes underwent three weight-loss stages: (i) the first stage (30–264 °C) was the evaporation of residual solvents adsorbed in the membrane, (ii) the second stage (264–558 °C) was the pyrolysis of branched chains on PDMS, and (iii) the last stage (558–800 °C) was the degradation of PDMS backbones. Accordingly to the residual char yield at 800 °C [44], the calculated loadings of ZIF-L were 7.3 wt% (ZIF-L/PDMS-10), 16.7 wt% (ZIF-L/PDMS-20), 22.9 wt% (ZIF-L/PDMS-30), 32.5 wt% (ZIF-L/PDMS-40), and 39.8 wt% (ZIF-L/PDMS-50), respectively. The degradation temperature (T d) at 10% weight loss was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the membranes [14]. It should be pointed out that the ZIF-L possesses lower thermal stability than that of PDMS matrix. As expected, embedding ZIF-L reduced the T d of ZIF-L/PDMS-X to below 380 °C, which was lower than 425 °C of PDMS. This reduction was rationally ascribed to the presence of ZIF-L, which interfered with the compactness of PDMS bulk and promoted the chain mobility [45]. As the ZIF-L loading increased, the T d of ZIF-L/PDMS-X decreased from 380 to 316 °C. The results revealed that the resultant membranes were thermally stable till 264 °C, which was higher than the operating temperature (generally less than 80 °C). Such thermal stability could meet the requirements of practical pervaporation operation. The changes of PDMS chain mobility also influenced the mechanical properties of the membranes, as reflected by their stress-strain curves. Fig. 5b and Table 2 show that the PDMS control membrane had good mechanical stability with a tensile strength of 0.79 MPa and an elastic modulus of 2.29 MPa [14]. By comparison, the incorporating ZIF-L endowed the membranes with reinforced mechanical stabilities through the physical interactions (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions). The ZIF-L/PDMS-30 membrane displayed the highest mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 1.99 MPa (2.52 times as much as that of PDMS control membrane) and an elastic modulus of 3.86 MPa (69% more than that of PDMS control membrane). More intriguingly, its elongation at break reached up to 151.78% in comparison with 66.37% of PDMS control membrane. Such improvement was probably due to the constructed brick-and-mortar architecture in the membrane [32]. This typical architecture has the following features: (i) the parallel orientation of 2D fillers; (ii) the excellent compatibility between 2D materials and polymers. The efficient load transfer between rigid 2D materials and flexible polymers could endow the membranes with remarkable mechanical properties. As can be seen in Figs. 2–4, the resultant membranes possessed the brick-and-mortar architecture with horizontally oriented ZIF-L as “bricks” and flexible PDMS bulk as “mortar”. PDMS contains a great deal of methyl groups, which interacted with methyl groups of Hmim by van der Waals interactions. Moreover, the cross-linker APTES containing amino groups could form hydrogen bonds with the imidazole ring of Hmim. These factors jointly conferred the robust interfacial adhesion on the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes, thus improving the mechanical stabilities. At higher loadings (40 and 50 wt%), however, the mechanical stabilities of the as-prepared membranes declined rapidly. This anomaly was mainly attributed to ZIF-L agglomeration within PDMS matrix (Fig. 3 and S2). A proper comparison of tensile strength of as-prepared ZIF-L/PDMS membranes with literature data was quite difficult on account of the different membrane preparation conditions, including type and source of PDMS, filler type and loading, annealing temperature and time, etc. Each of these factors had a major impact on mechanical properties of the membrane. For instance, we employed another PDMS with a viscosity of 50 000 mPa s to prepare the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes for investigating the mechanical properties. Fig. S3 and Table 2 show that under the identical conditions, the higher viscosity of PDMS could improve the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the membranes but reduce the elongation at break. This might be closely related to the cross-linking degree of PDMS matrix. As shown in Fig. 5c (see also Table S1), the resultant membranes in this study exhibited comparable tensile strength when compared with the other PDMS-based membranes. Thus, the high ZIF-L loading and the favorable thermal and mechanical properties of the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes were beneficial for achieving high separation performance for various applications. 3.2.4 Surface properties and solvent uptake of the membranes Pervaporation is a membrane-based separation technology, which relies on the preferential adsorption and diffusion of target component across the membrane. Contact angle, revealing the hydrophobic/organophilic nature of a membrane, clearly reflects the adsorption and solution for penetrants. Fig. 6 a suggests that a water contact angle of 109° was attained by PDMS control membrane deriving from the intrinsic hydrophobicity of PDMS matrix. By comparison, the presence of ZIF-L improved notably the water contact angles of ZIF-L/PDMS membranes to the range of 114–142°. It is well known that the surface hydrophobicity of a membrane is mainly influenced by the surface chemistry and surface roughness [44,46,47]. On one hand, the addition of ZIF-L substantially enhanced the membrane hydrophobicity because it is highly hydrophobic (Fig. 1e). On the other hand, the embedding ZIF-L endowed the membranes with increased surface roughness (Fig. 2). However, when the ZIF-L loading further increased from 30 to 50 wt%, the water contact angle declined from 142° to 123°. This reduction was probably attributed to the ZIF-L agglomeration. The opposite tendency of their alcohol contact angles further confirmed the above hypothesis. More specifically, the introduced ZIF-L caused a significant decrease in the alcohol contact angles of ZIF-L/PDMS membranes, suggesting the stronger affinity with alcohols. It is worth noting that the contact angles of all the membranes increased as follows: n-butanol < n-propanol < ethanol < water, contrast to the order of their molecular size. Based on the Hansen solubility parameters (Table 1), the dispersion force fraction increases for longer chain alcohols, whereas the polar force and hydrogen bonding fractions decrease. Owing to the low polarity, the PDMS interacted with these alcohols mainly through the dispersion force. Thus the order of preferential adsorption of molecules onto the membranes was as follows: n-butanol > n-propanol > ethanol > water. Surface free energy was employed to further study the surface properties of the membranes. Fig. 6b suggests that the PDMS control membrane had a low surface free energy at 21.59 erg cm−2. By comparison, the incorporation of ZIF-L reduced dramatically surface free energy of the membranes. The ZIF-L/PDMS-30 displayed the minimal surface free energy about 2.34 erg cm−2. The reduced γ m would enhance antifouling performance of the membranes if integrated with the fermentation of bio-alcohols [34,42]. The solvent uptake is a vital factor to assess the free volume and separation performance of the membranes, as it strongly affects the dissolution and diffusion behaviors for penetrants. As shown in Fig. 7 , the alcohol uptakes of PDMS control membrane were much higher than the water uptake. The Hildebrand solubility parameter for water is 47.8 MPa0.5 (Table 1). The corresponding parameters for longer chain alcohols (26.5, 24.5 and 23.1 MPa0.5 for ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol, respectively) are quite closer to that of PDMS (16.6 MPa0.5). Thus these alcohols are more easily to dissolve in the PDMS matrix than the water. Owing to the stronger affinity with PDMS matrix, the longer chain alcohols donated the higher uptakes to the membranes. Abnormally, the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes showed higher water uptakes than the PDMS control membrane. Moreover, the water uptake increased as the ZIF-L loading increased. This implied that the presence of ZIF-L enlarged the free volume in the PDMS matrix [17]. Another possible reason for higher water uptake was the aperture size of ZIF-L (3.4 Å) which is larger than the kinetic diameter of water (2.96 Å). Thus the water molecules could have access to the pores of ZIF-L. As noticed by Li et al. [48] and Wang et al. [26], the water uptakes of the membranes were enhanced similarly with the increase of MOF (ZIF-7 or MIL-53) loading. Given that the ZIF-L has micro-porosity and alcohol affinity (Fig. 1c and e), the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes should have higher alcohol uptakes than the PDMS control membrane. The embedding ZIF-L caused a significant increase in the ethanol uptake, which exerted the function of a “solvent reservoir”. In contrast, the n-propanol uptake remained a stable value after adding ZIF-L, and even reduced somewhat. This decrease was more pronounced for n-butanol. The reason was that the major fractions of n-propanol and n-butanol were mainly adsorbed within polymer matrix [42,49]."
11,Pervaporation performance of the membranes,"3.3 Pervaporation performance of the membranes The effects of ZIF-L loading, feed concentration and temperature on the separation performance of ZIF-L/PDMS membranes were investigated systematically. Partial fluxes of water and alcohols were determined by the permeation total flux and the permeate composition. Many variables, including the membrane thickness and driving forces, should be eliminated to accurately assess the intrinsic membrane property [4,50]. Therefore, the membrane fluxes and separation factors were converted to permeabilities and selectivities, respectively. 3.3.1 Effect of ZIF-L loading on the membrane performance The effect of ZIF-L content on the pervaporation performance is shown in Fig. 8 . The pervaporation separation of 5 wt% alcohol aqueous solution (ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol) was conducted at 40 °C with a flow of 90 L h−1. Because the active layer thickness was closely related to the ZIF-L loading (Fig. 3), the fluxes were normalized to a membrane thickness of 10 μm. It was found that the separation performance of the membranes increased with the carbon number of the alcohols. The membrane swelling and driving force were the main contributions for the remarkable increase in permeation flux. The ZIF-L/PDMS membranes had higher uptakes for the longer chain alcohols (Fig. 7). The increased free volume within PDMS matrix provided the lower permeation resistance for penetrants [51]. Moreover, the alcohol vapor partial pressure difference (i.e., driving force) for 5 wt% alcohol aqueous solutions at 40 °C were 1.5 kPa (ethanol), 1.6 kPa (n-propanol), and 1.1 kPa (n-butanol). Not only the alcohol–polymer and water–membrane interactions, but also the interaction between the water and the alcohol determines the separation factor. The resultant membranes had strongly hydrophobicity and closer affinity with longer chain alcohols (Fig. 6a); meanwhile, the longer chain alcohols presented weaker interactions with water originating from hydrogen bonding. As expected, the alcohol separation factors of the membranes increased in the order of ethanol < n-propanol < n-butanol, which was in good consistent with the theoretical prediction based on the Hansen solubility parameters (Table 1). Note that the ZIF-L contributed positively to the separation performance of the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes. By comparison, the addition of ZIF-L improved effectively the normalized flux and separation factor of the PDMS control membrane, revealing a favorable anti-tradeoff effect. The normalized fluxes increased quasi-linearly with the increase of ZIF-L loading from 0 to 30 wt % (Fig. 8a). This enhancement was reasonably due to the presence of porous ZIF-L, which enlarged the free volume within PDMS matrix and endowed more permeation pathways for penetrants. As shown in Fig. 8b, the alcohol separation factors of the membranes gradually increased with the increase of ZIF-L loading from 10 to 30 wt% and reached maximum values of αethanol = 14.3, α n-propanol = 24.6, and α n-butanol = 35.9. The increase in separation factor was analyzed by the solution-diffusion model. On one hand, the water contact angle increased from 109° to 142° with the increase of ZIF-L loading from 0 to 30 wt%; meanwhile, the higher ZIF-L loading caused the smaller contact angles for alcohols (Fig. 6a). Consequently, the alcohol adsorption selectivity of the membranes was gradually enhanced. On the other hand, the diffusion selectivity also has a great influence on the separation factor. As listed in Table 1, the kinetic diameters of ethanol (4.3 Å), n-propanol (4.7 Å), and n-butanol (4.9 Å) are in principle larger than the aperture size of ZIF-L (3.4 Å). These alcohol molecules are still able to diffuse across the ZIF-L (Schemes S2 and S3). This should be related to the gate opening effect of ZIF-L with flexible structure [42]. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the penetrants with kinetic diameters similar to or greater than the MOF window diameter can jump through a window, which required relatively high activation energy [53]. Thus the diffusion pathways for alcohols were shortened with lower transfer resistance in the membrane. In contrast, since the 2D anisotropic structure of ZIF-L and the constructed brick-and-mortar architecture in the membrane, the water molecules tended to detour the hydrophobic ZIF-L nanosheets and then diffused to the next interlayer (i.e., PDMS matrix). The significant difference of adsorption and diffusion behaviors between water and alcohols endowed the membranes with the increasing separation factors. More importantly, the relatively continuous diffusion pathways for penetrants were created in the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 membrane because the ZIF-L nanosheets were connected to each other throughout PDMS matrix without interfacial defects (Fig. 3d and S2d). As a result, the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 possessed the optimal overall pervaporation performance. When the ZIF-L loading was higher than 30 wt%, the normalized fluxes leaped dramatically, but the separation factors decreased. Collectively, the random distribution of ZIF-L nanosheets at higher loading caused the severe agglomeration (Figs. 2 and 3), which limited further enhancement of the membrane performance. As noticed by Jiang et al. [21], the spin-coating method could generate a thin and defect-free active layer with horizontally-oriented ZIF-L nanosheets, which simultaneously enhanced the membrane flux and separation factor. Therefore, this strategy will pave a way to improve the membrane performance for alcohol recovery from aqueous solution. Fig. 9 elucidates the function of ZIF-L on the intrinsic membrane property. According to the pioneering work by Cussler et al. [52], the permeability of one component in MMMs is highly dependent on the volume fraction and aspect ratio of two-dimensional fillers. The impermeable two-dimensional fillers usually decrease membrane permeability. While the flexible pore structure of ZIF-L contributed to the “gate opening” effect [53], these alcohols could readily diffuse through the ZIF-L pores rather than through the dense PDMS matrix. The increase of ZIF-L loading offered the more permeation pathways for alcohols. Thus the alcohol permeabilities of ZIF-L/PDMS membranes increased continuously with the ZIF-L loading (Fig. 9a), which were higher than those of PDMS control membrane. Interestingly, the water permeabilities of the membranes also increased as the ZIF-L loading increased. The kinetic diameter of water (2.96 Å) is smaller than the aperture size of ZIF-L (3.4 Å). Thus the water molecules might get through the ZIF-L pores [42]. For another, the addition of ZIF-L enlarged the free volume of the membranes, facilitating the water permeation. These two factors were responsible for the unfavourable increase of water permeabilities. In agreement with the order of affinity with PDMS matrix of these three alcohols, the alcohol permeabilities of the membranes increased as follows: ethanol < n-propanol < n-butanol. In contrast, the corresponding water permeabilities decreased slightly. A possible reason was that the weaker coupling effect between water and longer chain alcohols through such as hydrogen bonding. It also explained why the membranes had higher selectivities for longer chain alcohols (Fig. 9b). However, the membrane selectivities decreased simultaneously at higher ZIF-L loading (above 30 wt%). This decrease was ascribed to the agglomeration of ZIF-L, which formed the nonselective interfacial voids at excessive loading. These interfacial voids were considered as preferential permeation pathways for water molecules. Since the kinetic diameter of water (2.96 Å) is smaller than that of alcohols (4.3–4.9 Å), the water permeation was more sensitive. Thus the increment rate of water permeabilities was higher than that of alcohol permeabilities. Therefore, the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 was employed for the subsequent operating conditions and long-term stability studies. 3.3.2 Effect of feed concentration on the membrane performance Effects of operating conditions on the membrane performance were investigated by regulating the feed concentration and temperature. Fig. 10 shows the pervaporation performance of the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 as a function of alcohol concentration in feed, including ethanol and n-butanol. The ethanol concentration varied from 1 to 10 wt%, and the n-butanol concentration was in the range of 1–5 wt%. With the increase of alcohol concentration in feed, the total flux of the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 increased linearly, but the separation factor gradually decreased. This was because of the synergy of driving force and membrane swelling [50,54]. It is worth pointing out that the increased total flux was largely attributed to the significant enhancement in alcohol flux. The higher alcohol concentration notably enhanced the partial pressure difference (i.e., driving force) for alcohols across the membrane (Fig. S4). The increasing alcohol concentration facilitated the alcohol sorption into the membrane and hence led to the membrane swelling. Simultaneously, the increased free volume and polymer chain flexibility enhanced the water permeation through the membrane. However, the driving force for water permeation weakened with the increasing alcohol concentration. The positive swelling effects on water permeation might be offset by the negative driving force effect. As a result, the water flux remained a relatively stable value. It was also the reason for the decrease of separation factor at high alcohol concentration. With the increase of feed concentration (Fig. 10b and d), the alcohol permeability decreased steadily while the water permeability increased slightly, thus decreasing the membrane selectivity. According to the solution-diffusion mechanism, this phenomenon could be explained as follows: (i) the higher feed concentration was beneficial for the alcohol dissolution into the membrane by virtue of the more adsorption sites, which was on the contrary for water; (ii) the membrane swelling enhanced the free volume and motility of polymer chains, but it also lengthened the diffusion pathways (i.e., thicker membrane) for penetrants. For the larger-size alcohol molecules, the decline of diffusion was more pronounced than the enhancement of dissolution, thereby decreasing the alcohol permeability. In contrast, the enhancement of diffusion for water surpassed the decrease of dissolution, probably due to its smaller kinetic diameter. Therefore, the membrane selectivity declined gradually as the alcohol concentration in feed increased. 3.3.3 Effect of feed temperature on the membrane performance The influence of feed temperature on the pervaporation performance of the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 is shown in Fig. 11 . The operating temperature ranged from 40 to 70 °C in separating the 5 wt% ethanol aqueous solution; meanwhile, the pervaporation of 1 wt% n-butanol aqueous solution was carried out from 40 to 80 °C. As the feed temperature increased, the polymer chain mobility, partial pressure difference (Fig. S5) of each component, and kinetic energy of penetrant molecules simultaneously increased [55]. As expected, the alcohol and water fluxes increased continuously (Fig. 11a1 and b1). Since the former increased faster than the latter, the separation factor increased gradually. The temperature dependence of alcohol flux and water flux was further studied by an Arrhenius-type equation [56], as follows: (8) J i = A 0,i exp ( − E A,i / R T ) where J i is the permeation flux of component i, A 0,i is the pre-exponential factor, E A,i is the apparent activation energy (kJ mol−1) of the component i through the membrane, respectively, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), and T is the bulk liquid temperature (K). The apparent activation energy (E A,i) for penetrant permeation through the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 was determined by the slope of the plots. The results are summarized in Tables 3–5 . It was notable that when the ethanol concentration was 5 wt% (Fig. S6 and Fig. 11a2), the E A values of the PDMS control and ZIF-L/PDMS-30 membranes for ethanol and water were similar with those of the pervaporation of 1 wt% ethanol aqueous solution (Fig. S7). A listed in Tables 3 and 4, the low ethanol concentration had little influence on E A value for ethanol permeation. For ZIF-L/PDMS-30 (Tables 4 and 5), the E A values of ethanol and n-butanol were 27.35 kJ mol−1 and 30.68 kJ mol−1, while that of water was 22.78 kJ mol−1 and 23.45 kJ mol−1 in pervaporation of 1 wt% ethanol and n-butanol aqueous solutions, respectively (Fig. S7 and Fig. 11b2). On one hand, the kinetic diameter (4.3 Å) of ethanol molecules was smaller than that (4.9 Å) of n-butanol molecules. On the other hand, the hydrogen bond interactions between ethanol and water molecules were stronger than those of n-butanol and water molecules. Clearly, the E A of alcohols was higher than that of water. This implied that the alcohols preferentially permeated through the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 at higher temperature. Therefore, the separation factor increased with the increasing feed temperature. However, it is very difficult to predict the effect of feed temperature on the separation factor of the MMMs for alcohol recovery. Various results have been observed as shown below. Wang et al. [17] and Zhang et al. [4] noticed that the separation factor for alcohols increased as the feed temperature increased. Interestingly and in contrast to the above, Han et al. [57] and Vankelecom et al. [18] found that the separation factor decreased with the increasing feed temperature. Besides, Wan et al. [16] also observed that the separation factor remained relatively stable with increase of feed temperature. The difference of feed temperature on the separation factor was determined by many factors, including the fillers [4,18,57], support membrane [5,58], and even membrane thickness [15]. Further research is required to explain this phenomenon at a fundamental level. The permeability and selectivity of the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 were calculated to further identify the impact of feed temperature. Both alcohol and water permeabilities decreased with the increase of feed temperature. The decrease in water permeability was more pronounced than that of alcohol permeability, thereby increasing the membrane selectivity. As is well known, diffusivity increases while sorption decreases with increasing temperature [48]. It could be deduced that with the increase of feed temperature, the changes in sorption for water and alcohols surpassed the changes in diffusion, especially for water. This was mainly because of the stronger interaction between the membrane and alcohol molecules. More specifically, the permeation activation energy (E P) was calculated to evaluate the real contribution of the membrane itself, using Eq. (9) [59]: (9) E P,i = E A,i − Δ H evp,i (10) E P,i = E D,i + Δ H dis,i (11) P i = P 0,i exp ( − E P,i / R T ) where E P,i, E A,i, ΔH evp,i, E D,i, and ΔH dis,i are the permeation activation energy (kJ mol−1), apparent activation energy (kJ mol−1), enthalpy of evaporation (kJ mol−1), diffusion activation energy (kJ mol−1), and enthalpy of dissolution (kJ mol−1) of the component i through the membrane, respectively; P 0,i is the pre-exponential factor. As listed in Tables 3–5, all the E P values of the membranes were negative. According to Eq. (10), the E P is a combination of the activation energy of diffusion E D (always positive) and the enthalpy of dissolution ΔH dis (usually negative) of the penetrant in a membrane. The negative E P suggested that in ZIF-L/PDMS membranes, the dissolution process was the dominant step in PV separation. Coupled with Eq. (11), it also was the reason for the decrease of penetrant permeability (P i) at higher feed temperature, as discussed above. In addition, the E P values for penetrant permeation through the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 were lower than those of the PDMS control membrane. Therefore, the incorporating ZIF-L decreased the permeation energy barriers for penetrants. 3.3.4 Extended trial of the membrane Lack of stability is one of the biggest obstacles encountered by the membrane. An urgent demand for long-term stability has stimulated the researchers to exploit the highly robust membranes. Sometimes, the feed circulation and vacuum pumps are inevitably stopped in practical use. Once the pumps are opened suddenly, the soaring pressure generated by the pneumatic hammer effect may destroy the membrane integrity. As shown in Fig. 12 , the long-term performance of the ZIF-L/PDMS-30 membrane was studied in the separation of 5 wt% ethanol and 1 wt% n-butanol aqueous solutions, respectively. Throughout the experiment, the alcohol was added into feed tank at intervals for achieving a given feed concentration. Meanwhile, the resultant membrane was mounted in the membrane module without teardown. The feed kept contact with the membrane surface even when stopping the feed circulation and vacuum pumps at night (marked by light-blue areas). Upon vacuuming the permeate side, the membrane performance regained to that previously observed under identical conditions. By this means, the long-term stability and reusability of the membrane were assessed at the same time. During the 110-h cycling experiment, both the permeation total flux and alcohol concentration in permeate were stable. Due to the excellent thermal and mechanical stabilities, the membrane exhibited the potential long-term stability and reusability for practical applications, especially for alcohol recovery from aqueous solution."
12,Comparison with literature data,"3.4 Comparison with literature data A comparison of pervaporation performance of the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes prepared in this study with the other reported membranes under identical conditions, is illustrated in Fig. 13 . The operating conditions highly affect the separation factor and permeation flux of a membrane. 5 wt% ethanol and 1 wt% n-butanol aqueous solutions were employed as the feeds at 40 °C, respectively. Nevertheless, it is still not easy to properly compare the separation performance of the membranes arising from the different formation conditions, such as source and cross-linking degree of polymer matrix, type and loading of fillers, pre- and post-treatments of the membranes, membrane-forming method, support material, active layer thickness, etc. Most of the membranes for ethanol recovery were PDMS-based membranes, while various materials (e.g., PDMS and PEBA) were utilized for preparing the n-butanol permselective membranes. Despite all these differences, the as-prepared ZIF-L/PDMS membranes displayed superior performance in comparison with the other membranes. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 13a (see also Table S2), the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes had the state-of-the-art overall performance for ethanol recovery when compared with the other PDMS-based membranes. In particular, the performance of ZIF-L/PDMS-30 membrane exceeded the upper bound line of the reported butanol permselective membranes (Fig. 13b and Table S3). The ZIF-L/PDMS-30 exhibited a high separation factor of 57.6 with a comparable total flux of 402 g m−2 h−1 in separating 1 wt% n-butanol aqueous solution at 40 °C, and the n-butanol concentration in the permeate was around 36.8 wt%. The presence of hydrophobic and porous ZIF-L facilitated the sorption and diffusion of the penetrants across the membranes. Furthermore, the relatively continuous diffusion pathways for penetrants were constructed in the membranes because the ZIF-L nanosheets could be closely connected within PDMS matrix without defects. These factors jointly contributed to the enhancement of separation performance of the membranes. By integrating alcohol preferential permeation pathways into a brick-and-mortar architecture, the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes achieved a stimulating combination of high separation performance and robust mechanical properties (Fig. 5c). Therefore, the resultant membrane could be a potential candidate for alcohol recovery from aqueous solution."
13,Conclusions,"In this study, a series of highly selective and robust MMMs were successfully prepared by incorporating two-dimensional ZIF-L nanosheets into PDMS matrix for alcohol permselective pervaporation. As a 2D ultrathin and porous MOF, the ZIF-L played the following three roles within the membrane: (i) the horizontally oriented ZIF-L constructed a distinct brick-and-mortar architecture; (ii) the hydrophobic and organophilic pore structure of ZIF-L facilitated the preferential permeation of alcohol molecules rather than water molecules, thus resulting in high separation factor and comparable permeation flux; (iii) the excellent interfacial interactions arising from the hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces between the ZIF-L and PDMS chains reinforced the mechanical properties of the membranes. The trade-off effect between membrane selectivity and mechanical properties was facilely addressed. The subtle interconnection of ZIF-L nanosheets without interfacial defects contributed to the formation of the relatively continuous permeation pathways for penetrants. Besides the above merits, the as-prepared membranes displayed the low surface free energy and good thermal properties, which guaranteed the antifouling property and long-term stability under complex conditions. The excellent separation performance combined with the robust mechanical properties made the ZIF-L/PDMS membranes potential candidates for alcohol recovery from the biological fermentation broths. These findings would enable the rational design and fabrication of high-performance membranes for other separations and promote the application of two-dimensional materials in the membrane field."
