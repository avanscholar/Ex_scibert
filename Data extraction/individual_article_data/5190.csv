0,Introduction,"In recent years, research on homogeneous catalysis using transition metal complexes has grown enormously. Even though many amazing catalytic discoveries have been made by researchers both in industry and academia, the search for the better catalysts is never ending. Reactions that were thought to be well understood and optimized have now been revolutionized with completely new catalysts and unmatched product selectivity. The activity and selectivity of a catalytic system are controlled by the characteristics of ligands attached to the metal centre. In the past, there were so many Schiff base complexes, which have shown extraordinary activity as catalysts in various organic conversions. One such simple Schiff base ligand with versatile coordination modes is thiosemicarbazone (TSC), which is paramount in the group of sulphur donor ligands [1–3]. The medicinal relevance of thiosemicarbazones (TSCs) and their metal complexes have gained substantial interest among chemists over a century [4–9]. TSC derivatives were used as analytical reagents and sensors in the selective and sensitive determination of metal ions [10–13]. Even though the biological and analytical applications of TSCs and their complexes have been explored for long, the reports on the catalytic activities of them were appearing only in the last two decades. Since 1990, several research teams have been involved in studying the catalytic activities of TSC complexes towards many industrially and biochemically important reactions. The transition metal complexes containing ligands with N, S or N, S, O donors are known to exhibit interesting stereochemical, electrochemical and electronic properties. TSCs contain chemically active R1R2C=N1−N2(H)−C(=S)N3R3R4 group having four potential coordination sites (three N and one S). Apart from this, the functional group(s) in the carbonyl compounds, which is(are) in close proximity to donating centers in thiosemicarbazide also form(s) additional coordination site(s). The coordinating ability of TSCs is attributed to extended delocalization of electron density over the R1R2C=N1−N2(H)−C(=S)N3R3R4 system, which is enhanced by the suitable substitution on the terminal nitrogen atom. The substituent(s) on the azomethine carbon of TSC ligands also influence(s) the mode of their binding. From the past reports, it is expected that the coordination ability of TSCs increases markedly on the introduction of nitrogen- or oxygen-containing substituent on azomethine carbon [14–17]. Such properties of TSCs fascinated the researchers to explore their coordination behaviour with different transition metal ions. Fig. 1 represents a variety of coordination modes observed in TSC complexes. Usually, TSCs coordinate either as a neutral ligand (thione form) or as a deprotonated anionic ligand (thiol form) through the sulfur atom and either the azomethine N atom to create a stable five membered chelate ring (i) [18] or the hydrazine N atom to make a more strained unusual four membered chelate ring (ii) [19]. If the ligand contains a third donor site (D) appropriately located for coordination (e.g. salicylaldehyde TSC), a D, N, S-tricoordination normally takes place (iii) [20]. In addition, the S-donor atoms of TSCs can bridge metal ions to form dinuclear [21] or multinuclear complexes (iv) [22]. Other coordination modes observed in TSC complexes include S-monodentate (v) [23] and N (thioamide), S-bidentate (vi) [24]. Thus, the greater number of coordination sites, in turn variable binding modes of TSC ligands in metal complexes provide certain advantages in the fields of pharmaceuticals and catalysis [25–27]. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that some TSCs belong to only class III of hazardous substances, and hence, they are promising compounds for practical applications [28]. Due to higher stability of TSC complexes, catalytic systems involving these complexes may leave only negligible metal residue in the products. The coordination behaviour of TSCs and catalytic applications of their metal complexes have been established briefly in the literature [21]. The prime objective here is to review the catalytic potentials of transition metal complexes containing TSC ligands. It focuses on organic transformations such as transfer hydrogenation, N-arylation, oxidation, cyclopropanation, epoxidation, alkylation, amidation and hydration catalyzed by metal complexes containing TSCs. It also covers a wide range of C–C cross-coupling reactions like Mizoroki-Heck, Suzuki-Miyaura, Sonogashira and Kumada-Corriu."
1,Transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds,"The reduction of carbonyl compounds is a fundamental transformation in the synthesis of several organic compounds in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. This can be carried out by transition metal complex-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) reaction using a hydrogen source. Mononuclear ruthenium(III) complexes of the type [RuX(EPh3)2(L)] (E = P or As; X = Cl or Br; L = dibasic terdentate dehydroacetic acid thiosemicarbazones (DHA-TSCs)) have been used as catalysts in the TH of various aliphatic and aromatic ketones in presence of isopropanol (iPrOH) as a hydrogen source and KOH as a base and catalytic activity of the active complex (1) is shown in Fig. 2 , which was reported by Ramesh and co-worker [29]. Even though the conversion in the case of substrate (acetophenone) without substituent was moderate (67.6 %), presence of electron-withdrawing (EWG) or -donating (EDG) substituent(s) on the substrate led to greater conversion (83–89 %). The complexes efficiently catalyzed the aliphatic ketones over aromatic and cyclic ketones. In the case of cyclic ketones, the complexes showed good catalytic activity for 8 membered ring cyclic ketone compared to 5, 6 and 7 membered ones. They showed higher catalytic efficiency than the other Ru complexes except Ru complexes containing Schiff base, azo or pincer ligands. Muthukumar et al., synthesized octahedral Ru(II) chalcone-based TSC complex (2), and well characterized using analytical and various spectroscopic tools. This Ru(II) complex (0.0125 mmol) work well for the TH of aryl aldehydes and ketones (82–91 %), but showed low yield for alkyl ketones (43 %) (Fig. 3) [30]. The formation of Ru(II) complex (3) through C–H activation of p-chloroacetophenone-based TSC ligand was reported by Pandiarajan and Ramesh [31]. TH of acetophenone and its derivatives in presence of Ru(II)-TSC catalyst (3) with substrate / catalyst / base molar ratio of 500 : 1 : 2.5 yielded their corresponding alcohols with 89–99 % conversion. In this TH reaction, KOH facilitated the formation of Ru-alkoxide by abstracting proton from iPrOH, and subsequent β-elimination of alkoxide yielded Ru−H active species. The same research group investigated the catalytic activity of half-sandwich ƞ6-p-cymene ruthenium(II)-p-chloroacetophenone TSC complex [Ru(ƞ6-p-cymene)Cl(L)]Cl (4) towards TH of aromatic and cyclic ketones (Fig. 4) [32] and it exhibited better catalytic efficiency than the already reported arene ruthenium(II) complexes [33]."
2,N-Arylation reaction,"Metal-catalyzed C–N coupling reaction represents one of the most efficient methods to form various C–N bond containing compounds that have important biological, pharmaceutical or material properties [34]. Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions are one of the most significant achievements in this field for replacing traditional Cu-catalyzed Ullmann reactions [35]. Ohta and co-workers were the first to report the direct arylation of several hetero aromatics with aryl halides using [Pd(PPh3)4] as catalyst in 1990. As the catalytic activity of complexes can be tuned by the coordinated ligands, the coordination versatility of the TSC ligands made them suitable for the preparation of good catalysts for the synthesis of N-arylated compounds. A series of Pd complexes, [PdCl(L)] (L = (un)substituted 9,10-phenanthrenequinone-based TSC / semicarbazone) has been synthesized and utilized for the N-arylation of imidazole using various aryl halides. It was observed that the unsubstituted aryl halides and electron-deficient group on the aryl halides afforded coupling products in excellent yield (85–96 %), whereas substrates with electron-rich group gave moderate to good yields (73–84 %). This reaction was less sensitive to steric factors and gave good to excellent yields (80–90 %) for ortho substituted aryl halides. Further, the coupling proceeded readily with aryl iodides to give excellent yield of the corresponding N-aryl derivative. Hetero aryl halides also reacted smoothly, giving a yield of 84–91 %. This catalytic system worked at mild reaction conditions with low reaction time and catalyst loading, and the efficiency in terms of yield and selectivity of products was higher than the existing catalytic systems [36]. Pd(II)-PPh3 complex incorporated with 1-naphthaldehyde TSC ligand (5) was utilized as a catalyst for the Buchwald-Hartwig amination reaction of a wide range of (hetero) aryl halides (bromides and chlorides) including activating, neutral and deactivating ones, with pyrolidine, piperidine and morpholine, using 2-BuOH as a solvent and K2CO3 as a base at 100 °C (Fig. 5) [37]. This protocol was also evaluated for the double amination of (hetero) aryl dibromides with the same set of secondary amines. The catalyst was quite effective for aryl bromides and dibromides. The investigation on the amination of less reactive aryl chlorides with secondary amines in presence of Pd(II)-TSC catalyst revealed that even though the yield of the final products was less for the aryl chlorides compared to bromo analogues, it was comparable with other similar catalytic systems."
3,Oxidation of alcohols,"Ru(II) and Ru(III) complexes bearing TSC ligands were synthesized, and utilized as catalysts for the conversion of primary / secondary alcohols to corresponding aldehydes / ketones in presence of NMO (N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide) as co-oxidant (Fig. 6). Both Ru(III) (6) and Ru(II) (7) complexes act as efficient catalysts for the conversion of secondary alcohols to ketones with the yield of 92–99 %, while primary alcohols gave the products with the yield of 61–89 %. These complexes were also good catalysts for the oxidation of cyclic (86–89 %) and aliphatic alcohols (82–89 %) in contrary to previously reported similar ruthenium catalysts [38,39]."
4,Cyclopropanation of olefins,"As cyclopropane derivatives have large number of applications due to their biological properties, and use as starting materials and intermediates in organic synthesis, production of these compounds become more significant [40]. A versatile method is the metal-catalyzed cyclopropanation of olefins with diazo compounds. To replace the highly expensive Rh or Ru catalysts, Cu complex (Fig. 7) of N,2-bis(1-(2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)ethylidene)hydrazine carbothiamide (8) was utilized as a catalyst for the cyclopropanation reaction. The catalyst (8) showed a medium activity at room temperature at a catalyst / ethyl diazo acetate (EDA) / olefin ratio of 1:500:2500, and produced the conversion of > 99 % in 345 min. If the temperature was raised from 28 to 65 °C, the reaction time reduced from 345 to 10 min, indicating significant influence of temperature in its catalytic activity. At the elevated temperatures, the activity towards cyclopropanation reaction was good to excellent with the yield of 80–97 % and turnover number (TON) of 16,900. This enhancement in reactivity at high temperatures is due to the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), which is mandatory to start the catalytic cycle [41]. Similarly, few oligomeric Cu-TSC complexes also exhibited remarkable yields towards cyclopropanation of aryl olefines. Ni(II) and Co(III) complexes of the same ligand were also utilized as catalysts for the cyclopropanation reaction [41,42]."
5,Olefin epoxidation,"The dioxomolybdenum(VI) [MoO2(VI)] complex (9) was synthesized from [MoO2(acac)2] and ONS donor TSC ligand [1-(2,4-dihydroxybenzilidine)-N-methyl-N-phenylthiosemicarbazones] (Fig. 8) in acetonitrile, and tested as a catalyst for the epoxidation of olefins using tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant at 80 °C. Cyclohexene was the most reactive substrate, which gave 98 % of epoxide while styrene and indene produced 44 and 51 % of corresponding epoxides, respectively. This catalytic system also showed good to moderate yield and chemoselectivity towards aliphatic olefins [43]. An environment friendly, solvent-free olefin epoxidation reactions were carried out in presence of dinuclear or mononuclear oxovanadium(V) complexes (0.05 mol%) containing TSC ligands (10–13) derived from pyridoxal and thiosemicarbazide (Fig. 8) [44]."
6,N-Alkylation of amines,"Ru(II) complexes containing PNS donor phosphino-based TSC ligands efficiently catalyze the N-alkylation of 2-aminobenzothioazole, other heterocyclic amines and diamines using alcohol as an alkyl source in toluene solvent in presence of KOH at 100 °C through hydrogen auto transfer process under moderate conditions. Among the five complexes synthesized, [RuCl(PNS-EtTSC)(CO)(AsPh3)] (14) acted as a better catalyst (0.5 mol%) (yield = 97 %, TON = 196) than the other Ru(II) complexes (Fig. 9). It has been observed that the complexes with TSC ligands showed greater efficiency than those with hydrazone ligands [45]. The same research group tested the catalytic activity of Cu(I) complexes with phosphine-functionalized TSCs (15–17) towards N-alkylation of amines (Fig. 9), and proved them as efficient catalysts (0.10 mol%) with maximum product yield of 99 % [46]."
7,Amidation of alcohols,"Selvamurugan et al., synthesized Ru(II) complexes containing 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline N-substituted TSC ligands, and used them as catalysts for the generation of N-benzylbenzamides from benzyl alcohol substrates in presence of a strong base like t-BuOK or KOH (15 %) at 120 °C (Fig. 10). The alcohol substrates (benzyl alcohol) bearing chloro or bromo (electron-withdrawing) group yielded the desired products with the yield of 97 and 98 %, respectively, whereas 92 and 87 % of amidated products were obtained from the substrates having electron-donating group like methyl or methoxy, respectively. The high catalytic efficiency of Ru(II)-TSC complex (18) was realized when 84 % yield was noted in the amidation of sterically hindered 2,3,4-trimethoxy benzyl alcohol [47]. Kanchanadevi et al., [48] reported a Ru(II) catalyst containing pyridoxal TSC ligand (19) for the synthesis of 1° amides. The complex (0.1 mol%) acted as good catalyst for the transformation of aryl/heteroaryl aldehydes to corresponding 1° amides in the presence of NH2OH·HCl and NaHCO3. The yield of products was up to 91 %, and the catalyst was reusable (Fig. 11)."
8,Hydration of nitriles,"In synthetic organic chemistry, hydration of nitriles into primary amides is a significant transformation since they are the key intermediates in the synthesis of bioactive products, drug stabilizers, lubricants, etc. Manikandan et al., reported Ru(II) carbonyl catalysts bearing pyridoxal TSC ligands and PPh3/AsPh3 for the hydration of nitriles to amides, and for the synthesis of biologically and pharmacologically important imidazoline derivatives [49]. Hydration of a series of aromatic, aliphatic and heterocyclic nitriles was performed under optimized conditions (0.3 mol% of catalyst, 1 h, 80 °C) using water. Catalytic efficiency varied with the substituent on the terminal part of TSC moiety and substrate. The order of reactivity of Ru(II) complexes (20–25) with respect to variation in substitution is methyl > hydrogen > phenyl. The percentage yield of amides obtained while using Ru-pyridoxal TSC catalyst was more than that observed for Ru complexes with simple salicylaldehyde TSC, indicating the role of pyridyl group in the catalysis (Fig. 12). This catalytic system is not only be efficient but also recyclable for at least 5 times without change in percentage conversion."
9,Cross-coupling reactions,"In the 1970′s, for the synthesis of biaryl compounds, many cross-coupling reactions between aryl halides and aryl magnesium/nickel have been reported [50–52]. In the later part of the same decade, Suzuki and Miyaura reported cross-coupling reaction between alkenylboranes and various organic halides [53,54]. There were so many other cross-coupling reactions reported by Mizoroki, Heck, Stille, Sonogashira, Kumada, Corriu, etc. C–C and C−hetero atom cross-coupling reactions especially with aryl halides catalyzed by transition metal complexes are the most powerful and versatile tool in organic synthesis. The catalytic efficiency of the metal complexes can be enhanced by the steric and electronic characteristics of ligands. In the mechanistic perspective, oxidative addition is governed by electronic effects, and transmetallation and reductive elimination are governed by both steric and electronic effects. Earlier, many organometallic reagents have been developed for cross-coupling reactions using different Pd catalysts such as [Pd(PPh3)4] [55], [Pd(OAc)2] [56], [PdCl2(dppb)] (dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane) [57], [Pd(dba)2] (dba = bis(dibenzylideneacetone)) [58], [PdCl2(PPh3)2] [59], [PdCl2(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [60], etc. Most of these Pd complexes contain phosphorus-based ligands. Since many of these catalysts are water and air sensitive, stable salicylaldimine and thiosemicarbazone Pd complexes [61–63] as well as ligand-free Pd catalysts were developed. The added advantage of these catalysts is that they can be conveniently synthesized from inexpensive starting materials with satisfactory yields."
10,Mizoroki-Heck reaction,"10.1 Mizoroki-Heck reaction Mizoroki [64] and Heck [65] independently reported Pd(II) mediated arylation of olefins. The classical Heck reaction involves the Pd-catalyzed substitution of a vinylic hydrogen with a vinyl, aryl or benzyl group. Typical catalysts used were [Pd(PPh3)4] and Pd(OAc)2 / PPh3. In 2004, Dimitra et al., [66] first evaluated the thiosemicarbazone-based complex for the Heck reaction. They synthesized Pd complex containing salicylaldehyde-N(4)-ethylthiosemicarbazone (26), and applied it as a catalyst for the Heck reaction of aryl bromides with styrene in the absence of any promoting additives (Fig. 13). The catalysis was performed under inert atmosphere as well as air. Trans-stilbenes were the major products (92–96 %) with traces of cis-stillbenes and 1,1-diphenyl ethylene. The complex was stable under Ar atmosphere, and underwent only partial decomposition in air at very high temperature. In both the atmospheres, the catalyst showed good selectivity towards trans-stillbenes. Mono and binuclear Ni complexes bearing salicylaldehyde-based TSCs (27–29) were synthesized, and the catalytic property of [Ni(L)(PPh3)] (27), [Ni(L)(py)] (28) and binuclear [Ni2(L)2(bpy)] (29) complexes (where L = salicylaldehyde TSC, py = pyridine, bpy = 4,4′-bipyridine) (2 mol%) was evaluated towards Heck C–C cross-coupling reaction of butylacrylate with p-haloacetophenone / p-halobenzaldehyde / p-haloacetonitrile (Fig. 14) [67]. It was interesting that > 99 % conversion was obtained at significantly shorter time when p-iodoacetophenone was taken as substrate in presence of [Ni2(L)2(bpy)]. On comparing the catalytic efficiencies, binuclear TSC complex showed greater efficiency than the mononuclear counterparts. The catalytic activity of these Ni-TSC complexes though not remarkably high compared to Pd-TSC complexes, was found to be comparable with the reported systems [68–71]. Binuclear Pd(II) terephthalaldehyde bis(TSC) complex with bromide and triphenylphosphine as ancillary ligands (Fig. 15) was used as a catalyst for the Heck reaction under optimized conditions (DMF, K2CO3, 100 οC). The cross-coupling reaction of activated and deactivated aryl bromides with a variety of vinylic substrates selectively yielded trans products [72]. The new Pd-TSC complex (30) acted as a highly efficient homogeneous catalyst (0.01 mol%) for the Mizoroki-Heck reactions of aryl bromides with various olefinic substrates (yield = 60–98 %). It is also an efficient catalyst for the cross-coupling of activated aryl chlorides with olefins (38–44 %). The same kind of reactions were carried out with Ni(II) naphthaldehyde TSC complex (31) as catalyst (Fig. 15) [73]. Even though the Pd-TSC complexes showed five to six fold higher TON than their Ni analogues, Ni-TSC complexes also exhibited reasonable activity compared to the previously reported Ni(II) complexes."
11,Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling,"10.2 Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, the cross-coupling of aryl halides with organoboronic acids, is one of the most significant Pd-catalyzed reactions in both academic and industrial research. This is the most widely used process for the synthesis of diaryls, diaryl ketones and diaryl ethers [53,54]. Kostos and co-workers [74] used phosphine-free Pd-TSC complexes (32 and 33) (Fig. 16) for the first time as catalysts (1 mM) for the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides with phenyl boronic acid to get biaryls under aerobic condition using Na2CO3 as a base at 100 οC. When the reaction was performed using a 1:1000 M ratio of catalyst and aryl halide, the substrates like deactivated 4-bromoanisole and non-activated bromobenzene gave conversions in the range 40–71 %. In the cases of activated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene and 4-bromobenzonitrile, the conversions were ≥ 80 %. At a 1:100000 M ratio of catalyst and substrate, TONs up to 49,000 was obtained with lower conversions. Aryl chloride substrates yielded 30–32 % of corresponding biaryls under aerobic condition. The catalyst was found to be air stable at 100 οC, no palladium black was formed and homo coupling of phenylboronic acid to form unsubstituted biphenyl was negligible. The synthesis of Pd β-d-glucopyranosyl TSC binuclear complex (34) and its catalytic activity (0.1 mol%) towards Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling were reported by Tenchiu et al. [75]. On comparing the catalytic efficiency of this complex with their previously reported salicylaldehyde TSC Pd(II) complex (Fig. 16), the conversions were higher for the carbohydrate derived TSC complex over salicylaldehyde TSC complex. For instance, 69 % versus 53 % for 4-bromoanisole, 99 % versus 88 % for 4-bromobenzonitrile and 98 % versus 83 % for 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. But β-d-glucopyranosyl TSC complex displayed very low conversions (4–12 %) for aryl chloride substrates compared to salicylaldehyde TSC and other carbohydrate-derived TSC complexes in which triphenylphosphine was also coordinated to Pd. Paul et al., [76] reported the synthesis of five different square planar Pd-TSC complexes from the reaction of 4-R-benzaldehyde TSC (R = OCH3, CH3, H, Cl or NO2) (35–39) with trans-[Pd(PPh3)2Cl2]. Similar reaction of these TSC ligands with Na2[PdCl4] afforded a family of bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes (40–44). All these complexes (Fig. 16) were tested as catalysts in the Suzuki cross-coupling of phenylboronic acid and p-bromoacetophenone. The substrates with strong electron-donating or strong electron-withdrawing group showed a high product yield and remarkable turn over number. The cross-coupling reactions took place even at room temperature in presence of the first series of Pd-TSC complexes and it is worth to mention that these complexes (0.5 mol%) catalyzed cross-coupling in water (solvent or co-solvent) with almost 100 % yield (TON = 100). On comparing the catalytic efficiency of the first series of Pd-TSC complexes with bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes, even though the later complexes were found to exhibit lower catalytic efficiency towards the Suzuki cross-coupling, the magnitude of difference was small. The Pd(II) complexes containing TSCs of 2-formylpyridine, 2-acetylpyridine and 2-benzoylpyridine (45–47) (Fig. 16) were employed as catalysts (0.001 mol%) for the Suzuki cross-coupling to produce biaryls. All of which afforded the expected C–C coupled products in excellent yields with high and less common (∼105) turnover numbers for aryl iodide substrates. The C–C cross-couplings of aryl chlorides proceeded smoothly, but with much higher catalytic loadings and slightly harsh reaction condition [77]. An air and moisture-stable Pd(II) complex bearing pyridoxal appended TSC ligand (48) (Fig. 16) was synthesized and used as a potential catalyst for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of several aryl halides under optimized condition. When 1:1000 catalyst-substrate ratio was employed, the percentage conversion of aryl halides to biaryls was observed to be greater for aryl iodides and aryl bromides. As for as the life time of the catalyst and level of reusability are concerned, the first reaction afforded the corresponding cross-coupling product in 96 % conversion, and the conversion for the 2nd cycle was nearly 89 %. However, in the 3rd cycle, it was reduced to 78 %. The conversion was significantly dropped to 32 % in the fourth cycle. Thus, this catalyst could be used for at least 3 times, which is fairly good for a homogenous system [78]. Four different cyclopalladated TSC complexes (49–52) (Fig. 16) were evaluated for their ability to catalyze (0.5 mol%) a series of Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. They efficiently catalyzed the cross-coupling of phenylboronic acid with different aryl bromides irrespective of the type of substituent (electron-withdrawing or electron-donating) with yield between 70 and 99 % [79]. A family of mixed ligand mono- and dinuclear nickel complexes (53–58) was synthesized from TSCs of salicylaldehyde, 2-hydroxyacetophenone and 2-hydroxynaphthaldehyde on reaction with Ni(ClO4)2⋅6H2O, using 2,2′-bipyridine or 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine as co-ligands (Fig. 17). Though both the di- and mononuclear complexes could successfully catalyze (2 mol%) the Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, the catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear complexes was much better [80]. A microwave promoted Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling catalyzed by a Pd complex with salicylaldehyde N(4)-hexamethyliminyl TSC (59) under aerobic condition was reported (Fig. 16). In contrast to other TSC complexes, this complex was inactive (1 mM) towards the Suzuki cross-coupling by conventional heating. On the other hand, microwave irradiation promoted the catalysis with TON up to 37,000. Under microwave irradiation, the metal was bonded to two thiosemicarbazone moieties through four intramolecular hydrogen bonds (2 N–H---O and 2 C−H---S), and this results in an inhibition of the addition of halide to the metal during the catalytic cycle [81]. Recently, Prabhakaran and co-workers [82] developed two (mono- and tetranuclear) types of Pd(II) complexes containing 3-acetyl-7-methoxycoumarin TSC ligands (60–63), and structures of complexes (Fig. 16) were determined using spectroscopic and single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. Single crystal XRD studies of a tetranuclear complex revealed that TSCs coordinated to Pd ion through N, S, O and C (C4 of the coumarin). These complexes (especially tetranuclear complex with methyl substitution) exhibited good catalytic activity (0.00125 mmol) in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with good conversion for the cross-coupling of phenylboronic acids with various aryl halides or heterocyclic (chloroquinoline and its derivatives) halides in an aqueous medium (ethanol–water mixture). Recently, same research group synthesized one tetranuclear Pd catalyst containing 6-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxaldehyde-4(N)-phenyl TSC ligand (64) for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between chloroquinoline derivatives and phenylboronic acid [83]. This cross-coupling reaction gave unexpected C-alkoxylated compounds in good yield (98 %) instead of C-arylated compounds in the alcoholic medium (Fig. 16)."
12,Sonogashira reaction,"10.3 Sonogashira reaction This is the most efficient method of preparation of conjugated enynes / aryl alkynes which have applications in natural product chemistry, pharmaceuticals and materials science, from the reaction of vinyl/aryl halides with terminal alkynes in presence of a Pd catalyst, CuI and base [52,84–86]. Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction works very well in presence of Pd and Ni-TSC complexes (35–44 and 65–68) (Table 1) and organic bases such as triethylamine, pyridine or piperidine, or inorganic bases like NaOH, KOH, etc. [76,87,88]."
13,Kumada-Corriu cross-coupling,"10.4 Kumada-Corriu cross-coupling Mono and binuclear Ru(II)- [89,90], Ru(III)- [91,92] and Ni(II)- [93] TSC complexes with or without PPh3 as ancillary ligand were used as catalysts (69–73) for the synthesis of biaryls by the Kumada-Corriu cross-coupling reaction. It has been observed that the Ni-TSC complexes were highly active towards Kumuda cross-coupling, and the yield of the product was high compared to the yield of biaryls obtained from the reactions catalyzed by Ru(II) and Ru(III)-TSC complexes (Table 2). Since the potentiality of the catalysts is directly related to their ability to generate corresponding active species, low catalytic activity may be attributed to the fact that the active species derived from ruthenium complexes were less stable in the case of cross-coupling reactions."
14,Summary,"In the last two decades, transition metal complexes containing TSC ligands were proved to be active catalysts for several organic transformations apart from their potential biological activities. Ru(II)- and Ru(III)-TSC complexes were utilized as catalysts for TH of carbonyl compounds. The catalytic activity of these complexes towards TH of EWG/EDG-substituted carbonyl compounds was excellent over unsubstituted ones. N-arylation of imidazole and Buckwald-Hartwig amination reactions using various aryl halides were carried out in presence of Pd(II)-TSC complexes as catalysts. Although the N-arylated products were not readily formed from aryl halides with electron-rich group, it was observed that the yields were moderate to good compared to those obtained from unsubstituted and electron-deficient group attached aryl halides. Ru-TSC complexes showed an excellent conversion in the oxidation of primary / secondary alcohols to corresponding aldehydes / ketones. In cyclopropanation of olefines, Cu-TSC complexes exhibited remarkable catalytic capability towards decomposition of carbene source i.e., ethylene diazoacetate (EDA), and the subsequent transfer of carbene moiety to CC bond. Dioxomolybdenum(IV)-, and mononuclear and binuclear oxovanadium(V)-TSC complexes were tested as catalysts for homogeneous olefin epoxidation using tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) as an oxidant. The cycloalkenes such as cyclohexene provided epoxide in an excellent yield compared to aliphatic olefines and conjugated aromatic substrates like styrene. Ru(II)- and Cu(II)-TSC catalytic systems were not only efficient towards various fundamental reactions such as N-alkylation of amines, amidation of alcohols and hydration of nitriles, but also reusable for number of cycles without change in percentage conversion of reactants in many reactions. Several Pd(II)- and Ni(II)-TSC complexes showed pronounced catalytic activities towards C–C and C−heteroatom cross-coupling reactions, which were comparable with those of phosphine-based and ligand-free Pd compounds. Owing to easy preparation and cheaper precursors, many transition metal-TSC complexes can be prepared in future, and these can be explored as catalysts in many important organic transformations for medicinal applications. Advantageously, catalytic activity of this system can be tuned to arrive efficient catalysts by changing the substituents in TSC. In spite of these values, not many reviews focused on the catalytic potentials of TSC-based metal complexes. Hence, this review would be useful to those who intend to design TSC-based catalytic systems."
