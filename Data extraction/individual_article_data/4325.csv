0,Introduction,"The global energy consumption continues to increase in keeping up with increasing industrialization and improving quality of life. Fossil fuels are currently our main sources of energy, but renewable energy carriers including biofuels have been receiving increasing attention [1,2]. Biofuels include mainly bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, and biomass. Displacing a part of the fossil fuels with renewable biofuels has the potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and improve the environmental quality [3–6]. All biofuels represent energy captured from sunlight. More specifically, photosynthesizing microorganisms and higher plants capture sunlight and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water to biochemicals. Some of these biochemicals may be used directly as fuels. In other cases, they may serve as feedstock for making fuels either through the action of other microorganisms [7] or via chemical processes. For example, starch and cellulose produced via photosynthesis may be converted into bioethanol through the action of non-photosynthesizing microorganisms. Similarly, photosynthetically-produced biomass and oils can be converted into fuels such as biodiesel and gasoline using chemical technologies. Microbial biomass generated via photosynthesis may eliminate the need for arable land for fuel production and, hence, reduce potential impact of biofuels on production of food and fodder [8,9]. Production of biofuels through microbial photosynthesis and microbial bioconversion of an organic feedstock can be greatly improved by genetic and metabolic enhancements of the relevant microorganisms. Traditionally, microbial strains for industrial applications have been improved by selection, random mutagenesis and screening processes [10,11]. However, these processes are largely uncontrolled, slow, and unpredictable. In some cases, it may be impossible to obtain a desired phenotype through mutagenesis and selection if the relevant biochemistry is missing in a microorganism [12]. Therefore, the enhancement of microorganisms for various purposes increasingly relies on rational engineering including genetic and metabolic engineering [12,13]. Genetic and metabolic engineering are being used to modify the surfaces of the cells to display novel proteins and other substances for improving biocatalytic capability of the cells [14,15]. For example, microorganisms displaying specific enzymes on the surface may improve enzymatic conversion of starch into sugars for fermentation to fuel alcohols. Moreover, surface display of desired proteins in engineered cells allows easy reproduction of the displayed biocatalyst and easy separation of the product from the catalyst [16,17]. Cells displaying a suite of the relevant surface enzymes and having the relevant intracellular metabolic pathways could greatly improve the ability to convert certain feedstocks to biofuels. Metabolic engineering can provide microorganisms with improved titers and yields of products; with the capacity to use an expanded range of carbon substrates; and with the ability to better withstand high titers of potentially toxic products and adverse environmental conditions [18]. Specific biochemical pathways can be enhanced by manipulating the production and regulation of specific enzymes and deletion of pathways that may be counterproductive. Entirely new metabolic pathways taken from one microorganism may also be engineered into a superior host organism [14]. Overall, metabolic engineering allows precise modification of microbial species without causing an accumulation of unfavorable mutations [14]. Metabolic engineering together with genetic engineering are among core technologies for enhanced production microbial biofuels. Continuing developments in synthetic biology, genetic engineering and manipulation of enzyme expression allows biofuel-producing pathways to be inserted in a microbial host [19]. This review discusses some of the metabolic engineering approaches used in production of main types of biofuels including bioethanol, biobutanol, other alcohols, biodiesel, and biohydrogen. Developments in fuel production using engineered cyanobacteria, other bacteria, microalgae, and yeasts are discussed. The prospects of the use of system metabolic engineering for generating superior biofuel-producers strains are assessed."
1,Metabolic engineering for biofuels production,"Product diversity, yield, concentration, and productivity may be enhanced in metabolically-engineered microorganisms for enhanced fuel production [20–22]. Moreover, downstream recovery of a certain biofuel may also be simplified through metabolic engineering. Furthermore, the cost of fuel production may be reduced by engineering microorganisms to use cheap substrates [23]. Some metabolic pathways and other routes used in microbial production of fuel precursors and common fuels are summarized in Fig. 1 [24,25]."
2,Bacteria,"2.1 Bacteria Numerous bacteria are able to convert various substrates into fuels such as biohydrogen, bioalcohols, and biogas. Novel bacteria with enhanced production potential for fuels are continually being sought from nature, in particular from thermophilic environments. Recent advances in the use of bacteria for producing alcohols and hydrogen are discussed in the following sections. Methanogenic archaea and production of biogas have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [26–31]. 2.1.1 Bioethanol 2.1.1.1 Zymomonas mobilis Bioethanol is the most commonly produced biofuel and is used as an additive to gasoline. Owing to its clean burning characteristics, fuel ethanol can significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide [32]. The anaerobic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis is perhaps the best known native producer of bioethanol [33,34]. Compared to yeasts, Z. mobilis more efficiently converts glucose to bioethanol, but cannot naturally use most other sugars. Z. mobilis and the classical ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae both share a natively-expressed homoethanol pathway. However, they differ in terms of their glycolysis; S. cerevisiae uses the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway while Z. mobilis uses the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway [35]. The ED pathway is 50% more efficient than the EMP pathway leading to less ATP consumption during the ethanologenic process. In addition, Z. mobilis is capable of consuming glucose faster than S. cerevisiae apparently because of its high cell specific surface area. These factors collectively result in a higher ethanol productivity in Z. mobilis in comparison with S. cerevisiae [36]. Ethanol production is mainly controlled by the PET operon encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. On a given amount of glucose, Z. mobilis generally produces less biomass than yeast [34] and this is considered an advantage. In addition to ethanol, other byproducts may also be produced [36]. The inability of Z. mobilis to convert pentose sugars to ethanol is its main drawback as cheap pentose sugars are abundantly available in lignocellulosic feedstocks. This problem has been recently addressed by metabolic engineering of pentose utilization capability in Z. mobilis [37]. Ethanol production using this technology is being commercialized by DuPont. A recombinant Z. mobilis strain TMY-HFPX with multiple improved characteristics was developed and shown to achieve an ethanol concentration of up to 136g/L in a solution containing 295g/L glucose (90% of theoretical yield) without requiring exogenous amino acids and vitamins [38]. The enhanced strain reportedly harbored multiple gene modules, i.e., the xylA/xlyB/tktA/talB operon for xylose utilization, the metB/yfdZ operon for lysine and methionine biosynthesis, the thioesterase gene tesA to enhance free fatty acid biosynthesis for increasing ethanol tolerance, a proton-buffering peptide operon for acid stress tolerance, and a small heat shock protein operon for heat stress tolerance [38]. 2.1.1.2 Escherichia coli The bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis have been most widely used to construct ethanol producing strains because the molecular biology of these microorganisms is well understood. They are capable of utilizing diverse substrates and are amenable to metabolic engineering for exclusive production of ethanol [39–44]. E. coli was probably the first microorganism to be successfully modified for ethanol production through metabolic engineering [45]. This initial success was further built upon by introducing the relevant foreign genes in E. coli and disrupting pathways for competing products. Thus, the E. coli W (wild) was transformed into E. coli KO11, a novel strain capable of producing ethanol [33]. E. coli KO11 contained genes from Z. mobilis for encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase (PET operon). In addition, the gene for production of fumarate reductase was deleted. E. coli KO11 was successfully adapted to produce ethanol at nearly 95% of the theoretical yield in a complex medium and showed increased ethanol tolerance relative to the original host. However, this strain was unable to grow in ethanol concentration of 3.5% and required complex nutritional supplements which contributed to the cost of ethanol production [33]. In a different investigation, ethanol tolerance of the strain KO11 was increased by 10% by adaptive evolution and selection through long term exposure to media supplemented with increasing ethanol content. The adapted strain was LY01. However, both LY01 and its parent KO11 required complex nutritional supplements and this added to the expenses of ethanol production. Therefore, E. coli KO11 was further engineered to strain SZ110 to allow ethanol production in less nutritionally-demanding media [45]. The strain SZ110 was engineered by eliminating lactate dehydrogenase gene and inserting pyruvate formate lyase and PET operon from Z. mobilis [33]. Further engineering of SZ110 by transposon-mediated mutagenesis and metabolic evolution provided the strain LY168 [46]. First, the transposon containing promoterless pdc, adhA, and adhB genes were randomly inserted into the chromosome of SZ110. Functional selections were subsequently performed by serial transfers in mineral salts media without antibiotics [47]. Eventually, the combination of genetic engineering and long term adaptation resulted in microbial biocatalysts that produced up to 45g ethanol/L in 48h in a simple mineral salts medium. Overall, the strain LY168 successfully grew and produced ethanol in media containing only mineral salts, a high concentration of sugar and the osmoprotectant betaine. The strain LY168 could reportedly produce 0.5g ethanol/g xylose, or close to the maximum theoretical yield of 0.51, in a minimal medium provided with betaine [33]. The key difference between the strains LY168 and KO11 was how the expression of the homoethanol pathway was regulated. In strain KO11, the Z. mobilis pdc and adb genes were regulated by pfl promoter with multiple layers of transcriptional control, while in strain LY168, the genes encoding the homoethanol pathway were integrated within the gene encoding 23S ribosomal RNA subunit rrlE, concurrent with the direction of transcription. Recently, the glycolytic pathway of E. coli KO11 was engineered by knocking out phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi) to channel carbon flux from glucose through the Entner–Doudoroff (ED-P) and pentose phosphate (PP-P) pathways to lactate and acetate production [48]. However, the engineered strain grew quite slowly under non-aerated conditions in minimal media containing 40g/L glucose. To improve KO11 Δpgi's capacity to grow, the recombinant strain was evolved for 60 days and renamed KO11 E35. Compared with its parental strain KO11, the KO11 E35 had higher activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the ED-P enzymes. Subsequently, KO11 E35 was further improved by deleting the pta, ack, and ldh genes leading to a homoethanologenic derivative called KO11 PPAL strain. This strain possessed specific ethanol production rates similar to those achieved by KO11, but diverted less glucose to biomass production. This led to larger yields of ethanol on glucose and biomass. These improved characteristics were ascribed to the strain's capability to channel most of the carbon flux from pyruvate to ethanol as well as increased expression of heterologous pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from Z. mobilis [48]. In a different study, the homoethanol producer E. coli SE2378 (Δldh Δpfl) was obtained via mutagenesis and had an ethanol productivity of 2.24g/(h g-cells) at nearly 80% of the theoretical ethanol yield [46]. Another homoethanol producer E. coli SZ420 (ΔfrdBC Δldh ΔackA ΔfolA-pfl ΔpdhR::pflBp6-aceEF-lpd) was made by deleting the competing fermentation pathways in E. coli B and enabling overexpression of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (aceEF-lpd, a typical aerobically-expressed operon) under anaerobic conditions [47]. SZ420 could convert xylose to ethanol at nearly 90% of the theoretical yield [47]. Adaptive evolution of nontransgenic E. coli KC01 (ldhA pflB ackA frdBC pdhR::pflBp6-aceEF-lpd) to obtain a homoethanol producer was also reported [49]. The resulting bacterium converted xylose to ethanol with 94% of theoretical yield [49]. As discussed above, E. coli is attractive for metabolic engineering for fuel production owing to the fact that its metabolic pathways are easily deleted or replaced. However, from a bioprocessing point of view, ethanol production using engineered E. coli has limitations in comparison with eukaryotic production systems. E. coli can be highly susceptible to phage infection and the utility of its spent biomass is limited in view of enteric origins [50]. 2.1.1.3 Bacillus subtilis Construction of B. subtilis BS35 was reported through disruption of the native lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene (ldh) by chromosomal insertion of the Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (adhB) under the control of the ldh native promoter [43]. The BS35 reportedly produced ethanol and butanediol, but the rates of cell growth and glucose consumption were reduced by 65–70% in comparison with the wildtype. BS35 was further modified to BS36 (BS35 ΔalsS) by eliminating the butanediol production pathway. This increased the ethanol yield to 89% of the theoretical value, but rates of cell growth and glucose consumption still remained low. The strain BS37 (BS35 ΔalsS udhA +) was then developed from BS35 by inactivation of alsS through chromosomal integration of E. coli transhydrogenase gene (udhA). BS37 showed ethanol titers of up to 8.9g/L in long-term cultivation [44]. 2.1.1.4 Thermophilic bacteria An important problem with mesophilic bacteria such as E. coli and B. subtilis is their poor ability to hydrolyze carbohydrate polymers, poor tolerance to extreme pH values, and inability to withstand high salt concentrations [7]. Therefore, bioprocesses based on these microorganisms are easily contaminated with other unwanted species, making them poorly suited for use in large-scale production operations. Although bioethanol is commercially produced from sugars such as sucrose and starch hydrolysates derived from food crops [51,52], this form of production competes with food supply and arable land for production of food and fodder [53]. Therefore, processes capable of using non-food lignocellulosic biomass as a source of sugars for making ethanol are highly desirable. While ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass is possible, it requires expensive pretreatment of the biomass to release fermentable sugars [54]. Hence, microorganisms with the ability to hydrolyze lignocellulosic materials and simultaneously convert the produced sugars into ethanol are of interest. Genetically engineered thermophilic bacteria are likely to be most useful in this context [34]. A thermophilic operation has the potential to not only enhance the rate of biomass hydrolysis and fermentation of sugars into ethanol, but also to reduce the potential of contamination of the fermentation process by unwanted microbes. Genetically engineered thermophilic bacteria have been extensively investigated for production of ethanol as summarized in Table 1. 2.1.2 Butanol and higher alcohols Microbial production of primary higher alcohols such as 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and other linear-chain fatty alcohols has been widely investigated [63]. Butanol, a four carbon primary alcohol (C4H10O), is considered to be superior to ethanol as a fuel because of its higher energy density, lower vapor pressure, and being less hygroscopic and corrosive [64–67]. Moreover, due to relative similarity of its properties to gasoline, it is well compatible with the currently in-place gasoline infrastructure [68]. Therefore, butanol and other higher alcohols have the potential to directly substitute gasoline. Unmodified gasoline car engines fueled with pure butanol have successfully operated over long periods [69]. Butanol is traditionally produced via the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, one of the first large-scale industrial fermentation processes [70]. Member of the bacterial genus Clostridium have been widely investigated as natural producers of butanol [68,71]. However, metabolic engineering of clostridial strains is challenging due to a complex metabolic regulation system and difficulties in their genetic manipulation [72]. In addition to clostridial strains, genetically engineered E. coli strains are also increasingly attracting attention as butanol producers [73,74]. 2.1.2.1 Clostridium sp Fermentative production of butanol by Clostridium sp. involves two distinct phases of acidogenesis and solventogenesis [75]. In the acidogenic phase, cells grow and convert the substrate to acetic and butyric acids and, therefore, during this phase pH declines to below 5. In the solventogenesis, the organic acids are transformed into acetone, butanol, and ethanol in the ratio of 3:6:1 [66,68]. Acetone and ethanol are inevitable byproducts of a conventional ABE fermentation. The metabolic engineering of clostridia has been attempted with a focus on selective overproduction of butanol to increase its yield and reduce the cost of removing the unwanted byproducts. This has mainly involved the use of integrative plasmids to inactivate the key genes of the biosynthetic pathways of unwanted byproducts [76,77]. Also, as n-butanol is extremely toxic to host cells, a lot of effort has focussed on developing more robust strains through metabolic engineering or mutagenesis approaches [68]. Clostridium acetobutylicum M5, a derivative of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, is basically incapable of producing butanol due to a loss of the megaplasmid pSOL1 [78]. This bacterium was later engineered to achieve enhanced butanol production [76,77,79]. For instance, overexpression of the adhE1 gene under the control of the ptb promoter led to butanol production of up to 0.84g butanol/g ABE. This was much higher than ∼0.6g butanol/g ABE produced by wildtype clostridia. A different production enhancement approach involved the disruption of the adc gene encoding acetoacetate decarboxylase in C. acetobutylicum which enhanced selective production of butanol to 0.82g butanol/g ABE in a medium supplemented with methyl viologen. Harris et al. metabolically engineered C. acetobutylicum PJC4BK and claimed a butanol concentration of up to 16.7g/L compared with 11.7g/L for wildtype C. acetobutylicum [80]. The PJC4BK was made by disruption of the buk gene encoding butyrate kinase, the enzyme involved in butyrate formation pathway [81]. Final butanol titer can also be increased by using other methods such as enhancing the product tolerance in a microorganism through construction of mutants [82]. For instance, Tomas et al. used overexpression of the molecular chaperone GroESL to enhance the activity of the solventogenic enzymes, increase butanol tolerance and eventually boost the final butanol titer [83]. Major achievements in clostridial 1-butanol production have been recently reviewed by Moon et al. [72]. 2.1.2.2 E. coli Solventogenic clostridia are strict anaerobes and grow slowly compared with other commonly known aerobic bacteria [12]. This adversely impacts the economics of butanol production by the conventional ABE fermentation. Furthermore, genetic manipulation of Clostridium sp. has proven to be difficult and this has shifted the focus towards engineering the clostridial fermentative pathway in bacteria such as E. coli [74,84] and B. subtilis [11,85,86] for butanol production. In an effort by Atsumi et al., a functional butanol biosynthesis pathway was reconstructed in E. coli by introducing the thl, hbd, crt, bcd, etfAB and adhE2 genes from C. acetobutylicum [73]. This allowed a butanol titer of 139mg/L to be attained under anaerobic conditions [73]. In another study, a metabolically-engineered E. coli harboring the thiL, crt, bcd, etfAB, hbd, and adhE2 genes of C. acetobutylicum produced 1.2g/L of butanol from 40g/L glucose [87]. Despite these achievements, a major bottleneck to further improvements in butanol production remains the lack of sufficient understanding of how the metabolic shift from acid to solvent production is regulated at the molecular level. The relevant inducing signals, the regulators and their interactions, and the connections among the regulatory networks are poorly understood [88–90]. 2.1.2.3 Other bacteria Other bacteria including Corynebacterium glutamicum [91–94] and Ralstonia eutropha [95] have also been used to produce higher alcohols from 2-ketoacids, the metabolic intermediates of amino acid biosynthetic pathway. A C. glutamicum made by the deletion of the ilvE, aceE, and pqo genes encoding transaminase B, pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit E1, and pyruvate: quinone oxidoreductase, respectively, and by the overexpression of the ilvBNCD genes was shown to possess an elevated ability to produce isobutanol from glucose [92]. An engineered R. eutropha strain was confirmed to convert carbon dioxide to higher alcohols in an electromicrobial process [96] This process involved the use of electrical current in a specially designed bioreactor. The engineered bacterium could produce nearly 90mg/L of isobutanol and 50mg/L of 3-methyl-1-butanol using CO2 as the sole carbon source. Autolithotrophic bacteria such as R. eutropha can use electricity instead of hydrogen as source of electrons [96] and, therefore, may be promising for biofuel production processes if there is a net energy benefit. Table 2 summarizes the studies reported on production of biobutanol and higher alcohols by the use of metabolically-engineered microorganisms. The metabolic pathways involved in the production of higher alcohols are summarized in Fig. 2. 2.1.3 Biohydrogen Hydrogen burns cleanly leaving only water. It is therefore, believed to be a promising future fuel [119–122]. Metabolic engineering of bacteria for production of biohydrogen has received much attention, but commercial production does not seem to be viable at present. In bacteria, hydrogen may be produced by photofermentation and dark fermentation. Photoheterotrophic hydrogen production requires an organic carbon source as well as sunlight and is carried out by anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria such as the purple nonsulfur bacteria [123]. Nitrogenase is the key enzymes involved in the process and anaerobic conditions are required for hydrogen production [124,125]. The hydrogen production activity of nitrogenases tends to be low and the expression of these enzymes is repressed by ammonium ions [126,127]. Moreover, various other reactions competitively scavenge electrons from nitrogenase leading to reduced hydrogen yield and photochemical efficiency [124,128,129]. Biohydrogen production by dark fermentation of various substrates is mainly carried out by facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria [130]. Dark fermentation results in higher rates of hydrogen production relative to photofermentation [123,131]. Both mesophilic and thermophilic dark fermentation processes exist depending on the bacterial species involved. Both wildtype and metabolically-engineered bacteria have been studied for hydrogen production [125,126]. Mesophilic bacteria such as Clostridium butyricum, Enterobacter aerogenes, and E. coli have attracted particular attention [132–134]. Table 3 summarizes the studies conducted on hydrogen production using metabolically engineered bacteria. 2.1.3.1 E. coli Yoshida et al. reported on a genetically modified E. coli for hydrogen production by dark fermentation [135]. The bacterium was engineered by inactivating the formate-hydrogen lyase (FHL) repressor (hycA) and the negative regulator for FHL. In addition, the bacterium was modified to overexpress FHL and its activator genes (fhlA). The resulting organism showed a high volumetric hydrogen productivity of 300L H2/L/h in a high cell-density fermentation (93g biomass dry weight/L) with formate as the substrate. Subsequently, the bacterium was further modified through disruption of ldhA encoding lactate dehydrogenase and frdBC encoding fumarate dehydrogenase in attempts to improve hydrogen yield [136]. Using this strain, up to 1.82mol of hydrogen could be produced from 1.08mol of glucose. In another study, a combinatorial engineering of the FHL complex and carbon metabolism was implemented in E. coli to obtain improved hydrogen yield [137]. Disruption of the hycA gene enabled a 2-fold improvement in FHL activity. Subsequent deletion of two uptake hydrogenases (1, hya; and 2, hyb) improved hydrogen yield from 1.2 to 1.48mol/mol glucose confirming the critical impact of uptake hydrogenases on anaerobic fermentation of glucose. Disruption of multiple genes (ldhA, frdAB, hycA, hya, and hyb) further improved hydrogen yield on glucose to 1.8mol/mol despite a high partial pressure of hydrogen in the culture system. With a low partial pressure of hydrogen, the same multiple mutated strain produced 2.11mol H2/mol glucose [137]. This was a little higher than the theoretical maximum yield attainable with E. coli strains relying on the formate-dependent pathway. Following a similar approach, hydrogen yield in E. coli BW25113 ∆hyaB ∆hybC ∆hycA ∆fdoG/pCA24 N-FhlA was improved from 0.47 to 0.70mol H2/mol of glucose through overexpression of the FHL complex and inactivation of the uptake hydrogenases [138]. Seol et al. (2011) further produced genetically engineered recombinant E. coli SH5 with multiple deletion mutations in uptake hydrogenases (hya and hyb), hycA, and the carbon metabolic pathways (ldhA and frdAB) and claimed a hydrogen productivity of up to 2.4L H2/L/h [138]. A low yield of hydrogen on the carbon substrate is a general problem of fermentative hydrogen production. Co-production of ethanol and hydrogen has been proposed to overcome this. Pursuing this approach, Seol et al. developed E. coli BW25113 ΔhycA ΔhyaAB ΔhybBC ΔldhA ΔfrdAB Δpta-ackA ΔpfkA (designated as SH*_ZG) overexpressing zwf and gnd encoding the key enzymes in the pentose-phosphate (PP) pathway [139]. Although the resulting strain successfully co-produced ethanol (1.38mol/mol) and hydrogen (1.32mol/mol) from glucose, without acetate, the generation of pyruvate at a high rate of 0.18mol/mol apparently reduced the efficiency of the co-production [139]. Subsequently, Sekar et al. (2016) attempted to enhance the co-production rate of the strain SH*_ZG by eliminating pyruvate accumulation and overexpressing the zwf and gnd genes. They designated the new strain as SH9*_ZG. It co-produced H2 and ethanol at 1.88 and 1.40mol/mol, respectively, under anaerobic conditions [140]. 2.1.3.2 Thermophilic bacteria Success with metabolically-engineered mesophiles has led to renewed interest in engineering of thermophilic bacteria for hydrogen production [145–147]. The most common thermophilic hydrogen producers include Pyrococcus furiosus, Thermococcus kodakaraensis, and species of the genera Clostridium and Thermoanaerobacterium and the families Thermotoga and Caldicellulosiruptor [146,148–154]. For example, overexpression of [Fe]-hydrogenase (HydA) in Clostridium paraputrificum M-21 improved hydrogen yield on glucose from 1.4 to 2.4mol/mol [151]. Similarly in a different investigation, overexpression of HydA in C. tyrobutyricum JM1 increased hydrogen yield on glucose from 1.2 to 1.8mol/mol [141]. Liu et al. inactivated the ack gene encoding acetate kinase of C. tyrobutyricum and achieved a nearly 1.5-fold increase in hydrogen yield compared to the wildtype strain [143]. The above achievements notwithstanding, use of metabolic engineering requires an in-depth understanding of the often complex metabolic pathways and regulatory circuits involved in hydrogen production [123]."
3,Yeasts,"2.2 Yeasts Yeasts are promising hosts for production of industrial products and have been widely used for commercial production of recombinant enzymes and proteins [155]. The relatively large spheroidal cells of yeasts often simplify bioprocessing relative to many bacteria and mycelial fungi. Moreover, they can be grown at ambient temperature and have simple nutritional requirements. On the other hand, the ability of yeasts to thrive at low pH values helps in minimizing contamination at large scale industrial operations where rigorous sterilization of the media and bioreactor may not be feasible [156]. Unlike many bacteria, yeasts are relatively resistant to potential phage contaminations [156]. Capacity of yeasts for sexual reproduction provides opportunities for improving them through cellular engineering [157]. In view of the abovementioned characteristics, yeasts have attracted much attention as cell factories for production of biofuels, in particular bioethanol. The yeast S. cerevisiae has attracted special interest as it is perhaps the best known yeast with a long history of industrial use [156,157]. S. cerevisiae is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and many recombinant technologies have been developed for it [158]. Much of the sugarcane derived bioethanol in Brazil [51] and the corn starch hydrolysate-derived product in the United States [52] depends on yeasts for fermentation. Several recent reviews have provided an overview of the many metabolic engineering schemes that have been used in S. cerevisiae [159–165]. Some of the key developments relating to production of biofuels in S. cerevisiae are summarized in Table 4. Surface-engineered yeasts used for biofuels production are discussed in a separate section. 2.2.1 Bioethanol 2.2.1.1 S. cerevisiae The well-known yeast S. cerevisiae has been the mainstay of bioethanol production from sugars from the earliest times [174]. Compared to wildtype bacteria such as E. coli, yeasts better tolerate relatively high levels of alcohols although certain bacteria are also highly alcohol-tolerant. In view of its potential, much information exists on the biology, metabolism, and genetics of S. cerevisiae. This information has been used to improve strains for production of fuel ethanol. As a result, ethanol yield on sugars now often approaches the theoretical limit of 0.51g ethanol/g of glucose. Up to 93% of the glucose used may be converted to ethanol while the remainder is mostly converted to cell biomass [175]. Native S. cerevisiae can effectively use sugars but cannot use sugar polymers such as starch and cellulose to produce ethanol. Therefore, a prior hydrolysis of the sugar polymers is essential prior to use in yeast fermentation. However, this prior hydrolysis step adds to the cost of processing while a competitive fuel must essentially be extremely cheap. This has led to successful efforts to engineer a hydrolytic capability in S. cerevisiae so that polymeric substrates could be used directly [176]. S. cerevisiae engineered to surface display minicellulosomes has allowed simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of crystalline cellulose leading to an ethanol titer of 1.4g/L [177]. In other developments, S. cerevisiae was engineered to ferment sugars that it previously could not. For instance, Ha et al. reported an engineered strain capable of cofermenting mixtures of xylose and cellobiose with an ethanol productivity of nearly 0.65g/L/h [178]. Engineering of the abilities to ferment new sugars and hydrolyze extracellular sugar polymers have not remained confined to S. cerevisiae and other microorganisms with these capabilities have also been developed. A major by-product of ethanol fermentation is glycerol. Glycerol is required to maintain an osmotic balance in yeast cells. Deletion of gpd1 and gpd2, encoding cytosolic NADH-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, has reduced or completely eliminated the production of glycerol and allowed more carbon to be channeled to ethanol synthesis; however, such double deletion strains do not grow well anaerobically [175]. Much efforts has focussed on overcoming this problem [179]. 2.2.1.2 Native xylose-fermenting yeasts Genetic and metabolic engineering of native xylose fermenting yeasts such as Pichia stipites [180] and Spathaspora passalidarum [181] hold much promise. 2.2.1.3 Thermotolerant yeasts Use of thermotolerant yeasts offers important advantages in production of bioethanol [163,182–184] and these yeasts too can be further enhanced by metabolic engineering. The thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus ferments glucose to ethanol and can grow at nearly 50°C. In addition, K. marxianus can use a variety of substrates such as cellobiose, xylose, xylitol, arabinose, glycerol, lactose, and inulin. Hu et al. claimed that in ethanol production from inulin hydrolysates, K. marxianus provided a significantly higher ethanol yield than native S. cerevisiae [185]. The thermotolerant yeast P. kudriavzevii was reported to ferment cassava hydrolysate to ethanol at 40°C to achieve an ethanol concentration of 78.6g/L in about 24h [186]. Ethanol productivity of 3.28g/L/h with a yield of 85.4% of theoretical was reported for this process [186]. As the knowledge available on some of the lesser-known yeasts improves, they could be metabolically-engineered for much improved ethanol production processes than available now. 2.2.1.4 Halophilic yeasts Certain hydrolysates of sugar polymers are naturally high in salt and require suitably tolerant yeasts to ferment. For instance, hydrolysates of seaweed biomass contain high salt concentrations. A marine yeast (Candida sp.) has been shown to ferment polysaccharide-based seaweed hydrolysate to ethanol in the presence of 6.25–11.25% salt [187]. 2.2.1.5 Other yeasts The sugar alcohol glycerol is a byproduct of the processes used in biodiesel production. The yeast Pachysolen tannophilus was reportedly able to ferment glycerol [188]. A final ethanol titer of 17.5g/L was reported in a medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) crude glycerol as the substrate. This corresponded to 56% of the theoretical yield [188]. 2.2.2 Higher alcohols 2.2.2.1 S. cerevisiae As pointed out earlier, higher alcohols are more attractive as transport fuels compared with ethanol [189]. In this context biobutanol has generated the highest level of interest and microorganisms are being engineered for its production. A S. cerevisiae engineered to produce biobutanol from galactose achieved a titer of 2.5mg/L [117]. In a study by Chen et al., overexpression of genes in the valine pathway of S. cerevisiae enabled isobutanol production [171]. Brat et al. further improved the ethanol titer to 0.63g/L by relocating the valine biosynthetic enzymes into the cytosol [190]. In a different study, Kondo et al. genetically enhanced the Ehrlich pathway and altered the carbon flux in S. cerevisiae to achieve isobutanol titers as high as 0.143g/L [191]. Compartmentalization of the synthesis pathway in yeast mitochondria enabled titers of 0.64g/L for isobutanol together with 0.1g/L of isopentanol and 0.12g/L of 2-methyl-1-butanol [192]. All this suggests that yeasts can be successfully engineered to produce certain higher alcohols. Biobutanol production using metabolically engineered S. cerevisiae is already being commercialized by Gevo, Inc., in the United States. Sugars produced from starch or woody biomass by enzymatic hydrolysis are used as feedstock."
4,Cyanobacteria,"2.3 Cyanobacteria Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria previously known as blue-green algae, but are actually not algae at all as microalgae are microscopic photosynthetic eukaryotes. Cyanobacteria and microalgae are sunlight-driven cell factories that convert carbon dioxide and water to sugars and eventually to diverse biochemicals [193]. Many types of fuels and fuel precursors can be produced from microbial biomass grown via photosynthesis ( Fig. 3). As sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are often readily available, cyanobacteria and microalgae have attracted much attention for producing fuels and other products [194–200]. Continuing developments notwithstanding, there are many hurdles to commercialization of fuels from microalgae and cyanobacteria [201]. Cyanobacteria may have a higher photosynthetic efficiency compared to land plants [202]. Furthermore, cyanobacteria do not compete for land with terrestrial crops [203]. Being prokaryotes, cyanobacteria are structurally simpler than microalgae and unlike algae, can be genetically engineered relatively easily. In view of this, cyanobacteria are attracting attention as subjects for metabolic and genetic engineering [193]. More than 126 cyanobacterial genomes have been sequenced [204] and the necessary platforms for genetic manipulation of cyanobacteria have been established. Overall, the major foci of metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria include direct production, product secretion, and process optimization [200]. Metabolic engineering aspects of cyanobacteria have been extensively reviewed [195,205,206]. Studies have spanned production of biohydrogen [169,171,207–209], ethanol [207,210–213], isobutyraldehyde [214], isoprene [213,215], β-caryophyllene [226], sucrose [217], butanol [218], fatty alcohols [219,220], and fatty acids [221,222]. Biofuels and other chemicals produced in metabolically-engineered cyanobacteria are summarized in Table 5. 2.3.1 Biohydrogen Many studies have reported biohydrogen production using cyanobacteria [126,233–237]. The electrons released in the primary reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis can be directly channeled to hydrogen production [237]. More specifically, hydrogen production in cyanobacteria occurs via two pathways: 1) as a byproduct of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacterial nitrogenases; and 2) through the action of bidirectional (or reversible) hydrogenases [205]. Hydrogen production via nitrogenases requires ATP whereas bidirectional hydrogenases do not require ATP and therefore, they are more efficient for hydrogen production [238]. Nevertheless, both these routes are challenging in practice for commercially-viable production despite the claimed advantages of cyanobacterial hydrogen production relative to the other microbial producers [237]. Although diverse cyanobacteria are reportedly able to produce hydrogen under various culture conditions, Anabaena spp. are particularly good producers (e.g. 68 μmol H2/mg chl-a/h) [234]. Novel hydrogen producing cyanobacteria are being sought. Culture strategies as well as genetic and metabolic engineering of specific cyanobacteria to improve hydrogen production are receiving much attention [239–242]. The main challenges faced by cyanobacterial hydrogen production are the oxygen sensitivity of the hydrogenase enzymes involved in the process and the generally low hydrogen productivity as consequence of the competition for electrons by other pathways [208,242]. Oxygen-free operation can be difficult as photosynthesis naturally evolves oxygen. Thus, there is an inherent incompatibility between oxygenic photosynthesis and hydrogen production. Protein engineering has been attempted to reduce oxygen sensitivity of hydrogenases as well as to increase the photosynthetic efficiency by truncating the light harvesting antenna size [208] In addition to the above-mentioned challenges, the availability of the reducing agents such as ferredoxin and NADPH is another bottleneck as these are needed also for other metabolic activities such as respiration [243]. Therefore, for enhancing hydrogen production, a part of the available electrons must be redirected to hydrogen producing enzymes and oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases must be engineered [205]. Both wildtype and engineered cyanobacteria are being extensively researched for hydrogen production. For instance, attempts are being made to eliminate pathways that consume reducing agents. Mutants of Synechococcus 7002 lacking lactate dehydrogenase have demonstrated 5-fold greater hydrogen production compared with the wildtype [242]. In a different investigation, Bandyopadhyay et al. described Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, a unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium with the ability to generate high levels of hydrogen (465 μmol H2/mg of chlorophyll h) in the presence of glycerol under aerobic conditions [244]. In addition to microbial engineering, novel bioprocesses involving temporal or spatial separation of aerobic photosynthesis and anoxic hydrogen production are being developed [245]. Notwithstanding these advances, cyanobacterial hydrogen production requires further improvement to become economically viable. 2.3.2 Bioethanol Starch produced by cyanobacteria may be hydrolyzed and fermented into bioethanol or longer chain alcohols using the same technology as employed with corn and cassava starch. Some cyanobacteria are naturally capable of fermenting the accumulated starch into ethanol and excreting the ethanol in the extracellular environment [243]. Ethanol production pathway in cyanobacteria involves an initial conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde through decarboxylation and this is followed by the reduction of the produced acetaldehyde to ethanol [193]. Ethanol can also be produced directly from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight in metabolically-engineered cyanobacteria. In general, dark fermentation (i.e. an absence of photosynthesis) is not a primary route of energy production in most cyanobacteria [243,246] and occurs at a limited rate [243]. Nevertheless, attempts have been made to increase the rate of natural dark fermentation through genetic modification. For instance, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was modified by inclusion of the coding sequences for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II from Z. mobilis [210]. These genes were reportedly expressed under the control of the cyanobacterial rbcLS operon promoter alone and also in combination with the E. coli lac promoter and the ethanol productivity of the transformed strain reached 54 nmol per OD730 unit/L/d [209]. Ethanol productivity could be further increased/(mg chl h) when the CI-PL temperature inducible promoter was used [212]. In another study, the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was transformed via a double homologous recombination system to integrate the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adh) genes from Z. mobilis into the cyanobacterial chromosome under the control of the strong light-driven psbAII promoter [211]. The ethanol productivity achieved using this engineered cyanobacterium was 5.2mmo per OD730 unit/L/d [211]. Increasing NADPH production was hypothesized to increase production of biomass and ethanol in cyanobacteria [247]. This hypothesis was proved by over expressing the endogenous zwf gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase of pentose phosphate pathway in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Overexpression of zwf led to increased NADPH production and a consequent increase in production of biomass and ethanol compared with the wild type under both autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions [247]. In one study, the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 was subjected to transformation by introducing the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase B (adhB) genes of Z. mobilis into its genome, but only one construct produced bioethanol at detectable levels [248]. 2.3.3 Higher alcohols Keto acid pathway offers a route to propanol and butanol. 2-Ketobutyrate is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of citramalate and citramalate synthase has been found in cyanobacteria [249,250]. Therefore, there is the possibility of producing propanol and butanol from 2-ketobutyrate in cyanobacteria. For instance, engineering of isobutanol biosynthetic pathway and overexpression of Rubisco in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 enabled an isobutyraldehayde productivity of 6230μg/L/h and an isobutanol productivity of 3000μg/L/h [214]. In a different study, Synechocystis PCC 6803 was genetically modified with the ispS gene of Pueraria montana leading to the production of isoprene [216]. Isoprene, a potential biofuel, is a hydrocarbon with higher energy content than ethanol and is easier to separate from an aqueous broth compared with ethanol. Some cyanobacteria naturally produce alkanes as well [250]. As pure hydrocarbons, alkanes are energy-rich potential fuels. This could open up new options for producing fuels in engineered cyanobacteria in the future."
5,Microalgae,"2.4 Microalgae Microalgae are photosynthetic cell factories capable of producing starch, oils, and other biochemicals [22]. Compared with higher plants, microalgae grow more rapidly as they utilize sunlight better. Therefore, microalgae have the potential to provide huge quantities of starch and oils for conversion to various types of fuels [251,252]. Microalgae with a modified keto acid pathway may be a promising platform for producing isobutanol as well [253,254]. Long chain alcohols (C5–C8) have also been successfully produced in microalgae by modifying the cells for overproduction of 2-keto acids, the intermediates of the amino acid biosynthesis [254,255]. These intermediates were later converted to butanol derivatives by the heterologous expression of 2-keto acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase [71,254]. In general, microalgae have attracted the most attention as producers of oils for fuels [8,197]. Oil productivity of microalgae is far greater than that of oil palm, one of the most productive commercial oil crops [256–260]. Moreover, microalgae can be grown on land which is not suitable for agriculture using seawater and brackish water. Their numerous advantages notwithstanding, commercialization of oil production from algae faces difficult challenges that are unlikely to be overcome in the short-term [201]. The costs of production of the biomass and its downstream processing are high [259]. Hence, economic viability of large-scale production of microalgae-based biofuels is questionable. Metabolic and genetic engineering are important to a future commercialization of algal fuels. Extensive effort is underway in these areas. The genomes of more than 30 microalgae have already been sequenced [259]. 2.4.1 Biodiesel Microalgae often produce some of the same triglyceride oils found in oil crops such as canola and sunflower. As such, the triglyceride component of the algal oil may be readily converted to biodiesel. As mentioned earlier, under suitable conditions, the oil content of microalgae can be as high as 30–70% of their dry biomass and this has been the source of interest in biodiesel derived from microalgae [8,261–265]. Much of the existing effort on large-scale production of algal oils has focused on native algae. Nonetheless, attempts are being made to metabolically engineer algae for an enhanced production capability. The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been the main focus of genetic and metabolic engineering work simply because its genome is known and it has a long history of use in research as a model alga. Genes associated with biosynthesis and accumulation of triglyceride oil in C. reinhardtii have been isolated and characterized to some level [266,267]. Because triacylglycerols (TAGs) are derived from either acylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) via a de novo pathway (acyl CoA-dependent pathway) or recycling of membrane lipids (acyl CoA-independent pathway), most of the metabolic engineering strategies have focused on manipulating the rate-limiting steps of these two pathways hoping to increase the metabolic flux for TAG production. For example, Li et al. claimed a 10-fold increase in the production of TAGs in a starchless mutant of Chlamydomonas by the inactivation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase [266]. The resulting mutant BAFJ5 lacked the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and accumulated up to 32.5% by weight of neutral lipids and 46.5% by weight of total lipids [268]. Many of the genes involved in lipid synthesis in microalgae have been subjected to both knockout and overexpression in order to understand their role and identify the most efficient strategies for increasing the lipid content of the biomass. The enzymes acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and type-II fatty acid synthase (FAS) have been reported to be the main rate-limiting enzymes in fatty acid synthesis pathway [259]. ACCase is involved in forming malonyl CoA from carboxylate acetyl CoA and FAS is involved in elongating fatty acid chains. Therefore, it may be possible to enhance lipid production rates by increasing the activity of these enzymes via genetic engineering [264]. In pursuing this approach, expression vectors containing the gene encoding ACCase have been constructed and a transformation protocol has been developed for overexpression of ACCase in Cyclotella cryptica and other algal species [269]. However, ACCase overexpression has not increased lipid content [270]. It may be that ACCase activity is a limiting step in lipid biosynthesis mainly in cells that normally do not store large amounts of lipids [254]. In an attempt to increase lipid production without affecting growth, the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was engineered by knockdown of a multifunctional lipase/phospholipase/acyltransferase [271]. The resultant strains had up to ∼3-fold lipid content relative to the wildtype during exponential growth. Metabolic engineering has also been used to alter the lipid profile in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum [272]. The engineered diatom produced TAG with increased levels of shorter chain length fatty acids (lauric acid, C12:0; myristic acid, C14:0) which are more desirable for biodiesel production [271]. The above improvements notwithstanding, economic production of microalgal biodiesel is unlikely in the near future. 2.4.2 Biohydrogen Like cyanobacteria, purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria, some dark fermenting microorganisms and microalgae can also be used to produce hydrogen [273–281]. Three pathways are known to exist for hydrogen production in microalgae ( Fig. 4). Two of these pathways require light while the third functions in the dark. Biohydrogen is appealing specially for electricity production by fuel cells [281]. In many cases hydrogen is naturally produced in microalgae as a secondary metabolite to balance the redox energetics [282,283]. Hydrogen production has been studied to various depths in C. reinhardtii [280,284,285], Scenedesmus obliquus [286–288], Chlorella fusca [281], Chlorella sp. [289,290], Chlorella vulgaris [291], Chlorella protothecoides [292], and Platymonas subcordiformis [293,294]. Although hydrogen is naturally produced in microalgae under suitable culture conditions and hydrogenase activity can be externally induced by adding DCMU (a PSII electron chain uncoupler), hydrogen production cannot be maintained together with active photosynthesis because oxygen inactivates hydrogenase [281]. Under suitable conditions, hydrogen production may be augmented by channeling the electron flux to hydrogenases so that protons are biocatalytically converted to hydrogen (2H+ + 2e− → H2). To achieve this in C. reinhardtii, Kruse et al. blocked the cyclic electron transfer around photosystem I to reduce diversion of electrons away from hydrogenases. This improved hydrogen production rate by 5- to 13-fold relative to the control under a range of conditions [278]. In a different investigation, Rumpel et al. enhanced hydrogen production rate by 5-fold by redirecting electrons from photosystem I to hydrogenases [295]. Similarly, expression of an exogenous ferredoxin from C. acetobutylicum in addition to the native ferredoxin of C. reinhardtii, led to an enhanced electron flow to the hydrogenase HydA via siphoning of electrons from the fermentation of internal reducing equivalents (such as glycogen) [296]. This enhanced hydrogen production by nearly 2-fold under light-dependent anoxic conditions [296]. A ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR)-downregulated mutant of C. reinhardtii had a 2.5-fold higher hydrogen production activity relative to the parent strain under sulfur deprivation [297]. Other similar approaches have also been reported [298]."
6,Cell surface engineering for biofuel processes,"Surface-engineered cells carry specific non-native proteins on their external surface. These surface proteins may extend from the plasma membrane through the cell wall, or they may be bound to the cell-surface components [16]. Surface displayed proteins are generally confined to particular domains on the surface of the cell. The yeast S. cerevisiae has a rigid cell wall which is about 200nm thick [299] and mainly consists of mannoproteins and β-linked glucans. The β-glucans rich layer occurs just above the plasma membrane [299]. Some of the proteins displayed on the surface of the yeast cells have secretion signal peptides at the N-terminal and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors at the C-terminal. Protein synthesis occurs in the cell and the resulting proteins are then translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and on to the Golgi apparatus. Subsequently, membrane-enclosed vesicles carry the protein from the Golgi to the plasma membrane [300]. GPI-anchored proteins are further moved to the exterior of the plasma membrane via the secretory pathway. They are then released from the plasma membrane by the action of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and transferred to the outermost surface of the cell wall [299]. Either a single protein or a cocktail of proteins may be surface-displayed [301]. The displayed protein may be a hydrolytic enzyme, for example, to breakdown a polymeric substrate such as lignocellulosic biomass into small molecules that can be taken up by the cell as substrate ( Fig. 5). Multiple displayed proteins may act synergistically to carry out a certain extracellular transformation before the product of such a transformation is internalized by the cell [299,301]."
7,Yeasts and other microorganisms,"3.1 Yeasts and other microorganisms Engineered microbial cells armed with surface-displayed bioactive proteins are potentially powerful biocatalysts for production of biofuels and other products [302]. Surface display technologies were initially established for phages and bacteria [26,301] and have since been applied more broadly. Numerous proteins and peptides have been successfully displayed with retention of their bioactivity [16]. Simultaneous display of multiple types of molecules on the same cell has become possible to greatly expand the usefulness of the surface-engineered microorganisms [15]. Compared to most bacteria, yeasts offer a larger surface for display and are easier to recover from a broth after use. Among yeasts, surface arming was first developed in S. cerevisiae. Subsequently, similar display systems were used to transform other yeasts, including Pichia pastoris [303] and Yarrowia lipolytica [304]. With suitably displayed enzymes capable of hydrolyzing extracellular sugar polymers to simple sugars, a yeast can use substrates that it could not previously use. Such surface displayed yeasts allow consolidation into a single operation the otherwise separate steps of polymer hydrolysis and sugar fermentation (Fig. 5). This kind of consolidated bioprocessing is certain to greatly improve the economics of conversion of lignocellulosic substrates to ethanol [305]. Direct production of ethanol from starch involving combined saccharification-fermentation steps and surface engineered yeast has been shown to work. The biocatalyst used was S. cerevisiae with exo glucoamylase (a starch-degrading enzyme) of Rhizopus oryzae displayed on its surface [306,307]. The production efficiency of ethanol from starch was further enhanced by co-displaying of exo glucoamylase and endo α-amylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus [308,309]. A surface engineered yeast expressing β-glucosidase and cellulase of Aspergillus aculeatus was shown to assimilate cellooligosaccharides [307]. Surface display of α-amylase of Streptococcus bovis on a glucoamylase displaying yeast was reported by Shigechi et al. (2004) [310]. The engineered yeast was shown to thrive and produce ethanol in a medium with starch as the sole carbon source. Yeasts capable of directly fermenting cellulose require co-display of multiple enzymes including endoglucanases (EGs), cellobiohydrolases (CBHs), and β-glucosidases (BGLs) [311]. EGs act randomly on the amorphous region of the cellulose chain to produce reducing and nonreducing ends. CBHs are needed to release cellobiose from the exposed ends while BGLs hydrolyze the released oligosaccharides to glucose. A surface engineered yeast co-displaying endoglucanase II (EG II) and cellobiohydrolase II (CBH II) of Trichoderma reesei and BGL1 of A. aculeatus was shown to produce ethanol directly from cellulose that had been pre-swollen with phosphoric acid [312]. In the sake yeast S. cerevisiae, ethanol production from β-glucan was achieved by cell surface display of EG and BGL of Aspergillus oryzae [313]. In cells engineered to co-display multiple enzymes, an important consideration is the control of the relative ratios of the various enzyme activities displayed [192,302]. Attempts have been made to optimize the ratios of the surface displayed enzyme activities to improve synergism [314,315]. Although such optimization is based mostly on empiricism, it has been shown to improve ethanol production from cellulosic substrates such as newsprint [316]. Some clostridia produce cellulosome, a complex of scaffolding proteins and the multiple enzymes needed for hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose [317]. This complex is formed through interaction of a cohesin module in the scaffolding proteins and a dockerin module in cellulosomal enzymes [318]. Tsai et al. engineered a yeast to display a mini-cellulosome [319]. The scaffolding proteins of this displayed cellulosome consisted of three cohesin domains derived from Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. The scaffolding proteins were displayed on the surface of S. cerevisiae using the α-agglutinin-based display system. The incubation of the scaffolding protein-displaying yeast with three recombinant cellulases (EG, CBH, and BGL) fused with a dockerin domain produced by E. coli led to a cellulosome displaying yeast able to synergistically hydrolyze cellulose [319]. A consortium of microorganisms displaying different proteins may also be co-cultured to achieve hydrolysis–fermentation of substrates such as cellulose. Goyal et al. developed a yeast consortium consisting of four engineered yeasts that were co-cultured [320]. In their experiments, one of the yeasts displayed cellulosome scaffolding protein and the other three yeasts secreted three different dockerin-fused enzymes. This resulted in the formation of a mini-cellulosome on the surface of the yeast displaying the scaffolding protein. Hemicellulose, including xylan, also occurs in cellulosic biomass. In addition to cellulose, the hemicellulose components of the biomass must also be effectively hydrolyzed to allow full utilization of the biomass for production of ethanol. Xylan is hydrolyzed to xylo-oligosaccharides by endo-β-xylanase and the xylo-oligosaccharides are further hydrolyzed to D-xylose by β-xylosidase. A S. cerevisiae co-displaying xylanase II (XYN II) of Trichoderma reesei and β-xylosidase (XylA) of A. oryzae was engineered using the α-agglutinin-based display system and shown to hydrolyze xylan to xylose [318]. In a further development, xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) of Pichia stipitis and xylulokinase (XK) of S. cerevisiae were produced in the yeast co-displaying XYN II and XylA. The resulting yeast simultaneously saccharified xylan and fermented xylose to ethanol [321,322]. The enzyme xylose isomerase catalyzes the two-step isomerization of xylose to xylulose. In a study, bioactive xylose isomerase of C. cellulovorans was surface-displayed on S. cerevisiae. The resulting yeast could grow in a medium containing xylose as the sole carbon source and produced ethanol directly from xylose [323]. Lignin is another constituent of lignocellulosic biomass. Lignin impedes the action of cellulases by masking the cellulose fibers [324]. Therefore, various biomass pretreatments are used to remove the lignin prior to enzymatically hydrolyzing the cellulosic residue in a second step [324,325]. The enzyme laccase from various white-rot fungi can degrade lignin. A S. cerevisiae was engineered via the α-agglutinin-based display system to surface display laccase I of Trametes sp. [325]. Hydrothermally-processed rice straw was treated with the laccase-displaying yeast and subsequently treated with a yeast co-displaying EG II, CBH II, and BGL1. This two-step treatment improved ethanol yield from rice straw [325]."
8,Future outlook of metabolic engineering for biofuel production,"Although metabolic engineering is a key enabling technology for transforming microorganisms into efficient cell factories [325–327], identifying suitable enzyme targets and metabolic pathways for modification or replacement are not easy. Successful metabolic engineering relies on methods that aid assembly and optimization of novel pathways in microbes. Diverse factors contribute to the performance of a metabolic pathway and problems linked to abundance of mRNA and enzyme activities may not be identified simply by monitoring product titers. Synthetic biologists and metabolic engineers rely on a variety of methods to identify the limiting parts of a pathway [328–333]. Bioproducts not normally made by microorganisms in nature may be synthesized using emerging development in metabolic engineering [334–339]. Such systems metabolic approaches are contributing to development of biofuel producer species as summarized in Table 6. Emerging techniques include high-throughput sequencing for deciphering genomes [340,341]; highly sensitive transcriptomics, proteomics [342–344] and metabolomics methods; [345,346] and advances in fluxomics [347] and computational tools. These technologies are enhancing the potential of metabolic engineering to influence fuel production."
9,Concluding remarks,"Metabolic engineering approaches are proving useful for production of biofuels and biofuel feedstocks in diverse microorganisms including bacteria, yeasts, cyanobacteria, and microalgae. Compared to the traditional random mutagenesis for strain improvement, the metabolic engineering is rational, rapid, and extremely powerful. More specifically, entire new pathways can be introduced into suitable microorganisms to enable production of biofuels and precursors of interest. Alternatively, parts of specific biochemical pathways may be engineered to optimize production of a biofuel. Commercialization of biofuels will inevitably require microbial cell factories that are substantially superior to wildtypes and some of the engineered strains now available. The surface display technology will allow microorganisms to make use of substrates that they previously could not use. This capability will improve the economics of production of some biofuels. Genetic and metabolic engineering in combination with synthetic biology and systems biology are the key to generating highly capable cell factories for production of biofuels. Based on the present state of development of metabolically engineered microorganisms discussed in this review, the following can be inferred: 1. Commercial production of cellulases and other hydrolytic enzymes using engineered microorganisms is well established for producing feedstock sugars from polymeric substrates (lignocellulose, starch, xylans) for microbial fermentation to mainly bioethanol and biobutanol. Production of commercial fuel alcohols relies heavily on these enzymes, but lignocellulosic ethanol remains relatively expensive as a separate process is required for producing the enzymes. 2. Yeasts engineered to ferment simple sugars to isobutanol instead of the conventional ethanol are already being commercialized. Sugars derived from enzymatic hydrolysis of starch, or woody biomass, are used as the fermentation feedstock. 3. Yeasts engineered to surface display hydrolytic enzymes appear to be highly promising and have good prospects for near-term commercial use in production of bioethanol directly from starch and pretreated cellulosic biomass. 4. The bacterium Zymomonas mobilis metabolically engineered to ferment the wood sugar xylose is being used in commercial processes for making bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. 5. Production of biogas, already well established commercially, will continue to rely on native microbial populations in the near term because of the complexities of engineering methanogenic bacteria. 6. Microalgae, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria, whether native or engineered, do not seem to have a near term potential for generating commercializable biofuels. In brief, genetically and metabolically engineered microorganisms are now having an impact on the commercial biofuels scene and this is likely to increase rapidly in the future."
