0,Introduction,"Lepidopterous pests are primary those that harm vegetables and food crops, and their omnivorous and bulimic habits lead to substantial economic losses (Agnihotri et al., 2016). Lepidopterous larvae have alkaline gut with a pH level of up to 12 (Mohammadi et al., 2015; Skibbe et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 2019a, 2019b). This characteristic could potentially be exploited for the targeted pest control of lepidopterous pests (Sarkar and Singh, 2017). Alkaline-sensitive, controlled-release pesticide formulation can be prepared by selecting a suitable carrier for pesticide embedding and targeted pest control. Further, pH-sensitive, controlled-release agents are widely used in medicine but rarely in insects (Kanamala et al., 2016). In addition, the direct-contact toxicity of an insecticide toward non-target organisms would be reduced by embedding the insecticide in carriers. Intelligent controlled-release pesticide preparation is important in pesticide research and has good potential for development (Kumar et al., 2015; Rudzinski et al., 2012). Stimuli-responsive polymers as pesticide carriers can be classified as temperature-, pH-, and optical-responsive (Essawy et al., 2016; Peteu et al., 2010). Natural polysaccharides are suitable for drug carriers because they are renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic and have excellent biocompatibility and extensive application foreground in pesticide formulation research (Ramos Campos et al., 2015). Moreover, pH-responsive polymers based on natural polysaccharides, such as chitosan, sodium alginate, and pectin, contain the weak acids and bases such as carboxylic acids and amines, respectively, because of their molecular chains (Finkenstadt, 2005). Alterations in environmental pH could modify different ionic states, resulting in conformational changes in soluble polymers; thus, the controlled release of pesticides could be achieved via alterations in environmental pH. Therefore, research on pH response-controlled release formulation is vital. Dinotefuran (DIN) was employed in this work as a model pesticide to evaluate the release performance, considering its favorable structural stability under different pH conditions. This broad-spectrum neonicotinoid insecticide is widely used to control pests in agriculture because of its high insecticidal activity at a low dose (Elbert et al., 2008; Tomizawa and Casida, 2005). However, its residues in the environment may cause serious ecological consequences, such as high toxicity toward bees, especially contact toxicity through spray treatment (Sandrock et al., 2014; Whitehorn et al., 2012). Therefore, an appropriate controlled-release formulation of DIN must be developed to avoid contact risk to non-target species and to ensure increased utilization efficiency. In this context, intelligent polymer hydrogels have enormous potential as pesticide carriers. Sodium alginate (SA) is a water-soluble, natural polysaccharide–based, pH-responsive polymer, and SA-based materials are employed as drug delivery vectors in the biomedicine field (Tonnesen and Karlsen, 2002). SA can be crosslinked with many divalent ions (Ca2+, Ba2+, and Co2+) to prepare gels (Bajpai and Sharma, 2004). Calcium ions are widely used in biotechnology because of their nontoxicity and crosslinking ability with SA for the preparation of calcium alginate beads with biocompatibility, biodegradability, swelling behavior, and good surface characteristics (Aradeli Flores-Garay et al., 2016; Arantes De Carvalho et al., 2016). However, pure alginate beads show large network porosity, loose structure, and poor mechanical strength, resulting in the poor embedding efficiency and controlled release of a pesticide (Pasparakis and Bouropoulos, 2006). Polymer blending can effectively improve the properties of polymers. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a synthetic hydrophilic polymer with swelling capacity, non-toxicity, and high chemical stability and can form gels by chemical or physical crosslinking. Boric acids show relatively low toxicity and are usually used to crosslink PVA (Bilal and Asgher, 2015). However, simplex PVA gels have low swelling capacity and cannot easily form a sphere. Therefore, a SA/PVA gel carrier was successfully prepared to improve structure, pesticide loading, and release properties. In this study, we aimed to develop and characterize pH-responsive controlled-release SA/PVA gel beads (SA/PVA-beads) and verify their effectiveness in the entrapment and targeted-release of DIN. SVA/PVA-beads were characterized for their morphology, entrapment efficiency, and release behaviors. In vitro DIN release was tested in solutions with different pH values, and in vivo release in S. litera midgut (5th instar) was investigated. Overall, the development of a pH-sensitive, intelligent controlled-release preparation is crucial for green environmental pest control technologies."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials SA (98%, MW: 12,000–40,000), PVA (polymerization degree: 1750 ± 50, MW: 44.05 kDa), and anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2) were purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). DIN (98%) was obtained from the China Ministry of Agriculture's Institute for Control of Agrochemicals (Beijing, China). DIN standard (99.7%) was acquired from Dr. Ehrenstorfer GmbH (Germany). Chromatographic grade acetonitrile and methanol were acquired from Meridian Medical Technologies (United States of America). All other reagents and solvents were of analytical grade and purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China)."
3,Preparation of DIN: SA/PVA beads,"2.2 Preparation of DIN: SA/PVA beads DIN-loaded SA beads (DIN:SA-beads) were prepared by simple ionic gelation. Ca2+ from calcium chloride can exchange with Na+ from SA from mixed solution; the strands of SA molecules twine around each other subsequent to the exchange of Na+ with Ca2+ to form interpenetrating polymer network hydrogels (Kim et al., 2016). DIN release was blocked to achieve controlled release. The SA solution (1.5% w/v) was prepared by dissolved in deionized water at 60 °C and stir at 13.975×g for 1 h. DIN was added to the SA solution in order that the weight ratio of DIN:SA was equal to 1:1 and this was followed by constant stirring at room temperature. Subsequently, the resulting solution was dropped in a CaCl2 solution (3%, w/v) using an injector, to prepare the hydrogels beads. DIN-loaded SA/PVA-beads (DIN:SA/PVA-beads) were prepared via the method described by Lorenzetti (Lorenzetti et al., 2015). Different mixed gel beads were prepared by adjusting the proportion of SA/PVA (9/1, 7/3, 5/5, and 3/7). Uniform gel beads were prepared in a boric acid–CaCl2 solution by adjusting the rotation speed of the magnetic stirrer and the concentration of the blend solution. DIN was added to a SA/PVA solution before drop in boric acid-CaCl2 solution, and the resulting solution was dropped in a boric acid–CaCl2 solution containing an equal amount of DIN:SA-beads. DIN:SA/PVA-beads were obtained after several washing–suction filtration cycles. The surface water of beads was absorbed with a filter paper. Each preparation was repeated three times. Finally, the obtained beads were stored at a 4 °C in a refrigerator. This manufacturing process is simple and achieves stable results and it can thus be applied for batch production."
4,"Encapsulation efficiency (EE %), loading capacity (LC %) and yield (Y %)","2.3 Encapsulation efficiency (EE %), loading capacity (LC %) and yield (Y %) The DIN detected via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu, LC-20 A, Japan) using a C18 column at a maximum absorbance of 270 nm. Injected samples were prepared by filtering through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. The encapsulation efficiency (EE, %), loading capacity (LC, %), and yield (Y, %) of DIN were calculated as follows (Benavides et al., 2016): EE ( % ) = W ( total amount of DIN ) - W ( free DIN ) W ( total amount of DIN ) × 100 LC ( % ) = W ( encapsulated of DIN ) W ( obtained beads ) × 100 Y ( % ) = W ( obtained beads ) W ( total amount of polymer solution ) × 100 The total amount of DIN was the initial added weight. The weight of free DIN was included in the content of supernatant and washing liquid. Supernatants were collected and subjected to HPLC to determine their free DIN weight content."
5,Characterization of the prepared gel beads,"2.4 Characterization of the prepared gel beads The structure and properties of SA/PVA-beads were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Verios 460, Germany). The chemical structures of DIN, SA, PVA, and SA/PVA-beads were analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy. Test samples were dried at 50 °C in a vacuum drying oven overnight and then mixed with KBr powder to prepare samples in pellet form for analysis. Spectral analysis involved the use of an FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Subsequently, these The microstructure of gel beads were pretreated following the method reported by Mohammadi et al. (2015). Subsequently, these beads were imaged using a scanning electron microscope to determine their surface and section performances."
6,Evaluation of swelling degree and DIN release in vitro for obtained beads,"2.5 Evaluation of swelling degree and DIN release in vitro for obtained beads Approximately 0.2 g of DIN:SA/PVA-beads were weighed accurately and added with 20 mL of deionized water with pH 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, and 11.0 in triplicate. NaOH (pH 13.0) and HCl (pH 1.0) were diluted with distilled water to obtain the aqueous solutions with the desired pH, as detected using a precise pH instrument (Mettler-tledo, Shanghai, China). All experimental solutions were freshly prepared just before use. The swollen gel beads were weighed after a period of time. Three groups of parallel experiments were performed for each treatment. The swelling ratio (SR) of DIN:SA-beads and DIN:SA/PVA-beads was calculated as follows: SR ( % ) = Wt − W0 W 0 × 100 % where W 0 represents the sample's initial added weight, and W t indicates the weight of the swollen beads at a certain point in time. DIN release behaviors under different pH mediums were determined by detecting the concentration of DIN at set intervals. The sample detection methods are found in Section 2.3. The same volume of a solution sample was replaced with a fresh solution during every sampling."
7,Bioassays,"2.6 Bioassays Insect rearing: S. litura eggs were collected from taro leaves from the experimental farm of South China Agricultural University, transported to the laboratory, and fed an artificial diet in an artificial climate box. Test larvae were reared and maintained under the following conditions: temperature = 25 ± 1 °C, relative humidity (RH) = 60–80%, and photophase duration = 14 h. Insecticidal activity studies: A diet incorporation method was used to investigate the insecticidal activity of DIN:SA/PVA-beads, with DIN treatment serving as the control technical group (Zhao et al., 2019a, 2019b). The control technical group was dissolved in deionized water and added into the artificial diet to prepare a series concentration (200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25 μg/g) of DIN. The DIN:SA/PVA-bead group was directly added to the artificial diet to achieve the same concentrations as those achieved by adding the control technical group. The test S. litura larvae (5th instar) were starved for 4 h before insecticidal activity experiment. Ten larvae were treated at each concentration, and each treatment was repeated three times. The status of the larvae was observed, and mortality rate at 48 h was investigated. In vivo dynamics: The growth consistency of the 5th instar larvae of S. litura was determined to investigate the in vivo dynamics and degradation of DIN and DIN:SA/PVA-beads during the corresponding larval treatments at 25 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 5% RH. Sublethal concentrations of DIN and DIN:SA/PVA-beads (both 100 μg/g) were used for treating test larvae by adding them to the artificial diets. Approximately 1 g each of the artificial diet treated with DIN and DIN:SA/PVA-beads was weighed to feed S. litura larvae and then replaced with fresh diet. Three replicates of five larvae per treatment were sampled at 0.16 (10 min), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. Blood samples were collected through an incision made on the first proleg of larvae using entomological scissors. The supernatant of intestinal contents from the midgut samples was collected via centrifugation at 11,180×g. All the samples were extracted with acetonitrile and detected using an HPLC detector."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis These treatments were performed at least in three independent replicates. The data collected in this study were expressed as means and standard deviations, indicated as “mean ± SE”. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. The statistical software SPSS 22.0 was used to calculate LC50, the 95% confidence limit, and the corresponding virulence regression equation."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Morphology of SA and SA/PVA beads,"3.1 Morphology of SA and SA/PVA beads Fig. 1 (a) shows the surface microstructures of SA beads observed via SEM. Some wrinkles and holes were observed on their surface. This feature was caused by the partial collapsing of interpenetrating polymer networks during vacuum drying. The network structure was observed in a cross section image, as presented in Fig. 1(b). Single SA beads with crosslinked Ca 2+ were produced via ionic gelation. In consideration of their pH-sensitive properties, these beads can be used for loading pesticides to achieve intelligent controlled release, especially in alkaline conditions. However, their loose structure and poor mechanical properties resulted in their easy cracking and poor embedding effect. Compared with the loose structure of SA beads, the surface microstructure of SA/PVA (7:3, v/v) beads showed denser and smoother morphology (Fig. 1(c)) due to the –OH of PVA being crosslinked with boric acid to form a clathrate (Hui et al., 2014). As the hydrophilic groups were reduced, the crosslinking density gradually increased. Moreover, the dense structure of a carrier helps to improve the encapsulation rate and sustained release ability (Han et al., 2019). Fig. 1(d) shows the section microstructures of SA/PVA-beads after being crosslinked by Ca 2+ and the formation of B (OH) 4- double interpenetrating network; this finding was different from that of Bae et al. (2017), who found a clear core-shell structure. The mixed gel beads were formed via external curing by dropping the SA/PVA mixed intermixture into a boric acid–CaCl2 solution. Therefore, the size of the prepared gel beads was affected by the initial droplet size, and the gel beads with a series of different particle sizes were prepared by adjusting the drop rate."
11,FTIR analysis,"3.2 FTIR analysis FTIR measurement was conducted to further investigate the functional groups and interactions existing in the system. Fig. 2 (a) shows the FTIR spectra of DIN, PVA, SA, and gel beads. The characteristic peaks at 3340 and 3294 cm −1 were ascribed to the stretching vibration of –NH and –OH. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of –CH2 were observed at 2952 and 2877 cm −1, respectively. For SA, the characteristic peaks at 1611, 1417, and 1031 cm −1 were due to the stretching of –COO− (asymmetric), –COO− (symmetric), and C–O–C, respectively. The strong peak at 3406 cm−1 indicates the –OH stretching vibration from intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Saarai et al., 2013). The crosslinking process with Ca2+ caused a distinct shift of –COO− stretching bands to relatively high wavenumber, indicating the formation of ionic bonding between the Ca 2+ and –COO− of SA. The characteristic peaks of PVA were shown at 3368 (−OH stretching) and 2919 cm−1 (−CH stretching), and C–O stretching peaks were observed at 1000−2000 cm−1 (Chen et al., 2015). Compared with the –OH stretching peak of PVA observed in the PVA spectrum, the –OH stretching peak of SA/PVA-beads shifted toward a higher wavenumber (3444 cm−1) after SA addition. This result suggested that the hydrogen bonding between PVA molecules was weakened (Rafiq et al., 2018). The wavenumber (1628 cm-1) of carboxylate band in the spectrum of SA/PVA-beads was similar to that of carboxylate band in the spectrum of SA. The enhancement in the telescopic vibration absorption of –COO− indicated the formation of ionic bonding between Ca2+ and –COO – by chelation. In summary, PVA/SA-beads were formed according to the above analysis, and DIN was loaded by physical embedding. The schematic illustrations of DIN:SA/PVA-beads are shown in Fig. 2(b)."
12,Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity,"3.3 Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity As shown in Table 1 , the best encapsulation efficiency (83.19%) and loading capacity (1.01%) of SA/PVA-beads was obtained with a mass ratio of 7:3. The single SA beads with low loading capacity may be correlated with the physicochemical property of DIN, which has good water solubility. The dual crosslinking structure of the gel beads aids in DIN embedding. The high PVA content may hinder the formation of gel beads and subsequently cause low entrapment efficiency. The results also showed that the higher the SA content, the better the gel bead yield. In this study, we selected SA/PVA (7:3) blend beads to study the swelling degree and release behavior of DIN."
13,Swelling ratio and release behavior,"3.4 Swelling ratio and release behavior The influence of different pH values of 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, and 11.0 on the swelling degree and release behavior of DIN:SA-beads and DIN:SA/PVA-beads was evaluated at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 3 . The formulation was optimized using SR and in vitro release as two evaluation parameters. Fig. 3 (a) shows the weight change of DIN:SA-beads over time for solutions with different pH values. The SR increased with increasing swelling time, especially for alkaline solutions, the electrostatic repulsion increased with an increase in pH and thus facilitated swelling (Samanta and Ray, 2014). After 120 min of swelling, the SA-beads had a maximum SR of 1200% in pH 11.0 media and then dissolved gradually. The corresponding DIN release behavior is displayed in Fig. 3(b). DIN could be released from DIN:SA-beads even after a low degree of swelling, considering that DIN has good water solubility and that the beads have a loose polymer network (Rahman et al., 2018). At pH 3.0, approximately 54.1% of the loaded DIN was released into the water medium during the first 5 min, and approximately 70.0% of the loaded DIN was released into the water medium in 240 min. Over 76.9% of the loaded DIN was released during the first 5 min when the pH was 11.0, and the release reached 93.7% in 240 min. In short, SA plays a key role in the pH-sensitive performance of drug-loaded controlled release systems; moreover, PVA can be used as a vector backbone for drug-loaded carriers to improve the sustained release characteristics (Dong et al., 2014). DIN:SA/PVA-beads exhibited a lower degree of swelling compared with single alginate gel beads in the same medium (Fig. 3(c)), considering their compact structure and low permeability. The SA/PVA–beads had a maximum SR of 677% in pH 11.0 media after 240 min of swelling. A similar swelling curve was achieved with DIN:SA-beads, as shown in Fig. 3(d). At pH 3.0, approximately 27.5% of the loaded DIN was released into the water medium during the first 5 min and approximately 40.2% in 240 min. However, over 72.1% of the loaded DIN was released during the first 5 min at pH 11.0, and 88.7% was released in 240 min. This result indicated that DIN:SA/PVA -beads would need relatively long time to disintegrate and gradually release DIN. Hua et al. (2010) obtained similar results for swelling and release behaviors when pure SA hydrogel and SA/PVA hydrogel were used for the controlled release of diclofenac sodium. In general, the release of DIN from both formulations in a medium with high pH was faster than that in a medium with low pH. However, the blend hydrogel beads showed improved pH sensitive ability. Xiang et al. (2018) used dual crosslinked alginate-chitosan blend gel beads to achieve the controlled release of bovine serum albumin in alkaline simulated colonic fluid; moreover, these beads remained stable under gastrointestinal conditions. Compared with SA-beads, the SA/PVA-beads could delay the DIN release under acidic and neutral conditions. The swelling and erosion results were in good agreement with the release results."
14,Insecticidal activity studies,"3.5 Insecticidal activity studies The insecticidal activities of DIN:SA/PVA-beads against S. litera in 48 h were expressed in terms of the mortality rate. As shown in Fig. 4 , the relationship lines of mortality probability corresponding to the logarithms base 10 (lg) of different concentrations were established using SPSS. Fig. 4(a) reveals the probability of mortality corresponding to the logarithm of different DIN concentrations. The regression equation of DIN against S. litera in 48 h is y = −3.295 + 1.775x; the correlation coefficients R2 is 0.982 and LC50 is 71.79 μg/g with a 95% fiducial limit in the range of approximately 53.69–101.40 μg/g. Fig. 4 (b) reveals the probability of mortality corresponding to the logarithm of different DIN:SA/PVA-beads concentrations. The regression equation of DIN:SA/PVA -beads against S. litera in 48 h is y = −3.566 + 2.050x; the correlation coefficients R2 is 0.953 and LC50 is 54.88 μg/g with a 95% fiducial limit in the range of approximately 42.21–72.29 μg/g. Compared with single DIN treatments, the DIN:SA/PVA beads showed better insecticidal activity against S. litera. This may be due to the absorption and swelling abilities of the blend beads in the midgut of S. litera. Thus, the intestinal pH and microenvironment changed, which led to enhanced insecticidal activity. Wang et al. (2018) improved the toxicity of avermectin against Plutella xylostella by preparing a uniform nanoparticle formulation to increase the ability of the corresponding nanoparticles to make contact with the target tissue. Thus, the dual crosslinked blend beads need development toward relatively small particle size for further improvement in their insecticidal activity."
15,In vivo dynamics and degradation,"3.6 In vivo dynamics and degradation Fig. 5 shows the concentration dynamics and degradation of DIN in blood, midgut, and feces after feeding S. litera larvae with DIN and DIN:SA/PVA-beads with the artificial diet. For midgut samples, the dynamics curve demonstrates a rising trend with time during the first hour, followed by a decrease. The reason may be associated with the feed changes and excretion dilution. The test larvae (5th instar) fed with DIN-containing diet after starvation treatment showed increased DIN concentration at a maximal value of 6.85 μg/g. When the fed diet was replaced with the fresh diet, the excretion effect showed a concentration drop. The concentration of DIN in blood samples relative to the midgut peaked at 2.62 μg/g in 1 h and then decreased. Compared with DIN feed treatment, feed DIN: SA/PVA-beads achieved the highest value with 6.20 μg/g in the midgut at 1 h and 2.45 μg/g in the blood at 6 h due to the controlled-release effect. Furthermore, DIN concentration in the feces showed that the test larvae could reduce the pesticide in the body through excretion. The curve showing a gradual increase and subsequent decrease in the case of treatment with DIN: SA/PVA-beads may be related to digestion. The S. litera larvae may need to produce additional intestinal fluid to digest the gel beads and decreased the intestinal pH, thereby resulting in an extension of excretion (Clark, 1999). The corresponding dissipation equation and half-life of DIN in the midgut and blood of S. litera are shown in Table 2 . The half-life of DIN in the midgut increased from 3.71 to 8.35 h by treatment with DIN:SA/PVA-beads. The half-life of DIN in the blood increased from 6.93 h to 13.08 h. The DIN:SA/PVA-beads exhibited good release in the midgut of S. litera. Moreover, these beads would extend the time of operation in the internal region. A target controlled-release formulation with a good pH-sensitive performance would result in good control efficacy toward pests because of structural changes with pH. Moreover, the controlled-release formulation would produce sustained prevention effects according to the hazardous characteristics of pests (Xiang et al., 2018). In addition, a pH-sensitive pesticide-loaded controlled-release system can effectively improve the utilization rate of pesticides and effectively prevent the degradation of pesticides under ultraviolet light. Gao et al. (2019) used an alkaline-sensitive controlled-release system for encapsulating abamectin to achieve rapid release under alkaline conditions (pH 10) for the targeted control of rice pest Cnaphalocrocis medinalis larvae. This study shows that DIN:SA/PVA-beads, as a base-triggered release formulation, have potential for further development for use in the targeted control of alkaline gut pests."
16,Conclusions,"In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of SA–PVA as a pH-sensitive carrier to encapsulate DIN with good encapsulation percentage and stability. The blend beads had dense interpenetrating polymer networks that were useful to ameliorate the pesticide burst release; however, these beads did not show any effect on the large release under alkaline conditions. The DIN:SA/PVA-beads had excellent release behavior in S. litera and exerted improved insecticidal activity. The blend hydrogel beads are desirable for development as an environmentally-friendly, easy-to-prepare formulation with low cost."
