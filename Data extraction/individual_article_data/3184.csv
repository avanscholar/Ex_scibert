0,Introduction,"Global warming and depletion of non-renewable resources require development of sustainable energy production. One promising energy carrier is hydrogen (H2). H2 has almost for a century been regarded as environmentally friendly fuel of the future but it is still mainly produced from fossil fuels. An alternative means to produce H2 is biological, such as via biophotolysis, photofermentation and dark fermentation (for reviews see [1–3]). Studies of dark fermentation are often performed using a single species [4–6] or with mixed cultures enriched from sources such as hot springs [7] or waste water treatment plants [8]. The determination of the roles of different microorganisms in the communities is very challenging. Communities have been studied to gain better understanding of the effects of population diversity and dynamics on process performance, but more studies are needed to predict the systems performance in a given condition (for a review see [9]). The use of mixed cultures allows the use of non-sterilized feed and equipments for the fermentation. The challenge of non-sterile environment is to maintain the desired community in the continuous reactor system by adjusting the growth conditions [10–12], e.g. pH [13], temperature [14] and media composition [15] can be optimized to drive the process toward desired products. Maintaining the desired community in the reactor system is important, since the instability in the fermentative H2 production is often due to the changes in the microbial community structure [16] (for a review see [17]). Current methods enable detailed study of a community composition in a reactor system, but less is known about the role of each species in the community and their effects on H2 production. In a preceding study of Koskinen et al. [16], dynamic changes in the microbial community composition of a H2 fermenting fluidized-bed reactor were reported. Both Clostridium butyricum and Escherichia coli were detected throughout the reactor operation, thus we selected those species for more detailed study. C. butyricum produces more H2 from glucose than E. coli, theoretical maximum being 4 mol-H2/mol-glucose for C. butyricum and 2 mol-H2/mol-glucose for E. coli [18]. E. coli is a facultatively anaerobic and in anaerobic environment it produces H2 by a mixed acid fermentation degrading glucose first to pyruvate by glycolysis followed by degradation to lactate, succinate, acetate, ethanol and gases (H2 and CO2) (Fig. 1 ). C. butyricum is strictly anaerobic oxidizing glucose to lactate, acetate, butyrate, ethanol and gases (H2 and CO2) (Fig. 1) [19]. C. butyricum is a promising H2 producer [20–22]. In this study the growth, glucose degradation and H2 production by C. butyricum and E. coli were studied in batch assays as pure and cocultures. The H2 yield by C. butyricum alone was higher that with E. coli or a coculture. However, the coculture utilized glucose more efficiently in the batch culture and the total production of H2 in the coculture was higher than with C. butyricum solely."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental setting,"2.1 Experimental setting C. butyricum strain was isolated from hydrogen-producing bioreactor [16] by plating diluted sample from the bioreactor to Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM) agar plates. The plates were incubated in an anaerobic glove chamber (80% N2, 10% CO2 and 10% H2). The single colonies obtained were re-streaked several times. The isolate had a 99% similarity to C. butyricum DSM2478 and C. butyricum NCIMB8082 based on partial 16S rRNA sequence. E. coli K-12 MG1655 was obtained from CGSC (E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale, USA). Six assays were done simultaneously consisting three duplicate experiments; separate incubation of E. coli and C. butyricum and their coculture. As inocula, 15 ml of E. coli MG1655 with optical density at wavelength 600 nm (OD600) of 0.09 and 15 ml of C. butyricum with OD600 of 0.836, were used. In the coculture experiment, 15 ml of both inocula were added. The use of same amount of E. coli and C. butyricum inocula, even thought the OD600 is grater with C. butyricum, is due to the faster initialization of growth of E. coli. Thus addition of more C. butyricum enables the simultaneous exponential phases. Anaerobic liquid media used for all cultivations contained 3 g/l glucose, 0.53 g/l K2HPO4, 0.95 g/l KH2PO4, 2 g/l (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g/l cystein-HCl, 0.5 g/l agar-agar, 0.3 g/l yeast extract, 0.2 g/l MgSO4·7H2O, 15 mg/l CaCl2·2H2O, 5 mg/l FeSO4·7H2O, 1 mg/l resazurin, supplemented with 2 ml/l of trace element solution containing 1 ml/l HCl (25%), 100 mg/l MnCl·4H2O, 70 mg/l ZnCl2, 60 mg/l H3BO3, 200 mg/l CoCl2·6H2O, 20 mg/l CuCl2·2H2O, 20 mg/l NiCl2·6H2O, 40 mg/l Na2MoO4·2H2O. Initial pH was set to 6.5, since the biomass yield in C. butyricum cultures has been found to be highest with pH 6.5 and the pH 5.5 has given the highest H2 yield [23]. The pH was not controlled. Experiments were done in anaerobic jars, that were purged with N2 before and after the addition of anaerobic media until anaerobic conditions were achieved according the indicator colour. Jars contained ports for pH sensor, pressure sensor, gas sampling, and liquid sampling (Fig. 2 ). The total volume of each jar was 2100 ml with media volume of 250 ml. The jars were maintained at 37 °C in a water bath and mixed with magnetic stirrers. The temperature was monitored automatically (pt1000 and Nokeval 6821, Nokeval Oy, Finland). The data from temperature, pH (polilyte RX 225, Hamilton, Switzerland and PHAMP-1 Pre-Amplifier, SensoreX, USA) and pressure sensors (0–2.5 bar abs, ECO-1, Wika, Germany) was collected automatically at 1 min intervals. Sensors were connected to an NI DAQPAD-6015 data logger (National Instruments, USA) and the data was read with Measurement & Automation Explorer 4.0 software (National Instruments, USA). Gas and liquid samples were taken manually. At the beginning of the experiment the manual samples were taken at 1.5 h intervals and at the end as needed. Liquid samples were analyzed for volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ethanol, glucose, and OD600. H2 and CO2 were measured from the gas samples. The gaseous end products (H2, CO2) were measured using HP 5890II gas chromatograph equipped with 6 ft Porapak N column (80/100 mesh) and a thermal conductivity detector. Oven, injector and detector temperatures were 50, 80 and 80 °C, respectively. N2 was used as carrier gas. VFAs, alcohols and glucose were measured using Waters 510 liquid chromatograph pump whit a Shodex® Sugar SH1011 column (Showa Denko K.K.,Tokyo, Japan) and a Δn − 1000 refraction index detector (WGE Dr. Bures GmbH & Co KG, Dallgow, Germany). Mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4. Due to the usage of pH sensors and pressure sensors that could not be autoclaved, those equipments were sterilized by rinsing with ethanol prior the experiment. Therefore the media contained ethanol prior inoculaton and the initial value of ethanol was reduced from all results. Biomass production was monitored by measuring OD600 (Ultrospec 500 pro, Amersham Biosciences, UK)."
3,Mathematical formulations,"2.2 Mathematical formulations The measured H2 production was compared with the amount of H2 expected based on the measured VFA production. The calculation method varies according to the cultivation type, since enteric bacteria derive hydrogen from formate (Table 1 , reactions 1–4) and for anaerobes the H2 production is based on the activities of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydrogenase (Table 1, reactions 5–8) [24]. Thus three different equations were formulated to calculate the H2 production as amount of substance (n). During H2 production of E. coli, glucose is first degraded to pyruvate (Fig. 1). The breakdown of pyruvate is then catalyzed by pyruvate formate lyase, in order to produce acetyl-CoA and formate. Formate is further degraded to H2 and CO2 [24] and acetyl-CoA is degraded to acetate and ethanol. The reactions shown in Table 1 (reactions 1–4) were used to estimate the H2 production: (1) n ( H 2 ) = n ( acetate ) + n ( ethanol ) The production of H2 by C. butyricum begins by degrading glucose to pyruvate. The breakdown of pyruvate is then catalyzed by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase to produce reduced ferredoxin from which electrons for hydrogen can be derived [24]. For this reaction the NADH is required. The production of acetate does not consume, butyrate production consumes one and ethanol production consumes two NADH. Thus acetate production have highest yield of H2 and ethanol production does not produce H2. The reactions of H2 production from glucose (Table 1, Reactions 5 and 6) were used to formulate the following equation. (2) n ( H 2 ) = 2 · n ( acetate ) + 2 · n ( butyrate ) In the coculture, the H2 production was a combination of two distinct fermentation pathways of E. coli and C. butyricum. Thus, the following equation for estimation of H2 production was formulated (based on Reactions 1–6, Table 1), (3) n ( H 2 ) = ( 1 − x ) · 2 · n ( acetate ) + x · n ( acetate ) + 2 · n ( butyrate ) + x · n ( ethanol ) , where x refers to the ratio of the VFA production between E. coli and C. butyricum. With all the cultivation types, glucose degradation results were compared to the VFA production. The chemical equations of glucose degradation (Table 1, Reactions 5–8) were used to estimate the amount of glucose used for production of the measured VFAs. (4) n ( glucose ) = 0.5 · n ( acetate ) + 0.5 · n ( ethanol ) + 0.5 · n ( lactate ) + n ( butyrate )"
4,Results and discussion,
5,Dynamics of hydrogen production by E. coli,"3.1 Dynamics of hydrogen production by E. coli The growth of E. coli started on glucose after a lag phase of 3 h (Fig. 3 ) with the final OD600 of 0.44. The gas production of E. coli started right after onset of exponential growth. The exponential growth ended after 10.5 h. Nevertheless, E. coli continued the gas production still for 15 h. During the experiment, 3.89 ± 0.14 mmol of H2 and 4.53 ± 0.02 mmol of CO2 was released (Fig. 4 A and B). According the pressure measurements, the gas production by E. coli was steady throughout the experiment. The H2 production pattern of E. coli (Fig. 4A) was in line with glucose degradation (Fig. 4C). The H2 production was on average 1.63 mol-H2/mol-glucose (average of the values shown in the Fig. 4D). Based on endpoint measurements, E. coli produced 1.45 mol-H2/mol-glucose (the last value in the Fig. 4D). This value was high compared to literature [25,26]. The high yield of H2 (per mol of glucose) might be due to the medium that contained small amount of yeast extract. The yeast extract was added to enable the growth of C. butyricum in the same media as E. coli. However, Kim et al. [27] reported production of 1.62 mol-H2/mol-glucose at low H2 partial pressure with E. coli. This value can be compared to our results, since the size of the fermentor used in our experiments was large compared to the amount of liquid medium used, thus H2 partial pressure remained low (Fig. 3). The metabolites produced by E. coli were as shown in Fig. 5 A. E. coli produced 8.71 ± 0.58 mM of acetate, 2.3 ± 0.01 mM of lactate and 6.9 ± 2 mM of ethanol. In the mixed acid fermentation, lactate production consumes pyruvate without H2 production, thus low lactate production is preferred [28]. The acid production decreased the pH to 4.3 (Fig. 6 ) and it stopped the gas production. Equation (1) was used to compare the gas production and VFA results to verify that the gas and VFA production results support each other. At the endpoint, the measured and calculated values of H2 production were similar (Fig. 7 A). In addition, the glucose degradation results were compared to the produced VFAs (Equation (4)). The calculated VFA consumption of E. coli was as shown in Fig. 7A. At the end, 19% of the glucose was used for other purposes than to the production of measured VFAs. The rest was utilized for production of other metabolites and biomass."
6,Dynamics of hydrogen production by C. butyricum,"3.2 Dynamics of hydrogen production by C. butyricum The exponential growth of C. butyricum began immediately after the inoculation with an active culture. The exponential phase lasted for 7.5 h and the OD600 reached the value of 2.07. The gas production ended at the same time as the growth (Fig. 3). The total gas production by C. butyricum was 4.62 ± 0.15 mmol of H2 and 4.72 ± 0.24 mmol of CO2 (Fig. 4A and B). The gas production pattern by C. butyricum was similar to the growth curve (Fig. 3). This was different from the results of Chen et al. [23] where the dynamics of H2 production was studied with C. butyricum in sucrose-based medium. In their experiment, H2 production started at the middle-stage of exponential growth. This difference might be due to our inoculation with active, gas producing culture or usage of different strain and media. The glucose utilization of C. butyricum for H2 production was on average 2.23 mol-H2/mol-glucose (Fig. 4D). The total H2 production at the endpoint showed that C. butyricum produced 2.09 mol H2/mol glucose. These values were similar to those reported by Lin et al. [5] where C. butyricum produced 2.29 mol H2/mol glucose. C. butyricum produced mostly butyrate with the final concentration being 3.7 ± 0.3 mM. The end concentration of acetate was 2.29 ± 0.84 mM, lactate 0.83 ± 0.16 mM and ethanol 2.59 ± 0.27 mM (Fig. 5). The end product yields compared to glucose consumption were as shown in Table 2 . The amount of butyrate and acetate decreased at the end of the experiment. The fermentation of acetate and butyrate further to H2 and CO2 is not favored thermodynamically [29]. Understanding of the underlying processes behind the degradations of acetate and butyrate would need more extensive study of metabolites, thus this is an interesting matter of a new study. C. butyricum did not use all glucose during the experiment. This was due to the pH decrease to 4.4 (Fig. 6). It has been shown that C. butyricum grows slowly in pH below 4.6, and produces only little H2 [23,22]. The Equation (2) was used to combine the results of H2 and VFA production. The estimated and measured H2 production were in line with each other. The low estimation of last measurement point was due to decrease in the amount butyrate and acetate as previously discussed. In addition, glucose consumption was combined to VFA results (Equation (4)). The results are shown Fig. 7B. The comparison shows that 20% of the glucose consumed was used for other purposes than to the production of the measured VFAs."
7,Dynamics of hydrogen production by the coculture and comparison to pure culture experiments,"3.3 Dynamics of hydrogen production by the coculture and comparison to pure culture experiments The coculture of C. butyricum and E. coli was grown in similar manner as the two species alone. The exponential growth and gas production began directly after inoculation. The exponential growth ended after 7.5 h and the gas production after 9 h. The final OD600 reached a value of 2.52, which was clearly higher than with single species cultures (Fig. 3). The coculture produced 5.85 ± 0.03 mmol of H2 and 5.33 ± 0.07 mmol of CO2 (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, the total gas production by the coculture was higher than with single species. The higher total H2 production resulted from more efficient use of glucose. However, C. butyricum was more efficient in the H2 production (Fig. 4D), since on average, E. coli produced 1.63 mol H2/mol glucose, C. butyricum 2.23 mol-H2/mol-glucose and coculture 1.79 mol-H2/mol-glucose. When only endpoint values are taken in to account, the H2 production of the coculture was 1.65 mol-H2/mol-glucose. C. butyricum degraded 7.11 mmol, E. coli 9.21 mmol and coculture 10.47 mmol of glucose during the cultivation. The amount of residual glucose in the cultivations was 6.9 mmol-glucose/l for E. coli, 7.3 mmol-glucose/l for C. butyricum and 4.6 mmol glucose/l for coculture (Fig. 4C). The decrease of pH to 4.4 ended the growth and gas production. The coculture produced almost equal amount of butyrate and acetate, 6.3 ± 0.5 mM and 6.0 ± 0.7 mM, respectively. Lactate was produced 1.48 ± 0.3 mM and ethanol 0 ± 0.5 mM (Fig. 5). Explaining the cause of the decrease in the amount of ethanol at the end of the cultivation would need more detailed study of metabolites. The end product yields were as shown in Table 2. The same decrease in the amount of butyrate and acetate as in the pure culture of C. butyricum was not seen in the coculture, on the contrary, the coculture produced more butyrate and acetate than C. butyricum alone. The higher acetate production was due to the acetate produced by E. coli. The higher butyrate production might be due to the higher acetate production as suggested by Colin et al. [30] where the addition of acetate to the C. butyricum culture growing on glycerol increased the biomass and butyrate production. Equation (3) was used to combine the measured gas and VFA production results of coculture. Lactate production was examined to solve the value for x in Equation (3), since lactate production does not produce H2. Based on the data in Fig. 3, C. butyricum seemed to be predominant species in the reactor, thus C. butyricum was expected to produce as much lactate when growing alone and in a coculture. The fraction of lactate in the end products of C. butyricum and coculture was estimated with equation (5) x = lactate coculture − lactate butyricum lactate coculture = 1.48 mM − 0.83 mM 1.48 mM = 0.44 Resulting value of x gave matching results with measured H2 production as shown in Fig. 7C. The comparison of VFA production and glucose degradation was done using Equation (4) (Fig. 7C). At the endpoint, 24% of glucose was used for other purposes than production of measured metabolites."
8,Conclusions,"The gas production pattern of batch fermentations by E. coli and C. butyricum differed, i.e. E. coli continued gas production long after the exponential growth. Fermentation by E. coli produced 1.45 mol-H 2/mol-glucose, by C. butyricum 2.09 mol-H2/mol-glucose and by coculture 1.65 mol-H2/mol-glucose. Even though C. butyricum produced H2 more efficiently than the coculture, the coculture was able to degrade more of glucose and thereby to produced more hydrogen in total than C. butyricum alone. The glucose utilization ended in all cultivations when pH reached the value of 4.4. Here, the pure culture of optimal hydrogen producer was better in hydrogen production per consumed substrate unit but the coculture outperformed the monocultures with better total hydrogen production volumes. It remains to be seen whether this is also true in continuous cultivations."
