0,Introduction,"Every day human life is dependent on various forms of energy. Nowadays, the energy-related science and engineering have paid remarkable attention to hydrogen gas (H2), as a prospective fuel candidate. The unique characteristics of H2 such as its high gravimetric-based energy content, absence of greenhouse gas emissions after its combustion/oxidation and its relatively versatile production methods have qualified it to the potential contributors of future energy demand. Hence, the exploitation of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen could facilitate environmental-friendly, cleaner technologies and consequently, it would lead to higher sustainability and the wiser use of limitedly available fossil resources [1]. The H2 formation via biotechnological methods is considered to be an important process in achieving the transition and development of a green energy market. First reports on hydrogen production by fermentative pathways date back to the early 1970's [2]. Thereafter, the magnitude of research efforts dealing with various aspects of hydrogen fermentation, including feedstock utilization, reactor design and engineering, insights to microbial community structures, metabolic engineering or modification of hydrogenases, post-fermentation downstream (i.e. H2 purification and upgrading) has been growing tremendously. Especially in these last 5 years, it has grown enormously ( Fig. 1). Although fermentative hydrogen production could have compromises due to appearance of side-products such as volatile fatty acids, their conversion has been demonstrated by several promising approaches [3]. Although, from a technological point of view, continuously operated bioreactors are the most suggestible for up-scaled future implementations (a dominant part of previous works on continuous fermentative hydrogen production was carried out using glucose and sucrose). However, comparatively, only a fewer number of studies have been presented based on sugar-rich wastewater streams [4] and maybe even less based on complex structure solid materials, in particular lignocelluloses [1]. Nevertheless, the further expansion of these research directions would be essential for industrially and economically viable applications. Glycerol, as a major byproduct (about 10%) of biodiesel production which has been widely used as substrate in anaerobic digestion due to its easily degradable property. Glycerol has also been found to be a relatively cheap and effective substrate for the generation of hydrogen under fermentative processes. Ito et al. [5] have worked on the generation of hydrogen from manufacturing wastes which contained glycerol using Enterobacter aerogenes HU-101. They reported that the yields of hydrogen had increased with the concentrations of glycerol and that the rates of hydrogen generation were significantly higher with the pure glycerol at the same concentration in comparison with other substrates they had analyzed in their work. Ito et al. [5] calculated a peak rate of hydrogen generation of 80mmol/L/h from pure glycerol. Selembo et al. [6] reported that the fermentation of glycerol had resulted in the generation of 0.28mol hydrogen/mol-glycerol. Seifert et al. [7] studied the effect of glycerol concentration on the hydrogen production under dark fermentative conditions in batch experiments. Seifert et al. [7] reported that the maximum hydrogen yield had reached 0.41mol hydrogen for every mole of glycerol and this performance had been possible with 10g/L of glycerol in aqueous medium. Seifert et al. [7] also reported that higher concentrations of glycerol of up to 30g/L had produced more effective hydrogen production reaching 0.7LH2/L of medium. Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck [8] demonstrated that Rhodopseudomonas palustris is able to convert pure and crude glycerol into hydrogen using photofermentation, and reported high yields of reaching as high as 6mol hydrogen for every mole of glycerol. One interesting result from this work of Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck [8] was that crude glycerol had readily produced hydrogen with no constraint of toxicity and inhibition. Maru et al. [9] have reported the fermentation of glycerol using T. maritima in batch chemostat units obtained a peak yield in the tune of 0.8mol hydrogen/ mol glycerol. Maru et al. [10] have later further investigated the potential of producing biohydrogen from glycerol using Enterobacter spH1, Enterobacter spH2, and Citrobacter freundii H3 and found that with a starting concentration of 20g/L for the glycerol substrate, all the bacterial strains had yielded very high amounts of hydrogen in the range of 2400–3500mL/L. Liu et al. [11] proved that glycerol purification does not necessarily improve the production dynamics of hydrogen during anaerobic fermentative processes. Pachapur et al. [12] have recently studied the co-fermentation of crude glycerol with apple pomace hydrolysate, and reported that with the hydrolysate, the oxidative mechanistic route had been favored to give a higher hydrogen generation at 26.07mmol/L and a lowering in the levels of by-products formation. A continuous production of biohydrogen from crude glycerol using an anaerobic up-flow column bioreactor (UFCB) has been reported earlier [13]. In the latter study, the maximum biohydrogen generation was 107.3±0.7L/kg waste glycerol under optimal conditions was reported [13]. Fountoulakis et al. [14] reported that supplementation of crude glycerol with olive mill wastewater and slaughterhouse wastewater increases methane and hydrogen production. Hydrogen yield was increased from 15mmolH2/g VS to 26mmolH2/g VS added after the addition of glycerol. Recently Zahedi et al. [15] demonstrated that almost doubled hydrogen production and specific hydrogen production rates were achieved after addition of 1% v/v crude glycerol to the industrial municipal solid waste under dark fermentation in batch mode. Sharma et al. [16] reported the bioenergy production in the form of hydrogen and electricity from pure glycerol and glycerol derived from biodiesel waste streams using microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and hydrogen producing bioreactors (HPBs). The maximum hydrogen production 0.20molH2/mol glycerol and 0.17–0.18molH2/mol glycerol from pure glycerol and glycerol from biodiesel waste stream, respectively. Trchounian et al. [17] have demonstrated that Escherichia coli wild type BW25113 has occasioned significantly improved biohydrogen generation yields from glycerol (up to 0.77mmol/L) when the biosynthesis was assisted by combinations of the following micronutrients: Ni2+, Fe3+ and Mo6+. Maru et al. [18] reported that a mixed culture of Enterobacter spH1 and E. coli CECT432 has produced a 3.1-fold more pronounced yield of biohydrogen when crude glycerol has been fermented under dark conditions. Cofré et al. [19] have studied recently the bioconversion of crude glycerol into biohydrogen by Escherichia coli MG1655 and reported having achieved almost complete consumption of the glycerol to reach a final biohydrogen yield of 0.56mol/mol crude glycerol fed to the system. Very recently, Valle et al. [20] have developed a unique metabolic engineering approach and demonstrated a considerable enhancement in the production of biohydrogen from glycerol using E. coli which had been accompanied by the redirection of C4 metabolites. Soo et al. [21] have also used a genetically engineered type of recombinant E. coli (having “hycE and recombinant E. coli with hydA”) and demonstrated that there had been a significantly larger biohydrogen yield of up to 20% when glycerol has been metabolized. During dark fermentation of glycerol, along with hydrogen acetate, butyrate, ethanol, and 1,3-propanediol (PDO) are also produced which are used for the regeneration of NADH and to maintain respiratory balance. Moreover generation of these byproducts adversely affected hydrogen production which is a main challenge of glycerol hydrogen production. However efficient conversion of glycerol to hydrogen can be achieved by developing metabolic H2 generating pathways and bioreactor configuration and also by optimizing various operational parameters. The general importance of feedstock properties in the biohydrogen-producing fermentation reactions lies on the fact that gas production performances are in direct relationship with the accessibility to carbohydrates present. Therefore, if the abundant lignocellulosic materials – containing fermentable sugars in complex and hardly digestible forms – are to be employed for biohydrogen production, the support of sugar release through adapted physical, chemical and biological pretreatment methods or their combinations may be mandatory. It is important to realize the knowledge about the feasibility of lignocellulose wastes to molecular hydrogen gas production, since their characteristic complex and dynamic nature vary depending on their origin. Moreover, the pretreatments applied in order to recover the sugar content have their own specificity in accomplishing the desired extent of cell disruption and concomitantly ensure the sufficient release of hydrolysable sugars to be metabolized to hydrogen. Lignocellulose biomass represents the major percentage of wastes in many industrial processes and its constant availability is an advantage both for biofuel research and a potential (but slow) market penetration via fully developed biofuel production and bio refinery (value added chemicals) schemes [4,22,23]. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) to hydrogen conversion is quite emerging as we could see from a search conducted in “Scopus” with the specific keywords of “lignocellulose” and “biohydrogen” provided the result of 122 documents (articles, reviews and book chapters) over the last five years, with a notably huge increase in last year with 24 documents, indicating a profound interest and progress in this research field. The “Bioresource Technology” journal could be ranked as No. 1 in the list with a publication record of 42 documents followed by the “International Journal of Hydrogen Energy” journal with 10 documents reported. For a country-based comparison of publications related to “lignocellulose” and “biohydrogen”, “China” hits the first place in the list with 28 articles, while the United States of America with 21 reports comes behind. In terms of the institutes taking part in this research activity, the “Harbin Institute of Technology, China” and the “INRA - Institut National de La Recherche Agronomique, France” were found on the top of the list. Other details regarding the publication records in this scientific area are illustrated in Fig. 1. Interestingly, as a result of the specific search, Asian countries (other than China) such as Korea, Japan and Taiwan appear with less research interest in this bioenergy sector. One plausible reason could be the challenges related to land limitation and availability of quality substrates/feedstocks for developing the research towards an industrial scale. A consolidated scheme for the conversion of LCB to H2 and other energy carriers, with additional processes and benefits is presented in Fig. 2. Additionally, the number of patents applied to the biohydrogen technologies are progressing in a positive manner with respect to advanced pretreatment methods for higher sugar recovery from LCB, artificial enzymatic pathways, biological pretreatment methods for cellulose conversion, hybrid systems, electrochemical systems, making carbohydrates more amenable to cellulose degrading enzymes and various other schemes. A number of works with valuable progress related to “lignocellulosic biomass for hydrogen production” earned US patents and are detailed in Table 1. The major issues with the pretreatment technologies for LCB in terms of cost and process difficulties (inhibitor formation and removal) along with the continuous operation are the barriers limiting the verity of LCB-H2 scenario. Knowledge gap between the bio refinery (pretreatment, upstream) and product recovery- here H2 (fermentation and valorization of unhydrolysed biomass, downstream) should be addressed to make the LCB-H2 sustainable and viable. Altogether, these achievements enlighten well that LCB to H2 conversion receives/deserves significant attention and provide the motivation to write this review article on the recent developments in the pretreatment, inhibitor formation and removal mechanisms. The paper deals firstly with the issues related to lignocellulose raw materials and thereafter the advancements made (e.g. for developing integrated pretreatment and neutralization via detoxification of inhibitors) in promoting the desired performance of biological hydrogen formation are assessed. Overall, the present discourse aims to revisit (i) the progress lately made in pretreatment methods (advanced methodologies) for lignocellulosic biomass to hydrogen conversion by dark fermentation (ii) the attempts that have been made to reach sufficient cellulose hydrolysis (iii) major detoxification methods adopted for the inhibitor removal along with their mechanism lethal to the bacterial cells (iv) continuous reactor operation aspects and (v) valorization and utilization of the unhydrolysed biomass resulted from the pretreatment process. This review article contains highlights on the future perspectives and research avenues to be probed further."
1,Lignocellulosic biomass conversion to hydrogen (LCB-H2) pretreatment: current status,"Lignocellulosic biomass, the second largest component on Earth after water, in the forms of plants, woods and other natural vegetation is composed mainly of three substances, namely: 1) Cellulose, the homogenous carbohydrate polymer (building solely up from glucose) in the core, 2) Hemicellulose, the branchy and heterogeneous polymer molecule (principally containing C5 and C6 sugars i.e. xylose, arabinose, mannose, etc.) in the middle layer, and 3) Lignin, the rigid, non-sugar-based heteropolymer in the outer regions. The C6 and C5 sugar source of cellulose and hemi/holocellulose are protected by lignin, making these materials more recalcitrant to biodegradation in nature [22]. Besides, the cellulosic/lignocellulosic biomass could be distinguished into various generations (1–3rd or 1–4th) based on the characteristics. Some authors have reported that algal biomass could be the 3 or 4th generation biomass and might be used to solve certain (bio)energy issues because of their high lipid/carbohydrate content and large/fast growth capacities [23]. The conversion of raw LCB to hydrogen has been evaluated by various researchers in order to reduce the cost during the pretreatment process. However, H2 production yields and rates attained were relatively low due to the refractory traits of the starting material, presenting a hurdle towards hydrolysis, solubilization and efficient fermentable sugar release [24,25]. Subsequently, research has streamlined the pretreatments to obtain enhanced hydrolysis methods for the high-yield recovery of sugars as the primary feedstock for H2 production by dark fermentation. Dark-fermentation reactions which yield biohydrogen from biomass derivatives are very complex and follow different mechanisms and metabolic activities. These mechanisms are also variable subject to the specific operational conditions imposed to the process. There are essentially two main routes for the production of biohydrogen under dark fermentative regimes Chong et al. [26]. Grossman et al. [27] have explained that carbohydrate stored as cellular material are metabolized to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the reduced pyridine nucleotide which is concomitantly generated has to be oxidized again in order to have the fermentation mechanisms active. Unless the reoxidation is sustained, hydrogen synthesis will be severely impeded. According to Chong et al. [26], these two mechanistic pathways are the acetate pathway and butyrate route. The pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase significantly facilitates the cleavage of the pyruvate species to the corresponding formation of acetyl-CoA, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In this mechanistic route, a fraction of the electrons is transferred to protons to ultimately produce biohydrogen and the portion to NAD+ to produce NADH2. Subsequently, Chong et al. [26] explain that NADH2 is further metabolized to produce the hydrogen in the second route which in mediated by the hydrogenase species wherein electrons are transferred to the ferredoxin species and immediately after to H+. Hay et al. [28] have also elucidated the mechanism of hydrogen production by Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae. Hay et al. [28] have deduced that in a first set of biochemical reactions, pyruvate is synthesized through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas route and then split into formate and acetyl-CoA by pyruvate formate-lyase enzymes in the absence of oxygen. Still according to Hay et al. [28], the next step involves the breakdown of the formate into molecular carbon dioxide and hydrogen by formate hydrogenlyase in acidic medium. d'Ippolito et al. [29] attribute the mechanisms of hydrogen generation under dark fermentative conditions to the catabolic activities on sugars. Based on the analysis of d'Ippolito et al. [29], the Embden–Meyerhoff mechanistic route appears to be the main glycolytic pathway through which hydrogen is synthesized. Maru et al. [9] have concluded that the mechanism for the biodegradation of glycerol by Thermotoga maritima to produce hydrogen follows a combined route comprising the Entner-Doudoroff and Embden-Meyerhof pathways when using glucose as growth media. More details of this combined mechanism may be obtained from Maru et al.[9], but put in a nutshell, the latter workers observed that oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate was significantly enhanced by an NAD+ dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Detailed pretreatment procedures and possibilities have been explained in earlier reports elsewhere [30], while a list of conventional pretreatment methods that have been used for the extraction of sugars from LCB can be seen in Table 2. Each method have their advantage and drawbacks, as most commonly practiced methods include the weak acid/alkali hydrolysis which are cost effective, but, generate more amount of inhibitors which are lethal to the anaerobic microbes. Other methods (milling and irradiation) might not effectively remove the lignin part and result in the very low production rate and yield. More details about the conventional pretreatment methods are discussed in the earlier reviews and research reports [3,22,31]. Advanced pretreatment methods such as SHF and SSF are briefly overviewed in a recent review [30]. The inoculum source chosen in most of the studies have been a mixed culture, containing therefore both cellulolytic and hydrogen fermentative bacteria, for example, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, Coprothermobacter and Lactobacillus species, Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridium pasteurianum-like, Clostridium saccharobutylicum, Enterobacter aerogens, Clostridium paraputrificum, Bacteroidetes, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, Thermoanaerobacter subteraneus, Caloromator australicus sp., Escherichia coli, Selenomonas, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia fergusonii, Thermotoga neapolitana, Thermotoga maritima, Clostridium tyrobutyricum FYa102, Enterobacter hormaechei and Biohydrogenbacterium R3. Such combination of the abovementioned bacterial populations is reportedly a key to realize better hydrogen production efficiency [32] and could hence notably support the appropriate lignocellulose to hydrogen transformation, especially after viable pretreatment methods. The enhancement in hydrogen production after suitable pretreatment(s) could be attributed to the higher amount bio convertible carbohydrates available to the consortium of suitable microorganisms and their enzymes catalyzing the hydrogen formation by the anaerobic metabolism. Thus, the improvement of C5 and C6 sugars release from LCB via pretreatment is a critical step for scaled-up H2 fermentation 22, 32]. Traditionally, Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF) has been used for H2 production but due to its economic and technological constraints (e.g. the need of excessive chemicals, operation in multiple reactors), alternative processes have been developed. In the recent years, options such as Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) and Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) [33,34] have been proposed and are based on advanced pretreatment methods and in particular cases, bioengineered microorganisms."
2,Bottlenecks in hydrogen production from LCB during pretreatment,
3,Inhibitor formation,"3.1 Inhibitor formation Almost regardless of the methods (Table 2) and their conditions for LCB pretreatment, the formation of inhibitors that pose a threat on the H2 producing organisms seems to be a general phenomenon [35,36] and consequently, mitigation of these toxic substances is a necessary step for longer-term and successful reactor operation [37]. The potentially formed inhibitory by-products to take into account during physicochemical pretreatments are furan-derivatives (furfural, 5-hydroxy methyl furufural (5-HMF)) coming from the transformation of C5 and C6 sugars found in cellulose and hemicellulose fractions, carbonic acids (methanoic acid, ethanoic acid and levulinic acid) and phenolic-compounds attached to lignin degradation such as vanillin, syringaldehyde, etc., as supported by data in Table 3. The concentrations and distribution of such secondary products depends mainly on (i) the harshness of pretreatment conditions (i.e. temperature, pressure, exposure time, the chemical(s) used and their concentration) as well as, (ii) the origin and composition of the feedstock [36]. The main mode of inhibition on anaerobic hydrogen producing microbial communities can be explained in few different ways, as follows: 1. Undissociated forms of weak acids penetrate the microbial cells by diffusion and decrease the intracellular pH, leading to a drop in hydrogen production. 2. Furanic components interfere with glycolytic enzyme synthesis and suppress biomass growth. 3. Phenolic compounds negatively influence cell communications and damage the cell membranes [36,38] As shown in Table 3, the threshold inhibition concentrations of the by-products released during the pretreatment steps are quite specific to the type of the microorganism applied as inoculum. For instance, a pure culture could be relatively less tolerant and receives a more serious inhibitory effect on the cell growth causing a prolonged lag phase [39], while mixed populations could be more robust and thus, are able to withstand better against growth inhibition because of the diversified microbial communities and conversion of the toxic inhibitors to less toxic forms [38,40,41]. Among the inhibitory compounds, the phenolic- and furan-based ones are considered as the most dangerous for cell proliferation and hydrogen evolution as communicated by many earlier reports, while the organic acids (acetic, formic, and levulinic acid) being responsible for imbalanced cell properties are slightly less toxic (Table 3). In comparison with methane fermentation, the lignocellulosic-derived inhibitors more significantly affect the hydrogen fermentation. For instance, in the former process, LCB derived inhibitors with a concentration of 2g/L syringaldehyde, vanillin, hydroxy methyl furfural (HMF) and furfural were fairly converted into methane without effecting anaerobic digestion performance. This could be linked to the complexity of the microbial diversity which aided in breakdown of the molecules into their non-toxic form and subsequent utilization by the living biocatalysts [42]. For improvement of hydrogen production from the hydrolysates delivered from LCB, the selective adaption/enrichment of the microorganism to grow in the presence of these inhibitors together with the continuous monitoring of the metabolic activities of the microbial species involved in the conversion processes can be a worthwhile strategy. Liu et al. [41] have analyzed the effects of the derivatives of furan in the performance of fermentative biohydrogen production using steam-pretreated cornstalk, and reported that biohydrogen productivity has risen to reach almost 40% with the addition of HMF, which had favored a larger fraction of Clostridium and Ruminococcaceae, that enhanced the biohydrogen generation kinetics. Akobi et al. [43] have shown that concentration of less than 1000mg/L of furfural could be limiting in enhancing the production of biohydrogen. Lin et al. [44] have investigated the influences of surfactants on the fermentative biohydrogen production using spent mushroom compost substrates using C. thermocellum inoculum. The work of Lin et al. [44] has also helped in elucidating the key pathways for biohydrogen generation under the specific conditions of the experiments and it was indicated that the yield could be altered favorably with a shift in the type of microbes used and their respective metabolic actions on the substrates in the presence of one type of surfactant. Hay et al. [28] have indicated that bacteria involved in fermentative processes are much pH dependent and also susceptible to temperature changes, as a result of which they tend to equally shift their metabolic activities and growth patterns. Sen et al. [45] have recently concluded a study on the different experimental conditions which affect the biokinetics of biohydrogen production from rice straw. Their results indicated the following key aspects: 0.8–1.0mol/L of hydrochloric acid had produced a high yield of sugar utilization of up to 52.9% and iron (III) chloride could not improve the sugar yield for any subsequent conversion to hydrogen and/or ethanol. Zhang et al. [46] have used a mixed culture of Clostridium cellulolyticum and non-cellulolytic biohydrogen generation microorganisms in the production of biohydrogen from steam-pretreated corn stover and calculated a maximum biohydrogen yield which peaked at 51.9L hydrogen/kg total solids. The work of Zhang et al. [46] also demonstrated that otherwise inhibitory compounds, namely formate, could be metabolized to biohydrogen. Antonopoulou et al. [47] found that pretreatment with alkali at 20g sodium hydroxide for every 100g of total solids of sunflower straw gave an optimal set of conditions which favored the highest average biohydrogen production yield of 155.3L/kg TS. However, they also reported that under the same organic loading conditions, acid pretreatment had impeded the biohydrogen generation yields as a result of inhibitory species formation. Detoxification methods could be highly recommended and are discussed in the next sections."
4,Effects of inhibitors on microbial activity and carboxylic acids production,"3.2 Effects of inhibitors on microbial activity and carboxylic acids production Although the inhibitory side-products greatly influence the overall metabolic pathways, microbial communities as well as the hydrogen production performances [36], a limited number of studies were carried out on these aspects by employing molecular biological techniques such as polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), capillary electrophoresis-single strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP), and 454 Pyrosequencing. In example by [38,48,49], the alteration of acetate- and butyrate-dominated fermentation pathways and moreover, a shift in the microbial community pattern were observed by the addition of furanic (furfural and HMF), phenolic (phenol, syringaldehyde, vanillin) and lignitic (kraft lignin and organosolv lignin) derivatives to the media. In another report by Monlau et al. [50] it was presented that H2 fermentation from glucose and fractions of the dilute-acid pretreated sunflower stalk hydrolysate – containing furans (1.15g/L of furfural, 0.13g/L of 5-HMF), weak organic acids (0.6g/L of formic acid and 0.81g/L of acetate) and 0.02g/L of phenolic compounds – was significantly reduced with gradually increased amounts of diluted acid hydrolysate. Furthermore, a diversion of metabolic pathways from acetate and butyrate to non-hydrogen producing ones (lactate and ethanol) and a clear shift of dominant microbial populations from Clostridium sp. to Sporolactobacillus sp. took place. This demonstrates a very unique form of process inhibition to the biohydrogen-producing bacterial populations by more hydrolysates and a strong influence on the secretion of the carboxylic acids and solvents. It was portrayed by another lately report that the inhibitory concentration of the by-products could vary with the type of the substrates [35]. For instance, the half maximal inhibitor concentrations (IC50) of the formic acid on glucose and galactose were 12.50g/L and 2.99g/L, respectively, whereas similar values (1.55g/L and 1.33g/L) were determined with levulinic acid, which implies the impact of the substrate on the significance and mode of inhibition. Nonetheless, both organic acids caused a severe inhibition trend on hydrogen production with a considerable shift in the metabolic pathways from acetate/butyrate to lactate/propionate. Recently, Eker and Warp [51] concluded that the biohydrogen yield recorded during the fermentation of waste paper had decreased when the higher initial sugar concentrations were set. Eker and Warp [51] attributed this decline in process performance to the production of volatile fatty acids. Organic acids which are concomitantly produced within the hydrogen-producing fermentative metabolic pathways determine the pH of the reaction medium at different stages of the process. Indeed, pH is considered as one of the most pivotal parameters for generating biohydrogen due to its effect on hydrogenase activity, substrate hydrolysis and metabolic pathways Kumar et al. [52]. A weakly acidic pH is a vital operating parameter for the generation of biohydrogen gas, but it is tough to propose appropriate suitable operational range. pH is connected to the anaerobic fermentation pathways [30,53]. Many workers are unanimous on the prevalence of the butyrate and ethanol fermentation pathways can generate hydrogen but are much pH-dependent. Moreover, with high hydraulic retention times in reactor, weakly acidic conditions do not significantly inhibit methanogenic activity [53,54]. In general, a pH less than 5 will tend to induce some form of inhibition to the onset and progress of methanogenic activity in anaerobic biochemical reactions bringing about the generation of biohydrogen gas [55]. Various studies have been evaluated to fix the optimal pH range for fermentative biohydrogen generation. However, the results are often unpredictable due to differences in substrates, operating conditions and seed sludge [56,57]. Low pH inhibits hydrogenase activity during fermentative biohydrogen generation [53,58]. pH in the range 4.5–6.0 favors acetate and butyrate production, while neutral or higher pH promotes ethanol and propionate production [59]. Moreover, pH less than 6 tends much to inhibit methanogenic reactions and equally affects the activity of the hydrogenase enzyme under both thermophilic and mesophilic conditions in a mixed culture [53]. De Gioannis et al.[24] nevertheless also indicated that under thermophilic conditions, and at an initial pH of 5.5, only the inhibition of hydrogen consuming homoacetogenic activity can be achieved. pH also influences the metabolic pathways for biohydrogen generation because it directly affects hydrogenase activity. It is relatively well documented in the literature that acetate and butyrate are main final products during biohydrogen synthesis. A neutral pH fosters the acetate pathway, whereas an acidic medium favors the butyrate pathway. All the more, the initial pH affects biohydrogen generation through its influence on the lag phase duration, synthesis of enzymes and spore germination [37]. It has also been found that an initial pH of 4.5 yielded more biohydrogen when using sucrose and starch, but this experimental condition was accompanied by a very low generation rate and long overall process duration; and at a higher initial pH, high hydrogen generation rates were observed with shorter lag-phases [3]. Abreu et al. [60] demonstrated the generation of biohydrogen from arabinose at different initial pH (4.5–8.0), and it found that at a high initial pH, more hydrogen was produced. According to Wongthanate et al. [61], biohydrogen was generated from organic acids under the following optimum conditions: uncontrolled pH (4.4–7.0), mesophilic condition (35°C) and thermophilic condition (50°C). They also reported that a pH of 6.5 and under the mesophilic conditions, 0.28L/L of hydrogen gas was generated. Wongthanate et al. [61] had also indicated that the initial pH dropped to 4.7 after 7 days of fermentation and acid accumulation had started and eventually affected pH, which thence inhibited biohydrogen generation. Lin et al. [40] investigated the inhibitory effects of phenolic species and furan derivatives when glucose was used as substrate. However, their outcomes is different from another report by [38], and showed furan derivatives showed a least inhibition trend than the phenol derivatives and degraded completely after 72h of the fermentation. The metabolic pathway was not affected with the respective inhibitors added, which followed acetate-butyrate mediated fermentative pathway, however the mol HAc/HBu ratio was greatly influenced with least value of 0.94 obtained with glucose+furfural followed by 1.09 with glucose+HMF, 1.21 with glucose+syringaldehyde, and 1.24 with glucose+vanillin, respectively. Recently, the advanced molecular biological tool, 454 pyrosequencing-aided monitoring of hydrogen producing community changes related to the addition of inhibitory by-products was assessed to deliver a better understanding about the key populations involved in the degradation of the by-products and showed their resistance to the toxic agents [36]. Interestingly, Liu et al. [41] showed that the addition of HMF promotes hydrogen productivity over 40% than the steam-exploded corn stalk hydrolyzate, however, the furfural showed severe inhibition trend on hydrogen production even with a least dosage of 0.1g/L. The addition of HMF enhanced the hydrogen production as well as the total carboxylic acids concentration; however the solvent concentration dropped until the additional dosage of 0.1–1g/L, further increment leads to the increased solvent production and drop in hydrogen production. On the other hand, the addition of furfural leads to a shift in acetate-butyrate pathway to the propionate forming pathway. The microbial findings showed that the distribution of microbial communities varied with the type of the furan derivatives. For the HMF amended culture the abundance of Anaerolineaceae sp accounted for 13.8%, Clostridium sp. (11.7%), Ruminococcaceae sp. (6.85%), Lactobacillus sp. (5.75%), and Leptolinea sp. (4.8%) respectively, with enhanced hydrogen production, whereas the furfural amended culture showed a remarkable drop in Clostridium sp. (3.94%) and Ruminococcaceae sp. (1.62%), with an increase in Anaerolineaceae sp (18.91%) and Leptolinea sp. (6.56%). These outcomes clearly suggested that the hydrogen production microbial communities varied with the types of the feedstock, inhibitor by-products and resulted in varied hydrogen productivity and secretion of the soluble metabolic end products. Gonzales et al. [62] have tested empty palm fruit bunch, and pine tree wood and rice husk for their potential to produce biohydrogen under acidic fermentative conditions and reported that the peak average biohydrogen generation rates reached 1.5L hydrogen/L.day, 1.6L hydrogen/L.day and 1.8L hydrogen/L.day for the latter substrates respectively. Gonzales et al. [63] studied the impacts of dilute acid pretreatment on the fermentative biohydrogen production using empty palm fruit bunch, pine tree wood and rice husk substrates, and their results showed that the most of sugars could be produced for a pretreatment time of 60min but there was no clear confirmation that such conditions corresponded to maximum biohydrogen generation. Ghimire et al. [3] also analyzed the biohydrogen production performance of a number of waste biomass with an anaerobic sludge inoculum spiked with sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid as the inhibitor, and they inferred that under the conditions of experimentation imposed in their work biohydrogen generation kinetics followed a combination of fermentation mechanism. The summary of the above mentioned reports illustrated that the impacts of the by-products visualize significant influence on the hydrogen generation; the adverse impression is depending on the concentration of these materials, inoculum nature, and threshold tolerance ability of the specific microbial community. Monitoring the microbial assisted secretion products and community profiling is essential for obtaining the better bioprocess control to attain the promising utilization of the low-cost feedstock for sustainable hydrogen production."
5,Reactor (Continuous) operation: types and parameter considerations,"A comprehensive analysis of various reactor designs and configurations and the difficulties associated with their operation is provided in Table 4. The main parameters during the continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operations are hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR). These parameters influence the retention of the feedstock either in the form of raw or pretreated hydrolysate inside the bioreactor environment. For a successful operation of a H2 fermentative production system, it must be, in principle, no less than a continuous process as mentioned in many reports [64,65]. Recently, a review has been published focusing on the reactor designs for the fermentative hydrogen production from wastewaters [66] and also for organic wastes [59]. However, optimum (not to say, as desired) reactor design for LCB to hydrogen schemes is quite complicated and moreover the parameters involved in the design process considerations are particularly different from those considered when handling organic wastewaters or liquid streams with less inhibitors as substrates. LCB could be used mainly in two different ways for the continuous operation, and these are firstly as raw LCB, and secondly as in the form of the pretreated hydrolysate. The main parameters and difficulties to be considered for this operation are summarized in Table 4. The major issues that govern the process performance of the raw LCB are the particle size [32], unhydrolysed cellulose which is difficult for many H2 producers, and high solid or lignin content [1]. These process parameters induce serious disturbances in the dynamics of the designed hydrogen production schemes, but could be solved partly using the hydrolytic and cellulolytic symbiotic relationship of the consortia earlier (See [67]). However, often obtaining these combined consortia is a tedious task and demands much laborious efforts. Additionally, it could be possible only within the thermophilic temperature range and it would be still energy-intensive due to the lower yield and digestion rate of LCB [32,67]. Sequencing batch reactor operation is generally suggested for this type of process because the high solids level could block the pipelines of the feedstock tank, if it is continuously fed (Table 4). When considering the pretreated hydrolyzate, a continuously stirred tank reactor operation would be possible. However, the mitigation or sequestration of the inhibitor compounds produced during the hydrolysis process should be considered before the start-up of the process, since, the inhibitor compounds are toxic to fermentative microbial consortia as reported earlier in [35,68]. In addition, other parameters such as pH neutralizing agents, which are generally Cao, Ca(OH) or Na (OH) for acid hydrolysis and HCl, H2SO4 for alkali hydrolysis have swelling effects on the cellulose biomass remaining after the pretreatment as reported in [69]. Also, the detoxification and neutralization methods require a lot of chemicals and leave ions such as Na+, Cl– and SO4 2– in the hydrolysate which may induce toxicity to the hydrogen producing bacteria and ultimately result in the lower production performance. Apart from SBR and CSTR operations, there are other types of reactors which have been used to produce hydrogen from LCB (See Table 4 for more details). These issues should be researched/addressed further to make LCB-H2 sustainable and economically feasible."
6,Remedies and opportunities for amelioration of LCB-H2,"Pretreated hydrolysates generate significant quantities of inhibitor compounds namely phenolics, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), weak acids, metals and chemicals. Hence, it is a prerequisite to detoxify the reaction mixture from these compounds and this may be done using various chemical, physical and biological methods [70] prior to the actual hydrogen production reactions involved in the fermentative pathway. Quemeneur et al. [38] studied the effects of lignocellulosic-derived inhibitory compounds on hydrogen generation by fermentation using xylose under the effect of mixed microbial cultures. Their findings suggested that furan derivatives (furfural and HMF) at 1g/L concentrations had more significant inhibition on hydrogen production (H2 yield on 0.51mol/molxylose compared to 1.67mol/molxylose without furfural) than phenolic (phenol, syringaldehyde and vanillin) compounds (H2 yield on 1.28mol/molxylose compared to 1.67mol/molxylose). Besides, the microbial community analysis results in this work itself showed that microbial community pattern had also significantly been affected by the inhibitors compounds. In the control experiments with Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinkii and Clostridium cellulosi being the dominant species, whereas in the presence of inhibitor compounds the Clostridium acetobutylicum populations were significantly affected. Chang et. al [71] and Park et. al [72] observed no hydrogen production from sulfuric acid pretreated hydrolysates of rice straw and red-algal (Gelidium amansii) biomass, whilst further detoxification with calcium hydroxide and activated carbon showed the enhanced hydrogen production performances in the mixed culture system. Pan et al. [73] reported the hydrogen production process from acid (H2SO4) treated cornstalk neutralized with diluted NaOH solution had given a hydrogen yield of 22.1mL/g-TVS by mixed culture. Chu et al. [74] used anionic resin to remove the sulphate ion and controlled sulphate concentration under 1g/L from the pretreated hydrolysate of cotton and demonstrated that hydrogen production could reach 0.99mol/mol reducing sugar. Monlau et al. [50] investigated hydrogen production from glucose and applied different diluted fractions 4–35%) of acid treated hydrolysate containing furans (1.15g/L of furfural, 0.13g/L of 5-HMF), weak acids (0.6g/L of formic acid and 0.81g/L of acetate) and 0.02g/L of phenolic compounds. They concluded that the hydrogen yields had been significantly affected (H2 yield had dropped from 2.04mol/molhexose to 0mol/molhexose) with increased concentrations of diluted acid hydrolysate over 15% and there had also been a clear shift of dominant microbial populations from Clostridium sp. to Sporolactobacillus sp. thereby implying an inhibition to the microbial activity of the biohydrogen-producing bacteria after having added more of the hydrolysates. Orozco et al. [75] investigated the hydrogen production from untreated and detoxified (activated carbon treated) starch (pretreated with hot compressed water assisted CO2) hydrolysate and demonstrated a 70% improvement in the hydrogen production performance (0.38mol/molhexose) in comparison with the untreated (0.14mol/molhexose) hydrolysates. They also indicated that the significant removal of 5-HMF from 42.3mmol/L to 5.2mmol/L (over 86%) resulted in the enhanced hydrogen production performance than in the case of the untreated one. Li et al. [76] investigated the hydrogen production dynamics from mushroom waste in a two-step acid hydrolysis scheme which was subject to detoxification conditions with anionic resin. They reported that a hydrogen production rate of 4.38L/L.day. Datar et al. [77] studied hydrogen generation from corn stover biomass initially pretreated by steam-explosion under a detoxification regime of over-liming with calcium hydroxide in view to eliminate the lignin-derived phenolics. Their findings concluded a hydrogen yield of 3.0mol/molhexose. Cheng et al. [78] investigated the effects of domestication and detoxification to improve the hydrogen production from water hyacinth. Their specific results evidenced an improvement in the hydrogen production rates (from 2.0L/L.day to 2.3L/L.day) when compared with untreated activated carbon hydrolysates. Nissila et al. [69] investigated the effects of various detoxification agents (solid Ca(OH)2, liquid Ca(OH)2 and solid CaO) on the use of acid treated conifer pulp for hydrogen production. Their work showed that liquid Ca(OH)2 had removed the sulphate to less than 30mg/L and had also significantly improved the hydrogen yield by over 30% in comparison to the process performance using solid Ca(OH)2 and CaO. Based on the above mentioned research findings, it became evident to infer that detoxification of pretreated hydrolysates is much recommended for bringing about a stable and efficient hydrogen production regime. In addition, the detoxification methods also tend to, at times, decrease or, on other instances, increase the volume of the hydrolysates. For example, the addition of calcium hydroxide forms solid crystals, which lower the volume of the hydrolysates. But on the hand, diluted NaOH treatment resulted in incremental volumes of the hydrolysates. The selection of one type of detoxification method is guided by the type and origin of the hydrolysate and the specific strains of microorganisms bringing about the fermentation reactions. Besides, diluted hydrolysates can be concentrated using evaporative processes under mild temperature conditions."
7,Perspectives and research directions,"The use of lignocellulosic biomass for biohydrogen generation by fermentation can be a feasible option when compared to effluents used as feedstocks due to their abundance and ease in handling and pre-processing. However, extrusion is required for the lignocellulosic biomass to be prepared for the application of the pretreatment method(s) and subsequent hydrolysis processes for an exhaustive retrieval of the useful sugars, yet at the expense of more capital cost and processing time [79]. Hence, the appropriate pretreatment method has to be carefully assessed for individual type of lignocellulosic biomass, and then combinations of optimal standalone pretreatment methods for combinations of LCB. The pool of qualitative data and numerical findings thus obtained from such multifactorial experimental design on the bioprocess dynamics and performance will surely aid to narrow down to the best suited scenario(s) of optimized process conditions, all of the latter exercise and data filtering aiming to improve the hydrogen production rates and yield, as well as reducing toxic by-products formation and curbing their effects. The biohydrogen production performances are hindered by the toxic compounds, and thus detoxification strategies like the use of activated carbon, ion exchange resins, advanced oxidation process and calcium hydroxide should be considered to reduce the unfavorable impacts of toxicity on cell growth and hydrogen productivity [80,81]. Another suitable option to this end is the usage of fungal and enzymatic pretreatment to restrict the formation of inhibitory compounds. The main issues with the continuous process are the presence and/or induction of inhibitors (such as 5-HMF, furfural, phenolic compounds) and their mitigation, the extent of adaptation and acclimatization of the microorganisms strains to the chemical composition, physical conditions and viscous nature of the hydrolysates. However, testing such materials in continuously operated bioreactors is of remarkable research interest at bench scale and surely at pilot scale [82]. At these scales of operations, the biodegradation features such as variations of volatile fatty acids concentrations [83] and the corresponding process indicators, namely H2 production rate and yield, will probably help capture the significant and sensitive differences in process performance when compared at different scales. The left over biomass (unhydrolysed biomass, so called UHB) after the pretreatment process could be used for the pyrolysis or the gasification process to recover some more energy. However, the net energy gain should be calculated to conduct constructive research on this aspect. Based on a research by Kumar et al. [84], the unhydrolysed de-oiled jatropha waste (DJW) biomass having the high heat value (HHV) of 5.2kcal/kg [84]. This indicates that a ‘zero waste concept’ should be applied to recover more valuable products even at the final steps of the process. The possible ways of the leftover biomass utilization is provided in Fig. 3. Generally, after the pretreatment process, the left over biomass (UHB) is moist due to the chemical agents involved. The drying process could cost more, thus, it could be either sundried or dried in ovens at lower temperatures and then fed into gasifiers. The other possible way to treat the UHB could be by pyrolysis, where a bio-oil is to be obtained. This can be a value-added commodity, and could be used for motors and other vehicles. On the other hand, this bio-oil also can be converted into energy carriers such as hydrogen and methane [85]. This could be an interesting research avenue and be having more economic value. One more feasible way for the utilization of UHB could be its conversion into activated carbon (AC) by chemical activation. Some recent studies have demonstrated the possibility for this conversion [86,87]. AC has various uses in the environmental remediation field and namely as an excellent commercial useful adsorbent for heavy metals and dyes. AC is also used in the detoxification of pre-hydrolysates by absorption of toxic compounds such as furfural, hydroxyl methyl furfural in the hemicellulose hydrolysate of many lignocellulosic/algal biomasses. Besides, AC could be also used in the immobilization process for surface enhancement [72,88]. Additionally, the solid wastes could be directly used for the methane production by anaerobic digestion, which could eventually increase the energy value of the overall process. Bio fertilizer production from the remaining bio-solids could open a new research window for the proper utilization, too. These conversion processes could not only add value to the overall process, but also contribute in lowering the risk of handling waste. Once the research tailbacks associated with the production of hydrogen from LCB using dark fermentation may have been adequately addressed for systems which operate to the desired performance on small scale, the prime challenge will be the upscaling considerations. Fully mastering the bio kinetics of the bench scale LCB-to-biohydrogen reactors will definitely mean much but the hop to developing more voluminous bioreactors which will be able to produce hydrogen in commercially viable volumes will demand intensive collaborations in terms of the disciplines involved to bring the process at an industrial scale. Added to this challenge, are the inherent aspects of process safety in relation to the production processes themselves for the biohydrogen generation, the storage and transfer of the gas into the pipe networks, its mass storage and transportation, thereafter its distribution through usage points and finally its actual use as a green fuel, which is surely when fixing one's focus on its zero emission footprint. Hence, there is much seemingly a need to now initiate the shift from lab-scale biohydrogen production from LCB by fermentation to industrial scale, or to start with more modestly, developing bioreactors which will fit the need of this biofuel supply at the commercial scale, for example, housing estates with a defined number of households of 50, 100 or 150, or for some commercial business or still for use at a university level. The research findings will move hand in hand with the development of the larger bioreactors and the feedbacks of data from each side will be used to fine tune the designs and bioreactor configurations. Added to this shift of production scale, the need to analyze the whole fermentative biohydrogen production and its process intensification (biochemical process route strategy and selection of microbial consortia, solvents to be used, catalysts and mode of catalysis, reagents and substrates preconditioning/preprocessing, stoichiometry of predominant pathway reactions, atom economy considerations, economic model, design of runs for temperature and gas flow controls, reactor type and processing time, mixing and recirculation regimes, material and energy flows and balances, process synthesis and modeling for parameter optimization) from a lifecycle design perspective will be more than required and useful. Fig. 4 provides the useful insights about the maximizing the BioH2 production from LCB in all possible ways and also the parameters to be concerned. Therefore, the next major advancement will reside in being successful to propose green, modular, viable and effective (and possibly patentable) fermentative biohydrogen production schemes using LCB based on validated process flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams and sound cost-benefit analyses. These objectives will be met most fruitfully with the synergistic involvement and efforts of players from the applied research domain and the industry."
8,Conclusions,"The present survey reported the recent trends in LCB pretreatment methods, inhibitor effects and their mitigation routes for the conversion to hydrogen via the dark fermentation. Besides, the key bottlenecks in the conversion processes and possible remedial solutions on how to overcome the issues were also discussed. It may be concluded that a proper selection of the suitable pretreatment or combination of pretreatments and adequate inhibitor removal should be considered in priority for finally enhancing the hydrogen production performances. Additionally, new attempts with properly tailored metabolic engineering techniques to modify the cellulolytic microbiomes for more hydrogenase expression may be undertaken. The possibilities for the utilization of the unhydrolysed biomass after some chemical modification as bioremediation agents retain an altogether promising set of research niche. An important conclusion of the studies reported on hydrogen production from pretreated lignocellulosic organic matter is that most of them have been carried out in batch and research experiences with fully developed (non-bench scale) continuous process are scarce."
