0,Introduction,"Producing chemicals from biomass has received much attention because it is more environmentally friendly than producing them from crude oil [1–3]. Various furanic compounds can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass resources and subsequently used to synthesize many valuable chemicals [4,5]. For example, polysaccharide hemicelluloses in biomass undergo hydrolysis when treated with an acid at elevated temperatures to produce sugar molecules. The sugar molecules can be dehydrated to yield furfural (FFR), which can then be converted to furfuryl alcohol (FFA) by catalytic hydrogenation [6,7]. FFA is typically used to produce resins, foundry binders, fibers, lubricants, and fine chemicals such as lysine or vitamin C [8,9]. Recently, the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated furanic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols has been studied extensively [10–14]. Because furanic aldehydes contain both CC and CO bonds, the CO bond should be selectively hydrogenated while the CC bond is preserved. Cu-Cr alloys with various modifiers have been mainly used for FFR conversion to FFA [15,16]. Bimetallic Pd-Cu [17], Pt-Sn [18], Ni-Sn intermetallic structure [19], Mo-doped Co-B alloys [20], Pt nanoparticles deposited on various supports [21], Co/SBA-15 [22], and Ru/Zr-MOFs [23] have also been reported to have high FFA selectivity in this reaction. Metallic nanoparticles have been widely used for selective catalytic reactions. They are often synthesized using colloidal methods; the metal precursor is reduced in the presence of organic capping agents, which stabilize the nanoparticles when dispersed in solution by decreasing their high surface energies. The surface-capping agents usually block the surface metal sites, resulting in lower activity. However, some recent studies have shown that organic agents can promote certain surface reactions. Medlin et al. showed that thiolate layers adsorbed on Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts enabled the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol and of 1-epoxy-3-butene to 1-epoxybutane [24,25]. Rodionov et al. showed that PtFe alloy nanoparticles with fluorous ligands bound to the Fe surface sites could catalyze cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation to cinnamyl alcohol [26], and Fu et al. showed that this selective hydrogenation reaction could also be catalyzed by Pt3Co alloy nanocrystals with various amine ligands on the surface [27]. It was proposed that the obtained high selectivity was due to steric hindrance, which caused the reactants to adsorb on the surface sites in a specific adsorption mode. In some cases, the organic capping agents even increased the catalytic activity. Zheng et al. showed that capping Pt nanowire surfaces with ethylenediamine changed their electronic structure, enabling the electron-rich Pt catalysts to produce N-hydroxylanilines from nitroaromatics with high activity and selectivity [28]. Miki et al. showed that intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between alkanethiol capping agents on Au nanoparticles and the reactants in silane alcoholysis led to a higher reaction rate [29]. Kunz et al. showed that Pt nanoparticles functionalized with l-proline ligands catalyzed the hydrogenation of acetophenone exclusively to phenyl-1-ethanol with high activity due to the ligand-accelerated hydrogenation of the carbonyl via the NH effect [30]. Zheng et al. showed that Au34Ag28 nanoclusters coated with alkynyl ligands catalyzed hydrolytic triethylsilane oxidation more efficiently than uncapped or partially capped nanoparticles [31]. In this work, capped Ni nanoparticles of various sizes were employed in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated furanic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. The capped Ni nanoparticles, which are much cheaper than precious metal (e.g. Pt and Pd) nanoparticles, could catalyze furanic alcohol production with high selectivity, whereas fully hydrogenated products were obtained when Raney Ni or uncapped Ni nanoparticles were used as the catalyst. The role of the organic layer in the catalytic reaction was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of Ni nanoparticle catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of Ni nanoparticle catalysts Ni nanoparticles of various sizes were prepared by previously reported methods [32,33]. Nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)2; 95%, Sigma-Aldrich), oleylamine (OAm; 70%, Sigma-Aldrich), and trioctylphosphine (TOP; 90%, Sigma-Aldrich) were placed in a 75mL three-necked round-bottom flask and heated at 120°C for 20min in an N2 atmosphere under stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution. The flask was then heated to 220°C in 20min, maintained at this temperature for 2h, and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The resulting nanoparticles were washed with isopropanol (IPA; 99.5%, Samchun) three times, and redispersed in 11mL IPA. The 3.7nm Ni nanoparticles were washed with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of IPA and ethanol (99.9%, Samchun) three times and redispersed in 11mL IPA. The specific amounts of the chemicals used to synthesize the different Ni nanoparticles are presented in Table S1. It was previously reported that OAm is the reductant and controls the nucleation rate while TOP provides a tunable surface stabilization through coordination on the Ni surface [34]. As the amount of TOP increased, the size of Ni nanoparticles decreased. Ni/SiO2 catalysts with no surface-capping agents and Ni/C catalysts with surface-capping agents were also prepared for comparison. The Ni nanoparticles were sonicated with commercial silica (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1h. The obtained Ni/SiO2 samples were dried in a convection oven at 80°C overnight. The dried samples were calcined at 450°C for 1h in air to remove the organic surface species and then reduced at the same temperature for 1h in a 10% H2 (with N2 balance) atmosphere. The 6.8nm Ni nanoparticles were deposited on carbon supports. The Ni nanoparticle solution was sonicated with carbon (Vulcan, XC-72R) for 1h and then stirred at 700rpm overnight. The obtained Ni/C sample was washed by centrifugation. The amount of Ni nanoparticles in the Ni/SiO2 and Ni/C samples was ∼10wt%."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a Tecnai TF30 ST instrument operated at 300kV. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses were performed on an Agilent ICP-OES 720 instrument to determine the Ni nanoparticle concentration in the IPA solution and the Ni weight percentages in the Ni/SiO2 and Ni/C samples. The magnetic properties of the Ni nanoparticles were measured by a SQUID-vibrating sample magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS 3) with a maximum field of 70,000 Oe at 300, 350, and 400K. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the powder Ni nanoparticle samples, which were obtained after IPA was completely evaporated overnight in vacuum oven at 80°C, was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (Netzsch, TG 209 F3) under an N2 atmosphere with a ramping rate of 10°C/min. The organic content on the Ni nanoparticles was estimated by the weight loss in the range of room temperature to 900°C. Diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) measurements were performed using a Nicolet iS-50 (Thermo Scientific). 10mg of Ni nanoparticles was mixed and grinded with 90mg of KBr. The mixed powder was put into a sample cup and set into a DRIFT cell. The cell was covered by KBr window. The cell was purged with Ar gas (98sccm) for 2h at room temperature. To remove water in the DRIFT cell, the cell was additionally purged with Ar gas at 110°C for 2h, and the cell was cooled to room temperature under the Ar flow. Then, 2% CO gas was charged for 20min at room temperature. The DRIFT spectra were collected under vacuum."
4,Hydrogenation reactions,"2.3 Hydrogenation reactions FFR (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) 1mL and various amounts of the nickel catalysts were added to 30mL of a solvent (methanol (99.8%, Duksan), ethanol, IPA, or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK; 99.5%, TCI)). Raney Ni (Ni 92.5%, TCI) was washed with ethanol and distilled water twice each and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C before use. The mixed solution was placed in a 100mL Teflon liner with a magnetic stir-bar and sealed in a stainless steel autoclave. Then the reactor was purged with H2 three times to exclude other gases. The autoclave was heated to 110°C at which temperature the hydrogenation reaction was performed under 30bar H2 and stirring at 700rpm. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled, and the solution was subsequently centrifuged at 11,000rpm for 10min to separate the liquid-phase products from the catalyst. For the recycling tests, 1mL of FFR and 30mL of IPA were added to the centrifuged Ni catalyst without any further treatment. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC; YL 6100) equipped with a capillary column (DB-624, Agilent Technologies, 30m×0.53mm×3.00μm) and flame ionization detector (FID). The selective hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes and ketones was performed according to the following protocol. The reactant 1mL (3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde (97%, Sigma-Aldrich), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 5-methylfurfural (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 3-furancarboxaldehyde (⩾97%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-furyl methyl ketone (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetophenone (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), cinnamaldehyde (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), or trans-2-hexen-1-al (98%, Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to 30mL of IPA. The 6.8nm Ni nanoparticle catalyst (20mg) was charged to the reactor. The hydrogenation reactions were then performed according to the FFR hydrogenation protocol, except the reaction temperature was 100°C for 3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The property of capped Ni nanoparticles,"3.1 The property of capped Ni nanoparticles Different sizes of Ni nanoparticles were synthesized with the size of 3.7±0.4, 5.1±0.4, 6.8±0.8, and 10.4±1.0nm as shown in Fig. 1 . These ‘capped’ nanoparticles with various sizes would have different amounts of surface organic molecules possibly resulting in different reactivity. The nanoparticles were spherical and uniformly distributed. During the liquid-phase hydrogenation reaction, the magnetic properties of these nanoparticle catalysts might affect their dispersion in the solution under magnetic stirring. The paramagnetic strength of the Ni nanoparticles was determined by SQUID measurements. Fig. S1 clearly shows that the magnetic moment increased as the nanoparticle size increased [35]. The 3.7nm and the 5.1nm Ni nanoparticles did not have magnetic moment. The 6.8nm Ni nanoparticles only exhibited weak paramagnetism under an external magnetic field. At 300K, the 10.4nm Ni nanoparticles exhibited a much higher saturation magnetization of 26.4emu/g (Table S2), which was approximately half of the saturation magnetization of the Raney Ni catalyst (46.2emu/g) at the same temperature. The strong paramagnetism of the 10.4nm nanoparticles might causes magnetic attraction under even weak magnetic field. Therefore, some of the 10.4nm Ni nanoparticle surface might not have been accessible to the reactant due to the magnetic aggregation. In contrast, the other nanoparticles were well-dispersed in solution, and the reaction on these nanoparticles was thus hardly affected by magnetic aggregation. Fig. S2 shows that 10.4nm Ni nanoparticles were attached onto the magnet significantly whereas 6.8nm Ni nanoparticles were not after magnetic stirring."
7,Selective hydrogenation of FFR: the effect of solvent and Ni nanoparticles size,"3.2 Selective hydrogenation of FFR: the effect of solvent and Ni nanoparticles size Various solvents were tested for selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFR) to furfuryl alcohol (FFA). The Ni nanoparticles should be dispersed in the solvent, and H2 should be dissolved in the solvent for hydrogenation. Methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) were tested, and the results are shown in Table S3. In addition to FFA and the fully hydrogenated product tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), hemiacetal and acetal products were also observed when the solvent was an alcohol [21,36,37]. Possible reaction pathways are shown in Fig. S3. When an alcohol was used as the solvent, significant acetalization was observed due to the reaction between the alcohol and FFR even in the absence of the catalyst. Of the alcohol solvents, the extent of acetalization was the largest for methanol and the smallest for IPA. It was reported that alcohol can serve as a hydrogen source for in situ hydrogenation [38,39]. When the 6.8nm Ni nanoparticles were dispersed in a solvent without hydrogen, only acetalization was observed, whereas hydrogenation occurred in all cases when the reaction was performed under 30bar of hydrogen gas. However, significant acetalization with acetal yields of 53.2% and 46.4% was observed in methanol and ethanol, respectively. In contrast, only minimal acetalization with an acetal yield of 0.8% and a high FFA yield of 91.8% was observed in IPA. Lower conversions were obtained in MIBK, probably due to the low solubility of hydrogen in this solvent. Therefore, IPA was chosen as the solvent for further experiments. The size effects of the Ni nanoparticles on the conversion and yields were investigated, and the results are given in Tables 1 and S4. The FFA yield was the highest for the 6.8nm nanoparticles. When the amounts of FFR and Ni nanoparticles were varied from 1mL of FFR and 10mg of Ni (Table 1) to 1mL of FFR and 20mg of Ni to 2mL of FFR and 10mg of Ni (Table S4), the same trend was observed in all cases. Although the smaller Ni nanoparticles would have higher surface area and therefore more active sites, they exhibited lower conversions. The lower activity of the smaller nanoparticles indicated that the surface of the smaller nanoparticles was heavily blocked by the surface-capping agents. The TGA results in Fig. S4 show the amount of organic species on the Ni surface. As the nanoparticle size decreased, the organic content increased significantly. The density of the organic agents on the Ni surface was estimated and is listed in Table 2 . Among the surface capping agents used for the synthesis, TOP is known to have stronger interaction with the Ni surface [33,34,40]. The surface coverage of the organic ligands clearly increased as the nanoparticle size decreased. Thus, the surfaces of the smaller Ni nanoparticles were more densely capped with the organic layers."
8,Comparison of capped and uncapped Ni nanoparticles,"3.3 Comparison of capped and uncapped Ni nanoparticles 3.3.1 Activity and selectivity The effects of the organic surface layer on the conversion and yields were further investigated by comparing the results obtained with the capped and uncapped Ni catalysts. The uncapped Ni nanoparticles were synthesized by depositing the capped Ni nanoparticles on silica support and then removing the organic layer by thermal treatment at 450°C in air. The removal of the organic layer was confirmed by the absence of the CH peak at 2800–3000cm−1 in the ATR-IR spectra shown in Fig. S5. Fig. S6 shows TEM images of the calcined Ni/SiO2 catalysts. The Ni nanoparticle size increased only slightly after calcination from 3.7, 5.1, 6.8, and 10.4nm to 3.8, 5.4, 7.0, and 10.6nm, respectively. Whereas the capped 6.8nm nanoparticles exhibited the highest FFA yield of all the capped Ni nanoparticles, the highest FFA yield for the calcined Ni/SiO2 catalysts was obtained with the smallest Ni nanoparticles. The FFA selectivity was 88.2% for the capped 6.8nm nanoparticles and 50.6% for the uncapped 3.8nm nanoparticles. Although the 3.8nm Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest FFR hydrogenation activity, its FFA selectivity was poor due to over-hydrogenation. The Raney Ni catalyst had the lowest FFA yield of the various Ni catalysts. The FFA yields obtained in the selective FFR hydrogenation catalyzed by the capped nanoparticles were clearly the highest because little over-hydrogenation was observed in these cases. Furthermore, the presence of the organic layer actually increased the FFR conversion. Both the FFR conversion and FFA yield of the capped 6.8nm Ni nanoparticles were considerably higher than those of the similarly sized (7.0nm) uncapped Ni/SiO2 catalyst. The presence of the organic layer would attract the reactant to the Ni surface, enhancing the conversion while suppressing over-hydrogenation. 3.3.2 Measurement of surface active sites Turnover frequency (TOF) was estimated for the uncapped nanoparticles by measuring the Ni surface sites. H2 uptakes were measured using H2 pulse injection after reducing the calcined Ni/SiO2 samples at 450°C. H2 uptakes were not observed for the capped Ni nanoparticles because the organic layer laid down at the Ni surface, prohibiting H2 adsorption. Table 3 shows that TOF values were the same for the various sizes of uncapped Ni nanoparticles. This structure insensitivity has been reported previously for many hydrogenation reactions [41–43]. The amount of surface active sites could be estimated for the capped Ni nanoparticles from the surface coverage of organics obtained in Table 2 and H2 uptakes measured for calcined Ni/SiO2. Then TOF values for the capped Ni nanoparticles were estimated from the hydrogenated FFR conversion and the estimated surface active sites. The TOF values for the capped nanoparticles were much higher than the TOF values for the calcined nanoparticles. The surface organic molecules probably enhanced the surface reaction significantly with higher TOF than the uncapped nanoparticles. 3.3.3 Effect of the amount of Ni catalyst and the reaction time The effect of the Ni catalyst amount on the product yield was explored using the nanoparticles and Raney Ni as shown in Fig. 2 a. The capped nanoparticles, the uncapped nanoparticles, and Raney Ni were employed in this investigation. As the Ni amount increased, the FFA yield increased. For the capped Ni nanoparticles, the FFA yield was higher than 90%, even when a small amount of Ni (20mg) was used, and the THFA yield was less than 4%. For the uncapped Ni/SiO2 catalyst, the maximum FFA yield was approximately 60%, even when up to 60mg of Ni was used to catalyze the reaction. In this case, the THFA production was considerably higher with yields of greater than 30%. For the Raney Ni catalyst, both the FFA and THFA yields increased monotonically as the Ni amount increased up to 60mg, reaching 41% for FFA and 50% for THFA. When more Ni catalysts were used for the uncapped Ni/SiO2 and Raney Ni, over-hydrogenation was observed; the yield for FFA decreased and the yield for THFA increased. The effect of the reaction time on the product yields was also investigated as shown in Fig. 2b. Distinctly different trends were observed for the various catalysts. The capped nanoparticles had a maximum FFA yield of 92% after 3h and remained essentially constant at longer reaction times. The THFA production was less than 6% for up to 9h of reaction. However, the uncapped Ni/SiO2 and Raney Ni catalysts exhibited different behaviors. The FFA yield reached a maximum after 4h for the Ni/SiO2 catalyst and Raney Ni catalyst. Then, the FFA yield decreased as the reaction time was further increased, and the THFA production increased significantly. After 9h of reaction, the FFA yield decreased to less than 10% in Raney Ni and less than 20% in Ni/SiO2, indicating that the capped Ni nanoparticles are more suitable for practical applications due to their tolerance against over-hydrogenation. 3.3.4 Reason for different activity and selectivity These interesting reaction results were due to the presence of the organic surface layer. The difference in adsorption mode on the capped and uncapped Ni nanoparticles was confirmed by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) technique. CO was adsorbed at the dry powder samples of the capped Ni nanoparticles (6.8nm) or the uncapped Ni/SiO2 nanoparticles (7.0nm). The CO can be adsorbed at linear top site (2021cm−1) or 3-fold hollow site (1863cm−1) on the clean Ni surface [14]. The CO adsorption mode showed clear difference as shown in Fig. 3 . Whereas the uncapped Ni/SiO2 catalyst showed two different CO adsorption modes, the capped Ni nanoparticles showed only one peak representing a linear CO adsorption at a single Ni site. The Ni ensemble sites were not observed for the capped Ni nanoparticles due to the presence of organic layer, which would also prohibit the adsorption of furan ring to the Ni surface. The electronic structures of the Ni catalysts were investigated by XPS. Fig. S7 shows that the capped Ni nanoparticles had less metallic character than the calcined Ni/SiO2 catalyst with no organic surface layer. The percentage of metallic Ni in the larger nanoparticles was higher than that in the smaller nanoparticles for both the capped and uncapped samples. The XANES spectra in Fig. S8 also confirm that the Ni nanoparticles in the uncapped samples were more metallic than the capped nanoparticles. The more electronegative P or N species in the organic surface layer might withdraw electrons from the Ni surface, resulting in a higher positive charge at the Ni surface. The change in electronic structure would also contribute to the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond at the capped Ni nanoparticle surfaces."
9,Recyclability test,"3.4 Recyclability test The recyclability of the capped 6.8nm Ni nanoparticles in the hydrogenation reaction was tested, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . After each reaction, the nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation and reused without any further treatment. Although some nanoparticles might be lost during the separation process, the same amount of FFR was used in every reaction. Fig. 4 shows that the FFA yield remained high, decreasing only slightly as the number of catalytic cycles increased. After the repeated reactions, the nanoparticles were observed by TEM, and the results are shown in Fig. S9. The nanoparticles size distribution changed only slightly from 6.8±0.8nm to 7.2±0.9nm. The change in the content of organic molecules at the capped Ni nanoparticles was estimated by TGA after 5 cycles of the hydrogenation, and it showed little difference as shown in Fig. S10. Medlin et al. have shown that the organic ligands could induce selective hydrogenation of FFR to FFA [14,44,45]. Because they immobilized the organic layer onto the metal surface which had prepared using wet impregnation method, however, the interaction between the metal surface and the organic molecules might be weak hindering the repeated usage of the catalysts. Our catalysts were stable enough to be used repeatedly."
10,Potential for practical applications,"3.5 Potential for practical applications It should be noted that separation by centrifugation might not be suitable for practical applications. Therefore, the capped 6.8nm nanoparticles were deposited on carbon support (denoted ‘capped Ni/C’ in Table 1) and then used to catalyze selective FFR hydrogenation. Fig. S11 shows the TEM image of the Ni/C where the organic layer exists at the Ni surface. The Ni nanoparticles were well-dispersed on the carbon support, possibly due to attractive interactions between the organic ligands and carbon support. The conversion and yield obtained with the Ni/C catalyst in the FFR hydrogenation reaction were the same as those obtained with the unsupported capped Ni nanoparticles. When the Ni/C catalyst was separated by simple filtration, all of the catalysts were successfully removed as shown in Fig. S12. The conversion and yields obtained when the collected Ni/C catalyst was reused were nearly the same as those obtained after its first use."
11,Selective hydrogenation of other furanic aldehydes,"3.6 Selective hydrogenation of other furanic aldehydes The capped 6.8nm Ni nanoparticles were also used to catalyze the hydrogenation of other furanic aldehydes, and the results are given in Table 4 . For all the furanic aldehydes with molecular structure similar to that of FFR (entries 1–6), very high selectivities of >90% toward the unsaturated alcohol products were achieved. However, the ketones such as 2-furyl methyl ketone and acetophenone (entries 7 and 8) could not be converted over the capped Ni nanoparticle catalyst. In the cases of cinnamaldehyde and trans-2-hexen-1-al (entries 9 and 10), the CC bond was preferentially hydrogenated over the CO bond to produce saturated aldehyde product. The capped Ni nanoparticles could catalyze the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated furanic aldehydes to unsaturated furanic alcohols."
12,Conclusions,"Ni nanoparticles of various sizes were synthesized by a colloidal method and used to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated furanic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. When capped 3.7, 5.1, 6.8 and 10.4nm Ni nanoparticles were used for furfural hydrogenation, the 6.8nm nanoparticles showed a superior yield toward furfuryl alcohol. The surface densities of the organic capping agents on the smaller nanoparticles were higher, resulting in poorer activity, whereas the larger nanoparticles agglomerated under magnetic stirring, possibly leading to a loss in the Ni surface area. The capped Ni nanoparticles were deposited on a carbon support and used in furfural hydrogenation without any loss in the yield. The Ni/C catalysts could be easily collected by simple filtration. The capped nanoparticles also exhibited selectivities higher than 90% in the hydrogenation of other unsaturated furanic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols. The activities and yields of the capped Ni nanoparticles were compared to those of uncapped Ni nanoparticles. Although the Ni nanoparticle sizes were very similar, their catalytic properties were clearly different. For the uncapped calcined Ni/SiO2 catalysts, the smallest Ni nanoparticles exhibited highest furfural conversion, but over-hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was observed. Furthermore, at longer reaction times, the over-hydrogenated product selectivity of the calcined Ni/SiO2 catalyst increased, whereas the capped Ni nanoparticles suppressed the over-hydrogenation. DRIFT results confirmed the absence of Ni ensemble sites at the capped nanoparticles, indicating that access of furanic ring to the Ni surface was prohibited at the capped nanoparticles. The steric hindrance induced by the organic surface layer led to the selective hydrogenation of furanic aldehydes to furanic alcohols. The capped nanoparticles could be reused repeatedly without a significant loss in the product yields."
