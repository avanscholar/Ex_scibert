0,Introduction,"In recent years, the attention of researchers shifted towards alternative fuels due to the impending depletion of fossil fuels and increasingly stringent emission regulation [1–3]. The alternative fuels including gaseous fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG) [4], liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [5], hydrogen [6] and liquid fuel like alcohols methanol [7], ethanol [8], propanol [9], butanol [10] have been nominated for SI engines in the former decades. Gaseous fuels are having complexity in handling and storage. Unlike gaseous fuels, alcohols are having easy accessibility and less complexity in harness. In addition, alcohols are renewable and it has been established with evidence that they are the most promising alternative fuel for SI engines [11–14]. Among all the alcohols methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) are categorized as LCA due to their lesser carbon atom in their structure. Presently, a lower fraction of alcohols is used with gasoline in SI engines without any engine modification. On the other hand, higher concentration or sole alcohol fuels are necessitating significant modification in the engine. To eliminate the risks of engine modification blending alcohols with gasoline was recommended by many researchers [15]. Blending alcohol with gasoline causes to improve the complete combustion and combustion efficiency (CE) [2,16,17]. The combustion of LCA in SI engines can generate higher combustion pressure than gasoline due to their greater octane rating (OR) [18]. Also, alcohols cause to increase in burning velocity which leads to more constant-volume combustion and complete combustion [3,19]. The flashpoint of LCA is almost similar to the ambient temperature resulting in a sometimes favourable atmosphere for flammability [20]. Conversely, the flammable and detonation behaviour of alcohols resulting serious damage in the engine at the temperature beyond the flash point [21,22]. There have been many efforts undertaken to address this problem, among these techniques direct injection (DI) renders a fair way to overcome the issues [23]. Due to the low volatility of alcohol, port injection is inefficient and the DI of alcohols causes the formation of a non-uniform stratified mixture resulting in good combustion [24]. The combustion reaction of LCA occurs at a higher temperature and produces carbon dioxide as shown in Fig. 1 . Also, the OR of LCA is much greater than gasoline can lead to operating in a higher compression ratio (CR) to enhance the fuel economy [25]. Moreover, alcohol powered engines often suffer from cold starting issues since the alcohols have higher latent heat of vaporization (LHV) [26]. To overcome the issues, several researchers proposed dual fuel injection mode and it is a noteworthy technique when the engine is powered by alcohols [27–29]. Nevertheless, dual fuel mode has few negative impacts on combustion particularly on CE, which is reduced during the lower and medium load conditions. Therefore, additional researches necessitate for the future to assess dual-fuel combustion [30]. In addition, several researchers have been conducting research and development of a novel approach on the SI engine combustion technique namely controlled auto-ignition (CAI) and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) [31,32]. Furthermore, LCA can be applied to CAI combustion mode owing to their extensive range of air-fuel ratios and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) levels compared to gasoline with the promoted temperature of the intake charge [33,34]. Particularly, ethanol tends to earlier auto-ignition and has a greater peak pressure which leads to reduce exhaust emission rather than gasoline. Also, it is expected that the greater OR of the alcohols can resist the auto-ignition but alcohols exhibit single-stage ignition and earlier auto-ignition takes place compared to gasoline [35]. Despite developing novel technologies, the research world is also focusing on the efficient way to utilize the current technologies correlated with alcohol powered SI engines. Especially, many researches are carried out on the impact of various blend concentrations and supplementary fuels on combustion characteristics. Also, reorganizing operational parameters and reconstructing design parameters has a significant interest among researchers. Fig. 2 reports the chronological order of review articles published over a decade on the application of alcohol in the SI engine. This paper critically assesses the numerous influential parameters of combustion characteristics and aims to bring forth insights of previous studies of LCA in SI engines. The current review is demarcated into three portions. Initially, the section is committed to an in-depth survey of the effect of physicochemical properties of LCA and influential parameters on the fuel perspective like blend ratio and supplementary fuels on the combustion characteristics. Secondly, a section is allocated for the discussion on engine perspective such as the impact of operational and design parameters on the combustion characteristics. Finally, the review consolidates the challenges that arise when the engine is fuelled with LCA and enhancing techniques to overcome the challenges. Furthermore, this paper provides some recommendations and directions for the application of LCA in SI engines for the future."
1,Motivation and objective of the current study,"Over the last decade, plenty of researches are carried out to analyze the application of alcohols on the performance, combustion, emissions of SI engines. Even though a variety of studies exist for engine-out characteristics, the studies for the assessment of combustion characteristics of LCA in SI engines is not reviewed and Fig. 2 confesses the statement. Therefore, an insight into the impact of fuel and engine parameters on LCA driven SI engine is essential to achieve greater altitudes in the application of alternative fuels in SI engines for the present scenario. This type of analysis would aid in a greater understanding of the factors which are influential to the combustion. In addition, the performance and exhaust emissions are the by-products of combustion and it is well acknowledged the engine responses can be enhanced by combustion. Hence, the scientific world requires amalgamated research work to address the impact of alcohol and engine parameters on combustion characteristics of SI and it is the prominence that the combustion viewpoint to be examined. To bridge this void, this paper is devoted to delivering the readers a wider in-depth cognizance to assess the influence of fuel and engine parameters on combustion characteristics. Therefore, the objective of the present work lies behind the critical discussion of the combustion characteristics of LCA in SI engines. Further, the work is extended to explore the challenges that arise while the engine is fuelled with alcohol and enhancing techniques to overcome the corresponding issues. Eventually, this review will assist some critical areas in addressing the research and suggest fields where further studies can be focused in the future to the best of the author's knowledge. Fig. 3 depicts the outline of the structure and flow of the current study."
2,Influence of fuel properties on combustion characteristics of LCA powered SI engines,"Every fuel has its own set of physical and chemical properties which significantly dominate engine-out characteristics like performance, combustion and emission. The physical properties of fuel can influence the fuel vaporization and atomization process whereas chemical properties influence the ignition and combustion process. The physicochemical properties of gasoline and LCA are listed in Table 1 . This section is assigned to summarize the benefits and drawbacks of physical and chemical properties of LCA on combustion characteristics. Consecutively, the impact of fuel properties of LCA on combustion characteristics is discussed and Fig. 4 illustrates the influential fuel properties on combustion characteristics."
3,Advantages of physicochemical properties of LCA on combustion characteristics,"3.1 Advantages of physicochemical properties of LCA on combustion characteristics Normally, LCA is ecological effective fuel obtained from renewable energy and they have several advantages over gasoline. LCA having several identical properties to gasoline as mentioned in Table 1 and hence they can be employed with minimal concentration for SI engines without any modification. Also, they have greater OR than gasoline that contributes to enhancing the anti-knocking behaviour and allowing them to operate in higher CR [55]. Further, higher LHV of LCA helps to provide a cooling effect to the intake air-fuel charge consequently VE of the engine increases [56]. Moreover, LCA supplies more oxygen during the combustion process due to the greater availability of oxygen in their molecular structure [57]. Similarly, the immense oxygen content of alcohols compared to gasoline can elevate combustion rate and CE. In addition, combustion phasing and CE can be improved owing to faster LFS of LCA than that of gasoline [16,58]. Besides, the higher oxygen content and LFS of alcohols promote the degree of clean combustion, burning and minimal combustion chamber deposit [2,59]. Furthermore, LCA can stimulate soot-free combustion by offering complete combustion since they are oxygenated fuels. Additionally, combustion of LCA generates greater combustion pressure than that of gasoline attributed to substantial molal products. Subsequently, LCA combustion emits a minimal amount of ash into the atmosphere because of its lower carbon content [18]. As an alternative fuel, LCA has beneficial emission characteristics and a positive impact on GH emissions by releasing lesser toxic gases into the environment [60,61]. Fig. 5 narrates the advantages of LCA over gasoline on combustion characteristics of SI engines."
4,Disadvantages of physicochemical properties of LCA on combustion characteristics,"3.2 Disadvantages of physicochemical properties of LCA on combustion characteristics Though LCA suitable for the application of SI engine possesses several benefits, they have some drawbacks as described in Fig. 6 . In general, the energy content of alcohol is lower than that of gasoline which leads to an antagonistic impact on fuel economy. Further, the calorific of alcohol is lower than the gasoline which indicates more alcohol fuel is essential to meet out the same power produced by gasoline [39,62]. Besides, Reid vapour pressure of LCA is lower than gasoline, which results in poor cold starting performance due to the lower volatility [57]. In addition, Reid vapour pressure and volatility are correlated with an engine vapour-locking propensity. Therefore, the usance of LCA causes a reduction in the temperature of vapour/liquid ratio and may increase the likelihood of vapour lock in the fuel delivery system [63]. Also, the usage of alcohol can cause corrosion of ferrous elements in the engine components, fuel storage and supply systems [64]. Moreover, ignition characteristics of LCA are poor due to the higher auto-ignition temperature compared to gasoline [65,66]. Further, aldehyde emissions are one of the primary consequences of incomplete combustion of LCA, also reduction of oxidation in the exhaust system may contribute to the increase the aldehyde emission [67,68]. Unlike low concentration of LCA-gasoline blends, sole and high concentration of LCA-gasoline blends required major modification in the engine design [69]."
5,Effect of physicochemical characteristics properties of LCA on combustion characteristics,"3.3 Effect of physicochemical characteristics properties of LCA on combustion characteristics The molecular size of alcohols is smaller than gasoline which can improve the blending characteristics. Therefore, the combustion rate is increased because they can burn at lower ignition temperature owing to the drop in peak in-cylinder temperature, hence heat loss is lowered [70,71]. Furthermore, the density of alcohols is almost similar to gasoline but the density of blended fuel increases linearly as alcohols concentration increases in the blend. A similar trend can be obtained for specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, octane number and there is an uncertain trend observed for flash and fire points of the blended fuels. In addition, the heating value (HV) of blends reduces when alcohol concentration rises due to lower HV and octane enrichment of alcohols [72]. Consequently, increasing the octane number of the blend causes to increase in Pmax and CE [73]. Moreover, the higher octane number of alcohols are providing longer ID which indicates the time offered for fuel vaporization is more that can lead to a better air-fuel mixture formation [74,75]. During mixture formation, alcohols are supplying more oxygen to the blends since they have greater oxygen content in their molecular structure which improves the CE [76,77]. The greater availability of oxygen helps to increase the flame development speed and fuel-burning velocity consequently shortening their corresponding durations [78]. Additionally, alcohols can produce higher Pmax than gasoline, enhances the clean-burning behaviour since they are oxygenated fuels and lack of carbon-carbon bonds [79,80]. Further, complete combustion takes place when adequate oxygen is available, when the complete combustion fire is extinguished, it emits carbon dioxide. Conversely, incomplete combustion occurs due to the inadequacy of oxygen and tend to produce carbon monoxide which is toxic to the atmosphere. Fig. 7 illustrates the effects of complete and incomplete combustion of the fuels. Moreover, the LHV of alcohols is comparatively greater than gasoline which can provide a cooling effect to the intake charge and decreases the in-cylinder temperature [81,82]. In addition, higher LHV can delay the fuel vaporization and ignition timing retards for alcohols when compared with gasoline [83]. Owing to the faster laminar flame speed (LFS) of alcohols, the complete combustion is intensifying before the actual cylinder heat loss, hence CE improved [84–86]. Fig. 8 describes the reactions of complete and incomplete combustion of LCA. Subsequently, a higher burning rate shortens the CD and increases Pmax with respect to alcohol concentration in the blend [87]. However, the HV of alcohols is lower than gasoline so a more quantity of alcohol is required to produce the energy that of gasoline. Further, alcohol-gasoline blend tends to increases the volatility and decreases distillation temperature which affects the drivability index and it can cause cold starting and vapour locking problem [63]. Due to the lower distillation temperature, the mixture does not act as ideal because of the formation of a near-azeotropic mixture [88–90]. Obviously, non-ideal mixtures possess greater vapour pressure and this suggests that increasing vapour pressure of blended fuel [91]. In general, alcohols do not intermix well with gasoline due to polar intermolecular forces causes to phase separation and offering the mixture to evaporate easily, resulting in high vapour pressure [92]. Thus, the physiochemical properties of LCA have a dominant influence on combustion and by enhancing these properties improved combustion can be attained in SI engines. Apart from the physicochemical properties of LCA, numerous key parameters that influence the combustion characteristics of SI engine as shown in Fig. 9 . Therefore, the effect of these parameters on combustion characteristics is elaborately discussed in the following sections."
6,Influence of LCA-gasoline blend ratio on combustion characteristics,"First of all, a mixture of two or more fuels is termed a blend and the proportion of each fuel are interpreted as a blend ratio of the blend. The percentage of fuels in the blend are represented alphanumerically (for example “M5” contains 5% methanol and 95% gasoline) [93]. In several studies, alcohols are blended with gasoline at plenteous proportions by volume or mass. Accordingly, combustion characteristics such as Pmax, HRR, CD, ID and mass fraction burned (MFB) are significantly affected by the blend ratio [94]. Therefore, the influence of various blend ratios has to be analysed to understand the combustion characteristics and the following section provides a detailed discussion of the consequences of the various LCA blend ratio."
7,Effect of methanol-gasoline blend ratio on combustion characteristics,"4.1 Effect of methanol-gasoline blend ratio on combustion characteristics Methanol supplies more oxygen than ethanol to the blend and is the cause to improve CE and volumetric efficiency (VE) also decrease the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). Therefore, M5 and M10 blends have more oxygen thereby better combustion can take place and increases thermal efficiency. The Pmax of blends is higher than gasoline and starts to rise earlier due to the greater OR and LFS of methanol [95]. Further, the HRR of blends is higher than gasoline because methanol has a single boiling point owing to one type of hydrocarbon and oxygen enrichment which enhances combustion rate [96]. Also, the CD is shortening due to higher Pmax and ID increases while the engine is fuelled with methanol. Additionally, the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of blends is lower than gasoline due to the greater LHV of methanol. Consequently, it cools intake air to a large extent resulting in an increment of charge density that helps to form a lean mixture and possibly produce complete combustion. Accordingly, the VE improved which enhances combustion chamber turbulence around the spark plug region [97]. At lower load, Pmax of M10 & M20 is almost similar to the gasoline and Pmax increases with methanol concentration increase at higher load. In the case of HRR, blends exhibit lower than gasoline at higher load and almost identical at lower load. Also, it is noticed that the crank angle (CA) of Pmax and HRR for M20 moves somewhat earlier than gasoline. Because the faster LFS of methanol helps to intensify the combustion velocity (CV) as well as faster combustion at higher speed. Accordingly, M20 exhibits faster CV and hence CD is shortening consequently it influences MFB. At high speed, MFB of blend indicates that combustion takes place earlier and increases than gasoline especially for M20 [98]. During cold start conditions, there is misfiring cycles occurs when the engine fuelled with gasoline, M10, partial burn for M20 and there is an absence of misfiring for M30 [78]. Because Reid vapour pressure of methanol is higher and lower boiling temperature compared to gasoline. So, it can enhance the volatilization of blends and improves the mixture preparation than gasoline [99]. Further, M30 exhibits higher Pmax due to the increment of methanol concentration and the HRR of the blend is faster than gasoline. Additionally, increasing methanol concentration resulting advanced MFB in terms of CA due to higher LHV and faster LFS. Because these properties of methanol, absorb more heat in the cylinder resulting in reducing fuel atomization and ID also help to increase the rate of fuel combustion and shortens the CD. Therefore, methanol can atomize easily and evaporate due to higher in-cylinder temperature owing to faster LFS [100]. In the same way, M44 and M45 exhibit higher Pmax and HRR due to more availability of methanol in the blend also CA of Pmax and HRR moves forward. Because, the higher concentration of methanol provides greater OR, LFS and LHV to the blend [101]. Consequently, the CD is shortening and ID extends for blend than gasoline [95]. Furthermore, M85 exhibits higher Pmax than gasoline because of the greater availability of methanol and corresponding CA advances due to LFS. Further, CD and ID advances in terms of CA and heat release duration is shortening for M85 compared to gasoline [102]. Also, methanol generates lesser vapour due to its lower volatility which can offer greater anti-knocking performance and higher LFS decreases the probability of knocking [103]. By the reason of higher concentration of methanol-gasoline increases Pmax and HRR due to the enhancement of combustion phasing [101]. Table 2 reports the effect of various methanol-gasoline blend ratios on combustion characteristics of SI engines."
8,Effect of ethanol-gasoline blend ratio on combustion characteristics,"4.2 Effect of ethanol-gasoline blend ratio on combustion characteristics Adding ethanol with gasoline causes an increasing OR, since the LHV of ethanol higher than gasoline which leads to a delayed chain reaction and reduce the HV [108]. Higher LHV of E10 can reduce air intake temperature that significantly has a negative effect on air-fuel mixture formation and fuel atomization. Obviously, ethanol evaporation reduces the in-cylinder temperature resulting in a lower Pmax at lower and medium loads. In higher load, the influence of LHV on Pmax for fuel blend probably decreasing which leads to increase Pmax. Meanwhile, the available oxygen in the blend expedites flame and combustion speed that contributes to higher Pmax [109]. It is evident that blending ethanol with gasoline can reduce the overall HV of the blend therefore HRR is reduced at low and medium loads. In the case of higher loads, the HRR of E10 is higher than that of gasoline for the same operating conditions [108,103]. Further, the CD of E10 is shortening due to its more oxygen content and it leads to complete burning to an extent [104]. Also, ID is shortening because the air-fuel mixture of E10 exhibits a higher burning rate than gasoline [110]. Additionally, the E20 exhibit an alike trend on Pmax relative to gasoline at a low load and slightly higher at a high load. Similarly, the HRR of E20 shows the identical trend and the position of Pmax and HRR is somewhat before gasoline due to the faster LFS which intensifies the CV so the CD of E20 is shortening [111]. Also, the MFB of E20 increases due to the faster flame development and the rapid burning rate of ethanol over gasoline [112]. Further, the EGT significantly decreases with the increment of the brake torque because of the effective conversion of heat to work [113,114]. Moreover, the E30 reveals lower Pmax than gasoline due to greater LHV of ethanol and reduction of calorific value. Also, the E30 possess a lower HV due to the increment of LHV and it can significantly reduce HRR [108]. Additionally, the CD and ID are shortening for E30 due to the greater burning rate which is higher than gasoline [110]. Furthermore, the E40 & E60 are following identical trends with E30 on combustion characteristics of SI engine [113,115]. Besides, the E85 evince lower Pmax due to the faster LFS that contains more ethanol concentration also, it contributes to faster HRR. In addition, CD and ID are shortening due to more ethanol proportion in E85, which suggests that increasing ethanol concentration can lead to a decrement of equivalent ratio. In the case of MFB for E85 is lower whereas gasoline has a higher MFB since E85 exhibit a greater burning rate [116]. Further, higher LHV reduces the intake temperature which can help to improve the VE and has a positive effect on gas turbulence in the combustion chamber [112]. Table 3 describes the effect of various ethanol-gasoline blend ratios on combustion characteristics of SI engines. Other than blend ratio, supplementary fuels incorporated with LCA have significantly affected the combustion characteristics and they have to be analysed. Therefore, the following section is dedicated to discussing the impact of supplementary fuels correlated with LCA."
9,Influence of LCA-supplementary fuels on combustion characteristics,"Over a decade, there is increasing interest among researchers in ancillary fuels correlated with LCA that can improve the engine-out characteristics. Supplementary fuels are added with alcohols in a minimal quantity by mass or volume and they might be additives, oxygenated or gaseous fuels. Mostly, Supplementary fuels are performance and combustion modifiers that can be used as octane boosters, anti-knock agents, corrosion inhibitors, metal deactivators, oxygenates and antioxidants [120]. This section aims to evaluate the impact of supplementary fuels on combustion characteristics corresponding to LCA explicitly."
10,Effect of methanol-supplementary fuels on combustion characteristics,"5.1 Effect of methanol-supplementary fuels on combustion characteristics Some studies are carried out on methanol fuelled SI engines with the addition of butanol as a supplementary fuel, commonly n-butanol and iso-butanol are used to enhance the engine-out characteristics. Adding n-butanol to the methanol-gasoline blend causes a reduction in Pmax and increasing n-butanol concentration leads to an increase in Pmax slightly. Firstly, the reduction of Pmax is attributed to the lower HV of n-butanol and methanol than gasoline. Secondly, the higher concentration of n-butanol leads to improve CE and VE due to more oxygen provided by n-butanol and methanol [121]. Additionally, the HRR is increasing and corresponding CA moves forward towards the top dead center (TDC) with increasing n-butanol concentration which enhances the rate of combustion consequently CD is shortening [122,123]. Also, iso-butanol addition causes to increase in Pmax attributed to its oxygen enrichment and faster LFS [124]. Further, HRR and in-cylinder temperature are slightly reducing since the energy density of methanol and iso-butanol is lower than gasoline. Further, the CD is shortening owing to the higher LFS of iso-butanol that can lead to an increase in the burning velocity. Conversely, ID is slightly extending than gasoline because iso-butanol has higher LHV which provides a more cooling effect to the intake charge [125]. Moreover, hydrogen is carbon-free fuel with excellent combustion behaviour, faster flame propagation, wide flammability ranges and lower ignition energy [6]. The Pmax is increasing and corresponding CA advances due to the addition of hydrogen attributed to its lower ignition energy which indicates quick ignition causes to improve the CV [126]. Consequently, the HRR follows the aforementioned trend of Pmax due to improved combustion quality furnished by the hydrogen [127]. Also, lower ignition energy of hydrogen benefits accelerate the reaction rate and the mixture ignites easily consequently shortening the CD and ID [128]. Besides, studies for supplementary fuels and additives associated with methanol is limited, further studies are recommended. Table 4 reports the effect of various supplementary fuels correlated with methanol on combustion characteristics."
11,Effect of ethanol-supplementary fuels on combustion characteristics,"5.2 Effect of ethanol-supplementary fuels on combustion characteristics The addition of n-butanol and iso-butanol with ethanol resulting an in-cylinder temperature drop due to the cooling effect of intake charge consequently Pmax and EGT reduce [124,132]. Further, the CD and ID are shortening owing to higher oxygen availability and higher LFS of butanol resulting in to increase in the CV [133,134]. Fig. 10 covers the influence of various supplementary fuels corresponding to ethanol on combustion characteristics. Normally, ether fuels are added as supplementary fuel at a lower concentration with ethanol to improve OR and oxygen content that causes complete combustion and increasing the CE [16]. Firstly, diethyl ether (DEE) is one of the types of ethers and the addition of DEE with ethanol leads to reduce the Pmax attributed to the higher OR and LHV of DEE and ethanol. Further, adding DEE to ethanol-gasoline causes to increase in the calorific value of the blend also contributes to the reduction in HRR [135]. Moreover, DEE and ethanol have greater volatility than gasoline besides, they are being the cause of increasing the oxygen in the blend therefore CD and ID are shortening [136]. Secondly, dimethyl ether (DME) can be used as a combustion modifier in some studies and it can provide smoke-free combustion [137]. The Pmax is reducing due to the addition of DME since it has a low energy density that reduces the energy flow rate of the DME-ethanol blend. Furthermore, the blend can ignite easily due to oxidation of DME that improves the ignition and combustion rate consequently CD and ID are shortening [138,139]. Besides, cycloalkanes are saturated hydrocarbons and the carbon molecules are arranged in the form cyclic manner in their structure [140,141]. The addition of cycloalkanes leads to an increase in the Pmax and HRR due to the greater HV of cycloalkanes than ethanol [81]. Also, cycloalkanes can supply more oxygen which contributes to the reduction of CD [142]. Additionally, cycloalkanes and ethanol have higher OR than gasoline that causes to prolong the ID [143]. Further, the addition of acetone causes a reduction in Pmax because the LFS of acetone is lower than ethanol and gasoline [144]. Also, lower LFS of acetone causes to prolonging CD and ID relatively ethanol-gasoline blends [145]. Table 5 describes the influence of various supplementary fuels relative to ethanol on combustion characteristics."
12,Influence of operational parameters on combustion characteristics of LCA powered SI engines,"Engine operating parameters such as ignition timing, injection modes, timing (IT) and pressure (IP), EGR, equivalent ratio (λ) exhibits distinctive combustion characteristics. The following section addresses the influence of reorganizing engine operational parameters correlated with LCA detailly."
13,Effect of operational parameters on combustion characteristics of methanol powered SI engines,"6.1 Effect of operational parameters on combustion characteristics of methanol powered SI engines Pmax is increasing compared to gasoline due to the more quantity of fuel injected at higher load and speed. Obviously, more methanol fraction offers more oxygen that leads to improved combustion [149]. Ethanol-gasoline blend leads to generating higher HRR than gasoline owing to its greater OR. Further, CD shortens when increasing load and speed attributed to more amount of fuel injected which contributes to intensify combustion [74]. Consequently, there is an extension of ID that reduces more time to vaporization of fuel tend to meliorate air-fuel mixture. Besides, methanol direct injection (MDI) exhibit higher Pmax relative to methanol port injection (MPI) by the reason of advanced combustion phasing. Because MDI provides more charge cooling effect than MPI due to LHV is effectually used to cool intake charge [30]. Further, HRR follows an almost identical trend of Pmax and the CD is shortening due to higher oxygen content which offers the greater burning speed [150]. Also, Pmax is increasing when the ignition timing is advanced due to the higher charge cooling effect provided by methanol [151]. Additionally, HRR is increasing and corresponding CA moves forward since methanol has a greater LFS [3]. Further, the CD is protracting owing to advanced ignition timing tends to initiate combustion at a lower temperature [152]. Also, ID is prolonging consistently since the flame development during the initial condition of combustion is slower respective to reduced temperature [153]. Moreover, the impact of operational parameters on combustion characteristics while the SI engine fuelled with methanol is depicted in Fig. 11 . In addition, Pmax is increasing with retarding IT because it providing more time to form the homogeneous mixture [151,154]. Additionally, similar results are obtaining for HRR with retarded IT rather than constant IT and their peak positions move away from TDC. Also, the CD is decreasing with advancing IT attributed to faster LFS and ideal air-fuel mixture distribution in the combustion chamber [155]. On the other hand, the CD is extending when IT is set at overlap timing due to the complexity of mixture flow characteristics causes to reduce the burning velocity that leads to deteriorating combustion [3,156]. However, improved air-fuel mixture relative to retarded IT results in shortening the ID and enhancing the CE [157]. Moreover, Pmax and HRR are decreasing when IP is reduced due to the typical reduction of spray momentum and breakdown is diminished that leading to minimal in-cylinder turbulence and slows down the air-fuel mixing [158]. Furthermore, Pmax is reducing and CA moves forward while increasing λ because the greater value of λ leads to a reduction in the burning velocity and combustion temperature (CT) [159]. Subsequently, HRR follows the same trend as Pmax due to reduced CT and energy density of mixture [1,160]. Furthermore, the CD is prolonging with increasing λ the reason for this slower CV owing to the greater value of λ [161]. Consequently, the larger value of λ causes to prolong ID due to reduction of CT tends to lower the LFS of methanol [159]. Also, Pmax is decreasing and the corresponding CA moves linearly away from TDC when the EGR rate increases this may stem from two reasons [162,163]. Firstly, the in-cylinder temperature reduces and the fall in temperature has a detrimental effect on combustion [164]. Secondly, the increment of the EGR rate contributes to the reduction of the oxygen that leads to slow down the reaction rate of the combustion [165]. Additionally, HRR is decreasing while increasing the EGR rate due to the thermochemical dilution effect caused by EGR consequently, CD and ID are prolonging [166]. Table 6 reports the effect of various operational parameters on combustion characteristics of methanol fuelled SI engines."
14,Effect of operational parameters on combustion characteristics of ethanol powered SI engines,"6.2 Effect of operational parameters on combustion characteristics of ethanol powered SI engines Pmax is increasing as the load and speed increase due to the greater LHV causes to enhance VE and faster LFS that helps to improve the burning rate. Further, HRR follows an almost identical vogue with Pmax and corresponding CA moves forward due to greater availability of oxygen which improves the CE. Also, CD and ID shortening attributed to greater LFS and oxygen enrichment resulting in improved burning velocity [96,167]. Moreover, ethanol direct injection (EDI), Pmax starts to rise earlier and peak values are higher than ethanol pot injection (EPI) attributed to lower CT induced by greater LHV of ethanol [174,175]. Also, higher LHV can provide a more cooling effect to the intake charge that causes to suppress the tendency of engine knocking especially for EDI [176]. Meanwhile, the effect of charge cooling tends to reduce in-cylinder temperature and rise the VE [177]. Consequently, HRR pursues the aforementioned trend associated with Pmax thereby EDI expose higher and quite faster HRR relative to EPI [178]. The CD and ID of EDI are shortening because ethanol has greater LFS so that early flame development occurs rapidly accordingly, MFB is faster than gasoline [179,180]. Moreover, the impact of operational parameters on combustion characteristics while the SI engine is fuelled with ethanol is illustrated in Fig. 12 . Furthermore, Pmax increases when the ignition timing is advanced due to the higher charge cooling effect provided by ethanol. This meliorates combustion rate and CE by rising the extension of combustion products into profitable energy [150]. Furthermore, HRR increases and the CD is shortening due to the higher Pmax and in-cylinder temperature that enhances the combustion rate [175]. In addition, ID is shortening because of lower ignition energy needed and greater flame velocity that making it easier to ignite and burn quicker [181]. Moreover, Pmax and HRR are increasing with advancing IT due to improved mixture by providing more time to form homogenous mixture rather than retarding IT [182,183]. Advancing the IT can shorten the CD by intensifying the formation of homogeneous mixture whereas retarded IT causes poor quality of the mixture. It may be caused by the LHV of ethanol that deteriorate the combustion and hence CD increases for retarded IT [184]. Further, ID is shortening while IT advances due to quicker evaporation and faster flame development period [185]. However, the formation of the air-fuel mixture is worsening consequently, it deteriorates the combustion by extending the CD [181,186]. Moreover, Pmax and HRR are increasing with increasing IP it is obvious fact that higher IP incites in improve the atomization and mixture formation. Therefore, higher IP tends to escalate combustion and corresponding CA moves forward [183]. The CD and ID are shortening due to faster burning velocity with increasing IP attributed to the enhanced quality of air-fuel mixture [110,184]. Further, the addition of EGR substitutes some amount of intake air and reduces the oxygen availability, this inadequate oxygen causes to reduce the flame speed consequently Pmax reduces [187]. However, this shortage of oxygen can be compensated by greater OR of ethanol since it is oxygenated fuel. Therefore, Pmax elevates with raising the EGR rate since the added EGR gases increase the initial intake pressure due to the greater LFS. Also, it helps to accelerate burning velocity and combustion of ethanol with the aid of EGR so that HRR is increasing while the EGR rate raises [188]. Owing to higher Pmax, accelerated burning velocity is improved by EGR can lead to an increase in the MFB, shortening the CD and ID [180]. The reason for this more time is required to burning the air-fuel mixture owing to the higher LHV of ethanol, which also contributes to reducing the intake charge temperature. As a result of lowered in-cylinder temperature, EGR decreases knock propensity [189]. Table 7 describes the effect of various operational parameters on combustion characteristics of ethanol fuelled SI engines."
15,Influence of design parameters on combustion characteristics of LCA powered SI engines,"Engine design parameters include CR, combustion chamber and piston bowl geometry, injector configuration, valve timing etc. They are having a vital role while the engine fuelled with a high concentration of LCA with minor or major modifications are needed to enhance engine-out characteristics. In addition, Fig. 13 illustrates the impact of design parameters on combustion characteristics. Modifying these parameters has several noteworthy influences on combustion characteristics and this section aims to discuss the influence of design parameters explicitly."
16,Effect of design parameters on combustion characteristics of methanol powered SI engines,"7.1 Effect of design parameters on combustion characteristics of methanol powered SI engines Methanol has a higher OR, indicating that it is possible to use it in a higher CR without the occurrence of engine knocking [194]. Therefore, higher CR resulting in higher Pmax, HRR and starts to rise earlier than gasoline due to the higher VE provided by greater LHV of methanol [77]. Also, greater in-cylinder temperature and LFS contribute to increasing the Pmax at higher CR [195]. Owing to greater LFS, the CD and ID shorten as CR increases also it is one of the reasons for the CA of Pmax moves forward towards TDC [55]. Further, the thinly coated combustion chamber exhibits higher Pmax attributed to the improved flame velocity and the coated surface leads to complete combustion. The surface accelerates pre-flame reactions and leads to an increase in the burning velocity of methanol resulting in higher HRR [196]. Furthermore, the coated surface of the combustion chamber shortens the CD and ID attributed to pre-flame reactions since methanol has a higher LFS [197]. Hence, the application of methanol in the coated combustion chamber can improve combustion, flame propagation and lower the crevices flow energy [198]. Moreover, asymmetric spray line distribution has a negative impact on spatial distribution and worsen the mixture concentration around the spark plug region. On the contrary to the former, symmetric spray line distribution forms an ideal air-fuel mixture and improves the combustion rate consequently, Pmax and HRR increasing [199]. Accordingly, CD and ID are shortening due to reduced pre-ignition preparation time caused by symmetric spray distribution that enhances the burning velocity of methanol [155]. Table 8 reports the influence of various design parameters on combustion characteristics of methanol fuelled SI engines."
17,Effect of design parameters on combustion characteristics of ethanol powered SI engines,"7.2 Effect of design parameters on combustion characteristics of ethanol powered SI engines Ethanol can be operated at higher CR without knocking due to greater OR and modifying CR can improve the engine responses for the ethanol fuelled SI engine. Therefore, increasing CR leads to an increase in the Pmax and starts to rise earlier also the greater value of Pmax can be obtained than gasoline [77]. Two key explanations for this situation are thought to be found and firstly ethanol provides greater VE since it has higher LHV than gasoline. Secondly, the greater LFS and oxygen content of ethanol contributes to the complete combustion [204]. Both factors can provide a better combustion atmosphere as a result Pmax increase the work done by the piston when compared with gasoline [205]. Further, HRR is reducing and peak value takes place earlier than gasoline attributed to the faster LFS. Also, ethanol has a single boiling point and lower boiling point compared to gasoline that constitutes a lower value of HRR [77]. During the initial phases of combustion, MFB is increasing because higher CR accelerates the combustion rate of ethanol [115,206]. Moreover, the CD is extending since less fuel is injected, the mixture is leaner and the flame propagation speed is slower at lower engine loads. Conversely, faster combustion can be achieved at higher loads as a result of more fuel injection, richer mixture and faster LFS consequently, the CD is shortening. However, the CD shortens with increasing CR at higher engine loads which lead to a faster combustion rate [195]. Most of the studies are carried out based on combustion chamber modification only and other studies related to engine design parameters are limited. Further, more future studies are recommended to understand to influence of various design parameters on engine-out characteristics. Table 9 describes the effect of various design parameters on combustion characteristics of ethanol fuelled SI engines."
18,Challenges and enhancing techniques for the application of LCA in SI engines,"The LCA have several positive impacts on engine-out characteristics of SI engine concerning the aforesaid discussion. Although, a few challenges are arising when the engine is fuelled with LCA and some techniques are employed to overcome the challenges as shown in Fig. 14 . This section is assigned for the discussion of various difficulties and strategies for overcoming them. The LCA have exhibit starting problem in cold environmental especially at higher concentration owing to their lower volatility. As a result, current interests are growing among the researchers towards DI rather than PFI in order to improve the cold starting efficiency [180]. Therefore, DI of alcohols can provide a potential for overcoming drawbacks and taking full advantage of alcohols [174]. Also, dual fuel injection is an efficient strategy for alcohols that incorporates PFI and DI to furnish fuel blending [150]. Further, the Reid vapour pressure of alcohols can cause the cold starting issue during the warmup stage due to their lower volatility properties and it needs certain engine modification. To avert these modifications adding additives like extremely volatile gasoline, butane, pentane and reorienting the blend concentration are recommended thereby improving cold start and anti-knock efficiency [210]. Generally, LCA has a higher density than gasoline which contributes substantial resistance to the fuel flow that harms fuel injection. Consequently, the fuel pump supplies less alcohol than gasoline to the injector can result in inferior fuel atomization and combustion [211]. Therefore, the fuel pump and injector must be modified to increase the flow capacity to maintain peak power and material compatibility issues often apply to the internals of the pump and injector. Also, the higher viscosity of alcohols is leading to issues in fuel droplet size, spray characteristics, quality of atomization and combustion. However, the usance of LCA will exacerbate the corrosion on the ferrous and non-ferrous materials compared to gasoline [15]. Also, alcohols can cause the elastomers in the fuel system to shrink, swell, harden and soften especially at a higher concentration of alcohol. Therefore, classes of elastomers compatible with alcohols are used like fluorocarbon elastomers or nitrile butadiene rubbers and polymeric material [36,212]. The methanol Institute furnishes technical directions on the suitableness of metals and elastomers for the usance of methanol [213]. In the view of the fuel system, using corrosion inhibitors as an additive significantly increase the anti-corrosive and anti-rust characteristics to attain engine durability [214]. Also, it is well discernible that there is an increment in the BSFC to produce the same power as gasoline since alcohols have a lower HV and energy content [215]. To overcome this quandary higher CR is proposed because BSFC is reducing in higher CR rather than lower CR [216]. Furthermore, utilization of alcohols cause a raise in thermomechanical stress in the cylinder head due to significantly improved cooling and reduced intake temperature, hence counter steps are needed [217]. Moreover, phase separation is one of the major concerns about alcohol blends especially the blend that contains a higher concentration of alcohol. The phase separation happens as the gasoline is contaminated with adequate water, resulting in two separate distinct layers in the storage tank. As a solution, employing dispenser filters can solve the issue by slowing down the fuel flow from the dispenser when the filters detecting phase separation [218]. Therefore, higher aliphatic alcohols like benzyl alcohol (C7H8O), cyclohexanol (C6H12O), tert-butanol (C4H10O), ethyl tert-butyl ether (C6H14O) and toluene (C7H8) are often blended with alcohol-gasoline blends to lower the phase separation temperature [219,220]. However, reduction of temperature above a certain limit result in gasoline degradation, vanishing a portion of oxygen, decrement in OR and volatility consequently worsen the combustion [69,221]. However, challenges of alcohol fuels in SI engines may be reduced by improving techniques on the view of fuel and engine modification as well in the future. The following section is dedicated to the discussion of the future perspective of LCA in SI engines."
19,Future directions of low carbon alcohols application in SI engines,"From the above arguments, the usance of LCA discloses that there have been substantial improvements made. For a variety of factors, LCA are considered to be a crucial and propitious alternative fuel for SI engines and are aggressively pursued on a global scale. The changes have to concentrate on the engine design parameters such as CR, optimization of IT and air-fuel mixture to improve the CE [222]. As discussed above, the physiochemical properties of fuels have a significant influence on the combustion system. Therefore, the approaches towards the development of nano additives compatible with LCA have to encourage in future. Apart from the fuel aspect, the development and optimization of hardware systems like combustion chamber, injector configuration, injection strategies, EGR and turbo/supercharger systems are essential to improve the combustion characteristics. Also, some studies state that noteworthy improvements are achievable by adopting current technologies rather than concentrating entirely on new technologies [223]. Moreover, incorporating advanced combustion modes with SI engines can obtain full advantages of LCA. It is expected that advanced improvements in combustion systems would reduce fuel consumption on their own [224]. In addition, research and development of modern storage, fuel supply systems and compatibility technologies for the engine to overcome corrosion caused by alcohols have a significant role in the future [37]. Over the last decade, extensive studies have been investigated by many authors to understand the combustion characteristics. Even though, LCA has many positive responses in the engine they are yet to meet the commercial scale due to production and compatibility limitations. Therefore, increasing usance of alcohol consumption in the engine probably create an imbalance in the fuel demand and supply system. Besides, the ultimate aim around the globe is to reduce the fuel consumption of the engine and it can be reduced by hybridization of LCA powered SI engines even more in the future [225]. However, more researches are undergoing in the area of alcohol production, performance and emission characteristics but combustion aspect studies are limited. Therefore, more research works are required for the complete understanding of combustion and this void may fill in the future. Fig. 15 describes the future directions for the application of LCA."
20,Summary and conclusion,"This review article holistically compiles and highlights the investigations on the combustion characteristics of LCA powered SI engines. In this review work, the researchers have investigated the information about the parameters such as blend ratio, supplementary fuels, engine operational and design parameters. It was explicitly understood that the aforementioned parameters have a significant influence on combustion characteristics. This study provides an illuminative overview of combustion characteristics and may encourage the readers to bridge some research gaps. Moreover, several physicochemical properties of LCA have a positive impact on combustion characteristics. Also, they have a negative response on phase separation, vapour locking and cold starting problems. To overcome these issues blending of alcohols with gasoline in various concentration are encouraged. Moreover, lower and medium-level blends are having almost identical trends conversely higher-level blends exhibit different trends from the former on combustion characteristics. Additionally, supplementary fuels for alcohols are recommended by many researchers to improve combustion. Further, n-butanol, iso-butanol and hydrogen are used as supplementary fuels to methanol and results shows that combustion characteristics are improved. Besides, investigation of ancillary fuels with methanol are inadequate and more researches is needed in future. In the case of ethanol, more studies are carried out on supplementary fuels like n-butanol, iso-butanol, DEE, DME and cycloalkanes resulting in positive responses on combustion characteristics. Furthermore, the impact of ignition timing, modes of injection, IT, IP, EGR, CR, injector configuration and combustion chamber have been studied. Modifying aforestated parameters shows the beneficial results in combustion characteristics and it may direct the readers to optimize the parameters to achieve improved combustion. However, the challenges can arise due to the application of alcohols in SI and novel techniques are used to mitigate the challenges. Therefore, developing new technology as well as adopting current technologies can have the prominence to achieving the next level in alcohols usage. Thereby, the authors suggest that future investigations should concentrate on the aforementioned areas, which can contribute significantly to the development and implementation of the engine to satisfy demands in the market."
