0,Introduction,"The lignocellulosic residue is an attractive renewable material for the production of biofuels due to its availability in high quantities and at reasonable costs [1]. In addition to the advantage of its abundance, the bagasse has high concentration of carbohydrates [2]. Currently, Brazil is the largest sugarcane producer, with approximately 9.7 million hectares cultivated. During the 2016/2017 harvest, ethanol production in Brazil was 27,254 thousand m3. During this harvest, 651,841 tons of sugarcane were processed [3]. The feasibility of using sugarcane bagasse (SCB) in biotechnological processes requires establishing hydrolysis methods of this substrate to make the carbohydrates in cellulose and hemicellulose available to microorganisms [4]. Meanwhile, due to the complexity of SCB components, it is evident that this lignocellulosic biomass is difficult to be fully degraded by only a single bacterial species, the conversion of this substrate into H2 requires many stages, including substrate pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation [5]. The main purpose of the pretreatment of SCB is to change or remove the lignin and/or hemicellulose structure, decrease the crystallinity of cellulose, and increase the substrate surface area in order to benefit the enzymes accessing cellulose for a more efficient recovery of fermentable sugars [6]. Hydrothermal pretreatment of SCB eliminates these barriers by solubilizing hemicellulose and breaking down the lignin structure [7]. This technology has been employed in many recent studies of hydrogen and methane production from SCB [5,8–12]. The molecular mechanisms behind the biological conversion of SCB into biofuel were studied [13]. The authors suggested that proteolytic, cellulolytic and methanogenic microorganisms such as Coprothermobacter, Clostridium, and Methanothermobacter, respectively, had a substantial syntrophic role in fuel production employing lignocellulosic substrates. The biological degradation of cellulosic material (SCB) by anaerobic microorganisms occurs through the enzymatic activity of the cellulolytic complex, such as exocellulases, endo-β-1,4-glucanase, α-galactosidase, polygalacturonase and glycoamylase [14,15]. Anaerobic bacteria, like some species of Clostridium, have an enzymatic complex that, in addition to other enzymes, produces cellulases that are capable of breaking down cellulose molecules into glucose. This complex, known as cellulosome, is responsible for the depolymerization of cellulose and is basically formed by a specialized integrating protein called cypA in which different catalytic compounds are inserted [16]. Bacteria similar to Clostridium are responsible for the H2 production in fermentation processes and have hydrogenase enzymes in their metabolism [17,18]. Hydrogenase enzymes are generally grouped into two classes based on the type of metal that is present in their catalytic centers: those containing iron alone are called [FeFe]-hydrogenases, and those containing nickel and iron are called [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Some enzymes may contain selenium, in addition to nickel and iron at the catalytic center, which are called [NiFeSe]-hydrogenases [19,20]. The main hydrogenases that act in H2 production are [FeFe]-hydrogenase and [NiFe]-hydrogenase [21]. Obligatory anaerobic microorganisms, such as Clostridium sp. convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by means of pyruvate-ferrodoxine-oxyrreductase (PFOR) transferring protons and electrons to ferrodoxin (Fd). Fd releases hydrogen by the action of hydrogenase [22]. The ability of C. butyricum to produce butyric acid using simple sugars is already used in the chemical industry [23]. The metabolic versatility associated with biomass decomposition and fermentation is particularly important in the production of second-generation biofuels (ethanol and hydrogen from cellulose). Moreover, C. butyricum strain has excellent H2 production activity, both in batch and continuous reactors [24]. Thus, hydrogen, volatile organic acids and alcohols were obtained from the acidogenic fermentation of glucose, cellulose and SCB in batch-operated reactors, using pure culture of Clostridium butyricum as inoculum source. The development and adaptation of this culture and the operation of the reactors were performed at mesophilic temperature, under different metal conditions in the culture medium. Through this research, the influence of metals (Fe, Ni and Se) on the metabolic routes performed by the strain used was evaluated. On the other hand, endogenous microorganisms from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) may also contribute significantly for lignocellulose biomass treatment and hydrogen production. Soares et al. [10] studied the bioconversion of SCB into value-added products and the authors identified microbial consortium capable of degrading lignocellulosic biomass in the SCB (Streptomyces, Paenibacillus, Stenotrophomonas and Sphingomonas). The effects of substrate concentration (0.8–9.2 g/L) and pH (4.6–7.4) on hydrogen and volatile fatty acids (VFA) production from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) were investigated in batch reactors [25]. The authors employed a fermentative bacterial consortium from the anaerobic hydrogen-producing reactor with cellulose as substrate. According to the authors, autochthonous cellulolytic bacteria, such as Clostridium, Bacteroides and Paenibacillus were identified in the autoclaved SCB and probably acted in synergism with the fermentative consortium for the bioconversion of SCB into hydrogen and VFA. Finally, research on renewable energy sources is important and the production of H2 from SCB by fermentative microorganisms emerges as an alternative energy to overcome the dependence on fossil fuels (oil, coal and natural gas), as well as minimizing the environmental impacts caused by excessive use of fossil fuels and the inadequate disposal and treatment of these agro-industrial wastes. In addition, the use of economically viable and environmentally abundant substrates (cellulose and SCB) is advantageous for the large-scale biological production of energy. In this context, the purpose of this research was to study how the presence of metals (iron, nickel and selene) influences the biological production of H2, volatile organic acids and alcohols by Clostridium butyricum using cellulose (5 g/L), glucose (5 g/L) or SCB (5 g/L) as substrates in anaerobic batch reactors at mesophilic condition."
1,Material and methods,
2,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum The inoculum used was a fermentative and a cellulolytic culture of Clostridium butyricum CCT 7470 acquired from the André Tosello Foundation (Campinas, SP, Brazil). The strain was initially acclimated for 96 h in RCM (Reinforced clostridial medium) medium that contained 13 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L peptone, 5 g/L glucose, 1 g/L soluble starch, 5 g/L sodium chloride, 3 g/L sodium acetate, 0.5 g/L cysteine hydrochloride and 0.5 g/L agar at pH 6.8 ± 0.2. The acclimation of this strain was carried out with Duran® flasks of 5.0 l as reactors with 2.0 L of culture medium, which were submitted to N2 flux (100%) for 20 min in the headspace in order to maintain the anaerobic environment atmosphere. The reactors were closed with butyl cap and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h."
3,Culture media,"2.2 Culture media After the microbial acclimation period, C. butyricum was inoculated in three culture media to select a suitable medium for hydrogen production, with different compositions as described in Table 1 . The three culture media were PCS (peptone cellulose cultured solution) described by Haruta et al. [26], Jiang medium used to enhance hydrogen production by Clostridium butyricum [27] and Cellulose Anaerobe medium used for developing mixed cultures of anaerobic cellulose-degrading bacteria [28]. Vitamin solution was added to the Cellulose Anaerobe medium [28] (Table 2 ). Vitamin solution was prepared by the dissolution of the components in ultra-purified water and filtered in a Millipore® system, with a membrane filter of 0.22 μm porosity, previously autoclaved at 121 °C and 1 atm pressure for 20 min. The three culture media described were tested in H2 production assays in mesophilic condition (37 °C). These media were used as a nutrient source for C. butyricum growth using 5 g/L cellulose as substrate and 20% (v/v) of inoculum obtained from the acclimatization in RCM medium. Batch reactors were operated in triplicate with a final volume of 250 mL (100 mL of reaction volume plus 150 mL of headspace) and submitted to N2 (100%) atmosphere for 20 min for gas exchange in the headspace reaction volume, in order to favor the anaerobic condition. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6 with HCl solution (1 M) and the reactors were incubated at 37 °C. Cell growth monitoring during the H2 production assay was performed by optical density (OD600 nm). The culture medium employed in the assay with higher hydrogen production and greater cell growth was selected as microbial culture for hydrogen production assays employing metals (Fe, Ni and Se), in which the biomass was centrifuged at 6000 rpm at 27 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the concentrated biomass was resuspended and inoculated in Cellulose Anaerobe medium containing 5 g/L glucose as carbon source, which was inoculated for the H2 production assays with different metal conditions and different substrate sources."
4,Hydrogen production assay employing metals,"2.3 Hydrogen production assay employing metals The H2 production assays were performed under anaerobic condition employing 250 mL Duran® reactors closed with butyl cap. These reactors contained 80 mL of anaerobic cellulose medium [28], 20 mL of inoculum (20% v/v), 5 g/L cellulose (Stage 1), 5 g/L glucose (Stage 2) and 5 g/L of hydrothermal pretreated SCB (Stage 3) as substrate. All the assays were performed in triplicate at 37 °C. In order to provide an anaerobic environment N2 (100%) was fluxed into the culture medium and in the headspace of the reactors for 20 min. Three experimental series were conducted: in stages 1 and 2 in relation to the composition of the essential metals for hydrogenases synthesis in the culture medium [29]. A (25 μM Fe), B (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni) and C (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni + 1 μM Se). In the best metal condition employed in stage 1 and 2, an H2 production assay was performed using 5 g/L hydrothermally pretreated SCB (stage 3) instead of cellulose and glucose as carbon source. The SCB used in this study was supplied by São Martinho sugar mill (Pradópolis, SP, Brazil). The SCB (5 g) was pretreated using a 100 mL capacity hydrothermal system, 20 bar pressure at 200 °C for 10 min [8], the solid fraction was employed as substrate in the H2 production assay at the end of the pretreatment (Stage 3). The SCB composition before pretreatment was 31.4% cellulose, 36.6% xylan, 5.0% arabinan, 24.8% lignin, and 1.2% ash [30]. The hydrothermal-pretreated SCB was mainly composed of 57.5% of cellulose, 6.6% of hemicellulose [31], 14% of klason lignin, 2.7% of ashes, 28.2 mg/L of metals (Al, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn) [13]."
5,Physicochemical and chromatographic analyses,"2.4 Physicochemical and chromatographic analyses Hydrogen was monitored by gas chromatography (GC) 2010 (Shimadzu®, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Carboxen 1010 PLOT column (30 m × 0.53 mm) [32]. H2 yield was calculated by the amount of these biogas accumulations in the headspace per amount of carbohydrate consumed. The quantification of volatile organic acids (VOA) was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), equipped with a refractive index detector (RID-10A), UV diode array detector (SPD-M10Avp), LC-10ADvp Pump, CTO-20A oven, SCL 10 Avp controller and Aminex HPX-87H column, 300 mm × 7.8 mm (BioRad®, Hercules, CA) The mobile phase consisted of H2SO4 (0.01 N) at 0.5 mL/min flow rate [33,34]. Alcohols were determined by gas chromatography (GC) equipped with an HP-INNOWax column and flame ionization detector using H2 as carrier gas with synthetic air and N2 as auxiliary gas [35]. Determination of total volatile solids (TVS) and pH were conducted following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater [36], whereas carbohydrates were carried out indirectly by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using glucose as standard [37]."
6,Kinetic analysis,"2.5 Kinetic analysis The experimental data were adjusted to the average values obtained from triplicates using the Origin® 9.0 software (OriginLab®, Northampton, MA). The data of the accumulated H2 and CH4 production were adjusted using the modified Gompertz equation (Equation (1)) [38]. (1) H = P ⋅ exp { − exp [ R m ⋅ e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } Where: P = H2 potential production (mmol/L) Rm = H2 production rate (mmol/h) t = time (hours) e = Euler's number (2.71828) λ = lag phase time - phase that precedes the onset of H2 and CH4 production (hours) The number of generation time – the amount of time required for a population to double the number of cells (g) (Eq. (3)) was calculated according to quoted by Pelczar [39] and Madigan [40]. (2) N = N02n (3) g = t/n Where: N = Final cell number (OD600) N0 = initial cell number (OD600) n = the number of generations during the period of exponential growth t = duration of exponential growth (hours) g = generation time (hours)"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Culture medium assays,"3.1 Culture medium assays After the strain reactivation in RCM medium, assays with three culture media were performed using 5 g/L cellulose as a carbon source to choose the more suitable medium composition for hydrogen fermentation. The results obtained in these assays confirmed the importance of the medium complexity for C. butyricum growth. In addition, this strain can be used as inoculum for H2 production from cellulose as carbon and energy source. Cellulose is composed of a long chain of glucose molecules bonded together by glycosidic bonds [41]. In order to break down this complex structure, it is necessary to hydrolyze these chains releasing the five- and six-carbon sugars with subsequent fermentation to produce biohydrogen [42]. Many Clostridium species were observed with potential to breakdown the cellulose molecule, since, the required enzymes known as cellulolytic enzymes are found in those microorganisms, such as Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium ljungdahlii, Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium phytofermentan, Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Clostridium papyrosolvens among many others [42–44]. In this study, H2 production by C. butyricum was observed for approximately 80 h in PCS and Jiang culture media. However, when Cellulose Anaerobe medium was tested, the accumulated H2 production and cell growth were observed until 110 h, although with lower H2 production rate (Fig. 1 , Table 3 ). The highest H2 potential production was observed for Cellulose Anaerobe medium (5.15 ± 0.17 mmol/L) when compared to Jiang (3.08 ± 0.03 mmol/L) and PCS (2.25 ± 0.08 mmol/L) medium, but this value did not correspond to higher H2 production rate, which was 0.23 ± 0.05 mmol/L h−1, 0.78 ± 0.5 mmol/L h−1 and 0.15 ± 0.01 mmol/L h−1 for PCS, Jiang and Cellulose Anaerobe media, respectively. Therefore, the highest H2 production rate was obtained with 6 g/L of yeast extract in Jiang medium compared to PCS (1 g/L yeast extract) and Cellulose Anaerobe (2 g/L yeast extract) media. The yeast extract is a nitrogen source capable of stimulating bacterial cell growth and consequently increasing the biological H2 production rate [45]. The higher H2 production using Cellulose Anaerobe medium may have occurred due to the presence of different compounds in this culture medium, such as metal ions (cobalt, zinc, aluminum, boron and magnesium) and a complex vitamin solution. These compounds may have influenced the enzymes interaction of endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, β-glucosidases, glucosyl hydrolases and exoglucanases, thus increasing the H2 production [46]. These enzymatic complexes act in synergy to break down the cellulose polymers, which follow sequential routes in the cellulose conversion in products with energy value such as H2 and organic acids [47]. Calcium is another key element for microorganisms. The role of calcium in bacteria is related to the cell wall and the external environment of the bacteria, mainly by the activation of exoenzymes [48]. In this study, the addition of 20 mM Ca (5 g/L CaCO3) in PCS medium did not favor higher H2 production when compared to that observed in Cellulose Anaerobe medium employing a much lower calcium concentration (0.19 mM). Calcium may be involved not only in the cell wall but is also related to metabolic changes, in addition to influencing the structure of the microbial community. Microorganisms exhibit a series of metabolic responses to the excess of intracellular and extracellular Ca2+, affecting the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids (mainly alanine and glutamate), amines, 3-hydroxybutyrate, organic acids such as acetate, thus these compounds can directly influence the uptake of carbon sources in anaerobic processes [49]. In this study, the presence of various chemical elements was essential for microbial metabolism. Thus, although the PCS medium had the presence of calcium, it was the most deficient in essential micronutrients. This fact is also confirmed by Lynd et al. [51], which observed that some cellulolytic microbial species need complex nutritional requirements for growth that include nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, as well as macro and microminerals, as well as various vitamins. Among the culture media tested in this study, the Cellulose Anaerobe medium was the most complex and, probably favored this higher H2 production. Higher λ phase (18.29 ± 1.04 h) was observed in the condition using PCS medium, in contrast to Cellulose Anaerobe medium, whose start time for H2 production was 9.95 ± 1.52 h. In a study of H2 production by a fermentative bacterial consortium (predominance of Clostridium, Bacillus and Enterobacter), the authors observed higher λ phase (2.1 d) using PCS medium and 5 g/L hydrothermal pretreated SCB [25]. The composition of the culture medium may have influenced the duration of the phase preceding the onset of H2 production (λ phase). Cellulosomes are multi-enzymatic complexes associated with the cell surface and mediate binding of the microorganism to insoluble substrates, such as cellulose, converting them into soluble compounds as simpler sugars which are absorbed by cells [52]. Thus, in this study, both the culture medium and specific compounds such as phosphorus, calcium and iron may have influenced these kinetic parameters of H2 production. Another element that may have favored a better performance of C. butyricum in H2 production is manganese. This metal (12 mM manganese) was only present in the Celullose Anaerobe medium (5 g/L MnSO4). Manganese-binding proteins are essential in the physiology of some members of the genus Clostridium [53,54] by taking part in cation homeostasis [55], nutrient acquirement promoted by carbon metabolism [56], signal transduction [57], resistance to oxidative stress [58] and nutrient deficiency stress [59]. In addition to manganese, another element that may have influenced the H2 production rate (Rm) is phosphorus. Greater Rm was observed using Jiang medium (0.78 ± 0.5 mmol/L h−1) and it was also the medium with the highest phosphorus concentration among the three culture media tested (9 g/L of phosphate compounds), compared with 0.47 g/L phosphate compounds in the Cellulose Anaerobe medium and the absence of phosphate compound in PCS medium (Table 1). According to Lynd et al. [51], the entry of glucose and other oligomers into the microbial cell varies among cellulolytic species, but the involvement of classical transmembrane transport systems involving ATP (adenosine triphosphate) has been evidenced and consequently the use of phosphate compounds in the medium may interfere with this process. The cellulose degradation occurs primarily by the secretion of extracellular enzymes that will hydrolyze this polymer, releasing compounds known as cellodextrins, which are carried into the cell via the transport system involving phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). After this process, there is the intracellular breakdown of these compounds mediated by phosphorylases, thus releasing glucose-1-phosphate followed by the glycolytic route (Embden-Meyerhof pathway) [51], so the presence of phosphorus in the medium can enhance the degradation and assimilation of cellulose degradation products, thereby increasing H2 production. In this study, the H2 production stabilization was correlated with the end of cell growth in all conditions studied (Fig. 1). Low density (OD600 of 0.27 at 40 h) was obtained from C. butyricum in series A (PCS medium) when lower H2 production (2.25 ± 0.08 mmol/L) was observed. For this condition, longer time (21 h) for the onset of cell growth (λ phase) was required. Accumulated H2 production of 3.08 ± 0.03 mmol/L was observed in series B (Jiang medium), as well as higher cell growth value (OD600 of 0.45 in 73 h). On the other hand, for series C (Cellulose Anaerobe medium) cell growth of 0.86 (OD600) in 43 h accompanied by H2 production of 5.15 ± 0.17 mmol/L were observed, demonstrating that Cellulose Anaerobe is the most suitable culture medium for this microbial strain with respect to cellulose degradation for H2 production. Cell growth (OD600) of C. butyricum was also evaluated during H2 production in batch reactors at 37 °C and with 3 g/L glucose as substrate [60]. For conditions with more complex culture media (Jiang and Cellulose anaerobe), cell growth was initiated immediately after inoculation, as observed by Seppala et al. [60] with maximum cellular growth of 2.07 (OD600) in 7.5 h of the exponential phase. In the present study the exponential phase time was higher for all conditions employed (19 h, 11 h and 40 h for series A, B and C, respectively) and OD600 lower than that observed by Seppala et al. (2011). Probably, this was due to the more complex substrate employed in this study (5 g/L cellulose). According to Fig. 1, the pattern of H2 production by C. butyricum was similar to the growth curve (OD600) for all conditions employed (series A, B and C). Different from the results obtained by Chen et al. (2005) where the dynamics of H2 production was studied with C. butyricum and 17.8 g/L sucrose. In this condition, H2 production began in the middle of the exponential growth phase. This difference may be due to the inoculation with an active culture of gas production (using RCM medium with 15 g/L glucose in reactivation phase) or the use of different strains and culture media [60]. Thus, the onset of H2 production corresponded to the beginning of cell growth, a fact also observed by Seppala et al. [60]."
9,H2 production assays under different metal conditions,"3.2 H2 production assays under different metal conditions After the assays for the culture medium selection, the Cellulose Anaerobe medium was chosen as more favorable for H2 production by C. butyricum. Therefore, different substrates (cellulose, glucose, SCB) and metal conditions (Fe, Ni and Se) were used in this culture medium. The initial phase of H2 production (the first 10 h) followed the same trend for all studied conditions in the cellulose assays. It is probable that the enrichment of the inoculum (5 g/L glucose, for 24 h) prior to inoculation favored the development of this bacteria in all metal conditions employed (A - C) (Fig. 2 ). Although C. butyricum is known as an effective H2 producer [61,62], there are few studies regarding H2 performance of a pure strain of C. butyricum. Moreover, the relationship between H2 production and cell growth of C. butyricum has not yet been revealed in detail. Greater cumulative H2 production was observed in condition A (25 μM Fe), 6.52 mmol/L at 44 h. Lower amount of H2 was verified for a longer period in the other conditions, for condition B (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni) the accumulated H2 production was 5.26 mmol/L at 87 h. Lower values were recorded for conditions C (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni + 1 μM Se) and D (without metal), being 4.62 mmol/L and 4.15 mmol/L at 68 h, respectively. Apparently, increment of Fe2+ is extremely essential to H2 production activity of C. butyricum strain. This is acceptable because Fe2+ is known as a crucial cofactor of hydrogenase responsible for H2 production in acidogenic bacteria, such as C. butyricum. [25,63] Studies suggest that an iron-carrying complex, ferredoxin, mediates the electron transfer of reducing energy in the route to hydrogenase-catalyzed H2 production [64,65]. Iron is also involved with the enzymatic complexes FHL (formate-hydrogen-lyase), which are related to the [FeNi]-hydrogenases [66], with endoglucanases in cellulose degradation [67] and in the cellulases themselves. The presence of cellulases in the Clostridia class, unlike those found in aerobic fungi, contains a sulfhydryl group that is stimulated by iron to assist in the degradation of cellulose [68], thus, iron is an essential ion for the conversion of complex polymers in SCB into H2. As observed in the cellulose assay, higher accumulated H2 production was obtained in the glucose assay for condition A (25 μM Fe), 15.9 mmol/L at 30 h. In the other studied conditions, H2 production was lower, in condition B (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni) the accumulated H2 production was 12.6 mmol/L at 30 h. Lower values were recorded for conditions C (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni + 1 μM Se) and D (without metal), which were 10.6 mmol/L and 8.7 mmol/L at 30 h and 45 h, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 4 ). The main groups of hydrogenases have common characteristics in their structure, mainly related to active sites of the molecule. These structures include the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN-) groups bound to iron ions (Fe) [69,70]. The presence of Ni in some [NiFe]-hydrogenases have additional cysteine groups attached to the molecules. These cysteine groups can also be replaced by selenocysteine, known as [NiFeSe]-hydrogenases [71]. These changes in the molecular conformation may alter H2 production, as observed in this study. The [FeFe]-hydrogenases are related to the reduction of protons, whereas the [NiFe] are mainly involved in the generation of energy by the oxidation of H2. However, the [NiFe]-hydrogenases require microaerobic environments in which O2 is the final electron acceptor [71]. Since the reactors in this study were under strict anaerobic conditions, the functionality of [NiFe]-hydrogenases were decreased compared to [FeFe]-hydrogenases. The H2 production in the assay with selenium addition (condition C) promoted low H2 production compared to conditions A and B. This was due to the fact that the hydrogenase efficiency is related to Fe–S interactions with the molecules [72]. In the [FeNiSe]-hydrogenases, the cysteine terminal, which provide the sulfur grouping, are replaced by selenocysteine [71]. This substitution may promote reduced H2 production by microorganisms, as observed in this study. Fig. 4 shows the H2 production rates (Rm) for all conditions using cellulose (Fig. 4a) and glucose (Fig. 4b) as substrate. For Rm of the reactors fed with cellulose and with 25 μM Fe in the medium (A), a maximum value of 0.32 mmol/Lh−1 at 11 h was observed. For this condition, higher H2 production rate was verified but at a longer incubation period when compared to the other conditions studied. Differing from that observed in the cellulose assay, Rm of condition B (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni in the medium) has a maximum value of 2.0 mmol/L h−1 at 8.5 h in the glucose assay. For this condition, a higher H2 production rate was observed at a shorter incubation period when compared to the other studied conditions. Besides cellulose, hydrothermally pretreated SCB can be used for H2 production by C. butyricum (Fig. 5 ). For the condition with 5 g/L SCB H2 production rate (Rm) of 0.14 mmol/L h−1, a longer incubation time was observed. Due to the higher complexity of the substrate, this H2 production rate was 56.2% and 84.6% lower when compared to cellulose and glucose assays in the same metal condition, respectively. Higher H2 production rates (Rm) were observed in a study that evaluated the effects of cellulose concentration in Rm using cow manure as inoculum [73]. The authors observed 0.42 mmol/L h−1 and 0.65 mmol/L h−1 for 5 g/L and 10 g/L cellulose, respectively. It is worth mentioning that in the present study a pure culture of C. butyricum was used as inoculum, different from the complex inoculum used by these authors, which probably provided greater enzymatic variety, favoring a higher H2 production rate. Hydrogen production was also evaluated by a microbial consortium (Clostridium, Bacillus, Bacteroides and Paenibacillus) in batch reactors with PCS medium and 5 g/L of hydrothermally pretreated SCB at mesophilic condition [11]. The authors observed higher H2 production (5.33 mmol/L) compared to the present study that employed a pure culture of C. butyricum as inoculum. The H2 potential production (P) was higher for condition A (25 μM Fe), for both cellulose (6.06 ± 0.20 mmol/L) and glucose (16.01 ± 0.88 mmol/L) assays. In a study of H2 production by C. butyricum in mesophilic condition, Chen et al. [24] mentioned that iron supplementation (Fe+2) was crucial for H2 production. Since it is an important cofactor for hydrogenases, responsible for H2 production in acidogenic bacteria, such as C. butyricum. [19,74]. In an iron-deficient environment, H2 production does not occur and bacterial metabolism changes from pyruvic acid formation to lactic acid formation instead of producing acetyl CoA [75]. Compared with control assays without the addition of metals (series D), the addition of Fe, Ni and Se favored the accumulated H2 production (mmol/L), for both substrates tested (5 g/L cellulose or 5 g/L glucose) (Table 4). The effect of Fe and Ni addition (separated and together) on H2 production was also evaluated by a microbial consortium with predominance of C. butyricum. [76] These assays were conducted in mesophilic condition with 9 g/L glucose, 2 g/L yeast extract, increasing concentrations of FeCl2.4H2O (2.5; 50.3; 125.7; 251.5 and 503 μM Fe) and NiCl2.6H2O (2.1; 42; 105; 210 and 420 μM Ni). The authors observed higher H2 yield (1.37 mmol H2/mmol glucose) at 125.7 and 105 μM Fe + Ni, respectively, in the culture medium. In the present study, slightly lower H2 yield (1.15 mmol H2/mmol glucose) was observed in the series with both metals in the culture medium (B - 25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni) for 5 g/L glucose (Table 5 ). Note that the phase before H2 production (λ phase) was much higher when SCB was used as substrate (16.01 h). In a study of H2 production that used 2 g/L hydrothermally pretreated SCB, similar λ phase was observed to that obtained in the present study, but employing a thermophilic consortium (17.5 h) [10]. The low availability of sugars in this substrate (SCB) compared to the substrates used in Stage 1 (cellulose) and 2 (glucose) provided a longer start time to the fermentation process (Table 4). With respect to microbial growth, as observed in the first assay for the choice of culture medium, for all substrates (glucose, cellulose and SCB) cell growth (OD600) started together with H2 production (Figs. 2–4). The microbial growth was proportional to the substrate complexity (glucose-cellulose-SCB), and the highest values (0.95, 0.67 and 0.43 for glucose, cellulose and SCB, respectively) were obtained in the presence of 25 μM Fe (condition A) and the lowest values in the absence of metals (0.75, and 0.72 for glucose and cellulose, respectively). The generation times (g) of C. butyricum cultured on cellulose (5 g/L) and glucose (5 g/L) were lower in condition A for both substrates employed (6.13 h and 3.12 h, respectively) (Table 4). Furthermore, these conditions provided greater H2 production (6.06 and 15.25 mmol/L, respectively). This showed that the condition with only 25 μM Fe in the culture medium promoted higher efficiency for that bacterial population using cellulose and glucose for H2 production. Thus, supporting the choice of this metal condition as the most suitable for H2 production from SCB. Wang et al. [77] studied H2 production from C. butyricum CGS5 using sucrose as the sole carbon source in batch reactors. The authors observed generation time of 4.5 h when higher substrate concentrate was employed (15 g/L sucrose) [78]. Another parameter evaluated in the present study was the pH. The initial pH in the batch reactors was adjusted to 7. The addition of sodium bicarbonate in all reactors condition kept the end pH at 6.7, 6.2 and 6.5 in Assays 1 (5 g/L cellulose), 2 (5 g/L glucose) and 3 (5 g/L SCB), respectively, which favored the H2 production. Maximum H2 production was also observed at pH 6.5 using SCB as substrate and elephant manure as inoculum [79]. The effect of pH was also evaluated in the degradation of 10 g/L cellulose by rumen bacteria. A 75% value of substrate degradation efficiency was observed at pH 6.8–7.3, whereas this efficiency decreased at lower pH values with no substrate degradation at pH below 4.8 [80]."
10,Soluble microbial products,"3.3 Soluble microbial products During the fermentation process, volatile organic acids were generated as intermediate products, the varieties and concentrations of these acids can be useful indicators for monitoring H2 production. In this study, only butyric and acetic acids were generated during H2 production by C. butyricum for the three substrates analyzed (cellulose, glucose and SCB). Table 5 shows that butyric acid was predominant in all experimental series, for both cellulose and glucose assays. The acidogenic fermentative bacteria are capable of producing propionic acid, butyric acid and ethanol; however, acetic acid bacteria can degrade organic matter, which results in acetic acid, carbon dioxide or hydrogen and are thus directly related to methanogenic archaea [81]. The bacteria from SCB that were not eliminated after hydrothermal pretreatment followed by autoclaving may have contributed to the change in the final metabolites, since in that condition there was a predominance of acetic acid (Table 5). In a study of bioconversion of SCB into value-added products, the authors identified in the unpretreated SCB endospore producers such as Paenibacillus, Bacillus and Clostridium. [10] Thus, in the present study after the hydrothermal pretreatment of SCB it is probable that some endospore forming bacteria promoted the microbial growth, which was also observed by these authors. Higher concentrations of acetic acid were observed in condition A (25 μM Fe), with 1.18 g/L and 3.23 g/L for cellulose and glucose assays, respectively. Higher values of volatile organic acids in condition A also corresponded to assays with higher accumulated H2 production; i.e., 6.06 ± 0.2 mmol/L and 15.25 ± 0.63 mmol/L for cellulose and glucose assays, respectively. The highest values of butyric acid were also observed in condition A (25 μM Fe) for cellulose and glucose assays, which were 1.93 g/L and 5.56 g/L, respectively. Minor values were observed as a function of the metal composition in the following series (B-D), as shown in Table 5. The type of substrate used as carbon and energy source can change the production of metabolites; however, the accumulation of volatile organic acids may lead to a pH decrease and consequently, inhibition of hydrogen production [82]. Rabelo et al. [25] observed the same fact, a decrease in H2 production when the cellulose concentration in the medium was increased from 5 g/L to 10 g/L, interfering also in the production of volatile organic acids and solvents such as ethanol. Acetic acid (0.113 g/L) and butyric acid (0.108 g/L) were observed in similar amounts when cellulose hydrolyzates (1 g/L) were used as substrate for H2 production by C. butyricum. [83] Pattra et al. [82] also observed predominance of butyric acid in a study of H2 production from SCB hemicellulose hydrolyzate by Clostridium butyricum. [FeFe]-hydrogenases are associated with proton reduction, these enzymes may be related to higher H2 and volatile organic acids production, when compared to [NiFe]-hydrogenases that are related to H2 oxidation. Thus, the addition of 25 μM Fe in condition A may have provided greater enzymatic activity of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in both, glucose and cellulose conditions. Under conditions B and C, in which 1 μM Ni was added, the activity of [NiFe]-hydrogenases may have also occurred, thus reflecting the production and/or consumption of molecular hydrogen. In general, [FeFe]-hydrogenases are found in fermentative anaerobic bacteria, very prevalent in phylum Firmicutes, in which C. butyricum is a part of. In contrast, [NiFe]-hydrogenases are often found associated with cyanobacteria and archaea, in addition to their overall occurrence in large numbers of bacteria. Although both hydrogenases may play the same role in cell metabolism, they have different functions, especially when comparing microbial groups as Firmicutes and sulfate reducing bacteria (Proteobacteria phylum) in which both groups have the two types of hydrogenases [19,71,84]. Thus, the availability of micronutrients such as metals in the medium can direct the enzymatic activity of the microorganisms that are present in the system. Bacteria similar to Clostridium sp. produce, during the exponential growth phase, mainly acetic acid, butyric acid and H2, and in the stationary phase produce predominantly alcohol. The formation of volatile organic acids and alcohols causes lower H2 production yields, since much of the chemical energy is retained in these compounds [85]. In addition to H2 and volatile organic acids, ethanol was also detected in the present study, but at low concentrations and its contribution to total SMP (soluble microbial products) was around 5.58%, 3.63% and 3.07% for cellulose, glucose and SCB assays, respectively. Therefore, H2 production was a favorable occurrence in C. butyricum strain because production of solvents (e.g., ethanol) was relatively small [86,87]. Comparison between H2 production (Table 4) and soluble metabolites production (Table 5) shows that better H2 production was accompanied by higher total volatile fatty acid content (TVFA) and higher butyric acid production. This proposes that H2 production by C. butyricum was directed by acidogenic route and was fundamentally butyrate-type fermentation. Hydrogen production was also evaluated by C. butyricum using hydrolyzate SCB pretreated with H2SO4 and autoclave [82]. As observed in the present study, the authors verified that butyric acid was the main metabolite from the fermentation of SCB. The predominance of butyric and acetic acids was also observed in a study of H2 production by C. butyricum using enzymatically pretreated rice straw as substrate source [83]. From the metabolites observed during the reactors operation, it was evident that the substrate source (cellulose, glucose or SCB) influenced the metabolic flux response of C. butyricum, directing the metabolism and consequently the H2 production. Hydrogen production was evaluated in mesophilic condition in batch reactors from hydrothermally pretreated SCB by two microbial consortia, MC1 (Clostridium, Bacillus, Bacteroides and Paenibacillus) and MC2 (Clostridium, Raoultella, Klebsiella and Desulfovibrio) [11]. Acetic and butyric acids totaled more than 50% of the volatile organic acids (VOA) generated for both consortia employed. For MC1, acetic acid (0.845 g/L) was predominant, for MC2 the production was the same for both acids, 1.18 g/L each. In addition, it was concluded that the strain employed in the present study has the potential for efficient bioconversion of lignocellulosic residues such as SCB for the production of sustainable value-added products (such as H2, ethanol, butyric and acetic acids). These data may be useful to improve knowledge about the metabolism of C. butyricum, as well as to optimize the process of bioreactors operation to also apply it in high level continuous processes of lignocellulosic residues conversion in bio products of interest. The commercial production of organic acids is also preferably carried out by chemical processes. However, the use of non-renewable petrochemicals as raw materials and increase in the cost of petroleum have encouraged the rise in research in this area due to greater interest in the biological routes for the production of these compounds [88]. The use of wastewater and organic waste for organic acids production is a sustainable waste management alternative. The production of high value-added organic compounds, such as organic acids, may be more feasible than H2 production from organic residues or wastewater rich in carbohydrates [89]. Acetic acid, for example obtained from the fermentation of milk, was purified to be used as a defoaming salt. In addition, acetic acid has been described as a model substrate for microbial fuel cells [90]. In this study, acetic acid was detected at values above 0.7 g/L, for all substrates tested, one of the main organic compounds observed at the end of reactors operation. The highest H2 specific production was observed for assay A (25 μM Fe) for both substrates, cellulose and glucose, with 1.3 mmol H2/gTVS and 3.19 mmol H2/gTVS, respectively. Lower H2 yields also resulted from production of organic compounds, such as volatile organic acids and ethanol, since they are the end products of the metabolic pathways and are not related to H2 production during the fermentation or require H2 for their formation [89]. In the present study, higher ethanol concentrations were verified under the conditions of lower H2 yield, for both the cellulose (0.19 g/L), as well as the glucose (0.36 g/L) assays in series D (Table 5). In a study of H2 production employing an anaerobic completely stirred tank reactor (ACSTR) operated at 37 °C and dominated by Clostridium strains, ethanol production was also favorable at lower iron and nickel concentrations or in the absence of these metals [76]. The maximum H2 yield (0.53 mol H2/mol carbohydrate) for assay with 5 g/L of cellulose was observed in series A (25 μM Fe). In the other conditions (B - 25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni, C - 25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni + 1 μM and D - without the addition of metals), similar yields were observed, on average 0.38 mol H2/mol carbohydrate. Lower H2 yield (2.2 mmol H2/g cellulose) was observed when higher substrate concentration (12.5 g/L cellulose) was employed in a batch reactor operated in mesophilic condition with a boiled-pretreated microbial consortia [91]. In contrast, Rabelo et al. [11] observed 7.8 mmol H2/g cellulose and 2.25 mmol H2/g cellulose when using 5 g/L and 10 g/L cellulose, respectively. In both studies, microbial consortium was used as inoculum source. However, in the present study, higher value of H2 yield was observed than that observed in Lay [91]. Probably, in the latter case, the low yield was due to inhibition caused by the high substrate concentration, a fact also observed by Rabelo et al. [11]. In the assay with 5 g/L glucose, the maximum H2 yield obtained was 1.45 mol H2/mol carbohydrate in condition A (25 μM Fe). Karadag and Puhakka [76] evaluated the H2 yield in mesophilic condition by a fermentative consortium (predominance of C. butyricum) in the presence of Fe, Ni or Fe + Ni in the culture medium supplemented with 9 g/L glucose. The authors observed lower H2 yields compared to the present study, 0.66 and 0.76 mol H2.mol/glucose when 2.5 and 50.5 μM Fe was employed in the medium, respectively [76]. Probably, this aspect was due to the higher substrate concentration employed by the authors (9 g/L glucose), as well as the nature of the inoculum (C. butyricum, C. coagulans, C. chartatabidum, C. ramosum and Bacillus coagulans). The addition of Fe + Ni in the culture medium (condition B) did not favor a better H2 yield. On the contrary, there was a reduction of 20.7% and 18.9% in H2 yield in the glucose and cellulose conditions, respectively (Table 5). Karadag and Puhakka [76] observed the opposite, but the authors employed higher concentrations of Fe and Ni (50.3 μM and 42 μM, respectively) in addition to greater substrate concentration (9 g/L glucose). As expected, the assay employing 5 g/L SCB the H2 yield (0.33 mol H2/mol carbohydrate) was lower compared to the previous assays due to greater substrate complexity. Rabelo et al. [11] observed 1.06 mmol H2/g SCB when using a fermentative consortium (Clostridium, Bacillus, Bacteroides and Paenibacillus) and 5 g/L hydrothermally pretreated SCB in mesophilic condition in batch reactors. Soares et al. [12] evaluated the optimization of H2 production from hydrothermally pretreated SCB using response surface methodology. The authors tested incubation temperatures from 35.8 °C to 64.2 °C, Cellulose Anaerobe medium [28] and consortium from UASB reactor used in the treatment of vinasse. By using 35.8 °C, a condition closer to the present study, the authors observed 1.75 mmol H2/g SCB. The presence of archaeas in the inoculum used by Soares et al. [12] (evidenced by PCR/DGGE) may have contributed to this lower yield. Higher H2 yield was observed in a study of H2 production from 2 g/L hydrothermal pretreated SCB (1.09 mol H2/mol carbohydrate). It is worth mentioning that the authors used microbial consortium obtained from the thermophilic sludge from an upﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) used for vinasse treatment as a source of inoculum. A more complex inoculum associated with higher temperature condition employed by these authors may have contributed to higher H2 yield [12]. In fact, the different culture medium conditions imposed on the H2 production experiments influenced the H2 yield obtained. It should be noted that even at more complex metals addition, better results were observed when only 25 μm Fe was added to the culture media. Furthermore, VOA results indicate that the addition of metals did not disturb the metabolic pathway in both glucose and cellulose assays, since butyric acid was always predominant. In contrast, this metabolic pathway changed during SCB fermentation, a more complex substrate and which, probably, also used as an inoculum source. Among the culture media tested in the present study, the cellulose anaerobe medium was the one that most provided energy production in the studied reactors. Through this culture medium using C. butyricum strain, the conversion of H2 produced into energy was 0.18 KWh, as opposed to 0.11 KWh and 0.08 KWh for Jiang and PCS media, respectively. When energy analysis was applied to the media containing metals and different carbon sources; cellulose, glucose and sugarcane bagasse (SCB), it can be seen that the implementation of Fe (A) in the medium caused an increase in the production and energy conversion, generating 0.21 KWh and 0.54 KWh for the reactors fed with cellulose and glucose, respectively. For reactors containing cellulose as substrate, the other metal supplementations, Ni (B) and Se (C), did not significantly interfere in the energy production, obtaining 0.17 kwh, 0.15 KWh, respectively and low interference of Ni and Se was verified compared with the experimental series without the addition of metals (D), in which it produced 0.14 KWh. However, when glucose was used as substrate, these values were higher than those compared with cellulose, but both Ni (B) and Se (C) did not increase energy production when compared to the condition with Fe (A). The energy production values for the media containing glucose added with Ni, Se and Control without metals were 0.39 KWh, 0.37 KWh and 0.32 KWh. When the reactors were fed with pretreated-SCB, the energy production was 0.14 KWh, much lower when compared to glucose and cellulose. An analysis of variance (ANOVA), confirmed by Tukey test, was performed among all conditions studied. Thus, no significant difference was observed in the assay with the culture media (cellulose anaerobe, Jiang and PCS), nor in the assays with cellulose and glucose (P < 0.05). However, a significant difference was obtained when comparing the glucose and SCB conditions. Note that the complexity of the substrate used influences energy production."
11,Conclusions,"Clostridium butyricum CCT 7470 was employed to degrade pretreated-SCB in hydrogen and volatile organic acids (VOA), since the anaerobic conversion of SCB to hydrogen is an attractive alternative to renewable energy. The effect of the presence of metal on the hydrogen production was investigated. In the present study, the optimal culture medium condition for H2 production from cellulose by C. butyricum was Cellulose Anaerobe media, the most complex in terms of nutritional composition. Hydrogen production was favored in the presence of 25 μM Fe (condition A), around 16 mmol/L and 6 mmol/L for glucose and cellulose assays and 3.9 mmol/L for SCB. This condition was also the most favorable for the production of VOA as well as ethanol. Butyric acid was predominant in cellulose and glucose assays. The presence of bacteria from SCB that were not eliminated after hydrothermal pretreatment and followed by autoclaving may have contributed to the change in the final metabolites, since in that condition there was a predominance of acetic acid. When no metal was added to the culture medium, the production of hydrogen and VOA dropped to almost half. Higher concentrations of acetic acid were observed in condition A (25 μM Fe) for both substrates (glucose and cellulose), the same trend was observed for SCB assay. Higher ethanol concentrations were verified under the conditions of lower hydrogen yield for cellulose and the glucose assays in series with no metal addition. The hydrogen production stabilization was correlated with the end of cell growth in all studied conditions. Considering that SCB is a low cost and widely available, the use of C. butyricum on SCB might be practical and economically attractive for industrial scale biofuels production. This study may improve knowledge about the metabolism of C. butyricum, as well as about the optimization of biological processes to apply it in higher-level systems of lignocellulosic residues conversion in value-added byproducts. This also represents a contribution for future studies, providing a promising understanding into the anaerobic treatment of SCB (hydrothermal-pretreated), which may provide the large scale bioproduction of hydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass."
