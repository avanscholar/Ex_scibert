0,Introduction,"Many global industrial as well as municipal sectors are heavily dependent on the continuous supply of cheap energy. Fossil fuels have been utilized to meet this demand; however, depleting supplies, rising carbon dioxide levels and energy security are major factors driving the search for alternative energy sources [1]. Alternative renewable energy sources in-use and under development includes solar, wind, tidal and biomass. Currently, many studies are focused on developing processes which can utilize agricultural crops and residues to produce biofuels [2]. Cheap renewable feedstocks coupled with economical processes could lead to cheaper supplies of bio-diesel, bio-ethanol and bio-hydrogen (bio-H2). Among the different biofuels, bio-H2 is emerging as a promising energy carrier because the reaction byproducts are non-polluting. In addition, with an energy content of 122 kJ g−1 and a higher heating value (142 kJ g−1) when compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, bio-H2 is a promising energy alternative [3,4]. Hydrogen can be produced using thermal, photocatalytic and biological processes. These processes include large-scale thermo catalytic steam reforming, photochemical, thermal and water biophotolysis [5]. Photo-bioprocesses as well as dark fermentation routes under development have utilized lignocellulosic feedstocks [6,7]. Among the biological methods, dark fermentation is the most preferred route because of its high net energy utilization [8] and when compared to pure culture, it can use a variety of non-sterile feedstocks. However, using mixed cultures suffers from a severe limitation caused by the presence of H2 consumers and H2 producers. Hydrogen is utilized by anaerobic chemolithotrophic bacteria such as methanogens, sulfate reducers and homoacetogens [9,10]. Hence, the successful production of H2 via dark fermentation depends on the selective inhibition of H2 consuming bacteria. Controlling the growth of H2 consumers can be accomplished by several methods. Strategies employed to selectively enrich spore forming H2 producing bacteria such as Clostridia sp. include inocula pretreatment using acid [11–13], alkali [14], heat [15,16], loading shock [11], 2-bromoethane sulfonate (BES) [17] and long chain fatty acids such as linoleic acid (LA) [18]. Methanogenic archea are mainly inhibited by inoculum pre-treatment [19,20]. However, under conditions favoring methanogenic suppression, H2 oxidation is able to proceed via homoacetogenesis [21]. Dark fermentation studies have shown that batch studies with a heat treated inoculum, the gas phase H2 reached intermediate concentrations of 57–72% (head space concentration) from glucose fermentation [22] and after 80 h, the H2 level was undetectable with acetic acid (HAc) levels increasing after 30 h. The increasing (HAc) levels and decreasing levels of H2 reported by Oh et al. [22] was likely due to homoacetogens. The data in Table 1 show the impact of inoculum pre-treatment and the effect of homoacetogenesis. Hydrogen production from single batch pre-treatment of an inoculum have been reported in many studies [14,18,20,22]. Over the long-term, the impact of pretreatment on an inoculum may differ between single batch cultivations because of variable populations in mixed cultures derived from different sources. A proper understanding of the activity of the homoacetogens under conditions mediating methanogenic suppression is crucial and this data could provide insights for developing a H2 producing inoculum which could be utilized in larger-scale continuous H2 production. The objectives of this work were to investigate the long term effect of different stress treatments (acid, alkali, heat, BES, LA and loading shock) on H2 production and to assess changes in the microbial community composition under both mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) conditions."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and inoculum source,"2.1 Chemicals and inoculum source Experiments were conducted using a mixed anaerobic inoculum from a brewery wastewater treatment facility (Guelph, ON, Canada). The culture was stored at 4 °C before experimentation. The inoculum had a volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of approximately 40 g L−1. Two mother reactors were maintained at 37 °C (Reactor A) and 55 °C (Reactor B) with a VSS concentration of 10 g L−1. The reactors were fed glucose (5 g L−1) every 7 days and the gas production was monitored at regular intervals. Before the pretreatment was administered, the VSS concentration of the inoculum was adjusted to 2 g L−1. The volume of gas produced in Reactors A and B was monitored using a tipping bucket gas meter [23]. Heat shock (H) (Moist heat at 100 °C for 30 min), acid (A) (Adjust pH to 3.0 using 3 N HCl for 24 h), alkali (K) (Adjust the pH to 12.0 using 3 M KOH for 24 h), 2-bromoethane sulfonate (BES) (99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, ON) (50 mM 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid for 24 h), linoleic acid (C18:2 (LA) (99% purity, TCI America, OR) (2.0 g L−1 for 24 h) and loading shock (LS) (20.0 g L−1 glucose 24 h) were used to pre-treat the inoculum."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures Long-term studies assessing the impact of different stressing agents on H2 production was performed using 160 mL batch reactors. Pre-treated inoculum was added to the batch reactors together with glucose and basal media to attain a final working volume of 75 mL. All experimental runs were conducted in triplicate. Culture preparation methods were adapted from Pendyala et al. [18]. Untreated (control) cultures were used as positive controls. The initial pH was adjusted to 5.5 using 3 N HCl/3 M KOH before initiating the experiments. Anaerobic basal media was prepared according to Wiegant and Lettinga [24]. Glucose (5 g L−1) was added to the mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) cultures 24 h after applying the pretreatment condition. The batch reactors (160 mL) containing 2000 mg L−1 VSS of culture were placed in an shaker incubators (Innova 2100, New Brunswick Scientific, NJ) operating at 200 rpm at 37 °C and 55 °C. At the end of the reaction time after the 1st glucose addition, the pH of cultures in the batch reactor was measured and adjusted to 5.5 ± 0.1. The VSS concentration at the end each glucose feeding (at day 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25) was measured using an optical density (OD) versus VSS concentration curve (data not shown). Before initiating the second and subsequent glucose feedings, the microbial culture was washed to remove residual VFAs produced from a previous glucose addition. The culture-washing procedure was conducted as follows: 1. Depressurize the batch reactors in an anaerobic glove box (COY Laboratory Products Inc., Grass Lake, MI) by inserting a needle into the rubber septa. 2. Opened the batch reactors and transfer the contents from each triplicate set into 300 mL glass beakers. 3. Gravity settle the solids and decant the supernatant and add fresh basal medium to a final volume of 40 mL. 4. Transfer the culture plus basal medium mixture into a 50 mL centrifuge tube configured with a screw cap. 5. Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc, USA) the mixture at 3000 rpm for 10 min and decant the liquid. 6. Resuspend the pellet in fresh basal medium after centrifuging and determine the pH and VSS concentration after repeated washing, centrifugation and resuspension. Control cultures fed repeatedly with glucose were labeled as C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5. The pretreated cultures were fed glucose and washed in the same manner as the controls after pretreatment with various stressing agents. The byproducts (both gas and liquid metabolite) concentration and pH were determined at the end of the experiments."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Head space gas analysis (H2, CH4 and CO2) (Praxair, ON; >99% purity) and liquid metabolite analysis (volatile fatty acids (VFA's), alcohols and glucose) were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to methods described by Chowdhury et al. [25] and Moon et al. [26]. The detection limit for lactic acid (HLa) (Lancaster Synthesis Inc., NH), formic acid (HFr) (MP Biomedicals, OH), HAc (MP Biomedicals, OH), propionic acid (HPr) (J.T. Baker, ON) and butyric acid (HBu) (Lancaster Synthesis Inc., NH) was 0.5 mg L−1 for a sample injection volume of 10 μL while the limits for glucose (Sigma Aldrich, ON) and alcohols were 1.0 and 5.0 mg L−1 respectively for a sample injection volume of 25 μL. All chemicals were 99% pure. The detection limits for H2 and CH4 were 0.0032 kPa [5 μL bottle−1 (160 mL)] and 0.0064 kPa [5 μL bottle−1 (160 mL)], respectively."
5,Enzyme assay,"2.4 Enzyme assay Hydrogenase uptake (Uu) and evolution (Ue) specific activities of the pretreated cultures and controls (subjected to 5 glucose additions) were performed using methods described by Pendyala et al. [18]. The enzyme activities were expressed in U mg VSS−1. One unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μL H2 evolved or consumed per hour. Note 1 μL = 0.04 μmol (25 °C, 1 atm)."
6,Flux balance analysis,2.5 Flux balance analysis A flux balance analysis (FBA) was used to examine the electron flux diverted to various byproducts. The FBA was performed based on the model described by Chaganti et al. [27]. Metabolites from the 1st and 5th glucose feeding to the cultures incubated at both 37 °C and 55 °C were used to conduct the FBA. A 30 × 30 matrix consisting of 30 linear equations in metabolic networks were solved using MetaFluxNet (Version 1.8.6.2). A detailed explanation of the model development and the list of metabolic reactions was reported by Chaganti et al. [27]. The list of reactions is shown in Appendix Table A1.
7,Microbial community analysis,"2.6 Microbial community analysis The microbial community diversity of the mixed culture subjected to different pretreatment conditions was determined using the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 16S rRNA gene followed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. The culture composition after five glucose additions was analyzed for the different microbial community populations. Methods for DNA isolation, PCR amplification and T-RFLP analysis were in accordance with procedure described by Chaganti et al. [28]. T-RFs that differed by ±1 bp in different profiles were considered as identical and fragments smaller than 50 bp were excluded from the analysis."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis A principal component analysis (PCA) on the data was performed using the PAST software version 3.05 [29]. The software was use to assess the long term effect of different stress treatments (H, A, K, LS, BES and LA) on the microbial diversity included the controls (C). The quantities of (HAc, HPr, HBu, EtOH, H2 and CH4) produced after the 1st and 5th glucose addition were used as an input for the PCA analysis. Statistical differences between multiple means of the different stress treatments was evaluated using the Tukey's paired comparison procedure at 95% confidence level [30]. The T-RFs profile (band intensity) obtained for long term stress treated culture was used in a non-parametric multivariate cluster analysis (MCA). The MCA was performed using the PAST software. The Kulczynski similarity index was depicted using a dendrogram."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Repeated glucose feedings,"3.1 Repeated glucose feedings The experimental design matrix for this study is shown in Table 2 . After pretreating the cultures, 5 successive glucose feedings over 25 days was used to increase the H2 producing populations. Repeated glucose feeds were used to increase the H2 yield by enriching the H2 producing population [31]. The nomenclature used to designate the control and pretreated cultures over the different glucose feeding period were based on the acronyms for the various pretreatment methods (C, H, A, K, LA and LS) and the number of glucose (1–5) additions (Table 2). Similar methodology of repeated batch cultivation has been described in previous reports [11,32–36]."
11,Hydrogen and methane production,"3.2 Hydrogen and methane production Under mesophilic (37 °C) conditions, pretreatments with stressing agents showed an average H2 yield of 1.89 ± 0.19 mol.mol−1glucose after repeatedly adding glucose on 5 occasions (Fig. 1 a). In comparison, control (untreated) cultures exhibited lower H2 yields cycles under the same number of feeding cycles (C5). During the C5 cycle, control cultures showed an initial H2 yield of 1.35 ± 0.27 mol mol−1 glucose 24 h after adding glucose (data not shown). However, the H2 produced during the first 24 h was depleted immediately. This loss in H2 yield in C5 cultures might be due to the activity of H2 consumers, such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens. After 48 h, the H2 levels in the untreated control cultures were undetectable. In comparison, in the pretreated cultures, the similar H2 yields observed were significantly greater when compared to the control cultures. For the pretreated cultures at 37 °C and fed glucose during the 5th feeding cycle, no significant difference in H2 yields was observed (Appendix Table A2). However, statistical differences in the H2 yields were observed in cultures (controls and those pretreated) fed glucose during the 1st feeding cycle and incubated at 37 °C (Appendix Table A2). Except for the LS treatment, negligible methane (CH4) (≤0.04 ± 0.01 mol mol−1 glucose) was observed in the remaining pre-treated cultures under all five glucose feeding cycles at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures (Appendix Fig. B1). These results indicate that pre-treatment was effective in selectively enriching spore-forming H2 producers at mesophilic temperatures and inhibiting methanogens over longer time periods. The average H2 yields obtained from cultures pretreated with different stressors and incubated at thermophilic temperatures (55 °C) were lower than those obtained from mesophilic cultures (Fig. 1b). Lower yields at the elevated temperature condition could be associated with increased homoacetogenic growth. The H2 yields observed after the 5th glucose feeding cycle for controls and pre-treated cultures were statistically the same (Tukey's test, α = 0.05; Appendix Table A2). The maximum H2 yield observed after the 1st glucose cycle under thermophilic conditions was 2.58 ± 0.1 mol mol−1 glucose (Fig. 1b) in the LA pre-treated culture. Methane production of 0.58 ± 0.14 mol mol−1 glucose was detected after the 1st glucose feed in control cultures at 55 °C (Appendix Fig. B1b). Over successive glucose feeds, the H2 yields decreased below the levels observed after the 1st feeding cycle. In addition, no CH4 was detected in the untreated thermophilic control cultures after the 1st glucose feeding cycle. These observations indicate that the pre-treatment methods administered were not effective at thermophilic temperatures by repeated batch cultivations. The results are consistent with work reported by Valdez-Vazquez and Poggi-Varaldo [37]. They reported higher H2 levels for cultures pretreated with heat shock and incubated at 37 °C compared to those at 55 °C. In general, the maximum H2 yields obtained over the course of this study are comparable to the yields reported previously by other researchers (Table 3 ). The lower H2 yields observed in pre-treated cultures maintained 55 °C (Fig. 1b) shows that temperature is a major factor affecting H2 production. According to Gibbs [38], heat shock pretreatment is able to selectively enrich spore-forming Clostridium sp. while temperature is a major factor affecting the growth rate of Clostridium sp. [39]. Several spore-forming H2-producing bacteria require exposure to a stressing agent such as heat to initiate spore activation [38]. Similarly, other types of stressors might also require incubation at the appropriate temperature to initiate enrichment of spore-forming H2-producers. In general, the germination patterns for different H2 producing bacterial species depends upon the germination [40]. The impact of temperature, pH and stress conditions on the activity of homoacetogens is unclear based on data reported in several studies. In this study, increasing homoacetogenesis was observed with increasing temperature. According to Luo et al. [11], lower homoacetogenic activity was detected with decreasing temperature in bioreactors. Homoacetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea can consume H2 over a temperature range of 1–35 °C; however, their optimum temperature range is higher and between 20 and 30 °C [41–44]. Homoacetogenic Acetobacterium bakii, Acetobacterium tundrae and a methanogenic strain designated as MSB have been reported to show a large temperature range from 4 to 30 °C for optimal H2 consumption [42]. At less than 20 °C, homoacetogens have been reported to actively participate in H2 utilization in paddy soil and lake sediments [45,46]. However, at less than 20 °C, the activity of H2 utilizing methanogens was low [47]."
12,Liquid metabolite analysis,"3.3 Liquid metabolite analysis Different metabolic profiles were observed for liquid metabolites produced by cultures at 37 °C and 55 °C (Fig. 2 ). After 5 feeding additions, no HLa was detected in cultures incubated at 37 °C, whereas greater than 15% of the electrons derived from glucose were diverted towards HLa production in all the pre-treated cultures, except for the untreated control (C) culture (5 feeding additions at 55 °C). A noticeable difference was observed for the percent electron flow towards the reduced by-products after 5 glucose feeding additions at 37 °C compared to the 1st glucose feeding at 37 °C. In untreated control cultures, 32.4 ± 3.2% of the initial substrate electrons was diverted towards CH4 production during 1st glucose addition at 37 °C. However, after 5 glucose additions, the percent substrate electrons diverted towards CH4 formation decreased to 19.2 ± 0.3%. In comparison, HAc production increased from 15.3 ± 0.3% (C1) to 20.5 ± 0.2% (C5) in the control cultures. This increase in HAc production is likely due to the presence of homoacetogens. Greater than 40% of the electrons were diverted towards HAc and HBu production in cultures maintained at 37 °C. Higher HPr levels were detected (34.4 ± 0.7% of electrons from glucose were diverted to HPr) in control (C5) cultures incubated at 55 °C. Ethanol (EtOH) was observed under all experimental conditions in cultures incubated at 37 °C and fed glucose only once. In contrast, EtOH production was observed only in the untreated control (C5) and the LS-treated cultures (LS5) at 37 °C (Fig. 2). iso-Propanol (iso-PrOH) was the major solvent produced in the stress treated cultures at both 37 °C and 55 °C (except H5, K5, BES5, LA5 cultures incubated at 55 °C); however, it was not detected in the control (C1) cultures at 55 °C."
13,Principal component analysis,"3.4 Principal component analysis The PCA bi-plots were constructed using the metabolites (both gas and liquid) levels as input. The metabolite levels determined after 1st glucose feed cycle and after 5 glucose additions were considered in the analysis. The PCA bi-plots derived using metabolite data for the two glucose feeding conditions and cultures at 37 °C and 55 °C are shown in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. The PCA constructed using metabolite data gathered from 37 °C indicated that PC 1 accounted for 44% of the total variation in the data set while PC 2 accounted for 20% of the total variation. In comparison, both PC 1 and PC 2 accounted for only 47% variation in cultures at 55 °C. Cultures repeatedly fed with glucose on 5 occasions are grouped in a separate quadrant away from the cultures receiving 1 glucose feed addition irrespective of the fermentation temperature (Fig. 3). The stress treated cultures grouped away from the control cultures indicate differences in the metabolite pattern and the H2 yield. Similar grouping of the control cultures away from the stress treated cultures were observed in cultures incubated at 55 °C (Fig. 3b). The loading values for the mesophilic cultures, HLa (0.11), HAc (0.39), HBu (0.27), HFr (0.08), iso-PrOH (0.29) and H2 (0.46) correlate positively with PC 1 while HLa (0.44), HBu (0.44), CH4 (0.03), Undegraded glucose (Rem Glu) (0.18) and EtOH (0.59) correlated positively with PC 2 (Fig. 3a). Similar results with grouping of control cultures away from the stress treated cultures were reported by Pendyala et al. [18]. The loading values pattern for cultures at 55 °C are different from mesophilic cultures with HBu (0.36), H2 (0.49), Rem Glu (0.34), EtOH (0.24) and iso-PrOH (0.35) correlated positively with PC 1 while HPr (0.56), HBu (0.32), CH4 (0.29), iso-PrOH (0.33) correlated positively with PC 2 (Fig. 3b). These differences in the loading values in the PCA biplots clearly indicate that the fermentation pattern were not the same at the different incubation temperatures. This is evident from clustering of the microbial cultures subjected to different pretreatments with stressors."
14,Quantification of H2 fluxes using FBA,"3.5 Quantification of H2 fluxes using FBA A flux balance analysis (FBA) was conducted to predict the internal fluxes based on the assessment of the external fluxes. Metabolite (both gas and liquid) levels after the 1st and 5th feeding cycles were used as the inputs for the FBA. The model predicted H2 yield (hydrogenase activity) was based on the following reaction flux: 2Fd+ + 2H+ → 2 Fd2+ + H2 (R12) (Fig. 4 ). The reactions used in developing the FBA are provided in Appendix Table A1. The experimental H2 yield was compared with the model predicted H2 yield so as to assess the H2 consumption activity. The experimental H2 yield was less than the model predicted H2 yield under all experimental conditions (Fig. 4). Based on the reaction provided in Appendix Table A1, this loss in H2 yield could be attributed to the formation of HAc, valeric acid (HVa); caproic acid (HCa), iso-PrOH (R21 flux) and CH4 (Appendix Table A1). Both HVa and HCa were not detected under the experimental conditions. In addition, CH4 was not detected in the stress treated cultures (except LS1 cultures incubated at 55 °C which showed 0.04 ± 0.01 mol mol−1 glucose (Appendix Fig. B1b)). Hence, the H2 loss is likely due to the formation of HAc and PrOH. The output from the flux balance analysis indicated that the untreated control cultures exhibited both aceticlastic methanogenic activity (data not shown) and homoacetogenic activity for cultures at 37 °C (Fig. 4). The aceticlastic methanogenic activity suggests CH4 formation proceeded via HAc utilization. Homoacetogenic activity indicates HAc formation was attributed to H2 plus CO 2 / HCO 3 − . No hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity was detected in control cultures (both C1 and C5) at 37 °C and 55 °C (data not shown). Homoacetogenic activity was observed in all pre-treated cultures fed glucose on 1 occasion and at 37 °C (Fig. 4a). However, the loss of homoacetogenic activity in both LA and LS pretreated cultures (37 °C) after 5 glucose additions indicated that a combination of lower final fermentation pH and successive glucose additions to the pre-treated cultures could suppress this activity (Fig. 4b). The decrease in experimental H2 yield in cultures maintained at 37 °C, treated with LA and LS and fed glucose on 5 occasions is due to iso-PrOH formation (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, all the stress treated cultures at 55 °C had negligible homoacetogenic activity after the 1st glucose feeding addition (Fig. 4c). However, except in acid and LS treated cultures, this activity was detected in stress treated cultures (Fig. 4d) after 5 glucose additions. No homoacetogenic activity was observed in the control, acid and LS treated cultures at 55 °C and subjected to 5 glucose feedings; however, an iso-PrOH production was observed (Fig. 4d)."
15,Hydrogenase activity,"3.6 Hydrogenase activity Hydrogenase evolution (Ue) and uptake (Uu) specific activities of long term stress treated cultures (cultures subjected to 5 glucose feeding cycles) are shown in Fig. 5 . The hydrogenase specific activity results are comparable with data reported by Pendyala et al. [18] for flocculated mixed anaerobic cultures maintained at 37 ± 1 °C. Except for the alkali treated cultures, the evolution hydrogenase activity (EHA) for long-term pre-treated cultures fed glucose repeatedly on 5 occasions had lower activities at thermophilic temperature compared to the cultures incubated at mesophilic temperatures (Fig. 5a). Alkali pre-treated cultures; however, showed an EHA increase (approximately 120%) at 55 °C when compared to 37 °C. The alkali pre-treated cultures exhibited the highest level of EHA of 96 ± 1 μL H2 evolved mg−1 VSS h−1 (Fig. 5a). Decreasing EHA activity at 55 °C was detected in all the pretreated cultures including the untreated control cultures. Control (C5) cultures incubated at thermophilic temperatures showed a 48% relative decrease in EHA when compared to the control cultures at 37 °C. A possible reason for a reduction in the EHA at 55 °C is likely due to the formation of increasing levels of un-ionized VFAs during fermentation at a pH below 4.0 (data not shown). The hydrogenase activity of whole cells obtained from acid-producing cultures (pH 5.8) was greater than a factor of 2.2 when compared to solvent-producing cultures maintained at pH 4.5 [48,49]. Furthermore, solvent-producing cultures exhibited hydrogenase activity only after a lag in the growth phase of approximately 10–15 min. However, a study conducted by Kim and Zeikus [49] to examine the influence of pH and VFA concentration on in-vivo hydrogenase activity revealed that neither of these factors affected hydrogenase activity. These researchers concluded that the decreasing H2 production observed at low pH values was due to the regulation of the hydrogenase enzyme activation rather than to its inhibition. The uptake hydrogenase activity (UHA) was measured in order to better understand the activities of major H2 consumers (methanogens and homoacetogens) over repeated batch cultivations. Higher UHAs were observed in the untreated control cultures when compared to the pre-treated cultures incubated at either mesophilic or thermophilic temperatures (Fig. 5b). Among the pre-treated cultures incubated at 37 °C, both LA and LS showed lower Uu activity (Fig. 5b). Cultures pre-treated with K, BES, LA and LS, and maintained at thermophilic temperatures had lower UHA values when compared to mesophilic cultures. Higher UHAs in mesophilic cultures when compared to thermophilic cultures correlated with increasing H2 consuming electron fluxes by mesophilic cultures relative to the thermophilic cultures (Fig. 4)."
16,Microbial analysis,"3.7 Microbial analysis 3.7.1 Cluster analysis Cultures repeatedly fed glucose on 5 occasions were selected to study the variation in microbial populations fed glucose and incubated at either mesophilic or thermophilic temperatures. A Kulczynski similarity index was used to construct a cluster tree (dendrogram) in order to quantify the relationships based on the 16S rRNA gene-based T-RFs variation of the microbial cultures subjected to different stress treatments. A Cophenetic correlation coefficient is used to measure the distortion due to the cluster analysis. The Kulczynski similarity measure for the Hae III enzyme digested T-RFs showed a Cophenetic correlation score >0.75 (Fig. 6 ). This indicates a good statistical agreement between the clusters in dendrogram and the similarity matrix. A Cophenetic correlation value close to 1 suggests accurate clustering representation of the data. Based on the conditions examined, two major clusters (clades) were observed in the dendrogram. Mesophilic cultures pre-treated with LA, BES, LS and H together with untreated control was clustered in clade I (Fig. 6a). The similarity index indicated the conditions in clade I were 25–65% similar while a similarity of 46% was observed for clade II. Although control culture was grouped in clade I, it shared 25% T-RFs similarity with the stress treated cultures. Note control culture showed negligible H2 production and higher CH4 production (Fig. 1a and Appendix Fig. B1a). Cultures pre-treated with chemical stressors such as BES and LA share 65% similarity indicating that these agents enrich specific type of microbial communities compared to other type of physical treatments. Cultures incubated at thermophilic temperature also showed two distinct clades (Fig. 6b). The K and LS treated cultures in clade I shared approximately 23% similarity with both LA and H treated cultures. The untreated control culture clustered in clade II showed approximately 51% similarity with A-treated culture. Note similar H2 yields were observed for cultures clustered in clade II (Fig. 1b). 3.7.2 Diversity analysis A microbial community analysis, performed using T-RFLP, revealed the presence of Moorella thermoacetica (accounting for 14% of the total bacterial population), Methanosarcina mazei and Methanosaeta thermophila in mesophilic control cultures subjected to 5 glucose feedings. M. thermoacetica is a homoacetogenic bacterium [50] capable of proton reduction, whereas M. mazei and M. thermophila are aceticlastic methanogens capable of producing CH4 from HAc [51,52]. Supporting data from the FBA revealed that the control cultures (37 °C) showed detectable homoacetogenic activity (Fig. 4b). Analysis of the archaeal community structure of control cultures incubated at both temperatures and fed glucose 5 times did not detect the presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens under all of the experimental conditions. The FBA analysis using the metabolite data also found no evidence of hydrogenotrophic methanogen activity (data not shown). A microbial analysis of thermophilic cultures repeatedly fed with glucose showed abundant levels HLa (Fig. 2d) due to the presence of organisms such as Lactobacillus ruminis and Lactobacillus salivarius. These species were particularly abundant in control (27%), BES- (26%), LA- (25%) and LS- (74%) treated cultures. In comparison, Lactobacillus sp. was not detected in mesophilic cultures, which also showed no evidence of HLa production (Fig. 2). Lactic acid producing bacteria such as Lactobacillus sp. excreting bacteriocins can adversely affect H2 producing bacteria thereby decreasing the H2 yield [53]. This could be the reason for the lower H2 yields observed in thermophilic cultures repeatedly fed glucose on 5 occasions (Fig. 1b). Higher levels of Clostridium sp. were detected in mesophilic cultures treated with various stressors and fed repeatedly with glucose (5 feedings) when compared to the thermophilic cultures. Note the variation in Clostridium sp. was a function of the pretreatment method. Clostridium sporogenes (60%) and Clostridium bifermentans (10.3%) were abundant in cultures with K pre-treatment and repeatedly fed with glucose under mesophilic conditions while in A-treated cultures, Clostridium acidiuric (30%), Clostridium beijerinckii (11%), Clostridium argentinense (9%) and C. bifermentans (11.5%) were abundant. In the mesophilic LA-treated cultures, C. sporogenes (>95% relative abundance) was detected after 5 repeated glucose feedings. Microorganisms related to Eubacterium sp. were abundant in cultures treated with BES- (13.6%) and LS- (16%) treatment. These observations are consistent with work reported in by Zindel et al. [54] and Freier et al. [55]. In cultures repeatedly fed glucose at 55 °C, Flavobacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Thermoanaerobacter sp., Bacteroides sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., together with a low abundance of Clostridium sp. such as Clostridium septicum, Clostridium carnis and Clostridium botulinum were detected in controls and stress-treated cultures. The results demonstrate that H2 production by cultures produced from different stress treatments at 37 °C and 55 °C and fed with glucose under successive batch cultivations resulted in different microbial communities. Microorganisms such as Bacillus sp., Thermoanaerobacter sp. are often associated with H2 producing Clostridium sp. [56]. Organisms related to Bacteroides sp. and Propionibacterium acnes were detected in the controls as well as the acid and LA treated cultures. According to Song et al. [57], the dominant populations in a pre-treated H2 producing cow manure compost included Bacteroides sp., Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter sp. Similar microbial populations were also observed by O-Thong [17] using different stress treated cultures (A, K, LS, BES and H) at 60 °C. Thioalkalivibrio sp. was a dominant population (87%) in the K-treated thermophilic cultures whereas M. thermoacetica was dominant (50%) in the BES-treated thermophilic cultures. Work by Wang et al. [58] has confirmed homoacetogenic bacteria are effective H2 scavengers under suppressed methanogenic conditions. The presence of M. thermoacetica in the BES-treated cultures supports the detection of the homoacetogenic flux shown in FBA (Fig. 3d). The lower relative abundance of Clostridium sp. coupled with the presence of Lactobacillus sp. could account for the lower H2 yields observed at 55 °C. Many studies have claimed the effectiveness of heat, acid and alkali on increasing the H2 yield [19,59]. However, the efficacy of culture pretreatment on H2 yields over the long-term operation of H2 producing cultures is not clearly documented in the literature. A sustainable H2 producing mixed culture utilizing non-sterilized feedstocks must utilize a stressing agent or a combination of stressing agents to permanently inactivate H2 consumers. Although several methods have been used to inactive H2 consumers, a suitable mixed culture pretreatment technology has not been fully developed. Temporarily applying stresses such as heating, adding acid and adding alkali have been effective in suppressing H2 consumers and achieving high H2 yields; however, most of the reported data are based on short-term studies [19,22]. Heating and utilizing BES are impractical from an economical point-of-view in full-scale operations. In case of using BES, discharging effluents containing this chemical could damage natural habitats. In comparison, adding LCFAs was effective in continually suppress H2 consuming activity because they degrade slowly into shorter chain inhibitory byproducts."
17,Conclusions,"The H2 yield was variable and dependent on the pretreatment method. In general, pretreated cultures produced higher amount of H2 in comparison with the controls. 1. When compared to cultures at 55 °C, higher H2 yields (1.89 ± 0.19 mol mol−1 glucose) were observed in cultures at 37 °C and fed repeatedly with glucose. The low H2 yield observed for the thermophilic cultures is likely due to the large amounts of HLa produced during repeated glucose feedings 2. Methane production was only observed in control cultures at 37 °C and fed repeatedly glucose over 5 cycles. No CH4 was detected in cultures at 55 °C. The effect of lower fermentation pH (below 4.0) in combination with higher incubation temperatures (55 °C) likely inhibited methanogenic activity in control cultures receiving repeated glucose additions. 3. Lower EHA activity observed in cultures at 55 °C (except alkali treated cultures) compared to cultures at 37 °C might be associated with low pH conditions. For both mesophilic and thermophilic cultures, the UHA of the untreated control cultures exhibited higher levels of activity than the pretreated cultures. 4. The FBA showed no detectable hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity in cultures receiving repeated glucose feeds. Homoacetogenic activity accounted for more than 98% loss in the H2 yield in untreated mesophilic control cultures and no detectable homoacetogenic activity was observed in both LA and LS treated mesophilic cultures. 5. The PCA bi-plot of the fermentation metabolites showed a cluster of pre-treated cultures away from the control cultures irrespective of the incubation temperature. This indicates that stress treated cultures followed different fermentation pattern compared to the control cultures. 6. An analysis of 16S rRNA gene based T-RFs showed the presence of both homoacetogens (M. thermoacetica) and aceticlastic methanogens (M. mazei and M. thermophila) in the control cultures. In comparison, thermophilic cultures were dominated by Lactobacillus sp. such as L. ruminis and L. salivarius. 7. In general, all the pre-treatments resulted in selective enrichment of Clostridium sp. in cultures at 37 °C. Microorganisms related to Eubacterium sp. were abundant in both BES and LS pre-treated cultures. Although Clostridium sp. was detected in pre-treated thermophilic cultures, the dominant microorganisms were Flavobacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Thermoanaerobacter sp., Bacteroides sp. and Thioalkalivibrio sp."
