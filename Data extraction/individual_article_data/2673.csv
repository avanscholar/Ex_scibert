0,Introduction,"Using the abundant methane as a building block to produce chemical commodities has aroused intense interest from both academic and industrial communities under the context of increasing energy demands and limited petroleum reserves [1–3]. In the process of methane functionalization, methanol is one of the most versatile platform molecules, which is not only a transportable fuel, but also a flexible feedstock to manufacture most bulk chemicals, olefins, aromatics as well as saturated hydrocarbons via C‒C bond formation [4–6]. The global demand for methanol would reach ~ 95 million metric tons until 2020 and keep sustainable growth [7]. Methane-to-methanol conversion is therefore seen as a dream reaction. However, the central challenge lies in reconciling the contradiction between the activation of methane C‒H bond and the susceptibility of methanol to over-oxidation [8,9]. Once activating the C‒H bond of methane (600–800 °C and 30–50 bar in general), it usually becomes very difficult to arrest a downhill tandem reaction at the intermediate state of methanol under these conditions, which to a certain extent explains the industrial syngas pathway to produce methanol indirectly because it is obviously easier to capture the more stable CO than methanol. One of the strategies to relieve over-oxidation in methane conversion is conducting the process at mild conditions, where the reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical (·OH) provides a promising solution for activating the inert C‒H bond (440 kJ mol−1) of methane [10–12]. Nevertheless, the further conversion of methanol seems inevitable ascribing to its more reactive nature than that of methane. Methanol conversion usually begins with O‒H activation, which due to the existence of ROS means continuing the downhill methane oxidation and ending up in CO or CO2 generation. In contrast, activating the unreactive C‒H bond of methanol with the O‒H group intact is more preferred, which would help to upgrade methanol into larger alcohols and multi-carbon compounds via C‒C coupling to extend the pathway of methane conversion instead of heading for over-oxidation. Cascading methane conversion and methanol valorization presents a new approach to fabricate value-added chemicals from methane directly. However, this strategy is rarely implemented. Although Wang et al. realized photocatalytic methane conversion through a methane-methanol-ethanol pathway, the O‒H bond of methanol was still activated, leading to the formation of CO byproduct [13]. The systems that could selectively activate the C‒H bond of methanol are few. Wang et al. demonstrated the preferential activation of C‒H bond in methanol on the surface of CdS, the enrichment of photoexcited holes due to MoS2 foam modification promoted this process as well as the selectivity of ethylene glycol [14]. Li et al. indicated that the aggregated photoexcited electrons on the c-plane surface of p-GaN nanowire would attack the methanol C‒H bond to generate methyl carbene for C‒C coupling [15]. These works suggest that the enriched surface charge (SC) or the built-in electric field might be beneficial to the selective activation of the methanol C‒H bond and the further formation of C‒C bond. Piezoelectric materials, characterized by their non-centrosymmetric structure, could induce an asymmetric distribution of the SC under the application of mechanical stress, satisfying our design requirements of the enriched SC for product upgrade. The imbalanced charge state of the piezoelectrics would even trigger an electrochemical reaction, namely, the piezocatalytic effect, which has been confirmed to activate H2O and O2 at ambient conditions and generate ROS [16,17]. Among the piezoelectrics, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, HAp), whose piezoelectricity (1–16 pm V−1 of piezoelectric constant and ~ 100 GPa of Young’s modulus) originates from the ferroelectric ordering of the OH– ions along the [001] direction [18–24], has stimulated a research boom in heterogeneous catalysis involving C‒C bond formation (oxidative coupling of methane, Guerbet reaction of alcohols, Diels-Alder reaction, etc.) owing to its stability and tunable acid-base properties [25–31]. Besides, due to the hydrophilicity of HAp, the coordination between H2O and the Lewis acidic Ca2+ ions as well as the H-bonding to the basic O atoms of PO4 3− units would highly polarize the H2O molecule. Hence, the good performance of HAp in water-gas shift reaction and the combustion of volatile organic compounds, as well as the positive effect of H2O introduction in some condensation reaction might relate to the facile activation of H2O by HAp [32–37]. We believe that the piezocatalytic effect of HAp ( Scheme 1) would regulate the activation of H2O as well as other small molecules and make it a competent candidate for methane conversion at mild conditions. In the present work, methane conversion is realized over HAp under ultrasonic vibration. The ·OH generated from the piezocatalytic effect of HAp interacts with the C‒H bond of methane and triggers its conversion. Also, methanol dehydration attributed to the ultrasonic-induced negative SC provides methyl carbene as an attractive C1 building block turning methanol into larger alcohols together with the radical coupling process. This strategy successfully extends the pathway via C‒C coupling rather than heading towards over-oxidation."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The commercial HAp and ZnO were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. (Item No. H106378 and Z141332 respectively). The commercial SrTiO3 was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Item No. S818365). All the chemicals involved were of analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Miniflex II desktop X-ray diffractometer with an operating voltage of 30 kV and current of 100 mA, and the wavelength of monochromatized Cu Kα radiation was 0.15418 nm. The morphology of the samples was investigated using a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The ratio of Ca to P was estimated by an Agilent 5110 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) instrument. UV–vis absorption spectra and diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured using a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating sphere attachment with BaSO4 as the reference. Methane temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer. Typically, the sample was pretreated at 200 °C in helium for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the atmosphere was switched to methane and held for 2 h for methane adsorption. Then the sample was heated to 600 °C under helium atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C min−1. All the rate of gas flow was set to 30 mL min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out on a Discovery TGA5500 thermal analyzer in flowing N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to rule out the desorption of adsorbed water during TPD analysis (Supplementary Fig. 22). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected on a Lambda FTIR-7600 spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1."
4,Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and ferroelectric measurements,"2.3 Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and ferroelectric measurements PFM measurements were done upon a Bruker Dimension ICON atomic force microscope (AFM) equipped with a ferroelectric test system, the HAp suspension was spin-coated onto a Pt deposited SrTiO3 substrate. During the PFM characterization, the AC bias for measuring amplitude and phase images was 0 V, and the resonance frequency for measuring the butterfly-shaped amplitude curve and the hysteresis loop was 19 kHz. The ferroelectric property of HAp was studied by a ferroelectric analyzer (aixACCT TF-2000E) at 4000 V and 10 Hz under room temperature. The HAp sample was pressed in a tablet (diameter of ~ 10 mm and thickness of ~ 1 mm) without further annealing, then silver paste was applied to both sides of the tablet (effective area of ~ 30 mm2)."
5,Acid/basic probe molecule adsorption,"2.4 Acid/basic probe molecule adsorption Pyridine/pyrrole was selected as a basic/acid probe molecule to study the acid/basic sites on HAp. Typically, 20 mg of HAp was dispersed in 1 mL cyclohexane and placed in a dialysis membrane bag with an appropriate pore size (14 kDa), which allowed the transport of the probe molecule. The dialysis membrane bag was then immersed in 50 mL of cyclohexane containing 10 μmol pyridine. In order to calculate the adsorption capacity of pyridine over HAp, the residual amount of pyridine was detected after standing for 1 h, during ultrasonic vibration (53 kHz, 250 W, KUDOS SK250H), and standing for 1 h after ultrasonic vibration, respectively, by an Agilent 1260 Infinity high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a C18 column and a UV detector (injection volume: 20 μL; ratio of water to methanol: 55/45; column temperature: 30 °C; flow rate: 0.5 mL min−1; detection wavelength: 252 nm for pyridine and 215 nm for pyrrole). The study of pyrrole adsorption on HAp was the same as that of pyridine. The corresponding calibration curves were shown in Supplementary Fig. 23."
6,Au deposition,"2.5 Au deposition For Au deposition under ultrasonic vibration, 20 mg of HAp was dispersed in 50 mL of 20 vol% ethanol solution containing 5 μmol HAuCl4. Then the ultrasonic vibration was turned on for 1 min. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the suspension were measured using a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer. The lilac sample was centrifuged and washed with water several times and then dried at 60 °C overnight. Its XRD pattern was recorded on a Rigaku Miniflex II desktop X-ray diffractometer. For Au deposition under high-speed stirring, 20 mg of HAp was dispersed in 50 mL of 20 vol% ethanol solution containing 5 μmol HAuCl4. Then the suspension was stirred at 25 °C at 12,000 rpm for 4 min. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the suspension were measured using a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer."
7,Reactive oxygen species detection,"2.6 Reactive oxygen species detection The hydroxyl radical was monitored using terephthalic acid as a probe, which could readily capture the radical to produce fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid. In a typical test, 20 mg of HAp was dispersed in 50 mL of 0.5 mmol L−1 terephthalic acid dissolved into 2 mmol L−1 NaOH. N2 (105 mL min−1) or a mixture of N2 (100 mL min−1) and O2 (5 mL min−1) was bubbled continuously through the suspension for 30 min, after which the ultrasonic vibration (53 kHz, 250 W, KUDOS SK250H) was turned on for 1 h. The temperature of the system was kept at 25 °C. Fluorescent spectra of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid in the filtrate were measured by a Hitachi F-4600 spectrophotometer excited at 315 nm. The superoxide radical was detected using nitroblue tetrazolium as a probe, which could react with the radical to generate formazan. The violet formazan would deposit on the surface of the catalyst. In general, 20 mg of HAp was dispersed in 50 mL of 5 μmol L−1 nitroblue tetrazolium (0.25 μmol in total). A mixture of N2 and O2 was bubbled at the flow rate of 100 and 5 mL min−1 respectively. After evacuating the system with N2/O2 atmosphere, ultrasonic vibration (53 kHz, 250 W, KUDOS SK250H) was applied at 25 °C for 1 h. The absorption of nitroblue tetrazolium and the DRS spectra of the catalyst were recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer. It should be noted that the generation of superoxide radical was an order of magnitude lower than the alcohols, which was not contradictory to the result that no CO or CO2 was detected."
8,Electrochemical analysis,"2.7 Electrochemical analysis For the electrochemical analyzes, transient current response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed under open circuit potential at 25 °C on a Chenhua CHI 660D electrochemical workstation with conventional three-electrode cell system: both the working electrode and the counter electrode were Pt sheets, and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. 20 mg of HAp was dispersed in 50 mL of 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte. The gas (N2, 5 vol% O2 in N2 or 10 vol% CH4 in N2) was continuously bubbled at the flow rate of 20 mL min−1 during the whole test. It should be noted that the direction of the current (positive or negative) depended on the open circuit potential, which was positive during the analysis and likewise the current response."
9,Piezocatalytic methane/methanol conversion,"2.8 Piezocatalytic methane/methanol conversion Piezocatalytic oxidation of methane involved a series of liquid-solid dynamic experiments at 25 °C. During each test, a suspension of 20 mg HAp in 50 mL deionized water was added into the reactor. A mixture of 10 vol% methane in N2 (100 mL min−1) and O2 (5 mL min−1) was bubbled continuously through the suspension for 30 min, then the ultrasonic vibration (53 kHz, 250 W, KUDOS SK250H) was turned on for 1 h. After that, filtrate from the suspension was injected into a Techcomp GC7900 gas chromatographer equipped with a SE-54 column and flame ionization detector. The amount of H2O2 was determined by the KI spectrophotometric method via a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer at 350 nm. The calibration curves of the alcohols and H2O2 were shown in Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25. The liquid-solid static experiment was conducted to analyze the gaseous byproduct in piezocatalytic methane conversion. The procedure was similar to that of the dynamic experiment but the reactor was sealed after evacuating with the gas mixture. Using the Techcomp GC7900 gas chromatographer and flame ionization detector, CO2 and CO were analyzed by a TDX-01 column and a methane reformer (detection limit: ~ 0.05 ppm) while ethane and ethylene were detected by an Al2O3/S column. For piezocatalytic methanol conversion, the procedure was the same as methane conversion whereas an additional 10 μmol methanol was introduced in the system and the atmosphere was turned into 100 mL min−1 N2 or 10 vol% ethylene in N2 with the O2 content remained unchanged. The qualitative analysis of methyl carbene (ethylene and cyclopropane) by gas chromatography and multi-carbon compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were conducted on a Techcomp GC7900 gas chromatographer equipped with an Al2O3/S column and a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 system equipped with an HP-5 column respectively."
10,Results,
11,Piezocatalytic methane conversion,"3.1 Piezocatalytic methane conversion All the experiments were carried out using commercial HAp. The structure and morphology of HAp were shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. The Ca/P ratio was estimated to be 1.64, which was close to the theoretical value of 1.67. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was first performed to characterize the piezoelectric property of HAp. The topographic, vertical piezoresponse amplitude and phase images of the weakly agglomerate HAp were shown in Fig. 1a–c (pale blue circles). Although the contrast of the images was not obvious, the butterfly-shaped amplitude curve (Fig. 1d) displayed apparent variation in the amplitude under the external electric field, while the phase angle changed by approximately 200° in the hysteresis loop, verifying the piezoelectricity of HAp. The macroscopic polarization-electric field hysteresis loop of the HAp tablet also provided evidence for the piezoelectricity (Supplementary Fig. 3). As HAp was proven to be piezoelectric, asymmetric distribution of the SC would occur under ultrasonic vibration, meaning the change of the surface structure of HAp, especially the surface acid/basic sites that were important to methane conversion. Pyridine was selected as a basic probe molecule to investigate the acid sites on HAp, while pyrrole was chosen as an acid probe molecule for the basic sites. As shown in Fig. 2a, there were both sites on HAp. The adsorption capacity of both pyridine and pyrrole over HAp increased under ultrasonic vibration and returned to the normal level when the vibration was off. The result demonstrated the surface structure variation (more acid and basic sites) at the application of mechanical stress, also implied the formation of the ultrasonic-induced positive and negative SC. The reduction of Au3+ was then conducted over HAp under ultrasonic vibration to validate its piezocatalytic effect. A small amount of Au3+ was reduced into Au nanoparticle in the blank experiment (Supplementary Fig. 4). Au3+ reduction was much obvious in the presence of HAp, and this process lasted for about 15 min after the vibration was off (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5). The reduction even happened when the Au3+ was introduced into the HAp suspension after ultrasonic vibration (Fig. 2c). Considering that the lifetime of the cavitation bubble was usually at the microsecond scale while the timescale of Au3+ addition was several seconds, the impact of local high temperature caused by the cavitation bubble was limited in this case. These results implied the relaxation of surface polarization charge on HAp after ultrasonic vibration. Furthermore, Au3+ reduction under high-speed stirring at room temperature was also conducted to rule out the impact of local high temperature during ultrasonic vibration. Although high-speed stirring was less efficient than ultrasonic vibration, Au3+ could be reduced into Au nanoparticle in the presence of HAp (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 6). The results above clearly demonstrated the induced SC on HAp under the application of mechanical stress, and the nature of the process was indeed piezocatalysis. Transient current response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were also carried out under open circuit potential to study the piezocatalytic effect of HAp. The current response in the blank test (Fig. 2e) was ascribed to the promoted solution conductivity under ultrasonic vibration, in accordance with the smaller semicircle in the EIS Nyquist plot (Supplementary Fig. 7). The introduction of HAp gave rise to a noticeable change of the current and impedance. On one hand, the piezoelectric HAp acting as small cells under ultrasonic-induced stress enhanced the suspension conductivity. On the other hand, the activation of H2O over HAp consumed part of the ultrasonic-induced SC (as also confirmed by the generation of ·OH hereinafter), which would weaken the influence of HAp to the suspension conductivity. The apparent current response in the presence of HAp under N2 atmosphere was the comprehensive result including (but not limited to) the above factors. Moreover, the current response decreased after the inlet of O2 or methane, indicating that the influence of HAp to the suspension conductivity was weakened because the HAp participated in the activation of O2 or methane. The more obvious current decay after introducing methane than that of O2 might imply a stronger interaction between HAp and methane under ultrasonic vibration. Since the piezocatalytic effect of HAp helped to activate the small molecules, the ROS generated by the ultrasonic-induced positive and negative SC were investigated using chemical probes [38,39]. The hydroxyl radical (·OH) was detected using terephthalic acid (Supplementary Fig. 8). The fluorescent signal of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid implied that H2O was oxidized anaerobically over HAp under ultrasonic vibration, and this process was boosted with O2 admission. The superoxide radical (·O2 −) was also found in the presence of O2 with the help of nitroblue tetrazolium (Supplementary Fig. 9). So, H2O and O2 were indeed activated attributing to the piezocatalytic effect of HAp, among which the generated ·OH would facilitate methane conversion. Besides, the peaks at around 130 and 240 °C in the methane temperature-programmed desorption corresponding to physical and chemical desorption of methane gave another evidence for methane activation on HAp (Supplementary Fig. 10). Piezocatalytic methane conversion was performed at ambient conditions (25 °C and 1 atm). Nothing occurred in the blank experiments without HAp, without methane admission or without ultrasonic vibration, and also nothing was received by replacing H2O with acetonitrile. The blank injection of the methane feed in the gas chromatographer ruled out the contamination of other alkane and olefin (Supplementary Fig. 11). As shown in Fig. 2f, methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol were obtained as liquid products in piezocatalytic methane conversion. The highest production rate of alcohols (84.4, 43.2 and 9.6 μmol g−1 h−1 for methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol respectively) was achieved at the methane to O2 ratio of 1:0.5, which was comparable to that of photocatalysis under similar mild conditions (Supplementary Table 1), while the further raise of the O2 content would lead to production decline as well as H2O2 generation. A small amount of ethane and ethylene were found as the gas byproducts, yet there was no sign of CO or CO2 (Supplementary Fig. 12). The production rate of alcohols decreased along with weakened ultrasonic power (Supplementary Fig. 13). Cycling tests revealed the continuous production of alcohols without apparent decay (Supplementary Fig. 14). Moreover, the pH of the filtrate at the end of each run (~ 6.3) was almost the same as that at the beginning, which could rule out CO2 dissolution. About 0.63 mg L−1 of Ca2+ was detected in the filtrate, corresponding to the dissolution of 0.16% of the sample, which was acceptable due to the slightly soluble nature of HAp. After the cycling tests, no obvious change occurred on the structure and morphology of HAp (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). The turnover number of methane that was converted into alcohols was calculated to be 2, suggesting that the process was indeed a catalytic reaction. In addition, when the HAp was replaced by another oxide-based piezoelectric material, such as SrTiO3 and ZnO (commercial, nanosized), no alcohol was received (Supplementary Fig. 17). Although these materials were also used as catalysts in different methane conversion systems, which implied their abilities of methane activation under certain conditions, the reports about SrTiO3 and ZnO catalyzing C–C bond formation were rare. Thus, the capability of HAp in producing multi-carbon compounds was unique, which might be related to its surface acid-base property."
12,Catalytic mechanisms,"3.2 Catalytic mechanisms C2 and C3 alcohol production demonstrated the feasibility of the methanol upgrading strategy through the C‒C bond formation. A series of controlled experiments were then conducted to unveil possible mechanisms. To be clear, all the catalytic process happened on the surface or near-surface of HAp instead of in the bulk phase. Based on the results above, the generation of ROS was as follows (Eqs. (1)–(5)), from which H2O oxidation into ·OH and H2O2 took place ascribed to the ultrasonic-induced positive SC of HAp, whereas O2 reduction into ·O2 − and H2O2, as well as H2O2 decomposition, occurred attributed to the negative SC on the other side. Introducing an appropriate amount of O2 into the system might facilitate charge separation and provide more ·OH for methane conversion. (1) H2O → ·OH + H+ + e− (2) 2H2O → H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− (3) O2 + e− → ·O2 − (4) O2 − + e− + 2H+ → H2O2 (5) H2O2 + e− → ·OH + OH− Different sacrificial agents were introduced to investigate the performance of piezocatalytic methane conversion ( Fig. 3a). When the ·OH was quenched by glycerol, the production of the alcohols was shut down, indicating the necessity of ·OH for methane activation. More methanol was obtained by adding CCl4 to block the reductive reaction or eliminating the ·O2 − with 1,4-benzoquinone, while terminating the oxidative reaction with Na2SO3 was negative to methanol production, which implied that the formation of methanol was mainly dominated by the ·OH. The results also suggested that in our case H2O2 participated in the methane conversion as an intermediate instead of reacted with methane directly. At this point, the radical mechanism of piezocatalytic methane conversion became clear (Eqs. (6)–(11)). The hydrogen abstraction between ·OH and methane generated methyl radical, which reacted with H2O to produce methanol on one hand and dimerized to form ethane on the other hand. Ethane would be converted into ethanol through a similar radical route to that of methane, and the ethylene might stem from the further oxidation of ethane. (6) CH4 + ·OH → ·CH3 (7) ·CH3 + H2O → CH3OH (8) ·CH3 + ·CH3 → C2H6 (9) C2H6 + ·OH → ·CH2CH3 + H2O (10) ·CH2CH3 + H2O → CH3CH2OH + ·H (11) ·H + ·OH → H2O Interestingly, in spite of the comparable methanol production rate between suppressing the ·O2 − and the reduction process, the ethanol yield was different where it rose a little by quenching the ·O2 − and dropped about one-third by restraining the reductive reaction. Moreover, as the production of methanol fell by nearly half due to the inhibition of the oxidation process, the ethanol yield was barely affected. According to the mechanism above, there were two pathways for the generation of ·OH. One was from H2O and the other was from H2O2. When the oxidative reactions were inhibited, ·OH generation from H2O was shut down and that from H2O2 was promoted. Under this circumstance, O2 reduction into H2O2 was improved, but the total amount of ·OH would drop since the indirect generation of ·OH from O2 was less efficient than the direct one from H2O (Supplementary Fig. 18). So, the generation of methyl radical was restrained and likewise that of methanol and ethane. Since ethane was the gas byproduct in methane conversion, the production of ethanol from ethane was suppressed to a large extent. Therefore, these results revealed a different pathway for ethanol generation other than the radical one, which was governed by the reductive reaction. For 2-propanol, its production was terminated by blocking the reduction process and promoted by inhibiting the ·O2 − or the oxidation process, which also demonstrated its dependence on the reductive reaction. From the analyzes above, we assumed that at the electron-rich surface of HAp where would induce the reduction process under ultrasonic vibration, some electrons were involved in O2 reduction and H2O2 decomposition, while the other (may not be consumed) facilitated carbon chain growth to produce ethanol and 2-propanol. Also, in Fig. 3b, surface methoxy species on HAp after cycling tests were observed in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra at 2800–3000 cm−1, which was identified as a crucial intermediate in methanol valorization [40,41]. So, the key step behind was very likely the dehydration of methanol into methyl carbene involving the ultrasonic-induced negative SC (basic sites) on HAp [15]. Experiments of piezocatalytic methanol conversion over HAp were then carried out to verify the conjecture (Fig. 3c). Ethanol and 2-propanol were the products of methanol conversion, there was a significant promotion of the yield as the oxidative reaction was suppressed by Na2SO3, in contrast, they were hardly detected as CCl4 was introduced to restrain the reductive reaction. The results of introducing pyridine and pyrrole to poison the acid and basic sites were similar to that of Na2SO3 and CCl4 respectively, proving that the methanol upgrade process was dominated by the basic sites (ultrasonic-induced negative SC) on HAp. More remarkably, ethylene and cyclopropane were detected as the gas byproducts of methanol conversion (Fig. 3d), which suggested the formation of methyl carbene since some of them would undergo dimerization and cyclopropanation. Furthermore, ethylene could also act as the scavenger of methyl carbene. When ethylene was bubbled during methanol conversion, the production of ethanol and 2-propanol was inhibited, which supported our deduction. Thus, it was the methyl carbene that participated in the carbon chain growth to generate ethanol and 2-propanol (Eqs. (12)–(16)). (12) CH3OH → :CH2 + H2O (13) :CH2 + CH3OH → CH3CH2OH (14) :CH2 + CH3CH2OH → (CH3)2CHOH (15) :CH2 + :CH2 → C2H4 (16) :CH2 + C2H4 → C3H6"
13,Discussion,"In our system, the radical pathway provided a major contribution to the activation and coupling of alkanes, while the non-radical one involving methyl carbene was also promising for C‒C bond formation ( Scheme 2), their potential for product upgrade was further investigated. When methane was replaced by ethane, ethanol (125.1 μmol g−1 h−1) and 1-butanol (31.9 μmol g−1 h−1) were obtained. Since no 1-butanol was received in piezocatalytic ethanol conversion over HAp (Supplementary Fig. 19) which ruled out the Guerbet reaction, the C4 product in ethane conversion might come from the coupling of the ethyl radical (Supplementary Fig. 20). However, the alkyl radical from n-alkane with increasing carbon number became less reactive for further coupling, only 1-butanol (60.1 μmol g−1 h−1) was detected in piezocatalytic butane conversion. As a result, the radical pathway was responsible for the alkane-to-alcohol conversion, and the radical coupling only worked for light alkanes like methane and ethane. For the non-radical pathway, after prolonging the ultrasonic time of piezocatalytic methanol and ethanol conversion, the multi-carbon compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figs. 19 and 21). Several C4 and C5 products were discovered after methanol conversion containing ketones (2-butanone, 2-pentanone, and 3-pentanone) and esters (methyl propionate and methyl butanoate), C6 product (1,1-diethoxyethane) was even found after ethanol conversion. The degree of carbon chain growth could be controlled by changing the ultrasonic time. Therefore, the non-radical pathway in piezocatalytic methane conversion was important to alcohol upgrade, in which the highly reactive methyl carbene played a key role as a fascinating C1 building block. On the other hand, the special acid-base properties of HAp might also contribute to C‒C coupling under ultrasonic vibration. In other words, the piezocatalytic effect of HAp facilitated H2O polarization and methane activation under ambient conditions, meanwhile, the radical coupling and the methyl carbene assisted C‒C bond formation promoted product upgrade to larger alcohols and even multi-carbon compounds rather than heading for over-oxidation. Besides inducing methanol dehydration to generate methyl carbene, the asymmetric charge distribution on the surface of HAp under ultrasonic vibration also tuned the surface state, which might be positive for the activation of small molecules and C‒C coupling. Further research on the structure-activity relationship was pursuing."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, methane conversion and upgrade were achieved at ambient conditions by virtue of the piezocatalytic effect of HAp. Systematic experiments revealed the generation of ROS under ultrasonic vibration, in which the ·OH would attack the C‒H bond of light alkanes to produce corresponding alcohols. At the same time, methanol dehydration took place ascribed to the ultrasonic-induced negative SC on HAp, producing methyl carbene to turn methanol into ethanol and ethanol into 2-propanol. The C‒C coupling process successfully extended the pathway and mitigated the susceptibility of methanol to over-oxidation. Our work put forward an interesting strategy for product upgrade in piezocatalytic methane conversion, and it was also promising in organic synthesis concerning carbon chain growth."
