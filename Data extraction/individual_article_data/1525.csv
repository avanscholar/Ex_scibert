0,Introduction,"Due to the growing global energy demand and increasing concern for environmental issues, solar-driven hydrogen production has drawn considerable interest as solar energy is a clean inexhaustible energy resource [1]. The daily and seasonal variability of sunlight, energy harvested from the sun needs to be efficiently converted into clean chemical fuel that can be stored, transported, and used upon demand [2]. The solar-driven water splitting is a very attractive approach to using the solar energy for producing hydrogen fuel [3], taking advantage of ∼120,000 terawatts of radiation that continually strikes the earth’s surface [4]. Hydrogen is an excellent energy carrier having [5,6]: (i) no carbon emission economy; (ii) high calorific value per mass unit (143kJkg−1), 3.2 times more energy than gasoline and (iii) no greenhouse gases are produced during its combustion process. Storage of solar energy as H2 fuel is proposed to be one of an ideal routes for developing clean and sustainable energy [7]. For decades, NASA has relied upon hydrogen gas as rocket fuel to deliver crew and cargo to space [8]. The first use of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction was on TiO2. However, the practical application of TiO2 is significantly hindered by its wide bandgap of 3.2eV. TiO2 absorbs only the UV light (3–4%) contained in the solar spectrum [9]. TiO2-based photocatalysts are the most promising materials for H2 generation from water splitting because of their relatively high efficiency, high photostability, abundance, low cost, and nontoxic qualities [10]. Research and development are focused on the development of TiO2-based photocatalysts efficiently harvest the visible light spectrum, which is ∼43% of the solar spectrum. Visible-light-responsive of TiO2 has been significantly enhanced by doping TiO2 with low bandgap materials such as: noble metals (Ag, Au, Pt), metal oxides (Fe2O3, NiO, WO3), metals sulfide (CdS, PbS, ZnS, NiS), and nonmetal doping (B, H, N, C) [11,12]. The direct connection between the dopants and TiO2 and the distribution of the dopants over TiO2 photocatalyst are crucial factors to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2-based photocatalysts [13,14]. CdS semiconductor nanostructures as photocatalyst have attracted intense interest to harvest light energy due to their unique photochemical and photophysical properties in recent years. CdS is an important II–VI semiconductor, it can be potentially applied in many fields such as light-emitting diodes, thin film transistors, solar cells, and photocatalysts [15]. The narrower bandgap of CdS facilitates the utilization of visible light. When CdS is irradiated by visible light, electrons located in the valence band can be excited to the conduction band, forming electron-hole pairs, which are responsible for the photocatalytic activity. Disadvantageously, the rapid recombination of the excited electron-hole pairs is an obstacle limiting the photocatalytic activity of catalysts. To overcome CdS drawback, it should be stabilized with other cocatalysts as noble metals [2]. Platinum (Pt) is considered to be the best cocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production, CdS nanoparticles, aside from Pt nanoparticles (NPs), is a commonly used cocatalyst because of its narrow bandgap of 2.2eV. CdS offers great opportunities to harvest light energy in the visible region and dramatically enhance the visible-light-response of TiO2. However, the oxidation process of CdS-based photocatalyst remains the key problem in supersaturated oxygen environments [16], where the amount of H2 generated strongly depends on the oxidation pathway and determined by the presence or absence of oxygen. Sacrificial reagents such as Na2S and Na2SO3 are commonly used to improve the photostability for the metal sulfides based systems. (1) CdS+4h+ +O2 +H2O→Cd2+ +SO4 2− +4H+ A wide variety of synthesis methods has been reported to the synthesis of CdS/TiO2 nanocomposite particles, including bifunctional organic molecule linking, chemical deposition, physical mixing, one-step synthesis, reverse micelles and impregnation methods [17]. In photocatalysis, the heterojunctions in core-shell CdS@TiO2 photocatalyst allow the CdS NPs to harvest the light energy in the visible region, inject excited electrons and generate photocurrent [18–20]. The size, morphology, and the contact area (interaction) between the CdS and TiO2 affect on photocatalytic activity and photocorrosion stability. Qi et al. [21] prepared TiO2 nanosheets/Pt/CdS photocatalyst via immersing Pt/TiO2 nanosheets in alcoholic solutions of Cd(NO3)2 and Na2S. The photocatalyst showed high photocorrosion stability and high quantum efficiency upto 13.9% at a wavelength of 420nm. Li et al. [22] prepared TiO2 nanotubes/Pt/CdS nanocomposites and studied their photocatalytic water splitting under visible irradiation. The quantum yield for hydrogen evolution reached 43.4% at a wavelength of >420nm. Zhang et al. [23] prepared TiO2 nanotubes/CdS nanocomposite by ion exchange and a subsequent sulfurization process. The photocatalyst achieved hydrogen evolution rate of 1708μLg−1 for 6h at a wavelength of >420nm. Jang et al. [24] synthesized a photocatalyst consisting of bulk CdS modified with TiO2 NPs. The photocatalyst exhibited hydrogen evolution rate of 980μmolh−1 in presence of 1wt% of Pt as a cocatalyst and a wavelength of >420nm. In this study, mesoporous, high surface area 0D and 1D core-shell CdS@TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized for hydrogen production from an aqueous solution containing a sacrificial agent. Sphere-like and rod-like CdS NPs (core) were synthesized by reverse micelle solvent and solvothermal method, respectively. Core-shell CdS@TiO2/Pt photocatalysts were prepared via coating of TiO2 shell on the core CdS NPs using sol-gel chemistry and then photodepositing tiny Pt NPs on the TiO2 shell. A post-deposition annealing treatment is developed in order to obtain a structure with twofold active crystalline phases, hexagonal CdS, and anatase TiO2. Furthermore, the TiO2 shell protects the core CdS NPs from oxidation and dissolution in the solution. The morphological, structural, and optical properties, the visible light photocatalytic activities of the core-shell CdS@TiO2 for hydrogen evolution are investigated. TiO2 shell on the core CdS NPs (sphere-like and rod-like) accepts the photogenerated electrons and tiny Pt NPs provide sites for the H2 evolution. As a member of core-shell nanocomposites family, one-dimensional (1D) core-shell nanocomposites that are utilized as photocatalysts have received a great deal of research interest, because of their unique structural and electronic properties in recent years."

3,Preparation of sphere-like CdS,"2.2 Preparation of sphere-like CdS Sphere-like CdS core particles (0D) were synthesized by reacting CdCl2 and Na2S using reverse micelle system. The CdS NPs were synthesized by adding Emulsion I [28mL cyclohexane, 7g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1mL of 0.1M aqueous Na2S 9H2O and 1mL n-pentanol] to Emulsion II [28mL cyclohexane, 7g of SDS, 1mL of 0.1M CdCl2·2.5H2O and 1mL n-pentanol]. The mixture was sonicated for 30min. N-propanol (5mL) was added to the mixture to break up the micelles system and to precipitate the CdS NPs. The CdS NPs were collected from the solution by centrifuging the solution at 2000rpm for 10min, washing with ethanol and drying at 100°C for 24h. The CdS NPs were further annealed at 400°C for 2h in air."
4,Preparation of rod-like CdS,"2.3 Preparation of rod-like CdS Rod-like CdS core (1D) were synthesized by solvothermal method. In a typical procedure, Cd(NO3)2 4H2O and NH2CSNH2 with 1:3 molar ratio was added into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave which had been filled with ethylenediamine to 80% of its capacity. The autoclave was maintained at 160°C for 48h for solvothermal reaction and allowed to cool down to room temperature. The colored precipitate was filtered and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water to remove the residue of organic solvent."
5,Preparation of core-shell CdS@TiO2 nanostructures,"2.4 Preparation of core-shell CdS@TiO2 nanostructures The core-shell CdS@TiO2 photocatalysts (CTs) were synthesized by depositing TiO2 shell on the CdS core (sphere-like or rod-like). Approximately 1g of the pre-synthesized core CdS nanostructures was dispersed in 30mL of isopropyl alcohol containing titanium isopropoxide. The TiO2 shells were precipitated on the CdS cores by adding 50mL of monodistilled water to the mixture under vigorous stirring for 1h. The yellow solution was transferred into a 100mL stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon line and kept at 150°C for 24h. Then the precipitate was collected from the solution by filtration, washing with ethanol and drying at 80°C for 24h. The CdS@TiO2 NPs were further annealed at 400°C for 2h in air. Different content of TiO2 shells in CT-x system (with x: 25, 50 or 75wt%) were also prepared to investigate the effect of TiO2 shell loading. The prepared route of CTs is shown in Fig. 1 ."
6,Preparation of pure TiO2 nanoparticles,"2.5 Preparation of pure TiO2 nanoparticles Pure TiO2 NPs were prepared by sol-gel and used as a reference. Typically, 7mL of Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 was dissolved in 100mL isopropyl alcohol. Monodistilled water (400mL) was added and the acquired solution was aged for 3h. The produced gel was washed three times with monodistilled water and ethanol and then dried at 100°C for 24h. The TiO2 NPs were obtained by annealing the precipitate at 400°C for 2h in air [25]."
7,"Characterization of CdS, TiO2 and CdS@TiO2 nanostructures","2.6 Characterization of CdS, TiO2 and CdS@TiO2 nanostructures The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the photocatalysts were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu XD-1 diffractometer) employing CuKα radiation (λ=0.15406nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F) was used for studying the particle size and morphology at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) has been performed by HRTEM. Raman spectra were recorded on the dispersive Raman microscope (Model Sentera, Bruker, Germany) instrument at a laser wavelength of 532nm [doubled Nd:YAG laser (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet)] and power of 10mW. The UV–vis spectra were measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Jasco model V-570) equipped with a diffuse reflectance attachment (Shimadzu IRS-2200). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5301 PC, Japan, SHIMADZU, 400W and 50/60Hz). The photoelectric current (PEC) measurements were accomplished using Volta lab 40 (Tacussel-Radiometer PGZ301) potentiostate. A 1M KOH was used as electrolyte with a standard three-electrode cell of the obtained sample, Ag/AgCl and platinum wire as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The samples were illuminated by visible light lamp (λ >400nm, 100mWcm−2). The electrochemical spectra (EIS) were carried out under illumination (100mWcm−2) at open circuit potential conditions over a frequency range of 10–106 Hz. All experiments were carried out under ambient conditions."
8,Photodeposition of tiny Pt NPs on the photocatalysts,"2.7 Photodeposition of tiny Pt NPs on the photocatalysts All the prepared samples (pure CdS, pure TiO2, and CdS@TiO2 NPs) were platinized using typical photodeposition method which was designed for depositing 0.1, 0.5, and 1wt.% of tiny Pt NPs. In a typical photolysis experiment, 100mg of a target photocatalyst was dispersed in 100mL aqueous solution containing 0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3 and an appropriate amount of 8% H2PtCl6·5H2O (∼0.1, 0.5 and 1wt.% Pt), with pH adjusted to 11 by the addition of a NaOH solution. Metallic platinum was deposited in situ on the photocatalyst surface by the photodecomposition of PtCl6 2−. The photocatalytic cell was equipped with gas inlet/outlet tubes, which serve to collect and transfer gaseous products to the analytical system."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test,"2.8 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test Typically, H2 production test was carried out in a closed gas circulation system under sunlight irradiation in the sunny day between 10:00 amand 4:00 pmin the month of April and May. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 10mg photocatalyst was dispersed with a constant stirring in 50mL of an aqueous solution of sacrificial reagent (0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3). N2 gas was introduced into the photocatalyst suspension to remove the dissolved O2. After a given irradiation time, the evolved hydrogen was collected and monitored by gas chromatography (GC-1690, Jiedao, TCD, Ar carrier) with a 5Å molecular sieve column (3m×2mm). Each experimental run was done in triplicate to observe the reproducibility. So, the photocatalytic results presented in this work are the average of three replicates."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Characterization of prepared nanostructures,"3.1 Characterization of prepared nanostructures The particle size and morphology of prepared 0D CdS NPs, 1D CdS nanowires (NWs), 0D TiO2 NPs, and CTs nanostructures were investigated with TEM (Fig. 2 ). As seen in TEM images, CdS NPs exhibit the 0D sphere-like morphology with an average particle diameter of ∼20nm while the CdS NWs have 1D highly uniform rod-like morphology with average particle dimensions of 40nm in diameter and 250nm in length. The pure TiO2 NPs show rhombohedral morphology with a particle diameter of ∼20nm. After the deposition of TiO2 onto the CdS NWs or CdS NPs, it can be seen from TEM images that TiO2 particles are densely coated onto the core of CdS NPs and wall of CdS NWs, thereby forming the 0D CdS@TiO2 and 1D CdS@TiO2, respectively. The shell thickness increases from 10 to 30nm with increasing TiO2 shell Wt%. It is clear that, during the formation process of 0D or 1D CdS@TiO2, the uniformly dispersed 0D CdS NPs or 1D CdS NWs in solution serve as heterogeneous seeds around which TiO2 shell grows, i.e., a well-known heterogeneous seeded growth process. The TEM results suggest that the 0D or 1D core shell CdS@TiO2 have been achieved via a carefully controlled one-step sol-gel process. The electron diffraction patterns (SAED) in Fig. 3 show more intense diffraction patterns for all prepared nanostructured materials refers to high polycrystalline formation approved by following XRD diffraction patterns. The formation, growth and interfacial interaction (heterojunction) between the core CdS NPs or CdS NWs and TiO2 shell can be explained by the sol-gel formation and the hydrolysis condensation reactions of titanium isopropoxide. When the alcoholic titanium isopropoxide solution was diluted with monodistilled water, sol NPs of the TiO2 are formed and deposited on the core CdS surface. The TiO2 sol NPs formation process involves: (i) aqueous hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide forming metal hydroxide Ti(OH)x; (ii) crosslinking and polymerization of Ti(OH)x forming stable molecular clusters “oligomers” by oxo (Ti-O-Ti) or hydroxo (Ti-OH-Ti) bridges generating H2O as a by-product; (iii) aggregation and heteronucleation of TiO2 oligomers on the CdS NPs or CdS NWs cores by continuous condensation and crosslinking of Ti(OH)x. As soon as the smallest stable molecular clusters of TiO2 are formed on the core CdS, they rapidly combine to give the next more stable particles “nuclei” [26,27]; (iv) growth of the nuclei by further condensation of the reactive precursors Ti(OH)x available in the solution forming colloidal sol NPs dispersed on the CdS surface; (v) assembling and condensation of the TiO2 sol NPs forming a continuous shell over the core CdS NPs; (vi) controlled drying and removal of the pore water accompanied by a significant shrinkage of the TiO2 shell, collapsing and densification yielding a xerogel and (vii) calcination of the xerogel-forming TiO2 NPs. Careful control during the synthesis process and subsequent drying and calcination of the gel are needed in order to obtain a uniform TiO2 shell. The polycondensation of titanium isopropoxide with water and aging the hybrid with subsequent annealing at 400°C for 2h bring to completion of the polycondensation and crystallization of TiO2 and give rise to protective TiO2 shell on the surface of core CdS NPs. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the prepared 0D CdS NPs, 1D CdS NWs, 0D TiO2 NPs and CTs nanostructures are shown in Fig. 4 , and the corresponding pore size distribution calculated through the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method using the desorption isotherm (see the inset of Fig. 4) and detailed data of the variations in BET surface area, average pore size, and pore volume are listed in Table 1 . As can be seen, pure core CdS (0D and 1D) and TiO2 NPs exhibit type II which indicates an indefinite multi-layer formation after completion of the monolayer with high surface area. With the clarity that the surface area and average pore diameter of prepared core shell nanostructures increased with core CdS wt% raised up. The increase in the surface area is related to the combination of core CdS and shell TiO2. In addition, the pore diameter distribution of core shell CdS@TiO2 nanostructures had sharp peaks due to the ordered deposition of the TiO2 shell. All prepared core shell CdS@TiO2 nanostructures possess a stepwise adsorption and desorption narrow H3 hysteresis loop at high relative pressures, represented by a typical Type IV isotherm, with the characteristics of mesoporous structures (mesopores have widths between 2 and 50nm). The prepared CTs nanostructures have a small capillary condensation step, which appears in the range of 0.8–1.0P/Po, illustrating that the prepared core shell nanostructures possess a hollow core or cavity caused by the packing of particles. The (0D)CT-25 structure was found to exhibit the largest surface area, 122m2 g−1. In the present work, we obtained composites with specific surface areas higher than those reported previously [28,29]. Therefore, we believe that the photocatalyst with this larger specific surface area and this average pore diameter can accommodate more surface-active sites and facilitate the transport of charge carriers in visible light, which is beneficial for enhancing the photocatalytic performance than has been reported previously. XRD diffraction patterns of the synthesized photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . The XRD diffraction patterns of core 0D CdS NPs and 1D CdS NWs are indexed to hexagonal crystal structure (JCPDS 01-080-0006) with sharp and narrow diffraction at 2θ ≈24.99° (100), 26.91° (002), 28.41° (101), 43.64° (110), 47.8° (103), and 51.9° (112), suggesting a high purity and complete formation of CdS nanostructures. This was confirmed by the absence of peaks of different phases. The XRD pattern of TiO2 NPs was demonstrated diffraction peaks (2θ) at 25.3, 37.8, 48.0, 53.9, 55.1, 62.7 and 75.0 that can be indexed to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (215) crystal faces of TiO2 with a tetragonal anatase structure (JCPDS 21-1276). The XRD patterns of CTs are indexed to a hexagonal crystal structure (JCPDS 01-080-0006) for the core CdS NPs or NWs and anatase crystal structure (JCPDS 21-1276) for the TiO2 shell. The variation in diffraction peaks of TiO2 in the CTs than those of pure TiO2 is may result from the CdS:TiO2 weight ratio and possible structure that TiO2 is densely coated on the surface of the CdS core [18]. The Raman spectra of the synthesized photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . The core CdS nanostructures show two intense peaks at ∼296cm−l and 600cm−l corresponds to the first (A11LO) and second-order (A12LO) longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes of CdS, respectively [30]. The pure TiO2 NPs show three intense peaks at ∼396, 515, and 645cm−1. The core-shell CdS@TiO2 exhibit intensity peaks of CdS and TiO2 at ∼192, 299, 399, 592, 645, 767, 894, 932, and 992cm−1. The CdS@TiO2 related peaks are slightly shifted from those of pure CdS and pure TiO2 NPs. The new peaks at ∼767, 894, and 932cm−1 observed for CdS-TiO2 NPs are attributed to the combination of an overtone of the A1 mode of Cd-S and Ti-O stretching vibration of TiO2. The peak shifts and the appearance of new peaks are ascribed to the heterojunction between the CdS and TiO2 NPs at the interface. Fig. 7 shows that coating of TiO2 onto CdS core nanostructures has a significant effect on the optical property of light absorption for the prepared CTs in the visible region. It is clear that the core-shell CdS@TiO2 exhibit significantly enhanced light absorption capacity in the visible region, compared to pure TiO2. The heterojunction of TiO2 shell with CdS cores effectively enhances the photoactivity of the TiO2 shell and improves its visible light absorbance. Compared with pure TiO2 NPs, the CTs demonstrate a red shift towards the visible region with a significant decrease in the visible reflection. The bandgap of the synthesized photocatalysts was calculated from the following equation[31]: (2) (αhν)2 = C· (hν − E) where α is the absorption coefficient; h is Planck's constant; ν is the light vibration frequency; C is a proportional constant; α is the absorption coefficient and E is the bandgap. The bandgap value is deduced by plotting (αhν)2 against the photon energy hν and extrapolating the intersection point of the linear part and background with the horizontal axis [32]. The bandgap of (0D)CdS, (1D)CdS, TiO2, (0D)CT-25, (0D)CT-50, (0D)CT-75 and (1D)CT-25 are ∼2.3, 2.3, 3.2, 2.2, 2.7, 3 and 2.2eV, respectively. This indicates that the photoresponse of CdS@TiO2 can be extended to the visible light region by depositing TiO2 shell on CdS cores. The PL spectra of the synthesized photocatalysts were shown in Fig. 8 . The photoluminescence (PL) spectra are related to the transfer behavior of the photo-induced electrons and holes so that it can reflect the separation and recombination of photo induced charge carriers inside the synthesized photocatalysts. The excitation wavelength of pure TiO2 NPs is about 469nm and this of core-shell CdS@TiO2 is at about 700nm. The PL intensity obtained for core-shell CdS@TiO2 is weaker than that of CdS cores, thus suggesting the longer lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers from CTs. The charge carriers with prolonged lifetime photoinduced from core-shell CdS@TiO2 are beneficial for the enhanced photocatalytic activity over the pure CdS cores [18]. In the UV region, the PL intensity of core-shell CdS@TiO2 lower than that of TiO2 shell and the core CdS, indicating that the electron–hole pair recombination is very slow. This is ascribed to the fact that the electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band of core CdS and then migrate to the TiO2 shell, which prevents the direct recombination of electrons and holes [32]. The photocurrent response was measured for (0D) CTs samples during repeated on/off visible light irradiation cycles at 1.23V vs. RHE. Obviously, as shown in Fig. 9 (a) all the samples reveal a fast and reproducible photocurrent response for several on–off cycles of illumination. PEC of (0D) CT-75 was approximately 4 times higher than that of (0D) CT-25 indicating significantly enhanced separation efficiency of the photoinduced electrons and holes as a result of the electronic interactions between the CdS and TiO2 in core sell structure. The charge separation and transport of the prepared samples were confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). As shown in Fig. 9(b) the semicircle in the EIS plot of (0D) CT-75 is the smallest, indicating a reduce in the solid-state interface-layer resistance with low charge-transfer resistance on the surface and better photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and mobility [33]. This suggests that there is an optimal CdS content for the best charge-transfer capability."
12,Hydrogen evolution in presence of sacrificial reagent,"3.2 Hydrogen evolution in presence of sacrificial reagent The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of the synthesized photocatalysts were listed in Table 2 . Fig. 10 illustrate an increase in the photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts towards the H2 production. Compared the rate constant, it is easy to find that the photocatalytic activity at 1wt% Pt decreases in the order of CdS(0D)@TiO2/Pt>CdS(1D)/Pt>CdS(0D)/Pt>TiO2/Pt. Fig. 10 shows that the CdS@TiO2/Pt photocatalyst achieves H2-production rate up to 4080μmol during 6h of sunlight irradiation at 1wt% Pt, which presents ∼4.5 times compared with CdS/Pt photocatalyst of 920μmol. This suggests that core-shell CdS@TiO2 nanostructure is favorable for high light utilization efficiency. This is consistent with the results of the TEM, BET, PL, UV–vis and bandgap measurements. Size, morphology and composition control of the core CdS via synthesis of sphere-like and rod-like and composite CTs have allowed for the improvement and fine tuning of photocatalytic and photocorrosion properties. Coating CdS cores with TiO2 shell yield strong visible-light absorption and to some extent protect CdS cores from extensive photocorrosion. The heterojunction between the CdS cores with TiO2 shell creates electronic states which can alter charge migration or produce a red shift in the absorption spectrum. The CdS@TiO2/Pt junction can spatially separate electron–hole pairs and thereby decrease recombination rates. H2 evolution amount steadily increases with the irradiation time, which indicates that no photocorrosion of CdS happens obviously. The heterojunction contact develops a potential gradient between the CdS cores and TiO2 shell. The Pt NPs deposited on the core-shell CdS@TiO2 surface induce the vectorial electron transfer from the CdS cores towards their heterojunked TiO2 shells, which benefits the evolution of H2. In contrast to CdS(0D)@TiO2 or pure CdS, the core-shell CdS(1D)@TiO2 is expected to have unique advantages as potential photocatalysts [18]: (i) the rod-like morphology leads to a fast and long-distance electron transport; and (ii) the light absorption and scattering can be obviously enhanced because of the high length-to-diameter ratio of the rod-like morphology. However, it is also found that the core-shell CdS(1D)@TiO2 have slightly same efficiency hydrogen production as the core-shell CdS(0D)@TiO2 under solar light illumination. There are also a number of other factors that affect the photocatalytic processes, including the surface area, nanoparticle’s size and shape, crystallinity, electron–hole recombination rate, heterojunction and synergistic effects between materials, as well as adsorbent–adsorbate interaction [34]. Fig. 10 shows that the photocatalytic activity of CdS@TiO2 slightly decreases with increasing the TiO2 shell thickness. The thick TiO2 shell suppresses the tunneling of the holes from the CdS cores to the surface atoms of the shell, resulting in the blockage of holes. Under sunlight irradiation, only the CdS core NPs are able to produce electron–hole pairs while the TiO2 shell cannot produce electron−hole pairs. Thus, although the TiO2 shell improves the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers of CdS@TiO2 NPs resulting from the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the CdS core to the TiO2 shell. CdS core can also remain the photoexcited holes and block them transfer to the surface of the TiO2 shell. As a result, the contribution of photogenerated holes to the photocatalytic oxidation reaction. Table 2 represents all the quantum efficiency of photocatalysts. Where (0D) CT-25 was recorded highly quantum efficiency. The quantum efficiency was calculated from “Solar-To-Hydrogen” conversion efficiency from following equation [35]: (3) S T H = [ ( m m o l e H 2 / S ) * ( 237 K J / m o l ) P t o t a l ( m W / c m 2 ) * A r e a ( c m 2 ) ] A M 1.5 G Where; H2 is hydrogen evolution rate was multiplied by Gibbs free energy for generated one mole of hydrogen from water, Ptotal is the total power of sunlight (AM1.5) [36] and Area is which exposed to incident light. Fig. 11 shows that the H2 evolution rate steadily increases with increasing the Pt NPs content from 0.1–1wt%. The optimum concentration of photodeposited Pt NPs is at about 1wt% Pt NPs. The hydrogen evolution rate significantly enhances by increasing the Pt loading amount until reaching a maximum value, which found to be ∼1wt%. Further increasing of the loading Pt amount gradually decreases hydrogen evolution rate. In general, loading too many particles Pt NPs may cause several problems [10]: (i) decrease the opportunity for the absorption of UV-light by TiO2; (ii) deform the potential field of TiO2 and draw a part of holes near to the TiO2-Pt junction, which increases the electron (e−) and hole (h+) recombination rate; and (iii) overload facilitates the thermal back reaction, producing H2O from H2 and O2 [10]. Table 3 represents the maximum photocatalytic activity of various photocatalysts for hydrogen production. The residual (0D)CT-25 from the catalytic experiment was eluted to introduced as a fresh catalyst to evaluate the utility of the prepared catalyst. Fig. 12 shows a great degree of sustainability of the designed core shell mesostructured during four cycles."
13,Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"3.3 Mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution Fig. 13 displays a schematic diagram of the H2 evolution over the CdS@TiO2/Pt photocatalyst in presence of the sacrificial reagents Na2S and Na2SO3 under the sunlight, the absorption of photons with energies exceeding the CdS bandgap. The electrons in the valence band of CdS excite to the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band (VB). The heterojunction at the interface of the CdS core and the TiO2 shell is efficient for separation of the photoinduced electron-hole pair and accelerate the photoinduced electron transformation from the conduction band (CB) of CdS with a bandgap of ∼2.2eV to the conduction band of TiO2 with a bandgap of ∼3.2eV. The electrons in CdS can be injected to TiO2 because the conduction band (CB) position of CdS is more negative than that of TiO2, leading to the improvement of charge separation efficiency [43]. Thus, the TiO2 shell acts as electron transit station for both trapping electrons from the CdS core while tiny Pt NPs on the TiO2 shell serving as H2 evolution sites [44]. The core CdS NPs absorb in the visible light region due to its smaller bandgap (∼2.2eV), and proper positions of the conduction band (−0.5V vs NHE) and valence band (1.7V vs NHE). The higher catalytic efficiency results from greater visible-light absorption and enhanced charge separation of the electron–hole pairs. Particularly, under sun light, electron–hole pairs only generate in CdS but not in TiO2. Thus electrons could be transferred from the conduction band of CdS to TiO2, while the holes remain in the valence band of CdS [34]. The nature of the contact between CdS, TiO2, and Pt is also critical in determining the efficiency of the charge separation process and overall catalytic efficiency. Due to photocorrosion, CdS NPs are not stable in aqueous media during the photocatalytic reactions where CdS NPs oxidize by the photogenerated holes. Therefore, it is important to improve the stability and suppress the photocorrosion of CdS NPs, such as by the addition of sacrificial reagents of S2− and SO3 2− in aqueous solutions. The photocatalytic reaction in presence of sacrificial reagents of S2− and SO3 2− and the photodeposition of Pt NPs on CdS-TiO2 NCs particles surface are suggested to follow the below steps: Electron-hole pair generation and photodeposition of Pt NPs (4) CdS@TiO2 +hv→CdS(h+)@TiO2(e−) (5) CdS(h+)@TiO2(e−) + H2PtCl6 +2OH− →CdS(h+)@TiO2/Pt+2H2O+6Cl− (6) CdS@TiO2/Pt+hv→CdS(h+)@TiO2/Pt(e−) Oxidation of sacrificial reagent and hydrogen evolution (7) S2− +2CdS(h+)@TiO2/Pt(e−)→S2 2− +2CdS@TiO2/Pt(e−) (8) SO3 2− +2CdS(h+)@TiO2/Pt(e−)+2OH− →SO4 2− +2H+ +2CdS@TiO2/Pt(e−) (9) S2 2− +SO3 2− →S2O3 2− +S2− (10) SO3 2− +S2− +2CdS(h+)@TiO2/Pt(e−)→S2O3 2− +2CdS@TiO2/Pt(e−) (11) 4H2O+4CdS@TiO2/Pt(e−)→4OH− +2H2 ↑+4CdS@TiO2/Pt"
14,Conclusions,"Mesoporous core shell nanostructure of CdS @ TiO2 photocatalysts (CTs) were prepared from CdS cores and TiO2 shell building by a simple process. The obtained photocatalysts were characterized by TEM, N2 adsorption/desorption, XRD, Raman, FTIR, TEM, diffuse reflection UV–vis and PL. The influences of TiO2 shell content, sphere-like or rod-like CdS core structure and concentration of photodeposited Pt NPs were investigated by measuring the photocatalytic performance for solar-driven hydrogen production. The photocatalytic efficiency in all CTs runs was higher than pure CdS and TiO2. This may be attributed to the formation of ordered core-shell CdS@TiO2 mesoporous structure with high surface area. A promising highest photocatalytic efficiency of 4080μmol during 6h of sun-light irradiation was obtained at a TiO2 shell content of 25% on 0D CdS core at 1% deposited Pt NPs which have largest surface area, 122m2 g−1 mean more surface-active sites and facilitate the transport of charge carriers in visible light. The potential gradient at the interface between CdS, TiO2, and Pt NPs allows the diffusion of photogenerated electrons generated in CdS core NPs toward TiO2 NPs and then to Pt NPs. These consequently lead to the marked activity towards H2 production of core-shell CdS@TiO2/Pt photocatalysts comparing with CdS/Pt and TiO2/Pt photocatalyst. This study promises a simple approach to fabricating core-shell nanostructure and can be applied to other semiconductor cores with TiO2 shells. The designed core-shell CdS@TiO2 photocatalysts have a great degree of sustainability and could have a potential industrial utilization."
