0,Introduction,"Energy crisis and environmental pollution hinder the sustainable development of society. People have realized the significance of clean energy. Hydrogen energy is widely concerned and researched because of its high combustion efficiency, rich resources, clean and recyclable characteristics. Hydrogen energy is regarded as the most potential energy in the 21st century [1–5]. Water electrolysis is an effective method to acquire hydrogen with the aid of electrocatalyst [6,7]. This method is simple, reliable, high conversion efficiency, which is able to achieve large-scale production. Platinum and palladium are the most common catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, which show good catalytic activity due to their low overpotential [8]. However, platinum and palladium are precious metals, which have low reserves on the earth and are expensive, which is not conducive to industrial production [9]. People began to study new materials to replace the precious metals in the hydrogen evolution reaction. It is found that Mo, W, Fe, Ni and Pd can be used as catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction [10,11]. In the process people gradually realized that the binary alloy catalysts could not only reduce the cost, but also significantly reduce the overpotential and improve the stability of the material, which make the research on binary catalysts is attractive [12]. For example, Paolo Salvi et al prepared porous Ni-Fe, Ni-Mo, Ni-Ti, Ni-Cr Alloys by chemical doping method [13]. The properties of Ni alloy doped with Mo did not significantly reduce after several hours of cathodic polarization, and its conductivity and electrode stability were improved. On the basis of binary catalyst, it is found that the surface roughness of the catalyst increases after adding the third element, which makes the specific surface area of the catalyst increase and further improves the activity and stability of the catalyst [14–16]. For example, Shervedani et al prepared Ni-Mo-P electrode and studied its cathodic polarization and alternative current (AC) impedance curve in 1 M NaOH, the test results show that the increase in electrode activity was due to increases in (i) surface roughness and (ii) intrinsic activity [17]. Herein, PtAuFe/C ternary composite catalyst and Pt/C catalyst were prepared by direct reduction of sodium borohydride. PtAuFe/C and Pt/C catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The performance of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst was tested using the electrochemical workstation, and the mechanism of hydrogen evolution was clarified."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemical reagents used in this experiment were of analytical grade and used without further purification, including carbon black (VulcanXC-72), chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), chlorogold acid (HAuCl4·4H2O), ferrous chloride (FeCl2), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), Nafion solution, ethanol (CH3CH2OH), isopropanol, alumina polishing powder, sulfuric acid."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts 2.2.1 Synthesis of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst A certain amount of chloroplatinic acid solution (3.7 mg•mL−1), chloroauric acid solution (4.78 mg•mL−1) and ferrous chloride were mixed with 0.5 mol•L−1 sodium borohydride solution. The acquired solution appeared black precipitation and bubbles. After standing for several hours, the solution was washed with anhydrous alcohol for three times and centrifuged using ultrasonic dispersion to remove impurity ions. Then PtAuFe powder with a mass ratio of 1:1:1 was obtained by drying in a 333 K vacuum oven for 6 h. Finally, PtAuFe/C (PtAuFe:C = 1:1) composite catalyst was prepared by ultrasonic dispersing of PtAuFe powder and carbon powder in isopropanol solution. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Pt/C catalyst Taking a certain amount of chloroplatinic acid solution (the theoretical loading is 50%) to prepare Pt/C catalyst. The preparation method is the same as above. Sung Mook Choi’s group characterized the prepared Pt/C by TEM characterization, test results prove that uniformly-dispersed Pt nanoparticles are found on the carbon support [18]."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM and EDS. The crystal structure and composition of the catalyst were measured by XRD-6100. The working voltage is 40 kV, the working current is 30 mA, the scanning range is 20°–80°, and the scanning rate is 8˚/min. The surface morphology and composition of the catalyst were analyzed by SEM and EDS. All the electrochemical tests were carried out on the electrochemical workstation (CHI760e) in a three electrode system. The glass carbon electrode (GCE, the diameter is 3 mm) with catalyst drop (0.0757 mg/cm2), platinum wire and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) are used as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode respectively. Taking 0.5 mg of prepared catalyst powder, 0.5 mg of carbon powder and 1.5 ml of isopropanol and mix them using ultrasonic dispersing for 30 min. 8 μl of prepared catalyst solution was dropped onto the working electrode surface, and then a drop of 0.5% Nafion solution was added onto the electrode to protect the catalyst."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physical characterizations,"3.1 Physical characterizations The XRD patterns of Pt/C and PtAuFe/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 a. Fig. 1a shows that the diffraction peaks of (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) crystal planes of Pt are corresponding to the 2θ of 40.02°, 46.46° and 67.76° respectively. The diffraction peaks of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) crystal planes of Au are corresponding to the 2θ of 38.32°, 47.02°, 64.82° and 77.64°. The diffraction peak of Fe appears at 2θ of 44.62°, which corresponds to the (1 1 0) crystal plane of Fe. The results show that PtAuFe/C catalyst has been successfully synthesized. Fig. 1b & c are the SEM images of Pt/C catalyst and PtAuFe/C composite catalyst. In Fig. 1b, Pt/C is aggregated in granular form and the aggregation was more serious. From Fig. 1c, we can find that adding Au and Fe changes the surface morphology. Compared with Pt/C catalyst, the agglomeration of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst is obviously reduced and the dispersion of catalyst is increased. Fig. 1d&e are the energy dispersive spectrum of Pt/C and PtAuFe/C composite catalysts respectively. Fig. 1d shows that the sample is mainly composed of Pt and carbon. Fig. 1e demonstrates that the composite sample is mainly composed of Pt, Au, Fe and carbon. The results are in accordance with those of XRD."
7,Electrocatalytic properties,"3.2 Electrocatalytic properties Fig. 2 a shows the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst and Pt/C catalyst at 298 K. The HER performance of electrocatalysts were tested by LSV in 0.5 M H2SO4. It can be seen that the initial hydrogen evolution potential of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst shifted positively about 10 mV compared with that of Pt/C catalyst, and the current density is 1.4 times of that of Pt/C catalyst at −0.4 V. It indicates that PtAuFe/C composite catalyst is of more positive initial hydrogen evolution potential and higher current density. The results show that the addition of Au and Fe improves the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst. To understand the hydrogen evolution mechanism of the catalysts, Tafel curves of the prepared catalysts were calculated. Fig. 2b shows the Tafel curves of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst and Pt/C catalyst, and the corresponding electrochemical kinetic parameters are shown in Table 1 . It can be seen from Fig. 2b that the kinetic characteristics of HER for the catalysts are in accordance with Tafel relationship. Table 1 shows that the Tafel slope b of Pt/C catalyst is 36 mV•dec−1 demonstrating that the reaction mechanism of Pt/C catalyst is Volmer Heyrovsky reaction. The Tafel slope b of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst is 30 mV•dec−1, and the reaction mechanism of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst is Volmer Tafel reaction. Compared with Pt/C catalyst, PtAuFe/C composite catalyst has a smaller Tafel slope b, which means that the current density of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst increases faster with the increase of overpotential and the faster hydrogen evolution rate was achieved. Fig. 2c is the CV curves of PtAuFe/C and Pt/C. PtAuFe/C has a higher current density and a stronger redox peak than Pt/C under the same conditions. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the samples are calculated according to the CV curves. It is found that the ECSA of Pt/C is 45.21 m2/g and that of PtAuFe/C is 57.96 m2/g. The higher the value of ECSA is, the higher the catalytic activity is. PtAuFe/C has a larger ECSA than Pt/C, indicating that PtAuFe/C has better catalytic activity, which is consistent with the results of LSV. Besides the activity, the stability of the catalysts is also an important factor to evaluate their performance. Fig. 2d&e show the LSV curves of Pt/C catalyst and PtAuFe/C composite catalyst. The stability of these two catalysts were judged by comparing the polarization current density after different scanning cycles. The current density corresponding to the LSV curve of Pt/C catalyst scanned by 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at −0.4 V is 15% lower than that of the 1st cycle, while the current density corresponding to the LSV curve of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst scanned by 1000 circles of CV at −0.4 V is 14% higher than that of 1st cycle. This may be due to the emergence of new active sites in the catalyst after multi-cycle scanning. Therefore, PtAuFe/C composite catalyst has better stability than that of Pt/C. Fig. 3 a is the LSV curves of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst at 298 K in different concentration of H2SO4 solutions. With the increase of the electrolyte concentration, the initial potential of hydrogen evolution has a significant positive shift and the current density has a significant increase. The initial potentials in 0.1 M, 0.5 M and 1 M of H2SO4 were 0.32 V, 0.29 V and 0.27 V respectively. The initial potentials in 0.5 M of H2SO4 were about 30 mV higher than that in 0.1 M of H2SO4, and the current density in 1 M of H2SO4 was 8.8 times higher than that in 0.1 M of H2SO4. It indicates that the concentration of H2SO4 has an obvious effect on the hydrogen evolution performance of PtAuFe/C. There are two ways of electrode polarization. One is the electrochemical polarization, which is caused by the slow reaction rate of a certain step in the process of electrolytic product precipitation (such as ion discharge, atom binding to molecules, bubble formation, etc.). The other is concentration polarization, which is caused by the difference between the concentration near the electrode and the concentration in the middle part of the solution due to the slow diffusion rate of the ions. By increasing the concentration of H2SO4, the ion concentration in solution will increase, which lead the increase of ion diffusion rate and the reduction of concentration polarization. For PtAuFe/C composite catalyst, the results show that the over potential of hydrogen evolution is reduced, the initial potential of hydrogen evolution is shifted positively, and the hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst is improved. Fig. 3b is the LSV curves of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst at different temperatures in the concentration of 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Table 2 shows the current density at −0.3 V for PtAuFe/C composite catalyst at different temperatures. It can be seen that temperature has an obvious effect on the hydrogen evolution reaction. As the temperature increase, the initial potential of hydrogen evolution moves forward and the overpotential of hydrogen evolution decreases. At the same potential, the current density increased gradually and the reaction rate of hydrogen evolution increased. The reason is that the temperature has an effect on the concentration polarization. When the temperature increases, the concentration polarization is reduced, so the hydrogen evolution overpotential is reduced and the hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst is improved. In addition, with the increase of temperature, the chemical kinetic constant increases, the reaction speed is accelerated, and the hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst is also improved."
8,Conclusion,"In this paper, Pt/C catalyst and PtAuFe/C composite catalyst were successfully prepared by direct reduction of sodium borohydride. XRD, SEM and EDS were used to characterize the crystal structure, morphology and composition. The hydrogen evolution mechanism of the two catalysts in H2SO4 and the effect of temperature and electrolyte concentration on the performance of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst were studied. In summary, Pt/C and PtAuFe/C composite catalysts have crystal structure. The prepared catalysts are relatively pure. Pt/C catalyst agglomerated seriously. With the addition of Au and Fe, the morphologies of the catalyst were changed and increased the specific surface area of the catalyst. PtAuFe/C composite catalyst is of more positive initial hydrogen evolution potential and higher current density. The reaction mechanism of Pt/C catalyst is probably Volmer Heyrovsky reaction, while PtAuFe/C composite catalyst is Volmer Tafel reaction. In addition, the PtAuFe/C composite catalyst has better stability. With the increase of the concentration of H2SO4, the initial potential of hydrogen evolution of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst shifted positively, the current density increased, and the hydrogen evolution performance is significantly improved. With the increase of temperature, the initial potential of PtAuFe/C composite catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction gradually moves positively, the over potential of hydrogen evolution gradually decreases, the current density gradually increases at the same potential, and the activity of hydrogen evolution continuously increases."
