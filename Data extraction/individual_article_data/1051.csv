0,Introduction,"The recycling of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) is one of the environmental challenges of the future. CFRP are composite materials composed of a polymeric matrix, normally a thermosetting resin, and carbon fibers, which act as reinforcing material. The global demand of carbon fiber (which is virtually employed only in CFRP) ranged approximately 85,000 tons in 2018 compared to 46,500 tons in 2013, being the aerospace/defense industry and the manufacturing of wind turbine blades the greatest consumers of this material. In second place are the automotive industry and the manufacture of sporting goods, remaining 25–30% of the market for various applications such as pressure vessels, civil engineering, pipe and tanks, marine, electrical & electronics and medical applications (Holmes, 2014; Mazumdar et al., 2019). All these market applications are expected to continue growing in the coming years, specially the automotive industry. In this case, the high strength-to-weight ratio given by the presence of the carbon fiber could be decisive to fulfill future requirements related to fuel consumption and carbon dioxide performance (Mazumdar et al., 2019; Reynolds and Pharaoh, 2010). However, there is an environmental issue related to the high quantities of CFRP waste that is generated in the manufacturing processes, together with the fact that nowadays there is not a clear industrial alternative to landfill or incineration (Liu et al., 2017; Vo Dong et al., 2017). Besides, the problem of waste CFRP management is supposed to be greater in the following years, given the emergence of CFRP-made end-of-life structures (Lefeuvre et al., 2017; Lichtenegger et al., 2020; Vo Dong et al., 2019). CFRP are expensive materials mainly due to the price of carbon fibers, which can be very costly depending on the quality requirements of the product or application (Hagnell and Åkermo, 2019; Vo Dong et al., 2018). Therefore, research concerning the treatment of CFRP waste is focused on the separation of the fibers and the polymeric resin with the aim of recovering and reuse the former ones. Up to now, four different treatment routes have been studied for CFRP waste: mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, pyrolysis and fluidized bed oxidation. Details about the advantages and drawbacks of each technique are extensively described in several review works published by scientific community (Oliveux et al., 2015; Pimenta and Pinho, 2014, 2011; Vo Dong et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2012). Among the abovementioned treatment processes, pyrolysis is the unique one that has been implemented at some industrial scale (e.g. ELG Carbon Fibre Ltd.), and recycled carbon fibers coming from pyrolysis are already being used in some industrial applications (Holmes, 2018; Nickels, 2020). This is why less energy is required to recover carbon fibers from waste than to produce a virgin carbon fiber (Khalil, 2018). Consequently, the cost of the fiber can be reduced around 40% when it is recycled (Holmes, 2017). When CFRP waste is pyrolyzed the thermosetting resin decomposes into char, gases and vapors, while carbon fibers, much more thermally stable, remain without significant change in properties (Black, 2017; Giorgini et al., 2015; Mazzocchetti et al., 2018). In this particular case a mild oxidation step is also needed after pyrolysis, in order to remove the char covering the fibers’ surface (Mazzocchetti et al., 2018; Onwudili et al., 2016). This pyrolysis-oxidation combined process allows the separation of resin and fibers, and the reclamation of the later ones. Apart from the carbon fibers, there is also the possibility of recovering the material value of the polymeric resin. However, this is something that is not currently practiced in the semi-industrial recycling processes, where the volatilized matter coming from the thermal decomposition of the resin (gases and vapors) are directly and merely burned. The literature related to CFRP pyrolysis show that the cooling of such volatilized matter produces condensed liquids in a great proportion (80–95 wt% of the volatilized matter) and, consequently, the remaining gas fraction is a secondary product in quantity (Cunliffe et al., 2003; López et al., 2013; Nahil and Williams, 2011; Onwudili et al., 2016). Besides, the condensed liquid is a two-phase mixture of organic substances solved in water and an oily fraction composed of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols and amines, and even sulphur and chlorinated compounds depending on the resin composition (López et al., 2013; Nahil and Williams, 2011; Yang et al., 2015). Such a complex liquid mixture does not allow the recovery of any chemical, neither its direct utilization as fuel. On the other hand, the gas fraction is mainly composed of methane, carbon monoxide and dioxide, hydrogen and light hydrocarbons in variable proportions depending also on the chemical nature of the polymeric matrix of the CFRP (Cunliffe et al., 2003; López et al., 2013; Nahil and Williams, 2011). Although this gaseous fraction may have some application, the usual practice in the industry is to burn the gases and condensable vapors all together, in order to avoid the generation of liquids. In this regard, the authors of the article think that not enough research has been done on this issue and therefore, they have been studying for some years the possibility of recovering value-added substances from the volatilized matter of the thermal decomposition of CFRP. In the work published so far, they have shown a novel method to upgrade the products coming from the polymeric resin decomposition while they remain in gas phase, that is, before condensation. The method is based on a high temperature treatment with the option of using catalysts if needed (Gastelu et al., 2019, 2018; Lopez-Urionabarrenechea et al., 2020). The employment of this method can generate a H2-rich gaseous product (greater than 50 vol%) and low quantities of aqueous liquids, since the organic phase of the liquids is virtually eliminated. At the same time, as usual after a process of pyrolysis and oxidation, carbon fibers with mechanical properties good enough to be commercialized are obtained (Lopez-Urionabarrenechea et al., 2020). In the above-mentioned published works, the cost that could suppose each of the different stages included in this method was not taken into account: the pyrolysis step, the treatment of gases and vapors (this treatment obviously implies an additional cost), and the oxidation step. For this reason, the aim of this article is to study some possibilities to reduce the material and energy consumption of each of those steps, while ensuring and maintaining the quality of the products obtained in the previous works. The ultimate goal is to propose an optimized whole recycling process for CFRP waste, where carbon fibers and other chemicals are recovered at the lowest cost."
1,Materials and methods,
2,CFRP waste,"2.1 CFRP waste The sample used in the experiments is an expired pre-preg coming from manufacturing activities of the aeronautical industry. Specifically, it is a composite material of M21 epoxy resin (Hexcel) and T800S unidirectional carbon fibers (Toray) in a proportion of 34 and 66 wt%, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of this CFRP waste have been reported and thoroughly discussed elsewhere by the authors (Gastelu et al., 2019). Anyway, some of the characterization results can be seen in Table 3, when comparing the initial sample with the pyrolyzed solids."
3,Pyrolysis-oxidation installation and experiments,"2.2 Pyrolysis-oxidation installation and experiments The experiments are carried out in a lab-scale installation that consists of two reactors connected in series and a section for vapor condensation and gas cleaning and it has been carefully explained elsewhere (Lopez-Urionabarrenechea et al., 2020). The first reactor is a 3.5 L stainless steel tank reactor that works in semi-continuous regime; that is, there is a batch load of sample but the products coming from the thermal decomposition of the sample are continuously leaving the reactor. In each experiment 100 g of waste CFRP are introduced in the form of a single sheet of 1125 mm (length) × 50 mm (width), and is heating up to 500 °C at 3 °C min−1. The matter leaving the tank reactor reaches the second reactor, which is a stainless steel tubular reactor (50 cm long, 2.54 cm diameter and filled with a solid bed material). In this reactor, the products coming from the tank reactor are subjected to 900 °C in order to cause conditions in which severe cracking occurs. Both reactors are externally heated by electric furnaces. The outflow gas and vapors from the tubular reactor are cooled by passing through three atmospheric pressure condensers (one of them air-cooled and the two others water-cooled). In the condensers, the condensable vapors are collected as liquids, while the non-condensable gases are cleaned in an activated carbon column before collecting in gas sampling bags. When pyrolysis step is finished, air is fed to the first reactor in order to remove the char covering the fibers. There is no device to modify the pressure at any point in the installation. That is, the reactors are not pressurized or closed at any time during the experiments, and no pump is used to draw fluids into the gas bags. The fluids move through the installation aided by the flow of carrier gas in the experiments where it is used or simply by thermal effect when no carrier gas is present. The volumetric flow in the second reactor is not constant by definition, because the experiments take place at batch mode. That is, the volumetric flow in the second reactor depends on the rate of decomposition of the sample in the first reactor. When sample starts decomposition, few vapors and gases are produced, while in the temperature range where the degradation is higher, high quantities of gases and vapors are generated and thus, they pass through the second reactor faster. Although the volumetric flow is “more constant” when N2 flowrate is used (around the flowrate of N2 used), strictly, it continues being not constant due to the same reason. The flowsheet of the pyrolysis set-up is presented in Fig. 1 . As mentioned before, the authors' previous experience has allowed them to identify three key operating variables that will remain constant in this work: pyrolysis temperature, 500 °C; CFRP sample heating rate, 3 °C min−1; gases and vapor’s treatment temperature, 900 °C. These three parameters ensure that carbon fibers are obtained in good condition and that the thermal treatment of the volatilized matter generates useful products (Gastelu et al., 2019, 2018; Lopez-Urionabarrenechea et al., 2020). Now, the following operating conditions will be studied in this work: the material employed as solid bed in the tubular reactor, the employment of N2 to generate the pyrolysis inert atmosphere, the dwell time maintained at the pyrolysis final temperature, the oxidation temperature and the oxidation time. The experimental conditions with regard to the pyrolysis step are summarized in Table 1 as E1-E5 experiments. In order to optimize the oxidation temperature and time, the theory of experiments based on 2 k factorial design was used (Montgomery, 2019). Following the factorial design, the oxidation temperature was identified as the variable x1, the oxidation time as the variable x2 and the response variable (result to be achieved) was the weight of remaining solid with respect to the initial CFRP quantity (which would have to correspond to the carbon fiber content of the CFRP). It must be taken into consideration that the employment of such approach implies some assumptions concerning linear dependence between variables under study (being temperature-conversion the most important one) and this could have an impact on the results and the derived conclusions. The experimental domain established for x1 and x2 variables were 500–600 °C and 30–120 min respectively. Both experimental domains were defined based on work published in literature related to CFRP waste thermal treatment (López et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2009; Nahil and Williams, 2011; Yang et al., 2015), being specially careful with selecting a not very broad temperature domain As in this particular case k = 2 (temperature and time), it is enough to perform 4 experiments (22) to determine the optimum oxidation conditions. Additionally, an experiment was performed in the center of the experimental domains to give robustness to the optimization. With all this, the experiments carried out in the oxidation step can be seen in Table 1 (O1-O5). As advised by the factorial design theory, these experiments were carried out at random. Finally, the value of x1 and x2 variables together with the obtained experimental values for the response were adjusted through a multi-variant linear regression method using MathWorks software, obtaining the equation that defines the relationship of temperature and oxidation time with the desired target result (66 wt%, the percentage of carbon fibers in the composite)."
4,Solid bed materials,"2.3 Solid bed materials Two solid bed materials were used as fillers in the tubular reactor: silicon carbide (SiC) and a high alumina refractory material of composition 50–65% Al2O3, 30–40% SiO2, 1–2% Fe2O3, 0.5–1.5% Na2O + K2O in weight, both of them presenting similar heat capacities (0.7–1.2 kJ kg−1 K−1) and 0.5–1 mm particle size. SiC was provided by NavarroSiC S.A., while the high alumina refractory material was obtained from defective bricks supplied by Beroa S.L., i.e., it is a waste material from the ceramic industry. The role of these fillers is to improve the dynamics of the gases and vapors through the tubular reactor (homogeneous spatial distribution along the reactor and velocity) and at the same time, to transport the heat along it in an efficient way. Previous works by the authors have already proved the effectiveness of the use of filler materials in the tubular reactor (Gastelu et al., 2019, 2018). These materials can be effectively reused after a cleaning operation consisted in heating in air at 500 °C during 4 h. This article compares the effect of both fillers with the intention of replacing SiC (an expensive product) by a new filler material obtained by grinding residual bricks coming from the production process of refractories. Additionally, high alumina refractory materials like the used in this work present very low thermal conductivity (0.3–0.5 W m−1 K−1) compared to SiC (41–90 W m−1 K−1), so, the effect of such property will be also evaluated."
5,Analytical techniques,"2.4 Analytical techniques The ultimate analysis of CFRP waste and pyrolysis solids was performed with the LECO TrueSpec CHN and TrueSpec S automatic analyzers. These solid samples were also characterized through proximate analysis, using the LECO TGA-701 thermobalance and following ASTM D3173-85 and D3174-82 standards. Finally, the thermogravimetric behavior of CFRP waste was determined through a dynamic thermogravimetric test carried out on the Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851 thermobalance. This test consisted in heating the sample from room temperature to 1000 °C at 10 °C min−1 using a 50 mL min−1 flow of N2. The composition of the condensed liquids was determined by gas chromatography (AGILENT 6890) coupled to a mass spectrometry detector (AGILENT 5973) and equipped with an AGILENT 123–3262 column. The substances identified by the detector’s software library were considered right when the mass spectrum coincidence parameter was greater than 85%. When this value was lower, the corresponding chemical was classified as “unidentified”. Since pyrolysis liquids can be composed of many different substances, their composition was given in area % and they were classified by families where necessary. In general, chemical compounds with an area percentage<3 were usually classified in a group called “others”. The composition of the pyrolysis gases was determined by gas chromatography (AGILENT 7890A) coupled to thermal conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization (FID) detectors. This chromatograph was equipped with a molecular sieve (HP-MOLESIEVE) in order to separate the so-called permanent gases (H2, CO, CH4) and an HP-PLOT Q column for the separation of CO2 and hydrocarbons from C2 to C6. Standard gas cylinders certified by Air Liquide S.A. were used to calibrate the chromatograph. These consisted of mixtures of C1-C6 alkanes, C2-C6 alkenes, H2, CO and CO2. Gas composition was calculated in volume and mass percentages, since the mass composition is better for discussion concerning material balances but the volume composition shows in a better way the potential applications of the pyrolysis gases. Such compositions are given in water-free basis (the gas is expected to be saturated after condensation). Nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur containing gaseous compounds were not detected in the gases by using colorimetric adsorbent tubes, but it is possible that some substance of this type is part of the gaseous fraction, given the composition of the CFRP sample. The higher heating value (HHV) of the pyrolysis gases was calculated based on the composition of the gas and the HHV of the pure constituent substances. Finally, the morphology of the reclaimed carbon fibers was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), specifically by using the JEOL JSM-6400 microscope belonging to the general analysis services of the University of the Basque Country (SGIker). An accelerating voltage of 20 kV was used, mainly employing the secondary electron detector. The samples were analyzed at 1000, 2500 and 10,000 magnifications."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Pyrolysis step,"3.1 Pyrolysis step Table 2 shows the results obtained in the experiments carried out to study the operating variables of the pyrolysis step. This table includes pyrolysis yields, gas composition and liquid composition, since it is convenient to have all this information grouped together to discuss the effect of the modification of the different variables. The values shown in the table are the averages of at least three tests where the pyrolysis yields do not differ by more than 3 percentage points. The yield of condensed products, called “total condensates” in Table 2, has been classified into “collected liquids”, which are the liquids collected in the condensers and later analyzed, and condensates found in reactors, pipes and the activated carbon column, which cannot recover from the installation and consequently cannot be analyzed. For this reason, the discussion will focus on “collected liquids”. The E1 experiment is a standard test where pyrolysis took place in presence of 1 L N2 min−1, pyrolysis final temperature is 500 °C, reached at 3 °C min−1 and maintained for 30 min. The vapors and gases thermal treatment takes place at 900 °C in the presence of SiC solid bed. In light of the results, it can be said that on the one hand, the pyrolysis solid was the main product of the process, containing the carbon fibers along with char and probably remnants of undecomposed polymeric resin (Gastelu et al., 2018). On the other hand, there were the pyrolysis liquids and gases, which come from the decomposition of the polymeric resin into vapors and gases, to whom the thermal treatment method was applied. The use of this treatment generates a greater amount of pyrolysis gas to the detriment of liquid production, as can be concluded if these results are compared with epoxy-based CFRP pyrolysis work carried out by other researchers and also with that published by the authors, (Cunliffe et al., 2003; Gastelu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015). Additionally, this method also improves the composition of the gases, decreasing the proportion of carbon oxides and greatly increasing that of H2 compared to the typical gas fractions obtained in epoxy CFRP pyrolysis (Cunliffe et al., 2003; Gastelu et al., 2019; Giorgini et al., 2015). As far as the composition of pyrolysis liquids is concerned, they consisted of a complex mixture of organic substances, as has been reported by other authors (Giorgini et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015). However, it should be taken into account that pyrolysis liquids were generated in very small quantities thanks to the use of the gas and vapor treatment method (0.4 wt% of collected liquids and 12.5 wt% of total condensates), minimizing the environmental and security issues that could arise from them. Column E2 presents the results obtained when the solid bed of the tubular reactor was made up of residual refractory material instead of the SiC employed in E1. This change was driven by the quest to make the treatment cheaper and was based on the authors' previous positive experience in the treatment of gases and vapors from the thermal decomposition of a poly(benzoxazine)-type waste CFRP (Lopez-Urionabarrenechea et al., 2020). As can be seen, there were no major changes in pyrolysis yields but they did occur in the gas and liquid composition. There was a considerable increase of hydrogen to the detriment of organic substances in gas and liquid phases. In fact, the composition of the liquid phase was greatly simplified and contained a significant proportion of water, as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitrogenous and oxygenated aromatic compounds disappeared, as observed in Table 2. The refractory material was subjected to some typical catalytic activity analyses in a previous work carried out by the authors. Specifically, such analyses were the porosity and surface area determination, temperature-programmed reduction, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and CO-chemisorption (Lopez-Urionabarrenechea et al., 2020). The obtained results showed that the refractory did not have any catalytic activity related to the presence of porosity, acidity or active metals in the surface, so the only possibility was the direct interaction between the substances in the reaction media and the metal oxides it contains. However, in view of the differences between the thermal conductivities of the two materials (see section 2.3), the most plausible hypothesis about the effect of this solid bed material must be that it maintains the temperature of the reactor more efficiently than SiC, minimizing heat losses and maximizing thermal cracking reactions of the organic compounds coming from the CFRP decomposition. In other words, the authors think that the thermal role of the solid bed is more important than the catalytic one and that the better heat distribution along the tubular reactor makes the proportion of light hydrocarbons and H2 in gases and water in liquids increase. This is a very interesting result since this material, and in general those belonging to the refractory family, is perfectly characterized by its manufacturers, and they origin and suppliers can be easily traced. Moreover, this material can come from reusing defective bricks, as is the case of this work. Column E3 shows the results obtained in a pyrolysis test carried out under the same conditions as experiment E2 but without using dwell time, i.e., an experiment where cooling began as soon as 500 °C were reached in the pyrolysis reactor. It can be clearly seen that there was hardly any variation in any of the results obtained, neither in yields nor in gas and liquid composition. This is a very interesting outcome, as it means reducing the work time of the two reactors (at 500 °C and 900 °C respectively) for 30 min without impairing the efficiency of gas and vapor treatment method. It will be discussed later on whether the elimination of the dwell time has any effect on the obtained pyrolyzed solid (section 3.2). Apart from energetic costs, one of the highest operation costs of a pyrolysis process is the consumption of inert gas, in this case N2, needed to remove the air of the reactors and, if necessary, to carry the gases and vapors through the installation. Therefore, the influence of the use of inert gas in the treatment of gases and vapors from the decomposition of the polymeric resin was studied in experiments E4 and E5. The aim of these experiments was to evaluate whether this method could be applied without inert gas circulation, in which case the operation costs would be greatly reduced. In the E4 experiment, N2 was used only to purge the reactors and installation before starting the process. That is, once the air was removed, the process was started without feeding additional N2. As far as yields are concerned, it can be seen that the absence of N2 flow generates a slightly higher yield in solids and condensates, making gas production lower than in the case of experiment E3, where N2 flow was used. However, the most noteworthy effect is the distribution of the condensed products throughout the installation. In the E4 experiment, a greater quantity of “collected liquids” and “condensates in reactors” was obtained than in E3, reducing the presence of condensates in the pipelines and especially in the activated carbon column. The explanation could lie on the fact that in the absence of N2 the gases and vapors from the thermal decomposition of the polymeric resin move through the reactors only by thermal effect, making their circulation through the installation much slower. Consequently, their residence time increases, both in the reactors and in the condensers. On the one hand, this means longer time to react at high temperature in the reactors. Under these conditions, the conversion of the cracking reactions of organic compounds is increased and coke may be generated, which could be deposited in the reactors. Re-polymerization reactions among cracked substances can also take place, generating chemicals of high molecular weight, which may finally remain impregnating the reactors and even the pyrolysis solid. On the other hand, more residence time in the condensers means condensation of substances that are usually swept to the activated carbon column when N2 flow is used. The composition of pyrolysis gases and liquids is largely affected by the absence of N2. The gases generated in experiment E4, compared to those of E3 (mass composition), had a significantly higher amount of H2 and CO, accompanied by a relevant reduction of CO2 and organic substances both in the gases and liquids. The high production of H2 could be the result of two different reaction routes: cracking reactions of organic substances and dry reforming of hydrocarbons, the latter explaining at the same time the important shift between CO2 and CO. In this sense, it should be mentioned that the direct reaction of aniline with CO2 is quite complicated, so in this case it is likely that first the aniline molecule was cracked, resulting in NH3 and hydrocarbons. The longer residence time in the reactors would explain the cracking of the aniline that was not observed in experiment E3, where it was not enough time at high temperature to take place. The removal of aniline from the liquid fraction in E4 means that such fraction is almost entirely composed of water, which allows being optimistic about its utilization or, at worst, its management as a process waste. This additional water could have been formed by combining existing CO2 and the H2 generated in the abovementioned reactions through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which would also produce some additional CO. This reverse reaction could be favored by the high temperatures of the treatment, since the reaction is endothermic in that direction. Ultimately, a gas fraction with more than 75% in volume of H2 is produced, being composed almost exclusively of H2, CO and CH4. This is one of the most important results of this research, since it was possible to generate a gas that could be a source of H2 or syngas in the same process where carbon fibers are reclaimed, and all this without the use of N2 flow. In terms of material recovery, half of the hydrogen of the polymeric resin is recovered in the form of H2. In the last experiment (E5), N2 was not even used to inert the reaction medium. That is, the pyrolysis process was started with the naturally present air inside the reactors. Taking into account the volume of the tank reactor (3.5 L), the ratio of 'initial amount of O2 in the reactor/mass of material susceptible to be decomposed' was 0.735 L / 34 g, that is, 0.022. This air was displaced as the gases and vapors of the process were generated. Under these conditions it is not a strictly pyrolysis process, but there are previous experiences of slightly oxidative treatments for the recovery of carbon fibers both at research and industrial level (Holmes, 2018; Yang et al., 2015). As it can be seen in Table 4 , differences between the results of E4 and E5 are not significant. Maybe the slight increase in oxygenated substances such as CO, CO2 and oxygenated aromatic compounds in E5 could be attributed to the presence of air at the beginning of the reaction, but even so, these are not differences to be considered relevant. In fact, small amounts of aniline and other nitrogenous aromatic compounds are also observed in the liquid fraction, but such small values could enter even into the experimental variability of the process itself (see standard deviations). It is plausible that by using smaller amount of sample in the reactor, i.e. a higher O2/sample ratio, the degree of decomposition of the polymeric resin would have been higher. The reason for not modifying the amount of sample lies on allowing the comparison with the rest of the experiments (mass and energy transfer issues). Additionally, it should also be noted that the objective of the first stage of the experiment is not to burn the resin, but to decompose it into products of interest such as H2. Therefore, no attempt should be made to feed or provide an amount of oxygen that will generate combustion. The idea of this experiment is simply avoiding the employment of nitrogen gas in order to save its cost, but not with the intention of forcing combustion. As far as the elemental balances are concerned, it must be said that these balances are affected by some by-products of the process that cannot be characterized, i.e., all those products that are stuck in the reactors and pipelines. This supposes a loss of carbon (mainly) and lower loss of hydrogen and oxygen. On the other hand, it should be taken into account that oxygenated organic compounds, as well as sulphur and nitrogen gaseous species cannot be determined by the chromatography system used in this work, so it is possible that the proportions of the gaseous compounds shown in Table 2 are slightly overestimated. The authors think that the quantity of such not determined gaseous species should be very low because such compounds have been sought without success by using colorimetric adsorbent tubes. Nevertheless, future work will include renewed efforts to detect and identify gaseous species different from such of Table 2. Anyway, the results obtained in the last two experiments are very relevant, even more in the last one taking into account that in this case N2 is not used in the whole process. In short, in view of the experiments carried out, it can be concluded that it is possible to obtain a gaseous fraction with a high percentage of hydrogen through a thermal treatment process without consumption of N2 and using a residual material as filler. At the same time, a liquid product composed mainly of water is generated. Now, the future approach would consist on separating the H2 from the gases by pressure swing adsorption (PSA). This would generate high purity H2, which could be sold as a chemical, and a gaseous by-product still retaining a relevant calorific value (≈20 MJ/kg) to be used to partially supply the energy consumption of the furnaces. It is evident that, comparing to the normal pyrolysis process (only one reactor and gases with somewhat higher calorific value), the energetic performance of a two-reactor process must be lower. However, preliminary calculations made by the authors and based on laboratory-scale costs show that the additional energy consumption derived from treating the gases and vapors is perfectly acceptable for the price at which the recovered fibers (mainly) and high purity H2 could be sold. In addition, it should be taken into account that, by this procedure, the polymeric resin is materially valorized in the form of H2, which is a priority solution compared to the combustion of the entire gaseous fraction."
8,Pyrolysis solids and carbon fiber reclamation,"3.2 Pyrolysis solids and carbon fiber reclamation Table 3 presents the results of the proximate and ultimate analyses of the pyrolysis solids. Only the data from the four experiments where the operating variables of the pyrolysis reactor were different are presented, i.e. those that can influence the pyrolysis solid. Additionally, the proximate and ultimate analyses of the waste CFRP have been included, in order to compare the initial and final solid samples of the pyrolysis step. As can be seen in the results of the proximate analysis related to the pyrolyzed solid obtained in the E2 experiment, the pyrolysis process makes the initial CFRP lose a large part of its volatile matter (from 29.7 to 6.0 wt%), remaining mostly made up of fixed carbon. This fixed carbon represents mainly the carbon fibers but also the carbonized product from the decomposition of the polymeric resin (char). Such loose of volatile matter has also influence in the ultimate analysis, which shows that the pyrolysis solid is mainly composed of carbon. Apart from that, it is also remarkable the relatively high percentage of nitrogen, as is usual when working with CFRP whose carbon fibers have been produced from poly(acrylonitrile) (Gastelu et al., 2019, 2018). The percentage of “others” probably corresponds to oxygen, as reported by other authors (López et al., 2013). The results obtained in the chemical characterization of the pyrolysis solid obtained in the E2 experiment are practically the same as those of the pyrolysis solid from experiment E3, in which the dwell time was 0 min. Therefore, it can be concluded that as far as proximate and ultimate analyses are concerned, once 500 °C have been reached, the dwell time has no influence on the pyrolysis solid. As regards the experiments where nitrogen flow effect was studied (E4 & E5), no significant differences were found either. Maybe a greater carbonization can be observed given the higher percentage of carbon and the lower of “others” obtained in the ultimate analysis, but the difference is not enough to conclude that this was happened. These results are consistent with those obtained by the authors in a paper studying the influence of nitrogen flow on the performance of a catalyst. In that case, no significant influence of the N2 flow on the pyrolysis solid was observed either (Gastelu et al., 2019). The pyrolysis solid obtained in the E5 experiment was selected as the sample to study the mild oxidation process. In other words, the aim was to determine the optimum conditions for the recovery of carbon fibers from the solid generated in the experiment where the best results (and in the most economical way) were obtained concerning the treatment of gases and vapors. As can be seen in Table 2, the yield in solids in test E5 was 79.9 wt%, while the carbon fiber content of the initial CFRP is 66 wt% (see Materials and Methods section). Therefore, it is easy to conclude that the pyrolysis solid still contains almost 14 wt% of matter that is not carbon fiber. Bearing in mind that 100 g of CFRP waste were introduced in the experiment, 14 g of carbonaceous product must be removed through oxidation. This carbonaceous product was considered as 100% pure carbon in order to simplify the stoichiometric air calculation. Above this amount, 55% of excess air was fed. The selection of 55% excess air was based on preliminary experiments carried out by the authors by studying the oxidation of small pieces of pyrolyzed CFRP in a tubular furnace (under more controlled conditions than those found in the tank reactor). In such conditions, the optimum excess amount was found to be 40%. Then, we added 15% more when using the tank reactor in order to overcome gas–solid contact issues and to eliminate the other carbonaceous residues remaining in both, the tank and the tubular reactor. This calculation was made based on the “condensates in reactors” value (see Table 2), taking the consideration that they were composed of 100% C. The calculations made are shown in equations (1) and (2). In order to introduce the same air amount in every experiment, air was fed at different rates depending on the oxidation step duration.

The table includes the airflow used in each test. This time, only one experiment was carried out for each experimental condition, due to low sample availability. Taking into account that the carbon fiber content in the CFRP sample is 66 wt% and in view of the results in Table 4, it can be concluded that long oxidation times were required to completely remove the carbonaceous product (or even resin residues if present). In all the cases where the oxidation time was shorter than 120 min, the amount of remaining solid was quite far from the target, even at 600 °C. This results can be attributed to the short residence time of the air in the reactor due to the high volumetric flow rate used. This implies a short contact time between air and residue, which is not even compensated by the increase in reaction kinetics derived from using 600 °C of temperature. On the other hand, when the oxidation was carried out during 120 min at this temperature, part of the carbon fibers was also oxidized, since the quantity of remaining solid was smaller than their percentage in CFRP (59.1 vs 66 wt%). In this case, the solid–gas contact is greatly improved by the lower volumetric flow rate, but, under these conditions, the temperature of 600 °C seems to be excessive and the acceleration of the reaction kinetics involves the elimination of carbonaceous residues and also the oxidation of some carbon fibers. This matches with some results previously published in the literature, which indicate that at 600 °C the oxidation of carbon fibers in contact with air begins (Meyer et al., 2009). Consequently, the best result was obtained when the oxidation step was carried out at 500 °C for 120 min, giving a percentage of remaining solid very closed to the one that was being looked for (68.2 vs 66 wt%). This result could even be considered valid, but taking into account that the aim of this study was to achieve the optimized operating conditions, more work was carried out. This way, the results shown in Table 4 were fed into a multi-variant linear regression model in Mathworks to obtain the corresponding response surface, which results from graphically representing the relationship between the operating variables (temperature and time) and the result obtained, in this case the amount of remaining solid is expressed in wt.%. This plane was cut with the one defined by the objective to be achieved, in this case, 66 wt% (carbon fiber content in the CFRP). The representation of both surfaces is shown in Fig. 2 and the equation that defines their intersection is the equation (3), where x1 is oxidation temperature and x2 is oxidation time. (3) 66 = 69 , 44 - 3 , 375 x 1 - 4 , 475 x 2 - 1 , 175 x 1 x 2 Once the equation was defined, the mathematical values of the oxidation time required to obtain the 66 wt% of remaining solid at both temperatures, 500 °C and 600 °C, were calculated. In principle, the objective was to find the optimum oxidation time corresponding to 500 °C, since, on the one hand, it is the temperature with the lowest energy cost and, on the other hand, it is convenient to carry out the oxidation process at the lowest possible temperature to avoid damage to the fibers. However, it was decided to calculate and test the oxidation time corresponding to 600 °C in case a proper oxidation at 500 °C was not achieved. To calculate the theoretical oxidation times at both temperatures, the value of −1 (500 °C) or + 1 (600 °C) was entered into equation (3) as x1 and the value of x2 was obtained. This way, x2≈2 when x1 = -1 and x2≈0 when x1=+1, which means t = 165 min at T = 500 °C and t = 75 min at T = 600 °C, respectively. Therefore, these two experiments were performed and the results are presented in Table 5 . As can be seen, the oxidation efficiency achieved at 500 °C for 165 min was excellent and it practically corresponded to the amount of carbon fiber present in this CFRP. This highlights the good quality of the prediction made by the mathematical model. The efficiency obtained in the oxidation at 600 °C was not so close to the theoretical value, but it could also be considered enough. In any case, these results corroborate the experimental observation made in view of the results in Table 4. That is, the oxidation time has a greater influence than the temperature on the remaining solid yield. This was also pointed out by equation (3), where it can be seen that the coefficient accompanying the variable x2 (time) is greater than that accompanying the variable x1 (temperature), which means that the influence of x2 in the process is greater than that of x1 (4.475 vs 3.375). Fig. 3 shows a photograph and some SEM micrographs of the carbon fibers recovered in the optimum conditions (T = 500 °C, t = 165 min) at different magnifications. In the photograph in Fig. 3, it can be seen that the carbon fibers leaving the reactor once pyrolyzed and oxidized retain the unidirectional organization of the original pre-preg, being easily separated by hand to obtain loose fibers. At first glance with visual analysis, they are clean fibers that contain neither polymeric resin nor char. In the micrographs obtained by SEM, however, small traces of some substance different from carbon fibers can be seen, but no damage is appreciated. In any case, taking into account that the weight of the solid obtained after oxidation matches almost fully the carbon fiber content of the CFRP (Table 5), it can be said that these are predominantly clean carbon fibers. Further research would be needed to determine possible fiber degradation and the adhesion properties of these carbon fibers with new polymeric resins but this is beyond the scope of the current work."
9,Conclusion,"In this work, it has been demonstrated that the material value of an epoxy-type polymeric resin can be recovered in the process of carbon fiber reclamation from CFRP by pyrolysis. Specifically, a gas very rich in H2 can be obtained while generating a low quantity of non-complex aqueous liquids. For this to be possible, it is necessary to apply a thermal treatment to the gases and vapors that are released from the thermal decomposition of the resin. Such treatment must be carried out in a tubular reactor at 900 °C and filled with a solid bed material. When a high alumina refractory material is used as filler, better results are obtained than using conventional SiC. This refractory material can be defective bricks from the production of ceramics, so the material cost of the process decreases considerably. In addition, it is a material perfectly characterized by its manufacturers, whose origin and suppliers can be easily traced. At last, it can be reused just after a thermal cleaning process. The results obtained show that it is not necessary to maintain the final pyrolysis temperature during any dwell time to obtain products of equal quality. On the other hand, the best products are obtained when N2 is not used as carrier gas and even when it is not used either initially for removing the air inside the reactor. In these last two cases, a gaseous fraction with 75% by volume of H2 is produced, which means that half of the hydrogen contained in the polymeric resin is recovered in a form that has many valorization possibilities (source of hydrogen, chemical synthesis, syngas, etc.). All this, moreover, in a process where N2 gas is not consumed. None of these process modifications affects the reclamation of the carbon fibers. They remain being part of the pyrolysis solid, which does not undergo any appreciable change in its proximate and ultimate analyses. Therefore, together with the 75% H2 gas, the carbon fibers can be recovered through a mild oxidation step. This step has been optimized to achieve the maximum removal of char and resin remnants with the lowest energy cost, achieving the recovery of clean fibers by oxidizing at 500 °C for 165 min feeding an airflow of 1.27 L min−1. The resulting fibers are easily loosened, do not contain significant char or resin deposits and do not show any appreciable damage under the SEM microscope."
