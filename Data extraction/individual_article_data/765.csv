0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols, in other words long-chain alcohols, such as octyl, cetyl, and stearyl alcohols are industrially important intermediates for surfactants or plasticizers, and roughly 3milliontons of higher alcohols are produced annually throughout the world [1]. Currently, higher alcohols are produced by the hydrogenation of esters obtained by the ester-exchange reaction between fats and methanol (methanolysis) or by the hydrogenation of fatty acids obtained by hydrolysis of fats [2]. In the case of octyl alcohol (2-ethyl hexanol), the hydroformylation–aldol condensation–hydrogenation method is the main production process [3]. In the hydrogenation of the esters or acids, a Cu–Cr-based Adkins catalyst is typically used under very severe reaction conditions at 250–350°C and approximately 10–20MPa [2,4,5]. This catalyst system results in a high alcohol yield. However, the use of Cr and severe reaction conditions are problematic from environmental and energetic viewpoints, and catalysts not containing Cr and effective under mild reaction conditions are therefore needed. Hydrogenation of ester to synthesize alcohol has been studied in both homogeneous [6] and heterogeneous systems. In particular, heterogeneous catalysts have been studied widely with regard to obtaining higher alcohols [7–11]. Many of these catalysts are based on noble metals such as Ru, Pd, and rarely Rh. For example, Deshpande et al. studied the hydrogenation of methyl hexadecanoate (methyl palmitate) on supported Ru–B catalysts [7]. Pouilloux et al. investigated the hydrogenation of methyl oleate into oleyl alcohol on Ru–Sn/Al2O3 and Ru–Ti/Al2O3 catalysts [8,9]. Similar catalysts have also been studied for the hydrogenation of adipic acid [12] and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid [13]. However, the effects of the support and reaction mechanism, and especially the by-product formation route, have not been systematically studied. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated the formation of higher alcohols by the hydrogenation of methyl laurate or methyl palmitate, paying special attention to these points."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts As catalyst supports, α-Al2O3 (Norton Corp.; 4.5m2 g−1), γ-Al2O3 (Reference support of Japan Catalyst Society; JRC-ALO-1 135m2 g−1 and Sumitomo Chemical; KHA 155m2 g−1 and KHD 270m2 g−1) and ZrO2 (Norton Corp.) were used after grinding and sieving to particles smaller than 100mesh. Catalysts were prepared by the conventional impregnation method. Typically, 0.140g of RuCl3 (N.E. Chemcat Corp.) and 0.129g of SnCl2·2H2O (Wako Pure Chemicals Corp.) were placed into a glass flask, and distilled water was added to dissolve the salts. Here, the desired amount of a support was added, and the mixture was dried at 70°C using a rotary evaporator at 200hPa. The thus obtained catalyst precursor was reduced at 350°C for 1h under pure hydrogen flow of 100cm3 min−1. The loadings of Ru and Sn were both 5wt% as metal."
3,Characterization of catalyst,"2.2 Characterization of catalyst The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (JEOL, JDX-3530) using Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 20mA. The surface areas of the supports were measured by a typical isothermal nitrogen adsorption–desorption method (Nihon Bel Corp., BELSORP BEL-mini II). CO-adsorption was measured by the pulse method. A 0.10g portion of catalyst was pretreated in situ at 200°C for 30min. The temperature was then decreased to room temperature, and 8.31μmol of CO was pulsed every 2min. The effluent was analyzed by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector."
4,Hydrogenation of esters and analysis of products,"2.3 Hydrogenation of esters and analysis of products Typically, 0.18mole of methyl laurate or methyl palmitate was introduced into a 200cm3 stainless steel autoclave (Taiatsu Techno Co., Japan). Here, the catalyst was added to give 2–5wt% of the substrate. No solvent was used. After purging the autoclave three times with nitrogen, the autoclave was pressurized with hydrogen to 6.0MPa. The temperature was then increased to 300°C and kept at this temperature for 10min to 16h without any supply of hydrogen. The stirring rate was adjusted to 1000rpm to circumvent the diffusional limitations of the hydrogen. The initial hydrogen pressure was estimated to be close to 9MPa at 300°C. After the reaction, the heater was removed and the temperature decreased rapidly. Gaseous products were collected into a gas reservoir and analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Porapak Type Q and Molecular Sieve 13 X packed in glass columns (I.D. 3.2mm and length 2.0m) were used. An internal standard (methyl stearate for hydrogenation of methyl palmitate and benzyl alcohol for hydrogenation of methyl laurate) was added to the liquid remaining in the autoclave, and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector. A capillary column (BP21(polar), SGE Corp., length 25m, I.D. 0.25mm and Film thickness 0.25μm) was adopted to analyze the esters, alcohols, acids, and higher hydrocarbons. The material balance based on carbon (C12 or C16 unit) was 100±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Hydrogenation of methyl laurate,"3.1 Hydrogenation of methyl laurate The results regarding hydrogenation of methyl laurate are shown in Table 1 . When a single component catalyst, 5%Ru/α-Al2O3, was used, dodecane was the major product and only a minor amount of lauryl alcohol was obtained. This result suggests that over-hydrogenation occurred on this catalyst. In contrast, when a binary catalyst, 5%Ru–5%Sn/α-Al2O3, was used, the lauryl alcohol selectivity improved greatly. However, formation of a large amount of lauryl laurate was also observed. The effect of Sn addition on hydrogenation of esters has been reported by many researchers [2,7,8] and our result, better alcohol selectivity, is in line with those reports. The influence of Sn addition on catalytic activity has been discussed, and both enhancement [14] and depression [7] have been reported. In our case, as the conversion was increased by Sn addition, the reaction was promoted, possibly due to the proper Ru/Sn mole ratio. As the addition of Sn improved the lauryl alcohol selectivity, other elements of various electronegativities were combined with Ru, and these results are also shown in Table 1. Although combination with Zn and Co accelerated the reaction, no formation of alcohol was observed. In the case of Cu, both the conversion and the alcohol selectivity decreased. Instead, lauric acid was obtained as a major product. Generally speaking, hydrogenation of carboxylic acid is more difficult than that of the corresponding ester. It is therefore not conceivable that ester hydrogenation proceeded through carboxylic acid (lauric acid) formation. If RCO2CH3 +H2 →RCOOH+CH4 occurs [8], direct formation of lauric acid might be explained. However, as we did not observe such a stoichiometric formation of methane, this route is questionable. At this moment, we do not have a suitable explanation for the production of a major amount of lauric acid. As Sn was the only element showing a favorable effect, all the following experiments were conducted with Sn as the second element. Table 2 shows the influence of the Ru/Sn mole ratio with constant loading of Sn. As the loading of Ru increased (meaning a higher Ru/Sn mole ratio), an increase in the conversion was observed with every catalyst. However, the product selectivity was not influenced, with only a slight increase being observed in the alcohol selectivity. As the second element, Sn was the most favorable, and the major catalyst, Ru, was then changed to other noble metals (Table 3 ). Here, the mole ratio of noble metal to Sn was unity. As indicated in Table 3, Rh–Sn catalyst gave the highest conversion and lauryl alcohol selectivity. Pt–Sn and Ir–Sn catalysts followed, and Pd–Sn showed exceptionally low performance. It is noteworthy that Rh- and Pt-based catalysts showed very high performance for hydrogenation of an ester composed of long-chain carboxylic acid. Rarely, hydrogenation of ethyl acetate to ethanol on Rh–Sn/SiO2 is reported by Ferretti et al. [15]. To obtain information regarding the structures of the catalysts, XRD was measured (Fig. 1 ). Three catalysts, Rh–Sn, Ir–Sn, and Ru–Sn, afforded no distinct peaks except those for the γ-Al2O3 support. In contrast, the XRD pattern of the Pt–Sn catalyst revealed the formation of a Pt–Sn intermetallic compound. As the peaks are very sharp, the particle size of this intermetallic compound would be large compared to those of Rh–, Ir– and Ru–Sn catalysts. This large particle size suggests to us that the Pt–Sn catalyst would have low catalytic activity because of its low surface area active for the reaction. As stated above, this is not the case for Pt–Sn, and further study of this point is needed. The influence of the mole ratio of Rh to Sn with the constant loading of Sn was studied, and the results are shown in Table 4 . The highest performance was obtained when the ratio was unity, and both lower and higher ratios gave inferior results. The result with Rh/Sn=1 was reproduced by the repeated experiment using catalyst from the same lot (not shown). It therefore seems that the mole ratio of unity has some significance, perhaps related to the conformation of the adsorbed ester or an electronic influence such as an ensemble effect or a ligand effect. There has been much discussion of binary catalysts for hydrogenation or oxidation [16,17], but until now no clear conclusions have been drawn. The adsorption of CO on catalysts reported in Table 4 was studied in order to clarify whether a free noble metal might exist without any contact with Sn. It was revealed that the CO/Rh mole ratio was less than 0.006 in every case, which means that nearly all the Rh loaded was in close contact with Sn. The influence of the surface area of the alumina support was then checked using Al2O3 with various surface areas (Fig. 2 ). Here, 2.6%Rh–3.0%Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were used. The catalyst with a higher surface area gave a slightly higher ester conversion. In contrast, and quite interestingly, better lauryl alcohol selectivity was obtained with a support with lower surface area, while the selectivity of lauryl laurate indicated a reverse trend. To improve the alcohol selectivity, it was important to determine how this lauryl laurate was formed. The ester-exchange reaction is known to be catalyzed by an acid or base [18], and the following experiments were conducted. The first possible catalyst explored was the acidic sites of alumina itself, while another possibility was chloride. Metal chloride was used as a precursor of Ru, Rh, or Sn, which may have left some chloride as acidic sites on the support. To investigate the first possibility, zirconia was used as a support instead of alumina because zirconia is often recognized as a basic support. As shown in Table 5 , quite similar lauryl laurate selectivity was observed, which suggests that the acidic sites of the alumina support were not the cause of the ester formation. To study the second possibility, precursors of the catalyst metals were changed to Ru(NO)(NO3)3 and (CH3COO)2Sn, respectively. The result using the catalyst prepared from these precursors is also shown also in Table 5. Again, the selectivity of lauryl laurate was similar to that with the catalyst prepared with chloride precursors. This result indicates that even if some chloride had remained on the support, it did not influence the formation of lauryl laurate. As the acid-catalyzed ester-exchange appeared not to occur under our reaction conditions, we checked the reaction without any catalyst. A mixture of methyl laurate and lauryl alcohol was placed into the autoclave and heated at 300°C for 4h in nitrogen. Also, further addition of α-Al2O3 to the mixture of methyl laurate and lauryl alcohol was studied. The results are shown in Table 6 . It is clear that the ester-exchange reaction occurred very easily and selectively without catalyst. In addition, the existence of α-Al2O3 did not influence the ester-exchange reaction, as the product selectivities were the same with or without the alumina. It has been stated that tin species influences the formation of oleyl oleate [8]. However, our results described above eliminate this possibility or suggest that the influence was at best minor under our reaction conditions. The influence of reaction temperature on the thermal ester-exchange reaction without catalyst was studied (data not shown), and it was revealed that even at 250°C a substantial non-catalytic ester-exchange reaction occurred. When the temperature was lowered to 200°C, the rate of the ester-exchange reaction became negligibly slow. The influence of reaction time on the product distribution is shown in Fig. 3 . The conversion increased almost linearly to approximately 2h and thereafter increased only gradually. This pattern may have been due to the hydrogen being consumed and not further supplied during the reaction. Therefore, if the hydrogen pressure were kept constant, an even higher conversion would be expected. At the beginning of the reaction, the selectivity of lauryl alcohol was approximately 40%; it then decreased to less than 10%. Thereafter, the selectivity increased gradually. In contrast, the selectivity of lauryl laurate increased and then after approximately 4h decreased gradually in accordance with the increase in the alcohol selectivity. As indicated above, the ester-exchange reaction occurs very easily under the reaction conditions, and the alcohol, once formed, was quickly consumed to give lauryl laurate. The gradual increase in lauryl alcohol selectivity with the concomitant decrease in lauryl laurate selectivity suggests that the rate of lauryl laurate hydrogenation is low. Therefore, in order to have a high alcohol selectivity, it is necessary to prepare a catalyst having high hydrogenation activity for lauryl laurate, preferably at temperatures below 250°C. Taking the above information into consideration, we would like to consider here the influence of the support surface area on the selectivity of alcohol. For both low and high surface area supports, once the alcohol forms it desorbs from the catalyst. The alcohol then easily forms the lengthy ester by the ester-exchange reaction. Therefore, for further alcohol formation, this lengthy ester must be hydrogenated. As the diffusion of the lengthy ester into the smaller pores of the high surface area support is slow, the rate of hydrogenation would be slow, while a support with low surface area has larger pores, thus making diffusion of the lengthy ester faster, resulting in a high rate of hydrogenation and consequently high alcohol selectivity."
7,Hydrogenation of methyl palmitate,"3.2 Hydrogenation of methyl palmitate Hydrogenation of methyl palmitate, whose molecular length is even longer than that of methyl laurate, was also studied using 5%Ru–5%Sn supported on Al2O3, SiO2, or ZrO2 of various surface areas (Fig. 4 ). A similar trend in Fig. 2 was observed; namely, with the increase in the support surface area, the selectivity of stearyl alcohol decreased, and, conversely, the selectivity of the ester-exchange product, stearyl stearate, increased, irrespective of the kind of support. Again, choosing the support with lower surface area was important to obtaining higher alcohol selectivity."
8,Conclusions,"Synthesis of higher alcohols by the hydrogenation of esters, methyl laurate, or methyl palmitate, was studied using noble metal-based binary catalysts at 300°C and an initial hydrogen pressure of 6.0MPa (room temperature). Rh–Sn, Pt–Sn, and Ru–Sn catalysts showed high catalytic performance. The molar ratio of noble metal to Sn influenced not only the activity but also the alcohol selectivity; Rh/Sn=1.0 was found to be preferable. Together with the intended alcohol, an ester-exchange product such as lauryl laurate and stearyl stearate was formed. The ester-exchange product was obtained by a thermal reaction of the raw material with the once-formed alcohol without catalyst under the reaction conditions adopted. The surface area of the support influenced the product selectivity, and the support with low surface area was favorable for alcohol formation. Therefore, the choice of support is very important for the selective synthesis of higher alcohols."
