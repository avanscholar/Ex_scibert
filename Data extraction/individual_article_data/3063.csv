0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting has long been sought after as a direct solar-to-chemical energy conversion process, with much of the focus on creating a sustainable and emissions-free source of hydrogen. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been one of the most widely researched water splitting photocatalyst materials due to its low-cost and high stability when irradiated in solution [1–3]. While the application of pure TiO2 is largely limited to the ultraviolet spectrum due to its wide band gap, it remains a popular candidate as a water splitting photocatalyst. Though photocatalytic water splitting over pure TiO2 surfaces is possible, it is often found to proceed at low to negligible rates. It has been shown that the rate of hydrogen evolution can be dramatically improved by depositing platinum nanoparticles (2–3.4nm) [4,5] onto the TiO2 surface, typically at loadings of 0.5–1wt% [4,6]. The presence of platinum sites, however, catalyzes the parasitic back reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water and waste heat, thus reducing the overall efficiency of the system. Platinum loadings beyond 1wt% are often found to decrease the overall rate of hydrogen production [4,6]. Interestingly, while the addition of platinum to the titanium dioxide surface allows the hydrogen evolution reaction to proceed, it has been demonstrated in a number of publications that, in pure water, little to no oxygen is detected throughout the course of the experiment [2,4,7–10]. The absence of stoichiometric oxygen evolution suggests that parasitic or side reactions are “trapping” the oxygen and otherwise hindering the reaction. Sayama and Arakawa demonstrated [11,12] that when photocatalytic water splitting over TiO2 was carried out in a Na2CO3 solution at an optimal Na2CO3 concentration of 2.2M, not only was stoichiometric evolution of hydrogen and oxygen observed, but the hydrogen evolution rate increased by nearly 600 times. The researchers hypothesized that this remarkable increase in performance may be due to the formation of a carbonate layer over the platinum nanodeposits, which reduces the parasitic back reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. It was also suggested that the carbonate ions afford an alternate reaction mechanism for water splitting in which carbonate species scavenge holes (thus preventing the photoadsorption of O2 and the formation peroxo-titanium species) and facilitate the desorption of O2 from the TiO2 surface [11,12]. Since the first demonstration of photocatalytic water splitting over TiO2 by Fujishima and Honda [13,14], TiO2 photocatalysts have typically been deployed as either suspended nanoparticle slurries or as immobilized films. From a reactor design point-of-view, suspended photocatalyst nanoparticle slurries offer good radiation distribution throughout the reaction volume, excellent mass transfer and a high photocatalyst surface area with respect to the reactor volume. In suspended nanoparticle systems, however, the evolved hydrogen and oxygen remain in contact with the platinum-loaded photocatalyst particles for extended periods of time, thus exacerbating the parasitic back reaction. This, in turn, limits the scalability and performance of suspended nanoparticle systems. Immobilized thin film photocatalysts address this issue in that the reaction products are easily separated from the platinum-loaded photocatalyst. However, immobilized film photocatalysts tend to suffer from poor radiation distribution, limited rates of mass transfer and low photocatalyst surface area (with respect to the reactor volume) [15]; all of which limit the performance and scalability of immobilized film systems. Fluidized bed reactors operate by suspending particles (larger than the nanoparticles typically employed) throughout the reactor volume by the upward flow of a liquid phase. When used for photocatalytic processes such as water treatment, fluidized bed reactors offer improved mass transfer, excellent radiation distribution, and a photocatalyst surface area-to-volume ratio approaching that of suspended nanoparticle systems [16–18]. This approach also yields fast and simple separation of the reaction products from the platinum-loaded photocatalyst particles as the products are carried from the reactor by the fluid flow while the photocatalyst particles are retained in the reactor. The product gases can then be separated from the fluid by downstream separation processes. Fluidization does, however, introduce the issue of mechanical stability, as the photocatalyst particles must be able to withstand particle-to-particle and particle-to-wall collisions. To our knowledge, there have been no other reported attempts of photocatalytic water splitting in fluidized beds by other researchers; however, there have been several endeavors to employ fluidized TiO2 photocatalysts for both air and water treatment [16,18–32]. Previously reported attempts of producing fluidizable photocatalysts employ sol-gel [16,18–24], slurry dip-coating [25–30], or CVD methods [31–34] to affix the photocatalyst material onto fluidizable substrates, such as glass beads, though this was often met with limited success. In most instances, the adhesion of the photocatalyst material to the fluidizable supports was not great enough to withstand the rigors of fluidization and significant attrition of the TiO2 photocatalyst from the fluidizable support material was often observed; in most instances, the photocatalyst material would be ablated from the substrate surface in a short period of time. From the literature, the critical failure point for supported titanium dioxide films are at the support/TiO2 film interface, where the TiO2 film is attached by weak Van der Waals forces, or at fractures and stress points induced by shrinkage during the drying process [35,36]. One research group attempted to improve the mechanical strength of the TiO2-substrate interface by hydroxylating the surface of soda glass beads with a strong NaOH bath such that residual OH− surface groups could chemically bind with a TiO2 sol-gel [23]. While this did achieve an improvement over slurry deposited films, the mechanical strength of the film was still limited and unsuitable for fluidization. Keshmiri et al. [36] developed a novel TiO2-TiO2 composite film where commercially available Degussa P25 nanoparticles where combined with a TiO2 sol-gel binder. The sol-gel binder caused the P25 nanoparticles to bond to each other, and to a supporting substrate; this resulted in a remarkable improvement in the adhesion of the TiO2 photocatalyst to the supporting substrate. Vega et al. [24] further developed this TiO2-TiO2 composite technique to form self-supported spherical beads of pure TiO2, which were formed by combining the still wet composite solution with a polymer matrix and cast into spheres by a drop forming technique. By removing the weak TiO2-support interface entirely, the TiO2 particles demonstrated dramatically improved attrition resistance and outstanding performance when used for the degradation of model water contaminants in a fluidized bed reactor. We previously reported our preliminary findings on photocatalytic water splitting in a UV-irradiated fluidized bed reactor where it was found that, on a per reactor volume basis, the fluidized bed approach yielded a marked increase in the hydrogen evolution performance over conventional photocatalyst slurries [37]. In this work, we explore the concept further and present a comprehensive study on photocatalytic water splitting in a UV-irradiated fluidized bed reactor. We present a special designed fluidized bed reactor system (shown in Fig. 1 A and B) and fluidizable, platinum-deposited TiO2 photocatalyst particles. The water splitting performance of the fluidizable TiO2 photocatalyst particles is compared with that of a standard suspended photocatalyst slurry (Pt-loaded Degussa P25) typically employed in literature. Additionally, we investigated the use of an aqueous 2.2M Na2CO3 reaction solution as a means to achieve stable and efficient hydrogen evolution."
1,Experimental section,
2,Experimental apparatus,"2.1 Experimental apparatus The annular fluidized bed reactor employed in this work (Fig. 1A) has an inner annulus comprised of a quartz glass tube containing a low-pressure mercury vapor ultraviolet (UV) lamp (Emperor Aquatics, 50W, 254nm). The outer reactor body is manufactured from polycarbonate. The photocatalytic reaction zone, formed between the quartz glass tube and the outer polycarbonate wall, has an inner radius of 1.41 cm, an outer radius of 2.54 cm, and an effective length of 32.76 cm, yielding a total fluidized reactor volume of 0.45L. The lower inlet portion of the reactor was conically shaped and contained a flow distributor, which was necessary in order to avoid jetting and to ensure even fluidization within the reactor. The flow distributor consisted of a packed bed of 2 mm glass beads (bed thickness: 3.2 cm) supported between two circular 316 stainless steel mesh sheets (Top: 6.35 cm diameter, 40×40 mesh, 0.25 mm wire; Bottom: 3.81 cm diameter, 18×18 mesh, 0.43 mm wire). The upper outlet portion of the reactor contains dual outlet ports and was designed such that no gas bubbles can be trapped; this ensures that all product gases are removed from the reactor volume so as to provide accurate measurement of the gas evolution rates. The fluidized bed reactor formed part of a larger system as shown in Fig. 1B. The outlet ports of the fluidized bed reactor were connected directly to a gas-liquid separator unit (total volume of 0.40L). An N2-gas sparge fitted with a stainless steel frit was used to purge air from the reactor system and to remove any dissolved hydrogen and oxygen from the reaction solution. The sparge also served as a gas sweep during experiments to continuously carry the evolved hydrogen and oxygen to a gas chromatography system for analysis; an electronic mass flow controller was employed to ensure accuracy. The top of the separator was also fitted with a thermocouple, a digital pressure gauge, a pressure relief valve and a number of auxiliary ports for other measurements, such as liquid sampling. The gas outlet from the separator was connected to an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with parallel channels, each consisting of HayeSep Q and Molsieve 5A columns and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The use of dual TCDs, each with separate helium and nitrogen carrier gases, allowed the GC system to be configured to allow lower detection limits and improved measurement accuracy of oxygen and hydrogen (respectively). A PanWorld NH-100PX centrifugal pump was used to circulate a 2.2M aqueous Na2CO3 solution through the system to fluidize the photocatalyst particles. The recirculation flow rates ranged from 5L/min to 8L/min, depending on the desired expanded bed height, and the physical properties and the amount of photocatalyst particles used. For some experiments, a Gems Sensors FT-110 electronic turbine flow sensor was used to measure the liquid flow rate; the electronic flow meter was not used for all experimental runs as its reliability was affected by the photocatalyst slurry and sediment from photocatalyst particle attrition. A National Instruments USB-6212 Data Acquisition (DAQ) card provided direct control of the GC, UV lamp, and centrifugal circulation pump, and was used to record the temperature, flow rate and pressure data. The system control structure and user interface were constructed using National Instruments LabView Version 9."
3,TiO2 sol-gel composite preparation,"2.2 TiO2 sol-gel composite preparation Fluidizable photocatalyst particles were produced via the method first described by Vega et al. [24]. The photocatalyst production process is outlined in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information). A TiO2 sol-gel was first prepared by acid hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP). Deionized water (6.4ml) was added to 96ml of denatured ethyl alcohol (Fisher, A407-20) in a 500ml sealable glass jar and stirred for 10min. Hydrochloric acid (Fisher, 37%) (16ml) was then added and allowed to stir for an additional 10min. TTIP (120ml) (Sigma Aldrich, 97%) was slowly added while stirring vigorously to prevent fast gelation and precipitation of the TiO2. The solution was stirred at 400rpm for 2h. Degussa P25 nanoparticles (38g) were then added to the sol-gel solution and the bottle was sealed to prevent the solution from drying. The resulting composite mixture was stirred overnight (approximately 14–16h)."
4,Chitosan polymer solution preparation,"2.3 Chitosan polymer solution preparation A polymer forming solution (1% w/w) was prepared by adding 3.56ml of glacial acetic acid (Fisher, 99.7%) to 900ml of deionized water; 9g of chitosan (Sigma Aldrich, medium molecular weight) was then added while the solution was stirred vigorously. The solution thickens dramatically with the addition of chitosan and requires stirring up to 24h for the chitosan to be completely dissolved. This solution could be stored at room temperature for several months without any change in behavior or performance."
5,TiO2 sphere formation,"2.4 TiO2 sphere formation The chitosan polymer solution was added to a large beaker, and then the TiO2 sol-gel-composite solution was mixed into the polymer solution at a 1:2vol ratio while stirring vigorously. The beaker was covered and the solution was then stirred for 2h. TiO2 spheres were produced by the drop-wise addition of the chitosan/TiO2 solution from a burette into a basic NH4OH (Fisher, 30%) solution (6:94% v/v NH4OH/H2O). Chitosan undergoes fast gelation on contact with the basic solution, causing the droplets to instantly harden and maintain their spherical shape. The resulting particles were then dried for several days at room temperature. While drying, the particle diameter reduces dramatically (∼90%). The dried photocatalyst particles were spherical with an average diameter of 1.1 mm. The photocatalyst particles were calcined at 500°C for three hours in air to crystallize amorphous TiO2 sol-gel binder and to burn away the chitosan polymer matrix. The calcination temperature was chosen to be below the anatase-to-rutile transition temperature of 550°C so as to maintain a high percentage of the anatase phase in the final samples."
6,Preconditioning,"2.5 Preconditioning Approximately 100g of the calcined photocatalyst particles were placed in the drum of a lapidary tumbler (Lortone Model 3A) with 120ml deionized water and preconditioned for 48h to remove loose TiO2 “dust” and fine, easy to remove surface features. The photocatalyst particles were then rinsed thoroughly and dried at room temperature. The particles were then calcined in air to 500°C for one hour following preconditioning to remove any contaminants that may have been imparted by the rubber drum of the lapidary tumbler."
7,Platinum deposition,"2.6 Platinum deposition Platinum was deposited into the outer, photoactive region of the photocatalyst particles by photodeposition of Pt from a H2PtCl6 solution. The calcined and physically conditioned photocatalyst particles were placed into the reaction volume of the UV-irradiated fluidized bed reactor with 1L of water. Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (CPA) (Sigma) was added to the solution in the amount of 0.0107 grams per gram of photocatalyst particles. The system was sealed and the solution was circulated through the system at a low flow rate (avoiding fluidization of the particles) while purging with nitrogen until oxygen was present only in trace amounts. The flow rate was then increased until the photocatalyst particles fluidized to an expanded bed height of 21.5 cm (bed voidage, ε≈0.78–0.89) and the UV lamp was turned on for a 3-h period. The total radiant power of the low-pressure mercury UV lamp had been measured using an iodide-iodate chemical actinometer prior to the Pt deposition (Supporting Information). The photocatalyst particles were then removed from the reactor, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and dried at 100°C overnight. The dry platinum-loaded particles were then calcined in a tube furnace under a hydrogen atmosphere (10% H2 in Ar, 50ml/min) at 450°C for 2h."
8,Suspended slurry baseline measurement,"2.7 Suspended slurry baseline measurement To provide a baseline performance comparison, a suspended slurry photocatalyst was employed in the reactor system following a procedure similar to that outlined by Sayama and Arakawa [11,12]. Degussa P25 nanoparticles were suspended in a 2.2M Na2CO3 solution at a concentration of 1g/L (as per Karakitsou and Verykios [1], and Kiwi and Gratzel [4]). Chloroplatinic acid (0.7wt% Pt to TiO2) was added to 1L of the solution, which was then sealed in the reactor. The reactor was purged with nitrogen at 100ml/min overnight until oxygen was at amounts less than 2.5ppm. The solution was circulated at 7.6L/min, the nitrogen purge was reduced to 50ml/min and the UV lamp was turned on. During the first 2–3h of UV irradiation, platinum nanoparticles photodeposited onto the surface of the P25 particles. The water splitting reaction was allowed to proceed for up to 200h."
9,Experimental procedure,"2.8 Experimental procedure The Pt-deposited fluidizable TiO2 photocatalyst particles were added to the UV-irradiated fluidized bed in the amounts of 60, 80, 100 and 120 grams. Freshly made batches of photocatalyst particles were used for each experimental run. The reactor system was then filled with 1L of 2.2M Na2CO3 in water (pre-heated to 35°C) and sealed. The solution was circulated throughout the reactor system at low flow rates, taking care to avoid fluidization, while purging with nitrogen at 100ml/min for several hours (until oxygen was detectable to amounts less than 2.5ppm). The nitrogen flow rate was then decreased to 50ml/min and the solution circulation flow rate was increased until the bed reached an expanded bed height of 24 cm; the flow rates ranged from 5L/min to 8L/min, depending the mass of photocatalyst particles loaded into the reactor. The UV lamp was then turned on and the photocatalytic reaction was allowed to proceed for 24h. The GC system was remotely triggered by the USB-6212 DAQ to analyze the composition of the product gas stream from the system at 8-min intervals. The product gas stream was allowed to vent and was not collected. The system consistently stabilized at a constant temperature of 35°C throughout all experiments."
10,Characterization,"2.9 Characterization The specific surface area of the photocatalyst particles was measured using the single-point Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The microstructural characteristics of the TiO2 photocatalyst particles were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D2 Phaser desktop X-ray diffractometer (Cu Ka radiation, 1.5418 Å). SEM imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were conducted on both the Hitachi S-2600N Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (VP-SEM) and the Hitachi S3000N VP-SEM with EDX. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging was conducted on a FEI Tecnai G2 200kV Transmission Electron Microscope. The photocatalyst samples were analyzed by dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopy (D-SIMS) using a Cameca IMS-3f ion microprobe using a positive caesium beam and monitoring various negative secondary ions of interest. The depth scales are approximate and were determined by measuring the sputter rate on a cross-sectioned sample."
11,Safety considerations,"2.10 Safety considerations As hydrogen and oxygen are evolved together from the fluidized bed system, precautions were taken to reduce the risk of explosion. The nitrogen sweep gas flow rate was chosen such that the evolved hydrogen was highly diluted and well below the explosion limit. The product stream was vented into a well-ventilated area. All electronic equipment near the reactor system was grounded to reduce the chance of an electric spark."
12,Results and discussion,
13,TiO2 photocatalyst particle properties,"3.1 TiO2 photocatalyst particle properties The crystalline phase and crystallite size of the as-synthesized TiO2 photocatalyst particles were characterized by XRD measurement. The diffraction peaks of the TiO2 photocatalyst particles shown in Fig. S2 (Supporting Information) were consistent with mixed anatase and rutile phases; no other phases or impurities were observed. The weight fraction of the anatase phase was estimated by the following equation [38]: (1) X A = 1 1 + 1.26 I R I A where IA and IR are the intensities of the most intense XRD peaks for anatase and rutile, respectively. In Fig. S2 (Supporting Information), IA and IR correspond to the intensities of the peaks located at 25.5° and 27.6°, respectively. The weight fraction of the anatase phase was calculated to be 84%, with the remainder being entirely rutile. This corresponds well with the expected anatase-to-rutile phase composition of 80:20 for the Degussa P25 [39] used in the production of the TiO2 spheres, and suggests that the TiO2 sol-gel employed as a binder in the composite primarily forms anatase particles upon calcination. The average crystallite sizes of the TiO2 nanoparticles was calculated by using the Sherrer equation [40]. The anatase and rutile crystallite sizes were determined to be 19nm and 75nm, respectively. The specific surface area of the photocatalyst particles was determined by BET analysis. The finished particles were determined to have a surface area of 31.4m2/g. The measured surface area is less than that of the measured 54m2/g for Degussa P25 as a free powder, indicating a partial reduction of surface area. This is likely due to particle-to-particle necking and sintering due to the sol-gel binder and calcination, respectively, and not crystal growth (which would be expected at calcination temperatures above 550°C). The mean particle diameter of the calcined photocatalyst particles was found to be 1.1 mm, indicating the particles underwent a significant 87.5% volume reduction during the drying process. It was found that the calcined photocatalyst particles have a bulk density of 3500 kg/m3 and a packed bed density of 1200 kg/m3 (thus giving a voidage of 0.34). These physical characteristics place the particles in the Geldart class D (spoutable) [41], and yield an estimated minimum fluidization velocity of 0.008m/s (∼0.67L/min)."
14,Surface “Pleating” effect,"3.2 Surface “Pleating” effect While the interior of the photocatalyst particles is pure TiO2 and without any remarkable features or defects, SEM imaging of the particle exterior revealed a unique, pleated surface around the equator of all particles (Fig. S3A, Supporting Information). This pleating effect is a result of the manufacturing process and is consistent with Vega’s observations [24]. The force of the droplets impacting the surface of the basic solution during the particle forming process causes the resulting particles to be more ellipsoidal in shape. As the particles undergo their significant volume change during the drying process, internal stresses pull the particles into a more spherical shape, causing the excess material around the equator of the particles to pleat. These pleats and other fine surface features can be seen in greater detail in (Fig. S3B, Supporting Information). The pleats are surprisingly consistent around the entire equator of the particle and are on average 15μm across (taken from trough to trough) and approximately 300μm in length. Despite the pleated surface features, the particles do not show any cracks or defects resulting from the manufacturing process."
15,Particle attrition,"3.3 Particle attrition Though the TiO2 composite greatly improves the mechanical strength of the photocatalyst particles, attrition is not eliminated entirely. The initial attrition rate of freshly calcined particles was observed to be high, which appears to be due to easy-to-ablate fine surface features being removed in the initial stages of use. A sample of 120g of the TiO2 photocatalyst particles were placed in the rubber drum of a lapidary tumbler for 1h, after which time they were washed and dried; the physically conditioned particles were then observed with SEM analysis (Fig. S3A, Supporting Information). It was found that the fine features exposed to particle-to-particle contact, such as the surface roughness seen on both the flat and pleated surfaces of the particle in (Fig. S3A, Supporting Information), had been removed quickly, resulting in a smooth outer surface. The most notable areas of attrition were observed on the aforementioned surface pleats. As seen in (Fig. S3C, Supporting Information), 1h of physical conditioning resulted in the crests of the pleats being ablated away, leaving the pleats with a truncated appearance. Fine surface features can still be seen in the troughs between the pleats as they are protected from direct contact. After several hours of physical conditioning the pleats had largely eroded away, leaving the particles with a polished, glossy surface and a spherical appearance over the entire surface: i.e., only minor striations could be seen where the pleats once stood. The observed attrition of the physically conditioned particles was markedly reduced when compared to that of freshly calcined particles. These results underscore the importance of physically pre-conditioning the photocatalyst particles before any further processing steps, such as platinum deposition, or use in the fluidized bed reactor. It is necessary to minimize attrition before use so as to minimize the effects of free photocatalyst particles suspended in the reaction solution during experimental runs, as well as to prevent the loss of the critical and expensive platinum deposits. As a precaution, all photocatalyst particles were preconditioned in the lapidary tumbler for 48h prior to platinum deposition and use in the fluidized bed reactor."
16,Platinum deposition,"3.4 Platinum deposition During the platinum photodeposition process, the color of the photocatalyst particles changed from their natural bright white to a light yellow-brown. Once the photocatalyst particles had been subjected to the final H2-reduction step in the tube furnace, their color changed to a dark grey. Bisection of the photocatalyst particles revealed that the inner core of the particles remained the natural bright white color of TiO2, and that only the outer surface layer of the particles displayed the characteristic grey color of the Pt-deposited TiO2. Both XRD and EDX analyses were employed to determine the concentration of platinum on the TiO2 surface, though neither method could detect Pt on the TiO2 surface. The presence of platinum was later confirmed by XPS analysis; however, the results were not consistent enough to provide a reliable estimate of the Pt surface concentration. TEM imaging was used in an attempt to visually identify platinum deposited on the TiO2 particles; however, despite extensive work with the TEM equipment, no platinum deposits could be readily identified. This is likely due to the concentration of Pt-deposited TiO2 being very dilute with respect to the Pt-free TiO2 inner core of the particle, or that the platinum deposits were smaller than the resolution of the TEM equipment. It is suspected that the latter may be probable as some sources [5,42,43] suggest that the platinum deposits may be 2nm or less in size; this is below the 5nm resolution limit of the TEM equipment used. In order to better understand how Pt deposited throughout the three-dimensional TiO2 structure, the depth profile of the particles was analyzed using dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopy (D-SIMS). The D-SIMS depth profile results (shown in Fig. 2 A), clearly demonstrate the presence of platinum incorporated into the TiO2 matrix. Interestingly, both silicon and aluminum were detected in the sample as impurities (for which the source could not be identified); the signal intensities for both oxygen and titanium, however, did not vary with fluctuations in either the silicon or aluminum signal intensities, suggesting that the impurities are dilute. By using the relative intensity ratio of the platinum to titanium signals as a reference for the platinum concentration, it can be seen that the Pt concentration decays in an exponential manner with increasing depth into the TiO2 bulk (Fig. 2B). The total concentration of platinum nanodeposits in the photocatalyst particles was determined to be 0.028wt% through ICP-MS measurement. It can be seen in Fig. 2B that the platinum concentration approaches negligible amounts as the depth into the particles increases. If it is assumed that all platinum detected via ICP-MS was deposited only into the outer layer of the TiO2 photocatalyst particles while the core of the particles remains platinum-free, the effective Pt loading at the outer surface and average loading in the photodeposited layer can be estimated by integrating the relative intensity ratio over the sputter depth. The Pt concentration at the outer photocatalyst surface was estimated to be 1.39wt% and the average Pt loading in the photodeposited layer to be 0.52wt%. From Fig. 2B, it is possible to estimate the effective diffusion length for photo-excited electrons through the bulk TiO2. The probability, p, that an electron will be captured by either a recombination process or through a reaction with a H2PtCl6 molecule during photodeposition at a given distance, x, from the photon absorption site (i.e., the outer particle surface) can be written as [44–46]: (2) p ( x ) = e - x / Ln where the effective electron diffusion length, Ln, may be estimated by the conduction band electron diffusion coefficient, D0, and the conduction band electron lifetime, τe: (3) L n = ( D 0 τ e ) 1 / 2 If it is assumed that Pt will only deposit as deep into the TiO2 bulk as electrons can diffuse from the photon absorption sites at the outer particle surface, and that the local platinum concentration is approximately proportional to the probability of electron capture/reaction, the data shown in Fig. 2B can be fitted to an exponential function having the form shown in equation 3. The effective electron diffusion length is estimated to be 4.1μm and it can be seen that the Pt concentration approaches negligible levels near a depth of 10μm. Leng et al. [46] observed that, in a photoelectrochemical water splitting experiment, the effective electron diffusion length into a TiO2 film was approximately 10μm and that the effective diffusion length varied only slightly with an applied bias potential. The effective electron diffusion length estimated in this work is expected to be less than that observed by Leng et al. [46] as Pt deposits and surface reactions with H2PtCl6 molecules act to capture electrons, thus limiting their effective electron diffusion length."
17,Baseline slurry photocatalyst performance,"3.5 Baseline slurry photocatalyst performance Fig. 3 A shows the time dependence of hydrogen and oxygen evolution from a 2.2M Na2CO3 solution containing platinized Degussa P25 nanoparticles (1g/L); the solution was circulated through the reactor system at a flow rate of approximately 7.6L/min. It was observed that the rate of hydrogen evolution increased steadily over 200h, eventually reaching a steady-state rate of about 204μmol/h after 215h of operation. This results is in agreement with observations by Sayama and Arakawa [11,12], where the rate of gas evolution increased steadily, reaching a steady state rate after extended operation. It should be noted that the maximum rate of hydrogen evolution over suspended P25 nanoparticles observed by Sayama and Arakawa (568μmol/h) is 2.8 times greater than the maximum observed in this study – this is due to several notable differences between the two reactor systems which prevent direct comparison of the evolution rates. First, Sayama and Arakawa utilized a 400W high-pressure Hg lamp, which has a higher radiant flux in the ultraviolet region than the lamp employed for this study. Second, unlike the reactor employed by Sayama and Arakawa, where the entire reactor volume was irradiated, the reactor system used in this study had an irradiated reactor volume of 0.45L and a total solution volume of 1L. As such, ∼55% of the Pt-deposited P25 particles were contained in “dark” (non-irradiated) regions of the reactor system (i.e., the separator, recirculation pump and piping) and were serving to only promote the back reaction. Finally, our reactor was operated continuously at a pressure of 1 psig. In contrast, the reactor in Sayama and Arakawa’s study was operated in batch-mode under vacuum pressures as they had observed that the rate of evolution was greatly affected by the reactor pressure. As seen in Fig. 3B, hydrogen and oxygen are evolved at a constant molar ratio of 2 after an initial period of time. It should be noted that during the initial hours of the experiment, the H2/O2 ratio exceeded the expected stoichiometric ratio and decreased with time, eventually settling to a value of 2 and remaining steady after 50h of operation."
18,Typical fluidized photocatalyst performance,"3.6 Typical fluidized photocatalyst performance Fig. 4 A shows the time dependence of hydrogen and oxygen evolution from a 2.2M Na2CO3 solution containing 80g of the fluidizable Pt-deposited photocatalyst particles, and is representative of the typical time course for all experiments employing the fluidizable TiO2 particles. For all experiments, it was observed that the hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates would increase steadily up to a steady-state rate, reaching a constant rate of hydrogen output within a relatively short period of time (5–15h), and would then remain constant throughout the remaining time of the experiment. This is in contrast to the suspended slurry photocatalyst baseline experiments, which required more than 200h to reach a steady rate of hydrogen evolution. It was observed that, despite extensive nitrogen purging of the reactor system and the Na2CO3 solution, some excess oxygen could be detected during the initial 30–40min of the experiments, which could be seen as large fluctuations in the rate of O2 evolution. It was determined that these fluctuations were a result of any remaining air bubbles trapped in the reactor system being freed as the circulation flow rate was increased to fluidize the photocatalyst particles; no escaping air bubbles were observed beyond 1h of operation. Near stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution was observed in all experiments during steady-state operation; however, in all experiments it was also observed that the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen evolution greatly exceeded the expected stoichiometric ratio of 2 during the initial stages of the experiment. As seen in Fig. 4B, the molar ratio of hydrogen to oxygen evolution is seen to reach a maximum after 2.5h, eventually settling to the expected stoichiometric ratio of 2 after 10h of operation. This effect will be discussed further in the following section. Table 1 shows the reactor conditions, the steady-state hydrogen evolution rates, and the measured hydrogen-to-oxygen molar ratio at steady state for various mass loadings of the fluidizable TiO2 particles in the fluidized bed reactor; the results of the P25 slurry baseline experiment are also shown in Table 1 for comparison purposes. For all of the fluidized bed experiments, the photocatalyst particles were fluidized to an expanded bed height of 24 cm, except for those utilizing 120g of photocatalyst particles. As the expanded bed height of a fluidized bed varies proportionally with both the height of the static bed of photocatalyst particles in the reactor (which is a function of the amount of photocatalyst used) and the bed expansion coefficient (a function of the flow rate through the reactor), the expanded bed height becomes increasingly sensitive to changes in the recirculation flow rate as the amount of photocatalyst particles in the reactor increases (e.g., the change in bed height for 120g of photocatalyst particles is twice as great as the change in bed height for 60g of particles over for the same change in flow rate). As such, the expanded bed height was highly sensitive to slight fluctuations in the recirculation flow rate at a mass loading of 120g, with slight increases in flow rate causing the bed to expand dramatically (often to the point where particles would elute from the reactor). The valve employed to control the recirculation flow rate in the fluidized bed system was found to be less accurate at low flow rates, making it challenging to achieve a stable bed height at 24 cm. It was found that decreasing the flow rate slightly for loadings of 120g, the expanded bed settled to a stable bed height of 18 cm and was less sensitive to fluctuations in the recirculation flow rate. It should be noted that in our reactor the expanded fluidized bed utilizes only a portion of the total reactor volume and lamp length, while the suspended photocatalyst slurry employs the entire reactor volume (and thus covers the full length of the UV lamp). Moreover, the irradiated volume of a fluidized bed varies with the expanded bed height; it was determined that the lamp irradiance was approximately constant along the length of the lamp (via actinometry) and thus it was assumed that the amount of incident UV light entering the reaction volume varied linearly with the expanded bed height. As such, it is necessary to normalize the hydrogen evolution rates based on the irradiated reaction volume (Table 1) in order to accurately compare the rates for the different photocatalyst types (fluidized versus suspended slurry) and for the different expanded bed heights. For all fluidized photocatalyst mass loadings, the fluidized particles exhibited a higher rate of hydrogen production per irradiated reactor volume than the suspended slurry photocatalyst, with photocatalyst loadings of 60g and 80g exhibiting a 55% increase over that of the suspended P25 photocatalyst particles. It is hypothesized that the increased rate of hydrogen evolution per reactor volume for the fluidized photocatalyst particles is due to the evolved hydrogen and oxygen being quickly separated from the platinum-loaded photocatalyst particles. In contrast, P25 photocatalyst particles were dispersed throughout the entire reactor system when using the suspended slurry, and thus P25 particles in non-irradiated regions of the system served only to promote the back reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that the rate of hydrogen evolution per irradiated volume decreased for fluidized photocatalyst particle loadings beyond 80g. Similarly, when the rate of hydrogen evolution is normalized with respect to the mass of fluidized photocatalyst particles (Fig. 5), there is a near linear decrease in the specific rate of hydrogen evolution with increasing photocatalyst mass loadings. The reduction in performance when increasing the photocatalyst loading beyond 80grams is likely due, in part, to the increase in bed density, which results in the photocatalyst particles near the outer wall of the reactor receiving less light and serving only to promote the parasitic back reaction. It is important to note that the fluidized and suspended slurry photocatalysts cannot be accurately compared on a per weight basis as ∼95% of the fluidized photocatalyst particle mass resides within the core of the particle and does not participate in the reaction. The performance of the fluidized and suspended slurry photocatalysts are best compared through the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), which is defined as: (4) Φ app = ( 2 R net / P i ) × 100 % where Rnet and Pi are the net rate of hydrogen evolution measured leaving the separator and the total rate of photons entering the reaction volume, respectively (the reaction volume for the suspended photocatalyst slurry and the fluidized photocatalyst particles is that of the entire reactor and the volume defined by the expanded bed, respectively). It was observed that for all fluidized experiments, the AQE was greater than that observed for the suspended P25 photocatalyst particles. When compared to the suspended P25 particles, the 80g of fluidized photocatalyst particles (which employed the same recirculation flow rate as the suspended slurry) displays a 44% increase in the AQE. This effect is, again, likely due to the rapid separation of the evolved H2 and O2 from the Pt-loaded photocatalyst particles, which results in reduced rates of back reaction compared to the suspended slurry photocatalyst. This observation demonstrates the importance of minimizing regions of non-irradiated photocatalyst particles, be it suspended nanoparticles, fluidized photocatalysts or otherwise, when designing and scaling photocatalytic hydrogen production systems that employ platinum as a co-catalyst."
19,Effect of Na2CO3,"3.7 Effect of Na2CO3 To observe the effect of Na2CO3 on the water splitting performance of the fluidizable photocatalyst particles, 60 g of the photocatalyst particles were first loaded into the reactor and fluidized to an expanded bed height of 24 cm using deionized water only. As seen in Fig. 6 , the rate of hydrogen evolution rapidly rose to a maximum and then decayed continually with time; if left for an extended period of time, the system would trend toward a pseudo-steady state rate. Negligible oxygen evolution was observed throughout the experiment. This observation is consistent with that of a number of published results that attempt photocatalytic hydrogen production in pure water (without sacrificial reagents) [1,2,4,7,8,47–49]. In order to ascertain whether the decay in the hydrogen evolution rate with time was a photo-induced effect on the photocatalyst surface, the lamp was shut off for a period of 4h while the photocatalyst remained fluidized and the solution was continuously purged with nitrogen. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that, when the lamp was turned back on, the hydrogen evolution rate quickly rose back to nearly the same rate as before and the decay in performance continued in the same fashion. Furthermore, it was found that the lamp could be shut off at any point during the experiment for any amount of time and the rate would return near to its previous value once the lamp was powered on again. These results suggest that the photocatalyst deactivation process is likely a photo-induced effect whose extent is dependent on the cumulative exposure to UV irradiation. Abe et al. [9] observed the same effect in that TiO2 photocatalyst nanoparticles suspended in pure water exhibit a continual decay in the H2 evolution rate in combination with an absence of O2 evolution. Furthermore, they observed that the photocatalyst particles would become completely deactivated and cease hydrogen evolution after being irradiated for 600h. After further investigation of their deactivated photocatalyst particles, Abe et al. described a shift in the crystalline structure of the TiO2 when compared to that of fresh photocatalyst particles (as measured by XRD) and that the valence state of 35% of the Ti atoms (calculated) had changed from Ti4+ to Ti5+ (as measured by XPS analysis). It was postulated that the TiO2 itself was acting as an electron donor, which led to the formation of a stable (yet photocatalytically inactive) (Ti2O5)(TiO2)2 mixed-valence structure. It has also been demonstrated in the literature that oxygen photo-adsorption and peroxo-species formation both readily occur on the surface of TiO2 under UV irradiation in the presence of water [9,50–57] and may account for the absence of O2 evolution during photocatalytic water splitting. Tang et al. [10] provide evidence that oxygen evolution is a complex process requiring: 4-hole chemistry, the formation of three possible intermediate species, and that, in the absence of a hole scavenging species, O2 can be rapidly consumed by the photo-excited TiO2 to form peroxotitante complexes. In addition, it has been demonstrated in nearly all reports of hydrogen peroxide generation on TiO2 surfaces that the formed peroxo-species are not detected in solution, suggesting that the peroxides do not readily desorb from the TiO2 surface [50,54,57] and even remain chemically bound to the TiO2 surface long after the light source has been removed. Harbour et al. [50] observed that titanium dioxide nanoparticles were capable of containing over twenty-two chemisorbed H2O2 molecules per square nanometer of photocatalyst surface area, which, for the high surface area TiO2 photocatalysts regularly employed in literature and this work, represents a significant capacity for adsorbed peroxides. The photo-induced deactivation of TiO2 photocatalyst particles and simultaneous absence of O2 evolution observed in Fig. 6 may be ascribed to either, or a combination of, the two mechanisms described above. During the same experiment employing 60g of the fluidized photocatalyst particles in deionized water described above, the lamp was shut off after 14h of operation and Na2CO3 was added to the separator and subsequently allowed to dissolve and mix; the resulting Na2CO3 concentration was 2.2M. The reactor was purged continuously during this time to remove any oxygen that was introduced into the system during the addition of Na2CO3. It was observed that a small amount of hydrogen was liberated from the solution following the addition of Na2CO3. The UV lamp was restarted beginning at 20h and the liquid-phase flow rate was adjusted slightly to maintain an expanded bed height of 24 cm (adjustment was necessary to compensate for the increased fluid density following the addition of Na2CO3). As seen in Fig. 7 A, the rate of gas evolution steadily recovered over the course of 50h to reach a pseudo-steady state rate of hydrogen evolution of about 203μmol/h; this result is similar to that achieved in other experiments employing 60g of the 1.1 mm photocatalyst particles in 2.2M aqueous Na2CO3. After a total of 95h of operation following the addition of Na2CO3, the rate of hydrogen rose to reach a maximum steady-state rate of 232μmol/h. During this time, hydrogen and oxygen evolved at the expected stoichiometric ratio of 2 (as shown in Fig. 7B), again displaying the characteristic over-stoichiometric evolution of hydrogen during the initial hours of operation. The results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 suggest that the decay in the rate of hydrogen evolution (and corresponding lack of oxygen evolution) is a photo-induced process – likely due to the formation of peroxo-species on the TiO2 surface and/or the conversion of TiO2 to a photocatalytically inactive mixed-valence structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the addition of Na2CO3 to a solution containing photocatalyst particles that had been previously partially deactivated by the photo-induced process, be it nanoparticles or large fluidizable particles, is capable of fully recovering the performance back to high, steady rates, and that oxygen evolves at the expected stoichiometric ratio. Sayama and Arakawa [11,12] argue that the dramatic increase in water splitting performance in the presence of Na2CO3 arises due to: (1) a protective layer of adsorbed Na2CO3 covering the platinum surfaces, thus suppressing the back reaction, (2) reduced photoadsorption of O2 on the TiO2 surface, and (3) an alternate reaction pathway involving peroxocarbonate species that scavenges holes at the TiO2 surface and is favorable to the evolution of O2. While Na2CO3 may indeed reduce the back reaction at platinum deposits as Sayama and Arakawa suggest, this effect does not adequately explain the lack of O2 evolution (as the back reaction is presumed to proceed with the same stoichiometry as water splitting) or the deactivation of the TiO2 in the absence of Na2CO3. As such, it is expected that the latter two effects dominate. The observations presented here in this study suggest that Na2CO3 may prevent deactivation of the TiO2, promote stoichiometric water splitting and improve the rate of gas evolution by: (1) scavenging holes, thus reducing efficiency lost to e−/h+ recombination processes; (2) preventing or destabilizing surface adsorbed peroxo-species that reduce the available surface area and limit oxygen evolution; (3) providing an alternate reaction mechanism that is favorable to oxygen evolution, and (4) scavenging holes from the TiO2 surface, thus preventing TiO2 from acting as an electron donor, which in turn, prevents (and possibly reverses) the formation of mixed-valence species that lead to deactivation. It is of interest to note the absence of excess oxygen evolution following the addition of Na2CO3 (Fig. 7), which would indicate the decomposition of peroxo-species. This observation suggests that formation of peroxo-species may not be the primary deactivation mechanism, but rather TiO2 itself may indeed act as an electron donor in the absence of a hole scavenger, leading to the formation of inactive mixed valence states as Abe et al. [9] suggest. It should be recognized, however, that the decomposition of peroxo-species may occur rapidly following the addition of Na2CO3, making it impossible to distinguish between excess oxygen arising from opening the system to add Na2CO3 and that evolved due to the destabilization and decomposition of peroxo-species on the TiO2 surface."
20,Over-stoichiometry,"3.8 Over-stoichiometry It was observed that for all experiments using the Na2CO3 additive the stoichiometric ratio of the evolved hydrogen and oxygen exceeded the expected ratio of 2 during the initial hours of operation. The stoichiometric ratio eventually settled to a ratio of 2 during steady state operation. As seen in Fig. 8 A, the H2/O2 ratio reached a maximum after 2–2.5h of operation, with the exception being that for experiments employing 120g of photocatalyst particles. It was observed that for high photocatalyst loadings at 120g (which correspond with low recirculation flow rates) the over-stoichiometric peak is not observed until after 5h of operation and is less pronounced than that of the peaks observed for lower photocatalyst loadings (with correspondingly higher recirculation flow rates). To ascertain whether the over-stoichiometric effect is photo-induced, the UV lamp was extinguished for a period of time. As observed in Fig. 8B, when the UV lamp was extinguished for a period of 3h and then reignited, the H2/O2 ratio almost instantaneously returned to its previous state and continued to settle toward the theoretical ratioof 2. Moreover, it was observed that the lamp could be extinguished at any time during this initial induction period for an arbitrary amount of time, and the same behavior would continue once the lamp was reignited. These observations indicate that the underlying process through which Na2CO3 acts to prevent deactivation of the TiO2 and to yield stoichiometric evolution of H2 and O2 is a photo-induced effect and is dependent on the cumulative exposure to UV irradiation. It is of interest to note the step change observed in the H2/O2 ratio between 13.5 and 17h of operation in Fig. 8B; this was due to a slight decrease in the fluidized bed height (along with a corresponding decrease in the recirculation flow rate). The expanded bed was corrected back to a height of 24 cm (at 17h of operation) by increasing the recirculation flow rate slightly. As a slight decrease in flow rate caused an increase in the stoichiometric ratio (i.e., a decrease in oxygen evolution), it may be hypothesized that the reduced flow rate resulted in reduced mass transfer in either the fluidized bed or the gas-liquid separator, and that changes in the rate of mass transfer may effect the rates of hydrogen and oxygen evolution differently. While the cause of the observed induction period and the over-stoichiometric evolution of hydrogen cannot be fully elucidated at this time, this observation suggests that the photo-induced process may also be a function of mass transfer and the concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen dissolved in the liquid phase."
21,Conclusions,"Building on earlier research by the authors, a more detailed description and analysis of photocatalytic water splitting in a UV-irradiated fluidized bed reactor is provided for the first time. The fluidized bed reactor is shown to provide advantages over other more conventional photocatalytic reactors, making it a potentially industrially relevant approach for water splitting. Although UV irradiation was used for the fluidized bed reactor in this work, the fluidized bed approach can be used for solar irradiation or other specific regions of the solar spectrum. In this research, TiO2 photocatalyst particles that are photocatalytically active only in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum were employed; however, these TiO2 particles can be modified, or another photocatalyst material may be selected, to extend photocatalytic water-splitting activity into other spectral regions. From the results of this research, several more specific conclusions may be drawn: (1) It was observed that the effective electron diffusion length through the TiO2 bulk could be estimated by the concentration of photo-deposited platinum co-catalyst sites via D-SIMS analysis. (2) When compared to Pt-loaded, suspended slurry type photocatalysts, the fluidized photocatalyst particles yield a significant 44% increase in the apparent quantum efficiency. It is proposed that this is due, in part, to a rapid separation of the evolved H2 and O2 from Pt-loaded photocatalyst particles, as well as a reduction of Pt-loaded particles in non-irradiated regions of the system that would otherwise serve to promote the parasitic back reaction. (3) The addition of Na2CO3 plays a dramatic role in achieving efficient and steady state hydrogen evolution. It is proposed that the Na2CO3 additive improves performance and mitigates the deactivation of the TiO2 photocatalyst by serving as a hole scavenger. This in turn reduces recombination processes, destabilizes and prevents the formation of surface adsorbed peroxo-species, and/or prevents TiO2 itself from acting as an electron donor (which results in the formation of inactive mixed-valence titanium oxide species). (4) The deactivation of the TiO2 photocatalyst in pure water and the beneficial effect of Na2CO3 are both photo-induced processes that depend on the period of time for which the photocatalyst particles are irradiated by UV light."
