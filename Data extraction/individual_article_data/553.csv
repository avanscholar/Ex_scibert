0,Introduction,"The combustion of fossil fuels for electricity generation and transportation is not sustainable, with associated greenhouse gas emissions being the primary cause of global warming [1,2]. Accordingly, Governments in many countries are now firmly committed to reducing CO2 emissions [3]. For example, the European Union aims to reduce average CO2 emissions from transportation by 40 % from 130 g CO2 km−1 in 2015 to 95 g CO2 km−1 by 2020 [4,5]. For the mid-to-heavy vehicle transportation sector, hydrogen (H2) represents the logical energy carrier to replace crude oil-derived petrol and diesel. Hydrogen fuel cells efficiently transform the energy stored in H2 into electricity, representing the cornerstone technology of future “hydrogen economies”. However, the transition to a hydrogen energy infrastructure is currently not practical, since almost all H2 consumed today is produced from fossil fuels (by steam methane reforming and coal gasification) [5–9]. New and sustainable technologies must be discovered for H2 manufacture, with water splitting via electrolysis, high temperature steam electrolysis, photocatalytic water splitting, alcohol photoreforming and microbial hydrogen production representing some of the more promising pathways [10–25]. Photocatalytic water splitting and alcohol photoreforming utilize semiconductor photocatalysts to drive H2 production. Under band gap excitation by incoming photons with E > Eg (where Eg is the semiconductor band gap), electrons are promoted from the semiconductor’s valence band (VB) into the conduction band (CB), with the resulting CB electrons and VB holes migrating from the bulk of the semiconductor particle to its surface where they participate in reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. TiO2-based photocatalysts, owing to their low cost, chemical stability, photostability and excellent activity have been widely studied in relation photocatalytic H2 production from water and alcohol-water mixtures under UV irradiation [16–19,26–38]. TiO2 exists in three different polymorphic forms; anatase (Eg = 3.2 eV), brookite (Eg = 3.3 eV), and rutile (Eg = 3.0 eV), with the latter being the most thermodynamically stable of the three polymorphs. For direct photocatalytic water splitting (H2O → H2 + 1/2O2), the VB level of a semiconductor must be more positive than the O2/H2O redox couple (+0.82 V vs. NHE at pH 7), and the conduction band more negative than the H+/H2 redox couple (-0.41 V vs. NHE at pH 7). The valence and conduction band edges of anatase, rutile and brookite satisfy this requirement (VB level = +2.7, +2.7 and +2.3 V, respectively; CB level = -0.5, -0.6 and -0.7 V, respectively) [18,31,39–41]. However, the activity of pristine anatase, brookite or rutile photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting under UV irradiation is generally very low, owing to the high overpotential for H2 evolution on TiO2 surfaces. Accordingly, the surfaces of TiO2 photocatalysts are typically decorated with nanoparticles of high work function metals, such as Ni (Φ = 5.3), Pd (Φ = 5.6), Pt (Φ = 5.7) or Au (Φ = 5.3–5.6) at loadings ∼0.5−2 wt.%, which form rectifying Schottky contacts with TiO2 [42–47]. These co-catalyst nanoparticles accept conduction band electrons from TiO2, thus creating cathodic sites for H2 evolution. In spite of intensive research over the past few decades, rates of photocatalytic H2 evolution via water splitting for M/TiO2 photocatalysts (and various other semiconductor photocatalyst systems) remain low (< 1−2 mmol gcat −1 h−1 at best), and insufficient to warrant serious industry interest. The kinetics of water splitting depend on the rate at which valence band holes in TiO2 are scavenged. Therefore, to achieve higher rates of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, researchers often add a sacrificial agent (hole scavenger) into the photoreaction system, with alcohols such as methanol, ethanol of glycerol being commonly used (at alcohol concentrations typically ∼ 10 vol.%). When an alcohol is included in the system, O2 evolution is suppressed, and the overall process is referred to as alcohol photoreforming rather than water splitting. The alcohols can act as direct electron donors (hole scavengers) via adsorption on TiO2, though generally serve as indirect electron donors via reaction with hydroxyl radicals generated by water oxidation on TiO2 surfaces [19,48]. Owing to the superior hole scavenging realized in the presence of an alcohol, H2 production rates as high as 25−50 mmol gcat −1 h−1 can be realized for M/TiO2 photocatalysts under UV or full spectrum direct sunlight. Achieving such rates requires judicious choice of metal co-catalyst and also optimisation of the testing conditions. As a strategy of further improving the performance of M/TiO2 photocatalysts for alcohol reforming and other photocatalytic reactions, researchers are increasingly paying attention to the properties of the TiO2 support. As discussed above, the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions depends on the effective charge carrier concentration, in particular how effective a photocatalyst is in generating electron-hole pairs and also the ability of the charges to reach the photocatalyst surface without undergoing recombination (de-excitation) [39]. Physical properties of TiO2 photocatalysts, such as the TiO2 polymorph(s), TiO2 crystallite size, and photocatalyst morphology all influence charge generation, migration and separation, thus strongly influencing the overall activity of M/TiO2 photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming [49–55]. Recent work in the field has focussed on the morphological engineering of TiO2 for improved performance, with low dimensional titania nanowires [56,57], nanotubes [57,58], nanosheets [59–62] and nanorods [30,57,63] all reported to show enhanced performance relative to traditional 3D TiO2 nanopowder photocatalysts. A practical limitation of many of these 1D or 2D photocatalysts are their high interfacial free energies, resulting in their aggregation and loss of active surface area during storage or photocatalytic testing. To overcome this limitation, researchers are now actively exploring hierarchical photocatalyst structures, which contain 1D or 2D TiO2 components organized into more complex 3D architectures. Such hierarchical titania systems frequently demonstrate outstanding properties for photocatalytic H2 evolution [54,56–59,61,63,64]. 3D flower-like nanostructures, with 1 D or 2 D nanostructured components as “petals”, are particular promising in this regard [50,51,54,64–73]. Haider et al. compared the performance of hierarchical TiO2 (3D-HTiO2), 1D/3D hybrid hierarchical (HHC) and 3D hierarchical protonated titanate microspheres (3DHPTMS) for H2 production in methanol-water mixtures under UV irradiation [65]. A 1 wt.% Pt/3D-HTiO2 photocatalyst afforded a H2 production rate of 1.31 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% methanol, with its superior activity relative to the other photocatalysts tested being rationalized in terms of its high surface area and thus enhanced ability to generate charge carriers. Gao et al. prepared a series of graphene-oxide/TiO2 composite microspheres, then evaluated their performance for photocatalytic H2 production in aqueous methanol under UV irradiation [67]. A 3 wt.% GO/TiO2 microsphere photocatalyst afforded a hydrogen production rate of 6.112 mmol g−1 h−1 in a 10 vol.% methanol-water mixture under irradiation from a mercury lamp (254 nm, 5.4 mW cm-2), which was more than three times higher than that of a reference 3 wt.% GO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst under the same testing conditions. Zhang et al. prepared a series of hierarchical TiO2 microspheres rich in (001) and (101) TiO2 facets via a facile hydrothermal method, with the fraction of (001) facets ranging from 85 to 45 % [73]. After functionalisation with a Pt co-catalyst (1 wt.% Pt), the TiO2 microspheres containing 45 % (001) facets afforded the highest H2 production rate (5.841 mmol g−1 h−1) in 20 vol.% methanol under UV irradiation, with this rate being more than 5 times that of a 1 wt.% Pt/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst (∼1.000 mmol g−1 h−1). Ding et al. used a solvothermal method to synthesize TiO2 hierarchical spheres (THS) [68]. A 1 wt.% Pt/THS photocatalyst afforded an impressive hydrogen production rate of 17.9 mmol g−1 h−1 in 30 vol.% CH3OH under UV irradiation (350 nm), with a high quantum yield of 28.46 %. Such studies demonstrate the benefits of hierarchically structured TiO2 photocatalysts over conventional TiO2 nanopowder photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming. Since the activity of TiO2 photocatalysts is highly depending on the TiO2 polymorph, crystallite size and exposed facets, simple calcination treatments can be very effective in tuning TiO2 photocatalyst performance in alcohol photoreforming and other photoreactions. This inspired a detailed investigation of the effect of calcination treatments on the performance of hierarchical TiO2 nanoflower (TNF) photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming. In this work, hierarchical TiO2 nanoflowers were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method, then calcined at different temperatures (T = 300−800 ℃) for specific periods of time (t = 1−5 h). The obtained TNF-T-1 photocatalysts were subsequently functionalized with Au nanoparticles (Au loading =1.5 wt.%), after which the performance of the resulting Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming under UV irradiation systematically evaluated. The objectives of the study were 3-fold; (i) to investigate the effect of different calcination treatments on the physico-chemical properties of the hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanoflowers; (ii) to evaluate the activity of the various Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts for H2 production in 10 vol.% glycerol-water and 10 vol.% ethanol-water mixtures; (iii) to benchmark the performance of Au/TNF-T-t photocatalysts against selected reference photocatalysts, including a 1.5 wt.% Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst. We selected ethanol and glycerol as the alcohol sacrificial agents for the current study, since both are renewable biofuels. The overarching aim of the study was to probe the key advantages of hierarchical Au/TiO2 photocatalysts over conventional Au/TiO2 nanopowder photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Glacial acetic acid (≥99.7 %), titanium butoxide (97 %), titanium isopropoxide (97 %), 2-propanol (99.5 %), absolute ethanol (≥ 99.8 %), glycerol (≥ 99 %), urea (≥ 99.5 %), HAuCl4·3H2O (99 %) and Evonik P25 TiO2 were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared using milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity)."
3,TiO2 nanoflower (TNF) synthesis,"2.2 TiO2 nanoflower (TNF) synthesis TiO2 nanoflowers (TNFs) were synthesised using a literature method [66]. Briefly, titanium butoxide (5 mL) was added dropwise to 150 mL of glacial acetic acid under constant stirring. Following stirring for 10 min at room temperature, the white suspension obtained was transferred to an autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 14 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with milli-Q water and ethanol, then finally dried at 60 °C overnight. The obtained nanoflowers are denoted herein as TNF-AP."
4,TNF-T-t photocatalyst synthesis,2.3 TNF-T-t photocatalyst synthesis The TNF-T-t photocatalysts were prepared by calcining TNF-AP at various temperatures (T = 300−800 °C) for different periods of time (t = 1−5 h).
5,Anatase SG and anatase HT syntheses,"2.4 Anatase SG and anatase HT syntheses Several anatase reference photocatalysts were also synthesized. An anatase sol-gel photocatalyst (anatase SG) was prepared by the hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide in 2-propanol, followed by calcination at 475 °C for 4 h. Detailed characterisation data for the anatase SG photocatalyst is provided in reference [47]. A further anatase based photocatalyst with a smaller anatase crystallite size was prepared using a similar method, except that the calcination step was replaced by the hydrothermal treatment at 160 °C for 16 h in an ethanol-water mixture (2:1 by volume). The resulting anatase HT photocatalysts was dried in air at 100 °C. Relevant characterisation data for the anatase HT photocatalyst is also provided in reference [49]."
6,Preparation of Au/TNF-T-t and the Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts,"2.5 Preparation of Au/TNF-T-t and the Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts Au/TNF-T-t and Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts (based on P25 TiO2, anatase SG or anatase HT supports) were prepared using the deposition-precipitation with urea method developed by Zanella et al., with some modifications. [74]. A 4.2 mM HAuCl4·3H2O stock solution (1 L) was first prepared. Next, a titania support (2 g), gold stock solution (37.5 mL), urea (5.04 g) and milli-Q water (162.5 mL) were added to a 500 mL glass Schott bottle, which was then heated under constant stirring at 80 °C for 8 h. The obtained pale yellow powders (containing Au(OH)3 on TiO2) were collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with milli-Q, then air dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the powders were then calcined at 300 °C for 2 h in static air to reduce surface Au3+ to Au°."
7,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.6 Photocatalyst characterization A Philips XL-30 field emission gun scanning electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV was used for SEM analyses. Backscattered electron (BSE) images were also obtained on the same instrument using a higher accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Before analysis, the samples were lightly platinum sputter coated to reducing specimen charging during analysis. The instrument was also equipped with EDX capabilities, permitting semi-quantitative elemental analyses. TEM and STEM images were collected on a Tecnai G2 F20 TWIN transmission electron microscope, operated at an electron accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XRF data was taken on a Siemens SRS3000 spectrometer. Samples were supported on Mylar films for the measurements. Powder XRD patterns were collected on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer, equipped with a monochromated Cu Kα X-ray source (λ =1.5418 Å). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the anatase (101) reflection at 2θ = 25.3° and rutile (110) reflection at 2θ = 27.4° were used for crystallite size determination by the Scherrer method. The equation below was sued to estimate the rutile content in mixed TiO2 polymorph samples [75]. % R u t i l e = 1 1 + 0.8 ( I A / I R ) × 100 IA/ IR is the peak intensity ratio for the anatase (101) and rutile (110) reflections. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller(BET) specific surface areas [76] were calculated from the N2 physisorption data collected at 77 K on a Micromeritics TriStar II PLUS instrument. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method [77] was used to extract cumulative pore volumes and pore diameters from the adsorption data. Samples were prepared for analysis by heating at 100 °C for 1 h before the N2 physisorption measurements. UV–vis absorbance spectra were acquired on Shimadzu UV-2600 PC spectrophotometer with an ISR-240A integrating sphere attachment. Barium sulphate was used as the reflectance standard. Photoluminescence spectra were collected for the different TiO2 photocatalysts in air over the range 330−600 nm (λex =310 nm) on a JASCO 8600 Spectrometer. Ti 2p, O 1s and Au 4f XPS data were collected using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The core level scans were obtained at a hemispherical energy analyser pass energy of 20 eV, survey spectra at a pass energy of 80 eV. The C 1s signal at 285.0 eV from adventitious hydrocarbons was used for binding energy scale calibration. Ti L2,3-edge and O K-edge NEXAFS data were collected on the Soft X-ray Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. NEXAFS data were taken in the drain current mode, with drain current data for the sample being normalized against the current on a gold mesh in the beamline (thus eliminating artefacts arising from variations in beam intensity during data collection)."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests,"2.7 Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests Alcohol photoreforming tests were carried out in tubular Pyrex reactor (105 mL volume). The reactor was charged with photocatalyst (6.5 mg), then purged for 30 min under an N2 flow. Next, 20 mL of an alcohol-water mixture (10 vol.% glycerol or 10 vol.% ethanol) was injected into the reactor through a rubber septum. After stirring in the dark for 1 h to ensure a good photocatalyst dispersion, the reactor was irradiated with a UV lamp (Spectraline model SB-100 P/F lamp, 365 nm, 10 cm from the reactor, 6.5 mW cm−2). At 20 min intervals over a 3 h period, gas headspace samples were collected and the amount of H2 evolved quantified using a Shimadzu GC 2014 fitted with a TCD detector and Carboxen-1010 plot capillary column. Photocatalytic tests were carried out in triplicate for each sample."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of the Au/TNF-T-t photocatalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the Au/TNF-T-t photocatalysts Fig. S1 shows SEM images for the as-prepared TiO2 nanoflowers (TNF-AP), obtained by the hydrothermal treatment of Ti(IV) butoxide in glacial acetic acid at 140 ℃ for 16 h. The nanoflowers were spherical, with diameters ranging from 2 to 6 μm (average diameter ∼4.5 μm). Each nanoflower consists of hundreds of very thin 2D nanosheets radiating out from its centre. The nanosheet thickness were estimated to be <10 nm. The data in Fig. S1 confirmed that nanoflowers possessed a hierarchical 2D-3D structure. Powder XRD showed the nanoflowers to be crystalline (data not shown), evidenced by an intense feature at 2θ = 7.7°. This suggested the nanoflowers were composed of a layered Ti(IV) oxo-acetate complex. The metal organic framework MIL-125, containing dicarboxylate ligands and cyclic octamers comprising corner- or edge-sharing octahedral Ti(IV) titanium units connected to oxygen atoms, shows a similar XRD peak at ∼7.6°, lending support to this argument [78]. Fig. 1 shows SEM images for different Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts. The Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 300–700 ℃) photocatalysts all possessed a similar nanoflower morphology to TNF-AP. As the calcination temperature increased in the range 300–700 ℃ (Fig. 1(a)–(e)), petals in the nanoflowers thickened and became more porous (i.e. visible pores developed in the 2D petals), which is attributable to thermal sintering and grain growth of the anatase TiO2 crystallites in the nanopetals. For the Au/TFT-800-1 photocatalyst, very large TiO2 crystallites could be seen by SEM (Fig. 1(f)), indicating that TiO2 nanoparticle sintering in the petals of the nanoflowers was severe at 800 ℃ (XRD analysis below shows that the large nanoparticles formed at 800 ℃ were rutile). Backscattered electron (BSE) images for various Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . In the BSE mode, gold nanoparticles (Z = 79) will cause more backscattering of electrons than the Ti (Z = 22) or O (Z = 8) in the TiO2 support, thus the Au nanoparticles appear as white spots on a grey background. The BSE images for the various Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts (especially those collected at 100,000× magnification), reveal a very uniform distribution of small Au nanoparticles over all the photocatalysts. The Au nanoparticles are harder to discern for the Au/TNF-800-1 photocatalyst (Fig. 2(g) and (h)), owing to the large size of the TiO2 nanocrystals in the support, though were clearly present (see lower right corner of Fig. 2(h)). The data in Fig. 2 reveals that 1) Au nanoparticles were successfully loaded on the various TNF-T-1 supports; and 2) the hierarchical 2D-3D structure of the TNF-T-1 supports was not affected by the Au nanoparticle deposition process. XRF and EDX were applied to examine the Au loadings in all the Au/TNF-T-1 and Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts. In all photocatalysts, the experimentally determined Au loadings (Table 1 ) closely matched the nominal Au loading of 1.5 wt.%. As expected, XRF was more accurate than EDX in estimating the Au loading, but both sets of data were in fair accord. Alcohol photoreforming tests below indicated that the Au/TNF-600-1 photocatalyst was the most active amongst the various Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts synthesized in the current study. Accordingly, the Au/TNF-600-1 was subjected to detailed characterization by transmission electron microscopy, with a selection of TEM images for the sample shown in Fig. 3 . At low magnification (Fig. 3(a)), the 2D-3D hierarchical structure of the TNF-600-1 support is revealed, whilst at higher magnification 4−8 nm sized Au nanoparticles can readily be discerned and supported by anatase nanocrystals (Fig. 3(b)). The Au nanoparticles are fairly uniform in size and well-distributed over the TiO2 support which was expected to be beneficial for alcohol photoreforming. Fig. 3(c)–(f) show TEM images for a single 2D petal of Au/TNF-600-1. The images show that the petals are highly porous, and composed of layers of thin anatase nanosheets. The individual nanosheets are estimated 5 nm or less in thickness. Fig. 3(f) shows a single Au nanoparticle strongly adhering to the anatase nanosheets. Results in Figs. 1–3 suggest that at low calcination temperatures, the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts contain anatase nanosheets, which transition to anisotropic lozenge-like anatase nanocrystals at 600–700 ℃, then finally 3D spherical rutile nanoparticles at 800 ℃. Powder XRD was applied to study the evolution in TNF-T-1 support composition, and anatase and rutile crystallite sizes, as a function of the support calcination temperature (T). For the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts (T = 300–600 ℃), anatase was the only TiO2 phase identified in the support (Fig. 4 ). The Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalyst contained 99 wt.% anatase and 1 wt.% rutile, whilst the Au/TNF-800-1 photocatalyst was predominantly rutile (90 wt.% rutile). As the support calcination temperature increased in the range 300−800 ℃, the FWHM of the anatase peaks decreased (see Fig. S2), indicating a corresponding increase in the anatase crystallite size. Anatase crystallite sizes estimated the FWHM of the anatase (101) reflections for each sample using the Scherrer equation are summarized in Table 1, and ranged from 12 nm for Au/TNF-300-1 to 84 nm for Au/TNF-800-1. The rutile crystallites in Au/TNF-800-1 were estimated to be about 189 nm (using the FWHM of the rutile (110) peak), in decent agreement with the size of the large nanoparticles seen by SEM in Fig. 1(f)). Results suggest that the onset of the anatase-rutile phase transition in the petals of the nanoflowers is ∼700 ℃, when anatase crystallite sizes exceed 50 nm. A weak, and very broad Au(200) reflection at 44.3° was observed for most of the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts, confirming the presence small Au nanoparticles with a face-centred cubic structure. The more intense Au(111) reflection at 38.1° overlapped with peaks from the TiO2 support phases, and thus was not able to be used here to verify the presence of supported metallic Au nanoparticles. XPS was used to probe the valence state of titanium and gold in the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts. Ti 2p XPS spectra for the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 5 (a). Peaks at 458.8 eV and 464.3 eV in a 2:1 area ratio were observed for all samples, corresponding to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 signals of Ti4+ in TiO2 [79]. Similarly, the Ti L2,3-edge and O K-edge NEXAFS data for the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts (Fig. S3) were also similar, showing the presence of Ti4+ in an octahedral coordination. The Ti L3 and L2 regions involve excitation of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 electrons, respectively, into unoccupied Ti 3d and Ti 3d-O 2p hybrid orbitals, making the L-edge spectra sensitive to both titanium oxidation state and cation coordination environment (i.e. crystal field about titanium cations). As the calcination temperature increased in the range 300–700 ℃ (i.e. as the anatase crystallite size increased), the octahedral coordination sphere around the Ti4+ became increasingly distorted due to crystal lattice packing effects, lifting the degeneracy of the L3 and L2 dz2 and dx2-y2 levels, resulting in a clear splitting of these levels in the Ti L-edge spectra. The O K-edge spectra for the TNF-T-1 photocatalysts were all similar, and dominated by signals arising from excitation of O 1s electrons into Ti 3d-O 2p and Ti 4sp-O 2p hybrid orbitals of a TiO2. Au 4f XPS (Fig. 5(b) confirmed that all the Au//TNF-T-1 photocatalysts contained metallic Au nanoparticles, evidenced by Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 signals at 83.1 and 86.7 eV, respectively, in a characteristic 4:3 area ratio [79]. TiO2 supported gold nanoparticles have slightly lower binding energies than bulk metallic gold (Au 4f7/2 = 84.0 eV), due to electron transfer from the support [80]. The Au 4f:Ti 2p peak area ratio increased on going from Au/TNF-300-1 to Au/TNF-800-1, whereas XRF and EDX analyses had established that all Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts had a similar Au loading. The Au 4f:Ti 2p peak area ratio increase seen be XPS is explained by the surface sensitivity of the XPS technique (probing only the top few nanometres in each sample. As the calcination temperature (T) increased, the TNF-T-1 photocatalysts progressively lost surface area (Table 1) due to TiO2 nanocrystal sintering (as seen in Figs. 1 and 2). Accordingly, at a fixed Au loading of 1.5 wt.%, there will be more Au nanoparticles per unit area on going from Au/TNF-300-1 to Au/TNF-800-1, thus intensifying the Au 4f:Ti 2p peak area ratio (in perfect agreement with the experimental data in Fig. 5). The presence of metallic Au nanoparticles on the surface of the various Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts was evident from their colour (Fig. 6 (a)). All had a distinctive purple-grey or purple colour, owing the localised surface plasmon resonance of supported Au° nanoparticles [81–85]. The LSPR wavelength of Au nanoparticles on TiO2 photocatalysts is sensitive to the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium (thus anatase crystallite size), Au nanoparticle size and shape, and strength of the metal-support interaction, thus explaining why the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts showed some optical variation [81–85]. Fig. 6(b) shows absorbance spectra and Tauc plots for the different Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts. Band gaps determined from the Tauc plot are listed in Table 1. The Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 300–700 ℃) photocatalysts all had band gaps ∼3.2–3.3 eV, consistent with anatase being the dominant TiO2 polymorph in these samples. For Au/TNF-800-1 the absorption edge was redshifted by ∼0.3 eV, due to predominance of rutile (Eg = 3.0 eV) [40,86]. All the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts showed an intense LSPR absorption feature at visible wavelengths, thus explaining the purple-grey or purple colours of the photocatalysts. For Au/TNF-300-1, the LSPR feature was broad and centered at 618 nm (Table 1). As the calcination temperature (T) used to prepare the TNF-T-1 supports increased up to 700 ℃, the Au LSPR feature became sharper and blue-shifted. This coincided with a concomitant increase in the size of anatase crystallites in TNF-T-1 support. Results demonstrate the sensitivity of the Au LSPR to anatase crystallite size (Fig. S2. showed that the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts had similar Au particle sizes, thus eliminating that as the cause of the LSPR blue-shift). For TNF-800-1 (90 % rutile), the LSPR feature red-shifted and again became very broad, which is explained by the higher refractive index of the rutile support (rutile, n = 2.61; anatase, n = 2.49). Previous studies have shown that Au LSPRs redshift as the refractive index of the surrounding medium increases [85]. The decoration of TiO2 with gold nanoparticles serves two main purposes during alcohol photoreforming: 1) the Au nanoparticles act as electron sinks, accepting conduction band electrons from TiO2 and thus suppressing electron-hole pair recombination in TiO2; and 2) the Au nanoparticles act as hydrogen evolution sites. In Fig. 7 , the effectiveness of Au nanoparticle deposition in suppressing electron-hole pair recombination in the TNF-T-1 photocatalysts is explored. The TNF-T-1 (T = 300–700 ℃) photocatalysts all photoluminesced strongly in air under 310 nm excitation, due the radiative recombination of electrons and holes (i.e. electrons dropping from the conduction band back to the valence band). For TNF-800-1, the emission maximum was red-shifted relative to the other TNF-T-1 photocatalysts due to the predominance of rutile in that sample. After decoration with 1.5 wt.% Au, the photoluminescence intensity of all samples was significantly reduced, confirming the formation of rectifying Schottky junctions which suppressed electron-hole pair recombination in TiO2. Table 1 lists the PL decrease on adding Au for each Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalyst. For most Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts, the decrease was >50 %. In order to benchmark the performance of the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming, we also prepared several 1.5 wt.% Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts using Evonik P25 TiO2, sol-gel synthesized anatase (anatase SG) and hydrothermally grown anatase (anatase HT) as supports. Detailed characterization data for these Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts is provided in Figs. S4–S7, and summarized in Table 1. The Au particle size (by TEM) and Au loading (by XRF) in the Au/TNF-T-1 and Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts were similar, thus allowing for meaningful performance benchmarking (i.e. with the properties of the TiO2 support being the key parameter influencing photocatalyst activity)."
11,Alcohol photoreforming performance of the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts and reference Au/TiO2 photocatalysts,"3.2 Alcohol photoreforming performance of the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts and reference Au/TiO2 photocatalysts The photocatalytic performance of the Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 300−800 ℃) and Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts were evaluated first evaluated in 10 vol.% glycerol-water mixtures under UV excitation (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2). Plots of H2 production versus time for the various Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8 (a). The plots for all photocatalysts were linear, indicating that the photocatalysts were stable under the applied testing conditions. Catalyst mass normalised hydrogen production rates (in mmol g-1 h-1) and surface area normalised H2 production rates (in mmol m−2 h-1) determined from the plots in Fig. 8(a) are shown in Fig. 10 and listed in Table 1. Fig. 8(b) shows that the H2 production rates (in mmol g-1 h-1) for the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts increased with support calcination temperature (T) up to 600 ℃, then dropped off sharply at higher calcination temperatures. The Au/TNF-600-1 photocatalyst afforded a H2 production rate (32.1 mmol g-1 h-1) in 10 vol.% glycerol, which is one the highest rates of H2 production yet reported for an Au/TiO2 photocatalyst under UV photoexcitation [30,49,63,87]. Further, Au/TNF-500-1 and Au/TNF-600-1 offered superior performance to Au/P25 TiO2 and the two Au/anatase reference photocatalysts for glycerol photoreforming (Figs. 9(a), 10 , Table 1), with H2 production rates (in mmol g-1 h-1) following the order Au/TNF-600-1 ≈ Au/TNF-500-1 > Au/P25 TiO2 ≈ Au/TNF-700-1 ≈ Au/TNF-400-1 > Au/anatase SG ≈ Au/anatase HT > Au/TNF-800-1. For the Au/TNF-T-t photocatalysts, the area normalised H2 production rates (in mmol m−2 h-1) increased continuously on going from Au/TNF-300-1 to Au/TNF-800-1 (Fig. 8(b), Table 2), reflecting the subtle interplay between photocatalyst specific surface area, crystallite size and polymorphic composition in controlling electron-hole pair separation and surface reaction kinetics, processes which ultimately dictate overall alcohol photoreforming kinetics. Area normalised H2 production rates for Au/TNF-600-1 (0.634 mmol m−2 h-1) and Au/TNF-700-1 (0.763 mmol m−2 h-1) were superior to those of Au/P25 TiO2 (0.609 mmol m−2 h-1), Au/anatase SG (0.394 mmol m−2 h-1) and Au/anatase HT (0.136 mmol m−2 h-1). The comparison between Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/P25 TiO2 is especially interesting. Numerous literature studies have shown that Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts strongly outperform Au/anatase and Au/rutile photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming under UV excitation [30,49,63,87], due to efficient electron-hole pair separation across the anatase-rutile heterojunctions in P25 TiO2 (which enhances the concentration of CB electrons and VB holes available for surface photoreactions). Here, Au/TNF-600-1 (a 100 % anatase photocatalyst) outperformed Au/P25 TiO2 for glycerol photoreforming, on both a per mass of catalyst and per area of catalyst basis. This implied that the porous 2D anatase nanosheets in the petals of Au/TNF-600-1 (Fig. 3) were very efficient in the separating photo-generated electrons and holes (on par or better than the charge separation in mixed phase P25 TiO2). This result in somewhat intuitive, since low dimensional photocatalysts, such as 1D nanowires or 2D nanosheets [56,57,59,61,62], frequently demonstrate excellent photocatalytic activities relative to their 3D counterparts, owing to the very short electron and hole diffusion paths to the surface in such low dimension systems (i.e. bulk charge recombination is reduced in low dimensional systems). The superior glycerol photoreforming activity of Au/TNF-600-1 (containing 2D anatase nanosheets) relative to Au/anatase SG and Au/anatase HT photocatalysts (containing 3D anatase nanoparticles of mean diameters 25 and 12 nm, respectively, Tables 1 and 2 ) adds strong weight to this argument. To confirm that the enhanced alcohol photoreforming activity of Au/TNF-600-1 was universal, further H2 production experiments were conducted in 10 vol.% ethanol-water mixtures. The photocatalysts selected for these addition experiments were Au/TNF-600-1, Au/TNF-700-1 and the three Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts (i.e. Au/P25 TiO2, Au/anatase SG and Au/anatase HT. Results of the ethanol photoreforming tests are shown in Fig. 9(b), Fig. 10 and Table 2. From the data, several key points emerge. Firstly, the Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts had comparable activity for ethanol photoreforming under UV. Secondly, the Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts were about twice as active (in mmol g−1 h−1) as Au/P25 TiO2 for ethanol photoreforming, and ∼3.5 times as active as the Au/anatase reference photocatalysts (Fig. 10). The data confirms the universal superiority of Au/TNF-600-1 for alcohol photoreforming. Interestingly, for the Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts, rates of H2 production during ethanol photoreforming tests were 74.1 % and 86.5 %, respectively, of rates achieved during the glycerol photoreforming tests (note: previous studies have confirmed glycerol is a better sacrificial agent than ethanol for alcohol photoreforming, accounting for the higher rates achieved here in aqueous glycerol [30,49,63,87,88]). Conversely, for the Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts, including Au/P25 TiO2, rates of H2 production during ethanol photoreforming tests were all < 50 % of rates achieved during the glycerol photoreforming tests. The reason why the Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts offered such special performance for ethanol photo-oxidation is currently unclear, though likely relates to the different TiO2 surface states of the “working” photocatalysts. Zeta potential measurements determined the isoelectric points (IEPs) of the TNF-600-1, TNF-700-1, P25 TiO2, anatase SG and anatase HT supports to be 4.5, 4.3, 5.9, 5.8 and 5.7, respectively. Accordingly, under conditions of the alcohol photoreforming tests in the current work (pH ∼5), the surfaces of the TNF-T-1 photocatalysts will have a net negative charge, whereas P25 TiO2, anatase SG and anatase HT will have a net positive surface charge. The modest negative charge on surface of the TNF-600-1 and TNF-700-1 photocatalysts thus may have contributed to their enhanced performance for alcohol photoreforming (for example by attracting aqueous protons towards the photocatalyst for reduction on Au0 sites). However, further work is needed to pinpoint the exact reason why the Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts, containing 2D anatase nanosheets, were especially active for ethanol photoreforming. Percentage quantum efficiencies (QE%) calculated for glycerol photoreforming and ethanol photoreforming on the Au/TNF-600-1, Au/TNF-700-1 and Au/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts are provided on pages 9 and 10 of the supporting information. Data for the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts compares favourably with the best QE efficiencies reported to date for glycerol and ethanol photoreforming over Au/TiO2 photocatalysts under UV irradiation [88–92]. It is worth noting that the Au/TNF-T-t photocatalysts were very stable under the conditions of the alcohol photoreforming tests, both structurally and chemically. Repeat alcohol photoreforming tests on the Au/TNF-600-1 photocatalyst showed no loss in activity over 5 successive 3 h test cycles (results not shown). Further, SEM and TEM analyses revealed that the 2D-3D structure of the nanoflowers, the Au particle size distribution and the phase composition of TiO2 were all unaffected by the tests (results not shown)."
12,Alcohol photoreforming performance of Au/TNF-700-t photocatalysts,"3.3 Alcohol photoreforming performance of Au/TNF-700-t photocatalysts Since anatase-rutile heterojunctions can be beneficial for improving M/TiO2 photocatalyst performance for alcohol photoreforming [30,49,63,87], a further series TiO2 nanoflower supports (TNF-700-t) were prepared by extending the calcination time (t) at 700 ℃ from 1 to 5 h. Detailed characterization data for the Au/TNF-700-t photocatalysts is provided in Table 1, Table 2 and Figs. S8–S13. As the TNF calcination time at 700 ℃ was increased from 1 h to 5 h, the anatase fraction in the Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts decreased from 99 wt.% to 51 wt.%, with the rutile fraction increasing accordingly from 1 wt.% to 49 wt.% (Fig. S9, Table 1). BET specific surface areas for the Au/TNF-700-t photocatalysts decreased progressively with the increasing rutile fraction (Table 1). Fig. S8 shows backscattered electron (BSE) images for several Au/TNF-700-3 nanoflowers. The images show that the sample contained nanoflowers at two different stages of TiO2 crystallite growth (images (a) and (b) at an earlier stage, (c) and (d) at later stage), suggesting that the onset and kinetics of the anatase-rutile transformation was not necessarily the same for all nanoflowers in a sample at 700 ℃ (this onset for this transition is known to be anatase crystal size dependent [49,63,92–95]). Au nanoparticles can easily be discerned on the surface of the Au/TNF-700-3 photocatalyst. Au 4f XPS (Fig. S10) and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S11) verified the presence of Au nanoparticles in all TNF-700-t photocatalysts, whilst photoluminescence measurements (Fig. S12) showed that the supported Au nanoparticles were effective in removing electrons from the conduction band of the TNF-700-t supports (evidenced by the suppression of radiative recombination). Glycerol photoreforming tests revealed that as the content of rutile in the TNF-700-t photocatalysts increased from 1 wt.% (TNF-700-1) to 29 wt.% (TNF-700-2), the H2 production rate (in mmol g−1 h−1) dropped sharply (Fig. S13, Table 2), then remained almost unchanged as the rutile content was increased from 29 wt.% to ∼ 50 wt.% (TNF-700-5). In summary, the introduction of rutile by prolonged calcination of the anatase nanoflowers at 700 ℃ was not beneficial for glycerol photoreforming performance. Any photocatalytic advantage that might have been gained by forming anatase-rutile heterojunctions through calcination (as is common for 3D nanopowder TiO2 systems) was negated by concomitant losses in photocatalyst surface area and massive crystallite growth (the latter destroying the unique 2D-3D hierarchical architecture of the nanoflowers)."
13,Perspective on the superior performance of the Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 500–700 ℃) photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming,"3.4 Perspective on the superior performance of the Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 500–700 ℃) photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming The Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 500–700 ℃) photocatalysts demonstrated outstanding activity for aqueous glycerol and aqueous ethanol photoreforming under UV irradiation (and especially high activity for ethanol photoreforming relative to other Au/TiO2 reference photocatalysts). Factors contributing to this remarkable activity justify discussion, as they provide the framework for improved photocatalyst design for alcohol photoreforming as well as other photoreactions which use M/TiO2 photocatalysts. Fig. 11 shows an energy level diagram and a scheme for alcohol photoreforming on a petal of Au/TNF-600-1 under UV, and serves as a useful framework for the discussion below. To begin, the Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 500–700 ℃) photocatalysts possess a 2D-3D hierarchical structural consisting of thin and porous 2D anatase nanosheets (petals) arranged in a 3D nanoflower motif. The anatase nanosheets in these photocatalysts are very thin and stacked (see Fig. 3, TNF-600-1), allowing very efficient electron-hole separation under UV excitation (i.e. very short migration paths for the charges to the photocatalyst surface, meaning that the charges are consumed by surface redox reactions instead of recombining in the bulk). Further, whilst the anatase nanosheets are thin, they are highly crystalline, thus have few defects that could act as recombination centres (calcination at temperatures ∼600–700 ℃ is beneficial for minimizing crystal defects). The large flat anatase nanosheets, together with the open 3D structure of the nanoflowers, ensured that the Au nanoparticle deposition was uniform, resulting in a high dispersion of uniformly sized (5−8 nm) Au nanoparticles. A high Au nanoparticle dispersion likely further enhanced charge separation in the Au/TNF-T-1 (T = 500–700 ℃) photocatalysts under UV. Regarding the photoexcitation of the nanoflowers, the 3D nanoflower morphology was expected to be advantageous, since UV photons not absorbed by one petal can be scattered (or transmitted) onto another petal, thus ensuring efficient electron-hole pair generation. In addition, the large diameter of the Au/TNFs (∼4−6 μm) meant they could be easily recovered by centrifugation for reuse. Repeat ethanol photoreforming tests performed using Au/TNF-600-1 showed no photocatalyst deactivation over 4 successive cycles of tests, confirming that Au/TNF-600-1 possessed excellent stability. Finally, the TNF-600-1 and TNF-700-1 supports were found to have an unusually low isoelectric point (IEP = 4.5 and 4.3, respectively) relative to the other TiO2 reference photocatalysts used here (e.g. P25 TiO2, IEP = 5.9). The IEP is important in photocatalysis, influencing both the surface charge state and hydroxyl radical generation during reaction (OH formation generally increases as the pH approaches the TiO2 IEP [96–99] due to the abundance of surface Ti−OH sites. i.e. Ti−OH + h+(VB) → OH) . Since initial pH of the 10 vol.% glycerol-water and 10 vol.% ethanol-water mixtures here for the photocatalytic tests were both around 5 (i.e. closer to the IEPs of TNF-600-1 and TNF-700-1 than P25 TiO2), it is plausible that the superior activity of the TNF-600-1 and TNF-700-1 was simply the result of enhanced OH generation (i.e. enhanced valence band hole consumption) under the conditions of the photocatalytic tests. The hydroxyl radicals generated at the surface of the anatase petals react with the aqueous alcohol to initially form alpha hydroxy radicals (potent reductants), which may then donate an electron into the conduction band of TiO2 via a process known as current doubling, thus benefitting the H2 production kinetics. In future work, we aim to evaluate the performance of Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts for alcohol photoreforming under full spectrum solar irradiation and visible-light irradiation (i.e. explore plasmonic-enhanced photocatalytic phenomena in the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts). In addition, we aim to identify the reason why the Au/TNF-T-1 photocatalysts were so active for ethanol photoreforming relative to other Au/TiO2 photocatalysts (Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 were more than 2 times more active than Au/P25 TiO2 for ethanol photoreforming under UV)."
14,Conclusion,"1.5 wt.% Au/TNF-T-t photocatalysts, possessing a 2D-3D hierarchical nanoflower morphology, offered outstanding performance for glycerol and ethanol photoreforming under UV irradiation. By controlling the calcination temperature (T) and time (t) during the preparation of the TNF-T-t photocatalyst supports, the photocatalytic properties of Au/TNF-T-t could be precisely tuned to maximize H2 production. Amongst the various photocatalysts prepared in this work, the Au/TNF-500-1, Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 offered the best activity for glycerol and ethanol photoreforming, outperforming Au/P25 TiO2 and various Au/anatase nanopowder reference photocatalysts under the applied testing conditions (10 vol.% alcohol, 365 nm excitation). The activity of Au/TNF-600-1 (23.8 mmol g−1 h−1) and Au/TNF-700-1 (24.3 mmol g−1 h-1) for ethanol photoreforming was twice that of Au/P25 TiO2 (12.1 mmol g−1 h−1), though the superiority of the Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts was more modest relative to Au/P25 TiO2 for glycerol photoreforming. The excellent activity of the Au/TNF-500-1, Au/TNF-600-1 and Au/TNF-700-1 photocatalysts can be largely attributed to the very thin and crystalline anatase nanosheets contained with the petals of the TiO2 nanoflower supports (thickness ∼5 nm for Au/TNF-600-1), which meant that the distance that photoexcited electrons and holes had to travel to reach the photocatalyst surface was short, thus minimizing bulk recombination of charges. The TNF-600-1 and TNF-700-1 supports were also found to have low isoelectric points (IEP = 4.5 and 4.3, respectively; cf. P25 TiO2, IEP = 5.9), which may have further enhanced their alcohol photoreforming performance. The presence of rutile in the TNF-T-t supports, achieved through long calcination treatments (2−5 h) at 700 ℃ or calcination at 800 ℃ for 1 h, was detrimental to H2 production. Results encourage wider investigation of hierarchically structured photocatalysts in alcohol photoreforming and other photoreactions."
