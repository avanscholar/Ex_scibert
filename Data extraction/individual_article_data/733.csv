0,Introduction,"Vanadium oxides and molybdenum oxides are one of the most frequently used catalytic materials in industrial chemical processes, such as partial oxidations of hydrocarbons and alcohols, dehydration of alcohols, de-NO x reaction and so forth. In most of the cases of these catalytic reactions, the oxidation states of V and Mo under working conditions are either the highest or slightly reduced, but much reduced states like V3+ and Mo4+ are quite rare in any metal oxide forms under catalytically working states. Recently, we found that ethanol conversion can catalytically proceed over highly reduced vanadium oxides and molybdenum oxides, particularly over V2O3 and MoO2 oxides and that the reaction selectively produces ethane and acetaldehyde in equimolar amounts [1]. This reaction itself and catalytic function of low valence V and Mo in metal oxides seem quite unique in catalysis and interesting in terms of reaction mechanism. Formation of alkanes from aliphatic alcohols has been little studied in contrast to extensive studies of catalytic dehydration and dehydrogenation of alcohols. A few research results, however, have been reported for the formation so far. They showed that the formation of alkanes from corresponding alcohols mostly occurs via either direct hydrogenation of the alcohols or alkenes formed by dehydration of the alcohols with hydrogen that was formed by dehydrogenation of the alcohols [2–4]. Cd–Cr–O [2] and 12-molybdophosphate [3] catalysts were reported to form ethane from ethanol via hydrogenation of ethylene, on the basis of that the selectivity to ethane increased with decrease of the selectivity to ethylene. Lobo et al. also showed that propane could be formed via hydrogenation of 1-propanol over Pt supported catalysts (Pt/TiO2, CeO2, Al2O3) [4]. There seems other possible formation mechanisms of alkanes from alcohols. For example, Mohamed et al. reported that ethane and methane were formed as major products from ethanol over Fe ion-exchanged mordenite. They explained that the preferential formation of alkanes was due to the O-abstracting affinity of Fe3+ [5]. Ochoa et al. also reported that ethane, acetaldehyde and water were observed at low temperature on TPD profiles in the ethanol reaction over ferrite catalyst [6] They proposed that ethane was formed via disproportionation of ethanol or coupling of methyl species formed by dissociation of acetaldehyde. Jin et al. found that butane was formed from 1-, 2-butanols over Fe2O3, Fe2O3–ZrO2 and Fe2O3–ZnO. On the basis of hydrogen effect over Fe2O3–ZrO2, they concluded that formation of butane from butanol was via nucleophilic substitution (SN2) of hydroxyl group of alcohols by a hydride ion [7]. In the case of aromatic alcohol reaction like benzyl alcohol, there are several research reports on equimolar formation of toluene and benzyl aldehyde. Jayamani et al. and Ganesan et al. reported that toluene and benzaldehyde were produced in an equal amount from benzyl alcohol over alumina catalyst [8–10] and Ganesan et al. proposed that the disproportionation of di-benzyl ether is a pathway to form the toluene and benzaldehyde in a 1:1 ratio in addition to a direct disproportionation of benzyl alcohol. Moreover, they also proposed that the reaction mechanism is a hydride transfer reaction from one surface benzyloxy species to a neighboring one. Mathew et al. reported that the conversion of benzyl alcohol to toluene and benzaldehyde occurred over molybdenum supported Al(OH)3 [11,12]. ABB′O3 (A=Ba, B=Pb, Ce, Ti and B′=Bi, Cu, Sb)-type perovskite oxides [13] and Au–Pd nanoparticle [14,15] are also found active for the reaction. In the case of the former, hydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to form toluene was proposed, while in the latter Hutching's group proposed a disproportionation of benzyl alcohol as a main pathway to form toluene and benzaldehyde since Au–Pd led to the equimolar formation of toluene and benzaldehyde in benzyl alcohol reaction under He. Among the catalytic systems mentioned above, 12-molybdophosphate [3], Pt-supported catalysts [4] are the unique cases that simultaneously produced equivalent amounts of alkanes and aldehydes from aliphatic alcohols, although some other products were formed along with them and the proposed reaction mechanisms are still controversial. In addition, it seems have been considered that higher oxidation states of metal elements in the case of oxide catalysts favor the alkane formation. Meanwhile, our results reported recently using vanadium oxides and molybdenum oxides as catalysts for ethanol conversion evidently showed that equivalent amounts of alkanes and aldehydes were formed from corresponding alcohols as main products without H2 formation and clarified that lower oxidation states of metal elements in these oxide catalysts are active for the equimolar formation [1]. Apparently vanadium oxides and molybdenum oxides in low valence states are now one of the representative catalysts for equimolar formation of alkanes and aldehydes from corresponding alcohols. In order to further confirm the simultaneous formation of equivalent amounts of alkanes and aldehydes and to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism for the reaction, we conducted the reaction under different conditions and kinetic analysis. Here in this report, an intermolecular hydrogen-transfer dehydration of aliphatic alcohols will be described based on observed results."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation V2O5 was prepared by the calcination of NH4VO3 (99% Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 773K for 2h in air. V2O3 was then prepared by the reduction of the prepared V2O5 (0.3g) in a tubular furnace under a H2 stream (30ml/min) at 773K for 2h. The reduced samples were then exposed to air when they cooled at room temperature before use for catalysis. MoO3 was prepared by the calcination of (NH4)6Mo7O24 (99% Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 773K for 2h in air. MoO2 was obtained by the reduction of the obtained MoO3 (0.3g) in a tubular furnace under a H2 stream (30ml/min) at 773K for 2h. Subsequently, the reduced molybdenum oxide samples were exposed to air once after they cooled at room temperature. Then the samples were treated again in a tubular furnace under a 5%H2/Ar (30ml/min) stream at 773K for 2h. Finally the reduced sample was cooled to room temperature, followed by an exposure in air. Thus obtained MoO2 was provided for catalysis."
3,Catalytic test,"2.2 Catalytic test Catalytic reactions were carried out in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor (Pyrex). A similar volume mixture of the catalyst (0.03–1.5g) and SiO2 sands (1.3–2.6g) as a diluent, which showed no catalytic activity in the alcohol reaction, was placed in the reactor and heated to a desired reaction temperature (533–633K) under a N2 flow (21.4ml/min). Then, the catalytic reaction was started by the introduction of ethanol (99.5%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) with N2 carrier into the reactor. The total flow rate of the reactant gas was kept constant (21.4ml/min) for all the reactions. Ethanol concentration was changed from 1.8–7.5mol%. The concentrations of methanol (99.8%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 1-propanol (99.5%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and 2-propanol (99.7%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) were 2.7, 1.7, and 4.3mol%, respectively. For study on kinetic isotopic effect, two types of isotope-labeled ethanol, CH3CH2OD (99%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and CD3CD2OD (99%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries), were used as reactant. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. Two gas chromatographs, Shimadzu GC-8A equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a packed column Porapack-QS and GL Science GC-380 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame-ionization detector and two packed columns, Unicarbon and molecular sieve 5A, were used. N2 gas was used as internal standard for quantitative GC analysis. Alcohol conversion, the product selectivity, and carbon balance were defined as the following Eqs. (1)–(3), respectively. (1) Conversion ( % ) = X X 0 × 100 (2) Selectivity ( % ) = A X × 100 (3) Carbon balance = Selectivity total where X 0, X, and A refer to the amount of alcohol feed, the amount of reacted, and amounts of products, respectively."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed with a RINT Ultima+ diffractometer (Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ =0.1540nm) and X-ray power of 40kV/20mA. Specific surface areas were measured by the BET method from N2 adsorption at 77K using a BELSORP MAX (BEL Japan Inc.). XPS measurements were performed using a JPS-9010 MC (JEOL). An Mg-Kα radiation source (1253.3eV) operated at a power of 100W (10kV, 10mA) was employed. Vacuum in the analysis chamber was <5×10−6 during all measurements. Pass energy of 30eV was used to acquire all survey scans. The binding energy (BE) was corrected for surface charging by taking the C1s peak of carbon as a reference at 248.7eV. Data were analyzed using the SpecSurf including Shirley background subtraction and fitting procedure. Quantification of the components for the surface oxidation state of vanadium and molybdenum was made using the SpecSurf. The binding energies of 517.2, 516.0 and 515.2eV were attributed to V5+, V4+ and V3+, respectively in the V2O3 [16,17], and Mo6+, Mo5+ and Mo4+ oxidation states (Mo3d3/2 and Mo3d5/2) were identified at 235.8, 234.7 and 232.7eV, and 232.2, 231.9 and 229.1eV, respectively [18,19]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic activity of V2O3 and MoO2 in ethanol reaction,"3.1 Catalytic activity of V2O3 and MoO2 in ethanol reaction Over the V2O3 catalyst and the MoO2 catalyst, we observed the formation of ethane and acetaldehyde as the main products in the conversion of ethanol. Main by-product detected was ethylene and trace amounts of C4 compounds such as ethyl acetate, n-butanol, crotonaldehyde and 2-butanone were also detected. We also observed heavy products in the outlet of the reactor, so that the carbon balances were around 90% in the ethanol reaction. The product selectivity of these products including C4 compounds was calculated on the basis of the carbon balances and is listed as others in Tables 1 and 3 . No formations of diethyl ether and H2 were observed. Ethylene can be simply formed by dehydration and the C4 by-products can be formed via condensation reaction of ethanol. Fig. 1 shows the conversion of ethanol and the selectivity to products as a function of time on stream on the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts. The conversion of ethanol on the V2O3 catalyst, as can be seen in Fig. 1(a), was 24% at the beginning of the time on stream and decreased sharply to 15% with the increase of the time on stream. The reason for the sharp decrease is unclear, but possibly due to a change of oxidation state of V on the surface during the reaction as observed in our previous paper [1]. Nevertheless, the conversion then kept unchanged after 2h time on stream. On the other hand, the ethane selectivity of 38% and the acetaldehyde selectivity of 43% were observed at the beginning of the reaction and the ethane selectivity gradually increased, giving 43% selectivity to ethane with 44% selectivity to acetaldehyde at 5h time on stream (Table 1). Compared to the above V2O3 catalyst, the MoO2 catalyst showed more stable and better performance for the conversion of ethanol to ethane and acetaldehyde, as can be seen in Fig. 1(b) and Table 1. The conversion was about three times higher than that of the V2O3 catalyst and only slightly decreased from 47% to 41% at 2h time on stream and then was stabilized. Obviously, intrinsic activity the MoO2 catalyst for the ethanol reaction seems higher than that of the V2O3 catalyst, since the surface area of the V2O3 (17m2/g shown in Table 1) is higher than that of MoO2 (5m2/g). In addition, the MoO2 catalyst clearly revealed the high selectivity performance for the equimolar product formation in which 47% ethane selectivity and 48% acetaldehyde selectivity were achieved from the beginning of the ethanol reaction and continued to 9h time on stream without appreciable changes in the selectivities. For both the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts, the equimolar formation of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol is now apparent and active sites on the catalysts are stable during the ethanol reaction. Interesting thing is that very small amount of ethylene and no formation of diethyl ether were observed for both the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts. This fact indicates that no acid sites, which can promote dehydration of ethanol to ethylene and diethyl ether, exist on the surface of the low valence V2O3 and MoO2. This result suggests at the same time that the reaction is not a simple acid-catalyzed reaction."
7,Oxidation state of the catalysts after the reaction,"3.2 Oxidation state of the catalysts after the reaction XRD measurements were carried out for the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts before and after the ethanol reaction. Results are shown in Fig. 2 . A typical XRD pattern of V2O3 was observed without any other crystal phases both before and after the ethanol reaction. MoO2 phase was also confirmed by XRD and the XRD after the ethanol reaction showed no additional peaks of any impurities such as H x MoO3 [20] and other molybdenum oxides. These results evidently reveal that the reduced state of V and Mo in each oxide can be maintained under the reaction conditions and no decomposition of the oxide catalysts takes place during the reaction. To obtain further insight into the stability of the oxidation state of the catalysts, surface oxidation states of V and Mo before and after the ethanol reaction were examined by XPS. Since the measurements were unable to be conducted on the samples without exposure to air, note that obtained XPS results are not for actual surface under the reaction. Nevertheless, the results summarized in Table S1 showed that the surfaces kept highly reduced states and consisted of V3+ and Mo4+ species mainly and these reduced states were almost the same before and after the reaction. This result is apparently consistent with the XRD result. As a consequence, it is reasonable to conclude that the crystal phases and the surface oxidation states of the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts are stable under the ethanol reaction."
8,Addition of H2 and C2H4 into the reaction stream,"3.3 Addition of H2 and C2H4 into the reaction stream Hydrogenation of ethanol or of ethylene formed by dehydration of ethanol with formed hydrogen molecules during the reaction was thought to be a likely pathway for the formation of ethane [2,3,13]. Direct hydrogenation of ethylene with ethanol as a source of hydrogen molecules is also a possible pathway to form ethane. To investigate whether reactions on these pathways actually occur or not, the ethanol reaction was carried out in the presence of H2 and/or C2H4 into the reaction stream. H2 (1.0ml/min) or C2H4 (1.0ml/min) was added into the reaction stream and the total flow rate was maintained at 21.4ml/min. Ethanol conversion and products distribution in the presence of H2 or C2H4 in the reaction stream over the V2O3 catalyst and the MoO2 catalyst are listed in Table 1. For both the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts, the conversion of ethanol and the selectivities to all kind of the products did not change in the presence of H2 in the reaction stream. Therefore, it can be concluded that hydrogen molecule is not involved in the formation of ethane from ethanol. Similarly, the addition of C2H4 had also no effect on the conversion of ethanol and the selectivities to the products. These results suggest that the pathway of the hydrogenation of ethylene is not responsible for the formation of the equivalent amount of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol over V2O3 and MoO2. Coupling reaction of methylene group formed by decomposition of diethyl ether [2] or dissociation of acetaldehyde [6] are also a possible reaction mechanism as proposed for the formation of ethane from ethanol. However, we could observe no formation of formaldehyde and no diethyl ether conversion over the both catalysts under the same reaction conditions for ethanol conversion, so that these two reaction pathways can be excluded."
9,Effect of reaction condition,"3.4 Effect of reaction condition Effects of the reaction temperature on the selectivities to ethane and acetaldehyde were examined over V2O3 and MoO2 in the temperature range from 533K to 653K. Results are shown in Fig. 3 . V2O3 showed the selectivities to ethane and acetaldehyde of 43.4% and 45.3%, respectively, at low reaction temperature (573K). The selectivity to these products did not change even when the reaction temperature was increased until 653K, although the some amounts of ethylene with the selectivity 1.3% was appreciably produced at 603K and increased to 3.7% at 653K. MoO2 also showed no temperature effect on the selectivities to ethane and acetaldehyde. The selectivities to ethane and acetaldehyde in all reaction temperatures were within the range of 44–46% and 45–48%, respectively. The insets of Fig. 3 show Arrhenius plots for the formation of ethane and acetaldehyde over V2O3 and MoO2. Apparent activation energies (E a,app) of ethane and acetaldehyde formation were calculated to be 106kJ/mol and 100kJ/mol, respectively, for V2O3 and 96kJ/mol and 90kJ/mol for MoO2 as listed in Table 2 . The E a,app values for ethane and acetaldehyde formation were similar both over V2O3 and MoO2, but the values over V2O3 were slightly higher than those of MoO2. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde VO x /TiO2/SiO2 catalyst [21] and MO x /Al2O3 (MV, Mo, W) catalysts [22] have been reported to give apparent activation energies of 46kJ/mol and 17–23kJ/mol, respectively. These values are obviously much lower than those observed in the ethanol reaction over V2O3 and MoO2 which is a non-oxidative reaction. This comparison may suggest that the equimolar formation of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol takes place without accompanying a reduction–oxidation process of the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts. Effects of contact time on the selectivities ethane and acetaldehyde were shown in Fig. 4 . Ethane and acetaldehyde were formed with an equal amount over V2O3 under the W/F conditions of lower that 0.023gml/min. However, the selectivity to acetaldehyde constantly decreased with increase of the contact time and reached to 34.9% under the W/F of 0.07gml/min, while the selectivity to ethane kept unchanged in all contact time range tested. MoO2 also revealed a similar selectivity change, that is, the selectivity to acetaldehyde slightly decreased from 50.9% at 0.03gml/min to 39.4% at 0.07gml/min and on the other hand the selectivity to ethane did not change in this contact time range. The observed decrease of the selectivity to acetaldehyde seems due to a consecutive condensation reaction of formed acetaldehyde when concentration of acetaldehyde increased under longer contact times. By summarizing all the data collected under the different reaction conditions, it is evident that the product selectivities are practically independent of the reaction temperature and the conversion of ethanol. This clearly indicates that ethane and acetaldehyde are not formed by consecutive reactions but in a single step from common intermediate."
10,Reaction of various alcohols over V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts,"3.5 Reaction of various alcohols over V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts In order to further study the equimolar formation of alkanes and aldehydes, catalytic reactions using methanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol were carried out over V2O3 and MoO2 oxide catalysts. Results are summarized in Table 3 . Like as ethanol, almost the same selectivities to alkanes and corresponding aldehydes or ketones were observed in all kind of tested alcohols over both V2O3 and MoO2 oxide catalysts, except for the 2-propanol reaction in which much amounts of propylene were simultaneously formed by the dehydration of 2-propanol and also the selectivity to acetone in the reaction over MoO2 was slightly higher than that of propane probably due to a occurrence of simple dehydrogenation of 2-propanol to acetone. It is now evident from the data that the equimolar formation of alkanes and aldehydes or ketones occurs regardless of alcohols. Moreover, it is noteworthy that methane was obtained from methanol with reasonably high selectivity. This result strongly confirms that the equimolar formation of alkanes and aldehydes from alcohols is not via the formation of olefin. Formation rates of the products of each alcohol were calculated by using the data summarized in Table 3 and the values are listed in Table 4 . The order of the product formation rates of the different alcohols over V2O3 was as follows: 2-propanol≫ethanol>1-propanol>methanol. In the case of MoO2, the order was as follows: 2-propanol≫methanol>ethanol>1-propanol. There are difference in the order between the catalysts but the order among normal alcohols seem to have less meanings, since the rates of these alcohols are more or less similar. More prominent is that much higher production rates were obtained in the reaction of 2-propanol for both the V2O3 and the MoO2 catalysts than those of the other alcohols. This interesting result of the high reaction rate of 2-propanol could be related to reactivity of α-hydrogen of 2-propanol, namely easy elimination of α-hydrogen in 2-propanol compared with the other alcohols. Then a hydrogen transfer reaction at α-position of alcohols is suggested involved in the rate-determining step for the equimolar formation of alkanes and aldehydes from alcohols."
11,Kinetic investigation for the formation of ethane and acetaldehyde,"3.6 Kinetic investigation for the formation of ethane and acetaldehyde Study on H–D kinetic isotope effects (KIE) was conducted to reveal the reaction mechanism. KIE was measured using CH3CH2OD and CD3CD2OD with respect to CH3CH2OH. The results are shown in Table 5 . The KIE values in the conversion of C2H5OD (KIE; v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD ) were 1.09 for V2O3 and 1.12 for MoO2 catalysts. On the other hand, slightly high KIE value for MoO2 (KIE; v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD is 1.32) was observed when C2D5OD was used as the reactant. Very differently, V2O3 showed an inverse isotope effect (KIE; v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD is 0.84). This will be discussed in the following section. We estimated KIE value as primary isotope effect for v − CH / v − CD at 573K for CH cleavage (α-H elimination) to be 2.8, which is obviously higher than that of the experimental values (entry 1, 2 in Table 5) of 0.80 and 1.32 for V2O3 and MoO2, respectively. The experimental KIE values ( v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD = 4.9, entry 3 in Table 5) in the case of oxidative cleavage of CH bond of alcohols have been reported very close to the estimated KIE value as primary isotope effect (KIE=5.0), indicating that CH bond in methylene group is completely dissociated [23]. Ru/carbon catalyst (entry 4) showed KIE values for both OH and CH which are lower than those of estimated value, suggesting that α-hydrogen elimination is not a rate-determining step [24]. Hydroxyapatite [25], Al-complex [26] and Zr-complex [27], which have been reported as catalysts for hydrogen transfer reaction, showed also small KIE values as primary isotope effect for the cleavage of CH bond. All of these reports (entry 5–7) indicate that CH and OH bonds are not completely dissociated in the transition states and hydride transfer favorably occurred via a concerted mechanism [25–27]. The experimental KIE values (v CH/CD) for the V2O3 and MoO2 are similar to that of these reports, so that a hydrogen transfer-type reaction could occur as a rate-determining step for the equivalent formation of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol over V2O3 and MoO2."
12,Co-formation of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol over V2O3 and MoO2,"3.7 Co-formation of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol over V2O3 and MoO2 For better discussion, we made adsorbed state models of ethanol on (012) plane of V2O3 and (−111) plane of MoO2. The models are illustrated in Fig. 5 . A chosen hexagonal crystal structure of the V2O3 catalyst grows in the direction to (012) plane [28], and the preferential orientation is reported along (11 l) directions for normal MoO2 [29]. Almost the same distance of Ha–Ob was able to set for both V2O3 (2.30Å) and MoO2 (2.37Å) catalyst surface. However, a much longer distance of Hb–Cb was necessary for V2O3 catalyst (2.21Å) while a short distance (1.61Å) was realized on MoO2 catalyst (1.61Å). The model can help to reasonably explain the observed various kinetic results by assuming that simultaneous formation of ethane and acetaldehyde proceeds via the hydrogen transfer dehydration through a 6-membered cyclic intermediate, which is a concerted process where two ethanol molecules are adsorbed at V–O and Mo–O sites on the surface of the catalysts. First, the apparent activation energy for the formation of ethane and acetaldehyde over V2O3 (106kJ/mol and 100kJ/mol, respectively, in Table 2) was higher than that of MoO2 (90kJ/mol and 86kJ/mol, respectively, in Table 2). The higher activation energy seems caused by the longer distance between Hb and Cb over V2O3 than MoO2, i.e., the interaction of Hb in methylene group and adjacent Cb in methylene group is more difficult over V2O3 compared with MoO2. The KIE values when C2H5OD was reacted were almost the same for V2O3 ( v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD = 1.09 in Table 4) and MoO2 ( v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD = 1.12 in Table 4), and the KIE values when C2D5OD was used were, on the other hand, very different between V2O3 ( v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD = 0.84 in Table 4) and MoO2 ( v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD = 1.32 in Table 4). The observed KIE values when C2H5OD was reacted clearly indicate that the OH interaction of alcohol with oxide surface is not a rate-limiting step. Although the observed KIE over MoO2 was rather small, the KIE values for v C 2 H 5 OH / v C 2 H 5 OD more than unity is not discrepant with the assumption that α-hydrogen is eliminated by a concerted mechanism and hydrogen transfer as the rate-determining step takes place via formation of the 6-membered cyclic (nonlinear) intermediate, followed by dehydration to form the products. In fact, KIE values in hydrogen transfer reaction are more than 6 when the reaction takes place in linear transition structure [30], and nonlinear transition structure shows decreased KIE values as low as 21/2 [31]. On the other hand, an inverse kinetic isotope effect was observed on V2O3. It appears that the inverse kinetic isotope effect should be related to conformation of the 6-membered cyclic intermediate over the oxide surface. The intermediate with C2H5OD cannot stably form due to the long distance of Hb–Cb over V2O3. However, when C2D5OD is reacted, an adsorbed state of C2D5OD may alter the conformation of the 6-membered cyclic intermediate to facilitate easier hydrogen transfer. Based on these results, we proposed a plausible reaction scheme for the co-formation of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol on V2O3 and MoO2 as shown in Scheme 1 . In the first step, the 6-membered cyclic intermediate is formed by a interaction between two adjacently adsorbed ethanol over coordinatively unsaturated V–O and Mo–O sites than can be created when the metal elements are in a low valence state. The H atoms of the hydroxyl groups of alcohol may be stabilized by hydrogen bonding with lattice oxygen atoms of V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts. Ha adsorbed on lattice oxygen simultaneously interacts with the ObH of adjacent adsorbed alcohol and Hb in methylene group also interact with Cb in adjacent methylene group. Then 6-membered cyclic intermediate as a transition state is formed [32,33]. Subsequently, Ha in hydroxyl group adsorbed on lattice oxygen completely transfers as proton to the hydroxyl group adsorbed at adjacent site (–ObH), forming water. Concertedly Hb in the methylene group also transfers as hydride ion to the Cb in methylene group of another ethanol adsorbed on the adjacent site accompanied by the cleavage of Cb Ob bond. Thus, ethane and acetaldehyde are simultaneously formed."
13,Conclusion,"Equimolar amounts of ethane and acetaldehyde were formed from ethanol over V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts. The selectivity to ethane and acetaldehyde were almost independent of the reaction temperature in the range of 533–653K and contact time in the range 0.0014–0.07g/ml/min, confirming the equimolar formation scheme. Both over the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts, the reactions of methanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol also produced the equivalent amount of corresponding alkanes and aldehydes. The reaction over the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts is generally applicable for aliphatic alcohols. The formation of methane strongly supports that olefin is not an intermediate in the co-formation of alkanes from aliphatic alcohols. Kinetic isotope effects for C2H5OD and C2D5OD respect to C2H5OH were rather small for both the V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts. It is concluded that plausible reaction mechanism for the co-formation of ethane and acetaldehyde from ethanol is a hydrogen transfer reaction between two ethanol molecules adsorbed on metal–O2−–metal sites of V2O3 and MoO2 catalysts surface via formation of six-membered transition states. This reaction itself and catalytic function of low valence V and Mo in metal oxide form seem quite unique in catalysis field and interesting for further application."
