0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols, as one of the basic organic conversion reactions, plays a key role in industrial applications and organic synthesis [1,2]. Traditional industrial procedures for oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones are performed by consuming a lot of energy and using oxidants which may be hazardous to the environment and even toxic to the human body (such as KMnO4 [3], K2Cr2O7 [4], CrO3 [5], Br2 [6], hypochlorite [7]. etc.). The use of these oxidants is very likely to cause serious safety issues. In addition, since the oxidation behavior of these oxidants is not selective, it may lead to excessive oxidation of aromatic alcohols. Therefore, it is crucial to explore a catalytic route with high conversion, excellent selectivity and environmental-benign to achieve the efficient preparation of aldehydes or ketones [8]. Due to the advantages of green and sustainable development [9], photocatalytic technology has emerged as one of the most promising, eco-friendly and economical methods for the conversion or synthesis of organic compounds [10]. The core of photocatalytic technology lies in the design and preparation of catalysts possessing the superior photocatalytic properties [11]. So far, a large number of photocatalysts including modified TiO2 [12], Bi2WO6 [13], ZnS [14], CeO2 [15], BiBr3 [16]. etc., have been used to study the oxidation of aromatic alcohols. These efforts avoid the use of toxic oxidants and achieve environmental protection purposes. However, the low conversion and poor selectivity are still not completely resolved [7]. In the photocatalytic process, photo-generated hole (h+) is the only selective oxidative species [7] and superoxide radical (O2•−) is a mild oxide species. While hydroxyl radical (•OH) is a strongly oxidizing species and its presence may cause over-oxidation or even mineralization of aromatic alcohols [17], leading to poor selectivity. Therefore, the intrinsic method to improve selectivity while maintaining high conversion is to promote the formation of O2•−, avoid the generation of ••OH and make photo-generated holes directly participate in the oxidation [18]. This requires that the oxidation potential of photocatalyst is slightly more negative than E θ (H2O/•OH = +2.72 eV) [19], so that holes have sufficient oxidation capacity, while avoiding the formation of •OH. And the reduction potential is much more negative than E θ (O2/O2•− = −0.33 eV) [19], which the electrons can generate enough O2•− through the reduction reaction with oxygen molecules. Inspired by the above analysis, BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy attracts our drastic research interest. BiFeO3, as a narrow-band gap semiconductor [20], has been widely applied in photocatalytic degradation of various organic pollutants [21] and water splitting [22] under visible-light irradiation. Its valence band (VB) potential (+2.60 eV) [23] is only slightly more negative than the standard redox potential of H2O/•OH. The polypyrrole (PPy) is a semiconductor polymer with high mobility of charge carriers and good environmental stability [24]. In the field of photocatalysis, PPy is mainly used for compounding with inorganic semiconductors (such as TiO2 [25], ZnO [26], SnS2 [27], BiOI [28]) or organic materials (such as g-C3N4 [29]) to improve their performance. Its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) potential (−1.15 eV) [24] is negative enough that the photo-generated electrons (e−) retained on LUMO can easily reduce oxygen molecules to generate O2•-. In addition, the staggered band alignments of BiFeO3 and PPy is another reason to attract our attention, because it is conducive to the formation of Z-scheme structure. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) potential of PPy (+1.05 eV) [24] is slightly more positive than the conduction band (CB) potential of BiFeO3 (+0.50 eV) [23]. The close potential of the two provides ample possibility for electrons on CB of BiFeO3 to transfer and quench the holes on HOMO of PPy. While these holes and electrons with weaker redox ability are sacrificed, those charge carriers (holes on VB of BiFeO3 and electrons on LUMO of PPy) with stronger oxidizing or reducing properties are effectively retained, which prevents the recombination of charge carriers and improves the quantum yield. In fact, improving migration efficiency of electrons between interfaces is an extremely important link in the Z-scheme system. Considering its superior electrical conductivity [30], CNTs is introduced in BiFeO3-PPy as an electron mediator to reduce the migration resistance of electrons. Additionally, CNTs can also act as an accelerator for formation of alcohol-carbon radicals in oxidation of aromatic alcohols [30–32]. Taking all of these into consideration, we adopt hydrothermal reaction and oxidative polymerization to prepare the novel Z-scheme BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy photocatalysts. A series of physico-chemical methods are applied to detect the structural and optical properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts. The photocatalytic performance of the Z-scheme BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy is focused on selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. As expected, high conversion (83.2%) and superior selectivity (99.3%) are achieved simultaneously over BCP(0.03) under visible-light irradiation. In addition, the effects of solvents, reaction temperature, light wavelength, substituent type on the photocatalytic efficiency are also discussed carefully. And the possible mechanism for photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy is proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of BiFeO3-CNTs,"2.1 Synthesis of BiFeO3-CNTs BiFeO3-CNTs was synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction. In a typical synthesis, Bi(NO3)3•5H2O (2.426 g) and Fe(NO3)3•9H2O (2.020 g) were dissolved in a 50 mL 0.4 mol L−1 nitric acid solution at a ratio of the amount of the substance of 1:1. Then CNTs (0.1 g) were ultrasonically dispersed in the above solution. Afterwards, NaOH solution (6 mol L−1) was added drop-wise to the above mixture under vigorous magnetic stirring until the dark brown precipitate was completely formed. The obtained precipitate was collected after centrifuging and washed repeatedly with deionized water until the supernatant liquid is neutral. The washed precipitate was used as a precursor to the hydrothermal reaction and mixed with 30 mL NaOH solution (1 mol L−1). Finally, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-line stainless-steel autoclave and treated with a hydrothermal method at 180 °C for 24 h. After completing the period of synthesis, the product was collected, washed and dried. The obtained sample was signed as BC. The pure BiFeO3 was also synthesized following the above steps without adding CNTs."
3,Preparation of BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy,"2.2 Preparation of BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy was prepared by oxidative polymerization according to the reported method [24]. In brief, 1 g BC was dispersed in 50 mL aqueous solution including 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 or 0.05 mL of pyrrole monomer by sonication for 20 min. Then FeCl3 aqueous solution (20 mL 0.15 mol L−1) as oxidant was slowly dropped to the above suspension mixture. The oxidative polymerization reaction was carried out under stirring for 12 h. After the reaction, BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy was collected, washed and dried. The samples were signed as BCP(X), where X represents volume of pyrrole monomer. In additional, BiFeO3-PPy (0.03 mL of pyrrole monomer) was also synthesized as the above procedure and marked as BP(0.03)."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations XRD (Philips X’ Pert Pro-MPD) analyses were conducted to investigate the crystal patterns of the photocatalysts by using Cu K X-radiation(λ = 0.154 nm). FT-IR (Nicolet IS-01, USA) was used to detect the functional groups of the samples. SEM (A JEOL Ltd. JSM-7600 F) and TEM (Hitachi H-800) were employed to explore the surface morphologies of the samples. XPS (Thermo ESCALAB250) was applied to identify the elemental chemical states by using Al Kα radiation (ULVAC-PHI, Japan). UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, DUV-3700) equipped with an integrating sphere was adopted to obtain the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), which BaSO4 was used as a reference. The spectrofluorophotometer (PE LS 55) was used to measure the photoluminescence spectra (PL) of samples at the maximum excitation light wavelength. The electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, CHI 660D) was adopted to obtain the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) by using a standard three-electrode system. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were checked on a Bruker model ESR JES-FA200 spectrometer."
5,Photocatalytic activity test,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity test The photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was performed in a three-necked glass flask with a reflux condenser. The visible light source was a 150 W halogen lamp. The reaction suspensions were prepared by adding 50 mg of the as-prepared photocatalyst into 20 mL of solvent containing benzyl alcohol (0.05 mol L−1) under continuous stirring. Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 1 h to acquire the adsorption-desorption equilibrium. The reaction was started by switching on the light and stopped by removing catalyst from the reaction mixture. After the reaction, the liquid phase was detected using a gas chromatograph (GC-9800) equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Agilent DB-624 capillary column. For recycling use, used catalyst was separated by centrifugation, washed and dried without any special treatment, and then used immediately for the next reaction. Each reaction was continued for 6 h. The conversion rate of benzyl alcohol and selectivity for benzaldehyde were calculated by following formulas: c o n v e r s i o n r a t e = C 0 - C A C 0 × 100 % s e l e c t i v i t y = C A K C 0 - C A × 100 % where C0 was the initial concentration of benzyl alcohol, and CA and CAK were the concentrations of the benzyl alcohol and the benzaldehyde after 6 h of photocatalytic reaction, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,XRD and FT-IR spectrum analyses,"3.1 XRD and FT-IR spectrum analyses The crystal phase of the samples is determined by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1 a, BiFeO3 is the rhombohedral perovskite structure (JCPDS 14-0181) [33]. No any impurity peaks attributed to Bi25FeO40, Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 appear. For the CNTs, a main peak at around 26° and a weak peak at 44° could be attributed to the reflection (002) and (100) plane of graphite, respectively [34]. A broad peak appears in XRD pattern of PPy, indicating that PPy is basically amorphous [35]. In addition, the XRD patterns of BC, BP(0.03) and BCP are presented in Fig. 1b. However, it could be found that all the diffraction peaks originate from BiFeO3 and there are no diffraction peaks belonging to CNTs or PPy. The one of main reasons might be ascribed to the very small usage of CNTs and PPy relative to BiFeO3. And the other possible reason is that their diffraction peaks are extremely weak and may be completely covered under the background of the strong peaks of BiFeO3. Fig. 1c illustrates the FT-IR spectra of BiFeO3, CNTs, PPy and BCP(0.03). For all of the samples, two broad peaks around at 3440 and 1630 cm−1 arise from the asymmetric and symmetric structure of H2O and OH− groups, respectively [17]. The FT-IR spectrum of BiFeO3 reflects both the metal oxide vibrations and the octahedral environment (FeO6) in which the bismuth ions are located [36]. Two absorption peaks at 559 and 821 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of Fe-O and bending vibration of O-Fe-O, respectively [37], which are features of the octahedral FeO6 on the perovskite materials [23]. The FT-IR absorption peaks of CNTs are all weak. The peaks at 2923 and 2854 cm−1 belong to the asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching [38], respectively, and these two peaks also appear in FT-IR spectrum of PPy. The presence of CC is reflected in the peak 1467 cm−1 [39]. In the FT-IR spectrum of PPy, the peaks at 1541 and 1458 cm−1 are the characteristic peaks of PPy and arise from the fundamental skeletal vibrations of pyrrole rings [35]. Furthermore, the plane vibration peak of =C–H at 1296 cm−1 and the out-of-plane bending vibration peak of C–H at 1042 and 783 cm−1 are also observed [24]. The appearance of two peaks at 1175 and 906 cm−1 may be due to the presence of doped state in PPy [24]. For BCP(0.03), the one peak of BiFeO3 and almost all FT-IR absorption peaks of PPy are clearly visible, while the peaks of CNTs are invisible. The main reason is low content and the inherently weak absorption intensity of CNTs, which makes its peaks likely to be covered by strong peaks from other substances."
8,"SEM, TEM and mapping analyses","3.2 SEM, TEM and mapping analyses The surface morphologies and microstructures of BiFeO3, BC and BCP(0.03) were determined by SEM and TEM. In Fig. 2 a, BiFeO3 is presented as the aggregation with a sheet structure and a spherical structure composed of nanoflakes. After measurement, it is found that the thickness of the sheet structure is about 7 nm, while the diameter of the spherical structure is about 0.5–1.2 μm. Fig. 2b shows the SEM image of BC. It can be seen that CNTs are distributed on the surface or inserted among the sheet or sphere of BiFeO3. The SEM image of BCP(0.03) (Fig. 2c) shows that a light and thin layer of structure is covered on the surface of BC, making the detailed microstructure of BiFeO3 and CNTs difficult to identify. This may be due to the polymerization of pyrrole monomer on the surface of BC, forming a light and thin PPy layer. It is the existence of the PPy layer that makes the detailed structure of BC unobservable. In addition, the insets of Fig. 2a–c show the colors of the respective samples. It can be easily seen that the colors change from rust red to brown red and black after the introduction of CNTs and PPy in sequence. Richer microscopic information about BCP(0.03) is presented by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images. From Fig. 2d, it can be clearly seen that the dark parts are BiFeO3, as well as CNTs and PPy appear as light-colored tubular and amorphous structures, respectively. The observed lattice spacings of 0.28 and 0.39 nm correspond to the (110) plane [40] and (012) plane of BiFeO3 [41], respectively, see Fig. 2e. Besides, the elemental mapping images (Fig. 2f) show that BCP(0.03) is composed of elements Bi, Fe, O, C and N, and each element is evenly distributed."
9,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis XPS analysis was carried out to determine the chemical composition and bonding configuration of BCP(0.03). The survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 3 a) shows the constituent elements of BCP(0.03) and their respective contents. The Bi 4f core (Fig. 3b) splits into Bi 4f7/2 (159.2 eV) and Bi 4f5/2 (164.6 eV), which are reliable with the literature standards of Bi3+ [21]. The Fe 2p orbit illustrated in Fig. 3c can also be fitted by two peaks. The peaks at 710.6 and 724.1 eV are allocated to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively, representing the presence of Fe3+ cations [42]. The XPS spectrum of C1 s can be deconvoluted into three peaks. The two strong peaks centered at 284.5 and 285.8 eV are assigned to CC, and C–H or CC bonds [43]. The weak peak at 288.2 eV is attributed to CN bond [24]. Fig. 3d shows the XPS spectrum of O 1s, in which three fitting peaks are at 528.9, 530.3 and 532.0 eV, respectively. Low energy peak often occurs in metal oxides, which is related to the lattice oxygen signal [44]. The latter two peaks are assignable to the oxygen defects and the hydroxyl groups due to water adsorption, respectively [45]. There are two fitting peaks in XPS spectrum of N 1s (Fig. 3f), which are at 399.8 and 400.9 eV, relating to CN and NH bonds from PPy, respectively [35]."
10,UV–vis DRS analysis,"3.4 UV–vis DRS analysis UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of BiFeO3, BC, PPy and BCP(0.03) are shown in Fig. 4 . For BiFeO3, the steep absorption edge locates at approximately 590 nm and the corresponding band gap energy is 2.10 eV. Its band gap energy is significantly less than 2.55 eV of visible light energy [46], so BiFeO3 may have the catalytic ability in visible-light irradiation. However, once the wavelength is longer than 500 nm, its absorbance value decreases sharply and is maintained at about 0.45 in the wavelength range of 600 to 800 nm. Compared to BiFeO3, the light absorption intensity of BC does not change significantly in the range of 300–500 nm. While an evident change occurs after 500 nm, and the absorbance value of BC does not decrease sharply like BiFeO3, but is always remained above 0.95. In contrast, the pure PPy exhibits strong light absorption characteristics from 300 to 800 nm which is consistent with previous study [47]. Further comparison of the diffuse reflectance spectra in Fig.4 shows that the light absorption intensity of BCP(0.03) has more significant advantage than those of BC and BCP(0.03). It retains continuous strong absorption and its absorbance value is consistently higher than those of BiFeO3 or even BC. This fact indicates that the BCP catalyst containing ternary composites could be adapted to the catalytic reaction under various wavelengths of light."
11,PL emission spectra and EIS analysis,"3.5 PL emission spectra and EIS analysis Fig. 5 a exhibits the PL emission spectra of BiFeO3, BC, BP(0.03), BCP(0.03) and PPy in wavelength range of 300−600 nm. The excitation light is determined to be the maximum excitation wavelength (256 nm) to ensure that all samples are excited. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PL spectra of BiFeO3, its binary and ternary composites show a main peak at near 410 nm, which is basically consistent with the maximum emission wavelength reported in literatures [48,49]. The generation of PL spectrum is related not only to the electronic energy level, but also to the vibration energy level [50]. Therefore, tiny changes in the vibrational energy level might also cause very differences in the maximum fluorescence emission wavelength. Compared to BiFeO3, the fluorescence intensity of BP(0.03) decrease. It may be because the composite of BiFeO3 and PPy accelerates the charge carriers transfer between energy levels. At the same time, the fluorescence intensity of BC is further weakened, owing to the superb conductive property of CNTs [30]. Most notably, the fluorescence intensity of BCP(0.03) is the weakest in all samples, displaying the lowest recombination probability of charge carriers. The main reason might be ascribed to the matched energy band structures of BiFeO3 and PPy, and the superior electrical conductivity of CNTs, which allows efficient separation of charge carriers to be established in BCP. In addition, PL emission spectroscopy experiment of PPy was also carried out. Since its fluorescence intensity is much stronger than those of other samples, we put its PL spectrum in the inset of Fig. 5a. To further compare the charge-migration resistance and separation efficiency in the four samples, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were carried out, as shown in Fig. 5b. Comparing Fig. 5a and b, it is not difficult to find that the variation tendency of their arc radius is exactly the same as that of fluorescence intensity. Among the all samples, BCP (0.03) has the smallest arc radius and the weakest fluorescence intensity. Based on the above facts, we could infer that BCP(0.03) may possess the lowest recombination probability of charge carriers and charge-migration resistance [51], and then is largely beneficial for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol."
12,Photocatalytic activity of BCP,"3.6 Photocatalytic activity of BCP Firstly, the photocatalytic activity of BCP was detected by selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under visible-light irradiation. The conversion rate and selectivity after 6 h of reaction in the presence of various photocatalysts are exhibited in Table 1 . For comparison, the controlled experiments in the absence of catalyst, light, and extra O2 were also carried out. As shown in Table 1, almost no oxidation of benzyl alcohol occurs without the catalyst or light (entries 1 and 11), and the conversion reaction is strongly inhibited in the absence extra O2 (entry 12). These facts indicate that catalyst, light and oxygen molecular are three essential elements that are indispensable for achieving the selective oxidation. It could be seen from Table 1 that PPy shows an almost negligible conversion rate for benzyl alcohol (entry 2). The possible reason is that PPy has a lower density than the solvent, so it always floats on the surface of the solvent and is not fully in contact with benzyl alcohol. From a selectivity point of view, BiFeO3 and its binary or ternary composites can achieve satisfactory selectivity (>98.7%). But conversion rates over them are quite different. Due to the low quantization efficiency, pure BiFeO3 exhibits a slight photocatalytic activity and the conversion rate only is 15.2% after 6 h of visible-light irradiation. With the introduction of CNTs, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol over BC increases to 24.6%. In addition, BP(0.03) also shows a slightly increased conversion rate (29.4%). However, compared with pure BiFeO3 and binary BC and BP(0.03), the photocatalytic activity of ternary BCP is further improved and the maximum conversion rate can be increased to 83.2%. Simultaneously, the effect of the PPy amount on conversion rate of benzyl alcohol was carefully investigated. As listed in Table 1, at the beginning, the conversion rate increases as the amount of PPy increases. As the ratio of PPy to BC exceeds 0.03 mL g−1, the conversion rates are gradually reduced. Among them, BCP(0.03) possesses the highest conversion rate, which is 5.5, 3.4 and 2.8 times of those of pure BiFeO3, BC and BP(0.03) respectively. So the optimal ratio of PPy to BC is 0.03 mL g−1. This may be because the insufficient PPy does not completely quench the electrons from CB of BiFeO3, so that the recombination of partial charge carriers still exists in BCP, reducing the photocatalytic activity. And when PPy/BC > 0.03 mL g−1, the excessively thick PPy layer may prolong the transmission channels of electrons and holes, resulting in an increase in recombination rate and a decrease in photocatalytic activity [21]. Since solvent plays a fundamental role in the absorption of reactants and desorption of products from the surface of the catalyst [13], the effect of the solvent on the conversion rate is discussed. Considering that polarity may be the main influencing factor of the solvent effect, solvents from high to low polarity (water, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate, toluene and cyclohexane) were selected as solvents for the photocatalytic reaction, respectively, and the results are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2, the conversion rate is the highest using ethyl acetate with medium-intensity polarity as a solvent. This indicates that both strongly polar and weakly polar solvents are not conducive to conversion of benzyl alcohol. Simultaneously, the highest conversion using ethyl acetate as a solvent may be not only related to its medium-intensity polarity, but also to the dissolvent ability of oxygen [2]. Therefore, ethyl acetate may be an ideal solvent for the selective oxidation and is selected as the solvent for subsequent experiments. In addition, the effect of reaction temperature on photocatalytic activity was discussed. As the temperature rises from 293 to 323 K (Table 2, entries 4 and 7–9), the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol increases first and then decreases. Among them, when the reaction temperature is 303 K, the conversion rate is the highest. This may be due to the slower thermal movement of the substrate molecules at lower temperatures and therefore the weaker reactivity [2]. At the same time, the increase in mass transfer resistance caused by lower temperature (< 303 K) also results in the decrease in conversion rate. However, higher temperatures may reduce the solubility of oxygen in the solvent, and thus the conversion rate also decrease. Next, the dependence of irradiation wavelength and conversion rate is also discussed. Three optical filter glasses (620−760 nm, 560−760 nm and 430−760 nm) are used for blocking light below cut-off wavelengths. The conversion rates of benzyl alcohol corresponding to different wavelengths and the proportion of each wavelength range in the total conversion rate are shown in Fig. 6 . When no filter glasses are used, that is, the wavelength range is 360 to 760 nm of the halogen lamp, the conversion rate of 83.2% is obtained. Applying a filter glass that blocks wavelengths below 430 nm, the conversion rate is reduced by 26.5% (=83.2%−56.7%), suggesting that 31.9% (=26.5%÷83.2%) of the overall conversion rate is achieved in 360−430 nm. Using the same calculation method, the contributions of the 430−560 nm, 560−620 nm and 620−760 nm to the total conversion rate are 43.6%, 17.8% and 6.7%, respectively. The above experiments show that the irradiation wavelength parameter of the light source is very important in selective oxidation reactions. The main contribution of light is concentrated at 360–560 nm, and its conversion rate can reach 75.5% ( = 31.9%+43.6%) of the total conversion rate. Encouraged by the excellent photocatalytic activity of BCP (0.03) for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, we researched the oxidation of benzyl alcohols with different substituents over BCP(0.03), and the results were summarized in Table 3 . Remarkably, BCP(0.03) can achieve high selectivity (>98.3%) in oxidation of all the alcohols listed in Table 3. In terms of conversion rate, whether or not the structure of the benzyl alcohols contains electron-withdrawing groups or electron-donating groups has a large influence on the conversion rate. Compared with benzyl alcohol without substituents, the benzyl alcohols with electron-withdrawing groups (F− and NO2 −) (entries 2–3) exhibit the decreased conversions. While the presence of electron-donating groups (−CH3 and −OCH3) (entries 4–6) on the phenyl ring of benzyl alcohols plays a positive role in the improvement of conversion. The possible reason is that the presence of electron-donating substituents causes the increase in the electron cloud density of benzyl alcohols [52] and promote them to lose electrons more easily, which may be conducive to the production and stability of radical cation intermediates [53]. In addition, it is also found that the conversion rate of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol is lower than that of 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol, and the conversion rate of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol is slightly higher than those of 4-methylbenzyl alcohol and 2-methylbenzyl alcohol. It suggests that the stronger the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituent, the lower the conversion rate, while the stronger the electron-donating ability, the higher the conversion rate. Further, oxidation of the secondary alcohol (entries 7–8) was studied and the much lower conversion rate was observed. This may be due to the fact that the only hydrogen on the carbon attached to the alcoholic hydroxyl group is difficult to remove during the de-protonation of the secondary alcohol compared to the primary alcohol [52]. Therefore, the radical cation intermediates are difficult to form and the conversion rate is reduced."
13,The reusability and stability of BCP(0.03),"3.7 The reusability and stability of BCP(0.03) Generally, the deactivation of semiconductor catalysts is ascribed to the structure instability. Especially for conductive polymers, the oxidation reaction during the photocatalytic process may cause them to convert into other substances and inactivate. In order to determine the reusability and stability of BCP(0.03) in the selective oxidation, a five-cycle experiment was carried out and each cycle lasted 6 h. As described in Fig. 7 a, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol and selectivity remain almost unchanged in the five runs in succession, and the values are higher than 79% and 99%, respectively. A trifle decrease of conversion rate may be due to adsorption of intermediates on the catalyst surface and loss of mass during catalyst separation [19]. Meanwhile, the structural stability of BCP(0.03) was also investigated by XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra. As shown in Fig. 7b, the XRD patterns of BCP(0.03) unused and used five times are similar. The position and the intensity of the all diffraction peaks in the two XRD patterns are nearly the same, no new peaks occur and no old peaks disappear. The two FT-IR spectra of BCP(0.03) are shown in Fig. 7c, which also shows the fresh and used samples did not differ significantly. There results further prove the reusability and stability of BCP(0.03) in the selective oxidation."
14,The possible photocatalytic mechanism of BCP,"3.8 The possible photocatalytic mechanism of BCP In order to investigate possible photocatalytic mechanism of BCP in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, a series of free radical capture experiments were designed and completed. In the controlled experiments, Ar (20 mL min−1), EDTA-2Na (5 mmol L−1), AgNO3 (1 mmol L−1), p-benzoquinone (1 mmol L−1) and tert-butanol (5 mmol L−1) are used as scavengers to remove or capture dissolved oxygen, photo-generated holes, photo-generated electrons, superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals, respectively [13,19]. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the selectivity of all experiments is almost the same, both above 98%. However, the conversion rates are inhibited to varying degrees after the addition of these scavengers. It may be because the selectivity of this reaction is only a thermodynamic concern associated with the band structure of the catalyst [7], while conversion rate is determined by kinetic factors related to the external conditions of the reaction. In Ar atmosphere, the conversion rate is only 12.2%, which is about one-seventh of the conversion rate in the presence of extra oxygen. This phenomenon proves once again that oxygen molecular is indispensable in this selective oxidation. When EDTA-2Na or AgNO3 are added to the oxidation reaction systems, the conversion rates decrease rapidly. More significantly, the addition of p-benzoquinone reduces the conversion rate from 83.2%–33.5%, losing almost three-fifths of the conversion. In contrast, with or without the addition of tert-butanol, the photocatalytic oxidation performance of BCP(0.03) remains almost unchanged, which indicates that hydroxyl radicals may be absent or not participating in the reaction during the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In order to further explore the presence or absence of hydroxyl radicals in the photocatalytic process, the conversion experiment of coumarin to 7-hydroxyl coumarin was carried out. Coumarin is one of hydroxyl radicals molecular sensing probes that has been widely used in photocatlytic reaction 54]. Once hydroxyl radicals are produced, coumarin without fluorescence activity reacts with them to form 7-hydroxy coumarin, which emits fluorescence [55]. Fig. 8b is PL spectra during visible-light irradiation of BCP(0.03) in a 10−3 mol L−1 coumarin aqueous solution. In Fig. 8b, no obvious fluorescence signals about 7-hydroxy coumarin are noticed either before the reaction occurred or after 3 h and 6 h of reaction. Conversely, according to previous research by us and other workers [54–56], the fluorescence peak of 7-hydroxy coumarin appears near 453 nm, and the intensity increases with the amount of hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, it can be inferred that the oxidation reaction of BCP may not be based on the non-selective •OH. Additional, the ESR technique was also employed to monitor the active species of BGP system. As presented in Fig. S1, ESR spectra once again prove the presence of •O2 − and the absence of •OH in the photocatalytic processes. It is the lack of hydroxyl radicals that ensures high selectivity in oxidation of benzyl alcohol [57]. Considering the above results, the possible mechanism for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over BCP was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 9 . When exposed to visible light, BiFeO3 and PPy could all be motivated, the electrons are excited to CB of BiFeO3 and LUMO of PPy, leaving holes in VB and HOMO. Based on the carrier migration mechanism of type II heterojunction (Fig. 9a), the electrons on a more negative energy level (LUMO of PPy) could transport to a more positive energy level (CB of BiFeO3), while the holes on a more positive energy level (VB of BiFeO3) could migrate to a more negative energy level (HOMO of PPy). The result of carrier migration may be that electrons/holes are gathered on CB of BiFeO3/HOMO of PPy. Because the redox potential of the •O2 −/O2 couple (−0.33 eV) [19] is more negative than the CB potential of BiFeO3 (+0.50 eV) [23], the reduction of oxygen molecular to •O2 − by electrons on CB of BiFeO3 is thermodynamically infeasible. This result is inconsistent with the trapping experiments of active species and ESR spectra. Thus, the charge carriers migration processes over BCP cannot follow the type II heterojunction photocatalytic system. Fig. 9b shows the diagram of electron migration mechanism of Z-scheme. In the case of CNTs with a fairly high electron affinity (at about 3 eV) [32] as the electronic mediator, the electrons on the CB of BiFeO3 could rapidly migrate and quench the holes on HOMO of PPy. Therefore, the electrons on the LUMO of PPy (−1.15 eV) [24] and holes on VB of BiFeO3 (+2.60 eV) [23] could be effectively persisted. Obviously, the oxidation or reduction of these retained holes and electrons are stronger than those of quenched parts, respectively. There retained electrons could reduce dissolved oxygen to form superoxide radicals, since their potential is much more negative than the standard redox potential of O2/•O2 − (−0.33 eV) [19]. Conversely, because these holes left on VB of BiFeO3 are at a more negative energy level than the standard potential of H2O/•OH (+2.72 eV) [19], their oxidizing power is limited and cannot to oxidize H2O to produce •OH. This may be the main reason that hydroxyl radicals cannot be found in free radical capture experiments, coumarin conversion experiments and ESR spectra. At the same time, it can also explain that photo-generated holes are found to directly participate in oxidation reaction. In fact, in the selective oxidation, benzyl alcohol is first adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst, and then is deprotonated by reaction with holes on VB of BiFeO3 to form alcohol-carbon radicals. Furthermore, the presence of CNTs also may trigger the following reactions to accelerate the formation of alcohol-carbon radicals. CNTs + O2 → CNTs…O2 CNTs … O2 + ROH → CNTs…OH + RO • Where: CNTs…O2 represents oxygen adsorption on CNTs, ROH means benzyl alcohol, RO• is alcohol-carbon radicals [31]. Subsequently, as the product of the reaction between electrons on the LUMO of PPy and dissolved oxygen, superoxide radicals react with alcohol-carbon radicals to generate benzaldehyde. In short, PPy and BiFeO3 serve as electron donors and hole donors, respectively, as well CNTs is employed as an electronic mediator and an accelerator of alcohol-carbon radicals in the Z-scheme photocatalytic system. The presence of all three allows selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under visible light conditions."
15,Conclusion,"In this study, a series of novel Z-scheme BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy were prepared via hydrothermal reaction and oxidative polymerization. BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy presents excellent oxidation efficiency and superb selectivity toward the conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde under visible-light irradiation. Especially for BCP(0.03), the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol and selectivity are up 83.2% and 99.3%, respectively. The high conversion rate and selectivity are related to the features of Z-scheme structure, the direct oxidation of photo-generated holes and the avoidance of the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, BiFeO3-CNTs-PPy has good stability and could be recycled up to 5 times without remarkable loss of activity and change in structure."
