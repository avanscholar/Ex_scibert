0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of global industrialization, energy sources dominated by coal, oil and natural gas will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the development of human society (Ji et al., 2019, 2020a, 2020b). The expected depletion of fossil fuel reserves and its serious environmental impact have emphasised the issue of sustainable development of the human society (Li et al., 2021). Solar hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting is a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels, which is of great potential to relieve the energy and environmental issues and bring an energy revolution in a clean and sustainable manner. Highly-efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) represent the two biggest scientific challenges in water decomposition (Chen et al., 2020b). So far, many efficient and cost-affordable electrocatalysts have been reported in the development of electrochemical OER and HER (Zhu et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2016; Tsai et al., 2019). Since the electrolysis product of water does not pollute the environment, hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water cracking is an outstanding method for hydrogen production. Hydrogen is formed by the combination of two hydrogen ions and two electrons in the presence of an electrocatalyst (Ding et al., 2014). The catalytic reaction takes place between the electrode material and the electrolyte. Generally, electrode materials are selected as catalysts or co-catalysts to promote charge transfer, thereby increasing the rate of electrocatalysis. As a typical electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), platinum (Pt) has the best Hþ adsorption and desorption capacity, lower overpotential in acidic aqueous solution, and excellent catalytic performance (Cook et al., 2010). However, the high cost and low abundance limit the application of Pt in industrial catalysis (Li et al., 2011; Hyeon et al., 2019). Therefore, the development of alternative catalysts that are rich in geological conditions, low-cost, strong and efficient is essential to the future development of the “hydrogen economy”. Recently, transition metal sulfides have been favored by more and more researchers due to their low cost and high abundance (Mashao et al., 2019). Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has become the new favorite among transition metal sulfides due to its special structure. There is a cake-like “S-Mo-S” single-layer structure between the sulfur (S) atoms and the molybdenum (Mo) atoms in MoS2 (Wang et al., 2019). The MoS2 has a very small lamellar gap, a monolayer of about 0.7 nm, and the van der Waals force between the layers is weak, which makes the electrolyte ions more easily embedded (Zhang et al., 2016a). In addition, the Mo atoms in MoS2 can achieve oxidation states from +2 to +6, thereby giving MoS2 a high-specific capacitance pseudo capacitance behavior (Zhang et al., 2016b). The binding energy of MoS2 for H atom adsorption on the edge of MoS2 is basically comparable to that of Pt, which indicates that the active sites of HER are mainly concentrated on the edge of MoS2 (Wang et al., 2017). In addition, the edge sites and S vacancies of MoS2 nanosheets need to provide almost zero Gibbs free energy to achieve atomic hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH). Meanwhile, the electrochemical measurement verification results show that the hydrogen binding energy at the S edge of MoS2 is close to the top of the volcanic curve, all of which indicate the potential of MoS2 as HER catalyst (Jaramillo et al., 2007). In conclusion, MoS2 has become one of the best alternatives to the precious metal platinum (Pt) due to its economic, high chemical stability and excellent HER catalytic performance (Benck et al., 2014). However, MoS2 still has certain limitations. For example: effective hydrogen edge coverage leads to insufficient active sites and large internal resistance leads to poor conductivity (Wang et al., 2012). The HER performance of MoS2 nanomaterials can be promoted in the following ways: i) Introducing more active sites in the catalyst to increase the exposure of active edge sites for HER. ii) Add more unsaturated sulfur vacancies to prepare amorphous molybdenum sulfide. iii) Combine with highly conductive carbon materials to improve the conductivity of the catalyst (Hyeon et al., 2019). In addition, Vedhanarayanan et al., (2021) enhanced the activity and stability of MoS2 by enriching the 1 T phase with covalent functionalization for energy conversion applications. The results show that covalent functionalization stabilizes the metastable 1 T phase by increasing the interlayer distance, making it a more suitable candidate for energy applications. Doping Pd, Ni, Co and other metal atoms in the catalyst can increase the active sites (Zhan et al., 2019; Kondekar et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019). Wang et al. prepared a MoS2 catalyst modified with monoatomic nickel, and the results showed that monoatomic nickel can activate in-plane inactive sites (Wang et al., 2018). Shi and co-workers found that doping Zn in MoS2 can increase the HER activity of the catalyst (Shi et al., 2017). So far, there have been studies that combine metal atoms (Pt and Pd) or conductive carbon materials (grapheme (Luo et al., 2019) and carbon nanotubes (Salarizadeh et al., 2019) with MoS2 to form composite nanomaterials for HER. Chen et al., (2020) successfully loaded MoS2 nanosheets into peanut shell-derived carbon materials (PS), and synthesized PS/MoS2 nanocomposites. The incorporation of carbon materials significantly increases the conductivity and HER activity of the composite material. Qiao et al., (2019) successfully synthesized MoS2/wild celery biomass carbon tube matrix and used it for HER. The results showed that biomass carbon based on wild celery could enhance the electrical conductivity of MoS2, and the synergistic effect of the two could significantly improve HER activity. In addition, research has also combined other carbon-based materials with MoS2 to improve the electrochemical performance of the catalyst (Tang et al., 2016). The introduction of carbon materials can provide a broad growth space for MoS2, avoid agglomeration of MoS2, reduce the size of MoS2 nanosheets, and expose more catalytically active sites (Mo et al., 2017). In addition, carbon materials have the characteristics of large specific surface area and fast electron migration speed. When the two materials are combined, the HER overpotential of MoS2 nanosheets can be effectively decreased (Chou et al., 2015). However, some carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes, are only at the laboratory stage due to their high prices (Bai et al., 2018). Biomass carbon has abundant reserves and low cost on the earth, which has broad prospects for development. Presently, researches on the preparation of biomass carbon are mostly focused on sunflower seeds (An et al., 2018), cattail (Chen et al., 2014), seaweed (Song et al., 2014), silk (Liu et al., 2016) and soybean (Meng et al., 2015). However, the research on using other cellulose-rich biomass as a carbon source to synthesize composite catalyst materials still needs continuous exploration. Sugarcane bagasse (SCB, Saccharum), as a byproduct of sugarcane and alcohol industries, is one of the most abundant biomass resources worldwide (Aghbashlo et al., 2018). This residue is often burnt to provide the power and steam required by the sugar mills and ethanol distilleries (Moncada et al., 2014). Furthermore, the relatively low lignin content of SCB not only makes it suitable for biotransformation, the highly conductive carbon material derived from SCB is also conducive to improving the conductivity of MoS2, which is suitable for electrocatalysis. In this work, SCB was selected as carbon source because of its wide surface area (BET surface area: 214.30 m2/g) and a relatively flexible structure. The preparation of new nanometer electrocatalyst from SCB can not only expand the application range of SCB, but also conform to the concept of green and sustainable development. In addition, it has been found that the SCB is mainly used in the pretreatment and conversion, but rarely studied in the preparation of electrocatalysts (Ji et al., 2020c, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c). On this basis, the waste SCB was carbonized to prepare a biomass carbon carrier. The MoS2 nanomaterials were prepared by one-step hydrothermal reaction and loaded on SCBC to prepare a high efficiency carbon biomass electrocatalyst under acidic medium. As shown in Fig. 1 . This study provides an uncomplicated and promising method for the synthesis of biomass carbon-derived electrocatalysts."
1,Material and methods,
2,Material and chemicals,"2.1 Material and chemicals Wet sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was collected from the agricultural market of Zhenjiang, China. The SCB was dried, crushed, passed through an 80 mesh screen, and stored in a sealed bag at 4 °C. The contents of cellulose (36.40 ± 0.54 %), hemicellulose (21.60 ± 0.37 %) and lignin (19.60 ± 0.82 %) in SCB were determined by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) methods."
3,Sugarcane bagasse carbon preparation,"2.2 Sugarcane bagasse carbon preparation Soak the SCB in HCl (5 wt%) for 5 h to remove impurities. Then wash the residue with distilled water to neutrality and place at 60 °C to dry. Place the dried SCB in a tube furnace protected by nitrogen, increase temperature to 750 °C at a rate of 5 °C·min−1 , and react at 750 °C for 3 h to obtain sugarcane bagasse carbon (SCBC)."
4,MoS2/SCBC and MoS2 preparation,"2.3 MoS2/SCBC and MoS2 preparation Dissolve 0.089 mM hexaammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24 ·4H2O) and 2.670 mM thiourea (CH4N2S) in 6 mL of deionized water, add 0.200 g of SCBC powder and stir well at room temperature. Place the mixed liquid in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, react at 220 °C for 18 h and then cool to room temperature. The reaction product (labeled MoS2/SCBC 1:1) was washed successively with deionized water and absolute ethanol to remove unreacted ions, and then dried at 60 °C for use. To synthesize MoS2/SCBC2 2:1 and MoS2/SCBC 5:1, the contents of (NH4)6Mo7O24 ·4H2O and CH4N2S was increased by 1.5 and 4.5 times, respectively. The preparation method of MoS2 nanosheets is the same as above, which does not contain SCBC."
5,Physical and chemical characterization,"2.4 Physical and chemical characterization Using the X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) of Bruker AXS company, Germany, the scan rate was 5° min−1 , the 2θ analysis range was 5∼80 °, and the structure crystal form of the prepared catalyst was studied. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) equipment (JOEL-JEM-2010 JEOL, Japan) was used to study the distribution of particles. The morphology and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) (mapping) of the catalyst were measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Nova Nanosem 450). X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (ESCA PHI500 spectrometer) was used to study its chemical composition. The Raman analysis was performed using a DXR laser spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Corporation, USA) at room temperature with a laser base of 532 nm."
6,Electrochemical performance,"2.5 Electrochemical performance The electrochemical performance is tested in the three-electrode system of the electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, CHI Instrument, ChenHua, China). In 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 0), the electrocatalyst modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, surface area of 0.071 cm2 ) is used as the working electrode, the platinum wire electrode is the counter electrode, and the Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode is the reference electrode. Preparation of working electrode: Disperse 5 mg of catalyst evenly in 50 μL of nafion perfluorinated resin solution, 200 μL of ethanol and 250 μL of deionized water. After sonicating for 50 min, a homogeneous mixture of catalyst-ink is obtained. Take 5 μL of ink and gently cast it on the surface of the GCE, and dry it at room temperature for later use. The electrodes were obtained with an electrocatalyst loading of 0.711 mg cm−1 . The Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured with potentials that ranged 0.307 to -0.603 V (vs. RHE) with 10 mV·s−1 scanning rate. Apply an AC voltage with a disturbance amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 0.1∼105 H z , and record electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Using continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV), under the conditions of 50 mV·s −1 and 0.597∼0.297 V (vs. RHE), 2000 CV cycles were used to evaluate the durability of the catalyst sample. All the potentials in the electrochemical experiment are calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The electrochemical double layer capacitance ( C d l ) of the electrocatalyst was estimated by CV measurements at different scanning rates (20∼200 mV·s −1) in the non-faradic potential window (0∼0.100 V (vs. RHE)). According to the linear relationship between current density ( j a - j c at 0.246 V (vs. RHE)) and scanning speed, the slope is obtained by fitting the curve to estimate the C d l ."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure and properties of electrocatalysts,"3.1 Structure and properties of electrocatalysts In order to further clarify the structure of the prepared catalyst, XRD analysis was carried out (Fig. 2 ). The peaks of MoS2 at 14.5, 33, 34 and 36 ° correspond to (002), (100), (101) and (102) crystal forms, respectively. These are the characteristic peaks of MoS2, which indicates that MoS2 was successfully prepared. The (002) (100) (101) and (102) peak strengths of the MoS2/SCBC composite were lower than peaks observed for MoS2. The peak that appeared at 30 ° generated by SCBC indicated an excellent combination between SCBC and MoS2. The (002) diffraction peak of pure MoS2 was high and sharp, which indicated that the prepared MoS2 had better crystallinity and good layered structure. However, MoS2/SCBC composited exhibit a wider diffraction peak (002) at 2θ = 12 ° compared with pure MoS2. This may be due to the increased layer spacing of the ultrafine MoS2 nanosheets. A moderately disordered structure and larger interlayer spacing facilitate the exposure of more active sites, thereby enhancing HER activity (Xie et al., 2013a, 2013b). This indicates that the short-range structure distribution of MoS2 nanosheets was helpful to form more active sites. In addition, the diffractive peaks of (100), (103) and (110) of the MoS2/SCBC composites decreased at 2θ = 32.8, 40.2 and 57.2 °, respectively, indicated changes in crystallite state. Studies have shown that amorphous MoS2 has abundant defects that can generate more active edge sites (Merki and Hu, 2011) and has been proved to be an effective HER catalyst in recent years (Benck et al., 2012). In summary, the incorporation of SCBC into MoS2 to reduce the crystallinity was conducive to the HER of hybrid materials. The structures of the obtained MoS2/SCBC nanocomposite were further checked by Raman spectroscopy. The peaks of pure MoS2 are mainly concentrated between 100 and 900 cm −1 (Fig. 3 ). The peaks of MoS2 at 380 and 404 cm −1 correspond to the in-plane Mo-S phonon mode ( E 2 g 1 ) and the out-of-plane Mo-S phonon mode ( A 1 g ) (Lv et al., 2015). The existence of these two characteristic peaks indicated that MoS2 was synthesized successfully. Compared with pure MoS2, the peak of MoS2/SCBC composites was wider at 380 cm-1 , which indicated that the incorporation of SCBC reduced the crystal structure of MoS2. This is consistent with Fig. 2. In addition, the incorporation of SCBC caused more defects in MoS2 nanosheets and provided additional active sites for the catalytic reaction. The clear Raman spectra showed high crystallinity of MoS2, which was consistent with previous studies (Xu et al., 2021). In addition, when MoS2 was combined with SCBC in the ratio of 1:1, the E 2 g 1 mode showed a red shift, which resulted in a reduction in the frequency between the two Raman modes from 24.96 to 24.10 cm-1 . This may be caused by the change in shape of MoS2 (from spherical aggregate to thin layer) after MoS2 combined with SCBC (Xu et al., 2021). When MoS2 combined with SCBC in the ratio of 1:2 and 1:5, the E 2 g 1 mode showed a blue shift, which increased the Raman frequency between E 2 g 1 and A 1 g to 26.99 and 27.96 cm-1 , respectively. This may be due to the decrease in the crystallinity of MoS2 caused by the incorporation of SCBC (Xie et al., 2019). MoS2/SCBC nanocomposites have two vibration modes (D and G bands), and the graphitization degree can be expressed by the intensity ratio of D and G spectral bands. Moreover, the ID/IG ratio can effectively evaluate the degree of graphitization and defect structure (Lai et al., 2016). The ID/IG ratios for SCBC, MoS2/SCBC 1:1, MoS2/SCBC 2:1 and MoS2/SCBC 5:1 are calculated to be 0.904, 0.975, 0.947 and 0.943, respectively. This shows that the composites have high graphitization degree and good electrocatalytic performance. Studies have shown that whenever the distribution degree of carbon migration peak is low, the graphitization degree, electronic conductivity, and the performance of electrocatalyst is found to be exceptionally good (Cao et al., 2018). The peaks at 1579 and 1347 cm-1 in the MoS2/SCBC composite material represent the two vibration modes of the G and D bands, respectively. Among them, the existence of G is attributed to the vibration of the sp2 hybrid CC bond of the hexagonal lattice in the plane. The d-band is attributed to the disordered structure of the carbon material and surface defects that cause the vibration of the carbon atoms and dangling bonds at the ends of the graphite plane (Vrubel et al., 2012). With the increase of MoS2 content in MoS2/SCBC nanocomposites, the peak intensities of D and G bands decreased gradually until absolute disappearance. This proves that SCBC and MoS2 in MoS2/SCBC nanocomposites have a good bonding effect. The catalyst was analyzed by XPS spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4 a. The CO (288.7 eV), CO (286.7 eV), CN (284.9 eV) and CC/C = C (283.3 eV) peaks has been displayed in Fig. 4b as C 1s. Among them, the peak at CO (286.8 eV) is attributed to graphite sp2 carbon atom. This confirms that MoS2/SCBC composites contain a large amount of biomass carbon derived from SCB (Shah et al., 2019). The XPS spectra were consistent with HR-TEM results. The Mo three-dimensional spectrum showed a S 2 s (225.4 eV) peak, a Mo 3d5/2 (228.3 eV) peak, and a Mo 3d3/2 (231.4 eV) peak depicted the Mo (IV) oxidation state (Fig. 4c) (Wang et al., 2014). The peak at S 2 s (225.4 eV) indicated the formation of Mo-S bond (Kong et al., 2018). In Fig. 4d, the characteristic peaks of the S 2p orbital are located at 162.3 and 161.1 eV, respectively (Luo et al., 2018). Fig. 4e showed the peak splitting spectrum of N 1s, which corresponds to graphite N and Mo 3p at 401.8 and 394.2 eV, respectively (Yin et al., 2016). In addition, Fig. 4f depicted the spectrum of O 1s, where the peaks at 531.9, 530.9, 530.2 and 529.5 eV corresponds to COH, Mo-O, CO/O-C-N and OC bonds, respectively (Mo et al., 2017). The XPS analysis of MoS2/SCBC 5:1 composite was also displayed in Fig. S1. Based on this research and previous reports (Chatti et al., 2017), the growth mechanism of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets on SCBC substrates is described. As a precursor, SCBC has a strong affinity, so it provides abundant active sites for the growth of MoS2 nanosheets and accelerates the loading of MoS2 on SCBC (Shah et al., 2018). Studies have shown that thiourea can combine with active sites on the precursor to form sulfur substance (Xie et al., 2013a). Thiourea reduces hexavalent molybdenum to tetravalent molybdenum, and sulfur substance will serve as a seed crystal to form MoS2 (Chatti et al., 2017). The above results show that the surface of SCBC is rich in nucleation sites, and the unique layered structure and small space of MoS2 make MoS2 nanosheets show a trend of vertical growth on SCBC, and finally form MoS2/SCBC composite materials (Shah et al., 2018). It can be clearly observed from Fig. 5 B1-B3 that the carbonized SCB has a sheet-like structure. The SEMs of the composite materials with mass ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 5:1 are shown in Fig. 5C-1E. It can be seen from the figure that a large number of ultrafine MoS2 nanosheets exhibit a trend of uniform growth in the horizontal and vertical directions on the SCBC substrate. Among these, SCBC provides more space for the growth of MoS2 nanosheets, thereby facilitating the exposure of more active sites. At 1:1 mass ratio for MoS2: SCBC, the load of MoS2 on SCBC is very low, resulting in exposure of certain areas of the SCBC surface (Fig. 5C1-C3). At 5:1 mass ratio for MoS2: SCBC, MoS2 particles were gradually loaded on the surface of SCBC, and a small amount of MoS2 particle aggregates were observed on the surface of SCBC (Fig. 5E1-E3). Again, at 2:1 mass ratio for MoS2: SCBC, MoS2 nanosheets are uniformly loaded on the surface of SCBC (Fig. 5D1-D3). This indicates that an appropriate amount of MoS2 in MoS2/SCBC is beneficial to the electron transfer in the HER process, thereby enhancing electrochemical activity. It can be observed from HR-TEM that MoS2 nanosheets grow vertically on SCBC and connect to each other. The thickness of MoS2 nanosheets is 2∼5 nm (Fig. 5A1-A3). MoS2 flower-like agglomerates are assembled by van der Waals forces. This structure has an adverse effect on HER (Chen et al., 2020a). The corresponding element mapping showed that Mo (yellow), C (red), O (blue), and S (purple) elements are evenly distributed on the MoS2/SCBC composite material (Fig. 6 , Fig. S2, Fig. S3). Uniformity of SEM mapping which ensured conformal growth of MoS2 on SCBC was also observed. In order to further study the microstructure of MoS2/SCBC, TEM and HR-TEM tests were performed. The TEM image of MoS2/SCBC shows that the distance between the connected MoS2 nanosheets is about 100 nm (Fig. S4). The MoS2 was observed to have formed flake agglomerates on the surface of MoS2/SCBC composites. These flake agglomerates were corrugated and grew randomly on the surface of SCBC (similar to SEM image). This unique structure had more active sites. It can be seen from the HR-TEM image that MoS2 is in close contact with the surface of SCBC. Due to the incorporation of SCBC, MoS2/SCBC presents more and larger planar defect structures. These defective structures may provide more active sites for the HER process and accelerate the diffusion of H+. In recent years, amorphous MoS2 has been regarded as a significant catalyst for HER due to its abundant defects and edge active sites (Merki and Hu, 2011; Benck et al., 2012). Therefore, the catalyst prepared after modification of amorphous MoS2 will have higher HER activity. The Fig. 7 A shows the HR-TEM images of the two regions of MoS2 with an obvious diffraction pattern. The white parallel lines in Fig. 7A3, A4, B3, C3, and D3 indicate the lattice spacing on the nanosheets in MoS2. The calculated lattice spacing of pure MoS2 at (002) and (100) are 0.594 and 0.295 nm, respectively. The lattice spacing of MoS2 in the MoS2/SCBC composite material is 0.537, 0.653 and 0.595 nm, respectively. This is consistent with the results of Yu et al., (2014). Fig. 7A3, A4, B3, C3, D3 illustrates selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The concentric rings associated with MoS2/SCBC composite materials confirmed its polycrystalline. The SAED pattern also showed discrete spots corresponding to (100) and (002) planes of MoS2/SCBC nanocomposites phase. Many obvious distorted lattice fringes on the surface of SCBC prove that MoS2 was successfully loaded on the surface of SCBC. At the same time, there are also defects in Fig. 7, which means more marginal active sites are exposed. Ultimately, it will benefit HER (Tan et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017a)."
9,Electrocatalytic performance,"3.2 Electrocatalytic performance The electrocatalytic performance of the prepared MoS2/SCBC samples was analyzed in a three-electrode system. LSV was first performed at 10 mV·s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (Fig. 8 a). It can be seen from the figure that SCBC has high reduction current density and initial overpotential, so it has almost no catalytic activity, which is consistent with the study of Chen et al., (2019). The initial overpotential of MoS2/SCBC composite is lower than that of MoS2. The above phenomenon may be related to the poor conductivity of MoS2 on the one hand, and may be related to the exposed active sites on the other hand (Benck et al., 2012). It can be observed from Fig. 8a, the overpotential of MoS2 sample is 377 mV (vs. RHE). The overpotential of MoS2/SCBC 1:1, MoS2/SCBC 2:1 and MoS2/SCBC 5:1 at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 were 295, 142 and 205 mV (vs. RHE), respectively. MoS2/SCBC 2:1 has highest HER activity. At an overpotential of 142, 167 and 269 mV (vs. RHE), the current density of 10, 20 and 40 mA cm-2 was obtained, respectively. This indicated that SCBC as a matrix can enhance the HER activity of MoS2/SCBC composites. The overpotential decreases with the increase of MoS2 doping amount. When the recombination ratio of SCBC and MoS2 was 1:2, overpotential reached the minimum value, and then increased. However, the load of excessive MoS2 on the SCBC will cause it to accumulate, resulting in an increase in overpotential (Gong et al., 2015). The lower MoS2 content will result in less loading of the MoS2 nanosheets on the SCBC. This resulted in poor HER performance of the MoS2/SCBC composite. When the ratio of SCBC to MoS2 is 1:2, the distribution of MoS2 nanosheets on SCBC is uniform and orderly and forms a nanoporous structure, thereby providing a direct channel for hydration/electron transport, thereby improving HER activity (Guo et al., 2016). In addition, Tafel slope is used to measure the kinetic performance of electrocatalytic reactions (Kagkoura et al., 2019). Tafel slope can reflect the intrinsic characteristics of the catalyst, which corresponds to the catalytic reaction route and adsorption type. It can be seen from Fig. 8b that the Tafel slope of MoS2/SCBC 2:1 is 71 mV·dec−1 , which is lower than MoS2/SCBC 1:1 (82 mV·dec−1 ), MoS2/SCBC 5:1 (73 mV·dec−1 ), pure MoS2 (102 mV·dec−1 ) and SCBC (152 mV·dec−1 ). Generally, the inherent characteristic of the catalyst is the Tafel slope. Under acidic conditions, the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water is mainly divided into the following three steps (Chen et al., 2020a): (1) H3O+ + e−→Hads + H2O, b = 2.3RT/α, F≈120 mV·dec-1 (Volmer reaction); (2) Hads+ H3O+ + e−→H2 + H2O, b = 2.3RT/(1+α), F≈40 mV·dec-1 (Heyrovsky reaction) (3) Hads + Hads→H2, b = 2.3RT/2, F≈30 mV·dec−1 (Tafel reaction). Hads represented the H atom absorbed at an active site of electrocatalysts; R represented the ideal gas constant; T represented absolute temperature; α∼0.5 represented symmetry coefficient; F represented faraday constant. The smaller the slope, the better the electrocatalytic effect. The lower the Tafel slope, the faster the current density increases. In summary, the MoS2/SCBC 2:1 electrocatalyst had the fastest HER rate. EIS was measured to further analyse the charge-transfer kinetics between electrocatalysts and electrolyte interface. The EIS data was fitted to acquire the equivalent circuit patterns (insets in Fig. 8d), where R1 represents the solution resistance, R2 represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct ) and CPE1 is double layer capacitance. Generally, the high frequency region in the impedance spectrum is related to the porosity of the catalyst, while the low frequency region is related to the overpotential of the catalyst. Among them, the level of overpotential reflects Rct (Feng et al., 2018). The Rct can explain the speed of the catalytic reaction, so Rct becomes one of the significant indicators to evaluate the catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 8d, the impedance of the SCBC electrocatalyst was tested in 0.5 M H2SO4. Generally, the semicircle correlated with the Rct at the solid/liquid interface. It can be seen from the figure that pure MoS2 had a larger resistance due to its semiconductor characteristics. This is consistent with previous studies (Ferris et al., 2015). Compared with MoS2, the conductivity of MoS2/SCBC was significantly increased, indicating that SCBC promotes charge transfer. It can also be seen from the figure that the impedance spectrum of the MoS2/SCBC 2:1 catalyst had the smallest semicircular arc diameter, which indicates that the Rct is smallest when voltage is applied (Liu et al., 2019). It was also observed that MoS2/SCBC 2:1 had fast electron transfer ability in the catalytic HER process, and the faster HER rate indicates good catalytic activity (Xiao et al., 2017). The results of EIS studies were in agreement with the electrochemical performances studies. These results also confirmed that the abundant heterogeneous interface between SCBC and MoS2 allow not only for the exposure of dense catalytic sites but also improves the electron transfer ability of catalytic materials. This further enhanced the catalytic activity of electrocatalyst. It can be seen from Fig. 9 d that the Cdl value of pure MoS2 was relatively low, while the Cdl values of MoS2/SCBC 2:1 and MoS2/SCBC 5:1 were relatively high, reaching 65.26 and 39.53 mF cm−2 , respectively. This indicates that the combination of SCBC and MoS2 can achieve higher surface activity. Generally, a higher Cdl indicates a larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which is conducive to the transfer of more electrons, thereby increasing the activity of HER. This further confirms the better electrocatalytic performance of MoS2/SCBC 2:1, which is consistent with the results of the study in Fig. 8d. The larger ECSA of the electrocatalyst, the more abundant the active sites and the more open the mass transfer channel, the more conducive to the HER process (Min et al., 2020). The CV scan diagram of the prepared electrocatalyst is shown in Fig. 9a-c and Fig. S8. In addition, the overpotential of the prepared electrocatalyst was also measured, as shown in Fig. 8c. The stability of the sample with the best catalytic activity (MoS2/SCBC 2:1) was measured by chronoamperometry for 12 h at -10 mA cm−2 , the LSV polarization curves of MoS2/SCBC 2:1 before and after 2000 CV cycles were compared, and the CV scanning range was 0.4∼0.1 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. 10 ). The figure shows that the hydrogen evolution curve of the sample after 2000 CV cycles was basically consistent with the initial polarization curve. In addition, as shown in the spectrum of XRD and Raman as well as the images of SEM of the MoS2/SCBC 2:1 after the long-time CV and i–t test (Fig. S5-S7), this post-catalyst still preserve the similar morphology to the fresh catalyst, further implying its robust stability in acidic condition. The results also showed that the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2/SCBC 2:1 for hydrogen evolution had no obvious degradation, which indicates that it has excellent cycle stability (Tang et al., 2016). This phenomenon was mainly due to the strong interaction between MoS2 and SCBC, and the accumulation of catalyst caused by multiple measurements. Secondly, there is a synergy between MoS2 and the SCBC carbon shell as well as the electronic relationship between shared orbitals. Finally, the carbonaceous matrix had enough space to facilitate the release of hydrogen. However, when Pt was used as a counter electrode, the dissolution on the working electrode reduced, which affected the stability of MoS2/SCBC composites in HER (Murthy et al., 2018). This may be due to the fact that Pt is easily oxidized and can dissolve in a high-potential acid electrolyte."
10,Comparison with past studies,"3.3 Comparison with past studies It can be seen from the Table 1 that the HER performance of the MoS2/SCBC 2:1 electrocatalyst was higher than that of the reported catalyst, such as PS/MoS2 1:2 (Chen et al., 2020aa), MoS2/BCTM (Qiao et al., 2019), MoS2/VS2 (Chen et al., 2017b), MoS2/reduced grapheme oxide (Ma et al., 2014), N-C/MoS2 (Tong et al., 2017). However, the HER performance of MoS2/SCBC 5:1 was higher than that of MoS2/CNT/grapheme (Murthy et al., 2018) and MoS2/nanoporous gold (Tan et al., 2014), but the overpotential was lower than these electrocatalysts. This indicated that the combination of MoS2 and SCBC can form rich defects and improve the conductivity, thus significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Although Co9S8/NC/MoS2 (Gong et al., 2015), Ni/NC/MoS2 (Shah et al., 2019) and MoS2-CNFs (Zhu et al., 2014) have excellent activity than MoS2/SCBC, they are expensive and the preparation is more complicated. Therefore, the MoS2/SCBC 2:1 composite catalyst has a better competitive advantage."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, this paper aimed at developing a low cost, high activity and excellent stability of biomass carbon supported MoS2 electrocatalyst. The composite catalyst (MoS2/SCBC) with good conductivity and completely exposed active sites was synthesized by calcination and hydrothermal processes. The morphology structure and electrochemical performance of the synthesized catalyst were characterized and analyzed. The MoS2 nanosheets grew vertically on SCBC. In addition, SCBC enhanced the conductivity of MoS2 nanosheets, which made MoS2/SCBC composites exhibit excellent HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4. The MoS2/SCBC 2:1 composites had 142 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 , and a cycling stability of 2000 cycles. This approach opens up a low-cost, simple and effective strategy for efficient HER, and taps the development potential of biomass-based carbon in the field of electrocatalysis."
