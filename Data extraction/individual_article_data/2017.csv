0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation over supported noble metal catalysts is one category of important reactions in heterogeneous catalysis [1,2]. One typical example is the selective hydrogenation of α, β - unsaturated aldehyde to unsaturated alcohol, which has been widely employed in the production of fragrances and pharmaceuticals. Compared to the conventional process using strong reductants such as NaBH4 and LiAlH4, selective hydrogenation using gaseous H2 is more eco-friendly and atom-economic. As shown in Scheme 1 , the hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehyde involves several routes, taking crotonaldehyde (CRAL) as a representative reactant. The hydrogenation of CC bond forms butanal (BUAL), which is much easier than the hydrogenation of CO bond to form the desired crotyl alcohol (CROL) in respect of thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Therefore, it is important yet challenging to achieve high selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. Noble metal supported on reducible oxides such as TiO2 [3–5], CeO2 [5,6], ZrO2 [7–9], Co3O4 [10] and ZnO [11] are more active and selective than those supported on inert support such as SiO2 for the selective hydrogenation of CRAL. For instance, Kennedy et al. [12] reported that the reaction over Pt/SiO2 only led to butanal, while the reaction over Pt/TiO2 led to a dramatic increase in the rate of CO bond hydrogenation. It has been recognized that the metal-support interface in these catalysts plays an important role in activating the CO bond of CRAL [3,4] or other unsaturated aldehydes [13]. However, recent works over Pt/TiO2 and Pt/Co3O4 catalysts by Kennedy et al. [10,12] concluded the defect site on the support surface is the active site for the generation of CROL via reaction between adsorbed CO bond on the defect sites of the support and the spillover H species, while the metal-support interface is the active site for the generation of fully hydrogenated 1-butanol (BUOL). Therefore, the roles of supported metal catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of α, β - unsaturated aldehyde is debatable. Such roles are essentially related to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which certainly exerts significant impacts on the catalytic performance of the catalyst [14]. However, due to the heterogeneity of the support surface (with multiple exposing crystal planes) of the reducible oxides reported in previous works, thorough investigation on such SMSI is usually difficult. Recent advances in structure-controlled synthesis methods have brought up new opportunities. Oxide nanocrystals with uniform and well-defined morphologies have been synthesized and used successfully both for understanding the fundamental catalytic mechanism and for optimizing the catalytic performance. For example, anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exposing different planes have been employed in various reactions such as the propylene epoxidation, CO oxidation and selective CO methanation [15–19]. In the current work, we reported the crystal plane effect of anatase TiO2 on selective hydrogenation of CRAL over Ir/TiO2 catalysts. The choice of Ir as the active noble metal is because that it shows high selectivity in hydrogenation of CRAL [4,20–24], as well as other carbonyl compounds [25–27]. Supported Ir/TiO2 catalysts are also proven to be promising in the hydrogenation of various carbonyl compounds [4,28–32]. However, the crystal plane effect of TiO2 in the selective hydrogenation of CRAL has not been reported. The crystal plane of the oxide is important as it determines the surface compositions and surface properties (i.e. reducibility and acidity) and consequently surface chemistry. Therefore, in this work, we designed three Ir/TiO2 catalysts, i.e. Ir/TiO2-{101}, Ir/TiO2-{100} and Ir/TiO2-{001} catalysts and applied them to the gas phase selective hydrogenation of CRAL. With the successful fabrication of these catalysts, the significant effects of the TiO2 crystal planes on the reaction behaviors were revealed, which to our best knowledge is the first report on the crystal-plane effect of TiO2 on the selective hydrogenation of α, β - unsaturated aldehyde."

2,Synthesis of TiO2 nanocrystals dominated with different crystal planes and Ir/TiO2 catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 nanocrystals dominated with different crystal planes and Ir/TiO2 catalysts Anatase TiO2-{101} and TiO2-{100} nanocrystals (NCs) were prepared following the procedure reported by Liu et al. [16,33] and Chen et al. [18]. Anatase TiO2-{001} was prepared by a hydrothermal procedure [34]. Typically, 6.6 ml TiCl4 solution (100%) was added drop-wisely into 20 ml HCl aqueous solution (0.43 mol l−1) at 0 °C. After stirring for additional 30 min, the solution was added drop-wisely into 50 ml of NH3 aqueous solution (5.5 wt%) under continuous stirring at room temperature. Then the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 6–7 using 4 wt% NH3 aqueous solution. The system was subsequently stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed repeatedly with deionized water until the residual Cl- was completely removed. The precipitate was then dried at 70 °C for 12 h to acquire Ti(OH)4 precursor. To prepare anatase TiO2-{101} NCs, 2.0 g Ti(OH)4 and 0.2 g NH4Cl were dispersed together in a mixture of 15 ml H2O and 15 ml isopropanol under stirring at room temperature, then the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting white precipitate was collected and washed repeatedly with deionized water. To prepare anatase TiO2-{100} NCs, 2.0 g Ti(OH)4 and 0.5 g (NH4)2SO4 were dispersed in a mixture of 15 ml H2O and 15 ml isopropanol under stirring at RT, then the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel. The resulting white precipitate was collected and washed repeatedly with deionized water. To prepare anatase TiO2-{001} NCs, 25 ml of the Ti(OBu)4 precursor and 3 ml HF aqueous solution (40 wt%) were mixed under stirring (250 rpm) at room temperature. (Caution: Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is extremely corrosive and a contact poison, and it should be handled with extreme care! Hydrofluoric acid solution is stored in Teflon containers in use.) The solution was then transferred into a 50 ml Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting white precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed repeatedly with ethanol and water, and finally dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The dry powder was subsequently dispersed in 700 ml NaOH aqueous solution (0.1 mol/L), stirred for 24 h at RT, centrifuged, and washed repeatedly with deionized water until the suspension pH value of aqueous solution was around 7.5. Finally, all these white precipitates were dried at 70 °C for 12 h to obtain the TiO2 NCs without further calcination. The supported Ir/TiO2-{101}, Ir/TiO2-{100} and Ir/TiO2-{001} catalysts were prepared by impregnating the prepared TiO2-{101}, TiO2-{100} and TiO2-{001} NCs with an aqueous solution of H2IrCl6 (Macklin, Ir content of 35 wt% in HCl). In this process, 1 g TiO2 nanocrystals were added in a certain amount of H2IrCl6 solution under continuously stirring for 1 h at low rotation rate (rpm = 250) to avoid inhomogeneous loading of the Ir precursor and then aged for 3 h at room temperature. After solvent evaporation by water bath at 90 °C and drying at 110 °C overnight, the solid was calcined in static air at 400 °C for 4 h to obtain the catalyst. For comparison, SiO2 (Silica gel, Qingdao Haiyang Chem. Co. Ltd., 80–120 mesh, SBET = 320 m2 g−1) was used as the support to prepare an Ir/SiO2 catalyst in a similar manner. The nominal contents of Ir in all the catalysts were 3.0 wt%."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations The actual Ir contents in the catalysts were analyzed on an Optima 7300DV inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of these catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption at liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K) on a Quantachrome Nova 4000e surface area analyzer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed on Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, which was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The patterns were collected in a 2θ range from 10 to 90°, with a scanning step of 0.01° s−1. Before the measurements, the samples were pre-reduced in a H2 flow (99.99%, 18 ml min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h. The Raman spectra of the catalysts were collected on a Renishaw Invia confocal microprobe with an excitation laser of 532 nm under ambient conditions. The laser power was 3 mW, the dwell time was 60 s, the number of scans were 4, the resolution was 1 cm−1. The spectrum was normalized by dividing the signal intensity (counts) by that of the first point of the baseline. Before the measurements, the samples were pre-reduced in a H2 flow (99.99%, 18 ml min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) were used for direct observation of supported Ir particles on a JEM-2100F microscopy operated at 200 kV. Before the measurements, the samples were pre-reduced in a H2 flow (99.99%, 18 ml min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h and then dispersed in ethanol under ultrasonic for 5–10 min and then the resulted solution was dropped on a carbon film of copper grid. The Ir particle size distribution were determined by accounting more than two hundred Ir particles in each catalyst. The mean Ir particle size (dVA = volume-area mean diameter) was calculated from the experimentally determined diameter (d i) for a number of Ir nanoparticles (n i) as d VA = ∑ i n i d i 3 ∑ i n i d i 2 . The reducibility of the catalysts was measured by hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiment on a MicrotracBEL Belcat II automatic chemisorption analyzer. 50 mg of the catalyst was loaded in a quartz tubular reactor, and was heated to 300 °C in a flow pure O2 (30 ml min−1) and then kept at 300 °C for 0.5 h, followed by purging pure Ar (30 ml min−1) for 0.5 h to remove the gaseous or physically adsorbed O2. After the sample was cooled down to room temperature, it was heated to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in a 5% H2 − 95% Ar mixture (30 ml min−1). The signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and the H2 consumption was calibrated by the reduction of CuO powder with a known amount. Thesurfaceacidityofthe catalystwasdeterminedbytemperature programmed desorptionofNH3 (NH3-TPD)onaMicromeriticsAutoChemIIchemisorption analyzer. Before measurement, 200 mg of catalyst was reduced in high purity of H2 flow (99.99%, 18 ml min−1) heated from 30 to 300 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, then kept at 300 °C for 1 h. After the sample was cooled down to 60 °C in a high purity N2 flow (99.99%, 30 ml min−1) flow, an NH3 flow (30 ml min−1) was introduced to the reactor for 30 min, followed by purging with a high purity N2 flow (30 ml min−1) heated from 60 to 100 °C and then kept at 100 °C for 30 min to remove the gaseous or physically adsorbed NH3. Then the sample was heated in the pure N2 flow from 100 to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. In order to determine the acid amount quantitatively, the peak area of NH3-desorption was calibrated with a given NH3 volume. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with a monochromatic Al anode Kα radiation (1486.6 eV), and the charging effects were corrected by setting the C1s binding energy of the adventitious carbon to 284.8 eV. Prior to the measurement, the sample was reduced in a pretreatment chamber in high purity hydrogen (>99.99%, 18 ml min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h, and was cooled down to room temperature. Then the sample was directly moved to analysis chamber without being exposed to the environment. The obtained XPS data were fitted by a XPSpeak 4.1 software. A Shirley-type background was subtracted before the peak-fitting process, we assumed Lorentzian-Gaussian peak shapes with a Lorentzian contribution of about 20%. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained at 130 K using a JEOL JES-FA 200 EPR spectrometer (9.063 GHz, X-band). The employed microwavepower was1mW and sweepwidthrangedfrom249.5to399.5mT. Frequencyandmodulationamplitudewere100 kHzand0.35mT,respectively. Before measurement, the catalysts were pre-reduced at 300 °C for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature in H2 atmosphere (>99.99%, 18 ml min−1) in an Ar-filled glovebox (Mikrouna Co. Ltd., O2 concentrations below 0.1 ppm), then transferred to the quartz paramagnetic tubes in the Ar-filled glovebox and sealed without being exposed to the air . Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of CO chemisorption on the samples were recorded using a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector and a PIKE DRIFT accessory. Prior to the measurement, the sample was in situ reduced in a H2 flow (99.99%, 18 ml min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h and then purged by a flow of N2 (30 ml min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h. After that, the sample was cooled down to 30 °C and then exposed to a CO-N2 mixture (1% CO, 20 ml min−1) for 10 min. Finally, the sample was purged by N2 for another 1 h and the spectra were recorded at 30 °C. The DRIFTS spectra of the spent Ir/TiO2 catalysts were also recorded on the same instrument with air as the background. The spent catalysts were purged in N2 at room temperature for 30 min to remove the weakly adsorbed surface species. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of CRAL adsorption and in-situ CRAL hydrogenation was performed on the same FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet iS50). The sample with a weight of about 15–20 mg was pressed into a 13 mm self-supported wafer and placed into a quartz in situ IR cell. The catalyst was reduced at 300 °C under a H2 flow (99.99%, 18 ml min−1) for 1 h and purged with a high purity of N2 flow (99.99%, 30 ml min−1) for another 1 h (to remove the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface) then cooled to 30 °C. CRAL vapor was introduced to the sample for 10 min by passing the N2 flow through a saturated vapor generator containing liquid CRAL maintained at 0 °C. The sample was purged by N2 for another 1 h in order to remove the gaseous and physisorbed CRAL and then the spectrum was recorded. Then the catalyst was heated from 30 to 100 °C at a ramp of 5 °C min−1 in the N2 flow to monitor the desorption behaviors of CRAL. For the in-situ hydrogenation, after the sample was reduced and cooled down to 30 °C, the CRAL vapor was introduced to the sample with a H2 flow (26 ml min−1). After it was purged with a N2 flow for 1 h, the gas was switched to H2 flow (26 ml min−1) and the spectra were collected as a function of time kept at 30 °C."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction The gas phase CRAL hydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor (i.d. = 8 mm) at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 20 mg of catalyst diluted with 180 mg silica was loaded in the reactor and the reaction temperature was monitored by a thermal couple placed in the middle of the catalyst bed. Before the test, the catalyst was pre-reduced at 300 °C for 1 h in high purity H2 atmosphere (99.999%, 18 ml min−1). The choice of pre-reduction temperature (300 °C) is due to fact that at 300 oC the Ir species in the calcined Ir-based catalysts could be mostly reduced to metallic form (as will be seen in the H2-TPR and XPS results) but higher temperature may result in the growth of the Ir particles. After the catalyst was cooled down to 80 °C in H2 flow. The vapor of CRAL was introduced to the reactor by passing a H2 flow (99.999%, 26 ml min−1) through a saturate vapor generator containing liquid CRAL maintained at 0 °C, and thus the concentration of CRAL in the feed stream was 1 mol.% (1.06 kPa) and the space velocity was 7800 ml gcat -1h−1. The gas line was kept at about 50 °C to avoid any condensation. The reaction products and reactant were analyzed on line using a gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-Wax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). All the products could be unambiguously identified and quantified. The carbon balance was estimated to be 100 ± 5%, by comparing the GC peak areas of the blank CRAL and the sum of unreacted CRAL and detected products (calibrated)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations Representative TEM and HRTEM images shown in Fig. S1 demonstrate that the as-synthesized TiO2 NCs have uniform morphologies. The TiO2-{101} NCs (Fig. S1a1-a2) have sizes between 15 and 30 nm, the TiO2-{100} NCs (Fig. S1 b1-b2) have width of 10–15 nm and length of 20–50 nm, and the TiO2-{001} NCs (Fig. S1 c1-c2) are of sizes between 40 and 60 nm. The lattice fringes resolved in the HRTEM images all arise from those of anatase TiO2. All these microscopic results agree with the previously reported results [19,20]. According to the previous report [20], the percentages of {101} facet in TiO2-{101}, {100} facet in TiO2-{100}, and {001} facet in TiO2-{001} nanocrystals were estimated to be around 76–98% (see the Supporting Information and Table S1). The BET specific surface areas of the TiO2 NCs are all around 100 m2 g−1 (Table S2). Table 1 summarizes the physical properties of the supported Ir catalysts. The actual Ir contents in the catalysts are close to the nominal values (3 wt%) owing to little loss during the impregnation method. The surface areas of the catalysts (ca. 90 m2 g−1) are slightly lower than those of the corresponding supports, suggesting the TiO2 NCs are quite stable even under calcination treatment. Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns and normalized Raman spectra of the pre-reduced Ir/TiO2 catalysts. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1a) of the catalysts show typical diffractions of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272) [35]. Neither Ir nor IrOx species could be observed, indicating these species are highly dispersed on the TiO2 surface with small particle size which cannot be detected by Bragg diffraction. The normalized Raman spectra (Fig. 1b) of the catalysts show similar bands at 398, 515, and 638 cm−1, which are Raman-active vibrational modes for anatase TiO2. The vibrational mode of B1g peak at 398 cm−1, A1g peaks at 515 cm−1 and Eg at 638 cm−1 are mainly caused by symmetric bending vibration, antisymmetric bending vibration and symmetric stretching vibration of OTiO in TiO2 surface, respectively [36]. However, the B1g and A1g vibrational features are stronger than the Eg vibrational feature for the Ir/TiO2-{001} catalyst, while the opposite was observed on the Ir/TiO2-{101} and Ir/TiO2-{100} catalysts. This agrees with previous reports that the unsaturated five-fold-coordinated Ti atoms (Ti5c) and two-fold-coordinated O atoms (O2c) bonding modes on the TiO2-{001} surface reduce the number of the symmetric stretching vibration modes of OTiO and correspondingly decrease the intensity of the Eg peaks in the Raman spectra [37]. Fig. 2 shows some representative TEM and HAADF-STEM images of the catalysts, as well as the Ir particle size distributions. The morphologies of the TiO2 NCs are preserved after Ir loading and further thermal treatment. It is clear that the Ir particles in all three Ir/TiO2 catalysts are very small (with mean diameters of ca. 1.3 nm, Fig. 2a–c) and uniformly distributed. These findings are in agreement with the XRD results, suggesting that the Ir particles are highly dispersed. In contrast, the Ir/SiO2 catalyst with similar Ir content (2.8 wt%) and high surface area (303 m2 g−1, Table 1) give relatively large Ir particles (4.2 nm, Fig. 2d). Therefore, the much smaller Ir size in the TiO2-supported catalysts indicates the presence of metal - support interaction between Ir NPs and TiO2 which helps the dispersion of Ir particles. H2-TPR experiment were conducted to investigate the reducibility of the TiO2 supports and Ir-based catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 a. The bare TiO2 supports are barely reducible at low temperature region, and only weak reduction is observed at ca. 650 °C due to the reduction of TiO2. For the three Ir/TiO2 catalysts, three reduction peaks at 130–155 °C (α), 235 °C (β) and 378 °C (γ) are observed. The α peak could be ascribed to the reduction of IrOx, the β and γ peaks could be assigned to the reduction of IrClx species with different interaction strength with the TiO2 support [31]. Moreover, the α peak gradually shifts from 155 °C for the Ir/TiO2-{001} to 138 °C for the Ir/TiO2-{100} and 136 °C for the Ir/TiO2-{101}, suggesting that the IrOx-TiO2 interaction becomes weaker and consequently eases the reduction of Ir oxides. As reported in Fig. 3a, the H2 consumptions of the catalysts (0.65–0.91 mmol g−1) are higher than the nominal value (0.31 mmol g−1, assuming that all the Ir particles in the fresh catalyst are IrO2), thus indicating the reduction of TiO2 support via typical spillover effect. Moreover, it seems that the reducibility of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts ranks as follows: Ir/TiO2-{001} (0.91 mmol g−1) > Ir/TiO2-{100} (0.82 mmol g−1) > Ir/TiO2-{101} (0.65 mmol g−1), implying the influences of exposed crystal-plane of TiO2 support. The Ir/SiO2 catalyst shows a similar profile as those of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts, but the H2 consumption is lower (0.37 mmol g−1). The NH3-TPD profiles in Fig. 3b reveal that all the samples give NH3 desorption peaks in the temperature range of 100–600 °C, indicating the presence of the surface acid sites with different strength, namely, weak acid sites between 100 and 200 °C, medium acid sites between 200 and 400 °C and strong acid sites between 400 and 600 °C. Since all the TiO2 supports as well as the Ir/TiO2 catalysts were pre-reduced in H2 atmosphere for 1 h at 300 °C, the generation of the surface acid sites might be mainly caused by the presence of the TiOx species in the TiO2 supports and the Ir/TiO2 catalysts as they have quite similar profiles. However, the presence of oxidized Ir species (IrOx) and residual Cl species (IrClx) can also generate surface acidity, which thus cannot be excluded in the Ir/TiO2 catalysts. Based on the quantification results shown in Fig. 3b, the TiO2-{100} gives the highest surface acidity of 0.67 mmol g−1 which are a slightly higher than that of TiO2-{101} (0.62 mmol g−1), while the TiO2-{001} gives the lowest (0.22 mmol g−1). On the other hand, it is interesting to find that the addition of Ir in the TiO2-{100} and TiO2-{101} results in decline of surface acidity, probably due to the coverage of support surface by IrOx and/or IrClx species. However, the addition of Ir on the TiO2-{001} somehow increases the surface acidity to 0.32 mmol g−1. The amount of surface acid sites follow an order of Ir/TiO2-{100}(0.55 mmol g−1) > Ir/TiO2-{101} (0.51 mmol g−1) > Ir/TiO2-{101} (0.32 mmol g−1). In contrast, the Ir/SiO2 give the lowest surface acidity of 0.25 mmol g−1. It can be seen that all the pre-reduced TiO2 supports and Ir/TiO2 catalysts give quite similar profiles in region of 100–200 °C, suggesting the presence of similar weak acid sites on the surfaces of these different supports and catalysts. However, both TiO2-{001} and Ir/TiO2-{001} show much less of medium acidity in region of 200–400 °C compared to those of their counterparts. Furthermore, all the Ir/TiO2 give quite different profiles of the strong acidity between 400 and 600 °C compared to those of the bare TiO2 support, which could be originated from IrOx and/or IrClx species. Based on these results, it could be concluded that the surface acidity of these Ir/TiO2 catalysts are influenced by the exposed crystal plane of TiO2 support. Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of Ir 4f core level of pre-reduced Ir catalysts, as well as the surface contents of Ir0 and Irδ+ species. The Ir/SiO2 catalyst shows a very intense Ir 4f7/2 component at BE of 60.9 eV due to metallic Ir0 and a weak component at BE of 62.1 eV due to electron deficient Ir species (Irδ+). For the three Ir/TiO2 catalysts, the Ir 4f spectra are overlapped by the strong Ti 3 s peaks. The Ir 4f 7/2 spectrum can be deconvoluted to two peaks at BEs of 60.7 and 61.9 eV, assigning to Ir0 and Irδ+ species respectively [4] which are both 0.2 eV lower than those of Ir/SiO2, indicating the interaction of Ir and TiO2. Also, the surface Ir0/Irδ+ ratio in the Ir/TiO2-{101} (4.3) is obviously higher than those of the Ir/TiO2-{100} (2.7) and Ir/TiO2-{001} (2.9), suggesting easier reduction of Ir oxide on the TiO2-{101} surface. As shown in Table 1, all the fresh catalysts contain certain contents of chlorine (with surface Cl/Ti ratios of ca. 0.04) because of the incomplete decomposition of the H2IrCl6 precursor during the static calcination. However, the pre-reduction of the catalyst could remove majority of the Cl species (with surface Cl/Ti ratios of ca. 0.008). Since the quantity of residual chlorine in the catalyst is very small and could be considered to have little effect on the reaction behavior. Moreover, the surface Ir/Ti molar ratio of Ir/TiO2-{101} (0.042, Table 1) are lower than those of the Ir/ TiO2-{100} (0.055) and Ir/TiO2-{001} (0.056), which implies possible partial encapsulation of Ir particles by TiOx in the Ir/TiO2-{101} catalyst under a reductive atmosphere [38]. Such a phenomenon driven by minimization of the high surface energy of the metal Ir NP by mobile TiOx species in Ir/TiO2-{101} catalysts could be due to the fact that the TiO2-{101} have the much lower surface energy (0.46 Jm−12) in comparison with that of TiO2-{100}(0.58 Jm−12) and TiO2-{001} (0.98 Jm−12) [39] to induce the SMSI. In situ CO DRIFTS experiments were conducted to further probe the electronic properties of the Ir species in the pre-reduced catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 , the Ir/SiO2 catalyst gives an asymmetric broad band centered at ca. 2068 cm−1 assigning to linearly adsorbed CO species (LCO) on Ir0 sites [40]. The Ir/TiO2 catalysts give broad bands in 1900–2100 cm−1 region which could be resolved to several bands at ca. 2078, 2062, 2006–2022 and 1967 cm−1, indicating CO adsorption on different types of Ir species. Specifically, the weak band at ca. 2078 cm−1 could be assigned to gem dicarbonyl CO (GCO) species on Irδ+ sites, while the band at 2006–2022 cm−1 could be assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on low coordinated Ir0 (i.e. edges and corners) while the band at ca. 2062 cm−1 is assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on high coordinated Ir0 (i.e. single crystal planes) [41,42]. The band at ca. 1967 cm−1 could be assigned to bridge adsorbed CO (BCO) on supported Ir0 sites [43]. The CO chemisorption on Ti species could be safely ruled out since CO adsorbed on Ti3+ and/or Ti4+ species could be only observed at the temperatures below 200 K [44]. Meanwhile, the larger bands on the three Ir/TiO2 catalysts compared to that of Ir/SiO2 indicate more adsorption sites on the former ones because of the much higher dispersions of Ir species in these catalysts. It is well known that the defects are very important since they are one of the key parameters affecting the surface chemistry of catalysts, thus EPR technique was employed to characterize the defect structures of the pre-reduced bare TiO2 supports and Ir/TiO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 , all the TiO2-{101}, TiO2-{100} and TiO2-{001} exhibit a distinct feature at g = 2.002 arising from the oxygen vacancy with one electron (F+ color center) [45]. According to the signal intensity (scale bar in Fig. 6a), the concentrations of F1+ color center over these pre-reduced TiO2 NC follow an order of TiO2-{100} > TiO2-{101} > TiO2-{001}. The amount of surface oxygen vacancy in these TiO2 NCs, however, does not follow the calculated oxygen vacancies formation energies which are 3.76, 4.25 and 4.52 eV for TiO2-{001}, TiO2-{100} and TiO2-{101} facets respectively [46]. The discrepancy is probably due to another factors such as the different ability to activate H on the surface of these TiO2 NCs. Indeed, Chen et al. [47] reported that it is much more difficult to reduce the TiO2-{001} NCs compared with TiO2-{101} and TiO2-{100}. However, the possibility of F+ color center signals partly arising from the subsurface/bulk regions could not be excluded since the surface oxygen vacancies can diffuse to the subsurface/bulk regions to create subsurface/bulk oxygen vacancies. Nevertheless, some new EPR signals due to Ti3+ signal appear all over these Ir/TiO2 catalysts as shown in Fig. 6b. The result shows that Ti4+ can be easily reduced to Ti3+ in the presence of Ir, which is caused by the typical spillover effect [48,49]. For the Ir/TiO2-{101} and Ir/TiO2-{100} catalysts, a feature at g = 2.002 assigned to F1+ color center and a broad band at g = 1.968 assigned to the surface Ti3+ species (g⊥-type feature, Tisurf 3+) are observed. The concentration of Tisurf 3+ in the Ir/TiO2-{100} is slightly higher than that in the Ir/TiO2-{101}. For the Ir/TiO2-{001} catalyst, a new sharp feature at g = 1.987 assigned to the bulk Ti3+ defects (g⊥-type feature, Tibulk 3+) [47] located at the subsurface/bulk regions is observed, while no obvious signals due to F1+ color center and weak surface Ti3+ specie are seen, indicating that bulk defects (Tibulk 3+) are the main defects in the Ir/TiO2-{001}. These results demonstrate that the defects of both Ir/TiO2-{101} and Ir/TiO2-{100} catalysts are dominated by Ti3+-VO (Ti3+ and F1+ color centers) mainly located at the surface/subsurface region but in different concentrations, while those of the Ir/TiO2-{001} are dominated by Ti3+-VO in subsurface/bulk region with the absence of F1+ color center. Moreover, it is well recognized that the concentrations of F1+ color center reflect the relative concentration of surface oxygen vacancy [50], which follows an order of Ir/TiO2-{100} > Ir/TiO2-{101} > Ir/TiO2-{001}."
7,Catalytic performances of vapor phase CRAL hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic performances of vapor phase CRAL hydrogenation The vapor phase selective hydrogenation of CRAL over the Ir catalysts were performed at 80 °C and the results are shown in Fig. 7 , and detailed results at different reaction time are also summarized in Table 2 . The bare TiO2 supports are almost inactive (Fig. S2) under the employed reaction conditions. The Ir/SiO2 catalyst gives a low conversion of 1.2–1.6% and a low selectivity to desired CROL of 33.5–39.5% in the reaction course. The addition of Ir on the TiO2 supports significantly improves both activity and selectivity especially in the initial stage, and the reaction behaviors show distinct crystal plane dependency. For example, at initial stage (after 30 min reaction) as listed in Table 2, the CRAL conversion follows the order of Ir/TiO2-{101} (10.9%) > Ir/TiO2-{100} (7.5%) > Ir/TiO2-{001} (2.0%), while the selectivity to CROL follows the order of Ir/TiO2-{001} (64.3%) > Ir/TiO2-{100} (59.6%) > Ir/TiO2-{100} (58.3%). The main products are desired CROL, indicating that the CO hydrogenation outperforms the CC hydrogenation over these Ir/TiO2 catalysts. The main by-products are BUAL, BUOL and others such as C3 (propylene and propane) and C8 (2,4,6-octtrienal) compounds. Unfortunately, the catalysts suffer deactivation during the reaction, as the conversion rapidly declines in 3 h and reaches a quasi-steady state. After 5 h reaction, the conversion levels decline to less than 10% for all the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2, the selectivity to CROL reaches a maximum value (ca. 72.0–80.0%) in the first 100 min at the expense of the selectivity to BUOL, and then gradually stabilizes in the quasi-steady stage. The selectivity to CROL in the quasi-steady stage follows the order of Ir/TiO2-{101} (70.6%) > Ir/TiO2-{100} (63.6%) > Ir/TiO2-{100} (61.4%). To further illustrate the intrinsic activities of the catalysts, CRAL reaction rates based Ir contents and turnover frequencies for CROL formation based on Ir dispersions (denoted as TOFIr) at 30, 180 and 300 min reaction were calculated, as shown in Fig. 8 . Since the conversions are low (Table 2), the results could be considered as obtained in kinetically-controlled regime without mass and heat transfer limitation. It is clear that there is a strong TiO2 crystal-plane effect on the reaction behaviors of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts. At the initial stage (30 min, Fig. 8a), the Ir/TiO2-{101} is the most active, with a reaction rate of 166.1 μmolCRAL gIr -1 s−1 and a TOFIr of 0.0224 s−1; while the Ir/TiO2-{001} catalyst is the least active, with a reaction rate of 31.1 μmolCRAL gIr -1 s−1 and a TOFIr of 0.0042 s−1. Therefore, the Ir/TiO2-{101} shows 5-fold higher activity than the Ir/TiO2-{001}, suggesting the {101} plane of TiO2 is the most beneficial for the formation of CROL. Although both the reaction rate and TOFIr values of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts decline to some extent after 180 min (Fig. 8b) and 300 min (Fig. 8c) reaction, the same trend is observed, as the Ir/TiO2-{101} is the most active while the Ir/TiO2-{001} is the least."
8,In situ FTIR studies of CRAL adsorption and reaction over Ir/TiO2 catalysts,"3.3 In situ FTIR studies of CRAL adsorption and reaction over Ir/TiO2 catalysts In order to investigate the adsorption properties and reaction behaviors of CRAL on the catalysts, in situ FTIR spectroscopic study was conducted. As shown in Fig. 9 , the desorption behaviors of pre-sorbed CRAL on the pre-reduced TiO2 supports results in bands in region of 1550–1800 cm−1, which are characteristics of stretching vibrations of CO and CC bonds in CRAL molecule. Two weak bands at 1710 and 1725 cm−1 are assigned to v(CO) bond of gaseous CRAL [20,24] which could not be completely removed after N2 purge for 1 h. The bands at 1658 and 1682 cm−1 can be assigned to CRAL adsorbed via the CO bond in a di-σCO mode [4] and via the CO bond in a πCO mode [3] respectively, while the shoulder at 1642 cm−1 is due to CRAL adsorbed via the CC bond in a πCC mode [3]. Besides, the band at 1555 cm−1 could be assigned to CRAL adsorbed strongly via CC bond in a di-σCC [3] . These results indicate that CRAL molecules can adsorb on bare TiO2 surface via both CO and CC bonds. The bands near 1377–1450 cm−1 are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric δ(CH) vibration of methyl groups [3,24]. At elevated temperatures, the three TiO2 supports show similar signals. The band at 1682 cm−1 rapidly declines in intensity, while those at 1658, 1403 and 1378 cm−1 remain constant. However, the band at 1555 cm−1 gradually increases in intensity. These findings suggest the transformation of CRAL adsorption configuration at elevated temperature, which seems transform from πCO mode to di-σCC. The spectra of CRAL adsorption over the Ir/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. 10 ) give bands in region of 1950–2060 cm−1 owing to irreversibly adsorbed CO on various Ir species, which are consistent with the findings in Fig. 5. The formation of CO is due to the decarbonylation of CRAL, which has been commonly observed on noble metal catalysts [6,51]. As shown in Scheme 1, the decarbonylation could take place even in the absence of H2. When we focus on the region of 1200–1800 cm−1, CRAL adsorption on the Ir/TiO2-{101} catalyst at 30 °C (Fig. 10a) give similar bands as those on the bare TiO2-{101} support. However, the intensities of the bands at 1658 and 1682 cm−1 are obviously higher than those on the support, suggesting that the Ir/TiO2-{101} interface might promote the adsorption of CRAL via the CO bond, which may be due to the generation of additional Ir-TiOx interfacial sites for CRAL adsorption. With increasing temperature, the CRAL desorption results in rapid disappearance of the band at 1682 cm−1 but constant band at 1658 cm−1. However, the bands at 1642 and 1555 cm−1 remain unchanged until 100 °C. This observation is similar to that on the support, suggesting weak πCO mode adsorption but rather strong di-σCO mode adsorption. The Ir/TiO2-{100} (Fig. 10b) gives almost identical spectra as those of the TiO2-{100} support during the desorption at elevated temperatures. As for the Ir/TiO2-{001} catalyst (Fig. 10c), the desorption of CRAL over it is easier than that on the bare TiO2-{001}, indicating the strength of CRAL adsorption on the Ir/TiO2-{001} is much weaker than that on the support. The strength of CRAL adsorption on the three Ir/TiO2 catalysts also could be compared by the CRAL desorption rates. As shown in Fig. S3, the normalized peak area of CRAL adsorption over the Ir/TiO2-{001} declines to almost zero at 50 °C. In contrast, the peak areas over the Ir/TiO2-{100} and Ir/TiO2-{101} decline to 50 and 30% of the original area, respectively, even at 100 °C. These results clearly indicate that the CRAL adsorption strength on the Ir/TiO2 catalysts has a strong dependency on the crystal plane of TiO2. On the other hand, the CRAL desorption behaviors on the Ir/TiO2 catalysts are similar to those on the corresponding bare TiO2 supports. Such similarity could be explained that the majority of CRAL molecules chemisorb on the TiO2 NCs surface, but CRAL adsorption on the Ir-TiOx interface could not be excluded. Specifically, the CO group could chemisorb on the surface of Ir/TiO2 catalysts through the charge-deficient carbonyl carbon with electron-rich Ti3+ and/or Ir0 at Ir-TiOx interface (σ1) and electron-rich carbonyl oxygen with electron-deficient oxygen vacancy (σ2) to form a di-σCO adsorption mode, which was believed to be responsible for the polarization and activation of the CO bond over Pt/TiO2 [3] and Ir/TiO2 [4] catalysts. In situ FTIR spectra were also taken for the CRAL hydrogenation over the Ir/TiO2 catalysts at 30 °C (Fig. 10). The reaction temperature (30 °C) is lower than that in catalytic testing (80 °C) because our preliminary experiments found that the reaction went through too fast at 80 °C to acquire effective IR spectra. Compared to the spectra of CRAL adsorption at 30 °C, the spectra of in situ reaction show some differences. Taken the spectra of the Ir/TiO2-{101} as an example, first of all, the band at 1682 cm−1 during CRAL adsorption slightly shifts to 1676 cm−1 in the presence of H2, and the band intensity decreases, probably due to the influence of spillover of H atoms from metallic Ir0 species to the Ir-TiOx interface. Secondly, the band at 1656 cm−1 completely disappears during the reaction, while the bands at 1676, 1642 and 1555 cm−1 are clearly observed at initial stage (reaction for 1 min) but their intensities gradually decline with reaction time. Considering the fact that the band at 1378 cm−1 (δ(C-H)) remains constant during the reaction (suggesting there is negligible desorption of CRAL molecules from the surface), these observations suggest that the reaction between the CO bond in di-σCO adsorption mode (at 1658 cm−1) and H species is very fast and it is the dominant procedure during the hydrogenation although hydrogenation of CC bond also takes place (at 1642 cm−1), which explains well the high selectivity to CROL. Thirdly, the band in region of 1950–2100 cm−1 remains constant during the reaction, indicating strong CO adsorption on the Ir surface. This may explain the poisoning effect of CO on the Ir surface and thus the catalyst deactivation. Similar observation is also found on the Ir/TiO2-{100} catalyst. However, for the Ir/TiO2-{001} catalyst, all the bands rapidly disappear in 2 min, mainly due to the desorption of CRAL molecules from the catalyst surface as the band at 1378 cm−1 (δ(C-H)) also declines in intensity."
9,Discussion on the TiO2 crystal plane effect and reaction mechanisms,"3.4 Discussion on the TiO2 crystal plane effect and reaction mechanisms In this work, various characterizations were conducted to clarify the structural and surface properties of the TiO2 supports and Ir/TiO2 catalysts. The XRD and Raman results (Fig. 1) reveal the structure of anatase TiO2, and the morphologies of these TiO2 nanocrystals are further confirmed by the TEM results (Fig. 2). In addition, the presence of surface defects (oxygen vacancies) in the TiO2 are illustrated by the EPR results (Fig. 6a). When Ir is loaded on the TiO2, the comparison between the Ir supported on TiO2 and SiO2 indicates the Ir-TiO2 interaction can help the dispersion of Ir species (Table 1, Fig. 2). Although the Ir species on the TiO2 supports are similar in sizes, the surface properties of the catalysts are very different, reflecting strong crystal plane dependency. For example, the Ir/TiO2-{100} catalyst has the highest surface acidity but the Ir/TiO2-{001} has the lowest. It is well known that [Ov] tends to accept electron and thus serves as Lewis acid site [12,52]. Such Lewis acid sites generated by oxygen vacancies are often accompanied by surface Lewis base sites generated by adjacent lattice oxygen, which is called frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) and also observed in CeO2 materials [53]. In this sense, the surface acidity levels of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts are consistent with the [Ov] concentrations in the catalysts as the EPR results (Fig. 6b) clearly suggest that Ir/TiO2-{100} catalyst has the highest concentration of [Ov] while the Ir/TiO2-{001} has the lowest value. However, although the addition of Ir on the TiO2 supports increases the concentration of [Ov] as revealed by the H2-TPR (Fig. 3a) and EPR results (Fig. 6), the surface acidity determined by NH3-TPD (Fig. 3b) does not change much. Such inconsistency might be due to the fact that either the H2-TPR or EPR results reflect information of the oxygen vacancies in both surface and bulk region, while the NH3-TPD results mainly reflect acidity in the surface region. More importantly, the Ir-TiO2 interaction alters the electronic properties of the Ir species, as revealed by the XPS (Fig. 4) and CO-DRIFTS (Fig. 5) results. The Ir/TiO2 catalysts are more active and selective than the Ir/SiO2 catalyst (Table 2, Figs. 7 and 8), due to the positive roles of the reducible TiO2 as the support providing defect sites (oxygen vacancy) for the adsorption of CO bond in CRAL molecule [49]. However, the initial activity of the Ir/TiO2-{001} is comparable to that of the Ir/SiO2, probably due to the very low [Ov] concentration in the Ir/TiO2-{001} (Fig. 6b), and thus the role of oxygen vacancy is rather limited. When we focus on the three Ir/TiO2 catalysts, it is found that their very different reaction behaviors are closely related to the crystal plane of the TiO2 support. It is commonly agreed that the catalytic behavior of the catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of CRAL depends on the adsorption configuration of the reactant, which is remarkably affected by the surface properties of the catalysts, among which the surface acidity could be the most important one. It has been reported [51,54] that the surface acid sites are responsible for the adsorption of CO bond in the CRAL molecule. The NH3-TPD results (Fig. 6) reveal that the surface acidity follows an order of Ir/TiO2-{100} (0.55 mmol g−1) > Ir/TiO2-{101} (0.51 mmol g−1) have similar surface acidity but the Ir/TiO2-{001} has the lowest value. Consequently, the initial activities of the Ir/TiO2 catalysts follows an order of Ir/TiO2-{101} (166.1 μmol gIr -1 s−1) > Ir/TiO2-{100} (113.0 μmol gIr -1 s−1) ≫ Ir/TiO2-{001} (31.1 μmol gIr -1 s−1), which is generally consistent with the surface acidity levels. We further calculated the TOF value based on the surface acidity of the catalyst (TOFSA). As shown in Table 2, it is clear that the Ir/TiO2-{101} has the highest initial TOFSA (6.0 × 10-3 s−1), while the Ir/TiO2-{001} has the lowest (1.6 × 10-3 s−1). However, the Ir/TiO2-{100} with higher surface acidity (0.55 mmol g−1) has lower activity than the Ir/TiO2-{101} with lower surface acidity (0.51 mmol g−1), which may be related to the adsorption strength of CRAL on the catalyst surface. As the FTIR results (Fig. 10 and Fig. S3) clearly illustrate that the CRAL strongly adsorb on the Ir/TiO2-{100} surface as only half of the adsorbed CRAL molecules desorb at 100 °C. The strong adsorption of CRAL on the Ir/TiO2-{100} surface may result in difficulty in its activity, which leads to low activity. On the other hand, the Ir-TiO2-{101} catalyst with proper surface acidity strength is favorable for the adsorption and activation of CRAL molecules, which may account for its best activity. The strong adsorption of CRAL and/or product molecules on the catalyst surface is also one of the reasons for the observed catalyst deactivation, which has been often observed in gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. It has been recognized that the catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by the blockage of the active sites due to strong adsorption of reactant or product molecules on the catalysts surface [4,31] and/or CO poisoning via decarbonylation reaction (CH3CHCH-CHO → C3H6 + CO) [51], which has also been observed on other catalysts such as Pt/ZnO [55] and AuAg/SBA-15 [56]. Indeed, the IR spectra of the spent Ir/TiO2 catalysts (Fig. S4) show several bands at 1454, 1529, 1642 and 1719 cm−1 assigning to surface organic species [4,30], band at 2027–2046 cm−1 assigning to chemisorbed CO, and bands at 2874, 2925 and 2966 cm−1 assigning to aldehydic, aliphatic or olefinic v(C-H) bands stretching vibrations [4]. These observations confirmed the presence of carbonaceous species and CO on the catalyst surface, which results in the catalyst deactivation. Concerning the reaction mechanism of CRAL hydrogenation, the adsorption geometry of the CRAL molecules on the catalyst surface determines the activity and selectivity, and the roles reducible oxides in the reaction is believed to provide the adsorption sites for the CO bond [3,51,54]. For example, Reyes et al. [4] proposed a [CO…surface ] σ complex stabilized at the Ir-TiOx interface, which was responsible for the improved activity in CRAL hydrogenation. Such complex was evidenced by a FRIFT band at ca. 1650 cm−1. In our case, the FTIR results (Fig. 10) do reveal a band at 1658 cm−1 upon CRAL adsorption on the Ir/TiO2 catalysts, which is rapidly consumed when H2 is introduced. Therefore, we believe that the Ir-TiOx interfacial sites play important roles in the reaction, particularly in the improvement of CROL selectivity. Such interfacial effect in CRAL hydrogenation could also be extended to other reducible oxides promoted Ir catalysts. For instance, our kinetic study on Ir-FeOx/BN catalyst suggested that the Ir-FeOx interfacial active site was much more active than the Ir0 - Irδ+_site [57]. However, recently works by Kennedy et al. [10,12] argued that CRAL suggested that the metal-support interface is responsible for the formation of the fully hydrogenated BUOL. In the current case, although no solid conclusion could be reached based on the present evidence, it seems more likely that Ir-TiOx interfacial sites account for the formation of CROL as the selectivity to BUOL is quite low, and BUOL could be formed by further hydrogenation of CROL and/or BUAL."
10,Conclusions,"This work demonstrates strong crystal plane dependency of TiO2 in selective hydrogenation of CRAL over Ir/TiO2 catalysts. The catalytic activity strongly depends on the crystal plane related oxygen vacancies in the catalyst which serve as surface acid sites, and thus govern not only the quantity of adsorbed CRAL molecules but also the adsorption strength. The Ir/TiO2-{101} has higher concentration of oxygen vacancy and more stable CRAL adsorption on the surface than the Ir/TiO2-{001}, which results in 5-fold higher activity of the former. However, strong adsorption of CRAL on the catalyst surface may result in deposition of carbonaceous species, which as well as CO poisoning are the main cause for catalyst deactivation."
