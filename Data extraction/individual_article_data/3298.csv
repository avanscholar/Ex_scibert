0,Introduction,"According to the problems induced by the shortage of fossil energy and global warming, hydrogen is expected to be a promising energy vector for the near future [1]. Hydrogen has been nominated as a renewable and alternative energy. It is at best as an energy carrier [2–4]."
1,Hydrogen production,"1.1 Hydrogen production Hydrogen commercially produces by steam reforming of methane and other fossil fuels. In such cases, however, the same amount of carbon dioxide is released during the production of hydrogen as that formed by direct combustion of fuels. This method produces toxic and corrosive components such as CO, CO2 and H2S in addition to trace amounts of ammonia [5]. Dehydrogenation is an attractive choice and alternative for hydrogen production due to its essentially zero CO2 impact, giving a positive environmental contribution and also solves the troubles and problems in hydrogen storage conditions and medium preparation, such as metal hydrides [1,6]."
2,Membrane reactor,"1.2 Membrane reactor In the recent years membranes have been used intensively in the applicable researches as a function to enhance the products yield/selectivity and thermodynamically shift the reactions toward products. Separation by membrane is less energy intensive, requiring no phase change in the process and typically provides low-maintenance operation. Membranes have been used successfully in a number of industrial applications, including the production of high purity gases and recovery of hydrogen from process streams [7]. 1.2.1 Pd/Ag membrane The first large-scale commercial application of membrane gas separation was the separation of hydrogen from nitrogen, methane and argon in ammonia purge gas stream [8]. Palladium-based membranes are used commercially to purify hydrogen and to dehydrogenate organic molecules. The catalytic ability of the membrane surface combined with the selectivity of hydrogen permeation makes it possible to remove hydrogen from a reversible reaction and thereby shifts the reaction toward the product side [9]. Shu et al. studied dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions on Pd membranes [10]. Palladium alloys are often used in commercial hydrogen separation applications instead of pure palladium. Palladium combines excellent hydrogen transport and selectivity properties with resistance to high temperatures, corrosion and solvents. In Pd/Ag, the most commonly used alloy for hydrogen extraction, the hydrogen permeability increases with Silver content to reach a maximum at around 23wt% Ag [11]. Tosti et al. [12] described different configurations of palladium membrane reactors used for separating ultrapure hydrogen. Nair and Harold [13] recently carried out an analysis of conventional Pd and Pd/Ag membranes. 1.2.2 Hydroxy sodalite (H-SOD) membrane Hydroxy sodalite is a zeolite-like material, consisting of sodalite cages only. Consequently, the material porosity is zero dimensional, having no distinct pores or channels, but an array of cages connected to each other through 4 and 6 rings. Although the 4-rings are too small to allow permeation of any molecule, the diameter of the 6-rings is large enough (2.7Å) to only allow very small molecules such as helium, ammonia, and water (kinetic diameters 2.6, 2.55 and 2.65Å respectively [14]). However, since the cages are blocked with water, permeation of other molecules can only be feasible upon the dehydration of the framework. Nonetheless, as the structure is stabilized through hydrogen bonding between the non-framework water and the framework oxygen atoms, dehydration of the material leads to the destruction of these hydrogen bonds resulting in destabilization and partial collapse of the framework structure [15]. In view of the ideal window diameter of hydroxy sodalite, absolute separation of water can be achieved through defect-free membranes. Separation of water from mixtures such as alcohols or smaller molecules such as H2 can thus become possible [16]. Moreover, a tubular H-SOD membrane has been used as a highly water-permselective membrane for water permeation. H-SOD is a zeolite-like material which consists of sodalite cages exclusively [14,17]. H-SOD membrane shows excellently ideal selectivity (near to absolute) of water to hydrogen. In addition, the membrane demonstrates a good thermal and mechanical stability. The exceptional property of H-SOD membrane in comparison with the other widely studied membranes [18,19] is 100% selectivity of water on the basis of molecular sieving in hybrid processes [20]."
3,Methanol,"1.3 Methanol Methanol is an important multipurpose base chemical; a simple molecule which can be recovered from many resources, predominantly natural gas. It is produced from synthesis gas on a large scale worldwide [6]. The Methanol synthesis reaction is exothermic and the total moles reduce as the reaction proceeds. In the methanol synthesis, three overall reactions are possible: hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and reverse water–gas shift reaction, which are as follows: (1) CO + 2 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH , Δ H 298 = − 90.55 kJ / mol (2) CO 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 3 OH + H 2 O , Δ H 298 = − 49.43 kJ / mol (3) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O , Δ H 298 = + 41.12 kJ / mol Reactions (1)–(3) are not independent so that one is a linear combination of the other ones. The temperature and pressure of reaction are 495–535K and 5–8MPa, respectively [21]. Rezaie et al. compared the results of heterogeneous and homogeneous models in a dynamic simulation for fixed-bed methanol synthesis and reported similar predictions [22]. Rahimpour et al. have studied catalyst deactivation of methanol synthesis and strategies to enhance the ability of methanol synthesis reactor using a mixture of fresh and partially deactivated catalyst [23–25]. Many efforts have been done to improve the yield and performance of methanol reactors. In this way recently a dual-type reactor system instead of a single-type reactor was developed by Rahimpour et al. [26–28]. The dual-type methanol reactor is an advanced technology for converting natural gas to methanol at low cost and in large quantities."
4,Literature review,"1.4 Literature review There are a few investigations on simultaneous pure hydrogen production and methanol synthesis in autothermal membrane reactors. Recently, Rahimpour et al. [6] have considered theoretically the methanol and hydrogen production in a thermally coupled membrane single-type reactor in co-current mode of operation. In their simulated reactor, the exothermic reaction (methanol synthesis) takes place in the inner tube and outer tube (third tube) is permeation side. Besides, shell side and endothermic side (second tube) separated by a Pd–Ag membrane and selective permeation of hydrogen through the Pd/Ag membrane is achieved by co-current flow of sweep gas through the permeation side. Moreover, Rahimpour et al. have considered enhancement of simultaneous hydrogen production and methanol synthesis in thermally coupled double-membrane reactor [29]. Finally, methanol synthesis and cyclohexane dehydrogenation in a hydrogen-permselective membrane and non-membrane thermally coupled reactor using differential evolution (DE) method are optimized by Rahimpour et al. [30,31]. From previous studies, it is obvious that there is no information available in the literature regarding the use of simultaneous Pd/Ag and H-SOD membrane in thermally coupled reactor for pure hydrogen production and methanol synthesis. Therefore, it was decided to first study on this system."
5,Objectives,"1.5 Objectives In the present work, production of pure hydrogen and methanol synthesis is investigated theoretically in a thermally coupled two-membrane multitubular reactor. The endothermic and exothermic reactions are chosen the catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene and methanol synthesis, respectively. The motivation is to combine the energy efficient concept of the coupling of endothermic–exothermic reactions, the membrane-assisted selective separation of hydrogen, in situ water removal and enhancement of simultaneous hydrogen and methanol production in a single reactor. Using Pd–Ag and H-SOD membrane layers for removal of water and hydrogen production shift the equilibrium reactions to the products sides (Methanol and hydrogen). The steady state, 1-D mathematical model of the multitubular two-membrane coupled reactor is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed reactor. Numerical simulation results of the TCTMR were compared with that of conventional reactor and TCMR at same process conditions such as pressure, temperature, catalyst mass and feed composition."
6,Process description,"The conventional reactor is a fixed-bed type resembling a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger. The tubes are packed with catalyst pellet and boiling water is circulating in the shell side to remove the heat of exothermic reactions whereas in thermally coupled reactor, a catalytic dehydrogenation reaction in the endothermic side is used instead of using cooling water in the methanol synthesis reactor. The process of methanol synthesis in the conventional reactor (CR) has been studied by Rahimpour et al. [22]."
7,Thermally coupled membrane reactor (TCMR),"2.1 Thermally coupled membrane reactor (TCMR) The schematic diagram of a thermally couple membrane reactor is presented in Fig. 1 . This system is a three concentric tubes reactor where the inner tube is used for methanol synthesis and the second one is used for dehydrogenation of cyclohexane instead of coolant water in the shell of conventional methanol synthesis reactor. The wall between second and third tubes is a hydrogen-permselective membrane, so that the third tube receives hydrogen permeating from the second one. The characteristics and input data of thermally coupled membrane reactor are listed in Tables 1 and 2 [32,33]. The operating conditions for exothermic side were extracted from Rahimpour’s studies [22]."
8,Thermally coupled multitubular two-membrane reactor (TCTMR),"2.2 Thermally coupled multitubular two-membrane reactor (TCTMR) The integrated two-membrane reactor simulated for simultaneous methanol and hydrogen production is shown schematically in Fig. 2 . Basically, the process in TCTMR is similar to TCMR with exception of some changes. These changes in the new proposed system are as follows: Firstly, the synthesis gas is fed to the shell side of exothermic section and sweeping gas flows in the inner tube of reactor. Secondly, the walls of tubes between first and second tube consist of H-SOD membrane. The pressure difference between these layers is the driving force for diffusion of water through the H-SOD membrane layer. On the other word, it consists of four concentric tubes that the inner tube is permeation side and separated by water-permselective membrane from second tube (exothermic side). Catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene is assumed to take place in the third tube, whereas methanol synthesis occurs inside the exothermic side, with fixed beds of different catalysts on both sides. Therefore, the reacting synthesis gas is cooled simultaneously with sweep gas in the inner tube and reacting gas in endothermic side. Moreover, the wall of the endothermic side is covered with a Pd–Ag membrane. Thus, pure hydrogen can penetrate from the endothermic side into the permeation side (outer tube). The specifications of different sides of TCTMR have been summarized in Table 3 . The input data and operating conditions are the same as TCMR (see Tables 1 and 2)."
9,Reaction scheme and kinetics,
10,Methanol synthesis,"3.1 Methanol synthesis In the methanol synthesis, three overall reactions are possible: hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and reverse water–gas shift reaction. In the current work, the rate expressions have been selected from Graaf et al. [34]. The rate equations combined with the equilibrium rate constants [35] provide enough information about kinetics of methanol synthesis over commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts."
11,Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane,"3.2 Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane The reaction scheme for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene is as follows: (4) C 6 H 12 ↔ C 6 H 6 + 3 H 2 , Δ H 298 = + 206.2 kJ / mol The following reaction rate equation of cyclohexane, r c is used [36]: (5) r c = − k ( K P P C / P H 2 3 − P B ) 1 + ( K B K P P C / P H 2 3 ) where k, K B and K P are respectively the reaction rate constant, the adsorption equilibrium constant for benzene and the reaction equilibrium constant that are tabulated in Table 4 . Pi is the partial pressure of component i in Pa. The reaction temperature is in the range of 423–523K and the total pressure in the reactor is maintained at 101.3kPa. The catalyst is Pt/Al2O3 [37]."
12,Mathematical model,"The following assumptions are considered during the modeling of one and two-membrane heat exchangers catalytic reactor: • One-dimensional heterogeneous model (reactions take place in the catalyst particles) • Steady-state conditions • Plug flow pattern is considered in each sides • Axial diffusion of heat and mass are neglected compared with the convection • No radial heat and mass diffusion in catalyst pellet • Bed porosity in axial and radial directions is constant • Gas mixtures considered to be ideal • Heat loss is neglected According to above assumptions and the differential element along the axial direction inside the reactor, the mole balance equation and the energy balance equation were obtained. The balances typically account for convection, transport to the solid phase and reaction. The mass and energy balances and boundary conditions for solid and fluid phases are summarized in Table 5 . In equations (6) and (7), η is effectiveness factor of kth reaction in jth side (the ratio of the reaction rate observed to the real rate of reaction), which is obtained from a dusty gas model calculations [22]. The detail of such a dusty gas model is available in literature [22]. In equations (8) and (9), β and ϕ are equal to 1 and 0 for the endothermic and 0 and 1 for the exothermic side, respectively. Besides, in equation (9), the positive sign is used for the exothermic side and the negative sign for the endothermic side. In equations (10) and (11), β is equal to 1 for hydrogen component and 0 for the sweep gas. Moreover, in equations (12) and (13), ϕ is equal to 1 for H2O component and 0 for CO2, CO, H2, CH3OH and inert components. In the boundary condition equations yi 0,j g, T 0 g and P 0 g are the fluid-phase mole fraction of ith component, temperature and pressure at the entrance of jth side of reactor."
13,Pressure drop,4.1 Pressure drop The Ergun momentum balance equation is used to give the pressure drop along the reactor: (15) ⅆ P ⅆ z = 150 ( 1 − ɛ ) 2 μ u g ɛ 3 d p 2 + 1.75 ( 1 − ɛ ) u g 2 ρ ɛ 3 d p where the pressure drop is in Pa.
14,Hydrogen permeation in Pd/Ag membrane,"4.2 Hydrogen permeation in Pd/Ag membrane The composite membranes in this study are made of a 6μm thin layer of palladium–silver alloy. The membrane is deposited as a continuous layer on the outer surface of a thermo stable support. The flux of hydrogen permeating through the inner and outer Pd/Ag membrane is assumed to follow the half-power pressure law (Sievert’s law) and is expressed by: (16) J H 2 = 2 π L P 0 ¯ ln ( D o D i ) exp ( − E p R T ) ( P H 2 , 1 − P H 2 , 2 ) P H 2 is hydrogen partial pressure in Pa. D o and D i stand for the outer and inner diameters of the Pd/Ag layer. The pre-exponential factor P 0 above 200°C is reported as 6.33×10−8 molm−2 s−1 Pa−0.5 and the activation energy E p is 15.7kJmol−1 [28]."
15,Water permeation through H-SOD membrane,"4.3 Water permeation through H-SOD membrane The flux of water permeation through the H-SOD membrane, J H 2 O , depends on the water partial pressure difference between two sides of the membrane. (17) J H 2 O = A s V r · Q H 2 O · ( P H 2 O exo − P H 2 O perm ) where Q H 2 O is water permeation and it is a specific property of the membrane. Q H 2 O is constant with respect to temperature and the H2O permeance is in a range of 10−6 and 10−7 mole/m2 sPa [18]."
16,Auxiliary correlations,"4.4 Auxiliary correlations Auxiliary correlations should be added to solve the set of differential equations. The correlations used for heat and mass transfer between two phases, physical properties of chemical species and overall heat transfer coefficient between two sides are summarized in Table 6 . The heat transfer coefficient between gas phase and reactor wall is applicable for heat transfer between gas phase and solid catalyst phase."
17,Numerical solution,"The formulated model composed of 17 ordinary differential equations and the associated boundary conditions lends itself to be an initial value problem. The algebraic equations in the model incorporate the initial conditions, the reaction rates, the ideal gas assumption, as well as aforementioned correlations for the heat and mass transfer coefficients and the physical properties of fluids. These equations along with the discretized ordinary differential equations using backward finite difference form a set of non-linear algebraic equations. The reactor length is then divided into 100 separate sections and the Gauss–Newton method in MATLAB programming environment is used to solve the non-linear algebraic equations in each section."
18,Results and discussions,
19,Model validation,"6.1 Model validation The model of methanol synthesis side was validated against conventional methanol synthesis reactor for a special case of constant coolant temperature under the design specifications. The comparison between simulation and plant data for conventional methanol synthesis reactor is shown in Table 7 . It was observed that the model performed satisfactorily well under special case of industrial conditions and the observed plant data were in good agreement with simulation data. In this section, various steady-state behaviors observed in the co-current coupled reactor are analyzed and the predicted molar flow rate, yield, conversion and temperature profiles are presented. The performance of the thermally coupled reactor is analyzed, using different operating variables, for methanol yield, cyclohexane conversion and hydrogen recovery yield as follows: (18) Hydrogen recovery yield = F H 2 , 3 F C 6 H 12 , in (19) Methanol yield = F CH 3 OH , out F CO , in + F CO 2 , in (20) Methanol selectivity = F CH 3 OH , out ( F CO , in + F CO 2 , in ) − ( F CO , out + F CO 2 , out ) (21) Cyclohexane conversion = F C 6 H 12 , in − F C 6 H 12 , out F C 6 H 12 , in Furthermore, an obvious measure for the performance of the reactor concept is how much heat has to be supplied through the exothermic reaction to maintain the endothermic reaction. The relative heat supply is defined by the fuel ratio Ψ: (22) Ψ = Available heat of exothermic reaction Maximum required heat of endothermic reaction As efficiency of the reactor we define: (23) ξ = Heat actually consumed for endothermic reaction Heat actually released for exothermic reaction Optimal conditions imply ψ →1+ and ξ →1−."
20,Molar flow rate behavior,"6.2 Molar flow rate behavior 6.2.1 Exothermic side Fig. 3(a)–(e) shows the comparison of components molar flow rate in exothermic side of thermally coupled two-membrane reactor with TCMR and CR. The figures show significant difference between the outputs of TCTMR and two other reactors due to water permeation from exothermic side to inner permeation side which results in a considerable enhancement of the reaction yield. Certainly, these figures represent the effect of using membrane in exothermic side in enhancing exothermic reaction conversion. The reactor length can be divided into two sections. The upper section where the reaction kinetic controlling and in the other section the equilibrium is controlling. The difference between simulation results pattern of thermally coupled reactors and conventional reactor is due to delay in thermodynamics equilibrium. The delay in equilibrium for TCMR and TCTMR is due to lower temperature in the endothermic side, provided by the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, compared to the saturated water in the conventional reactor. The small difference between simulation results pattern of TCTMR and TCMR is attributed to the effect of lower temperature in the exothermic side due to utilizing sweeping gas in inner tube side of TCTMR. As can be seen in Fig. 3(b)–(e), the molar flow rate of CO2, CO, H2O and H2 has been compared for three types of reactor. In situ H2O removal accelerates the reverse WGS of CO2 with H2 toward CO, then CO2 and H2 consumption is increased (see Fig. 3(b) and (e)) and also CO and H2O production is suppressed along the thermally coupled two-membrane reactor relative to TCMR and CR (see Fig. 3(c) and (d)). Additionally, lower water production rate in TCTMR reduces catalyst re-crystallization. 6.2.2 Endothermic side Fig. 4(a) and (b) illustrates the molar flow rate of components in the endothermic sides of TCMR and TCTMR. As can be seen, the highest reaction yield is achieved in TCTMR. Using hydrogen permselective membrane in the endothermic side enhances hydrogen and shifts the reaction to benzene production so higher yield of reaction achieves in the thermally coupled reactors. The small difference between TCTMR and TCMR performances is attributed to the positive effect of water permeation into the inner permeation side due to utilizing membrane between exothermic side and inner permeation side in TCTMR. 6.2.3 Outer permeation side The comparison of hydrogen molar flow rate along the thermally coupled membrane reactor (TCMR) and thermally coupled two-membrane reactor (TCTMR) is presented in Fig. 5 . As can be seen, there is an enhancement in amounts of hydrogen molar flow rate in TCTMR due to the increase of hydrogen partial pressure in the endothermic side of TCTMR relative to TCMR. One of the greatest advantages of thermally coupled reactors is production of useful chemicals, simultaneously. The performance of CR, TCMR and TCTMR in the catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to methanol and also in the catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene in order to methanol and pure hydrogen production is summarized in Table 8 . The performance of the TCTMR was better than CR and TCMR, as shown in Table 8. Generally, using water permeation membrane in exothermic side increases the hydrogen recovery, benzene, and methanol yield in both reaction sides. The simulation results represent 6.03 and 7.56% enhancement in the methanol yield in comparison with TCMR and CR, respectively, as shown in Table 8. However, the change in the reactor configuration does not affect significantly the methanol selectivity. Besides, 8.2284 and 12.521% enhancement in the hydrogen recovery yield and cyclohexane conversion (or benzene yield) in comparison with TCMR are seen, respectively. The purity of hydrogen recovery in the thermally coupled reactors is 100% due to using hydrogen permselective Pd–Ag membrane between permeation and endothermic side. According to the above table, this configuration of reactor suggests that the concept of thermally coupled two-membrane reactor is an interesting candidate for production of pure hydrogen and methanol. However, from an industrial point of view there are still many issues to be addressed before putting a case for successful commercialization, such as: difficulties to construct a leak-free membrane reactor with two sides, the catalysts would not age identically, the cost of membranes and it would require a situation where the quantities of the materials to be processed by the two reactions be in the proper balance."
21,Thermal behavior,"6.3 Thermal behavior Fig. 6(a)–(c) shows axial temperature profiles for CR and thermally coupled membrane and two-membrane reactor in different sides of reactor configurations. The highest temperature is observed at the exothermic side, since this is where heat is generated. Part of this heat is used to drive the endothermic reaction and the rest is used to heat the mixtures in both reaction sides (in case of both thermally coupled reactors) and inner permeation side (in case of TCTMR). The temperature of the endothermic side is always lower than that of the exothermic side in order to make a driving force for heat transfer from the solid wall. Along the exothermic side of thermally coupled reactors, temperature increases smoothly and a hot spot develops as demonstrated in Fig. 6(a) and then decreases. The exothermic temperature control of the TCTMR is easier due to lower hot spot. There is not a sudden rises of temperature for this system at reactor entrance. Thus, the most favorable exothermic temperature profile seems that belongs to TCTMR system as a result of simultaneously heat transfer with permeation side in inner tube and reacting gas in endothermic side. At the entrance of endothermic side of TCRs, the temperature decreases rapidly and a cold spot forms and then the temperature increases (see Fig. 6(b)). In situ water removal from the exothermic side shifts the reaction to methanol production and higher yield of reaction achieves and thus more reaction heat is released. This is the reason why endothermic temperature of TCTMR is higher than that of TCMR. As it can be seen in Fig. 6(c), the temperature profile pattern in outer and inner permeation sides is the same as temperature profile pattern in endothermic side. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of fuel ratio and reactor efficiency for both of thermally couple reactors. As it can be seen in this figure, fuel ratio and reactor efficiency values of TCTMR are closer to the optimal conditions relative to those of TCMR. Therefore, the exothermic and the endothermic reaction can be more efficiently coupled in this configuration and an efficient autothermal coupling is achieved without the occurrence of extremely high temperatures. Overall, the operating and design parameters chosen for the reactor configuration lead to efficient coupling of the two reactions. The efficient coupling of exothermic and endothermic reaction in a single vessel reduces the thermal losses associated with the supply of heat for the energy intensive endothermic process."
22,Influence of inlet temperature of endothermic stream,"6.4 Influence of inlet temperature of endothermic stream As it can be seen in Fig. 6(b), there is a cold spot in the endothermic side. This may be attributed to the reasons such as dissimilar reaction rates and heats of exothermic and endothermic reactions. One way of eliminating this cold spot is by using non-similar feed temperature for the exothermic and endothermic streams. Fig. 8 shows the influence of inlet temperature of endothermic stream on the temperature profiles in endothermic and exothermic sides along the reactor length for thermally coupled two-membrane reactor. These are the cases where the cold spot is not observed which are due to suitable temperature driving force for transferred heat from the solid wall. Here the inlet temperature of the endothermic stream (T =490K) is lower than the exothermic stream. This arrangement requires the pre-heating of the exothermic stream and that can be carried out by utilizing the sensible heat of the exothermic stream leaving the reactor. Decreasing the inlet temperature of endothermic stream from 503 to 490K, can decrease the methanol yield from 0.3822 to 0.3773, hydrogen recovery yield from 2.6976 to 2.6123 and cyclohexane conversion from 93.26% to 89.91%, which is due to lower temperature at first parts of reactor and then lower kinetics constants of reactions."
23,Influence of molar flow rate of endothermic stream,"6.5 Influence of molar flow rate of endothermic stream When reactor geometry, inlet operating conditions and catalyst loading are fixed, variations of flow rates result in corresponding variations of fluid velocities and residence times. Fig. 9(a) and (b) shows the influence of molar flow rate of endothermic stream on the temperature profiles of exothermic and endothermic sides along the reactor length, respectively. With increasing the flow rate of endothermic stream, axial temperature variation of exothermic and endothermic sides becomes lower which is due to higher transferred heat from the solid wall. Fig. 9(c) and (d) illustrates how the methanol yield and hydrogen recovery yield behave along the reactor axis when the flow rate of endothermic stream increases from 0.1 to 0.2mols−1. Decreasing of methanol yield is due to lower axial temperature profile (see Fig. 9(a)) and consequently lower rate of reaction. As it can be seen in Fig. 9(d), increasing of molar flow rate of endothermic stream results in hydrogen recovery yield reduction from 2.69 to 1.83 which is due to lower cyclohexane conversion. Cyclohexane conversion significantly decreases from 93.26% to 46.12% (see Fig. 9(e)). Decreasing of cyclohexane conversion is an obvious consequence of the fact that the amount of catalyst on endothermic side is not enough for these higher flow rates. Besides, lower axial temperature profile of endothermic side (see Fig. 9(b)) can result in cyclohexane conversion which is an endothermic reversible reaction."
24,Influence of molar flow rate of outer permeation stream,"6.6 Influence of molar flow rate of outer permeation stream The effect of the outer sweep gas flow rate on reactor performance for the co-current mode is shown in Fig. 10 . With increase in the sweep gas flow rate, the partial pressure of hydrogen in the separation side decreases, leading to increase driving force for the permeation of hydrogen through the Pd/Ag membrane. As a result, hydrogen recovery yield increases. Fig. 10(b) presents the profiles of permeation rate of hydrogen thorough the membrane versus dimensionless length and inlet flow rate of outer permeation side. As shown in this figure, increasing inlet flow rate of the outer permeation side enhances hydrogen permeability along the reactor; hydrogen permeation depends on the hydrogen partial pressure square root difference between the reaction zone and the permeation zone. Consequently, permeation rate of hydrogen enhances when partial pressure square root difference increases."
25,Influence of Pd/Ag membrane thickness,"6.7 Influence of Pd/Ag membrane thickness To enhance the hydrogen recovery yield in thermally coupled membrane reactor, thickness of the membrane should be reduced. Pd-based membranes have a high selectivity for hydrogen but the rate of hydrogen permeation in Pd membrane is low. To overcome this problem many efforts have been made to reduce the thickness of the Pd-based membrane reactor by producing a thin layer of palladium on a support like alumina and stainless steel. Larger pores and the high selectivity of the Pd-based membrane to hydrogen make it possible to obtain both high permeability and selectivity. Fig. 11 illustrates the effect of membrane thickness on the hydrogen recovery yield. As can be seen in this figure, the reduction of membrane thickness from 200μm to 6μm can enhance 254% of hydrogen recovery yield according to the increase in the hydrogen permeation rate at the basic conditions. Also Fig. 11 shows thickness of layer thinner than 100μm has the better efficiency. Decreasing of membrane thickness has a little effect on methanol yield and cyclohexane conversion."
26,Production rate,"6.8 Production rate Fig. 12(a) and (b) presents the comparison of methanol and hydrogen production in CR, TCMR and TCTMR. As demonstrated, the methanol production of TCTMR increases about 9 and 7.18% relative to that of CR and TCMR, respectively. Additionally, an increment about 8.22% in hydrogen production is achieved for TCTMR in comparison with TCMR. This considerable improvement in the methanol and hydrogen production rate of TCTMR is due to utilizing simultaneous hydrogen and water permselective membranes in endothermic and exothermic sides, respectively and also extremely favorable profile of temperature in both sides of TCTMR."
27,Conclusion,"The methanol forming reactions are strongly exothermic and limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, the development of a membrane-based process could open the way to increasing the methanol production in the methanol synthesis process. In this work, thermally coupled two-membrane system (TCTMR) was compared with a thermally coupled membrane reactor (TCMR) and conventional reactor (CR) for simultaneous pure hydrogen production and methanol synthesis. This recuperative configuration as same as TCMR represents some important improvement in comparison to conventional methanol reactor as follows: reduction reactors sizes; production pure hydrogen in the permeation side; increasing rate of methanol synthesis and shifting thermodynamics equilibrium; production of benzene as an additional valuable product; and autothermal conditions are achieved within the reactors. The potential possibilities of the TCTMR were analyzed using a one-dimensional heterogeneous model to obtain the necessary comparative estimates. The simulation results show that there is extremely favorable profile of temperature in exothermic side and represent 6.03 and 7.56% enhancement in the methanol yield in comparison with TCMR and CR, respectively. Also, 8.2284 and 12.521% enhancements in the hydrogen and benzene production relative to TCMR are seen, respectively. Finally, these preliminary simulation results demonstrate that the fixed-bed membrane reactor technology with in situ H2O removal is more efficient for methanol synthesis than a fixed-bed reactor without H2O removal."
