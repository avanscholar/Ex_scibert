0,Introduction,"Due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and ever-growing environmental problems [1], in the past few decades, solar-driven hydrogen (H2) evolution by water splitting has attracted attention as a promising strategy. Although much research has been devoted to using highly efficient photocatalysts for this reaction [2], to date, the sluggish kinetics and endergonic thermodynamics of this reaction have still limited solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies [3]. To improve the H2 evolution performance, most researchers have focused on the effect of hole scavengers (e.g., methanol, trimethylamine and lactic acid), although this strategy is beneficial for accelerating the rate of hydrogen generation, it wastes the energy of the excited holes and limits the associated commercial value [4]. Therefore, replacing the consumption of a sacrificial reagent with a useful organic transformation is of great interest, as this will facilitate H2 generation and the corresponding production of a value-added fine chemical [5,6]. The selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols (BA) to aldehydes is a significant transformation on both laboratory and industrial scales [7]. This reaction can partially oxidize alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes by the photogeneration of holes over a photocatalyst with an appropriate conduction band [8]. Therefore, simultaneously realizing proton reduction and selective alcohol oxidation in a closed photoredox cycle should be possible, and would generate two high-value products, solar fuel and fine chemicals. However, to the best of our knowledge, related reports are scarce. Moreover, due to sluggish carrier separation and improper conduction/valance band positions, most single-component photocatalysts struggle to meet the requirements of this kind of reaction. Thus, developing efficient solar-driven photocatalysts to boost hydrogen generation and simultaneously produce value-added chemicals is challenging and of great importance. As one of the most popular metal oxide materials, CeO2 possesses outstanding physical and chemical properties, admirable optical properties and high photostability [9,10]. Nevertheless, photocatalytic applications of pure CeO2 are hindered by its wide band gap and weak photoabsorption capabilities. Accordingly, various strategies, such as metal deposition [11], defect engineering [12] and texture engineering [13,14], have been developed. Among the proposed methods, combining CeO2 with other materials with a narrow bandgap will extend the light absorption range, effectively separate excitons and suppress the recombination of photoexcited charges, which is of great importance for improving the efficiency of photocatalysts [15]. However, charge separation in conventional CeO2-based heterostructures is improved at the expense of the partial potential energy of the photogenerated hole or electron due to carriers transfer. In comparison, when a bio-inspired all-solid-state direct Z-scheme photocatalyst not only achieved efficient spatial separation of the photoinduced carriers, but also retained its strong photoredox properties for catalytic reactions [16]. Constructing such a high-efficiency Z-scheme photocatalysis system requires two semiconductors with suitable band positions and an efficient interfacial charge transfer path [17,18]. Considering the outstanding photoelectrical characteristics of CeO2, integration with an appropriate semiconductor to form a Z-scheme heterojunction structure is expected to yield an excellent performance for simultaneously generating hydrogen and fine chemicals. Indium zinc sulfide (ZnIn2S4), a typical ternary chalcogenide, possesses a suitable band gap corresponding to visible light absorbing semiconductors, but the rapid recombination and low migration rate of photoinduced charge carriers limits its widespread application [19–21]. Furthermore, ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (NSs) can reduce the diffusion distance of the electron-hole pairs, providing a high surface area and abundant catalytic active sites for photocatalysis [22]. Therefore, a suitable semiconductor for coupling with ZnIn2S4 must be identified to achieve effective photocatalysis. Additionally, the chemical properties of sulfur atoms are similar to those of oxygen atoms, S2− anions could therefore occupy the oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2, favoring the formation of robust interfacial contact between the ZnIn2S4 and CeO2 [23,24]. To this end, assembling ZnIn2S4 NSs with CeO2 to form composite Z-scheme photocatalysts may be an effective strategy for improving the catalytic activity. Herein, we report a CeO2-based all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst consisting of ZnIn2S4 NSs and CeO2 nanorods (NRs) for the solar-driven dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. In this case, ZnIn2S4 NSs were grown in situ on the surface of CeO2 NRs. Such 2D/1D composites with intimate contact can form direct Z-scheme heterostructures that not only increase the specific surface area but also effectively separate and suppress the recombination of charge carriers. As expected, the well-designed CeO2 /ZnIn2S4hybrid presented significantly increased sunlight-driven photocatalytic activity with a photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate of 1496 μmol gcat −1 h-1 and a high selectivity for benzaldehyde. This work will give an important contribution to high-performance photocatalysts and green sustainable energy methods."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Synthesis of Ce-MOFs: Ce-MOFs were synthesized using the reported method [25]. Typically, 1 mmol of Ce(NO3)3.6 H2O and 1 mmol of H3BTC were dissolved in 50 mL of an mixed ethanol/water mixture with stirring. Then, the system was heated in an oil bath at 90 °C for 2 h. After decreasing the temperature to 30 °C, the white product was collected by centrifugation and rinsed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol. Synthesis of Ce-MOF derived CeO2 nanorods: To synthesize the CeO2 NRs, the as-prepared Ce-MOFs were first calcined in air at 150 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then at 500 °C for 2 h at the same heating rate. Synthesis of hierarchical CeO2 /ZnIn2S4heterostructures: Finally, 100 mg of the as-prepared CeO2 NRs was dispersed in 20 mL of H2O (pH = 2.3) with sonication. After 30 min, 5 mL of glycerol was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min. Then, 32.64 mg of ZnCl2, 106.08 mg of InCl3, and 72 mg of thioacetamide were added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min and then heated in an oil bath at 80 °C with continuous stirring for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products were washed with ethanol several times and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C. The obtained products were denoted CeO2/ZnIn2S4, and the theoretical weight ratio of ZnIn2S4:CeO2 was 1:1. In addition, CeO2/ZnIn2S4-0.5 and CeO2/ZnIn2S4-2 were prepared under the same reaction conditions but by adding half and twice the amount of ZnIn2S4 raw material, respectively. Pure ZnIn2S4 NSs were prepared by following a similar synthetic process but without adding of the CeO2 NRs."
3,Performance tests,"2.2 Performance tests Typically, 30 mg of the catalysts and 50 μL of BA were dispersed in 5 mL of acetonitrile and then transferred into a 50 mL Pyrex reaction bottle. Then, the reaction was carried out under a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5 G optical filter. The light intensity was calibrated to 120 mW cm−2 using silicon standard cells. Before irradiation, the solution was degassed by using a mechanical pump and stirred for 30 min in the dark to ensure that the system was anaerobic. During the photocatalytic process, the reaction system was vigorously stirred with a magnetic stirrer, and the reaction temperature was controlled with an electric fan. After each reaction, the generated H2 was detected using a chromatograph (GC7900, Tianmei Sci-Instrument Co. Ltd) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The reaction solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter and then analyzed by gas chromatography (GC 2010 plus, Shimadzu). To ensure the accuracy of the data, the concentration was measured 3 times for each sample. Isotope-labeling experiments using PhCD2OH to obtain labelled oxidation products were performed under identical photocatalytic reaction conditions, and the products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010, Shimadzu). All the peaks of GC were integrated and the actual concentration of each component was obtained from a pre-calibrated plot of peak area versus concentration by an external standardization method. The yield of aromatic aldehydes and the selectivity for aromatic aldehydes were calculated with the following equation: Selectivity=[Caldehyde /(C0- Calcohol)] × 100 % where C0 is the initial concentration of alcohol in the reactor, and Calcohol and Caldehyde are the concentrations of residual reactant and the corresponding product, respectively, at a certain time after the photocatalytic reaction was initiated."
4,Results and discussion,"The hierarchical CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid was synthesized via a low-temperature hydrothermal method [26]. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that Ce-MOF can be fully converted to CeO2 after thermal annealing in air at 400 °C. After treatment, the powder XRD patterns of CeO2 shows peaks at 28°,33°, 47.5° and 56°, which can be assigned to (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystallographic planes of cubic CeO2 (JCPDS No.43-1002) (Fig. 1 ) [27]. With respect to the ZnIn2S4, typical diffraction peaks of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS No.49-1562) were observed. Obviously, the diffraction-peak of CeO2 and ZnIn2S4 were observed in the CeO2 /ZnIn2S4 hybrid, indicating the coexistence of ZnIn2S4 and CeO2 in the hybrid CeO2/ZnIn2S4 materials. The morphology of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 sample was investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As shown in Fig. 2 a–c, many ultrathin ZnIn2S4 NSs grew uniformly on the surfaces of the CeO2 NRs, and the overall 1D structure was maintained. The as-formed 3D CeO2/ZnIn2S4 structures had a random distribution of diameters from 1.5 to 3 μm, and the ZnIn2S4 layers comprised many randomly assembled ultrathin NSs. This hierarchical structure was further confirmed by TEM. As displayed in Fig. 2d–e, the hierarchical structure is composed of well-shaped NRs and NSs, in which the NRs have an average diameter of approximately 60 nm and the NSs are approximately 85 nm in width. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was used to reveal the interfacial interactions between CeO2 and ZnIn2S4. As shown in Fig. 2f, intimate contact was clearly observed at the interface, and the lattice spacings were approximately 3.1 and 3.2 Å, which can be assigned to the (111) plane of CeO2 [14] and the (102) plane of ZnIn2S4 [19], respectively, indicating an tight interfacial contact between CeO2 and ZnIn2S4 in the the CeO2 /ZnIn2S4 hybrid. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterization was performed for further structural verification. As presented in Fig. 2g, the distribution maps of Ce, O, Zn, In and S agreed with the TEM results, the CeO2 /ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite possesses a 3D structure with ZnIn2S4 as the shell surrounding the CeO2 NRs core, which is consistent with above observations, confirming the formation of intimate contact interface between CeO2 and ZnIn2S4. To further analyze the interfacial interactions between CeO2 and ZnIn2S4, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ce 3d, Zn 2p, In 2d, S 2p and O 1s were acquired were acquired for the CeO2 /ZnIn2S4 hybrid (Fig. 3 ). In the Ce 3d spectrum of CeO2, the signal could be deconvoluted into eight peaks. The binding energies of 882.2, 888.8, 898.1, 900.6, 907.3, and 916.4 eV are correspond to μ1, μ3, μ4, ѵ1, ѵ3, and ѵ4, which can be attributed to Ce4+, while μ2 (BE of 884.8 eV) and ѵ2 (BE of 903.6 eV) can be attributed to Ce3d5/2 and Ce3d3/2 of Ce3+ [28]. Obviously, the binding energy of Ce 3d in the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid was 0.2 eV higher than that of CeO2. Similarly observation also occurs in O 1s (Fig. S3). Moreover, a higher proportion of surface oxygen species are present in the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid (BE of 531.7 eV), demonstrating that the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid provide more adsorption site in the photo redox catalysis. In addition, the binding energies of In 3d, Zn 2p and S 2p in CeO2/ZnIn2S4 were shifted towards lower binding energies by ≈ 0.2 eV compared to those of ZnIn2S4. Generally, the binding energy of a constituent element decreases/increases when it obtains/loses electrons [29]. Such shifts revealed the strong interaction between the CeO2 NRs and ZnIn2S4 NSs [30,31]. Accordingly, the Raman spectra (Fig. 3e) showed F2g, TO2 and LO2 modes at 248.7, 298.5 cm−1 and 341 cm−1 in ZnIn2S4 and CeO2 /ZnIn2S4 [32], The major band at 465 cm−1 was attributed to the F2g peakse due to the fluorite-like structures in CeO2 and CeO2 /ZnIn2S4 with [33]. Furthermore, the new peak at 218 cm−1 was assigned to Ce–S bonds, which means interfacial chemical bonding occurs between CeO2 and ZnIn2S4 via Ce–S bonds [34]. All these findings provide clear evidence that a hierarchical CeO2 /ZnIn2S4 hybrid with excellent interfacial interactions was successfully formed. Strong interfacial interactions between two semiconductors are always indicative of charge transfer. Therefore, the energy band structures of composite samples were confirmed by Mott–Schottky plots and Tauc plots. A distinct absorption edge at approximately 413 nm was found for CeO2 NRs, which is consistent a band gap of 3.0 eV (Fig. S2). The intrinsic bandgap of CeO2 being smaller than 3.0 eV is probably due to the surface defect of the sample. After assembly with the ZnIn2S4 NSs, the absorption capability in visible range was enhanced, as the band gap of ZnIn2S4 NSs was calculated to be approximately 2.4 eV. The linear Mott-Schottky plots showing positive slopes are illustrated in Fig. S4, indicating that both CeO2 and ZnIn2S4 are n-type semiconductors [35]. Furthermore, the flatband potentials of CeO2 NRs and ZnIn2S4 NSs were estimated to be approximately -0.42 and -0.9 eV vs NHE, respectively. The VB potentials of CeO2 and ZnIn2S4 can be calculated from the known Tauc plots can be calculated to be 2.58 and 1.5 eV, respectively. (Fig. 3f(I)) Generally, the Ef is close to the flatband potential in n-type semiconductors [36]. Thus, a staggered energy band structure forms between CeO2 NRs and ZnIn2S4 NS with the Ef position of CeO2 much lower than that of ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 3f(I)). When these materials were intimate contact, the electrons tend to move from ZnIn2S4 to CeO2 to achieving Ef level equilibrium [37,38]. After Fermi level alignment is achieved, an interfacial built-in electric field generated in the direction from CeO2 to ZnIn2S4 ( Fig. 3f(II)) [39], accelerating the migration of the photoinduced carriers between CeO2 and ZnIn2S4. To elucidate the Z-scheme mechanism, 5,5- dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N -oxide- assisted EPR (DMPO-EPR) was used to detect the transient radical species ( OH and O2 − radicals) [40,41]. After the samples were exposed to light for 5 min, a clear 1:1:1:1 quartet for the DMPO- O2 − signal was observed in the EPR spectra of both the ZnIn2S4 NSs and CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrids, whereas only weaker signals were observed for the CeO2 NRs (Fig. 4 a). On the other hand, CeO2 NRs and CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrids exhibited stronger DMPO- OH signals with a typical intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1, and no peaks could be detected in the spectrum of ZnIn2S4 NSs (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, none of samples displayed apparent EPR peaks in the dark (Fig. S5), suggesting that the formation of the radical species is dependent on light exposure.Considering the standard potentials of the O2/ O2 −(-0.33 eV vs. NHE) and −OH/ OH (1.89 eV vs. NHE) couples [12], the holes in the VBs of ZnIn2S4 NSs did not seem to thermodynamically favour the formation of OH radicals, and the electrons in the CB of CeO2 NRs could only reduce O2 to O2 − to a small extent. Thus, both the band structure and EPR spectra support the successful formation of the Z-scheme structure in the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 system (Fig. 5 c). In the case of visible light irradiation, the internal electric field would guide the migration of the photogenerated charge carriers following the Z-scheme mode. That is, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of the CeO2 NRs would be transferred to the junction interface and would combine with the photoinduced holes in the VB of the ZnIn2S4 NSs. As a result, the strong reducibility of the electrons in the CB of the ZnIn2S4 NSs and the oxidizability of the holes in the VB of the CeO2 NRs are retained. Therefore, high signal intensities could be detected for O2 − and OH in the DMPO-EPR analysis of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid. To explore the Z-scheme transfer and separation ability of the photogenerated charges, photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted. As depicted in Fig. 5a&b, the order of photocurrent response intensity is CeO2<ZnIn2S4< CeO2/ZnIn2S4-0.5< CeO2/ZnIn2S4-2 < CeO2/ZnIn2S4, The pure CeO2 exhibit the lowest photocurrent response, which can be attributed to wide band gap. Meanwhile, the photocurrent response of ZnIn2S4 is also relatively weak because of its photocorrosion and fast recombination of photogenerated charge. However, the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid exhibited the stronger photocurrent response than the CeO2 NRs and ZnIn2S4 NSs, indicating it offers a greater amount of effective photoinduced electrons and a higher charge separation due to the loading of ZnIn2S4 NSs and formation heterojunctions. Correspondingly, the Nyquist plot of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 presented a smaller semicircle relative to its components both in the dark, suggesting the lower charge transfer resistance was associated with the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid. These results reveal the inhibited recombination and improved transport of charge carriers in the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid due to its unique heterojunction structure. Furthermore, the Z-scheme charge transfer dynamics were probed by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) (Fig. 5c). Obviously, the PL decay kinetics of CeO2/ZnIn2S4 display a longer average fluorescence lifetime (τ = 28.73 ns) than that of CeO2 (τ = 13.91 ns). Moreover, steady-state PL quenching (Fig. 5d) reveals that the photogenerated carriers in CeO2/ZnIn2S4 recombine with a lower efficiency than those in CeO2. The quenched PL intensity and prolonged lifetime indicated faster interfacial charge transfer and more efficient charge separation between CeO2 and ZnIn2S4, which favors charge transfer to the reactive substrates on the photocatalyst surface [42,43]. Undoubtedly, these findings indicate that the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid could be well suited for this photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, the charge separation ability of the Z-scheme system was investigated in depth by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), which has been recognized as a valid method for the direct imaging of photogenerated charge carrier separation in semiconductors. [43,44] The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and the corresponding line profiles of the surface photovoltage (SPV) difference are shown in Fig. 6 . The NRs morphologies in both pristine CeO2 NRs and the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid were observed (Fig. 5a&d). Under the same conditions, the pristine CeO2 NRs exhibited only slight changes in SPV signals upon irradiation ( Fig. 6b&e), most likely due to rapid charge carrier recombination. [45,46] For the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid, distinct negative SPV signals were detected by KPFM, indicating an accumulation of negative charge at the surface.[47,48] Furthermore, the weighted average SPV value of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid was calculated to be approximately 44.7 mV (Fig. 6f), higher than that of the CeO2 NRs (14.8 mV, Fig. 6c) and this difference is significant. This remarkable difference in SPV signals provides direct evidence that the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid material possesses excellent spatial separation of the photoinduced charge carriers. Based on the above discussion, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid can be attributed to the efficient Z-scheme charge separation. The photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples were evaluated in the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA at room temperature under simulated sunlight irradiation for 3 h, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 a. Obviously, the H2 or benzaldehyde (PhCHO) yielding rate over CeO2 NRs or with ZnIn2S4 NSs is substantially lower than that CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid, which indicates the importance of heterostructure to the reaction. When the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 heterostructure was adopted, the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA was significantly improved. Comparing the overall yields using the as-prepared samples, the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 sample provided the best H2 and PhCHO production rates of 664.1 and 1496.6 μmol. gcat −1 h-1, respectively, which are approximately 3.0 and 19.1 times higher than those of the CeO2 materials (223.1 and 78.6 μmol. gcat −1 h-1), respectively. Furthermore, a higher selectivity (>96 %) of the product (PhCHO) was also achieved with the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid than with the CeO2 materials. Such product yields are comparable to those of many other photocatalytic systems for organic transformations or solar H2 evolution reactions (Table S1). When the weight ratio of ZnIn2S4:CeO2 was below or above the optimal ratio, the photocatalytic activity decreased, possibly due to the decrease in the effective interface area (Fig. S6). These results suggested that the hierarchical structure with intimate contact at the interface can facilitate the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. Moreover, the stability of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid was tested for 4 more reaction cycles (3 h for each cycle) (Fig. 7b), and neither the the product production rates nor the selectivity (%) for the desired product obviously changed, indicating the excellent photostability of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid. These observations indicate the remarkable photocatalytic activity of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid material for the dehydrogenation of BA. This good performance might be due to the unique structure of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid and the cooperative interactions between the CeO2 NRs and ZnIn2S4 NSs. To broaden the applicability of this material, the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of different aromatic alcohols (p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, p-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, p-chlorobenzyl alcohol and p-nitrobenzyl alcohol) over the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid material were explored (Fig. S7). The CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid performed well and showed a high selectivity and hydrogenolysis yield with the other aromatic alcohols under simulated solar. These results further suggested that the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid could be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the visible-light-driven photocatalytic dehydrogenation of aromatic alcohols under mild reaction conditions. To determine the reaction mechanisms, a series of control photocatalytic experiments were conducted. As shown in Fig. 7c, almost no BA-to-PhCHO conversion was observed in the absence of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid material or when the catalytic reaction was conducted in the dark (Fig. 7c, column 1 and column 2), indicating that the catalysts and light irradiation are required for the efficient dehydrogenation of BA. In addition, the physical mixture of CeO2 NRs and ZnIn2S4 NSs are displayed a much lower photocatalytic activity than the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid for the dehydrogenation of BA (Fig. 7c, column 3), demonstrating the importance of the close interfacial contacts and strong interactions in the heterostructure for the reaction. Additionally, upon the addition of triethanolamine (a hole scavenger) (Fig. 7c, column 4) or carbon tetrachloride (an electron scavenger) (Fig. 7c, column 5), the photocatalytic dehydrogenation efficiency of aromatic alcohols obviously decreased, indicating that photogenerated holes and electrons play an important role in the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA. This result was further supported by the wavelength dependence of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 7d, the trend in the PhCHO/H2 production rates was consistent with the photoabsorption spectra of the catalysts, revealing that the cooperative photoredox reaction is triggered by the photoexcitation of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid. These analyses suggested that the effective charge separation induced by the Z-scheme heterojunction makes both photoexcited electrons and holes are more available for catalytic reactions. To further evaluate the mechanism of BA photocatalytic dehydrogenation, DMPO-EPR was employed to monitor the reaction in-situ. None of the samples exhibited significant EPR signals in the dark (Fig. S8), suggesting that radical formation is dependent on light. Regarding light exposure, all the samples showed clear EPR signals characteristic of DMPO- C (Fig. 8 a) [8], suggesting that the dehydrogenation of BA was triggered by solar driven photocatalysis. The higher intensity of the signal for the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid indicated that many active C species were generated in this system, implying that effective charge separation is beneficial for energy transfer from the catalyst to the reactant, since photogenerated holes contribute to forming active C species. This result is in accordance with the photoactivity test mentioned above. In addition, the isotope-labeling experiments with PhCD2OH via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) (Fig. S9) showed an obvious PhCDO signal at m/z = 107, confirming that the H atoms of O-H and the α C–H are removed in this photocatalytic dehydrogenation reaction. Accordingly, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of BA over the hybrid catalyst is proposed in Fig. 8b. According to the principle of a Z-scheme, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of CeO2 can readily migrate to the VB of ZnIn2S4 via the internal electronic field, and thus, many reductive electrons and oxidative holes would accumulate in the CB of ZnIn2S4 and in the VB of CeO2, respectively. As a result, the photogenerated holes in the VB of CeO2 results in a strong oxidation potential and could oxidize BA into benzaldehyde and could release two protons. Moreover, the electrons in the CB of ZnIn2S4 are strong enough to reduce H+ to H2."
5,Conclusions,"In summary, a novel hierarchical Z‑scheme CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid was successfully constructed by growing ultrathin 2D ZnIn2S4 NSs on 1D CeO2 NRs for the photocatalytic conversion of aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes with hydrogen evolution. A series of XPS, Raman, PL, EPR and KPFM investigations were used for characterization, and the data confirmed that the Z‑scheme CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid possesses intimate contact at the interface, which can effectively enhance charge separation and transfer, while maintaining the strong redox ability. Thanks to these advantages, the 3D Z‑scheme CeO2/ZnIn2S4 hybrid can significantly boost the photocatalytic transformation of aromatic alcohols to form aldehydes and hydrogen, and the efficiency of the hybrid is higher than that of either the CeO2 NRs or the ZnIn2S4 NSs. This work not only provides new insights for applications of artificial direct Z-scheme metal-oxide-based photocatalysts, but also offers an economical and sustainable dual-use approach for the synthesis of fine chemicals and H2 evolution"
