0,Introduction,"The conversion of alcohols to carbonyl compounds constitutes a fundamental class of industrial processes to produce numerous fine-chemicals and high-added value products. However, many of the current synthesis methods make use of expensive and noxious reagents and solvents, raising big environmental and economic concerns because of poor atom-economy and high E-factor [1]. Thus, since many years great research efforts are devoted to design of efficient solid catalysts for the selective oxidation of alcohols with oxygen, according to Green Chemistry guidelines [1–29]. In this context, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol is usually taken as model reaction because of the great relevance of benzaldehyde for dyestuff, agrochemical, pharmaceutical and perfume industries [30]. Although the superior O2-activation functionality of noble-metals sparks the oxidation of alcoholic substrates under mild conditions [2,4–14], high costs, deactivation by over-oxidation and/or fouling of active sites, and unprecedented safety issues actually hinder their industrial exploitation. In this respect, the need of unconventional reactor designs was stressed to prevent explosion risks and corrosion phenomena [15]. By contrast, bare and promoted MnOx materials are appealing from both the environmental and economic points of view, featuring also a significant activity-selectivity pattern in the green oxidation of alcohols, due to a variety of structures tuning their functionality in wide range of temperature [3,13,16–29]. However, activity loss and the need of regeneration-rejuvenation procedures are generally reported also for such catalysts [3,13,16,18–24,29]. Concerning the working mechanism, kinetic studies indicate that a typical Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction pathway, characterized by strong adsorption phenomena, determine the activity-stability pattern of noble-metals [2,3], while the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism provides a rough understanding of the surface reaction cycle driven by MnOx catalysts [2,3,16,25,29]. On this account, the synergism between experiment and quantum chemistry calculation, mostly based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), can turn out essential to highlight the fundamental aspects of the catalytic reactions, assisting the design of new catalysts and the active sites optimization for a given process. In particular, cluster catalysis [31–33] is the area where this synergy manifests all its power [34,35]. In this respect, the unusual variety of structures and exotic properties of clusters are exploited to obtain new and tunable forms of catalysts, also in consideration of the high efficiency of catalysts shaped in the form of small clusters dispersed on a proper support [36–42]. Therefore, this work presents a systematic computational study of the benzyl alcohol oxidation on a model Mn4O8 cluster to shed light into the mechanistic issues of the reactivity pattern of bare and promoted (i.e., CeOx and FeOx) manganese oxide catalysts in the green oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. A thorough DFT analysis of the interactions of Mn(IV) centers with reagent and product molecules unveils the essential requirements of active sites and the elementary steps and intermediates accounting for the activity-selectivity-stability pattern of the studied catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Computational analysis,"2.1 Computational analysis All calculations were performed in the DFT framework by using the M06-L exchange–correlation functional [43], which resulted reliable when treating inorganic compounds and when dispersion interactions may be relevant [44]. In particular, the accuracy of M06-L on determining barrier heights was already tested on a number of reactions involving transition metals [45–47], and can be quantified on the base of an averaged mean unsigned error of ca. 10 kJ mol−1. The Stuttgart ’97 Relativistic Small Core effective potential along with its valence double zeta basis set [48,49] was used for the Mn atoms; these was coupled with the cc-pvDZ basis set for lighter elements. The Gaussian 09 package was employed [50]. Minima and transition states related to the reaction mechanisms, in the following thoroughly discussed in terms of vibrational zero-point corrected energies, were characterized by inspection of the harmonic vibrational frequencies. Interaction energies, evaluated as the difference between the energy of the whole system and the energies of its constituents, were corrected for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) by means of counterpoise procedure [51]."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The bare (M) and Ce (M3C1) or Fe (M3F1) promoted MnOx catalysts were prepared by the redox-precipitation technique consisting of the titration in acidic solution (pH, 4.5 ± 0.5) of the Mn(NO3)2·4H2O and/or FeSO4·7H2O precursors with aqueous solutions (0.2 L) of KMnO4-Ce(NH3)2(NO3)6. After titration, the solids were digested, filtered, washed with hot distilled water, dried at 373 K (16 h) and further calcined in air at 673 K (6 h) [22,52]."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were performed to determine the chemical composition of the catalysts. Surface area (SA), pore volume (PV) and average pore diameter (APD) data were obtained by elaboration of nitrogen adsorption isotherms (77 K) by the BET and BJH methods, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data in the range of 10-80° were obtained at scan rate of 6°·h−1 using the Ni β-filtered Cu Kα radiation (40 kV; 30 mA). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained by a spectrometer operating with a monochromatized Al-Kα radiation (300 W). The B.E. regions of C1s-K1s (280–300 eV), O1s (525–535 eV), Mn2p (635–680 eV), Fe2p (700–740 eV) and Ce3d (870–935 eV) were calibrated taking the C1s line of adventitious carbon (284.8 eV) as reference. Temperature Programmed Reduction analyses in the range of 293–773 K were performed using a quartz reactor (wcat, 20 mg), heated at the rate of 12 K·min−1 and fed with a 5% CO/He (CO-TPR) carrier (F, 60 stp mL·min−1) [22]. The patterns are normalised to the MnOx content of the samples (Table 1 )."
5,Catalyst testing,"2.4 Catalyst testing Catalytic tests in the aerobic liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) with oxygen were carried out into a 3-necked pyrex glass flask reactor containing a toluene solution (Vtot, 50 mL) of benzyl alcohol and ethyl benzoate as internal standard. Benzyl alcohol concentration was varied between 0.04 and 9.70 mol·L-1, the latter corresponding to the absence of solvent. The suspension was stirred and heated at the reaction temperature in O2 flow (60 stp mL·min−1) adding, then, powdered catalyst samples corresponding to concentrations going from 0.4 to 49 g·L−1 [22,29]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Modeling approaches,"3.1 Modeling approaches 3.1.1 Why the Mn4O8 cluster? The catalytic model on which the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol was simulated is a Mn4O8 cluster, tailored from a pyrolusite lattice. Its geometry was optimized in all possible spin multiplicity states having values ranging in-between 1 and 17 (i.e., ranging the S value in-between 0 and 8). The results obtained revealed that Mn4O8 in its most stable state has 12 unpaired electrons. Intermediate species and transition states belonging to the reactions mechanism were explored taking into account possible spin coupling/uncoupling by considering one unit either lowering or increasing, starting from the multiplicity value of the pristine Mn4O8 cluster (i.e., 13). In its most stable spin multiplicity state, Mn4O8 has a C2 h symmetry, hence two different coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) Mn sites, and three not equivalent O-atoms characterize the model, as shown in Fig. 1 . In passing, it is to be underlined that the dangling oxygen (O1) atoms showed a peculiar behaviour, being not involved in the starting reaction path. However, it was observed that other dangling oxygen atoms (O1c) could be formed along the reaction path (v. infra), resulting basic for closing the catalytic loop through the production of a water molecule. Notably, the model Mn4O8 cluster is representative of the CUS Mn(IV) sites present at the surface of MnOx catalysts considered in the study (v. infra). In fact, given the number of atoms considered in the Mn4O8 cluster and the stoichiometry of pyrolusite — beyond the actual computational optimizations performed, which confirm the following inference — it is not possible to find a higher symmetry or a different topology for the suggested model. In addition, the experimental evidences relating to the structural and kinetic characterizations previously carried out on the catalysts simulated in this study [22,29,52] clearly show, either for bare or promoted MnOx catalysts, a very high dispersion of the MnO2 phase and a catalytic activity attributable to quasi-monodisperse catalytic nanoformations, straightforwardly compatible with the Mn4O8 model. That the suggested model is heuristic, in any case, is confirmed by the adsorption results of the reagents and products, of the oxidation process, studied on a double-sized cluster, Mn8O16, treated at the same level of calculation as the smallest one. These indeed showed i) variations in the multiplicity of spin consistent with the increase of the cluster size, ii) similar trends in the adsorption energetics and, in some cases, iii) deviations in the absolute adsorption values lower than 2%, as shown in Fig. S1 of SI. 3.1.2 Benzyl alcohol adsorption At first, different adsorption geometries of benzyl alcohol on Mn4O8 were tested. The benzyl alcohol molecule can either interact with the two Mn sites of the catalyst by its oxygen atom, leading to the O-Mn(A) and O-Mn(B) adducts respectively, or by the phenyl group, forming the C6H5-Mn(A) adduct. In passing, it has here to be stated that the same nomenclature will be in the following employed to label the reaction mechanisms arising from the three homonym adsorption geometries. Both O-Mn(A) and C6H5-Mn(A) adducts exhibit side interactions, while in the O-Mn(B) adsorption geometry the phenyl group partially lies above the cluster. In all cases, however, the most stable spin-state configuration was found to be 13, as already found for the isolated cluster. The three adsorption geometries are shown in Fig. 2 . The relevant Mn-O distances involving the alcohol group are 2.13 and 2.10 Å in O-Mn(A) and O-Mn(B), respectively, while 2.35 Å is the distance between Mn(A) and the closest carbon atom belonging to the phenyl group in C6H5-Mn(A). According to these findings, the most stable system is O-Mn(A), with a BSSE corrected interaction energy of −128.0 kJ mol−1, followed by the other A site adsorption (−96.6 kJ mol−1). Much less favorable (−58.5 kJ mol−1) is the alcoholic oxygen interaction with the Mn(B) site. To evaluate feasible structural changes in the alcohol molecule after the adsorption, O-CH2 and O-H bond distances were analyzed. As expected, an O-CH2 bond distance elongation (~1.45 Å) in the O-Mn(A) and O-Mn(B) adsorbates with respect to the isolated benzyl alcohol (1.41 Å) was observed, highlighting the oxygen interaction with the catalyst. Whereas, in the C6H5-Mn(A) case no changes were recorded. Also, the O-C-C-C dihedral angle value (θ) allows one to distinguish among the adsorption geometries: θ is, indeed, equal to 142° and 70° in O-Mn(A) and O-Mn(B), where the O atom interacts with Mn, while is almost 0° (as for isolated alcohol) in C6H5-Mn(A). The alcohol geometry distortion in O-Mn(B) is likely responsible for the weak adsorption energy, since a strong repulsion between H-atoms of phenyl and CH2 group is evident. Finally, it is noteworthy that the adsorption did not affect the O-H bond length, being its value unchanged in all the cases. 3.1.3 Benzaldehyde formation Once benzyl alcohol is adsorbed, its oxidative dehydrogenation takes place, forming a benzaldehyde molecule and leaving two H-atoms on the Mn4O8 cluster. The first step in the O-Mn(A) reaction pathway (reported in Fig. 3 ) is the hydroxyl hydrogen transfer to the O3 atom of the catalyst, a process having an energy barrier of 38.1 kJ mol−1. The resulting intermediate is found to be slightly less stable than the reactant. For the second hydrogen loss, a peculiar molecular orientation is required. In fact, once a CH2 hydrogen is directed towards the O2 atom, the generation of an adsorbed benzaldehyde molecule can be observed, in turn resulting by the previous formation of the transition state TS2, characterized by an energy barrier of 73.5 kJ mol−1. It is interesting to notice that the multiplicity spin state of the system, from the value of 13 decreased to 11. Providing 110.8 kJ mol−1 of energy, benzaldehyde desorbs and the remaining Mn4O8-HH hydrogenated species must be dehydrogenated in order to restore the pristine catalyst, hence closing the catalytic cycle. This topic is discussed in the next paragraph. The C6H5-Mn(A) and O-Mn(B) pathways are collected in Fig. 4 . The C6H5-Mn(A) oxidation route implies, at first, the hydroxyl-hydrogen transfer to the O1 atom, overcoming an energy barrier of 76.8 kJ mol−1. After the O1-H group freely rotates, the reaction can proceed in two different ways. The first possibility is the direct transfer of the CH2 hydrogen to the catalyst O3 site, with an energy barrier of 46.2 kJ mol−1. The benzaldehyde-Mn4O8-HH adduct is found to be in spin multiplicity state of 15. Alternatively, one hydrogen atom could be subjected to intramolecular migration from CH2 to the alcoholic oxygen and subsequently transferred to O1. Thus, co-adsorbed benzaldehyde and water would be formed. Yet, if compared to the direct hydrogen loss, the energy barrier associated with the intramolecular process is too high (177.8 kJ mol−1) and, as a consequence, this pathway was not further considered. Also the last investigated O-Mn(B) reaction mechanism begins with the hydroxyl hydrogen transfer to the O1 atom, overcoming an energy barrier of 68.7 kJ mol−1. As for the C6H5-Mn(A) case, both the direct CH2 hydrogen transfer to the catalyst and the intramolecular H-shift, followed by the H2O formation were observed. Once again the first was found to be strongly preferred, being the energy barriers for the two processes 60.5 and 202.2 kJ mol−1, respectively. The O-Mn(A) path, characterized by the highest interaction energy and involving the lowest energy barriers, was finally considered to be the most likely to occur during the benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde on the Mn4O8 cluster. Hence, it was the only mechanism further investigated. 3.1.4 Formation of the intermediate Mn4O9 cluster To restore the oxidized form of the catalyst originated from the O-Mn(A) mechanism, the desorption of an H2 molecule was initially hypothesized. However, the H-H distance (∼3.8 Å) is too large for the two atoms to directly interact and bond. As a consequence, hydrogen hopping steps to Mn or O atoms were taken into consideration. However, according to the found energy barriers that are higher than 120 kJ mol−1, also the hopping process could be regarded as kinetically unfavorable. Since the modeling approach mimics the experimental process carried out under oxygen flow, the adsorption of one O2 molecule on the Mn4O8-HH intermediate was hypothesized. A µ 1 geometry on the Mn(A) was observed and the interaction energy was calculated to be −67.7 kJ mol−1. Fig. 5 details the proposed mechanism for the transformation of Mn4O8-HH in aerobic conditions. First, the O2-bounded hydrogen moves to the nearest dangling oxygen atom, with an energy barrier of 33.1 kJ mol−1. Next the second hydrogen is transferred to the same oxygen atom, crossing an energy barrier of 60.8 kJ mol−1, with the subsequent formation of one water molecule. The desorption of the latter was found to require 118.7 kJ mol−1. The catalytic cycle however is not closed yet, since the residual fragment, Mn4O9, has an extra oxygen atom with respect to the starting Mn4O8 cluster. The reaction of the Mn4O9 with a second alcohol molecule will be discussed in the next paragraph. 3.1.5 Third step: benzyl alcohol oxidation on Mn4O9 In order to mimic this step, three different adsorption sites of benzyl alcohol on the Mn4O9 cluster were considered, as the two Mn(A) atoms are now not equivalent. For the sake of clarity, the Mn site of the Mn4O9 cluster bonding the extra O-atom is relabeled Mn(C) while O1c now denotes the just mentioned extra oxygen atom. As a matter of fact, the O-Mn(C) adsorption geometry was found to be the most stable, with a BSSE corrected interaction energy of −167.5 kJ mol−1 and a spin multiplicity which decreased to 11 after adsorption. The O-Mn(B) and O-Mn(A) follow in the order, being the interaction energies −154.2 and −137.5 kJ mol−1, respectively. The proposed reaction mechanism on Mn4O9 is shown in Fig. 6 . The hydroxyl hydrogen is transferred to the O1c atom, requiring the overcoming of an energy barrier of 53.3 kJ mol−1; afterwards, a negligible energy barrier of 7.3 kJ mol−1, associated with the CH2 hydrogen transfer to the same O1c, transforms INT1 to INT2, that is benzaldehyde and water co-adsorbed on the restored Mn(A) site of the Mn4O8 cluster. Desorption energy for both benzaldehyde and water was calculated to be 231.7 kJ mol−1, whereas benzaldehyde removal from the hydrated cluster requires only 93.3 kJ mol−1. This last process closes the catalytic cycle on the Mn4O8 cluster, which transforms two benzyl alcohol molecules into two benzaldehyde and two water molecules, with a calculated Gibbs free energy difference of −181.4 kJ mol−1. However, these data also lead to infer that an over-oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid could take place before benzaldehyde desorbs [29]. These topics deserve further investigations to unveil the role of water during the formation of benzaldehyde and of oxygen from both gas-phase and catalyst in the over-oxidation processes [29]."
8,Experimental findings,"3.2 Experimental findings 3.2.1 Catalyst structure and redox properties Bare and promoted (i.e., CeOx and FeOx) MnOx materials were prepared by redox-precipitation reactions of suitable precursors, because of the recognized efficiency of the technique to promote the oxide dispersion and the formation of oxide nanodomains exposing Mn(IV) sites with size and structure comparable to the model Mn4O8 cluster [22,52,53]. The main physico-chemical properties of the catalysts (Table 1) and forthcoming characterization data support this assumption, strengthening the consistency of the study. First, the XRD data in Fig. 7 show that the addition of promoters hinders any crystalline MnOx structure in the promoted systems. At variance, the bulk M system displays a set of peaks consistent with the XRD pattern of α-MnO2 and/or cryptomelane-type structures (JCPDS 44-0141) [22,25,28,52,54,55]. Indeed, chemical composition data indicate a K/Mn atomic ratio of 0.13 (Table 1), which is typical of tunnel-structured α-MnO2 species (i.e., KMn8O16) [25,54,55]. Ceria promoted catalyst misses such peaks, showing some broad reflexes of ceria nanoparticles and a small peak at ~37° due to the incipient genesis of MnO2 nanodomains [22,52]. Absence of cerianite reflexes and amorphous structure of the iron-oxide phase render in fact more evident two peaks at ~37° and ~66° in the XRD pattern of the M3F1 material, also ascribable to the nascent MnO2 phase. The substantial lack of long-range crystalline order of M3C1 and M3F1 materials proves the effective role of ceria and iron oxide as structural promoters favoring the dispersion of the MnOx phase and surface area values considerably larger than the bulk M system (Table 1). Despite the M3C1 catalyst has the largest surface area (184 m2·g−1) and pore volume (0.57 cm3·g−1), all the systems are characterized by similar mesoporous texture and average pore diameter (27–31 nm). Moreover, XPS characterization data signal a negligible influence of promoters on the chemical properties of the MnOx phase (Fig. 8 ). Indeed, XPS data indicate surface concentrations of Mn, Ce and Fe matching the composition of promoted catalysts (Table 1), supporting XRD evidences on the high dispersion of the oxide phases. Further, unchanging center position of the Mn2p 1/2 peak (642.2 ± 0.2 eV) and spin–orbit splitting value of Mn2p 1/2 -Mn2p 3/2 peaks (11.8 eV) unveil the prevalent contribution of surface Mn(IV) atoms (60–85%), irrespective of composition. Indeed, the promoted catalysts feature similar average oxidation number (AON) of surface Mn atoms (+3.76/+3.82), slightly lower than the bulk M sample (+3.92), while the crucial influence of surface Mn(IV) sites on the oxidation activity is evident from the CO-TPR patterns in Fig. 8. These show two peaks at 453 K and 603 K for Ce- and Fe- promoted systems, which shift upward for the bulk MnO2 sample (518 K and 653 K). Namely, the first peak monitors the reduction of surface–subsurface Mn(IV) atoms, while the smaller peak at higher temperature accounts for the final reduction of minor amounts of Mn2O3-Mn3O4 species to MnO [22,52,53]. In the light of above data, the upward shift of the first peak reflects a higher crystallinity of MnO2 domains of the bulk material and, thus, lower exposure and defectivity of surface Mn(IV) centers in comparison to promoted systems. While, minor changes in the onset reduction (303–323 K) rule out significant chemical effects of promoters on the reactivity of surface Mn(IV) sites [22,52,53]. Moreover, considering that the CO consumption at T > 673 K of the M3F1 catalyst is due to the incipient reduction of Fe(III) ions, the peak area indicates extents of CO consumptions (COmol/Mnat, 0.87–1.0) consistent with the AON probed by XPS analysis (Table 1). Thus, CO-TPR data reveal an easy catalyst reducibility due to the reactivity of O-atoms in the neighboring of surface Mn(IV) atoms, likely constituting the defective sites (e.g., CUS) of MnO2 nanodomains. Thus, high reactivity toward CO, structure and surface properties of the catalysts suggest that surface Mn(IV) sites, similar to the model Mn4O8 cluster of computational analysis, shape the redox functionality of bare and promoted catalysts. 3.2.2 Activity pattern The concentration profiles of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde, recorded with bare and promoted catalysts during 3 h of reaction time (T, 343 K), depict specular exponential trends, accounting for a complete conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, similarly to what observed for the bare MnO2 catalyst (Fig. 9 ). A reliable C-mass balance proves that adsorption phenomena do not affect the alcohol conversion and that benzaldehyde is the sole reaction product. Indeed, under the same conditions, the M3C1 catalyst drives the oxidation of benzaldehyde with much slower rate, reaching a conversion of 5% in 5 h. These evidences rule out the occurrence of nucleophilic oxidation paths, substantiating the electrophilic character of active oxygen species (i.e., O2 −, O2 =) involved in the surface reaction (v. supra). Analogous activity-selectivity patterns and kinetic data in Fig. 10 confirm that the promoters do not affect the functionality of surface active Mn(IV) sites (v. supra) [22,52,53]. In fact, mirroring the effects of MnOx loading and dispersion, all the catalysts show similar rate values in the range of 333–363 K (Fig. 10A). However, referred to surface area, the bulk M sample features the highest activity (Fig. 10B), due to the largest exposure of Mn(IV) sites, while the promoted catalysts feature analogous MnOx-site activity values (e.g., TOF), systematically higher than the bulk M system (Fig. 10C), owing to higher MnOx dispersion and no chemical effects of promoters (v. supra). Anyway, unchanging activation energy values (Eapp , 52–57 kJ·mol−1) strengthen the evidence that the functionality of the catalysts in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol depends on the reactivity of surface Mn(IV) centers, irrespective of composition. 3.2.3 Mechanistic evidences The reliability of DFT predictions on the reaction path driven by the model Mn4O8 cluster was definitively ascertained by the following kinetic-mechanistic findings. Despite the concentration trends of reagent and product during time apparently suggest 1st-order kinetics on alcohol concentration (Fig. 9), a set of measurements (XAlc → 0) varying alcohol (0.04–9.7 mol·L -1 ) and catalyst (0.4–49 g·L -1 ) concentration (Tab. S1 of SI) shows, in fact, unchanging rate values (0.019 ± 0.002 molAlc·gcat −1·h−1) denoting rather a 0th-order dependence (Fig. S2 of SI) [29]. Since an over-reduction of the catalysts can be ruled out (v. infra), these peculiar kinetics are diagnostic of a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type reaction path, rate limited by adsorption–desorption processes of reactants and products (r.d.s.) [29], as suggested by the energy barriers calculated by DFT analysis. In fact, the role of catalyst oxygen and gas-phase O2 on the surface reaction path was assessed comparing the activity data of the studied catalysts in absence and in the presence of oxygen [29]. Considering that similar results were obtained in all the cases, in particular, the M3C1 catalyst drives the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in absence of gas phase O2 (i.e., N2 flow), attaining a conversion degree in the first five minutes (10–15%) similar to that in O2 (Fig. S3 of SI). The conversion rises slowly to 25% in the successive 10 min, keeping thereafter unchanged during 4 h, while the presence of oxygen favors a full alcohol conversion after ca. 3 h. Therefore, these findings prove that catalyst surface oxygen species spark the oxidation of the substrate, mimicking the first step of the oxidation of the first benzyl alcohol molecule on the Mn4O8 cluster (Fig. 3). However, considering that the produced aldehyde (0.6 mmol) corresponds to an oxygen consumption much lower than catalyst lattice oxygen (~3 mmol) and that O2 flow restores an activity level comparing to that recorded in a 2nd reaction cycle (Fig. S3 of SI), it can be argued that the studied catalysts drive a surface redox path, sustained by gas phase oxygen. According to DFT prediction, this accomplishes the oxidation of the 2nd alcohol molecule with formation of water molecule and the replenishment of the active site (Figs. 5 and 6). At this stage, the only apparent inconsistence of experimental data relies in the shape of conversion trends (Fig. 9), clearly mismatching the 0th-order kinetics on benzyl alcohol concentration (Fig. S2 of SI). This can be explained by our previous findings, indicating an ongoing catalyst deactivation due to the slow formation of benzoic acid, poisoning the active sites [29]. In this respect, the negligible benzaldehyde oxidation functionality of the catalysts coupled to DFT data on the energy of water-benzaldehyde desorption (v. supra) suggest that the formation of benzoic acid is not due to a typical Mars-van Krevelen path. However, the molecular aspects of acid formation and catalyst deactivation are out of the scopes of the present work, being the topics of ongoing theoretical evaluations and experimental studies."
9,Conclusions,"A DFT analysis of a model Mn4O8 catalyst in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with O2 has been performed. Bare and promoted MnOx catalysts with high dispersion of surface Mn(IV) sites were prepared and tested in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol for comparative purposes. DFT analysis of the interactions of reagent and product molecules with Mn(IV) sites indicates five elementary steps accounting for the activity-selectivity-stability pattern of the MnO2 catalysts. The most intimate atomistic issues of the catalytic process indicate a typical L-H type mechanism leading to benzaldehyde formation: (1) σO + C6H5-CH2OH ⇆ σO⋯OHCH2-C6H5 (2) σO⋯OHCH2-C6H5 ⇆ σO(H)2 + C6H5-CHO (3) σO(H)2 + O2 ⇆ σO-(H)2⋯O2 (4) σO-(H)2⋯O2 ⇆ σO-O + H2O (5) σO-O + C6H5-CH2OH ⇆ σO-O⋯C6H5-CH2OH (6) σO-O⋯C6H5-CH2OH ⇆ σO + H2O + C6H5-CHO where σO and σO-O represent the pristine and per-oxidized forms of the Mn(IV) site of the model Mn4O8 cluster. Catalyst deactivation phenomena are due to the consecutive oxidation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid, acting as poison of the active Mn(IV) sites. The role of adsorbed water and the oxygen species leading to the formation of benzoic acid are the topics of ongoing theoretical and experimental investigations."
