0,Introduction,"Bio-oil is a liquid produced from the thermal deconstruction of biomass that superficially resembles petroleum. Both are dark, viscous liquids consisting of hundreds of organic compounds [1]. This similarity has encouraged attempts to hydroprocess bio-oil in a manner similar to that employed for petroleum, which has not been altogether successful. Such a facile comparison is overshadowed by the striking differences between the two substances. Petroleum consists of non-polar hydrocarbons that are relatively stable, requiring elevated temperatures and pressures (400–800°C and 68–138bar) [2] to encourage chemical transformations, whereas bio-oil consists of oxygenated organic compounds with high degrees of functionality that make them chemically reactive even at low temperatures and pressures. The liquid product of fast pyrolysis, widely known as bio-oil, is an emulsion of predominantly lignin-derived phenolic oligomers in an aqueous phase containing primarily carbohydrate-derived compounds [3]. Bio-oil has several characteristics that make it undesirable as fuel [4] including poor storage stability [5], high acidity and corrosivity [5,6], low heating value, high viscosity, incomplete volatility [5], and immiscibility with petroleum fuels [3,7]. The key problem with upgrading bio-oil is its poor thermal stability at elevated temperatures, leading to heavy tar and coke formation, which rapidly deactivates upgrading catalysts [8–10]. Even when stored for long periods or heated in the absence of catalysts, bio-oil tends to polymerize [11]. Unfortunately, these polymerization/condensation reactions are accelerated by the elevated temperatures typically employed in hydroprocessing [8] making severe hydroprocessing of raw bio-oil counterproductive to achieving high carbon yields of fuel-range molecules. Recognizing that the high reactivity of bio-oil is a barrier to upgrading, researchers have attempted to stabilize bio-oil at milder hydroprocessing conditions. Baker and Elliott [12] reduced hydroprocessing temperature to around 250–270°C from approximately 400°C to prevent coking at 140bar in the presence of cobalt and molybdenum (CoMo) catalyst. Although hydrogenation occurred with a conversion of 69vol%, the loss of water and the saturation of carbon bonds increased the viscosity of the bio-oil from 10cP to 14,200cP at 60°C [12]. Pacific Northwest National Laboratories also devised a three-stage process for hydrotreating bio-oil [13]. The first two stages, characterized as hydrotreating at 240°C, 170bar and 370°C, 137bar, respectively, were intended to partially deoxygenate and stabilize the bio-oil followed by more severe hydrocracking/hydrodeoxygenation at 425°C, 87bar to produce fuel-range hydrocarbon molecules [13]. Although partially successful, carbon yields under these conditions was still relatively modest and rapid coking of catalysts was still a problem. Chaiwat et al. [14] performed a series of mild hydroprocessing tests on bio-oil at 175–300°C and 56–184bar pressure from 70 to 1380min. The products obtained consisted of oil phase, water phase, and heavy compounds. The oil phase collected consisted of 7.8–63.8wt% while the aqueous phase ranged from 30.2 to 54.4wt%. The heavy compounds were 2.2–23.7wt% of the product [14]. It was not clear whether the heavy compounds were suitable for hydrocracking to fuel range molecules, but the yield of potentially upgradable compounds was unacceptably low for commercial application. In light of the high reactivity of phenolic oligomers, we explore the possibility that even so-called mild hydroprocessing, as currently defined, is too severe for the reactive feedstocks derived from biomass. We propose low-temperature, low-pressure (LTLP) hydrogenation of phenolics derived from bio-oil with the goal of producing a stable, low viscosity product at high yields."
1,Material and methods,"The phenolics used in these experiments was produced by the fast pyrolysis of cornstover and red oak. As-received biomass was passed through a 60hp hammer mill equipped with a 3mm screen; resulting in a particle range of approximately 200μm–3mm. Fast pyrolysis was performed in a fluidized bed reactor with a staged bio-oil recovery system [15]. Stage 1, a condenser, collects high boiling point compounds (i.e. anhydrosugars and phenolic oligomers) in the vapor phase according to dew point temperatures with the temperature controlled utilizing a shell-and-tube heat exchanger operated with gas inlet and outlet temperatures of 345°C and 102°C, respectively. Stage 2 is an electrostatic precipitator that collects aerosols formed during pyrolysis or during cooling in stage 1. It is operated at 40kV DC and heat traced to 129°C to prevent premature vapor condensation [15]. The five stages of bio-oil recovery are used with the purpose of separately collecting both the vapors and aerosols of the oligomer-rich phenolics and sugars in stages 1 and 2, a middle cut of monomeric phenols and furans in stages 3 and 4 and an aqueous phase that contains the large majority of “light oxygenates” in stage 5. Stages 1 and 2 is approximately 40–45wt% of the produced bio-oil and account for 65–75% of the carbon in bio-oil. The middle cut, stages 3 and 4 are 10wt% of the produced bio-oil while stage 5 is 45–50wt% of the produced bio-oil [16]. Given that 65–75% of the carbon in bio-oil is collected in stages 1 and 2, it is important to establish the commercial importance of stabilization and utilization of upgrading techniques for both fuel and chemical applications. Complete details of the reactor design and collection system are found in Pollard et al. [16] and Rover et al. [15]. The phenolics used in these experiments were recovered in stages 1 and 2 and collected in fractions 1 and 2. Although all fractions might benefit from improved stabilization, the phenolic oils recovered from stages 1 and 2 are particularly susceptible to polymerization and viscosity thickening in storage and were selected for LTLP hydrogenation in this study. All experiments were performed at 21°C and 1bar (absolute) pressure. A water wash was used to separate the water soluble sugars from the water insoluble phenolics utilizing a 1:1 ratio of deionized water to fractions 1 and 2 bio-oil. The resulting solution was stirred, placed on a shaker table (MaxQ 2506, Thermo Scientific, Hanover Park, IL) for 30m at 250motionsmin−1 and centrifuged (accuSpin 1R, Thermo Scientific, Hanover Park, IL) at 2561g force for 30min. The water soluble portion (sugar-rich solution) was decanted [17]. The phenolics prepared from cornstover (CS) bio-oil were produced and stored at 5°C for six months prior to hydrogenation. The phenolics prepared from red oak (RO) were immediately hydrogenated after their production. This difference in the time of preparation was not originally thought to be important although, as subsequently described, there was some evidence that the stored corn stover sample oligomerized (aged) even in cold storage. Sample size for the hydrogenation was approximately 100g of both cornstover fractions 1 and 2 phenolics, which were placed separately in a 1000mL round bottom flask along with a large stir bar. Fraction 1 was dissolved in 300mL methanol and fraction 2 was dissolved in 500mL methanol. Sample size for red oak fractions 1 and 2 phenolics was 40g dissolved in 200mL and 300mL methanol, respectively. The flask was placed under vacuum 3 times to remove any oxygen present and then purged each time with argon. The catalyst (1.5g for cornstover and 0.5g for red oak), 10% Pd/C, was quickly added to the round bottom flask. Higher catalyst loading was utilized for the cornstover samples in order to achieve favorable results, whereas, lower catalyst loading was sufficient for the red oak phenolic oils. The Pd/C catalyst used for hydrogenation of the phenolics was chosen for its high activity at mild processing conditions [18] and the ability to recover the Pd metal by simply burning off the carbon support [19–21]. The flask was again placed under vacuum and then a hydrogen atmosphere was introduced to the system. The flask was stirred at 750rpm with hydrogen flowing at 0.25Lmin−1 through the 1000mL round bottom flask and out the bubbler for 16h in a fume hood. Upon completion of the hydrogenation, the samples were filtered with a fritted funnel using Celite® 503 and rinsed 3 times (100mL, 50mL, 50mL) with methanol. The hydrogenated samples were rotary evaporated at 20°C for 1.5h to remove the methanol solvent. Proton NMR was carried out using an Agilent/Varian MR-400 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) with a narrow bore 9.4T/400MHz magnet equipped with OneNMR pulse-field-gradient probe. VNMRJ 3.0 was used for data acquisition with the MNova software (MestReNova, Escondido, CA) for data processing. Fourier transformed spectra were auto-phased and baseline corrected with dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) solvent referenced at 2.50ppm. Integration of the DMSO was normalized to 1.00. Subsequent integration of the various spectral regions (δ 10–8.0, 8.0–6.8, 6.4–4.2, 4.2–3.0, 2.2–1.6, and 1.6–0.0ppm) was performed. DMSO and residual methanol solvent peaks were subtracted from the integration set which allowed for the calculation of percent change in each region of interest. Sample size was 10mgsamplemL−1 DMSO solvent. Prior to adding the DMSO solvent the samples were dried with a small stream of nitrogen for 20min with all samples filtered with a 0.45μm filter. The sample size used for 1H NMR analyzes was 750μL. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the relative molecular weight distribution of the phenolic raffinates separated from the heavy ends of the bio-oil (fractions 1 and 2), as well as, stability characteristics after an accelerated aging study. Accelerated aging was accomplished at 80°C for 0, 8, 16, and 24h. The bio-oil samples (15mL) were placed in Nalgene bottles and firmly closed. The samples were pre-weighed prior to placing in an 80°C oven (Thermo Scientific® Hanover Park, IL). The bottles were re-tightened after 10min. Upon completion of the aging test each sample was cooled and weighed. If there was a weight loss the suspect sample was discarded and the aging test rerun. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system used was a Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a Shodex Refractive Index (RI) and Diode Array Detector (DAD). The software used to control the instrument and evaluate the samples was Dionex Chromeleon version 6.8. For the GPC analyzes, the eluent for the phenolics was tetrahydrofuran (THF) with two Agilent PLgel 3μm 100Å 300×7.5mm and one Mesopore 300×7.5mm. The column flow rate and temperature was 1.0mLmin−1 at 25°C. The phenolic samples were prepared using 10mL of THF and 0.02g of bio-oil fractions 1 and 2. All samples were filtered with a Whatman 0.45μm Glass Microfiber syringe filter before analysis. The GPC standards were purchased from Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Standards used for the bio-oil calibration curve ranged from 162 to 3790gmol−1. The polystyrene standards were diluted with JT Baker GPC grade Stabilized THF. The hydrogenated products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (7890B, Agilent Technologies, USA) mass spectroscopy (MS) (5977A, Agilent Technologies, USA) fitted with a 1701 capillary column 60m in length, 0.25mm inner diameter with a 0.25mm film thickness (Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA) to investigate the possibility of ester formation. The operating system was Agilent Masshunter Qualitative Analysis B.06.00 (Agilent Technologies, USA). The carrier gas was helium (99.9995%) with a constant flow rate of 1.0mLmin−1. The oven was programmed to be held for 3min at 50°C and ramped at 3°Cmin−1–280°C and held for 4min. A sample volume of 1μL was used with a split ratio of 20:1 and flow rate of 1mLmin−1. Identification of compounds was accomplished using NIST MS Library Version 2.0g. The mass range for the MS was 50 through 550. Chemical analyzes were performed on a 430 GC/FID (Bruker Corporation, Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Fremont, CA) fitted with a 1701 capillary column 60m in length, 0.25mm inner diameter with a 0.25mm film thickness (Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA). The operating system used was Galaxie Chromatography Data System version 1.9.302.530 (Bruker Corporation, Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Fremont, CA). The carrier gas was helium (99.9995%) with a constant flow rate of 1.0mLmin−1. The helium make-up was 25mLmin−1, hydrogen flow at 30mL with an air flow of 300mLmin−1. The oven was programmed to be held for 4min at 45°C and ramped at 3°Cmin−1–235°C and held for 10min for a total of 77.33min. A sample volume of 1μL was injected utilizing a Varian CP 8400 (Bruker Corporation, Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Fremont, CA) auto sampler with a split ratio of 1:45. Peak identification was based on calibration standards purchased from Fisher Scientific (Thermo Scientific® Hanover Park, IL). For each of the calibration standards, calibration lines were made by injecting a minimum of five standard solutions on the GC/FID run in triplicate. The concentration range was determined by injection of the standard solutions until a range was determined that comprised the quantified value [15]. Dynamic viscosity was accomplished using a Brookfield Viscometer model DV-II+pro rotational viscometer (Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Inc., Middleboro, MA) using SC4-15. The viscometer was calibrated using Brookfield viscosity standard 500 silicone (Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Inc., Middleboro, MA). A water bath was used with a temperature controller and held at 60.0±0.1°C. All sample viscosities were performed using the SC4-15 spindle at 15rpm except red oak fraction 2 phenolics. Its viscosity was determined at 5rpm because it was extremely viscous. Moisture content of the bio-oil was determined by a MKS 500 Karl Fischer Moisture Titrator (Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing Co., LTD, Kyoto, Japan) using ASTM E203 Standard Test Method for Water Using Karl Fischer Reagent. The reagent used was Hydranal Composite 5K and the solvent was Hydranal Working Medium K purchased from Thermo Scientific® (Hanover Park, IL). The percent moisture of the bio-oil samples was determined in a minimum of four trials. Ultimate analysis was conducted using an Elementar® elemental analyzer (vario MICRO cube). During the analysis, a sample was combusted at 900°C and the combustion products, carbon dioxide, water and nitric oxide, were characterized by a thermal conductivity detector. The weight percentages of the C, H, and N were calculated based on the amount of the combustion products. Approximately 5mg of sample was weighted and inserted into the combustion chamber for the analysis. A minimum of three trials was performed for each analysis [22]. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer used for all experiments was a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) equipped with a Smart iTR accessory. The spectrometer has the OMNIC Software operating system. Background was collected before every sample and attenuated total reflectance correction was used with 4 wavenumber resolution. Hydrogen consumption was calculated as the percentage increase in hydrogen content of the phenolic oil after LTLP hydrogenation as measured by ultimate analysis. Mass yield was calculated as the ratio of the mass of phenolic oils after LTLP hydrogenation to the mass of the raw phenolic oil. Carbon yield was calculated as the ratio of the mass of carbon in LTLP hydrogenated phenolic oil to the mass of carbon in the raw phenolic oil, as determined by ultimate analysis of the samples."
2,Results and discussion,"The LTLP hydrogenated samples became progressively lighter in color with time, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Color-producing chromophores in molecules are well known to arise from conjugated double bonds (CC) [23]; thus, the color change is visible evidence of hydrogenation of the phenolics. Other physical evidence of hydrogenation, an exothermic reaction, was an approximately 2.0°C increase in temperature of the samples above the starting temperature of the tests. After 16h of hydrogenation, there was no evidence of viscous polymeric materials in the samples after removal of the solvent. Low temperature low pressure hydrogenation resulted in high carbon yields: 98.2% and 98.5% for cornstover fractions 1 and 2, respectively, and 98.7% and 98.6% for red oak fractions 1 and 2, respectively (Table 1 ). These are significantly higher carbon yields of hydrotreated product compared to previous hydroprocessing of the water insoluble fraction of pyrolysis oil. Ben et al. [24] showed a 35% carbon yield hydrogenating at 300°C and 140bar for 4h in the first step of a two-step hydrogenation utilizing Ru/C catalyst. The second step (250°C, 140bar, for 2h) gave a carbon yield of 33%. In all cases, LTLP hydrogenation resulted in high mass yields: 94.5wt% and 86.1wt% for cornstover fractions 1 and 2, respectively, and 85wt% and 99.7wt% for red oak fractions 1 and 2, respectively. Elliot et al. [25] indicated a 0.78 oil yield (g/g dry feed) for hydrotreatment at 340°C and 138bar for cornstover heavy ends and 0.31 aqueous yield (g/g wet feed) using Pd/C catalyst. The carbon yields from cornstover fractions 1 and 2 were 0.077mol carbon/g dry basis (db) and 0.071mol carbon/g (db), respectively. The carbon yield from red oak fractions 1 and 2 showed slightly lower carbon yields of 0.065mol carbon/g (db). In comparison, Elliott et al. [25] using different hydrogenation parameters, obtained a carbon yield of 0.059mol carbon/g (db) when hydrotreating the heavy phase of cornstover bio-oil. Hydrogen consumption was 62.1L/L and 41.0L/L for cornstover fractions 1 and 2, respectively (Table 1). Hydrogen consumption for red oak fraction 2 was 241L/L. The differences in hydrogen consumption for the aged corn stover and fresh red oak bio-oils may arise in part from the relative ages of the two samples, with the cornstover having had more time to polymerize in storage, reducing its reactivity. However, Elliott et al. [25], using very different hydrogenation conditions, also observed large differences in hydrogen consumption for bio-oils from woody and herbaceous feedstocks: 76–128L/L for cornstover and 252L/L for poplar wood. The viscosities of phenolic samples (measured at 60°C) dropped dramatically upon hydrogenation, both for the aged cornstover oil and fresh red oak oil (Table 1). The viscosities for cornstover fractions 1 and 2 were 1598cP and 1375cP, respectively, before hydrogenation, dropping to 299cP and 729cP, respectively, after hydrogenation. Red oak fraction 2 showed a more dramatic drop in viscosity, decreasing from 4859cP before hydrogenation to a very fluid 57.7cP after hydrogenation (fraction 1 was not tested because of insufficient sample size). The greater drop in viscosity for the fresh oil sample again suggests that the aged sample lost reactive functional groups via polymerization during storage, limiting its ability to react with hydrogen during LTLP hydrogenation. This viscosity thinning after hydrogenation is in sharp contrast to the viscosity thickening observed by researchers who used higher temperatures and pressures to hydroprocess bio-oil. Viscosity reductions are usually associated with more severe hydrocracking, which reduces the molecular weight of heavy organic compounds. Cracking of phenolics clearly did not occur during LTLP hydrogenation. As shown in Table 1, the average relative molecular weight of hydrogenated cornstover fraction 1 actually increased 5.3% while the average relative molecular weights of hydrogenated cornstover fraction 2 and red oak fractions 1 and 2 only modestly decreased by 0.5%, 17%, and 4.9%, respectively. The reasons for viscosity thinning after LTLP hydrogenation are further explored below after presenting FTIR and NMR spectra for the samples. The samples, prior to and after hydrogenation, were subjected to an accelerated aging tests. The GPC results obtained for red oak fraction 1 are shown in Fig. 2 . These results clearly indicate increased stability with only slight changes evident. After stabilization, opportunities exist for further upgrading protocols at higher temperatures and pressures. Hydrogenation resulted in higher H/C molar ratios (Table 1). The increase in the H/C ratio is clear indication of hydrogenation [9]. Transportation fuels require the H/C ratio to be between 1.8 and 2.0 [6,9]. FTIR was used to evaluate changes in functional groups upon LTLP hydrogenation of cornstover phenolic samples with peak assignments based on wavenumber ranges from Lambert et al. [26] (see Fig. 3 ). The carbonyl stretches (1710–1690cm−1), benzene ring stretches (1650–1485cm−1), and ether stretches (1225–1070cm−1) decrease while the alcohol stretches (1065–1015cm−1) increase. Hydrogenation of the carbonyl groups and ether linkages would be expected to be accompanied by increases in alcohol groups, which was observed. The increase in alcohols for cornstover fraction 1 is notably much greater than for fraction 2. Recalling that LTLP hydrogenation decreased the viscosity of fraction 1 considerably more than for fraction 2 suggests that viscosity thinning is the result of the self-solvating power of the produced alcohol. Wei et al. [18] proposed a reaction pathway for hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls to alcohols at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature and noted that carbon support for the Pd catalyst strongly influences the conversion of carbonyls at these conditions. Semi-quantitative results utilizing 1H NMR (Fig. 4 ) were obtained by a normalized integration method suggested by Mullen et al. [27] and Ingram et al. [28]. Cornstover and red oak fractions 1 and 2 showed large increases in the aliphatic proton resonance (δ 1.6–0.0ppm), ranging from 25.5% to 350%. This indicated substantial hydrogenation of these samples even at the low temperature and pressure of this process. After LTLP hydrogenation, additional aliphatic proton resonance and aliphatic alcohol resonance in the region of δ 2.2–1.6ppm increased by 24.3–47.8%. Protons alpha to ketone, aldehyde, carboxyl and benzylic functional groups (δ 3.0–2.2ppm) decreased by 9.45% upon hydrogenation of cornstover fraction 1, whereas, they increased for all other samples by 13.8–133%. The decrease in proton resonance in cornstover fraction 1 might be the result of reductions in adjacent carbonyl moieties. In all cases hydrogenated phenolics show decreases of 29.9–45.5% in resonances associated with methoxyls, ethers, aliphatic alcohols, and methylene groups joining two aromatics (δ 4.2–3.0ppm). This decrease suggests bond cleavage during hydrogenation. Oasmaa et al. [29] report similar findings of decreasing methoxyl groups during hydrotreatment, although it is a little surprising for the mild conditions employed in the present study. The proton resonances corresponding to hydrogen on carbon atoms next to methoxyl groups, nonconjugated CC and phenolic alcohols (δ 6.4–4.2ppm) decreased for cornstover phenolics (73.3% and 51.5% for fractions 1 and 2, respectively) but increased for red oak phenolics (23.5% and 42.1% for fractions 1 and 2, respectively). A decrease in this proton resonance was expected as this corresponds to saturation of carbon bonds. The fact that it increased for the red oak samples might be explained by the production of phenolic alcohols, which is consistent with the previously presented FTIR data. The proton resonance corresponding to hydrogen on double bonds conjugated to carbonyls (δ 6.8–6.4ppm) [28] decreased by 21.1% for cornstover fraction 1. However, cornstover fraction 2, red oak fraction 1, and red oak fraction 2 showed increases of 3.03%, 97.9%, and 34.8%, respectively. Aromatic protons also occur in this region creating overlap with olefinic protons, ultimately, complicating analyzes [28]. Three of the four hydrogenated phenolic samples showed loss of aromaticity (δ 8.0–6.8ppm): 40.0% for cornstover fraction 1; 6.25% for cornstover fraction 2; and 52.9% for red oak fraction 2. The mild processing conditions employed were not expected to saturate or break aromatic rings, but the loss of aromaticity is confirmed by the FTIR data (benzene ring stretching). Aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and downfield aromatic proton resonance (δ 10.0–8.0ppm) decreased in hydrogenated red oak fraction 1 while they increased for both cornstover fraction 2 and red oak fraction 2. While a decrease was expected, the observed increase might be explained by loss of symmetry in the bio-oil compounds as a result of hydrogenation. The methanol used as solvent in these experiments might have interacted with the phenolic compounds to produce some of the changes observed, which were investigated. The mass balance indicated 96.5–97.7% of the methanol added as solvent was recovered after hydrogenation. The 2.3–3.5wt% unaccounted methanol may have been retained within the phenolic sample as liquid methanol, reacted with carboxylic acids in the sample to produce esters, or served as a hydrogen donors during the hydrogenation process, which were all investigated. As determined by GC/FID, the hydrogenated cornstover samples contained from 0.12 to 1.0wt% methanol, whereas, SF 1 and SF 2 red oak hydrogenated samples contained 0.09–0.97wt% methanol. This is considerable less than the additions of alcohols usually recommended to stabilize bio-oil which range from 5 to 10wt% in whole bio-oil [30,31]. Another possibility investigated was that methanol reacted with carboxylic functionality in the phenolic samples to produce esters. This has been proposed as the mechanism by which alcohol addition stabilizes bio-oil [30]. GC/MS analysis found no evidence of esters in the samples. As a further confirmation that methanol was not esterifying carboxylic functionality in the phenolics, we replaced methanol with 1,4-dioxane to serve as solvent and repeated hydrogenation trials. 1H NMR and FTIR analyzes of the hydrogenated products prepared in the presence of these two solvents showed no discernible differences, which indicates esterification was not occurring. One final possibility was that methanol rather than gaseous hydrogen was responsible for hydrogenating the samples. In fact, the unrecovered methanol solvent can only account for 0.2–0.3% of the increase in hydrogen found in the samples. Furthermore, repeating the hydrogenation experiments with methanol as solvent but replacing the hydrogen gas with molecular nitrogen essentially eliminated hydrogenation of the phenolic compounds. These tests eliminate the possibility that the methanol solvent was responsible for the changes observed in the phenolic samples after hydrogenation. Accordingly, the stabilization of the phenolic fraction of bio-oil was the result of the reaction of gaseous hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature in the presence of a Pd/C catalyst. A control hydrogenation test was performed in the absence of Pd/C catalyst. Without the catalyst, the aliphatic region of the NMR (0–2.2ppm) increased by only 14.5%. However, in the presence of catalyst, the total area increased by 154%, indicating the important role of the Pd/C catalyst in promoting hydrogenation of the bio-oil. The small increase in the aliphatic region in the absence of added catalyst could have been catalyzed by trace metals in the bio-oil [32]. Our starting material was not filtered and may have contained a small amount of alkali- and alkaline earth-rich char [17]."
3,Conclusions,"Low-temperature, low-pressure (LTLP) hydrogenation of the phenolic fraction of bio-oil converted carbonyl groups to alcohols and saturated vinyl groups to aliphatic groups, dramatically reducing the viscosity of the samples. This result is in contrast with more conventional “mild hydroprocessing,” which saturates bio-oil compounds, resulting in classical viscosity thickening. Results of these experiments support our hypothesis that the high reactivity of bio-oil compared to petroleum requires an initial upgrading step at much milder conditions than conventionally employed."
