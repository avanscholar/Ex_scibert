0,Introduction,"Photocatalysis is a promising strategy providing green and renewable source of energies. Photocatalysis of endergonic reactions, such as artificial photosynthesis, would store solar energy, an abundant but intermittent source of energy, in the form of chemical energy (i.e. solar fuels) [1,2]. Photocatalytic production of H2, a promising vector of energy, could allow renewable process using water and/or bio-based alcohols as a feedstock. Jaramillo and coll., calculated that a single bed particle suspension can reach a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 11.2 % and produce one kg of H2 for $1.60 [3]. However, such efficiency was never reached. Addition of a co-catalyst to a light absorbing semiconductor enhance the charge carriers separation and their utilization [4]. The resulting rate for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) is therefore increased. Several noble metal co-catalysts were reported in the literature (with Pt, the most studied) [5–12] as well as oxides [13–15] or transition metal sulfides co-catalysts [16–24]. However, no photocatalytic system is efficient enough to produce sustainable H2 at a reasonable cost. Intense current research efforts are directed to the design of efficient co-catalysts. Numerous current empirical studies focus on novel co-catalysts without providing mechanistic insights. An important issue is to compare photocatalytic efficiency measured in different laboratories. Indeed the conditions of the experiments strongly varied and many parameters influence the PHER rate. It depends, for instance on the incident flux of photons, the mass of photocatalyst or the reactive mixture [25–28]. Without identifying and quantifying those parameters, it is impossible to provide accurate comparison from one photocatalyst to another. Herein to conduct such a detailed study, we use the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of the isopropanol as a model reaction and the titania-supported ruthenium disulfide as a model photocatalyst. The photocatalytic dehydrogenation of the isopropanol is proposed as a model reaction. It mimics the production of clean and renewable H2 with raw biomass, the targeted feedstock. Promising work has been done on carbohydrates [29], on polysaccharides [30], on crude glycerol [31] and more recently on unprocessed biomass by Reisner and co-workers (for instance, grass, rice or seaweeds) [32–34]. However, for more fundamental studies, mono-alcohol systems are preferred. The PHER rate and the observed rankings of co-catalysts performance strongly depend on the nature of the alcohol [5,6,8,17,35]. We proposed the photocatalytic conversion of a water-isopropanol mixture for its simplicity, as it proceeds via a single dehydrogenation pathway. Titania-supported ruthenium disulfide (RuS2/TiO2) is proposed as a model photocatalyst. Since the discovery of its photocatalytic activity [2,36], TiO2 is by far the most studied photocatalyst [4,37]. By contrast, RuS2 is not the most studied transition metal sulfide co-catalyst. More attention has been recently paid to MoS2 [20,21,38–40], to NiSx [23,41,42] or to cheaper materials such as CuS [24,43]. However, we recently evidenced that among a series of seven transition metal sulfides deposited on TiO2, RuS2 was one of the most efficient PHER co-catalyst [17]. RuS2 is a well-known hydrodesulfurization catalyst [44–47]. It has also been reported for photoelectrocatalytic applications [48–51] and a few times for PHER. RuS2 has been reported as a co-catalyst of TiO2 [22], TiO2-SiO2 [52] and CdxZn1-xS [53] but also as a photocatalyst itself. RuS2 particles were reported on SiO2 or on thiol-modified polystyrene particles [22,54,55]. In the S.I., the activities of these RuS2-based photocatalysts are reported (See Table S1). However, the diversity of the reactive mixture in which the materials are studied forbids an accurate comparison. This work aims to evaluate the influence of seven of the crucial reaction parameters that influence the PHER rate: the temperature, the concentration of isopropanol, the mass of photocatalyst, the nature of the TiO2 support, the RuS2 loading, the energy and the flux of the incident photons. The influence of some of those parameters on the PHER rate were already quantified. However, to provide better insight into the mechanism we study not only PHER rates but also, two kinetic parameters derived from the Arrhenius law: an apparent activation energy ( E a , a p p ) and a pre-exponential factor ( A a p p )."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation The RuS2-based photocatalysts were prepared with the thioacetamide reflux method. Details on the synthesis and on the characterization were reported previously [17,38]. Typically, 2.0 g of commercial TiO2 (CristalACTIV™ PC500) (referred latter as PC500) and 900 mg of thioacetamide (Alfa Aesar) were suspended in 100 ml of deionized water. Suspension was refluxed under stirring prior to introduce the precursor salt: RuCl3.xH2O (Sigma Aldrich). The amount of precursor varied to obtain several co-catalyst loadings. The solid materials were isolated by centrifugation, washed and dried under N2. Bulk RuS2 sample were prepared in the same conditions, for characterization. A second preparation method consisted in mechanically mixing the bulk RuS2 with five titania supports: PC500 (anatase), a homemade rutile [56], a homemade brookite [57] and two commercial mixed phase titania from Evonik Aeroxide®: P25 (80/20 wt%, anatase / rutile) and Aeroxide® P90 (92/8 wt%, anatase / rutile), referred latter as P90 and P25."
3,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of the catalysts Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out in a quartz reactor from room temperature to 1050 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1. The samples (50–100 mg) were heated under H2 flow (50 mL min−1). A Thermo Prolab quadrupole mass-spectrometer detected the H2S produced. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 diffractometer equipped with a Ni filter (with CuKα , radiation 0.154184 nm) and a 1-dimensional multistrip detector (Lynxeye, 192 channels on 2.95°). Diffractogram were analyzed with Diffrac.Eva software using standard JCPDS files for phase identification. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JEOL 2010 LaB6 device with an accelerating voltage 200 keV. Its point to point resolution is 0.19 nm. The apparatus is equipped with an Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyzer (Link ISIS – Oxford Instrument). The annular-dark-field STEM experiments (ADF-STEM) were performed with a FEI Titan ETEM G2 electron microscope equipped with a Cs image aberration corrector and operated at 300 keV. The extraction voltage, camera length, acceptance angles, STEM resolution and probe current were 4500 V, 245 mm, 29.2–146°, 0.14 nm and < 0.1 nA, respectively. For sample preparation, the powder was sonicated in ethanol and dropped onto a TEM grid. To protect them from air oxidation, samples were immediately introduced into the TEM vacuum chamber. The metal content in the synthesized solids was determined, after dissolution in an acid mixture, by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES Activa Jobin Yvon). For Ru-based materials a dissolution in H2SO4, HNO3 and HF under 150 °C during one night was employed. Elemental analysis of light elements (CHNS) was also performed on an analyzer Thermo Fisher Flash 2000. Textural properties were studied by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. BET surface areas (SBET) were determined using a multipoint BET method. The measurements were carried out using N2 adsorption-desorption at −196 °C in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 device. Before SBET analysis, the catalyst samples were degassed at 250 °C under vacuum (10−6bar) for 3 h. To prepare the electrodes, 20 mg of photocatalytic nanopowders were dispersed by ultrasound in 800 μl of ethanol. The resulting suspension was drop-casted on a FTO glass substrate (7 Ω cm−2, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). The electrodes were characterized through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A three-electrode electrochemical cell was used with Pt wire as counter electrode and an SCE (3 M KCl) as reference electrode. The electrolyte is a 0.1 M KClO4 solution with a pH 8. The impedance spectra were recorded on a VMP300, Biologic potentiostat with the Software EC-Lab, between 100 mHz and 200 kHz with 12 points per decade, 2 measures per frequency and an amplitude of 100 μA. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were conducted in an integrated ultrahigh vacuum system: Axis Ultra DLD system Kratos Analytical. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). XPS spectra were acquired at 160 eV and 40 eV of pass energy for low and high resolution respectively. The wide spectrum (from 1200 to -5 eV) was recorded in order to identify all chemical species on the surface. High resolution core-level spectra were recorded at dwell time of 200 ms and a step of 0.1 eV. Number of scans varies to limit the signal-to-noise ratio. The photon source power was fixed at 15 mA and 15 kV. Data were analyzed with CasaXPS software. The binding energy (BE) of all electronic states were referenced to the C 1s main state at 284.5 eV; this energy position was assigned to CC or CH bonds. A Shirley background was then subtracted to the spectra. Core level such as, C 1s, O 1s or S 2p were decomposed into a combination of Voigt functions. For specific core levels such as Ru 3d, an asymmetric line shape was used: a product of a Doniach Sunjich with a Gaussian/Lorentzian function."
4,UPS and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy,"2.3 UPS and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis is widely used for electronic structure characterisation, ultraviolet light increase the detection sensitivity concomitant with the high photoionization cross-sections in the valence band region [58]. We have developed a methodology to study nanopowders by UPS [59,60]. UPS spectra were acquired using a He I ( h ν = 21.2 eV) resonant line. High resolution UPS spectrum was obtained by using a spatial lens aperture of 110 μm and 10 eV of pass energy. Under these conditions, the intrinsic resolution of the spectra was estimated about 0.2 eV with the method reported by Schlaf et al. [61] and Reinert et al. [58] (See Fig. S1). In contrast, XPS analysis is less sensitive to valence band analysis. However, this type of XPS measurements can provide a general information about the electronic structure of the system, despite its low resolution (around 0.5 eV, see Fig. S1 for determination). Powder samples were ultrasonically dispersed in pentane, and, deposited on a conducting substrate by a drop-casting method. Drop-casting was made on ITO substrate for valence band (VB) states identification (i.e. experimental density of states (DOS)) and on an Ag foil for absolute band diagram determination. UPS spectra were subtracted with a Henrich – type background [62]. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) was measured at room temperature with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 45 spectrometer. It is equipped with an integrating sphere (RSA-PE-20). Pure BaSO4 (Alfa Aesar, 99 %) was used as a reference and to dilute the powders. Kubelka-Munk function ( F K M ) was applied to represent absorbance. It is valid for the values of reflectance R ∞ > 0.6 and therefore several dilution in BaSO4 were performed [63]. The band-gap ( E g ) values were estimated from the plot of F K M h ν 1 / n versus energy, so-called Tauc plot [64]."
5,Photocatalytic tests,"2.4 Photocatalytic tests The photocatalytic set-up is depicted on Fig. S2. Photocatalytic reaction was conducted in liquid phase, in a double-wall semi-batch slurry reactor with 600 rpm stirring. The reactor is made of pyrex, its dimensions are provided in Fig. S2. The reactor was filled with the RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst slurry in 50 ml of an aqueous solution of isopropanol (Carlo Erba, 99.9 %). It is then sonicated during 10 min to obtain a homogeneous slurry. Note that isopropanol is put in large excess, the conversion is therefore always below 2 %. The experimental conditions are summarized in Table S2. Before irradiation, the system was purged with Ar flow (100 mL/min) for 30 min. The Ar flow was then decreased to 20 mL/min. After checking that the system reached a steady state and that no product is formed under dark conditions, the light was switched on. Gases were analyzed with a micro gas chromatograph (μ-GC) equipped with four columns (Molecular Sieve 5 Å, PPU, Alumina and Wax) and thermal conductivity detectors (Agilent Technologies, 300 A). The rate of hydrogen production ( r H 2 ) was measured after waiting 2 h that the system reached a steady. The r H 2 was calculated from the average concentration of H2 measured over 1 h. The reactor has an optical window of 20 cm2 area. Three lamps were used to illuminate it. The first is a polychromatic 125 W high-pressure mercury lamp (HPK). The second is a monochromatic 370 nm LED (LZ1 BIN N from Engine). Both emit line spectra. The intensity of the LED lamp can be tuned applying different electrical power. The third lamp is a 300 W Xe lamp (MAX-302, Asahi Spectra), which emits continuous spectrum, its intensity and the wavelength range can be tuned using filters. Their respective irradiance spectra were acquired with a radiometer device and are shown in Fig. S3 and S4. The glassware of the photoreactor filters the wavelength below 290 nm and the band gap of the TiO2-PC500 is 3.15 eV [59]; wavelength above 390 nm cannot be absorbed. Therefore, we calculated the incident flux of photons that can be absorbed (290–390 nm range): Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e (the total incident flux of photons is also provided in the SI). The photon yield (PY) was calculated as r H 2 divided by this Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e [65]. Note that in the case of polychromatic irradiation (HPK), PY should be called “photonic efficiency”, in agreement with the IUPAC nomenclature [25,65]. However, for the sake of simplicity, only PY is used herein. The error on the PY was estimated to be close to 10 %. A cryostat (Julabo Cryostat F32-ME) supplied water recirculation in the double-wall of the reactor to adjust its temperature between 10 and 45 °C. If the opposite is not clearly indicates, the reported r H 2 and PY are measured at 20 °C."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst XRD pattern of the RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst evidences only the TiO2 anatase phase (See Fig. S5). It is due to the amorphous structure of RuSx obtained with the thioacetamide reflux method. It confirms that the support does not have any effect on the crystallization of the RuSx co-catalyst. XPS measurement was performed to identify the RuSx state (See Fig. S6). Because the Ru 3p signal overlaps with the Ti 2p one and because the Ru 3d 3/2 signal overlaps with the C 1s, it requires a meticulous fit of the XPS spectra. More details on the methodology were provided in [17]. Core level states at 279.9 (Ru 3d – C 1s) and 161.9 eV (S 2p) correspond to the pyrite state (SS)2− [66]. XPS spectra also show that the RuSx phase is not pure, the small contribution at 166−171 eV can be assigned to sulfate groups [67] and the state at BE =281.0 eV corresponds to a more oxidized RuSxOy state. Indeed, no particular cautions were used to avoid air contact prior to the PHER tests or to insertion in the XPS analysis chamber. XPS analyses were also performed on RuS2/TiO2 after being tested for PHER for 20 h (See Fig. S7). It evidences that RuS2 particles are partially oxidized after test. This might be due to the consumption of holes by the RuS2 instead of isopropanol oxidation. According to the electronic structure that will be discussed at the end, the transfer of holes from TiO2 to RuS2 is favorable. Using STEM analyses, the high mass of Ru relatively to Ti permits easy detection of RuS2 particles at the surface of TiO2 (See Fig. S8). The size of the particles was therefore estimated between 1 nm and 1.5 nm. As a complementary technic to access RuS2 particle size, we used TPR measurements. Several type of sulfur species have been evidenced on the TPR curve of the RuS2/TiO2 prepared with the thioacetamide reflux method (See Fig. S9). Three types of sulfur were discriminated: the one from thioacetamide impurities ( S t h i o . ), the one from the sulfur at the surface ( S s u r f . ), and in the bulk ( S b u l k ). A geometrical model discussed in [68] correlates the ratio S s u r f . S s u r f . + S b u l k with the size of particles having a pyrite structure. It estimates an average size of 1.3 ± 0.2 nm for the RuS2 particles, supported on TiO2, in agreement with STEM results. Therefore, the thioacetamide reflux method leads to amorphous RuS2 particles of 1.3 nm supported on TiO2."
8,Co-catalytic effect of RuS2 on TiO2,"3.2 Co-catalytic effect of RuS2 on TiO2 RuS2/TiO2 photocatalysts were then tested for the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of the isopropanol. Three products were detected by μ-GC: acetone, H2 and propene. The two first products result of a dehydrogenation pathway and the last results of the dehydration of isopropanol: C H 3 C H O H C H 3 → C H 3 C O C H 3 + H 2 C H 3 C H O H C H 3 → C H 2 = C H C H 3 + H 2 O As the rate of hydrogen production is 97 times higher than that of propene production, the dehydration pathway is neglected. No CO2 was detected, it indicates that the total reforming of the isopropanol or its total oxidation does not occur. The absence of O2 in the reactor prevent the total oxidation. The suitable water:isopropanol stoichiometry prevent the total reforming. A mechanistic and a kinetic study for the dehydrogenation of isopropanol are beyond the scope of this work and will be discussed elsewhere. The PHER rates were measured at 10, 20, 35 and 45 °C for RuS2/TiO2 and for bare TiO2. At each temperature, the RuS2/TiO2 was significantly more active than TiO2. Fig. 1 depicts the evolution of H2 concentration along the time. The resulting PHER rate and the PY both follow an Arrhenius law. It therefore provides two additional kinetic parameters, a pre-exponential factor ( A a p p ) and an apparent activation energy ( E a , a p p ): (1) P Y = r H 2 e x p Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e × 100 P Y = A a p p , r H 2 Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e e - E a , a p p R T = A a p p , P Y . e - E a , a p p R T The error on the E a , a p p was estimated lower than 1.0 kJ/mol by reproducing the experiment three times for some of the catalysts reported in this work. First, the E a , a p p values were compared for bare PC500 at 30.5 kJ/mol and for RuS2/PC500 at 19.5 kJ/mol. Deposition of RuS2 on the TiO2 surface lowers the apparent activation energy of PHER. It evidences the co-catalytic effect of RuS2 for two commercial TiO2 supports (PC500 and P25) (See Fig. S10). The unsupported RuS2 do not produce H2 in similar experimental conditions. Therefore, the enhancement factor (i.e. r H 2 ( R u S 2 / T i O 2 ) r H 2 ( T i O 2 ) ) and the synergetic factor (i.e. r H 2 ( R u S 2 / T i O 2 ) r H 2 T i O 2 + r H 2 R u S 2 ) are equal. The measured enhancement factors are 4.1 and 25.9 for P25 and PC500 supports, respectively. Activation energies are often measured in thermal heterogeneous catalysis but they are rarely reported in photocatalysis. The few values reported in the literature are lower than those related to thermal catalysis and are between 5 and 30 kJ/mol [35,69–72]. For instance Ait-Ichou et al. measured an activation energy of 72.4 kJ/mol with Pt/TiO2 for the dehydrogenation of isopropanol in the dark and of 9.2 kJ/mol under irradiation [69]. In addition, Turek and Krowiak measured the activation energy for the dehydrogenation of the isopropanol with various metal oxides [73]. Values are between 50 kJ/mol and 130 kJ/mol. Therefore, it indicates that the presence of light and of a semiconducting material decrease of one order of magnitude the activation energy of the isopropanol dehydrogenation. Because the PHER occurs near to ambient while for thermal catalysis it starts at 70 °C [69,73], the sensitivity of the PHER rate to E a , a p p is high for photocatalysis. Small variations of the E a , a p p value significantly influences the PY. The presence of RuS2 co-catalyst at the surface of the PC500 surface decreases the E a , a p p by a factor 1.5 but the exponential term, at 20 °C, increases by a factor 50 (See Fig. S11). Activation energy measurements were performed for the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols with Pt/TiO2 [35,69,71] or noble-metal-free TiO2 [70,72]. Because all the reported E a , a p p values are generally low, literature works assumed that adsorption, desorption or migration phenomena are the rate-determining steps. Here, for the first time, E a , a p p is measured for a transition metal sulfide – based catalyst: RuS2/TiO2. To understand the physical nature of the rate-determining step, we studied the influence of six parameters on the E a , a p p . It was measured with the same procedure than the one illustrated by Fig. 1 (PY is measured during the steady state reach for each of the four temperatures). The measurement of E a , a p p and A a p p provides two additional kinetic parameters. With the PY or the PHER rate, they were used to study the photocatalytic behavior of RuS2/TiO2 and to provide mechanistic insights."
9,Optimal experimental conditions,"3.3 Optimal experimental conditions Prior to study the influence of the targeted parameters, the optimal experimental conditions were established. The influence of the concentration of alcohol in the reactive mixture, of the photocatalyst mass and of the incident flux of photons were measured on the PHER rate (or PY). It was already analyzed in the literature, for instance by Herrmann [11], but it the first time that the influence of these parameters on the E a , a p p and A a p p was investigated. Between 1.3 mol/L and 13 mol/L of isopropanol, the PHER rate as well as the E a , a p p does not does not vary significantly (See Fig. S12). The apparent kinetic order of isopropanol is consider as 0: r H 2 = k . [ i s o p r o p n a o l ] 0 . We therefore assumed that above 1.3 mol/L the oxidation half-reaction does not limit the overall PHER process. The photocatalytic tests were further conducted in the same 1:1 %vol. mixture of isopropanol and water. The PHER rate linearly increases with the mass of photocatalyst, until to reach a plateau (See Fig. S13). It is a common phenomenon already reported in the literature [11,21,25,74,75]. It is due to the Lambert-Bouger law governing the light absorption of a photocatalyst. Therefore, we proposed to model these data with the following expression: (2) r H 2 = r H 2 , m a x . ( 1 - e - α . m ) r H 2 , m a x is the PHER at the plateau, α ( λ ) (g−1) is the absorption coefficient of the photocatalyst and m is its mass. This model works for PC500, P25 and P90 – based photocatalyst (See Fig. S14). Notice that the threshold between the linear and the plateau region of r H 2 vs mass of the photocatalyst varies as the function of the titania support. Therefore, it seems mandatory to plot a r H 2 = f ( m a s s p h o t o c a t a l y s t ) curve forreporting the optimal PHER rate of a given photocatalyst. When the mass of photocatalyst is increased, E a , a p p slightly decreased until it reached a plateau. Below 40 mg, the limiting irradiated surface area prevents an optimal photon absorption. The limiting amount of charge carriers governs the overall PHER rate. Therefore, the following photocatalytic tests were conducted with at least 40 mg of photocatalyst (See Table S2). When the mass of photocatalyst increased, A a p p , P Y also decreased until it reached a plateau. We assumed that A a p p , r H 2 depends on the density of photons available per irradiated surface ( ρ p h o t o n s ): (3) A a p p , r H 2 ∝ ρ p h o t o n s = Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e S i r r a d . With S i r r a d . , the surface of the irradiated particles. At a given flux of incident photons, the higher the mass of photocatalyst is, the higher the surface of irradiated particles is, the lower the ρ p h o t o n s is. The TiO2 has therefore a lower probability to absorb a photon. The A a p p , P Y therefore decreases until to reach a plateau for which the additional photocatalyst mass is not irradiated. Finally, the influence of the incident flux of photons ( Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e ) was studied. Fig. 2 evidences two regimes. At low intensity, the PHER rate evolves linearly with the flux Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e : the higher the amount of photons is, the higher the amount of free charge carriers is and therefore, the higher the amount of H2 produced is. At higher intensities, it is no longer the case. The threshold between the two trends is estimated at 2800 ± 200 μEinstein/h (μE/h). We performed irradiance measurement at different spot of the photoreactor (See Fig. S15 for additional details). It confirms that the second regime is not due to photons that are transfered or diffused outside of the photoreactor. It confirms experimentally the existence of two regimes on a r H 2 = f Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e curve that Hermann theorized in [11]. At high intensity, he explained that the charge carrier recombination is predominant. The TiO2 surface absorbs too many photons, photogenerated charge carriers are not transfered fast enough to the co-catalyst and most of them recombine. He proposed an evolution of the PHER rate, as follows: (4) r H 2 = a . Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e 0,5 With a , being a constant. The curve in Fig. 2 can be fitted with such expression at high intensity (See Fig. S16). This relationship has been already proven experimentally with TiO2-P25 for the photocatalytic degradation of sulfonylurea herbicides [76] and CdS for the PHER [77]. However, the threshold was reached at different intensities. It shows that this behavior depends on various parameters related to the photocatalytic support, the nature of the co-catalyst and the geometry of the reactor. As the PHER rate linearly evolves with the lamp intensity, it seems more instructive to report PY. For that purpose, providing the references of the lamp or its power is not enough, its actual intensity depends on the lamp age and on the brand. Therefore, the incident flux of photons must be reported. However, calculating a PY at high intensity underestimates the efficiency of a photocatalyst. Reporting a r H 2 = f ( Φ p h o t o n s - a b s o r b a b l e ) curve is therefore recommended for any novel photocatalytic set-up and/or material [75]. For our photocatalytic set-up, the optimal experimental conditions were established: a 1:1 %vol. mixture of isopropanol and water for not being limited by the oxidation half-reaction, a mass of photocatalyst higher than 40 mg for not being limited by the photon absorption and a well-known and well-controlled incident flux of photons for an accurate comparison of the catalyst. The targeted parameters (the nature of the support, the co-catalyst loading and the energy of the incident photons) can therefore be studied."
10,Influence of the titania support,"3.4 Influence of the titania support In our previous work [17], seven transition metal sulfides were compared as co-catalysts on the same titania support (PC500). RuS2 appeared to be one of the best co-catalysts in the series. Therefore, we wanted to compare several semiconducting supports with the same co-catalyst. Here, the same RuS2 co-catalyst was deposited on five titania materials. Fig. 3 shows the PHER activity of the resulting photocatalysts. Among the titania samples, three are pure phases (commercial PC500 anatase, homemade rutile [56] and homemade brookite [57]) and two are mixtures of anatase and rutile phases (P90 and P25). RuS2 was first synthesized with the thioacetamide reflux method and then mechanically mixed with TiO2. It allows avoiding the differences of RuS2 properties that would probably appear, if it were chemically grown on different titania materials. Mechanical mixing guarantees uniformity of RuS2 properties and allows focusing on the differences between TiO2 samples. The amorphous structure of the bulk RuSx evidenced with XRD (See Fig. S5) confirm that the RuS2 particles have sizes of a few nanometers, as the one obtained with the thioacetamide reflux method. A comparison with the standard thioacetamide reflux method shows that this preparation method does not significantly influence the photocatalytic activity (See Fig. S17). One explanation could be that the sonication used before each photocatalytic test to homogenize the slurry (See Section 2.4) has a benefic effect on the slurry. A second one would be that the direction formation of the RuS2 particles at the surface of the TiO2, with the thioacetamide reflux method, does not provide a better intimacy than the mechanical mixture of pre-synthesized RuS2 and TiO2. Another explanation would be that RuS2 particles might not need to be in a close contact with the titania surface during the all photocatalytic process. Afanasiev, recently evidenced that TiO2 particles can accumulate long-live photogenerated charge carriers until a contact with a co-catalyst particle occurs. Active catalysts could be obtained without close intimacy [78]. The PHER rates vary as a function of the titania sample. In average, the mixed phases are more active than the pure phases. For the latter, the ranking is: brookite < rutile < anatase. Several parameters can influence the PHER rates vs. the nature of titania samples [4,79]. First, they have various surface areas that influence the amount of adsorption sites. The amount of photons absorbed depends on the surface surface of the irradiated particle and also on the band gap of the semiconductors. The morphology of photocatalytic powders (agglomeration, shape of crystallites) also has an influence, as well as their crystallinity. Finally, the position of the valence band defines the potential of the photogenerated holes and therefore its capacity to oxidize isopropanol. The E a , a p p values vary as a function of the titania material. It suggests that the rate-determining step does not involve processes occurring merely on the RuS2 co-catalyst. Low E a , a p p values observed in the literature, led the authors to conclude that desorption of H2 or H+ migration should be the rate-determining step [70,72]. The results presented in Fig. 3 go against such hypotheses because H+ species are reduced and H2 is formed on the same RuS2 co-catalyst, used in all five compositions. On the other hand, for the previously studied series of MSx supported on the same TiO2 [17] (and many literature works dealing with the PHER co-catalysts design), a strong dependence of PHER rate on the nature of co-catalyst evidences that the photocatalytic H2 production cannot be defined by the intrinsic properties of the TiO2 itself. Therefore, the rate-determining step probably involves both the RuS2 and the TiO2. We believe that such a rate-determining step is either the electron transfer from the TiO2 to the RuS2 or the charge carrier separation, occurring on the TiO2 but enhanced with the presence of a co-catalyst. In both cases, the amount of TiO2-RuS2 interface must influence the PHER activity of the resulting heterostructure. To explore this hypothesis, the co-catalyst loading was varied and its influence on the kinetic parameters was measured."
11,Influence of the RuS2 loading,"3.5 Influence of the RuS2 loading Fig. 4 reports the PHER rate as a function of RuS2 loading. It has maximal values in the range of 0.5−1 wt%. At low co-catalyst loadings, the activity increases until the amount of co-catalyst becomes sufficient. For the high loadings, the PHER rate decreased above 1% wt. (See Fig. 4, left). In the region of optimal mass loadings of RuS2, the PHER rate has a plateau or a smooth maximum. The highest PY of 3.1 % is obtained for 0.84 wt% loading. It can be noted that the optimization of the co-catalyst loading improved the PY by a factor 1.6 (from 1.9 % to 3.1 %), in comparison to our previous work [17] (See Table S1). In the S.I. the activity of MSx-based photocatalysts are reported: their yield, as well as their enhancement factors (i.e. the ratio of the rates of hydrogen production with and without the co-catalyst). The diversity of the reactive mixture prevents a comparison with the RuS2-based photocatalysts. However, comparison with other co-catalysts from the literature shows a reasonably high activity (See Table S1). The RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst has a higher enhancement factor than CuS [24,43] and NiS – based catalyst [41,42]. It is even competitive with MoS2 – based materials [38,39]. The highest yield and the highest enhancement factor are however measured with amorphous MoSX co-catalyst [21,40]. From bare titania to highly loaded RuS2/TiO2 the activation energy progressively decreased approximately twice, from ca. 30 to ca. 15 KJ/mol (Fig. 4, inset). It suggests that the rate-determining step is gradually favored with the increase of the co-catalyst loading. To explore one hypothesis, we performed EIS experiments on the RuS2-based photocatalysts (See Fig. S18). In dark conditions, it shows a progressive increase of the conductivity with the increase of the co-catalyst loading. It might be due to an enhanced electron transfer between the TiO2 and the RuS2 The decrease of the E a , a p p with an increase of the co-catalyst loading is however compensated by also a decrease of the pre-exponential part in the PHER rate expression (See Fig. 4, right). This compensation leads to the appearance of the PY optimum On bare TiO2 or at low RuS2 loading, hydrogen is released on many sites corresponding to the high TiO2 surface but with relatively high activation energy (probably that of hydrogen atoms recombination). When more RuS2 is added, H2 is predominantly formed on fewer sites located on the sulfide and with low activation energy that corresponds to a process involving the co-catalyst (which cannot be identified exactly and might correspond to the charge carriers behavior, as discussed previously). The decrease of PHER rate at high co-catalyst loading might be explained by different causes, from light absorption by the (black) co-catalyst to the agglomeration of co-catalyst particles and decrease of their efficiency. Such behavior of PHER rate vs. the co-catalyst loading is well known in the literature for different systems, but not fully understood [23,41,53,80]. We observe that the increase of the co-catalyst loading does not significantly modify the morphology of the RuS2 particles. Their size always remains within the range 1–1.5 nm (See Fig. S8). Therefore, deterioration of the co-catalyst properties seems less probable. Otherwise the negative effect of high loadings is often explained in the literature by shielding effect of the co-catalyst [10,53,80–82]. Without dismissing the data of these works, we exclude this hypothesis in our case. Indeed, bare PC500 has a BET surface area of 276 m2/g, the loading of 1.5 wt% Ru decreases the BET surface area to 269 m2/g. It corresponds to approximately one RuS2 particle of 1.2 nm size per 20 nm2 of titania, which can hardly be considered as shielding. The decrease of PHER activity in methanol on Pt and Pd -loaded TiO2 was previously attributed to the overlapping of surface zones where the particles provide optimal electrons harvesting. As far as such zones begin to overlap, the conditions deteriorate in the overlapping areas, as the electronic properties of TiO2 are somehow unfavorably modified [83]. To explain decrease of PHER rate at relatively low co-catalyst loadings, we suppose that the PHER rate might be limited by the relatively high recombination rate of electron–hole pairs. Previously, the possibility has been demonstrated for electrons and holes to be recombined on the same co-catalyst sink [84,85]. Simulation of rate processes is beyond the scope of this work, but the effects might be explained in qualitative terms. If the co-catalyst is efficient not only for electrons harvesting but also for the electron-hole pairs recombination, then at too high concentration of RuS2 sites on the surface, electrons and holes might mostly recombine on the sulfide before being used for the reaction. To confirm such hypothesis and to discuss the electron transfers between the TiO2 and the RuS2, the electronic structure of the heterostructure was determined."
12,Electron transfer and influence of the incident photons energy,"3.6 Electron transfer and influence of the incident photons energy The methodology proposed in [59], combining UPS and UV–vis DRS describes the electronic structure of RuS2/TiO2. First, UPS measurements were performed on bare TiO2 (PC500), bulk RuS2 and RuS2/TiO2. The sample prepared on an ITO substrate gives VB states identification and a sample prepared on an Ag foil gives the absolute position of the EVB. Dropping a low quantity of diluted slurry on Ag allows obtaining an UPS spectrum with the contributions of both the sample powder and the Ag foil (See Figs. S19 and S20). The Fermi step of the Ag is used as an internal standard calibration for the spectra. The EVB are therefore positioned on an absolute scale at: -7.1 eV for TiO2 (PC500) [59] and -4.8 eV for both bulk RuS2 and RuS2/TiO2 (See Fig. 5 ). The EVB of bulk and supported RuS2 are the same. It means that when the EF of TiO2 and RuS2 are aligned, the EVB of RuS2 is not modified. It concludes that EF of TiO2 and of RuS2 are close. After an appropriate background subtraction, it is possible to curve fit the experimental DOS of RuS2/TiO2. It was represented as a superposition of Voigt functions corresponding to individual states. The same states as for bare TiO2 are needed for fitting RuS2/TiO2, as well as one additional component, assigned to a RuS2 state. To confirm such hypothesis, UPS spectrum of a more concentrated sample (6.2 wt% Ru) was acquired. Indeed, the higher the RuS2 loading is, the more intense this state is (See Fig. S21). It corresponds probably to the Ru 4d t2g orbitals (brown curve at the highest energy on Fig. 5) [86]. The other states on the UPS spectrum of bulk RuS2 correspond to the hybridized Ru 4d eg – S 3p orbitals. UV–vis DRS was performed on bulk RuS2 and RuS2/TiO2. It shows an indirect band gap of 1.0 eV for RuS2 (See Figs. S22 and S23). A direct transition is also observed at 1.9 eV. Those results agree with the literature [87,88]. At 1.4 eV a transition is also observed, it is assigned to an excitonic peak; a particular state near the valence maximum, photoexcited to the conduction band of RuS2. Using Eg =1.0 eV, the ECB of RuS2 is deduced at -3.8 eV. It is 0.15 eV closer to the vacuum level than the one of TiO2-PC500 (-3.95 eV [59]). It agrees with the band diagram proposed by Hara et al. (except that they report a much larger band gap) [22]. The electron transfer from TiO2 to RuS2 is therefore not favored. As these energy levels are measured in particular conditions (under ultra high vacuum), Mott Schotky analysis would be interesting to perform since the presence of an electrolyte can mimic the wet conditions used of a photocatalytic test [78]. To go further in the investigation of this electron transfer, photocatalytic tests were performed at three energies of the incident photons ( E p h o t o n s ) . Fig. 6 displays the measured PY (i.e. so-called action spectra), the E a , a p p and the A a p p , P Y . The PY increases as a function of E p h o t o n s . It can be due to an intrinsic effect of the E p h o t o n s and/or to the absorption properties of the RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst. Indeed, the absorption coefficient of the photocatalyst increases as a function of E p h o t o n s : α T i O 2 3.65 e V ≈ 10 α T i O 2 3.4 e V ≈ 250 α T i O 2 3.14 e V (See Fig. S22). The higher the amount of photons absorbable by TiO2 is the higher the number of photogenerated charge carriers is and therefore the higher PHER rate is. The evolution of the E a , a p p values as a function of E p h o t o n s evidences an intrinsic effect of the photons energy. The rate-determining step is influenced by E p h o t o n s ; photons with an energy of 3.65 eV are more efficient than those with an energy of 3.14 eV. We assigned this phenomenon to a favorable transfer of the electrons for E p h o t o n s = 3.65 eV (See Scheme 1 ). At E p h o t o n s = 3.14 e V , photons have only enough energy to be excited from the top of the VB to the bottom of the CB. Only few electrons could be transfered to RuS2 and are responsible of the co-catalytic effect of RuS2 ( E a , a p p (RuS2/TiO2) < E a , a p p (TiO2)). At E p h o t o n s = 3.65 e V , the same top VB states are excited to higher CB states and can be easily transfered from TiO2 to RuS2. This transfer occurs only if the additional kinetic energy is not lost due to thermalization. The latter is a phenomenon occurring at the femtosecond scale [89] while the electron transfer occurs at the picosecond scale [90]. These results therefore suggest a hot carrier effect in the RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst where the thermalization is delayed of few order of magnitude. The hot electrons are then transfered to RuS2 and the favorable transfer decreases the E a , a p p measured. It is not the first time that hot charge carriers were evidenced in photocatalysts [91,92]. To confirm the presence of hot electrons and to investigate the electronic transfer additional characterization can be considered, such as time-resolved photoluminescence [93]. The PY increases due to a lower E a , a p p but also due to a higher A a p p , P Y for higher E p h o t o n s (See Fig. 5). We explained the increasing A a p p , P Y by its dependence on the amount of active sites: R u S 2 , s u r f ; e - . In a classic heterogeneous catalytic process, the activity depends on the amount of R u S 2 , s u r f sites available. In photocatalysis, these sites participate to the H2 formation only if they have received an electron from TiO2 to reduce H+. The number of R u S 2 , s u r f ; e - depends therefore on the morphology of the photocatalyst but also on the behaviour of the photogenerated electrons. With a higher E p h o t o n s , electrons can not only be excited from a given VB state to higher CB states but also, higher E p h o t o n s can excite deeper VB states. It results that more VB states are excited therefore more electrons transfer and the amount of R u S 2 , s u r f ; e - increases."
13,Conclusion,"This work provides a detailed study of the influence of several essential parameters on the PHER performance of RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst for the dehydrogenation of the isopropanol. Temperature, flux and energy of the incident photons, alcohol concentration, photocatalyst mass, nature of the titania support and co-catalyst loading were varied. Their influence was coherently explained. The influence of these parameters was not only studied on the PY but also on two additional kinetic parameters: E a , a p p , A a p p . It is the first time that these parameters are used to investigate a photocatalytic mechanism. The PHER system contains several functional elements. Concerted functioning of these elements is necessary to provide optimal PHER performance, from light absorption to hydrogen atoms recombination on the co-catalyst. The single rate-limiting step of PHER does not exist, as depending on the conditions any of the steps might become the bottleneck one. Thus, at low content of organic substrate, holes accommodation and concomitant charges separation might become limiting or when the co-catalyst is lacking or deficient, hydrogen release and/or electron transfer are probably limiting. The experimental conditions (i.e. concentration of isopropanol, mass of the photocatalyst, flux of photons, co-catalyst loading) were optimized. The highest photon yield of this work was obtained for a 0.84 wt% RuS2 loading on anatase TiO2; PY = 3.1 % with the HPK lamp and PY = 6.9 % with the Xe lamp combined with a filter centered at 3.65 eV. As shows the analysis of PY, E a , a p p and A a p p , under optimal conditions the slow reaction step is probably related to charge separation processes. Indeed the full band diagram of the RuS2/TiO2 photocatalyst shows an unfavored electron transfer from TiO2 to RuS2. It seems however that the delayed thermalization of the charge carriers and their excess of kinetic energy permits this transfer and therefore, the production of H2 at the surface of the RuS2/TiO2 co-catalyst."
