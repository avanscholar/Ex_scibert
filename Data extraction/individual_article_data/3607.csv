0,Introduction,"Rapid climatic changes and exponential depletion of fossil fuel reserves make it important to search for alternate energy resources that are environmental friendly, cost effective and sustainable. Hydrogen is considered as an alternative pollution free gaseous fuel for the future. Hydrogen gas is a clean fuel with no CO2 emissions and can easily be used in fuel cells for generation of electricity. Besides, hydrogen has highest heating value of 3042 cals/m3 (considering water as a product) among the known fossil fuels [1]. Dark fermentation and photobiology are two widely known area of biohydrogen production. Dark fermentative hydrogen production is economically feasible because of higher hydrogen production rate and lower doubling time of the microbes than the photo fermentation and biophotolysis [2]. Dark fermentation at thermophilic temperatures favors the kinetics and stoichiometry of H2 production and reduced risk of methanogenic contamination. With increasing temperature, metabolism becomes thermodynamically more favorable and less affected by the partial pressure of hydrogen (pH2) in the liquid phase. Industrial effluents such as from distillery industry, food processing often discharged at higher temperatures which are not suitable for normal mesophilic digestion. Cooling this wastewater to treat under mesophilic conditions is not cost effective and there is always a risk of losing biological activity while cooling [3]. Organic substrates discharged at high temperatures such as hydrolyzates obtained from hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocelluloses or high temperature industrial effluents like distillery wastewater could be used for thermophilic dark fermentation [4]. Thermophilic fermentative H2 producing isolates with a high hydrogen yield and high production rate are important for development and improvement of sustainable biohydrogen production. Various H2 producing mesophilic and thermophilic strains have been identified and studied which includes species of Clostridium sp., Enterobacter sp., Thermoanaerobacterium sp., and Thermotoga sp. Maximum theoretically H2 production yield could be obtained by thermophilic (50 °C) bacteria or extreme thermophilic (55 °C) bacteria [5]. Hydrogen production is greatly influenced by many physical and chemical factors like temperature, pH, substrate concentration and nitrogen sources. One of the most crucial factors is pH that affects hydrogenase activity and also governs the metabolic flux [6]. A proper nitrogen source is required for metabolism during anaerobic fermentation. The role of Fe2+ ion in hydrogen production is that it is a cofactor of hydrogenase enzyme. Electron carrier like an iron–sulfur protein ferredoxin that oxidizes pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2 along with reduction of proton to molecular H2. Iron could also induce metabolic changes and expression of both Fe–S and non-Fe–S proteins associated with hydrogenase enzyme. Therefore, it was presumed that the addition of iron has some effects on the growth of fermentative organisms and the rate of hydrogen production [7]. The thermophilic microorganisms have low cell density that plays as main drawback of thermophilic H2 fermentation processes. Thus the development of efficient cell retainment methods is also required to improve hydrogen production [8]. Continuous hydrogen production using immobilized whole cells was reported by several researchers could be used to increase cell density by retaining cells on the matrix. In general, the solid matrices used for immobilization consist of either synthetic polymers or inorganic materials which have severe disposal problems [9,10]. High rate of hydrogen production can be achieved by developing potent microbial strain and also by improving cell density inside the reactor by whole cell immobilization on environment friendly cheap lignocellulosic matrix [10]. The present study deals with isolation of hydrogen producing thermophilic microbial strain Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum IIT BT-ST1 from thermophilic mixed culture. Taguchi design of experiment was used to investigate about influential parameters involved in hydrogen production. The optimization of the process parameters using surface response methodology was done to improve hydrogen production. Continuous hydrogen production was studied in a tubular packed bed reactor using environment friendly cheap lignocellulosic material as immobilization matrix. Performance of the immobilized reactor over a wide range of dilution rates was studied using glucose as the primary carbon source."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Isolation of the strain ST1,"2.1 Isolation of the strain ST1 Thermophilic mixed culture capable of producing hydrogen was developed from anaerobic sludge [11]. Sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester operating at thermophilic condition (55 °C) of a distillery industry. The raw sludge has 6% of total solid of which 76% was volatile solid. Serial dilution and roll tube technique was used to obtain pure cultures [12]. Several colonies were picked and investigated for hydrogen production. In order to obtain a pure isolates, roll tube technique were repeated several times. Media used for isolation consist of Na2HPO4 (4.2 g L−1), KH2PO4 (1.5 g L−1), NH4Cl (1.95 g L−1), MgCl2 (0.18 g L−1), yeast extract (2.0 g L−1), glucose (10 g L−1), cysteine HCl (1 g L−1), vitamins solution (DSMZ medium No141, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) [11]. Genomic DNA from the pure isolate ST1 was extracted as reported [13]. PCR (Thermal Cycler Eppendorf USA) was performed by amplifying a region of 1 bp of 16S-rRNA genes from extracted genomic DNA using Eubacteria primer pairs 1UF with (5′-GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and UR (5′-GAAAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3′) [14]. The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene of the isolate ST1 was compared with other related sequences available in GenBank using BLAST program [15]."
3,Taguchi optimization of process parameter,"2.2 Taguchi optimization of process parameter Taguchi method gives a response to an analytical approach where factors are divided into different levels. Then significant variance in factor level is determined and thus it predicts the combination of standard factors for optimal factor level. The relative importance of initial pH, temperature, glucose, yeast extract and FeSO4 for hydrogen production were investigated by Taguchi design. In Taguchi design of experiment was used to establish a large number of experimental situations described as orthogonal array (OA). This reduces the errors thus enhancing the efficiency and reproducibility of the laboratory experiments [16,17]. The performance of the output is measured with respective the deviation from its target value. It is represented by a loss function [L(y)], as represented by Eq. (1) [18,19]. (1) L ( y ) = k ( y − m ) Loss function L(y) is dependent on ‘y’ which is the experimental value obtained for each trial. The term ‘k’ denotes the proportionality constant and ‘m’ represents the target value. The loss function can be represented by Eq. (2) (2) L ( y ) = k ( 1 y 2 ) And the expected loss function can be represented by Eq. (3) (3) E [ L ( y ) ] = k E ( 1 y 2 ) where, E(1/y 2) can be estimated from a sample of n as shown in Eq. (4) (4) E ( 1 y 2 ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( 1 y 2 ) / n In experimental design, five factors i.e., temperature, pH, glucose, FeSO4 and yeast extract were considered with three levels of factor to study their influence on the biohydrogen production process (Table 1 ). Subsequently, 27 experiments with different combinations were designed and the data analysis procedure was defined. Levels of factor variation were considered and the diversity of factors was studied by crossing the orthogonal array (OA) as tabulated in Table 2 . The obtained experimental data was processed using the statistical software package MiniTab version 15.10, Minitab Inc., Pennsylvania, USA was used to analyze the experimental design."
4,Multi parameter optimization for improvement of hydrogen production,"2.3 Multi parameter optimization for improvement of hydrogen production The cumulative effect of five processes parameters viz. temperature, pH, glucose, FeSO4 and yeast extract was studied by multi parameter optimization. The variables so chosen were temperature (X 1), pH (X 2), glucose (X 3), FeSO4 (X 4) and yeast extract (X 5). Response variable measured was cumulative hydrogen production (Y). A five factor Box–Behnken design with 46 unique sets and a triplicate on the center point was used and coded [20,21]. The independent variables were coded according to Eq. (5): (5) x i = X i − X i , mid Δ X i where the ith independent variable is represented by x i . The uncoded value of the ith independent variable and the uncoded value at the center point for the ith independent variable are represented by X i , X i,mid respectively. Temperature ranges were varied from 55 °C to 65 °C in steps of 5 °C, glucose concentration was varied from 10 g L−1 to 14 g L−1 in steps of 2 g L−1, pH was varied from 5.5 to 7.5 in steps of 1 unit, yeast extract varied from 2 g L−1 to 6 g L−1 in steps of 2 g L−1, FeSO4 was varied from 16 mM to 24 mM in steps of 4 mM and hydrogen production was observed. Development of Regression Equation was done using statistical software, MINITAB 15. A second degree polynomial Eq. (6) [21] was used to fit the experimental data: (6) Y = C 1 + C 2 X 1 + C 3 X 2 + C 4 X 3 + C 5 X 4 + C 6 X 5 + C 7 X 1 2 + C 8 X 2 2 + C 9 X 3 2 + C 10 X 4 2 + C 11 X 5 2 + C 12 X 1 X 2 + C 14 X 3 X 1 + C 15 X 4 X 1 + C 16 X 5 X 1 + C 17 X 2 X 4 + C 18 X 2 X 5 + C 19 X 3 X 4 + C 20 X 3 X 5 + C 21 X 4 X 5 The multivariate equation Eq. (6) can be simultaneously solved by analyzing response surface methodology. It helps in visualizing the individual and cumulative effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable It also determine the mutual interactions between the independent variables and their subsequent effect on the dependent variable."
5,Continuous hydrogen production by packed bed reactor,"2.4 Continuous hydrogen production by packed bed reactor A cylindrical glass column reactor with a working volume of 350 mL and over headspace of 150 mL was used for continuous hydrogen production (Fig. 1 ). A quasi-steady state was observed at each dilution rate with respect to constant values of H2 evolution rate, glucose and cell mass concentration in the effluent. The experiments were repeated at different flow rates to get maximum hydrogen production and sugar utilization. The reactor was purged initially with sterilized N2 to create anaerobic conditions. The temperature of the reactor was maintained at 60 °C. HRT (hydraulic retention time) was decreased from 5 h to 1 h."
6,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Immobilization of microbes on coconut coir matrix was observed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM 5800) using 20 kV accelerated voltage. After the completion of operation of reactor, the coir matrix was taken out aseptically. The matrix was gently washed with phosphate buffer solution. The matrix was then fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 4 h. The fixed matrix was then dehydrated by successive passages through 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% ethanol each for 15 min."
7,Analysis,"2.6 Analysis The quantitative estimation of hydrogen gas was done by comparing the sample biogas with a standard of pure hydrogen using a gas chromatograph (GC Agilent Technology 7890A U.S.A) equipped with a stainless steel packed with Porapak Q (80/100) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The oven and the detector operational temperatures of the injection port were 80 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The carrier gas (N2) was used at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. Flame ionization detector (FID) was used for VFAs and alcohols estimation. The FID operational temperatures of the injection port, the detector and programmed column were 220 °C, 240 °C, and 130–175 °C, respectively. For flame generation a mixture of hydrogen and air at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 17 was used. The cumulative hydrogen production profile in the batch fermentation was fitted to modified Gompertz equation Eq. (7). (7) H ( t ) = P exp { − exp [ R m P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } where the cumulative hydrogen volume at time “t” (h) is represented by H(t). It was measured by accumulating hydrogen content from the fixed headspace volume at time t (h). Hydrogen potential is represented by P (mL H2). R m (mLh−1) represents maximum hydrogen production rate. The lag time was represented by λ (h). The cumulative hydrogen production profile was fitted to the above equation. Matlab (Curve fitting tool box ver. 1.1.7) tool was used to estimate kinetic parameters (P, R m and λ)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Identification and phenotypic characterization,"3.1 Identification and phenotypic characterization Isolated H2 producing bacteria was gram-positive, rod shaped, with rounded ends and had spore forming ability. 16S rRNA analysis revealed that ST1 is a member of the genus Thermoanaerobacterium. Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum DSM571 was found to be phylogenetically closest to the isolate, showing 98% similarity with 16S rRNA genes. The 16S rRNA accession number at GenBank databases is KC217655. The isolate ST1 showed phenotypic properties that were also consistent with those of the Thermoanaerobacterium spp. Many H2 producing species belonging to genus Thermoanaerobacterium had been previously reported in literature including T. thermosaccharolyticum, Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes [22,23]. The isolate ST1, showed growth utilizing various type of carbohydrates as the sole carbon and energy source under thermophilic condition (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, the substrate utilization spectrum of strain ST1 comprises a variety of macromolecules such as starch, dextran and xylan. These observations shows that the microorganism is capable of utilizing a vast variety of sugars, thus indicating that it can be used to treat different types of organic wastes. The substrate spectrum of ST1 was identical to the one of the T. thermosaccharolyticum type strain, DSM571. Thus, on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene analysis and the substrate utilization spectrum, that ST1 may represent a new strain within the species T. thermosaccharolyticum."
10,Process evaluation and optimization,"3.2 Process evaluation and optimization 3.2.1 Taguchi design of experiment methodology Results obtained with the designed experimental sets show significant variation in the hydrogen production. The levels of each factor was decided by single parameter optimization studies (result not shown here). The Taguchi DOE analysis investigates the influence of factors on the process variations (Table 3 ). A significant variation was observed in the designed experimental sets, indicating that the process efficiency was very much dependent on the selected process conditions. Very low hydrogen production of 448 mL L−1 was reported with a experimental setup having of temperature 65 °C, pH 7.5, glucose 14 g L−1, 16 mM FeSO4 and 6 g L−1 yeast extract respectively. This shows the extreme values of the process parameters causes decrease in H2 production. Highest H2 production of around 4000 mL L−1 was observed with temperature 60 °C, pH 6.5, glucose 12 g L−1, 20 mM FeSO4 and 4 g L−1 yeast extract respectively. Each factor showed the relative influence on output performance. The difference between the values at levels 3 and level 2 (L3-L2) gives the rank to the process parameters according to their degree of influence (Table 4 ). The larger the difference, the stronger is the influence. Among the factors studied, temperature appeared to be most influential factor in hydrogen production because of the thermophilic nature of the isolate, followed by pH and glucose. FeSO4 and yeast extract showed lower lesser influence on hydrogen production. The reason for temperature as most influential factor could be that optimum temperature was required for activation of transporter proteins required for substrate uptake [24]. Another plausible reason could be that on increasing temperature from beyond 60 °C might lead to decrease in hydrogenase activity. Similar orthogonal design method was used by Shenghua et al., for studying the factors influencing hydrogen production from cornstalk wastes [25]. In their study, initial pH and substrate concentration showed significant influence on hydrogen production. 3.2.2 Statistical optimization for improvement of hydrogen production Multi parameter optimization was done to show the interaction among the independent variables such as temperature, pH, glucose, yeast extract and FeSO4. Table 5 represents the design of matrix and experimental results. The theoretical model generated is given as Eq. (8): (8) Y = 3973.81 − 571 X 1 − 859.077 X 2 + 48 X 3 + 2 X 4 + 116.90 X 5 − 19131.16 X 1 2 − 549.77 X 2 2 − 411.2 X 3 2 − 228.0 X 4 2 − 327.83 X 5 2 − 114.28 X 1 X 2 − 171.43 X 1 X 4 − 159.54 X 1 X 5 − 240.00 X 3 X 1 − 114.29 X 2 X 4 − 237.14 X 5 X 2 + 80.0 X 4 X 3 + 12.00 X 5 X 3 − 114.28 X 5 X 4 The regression analysis (R 2 = 0.96) indicates the concurrency of the experimental data with the model. The obtained Fischer variance ratio (F) was found to be 32.50 thus the data obtained is highly significant as it is greater than F 0.05 = 4.772 (significance level: α = 0.05). The response surface curves in Fig. 2 represent the effect of two independent variables on hydrogen production. The most suitable interacting values for hydrogen production were observed at 60 °C and pH 6.5 as shown in Fig. 1. Steep decline in surface plot of hydrogen production was observed at other combinations of pH and temperature which shows very close interaction between these two variables. Further similar to Taguchi model, temperature and pH were found to be two most influential factors in H2 production. The response surface plot shows the effect of two independent variables i.e. FeSO4 and temperature on H2 production (Fig. 2B). The most suitable combination of variables on hydrogen production was observed at 60 °C and 20 mM FeSO4. These two variables was found to play important roles on the hydrogen production as indicated in other studies [26]. Temperature was found dominating variable over FeSO4 as steep incline and decline of hydrogen production was observed in the studied temperature range with respect to all respective FeSO4 concentration. However, at constant temperature, increase in hydrogen production was not significant with increase in FeSO4 concentration. The response curve was shown in Fig. 2C with respect to glucose and pH on hydrogen production. Increasing trend of hydrogen production was observed on increasing the glucose and pH which reached maximum at pH 6.5 and 12 g L−1 glucose. However, further increase in pH and glucose resulted into decreasing trend of hydrogen production. Similar to previous report of Ginkel et al. (2001), which explains that in hydrogen production pH and glucose concentration plays a vital role [27]. The interaction between FeSO4 and pH on hydrogen production is shown using response curve (Fig. 2D). The effect of pH in presence of FeSO4 on hydrogen production was similar to effect of pH in presence of glucose. However, contrary to pH and glucose combination, influence of FeSO4 in presence of pH was less significant. Highest hydrogen production was observed at pH 6.5 and 20 mM FeSO4. The probable reason could be that deviation from optimum pH might deactivate enzymatic machinery of the cells that are required for cellular metabolism [28,29]. The interaction of pH on yeast extract and vice-versa for hydrogen production was similar with interaction of pH on FeSO4 and vice-versa (Fig. 2E). Yeast extract is the source of vitamins and nitrogen. It had significant effect on hydrogen production [30]. At optimum pH all metabolic enzymes are active that would improve utilization of nitrogen source [31]. Influence of yeast extract and FeSO4 on hydrogen production was shown in Fig. 2F. The surface response plot showed significant interaction between two independent variables [32]. Ferric uptake proteins help in transport of Fe2+ ions into the cell which is a cofactor of hydrogenase enzyme [32,33]. Highest hydrogen production was observed at 20 mM FeSO4 and 4 g L−1 of yeast extract. The decreasing trend of hydrogen production was observed on increasing or decreasing the FeSO4 and yeast extract from most suitable concentration. The influence of yeast extract on hydrogen production was more significant at lower concentration FeSO4 compared to its high concentration. The effect of glucose concentration and temperature on hydrogen production was shown Fig. 2G. An increasing trend in hydrogen production was observed up to glucose concentration of 12 g L−1 and temperature 60 °C. In the range of 55 °C–60 °C, increasing trend of hydrogen production was observed on increasing the glucose concentration. However, at higher temperature, effect of glucose on hydrogen production was gradually declined. A decreasing trend was observed beyond these values could be due to substrate inhibition. Similar observation was seen in Fig. 2H and I where glucose plays an influential role in hydrogen production. Similar results was also reported by Pan et al. (2008) describing the influence of initial glucose concentration and other macro and micro nutrients on hydrogen production [34]. Influence of temperature and yeast extract on hydrogen production was shown in Fig. 2J. Most suitable interaction values of temperature and yeast extract concentration was 60 °C and 4 g L−1 respectively. The interaction of temperature with yeast extract and vice-versa was similar to interaction of temperature with FeSO4 and vice-versa. Higher temperature ranges showed decrease in hydrogen production. The plausible phenomenon could be that the temperature greater than 65 °C might result in enzymatic machinery deactivation (ferredoxin oxidoreductase, phosphate acetyltransferase, acetate kinase and hydrogenase) present in these fermentative microorganisms [35,36]. Observation from Taguchi design of experiment was further supported by response surface methodology where interaction amongst each independent factor was studied. Hydrogen production was significantly influenced by the interaction between temperature, pH and glucose. Hydrogen production significantly increase from 3062.85 mL L−1 to 3900.00 mL L−1 when pH was increased from 5.5 to 6.5, keeping glucose concentration, temperature, FeSO4 and yeast extract constant at 12 g L−1, 60 °C, 20 mM and 4 g L−1 respectively. Lesser amount of hydrogen production was observed in all the experimental conditions where extreme temperature and pH values were involved. The mathematical model given by Eq. (8) gave the maximum point of the model at 3897 mL L−1 corresponding to glucose concentration of 12.2 g L−1, pH 6.4, 59.2 °C, 20.1 mM FeSO4 and 4.45 g L−1 yeast extract. Thus the theoretical values gave good resemblance with the experimental values. Batch fermentation under optimized process parameters was shown in Fig. 3 . Cumulative hydrogen production increased from 3rd h and increases upto 15th h and then shows a stationary phase at the end of fermentation. Decrease in hydrogen production beyond 15th h could be due to drop of pH of the fermentation broth. Final pH of the fermentation broth was 4.5 which might have decreased the efficiency of enzymatic machineries required for hydrogen production. The curve fitting to modified Gompertz equation gave following kinetic parameters: maximum H2 production rate (R m ) of 900 mL h−1, gas production potential (P) of 3576 mL L−1 and lag time (λ) of 2.5 h was estimated from. Hydrogen yield of 2.61 ± 0.1 mol mole−1 glucose was also observed."
11,Continuous hydrogen production in immobilized whole cell packed bed reactor,"3.3 Continuous hydrogen production in immobilized whole cell packed bed reactor A packed bed reactor using lignocellulosic support matrices was used to study the effect of dilution rate on hydrogen production, substrate conversion efficiency and biomass concentration in the effluent. Maximum rate of hydrogen production was 1691.42 mL L−1 h−1 with glucose conversion efficiency of 46.07% at 0.6 h−1 dilution rate as shown in Fig. 4 . Hydrogen yield of 2.7 ± 0.1 mol mole−1 glucose was observed at 0.6 h−1 dilution rate. Hydrogen production rate showed a decreasing trend on further increment of dilution rate. The most plausible reason could be due to substrate inhibition at higher flow rates. Moreover, suspended cells concentration also showed decreasing trend at higher dilutions probably due to lower hydraulic retention time. Coir matrix had cell retention (0.40 g dry cell g−1 dry carrier), packing density (40 g L−1 reactor volume). SEM image of immobilized cells on matrix was shown in Fig. 5 . The control (coconut coir matrix without whole cell immobilization) (Fig. 5A) shows no immobilized cells on the matrix where as Fig. 5B shows immobilized cells uniformly spread over the matrix. Thus cheap lignocellulosic matrix can be used for immobilization of microbes. Reports are available on continuous hydrogen production in packed bed reactors, using several immobilized systems on different matrices ranging from organic to inorganic in origin and self flocculated cells [10,37–39]. However, the present process showed better rate of hydrogen production (1691.42 mL L−1 h−1 or 75.5 mmol H2 L−1 h−1) as compared to all these systems (Table 6 ). The composition of volatile fatty acids produced at different dilution rates is shown in Fig. 6 . The order of metabolites were as follows: butyrate (43–56%), acetate (20–28%), ethanol (7–15%), and followed by an insignificant amount of propionate (0–2%). The profile shows that butyrate was the predominant metabolite. The metabolites increased slightly with increase in dilution rate. Also, a small amount of propionate production was observed. Propionate production showed a decreasing trend at dilution rates beyond 0.5 h−1. The plausible reason for such trends could be due to inhibition of propionate pathway at low pH or it might be sensitive to higher dilution rates, which had also been reported by other researchers [40]. During metabolism of glucose, the catalysis of pyruvate decarboxylation by ferredoxin generates 1 mol of hydrogen along with volatile fatty acids such as butyric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and ethanol. The production of volatile fatty acids were influenced by the ratio of NAD+ (oxidized form)/(NADH + H+) (reduced form), which existed at certain ratio in microorganisms. Production of ethanol and propionic acid involves oxidization of NADH + H+. For one mole of ethanol or propionic acid production, 2 mol of NADH + H+ were oxidized. Thus, when acetic acid fermentation is coupled with ethanol/propionic fermentation, a dynamic equilibrium between oxidation/reduction of NAD+/NADH + H+ could be reached at a mole ratio of ethanol to acetic acid of 1:1. The dynamic equilibrium between NAD+/NADH + H+ gets disturbed when the ratio of ethanol to acetic acid was either above 1 or below 1. This implies that fermentation processes were not stable inside microorganisms. In the above study the ethanol to acetic acid ratio was lower than the equilibrium value thus suggesting that the fermentation process was unstable. Similar observation was also reported by Ren et al., where hydrogen production using molasses was influenced by ethanol to acetic acid ratio [41]. The metabolic pathways in dark fermentative biohydrogen production are greatly influenced by pH of the media. Moreover, the hydrogenase activity is also influenced by pH [42]. In continuous hydrogen production with suspended culture systems, an automatically pH controlled fermentor was indispensable, which need high operational costs. Several reports were available of influence of pH on hydrogen production. It was reported that using different pH values between 3.4 and 6.3 for hydrogen production, the pH of 4.2 gave highest hydrogen yield as 1.61 mol mole−1 sucrose [43]. Khanal et al. reported the inhibition of hydrogen production at lower pH thus concluding that pH should not be lower than a certain level [44]. In continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), maintaining pH inside the reactor is easy but it is difficult to maintain the pH inside a packed bed reactor. In the present study, all the concerns with pH drop inside packed bed reactor could be addressed by supplementing feed media with buffering capacity (inlet pH value at 6.5). It was seen that supplying enough amount of buffering capacity in the influent provided a stable pH values between 5 and 5.8 inside the reactor (Fig. 7 ). From the statistical optimization study it was observed that hydrogen production was highly influence in the pH range of 5.5–6.5. Thus by providing buffered media in the feed might thus improve reactor performance in packed bed reactor. Similar observation was also made by Keskin et al., where they used immobilized biofilm system for continuous hydrogen production [46]. An immobilized bioreactor configuration provides a major cost and operational advantage."
12,Conclusion,"Newly isolated T. thermosaccharolyticum was found suitable for H2 production. According to Taguchi design of experiment, temperature was found to be most influential parameter followed by pH and glucose. Multi parameter optimization gave good resemblance with the experimentally optimized value. In continuous system, high rate of H2 production was observed as compared to batch fermentation. Coconut coir was found to be a suitable solid matrix for immobilization of whole cells."
