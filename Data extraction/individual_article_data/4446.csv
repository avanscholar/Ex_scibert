0,Introduction,"Catalyst stability is one of the most important challenges in the development of new catalysts for producing hydrogen from ethanol for use in fuel cell applications [1]. Regardless of the metal and support used, significant deactivation during steam reforming (SR) of ethanol has been reported in the literature. The deposition of carbonaceous species is one of the main causes of catalyst deactivation [1–4]. Therefore, the design of a catalyst resistant to coke formation is still an issue. Different strategies have been used to reduce or to prevent the formation of carbon during SR of ethanol [1]. One of the approaches adopted has been the control of particle size. The metal particle size significantly influences the carbon deposition rate. The formation of carbon is reduced or inhibited on smaller Ni crystallite size [5,6]. Therefore, controlling the number of atoms in an ensemble may suppress the coke formation rate. Since the preparation method of the catalyst significantly affects the metal particle size, it plays a key role in determining the carbon deposition rate. Various methods of catalyst preparation have been proposed for obtaining highly dispersed metallic particles. Mixed oxides such as perovskite-type oxides have been reported as promising catalyst precursors for SR of ethanol [5–12]. The reduction of this mixed oxide produces thermally stable and highly dispersed metallic particles [13]. In addition, the perovskite-type oxide exhibits a high oxygen mobility, which may contribute for the removal of carbon deposits [14]. de Lima et al. [11] studied the performance of LaNiO3 perovskite-type oxide precursor prepared by precipitation as a catalyst for both SR and OSR of ethanol. Depending on reaction conditions, catalyst deactivated mainly due to carbon deposition. A La2O3-supported Ni metal catalyst prepared by the impregnation method was also tested for comparison. The higher Ni dispersion of perovskite-derived catalyst than Ni/La2O3 catalyst prepared by the conventional method led to a lower carbon formation rate during OSR at 773K. The OSR of ethanol was performed by using LaNiO3, LaCoO3, LaFeO3, LaMnO3 perovskite-type oxides derived catalysts [5]. The reduced LaNiO3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity and selectivity to H2, which was attributed to the well dispersed Ni particles. In addition, this highly dispersed Ni particles significantly decreased carbon deposition. Recently, de Lima et al. [6] investigated the effect of lanthanum substitution by cerium oxide on the performance of La1−x Ce x NiO3 (x =0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.7 and 1.0) perovskite-type oxide precursor for OSR of ethanol. They reported that the higher resistance to carbon formation on La0.90Ce0.10NiO3 catalyst was due to the smaller Ni crystallite size. The preparation method of perovskite-type oxides may also affect the metal particle size. Kuras et al. [15] synthesized LaNiO3 perovskite-type oxides by three methods: Pechini, citrate and propianate. The Ni crystallite size depended on the preparation method, the sample prepared by citrate method exhibiting the lowest value. A large variety of chemical methods have been reported to be effective in producing homogeneous perovskite-type oxides such as co-precipitation, citrate, Pechini and self-combustion. Among them, the combustion method exhibit several advantages such as low processing cost, simplicity, energy efficiency and high production rate [16,17]. This method involves the use of an organic compound (urea, glycine) as fuel and metal nitrates as oxidizers. Heating the mixture produces an exothermic reaction that leads to formation of the precursor. However, to our knowledge this method was not used to prepare catalysts for hydrogen production through SR of ethanol. The aim of this work was to study the performance of LaNiO3 perovskite-type oxides prepared by the self combustion method as a catalyst precursor for ethanol decomposition (ED), SR of ethanol and partial oxidation (POX) of ethanol at different reaction temperatures. The effect of the fuel-to-oxidizers ratio (φ) on catalyst stability as well as the amount of carbon formed was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG)."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The LaNiO3 perovskites were prepared by combustion method, using different values of the elemental stoichiometric coefficient (φ =0.7; 1.0 and 4.0). The so-called fuel-to-oxidizers ratio (φ) was defined as the ratio of the total valences of fuel (urea) to the total valence of oxidizers (nitrates of nickel and lanthanum). The composition of the solution containing lanthanum nitrate, nickel nitrate and urea was based on the total oxidizing and reducing valences of the oxidizers and fuel, as described by Hwang et al. [18]. The aqueous suspension containing the adequate amount of urea and nitrate precursors was stirred on a heating plate until spontaneous ignition. The resulting samples were calcined in a muffle at 1073K for 1h. Then, three samples were obtained: LaNiO3-0.7 (φ =0.7); LaNiO3-1 (φ =1.0) and LaNiO3-4 (φ =4.0)."
3,BET surface area,2.2 BET surface area The BET surface areas of the samples were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer by nitrogen adsorption at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen.
4,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"2.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the calcined and reduced/passivated samples was obtained with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å) using a RIGAKU diffractometer. Data were collected between 2θ =25° and 75° using a scan rate of 0.04°/step and a scan time of 1s/step. The Scherrer equation was used to estimate the crystallite mean diameter of CeO2, NiO, and Ni particles. For the measurements of the crystallite mean diameter of Ni particles, the calcined samples were reduced under pure hydrogen (30mL/min) at different temperatures (673, 773, 873 and 1023K) for 1h, purged under N2 at the same temperature for 30min and cooled to 298K. Then, the reactor was maintained at 209K for 1h, using a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and liquid nitrogen and the catalyst was passivated with a 5% O2/He mixture."
5,TG analysis,2.4 TG analysis Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were performed using a TA Instrument TGA analyzer (SDT Q 600) in order to quantify the amount of carbon formed over the catalyst. Approximately 10mg of spent catalyst was heated under air flow from room temperature to 1173K at a heating rate of 20K/min and the corresponding change in weight was measured.
6,SEM,2.5 SEM SEM of the spent catalysts was carried out using a FEI Inspect S scanning electron microscope equipped with a secondary electron analyzer. The microscope was also equipped with an EDAX analytic system energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
7,Reaction conditions,"2.6 Reaction conditions ED, SR and POX of ethanol reactions were performed in a quartz tube reactor at 773 and 1073K and atmospheric pressure. Prior to reaction, samples were reduced under pure hydrogen (30mL/min) at 1023K for 1h and then purged with N2 at the same temperature for 30min. For SR, a H2O/ethanol molar ratio of 3.0 was used. POX was conducted using an O2/ethanol molar ratio of 0.5. The reactant mixtures were obtained using two saturators containing water and ethanol, which were maintained at the temperature required to obtain the desired H2O/ethanol and O2/ethanol molar ratios. For ED and POX, N2 (30mL/min) and 5.6% O2/N2 mixture (30mL/min), respectively, were passed through the saturator with ethanol, and then the reactant mixtures obtained were diluted with N2 (each N2 stream flowed at 30mL/min). In the case of SR, the reactant mixture was obtained by flowing two N2 streams (30mL/min) through each saturator containing ethanol and water separately. The partial pressure of ethanol was maintained constant for all experiments. In order to observe the catalyst deactivation within a short timeframe, a small amount of catalyst was used (20mg). The samples were diluted with inert SiC (SiC mass/catalyst mass=3.0). The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Micro GC Agilent 3000 A) containing three channels for three thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and three columns: a molecular sieve, a Poraplot Q and OV-1 column. The ethanol conversion and selectivity to products were determined as follows: (1) X ethanol = ( n ethanol ) fed − ( n ethanol ) exit ( n ethanol ) fed × 100 (2) S x = ( n x ) produced ( n total ) produced × 100 where (n x )produced, moles of x produced (x =hydrogen, CO, CO2, methane, acetaldehyde or ethylene) and (n total)produced, moles of H2 +moles of CO+moles of CO2 +moles of methane+moles of acetaldehyde+moles of ethylene (i.e., the moles of water produced are not included)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The BET surface area of all perovskite-type oxides was very low (<10.0m2/g), which is characteristic of these materials prepared after calcination at high temperature. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the calcined samples. The diffractograms of the three samples exhibited the diffraction lines characteristic of the LaNiO3 rhombohedral phase (PDF 33-0711). This result indicated that the perovskite structure is the main phase obtained after calcination regardless of the value of φ. For the sample with φ =4, the lines corresponding to NiO (PDF 44-1159) and La2NiO4 (PDF 34-0314) phases were also detected. La2NiO4 perovskite-like K2NiF4 tetragonal structure can be described as a succession of perovskite layers alternating with LaO layers [19] and has been reported in the literature [16,20]. The NiO crystallite size calculated using the Scherrer equation was 31.1nm. In order to investigate the reduction mechanism of the LaNiO3 samples prepared by combustion, XRD experiments of LaNiO3-0.7 and LaNiO3-4 samples were carried out after reduction at 673, 773, 873 and 1023K. The diffractograms of the LaNiO3-0.7 and LaNiO3-4 precursors after reduction at different temperatures were shown in Fig. 2a and b. For the LaNiO3-0.7 sample (Fig. 2a), the lines characteristic of LaNiO3 rhombohedral phase were shifted to higher 2θ after reduction at 673K. This result could be attributed to the formation of an intermediate phase of La2Ni2O5 perovskite (PDF 36-1230). Furthermore, it was also observed the appearance of the lines corresponding to Ni0 and La2O3 phases, indicating that the perovskite structure was partially destroyed. According to the literature [5,13–15,21], the temperature-programmed reduction profiles of LaNiO3 samples exhibit two peaks at around 693 and 823K. The first peak was assigned to the reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+, producing the La2Ni2O5 intermediate phase (Eq. (1)), while the last one was attributed to the reduction of La2Ni2O5 to metallic Ni and La2O3 (Eq. (2)). Therefore, our results agrees very well with the TPR profiles reported in the literature. (1) 2LaNiO3 +H2 →La2Ni2O5 +H2O (2) La2Ni2O5 +2H2 →2Ni0 +La2O3 +2H2O The reduction at 773K led to the disappearance of the lines related to the La2Ni2O5 phase. The diffractogram exhibited only the lines typical of La2O3 and metallic Ni. Increasing the temperature to 873K did not change significantly the diffractogram. However, after reduction at 1023K, it was noted the presence of the lines characteristic of La(OH)3 and metallic Ni. Some authors [22] reported that the exposure of the La2O3 to air humidity led to the formation of La(OH)3 phase. In the case of LaNiO3-4 (Fig. 2b), the XRD patterns obtained after reduction at 673K presents the diffraction lines corresponding to La2NiO4, La2O3 and metallic Ni phases. This result suggests that the La2NiO4 phase was partially destroyed, leading to the formation of La2O3 and metallic Ni phases (Eq. (3)). When the reduction temperature was increased to 773K, the lines characteristic of La2NiO4 completely disappeared and the diffractogram showed only the lines corresponding to La2O3 and metallic Ni phases. Increasing the reduction temperature to 873K did not change the diffractogram. After reduction at 1023K, only the diffraction lines corresponding to La(OH)3 and metallic Ni phases were present. (3) La2NiO4 +H2 →Ni0 +La2O3 +H2O The crystallite sizes of metallic Ni obtained by Scherrer equation after different reduction temperatures were listed in Table 1 . Increasing reduction temperature increased the crystallite sizes of metallic Ni for both samples, regardless of φ. However, LaNiO3-4 sample exhibited the largest crystallite size of metallic Ni at all temperatures studied, indicating that the increase of φ favored the growing of crystallite size of metallic Ni. One of the advantages for the use perovskite-type oxides as catalyst precursor is that the reduction of this mixed oxide produces highly dispersed metallic particles. The reduction leads to the destruction of the LaNiO3 and the formation of metallic Ni particles supported on La2O3. The presence of Ni3+ in the structure of the perovskite reduces the sintering during the reduction. We have recently reported that large Ni crystallite size was obtained, when NiO particles supported on La2O3 were reduced. On the other hand, the reduction of LaNiO3 perovskite results in highly dispersed Ni particles over La2O3 [11]. In the present work, the fuel-to-oxidizers ratio (φ) significantly affected the phases formed after calcination. For the samples with φ =0.7 and 1.0, LaNiO3 perovskite was the only phase detected in the diffractograms of the calcined samples. The increase of φ value favored the segregation of NiO phase. Therefore, this result suggests that the presence of isolated NiO particles contributed to the growth of the crystallite size of metallic Ni during reduction."
10,SR reaction,"3.2 SR reaction 3.2.1 SR over LaNiO3-0.7, LaNiO3-1 and LaNiO3-4 at 773K Ethanol conversion and product distributions as a function of time on stream (TOS) for SR of ethanol at 773K with H2O/ethanol molar ratio of 3.0 over reduced LaNiO3-0.7, LaNiO3-1 and LaNiO3-4 catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The initial ethanol conversion was complete for all samples. However, after a period of stability, a significant deactivation was detected during TOS, regardless of φ. The loss of activity was higher for LaNiO3-4. Regarding the product distributions, H2, CO2, CO and methane were observed for all samples. The formation of by-products such as acetaldehyde and ethylene was not detected. These results are in agreement with the reaction mechanism proposed for ethanol reforming [23], suggesting that the ethanol decomposition and ethanol reforming reactions were favored over all catalysts studied. The selectivities to products remained constant along the run. Some authors reported similar results over Co and Ni catalysts during SR at 773K [11,23–25]. In fact, this result is due to the catalyst deactivation. When catalyst loss activity, the moles of x formed decreases as well as the total amount of products formed. Therefore, the selectivity remains constant since it was defined as a ratio. 3.2.1.1 Characterization of catalysts after SR at 773K In this work, all catalysts deactivated during SR at 773K. According to the literature [11,23,26–28], the main cause of catalyst deactivation during SR of ethanol is the formation of carbon deposits, comprising both filamentous carbon and amorphous carbon covering the metallic particles and the support. In this work, TG and SEM analyses were carried out to investigate the reasons for catalyst deactivation during SR of ethanol. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of LaNiO3-0.7, LaNiO3-1 and LaNiO3-4 obtained after SR at 773K. The formation of carbon filaments is clearly observed over all catalysts. Similar results were reported by Lima et al. [11] for SR over Ni/La2O3 catalysts obtained from LaNiO3 perovskites prepared by precipitation method. They also observed the presence of carbon filaments over the catalyst, after reaction at 773K and H2O/ethanol molar ratio of 3.0. SEM analyses also revealed that increasing the value of φ increased the amount of carbon filaments. According to the reaction mechanism proposed for the SR of ethanol [1], the decomposition of dehydrogenated species (e.g., ethoxy, acetaldehyde, acetyl) and acetate species all produce hydrogen, CO, and CH x species, which can in turn result in carbon formation. The CH x species can be further dehydrogenated to form H and C. In the case of Ni-based catalysts, this highly reactive carbon species can diffuse through the Ni crystallite and nucleate the growth of carbon filaments. The TPO profiles of LaNiO3-0.7, LaNiO3-1 and LaNiO3-4 catalysts after SR at 773K are presented in Fig. 5 . All catalysts exhibited a peak corresponding to carbon oxidation at around 826–844K. Furthermore, LaNiO3-0.7 also presented small peaks at 577 and 950K. Some studies reported the formation of CO2 at the low temperature region, which were attributed to carbonates decomposition [29] and oxidation of amorphous carbon overlaying the Ni surface [31]. On the other hand, the CO2 formed at high temperatures was related to filamentous and graphitic carbon [11,30,31]. Therefore, in the present work, the TPO profiles indicate mainly the oxidation of carbon filaments at 826-844K for all samples, which agree very well with the SEM analyses. Furthermore, the small peaks of CO2 formation at 577 and 950K can be associated with carbonates decomposition and oxidation of graphitic carbon, respectively. Table 2 lists the amount of carbon deposited over all catalysts after SR at 773K. Increasing φ significantly increased the amount of carbon formed. This result is in agreement with those obtained by SEM images. In fact, XRD experiments revealed that the increase of φ led to an increase of Ni crystallite size, which favored the higher carbon formation. Therefore, the definition of the fuel-to-oxidizers ratio is fundamental to control the metal particle size and it plays a critical role in determining catalyst stability during SR of ethanol. Chen et al. [5] and de Lima et al. [6] demonstrated that the carbon deposition rate during OSR of ethanol is strongly dependent on the Ni particle size. The formation of carbon is reduced or inhibited on smaller Ni crystallite size. de Lima et al. [6] compared the performance of a Ni metal catalyst derived from a LaNiO3 perovskite-type oxide precursor with that of a La2O3-supported Ni metal catalyst prepared by the conventional impregnation method. The amount of carbon deposited during OSR at 773K over the Ni/La2O3 catalyst prepared by the conventional method was significantly (i.e., 6-fold) higher than that observed for the Ni/La2O3 catalysts derived from the LaNiO3 perovskite-type oxide. This result was attributed to the higher Ni dispersion of perovskite-derived catalyst. According to the literature, the initiation step for carbon formation is more difficult for smaller particle sizes [32]. Since the LaNiO3-0.7 exhibited the lowest carbon formation, the performance of this catalyst on ethanol conversion reactions was studied in greater detail. The effect of the reaction conditions (reaction temperature and feed composition) was investigated. 3.2.2 ED, SR and POX over LaNiO3-0.7 at 1073K Fig. 6 shows ethanol conversion and product distributions as a function of TOS for ED, SR and POX at 1073K over LaNiO3-0.7. The initial ethanol conversion was 100% and remained constant during 28h TOS for all reaction conditions studied. Regarding product distributions for ED, H2, CO and CH4 were the main products formed. In addition, small amounts of ethylene were also observed. These results suggested that ethanol decomposition and dehydration reactions were favored during ED. In the case of SR and POX, it was observed the production of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. When the product distribution obtained for SR at 1073K was compared with the one obtained for SR at 773K, it was noted that the increase of reaction temperature led to an increase of CO production and a decrease of CO2 formation. Fatsikostas et al. [30] reported similar results for SR of ethanol over La2O3 supported Ni catalysts at different reaction temperatures. At temperatures higher than 973K, the selectivity to CO2 decreased whereas the production of CO increased. These results were attributed to the occurrence of the reverse of water gas shift reaction (Eq. (4)). (4) CO2 +H2 ↔CO+H2O The feed composition also affected the product distributions. The addition of water favored the H2 and CO2 formation and inhibited the ethylene and CH4 production. The increase in H2 and CO2 production is associated with the occurrence of water-gas shift reaction; while the decrease in ethylene and CH4 selectivities indicates that ethanol and CH4 steam reforming are the main reactions taking place. The addition of water to the feed inhibits the dehydration of ethanol reaction [23,25,33]. As observed in the case of SR, the presence of oxygen in the feed also increased the CO2 formation and reduced the production of CH4 and ethylene. However, a decrease in the H2 production was now observed. These results were likely due to the occurrence of combustion reactions. 3.2.2.1 Characterization of LaNiO3-0.7 after ED, SR and POX at 1073K Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of LaNiO3-0.7 obtained after ED, SR and POX at 1073K. The formation of carbon filaments was only detected over LaNiO3-0.7 after ED. These results showed that the addition of water or oxygen contributed to the suppression of carbon filaments formation. Augusto et al. [25] observed similar results for ED, SR POX of ethanol over Ni/CeGd catalyst at 1073K. The TPO profiles after ED, SR and POX of ethanol at 1073K were shown in Fig. 8 . All profiles exhibited a small peak around 595–617K, which corresponds to carbonates decomposition. However, after ED, a large peak was detected at 901K and a shoulder was observed at 981K that can be assigned to oxidation of carbon filaments and graphitic carbon, respectively. In addition, the amount of carbon formed after ED was much higher than the one observed after SR and POX (Table 2). These results were in agreement with SEM images. According to the mechanism proposed for the reactions of ethanol conversion over supported metal catalysts [1], the CH x species formed by the decomposition of dehydrogenated species and acetate species can react with O2 or H2O of the feed to produce CO x species, avoiding carbon deposition on catalyst surface. Furthermore, a comparison between the results obtained for SR at 773K and those observed for SR at 1073K revealed that the increase of reaction temperature significantly improved the stability of the catalyst. This result is likely due to the inhibition of the formation of carbon filaments during SR of ethanol at high temperature (Table 2). According to the literature [23,25,34], the rate of carbon deposition over Ni-based catalysts during SR of ethanol is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. When the SR of ethanol was performed at low temperatures (673 and 773K), catalysts significantly deactivated and carbon filaments were formed. At high reaction temperature (1073K), carbon filaments were not detected. These results were attributed to the occurrence of both the reverse of Boudouard reaction (Eq. (5)) and the carbon gasification reaction (Eq. (6)) that contributes to the removal of carbon deposits formed. Therefore, the occurrence of these reactions may explain the improved resistance to catalyst deactivation during SR at 1073K in our work. Reverse of Boudouard reaction: (5) CO2 +C→2CO Carbon gasification reaction: (6) H2O+C→CO+H2"
11,Conclusions,"The results obtained in this work showed that the fuel-to-oxidizers ratio φ and the reaction conditions (reaction temperature and feed composition) significantly affected the performance of Ni-based catalysts obtained from LaNiO3 perovskite-type oxides synthesized by combustion method during ethanol conversion reactions. The XRD analysis of the calcined samples showed that increasing φ favored the NiO segregation and the formation of La2NiO4 phase, which resulted in the formation of large crystallites of metallic Ni, after reduction. The results obtained on SR at 773K showed that the increase of φ from 0.7 to 4.0 did not have a positive effect on catalyst stability. This result was related to the higher amount of carbon formed over the sample with highest φ value, since it exhibited the largest Ni crystallite size. However, increasing reaction temperature and adding water or O2 to the feed inhibited the formation of carbon and improved catalyst stability. The absence of carbon formation at high reaction temperature was likely due to the occurrence of both the reverse of Boudouard reaction and the carbon gasification reaction. Moreover, the addition of water or oxygen to the feed promoted the mechanism of carbon removal, inhibiting the formation of carbon deposits on the Ni/La2O3 catalysts during the SR and POX."
