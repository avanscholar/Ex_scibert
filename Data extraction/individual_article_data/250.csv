0,Introduction,"Population growth and consumerism affect the natural environment (Sanders and Langeveld, 2020). The response to global climate change, environmental pollution, and increasing consumption of fossil fuels is the development of a bio-based economy based on biotechnological processes (Van Schoubroeck et al., 2018). The traditional methods of dealing with organic-rich industrial wastewater lead to the loss of a valuable source of carbon. The utilization of agro-industrial wastewater during mixed (open) culture fermentation (MCF) ensures the production of added-value chemical compounds and environmentally friendly waste management. Commercialized and widespread technology based on MCF is anaerobic digestion (AD). AD is the process by which organic matter is converted into methane-rich biogas that can be used to generate heat and electricity (Karki et al., 2021). However, despite advances in the engineering of AD, the process has so far struggled with economic viability. It was estimated that 2 euro worth of compost or 76 euro worth of biogas could be obtained through AD from one ton of food waste (De Groof et al., 2019). Therefore, a new spectrum of products is being sought and more and more attention is paid to newly developed carboxylate platforms, leading to the formation of medium chain carboxylates (MCCs). Caproate, containing 6 carbon atoms in the molecule, due to its wide industrial application, is one of the most popular MCC. It can be used directly as a food additive and antibacterial agent, as well as in the production of lubricants, gums, dyes, pharmaceuticals and it can be a precursor for jet fuel production (Spirito et al., 2014). Caproate in carboxylate platform can be formed by the CE through the fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) pathway or more widespread cyclic reverse β-oxidation (RBO) pathway (Angenent et al., 2016; Han et al., 2018). Chemical compounds that are electron donors play a key role in the RBO pathway. An electron donor is oxidized providing acetyl-CoA to the RBO cycle, in which in a series of enzymatic reactions the carbon chain of the carboxylate (electron acceptor) is always elongated by two carbon atoms, e.g. acetate is elongated to butyrate and butyrate to caproate. So far ethanol is the most recognized electron donor for MCC production (Han et al., 2019). Nevertheless, many researchers are starting to turn their attention to other promising compounds like lactate, which is contained in waste from the food and agricultural industry, e.g. acid whey from the dairy industry, grass silage juice, and maize silage. Zhu et al. (2015) conducted the process of converting lactate to caproate for the first time. Lactate oxidation provided the necessary acetyl-CoA as well as acetate, thus there was no need to supply an external electron acceptor for caproate production. However, there are some limitations of lactate-based carboxylate platform affecting production stability, such as competitive metabolic pathways (methanogenesis and acrylate pathway) and lactate overloading as a result of the occurrence of residual (excess) lactate in the bioreactor, which may cause a decline in the MCC production and the acrylate pathway activation (Kucek et al., 2016a). Most of the research so far has focused on the effects of operational parameters (pH, temperature, and hydraulic retention time (HRT)) and the competition between microorganisms, but no studies have been reported on the influence of external acetate on the continuous lactate-based CE in MCF. Increased caproate production can be expected with the addition of external acetate, as well as lower lactate consumption per one mole of produced caproate. The addition of acetate in batch conversion of lactate to caproate with isolated Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 resulted in a slight decrease (about 11%) in lactate consumption per one mole of produced caproate (Zhu et al., 2017). However, it is not known how the addition of external acetate would affect the product spectrum, the stability and efficiency of carboxylates production, and the residual lactate occurrence in continuous MCF. Moreover, in our recent research, we have proposed product diversification by co-production of caproate and hydrogen which can be a mutually beneficial solution increasing economic viability of the carboxylate platform (Brodowski et al., 2020). Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in future energy systems and is considered to be one of the most promising energy carriers (Bundhoo and Mohee, 2016). Although lactate is not considered a suitable substrate for hydrogen production (Baghchehsaraee et al., 2009), it was shown that it can be produced from lactate as the sole carbon source (Ohnishi et al., 2012). Most of the research focused on producing hydrogen from lactate used acetate as an additional carbon source. Lactate acted as an electron donor and its presence determined the production of hydrogen, but the presence of acetate, which served as an oxidant agent, was shown to be essential to avoid hydrogen production inhibition (García-Depraect et al., 2019a; Tao et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2012). In addition, the main by-product of biological hydrogen production from lactate and acetate was butyrate (Tao et al., 2016), which can be used by chain elongators to produce caproate. Thus, the addition of external acetate may not only affect the conversion of lactate to MCC, but also the production of hydrogen. The main objective of the study was to investigate how the addition of an external electron acceptor (acetate) would affect the conversion of lactate to MCCs and hydrogen co-production in a continuous process. The process was carried out in two continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR); the first one was fed only with lactate, whereas the second one was fed with lactate and acetate. Both were fed until they were overloaded. External acetate was added to the first bioreactor once overloading was achieved to examine external acetate addition on the lactate overloading. Microbial community analysis was conducted to shed a light on the external acetate influence on lactate-based chain elongation. Co-occurrence networks based on taxon abundances and process parameters and time were investigated for inferring the possible ecological interactions and potential metabolic functions."
1,Material and methods,
2,Medium and inoculum,"2.1 Medium and inoculum A synthetic medium was used in the experiment. The medium was prepared based on Grimalt-Alemany et al. (2018) with the following modifications: 10 mL/L of the 1 M K2HPO4 solution and 15 mL/L of the 1 M KH2PO4 solution were added to the medium. Lactate and acetate solutions were the carbon sources. The sludge obtained from a 1 L upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor producing caproate in the CE process from acid whey and located at the Poznan University of Technology was used as the inoculum (Duber et al., 2018). The sludge was prepared as follows: 80 mL (per one bioreactor) of UASB sludge was collected, then centrifugated, washed, resuspended in 5 mL of 0.9% w/v NaCl solution, and added to each bioreactor."
3,Bioreactor system,"2.2 Bioreactor system Two 1 L Lambda Minifor fermenters (LAMBDA Instruments GmbH, Baar-Switzerland) with automatic pH, temperature, agitation monitoring, and a control system were used (Fig. 1 ). The agitation system was based on the up-and-down movement of stirring discs. The weighing module was used to set and maintain a constant weight of the vessel (the outflow pump was activated when the preset weight was exceeded). IR radiation heater, which was placed at the bottom of the vessel, was used for temperature adjustment. The InPro 3253 pH electrode (Mettler-Toledo International Inc., UK) combined with a temperature sensor was used for in-line measurements. The reactor was equipped with four peristaltic pumps (medium inflow, effluent outflow, acid and base inflows). Hydrochloric acid (0.5 M) and sodium hydroxide (2 M) were used to maintain the constant pH. The pH was continuously monitored by an automatic pH control system (microprocessor) built into a bioreactor control unit. Based on the difference between the actual value and the set value, the base or acid was automatically pumped into the bioreactor. The gas production was quantified using a volumetric gas flow meter (Ritter, Germany)."
4,Operating conditions and process strategy,"2.3 Operating conditions and process strategy The process was divided into different phases based on the concentration of lactate and acetate in the feedstock as specified in Table 1 . For the first bioreactor, denoted as B1, the process was divided into the start-up phase and phases from I to IV. The lactate concentration in the feedstock was 400 mM C in the start-up phase, and then, in each of the next phases (I-III), it was increased by 50% compared to the previous one. In the last phase (IV), where lactate concentration was maintained at the same level as in the phase III, the acetate in an amount of 200 mM C was added to the medium. In the second bioreactor, denoted as B2, the process was divided into a start-up phase and phases from I to III. Initially (start-up phase) the concentrations of lactate and acetate in the feedstock were 400 mM C and 200 mM C, respectively. Then (phases I- III) the lactate concentration in the feedstock was increased by 50% compared to the previous phase with a constant concentration of acetate. The duration of the phase III in B2 (days 89–140) corresponded to the duration of the phase III (89–118) and the phase IV (119–140) in the B1. There were no gas measurements at the beginning of the process due to technical problems with gas flow meters, on day 32 the gas flow meters (Ritter, Germany) were reconnected. The process was initiated using a diluted medium with distilled water (the ratio of medium to water was 1:1 [vol:vol]) and the inoculum. The working volume of each of the bioreactor was 0.8 L. Nitrogen gas was used to flush fermenters to ensure anaerobic conditions (at the start of the process and on the day 32 after reconnecting the gas flow meters). The agitation frequency was set at 1 Hz. The process was carried out with a constant temperature of 30 °C and a constant pH of 5.5. The HRT was maintained at 5 days."
5,Analytical techniques and calculations,"2.4 Analytical techniques and calculations Analysis of gas composition (methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen) was performed using the Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with the Porapak N packed column and the TCD detector, under isothermal conditions. Nitrogen at a flow rate of 15 mL/min was used as the carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, column and detector were 110 °C, 50 °C and 80°, respectively. Organic acids and alcohols concentrations were monitored by a gas chromatography with FID detector (Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with Zebron ZB-FFAP column) using helium as the carrier gas and a ramp temperature program (initial temperature 70 °C for 2.5 min; temperature ramp 11 °C per min to 185 °C; final temperature 185 °C for 10 min). The injection port and detector were set to 250 °C. The concentration of lactate was monitored with a high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu LC-20, Rezex ROA-Organic Acid column, RI detector). The detailed analytical procedure was described in (Zagrodnik et al., 2020). Equations for the analysis (i.e. carboxylates production rates and product specificities) were as described in Duber et al. (2020). Product-to-carboxylates specificities were calculated as the ratio of the production rate of a specific carboxylate to the production rate of all detected carboxylates."
6,Microbiome analysis,"2.5 Microbiome analysis Collected biomass samples were centrifugated and stored frozen at −20 °C until processing. The denotation of the sample indicates the bioreactor (B1 and B2) and the day of the collection. On days 107 and 112, samples (B1d107 and B1d112) were collected only from a B1 to study the microbiome structure during fluctuations in the residual lactate concentration and the carboxylate production in the phase III. Total metagenomic DNA was isolated using GeneMATRIX Soil DNA Purification Kit (EURx, Poland) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard D6300 (Zymoresearch, USA) was used as a mock microbial community to evaluate the analysis pipeline. Amplification of V3 and V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was carried out with Phusion Green Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (2 U/μL) and primers 341F (5′- TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 785R (5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC). The PCR reaction was carried out with 25 cycles and an annealing temperature of 50 °C. The resulting libraries were submitted to Macrogen (Korea) for index PCR and further processing according to 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation Protocol (Illumina, Part # 15044223, Rev. B) with Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase Nextera XT Index Kit V2 and sequencing using Illumina Miseq instrument (300 bp paired-end sequencing, Miseq v3). The resulting paired reads were trimmed (the last 30 bp of forward and 60 bp of reverse reads) and merged using USEARCH (Edgar, 2013) and primer sequences stripped off (sequences that did not contain the primer sequences were filtered out) using cutadapt⁠ (Martin, 2011). USEARCH pipeline was subsequently employed for quality filtering, finding unique sequences, generation of OTUs by clustering with 97% identity (UPARSE algorithm), and OTU-table generation. Taxonomy was assigned to OTUs using SINTAX (Edgar, 2016)⁠ and Silva LTPs v132 database (Yilmaz et al., 2014) containing 13,899 curated 16S ribosomal RNA sequences (taxonomic ranks below 80% USINTAX bootstrap confidence threshold measure were considered unclassified). OTU table was rarified without replacement to the sample with the minimal count of mapped reads (49869). Downstream analyses were carried out using Phyloseq package (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). Moreover, co-occurrence networks were inferred based on the microbial composition data and the abiotic parameters using CoNet App (v1.1.1 beta). OTUs with <0.1% relative abundance or presence in less than three samples were not included in the analysis. The following data and process parameters were included: concentrations of investigated extracellular metabolites, CO2, H2, and CH4 content, gas amount, lactate, and acetate concentrations in the feedstock. Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients were computed and p-values determined by bootstrapping (1000). If at least one method featured a coefficient below −0.8 or above 0.8, an edge connecting the corresponding OTUs or abiotic parameters and q-value after Benjamini-Hochberg correction <0.05 threshold after Benjamini-Hochberg correction was added to the network. The network was visualized and analyzed for topological features in Cytoscape software (v 3.7.1) (Shannon et al., 2003). Raw sequences obtained in this study were submitted to NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database and are available under BioProject ID PRJNA694955 (BioSample accessions SAMN18336565 -SAMN18336580)."
7,Results and discussion,"The carboxylates production along with the residual concentration of substrates (lactate and acetate) and the gas production during the process were presented in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively. In Fig. 4 the relationship between the caproate production and the lactate concentration in the feedstock during the process with external acetate (phase IV in B1, start-up phase and phases from I to III in B2) and without external acetate (start-up phase and phases from I to III in B1) was shown. Possible pathways and its stoichiometries were placed in Electronic Supplementary Material."
8,External acetate influenced the production of carboxylates from the beginning of the process,"3.1 External acetate influenced the production of carboxylates from the beginning of the process At the beginning of the process in B1, various carboxylates were produced with a chain length of 2 to 7 carbon atoms per molecule. The production of carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms per molecule (propionate, valerate and heptanoate) in B1 was predominant on days 14–36 (12.2 ± 2.2 mmol C/L/d) with a specificity of 61 ± 8%. Then, the production of caproate started to dominate and reached a value of 23.4 ± 1.3 mmol C/L/d on days 41–48 with a specificity of 63 ± 2%. In the meantime, the production of carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms per molecule decreased to 9.6 mmol C/L/d (specificity of 26%). In B2, the stabilization of caproate and butyrate production was observed already after 10 days of the start-up phase. The caproate and butyrate production on days 11–48 amounted to 29.1 ± 1.9 mmol C/L/d and 10.9 ± 2.4 mmol C/L/d, respectively. The acetate concentration in B2 on days 11–33 was 51.6 ± 9.7 mM, then it increased and at the end of the start-up phase it was 134.5 mM C. It is worth noting that carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms per molecule were not detected in B2. The volumetric amounts of gaseous products in B1 and B2 in the start-up phase were 286 ± 46 mL/d and 263 ± 43 mL/d, respectively. The gas mixture consisted of carbon dioxide (77 ± 6% in B1 and 79 ± 5% in B2) and methane (23 ± 6% in B1 and 21 ± 5% in B2). Acetoclastic methanogens should not be active in pH of 5.5 but methane could be also produced in the carboxylate platform by hydrogenotrophic methanogens which were identified in microbiome structure (Electronic Supplementary Material). Hydrogenotrophic methanogens generating methane from H2 and CO2 and chain elongators can be present simultaneously in the carboxylate platform because there is no direct competition for the substrate (Grootscholten et al., 2014). It is very challenging to control the metabolic pathways and final bioproducts in MCF (Oleskowicz-Popiel, 2018). The CE processes using mixed cultures of microorganisms are characterized by competition between chain elongators and propionate producers (Candry et al., 2020). Most of the studies focused on the lactate-based CE to caproate also showed the production of carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms in the molecule (Brodowski et al., 2020; Kucek et al., 2016a; Xu et al., 2018). However, the comparison of the results in the start-up phase between the B1 and B2 suggested that external acetate favored the production of carboxylates with an even number of carbon atoms in the molecule with the predominant caproate production. The lack of an external electron acceptor in the inflow to the B1 made it necessary to produce it directly from lactate. Acetate and propionate, which are electron acceptors in the CE, can be produced from lactate. Lactate can be oxidized to pyruvate with lactate dehydrogenase, then pyruvate can be further oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which can be finally converted to acetate. On the other hand, propionate can be also generated from lactate in the acrylate pathway with lactyl-CoA, acrylyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA as intermediates (Wu et al., 2019). These two metabolic pathways are competing with each other and the lack of an external electron acceptor may have triggered the activation of both competing pathways making the product spectrum more diverse in the B1. The microbiome structure analysis shed more light on the changes during the carboxylates production in the start-up phase of B1, as well as the differences between the carboxylates production in B1 and B2 (no carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms in B2). Microbes closely related to Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 and Acinetobacter were recognized as the dominant in periods of high caproate production. Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 was previously identified as a lactate-based chain elongator and caproate producer (Zhu et al., 2017) and Acinetobacter was functional microorganisms for the CE (He et al., 2018; Kucek et al., 2016a). At the beginning of the start-up phase (day 22) in B1, when the production of carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms in the molecule was predominant, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 and Acinetobacter were only 10.0% and 1.3%, respectively. However, at the end of the start-up phase (day 48), when caproate production had been already predominant, Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 and Acinetobacter dominated the microbiome structure, reaching relative abundances of 23.1% and 36.9%, respectively. Acetate and propionate compete for the same enzyme system in the CE process but with the acetate dominance (Roghair et al., 2018) which could explain the shift in the production trend towards caproate at the end of the start-up phase in the B1. For comparison, in the B2, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 and Acinetobacter was almost 50% in total already on the day 22, which may explain the phenomenon of predominant caproate production from the beginning of the process. Additionally, the presence of Propionibacterium capable of producing propionate was observed during the start-up phase only in the samples from B1 (the relative abundance was between 0.49%–0.55%; Electronic Supplementary Material), which could explain the production of carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms in the molecule only in the B1. However, the exact mechanism of complete propionate production inhibition in the process with external acetate remains elusive."
9,Lack of an external electron acceptor led to the occurrence of residual lactate and destabilization of the carboxylates production,"3.2 Lack of an external electron acceptor led to the occurrence of residual lactate and destabilization of the carboxylates production At the beginning of phase I in the B1 (lactate concentration in the feedstock increased to 600 mM C), a gradual increase in the caproate production to 33.7 mmol C/L/d was observed; however, at some point (day 54), the reduction in the caproate production was observed and reached 26.0 mmol C/L/d on day 60 along with the residual lactate accumulation. Then the residual lactate consumption from day 61 translated into an increase in the caproate and butyrate production. The production of caproate and butyrate stabilized on day 67 and by the end of the phase I it was equal to 43.5 ± 0.5 mmol C/L/d and 7.7 ± 0.4 mmol C/L/d, respectively. Stable caproate and butyrate production were not achieved in the phase II in B1. Caproate production increased to 60.2 mmol C/L/d on day 78 but then decreased to 38.8 mmol C/L/d on day 84 along with an accumulation of the residual lactate. At the end of the phase II, the caproate and butyrate production increased to 57.5 mmol C/L/d and 14.3 mmol C/L/d, respectively, due to the observed residual lactate consumption on days 84–87. The production of carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms in the molecule gradually decreased in the phases I and II and it was 4.6 mmol C/L/d at the end of the phase II with a specificity of 6%. Gas production in the B1 was stable (227 ± 34 mLCO2/d and 97 ± 15 mLCH4/d) until the lactate accumulation occurred. From day 55, no stable gas production was achieved in the phases I and II in the B1. The increase in lactate concentration in the feedstock in the phase III in the B1 resulted in periodic lactate accumulations combined with fluctuations in the carboxylates production. Three fluctuations were observed on days 89–99, 100–112 and 113–118, respectively. At the beginning of the phase III in the B1 a lactate overloading occurred (the residual lactate concentration increased up to 646.7 mM C on day 96) and the decrease in the caproate production from 65.8 mmol C/L/d (day 89) to 31.2 mmol C/L/d (day 97) was observed. Then the residual lactate consumption was observed and led to an increase in the caproate and butyrate production to 62.6 mmol C/L/d and 38.0 mmol C/L/d, respectively. On days 100–108, the caproate and butyrate production decreased to 37.7 mmol C/L/d and 8.5 mmol C/L/d, respectively, along with an increase in the residual lactate concentration to 699.9 mM C; however, the observed lactate consumption on days 109–112 led to another increase in the caproate and butyrate production to 68.6 mmol C/L/d and 43.4 mmol C/L/d, respectively. Another accumulation of the residual lactate and the decrease in carboxylates production were observed on days 113–118. Periodic carboxylates production and residual lactate accumulations also affected gas production. When an increase in the carboxylates production was observed, also a higher gas production was measured. No such repeatable fluctuations in the residual lactate concentrations and the carboxylates production were observed in another CE process with a continuous lactate overloading (Kucek et al., 2016a). These periodic fluctuations could be attributed to a low CE performance due to the lack of an electron acceptor (acetate). The recovery of the carboxylates (caproate and butyrate) production was always observed after a slight accumulation of acetate (Fig. 2) and an increase in acetate accumulation affected high CE performance. Thus, herein the main limiting factor for CE was the limited availability of an electron acceptor. Moreover, in our study the residual lactate did not activate propionate production as it was previously observed (Kucek et al., 2016a). Some species are able to convert lactate to propionate via the acrylate pathway which can outcompete the acetyl-CoA formation under conditions of excess lactate (Prabhu et al., 2012), but also in the first fed-batch bioconversion of lactate to caproate authors did not report propionate production despite continued lactate excess (Zhu et al., 2015). Recent studies showed that a lower pH (5.0 and 5.5) favored the CE process, and chain elongators may be outcompeted by the propionate producers at pH above 6; however, it has been also suggested that pH was not solely responsible for community changes and the competition between chain elongators and propionate producers (Candry et al., 2020). Thus, the activation of the acrylate pathway is likely to be influenced by the unique composition of the microbial culture (Kucek et al., 2016a) and not always residual lactate may lead to the activation of this metabolic pathway. Interestingly, although no increased production of propionate was triggered, Propionibacterium was observed in B1 during lactate overloading (the relative abundance was between 0.44%–1.12%; Electronic Supplementary Material)."
10,Shifted lactate overloading limit in B2: stable caproate and hydrogen co-production,"3.3 Shifted lactate overloading limit in B2: stable caproate and hydrogen co-production Increasing the lactate concentration in feedstock in the phase I and phase II by 50% resulted in increases in the caproate production by 57% and 64%, respectively, despite the constant butyrate production and constant acetate presence in the bioreactor. The caproate production stabilized in the phase I and phase II at 45.8 ± 1.3 mmol C/L/d (days 57–72) and 75.3 ± 2.5 mmol C/L/d (days 80–88), respectively. Throughout both phases (days 49–88), the production of butyrate (16.7 ± 1.2 mmol C/L/d), as well as the concentration of acetate (119.8 ± 5.8 mM C) did not change significantly. The production of gases (CO2 and CH4) in the phase I and II was stable and amounted to 264 ± 28 mLCO2/d, 86 ± 10 mLCH4/d and 333 ± 43 mLCO2/d, 97 ± 13 mLCH4/d, respectively. No appearance of the residual lactate was noticed, although the lactate concentration in feedstock in the phases I and II in the B2 was the same as in the phases I and II in the B1. Lactate accumulation was first observed in the B2 in the phase III. The maximum lactate concentration was 603.3 mM C and corresponded to the lowest caproate production in this phase (51.0 mmol C/L/d). On day 98, consumption of the residual lactate began, which resulted in an increase in the caproate production. The residual lactate concentration dropped to 180.5 mM C on day 107 and remained at the level of 179.5–315.5 mM C until the end of the process. Despite the presence of the residual lactate, the caproate production stabilized at 71.7 ± 2.4 mmol C/L/d on days 101–140. Along with the stable caproate production recovery, the production of hydrogen in the bioreactor was observed and amounted to 213 ± 30 mLH2/d on days 108–140. Shifting the lactate overloading limit (compared to B1) was possible due to the presence of an external electron acceptor, as the carboxylates' production was dependent on the lactate concentration in the feedstock. In comparison, the limiting factor in the B1 was an availability of an electron acceptor, which had to be produced directly from the lactate and it caused the carboxylates' production fluctuations already in the phases II and III. After reaching the lactate overloading in the phase III in B2, the caproate production, although stabilized despite the presence of residual lactate, was slightly lower than in the previous phase (Fig. 4). Lactate concentration in the feedstock conditioned the increase in the caproate production in the B2 until the residual lactate occurred. Thus, the external acetate rather affected the process stabilization than the CE efficiency. Interestingly, the production of hydrogen was observed in the B2 only under the lactate overloading conditions. Lactate-based CE reactions involve the release of hydrogen (Wu et al., 2019), however, if the reaction is coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, produced hydrogen is immediately used (Duber et al., 2018; Grootscholten et al., 2014). In our previous work, hydrogen was also undetectable in the gas mixture (unlike methane) until HRT was shortened, which led to the inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and enabled hydrogen production (Brodowski et al., 2020). Moreover, recent studies showed that hydrogen could be used as a co-electron donor for the CE in the MCF (Baleeiro et al., 2021), as well as for the short-chain carboxylates production as precursors for the caproate production (González-Tenorio et al., 2020). It is possible that in our study, the sufficiently high lactate consumption led to the production of excess and non-consumed hydrogen which resulted in the hydrogen accumulation. In other studies, high organic loading rate also was recognized as an important factor for a successful lactate-driven hydrogen production (García-Depraect et al., 2019b)."
11,The addition of external acetate to lactate-overloaded B1: carboxylates production recovery and hydrogen co-production,"3.4 The addition of external acetate to lactate-overloaded B1: carboxylates production recovery and hydrogen co-production The increase in lactate conversion, as well as changes in the carboxylates and gas production were observed as a result of the addition of external acetate in the B1 in the phase IV. The decrease in residual lactate concentration to 117.1 mM C occurred at the beginning of the phase IV, then the residual lactate concentration was stable at 102.5 ± 2.9 mM C on days 122–125. From day 126 until the end of the process, the residual lactate was not present in the bioreactor. Stable caproate production in the phase IV was recovered and averaged 68.9 ± 2.2 mmol C/L/d on days 121–140. At the same time, the acetate concentration in the bioreactor stabilized at 30.6 ± 4.0 mM C (days 121–140). Changes in the lactate conversion also affected the butyrate production. A consumption of the residual lactate at the beginning of the process translated into an increase in butyrate production from 18.9 mmol C/L/d to 44.4 mmol C/L/d. Then, on days 122–125, a stabilization of the butyrate production was observed (44.2 ± 0.9 mmol C/L/d). From day 126, the butyrate production gradually increased and reached 64.3 mmol C/L/d on day 139. Tao et al. (2016), in studies with the newly isolated Clostridium cluster XIVa bacterium from the production of Chinese strong-flavored liquor, noticed that the external acetate may increase the lactate conversion at low pH. It was suggested that an external acetate addition may induce the expression of solventogenic enzymes, leading to an increased utilization of lactate and butyrate production. The effect of acetate on the increased activity of certain enzymes (coenzyme A transferase, acetate kinase and butyrate kinase) was also observed in studies with Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 (Chen and Blaschek, 1999). Moreover, the use of an external electron acceptor may allow chain elongators to accumulate more ATP, thereby stimulating the CE (Contreras-Dávila et al., 2021). As previously mentioned, hydrogen production is related to the CE performance, however, it can be completely consumed by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens and used as a co-electron donor for the CE. A slight hydrogen production was observed in the phase II (up to 31 mLH2/d) and also in the phase III (up to 145 mLH2/d). However, the addition of an external acetate in the phase IV caused the total lactate consumption and as a result, a high hydrogen production was observed, which on days 121–140 averaged 748 ± 76 mLH2/d and accounted for about 41% of the total gas production. Moreover, a complete inhibition of methanogenesis was observed from day 123. Recent studies showed that high acetate concentrations may favor acidogens and the CE over methanogens (Cavalcante et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018) thereby the addition of an external acetate resulted in an acetate accumulation which could have an impact on the methanogenesis inhibition. Interestingly, the production of hydrogen and butyrate in the phase IV in the B1 and the phase III in the B2, despite the use of the same medium and operating parameters, was different. It can be a result of a different lactate consumption in both bioreactors. The microbiome in the B1, accustomed and adapted to operating with an excess lactate from day 54, achieved a higher lactate conversion efficiency which resulted in a higher production of butyrate and hydrogen than in the B2."
12,Summary of the effects of an external acetate on the lactate-based CE,"3.5 Summary of the effects of an external acetate on the lactate-based CE Based on the results, the influence of an external acetate on the lactate-based carboxylate platform is presented in Fig. 5 . The lack of an external acetate resulted in a variation in the carboxylates production at the beginning of the CE process (start-up phase, B1), as well as the need for electron acceptor generation directly from lactate, which made the CE process more sensitive to changes in lactate loading rates (the increase in lactate concentration in the feedstock resulted in the destabilization of carboxylates production; phases I – II, B1). Continuous lactate overloading of the process with lactate as a sole carbon source led to fluctuations in the carboxylates production dependent on the access (accumulation) of acetate (phase III, B1). The addition of an external acetate resulted in the residual lactate consumption and restored stable caproate production along with a stable hydrogen co-production occurrence (phase IV, B1). The lactate overloading phenomenon may pose a major challenge in future lactate-based carboxylate platforms. To avoid overloading, during the two-stage fermentation of acid whey to caproate, Xu et al. (2018) diluted the lactate-rich influent, but such actions may reduce the economic viability of the bioprocess. Herein, an effective method of recovering stable caproate production in lactate-based CE is provided – the use of an external acetate source. In the lactate-based CE process with an external acetate, carboxylates with an even number of carbon atoms in the molecule were favored and the caproate production increased along with an increase in the lactate loading rate until the residual lactate occurred. Caproate production stabilized under continuous overloading conditions, however, its production was slightly lower in comparison to the previous phase with a lower lactate loading rate. Thus, the concentration of the electron donor in the inflow determined the effectiveness of the CE until reaching the limit value above which the lactate overloading appeared. Hydrogen co-production was only observed under high lactate consumption conditions. We presumed that the hydrogen produced in the earlier phases was immediately consumed by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens or could have been used as an a co-electron donor in the CE. Summing up, the access to the external acetate (electron acceptor) ensured the stabilization of the CE process and its lack was a limiting factor for the lactate-based CE. However, the access to an external acetate caused only a slight increase in caproate production (Fig. 4) and a slight decrease in the lactate consumption per one mole of produced caproate. For comparison, in the phase I, 5.24 mol of lactate were required to produce 1 mol of caproate in the process with external acetate, while 5.52 mol of lactate were needed in the process without external acetate, which only resulted in a 5% lower lactate requirement per one mole of produced caproate. Similarly, in the batch tests with isolated Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, the addition of external acetate caused a decrease from 4.29 to 3.83 mol of consumed lactate per 1 mol of produced caproate (decrease of about 11%) (Zhu et al., 2017). It is therefore desirable for the lactate-based CE process to provide access to acetate as an electron acceptor to avoid production fluctuations, however, the effectiveness of the CE is more dependent on the lactate (electron donor) loading rate."
13,Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 and Acinetobacter were the dominant microbes throughout the process,"3.6 Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 and Acinetobacter were the dominant microbes throughout the process In total, 847,773 reads from 17 samples analyzed by amplicon sequencing were assigned to 118 OTUs. The quality of the microbial analysis pipeline was evaluated using a mock community sample. Despite the use of Gram-positive-enabled DNA extraction protocol, certain positive biases can be observed for certain Gram-negative genera like Listeria and Escherichia (Electronic Supplementary Material). OTUs in a sample feature table were affiliated to 34 families and 54 genera, Methanobacteriaceae being the only representative family of Archaea. After the adaptation, the dominating genera were distinctly different from those in the inoculum, which indicates the conditions in our reactors were selective. The succession of microbial composition is presented in Fig. 6 . In contrast to the strong community shifts during the initial phases of the fermentations in both bioreactors, data points representing microbial communities sampled after 70 days are less scattered in the NMDS plot. This indicates lower dissimilarity of the community structures within that period. Representative sequences from the two most abundant OTUs, unclassified with selected confidence threshold (0.8) against Silva LTPs v132 database – Otu2 and Otu3 (Table S1) were subsequently subjected to comparison with NCBI 16S ribosomal RNA and NCBI nucleotide collection databases using online BLAST with default parameters (Altschul et al., 1990). When compared with NCBI nucleotide collection close relation to several Ruminococcaceae bacteria was revealed (representative sequences of Otu2 and Otu3 exhibit 100% and 97% identity, respectively, with 16S RNA gene sequences of Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6). Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 was previously identified as a powerful workhorse for a highly-efficient caproic acid production from lactate-containing waste streams (Zhu et al., 2017). Although representative sequences from Otu2 and Otu3 share 96,77% identity, Otu3 is not observed in bioreactor B2, suggesting they originate from two separate, albeit highly related microorganisms. Overall, OTUs assigned to taxa related to Acinetobacter and Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 were dominant in both bioreactors (Fig. 7 ), with the exception of the samples from the 22nd day, where 75.9% and 36.8% reads mapped to OTUs affiliated with Acetobacter genus, for B1 and B2, respectively. At the end of the start-up phase (day 48), the relative abundance of reads mapped to Acetobacter OTUs decreased to 9.2% in B1 and 11.7% in B2, and then at the end of the phase I (day 72) their relative abundance in both bioreactors was less than 1%, which lasted until the end of the processes. On days 48, 72 and 88 in B1, the relative abundances of reads mapping to Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 OTUs were 23.1%, 26.6% and 59.1%, respectively, while the abundances of Acinetobacter reads were 36.9%, 37.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. The lowest relative abundance of mapped to OTUs corresponding to Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 (8.3%) along with the highest relative abundance of Acinetobacter reads (65.3%) in the B1 was observed at the end of the phase III (day 118). This corresponded to a period of continuous lactate overloading and fluctuations in caproate production. However, when sampled at the peak (day 107) and bottom (day 112) of fluctuating residual lactate concentration in phase III, only little change in the abundance of dominant microbes was observed. Recovering stability of caproate production with hydrogen co-production by adding external acetate in the phase IV in the B1 led to the observation of the maximum relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 reads of 76.7% on day 140. The relative abundance of reads mapping to Otu3 and Acinetobacter in the B2 was between 23.9%–47.7% and 12.8%–58.1%, respectively. The highest relative abundance (47.7%) of Otu3 in the B2 was observed at the end of the process during the co-production of hydrogen and caproate with the presence of residual lactate in the bioreactor. No Megasphaera elsdenii, which was previously recognized as the main butyrate and caproate producer from lactate (De Groof et al., 2019; Prabhu et al., 2012), was found in the microbiome structure. Moreover, in another study of continuous lactate to caproate conversion, the absence of M. elsdenii was also observed and Acinetobacter spp. was predominant during the phase of high caproate productivity (Kucek et al., 2016a). Additionally, Acinetobacter spp. was found in other CE systems, i.e. with xylose as a feedstock (Qian et al., 2020), in the CO-based CE process (He et al., 2018) and ethanol-based CE process (Kucek et al., 2016b). A small relative abundance (0.01%–1.12%) of reads mapping to OTUs related to Propionibacterium, capable of propionate production, was also observed in the B1 samples. This can explain the greater variation in the spectrum of produced carboxylates. In the B2, they were only detected in samples B2d118 and B2d140 with 0.04% and 0.11% mapped reads, respectively. Moreover, we have constructed a correlation network to analyze the co-occurrences among microbial taxa and process parameters with the aim to reveal potential functions and ecological interactions within the microbial community in both bioreactors (Fig. 8 ). Co-occurrences between pairs of taxa may suggest bacterial cooperation such as mutualism (Faust and Raes, 2012). In our bioreactors, the inferred network consisted mainly of two sub-network modules. The first is related to the concentration of lactate in the feedstock, negatively correlated with a number of unclassified OTUs with various abundance. The second module consists of co-occurring bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Nocardiaceae family, Acinetobacter, highly connected Brevundimonas and Brucellaceae, Microbacteriaceae and others. While the exact function of this bacterial cluster remains unknown it is significantly correlated with the residual lactate concentration in this study. Moreover, we identified more co-relations, such as the co-occurring Microbacterium and Sedimentibacter. The presence of these microorganisms can be observed in microbial composition data from other chain elongation systems (Liu et al., 2020a; Qian et al., 2020). According to our analysis, the external acetate (acetate in the feedstock), as well as acetate concentration in the bioreactor is not significantly correlated with the change of any microbial species. This indicates the influence of acetate on the process may be more thermodynamic in nature rather than related to the kinetic competition of microbes for the substrate. The concentration of caproate and butyrate was found positively correlated with the presence of Otu3. This observation and the abundance of reads mapping to Otu2 and Otu3 with close homology to Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6 previously associated with efficient lactate-based caproic acid production, suggested that Ruminococcaceae were primary chain elongators in the investigated process. No microbes previously implicated in biohydrogen production from lactate and acetate such as C. acetobutylicum, C. tyrobutyricum, C. beijerinckii and B. methylotrophicum (Wu et al., 2012) were identified in this study. However, it has been recently investigated (Liu et al., 2020c) that chain elongation core-genome harbors genes involved not only in the reverse β-oxidation and energy conservation but also the hydrogen formation. Genes related to hydrogen formation are present in Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, similarly to other validated chain-elongating strains (Liu et al., 2020b). This includes energy-converting hydrogenase (Ech complex), which was proposed to generate hydrogen for maintaining the cytoplasmic redox balance caused by the oxidation of ferredoxin (Schuchmann and Müller, 2014). Hydrogen production is therefore likely to be related to energy conservation mechanisms in these bacteria and the excess of reducing equivalents obtained from lactate oxidation to acetyl-CoA."
14,Conclusions,"For the first time, the effect of an external electron acceptor (acetate) on the lactate-based chain elongation in a continuously fed bioreactor was tested. The external acetate addition favored the production of carboxylates with an even number of carbon atoms in the molecule with predominant caproate production. We confirmed that lactate overloading in the process with lactate as a sole carbon source destabilized carboxylates production. In contrast to the selected previous study (Kucek et al., 2016a), long-term overloading did not result in propionate production, but periodic fluctuations in caproate and butyrate production dependent on acetate (electron acceptor) accumulation. The efficient method of stable caproate production in the lactate-based carboxylate platform has been demonstrated – the use acetate as an external electron acceptor. High hydrogen co-production was observed only under high lactate loading rate and with the external acetate addition. All microbes necessary for chain elongation from lactate (such as Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6) were enriched in both bioreactors. The presence of external acetate did not affect much the microbial composition of CE microbiome. However, two sub-networks of co-occurring bacteria either positively or negatively responding to residual lactate concentration were identified."
