0,Introduction,"In the last decades, lignocellulosic wastes have been pointed as a key for the development of a sustainable economy, since biomass is the only renewable raw material oil-like potential for organic molecules production [1]. Lignocellulosic biomass can produce many renewable platform molecules. Among them, γ-valerolactone (GVL) obtained by hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) is a stable and low toxic molecule that has great applicability, which can be used in the production of liquid fuels, as an intermediate in the synthesis of fine chemicals and directly as solvent, food ingredient, flavoring agent, oxygenated gasoline additive [2,3]. The hydrogenation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone has been performed in gaseous or liquid phase in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts at 100 - 270 °C, using high H2 pressures (30 - 150 bar) [1,4]. Few studies in the literature have been dedicated to the continuous hydrogenation of LA [5–8] and most of them perform the reaction in the gas phase [9–11] or use noble metals-based catalysts [12,13]. The main advantage of gas phase reaction is the continuous production of GVL, but the high energy consumption required to vaporize the levulinic acid makes this approach not very attractive. In this sense, it is more interesting to carried out the reaction in liquid phase [3]. In general, the conversion of levulinic acid in liquid phase can be performed using three different sources of hydrogen: molecular hydrogen provided by an external source; hydrogen formed in situ by the decomposition of formic acid or by Meerwein - Ponndorf - Varley reaction (MPV) using alcohols. The use of formic acid would be a highly attractive alternative since this compound is produced in equimolar amounts to LA during the acid hydrolysis of cellulose. However, in this case, higher reaction temperatures should be used for both decomposition of formic acid (H2 + CO2) and subsequent conversion of LA [14]. For MPV reaction, mild reaction conditions (boiling point of alcohol and under an ambient pressure) are required to LA conversion, however by-products of the transesterification process decrease the selectivity to GVL. Then, the hydrogenation of LA to GVL has been extensively studied using molecular hydrogen and heterogeneous catalysts, with the main advantage the easy separation of liquid products [15]. Although precious metals exhibit better performance for the hydrogenation of LA, the commercial use of these materials is not advantageous and, therefore, they must be replaced. Nickel is a low-cost metal used industrially for hydrogenation, methanation and steam reforming reactions [16]. Due to its hydrogenation capacity, several nickel-based catalysts have already been tested in the reduction of levulinic acid [8,17–23]. In general, these catalysts are actives to hydrogenate the LA but suffer deactivation mainly due to leaching or sintering. The occurance of leaching required metal recovery from the solution and can generate toxic waste depending on its solubility, valence state and particle size [24]. Therefore, the appropriate catalyst for LA hydrogenation has to be inexpensive as well as stable under the liquid medium. Hengst et al. [8] tested several Ni/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by different methods in the aqueous hydrogenation of LA at 200 °C and 50 bar. The best performance was observed for 5 % Ni/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by wet impregnation method, which resulted in smaller nickel particle size. However, catalyst deactivated after 4 h of reaction due to the sintering of Ni particles as a result of weaker metal-support interactions by the transformation of γ–Al2O3. The promotion in the stability of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts was achieved by switching from water solvent to dioxane (180 °C and 30 bar) [21]. Although dioxane improves the stability of nickel catalysts, the use of this solvent is not recommended since it is carcinogenic [25]. Nickel-based N-doped multi-chambered mesoporous carbon microspheres (Ni@NCMs) were prepared by Liu et al. [17] as a strategy to control the nickel particle size during the LA hydrogenation reaction (200 °C, 30 bar, dioxane). This catalyst exhibited excellent activity and improved stability compared to Ni/Cactivated catalyst. The catalyst was stable after six runs (4 h). Meanwhile, Mai et al. [7] observed an improvement in the performance of molybdenum carbides (Mo2C) when supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT) compared to activated carbon (AC). The authors reported that the support plays a key role in the activity and stability of the molybdenum carbide, particularly, when the nanoparticles are positioned within the carbon nanotubes. The high performance of the Mo2C/CNT catalyst was comparable to the Ru/C catalyst for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL at same reaction condition. In this way, the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as support can also favor the stability of Ni-based catalysts due to its known confinement effect [26,27]. Carbon nanotubes are formed by graphene sheets rolled into a cylindrical shape. This geometry promotes a difference in electronic potential caused by a displacement of the π electron density from the internal to the external cavity, which results in different chemical properties and reactivities by the molecules and nanomaterials located inside the nanotubes [28–30]. It seems that the space restriction of the metal particles in carbon nanotubes contributes to avoid sintering and favors the metallic dispersion in catalysts [31]. In addition, it was observed in some works [26,32,33] that when the metal particles are confined within the nanotubes they are more easily reduced in comparison to the particles located in the carbon nanotubes outer surface. Furthermore, CNTs exhibit high mechanical resistance and thermal stability [34]. The use of carbon nanotubes as support for nickel catalysts has been studied for many reactions: methane dry reforming [26], hydrogenation of benzene [27], fenol [35], furfural [36], hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol [37], CO methanation [38], methane decomposition [39], biomass pyrolysis [40], reduction of aromatic nitro compounds [41]. Despite the advantages of Ni confinement in the CNT, no study has yet been carried out on the levulinic acid hydrogenation reaction. Thus, the aim of the present work is to investigate the performance of Ni supported on CNT for hydrogenation of LA. The effect of different nickel precursors salts (nickel nitrate, acetate and hydroxide) on the Ni particle size and on the positioning of nickel particles on the carbon nanotubes was evaluated. Two different synthesis methods were used to drive the location of the metal particles toward the inside or outside of the CNT."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Commercial carbon nanotubes were used as support to prepare Ni catalysts. The carbon nanotubes (purity > 95 %, external diameter of 9.5 nm and internal diameter of 5 nm, pore volume =2.81 cm³ g-1) were provided by Nanocyl. Prior to the synthesis of catalysts, the CNTs were dried overnight at 110 °C. All the nickel catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation method using an appropriate amount of nickel solution to achieve 10 (wt.) % of nickel. The precursors of nickel were: nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, Vetec), nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2.4H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2, Sigma-Aldrich). The first two salts were solubilized in water and the last one, in a mixture of water and nitric acid (HNO3, Vetec), since it was not soluble in pure water. In order to prepare 10 g of catalyst (10 % Ni), the concentrations of the metal precursors in the impregnating solutions were: 4.34 mol L-1 of aqueous solution of nickel nitrate; 0.62 mol L-1 of aqueous solution of nickel acetate; 2.12 mol L-1 of acid solution of nickel hydroxide. The Ni catalysts were prepared in order to obtain Ni particles located inside or outside the CNTs. For the preparation of catalysts with nickel particles inside the CNT channels (denoted as CNTIN), several impregnation and drying steps were carried out depending on the metal precursor: 3, 4 and 10 steps for the catalysts prepared with nickel nitrate, nickel hydroxide and nickel acetate, respectively. After the impregnation, the samples were dried overnight at 110 °C. To prepare catalysts with nickel particles located preferentially on the CNT outer walls (denoted as CNTOUT), p-xylene (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to fill the pore of nanotube before nickel solution impregnation. In this case, a larger number of impregnation/drying steps were carried out compared to CNTIN catalysts (7 steps for nickel nitrate, 9 steps for nickel hydroxide and 25 steps nickel acetate). After the impregnation, the samples were dried overnight at 150 °C to evaporate the p-xylene, according to Pan and Bao [42]. All the samples were treated at 300 °C (5 °C min-1) for 5 h under flow of He (50 mL min-1). The catalysts were designated as Nix/CNTy where x corresponds to the precursor salt used (nitrate-NIT, hydroxide-HYD, acetate-ACET), and Y, the desired nickel particles position (inside-IN, outside-OUT)."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The chemical composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a SPECTRO ARCOS ICP-OES instrument. The samples digestion was carried out by alkaline fusion with lithium tetraborate, followed by dissolution with nitric acid. The solutions resulting from the digestions were used for analysis in duplicate. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured by nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. The treated samples were previously outgassed under vacuum at 200 °C for 18 h. The specific areas were estimated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (B.E.T.) method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of support and catalysts (dried, treated and reduced) were performed using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer employing a Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.542 Å). The diffractograms were obtained over a 2θ range of 10-90° at a scan rate of 0.02°/step and a scan time of 1 s/step. The crystallite diameters (Dc) of metallic Ni were estimated by Scherrer equation using the line characteristic of Ni0 (2 0 0) at 2θ = 51.8º and considering that the particles have a spherical geometry (shape factor equal to 0.9). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a HITACHI STA 7300 equipment. For that, about 5 mg of sample were heated up to 1000 °C (5 °C min-1) in an atmosphere of N2 (80 mL min-1). The decomposition of the different nickel salts was evaluated by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) in a multipurpose unit coupled to a Pfeiffer Vacuum mass spectrometer (MS) model QME 200. The dried catalysts (0.1 g) were heated in a flow of He (50 mL min-1) up to 800 °C (5 °C min-1). The signals of the ions m/z = 2 (H2), 4 (He), 12 (C), 14 (N or C2H2O), 15 (CH4), 16 (O), 17 (OH), 18 (H2O), 25 (C2H4), 28 (CO or N2), 30 (NO), 31 (C2H6O), 32 (O2), 37 (C3H4), 44 (CO2), 46 (NO2 or CH2O2), 58 (C3H6O), 56 (C4H8) and 60 (C2H4O2) were continuously monitored on the mass spectrometer. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) were performed in the same multipurpose system used for TPD analysis. Before reduction, the treated catalysts (0.1 g) were heated under He (50 mL min-1) at 150 °C (10 °C min-1) for 1 h and then cooled to 30 °C. The He was replaced by pure H2 (100 mL min-1). After that, temperature was increased until 800 °C (5 °C min-1) and the H2O signal (m/z = 18) was measured at the spectrometer. The density of exposed Ni sites of the catalysts was measured by CO chemisorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020C equipment and the double isotherm method. Before the analysis, the catalysts (0.1 g) were pretreated at 150 °C (10 °C min-1) for 1 h in He (30 mL min-1) and then reduced with H2 (30 mL min-1) at 400 °C (5 °C min-1, for 1 h) to obtain the metallic nickel phase. The catalyst’s surface was cleaned under vacuum and the CO chemisorption was performed at 30 °C. For that, it was assumed a stoichiometry of one CO per surface Ni. The morphological analysis, the particle size distribution and determination of mean particle size was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The images were obtained using the Tecnai G20 FEG microscope operating at 200 kV. The samples were previously reduced with pure H2 (200 mL min-1) at 400 °C for 1 h and passivated with 0.5 % O2/N2 for 18 h. Then, the catalysts were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol for 50 minutes and finally dropped onto a Lacey carbon grid, which was taken to analysis. The Ni diameters of 300 particles were counted using AxioVision software."
4,Catalytic experiments,"2.3 Catalytic experiments The hydrogenation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone was carried out in an automatic continuous-flow trickled bed reactor (Microactivity Efficient, from PID Eng & Tech) at 180 °C and 30 bar of H2 for 6 h. The stainless steel tubular reactor of 9 mm of internal diameter and 195 mm in length was coupled to the unit. Preliminary tests were performed to ensure that external and internal transfer limitations were eliminated under the conditions employed. The catalyst bed was packed in the reactor between two layers of quartz wool, and the powder catalyst (0.3 g, 200 mesh) was diluted with inert material, SiC (150-270 mesh, mcatalyst/mSiC = 1/5) to avoid hot spots. Prior to each catalytic test, the nickel catalyst was reduced in situ with pure H2 (200 mL min-1) at 400 °C (5 °C min-1) for 1 h. The reactant mixture was composed of 5 (wt.) % of levulinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 98 % pure) in distilled water and 0.13 % (wt) of 1.4-dioxane (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8 % pure) used as an internal standard. Each catalyst was evaluated using a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1 h-1. The post-reaction collected liquid samples were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry – GCMS (Agilent – 7890-5975C model) and a flame-ionization detector (FID) using a VF-WaxMs column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm). The levulinic acid conversion (XLA) was calculated using the following equation: X L A % = A L A A D I O X 0 - A L A A D I O X t A L A A D I O X 0 x 100 where ALA is the chromatographic area of LA (a.u.), ADIOX is the chromatographic area of dioxane (a.u.), 0 corresponds to the beginning of the reaction and t at any time."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 Dry catalysts Before treatment step, all dry Ni/CNT samples were analyzed by XRD, TGA and TPD-MS to outline the best treatment conditions. Fig. 1 describes the diffractograms of all dry catalysts. The characteristic diffraction lines of the CNTs at 26.0, 43.3, 54.5 and 78.9o corresponding to (0 0 2), (1 0 0), (0 0 4) and (0 0 6) planes appeared in all diffractograms the intensity of these lines was approximately the same for all samples, which suggests that the graphene sheets of the supports have not been destroyed after Ni impregnation procedure. The diffractogram of the NiACET/CNTIN sample (Fig. 1 (a)) did not show any diffraction lines other than the support, while diffraction lines of nickel nitrate hydroxide hydrate (Ni2(NO3)2(OH)2.2H2O) (2θ= 10.9; 13.5 and 16.4oº; JCPDS 27-0952) were observed for the NiNIT/CNTIN and NiHYD/CNTIN samples. In the case of NiHYD/CNTIN, the formation of nickel nitrate hydroxide hydrate phase was due to the dissolution of the nickel hydroxide salt in nitric acid solution. Identical diffractograms were obtained for materials prepared with Ni particles outside the CNT (Fig. 1). It is also detected lines of small intensity at 2θ = 38 and 44° on the diffractograms of the samples prepared with nitrate and hydroxide precursors, which corresponds to NiOOH (JCPDS 27-0956) and Ni2O3 (JCPDS 40-1179) phases, respectively. The decomposition of Ni precursors was studied by the thermogravimetry (DTG curves, Fig. 2 ) and temperature programmed decomposition coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (TPD-QMS, Fig. S1-3) in inert gas flow. In general, the mass loss profiles of Ni/CNTIN samples are similar to those obtained for Ni/CNTOUT samples, thus the TPD-QMS analyses were carried out only for Ni/CNTIN samples. Table S1 (in the Supporting Information) lists the percentages of mass lost at different temperature range obtained by TG analyses for each sample. The DTG curves of NiNit/CNT and NiHyd/CNT samples, as well as the signal evolution of m/z ions are identical, indicating the same decomposition kinetics of samples prepared with nickel nitrate or nickel hydroxide salts, due to the presence of the same precursor in both samples, as revealed by XRD. The decomposition of nickel nitrate hydroxide hydrate was confirmed by the release of nitrogen oxides (NO, m/z = 30 and NO2, m/z = 46) and H2O (m/z = 18) around 200 - 300 °C. The release of O2 (m/z = 32) at 211 and 268 °C also indicates the parallel decomposition of nickel oxide (Ni2O3) to NiO. Brockner et al. [43] proposed the thermal decomposition reaction of Ni2(NO3)2(OH)2.2H2O by thermogravimetry and FT-Raman techniques. For NiACET/CNT samples, the DTG curves exhibits an asymmetric peak around 300 - 311 °C. The TPD-QMS data (Fig. S3) showed the evolution of several gases that comes from decomposition of the acetate group [44,45]: H2O (m/z = 18), CO (m/z = 28), C2H5OH (ethanol, m/z = 31), CO2 (m/z = 44), C2H2O (formic acid, m/z = 46), C3H6O (acetone, m/z = 58), CH3COOH (acetic acid, m/z = 60). For all catalysts, the significant mass loss observed above 500 °C is attributed to oxidation of nanotubes, which is confirmed by simultaneous production of H2 (m/z = 2), CO (m/z = 28) and CO2 (m/z = 44). These peaks are attributed to decomposition of oxygenated groups present on the surface of CNT [46]. Thus, to preserve the structure of the CNTs and to promote total decomposition of the Ni salts, the temperature chosen for the treatment step was 300 °C (for 5 h). 3.1.2 Treated Samples Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the Ni treated catalysts. From ICP analysis, Ni loading of catalysts is close to the nominal values (10 wt. %), except for NiNIT/CNTIN (7.6 wt. %). All N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (not shown), including pure CNTs, are type IV, typical of mesoporous materials, according to the IUPAC. The catalysts exhibited similar specific surface areas between 294 and 322 m2 g-1, higher than pure CNTs (287 m2 g-1). The increase in the specific surface area of treated samples indicates that the formation of acids (HNO3 and CH3COOH) during the decomposition of precursor salts promote the opening of ends of the tube or the creation of defects on the sidewall of nanotubes, as it happens for nanotubes treated with nitric acid [26,47,48]. The water formation profiles of treated nickel catalysts obtained during TPR are reported in Fig. 3 . All catalysts exhibited two major peaks in the ranges of 200 - 350 °C and 500 - 600 °C, where the first one is attributed to the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni, and the second, the less intense peak, is assigned to the reduction of NiO in strong interaction with support, that happens concomitantly with CNT gasification [26,27]. In general, temperatures larger than 500 °C are not recommended to be used for any supported transition metal, when CNTs are the supports since its methanation is favored in this condition [49]. In the present work, the profiles of CH4 formation (ion sign m/z = 15) during the reduction were also monitored (Fig. S4), confirming the formation of this compound by gasification of the CNT at temperatures close to 500 °C for all nickel catalysts. Thus to avoid that, the temperature of 400 °C was chosen to reduce nickel catalysts. According to the literature, the nickel reducibility can be influenced by both the size of nanoparticles and the nature of the support [26,37] and different TPR profiles are obtained depending on the position of the metallic particle on CNT [26,32,33]. In our work, the NiACET/CNTIN and NiHYD/CNTIN catalysts showed higher reduction temperature (around 290 °C) than the other sample prepared with nickel nitrate salt (NiNIT/CNTIN, around 250 °C). The three peaks observed at 270, 291 and 317 °C for NiACET/CNTIN catalyst suggest the presence of nickel species with different forces of interaction with the support. For Ni/CNTOUT catalysts, the water formation profiles for NiNIT/CNTOUT and NiHYD/CNTOUT samples showed maximum around 250 °C, while the NiACET/CNTOUT catalyst exhibited a peak at higher reduction temperature (310 °C) and without the presence of “shoulders”, which suggests a better homogeneity in the size of the NiO particles in comparison to NiACET/CNTIN. The reduction degree of the catalysts determined by integrating the water formation peak (from 200 to 350 °C) is shown in Table 1. NiNIT/CNT and NiHYD/CNT (IN and OUT) showed a complete reduction of the nickel oxide, whereas the NiACET/CNT (IN and OUT) catalyst had a reduction degree of only 40 %, indicating that the type of the precursor salt influences the reducibility of Ni species. However, comparing the reduction profiles of catalysts with Ni loaded inside and outside CNTs, no significant difference was observed, which is likely due to the similar particle distribution inside/outside the CNT for the IN and OUT samples, as it will be discussed later with the TEM results. According to the literature [26,27,32,33], it is expected that catalysts with metallic particles inside the nanotubes will have a decrease in the reduction temperature due the electron deficient inner concave surface of carbon nanotubes, which interacts more strongly with the anionic oxygen of NiO, weakening the Ni-O bond. X-ray diffraction patterns of treated samples show, again, identical results for materials prepared with Ni particles inside (Ni/CNTIN) or outside (Ni/CNTOUT) the CNT (Fig. 4 ). However, the type of nickel precursor leads to the formation of different Ni species on the catalysts. The NiNIT/CNT and NiHYD/CNT catalysts exhibited lines characteristic of NiO phase (2θ = 37.2, 43.2, 62.8 and 79.3o) (JCPDS 44-1159), while the NiACET/CNT catalyst showed the lines corresponding to a mixture of phases: NiO (JCPDS 44-1159) and metallic Ni (2θ = 44.5, 51.8 and 76.3o) (JCPDS 04-0850). This explains the low degree of reduction revealed by TPR experiment for NiACET/CNT catalysts since part of the nickel was already reduced in the treatment step. As the maximum reduction is 100 %, from the reduction degree calculated, it is possible to estimate that approximately 60 % of Ni was reduced by the decomposition of acetate salts during the treatment procedure. After the reduction step (400 °C, 5 °C min-1, 1 h), all diffractograms showed the lines characteristic of metallic nickel (JCPDS 04-0850) (Fig. 5 ). The Ni° crystallite diameters were calculated by Scherrer equation using the second most intense peak of metallic Ni due the overlay between Ni (1 1 1) plane and (1 0 0) plane of the support at 44.5o. The values of crystallite diameters are reported in Table 1. The Ni° crystallite diameters were between 3 and 16 nm, with the larger sizes obtained for the catalysts prepared with nickel acetate salt as precursor. Thus, the Ni° crystallite diameters increased in the following order: NiHYD/CNTIN (3 nm) ˜ NiNIT/CNTOUT (4 nm) ˜ NiNIT/CNTIN (5 nm) ˜ NiHY/CNTOUT (5 nm) < NiACET/CNTOUT (15 nm) ˜ NiACET/CNTIN (16 nm). CO chemisorption analysis were used to determine the Ni dispersion for each catalyst, and the calculations assumed linear chemisorption of CO molecules at Ni metal sites. The CO adsorption data (Table 1) resulted in Ni dispersions values between 9 and 15 % for NiNIT/CNT and NiHYD/CNT catalysts, whereas no CO uptake was observed for NiACET/CNT samples that is likely due to agglomeration of Ni, already observed by XRD. Apparently, the difference in the preparation conditions of catalysts to obtain Ni particles INside or OUTside the CNT did not influence on the Ni crystallite size and perhaps the methodology used was not effective in the selective distribution of Ni particles inside/outside the CNTs. In the present work, the TEM analysis of NiNIT/CNTIN and NiNIT/CNTOUT (Fig. 6 ) were carried out to determine the position of Ni particles in the CNT and to calculate the average particle size distribution (shown in the histograms containing all particles). TEM imagens show that the Ni particles are not fully inside or outside the CNT. The average particle size was 7.4 and 8.4 nm for NiNIT/CNTIN and NiNIT/CNTOUT, respectively. The fraction of particles located inside and outside of the channels and the respective average Ni particle size were determined and reported in the Tables inside Fig. 6. For the NiNIT/CNTIN catalyst, only 30 % of the particles were located inside of CNT, with an average particle size (DP) of 4 nm, whereas 70 % were placed outside the CNT, with DP =9 nm. However, the fraction of the particles positioned outside the CNT was very high (94 %) for NiNIT/CNTOUT catalyst, with an average particle size (DP) of 9 nm, while only 6 % were present inside the CNT, with 3 nm. The approach used in our work for the deposition of the Ni particles only outside the CNT using p-xylene was quite successful, achieving a value of 94 %. However, the incipient wetness impregnation using water as solvent and nickel nitrate as precursor salt was not able to deposit the majority of the Ni particles inside the CNT. Furthermore, the results revealed that placing the particles inside the CNT prevents the growth of the metal particle that were around 3-4 nm, regardless of the impregnation procedure. However, the particles outside the CNT sintered during the treatment, achieving an average particle size of 9 nm, which are twice to three fold higher than those located inside. The synthesis of metal supported CNT will be affected by several factors: the impregnation method (wet or incipient wetness impregnation); the type of the precursor salt and concentration; the internal diameter and the length of CNTs; and the CNT functionalization. Xiang et al. [50] prepared Co catalysts supported on CNT by incipient wetness impregnation using a solution of cobalt nitrate (15 wt. %). The CNT was previously functionalized with a solution of HNO3 concentrated. Only 30 % of the Co particles were located at the internal surface of the CNT. A Co/CNTIN was prepared by wet impregnation using acetone as solvent due to its low surface tension. In this case, 80 % of the Co particles were inserted into the CNT. They also prepared a Co/CNTOUT impregnating first the CNT with p-xylene. For this catalyst, 80 % of the Co particles were dispersed outside the CNT. Augusto et al. [51] synthesized a 1% Co/CNT by incipient wetness impregnation of the support (previously functionalized with HNO3) with an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate, followed by reduction under H2 at 350 °C. This catalyst has 32 % of Co particles inside and 68 % outside the tubes. Our results are quite similar to the ones obtained by Xiang et al. [50] and Augusto et al. [51], when an aqueous solution of metal nitrate was used for impregnation, regardless of the support has been previously functionalized or not. Many authors [26,27,51] have used strong acid pretreatment to open the ends of the nanotubes and/or to insert functionalities groups on the surface of the nanotubes to facilitate the entry of nickel solution inside the channels. Nevertheless, Akbarzadeh et al. [52] demonstrated that the acid treatment does not guarantee the complete insertion of the metallic particles into the carbon nanotubes, since they obtained only 10 % of cobalt inside CNT catalysts by this chemical treatment. Therefore, it is likely that the type of precursor salt did not drive the location of the metal particles toward the inside of the CNT. According to the literature, the type of solvent is more effective to place the particles inside the channels."
7,Hydrogenation of levulinic acid,"3.2 Hydrogenation of levulinic acid The different Ni/CNT catalysts were evaluated in the continuous LA hydrogenation using a trickle-bed reactor at 180 °C and 30 bar. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 1.0 h-1, in order to obtain low conversion for catalysts comparison. Initially, a blank test using pure CNT was carried out, which resulted in any activity after 6 h. The conversion of LA obtained over each different catalyst as function of time is depicted in Fig. 7 . Different activities were observed for the catalysts. The initial conversion for NiNIT/CNTIN, NiHYD/CNTIN and NiACET/CNTIN catalysts were 8, 4 and 0 %, while for NiNIT/CNTOUT, NiHYD/CNTOUT and NiACET/CNTOUT catalysts were 24, 24 and 2 %, respectively. All actives catalysts showed high selectivity to GVL (93 – 100 %) (Table 2 ). The minority product is likely due to 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (4-HPA), an unstable reaction intermediate that is usually observed when the hydrogenation of LA is carried out in the aqueous phase [14,51] or in the presence of non-acid catalysts [53]. The other possible reaction intermediary is α-angelica lactone produced by dehydration of levulinic acid in acidic sites and/or at high reaction temperatures [53]. Intermediates formed by LA esterification are observed preferably in the presence of alcohols [3,4]. In addition, no more severe hydrogenation products from GVL (1,4-pentanediol, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran) has been identified. Regarding the nature of the nickel salts, the catalysts prepared with nickel nitrate and nickel hydroxide salts exhibited higher activity than the one with nickel acetate. The best results observed for these catalysts are related to the size of the Ni particles. Since the same nickel nitrate hydroxide phase was previously detected by XRD for dry NiNIT/CNTIN and NiHYD/CNTIN catalysts, similar nickel species were formed from the decomposition of this intermediate and similar Ni crystallite diameters were also obtained (around 4 nm), see Table 1. For NiACET/CNT catalysts, very large Ni crystallite diameters were obtained (around 16 nm). Qian and Kumar [54] also observed this trend for Ni catalysts supported in activated carbon prepared with nickel acetate salt. In comparison to Ni nitrate, the use of Ni acetate leads to the formation of larger particles size and lower dispersions. Thus, despite showing partial reduction after the treatment step (almost 60 % of Ni°), the use of acetate in the synthesis of the catalysts presents this drawback. Some authors [8,20,22] have associated the best activity of nickel catalysts for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid to the smaller particle size of nickel. LA hydrogenation is proposed to be a structure sensitive reaction and depends on metal particle size. Therefore, the goal of our work was to confine the nickel particles inside the CNTs to produce small and stable nickel particles. However, from our results, the comparison of LA conversion between NiNIT/CNTIN (8 %) and NiNIT/CNTOUT (24 %), reveals that the catalyst with the majority of the particles outside the CNTs (Fig. 6) is more active, despite these catalysts have similar crystallite diameters (or dispersions). To compare the specific activity of these catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated for each one based on the metal active sites estimated by CO chemisorption. The following order was found for TOF values: NiHYD/CNTIN (0.2 × 10-2 h-1) < NiNIT/CNTIN (0.5 × 10-2 h-1) < NiHYD/CNTOUT (0.9 × 10-2 h-1) < NiNIT/CNTOUT (1.6 × 10-2 h-1). Thus, Ni/CNTOUT catalysts having a larger number of particles accessible to the reactants would have a higher reaction rate. Since the mean internal diameter size of the CNT is 5 nm and the nickel particles inside the tubes are 3 or 4 nm, the lower activity for Ni/CNTIN catalysts is likely due to diffusion difficulty of reagents into CNTs. After 6 h of reaction, the catalysts exhibited severe deactivation during the reaction. The loss of activity is likely due to the metal sintering since most of Ni particles were positioned at the external surface of the CNTs, even for the Ni/CNTIN catalysts. However, Ni leaching may not be ruled out [55]."
8,Conclusion,"The effect of the nature of the nickel precursors salts (acetate, nitrate and hydroxide) and the nickel particles position in the CNT were evaluated in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (at 180 °C, 30 bar, WHSV of 1 h-1) in the aqueous medium to produce γ-valerolactone. XRD, TGA and TPD-MS analysis determined the conditions for total Ni salts decomposition and prevention of CNTs gasification during treatment step. The catalysts prepared with nickel nitrate and nickel hydroxide salts showed the same nickel species (Ni2(NO3)2(OH)2.2H2O) before treatment, and similar nickel crystallite diameters (˜ 4 nm) after reduction, while the catalysts prepared with nickel acetate salt showed the autoreduction of Ni during treatment (almost 60 % of Ni°) and higher crystallite diameters (˜ 16 nm) after reduction. All catalysts were selective to GVL (> 90 %), with the exception of NiACET/CNTIN, which showed no activity for the reaction. In our conditions, the catalyst with nickel loaded outside CNTs showed the highest activity for LA hydrogenation due to higher Ni dispersion. The small diameter of the CNTs (5 nm) was the limiting factor for the insertion of Ni particles inside CNTs, the responsible for lower activity of Ni/CNTIN catalysts due to diffusion difficulty of reagents. Considering that the catalyst stability for hydrogenation reaction can be affected by the sintering of metals, modifications on the catalysts synthesis should be carried out in order to promoted the metal deposition inside the CNT: the use of CNT with larger internal diameter and the use of another type of solvent for dissolution of the metal salt."
