0,Introduction,"For several decades, there have been enormous interests in the effective application of renewable biomass resources owing to the persistent decrease in fossil resources and concerns about environmental degradation [1]. A biomass-based furan derivative, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), is considered a promising platform compound because it exhibits a multifunctional structure containing a hydroxyl group, an aldehyde group, and furan rings [2,3]. Moreover, the hydrogenation of HMF can yield different high-value chemicals, including 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), which can be produced via the hydrogenation of the CO bond and 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFA), 5-methylfurfural (5-MF), and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), which can be produced via the hydrogenolysis of the CO bond (Scheme 1 ) [4]. Among them, BHMF and DMF are employed as high-value fine chemicals and biomass-derived liquid fuels. Particularly, BHMF is an essential intermediate for producing crown ethers, functional polymers, resins, artificial fibres, and pharmaceuticals [5–8]. Additionally, DMF is widely employed as a fuel additive, as well as a biomass-derived liquid fuel, because of its excellent features, such as a high octane number, good combustibility, and a high energy density [9]. To date, different heterogeneous metal-based catalysts have been employed for the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and DMF. For example, Chen et al. reported that the highest yield (99%) of BHMF was achieved when zeolite Y-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles were employed for the hydrogenation of HMF at 80 °C and 2.0 MPa H2 [10]. Hu et al. designed and prepared two metal-organic catalysts (Hf-DTMP and Zr-DTMP) for the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF employing 2-butanol as the hydrogen donor; the BHMF yields were 96.8% and 98.5% in the presence of Hf-DTMP and Zr-DTMP, respectively. Although these catalysts exhibit outstanding catalytic activities, their reaction temperatures are very high (140 and 130 °C) [11,12]. Thus, to reduce the reaction temperature, Wiesfeld et al. employed acetalization with 1,3-propanediol to protect the formyl group of HMF, after which the concentrated solutions of the protected HMF were selectively hydrogenated in the presence of Ni-Re/TiO2, thereby achieving an 89.0% yield of BHMF at 40 °C but at high H2 pressure (5.0 MPa), [13]. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop low-pressure catalytic system with low energy consumption. Further, it is challenging to achieve high DMF selectivity because of the complexities of the products of the hydrogenolysis of HMF (Scheme 1). Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the preferential hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of the CO and CO bonds, respectively, as well as avoid the hydrogenation of the furan ring, to produce DMTHF [14]. Ledesma et al. achieved 98% HMF conversion and 86% DMF selectivity over a PtIr-CMK-3 catalyst within 4 h at 120 °C and 15 atm H2, respectively. The high selectivity to DMF can be attributed to the optimal metal-support interaction between the PtIr alloy species together with the high surface area mesoporous carbon [15]. Solanki et al. prepared a 3 %Pt/C catalyst, which achieved the 100% conversion of HMF and 99% selectivity for DMF at 170 °C and 2.0 MPa H2 [16]. Furthermore, Pisal et al. designed a 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of HMF, yielding DMF (97%) at 100 °C and 1.0 MPa H2. It found that the high surface area and acidity of the catalyst were beneficial to the hydrogenation of HMF into DMF [17]. Although these precious metal catalysts can effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of HMF, their industrial applications are restricted by their expensiveness. Thus, the research and development of inexpensive non-precious metal catalysts are greatly required. Different non-precious metal catalysts, such as Co@Cu/3CoAlOx, [18] CuNPs@ZIF-8, [19] ZrCa@CNS-600, [20] 5%Cu-15%Ni/BC, [21] ZrBa-SBA, [22] Cu@C-POP, [23] Cu/Al2O3, [24] and Ni/HC, [25] have been recently employed to produce BHMF and DMF from HMF. However, they require harsh reaction conditions, such as high temperatures (140–200 °C) and high H2 pressures (1.5–9.0 MPa). Accordingly, considering the practical application, it is crucial to develop an efficient catalytic system exhibiting low H2 pressure and low reaction temperature for the hydrogenation of HMF. Compared with monometallic catalysts, many bimetallic ones have been employed to hydrogenate HMF owing to their superior catalytic efficiencies [26,27]. For example, Tan et al. reported that 1Ru1Pd/reduced graphene oxide (RGO), a bimetallic catalyst, exhibited effective catalytic activity, which was 15–22 times higher than those of some monometallic catalysts (2Pd/RGO and 2Ru/RGO), owing to the synergistic effect of Ru and Pd [28]. Gao et al. achieved 96.5% DMF yield over a RuCo/CoOx catalyst at 200 °C and 0.5 Mpa H2 due to the synergy between bimetallic RuCo NPs and abundant surface defects at the metal-support interface [29]. Coincidentally, Elsayed et al. developed a bimetallic catalyst (CuO-Fe3O4/AC), which facilitated the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF with a 92.4% yield, via the synergetic effect of Cu and Fe that promoted the conversion of HMF [30]. Thus, it is valuable to study the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts to improve the BHMF and DMF yields and further optimize the catalysts. Here, an inexpensive and magnetically separable catalyst (NixCoy) was prepared via solid-phase grinding, after which it was applied to the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and DMF in tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent at a low temperature and H2 pressure. Additionally, the effects of the various factors, such as the H2 pressure, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst amount, on the hydrogenation were investigated. The results indicated that the distribution of products could be easily regulated by controlling the composition of the bimetallic Ni-Co phases, as well as the reaction temperature. To our best knowledge, the inexpensive and magnetically separable bimetallic catalyst (NixCoy) has never been reported in this reaction, which can achieve high selectivity of BHMF and DMF from the hydrogenation of HMF at mild reaction conditions."

3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation A series of NixCoy precursors exhibiting different Ni: Co mole ratios (Ni0.5Co1, Ni1.0Co1, Ni1.5Co1, Ni2.0Co1 and Ni2.5Co1) was synthesized via solid-phase grinding (the ratios of Ni: Co were detected via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Table 1 ). To synthesize the Ni1.5Co1 precursors, 15 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 10 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and 25 mmol citric acid monohydrate were mixed and ground for 0.5 h at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous paste. The paste was transformed into an expanded solid-phase catalyst precursor after it was dried for 20 h at 120 °C. This precursor was calcined in an N2 atmosphere for 4 h at 375 °C and a heating rate of 3 °C/min. For comparison, Ni and Co catalysts were synthesized without cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and nickel nitrate hexahydrate, respectively."

After the reaction, the reactor was immediately cooled with ice. Furthermore, the catalyst was readily separated by an external magnetic field, which exploited its high magnetic properties."

The following temperature program was adopted for the chromatographic run: 40 °C for 2 min, which was increased to 100 °C at 20 °C/min and kept for 3 min, after which it was further increased to 200 °C at 20 °C/min and held for 2 min. Additionally, octane was utilized as the internal standard. The HMF conversion and product selectivities were defined, as follows: HMF conversion % = 1 - Mole of HMF Initial mole of HMF × % BHMF selectivity % = Mole of BHMF Initial mole of HMF - mole of HMF × % DMF selectivity % = Mole of DMF Initial mole of HMF - mole of HMF × %"

8,Characterisation of the catalysts,"3.1 Characterisation of the catalysts During the preparation of the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and citric acid were utilised as the Ni and Co sources, as well as the reducing agent, respectively. Thermal analyses of the precursor and Ni1.5Co1 were performed in an N2 atmosphere to investigate the formation process of the catalysts (Fig. 1 ). Regarding the TG curve of the precursor, the weight loss between 100 and 220 °C indicated the removal of surface water. Thereafter, a 40% weight loss of the precursor, which corresponded to the decomposition of the citric acid complex to release the gases, such as CO and CO2, was observed at 350–420 °C. Subsequently, Ni2+ and Co2+ were reduced into the active metals, Ni0 and Co0, respectively, by the reducing gas. This phenomenon correlates with previously reported ones [31,32]. A weight loss of ∼15% was observed in the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst at 350–420 °C; it was attributed to the incomplete decomposition of the citric acid complex. The DTG curve of the precursor revealed that the temperature at 375 °C represented the highest decomposition rate; it was selected as the optimum calcination temperature for the catalyst. The functional groups in NixCoy (Ni0.5Co1, Ni1.0Co1, Ni1.5Co1, Ni2.0Co1 and Ni2.5Co1) were identified via FT-IR analysis (Fig. 2 ). The broad absorption peak at 3427 cm−1 was assigned to the H–O–H bending vibration of the water that was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. The peaks at 2922 and 2848 cm−1 were attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the CH2 group, respectively [25]. Additionally, the peak at 1628 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of the aromatic CC bond [33]. The peaks of the CH and CC stretching vibrations were observed at 1319 and 1260 cm−1, respectively. The peak at 1100 cm− 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the CO bond [34]. The FT-IR results demonstrated that the carbonaceous compounds on the surface of the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst were aromatics owing to the incomplete decomposition of the citric acid complex. The crystal properties of NixCoy were characterized by XRD (Fig. 3 ). All the NixCoy catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks at 44.50° (111), 51.85° (200), and 76.37° (220) (PDF#04-0850), which correspond to the face-centred cubic geometry of metallic Ni. The diffraction peaks at 37.25° (111), 43.28° (200), and 62.87° (220) (PDF#47-1049) were observed in all the NixCoy catalysts, and they correspond to the NiO phase [26]. Additionally, the diffraction peaks, which correspond to the face-centered cubic geometry of metallic Co, were observed at 44.22° (111), 51.52° (200), and 75.85° (220) (PDF#15-0806). The diffraction peaks at 36.49° (111), 42.39° (200), and 61.49° (220) (PDF#48-1719) corresponded to the CoO phase [35]. Further, the diffraction peaks of the metallic Ni and Co phases broadened gradually and shifted to a higher 2q value with the increasing molar ratio of Ni: Co in the catalyst. The appearances of the NiO and CoO phases in the NixCoy catalysts are attributable to the incomplete reduction or surface oxidation of the citric acid complex upon its exposure to air. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas, average pore sizes, and pore volumes of NixCoy (Ni0.5Co1, Ni1.0Co1, Ni1.5Co1, Ni2.0Co1 and Ni2.5Co1) were analyzed employing an automatic physical adsorption analyzer; the Ni and Co contents of NixCoy were analyzed via ICP-AES (Table 1). The BET surface area of the NixCoy catalyst increased with the increasing molar ratio of Ni: Co. Thus, the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst exhibited the largest BET surface area (120.1 m2/g) and pore size (11.4 nm). According to IUPAC, the NixCoy catalysts exhibited the typical type IV isotherm with mesoporous structures (Fig. 4 ). Additionally, these catalysts exhibited large specific surface areas probably because the gases (CO, CO2, etc.) that were generated during the decomposition of the citric acid complex increased the pores. The surface chemical states of Ni1.5Co1 were investigated via XPS, which revealed the existence of the Ni, Co, O, and C elements (Fig. S1). Fig. 5 shows that the main and satellite peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 appeared at 852.3, 855.7, 870.1, and 876.4 eV, which corresponded to the metallic Ni species. Additionally, the peaks at 853.7, 860.8, 872.9, and 879.8 eV were assigned to the main and satellite peaks of Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2, respectively, that corresponded to the NiO species. Similarly, the peaks at 778.1, 782.5, 793.2, and 802.8 eV corresponded to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 main and satellite peaks, which corresponded to the Co species (Fig. 5b). The peaks at 780.2, 786.2, 793.2, and 802.8 eV corresponded to the main and satellite peaks of Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, corresponding to the CoO species [36]. Thus, Ni0, Co0, NiO, and CoO might have co-existed on the surface of the Ni1.5Co catalyst. Further, the broad peak of O 1s at 529.2 eV (Fig. 5c) was attributed to MO (M = Ni, Co). The peaks at 530.8 and 531.8 eV corresponded to the CO and OCO species, respectively [37]. The generation of the oxides can be attributed to surface oxidation, which was due to exposure to the air. Fig. 5d shows that the peaks at 283.9, 285.1, and 288.9 eV were attributed to the CC, CO, and OCO bonds, respectively, [38] and this result correlates with the FT-IR ones for the carbonaceous compounds on the surface of the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst."
9,Catalytic hydrogenation of HMF,"3.2 Catalytic hydrogenation of HMF 3.2.1 Selective hydrogenation of HMF over the different catalysts To investigate the effect of the composition of the bimetallic Ni-Co phases, HMF was hydrogenated into BHMF and DMF over the Ni, Co, Ni0.5Co1, Ni1.0Co1, Ni1.5Co1, Ni2.0Co1 and Ni2.5Co1 catalysts (Table 2 ). Although the Co catalyst (Entry 7) only slightly impacted the hydrogenation of HMF, it effectively increased the selectivity towards BHMF to 83.1%. Conversely, the conversion of HMF over Ni was relatively high, while its selectivities toward BHMF and DMF were relatively low (Entry 6). This result indicates that the Ni component of the catalyst exhibited high activity towards the CO and CO bonds of HMF, while the Co component of the catalyst only exhibited high activity towards the CO bond. Interestingly, when Ni1.5Co1 was employed, it achieved a 100% conversion of HMF, as well as an 80.1% selectivity for DMF within 4 h at 180 °C (Entry 10), indicating the high activity of Ni1.5Co1 towards the selective hydrogenation of HMF. However, a further increase in the Ni content of the catalyst facilitated the hydrogenation of the furan ring of DMF to produce DMTHF (Entries 11 and 12). Regarding the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF, a 91.0% selectivity for BHMF and a 49.2% conversion of HMF were obtained within 1 h at 100 °C by increasing the molar ratio of the metal (Ni: Co) from 0.5 to 1.5 (Entries 1, 2, and 3). A further increase in the Ni content of the catalysts caused a significant downward trend in the conversion of HMF. The reduced catalytic activity of the catalyst towards hydrogenation can be attributed to the recombination of the Ni atoms. Furthermore, the Ni1.5Co1 obtained the highest TOF value, indicating that bimetallic sites are more active than monometallic sites. These results demonstrate that the distribution of the products was readily regulated by controlling the composition of the bimetallic Ni-Co phases. Furthermore, compared with the monometallic catalysts, the bimetallic ones exhibited outstanding activity in the selective hydrogenation of HMF. 3.2.2 Effect of the temperature on the hydrogenation of HMF The distributions of the products of hydrogenating HMF over the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst at different temperatures were investigated (Fig. 6 ). At low temperatures (80 and 100 °C), the selectivities for BHMF were 94.1% and 92.4%, respectively, indicating that the hydrogenation of HMF proceeded at a lower temperature. Compared with the BHMF yields at other temperatures, the highest yield was obtained at 100 °C. Thus, 100 °C was selected as the optimum reaction temperature for hydrogenating HMF into BHMF. With the increasing reaction temperature, the conversion of HMF increased rapidly, achieving a conversion of 66.4% at 160 °C. Meanwhile, many products (such as MFA, 5-MF, and DMF) were obtained via the hydrogenolysis of HMF, and the selectivities for MFA, 5-MF, and DMF were 29.3%, 8.7%, and 19.5%, respectively. These experimental results indicated that the hydrogenolysis reaction was promoted by increasing the temperature. However, when the temperature was increased to 200 °C, the conversion of HMF reduced to 52.6% probably because of the etherification or polymerization of HMF, which proceed at high temperatures. In addition, the selectivity for DMF approached 51.9% when the reaction temperature was increased to 200 °C. These experimental results indicated that the distribution of the products could be easily regulated by controlling the reaction temperature. 3.2.3 Effect of the catalyst loading amount on the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF HMF was hydrogenated into BHMF over different amounts of the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst to determine the optimum amount of the catalyst (Fig. 7 ). Only a 10% conversion of HMF and a 92.4% selectivity for BHMF were obtained when the catalyst loading was 10 wt%. Nevertheless, the conversion of HMF increased gradually to 98.7% as the catalyst amount increased to 30 wt%. Interestingly, the selectivity for BHMF remained the same even with the excessive loading of the catalyst. These results indicated that the active sites for the hydrogenation on the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst effectively promoted the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF. Therefore, the rate of the reaction was determined by the number of active sites on the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst when the catalyst amount was <30 wt%. A further increase in the catalyst loading to 35 wt% did not improve the conversion of HMF, and the selectivity towards BHMF remained largely unaltered. 3.2.4 Effect of the reaction time on the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF Next, the effect of the reaction time on the hydrogenation of HMF was investigated (Fig. 8 ). Upon extending the reaction time from 0.5 to 4 h, the conversion of HMF increased rapidly from 49.3% to 98.7%, while the selectivity for BHMF barely changed. Interestingly, the selectivity towards BHMF remained at >93% during the entire reaction, and only a very small amount of the by-products of hydrogenolysis (5-MF, MFA, and DMF) were detected. Even after extending the reaction time to 5 h, the conversion of HMF and the selectivity for BHMF barely changed. 3.2.5 Effects of the H2 pressure on the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF Fig. 9 shows that the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF was performed over Ni1.5Co1 at different hydrogen pressures. An increase in the hydrogen pressure to 0.50 MPa notably improved the conversion of HMF to 98.7%. The completion of the hydrogenation process strongly depended on the hydrogen pressure. However, an increase in the hydrogen pressure to 0.75 MPa only caused an insignificant change in the HMF conversion. Additionally, the selectivity towards BHMF remained the same (>93%) even with the continuous increase in the hydrogen pressure, indicating that HMF could barely undergo hydrogenolysis over the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst at 100 °C. These experimental results indicated that the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst exhibited efficient catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF at low hydrogen pressure (0.5 MPa). 3.2.6 Effects of the time on the hydrogenation of HMF into DMF To yield the highest amount of DMF and determine the reaction pathway, the effects of the reaction time on the hydrogenolysis of HMF into DMF were investigated. Fig. 10 shows that a 61.6% selectivity for DMF and the complete conversion of HMF (100%) were obtained in 0.5 h, and the selectivity towards BHMF, 5-MF, and 5-MF were 16.8%, 9.4%, and 6.4%, respectively, indicating the reaction was fast, and the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst was efficient for the hydrogenation of HMF into DMF. When the reaction time was extended from 0.5 to 1 h, the selectivity for DMF increased from 61.6% to 80.1%, following the complete conversion of HMF. Moreover, the selectivities for BHMF, as well as the intermediate products (MFA and 5-MF) began to decrease, confirming that DMF was converted via the hydrogenolysis of MFA and 5-MF, following the cleaving of the CO bond of HMF. HMF was first hydrogenated into BHMF before it was hydrogenated into MFA and 5-MF, followed by further hydrogenolysis into DMF. Nevertheless, when the reaction time was further extended to 4 h, the DMF selectivity of the reaction decreased to 74.5%, while the DMTHF selectivity increased to 19.8% owing to the hydrogenation of the furan ring. Additionally, the reaction pathway of the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and DMF employing the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst is proposed and detailedly discussed in Section. 3.2.7 Proposed reaction mechanism and kinetic modeling study Based on the results of the characterization of the catalyst, a probable synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed for the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and DMF over the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst (Scheme 2 ). All the main product (such as BHMF, 5-MF, MFA and DMF) were also identified by GC-MS techniques, and the result was shown in Fig. S2. First, H2 was adsorbed onto the metal sites, after which the H–H bond was cleaved to form active H atoms. These atoms further promoted the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of HMF [39]. Next, the carbonyl oxygen was adsorbed onto the Lewis acid sites of NiO and CoO, which activated the CO bond. Subsequently, the CO bond of HMF was hydrogenated by the active H atoms to produce BHMF [40]. However, the hydrogenolysis of HMF into DMF was complex. It could be deduced that DMF could be obtained via two reaction routes: (1) first, HMF could be hydrogenated into BHMF by the active H atoms, after which the CO bond of BHMF could be polarised by the surface Lewis acid sites of CoO and NiO to yield MFA with the aid of Ni and Co. Similarly, DMF could be generated via the cleaving of the CO bond of MFA by Ni and Co, [41] followed by the desorption of DMF from the surface of the catalyst. (2) The CO bond of HMF could be hydrogenated into 5-MF by the Ni and Co metals. Next, the CO bond of 5-MF could be hydrogenated by the active H atoms to produce MFA [42]. Finally, via the synergistic effect of Co and Ni, the CO bond of MFA could undergo hydrogenolysis to produce DMF. In conclusion, the synergistic catalytic effect of the Lewis acid, as well as metal sites on the catalyst, could promote the hydrogenation and subsequent hydrogenolysis of HMF. In order to understand the reaction mechanism better, the pseudo-zero order and first order law model was applied to calculate the kinetic rate constants and activation energies of the involved reactions (Scheme 3). The experiments were carried out at different temperatures (150 °C, 160 °C, and 170 °C) to determine the kinetic parameters. And the estimated values of the reaction rate constants and the corresponding activation energies were also summarized in Table 3 , determined based on the classical Arrhenius plot (Fig. 11 ). It can be observed that the rate constant k1 (HMF to BHMF) is higher than k2 (HMF to 5-MF), and k3 (BHMF to MFA) is higher than k4 (5-MF to MFA), indicating that HMF → BHMF → MFA → DMF is the main reaction pathway. Additionally, the hydrogenation of the CO bond is favorable than the hydrogenolysis of the CO band due to the rate constant k1 > k2 and k4 > k3. The activation energy EA1 exhibits the lowest value of 39.98 kJ mol−1 and is less sensitive to temperature. The values of activation energy are compared as follows: EA2 > EA1, EA3 > EA4. It suggested that the hydrogenolysis of the CO band requires more energy than the hydrogenation of the CO bond, which is consistent with the results that low temperature is beneficial to HMF generation BHMF and high temperature is beneficial to HMF generation DMF. 3.2.8 Catalyst reusability Finally, to further examine the stability and reusability of the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst, it was reused for three cycles of the hydrogenation of HMF under the optimum reaction conditions. Regarding the regeneration of the catalyst, Ni1.5Co1 was recovered by applying a magnetic field (Fig. S3), followed by thorough washing with THF (three to five times) and vacuum drying at 60 °C. Fig. 12 (a) shows that the increase in the BHMF yield did not continue after the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst was separated from THF by the magnetic field for 2 h. This result demonstrated that the active components (Ni and Co) of the catalyst were not leached and that the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst was heterogeneous. Nevertheless, a decrease in the activity of Ni1.5Co1 was observed during three recycling experiments (Fig. 12(b)). The conversion of HMF decreased from 98.7% to 30.4%, while the selectivity towards BHMF decreased correspondingly from 93.1% to 67.5%. Furthermore, the production of intermediates (MAF and 5-MF) was observed. Thus, the reused Ni1.5Co1 was characterized by FT-IR and XRD after three recycling experiments. Compared with the fresh catalyst, the diffraction peaks of the used catalyst did not significantly change (Fig. S4), indicating that the structure of the reused Ni1.5Co1 was maintained. However, the FT-IR spectra of the reused catalyst (Fig. S5) revealed that the characteristic peaks at 2922 and 2848 cm−1 (vs CH2 and vas CH2), 1628 cm−1 (v CC), 1319 cm−1 (v CH), 1260 cm−1 (v CC), and 1100 cm−1 (v CO) became broader and evident. These characterization results revealed that there were organic impurities on the surface of the catalyst, and they were caused by chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the used Ni1.5Co1 catalyst was recalcined in an H2 atmosphere for 4 h at 375 °C, after which it was reused in the fourth cycle. Interestingly, its selectivity towards BHMF, as well as its conversion of HMF, were comparable with those of the first cycle (Fig. 12b). This indicated that Ni1.5Co1 could be recalcined to restore its catalytic performance. Therefore, the deactivation of the used Ni1.5Co1 catalyst could be caused by the poisoning of the Co and Ni active sites on the surface of the catalyst by the organic impurities therein. Our future study would be focused on enhancing the stability of the Ni1.5Co1 catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, an inexpensive and magnetically separable NixCoy catalyst was prepared via a solid-phase grinding method and employed for the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and DMF. The Ni1.5Co1 catalyst exhibited a large BET surface area (120.1 m2/g) and obtained 93.1% and 80.1% selectivities of BHMF and DMF with a full conversion of HMF under the optimized reaction conditions, respectively. Compared with the monometallic Ni or Co catalysts, the bimetallic NixCoy catalyst exhibited higher efficient catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and DMF. Notably, the distribution of the products was easily regulated by controlling the composition of the bimetallic Ni-Co phases and the reaction temperature. Additionally, the synergistic catalytic effect of the hydrogenation sites of Ni and Co, as well as the Lewis acid sites of NiO and CoO, promoted the conversion of HMF. The inexpensive and magnetically separable bimetallic catalyst, which was proposed here, could be applied to the development of high-value fine chemicals and biomass-derived liquid fuels, thus efficiently exploiting biomass resources."
