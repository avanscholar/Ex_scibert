0,Introduction,"Due to the limited fossil energy and the serious environment problem caused by its use, the development of renewable clean energy has become an important subject [1–3]. In recent years, heterogeneous photocatalytic water-spitting for H2-production which transforms the solar energy into the chemical energy has been increasingly the most ideal way. At present, some oxides, such as TiO2, Fe2O3 and Ga2O3 have been reported to split water under ultraviolet irradiation [4–6]. Among them, the anatase TiO2 have become the most widely used photocatalyst due to its wide band-gap (3.2eV), low price, good chemical stability and non-toxic properties. The photocatalytic water splitting process includes the following steps: the semiconductor photocatalysts absorb the photon greater than or equal to the band-gap and was excited to produce the electron–hole pairs. After the separation and transfer to the catalyst surface of photogenerated carriers, the photogenerated electron would reduce the H+ to produce H2, while the hole would oxidize the absorbed water into the O2 and H+ [7,8], which was shown in the following formula: TiO2 + hν →TiO2 (e− +h+) 2e− +2H+ →H2 2h+ +H2O→1/2O2 +2H+ However, when using the TiO2 alone as the photocatalyst, the quantum efficiency of photocatalytic water decomposition is extremely low due to the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes [9,10]. After adding the sacrificial agent into the reaction system, it can participate in the water oxidation (electron acceptor) or reduction (electron donor) reaction to generate the O2 or H2, effectively promoting the photocatalytic reaction [11,12]. Currently, it has been reported that the aliphatic alcohol can be as the hole sacrificial agent for the H2-production in the photocatalytic water decomposition [13,14]. However, due to the strong oxidative potential of the radicals and holes generated on the surface of photocatalysts, the alcohol was always promoted to a complete mineralization, making most of the normally convert to CO2. Therefore, it would be very meaningful that the sacrificial agent was transformed into the valuable chemicals while producing H2 in the photocatalytic process. A few studies have been found that the CC coupling reaction of alcohol can occur on the ZnS-based semiconductors by the photocatalytic process [15]. But the ZnS, as the photocatalyst, is prone to be corroded. Recently, it has been found that the oxidation kinetics and pathway of sacrificial ethanol and 2-propanol during the water-splitting reaction can be effectively altered by the modulation of TiO2 structure, leading to generate the corresponding cross-coupling products [16,17]. Therefore, it is also desirable to realize the carbon–carbon coupling of different sacrificial alcohols by the photocatalytic process with modulating TiO2 photocatalyst. Moreover, the TiO2 photocatalyst were also continuously reported to selectively oxidized organic species by photocatalytic process [18–21]. In the submitted work, photocatalytic water decomposition reaction over the TiO2 nanotube was carried out by using different aliphatic alcohols as the sacrificial agent. The aliphatic alcohol was not only as a sacrificial agent, but also was coupled to produce valuable dihydric alcohol."
1,Experimental,
2,The preparation of TiO2 photocatalyst,"2.1 The preparation of TiO2 photocatalyst The TiO2 nanotube was synthesized with the commercial P25 nanoparticles as starting material. 0.3g P25 nanoparticles were added into 50mL of 10M NaOH solution to form a suspension. The suspension was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 130°C for 24h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained product was thoroughly washed with 0.1M HCl aqueous solution and subsequent distilled water for several times until the pH value reached around 7, the obtained powders were then heat-treated under atmospheric air at 350°C for 2h. The TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared as follows: 40mL of titanium(IV) butoxide was dropwisely added into 240mL of 0.1M HNO3 under vigorously stirring. After hydrolysis, the slurry was rapidly heated to 80°C and kept for 8h. After peptization, the colloid solution was moved to a self-sealed Teflon-line autoclave that was heated for 12h at 230°C to grow TiO2 nanoparticles."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained on a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (German) using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å). The morphology of the as-prepared samples was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) using an accelerating voltage of 200kV. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was measured by a nitrogen adsorption technique at 77K using an ASAP2020M automated gas-sorption system (America)."
4,Photocatalytic water decomposition,"2.3 Photocatalytic water decomposition The experimental was carried out in a closed multipurpose photochemical reaction device, equipped with a 300W high-pressure Hg lamp, which was set into a quartz cool trap with a condensed water controller. TiO2 nanotubes (1g) were added into a solution containing aliphatic alcohol (10mL, including methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, sec-butanol and tert-butanol, respectively) and water (190mL). Under the conditions of magnetically stir, oxygen was totally removed after vacuuming for 30min. And then, switched on light sources and opened condensed water for photocatalytic reaction. The platinum was in situ photodeposited on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes under the UV radiation. The gas and liquid sample were detected individually by gas chromatography (GC). The products were confirmed by comparison with standard samples and by GC-MS (Shimadzu; GCMS-QP2010 Plus)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalytic H2-production by using TiO2 nanotube as the photocatalysts,"3.1 Photocatalytic H2-production by using TiO2 nanotube as the photocatalysts Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared TiO2 nanotube is almost anatase phase, which agrees with the literatures [22–24]. As seen in the TEM pictures (Fig. 1b), a large amount of nanotubes which has a diameter of about 10nm and a length of several hundred nanometers were obtained. It is also observed that the prepared nanotubes possessed uniform inner and outer diameters along their length (from the inset of HRTEM). Further observation indicated that the nanotubes were multi-layered and open-ended. By using the TiO2 nanotube as the catalyst, 1wt% Pt as the co-catalyst, the photocatalytic H2-production was performed on the 5wt% aliphatic alcohol aqueous solution. As shown in the Fig. 2 , when using different aliphatic alcohols as the sacrificial agent, the rate of H2-production changes over time. It can be seen that the rate of H2-production is initially fast, but prone to stable after a period. With the increase of carbon chain, the H2-production rate will gradually reduce, indicating that the kinds of the alcohol have a great influence on the photolytic reaction activity. Due to all the carbon atoms of the methanol with the α-H, the H2 can be completely desorbed from the surface of Pt. A molecular methanol can produce three molecules H2 with the water decomposition [25]. The ethanol has a β-H besides to the α-H, and all the β-H were not removed in the photocatalytic process. The CC bond of ethanol would be ruptured, leading to the production of CH4 [26]. In theory, a molecular ethanol can produce two molecules of H2, so the H2-production rate of ethanol should be lower than that of methanol; the specific formula was as below: (1) CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +3H2 (2) C2H5OH+H2O→CO2 +2H2 +CH4 Similar to the methanol and ethanol, other aliphatic alcohol was also first aborsorbed on the photocatalyst, and then the aborsorbed alcohol would be dissociated to produce H atom and alkoxide [27–29]. The H atom would be stripped to produce H2, but the alkoxide can be decomposed to be the alkane, CO and CO2. (1) Adsorption of alcohol Pt/TiO2 RCH2CH2OH(l)→RCH2CH2OH(a) (2) Dehydrogenation of alcohol RCH2CH2OH(a)→RCH2CH2O(a)+H(a) (3) Recombinative desorption of hydrogen 2H(a)→H2(g) Therefore, the rate of H2-production depends on whether the alcohol molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface can rapidly dissociate to produce hydrogen. Yang et al. have compared the production of hydrogen of different alcohols. It was also found that the alcohols showed lower production of molecular hydrogen with the increase of carbon chain, and there is clearly relationship between the solvent polarity and the rate of H2 production [27]. The H abstraction from the alcohol is governing the reaction. In the process of photocatalytic water splitting, the rate of hydrogen production may be explained by the proton ionization ability of the alcohol. With the increase of carbon chain, the proton ionization ability of the alcohol gets worse, leading to the decrease of the H2-production rate."
7,Photocatalytic carbon–carbon bond formation,"3.2 Photocatalytic carbon–carbon bond formation During the photocatalytic water splitting process, the photogenerated electron reduces the proton to produce H2, but the hole can oxidize the sacrifice agent to be coupled or further oxidized. After the photocatalytic reaction, the liquid product was collected and analyzed by using the gas chromatography and GC–MS. It was found that except methanol, the other aliphatic alcohols, including ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, sec-butanol and tert-butanol, were successfully coupled to corresponding dihydric alcohol such as 2,3-butanol, pinacol, 3,4-hexanediol, 3,4-dimethyl-3,4-hexanediol and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanediol. The formula was shown as follows: Fig. 3 shows the conversion of the alcohol and the selectivity of as-prepared dihydric alcohol. The corresponding chromatograms were shown in the supporting materials. The ethanol and propanol can be formed CC bond and the selectivity of the corresponding glycol is relatively high. However, compared with the coupling of ethanol and propanol, the selectivity of coupled products for the butanol is low. Meanwhile, the tert-butanol has no the α-C atom, but the 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanediol was obtained, which may be caused by the rearrangement of the tert-butanol in the photocatalytic process. The selectivity of CO2 was also shown in the Fig. 3, it can be found that the methanol was mainly transformed into CO2, and other alcohol produce a little CO2 in the photocatalytic process, which suggests that the partial transformation into the valuable glycol of the sacrificial agents."
8,The proposed mechanism of the photocatalytic CC coupling of alcohol,"3.3 The proposed mechanism of the photocatalytic CC coupling of alcohol In the previous studies, the ZnS has been reported to realize the photocatalytic carbon–carbon coupling of alcohol. The specific reaction mechanism was studied by using the ethanol as the example, the photogenerated electron can reduce the H+ into the H2 in the presence of water by using the ZnS as the photocatalyst, but the photogenerated hole can oxidized the ethanol into the corresponding α-C free radicals. If the α-C free radicals can rapidly strip from the catalyst, it would be coupled to produce the corresponding glycol. However, if the α-C radicals do not stripped from the catalyst in time, the transferred hole would oxidize it into the aldehyde, acide or CO2 [30]. The size of ZnS is reported to play an important role on the selectively photocatalytic oxidation, and the ZnS nanometer particles is helpful for the desorption of α-hydroxyethyl radicals to form the 2,3-butanediol. Although the alcohols were coupled by using the ZnS as the photocatalyst, the photocorrosion of ZnS inhibit its practical application. When using the TiO2 as the photocatalyst, the ethanol can also be initially converted into CHOHCH3 (α-hydroxyethyl) radicals through the photocatalytic oxidation process. The radicals, in theory, can further couple to form 2,3-butane diol or be oxidized into aldehydes, acids, or even CO2 by the additional holes and oxygen-containing radicals. However, the ethanol is usually converted into a mixture of aldehydes, acids, and CO2 and the coupling products, although highly valuable, are rarely obtained. However, it has been reported that the oxidation pathway of sacrificial ethanol can be effectively coupled to produce 2,3-butanediol through the modulation of TiO2 porous structure [16], showing the photocatalytic coupling reaction possibility of aliphatic alcohol when using TiO2 as photocatalyst. We further compared the conversion and the selectivity by using the ethanol as sacrificial agent under different reaction conditions, and the corresponding results were shown in the Table 1 . It can be seen that the ethanol was converted into 2,3-butanediol by using the Pt@TiO2 nanotube as the photocatalyst and Ar as the carrier gas in the aqueous solution. Therefore, the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were also prepared and used as the photocatalyst to detect whether the 2,3-butanediol can be formed in the ethanol aqueous solution. As shown in the Fig. S6, the TiO2 has well crystallization with the anatase structure and its particle diameter is only several nanometers, but the 2,3-butanediol is not formed after photocatalytic reaction. Fig. 4 shown the pore distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes, and the abundant micropores exist on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, leading to the difficult desorption of α-hydroxyethyl radicals and over-oxidation of ethanol. However, although the TiO2 nanotube has a pore structure in its inner tube, the 1D axial structure is still helpful for the desorption of α-hydroxyethyl radicals and the formation of coupling products. When only using the TiO2 nanotube without using Pt as cocatalyst, the conversion of ethanol become slow, which indicates that the Pt is important for the photocatalytic reaction since it can accept the photogenerated electron and be as the active site of H2-prodction. The Pt can be loaded on the TiO2 nanotube by in situ photo-deposition, and the HRTEM of the Pt/TiO2 nanotubes was shown in the Fig. 5 , it can be seen that some Pt was enter the inner wall of the tube, but other Pt was also deposited on the outer tube. In the photocatalytic oxidation process, the organic species was oxidized by the generated holes or indirectly via the combination with OH abundant in water solution. If the water was replaced by the acetonitrile, the photocatalytic reaction would not be occurred. Further, the introduction O2 into the system can improve the conversion of ethanol, but the selectivity of 2,3-butanediol decreases. Therefore, the photocatalytic coupling of ethanol should be performed by using suitable catalyst under appropriate condition. The scheme of photocatalytic water decomposition by using the alcohol as the sacrificial agent was shown in the Fig. 6 . After the photocatalyst absorbs the photon equal to or greater than its band-gap, the electron would be excited from the valence band into the conduction band, leading to the production of photogenerated electron and hole pairs. The electron would transfer into the surface of catalyst for the reduction of H+ into H2, but the hole or the OH would oxidize the absorbed aliphatic alcohols to α-C radicals. After the fast desorption of the α-C radicals from the surface of TiO2 in the photocatalytic process, the aliphatic alcohols were successfully coupled to corresponding dihydric alcohol. However, the selectivity of the dihydric alcohol is different, which may be caused by the difference in the desorption rate of the produced α-C radicals."
9,Conclusion,"The H2 was photocatalytically produced from water over Pt/TiO2 nanotube by using different aliphatic alcohols as sacrifice agent. It was found that the reaction may be governed by the rate of alcohol dissociation on the TiO2 nanotube surface. The aliphatic alcohols, including ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, sec-butanol and tert-butanol, were successfully coupled to corresponding dihydric alcohol such as 2,3-butanol, pinacol, 3,4-hexanediol, 3,4-dimethyl-3,4-hexanediol and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanediol, it would offer a possibility for efficient utilization of sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic H2-production from water."
