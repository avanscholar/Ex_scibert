0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive fuel source for H2 production due to its renewable nature and ready availability [1–6]. However, due to its heterogeneity and crystallinity, direct utilization of lignocellulosic biomass for hydrogen production is difficult and it requires pre-treatment. In other words, lignocellulosic biomass has to be converted to monosaccharides or other low-molecular-weight compounds before fermentation. The most commonly used method of converting lignocellulosic biomass to monosaccharides is through a dilute-acid pre-treatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis process [7–9]. In addition to monosaccharides are produced in acid pre-treatment, water-soluble byproducts such as weak acids, furan derivatives and phenolic compounds are also generated. These byproducts have been reported negatively affected the cell membrane function, the growth, and the glycolysis of yeast and bacteria [10–13]. Due to their inhibitory effects on productivity and end-product formation, the byproducts may be a limiting factor in the feasibility of lignocellulose biotechnological conversion. However, to the best of our knowledge, up to now, there have been no studies reporting the effects of inhibitors present in acid pre-treatment hydrolysate on fermentative hydrogen production. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of added representative inhibitors of acetate sodium, furfural, HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde individual or combination on fermentative hydrogen production by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 and then further evaluated the potential of hydrogen production from different concentrated acid corn stover hydrolysate."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Acid hydrolysis pre-treatment,"2.1 Acid hydrolysis pre-treatment The corn stover feedstock containing 37.6% w/w cellulose, 21.5% w/w hemicellulose, 19.1% w/w lignin on the dry basis at a solid–liquid ratio of 1:10 (g dry weight to ml) was mixed with 2.0% (v/v) sulfuric acid and hydrolyzed in an autoclave at 121 °C with residence time 90 min. After acid hydrolysis, the solid residual was separated by centrifugation (8000×, 10 min) (Sigma 3K30, Germany). Then the supernatant pH was adjusted to neutral with 2 N Ca(OH)2 and the precipitate was removed again by centrifugation. The final supernatant was analyzed for its contents of soluble sugars (glucose, xylose and arabinose) and byproducts (acetic acid, furan compounds and phenolic compounds)."
3,Microorganism,"2.2 Microorganism T. thermosaccharolyticum W16, a glucose–xylose fermenting strain isolated by Ren et al. [14] was used in fermentation experiments. It was grown at 60 °C in a medium containing (L−1): 1.0 g NH4Cl, 3.0 g K2HPO4, 1.5 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgCl2·6H2O, 1.0 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 0.5 g cysteine-HCl, 2.0 g yeast extract, 2.0 g tryptone, 10 g xylose, 1 ml trace element solution, 1 ml vitamin solution [15]. The strain at its exponential-growth phase was used as the inoculum and inoculated at 4% (v/v)."
4,Batch fermentation test,"2.3 Batch fermentation test For inhibition studies, fermentation experiments were carried out using the medium containing the compositions mentioned in Sec. 2.2 and quantitative different inhibitors. The fermentations without added inhibitors are hereafter referred to as reference fermentations. For hydrolysate test, Corn stover acid hydrolysate was prepared as follows: firstly, the acid hydrolysate was extracted with an equivalent volume of diethyl ether to remove the inhibitory substances, e.g. furfurals, acids and soluble lignins. After separation of the two phases, the upper layer was transferred to a test tube and dried under N2 at 40 °C. The residue (solid content) of the extract was resuspended in hydrolysate to make the inhibit mixtures in hydrolysate increased 1×, 2× and 3× compared to the original hydrolysate. Then the hydrolysates containing different concentrations of inhibitory mixtures were supplement with the following nutrients (per litter) NH4Cl 1.0 g, K2HPO4 3.0 g, KH2PO4 1.5 g, MgCl2·6H2O 0.5 g, NaCl 2.0 g, KCl 0.2 g, cysteine-HCl 0.5 g, yeast extract 2.0 g, tryptone 2.0 g and 1 mL trace element solution, l mL vitamin solution [15]. All fermentations were carried out in 150 ml glass serum bottles with working volume of 100 ml. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.0 in all fermentation solutions with 1 N NaOH. The fermentation temperature was kept at a constant value of 60 °C ± 0.5 °C. Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals for determining optical density (OD600), pH, and quantity and compositions of produced biogas. The volume of biogas was measured by plunger displacement method. All fermentation experiments were carried out in triplicate to check data quality."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The initial sugar composition of the hydrolysate, as well as the sugar consumption during fermentation was determined by using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (LC-10A, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) with a refractive index detector (RID-10A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Sugars were separated on an HPX-87P column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) operating at 80 °C with A mixture of acetonitrile and deionized water (ratio 85:15) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. The volatile fatty acids and alcohols were detected by GC (4890D, Agilent Cooperation, USA) equipped with a hydrogen flame-ionization detector and a 2.0 m stainless steel column packed with GDX103 (60/80 mesh). The gas samples were measured by GC (GC-SC2, Shanghai Analytical Apparatus, Shanghai, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2.0 m stainless steel column packed with TDS-01 (60/80 mesh) and N2 at a flow rate of 70 ml min−1 as carrier gas. The inhibitors in the hydrolysate were analyzed by a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) (6890 N-5973, Agilent Cooperation, USA). The GC is equipped with column of 30 m × 0.25 mm DB and N2 at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 as carrier gas. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV. The hydrolysate samples for GC–MS analysis were pretreated according to the method of Fenske et al. [16]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Potential inhibitors from acid pre-treatment corn stover hydrolysate,"3.1 Potential inhibitors from acid pre-treatment corn stover hydrolysate During sulfuric acid hydrolysis of corn stover, besides soluble sugars were produced, byproducts such as furan compounds (0.85 g L−1), phenolic compounds (0.1 g L−1) and acetate (1.85 g L−1) were generated. Furfural (0.60 g L−1) and HMF (0.25 g L−1) were the main furan compounds. Phenolic compounds included two types of aliphatic side chains: phenol aldehydes (4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, syringaldehyde) and phenol acids (4-hydroxybenzaldehyde acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid and palmitic acid). The main phenols in the hydrolysate were vanillin and syringaldehyde, occurring in the concentration of 0.04 g L−1 and 0.06 g L−1 respectively. During fermentation, these chemicals may affect the culture negatively. In order to investigate the impact of these byproducts on growth and hydrogen production of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16, the experiments of adding these chemicals to the reference medium and hydrolysate at different concentrations were further investigated."
8,Effect of added individual inhibitors on growth and hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of added individual inhibitors on growth and hydrogen production Acetate, one of the most abundant organic acids generated through pre-treatment, is known to result from the hydrolysis of acetylxylan in hemicellulose. The inhibitory effect of acetate on the ethanol production of various microorganisms is well known [17–19]. To observe the effect of acetate on hydrogen-producing strain T. thermosaccharolyticum W16, defined concentrations of sodium acetate (range 0–10.0 g L−1) were added to the fermentation broth. The growth of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was stimulated and the maximum cell concentration recorded was 1.25 g L−1 when T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was grown in medium containing 5.0 g L−1 sodium acetate, which was 8.4% higher than the maximum achieved in the reference medium (without added acetate) (Fig. 1 A). Further increasing in sodium acetate concentration up to 10 g L−1, no positive effect was observed. In agreement with growth, hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was also stimulated by the presence of sodium acetate (Fig. 2 A). When 5.0–6.0 g L−1 sodium acetate was added to fermentation medium, the maximum hydrogen production was 2766–2791 ml L−1, which is approximately 10% higher than the maximum achieved in the reference medium. Xylose and other pentose sugars are liberated during the degradation of hemicellulose, and further degradation releases furfural, while HMF is the result of hexose degradation. These furan derivatives have been reported to act as strong inhibitors of many soluble enzymes [20], with those involved in glycolysis [21,22]. In this study, furfural and HMF exerted a large negative influence on growth and hydrogen production compared to sodium acetate (Figs. 1 and 2B). Results showed that in the presence of an initial concentration of 1.0 g L−1 of furfural and HMF, an obvious decrease 17.9% and 50.2% were produced and growth was not observed at initial concentration up to 2.0 g L−1 and 1.5% respectively (Fig. 1B). T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 displayed sensitivity to furfural and HMF similar to those of yeasts such as Corynebacterium glutamicum [23], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [24] and Pichia stipitis [25]. Meanwhile, the hydrogen production was also influence by furfural and HMF. Little or no hydrogen was produced in the presence of 1.8 g L−1 furfural and 1.5 g L−1 HMF (Fig. 2B). This fact suggests that measures should be taken to reduce the concentration of these inhibitors below its inhibiting threshold (1.5–2.0 g L−1) to ensure fermentation availability. Vanillin and syringaldehyde are generated by the partial breakdown of lignin through the guaiacyl residue and syringyl residue, respectively, and has been suggested to exert a considerable inhibitory effect in the fermentation of lignocellulose hydrolysates [23,26,27]. In experiments with vanillin and syringaldehyde, the strain W16 showed more sensitive syringaldehyde. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2C, the relative growth and hydrogen production with 0.5 g L−1 syringaldehyde decreased 8.8% and 10.9% of that of the reference culture, respectively. When the concentration of syringaldehyde increased to 1.0 g L−1, fermentation was severely inhibited and the growth and hydrogen production were reduced to 51.4% and 54.3% respectively compared to the reference culture. However, vanillin had no severe inhibition on growth and hydrogen production at the concentration (0–2.0 g L−1) investigated. The relative growth and hydrogen production were not less than 70% of that of reference culture even at vanillin concentration up to 2 g L−1 which was constant with the results of Ando et al. [28]. The difference inhibitory effect of phenolic compounds may be due to the molecular structures of these inhibitors with the difference ability to penetrate the cell membrane [13,19]. In contrast, Thermoanaerobacter mathranii, a promising ethanol producing strain showed more sensitive to phenolic compounds. In the case of 10 mM (about 1.5 g) additions of the vanillin, about 30% relative growth reduction was observed [13]. This indicates that strain T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 showed high tolerance to vanillin."
9,Effect of added combined inhibitors on growth and hydrogen production,"3.3 Effect of added combined inhibitors on growth and hydrogen production Table 1 showed the effect of various combinations of inhibitors on growth and hydrogen production. In run I 0.5 g L−1 of each of furfural and HMF were added to the medium, while in run II the furfural and HMF concentrations were increased to 0.8 g L−1 each. In run I the maximum cell concentration of 1.08 g L−1 was achieved after 28 h of growth, while in run II it was 0.81 g L−1. In the two fermentations (run I and run II), cell concentrations were reduced by 6 and 30% compared to reference culture, respectively. In run III, 0.5 g L−1 each of furfural, HMF, and syringaldehyde were added while in run IV their concentrations were increased to 0.8 g L−1 each (Table 1). In these runs (III and IV) maximum cell concentrations of 0.98 and 0.63 g L−1 were achieved and these values were reduced by 14.8 and 45.2% compared to reference fermentation, respectively. In run I, 2495 ml L−1 hydrogen was produced which is comparable to the reference fermentation (2515 ml L−1). In run II 1762 ml L−1 hydrogen was produced. Run III had 0.5 g L−1 each of furfural, HMF, and syringaldehyde and it produced 2112 ml L−1. Run IV resulted in the production of 1378 ml L−1 hydrogen. Hydrogen productivity in Run I was 89.8 ml L−1 h−1, which is lower than that achieved in the reference experiment (114.3 ml L−1 h−1). The productivities obtained in runs II–IV were 51.82, 66, and 36.26 ml L−1 h−1, respectively. Comparison of cell concentrations, hydrogen yield and productivities of T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 in the four runs with reference (without inhibitor) and experiments where inhibitors were tested individually suggested that the synergistic effects were shown in combined inhibitors. This observation is constant with the results obtained from Escherichia coli fermentations carried out in the combinations of furfural with other aldehydes [29]."
10,Hydrogen fermentation in hydrolysate,"3.4 Hydrogen fermentation in hydrolysate The above results show that the representative inhibitors presented in acid hydrolysate has the synergistic effect on growth and hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16. Thus, hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was further evaluated in hydrolysate with different concentrations of inhibitory mixtures. To avoid the inhibition of high sugars in concentrated hydrolysates, it just concentrated the inhibitors and kept the sugars constant. Restated, the preparation of different concentrated hydrolysates was mentioned in Sec. 2.3. The compositions of hydrolysates with different concentrations of inhibitors were shown in Table 2 , while compounds less than 0.01 g L−1 were omitted. Fig. 3 shows the hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 from hydrolysates containing different concentrations of inhibitors. It can be noted that the W16 performance was strongly affected by the concentration of inhibitory compounds present in the hydrolysate. The hydrogen production in original acid hydrolysate was similar to the synthetic medium, suggesting that, although the total inhibitory compounds in hydrolysate prolonged the fermentation time, it did not induce the decrease of hydrogen production. However, when the inhibitors in hydrolysate were concentrated 1×, 2× and 3×, the hydrogen production were severely influenced compared to the synthetic medium and original acid hydrolysate fermentation. At 1× and 2× concentrated inhibitors, an obvious lag phase about 15 h was produced and hydrogen production was decreased 54.1% and 14.3%, respectively. When the hydrolysate was concentrated 3× inhibitors, total inhibition of fermentation occurred. Analyzing the compositions of concentrated hydrolysates (Table 2), the inhibitory effect attributed to the higher concentrations of total furfural compounds in acid hydrolysate. In fact, among the inhibitory compounds present in acid corn stover hydrolysate, the furfural compounds appears to be the most inhibitory to the microorganism, because their concentration was the highest among all inhibitory compounds. It must be also considered that, although the phenolic compounds were present in different concentrated hydrolysate media in concentrations considered as not inhibitory to the microorganism, the presence of the furfural compounds in these media can potentialize the phenolic compounds toxicity, due to the synergistic effect."
11,Conclusions,"In the pre-treatment of corn stover by dilute-acid hydrolysis process, degradation byproducts such as furfural, HMF and phenolic compounds were identified and subsequently the representative inhibitors present in hydrolysate were investigated individually or combinations on growth and hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16. Sodium acetate showed stimulatory effect on growth and H2 production at a concentration up to 6 g L−1. In contrast, furfural, HMF, vanillin and syringaldehyde were potent inhibitors of growth and hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 depending on their concentrations. Comparison the cell yield and hydrogen production in the medium contained combined inhibitors with control (without inhibitor) and experiments with inhibitors individually suggested that the synergistic inhibitory effects were shown in combined inhibitors. Fermentation results from acid corn stover hydrolysate showed that hydrogen production by T. thermosaccharolyticum W16 was strongly influenced by the concentration of inhibitory compounds present in the medium, at 1×, 2×, 3× concentrated inhibitors, the hydrogen production were decreased at 54.1%, 14.3% and 100%, respectively. It was thus concluded that to increase the efficiency of this bioprocess from corn stover hydrolysate, the inhibitory compounds concentration must be reduced to the levels present in the raw hydrolysate, which did not interfere in the microbial metabolism."
