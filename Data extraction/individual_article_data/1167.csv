0,Introduction,"Coffee post-harvest processing by wet method includes the steps of mechanical removal of pulp, husk, and mucilage and grain drying [1], which is widely used because of the better quality product obtained [2], but which generates high amounts of waste. Solid waste from coffee processing (pulp and husk) is approximately 45% of the fruit [3], and between 5000 and 15000 L of wastewater is generated for each ton of processed coffee [2]. Considering the coffee production in Brazil for 2018, approximately 3.6 million tonnes of coffee were processed [4], which generated between 27 and 432 million tonnes of solid waste (pulp and husk) and between 1.8 × 1010 and 5.4 × 1010 L of wastewater. Some environmental problems associated of coffee waste are soil salinization, water eutrophication, death of aquatic organisms and plants, proliferation of microorganisms and insects, and generation of foul odors [2,5], which hamper their agricultural application. In this context, reuse of coffee wastewater and vegetable residue (pulp and husk) to obtain energy and biotechnological products can reduce the negative environmental impact and increase economic gains in this sector. For example, coffee mucilage, pulp and wastewater were used by Rojas-Sossa et al. for CH4 production [1]. Menezes et al. [6] and Cárdenas et al. [7] used coffee pulp and mucilage to obtain ethanol and H2, respectively. Pulp and husk contains high carbohydrate content (70%), of which 16–43% are cellulose and 7–29% hemicellulose. Coffee processing wastewater had high concentration of organic matter (17244 mg COD/L), macro and micronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium between 23 and 625 mg/L) [8–11]. In this context, wastewater [12–14], mucilage [15] and liquid fraction from coffee husk pretreatment [16] were used to produce H2 (Table S1, Supplementary Material). However, the co-digestion of coffee wastewater with pulp and husk has not been a research topic, which could result in an increase in H2 production, as a function of equilibrium in the ratios of carbon to nitrogen (C/N), concentration of macro and micronutrients, pH, alkalinity and inhibitory compounds [17]. Some limitations should be considered, such as high concentration of polyphenols, which may contribute to fermentation inhibition (greater than 9% in solid waste and up to 1528 mg/L in wastewater) [18,19] and the resistance of coffee pulp and husk to hydrolysis, besides the insoluble presence of carbohydrates. To overcome these limitations, obtaining a microbial consortium from coffee wastes may favor the selection of tolerant bacteria and fungi adapted to the complex lignocellulosic substrates. De Carvalho Neto et al. [20,21] identified bacteria similar to Fructobacillus, Pseudonocardia, Pedobacter, Sphingomonas and Hymenobacter and fungi similar to Saccharomyces, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Pichia kluyveri, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Hanseniaspora vineae and Meyerozyma caribbica in bean fermentation during coffee wet processing [20,21]. Pretreatment of pulp and husk by milling and hydrothermal system may increase the biodegradability and availability of fermentable substrates by recovering a cellulose-rich solid fraction and liquid fraction (also called hydrolyzate) containing oligosaccharides, xylose, phenolic compounds, furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) [22]. These latter are inhibitors of cell growth and glycolysis enzymes, which are mainly formed at high pretreatment severity [22]. Therefore, the operating conditions of the hydrothermal reactor, such as pretreatment temperature and time, need to be improved. For example, for coffee husk Baêta et al. evaluated hydrothermal pretreatment from 1 to 60 min and from 120 to 210 °C. The authors obtained maximum CH4 production (144.96 mL/g COD) for conditions at 120 °C and 60 min, with furfural and 5-HMF concentrations below 100 mg/L [24]. Therefore, the objective of this research was to improve H2 production by hydrothermal pretreatment of coffee pulp and husk, its co-digestion with wastewater and liquid fraction from pretreatment and bioaugmentation of autochthonous microorganisms. The effect of pretreatment severity, generation of inhibitory products, and fermentable carbohydrates on fermentation and better co-digestion conditions were the focus of this study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Coffee waste,"2.1 Coffee waste Coffee wastewater, pulp and husk were collected in ‘‘Da Lagoa’’ farm (Pedregulho, São Paulo, Brazil), dried, ground, and stored according to Villa-Montoya et al. (Tables S2 and S3, Supplementary Material) [25]."
3,Microbial consortium,"2.2 Microbial consortium Autochthonous microbial consortium was obtained from wastewater, pulp and husk by simulating the coffee wet processing (Fig. S1, Supplementary Material). 1 L of Arabica type coffee beans was kept for 24 h in a glass container with 2 L of water. Pulp and husk were removed from the beans manually. The resulting liquid (wastewater) was filtered in a 2 mm mesh. Pulp and husk were mixed and transferred to oven at 60 °C until drying. From these liquid and solid wastes, batch reactors were operated in order to obtain autochthonous microbial consortium, under the conditions: wastewater 3.5 g COD/L, pulp and husk waste 2 g/L, extract of yeast 1 g/L and without pH adjustment (~4.9). Duran® bottles were used as reactors, gradually increasing its volume from 250 mL (R1) to 500 mL (R2), 1 L (R3-R4) and 2 L (R5). 60% (R1) and 50% headspace (R2-R5) was maintained under N2 atmosphere (100%). The batch reactors were closed with butyl cap and plastic thread and incubated at 35 °C without stirring. The biomass from each reactor was recovered by centrifugation (R1-R3) or sedimentation (R4-R5), and then resuspended in a new substrate containing wastewater, pulp, husk and yeast extract. Biomass was transferred from R1 to R2, later from R2 to R3, and successively up to R5. A microbial consortium from R5 was used for the bio-augmentation of the reactors during fermentative assays."
4,Hydrothermal pretreatment,"2.3 Hydrothermal pretreatment For the pulp and husk waste hydrothermal pretreatment, we utilized the system described by Villa-Montoya et al. [25] with the objective of evaluating a lower severity with ground waste (3.2–3.5) (G, particle size 0.05–1.2 mm) and higher (3.6–4.2) with in natura waste (N), according to the equation of Overend and Chornet, (Eq. (1) and Table 1 ) [26]. (1) l o g ( R o ) = log ( t . e x p T − T r e f 14,75 ) where Ro is the severity factor, t is the holding time (minutes), T is the reaction temperature (°C), Tref is the reference temperature (100 °C). The hydrothermal reactor was operated in batch, it was fed with 3 g of pulp and husk waste and water until reaching the maximum capacity (200 mL). After pretreatment, the reactor was opened for material removal (<100 °C), washed and fed again with water, pulp and husk. The solid fraction (pretreated pulp and husk) and liquid (or hydrolyzed, denoted as L) were separated by sieving (2 mm). The solid waste was transferred to oven for drying at 60 °C (Fig. S2, Supplementary Material)."
5,Fermentation,"2.4 Fermentation Wastes from the coffee farm were used as substrates, such as wastewater (W), pulp and husk waste in natura (N), ground pulp and husk waste (G), in natura pulp and husk (N3.6–4.2 of severity) or ground (G3.2–3.5) and pretreated in hydrothermal system, liquid fraction of the hydrothermal reactor at different severities (L3.2-4.2), as well as a mixture of these residues as described in Table 1. Fermentation was performed in a 100 mL reactor with 50% headspace under N2 atmosphere (100%). The wastewater and liquid fraction were adjusted to pH 6.0 and subsequently mixed with in natura or pretreated pulp and husk. 10% (v/v) of the autochthonous microbial consortium (0.5 g VSS/L-Volatile Suspended Solids) and 1 g/L of yeast extract were added. The reactors were capped with butyl cap and plastic thread and incubated at 35 °C without stirring."
6,Physicochemical and chromatographic analysis,"2.5 Physicochemical and chromatographic analysis Solid waste (in natura or pretreated pulp and husk) and liquids (wastewater and liquid fraction) were characterized by analyzing the total solids (TS) and total volatile solids (STV) [27], total carbohydrates [28] and phenol [29]. Wastes collected from the farm (wastewater, pulp and husk) were additionally characterized by total nitrogen, total phosphorus, iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese, sodium, calcium and potassium analyses [27]. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH of the wastewater and liquid fraction from hydrothermal reactor were determined [27]. Organic acids, alcohols, furfural and HMF were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [30]. The analysis of carbohydrate composition was done according to Ahmad et al. [31]. Before analyzing the liquid fractions by HPLC, the samples were subjected to 697 μL H2SO4 (72% w/w), 1 h in autoclave (120 °C-1 atm), neutralized with pure CaCO3, recovered in CHROMABOND® C18ec cartridge and filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter. Prior to characterization of pulp and husk waste from the farm, the extractives were removed using cyclohexane:ethanol (1:1) for 5 h and distilled water for 1 h. To determine the phenol in the pulp and husk, extraction was carried out by adding 8 mL of methanol solution (50%) at pH 2.0 for each 1 g of pulp and husk, subjected to ultrasound for 10 min and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected in a 50 mL volumetric flask and the pellet containing the pulp and husk was submitted 3 times to the same procedure. The same steps were performed using 8 mL of acetone per 1 g of pulp and husk, adding the supernatant in the same 50 mL volumetric flask. The solution volume was adjusted to 50 mL, and the phenol content in the pulp and husk was determined [29]. Klason lignin, soluble lignin (measured at a wavelength of 205 nm) and ashes [32] were determined in the pulp and husk waste from the farm in natura, after the hydrothermal pretreatment. During the lignin analysis, the lignocellulosic material was hydrolyzed [32]. From this hydrolysate, the carbohydrates were identified by HPLC [31]. The monosaccharides were corrected with a hydration factor of 0.88 for pentoses (xylose/arabinose) and 0.9 for hexoses (glucose/galactose/mannose) for obtaining glucan, xylan, galactan, arabinan and mannan. Samples were collected from the liquid phase of reactors at the beginning and end of the fermentation to determine pH, phenol and total carbohydrates. Remaining substrate volume in the reactors was manually agitated with glass beads to remove the biomass adhered to the plant material, and filtrated with 7.5 μm porosity membrane to separate the fermented pulp and husk (solid phase of the reactors). Klason lignin and carbohydrate composition were determined by HPLC (Shimadzu®) [31]. The H2 gas quantification was performed by gas chromatography (GC 2010, Shimadzu®) [30]. Gas H2 results in mol were transformed to volume knowing that 1 mol of H2 corresponding to 22.4 L in standard conditions for temperature and pressure (0 °C and 1 atm). The organic acids, alcohols, furfural and HMF were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu®) [30]."
7,Kinetic and statistical analysis,"2.6 Kinetic and statistical analysis The results of the H2 accumulated production (H) were adjusted to the modified Gompertz model (Eq. (2)) [33] using the OriginPro 5.8 software, which were employed to estimate the maximum H2 production potential (P, mL) at time (t), maximum H2 production rate (Rm, mL/h) and time to start the H2 production (λ, h) (e = 2.718281828). (2) H = P . exp { − exp [ R m . e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } P results from each reactor were used to perform the Kruskal Wallis and Tukey's range test (α = 0.05) using the Statgraphics Centurion XVI program."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Raw waste fermentation,"3.1 Raw waste fermentation In relation to wastes without pretreatment (Fig. 1 , Tables 1 and 2 and S2, Supplementary Material), such as wastewater (W), ground (G) or in natura (N) pulp and husk waste and co-digestion of both (WG/WN), the highest P of 3.0 and 2.9 mL H2 and Rm of 0.6 and 0.3 mL H2/h were observed in the fermentation of WG and W, respectively, which had very similar values. On the other hand, when the pulp and husk waste was used individually (G/N), H2 production was lower (0.8 and 1.2 mL H2, respectively), therefore, the mixture with wastewater had a positive effect for fermentation (see Fig. 2). Higher carbohydrate availability was observed in the wastewater (2833 mg/L, Table S2) and pulp and husk waste (18.7% glucan, 1% galactan, 4% arabinan), and their removal in the liquid (65%–82% for WG and WN) and solid phase (initial 33% and final 8% in WN). The main carbohydrates consumed in the pulp and husk waste of the reactors were glucan (18% in G), xylan (8% in G) and arabinan (1% in G/N/WG), while in the liquid phase they were arabinose (from 54 to 27 mg/L) and mannose (from 40 to 30 mg/L). Probably, cellulase, xylanase, arabinose, and mannanase were synthesized by the microbial consortium (Fig. S1), which catalyzed the different carbohydrates transformation into monosaccharides [34,35]. Higher velocity to start the fermentation was verified by the wastewater addition, since for N higher λ (16.9 h) was observed and for WN and WG lower λ (6.6 and 10.5 h). Sikora et al. verified that lactic and acetic acid stimulates H2 production and favors the change of fermentation routes for the butyric acid production [36]. These organic acids were observed in the wastewater characterization and probably stimulated the fermentation process under co-digestion conditions. Pulp and husk waste milling favored the fermentation, since particle size decrease and surface area increase available for the microbial action occurred. This was evident for higher Rm (0.2 mL H2/h) and lower λ (12.5 h) in G when compared to N (0.1 mL H2/h and 16.9 h, respectively). Yeh et al. evaluated the effect of particle size on the enzymatic hydrolysis (commercial cellulase) of cotton cellulose, and verified higher hydrolysis rate for a smaller particle size [37]. For example, for 25.5 and 0.78 μm particles, hydrolysis rates of 0.076 and 0.304 g/L.h were obtained, respectively [37]. Phenol initial concentrations of 34–67 mg/L were observed in raw waste. At the end of fermentation phenol increase was observed in reactors G, N and WN (41 ± 7 to 54 ± 8 mg/L). This was a consequence of the hydrolysis process with lignin solubilization from the pulp and husk to the liquid phase. When the hemicellulose and cellulose are degraded, lignin depolymerisation occurs with increase of free phenol concentration by rupturing β-O-4 bonds [39]. Therefore, lignin increase in the in natura waste from 22.9% to >29% at the end of fermentation, probably due to microbial hydrolytic activity on the pulp and husk. Also, Ahmad et al. report that the percentage of lignin and other macromolecules (such as cellulose or hemicellulose) increases in the solid fraction due to solubilization of lignocellulosic components from the liquid fraction [22]. For reactors G and WG phenol removal was observed (from 52 ± 20 to 44 ± 2 mg/L), possibly due to its degradation for H2 production (Eq. (3), Table S4) mainly in reactor W, where the total dissolved carbohydrates consumption was only 4%. Furfural was not detected at the beginning of the fermentation, except for reactor W (44 mg/L). At the end of fermentation between 12 and 45 mg/L was observed. The furfural determination in reactors W, G, W, N and WN was not expected, since furfural is a product of the carbohydrates degradation (such as xylose, glucose and arabinose) during lignocellulosic pretreatment to high temperature and pressure [22,40], and these reactors were fed with substrates without pretreatment. HMF was not detected in all batch reactors at the beginning and end of the fermentation (except G, initial 0.3 mg/L). Probably, differences in the HMF concentration are related to the nature of lignocellulosic substrates [23]."
10,Fermentation of pretreated pulp and husk waste,"3.2 Fermentation of pretreated pulp and husk waste For the fermentative reactors with pulp and husk waste obtained from the hydrothermal pretreatment (G3.2-3.5/N3.6–4.2, Table 2 , Fig. S3), similar Rm was observed (0.1–0.2 mL H2/h). Additionally, minimum P was verified in N4.2 (1.0 mL H2), and maximal in G3.4 (1.9 mL H2). In G3.4 with higher P, in pulp and husk there was a removal of 12%, 4%, 1% and 4% of glucans, xylans, galactans and arabinans, respectively. While in N4.2 with lower P only 3%, 6% and 1% removal of glucan, xylan and arabinan, respectively, were obtained. Thus, in all reactors constitutional carbohydrates of pulp and husk decreased due to cellulose and hemicellulose transformation into liquid and gaseous products. The ground and hydrothermal pretreated pulp and husk waste provided two times higher P (1.8 mL H2 in G3.5) than that obtained with waste without pretreatment (0.8 mL H2 in G). As a consequence, there was greater sugars availability, modifying pulp and husk structure and facilitating the enzymes performance on carbohydrates [22]. Similar results were observed by Cheng et al. with H2 production increased from <1.0 to 24.96 mL H2/g TVS (TVS: Total Volatile Solids) using algal blooms biomass untreated and pretreated in a hydrothermal reactor (135 °C-15 min) + dilute acid (H2SO4 2% v/v), respectively [41]. Time to start the H2 production (λ) between 11.6 and 22.8 h were observed in reactors with pretreated pulp and husk waste, without a relationship with the pretreatment severity. Datar et al. observed λ augmented from 15 to 32 h when severity was increased from 3.1 to 4.2 due to carbohydrate loss for transformation into inhibitory compounds [42]. The authors operated batch reactors at 35 °C and pH 5.5, with liquid fraction from the steam-explosion of corn stover and anaerobic digester sludge as inoculum. It can be inferred that inhibitor concentrations such as phenol (17–52 mg/L) and furfural (18–81 mg/L) in reactors with pretreated pulp and husk did not negatively affect the time to start the fermentation. There was lower initial concentration of phenolic inhibitors in G3.2 (17 mg/L) and proportional increase with the pretreatment severity until reaching a maximum value in N4.2 (52 mg/L). There was no relationship between phenolic compounds and H2 production, since for reactors with lower (17 mg/L in G3.2) and higher initial phenol concentration (33 mg/L in N3.6) similar P (1.3 and 1.2 mL) and Rm (0.2 and 0.1 mL H2/h) were obtained. Furfural was not detected at the beginning and between 16 and 81 mg/L at the end of fermentation for reactors with pretreated pulp and husk waste (G3.2-3.5/N3.6–4.2, Fig. S3). There was no furfural negative effect, since P 1.8 mL H2 was obtained in reactors with lower (16 mg/L in G3.4) and higher furfural (81 mg/L in G3.5). Probably, the low furfural concentration was not enough to affect the fermentation. For example, Akobi et al. observed H2 production 279, 346 and 171 mL H2 with furfural 0, 1 and 4 g/L, respectively [43]. The authors concluded that 1 g/L of this compound did not cause inhibition of microorganisms, with 19% higher H2 production. In relation to lignin for the reactors G3.2-3.5/N3.6–4.2, between 25% and 37% was observed at the beginning and between 31% and 41% at the end of fermentation, due to carbohydrates removal (between 10% and 29%) that increasing its proportion in the pulp and husk. There were no lignin Klason differences in reactors fed with in natura or ground waste, since lignin increase of ~4% was observed for G3.5 and N4.2. This result was not expected, since as verified for the raw wastes, lower particle size allows increased enzyme activity [37]. There was a relation between the H2 production and initial lignin Klason in the pulp and husk, since a higher P was obtained with lower lignin (1.9 mL H2 and 26%, respectively in G3.4) and lower P with higher lignin content (1.0 mL H2 and 36%, respectively in N4.2). This result was different from Asadi and Zilouei, who observed similar H2 production 14.05 and 16.24 mL H2/g with lignin contents in pretreated rice straw ~60% and ~48% [44]. According to the authors, the delignification process consists of two steps: 1) lignin rupture in small fragments and ii) fragments solubilization into the liquid phase, which affect the carbohydrate composition of the lignocellulosic waste, enzymatic degradability and H2 production. Thus, differences in results may be associated with the residues delignification level. For pretreated coffee pulp and husk, lignin probably restricts the enzymes access due to their fragmentation without solubilization, and consequently the increase of their content in some reactors. For pretreated rice straw, absence of limitations in the lignin solubilization was observed, not affecting H2 production."
11,Fermentations of liquid fractions,"3.3 Fermentations of liquid fractions In relation to fermentation of liquid fractions from pulp and husk pretreatment (L3.2-4.2, Table 2 and Fig. S2), P increased from 1.6 to 2.3 mL H2 with carbohydrates 509 and 838 mg/L, respectively. The carbohydrates observed were arabinose, mannose and fructose, with a higher concentration for pretreatment severity ranging between 3.9 and 4.2 (from 76 to 171 mg/L). This result was similar to that observed by Muri et al. during batch reactors operation fed with mono and disaccharides [45]. The authors observed an increase in H2 production from 0.4 to 1.4 mol H2/mol glucose with increasing carbohydrates from 1 to 5 g/L, respectively. The highest and lowest Rm were observed in liquid fraction from low (L3.2 with 0.7 mL H2/h) and higher severity (L3.6 at 0.1 mL H2/h). Similar results were observed by Gonzales et al. during fermentation of palm fruit bunch, rice husk, and pine tree wood pretreated, lower Rm due to the increase in pretreatment severity from 1.95 to 2.19 [46]. The low inhibitors production due to lesser pretreatment severity, explains the higher biogas production rates [31,46]. In relation to phenol, no correlation was observed with regard to the pretreatment severity for reactors with liquid fraction, which was 230 and 153 mg/L for severity of 3.2 and 4.2, respectively. There was no relation between phenols and P, since higher (2.3 mL H2 in L3.6) and lower value (1.6 mL H2 in L3.2) was observed for 249 ± 27 mg phenol/L. However, the λ of 13.4 and 74.5 h were observed for initial phenol 199 (L3.4) and 268 mg/L (L3.6), respectively. Cao et al. evaluated the effect of phenolic compounds concentration on H2 production [47]. The λ increased from 2.5 to 20 h with syringaldehyde 0.06 and 0.35 g/L, respectively. The authors reported that even at lower concentration of phenolic compounds, considered to be non-inhibitory, the synergistic effect with other inhibitors (such as furfural) can enhance the phenol toxicity. Furfural was not detected in the fermentation of hydrothermal liquid fractions (L3.2-4.2), except for L3.9, thus, it was not possible to relate this compound with H2 production. Liquid fractions may not be interesting for H2 production since the most fermentable material (cellulose) is present in the pulp and husk. Although, in order to take advantage of all available fermentable sugars, the mixing of the liquid fraction and pretreated pulp and husk may favor a greater amount of substrates available for microbial consortium."
12,Co-digestion of liquid fractions and pretreated pulp and husk waste,"3.4 Co-digestion of liquid fractions and pretreated pulp and husk waste For reactors containing both materials recovered from the hydrothermal system (GL3.2-3.5/NL3.6–4.2) higher P (2.3 mL H2 for GL3.2/GL3.4) and Rm (0.3 mL H2/h for GL3.2/GL3.) to lowest pretreatment severity was observed. In several cases, higher P was observed for co-digestion (1.8–2.3 mL H2, GL3.2-3.5/NL3.6–4.2) when compared to individual wastes, such as liquid fraction (1.4–2.3 mL H2, L3.2-4.2) or pretreated pulp and husk (1.0–1.9 mL H2, G3.2-3.5/N3.6–4.2). This was due to higher initial concentration of dissolved carbohydrates (546–819 mg/L) and their consumption (9–53%). In relation to carbohydrates of pulp and husk, greater removal for NL4.2 (glucan 36%/xylan 6%/galactan 1%/mannan 1%) was obtained, with lower H2 production (1.8 mL H2), possibly due to the production of soluble metabolites such as ethanol (34%), propionic acid (7%) and butyric acid (16%). A higher initial phenol concentration was verified during mixture of the hydrothermal system fractions, which were 242 ± 39 mg/L (GL3.2-3.5/NL3.6–4.2). Similarly, phenol increased with pretreatment severity that ranged from 220 (GL3.2) to 300 mg/L (NL4.2). However, higher phenols concentration had no negative effect on fermentation, since λ between 9.4 and 53.4 h was observed, equal to or less than that observed with only one substrate. Phenol concentration removal was observed in reactors GL3.2, GL3.4 and GL3.5 from 210 ± 10 to 191 ± 19 mg/L, possibly for use in H2 production (Eq. (3)), with higher P between 2.2 and 2.3 mL H2 verified in the reactors with these conditions [38]. Pulp and husk lignin was not related to H2 production, since P 2.3 mL H2 was obtained for minor (26% in GL3.4) and higher lignin content (37% in NL3.6). Similar to that described by Asadi and Zilouei , it is possible that lignin did not affect the substrates access under different pretreatment conditions [44]."
13,Co-digestion of wastewater and pretreated pulp and husk waste,"3.5 Co-digestion of wastewater and pretreated pulp and husk waste For reactors with co-digestion of pretreated solid waste and wastewater (WG3.2-3.5/WN3.6–4.2) there was a higher initial concentration of dissolved carbohydrates (185–515 mg/L) when compared to reactors containing only pulp and husk (181–275 mg/L). High carbohydrate availability may have contributed to the highest P (2.7–8.0 mL H2) and Rm (0.3–0.8 mL H2/h) in all conditions studied. Muri et al. observed P 261 and 191 mL H2 and Rm 59 and 25 mL H2/h from hexoses and pentoses, respectively [45]. 47 ± 23 mg/L of hexoses and 39 ± 8 mg/L of pentoses were observed at the beginning of coffee wastes co-digestion. By means of pulp and husk addition at beginning of fermentation polymeric sugars availability were observed, such as glucan (27 ± 9%), xylan (7 ± 1%), galactan (1 ± 0.1%), arabinan (4 ± 2%), and mannan (3 ± 1%). At the end of fermentation a lower value was verified, as a consequence of its hydrolysis (20% glucan/0.4% xylan/0.6% galactan/0.9% arabinan/mannan not detected). In addition, higher hemicellulose removal was observed (13%) when compared to cellulose (7% glucan). This result was similar to that observed by Nguyen et al. , with glucose removal 72.95% (cellulose constituent) and xylose 95.74% (hemicellulose constituent) and 112.38 mL H2/Ld in batch reactors fed with pretreated rice straw and Thermotoga neapolitana [48]. This may have been a consequence of lower cellulose accessibility, since lignin and hemicellulose are physical barriers to the action of cellulase [49]. Lower λ was observed in reactors with ground pulp and husk waste (14.1 ± 2 h in WG3.2-3.5) when compared to in natura (20.5 ± 4 h in WN3.6–4.2). This result was a consequence of lignocellulosic waste size reduction, which increases the affinity between the cellulose and enzymes, and consequently, the microbial adaptation to the substrates [37]. Rm of 5-fold higher was observed in reactors with co-digestion of pretreated pulp and husk + wastewater (0.6 ± 0.2 mL H2/h, WG3.2-3.5/WN3.6–4.2) when compared to pretreated pulp and husk (0.2 ± 0.1 mL H2/h, G3.2-3.5/N3.6–4.2), possibly due to the increase of substrates suitable for fermentation, such as dissolved carbohydrates from 229 ± 37 to 385 ± 110 mg/L. Again, a positive effect of coffee waste co-digestion on H2 production was observed. Phenolic compounds and H2 production were no related, since higher (8 mL H2 in WG3.5) and lower P (4.9 mL H2 in WN3.6) were observed for reactors with initial and final phenol of 50 and 60 mg/L, respectively. Thus, the phenols were not degraded during fermentation. Sharma and Melkania used organic fraction of municipal solid waste with addition of phenolic compounds [50]. The authors observed H2 production decrease from 178.3–194.2 to 11.1–21.5 mL H2, with vanillin and syringaldehyde, due to the concentration increase from 0.25 to 5 g/L. Low initial phenols concentration (<50 mg/L) and degradation of other waste constituents during fermentation can justify the absence of deleterious effect of phenols and differential H2 production in reactors with coffee pulp and husk. P of 8 and 2.7 mL H2 with lower (25% in WG3.5) and higher (37% in WN3.9) lignin content in pulp and husk were observed, respectively. For reactors with pretreated pulp and husk (G3.2-3.5/N3.6–4.2) lignin may limit cellulose and hemicellulose transformation into biogas [49], with an inverse relationship between the lignin content in lignocellulosic waste and H2 production. There was no effect of furfural on H2 production, obtaining P 5 mL H2 for 40 mg/L furfural (WN3.6). Similar results were observed in the study of Sharma and Melkania, obtaining 208.1, 245.3 and 106.9 mL H2 for not detected, 0.25 and 5 g/L of furfural, respectively [50]. Furfural concentrations in pretreated coffee wastes were lower than that needed to affect the fermentation (<40 mg/L)."
14,"Co-digestion of wastewater, pretreated pulp and husk waste and liquid fractions","3.6 Co-digestion of wastewater, pretreated pulp and husk waste and liquid fractions Higher values of P and Rm were observed for reactors with waste pretreatment to lowest severity (3.8 ± 0.9 mL H2 and 0.5 ± 0.1 mL H2/h, respectively, WGL3.2-3.5) and lower with higher severity (3.5 ± 0.3 mL H2 and 0.3 mL H2/h, respectively, WNL3.6–4.2). According to Dos Santos et al. , more biodegradable residues are obtained with less pretreatment severity [16]. The authors found higher H2 production of 48.5 mL H2/g COD at 13.7 minutes-18.5 mgO3/g and less than 40.2 mL H2/g COD to 60 minutes-81 mgO3/g. The time to start the H2 production was similar (18 ± 3 h) in all reactors with wastewater, pretreated pulp and husk and liquid fraction. Cao et al. reported higher λ with increasing inhibitory compounds [47]. Therefore, low deleterious effect of inhibitory compounds produced at different pretreatment severities was inferred in reactors fed with 3 coffee wastes (wastewater, pretreated pulp/husk and liquid fraction). The removal of dissolved carbohydrates was not related to H2 production. There was a removal of 40% in reactors with higher (4.7 mL H2) and lower P (2.9 mL H2). Gonzales et al. observed sugars removal of 88% for higher and lower H2 production (2960 and 3340 mL H2/Ld) in reactor fed with pretreated rice [46]. According to the authors, the maximum sugars consumption was not associated with higher H2 production due to the presence of inhibitory compounds, which negatively affected the transformation of carbohydrates into biogas. Higher P and Rm values were observed during co-digestion of pretreated pulp and husk with wastewater (4.7 ± 1.9 m H2 and 0.6 ± 0.2 mL H2/L, respectively), when compared to 3 residues (3.6 ± 0.6 mL H2 and 0.4 mL H2/L, respectively, for wastewater + pretreated pulp/husk + liquid fraction). This is because the initial concentration of dissolved carbohydrates decreased from 385 ± 110 (WG3.2-3.5/WN3.6–4.2) to 334 ± 21 mg/L when the liquid fraction was added to reactors (WGL3.2-3.5/WNL3.6–4.2). Similarly, the initial phenol concentration was higher in the reactors with 3 wastes (103 ± 21 mg/L for wastewater + pretreated pulp/husk + liquid fraction) compared to reactors with pretreated pulp and husk + wastewater (55 ± 14 mg/L), due to the increase of inhibitors by the addition of liquid fraction from hydrothermal pretreatment. This is because phenol concentrations ranging between 598 and 2032 mg/L were observed in liquid fractions, which may have contributed to better H2 production in the reactors where this fraction was not added. At the end of fermentation, phenols increased in most of the reactors with 3 wastes (from 93 ± 10 to 117 ± 40 mg/L). In fermentations containing carbohydrates and phenol, there is a preferential carbohydrates degradation [51], which may explain the absence of phenol degradation and lower H2 production in reactors with addition of liquid fraction with phenol concentrations >598 mg/L. Lignin was not related to H2 production, with P 3.8 mL H2 in reactors with pulp and husk with higher (37% in WNL3.9) and lower lignin content (25% in GWL3.5). This result was not expected, since as discussed earlier, lignin can impede the transformation of cellulose and hemicellulose into biogas [44]. When compared to other studies, operational differences may have contributed to these results, due to the effect of co-digestion, microbial consortium bio-augmentation, or pretreatment of substrates. In reactors with pulp and husk pretreated at high severity, furfural was observed at the end of fermentation (from not detected to 45 ± 7 mg/L). However, the H2 production was not impaired by furfural, since P 3.8 mL H2 was obtained in reactors with lower (not detected) and higher furfural concentration (52 mg/L) at the end of fermentation. Akobi et al. found H2 production inhibition from furfural concentrations >1 g/L [43]. The maximum H2 production 0.02 L H2/L.h was lower than that observed in other batch reactors with coffee wastes (~0.31 L H2/L.h, Table S1), because the substrate concentrations used by the authors were higher (9.8–20 g COD/L) compared to this study (3.5 g COD/L). However, the yield (1.4 mol H2/mol hexose) was similar (0.3–2.6 mol H2/mol hexose). In this context, higher substrate concentrations may improve H2 production in future studies."
15,Organic acids and alcohols production,"For reactors with raw wastes (W/G/WG/N/WN), lactic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric and isovaleric acids and ethanol were observed at the beginning of fermentation (2–32%, Table S6, Supplementary Material). These compounds originated during wastewater pre-acidification in the storage pond and pulp and husk waste drying in the sun, in which the highest lactic acid concentrations were observed, between 4 and 14%. Lactic acid production (73%) was observed by Jung et al. during coffee manufacturing wastewater auto-fermentation (20 g COD/L) in batch reactors at 35 °C [12]. Ethanol production between 4% and 34% was observed in G3.2, G3.5, N3.6, L3.2, WGL3.5, and NL4.2, reactions with carbohydrates consumption (42 ± 11% in liquid phase) (Eq. (4), Table S4, Supplementary Material). In most of the reactors there was a concentration dismissing for lactic acid (up to 16%, Table S6), ethanol (up to 8%) and propionic acid (up to 8%), possibly for conversion to H2 and acetic acid (Eqs. (5)–(7)). Probably, the participation of acting microorganisms allowed the increase of acetic acid (2–16%), mainly in reactors with pretreated pulp and husk (10% in WN3.6). Similarly, bicarbonate synthesis through lactic acid and propionic acid consumption (Eqs. (5) and (7)) may explain the increase in pH observed in most reactors. Increase in acetic acid concentrations may have been caused by glucose or other carbohydrates degradation (Eq. (8)). This may occur mainly in reactors using only pretreated pulp and husk waste, with a higher acetic acid production (5% and 17%, Table S6) and dissolved carbohydrates removal (16% and 61%). This also confirms that the pretreated pulp and husk waste may be a suitable substrate for H2 production, especially G3.5, where a 17% increase in acetic acid content was observed. Lactic acid consumption (initial 8 ± 5% and final 1 ± 1%) and butyric acid synthesis (initial 4 ± 5% and final 18 ± 7%) with H2 production (Eqs. (9) and (10)) may have occurred in all reactors (except W/L3.2), due to evident high lactic acid availability in wastewater (7256 mg/L). Chojnacka et al. observed 2.8–5.4 mol H2/mol sucrose and 4331–7641 mg/L butyric acid production from sucrose, with a relative abundance of 9% for Clostridiacea and 25% for Leuconostocaeae [52]. Formic acid production was not verified in most of the reactors (except in G/GL3.5/WGL3.5/WN4.2, <2%, Table S6) regardless of the type of substrate and pretreatment. Propionic acid production between 1% and 11% was observed (Table S6). This organic acid may not favor H2 production (Eq. (11), Table S4, Supplementary Material), explaining the low P 2.2 and 1.1 mL H2 in GL3.5 and N3.9, respectively, with evidence of carbohydrate consumption >34%. Decrease of isobutyric acid was observed in all reactors (initial 15 ± 7% and final 5 ± 3%), except for W and L3.6. Some authors mention microorganisms with isomerization capacity of isobutyric acid to butyric acid, and later their degradation into acetic acid [53]. In most reactors butyric acid was between 1% and 27% at the end of fermentation. This metabolite may increase with the H2 co-production (Eq. (12), Table S4, Supplementary Material), as observed for higher P in reactors with two and three substrates (1.1–8.0 mL H2, reactors WG/WN/WG3.2-3.5/WN3.6–4.2/WGL3.2-3.5/WNL3.6–4.2), where the minimum butyric acid production was 20%. This reaction is thermodynamically favorable, which is an energy source for the microbial consortium, which could justify the acetogenesis (Eqs. (5)–(7), Table S4, Supplementary Material). The increase of isovaleric acid, between 1% and 18%, was observed in some reactors (Table S6). Production of this acid (similar to valeric acid) was related to H2 consumption [54], justifying lower P (1.1–1.9 mL H2) with higher isovaleric acid production (12%) in reactors with only raw or pretreated pulp and husk waste. When all substrates were compared, it was not possible to establish a direct relationship between the organic acids and alcohols production and the pretreatment severity of pulp and husk. However, the main soluble metabolites observed were acetic acid (17% in G3.5) and butyric acid (27% in WN3.6), both related to the H2 co-generation, evidencing the potential of these substrates for metabolism of H2-producing bacteria. Acetic, butyric and isovaleric acids and ethanol formed during fermentation have important potential for the production of biofuel, plastic, solvent, resin, food additive, cosmetic and pharmaceutics products, thus representing a commercial application with economic vantages for the coffee industry and lower environmental impact of coffee wastes [55]."
16,Conclusions,"• Wastewater and pretreated pulp and husk co-digestion led to higher H2 production compared to in natura waste, due to the increased concentration and diversity of carbohydrate sources, with low inhibitors such as phenols and furfural. • Intermediated pretreatment severity allowed more biodegradable pulp and husk and low generation of inhibitory products, favouring the H2 production. • Autochthonous microorganisms from coffee waste fermented monosaccharides and polysaccharides from lignocellulose in pulp and husk, with productions of H2, ethanol, acetic and butyric acid with several commercial applications. • Coffee waste co-digestion (wastewater, pulp and husk) favored a decrease in the time to start the H2 production, an increase in maximum H2 production rate, and butyric and acetic acid production related to high H2 yield routes. • The use of agricultural wastes is an alternative as it achieves greater mass transfer through solid-liquid fermentation, substrate availability and mainly bioenergy production potential."
