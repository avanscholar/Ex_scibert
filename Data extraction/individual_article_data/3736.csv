0,Introduction,"Due to rising energy demands and environmental considerations, there is now increased interest towards the development of alternative fuels from renewable energy sources. Hydrogen has been identified as a leading primary energy carrier to supplement or replace fossil fuels with a cleaner, more sustainable alternative [1]. One promising method for hydrogen production could come from the direct gasification of biomass, which is a CO2-neutral process with the carbon by-product (CO2) and energy originating from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. However, developing technologies in biomass gasification, such as using autoclave systems and fluidized bed gasifiers, often encounter inefficiencies associated with the high moisture content of many biomass feedstocks [2] as well as the production of tar, char, and other residues [3]. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) has been identified as an efficient gasification process for biomass feed stocks that have a moisture content above 40% [4]. SCWG is basically a hydrothermal conversion of a material into gaseous products at conditions that exceed the thermodynamic critical point of water (374°C and 22.1MPa). One advantage of SCWG of biomass is that the use of water as a reaction solvent eliminates the need for drying the biomass which increases the overall thermal efficiency of the process. Another advantage of SCWG is that supercritical water has the ability to dissolve the organic biomass components allowing for hydrolysis to break down the polymeric biomass structure as opposed to pyrolysis used in conventional gasification [5]. A properly engineered SCWG system can recover 92% of the chemical energy from the biomass in the gaseous products, and produce 4.5J of energy for every 1J of energy lost in the system [6]. SCWG has been shown to produce useful gas streams from a wide variety of biomass feedstocks and we note a recent review by Guo et al. illustrating several examples of using SCWG of biomass for the production of hydrogen [7]. Recently there has been interest in using catalysts to improve the SCWG technology [8,9]. Among those nickel has been shown to be a very useful metal catalyst for biomass gasification [10]. Depending on the type of nickel catalyst and the reaction conditions, nickel can produce a methane-rich product stream as well as syngas [10,11], which is very useful depending on the desired products of the gasification process. In a SCWG process (with excess water), nickel catalyzes the water-gas shift reaction to help produce H2 and eliminate CO [12–14]. It has also been shown that the addition of noble metals (i.e. platinum), to a nickel catalyst can assist in the removal of tar from a steam gasification process [15]. Meanwhile, a variety of mixed oxides (i.e. Al2O3, and CeO2 and MgO) have been chosen as supports for catalysts for SCWG under a variety of different reaction conditions [16]. Minowa demonstrated that silica–alumina is an effective support for nickel catalyst in SCWG of biomass [13]. Carbon-supported catalysts have also been shown to be stable in a SCWG environment for gasifying glucose and cellulose [11]. In one example Lee and Ihm reported on glucose gasification using activated carbon-supported nickel catalysts [17]. In another example, Hao et al. [18] gasified cellulose in supercritical water using ruthenium and palladium supported on activated carbon as catalysts. Another carbon catalyst support that is becoming more attractive for heterogeneous catalysis is nanostructured carbon in the form of carbon fibers (CF) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Their hollow geometry and high surface area, along with their electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties make them very suitable for a heterogeneous catalyst support [19]. Different synthesis methods and catalytic applications for metals on CNTs have previously been reported [20]. The majority of these synthesis methods require a functionalization of the nanotube surface before the metals can be deposited due to the hydrophobic inert surface of the nanotubes [20–22]. Methods of functionalization include acidic oxidation [23–25], UV/microwave treatments [26,27] and surface activation [28,29]. Most of these treatments can take over 24h, are extremely harsh energetically, and can chemically produce hazardous aqueous wastes [30–34]. Some of these harsh conditions have been shown to introduce defects (damage) to the nanotube structure [35]. A more environmentally friendly method for the deposition of metals on CNTs is to use supercritical fluids as a reaction medium. For example, Sun et al. demonstrated that supercritical methanol could facilitate wetting of the CNTs with the metal precursor while also enabling metallic nuclei formation or homogeneous deposition of Pt and Ru particles on the surface of the CNTs [36]. They also state that the positive metal ions formed in the supercritical methanol may be preferably absorbed on the imperfect sites of the CNTs as well as their electrostatic absorption. Our previous work has also shown that supercritical methanol could be used to create platinum catalysts on carbon supports such as carbon black [37], carbon fibers, and CNTs [38,39]. We also investigated how various parameters (i.e. temperature, pressure, etc.) can affect the average particle size and ultimately the fuel cell performance of these catalyst materials [39]. In this work we present supercritical methanol as a reaction medium for the creation of Ni/carbon and Ni/SiAl catalysts. Alcohols tend to dissociate on the surface of transitional metals forming adsorbed alkoxide intermediates and surface hydrogen [40]. Hence, methanol can act as a solvent and reducing agent for the organometallic precursor to create useful CNT-supported metal catalysts. Previously, we reported on the SCWG of methanol, phenol, guaiacol and glycine using Ni wire as a catalyst [41–43]. Here we also demonstrate that the synthesized Ni catalysts can be used in the supercritical water gasification of cellulose, a major component of woody biomass, into a hydrogen-rich product stream. Furthermore, the catalysts are compared to other Ni-based catalysts on their performance as a hydrogen producing catalyst through the SCWG of cellulose."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Catalyst preparation and Ni loading measurement,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and Ni loading measurement This work uses supercritical methanol, that acts as a reaction medium and a reducing agent, to synthesize carbon-supported nickel catalysts. The methanol (CHROMASOLV, >99.9%) was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich. Nickel acetylacetonate (96%, from Acros Organics) was used as the precursor for the nickel metal. Catalysts were made with a carbon support in the form of carbon fibers (Pyrograf III) from Pyrograf Products Inc. or single walled carbon nanotubes from Carbon Solutions, Inc. Supercritical methanol was also used to deposit nickel onto a silica–alumina catalyst support (grade 135, Sigma–Aldrich) for comparison to a commercial catalyst from Sigma–Aldrich (65wt.% Ni on silica–alumina) and one from BASF (Ni-3288, 31wt.% nickel, 39wt.% nickel oxide). The catalysts were prepared inside a stainless steel batch reactor with an internal volume of 4.1mL. Each batch of catalyst was typically made on 35mg of support. The support (carbon fibers, SWCNT or silica–alumina) was loaded into the reactor, along with 213.5mg of the precursor. The ratio of support to precursor was chosen to create a catalyst with a nominal loading of 55wt.% of Ni. The methanol was added into the reactor (3.23mL) and the reactor was sealed. This amount of methanol was determined by the desired reaction density (0.624g/mL) which at 300°C is in the supercritical phase. Further descriptions of the reaction phase condition including high temperature methanol have been described previously [39]. The sealed reactors were placed in a fluidized sandbath (Techne) at 300°C for 30min, after which time they were removed and forced-air cooled at room temperature. When the reactors were cool, they were opened and their contents filtered (Millipore Fluoropore membrane, 1μm FA membrane) and rinsed with fresh methanol. After filtration, the catalyst material was removed from the filter membrane and allowed to dry overnight. The amount of nickel in each catalyst was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA Q 500, TA Instruments). The methods were slightly different for the different catalyst supports. The catalysts with silica–alumina supports were first reduced in the TGA furnace under a 30% H2/N2 condition by increasing the temperature from 25 to 800°C at 10°C/min. Barrio et al. [44] showed that nickel supported on silica–alumina will reduce at temperatures lower than 800°C. Following the reduction of the nickel, the nickel was oxidized fully under air to NiO with the same temperature profile. The weight gain during the oxidation is due to the addition of one oxygen atom per nickel atom. From this weight gain we were able to calculate the Ni content of the starting catalyst. The carbon-supported catalysts were only oxidized under air until a constant weight was achieved. This allowed the carbon support to burn off and leave only NiO. The nickel content of the starting catalyst was calculated from the remaining material."
3,Instrumentation,"2.2 Instrumentation A JEOL 2010F analytical electron microscope (AEM) was used for microstructure characterization of the synthesized catalysts. This microscope that can be performed in both conventional transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) modes is normally operated at 200kV. The lens conditions for STEM high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging were defined for a probe size of 0.2nm, with convergence and collection angles of 13 and 52mrad, respectively, i.e., the image can be treated to be Z-contrast image (Z here is element atomic number) [45]. For element mapping performed using characteristic X-rays, the probe size was defined to be 0.5nm. The amount of nickel in each catalyst was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA Q 500, TA Instruments). The surface area of each catalyst and their supports were measured using a seven-point BET analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectra were collected from the catalysts using a Krotos Ultra DLD XPS instrument with monochromatized Al Ka radiation at an energy resolution of ∼0.5eV from which the valence sates of Ni in the catalysts were derived. To avoid contaminations from O and C, powder samples loaded on top of pure thin indium foils were employed."
4,Cellulose gasification in supercritical water,"2.3 Cellulose gasification in supercritical water The synthesized catalysts were used to gasify cellulose in supercritical water. These supercritical water gasification (SCWG) reactions were carried out in batch reactors made of quartz to insure no catalytic effects from the reactor walls. Hence the only catalyst present was from controlled additions to the reactor. All of the SCWG experiments were conducted under identical conditions to directly compare the performance of the different catalysts. The experiments were carried out in supercritical water at 500°C with a water density of 0.08g/mL and an initial cellulose loading of 9wt.% for 15min. These experimental conditions were selected to match the noncatalytic experiments previously published by Resende et al. [46]. Quartz reactors were made from 2mm i.d., 6mm o.d. quartz tubes. These tubes were first cut to length and flame sealed at one end. The reaction materials – 43μL of deionized water, 4mg of cellulose (microcrystalline, colloidal from Aldrich) and 2.5mg of catalyst – were then loaded into the reactors. The materials were loaded in this order (water first) to help promote better mixing when the water expanded into the rest of the reactor. The reactors were then sealed to a length of 18.4cm, giving the desired reaction volume of 0.58mL. The reactors were then placed in a sandbath at 500°C for 15min. This gave the catalysts time to nearly gasify all of the biomass. They were then removed and forced-air cooled at room temperature, after which they were placed in a freezer (T =−3°C) overnight. This step was intended to prevent the water and other liquid products from entering the gas chromatographic column during analysis. The collection of the gaseous products formed in the SCWG experiments follows a procedure described previously [43]. Briefly, the quartz reactors were placed inside a metal tube (0.9cm i.d.×20cm long), which was capped at one end and sealed with a needle valve on the other. The metal tube was pressurized through the needle valve with helium to a pressure of 10psi. This was to ensure enough pressure in the tube to flush and fill the GC sample loop when the valve was opened. After pressurizing, the valve was closed, and the metal tube was struck several times to break the quartz tube inside, thus releasing the gases into the metal tube. The valve was then connected to the sample loop on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series 2 GC equipped with a Carboxen™ 1000 column and a TCD. This system separates He, H2, O2, N2, CO, CH4 and CO2 and was calibrated with several commercial gas mixtures. The GC analysis provides gas composition by mole fraction. The absolute amount of the gases produced was calculated using N2 as an internal standard. The amount of N2 is known from the air initially present in the quartz reactor and the metal tube. The yields of each of the gases (in mmol/g biomass) can be calculated from the known amount of N2 and the measured molar ratio of the gases to N2. The amount of each gas dissolved in the water at the freezer temperature was then calculated using Henry's Law. Three identical experiments were conducted for each catalyst and mean values are reported."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Nickel loading,"3.1 Nickel loading The Ni/silica–alumina catalyst supplied by Sigma was listed as having a nickel loading of 65% by weight. The TGA analysis used here confirmed that loading to be 63.3% by weight which validates the accuracy of the TGA method. The nickel loading for this and the other catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The nominal loading for the catalyst synthesized with our supercritical methanol method was 55% by weight. As shown in Table 1, this method yielded a lower loading. The loading of nickel on the carbon fibers and on the silica–alumina supports was ∼44%, while the nickel loading on carbon nanotubes was 34%. Although this loading value was lower, we observed a similar performance of these catalysts to the commercial catalysts in producing hydrogen from cellulose. These gasification results are described further below. To increase the Ni loading to a level similar to the commercial catalysts (60–70% by weight) we increased the amount of nickel precursor [Ni(acac)2]3 loaded into the reactor. These (high loading) catalysts are listed at the end of Table 1. For a nominal Ni loading of 65% for CF and 70% for CNTs we observed actual Ni loadings of 58% for CF and 55% for CNTs. Results on the surface area of each catalyst and their supports are shown in Table 2 . We observed the surface area of the carbon nanotubes to be lower (40.75m2/g) than our previous materials and attributed this difference to a change in our supplier and perhaps manufacturing process."
7,Microstructure of the synthesized catalysts,"3.2 Microstructure of the synthesized catalysts Fig. 1a–e are HAADF images taken from the Ni/CF, Ni/CNT, Ni/SiAl, Ni/SiAl (Sigma) and Ni/SiAl (BASF) catalysts, respectively. For HAADF imaging, the intensity of the image is proportional to the element atomic numbers. The brightest regions are expected to be where the Ni particles are because Ni is the heaviest element in all the catalysts. For the two carbon-supported catalysts, the main features are bright Ni nanoparticles decorated on the surface of the CF or CNTs. From these images it can be seen that the Ni particle sizes are non-homogeneous in all the three synthesized catalysts. The Ni particle sizes in the Ni/CF catalyst are in the range of several nanometers to several hundred nanometers with an average size of ca. 79nm (Fig. 2a). Most Ni particles in the synthesized Ni/CF (Fig. 1a), Ni/CNT (Fig. 1b), Ni/SiAl (Fig. 1c) are facet with some having regular or irregular polyhedron shapes. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis indicates that most Ni particles are single crystals (see the SAED along [001] inserted in the lower right corner of Fig. 1a). Nickel particle sizes in the Ni/CNT can be sorted into groups with half of them are around 10nm while another half are around 100nm with an average particle size of ca. 32nm (Fig. 2b). Most big Ni particles are also facetted but most of them are multi-twined particles. The Ni particle sizes in the Ni/SiAl catalyst are also non-homogeneous, from several nanometers to several hundred nanometers in size with some of them being facetted as shown in the insert (upper left corner of Fig. 1c). The average particle size for the Ni/SiAl is ca. 12nm (Fig. 2c). Nickel particles in the two commercial catalysts are relatively small and it is difficult to separate the Ni from the support materials. The sizes of the particles are very homogeneous less than 15nm in size. To further confirm the chemistry nature of the imaged structures, element maps were collected from the catalysts as shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3a and c are HAADF images taken from the Ni/CNT and Ni/SiAl (BASF), and Fig. 3b and d are combined element maps collected from the areas defined in Fig. 3a and c, respectively. The results show that the blue coloured Ni regions in Fig. 3b match exactly well to the bright areas in Fig. 3a. Similarly, the yellow coloured Ni regions in Fig. 3d match exactly well to the bright areas in Fig. 3c. The map results also show that all the catalysts contain oxygen. This observation is reasonable for the alumniosilicate supported catalysts because the supports have oxygen. For the two synthesized carbon-supported Ni catalysts, the detection of oxygen indicates that the Ni particles have been partially oxidized probably during exposure to air. Fig. 4 shows Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra collected from the studied catalysts with three main peaks at a binding energy of about 852.9, 856.0 and 861.3eV with small variations for the spectra collected from the different catalysts. The peak resolution can be seen more clearly in the insert that shows the curve-fitted results for the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum collected from the Ni/CF. Because the Ni/CF and Ni/CNTs are conductive samples, the spectra were calibrated using Au spectra. Whereas, the spectra collected from the three SiAl catalysts were calibrated using contaminated C 1s spectrum (the catalysts were either contaminated during processing or synthesis) by assigning its peak to 284.5eV. According to the literature, the feature that develops at the low binding energy of 852.2eV can be attributed to metallic Ni, whereas a structure that develops at 855.6eV can be attributed to Ni3+ states [47]. The feature at about 861eV is a satellite peak. Then the Ni0/Ni3+ ratios in the catalysts can be deduced from the integrated area intensity ratios of the peaks in the spectra featuring Ni0 and Ni3+. The area intensity ratios calculated from the Ni/CF and Ni/CNTs are all about to 1/2. For the synthesized Ni/SiAl and BASF catalysts, the calculated values are ca. 1/10 whereas for the Ni/SiAl (Sigma) catalyst has a value ca. of 1/12. In fact the peak heights that represents the Ni0 state are all relatively small for the three SiAl supported catalysts. This indicates that more Ni in the SiAl supported catalysts are in oxidation states than in the two carbon based catalysts. Also small left shifts (∼1eV) were observed from the spectra collected from the SiAl supported catalysts that may be due to the interactions between Ni and the supports or may be also due to the formation of some new phases."
8,Cellulose SCWG,"3.3 Cellulose SCWG The catalysts synthesized in this work were evaluated for the supercritical water gasification of cellulose. Here we observe the performance of these materials for hydrogen production, and compare them to two commercially available Ni catalysts. The synthesized catalysts were Ni on carbon fibers (Ni/CF), Ni on single walled carbon nanotubes (Ni/CNT) and Ni on silica–alumina (Ni/SiAl). The commercial catalysts were both nickel on silica–alumina from Sigma and BASF. Fig. 5 shows the yields of H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 from SCWG of cellulose with each catalyst, along with the yields of the non-catalyzed cellulose SCWG. The non-catalyzed data was obtained from Resende et al. [46]. The first point that can be interpreted from the data is that each of the catalysts increased the gasification rate significantly over the non-catalyzed reaction. Although the overall differences between the catalysts, were not as significant, the results are encouraging that the synthesized catalysts are active. All seven catalysts produced similar hydrogen yields, with the synthesized Ni/SiAl producing 4.5mmol/g and the Sigma catalyst producing 10.9mmol/g. The Sigma and BASF catalysts produced the most hydrogen (and total gas products) and this could be attributed to the higher Ni loading determined as 63 and 62wt.%, respectively. The Ni/CNT catalyst did not produce more gases or hydrogen than the Ni/CF however both carbon based catalysts produced more gases than the synthesized Ni/SiAl. When the Ni loading on each of the carbon-supported catalysts were compared at a similar loading (Ni/CNT [high] and Ni/CF [high]) the CNT-supported catalyst produced more hydrogen (and gas products) than the CF-supported catalyst. The effect of the support was evaluated and Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen yield for each support (CF, CNT and SiAl). We noted that the hydrogen yields were much lower than the yields produced by the nickel catalysts. The carbon supports are slightly active for gasification of cellulose due to the possibility of the carbon reacting with water at temperatures above 200°C [48]. As shown in Fig. 6, the H2 Yield is slightly higher for the carbon supports above SiAl and the non-catalyzed systems. Hence, we conclude that the silica–alumina support is not active in gasification under these conditions. Fig. 5 also shows the effects of increasing the nickel loading of the carbon supports on the gasification yields. When comparing the bare supports to the nickel-containing catalysts, a difference in the gaseous products was observed. The presence of nickel on both supports increases the hydrogen yield while decreasing the carbon monoxide yields. This shows the nickel catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction. However, increasing the nickel loading from 44.9 to 58.2% on the carbon fiber support and from 33.8 to 55.8% on the carbon nanotubes does not significantly change the gasification performance of the nickel catalysts. Although the synthesized catalysts produced a similar hydrogen yield to the commercial catalysts, they showed a higher hydrogen to methane (H2/CH4) product ratio under the same conditions. If the goal of the gasification is hydrogen production, optimization of a catalyst with a preferred product ratio could be useful towards understanding which mechanisms prevent H atoms getting tied up in the formation of methane. The (H2/CH4) product ratio of each catalyst for hydrogen over methane are shown in Fig. 6 along with their hydrogen yields. Here the product ratio is defined as the ratio of hydrogen moles to methane moles. The (H2/CH4) product ratio of the carbon-supported catalysts (3.5mol H2/mol CH4) is more than twice that of the silica–alumina-supported commercial catalysts (1.3mol H2/mol CH4) under the chosen conditions. The carbon-supported catalysts demonstrated here produced a higher content of unbound H atoms from the biomass. We attribute this observation to our XPS spectra described previously. The higher content of metallic to oxidized Nickel for the carbon supports could be the reason for the higher (H2/CH4) product ratio. We also observed a similar increase in (H2/CH4) product ratio (2.7mol H2/mol CH4) for the synthesized Nickel supported alumina catalyst. From the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 4, we noted a significant shoulder for a binding energy of 852ev that is characteristic of metallic nickel. Increasing the nickel loading on the carbon supports does not significantly change the hydrogen yield with these reaction conditions. The (H2/CH4) product ratio slightly decreased with a higher nickel loading, however this change is within experimental error. The gasification efficiency (GE) and carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) are shown in Fig. 7 . GE (reported as a percentage) is defined here as the mass of the gas products divided by the mass of the biomass. Similarly for CGE, it is the mass of carbon in the gas products divided by the carbon in the biomass. GE = mass of gas products mass of biomass CGE = mass of carbon in gas products mass of carbon in biomass It is important to note that the GE can have values higher than 100%. Water is a reactant in this system either through steam reforming or the water-gas shift reactions, so the products can have a higher mass than the biomass alone. The commercial catalysts were able to gasify more of the cellulose demonstrating GE near 100%. The CGE is a better measure of how much of the biomass was actually gasified. By looking at the CGE one can see that the Sigma catalyst gasified 50% of the carbon in the cellulose, and the BASF catalyst gasified 47%. For these cases along with SiAl support and the synthesized Ni/SiAl, all carbon comes from the biomass. Although the synthesized catalysts were only able to gasify 22–31% of the carbon, these materials were able to produce a similar amount of hydrogen with a higher (H2/CH4) product ratio."
9,Conclusions,"We have shown here an approach to produce nickel catalysts supported on 1-D carbon supports for the supercritical water gasification of cellulose. To our knowledge this work is the first time in the literature that Ni-based catalysts have been both synthesized and evaluated under supercritical fluid conditions. Carbon fibers and single walled carbon nanotubes were functionalized with nickel particles in a supercritical methanol reaction environment. This approach avoids the traditional harsh pretreatments necessary to functionalize the carbon surface prior to particle deposition. This work showed that these catalysts were effective for the production of hydrogen from cellulose in supercritical water. Product yields from the gasification were significantly increased over the non-catalyzed reaction. The synthesized catalysts produced similar hydrogen yields compared to Sigma and BASF commercially available silica–alumina supported nickel catalysts and demonstrated a higher (H2/CH4) product ratio. This characteristic could lead towards the development of optimized catalysts that more efficiently uses the hydrogen atoms in the biomass to make hydrogen gas as opposed to methane. XPS results suggest that this observation could be due to a higher metallic Nickel content in the synthesized catalysts. We note that a full chemisorption study of CO, CO2, H2, and CH4 could further reveal how these catalysts could be further optimized [49]. The supports were shown to be less active in the gasification suggesting that nickel plays an important role in the water-gas shift reaction oxidizing CO to CO2 and releasing hydrogen from water. This synthesis approach could prove useful for designing novel SCWG catalysts that require more durability over typical gaseous phase operations, due to water adsorption, sintering, and dissolution of catalyst components [50,51]."
