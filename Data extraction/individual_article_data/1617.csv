0,Introduction,"Curcumin (Cur) is a natural lipophilic polyphenol derived from the rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa). It is generally used in food industry as a distinctive food additive and spice. Recent studies have found that it plays a key role in the prevention and treatment of neurological and chronic diseases (Anand et al., 2007; Rauf et al., 2018). Curcumin is recognized as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) and has low toxicity of natural bioactive compound with health benefits and biological activity, an ideal biomaterial widely used in functional foods and drugs. Curcumin exhibits a series of biological and pharmacological therapeutic potentials owing to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer effects, immune regulation and neuroprotection. Curcumin derived from natural plants is considered as a safe and without side effect potential drug and nutritional enhancer (Farooqui and Farooqui, 2019). Nevertheless, hydrophobic bioactive compounds have low-water solubility, highly sensitive to environmental changes, poor bioavailability, which limits the application of Cur. Currently, constructing nanocarrier delivery system has proven to be an effective way to encapsulate and protect Cur to improve the bioavailability of unstable bioactives. Generally, Cur is encapsulated in nanoparticles of different biopolymers, namely yeast microcarriers, nano-emulsions-filled alginate hydrogel beads, bacterial cellulose hydrogels, polycaprolactone-grafted oligocarrageenan nano-micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles and liposomes (Young and Nitin, 2019, Xu et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2019; Youssouf et al., 2019; Xue et al., 2018). The different types of food-grade nanoparticles mainly include biopolymers, lipids, surfactants and minerals. The manufacture of nanoparticles can improve the physico-chemical stability and bioavailability of the encapsulated biologically active compounds, can control the later effective release in different biological environments, and avoid the burst releasing effects (Joye and Julian McClements, 2014). Food-grade protein nanoparticles in biopolymers have better bioavailability and functional properties for entrapped curcumin. Therefore, the protein-based nanoparticle delivery systems have been extensively used in capturing curcumin (Sadeghi et al., 2014). Due to the unique solubility of zein, it is widely used in the manufacture of nanoparticles to encapsulate lipophilic bioactive compounds, such as resveratrol, quercetin, lutein, β-carotene, tocopherol, cranberry procyanidins, paclitaxel, eugenol, etc. (Pauluk et al., 2019; Penalva et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2012; Veneranda et al., 2018). Zein-NaCas has been proven to enhance the dispersion, the stability and to prevent the aggregation and precipitation of nanoparticles (Li et al., 2012). Owing to zein of hydrophobic amino acid residues in a high proportion, the anti-solvent method can be used to prepare zein nanoparticles. Aqueous ethanol as solvent required for producing the composite nanoparticles, its utilization in special food industries is restricted because of its hazardous effects. Various factors in the process can affect its particle characteristics by using ethanol, such as the particle size of the prepared nanoparticles which is affected by the anti-solvent. In addition, in order to remove ethanol, the rotary evaporation process is relatively cumbersome, which increases the production cost and is not conducive to the industrial production process. The pH cycle driving method avoids the use of ethanol, however, it requires an accurate adjustment of pH, using a large number of acid-base solutions. The adjustment method is a dynamic process having many influencing factors. Therefore, in order to remove the restrictions on the application of alcohol in the anti-solvent in special foods, 1,2-Propanediol is used as a solvent instead of ethanol (Chen & Zhong, 2015). 1,2-Propanediol is broadly utilized in the pharmaceutical and food industry. Its low liquefying point and non-poisonousness characteristics permit 1,2-Propanediol to be utilized as a deicing agent and coolant, and it is perceived as a safe (GRAS) ingredient. 1,2-Propanediol is normally utilized as a co-dissolvable for hydrophobic bioactive compounds in pharmaceutical and food formulations. Ultrasound which was regarded as an emerging non-thermal technology, has been widely used in modulating structure of protein (Xu, Ren, et al., 2020; Xu ＆ Yuan et al., 2020). The multiple effects of ultrasound can induce proteins to expose the high-level internal structure and then change the conformation. The cavitation effect of ultrasound can obtain nanoparticles with a high yield in a short time, and improve the functional properties of nanoparticles (Feng et al., 2019). According to previous studies, it has been confirmed that ultrasound-assisted dialysis can be beneficial to the formation of nanoparticles, however, there is no relevant information about the use of multi-frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis to encapsulate Cur on Zein-NaCas composite nanoparticles (Liu et al., 2016). Multi-frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis is a new method for preparing zein nanoparticles which is conducive to the production of zein nanoparticles with ideal particle characteristics and high loading efficiency. This study was designed to develop an approach to overcome the drawbacks of using ethanol in zein nanoparticle synthesis and surmount the disadvantage of using the pH cycle driving method (use of large amounts of acid-base solutions). In addition, when removing solvents, two-phase physical driving forces (ultrasound and concentration difference) are used to promote the formation of uniform and stable nanoparticles with smaller sizes. Furthermore, the multi-frequency ultrasonic assisted dialysis method avoids the use of acid-base solutions, the reaction process is liable to control, and ideal nanoparticles can be prepared. Therefore, the effect of ultrasonic treatment with different combination frequencies on the properties of nanoparticles were investigated, and optimum combination frequency was selected to encapsulate Cur. In addition, the particle properties of nanoparticles (the particle size, zeta potential, PDI), microscopic morphology and intermolecular interactions of nanoparticles were studied. The storage stability and thermal stability, encapsulation efficiency and antioxidant activity of the hybrid nanoparticles were analyzed. Moreover, the Cur releasing behavior when the composite nanoparticles subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion was determined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zein was acquired from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Cur was purchased from China National Medicine Group Shanghai Corporation (Shanghai, China). 1,2-Propanediol and Casein sodium salt were obtained from Sino-Pharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Dialysis bags (3500D) were purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd (China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade."
3,Preparation and characterization of nanoparticles,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of nanoparticles 2.2.1 Zein nanoparticles and Zein-NaCas binary nanoparticles prepared by alcohol-free, multi-frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis Mass portions of 1% zein and sodium caseinate were added to 80% 1,2-Propanediol aqueous solution (v/v). The solution was stirred for 30 min using a magnetic stirrer, followed by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min) to remove residual large particles. The remaining solution was the binary mixed solution of zein and sodium caseinate which was put into a dialysis bag with a length of 45 cm, and introduced into a container full of distilled water. The ratio of binary mixed solution to deionized water was 1:20 (the volume of the binary mixed solution was 20 mL, and the volume of deionized water was 400 mL). The material container was put into an ultrasonic bath reactor, working at different frequency modes (single frequency: 20, 28 and 40 kHz; dual frequency: 20/28 kHz, 28/40 kHz, 20/40 kHz; tri-frequency: 20/28/40 kHz) and a power of 300 W. The ultrasonic continuous processing of the sample was performed at 25 °C for 10 min. After sonication, the dialysis bag was taken out, a certain volume of deionized water was re-added for dialysis at room temperature. After the dialysis, a colloidal dispersion was obtained, which was zein composite nanoparticles. One part of the colloidal solution was stored at 4 °C, and the other part was vacuum freeze-dried for 48 h. Zein composite nanoparticle samples were named 20-ZN, 28-ZN, 40-ZN, 20-28-ZN, 28-40-ZN, 20-40-ZN, 20-28-40-ZN, which corresponded respectively to the different frequency modes 20, 28 and 40 kHz, 20/28 kHz, 28/40 kHz, 20/40 kHz and 20/28/40 kHz. The untreated sample was named ZN. 2.2.2 Particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), Zeta potential and turbidity measurements The judgment of particle size, PDI and zeta potential of the zein hybrid nanoparticles were measured by an Anton Paar instrument (Anton Paar Litesizer TM 500, Austria) at 25 °C. All measurements were performed three times and the results were averaged. The turbidity of the sample was determined at 500 nm by a UV–vis ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer. All measurements were taken three times at room temperature and the results were averaged. 2.2.3 Fluorescence spectrum analysis Fluorescence spectrum analysis was performed by using a Card-F98 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The wavelength was set to 280 nm to excite the amino acid residues of zein, and the collection range was from 290 to 450 nm. The scanning is performed at a speed of 1000 nm/min, a scanning interval of 1 nm, an excitation bandwidth of 10 nm, and an emission bandwidth of 5 nm. 2.2.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The freeze-dried nanoparticle samples and potassium bromide were ground into a powder and pressed into a transparent sheet, and then scanned at a wavelength range 4000–400 cm−1 using a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet IS 50, New York, USA). The infrared spectrum was set to collect 64 scans to obtain the average value, while subtracting the spectrum of the blank sample. 2.2.5 Circular dichroism (CD) The Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to measure the alterations of the zein composite colloidal solution in the secondary structure. The CD spectra were scanned in a wavelength range of 190–250 nm by using a Jasco J-815 103 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (JASCO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Scanning conditions were: spectral resolution = 0.5 nm; speed = 60 nm/min; response = 0.25 s and 1 s. 2.2.6 Storage stability The fresh nanoparticle emulsion was stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C for 30 days. The particle size, potential, and PDI were measured on day one and day 30 to characterize the storage stability of the samples after ultrasonic treatment. 2.2.7 Atomic Force microscopy (AFM) 30 μL of the colloidal solution of zein nanoparticles was deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica and dried overnight at room temperature (25 °C). The suitable atomic force microscope mode of operation was arranged for the maize prolamin solution sample to capture the nanoparticles morphology (Bruker Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). All the images were scanned using ScanAsyst in air mode and a Silicon nitride probe."
4,Preparation of nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin,"2.3 Preparation of nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin 2.3.1 Preparation of Zein-NaCas-Cur ternary nanoparticles by ultrasound with optimal combination frequency Different mass proportions of 1% zein and sodium caseinate were weighed and added to different masses of Cur, so that the mass ratio of Zein: Cur was 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, 4:1. The mixtures were then added to 80% 1,2-Propanediol aqueous solution (v/v), stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min, followed by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min) to eliminate residual large particles. The ternary mixed solution of Zein-sodium caseinate-Cur was put into a dialysis bag with a length of 45 cm. The dialysis bag was sealed and put in the material container, and deionized water was added to the container. The ratio of the binary mixed solution to deionized water was 1:20. The material container was placed in the ultrasonic bath reactor. Then, sonication was conducted by using the continuous ultrasonic processing (20/40 kHz, 300 W, 25 °C, 10 min). After sonication, the dialysis bag was taken out, an equal volume of deionized water was added, and dialysis was performed at room temperature. After the dialysis, a colloidal dispersion was obtained, which was Zein-Cur composite nanoparticle colloidal dispersion. One part of the colloidal solution was stored at 4 °C for fluorescence spectroscopy, turbidity, and particle size potential measurements, and the other part was freeze-dried for 48 h for solid sample characterization. Zein: Cur nanoparticle samples with different mass ratios were named Zein: Cur = 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, 4:1. 2.3.2 Encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading content (LC) determination A sample of Zein:Cur colloidal dispersion was diluted with 80% 1,2-Propanediol aqueous solution (v/v), and then centrifuged (5000 rpm, 10 min) to obtain the supernatant which contained free Cur. The absorbance of the supernatant was read at 426 nm using a UV–vis ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer. To determine the content of free Cur in the supernatant, Cur dissolved in an 80% 1,2-Propanediol aqueous solution (v/v) was used to establish a standard curve. After calculating the encapsulated Cur, the EE and LC of Cur were obtained by following formula. (1) E E ( % ) = c u r c u m i n e n c a p s u l a t e d i n n a n o p a r t i c l e s t o t a l w e i g h t o f c u r c u m i n × 100 % (2) L C ( % ) = c u r c u m i n e n c a p s u l a t e d i n n a n o p a r t i c l e s t o t a l w e i g h t o f n a n o p a r t i c l e s × 100 % 2.3.3 Thermal stability The fresh ternary mixed solution of Zein-NaCas-Cur was incubated in a water bath in the dark at 75 °C, 85 °C and 95 °C for 30 min, and then cooling to room temperature, the mixed solution was measured at 426 nm using a UV–vis ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer. To investigate the stability of ternary nanoparticles with ultrasonic treatment, the alteration in the Cur content of the mixed solution at different temperatures was calculated. 2.3.4 Antioxidant capacity 2 mL of the zein nanoparticle colloidal solution encapsulating Cur was mixed with 2 mL of a DPPH(1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)-ethanol solution. The mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of the sample mixture (AS), ethanol solution (Ar), the mixed solution of deionized water and DPPH + ethanol (A0) was measured at 517 nm by using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of the curcumin-encapsulated nanoparticles was calculated using the following equation. (3) D P P H s c a v e n g i n g a b i l i t y ( % ) ＝ ( 1 − A S − A r A 0 ) × 100 % 2.3.5 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Crystal diffraction pattern of composite nanoparticles and curcumin was measured from a XRD instrument (D8 ADVANCE, BRUKER, Germany). The recording range of the scanning diffraction angle (2θ) was from 5° to 50° at a scanning speed of 5°/min. 2.3.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The uniformly dispersed nanoparticle powder was placed thinly on a conductive table soaked with conductive glue for gold sputtering pretreatment. Morphological characterization of nanoparticles was captured by a JSM-7001F scanning electron microscope (Japan Electronics Corporation, Japan) under 10 kV accelerating voltage. 2.3.7 Simulated gastrointestinal digestion To evaluate the release of free curcumin in the simulated sub gastrointestinal (SGI), nanoparticles with a mass ratio of 5:1 were prepared under ultrasonic treatment as described previously by Liang et al. (2021) with some modifications. In brief, 30 mL of freshly prepared composite nanoparticle dispersion was mixed with 30 mL of simulated gastric fluid (SGF, 3.2 mg/mL pepsin, 2.0 mg/mL NaCl, pH = 1.2), and the pH of the mixed solution was adjusted to 2. The mixture was heated in a constant temperature shaker (37 °C, 100 rpm) for 90 min, and the sample was collected (2 mL) at 30 min, 60 min, and 90 min, respectively. An equal amount of SGF was added to the samples. After sampling, 0.3 M NaOH was added to terminate the pepsin hydrolysis. After the simulated gastric digestion, the pH of the mixed solution with a total volume of 60 mL was adjusted to 7.5 and then mixed with 60 mL of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, 2 mg/mL pancreatin, 12 mg/mL porcine bile salt, 6.8 mg/mL K2HPO4, 8.8 mg/mL NaCl, pH = 7.5). It was further mixed for 150 min at 37 °C with continuous shaking. The sample was taken out every 30 min, and an equal volume of SIF was added into it followed by heating at 90 °C for 5 min to deactivate the digestive enzymes in pancreatin. The procedure was followed in accordance with section 2.3.2."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis Before determining particle characteristics, the sample was diluted with deionized water to achieve a clear state visible to the naked eye, and to avoid multiple scattering during measurements that can be caused by particle aggregation. All experiments were performed at least three times and the obtained data presented as the mean ± SD. Significant differences between samples were analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure (p < 0.05) by applying SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,"Zein nanoparticles, Zein-NaCas binary nanoparticles size, zeta potential, PDI, storage stability","3.1 Zein nanoparticles, Zein-NaCas binary nanoparticles size, zeta potential, PDI, storage stability The zein nanoparticles with uniform size distribution were prepared by Alcohol-free multi-frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis method with the help of two-phase physical driving force (ultrasound and concentration difference), as shown in Fig. 1 . The size of single zein after ultrasonic treatment was significantly reduced, and the size distribution was uniform. However, the size of the nanoparticles without ultrasonic treatment and size distribution was generally large. Therefore, the nanoparticles after ultrasonic treatment have obtained noticeable beneficial effects. For a single zein nanoparticle (Fig. 1A), the ultrasonically treated samples reached nanoparticle sizes of 20-Z, 28-Z, 40-Z, 20-28-Z, 28-40-Z, 20-40-Z, and 20-28-40-Z were 258.09 ± 6.88 nm, 248.2 ± 8.59 nm, 267.98 ± 10.51 nm, 284.62 ± 9.83 nm, 251.45 ± 10.85 nm, 228.21 ± 11.34 nm, and 240.75 ± 8.64 nm, respectively. In comparison, the untreated sample achieved a size of 327.23 ± 10.56 nm (Leong et al., 2017). Ultrasound treatment using different combined frequencies results in smaller nanoparticle sizes than the untreated sample, which conformed to food applications. Among the used ultrasound treatments, 20/40 kHz treatment led to minimal nanoparticle size (228.21 ± 11.34 nm), indicating its superiority over other ultrasound combined frequency modes. For binary zein nanoparticles (Fig. 1B), the untreated nanoparticles' size was 256.62 ± 2.78 nm, while the binary nanoparticle samples of 20-ZN, 28-ZN, 40-ZN, 20–28 -ZN, 28-40-ZN, 20-40-ZN, and 20-28-40-ZN, after ultrasonic treatment, attained particle diameters of 239.9 ± 3.57 nm, 239.35 ± 2.44 nm, 231.2 ± 2.8 nm, 242.92 ± 1.28 nm, 236.62 ± 3.26 nm, 225.94 ± 3.84 nm, and 239.09 ± 3.11 nm, respectively. 20/40 kHz was the best ultrasonic processing frequency which was compatible with the single nanoparticle's optimum performance. It might be that nanoparticles had different sensitivities to multi-frequency ultrasound, and 20/40 kHz as a suitable combined frequency that produced superposition of ultrasonic effects and improved the particle characteristics of nanoparticles. The single or triple frequency could not show the best frequency. The superiority was consistent with previous research (Yang et al., 2020). Compared with binary nanoparticles after ultrasonic treatment, the particle size of the added NaCas was significantly reduced, indicating that ultrasound helped in the formation of small-size nanoparticles. This suggested that the cavitation, thermal and mechanical effects of ultrasound have a role in lowering the nanoparticle size, by opening the spiral structure of zein. Thus, the biphasic physical driving force facilitated mass transfer and the self-assembly mechanism of the protein as the concentration differential in the solution varies during the dialysis process. Thereby, solidified nano-spherical particles with small size and uniform distribution will be formed. In the case of the binary nanoparticles, ultrasonic variations and different concentrations allowed the incorporation of NaCas to zein. The delivery system constructed by nanoparticles was further applied. A single nanoparticle's potential prepared by combined frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis is - 9.68 ± 1.01 mv (Fig. 1E), probably due to the change in the protein surface-charge caused by the amino acid changes occurred during the protein self-assembly process. The particles after ultrasonic treatment, using different combinations of frequencies, showed a negative decrease in the overall delivery potential, demonstrating that ultrasonic can effectively protect nanoparticles' stability by increasing the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles, Zhang et al., 2018.reported that ultrasound caused a sharp decrease in the particle size of soy peptide aggregations. The attachment of NaCas to binary nanoparticles rendered the whole delivery system feasible to around 30 mv (Fig. 1F), demonstrating that NaCas was effectively connected to the zein surface and that the potential of the nano-particles after ultrasound treatment has not significantly improved. Food improves storage stability, can further broaden the scope of application and increase the commercial value. Therefore, it was necessary to determine the apparent morphology of nanoparticles stored for 30 days under the combined action of ultrasound and dialysis. After 30 days of storage, the size, potential and PDI of the nanoparticles were measured again, and the results measured under 4 °C storage conditions were shown in Fig.1CD. The particle size of the untreated single nanoparticle sample increased to 395.79 ± 5.96 nm after 30-day storage (Fig. 1C). After ultrasound treatment, sample size has been increased, but the rise was small. The increase of nanoparticles after storage was also confirmed by an increase in potential, due to the weakening of electrostatic repulsive force between nanoparticles related to the extended storage period and the particle clumping and agglomeration phenomenon. As the potential augmented, the adhesion force between the nanoparticles increased, the electrostatic interaction weakened, and the particle's physical storage stability decreased (Liu et al., 2021). For binary nanoparticles, after adding the stabilizer NaCas, the particle size of the sample without ultrasonic treatment increases to 270.37 ± 2.65 nm after storage for 30 days (Fig. 1D). The nanoparticle sizes did slightly increase after ultrasonic treatment, though smaller than single nanoparticle sizes. The changing trend of the binary nanoparticle potential after ultrasonic treatment was consistent with the particle size, and the reduction degree was lower than that of a single nanoparticle. It showed that the ultrasonic treatment and the stabilizer have a synergistic effect, as seen in the improvement of the stability of the nanoparticles, which is beneficial to the further application of the nanoparticles."
8,Fluorescence spectroscopy,"3.2 Fluorescence spectroscopy Fluorescence is a fast and effective method commonly used to analyze protein-biopolymer interactions. By detecting the characteristic wavelength of the protein's endogenous fluorescence, the changes in the secondary structure of the protein are revealed (Kaushik et al., 2019). The intrinsic fluorescence of zein comes from containing specific amino acid residues (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine residues) (Shukla and Cheryan, 2001). When zein was combined with different biopolymers (such as polysaccharides, surfactants, stabilizers), it will induce changes in fluorescence characteristics, and then the interaction between different treatments on zein-biopolymers can be analyzed. The relationship between the fluorescence characteristics of zein nanoparticle dispersions after different combined frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis treatments was shown in Fig. 2AB. After excitation of purified untreated zein, the average fluorescence peak achieved at 301 nm, which correlated to the high proportion of tyrosine residues (Joye et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2019). In general, after combined frequency ultrasonic treatment, it can be found that the maximum emission intensity of the zein nanoparticle dispersion was significantly higher than that of the untreated sample. This might be due to the mechanical and cavitation effects of ultrasonic waves and local high temperature and high pressure. Under the action of zein, the hydrophobic interior of zein was opened, and the protein stretched to expose the hydrophobic amino acid residues at the molecular level, thereby affecting the secondary structure of the protein. For a single nanoparticle (Fig. 2 A), fluorescence intensity changes after different combined frequency ultrasound treatments are also different. The more prominent one is 20/40 kHz ultrasound. The fluorescence intensity after ultrasound-assisted dialysis treatment was the highest. After ultrasonic treatment of samples with other combined frequencies, the fluorescence intensity also showed obvious enhancement compared with no ultrasonic treatment. For binary nanoparticles (Fig. 2B), the overall fluorescence intensity increases after combined frequency ultrasound assisted dialysis. Compared with zein single nanoparticles, the addition of NaCas has a synergistic effect that enhanced the fluorescence intensity. However, the interaction between NaCas and zein changed the local microenvironment of the protein, and the whole presented a non-polar state. A single NaCas has a fluorescence emission peak at 345 nm under a 280 nm excitation wavelength. Under the conditions of ultrasound and dialysis treatment, after adding NaCas, the typical characteristic fluorescence peak of zein disappeared. Besides, the fluorescence intensity of tyrosine residues increased and the maximum emission wavelength of tyrosine shifted to a longer wavelength of 355 nm. This indicated that under ultrasound and dialysis treatment, Zein and NaCas formed a complex and interactions between nanoparticle molecules occurred which might due to hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding (Wei et al., 2019). Similar phenomena have been observed in the research of other scholars. Liang et al. (2008) found that the local environment of the binary nanoparticle colloidal dispersion was non-polar. Liu et al. (2020) have reported that when pterostilbene (PTS) was loaded into zein nanoparticles, the characteristic spectrum of PTS moved to 395 nm as well as light intensity increased, the molecules were tightly combined."
9,Circular dichroism (CD),"3.3 Circular dichroism (CD) The far-ultraviolet CD is a fast method to analyze and characterize protein conformation changes (Greenfield, 2006). This study was mainly used to analyze the alteration in the secondary structure of zein compound nanoparticles under different combination frequencies of ultrasound-assisted dialysis. A single zein without ultrasonic dialysis treatment showed a characteristic secondary structure spectrum (zero-crossing at around 193 and 203 nm, and negative peaks at 209 and 224 nm) (Fig. 2C). Compared with the native zein, Zein-NaCas binary nanoparticles prepared by the combined frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis showed a total decrease in α-helix and β-Sheet structures, and the content of random coil increased significantly (Table 1 ). These changes in the secondary structure made the protein partially inactivated and incompletely unfolded in the final state, thus the protein formed a dense spherical structure. Therefore, ultrasound contributed to the loss of zein's configuration, the self-assembly of zein into ball-shaped nanoparticles during dialysis, and the creation of NaCas in a central shell framework on the outside of zein. In conclusion, the combined frequency ultrasound promoted the non-covalent interaction between zein and NaCas in the process of protein self-assembly. Concerning the Zein-NaCas composite nanoparticles without ultrasonic treatment, the substance of α-helix and β-sheet expanded after treatment with various ultrasonic frequencies (In addition to the content of β-sheets in the sample treated with 40 kHz ultrasound), demonstrating that ultrasonic has changed the molecular group arrangement of Zein through mechanical and cavitation impacts; in this way further affecting the physical and chemical properties of the nanoparticles (Liang et al., 2021)."
10,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR was used to study the potential intermolecular interactions between binary nanoparticles with combined frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis. It can be seen from Fig. 2D that the combined frequency ultrasound has a relatively small effect on the FTIR spectra. Compared with single zein and ZN composite nanoparticles without ultrasonic treatment, the characteristic peaks at 3100 - 3500 cm−1 of the samples after the combined frequency ultrasonic dialysis treatment has shifted, indicating that the driving force for the formation of nanoparticles after ultrasonic combined with NaCas is hydrogen bonding (Pelissari et al., 2009). The characteristic peaks of zein were found at 3313 cm−1, 1666 cm−1, and 1535 cm−1, while the characteristic peaks of NaCas were located at 3307 cm−1, 1670 cm−1, and 1529 cm−1. The hydrogen bond (3200 - 3400 cm−1) was mainly related to the stretching vibration of N–H, the amide I band (1750 - 1600 cm-1) was mainly related to the C–O stretching vibration, and the amide II band (1550 -1510 cm−1) mainly refers to the C–N tension and the bending vibration of N–H. Compared with zein, the O–H positions of Zein-NaCas are all transferred after ultrasonic treatment, with different combinations of frequencies, indicating the formation of hydrogen bonds. At the same time, the peaks of amide I and amide II also shifted, indicating that the formation of zein composite nanoparticles involves electro-static interactions. Since zein was a highly hydrophobic molecule, there might be hydrophobic interactions between nanoparticles (Cai et al., 2020). Fluorescence spectroscopy, CD, and FTIR results showed that ultrasound changed the secondary structure of Zein, and ultrasound and sodium caseinate (NaCas) had a synergistic effect, improving the storage stability of ZN nanoparticles through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions."
11,Turbidity analysis,"3.5 Turbidity analysis The turbidity of the final solution system was analyzed to ascertain the formation of the nanoparticles and the stability of the colloidal dispersion, and the results were shown in Fig. 3 . With the progress of ultrasound-assisted dialysis, the whole solution turned into a milky white colloidal solution, and no obvious large precipitated flocs were formed, which indicated that Zein presented a uniform and stable colloidal system (Liu et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). After ultrasonic treatment, the formed microspheres were evenly dispersed in the colloidal solution, avoiding the adhesion of colloidal particles and further film formation or precipitation. However, Z-1 and ZN-1 were solutions from zein stock which were not treated, and Z and ZN were the samples after dialysis without ultrasonic treatment. The turbidity has changed significantly from 1.557 to 2.554 for Z-1 and ZN-1, respectively, at the beginning, to become 3.333 and 3.329 after dialysis without ultrasonic treatment for Z and ZN. After ultrasonic-assisted dialysis treatment with different combinations of frequencies, the colloidal mixed solution turbidity, and the colloidal solution have increased significantly. The overall color has changed from the original pale yellow to milky white without agglomerated large particles. With the loss of solvent, the solubility of Zein was reduced, and the exchange between solvents occurred. Finally, the turbidity of the solution had been changed (Joye and Mcclements, 2013). The reason was that the consumption of 1,2-propanediol in the solution reduced the concentration and the solubility of Zein molecules decreased, causing Zein to precipitate and solidify into spherical particles, Contributing to the stability of colloidal dispersion in the storage stage and the capture of hydrophobic biologically active compounds. After ultrasound-assisted dialysis treatment, ultrasound broke the droplets in the particle formation process, and the compact particle structure formed when solidified into microspheres prevented the aggregation of nanoparticles due to environmental factors and avoided the further formation of insoluble precipitates."
12,Atomic force microscopy (AFM),"3.6 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) AFM was mainly used to characterize the microscopic morphology of nanoparticles. Including single zein, ZN composite nanoparticles without ultrasonic treatment, the optimal combination of single-frequency 20 and 40 kHz, and the dual-frequency 20–40 kHz, and triple-frequency 20-28-40-ZN, their nanoparticles had different sensitivities to multi-frequency ultrasound. In addition, 20/40 kHz as a suitable combined frequency might produce superposition of ultrasonic effects and improved the particle characteristics of nanoparticles (Fig. 4 ). As shown, 1,2-propanediol as a solvent could replace ethanol to prepare nanoparticles, and the nanoparticles without ultrasound treatment had no obvious spherical shape, low yield and uneven distribution. After the combined frequency ultrasonic treatment, the nanoparticles had smaller particle sizes and more uniform distribution. They have a relatively regular spherical shape, which was more conducive to further application processes (Chen et al., 2020). The nanoparticles distribution after 20–40 kHz treatment was more uniform, having a higher yield without aggregated, large-sized and irregular-shaped nanoparticles."
13,Characterization of Zein-NaCas-Cur ternary nanoparticles,"3.7 Characterization of Zein-NaCas-Cur ternary nanoparticles 3.7.1 Zein-NaCas-Cur particle size, Zeta-potential, PDI, storage stability The effect of the mass ratio of curcumin and zein on the nanoparticle mixed solution was shown in Fig. 5 . The particle size of Zein-NaCas-Cur at different Zein:Cur mass ratios (40:1 to 4:1), without applying ultrasound treatment, were respectively 273.97 ± 3.69 nm, 275.88 ± 4.30 nm, 276.77 ± 8.24 nm, 268.27 ± 5.31 nm and 281.08 ± 5.69 nm (Fig. 5A). This demonstrated that different masses of Cur have lower effects on the nanoparticle size. Combined frequency ultrasonic treatment to encapsulate curcumin with different mass ratios leads to an increase in the nanoparticle size firstly and then decrease. As the concentration of curcumin augmented, the particle size of Zein-NaCas composite nanoparticles increased gradually to reach the maximum value at Zein-Cur ratio 10:1 (238.52 ± 4.78 nm). Then it started to decrease as the concentration of curcumin was increased (Zein-Cur ratio 5:1 and Zein-Cur ratio 4:1), to reach a value of 224.44 ± 3.32 nm and 215.81 ± 11.48 nm (Fig. 5B). The PDI values of zein composite nanoparticle systems encapsulating curcumin with different mass ratios were all less than 0.2. The results revealed that the zein composite nanoparticle system had a relatively uniform and narrow overall size distribution and the mass ratio of curcumin did not influence the PDI of the nanoparticle system. In comparison, it can be clearly seen that the size of the nanoparticles after sonication was generally smaller than that without sonication. This suggested that ultrasound radiation promoted the formation of nanoparticles in an ideal state and penetrated to the internal structure of the protein. Curcumin was embedded in the particles, cross-connected with zein and tightly packed to form a dense structure, thus the size of the nanoparticle was reduced. After 30-day storage (30D), the sizes of nanoparticle encapsulating Cur at different Zein:Cur mass ratios (40:1 to 4:1) without ultrasound treatment were 308.22 ± 7.68 nm, 315.82 ± 8.63 nm, 324.45 ± 8.35 nm, 295.24 ± 7.21 nm, and 337.65 ± 3.68 nm, respectively (Fig. 5A). The particle sizes of Zein-NaCas composite nanoparticles containing different Zein:Cur mass ratios (40:1 to 4:1) and treated with combined frequency ultrasound were achieved at 238.04 ± 3.25 nm, 354.40 ± 1.43 nm, 247.74 ± 7.41 nm, 240.01 ± 5.19 nm, 245.00 ± 7.36 nm, respectively (Fig. 5B). With the increase in the storage time, the particle size of the nanoparticles showed an increasing trend, but the nanoparticles were still in a relatively small particle size state, and the overall increase was not very large. For the nanoparticle system with a relatively small mass of encapsulated curcumin, the increase in particle size was relatively large, which might be because the less curcumin content causes aggregation and precipitation between the particles and deposits into larger nanoparticles. For nanoparticle systems with a relatively large content of curcumin, the latter itself had a negative charge, so there was a potential for greater electrostatic repulsion, so that the nanoparticle system was not easy to deposit into large particles ensuring a better spatial stability nanoparticle. The overall PDI values of the samples after combined frequency ultrasonic treatment during storage were less than 0.2, indicating that the nanoparticle system was in relatively uniform size distribution and beneficial to ensure the stability of the particles. For samples unsubjected to sonication, the curcumin was not embedded in the nanoparticles indicated by the low zeta potential value (Fig. 5C). The binary composite nanoparticles ZN treated at 20–40 kHz had a particle size of 225.94 ± 3.84 nm, a PDI of 0.19 ± 0.08, a potential of −29.9 7 ± 1.49 mV, and a particle size of 234.63 ± 2.28 nm after storage at 4 °C for 30 d, PDI was 0.15 ± 0.01, and the potential was −29.97 ± 0.6 mV (in Fig. 1). After loading Cur with different mass ratios, the particle size change was not obvious, but the absolute value of the potential increased significantly. It might be that ultrasound and NaCas synergistically promote the formation of a stable nanoparticle delivery carrier. ZN treated at 20–40 kHz had a Zeta potential of −29.97 ± 1.49 mV, while Cur itself carried a negative charge (−21.25 ± 2.15 mV). After loading Cur, the overall zeta potential range was −34.39 ± 1.48 mV to −55.4 ± 0.99 mV, the fact that the net charge on the nanoparticles was negative is due to the fact that the NaCas formed the outer coating and the potential increased, forming a typical core-shell structure (Hu et al., 2015). The sodium caseinate could fuse most of the curcumin inside the biopolymer-covered nanoparticles. This may have been on the grounds that it adsorbed quickly and thusly restrained nanoparticle conglomeration as well as because it had the option to tie a portion of the curcumin atoms to its non-polar districts (Peng et al., 2020). The rise of zein nanoparticle zeta potential after ultrasonic treatment was due to the increase in curcumin's mass ratio, resulting in zein composite nanoparticles zeta potential increase. Because the mass ratio of the Zein:Cur was 5:1, the absolute value of zeta potential was the largest (- 55.39 ± 0.99 mV) (Fig. 5D). The total charge value increase was because curcumin has a certain negative charge, which provided a larger electrostatic repulsion force for the nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the zein complex nanoparticles' stability. A similar finding was reported by Liu et al. (2020), who found that negatively charged FU could stabilize the nanoparticles through electrostatic and steric repulsion. After 30 D of storage, the absolute value of zeta potential of nanoparticle dispersion liquids treated with ultrasonic treatment and without ultrasonic treatment became smaller, indicating that the stability of the nanoparticles was damaged to a certain extent during storage, which may bridge other adjacent particles, causing static electricity. So, the weakening of the repulsive force imposed the absolute value of the zeta potential to become smaller, which corresponded to the change in the particle size (Jiang et al., 2021). 3.7.2 Encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) The EE and LC of curcumin were shown in Fig. 6 A. Generally speaking, different mass ratios of curcumin influenced the encapsulation and the loading rate. The encapsulation efficiency of the nanoparticle systems (Zein:Cur = 40:1, 20:1,10:1, 5:1 and 4:1) without ultrasonic treatment was 67.96 ± 0.10%, 73.76 ± 0.10%, 78.15 ± 0.20%, 76.84 ± 0.16% and 70.37 ± 0.20%, respectively. With the increase in the curcumin concentration, the encapsulation efficiency showed firstly an increasing trend and then decreasing pattern. It might due to the curcumin encapsulation by a sufficient amount of zein in the early stage, however, the concentration of zein was constant, and the load will be oversaturated, which minimized the embedding rate (Peng et al., 2020). Overall, the encapsulation efficiency of the nanoparticle dispersion systems after ultrasonic treatment was higher (71.40 ± 0.21–90.19 ± 0.33%) than without ultrasonic treatment, the overall encapsulation rate had been significantly improved. The zein complex nanoparticles with the negative charge and the smaller size were formed when the mass ratio of zein to Cur was 5:1, exhibiting higher encapsulation efficiency of Cur (Meng et al., 2021). Ultrasound treatment could further improve its encapsulation efficiency and storage stability of Cur (Chen et al., 2015). Regarding the curcumin concentration, the encapsulation efficiency of the nanoparticle dispersion systems after ultrasonic treatment showed a similar trend as observed in the untreated samples. The increase in encapsulation rate with the increase in curcumin indicated that the ultrasound punctured the nanoparticle structure, allowing curcumin to be embedded in the particle and tightly clustered together, and thereby the encapsulation rate increased. As the curcumin amount furtherly increased, zein was overloaded and consequently, the encapsulation and the loading rate decreased. 3.7.3 DPPH radical scavenging activity Fig. 6B showed the results of the influence of the ultrasound treatment and different mass ratios of curcumin on the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the nanoparticle dispersion systems. The colloidal nanoparticle dispersion's anti-oxidation ability after ultrasonic treatment is stronger than that without ultrasonic treatment. On the one hand, after ultrasonic treatment, the nanoparticles have a small particle size, which increased the contact surface area; thus, the encapsulation ability of the nanoparticle was enhanced. As seen, the higher the concentration of curcumin in the nanoparticle, the stronger the antioxidant capacity. On the other hand, the synergistic effect of ultrasound and stabilizers produced curcumin with good water solubility and dispersibility. Cai et al. (2020) reported that the antioxidant activity of curcumin was significantly improved after loading into the CLCSNs, which was due to the increase in the water solubility and larger surface area of curcumin. The DPPH free radical scavenging rate of Zein:Cur mass ratio 5:1 after ultrasonic treatment was 79.01 ± 4.26%, and the DPPH free radical scavenging rate of samples without ultrasonic treatment was 58.58 ± 2.69%. What was interesting was that the nanoparticle's best antioxidant activity after ultrasonic treatment was Zein:Cur mass ratio 4:1 (86.91 ± 0.72%), while the antioxidant activity of the corresponding sample with no ultrasonic treatment (Zein:Cur mass ratio 4:1) was 52.48 ± 0.38%. It has been reported that the antioxidant activity of single curcumin was about 19.56%, indicating that ultrasound-assisted dialysis is an effective mean to capture curcumin (Xue ＆ Wang et al., 2018). 3.7.4 Thermal stability The thermal stability of Zein:Curcumin was shown in Fig. 6C. Heat treatment could easily aggregate the nanoparticles and then precipitate. Ultrasound and stabilizers could avoid these phenomena so that the nanoparticles could maintain an ideal stable state, thereby protecting the encapsulated biologically active substances. In Fig. 6C, The Zein:Cur mass ratio 5:1 after ultrasonic treatment maintains a good Cur retention rate at 75 °C, 85 °C, and 95 °C, respectively 85.26 ± 0.61%, 80.96 ± 0.61%, 78.4 ± 0.92%, without ultrasonic treatment The Cur retention rate of ZNC-5:1 under different temperature treatments was 58 ± 0.52%, 49.26 ± 0.3%, 34.21 ± 0.63%, the nanoparticle dispersion's overall thermal stability subjected to the combined frequency ultrasonic treatment was higher than that of the sample without ultrasonic treatment (in Fig. 6D). The possible reason was that the nanoparticles with higher encapsulation efficiency were obtained after ultrasonic treatment, and secondly, ultrasound affected zein and the stabilizer by forming a dense protective shell. Paramera et al., 2011 obtained similar results that curcumin was stable at 100 °C after 120 min of heating. On the one hand, ultrasound triggered the binding of curcumin and the binary composite nanoparticles due to non-covalent interactions. On the other hand, the curcumin was treated with ultrasound during the encapsulation process. The bridges assembled and entered the inside of the nanoparticles and ultimately improved the curcumin thermal stability at 75 °C, 85 °C, and 95 °C (Meng et al., 2021). 3.7.5 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR mainly analyzed the interaction between curcumin and Zein-NaCas. In the characteristic spectrum of Cur (Fig. 7 A), there was no peak at the carbonyl region of 1800–1650 cm−1, indicating that Cur existed in the keto-enol tautomeric form. Other characteristic peaks of Cur were 3509 cm−1 (attributed to the phenolic –OH stretching vibration), 1627 cm−1 (vibrations due to CO and CC), 1602 cm−1 (stretching vibration of benzene ring of curcumin), 1508 cm−1 (CO and CC vibrations), 1428 cm−1 (olefinic CH bending vibration), 1282 cm−1 (aromatic CO stretching vibration), 1114 cm−1 (vibrations O–CH) (Kolev et al., 2005). After being encapsulated by the Zein-NaCas delivery system, curcumin characteristic absorption peak has changed significantly, indicating the occurrence of interaction between Cur and Zein-NaCas (Li et al., 2016). The peak at 3509 cm−1 disappeared, and phenolic –OH participated in formation of hydrogen bonds. Besides, other missing peaks are mainly related to the vibration of aromatic rings and inter-ring aliphatic chains, limiting the phenomenon of stretching and bending vibrations of curcumin functional groups (Alavi et al., 2018). However, when Cur and into Zein-NaCas form a complex, hydrophobic interaction was involved. In general, when Cur was encapsulated in Zein-NaCas composite nanoparticles, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions played a major role. 3.7.6 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The XRD crystal diffraction patterns of different samples are shown in Fig. 7B. A single zein diffraction peak appeared as two flat peaks, 13.12°, and 29.12°. There was no sharp characteristic peak, indicating that zein was in an amorphous state. While curcumin showed sharp diffraction peaks at a range of 5–50°, indicating a high degree of crystallinity, no sharp diffraction peaks appeared in the composite nanoparticles formed by ultrasonic and dialysis treatment; suggesting that curcumin was successfully trapped inside the particles. This was possibly happening because of the interaction between curcumin and nanoparticle molecules (Weng et al., 2019). After curcumin was successfully encapsulated in the nanoparticles, it was in an amorphous state (Patel et al., 2010). The dissolution rate of the amorphous complex in the delivery system was significantly higher than that of the crystalline complex, thereby increasing the availability of the encapsulated biologically active substance. 3.7.7 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM was used to determine the effects of ultrasound and non-ultrasound on the microscopic morphology of the binary zein and curcumin with different mass ratios after ultrasonic treatment. The Zein-NaCas binary nanoparticles not subjected to ultrasonic treatment reveal that the nanoparticles have a large particle size, rough morphology, uneven size distribution, and easy adhesion to each other (Fig. 8 A). The sonicated nanoparticles (Fig. 8B) have an apparent spherical shape and uniform distribution, and the particle yield was higher, which corresponded to AFM results. For the nanoparticle sample encapsulating curcumin at different Zein:Cur mass ratios subjected to ultrasonic treatment (Fig. 8DEF), by increasing the mass ratio of Zein:Cur, nanoparticles were formed, having spherical shapes, smaller sizes, relatively smooth surfaces and uniform distributions. These modifications resulted in the generation of numerous nanoparticles, indicating that curcumin was well encapsulated. Ultrasound-assisted dialysis under the blessing of NaCas could enhance zein self-assembled nanoparticles, have better particle characteristics, and increase its encapsulation rate and environmental resistance to the encapsulated curcumin. 3.7.8 In vitro release of Cur in the complex nanoparticles The mass ratio of Zein to Cur at 5:1 to form nanoparticles was found most suitable for the research project based on the particle characteristics and stability. The release rate of free Cur, Zein:Cur = 5:1 composite nanoparticles without ultrasonic treatment, and Zein:Cur = 5:1 composite nanoparticles with ultrasonic treatment in the simulated gastrointestinal tract was shown in Fig. 9 , where the composite nanoparticles of Zein:Cur = 5:1 without sonication were used as comparisons. Due to the weak dissolving ability of curcumin in gastrointestinal fluid, the release rate in the simulated gastrointestinal fluid was only 20.79 ± 1.57%. In general, ZN nanoparticles could provide protection to the loaded Cur by controlling its release in SGF. Furthermore, these released a large amount in SIF, and achieve sustained release in the later stage. After 90 min of digestion (SGF), the cumulative release of Cur loaded in the composite nanoparticles treated with ultrasound treatment of Zein:Cur = 5:1 reached 16.63 ± 1.46%. Whereas, the digestion for 240 min (SIF), increased the cumulative release of ultrasound treated Cur loaded in the Zein:Cur = 5:1 composite nanoparticles to 48.26 ± 1.48%. The cumulative release rate of the control sample without ultrasound treatment at the end of SGF digestion was 19.72 ± 2.19%, and the cumulative release rate at the end of SIF digestion was 70.46 ± 2.12%. In the SGF digestion stage, the cumulative release rate of Cur in the nanoparticles increased relatively slowly. However, when the SGF digested nanoparticles were transferred to SIF, a burst of Cur in the nanoparticles could be clearly observed within 30 min, and sustainable release of Cur in the subsequent stage. The reason for the rapid release might be the presence of bile salts, proteins, and peptides in the simulated intestinal juice, which could form mixed micelles or complexes to dissolve Cur. On the other hand, it may be because zein was decomposed to form peptides that helped to dissolve Cur. In the SIF stage, the release rate of the ultrasound-treated sample was significantly lower than that of the control. This might be due to the intermolecular interaction of ultrasound and NaCas. The nanoparticles form a tighter structure and a stable protective barrier on the surface of the nanoparticles, thereby forming smaller-sized nanoparticles, effectively limiting the release of Cur. (Hu et al., 2020). Therefore, ultrasonic treatment can provide a better protection for Cur in the gastrointestinal environment and achieve sustained and controlled release (Eggen et al., 2014). Hence, nanoparticles prepared by ultrasound-assisted dialysis can be used as ideal carriers for hydrophobic biologically active compounds."
14,Conclusions,"This study demonstrated the effect of ultrasound-assisted dialysis with different combinations of frequencies on the Zein-NaCas binary composite system preparation. 1,2-Propanediol could replace ethanol as a solvent to prepare nanoparticles. The optimal ultrasonic frequency was 20/40 kHz. The mass ratio of Zein to Cur at 5:1 to form nanoparticles, the particle size was smaller, and it had better storage stability, ability to scavenge DPPH free radicals, and thermal stability. The alcohol-free multi-frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis method led to nanoparticle formation with a higher yield, small size, uniform distribution, and good storage properties. The effect of combined frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis and sodium caseinate on the nanoparticle system depended on hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions as the driving force to promote nanoparticles formation. The ultrasound treatment showed a synergistic effect with sodium caseinate. The combined frequency ultrasound-assisted dialysis-driven zein self-assembled nanoparticles successfully encapsulated curcumin, which increased its loading rate and antioxidant activity, reduced sensitivity to environmental changes, and improved storage stability. Cur was encapsulated in Zein-NaCas nanoparticles through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion showed that the ZN composite nanoparticles prepared by ultrasound-assisted dialysis could control the release of Cur in the gastrointestinal tract. Our research provides a new idea based on improving the functional properties of hydrophobic biologically active compounds, thereby providing information worthy of reference for applying hydrophobic compounds. However, this study still needs further research, such as in-vitro simulated digestion and antibacterial experiments, to evaluate the encapsulated curcumin practical application."
