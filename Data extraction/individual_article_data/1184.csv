0,Introduction,"The production of renewable value-added chemicals from biomass resources is an attractive route for environmental sustainability [1,2]. In accordance with the oxygen-rich characteristics of biomass, many processes have been explored to produce oxygen-containing chemicals through various catalytic reactions, such as oxidation, oxidation-amination, hydrogenation, dehydration, and rearrangement [3–7]. In recent years, tandem catalysis has attracted increasing attention, allowing multiple transformations in one pot and increasing the synthesis of diverse molecules. For example, cyclopentanone (CPO) is an important fine chemical and potential biofuel [8,9]. Conventionally, CPO is synthesized from fossil resources through the pyrolysis of adipic acid under harsh reaction conditions. In contrast, the tandem hydrogenation-rearrangement route has attracted a lot of attention for the synthesis of CPO starting from furfural (FA) by combining hydrogenation and rearrangement. This is because of the high atom economy of the reaction, which does not require separation of intermediates, and the potential for sustainable use of resources, promoting environmental protection. However, such a tandem reaction faces great challenges in selectivity control and achieving a high yield of the target product. The inclusion of a consecutive series of transformations is as follows: (1) FA is hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol (FAL) with C=O reduced to C–OH; (2) FAL is rearranged to 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone (HCP); (3) HCP is dehydrated and hydrogenated to CPO with removal of the hydroxyl group and hydrogenation of C=C bonds. To make the tandem reaction run along the pathway as expected, several multifunctional catalysts have been constructed with noble metals as the hydrogenation sites and Lewis acidic components or supports to promote dehydration rearrangement. For example, after the pioneering research on employing Pd/C in water with a 76% yield of CPO [5], Ru [10,11], Au [12], Pt, and Pd [13,14] catalysts were developed with improved CPO yields. This was achieved by promoting dehydration using Lewis acids, such as alumina and ferric oxide, to promote the entire tandem reaction. Although great efforts have been made on multifunctional catalysts, researchers have found that side polymerization products are difficult to reduce in water because the FA and its intermediate compounds are inclined to polymerize. The polymerization pathway, which results in a carbon imbalance, generally lowers the final selectivity to CPO. Therefore, directing reaction pathways based on insight into the mechanism of polymerization would be an important task for enhancing the selectivity of this tandem reaction. Our laboratory has engaged in the utilization of biomass and biomass-derived feedstocks [15–17], especially the development of non-precious metal catalysts for various catalytic conversion processes. We found that the bimetallic NiCu catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the hydrogenation rearrangement of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to 3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentenone in water using H2 as a reductant [15]. In our early work on the hydrogenation rearrangement of FA, we constructed a bimetallic NiCu-50/SBA-15 catalyst with a 61.4% yield of CPO; however, it was difficult to further improve the selectivity of CPO in water [17]. Inspired by these findings, we considered that if bimetallic Ni and Cu are uniformly distributed in the nanoparticles (NPs), the active centers for hydrogenation and dehydration could be much closer to each other, which may promote the tandem of these reactions. In this study, a bimetallic CuNi/Al-MCM-41 catalyst was constructed that showed bimetallic synergic and charge transfer effects to remarkably improve the catalytic performance, which was greatly reduced by precisely controlling the initial concentration of FA and the pH of the aqueous system."
1,Experiment,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Commercial Al-MCM-41 (1.1 wt%, determined by XRF in the form of Al2O3%), SBA-15, HY, and ZSM-5 were purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd. Commercial Al-MCM-41 (0.5 wt%) was obtained from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. Al-MCM-41 (5.1 wt%) was prepared by modification of Al-MCM-41 (1.1 wt%), and pure MCM-41 was synthesized in the laboratory. The Al-MCM-41 discussed in this article is Al-MCM-41 (1.1 wt%) unless otherwise stated. Cu(NO3)2·5H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, NaOH, H2SO4, ethanol, dodecane, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), and N,N-dimethylformamide were purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. FA, FAL, CPO, and cyclopentanol (CPL) were obtained from Aladdin. HCP was obtained from Admas. Distilled water was purified using a Milli-Q system (Millipore)."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts The synthesis of CuNi/Al-MCM-41 was performed as follows. To 1.6 g of distilled water, 0.50 g Cu(NO3)2·5H2O and 0.58 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were added. After stirring with sonication for 20 min, 0.50 g Al-MCM-41 (1.1 wt%) powder was added and dispersed for 30 min, and then dried at 100 °C for 10 h. The resulting green powder was treated by adding 0.7 g of the powder with 25 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide to a 50 mL flask, sonicating for 20 min, stirring for 1 h, washing with ethanol three times, and drying at 80 °C for 2 h. The resulting green powder was added to a quartz tube and calcined at 500 °C in air for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C·min−1, and then reduced at 400 °C under H2 flow for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C·min−1. The resulting black powder was denoted as CuNi/Al-MCM-41. The Cu/Al-MCM-41, Ni/Al-MCM-41, CuNi/MCM-41, CuNi/HY, CuNi/ZSM-5, and CuNi/SBA-15 samples were prepared using the impregnation-calcination-reduction method."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D/Max 2500/PC powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV and 200 mA with a scanning rate of 5°·min−1, between 5° and 80°. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected in KBr media between 4000 and 400 cm−1 on a Bruker Tensor 27. The morphology of the materials was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a HITACHI H7700 electron microscope. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations and HAADF-STEM images were obtained using a JEM-2100F electron microscope. The acidity of the obtained samples and comparative materials was investigated using temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) with a mass spectrometer (TPD-MS) on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 apparatus. The pH of the solvent was detected by Sartorius-PB-10 with a combination of a silver electrode and a BNC electrode. The TGA measurements were conducted under nitrogen on a Mettler Toleso TGA/SDTA 851 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1. XPS measurements were performed on a Thermo Escalab 250Xi using an Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation source at room temperature, power 150 W, 650 μm beam spots, voltage 14.8 kV, current 1.6 A, and using contaminated carbon C 1s 284.8 eV for charge correction. A constant analyzer transfer energy Ep pass energy with narrow sweep 20 eV, wide sweep 100 eV, and vacuum 1 × 10−10 mbar. A PerkinElmer ICP-OES 7300DV instrument was used to determine the nickel and copper contents."
5,Catalytic hydrogenation-rearrangement of FA,"2.4 Catalytic hydrogenation-rearrangement of FA The hydrogenation rearrangement of the FA experiments was performed in a 50 mL Parr autoclave. The typical operation process was as follows: FA 0.5 g (5.2 mmol) and deionized water (10 mL) were added to a Parr autoclave containing a specified amount of catalyst. Afterwards, the autoclave was pressurized with H2 to 2.0 MPa and heated to the specified temperature. The reaction was stopped after a specified time, weighed with a certain amount of reaction solution, diluted with ethanol to a specific volume, and then analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent GC-7890) using the internal standard method. Mass spectrometry was performed using an Agilent 6890N GC/5973MS instrument."
6,Results and discussion,"The CuNi/Al-MCM-41 catalyst was prepared using the synthetic route, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a) . First, the morphologies of the CuNi/Al-MCM-41, Cu/Al-MCM-41, and Ni/Al-MCM-41 catalysts were examined by TEM, and the crystallographic structures were identified using a powder X-ray diffractometer by comparison with standard data. The TEM images revealed the uniform dispersion of the NPs on the Al-MCM-41 support for both monometallic catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1(b), Cu NPs were dispersed on the Cu/Al-MCM-41 catalyst surface, typically ranging in size from 2 to 14 nm with an average size of 8 nm. In the XRD patterns, the diffraction peak at 43.27° was assigned to the Cu (111) plane according to the database. In the case of Ni/Al-MCM-41, the average size of the Ni NPs was nearly 3.4 nm. The wide and weak XRD peak centered at 44.38° was assigned to Ni (111) diffraction planes. This indicated the Ni NPs were small and highly dispersed on the surface of the Al-MCM-41 support, which was in good agreement with the TEM observations. The XRD patterns of CuNi/Al-MCM-41 in Fig. 1(i) showed a narrow peak at 43.38°, which moved toward a higher angle compared to the monometallic Cu/Al-MCM-41. The lattice spacings were then compared for the three catalysts. The bimetallic CuNi/Al-MCM-41 catalyst had both relatively larger particles (20 to 100 nm) and smaller particles (3 to 5 nm). Furthermore, the interplanar spacing of the larger bimetallic NPs was determined to be 0.179 nm, and that of the smaller particles was 0.208 nm, indicating that bimetallic CuNi NPs formed because bulk Ni (200) and Cu (200) lattices exhibited spacings of 0.177 and 0.181 nm, while the Ni (111) and Cu (111) lattices exhibited spacings of 0.204 and 0.209 nm, respectively [18]. This all indicated that Cu and Ni are located nearby and may form bimetallic CuNi alloys or alloy-like components. To confirm the composition of the bimetallic CuNi NPs, STEM-HAADF and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping with line scanning were performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 . From the elemental maps of Cu and Ni, it was clear that the two elements overlapped, and the line scanning profiles revealed that the Cu and Ni atoms comprising the NPs were uniformly dispersed. These results are consistent with the XRD results and agree well with the previous literature [19]. As seen in Fig. S3, to confirm smaller CuNi bimetallic NPs, EDX spectra for the samples were analyzed. The smaller CuNi bimetallic NPs were highly dispersed on the Al-MCM-41 support, and the EDX spectra indicated that elements of Cu and Ni emerged, with a Cu atom percentage of 4.42% and Ni of 1.22%. All these observations proved that both types are CuNi bimetallic NPs of different sizes. Larger NPs may be formed by the aggregation of small NPs during cooling in the catalyst preparation process. Further characterization results showed that a small amount of Al in MCM-41 may contribute to the formation of CuNi bimetallic NPs. The hydrogenation rearrangement of FA was performed over different supported CuNi catalysts in the aqueous phase at 160 °C under 2.0 MPa H2, and the experimental results are shown in Fig. 3 . Considering that Lewis or Brønsted acids were proposed to be responsible for the FAL rearrangement [20], the acidic zeolites, including HY and ZSM-5, were investigated as supported CuNi catalysts. Both catalysts exhibited poor rearrangement activity, achieving low yields of CPO (23.1% and 38.8%, respectively). The dark brown color after reaction implied by-products were generated (see detailed discussion below), which may be attributed to the acidic sites located in HY and ZSM-5. When neutral carriers were employed, CuNi/MCM-41 gave a higher selectivity (43.7%) for CPO with moderate yields and a transparent reaction mixture color. In contrast, CuNi supported on Al-MCM-41 afforded improved performance, with 93.4% conversion and 59.7% selectivity to CPO. One of the possible reasons for the remarkable difference in the performance of the supports is the formation of bimetallic CuNi NPs on Al-MCM-41. As seen in Fig. 4 , the XRD pattern of CuNi/Al-MCM-41 only displayed a single peak at 43.38° between Cu (111) and Ni (111), indicating the formation of special structures, such as alloys or alloy-like components. In contrast, other molecular sieve-supported CuNi bimetallic catalysts displayed several complex peaks, which were assigned to monometallic Cu NPs and alloy/alloy-like components. It was noteworthy that CuNi/Al-MCM-41, with CuNi bimetallic NPs formed owing to the low content of aluminum evenly distributed in MCM-41, could afford an enhanced yield of CPO (for example, it reached 67.7% when using 10 mL of water in Fig.3). For comparison, SBA-15, a neutral mesoporous zeolite similar to MCM-41, was used as the support. However, CuNi/SBA-15 showed poor activity for hydrogenation rearrangement, affording the main product THFA, which is the product due to excessive hydrogenation and cannot be rearranged to CPO. Considering that the acidity of the supports may strongly influence the activity of the catalysts, the acidity of these catalysts was determined by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption using a chemisorption analyzer combined with a mass spectrum. The profile of CuNi/HY exhibited broad and intense desorption peaks (100–380 °C), which were assigned to weak and moderate acid sites and may be associated with acidic hydroxyl protons and Lewis acidic sites, respectively. For CuNi/ZSM-5, the enhanced NH3 consumption peaks centered at approximately 125 and 228 °C indicated weak and moderate acidity, respectively. In contrast, MCM-41, Al-MCM-41, and SBA-15 were all weakly acidic, with a weak desorption peak appearing at low temperatures (Fig. S5); thus, the possible variation in acidity upon Al was neglected. These results confirmed that the large number of acidic sites in zeolites was unfavorable for the rearrangement of FA, and might promote side reactions under such conditions. In order to verify the role of Al in MCM-41 support, we compared the difference of MCM-41 and Al-MCM-41 at contents of 0.5 wt%, 1.1 wt%, and 5.1 wt%. The results showed that there was a certain regularity between different Al contents and metal particle distributions. In the TEM image of the CuNi/MCM-41 catalyst without Al (Fig. S1), the particle size distribution was uneven, and the particles were larger. With the increase in Al content, the particle sizes decreased, which indicated that the small amount of Al may have an anchoring effect on the metal particles, making the metal particles smaller and more dispersed. Similarly, our previous research observed that the replacement of Si with Al could anchor the metal to achieve monodispersed Ni clusters with a mean diameter of 1.2 nm [21]. This anchoring effect might rationalize the formation of well-dispersed CuNi bimetallic NPs, which can potentially make highly efficient bimetallic catalysts. It should be noted that excess Al content was not beneficial for the tandem reaction. When 1.1 wt% was further increased to 5.1 wt%, the yield of CPO decreased from 59.7% to 47.0%, and the yield of by-products increased from 20.4% to 39.6% under the same reaction conditions as in Fig. 3. To investigate the surface chemistry of CuNi/Al-MCM-41 and clarify the synergistic effect between Cu and Ni, the Cu 2p, Ni 2p, and Cu LMM Auger spectra were collected and fitted using a Gaussian fitting method (Fig. 5 ). The peaks for Ni 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 in Ni/Al-MCM-41 located at 855.5 and 873.6 eV, as well as the satellite, indicated the existence of Ni2+. The bimetallic catalyst CuNi/Al-MCM-41 appeared at 856.0 and 874.1 eV. Similarly, the peaks at 933.5 and 953.4 eV of Cu/Al-MCM-41 were attributed to Cu 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks of Cu0 and Cu+, respectively [19,22–24]. The peaks of Cu0 and Cu+ were located at 933.0 and 952.9 eV in CuNi/Al-MCM-41. Cu LMM Auger spectra were obtained to make a further distinction and revealed the existence of the Cu0 and Cu+ peaks at 922.8 and 919.8 eV, respectively [25]. With CuNi bimetallic NPs formed, the photoemission peak of Cu 2p3/2 for CuNi/Al-MCM-41 (933.0 eV) had a negative shift of 0.5 eV with respect to Cu/Al-MCM-41, and the peak of Ni 2p 3/2 had a positive shift of 0.5 eV compared to Ni/Al-MCM-41, demonstrating the transfer of electrons from nickel to copper [26]. Therefore, this suggested that the copper and nickel were negatively and positively charged, respectively, in the CuNi bimetallic NPs. In addition, the Auger spectra of the Cu LMM were consistent with the XPS results. The peaks at 923.3 and 920.3 eV corresponded to Cu0 and Cu+, respectively, and moved towards higher binding energy, compared with those of the Cu/Al-MCM-41 (922.8 and 919.8 eV), as the changing trend of kinetic energy was reversed to that of the binding energy. These results confirmed the charge transfer between Cu and Ni in the bimetallic CuNi/Al-MCM-41 catalyst. Comparably, the catalytic performance of CuNi/Al-MCM-41, as shown in Table 1 , was higher than that of Cu/Al-MCM-41 or Ni/Al-MCM-41. In addition, a physical mixture of Cu/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-MCM-41 was used for the FA hydrogenation rearrangement reaction, showing 63.9% conversion and 38.8% CPO yield, which was much lower than that of CuNi/Al-MCM-41. This corroborated a bimetallic synergistic effect of Cu and Ni, which required the formation of highly dispersed bimetallic particles, as shown in the EDX profiles. Combined with the XPS analysis, the superior performance of the bimetallic catalyst might benefit from the charge polarization in the bimetallic NP surface, which was consistent with the previously reported noble bimetallic materials [27,28]. Tang et al. [29] proved that the introduction of Cu can influence the electronic structure of Ni and favor the transformation of the FA adsorption orientation; The adsorption intensity of the bimetallic catalyst for the furan ring was much weaker than that of the C=O group. Therefore, the electronic transfer between Cu and Ni within the bimetallic catalyst may contribute to improved catalytic selectivity compared to monometallic Ni or Cu catalysts. However, it does not rule out the influence of the size effect on the reaction selectivity, as the particle size of CuNi/Al-MCM-41 was larger than that of Cu/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-MCM-41. Protons released from water at higher temperatures could play a role in catalyzing the rearrangement, but might also lead to polymerization. Currently, insights into the positive and negative effects of water are insufficient. To investigate the influence of the proton concentration on the catalytic process, the initial reaction system pH was controlled in the range of 2.86–11.13, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . In the acidic solution with an initial pH of 2.86, the yield of CPO only reached 54.6%. As the pH increased, the yield of CPO increased significantly and that of the side product decreased. Notably, the optimal catalytic results appeared in a nearly neutral solution with a pH of 7.46. Further increasing the pH value decreased the yield of CPO. The results showed that neutral or weakly alkaline properties can effectively avoid side reactions. To study the sources of polymerization by-products, the experiments were conducted using FA, FAL, and HCP as starting substances in water, without any catalysts, under acidic, neutral, and basic conditions, respectively. The initial pH values were regulated to 2.81, 7.05, and 11.45, respectively, using H2SO4 or NaOH. As shown in Fig. 7 , the polymerization of substrate FA in acidic and alkaline conditions was slightly higher than that in neutral conditions, the intermediate FAL was more conducive to polymerization under acidic conditions, and the polymerization rate of intermediate 4-hydroxycyclopentenone was greatly enhanced under alkaline conditions. The FT-IR spectra of the dark yellow solid are presented in Figs. 7(d)–(f). Fig. 7(d) displays the characteristic FT-IR peaks of the solid generated from FA, which are consistent with those of humins [30,31]. As shown in Fig. 7(e), FT-IR analysis of the FAL-derived solid indicated the formation of poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA), which is consistent with the characteristic peaks of the bulk PFA reported in the literatures [32–34]. To further explore the low selectivity of acidic and basic conditions, the MALDI-TOF technique was used to monitor the polymers over the catalyst surface. After the reaction, the spent catalyst was washed with ethyl acetate, and the dissolved polymer solution was detected by MALDI-TOF to obtain the corresponding data. As shown in Fig. 8 , a spectrum of polymer fragments was observed in the range of m/z = 200–1000, and there were typical fragments from ethyl acetate soluble polymers (m/z = 701.5, 814.5, and 927.6). These phenomena confirmed that polymers were produced on the surface of the catalysts under both acidic and basic conditions, and might block the active sites on the catalyst, thus decreasing the catalytic activity of CuNi/Al-MCM-41. The factors influencing the hydrogenation rearrangement of FA were optimized to further increase the selectivity of CPO. Table 2 summarizes the results of the temperature dependence of the CuNi/Al-MCM-41 activity from 80 to 180 °C. Only the hydrogenation product FAL was obtained at 80 °C, confirming that hydrogenation could occur at lower temperatures [35]. As the temperature was increased to 120 °C or above, an obvious decrease in selectivity of FAL was observed, with the formation of rearrangement product CPO. When the temperature was increased to 180 °C, the FA conversion increased to 97.7%. The CPO selectivity increased until a temperature of 160 °C was used; however, it then decreased at 180 °C, with the highest CPO selectivity obtained at 160 °C. It must be noted that high temperatures may lead to more polymers, such as humins [31,36,37]. Moreover, the rearrangement occurring at high temperature has been proven in previous studies; increasing the reaction temperature can increase in a certain content the concentration of protons, which can promote the dehydration of FA and rearrangement reactions. As presented in Table 2, 99.0% conversion and 97.7% selectivity of CPO were achieved under a low concentration of FA. As mentioned above, the second step of the reaction is dehydration and rearrangement of FAL, and an increase in the proton proportion can promote the second step [20]. Hence, the decrease in the FA concentration was beneficial for the rearrangement process in the entire reaction. However, it has been shown that water may act as a nucleophile in the second step of the rearrangement [15,16]. A low concentration of FA indicated that the water concentration was relatively high in the system, which was beneficial for the second step of the rearrangement. When the ratio of FA to water reached 10 wt%, the yield of CPO decreased to 55.9%, and the side products accumulated to 30.3%. Moreover, the high concentration can easily cause the polymerization of FA, as the solvent can have a dispersion effect in the system. After the concentration of FA increased up to 20%, the yield of the other side products increased to 39.4%. It can be concluded that a low concentration of FA substrate was beneficial for the entire hydrogenation rearrangement reaction. Moreover, FAL was used as the starting substrate to investigate the catalytic performance of CuNi/Al-MCM-41 in the rearrangement step. However, the selectivity for excessive hydrogenation products, among others, increased, demonstrating that a high concentration of intermediate FAL can lead to low selectivity for CPO. A possible mechanism was proposed, as shown in Scheme 1 . The first step in the reaction was hydrogenation of FA to FAL, and a high selectivity to hydrogenate the carbonyl group was necessary. Both excessive and low activities in catalyzing hydrogenation were unfavorable for the tandem reaction, which may promote excessive hydrogenation or polymerization. Thus, the metal center in the catalyst needs to have suitable hydrogenation activity and high selectivity for the carbonyl group, for the intermediate FAL to be obtained. In this section, CuNi bimetallic NPs play an important role owing to their bimetallic structure. The inter-electron transfer between Cu and Ni over Al-MCM-41 may be an important factor in the high selectivity for hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. The second step of the reaction was the rearrangement of the intermediate FAL in water. The proton may promote FAL dehydration to form a carbocation intermediate for the rearrangement reaction. However, high concentrations under acidic conditions caused FAL polymerization, resulting in excessive hydrogenation. Subsequently, FAL rearranges to HCP, which is facile for polymerization under basic conditions. Therefore, the near-neutral condition was the most suitable for this tandem reaction. Subsequently, HCP was transferred into CPO via hydrogenation and dehydration over CuNi/Al-MCM-41."
7,Conclusions,"In this study, a bimetallic catalyst, CuNi/Al-MCM-41, was prepared and showed excellent performance in the tandem hydrogenation rearrangement of FA to produce CPO in a near-neutral solution. The HRTEM, EDS mapping, XRD, and XPS characterization results proved the formation of CuNi bimetallic NPs and charge transfer between Cu and Ni, which may lead to high efficiency in the hydrogenation rearrangement of FA. Detailed experimental results demonstrated that the near-neutral condition ensured that the hydrogenation rearrangement reaction runs along the target pathway and suppresses the side reactions of FAL and HCP. A low FA concentration was beneficial for the entire reaction, reducing side reactions and polymerization. The unique insights obtained from the results of this study can be used to create an efficient tandem catalytic system that combines the bimetallic synergistic effect and polymerization side reaction prevention."
