0,Introduction,"The constant depletion of traditional fossil energy and the intensification of environmental pollution are the inevitable result of an increase in the world population and our dependence on industry [1,2]. Renewable energy is currently the main alternative to produce chemicals and biofuels. Among various renewable energy sources, lignin has an enormous potential to replace petroleum and coal for a sustainable future, possessing a large number of available carbon sources in nature [3–5]. However, a large number of C-O bonds including α-O-4, β-O-4 and 4-O-5 linkages distribute in the molecular structure of lignin, which leads to the fact that it cannot be used directly. Particularly, 4-O-5 linkage owning the strongest bond energy is the most stable [6]. Selective depolymerization of lignin into small fragments can be achieved in many methods such as pyrolysis, hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis and oxidation [7–9]. After depolymerization of lignin, a large amount of highly oxidized aromatic monomers are available. Previous studies were focused on the cleavage of C-O bonds in these lignin-derived fragments and the products were mainly aromatics and alcohols [10–14]. Due to this situation, a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts based on Ni, Ru, Pd and Pt are rapidly developed in hydrogenolysis, hydrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation to cleave C-O bonds [15–19]. Apart from these general processes, it would be highly desirable to expand the alternative strategies with the basic of selective arenes hydrogenation for efficient application of lignin-derived compounds as the raw material [10]. As expected, selective aromatic ring hydrogenation plays a significant role in producing a wide variety of aliphatic compounds, which are the key starting materials for the synthesis of dyes, resins and polymers. The obtaining alicyclic ethers constitute a type of prospective intermediates in the generation of biofuels and fine chemicals [20–22]. Despite researchers have realized the importance of catalysts during the process, currently the design of highly active and selective catalysts for the production of alicyclic ethers from lignin-derived fragments is still a major challenge. In the selection of catalysts, ordinary metals such as nickel will be preferred due to the cheapness and wide existence. However, the relatively low activity limits their utilization in actual industrial production. In this respect, Shu et al. [23] reported that the selective aromatic ring hydrogenation of diphenyl ether (DPE) could proceed well over step by step precipitated Ni/SiO2, but the expense of 95.8% conversion and 46.8% selectivity was more catalyst amount and higher reaction temperature. Previous studies revealed that ordinary metals that were not suitable for aromatic ring hydrogenation generally had good cleavage capacity of C-O bonds with heating [24,25]. On the contrary, noble metal catalysts have received extensive attention because of their relatively high catalytic performance and the ability to undergo selective aromatic ring hydrogenation under mild conditions. Among them, ruthenium metal which has the advantage of lower price compared with other noble metals is developed rapidly in industry. As we known, the performance of catalyst can be improved by changing the morphology and size of the catalyst and the type of support [26,27]. Despite all these efforts, the reported system only exhibits low selectivity for the hydrogenation of some highly reactive lignin-derived compounds. Cui et al. [10] reported that the highly selective aromatic ring hydrogenation was achieved with the range of temperature from 60 to 100 °C over the nanostructured Ru catalysts modified with a C-N matrix, but one disadvantage was that the required reaction time was up to 24 h, indicting the low efficiency. Thus, it is essential to design a single catalyst with high activity and selectivity for aromatic ring hydrogenation. Here, based on our recent efforts, the catalyst of Ru metal supported on the macroporous Nb2O5 by an incipient wetness impregnation method could effectively promote the selective aromatic ring hydrogenation of multiple lignin-derived compounds at room temperature. The prepared Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst exhibited unique catalytic performance, which could not be achieved by general activated carbon and oxide supports. However, the reported Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst can only make the hydrodeoxygenation of some oxygen-containing compounds occur with heating [28]. Therefore, the additional catalytic performance of Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst was well exerted in aromatic ring hydrogenation. In order to better illustrate the activity and selectivity of the Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst, the hydrogenation reaction of DPE was explored under different influence parameters. And the catalyst was well characterized by mercury injection apparatus, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine to reveal the relationship between catalyst structure and activity."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterizations,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterizations The Ru/Nb2O5 catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. Typically, for 10% Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst, 0.228 g of the metal salt RuCl3·xH2O was put into the beaker and stirred for 15 min with the addition of appropriate amount of deionized water. Then 1 g Nb2O5 was added to the aqueous solution. After further stirred and ultrasound, the solution was placed in a vacuum box for 24 h. After the precipitation, the obtained mixture was dried at 105 °C for 12 h and calcined under an Ar flow at 300 °C for 3 h, followed by reduction at the same temperature under a H2 flow for 3 h. The catalysts were characterized by mercury injection apparatus, XRD, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, FTIR, SEM, HAADF-STEM and XPS. The detail materials, catalyst preparation and characterization methods were listed in the Supporting Information."
3,Catalytic reaction,"2.2 Catalytic reaction The conversion of the substrate was conducted in a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave. In this process, substrate (0.1 g), catalyst (10–50 mg) and solvent (20 mL) were added into the reactor together. After sealing, the residual air was removed by introducing H2 for three times. Then the reactor was pressurized to the required pressure with H2. Subsequently, the system was kept at room temperature (30 °C) for a certain period of time with stirring at 800 rpm. After the reaction, the system was directly depressurized. The resulting mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst, and the organic phase was analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) and gas chromatograph (GC). The conversion of the substrate and the product yield in the liquid phase were calculated as the following equations. Conversion = mole of substrate reacted total mole of substrate × 100 % Yield = mole of product total mole of substrate × 100 %"
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization In order to gain the distinct textural properties of the samples, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms was initially employed, but no corresponding results can be obtained due to the macroporous structure of catalyst. Then the samples were characterized by mercury injection apparatus and the detailed pore structure information was presented in Table 1 . It should be noted that the pores of 10% Ru/Nb2O5 and Nb2O5 were both large holes, which could be excellently observed in the SEM micrograph. The loading of Ru metal leaded to a corresponding decrease in the total pore area, average pore diameter and total intrusion volume of the catalyst. Although a smaller pore structure and a larger specific surface area would facilitate the distribution of active metals, it would also affect the catalytic reaction of some large molecules [29,30]. One advantage of the macroporous catalyst was that it allowed large molecules to enter the pores well and then catalyzed by active metals. Especially at room temperature without heating, the diffusion of molecules was relatively weak. In this case, the Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst could effectively catalyze the aromatic ring hydrogenation of the lignin derivatives. At the same time, the results indicated that the pore structure was not the main factor affecting the hydrogenation of aromatic rings. The H2-TPR profiles of Nb2O5 and unreduced 10% Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst were shown in Fig. 1 . Obviously, Nb2O5 could not be reduced in the temperature range studied, indicating that the support was very stable. In the profile of unreduced Ru/Nb2O5, only a strong and sharp reduction peak was observed at 150 °C, which was usually assigned to the reduction of highly dispersed RuO2 clusters interacted with Nb2O5. The catalyst contained a relatively narrow peak, suggesting the homogeneity of Ru species. Compared with reported Ru-based catalysts, a lower reduction temperature was caused by a relatively weak interaction between metallic Ru and the support [31,32]. Thence, the H2-TPR result revealed that the interaction between Ru and Nb2O5 would occur when the metal salt RuCl3·xH2O was impregnated in the support and then calcined in Ar at 300 °C. In addition, it was appropriate to set the reduction temperature at 300 °C to ensure that all Ru oxides were reduced to active metallic Ru. Fig. 2 demonstrated the XRD patterns of Nb2O5 and 10% Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst reduced at 300 °C. For Nb2O5, the typical diffraction lines at 2θ of 22.6°, 28.4°, 29.1°, 36.6° and 46.2° were attributed to the lattice planes of (001), (180), (210), (181) and (002), respectively [29,33]. Three diffraction peaks with 2θ of 38.4°, 44.2° and 69.4° appeared in the XRD patterns of reduced 10% Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst, respectively corresponding to (100), (101) and (110) crystal planes of metallic Ru. According to reported Ru-based catalysts, the characteristic peaks of metallic Ru were usually not very obvious due to the existence of very small Ru particles. However, it was noteworthy that the perks of reduced 10% Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst could be clearly observed, especially at 2θ of 44.2°, indicting the possible reason was the relatively high Ru loading [29,32]. Besides, the XRD result also revealed that metallic Ru was successfully loaded on the surface of Nb2O5 and it was metallic Ru rather than Ru oxides that possessed catalytic activity. As presented in Fig. 3 , the SEM micrograph of the Nb2O5 showed an agglomeration of parallelepiped particles. The highly crystallized particle shape was tightly combined and then exhibited many large pore structures with average pore size higher than 1 μm, which could be associated to the formation of a monoclinic H-Nb2O5 structure. According to previous literatures [34–36], the Nb2O5 in this study should be treated at a high temperature and held a very regular structure. Compared with the single spherical or rod-shaped structure, the porous structure of the sample was more conducive to metal loading and exerted catalytic performance [30,37]. In the SEM micrograph of the reduced 10% Ru/Nb2O5, it was obvious that metallic Ru providing high catalytic activity was evenly dispersed on the surface and the pores of Nb2O5. Additionally, Ru metal existed in the form of single and extremely small particles. This was the reason that the agglomeration was not observed. There was a certain interaction between Ru metal and Nb2O5, which also explained that the Ru metal could be successfully loaded on the smooth surface of the support. However, the smooth support surface would cause the interaction between Ru metal and the support to be weaker than reported Ru-based catalysts, resulting in a relatively low reduction temperature. Recently, it was found that the metal-loaded chemical state played an important role on the catalytic activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions. Considering previous report [34], that the proper chemical state of Ru specie over the niobium material could promote some reductive reactions, so the Ru state in Ru/Nb2O5 and Ru/C via the same preparation method was detected by XPS. As displayed in Fig. 4 , the binding energy was corrected with C 1 s and the peak at 284.8 eV was assigned to the binding energy of C–C. Since the peak of Ru 3d3/2 was overlaps with the C 1 s peak, the Ru 3d3/2 peak could not be used to determine the chemical site of Ru. Noticeably, the Ru 3d5/2 peak in Ru/Nb2O5 at the binding energy of 280.6 eV was attributed to Ru0, indicating the shift to a lower binding energy around 0.9 eV in comparison with that of Ru 3d5/2 in Ru/C because Nb2O5 could enhance the electron density of Ru [18,38], The electron-rich Ru sites in Ru/Nb2O5 contributed to the formation of active hydrogen over the Ru particles, which could promote aromatic ring hydrogenation of lignin-derived compounds."
6,Catalytic aromatic ring hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic aromatic ring hydrogenation The prepared catalyst was applied in the catalytic reaction of DPE. As shown in Fig. 5 , when this system was heated with the temperature range from 140 to 220 °C, the conversion of DPE maintained at 100%, implying the high activity of Ru/Nb2O5. In terms of the products distribution, it was found that the yield of oxydicyclohexane (OCE) gradually decreased with the increase of temperature and eventually disappeared at 220 °C. In contrast, the yields of cyclohexane (CHN) and cyclohexanol (CHL) increased slightly with the temperature increasing. During the heating process, most of the products were CHN and CHL after the cleavage of C-O bonds. It was worth noting that the yields of CHN and CHL were very high under mild conditions. According to literature [39], complete conversion of DPE could be achieved at 160 °C with the reaction time of 10 h, and the final products were CHN and CHL under Ru/C catalyst. In this case, when reaching the same standard, the reaction temperature would increase slightly, but the reaction time was greatly reduced. Namely, the efficiency of this reaction was improved. However, an important point should be mentioned was that the yield of CHN after the reaction was basically equal to CHL. While the Nb2O5 was used as the support in the reports [28,40], the reaction was often accompanied by hydrodeoxygenation, leading to a decrease in the yield of CHL in the products. Surprisingly, this hydrodeoxygenation reaction did not occur in the system. The main factor should be the low acidity of Nb2O5, which could be verified by the detection of NH3-TPD and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. The corresponding data was listed in the Supporting Information (Fig. S1). Exactly, Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst made the DPE cleavage directionally without hydrodeoxygenation. When the experiment was carried out at room temperature (30 °C) without the change of other parameters, DPE could also maintain at a high conversion and the yield of OCE was greatly improved. In order to maximize the yield of OCE, different influence parameters were investigated. The conversion of DPE at different reaction pressure was presented in Fig. 6 a. The conversion increased rapidly with the increase of H2 pressure and reached 100% at 2 MPa H2. A similar trend was that the yield of target product (OCE) gradually increased with the H2 pressure increasing and finally reached the maximum value (72.2%) at 3 MPa H2. The result clearly suggested that high H2 pressure could promote aromatic ring hydrogenation of DPE and lead to generate more OCE. The comparable results were consistent with the previous literatures concerning the effect of H2 pressure [29,41–43]. The conversion of DPE could be more than 80% at 1 MPa H2 and room temperature, indicating the high catalytic activity of Ru/Nb2O5. Without heating, DPE was hardly converted over Ru/C. In other words, Ru/Nb2O5 could achieve selective hydrogenation of aromatic rings at room temperature while Ru/C could not. The main factor was determined by the characteristics of the support material. The effective combination of Ru metal and Nb2O5 support exhibited a high catalytic activity of DPE conversion. One possible reason was that the catalyst with a large pore structure could guarantee that the reactant opportunely entered the pore and reacted on the active metal. Combining the reaction results of the above temperature, it could be concluded that the route of aromatic ring hydrogenation was highly favored at low temperature and high H2 pressure. Therefore, the optimum reaction pressure to maximize aromatic ring hydrogenation product was identified at 3 MPa H2. To further elucidate the internal reaction pathway, the kinetic behavior of DPE over Ru/Nb2O5 was up to 200 min at 3 MPa H2 and the result was displayed in Fig. 6b. Obviously, the DPE was fully converted at 80 min. The yield of target product reached the maximum value (72.2%) at 120 min and maintained unchanged with further increasing the reaction time. Before 120 min, a large number of intermediate products (monocyclic hydrogenation products) that were not further hydroconverted in time existed in the reaction system, resulting in a low yield of OCE. Along with the continuation of reaction time, the intermediate products were gradually converted in this process and eventually disappeared. Thence, 120 min was determined as the optimum reaction time to obtain the highest yield of target product. However, a significant point needed to be noted was that the yield of CHN via the C-O bonds cleavage was similar to CHL under sufficient H2 pressure, which indicated the absence of hydrodeoxygenation throughout the reaction. Compared with the literature [10] that selective hydrogenation of aromatic rings was achieved at 60 °C and 24 h using nanostructured Ru catalysts modified with a C-N matrix, Ru/Nb2O5 could effectively promote this reaction at room temperature and 2 h, suggesting high catalytic performance. Furthermore, the effect of catalyst loading on the catalytic efficiency was conducted at room temperature. As depicted in Fig. 6c, in the low Ru metal loading range (<10%), the increase of metal loading led to an increase in the conversion of DPE, which was ascribed to the participation of more Ru active metal. The yield of OCE produced via DPE aromatic ring hydrogenation kept increasing with the improvement of the loading and finally reached a plateau at a Ru metal loading of 10%. Despite gaining the full conversion with the loading of 7%, the yield of the target product could also be slightly improved. Taken together, the optimal loading in the system was selected as 10%. Fig. 6d showed that the catalyst feed could also affect the efficiency of aromatic ring hydrogenation of DPE. As expected, increasing the catalyst feed from 10 mg to 20 mg led to a sharp increase of DPE conversion, and a change in the OCE yield put up the same trend. DPE was completely converted at 20 mg of catalyst, whereas the yield of OCE was peaked after 30 mg, which was attributed to the fact that more catalyst usage could provide more active Ru metal to promote the conversion of DPE to OCE [18]. In order to maximize the yield of target product, the amount of catalyst was preferably controlled at 30 mg. In addition, the above investigations revealed that when OCE produced by aromatic ring hydrogenation was saturated, only three products (OCE, CHN and CHL) remained and the yield of CHN was equal to CHL. In this case, it was found that the ratio of OCE yield to CHN or CHL was approximately 3 to 1. Additionally, the solvent was an important influence factor on catalytic efficiency. According to previous reports [11,44,45], generally, the solvent could be used as a method to supply hydrogen for the hydrogenation reaction. Especially for isopropanol, the dehydrogenation itself led to the generation of acetone to provide hydrogen for the reaction. However, the reaction of aromatic ring hydrogenation did not occur in the presence of Ar. DPE is hardly converted in the absence of H2, indicating that H2 was the only hydrogen source for this reaction. What puzzled us was why the common hydrogen-donating solvents did not provide a hydrogen source in this system. The only difference was the different reaction temperature, so this possible reason could be attributed to the inability of these solvents to dehydrogenate at room temperature. The results of the reaction in different solvents with the existence of H2 were listed in Table 2 . Obviously, compared to alcohols, the conversion of DPE and the yield of the target product were extremely low in tridecane and tetralin. In the case where hydrogen was the only source of hydrogen supply, H2 entered the solvent and was split into two hydrogen radicals on the catalyst surface. At the same time, the generated active hydrogen combined with the reactant and then underwent a hydrogenation reaction over active Ru metal. What reminded us was that the diffusion of H2 in the solvent would have a great effect, especially at room temperature [46]. Furthermore, even in the absence of mass transport problem, the solubility of H2 in the reaction medium would also influence the performance of catalyst [47]. The larger H2 solubility and faster H2 mass transfer rate were more favorable for the hydrogenation reaction. Further analysis demonstrated the substantial conversion of DPE in methanol and ethanol. Nevertheless, the difference was that many intermediate products or by-products were present in methanol and ethanol, and the products after the cleavage of C-O bonds relatively increased. So in isopropanol, the catalytic performance could be better exerted over Ru/Nb2O5 for the aromatic ring hydrogenation reaction of DPE. In order to expand the scope of arene hydrogenation at room temperature, it was essential to explore more substrates over Ru/Nb2O5 in the selective hydrogenation of aromatic rings. Interestingly, these reactants in Table 3 were all completely converted, implying the high catalytic performance and greatly general applicability of the catalyst. Apart from DPE, the yields of other reactants all exceeded 80%, and even the yield of phenethyl ether reached 99.6%. The high aromatic ring hydrogenation efficiency of the catalyst could provide a theoretical basis or reference for the fine chemical, pharmaceutical industries and even biofuels. The biggest advantage was that a high yield of target product could be obtained at room temperature, which was a lack of many previously reported catalysts [10,23,48]. Most of the literatures [8,49] only reported that the C-O bonds were cleaved very well under heating conditions, but the catalysts often failed to exert catalytic activity at room temperature. Not to mention the selective hydrogenation of the aromatic ring at room temperature. Fortunately, the above results verified that Ru/Nb2O5 was highly efficient and selective for aromatic ring hydrogenation among various lignin-derived compounds."
7,Reaction pathway,"3.3 Reaction pathway The possible reaction pathway for DPE conversion over Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst was presented in Fig. 7 . Combining previous literatures [5,39,44] and experimental results, at higher temperature and lower H2 pressure, most of DPE underwent hydrogenolysis reaction under the catalysis of active metal Ru to generate benzene and phenol, followed by further hydrogenation to CHN and CHL. A small amount of DPE was converted into OCE by hydrogenation of the aromatic ring. In this case, it was observed that a large amount of CHN and CHL were distributed in the products from the reaction temperature diagram. Moreover, a higher temperature leads to a higher yield of the products via the C-O bonds cleavage. However, the transformation of DPE changed greatly with the reaction temperature controlled at room temperature (30 °C). Most of the DPE were directly hydrogenated to produce OCE, while on the contrary, a small part of them were converted into CHN and CHL by the cleavage of C-O bonds. The analysis results also revealed that the high H2 pressure was more conducive to promote the hydrogenation of aromatic rings at room temperature, which was consistent with the literature [40]. It was worth noting that the report [28] showed that Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst could promote hydrodeoxygenation reaction well. The reason why the hydrodeoxygenation reaction did not occur in this experiment was attributed to the acid loss of the catalyst."
8,Conclusions,"The prepared Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst with the macropore structure could efficiently promote the aromatic ring hydrogenation of multiple lignin-derived compounds at room temperature. Compared to the current reports, the higher reactant conversion and product yields could be achieved at lower reaction temperature, which was mainly ascribed to the fact that relatively lower bonding energy of Ru0 in Ru/Nb2O5 leaded to easier generation of active hydrogen. Due to the acid loss of the catalyst, the hydrodeoxygenation reaction did not occur, resulting in the same yield of CHN and CHL in the product. The relatively high H2 pressure and low reaction temperature were more conducive to promote the hydrogenation of aromatic rings. The ratio of the yield of OCE and the yield of CHN or CHL under optimal reaction conditions (30 °C, 3 MPa H2) was approximately equal to 3 to 1. The only hydrogen source for this reaction at room temperature was provided by H2 rather than solvents. Therefore, Ru/Nb2O5 was a promising catalyst to accelerate sustainable chemical production."
