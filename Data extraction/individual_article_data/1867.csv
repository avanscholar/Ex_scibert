0,Introduction,"Owing to global warming and depletion of fossil fuels, people are searching for substitutes for non-renewable energy resources to slow down this trend. Plenty of attempts have been made, such as developing novel high temperature fuel cells [1], solar cells [2,3], biofuel cells [4–6], utilizing wind and geothermal energy [7,8]. Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy resources to date, because of its high energy capacity and clean production [9–12]. However, to make hydrogen a practical energy for our daily life, we still need to find a cost-efficient, stable catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. Recently, a new class of two-dimensional material, C2N, has been synthesized by a simple wet-chemical reaction [13]. Its appropriate bandgap, high absorption coefficient and environmental-friendly composition make it promising for many applications, such as catalyst [14], drug carrier [15], gas sensor [16], hydrogen storage [17], CO2 capture [18]. However, most catalytic applications based on C2N are theoretical research, more experimental works are needed to investigate the electrochemical performance of C2N. In this study, a novel C2N based catalyst for HER is developed by a facile drop-coating method. It shows excellent stability in acidic environment and small Tafel slope, overpotential after depositing Pt clusters on it. The work offers valuable insights to the C2N catalyst for HER and provide a facile way to fabricate C2N based catalyst."
1,Methods,
2,Synthesis and characterization of C2N,"2.1 Synthesis and characterization of C2N The C2N in this work was synthetized according to the method reported by Javeed Mahmood et al. [13]. Hexaaminobenzene (HAB) and hexaketocyclohexane (HKH) were first mixed in a flask. The flask was placed under argon atmosphere and ice bath. Deoxygenated N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and a few drops of sulfuric acid were added to the flask. We then removed the ice bath and place the flask in room temperature for 2 h to make the flask to reach room temperature. The flask was then heated in oil bath to 175 °C for 8 h. After flask was cooled down to room temperature, the water was added. The product of C2N was then collected by suction filtration using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (0.5 mm) membrane. The chemical composition of C2N was characterized by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, QUANTERA-II SXM, PHI) and the morphology was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini 300, Zeiss)"
3,Preparation of C2N electrode,"2.2 Preparation of C2N electrode The C2N was first dissolved in alcohol solution and then stirred in ultrasonic cleaner for 40 min to obtain a uniform solution. Then, the solution was deposited on the surface of Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) substrate. After the solution was completely dried, a hole was firstly cut in the tape. Then, the sample is wrapped up with the tape to control the area exposed to the solution. To further improve the performance, 5 kinds of metallic particles were deposited onto the surface of C2N by PVD, including Au, Cu, Co, Ni, Pt. Pt nanoparticles were deposited by thermo evaporation system, Ni and Cu nanoparticles were deposited by magnetron sputtering, Co nanoparticles were deposited by MBE and Au nanoparticles were deposited by ion sputtering."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical analyses were carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using a typical three-electrode cell at 25 °C. The C2N deposited FTO substrate was used as the working electrode, while a calomel electrode and a carbon-rod were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The electrochemistry tests were carried out using a commercial electrochemistry station (CHI660). The photoelectrochemical property tests were performed under Xe solar stimulator (BBZM-I) illumination with power of 1300 W/m2."
5,Results and discussion,"To investigate the chemical composition of the C2N, XPS analyses of survey scan and core levels were performed. The survey scan spectrum indicates the presence of C1s, N1s, O1s. By analyzing the core levels of C1s and N1s (Fig. 1 b & c), the existence of C = C (284 eV), C-N (286.2 eV), C-heteroatom (288.5 eV) and pyrazine like N (397.5 eV) and pyrazine like N coordinated with metal (399.2 eV) can be found. These results agree well with the previous reports [13,19]. To investigate the electrochemical properties of C2N, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)were applied. As shown in Fig. 2 a & b, the cyclic voltammetry curves at scan rate range from 10 mV/s to 200 mV/s show different current maximum (Ip) in the same scan voltage. By plotting the relation between current maximum (Ip) and the square root of scan rate according to the randles–sevcik equation [20], the effective area of the C2N electrode was calculated to be 0.4655 mm2. In order to test the stability of C2N based electrode, recycling experiments by cyclic voltammetry methods for 2500 cycles were carried out. After recycling, the overpotential and Tafel slope of C2N shows a slightly decrease (Fig. 2 c & d), symbolizing excellent stability in acidic environment (pH = 0). Fig. 3 a shows the SEM images of the metal particles with diameters ranging from 3 nm to 12 nm, which are well dispersed on the surface of C2N. LSV measurements justify that the Pt deposited C2N greatly outperforms other 4 kinds of metals, exhibiting the smallest overpotential of 33 mV and Tafel slope of 53 mV/dec (Fig. 3b & c). Fig. 3d also shows that the Pt deposited C2N exhibits smallest impedance. That means a quite small charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. EIS results can well explain the LSV performance, suggesting that the Pt deposited C2N could be a most promising catalyst for practical applications for HER in the future. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between the pure noble-metal clusters, noble-metal clusters plus C2N and noble-metal clusters plus C2N. As depicted in Fig. 4, all kinds of multi-catalysts actually have better effects for the HER reaction than pure C2N or metallic particles, including smaller overpotentials and Tafel slopes. In addition, with extra illumination, the overpotential and the Tafel slope of metallic particles coated C2N electrodes also drops, demonstrating the positive effect of C2N in the metal/C2N material system for photocatalytic application."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, a facile drop-coating method to deposited C2N onto the FTO substrate to prepare the electrochemical electrode for HER application was developed. The pure C2N is found to be a relatively stable catalyst for HER. To further enhance the electrochemical performance of C2N based catalyst, 5 kinds of metallic particles were deposited onto the surface of C2N. The results indicated Pt deposited C2N exhibited the smallest overpotential, Tafel slope, suggesting that the Pt coated C2N may be a promising catalyst for HER in the future."
