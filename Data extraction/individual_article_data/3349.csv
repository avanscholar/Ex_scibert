0,Introduction,"Fossil fuel is today's major global energy resource and causes global atmospheric pollution problems during its combustion. Hydrogen is an ideal, clean and sustainable energy source for the future because of its high conversion and nonpolluting nature. Fermentative hydrogen production processes are more environmentally friendly and less energy intensive compared to thermo-chemical and electrochemical processes and shown to have the greatest hydrogenic bioprocess application potential [1]. Biological hydrogen production is more attractive if organic wastewater or other wastes could be used as the raw material. Organic wastewater and wastes always contain a variety of components requiring various microorganisms to perform the degradation process. Anaerobic hydrogen-producing sewage sludge is a good microflora source for organic waste fermentative hydrogen production [2–4]. Sulfate is found in some wastes produced from pulp/paper, sea-food processing and the alcohol fermentation industry. These wastes contain a biomass that is a good source for biohydrogen production. However, high sulfate content adversely affects anaerobic digestion [5]. Since fermentative hydrogen production is biochemical anaerobic digestion, the hydrogenic microbes might be readily affected by the presence of sulfate, which decreases hydrogen production efficiency. Furthermore, the production of hydrogen sulfide gas in the biogas becomes a concern when biohydrogen is used for fuel cells because this gas is toxic to certain fuel cell materials. Studies on the sulfate effects on anaerobic systems have always focused on sulfate-reducing bacteria with acid or methane-producing bacteria [6–8]. Little consideration has been given to the hydrogen fermentation process. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) may compete with methanogens for the same electron donors, acetate and hydrogen [5]. Acetate and hydrogen are the main products in the hydrogen fermentations process. It is important to elucidate whether or to what extent SRB may consume acetate and hydrogen in the hydrogenesis process. Understanding the effects of sulfate on hydrogenesis permits the successful control of the hydrogen fermentation for sulfate-rich substrates. In this study, we used a sulfate-rich substrate in hydrogenic experiments to investigate the sulfate effect on the anaerobic mixed microflora for hydrogen production. Specifically, the process efficiency and operation effects are elucidated. Sucrose is readily found in a variety of biomass-related industrial wastes and was used as the substrate."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The sludge was obtained from the wasted sludge at a municipal sewage treatment plant (an activated sludge process, at Taichung). The collected sludge was screened with a No. 8 mesh (diameter 2.35mm). The pH, volatile suspended solids (VSS, to express the biomass concentrations) and total solids concentrations of the seed sludge were 6.81, 33280mg/l and 65130mg/l, respectively."
3,Substrate,2.2 Substrate Sucrose was used as the substrate with a concentration of 20g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/l. The substrate contained sufficient inorganics for bacterial growth ([9]; mg/l): NH4HCO3 5240; K2HPO4 125; MgCl2 · 6H2O 100; MnSO4 · 6H2O 15; FeSO4 · 7H2O 25; CuSO4 · 5H2O 5; CoCl2 · 5H2O 0.125; NaHCO3 6720.
4,Reactor and operation,"2.3 Reactor and operation A CSTR (continuously stirred tank reactor) bioreactor with a working volume of 4.0l was operated at a temperature of 35 ± 1 ° C and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12h. The substrate was fed in a continuous mode. The bioreactor was started-up with no sulfate (the control) with a pH of 6.5 (favorable pH value for hydrogen production [10,11]). When the steady-state condition was reached and the desired data obtained, three sulfate effect experimental runs were conducted stepwise with sulfate concentrations of 500, 1500 and 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l . The pH values were maintained at 6.7. After a 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l run was finished the reactor was operated for another run at the same sulfate concentration with a pH of 5.5 (another favorable pH value for hydrogen production [10,12]). At each run the reactor was operated for more than 10 times the HRT to develop steady-state conditions. Steady-state conditions reached when the product concentrations such hydrogen gas content, biogas volume and effluent volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were stable (less than 10% variation). For each steady-state data measurement at each run, an average of 20–30 samples was determined. The reactor was routinely monitored for pH, alkalinity, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), gas production and composition, sucrose concentration, sulfate concentration, VFA distribution and VSS concentration. The gas volumes were corrected to a standard temperature (0 °C ) and pressure (760mmHg) (STP)."
5,Analyses,"2.4 Analyses The mixed liquors sampled were centrifuged ( 900 g , 15min) and the supernatants were taken for VFA analysis. VFA and ethanol were analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame ionization detector. Biogas composition except hydrogen sulfide was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having and a thermal conductivity detector. Hydrogen sulfide gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph having a flame photometric detector (capillary column, 150 ° c ; injection temperature, 150 ° C ; carrier gas, N2). Other analytical details for the VFA, ethanol and biogas assays were the same as those in our previous study [2,3]. Turbidimetric and methylene blue methods in Standard Methods [13] were used for analyzing sulfate and hydrogen sulfide concentrations in the mixed liquor, respectively. Anthrone-sulfuric acid method was used to measure sucrose [14]. Other water quality parameters were measured according the procedures of Standard Methods [13]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Reactor operation,"3.1 Reactor operation Fig. 1 presents the daily variation in gas and liquid content for the reactor operation. The ORP ranged - 472 – - 429 mV , values favorable for hydrogen production [15]. The biogas production varied during the changes in sulfate concentration. Higher sulfate concentrations inhibited hydrogen gas production. The most obvious biogas reduction occurred at the 500mg SO 4 2 - / l experimental run at which the biogas production decreased by 16% (50l/day vs. 60l/day for the control). The biogas reduction in two other experimental runs, 1500 and 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l at a pH of 6.7 was not obvious. This sulfate concentration-dependent biogas reduction difference resulted from the fact that the reactor microflora was gradually acclimated to the sulfate environments. Biogas production recovery was observed when sulfate concentration increased in the fermenter (discussed later). Though the sulfate concentration was as high as 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l the biogas production recovered completely when the operating pH was reduced to 5.5. At this low pH environment, hydrogenic microorganisms dominated and the sulfate-reducing bacteria could not survive [12,16]. The variation in the hydrogen gas content that responded to the increasing sulfate concentration agreed with the biogas values. However, hydrogen gas production recovery was much more obvious (170–180days and 210–220days)."
8,Data under steady-state conditions,"3.2 Data under steady-state conditions Table 1 summarizes the experimental results obtained at each run for the reactor under steady-state conditions. Sucrose degradation was high ( > 97.6%) through the experiments showing bio-reaction progress. During fermentation, sucrose was converted into biomass, hydrogen gas and liquid metabolites. The average VSS concentrations were in the range of 4.0–4.7g/l. The average hydrogen gas contents ranged from 27 to 50% (v/v). The high sulfate concentration of 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l markedly reduced the hydrogen content (from 42% to 27%). However, by decreasing the pH to 5.5 the hydrogen content increased drastically to 50%. Another present major gas was carbon dioxide. Hydrogen production from anaerobic degradation of organics is accompanied with VFA production. The total VFA concentrations ranged from 4650 (at 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l , pH 6.7) to 10000mg COD/l (the control, and at 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l and pH 5.5) and its increase tendency agreed with the hydrogen production trend. Acetic (HAc), propionic (HPr), butyric (HBu) acids and ethanol were the major liquid metabolites. A small amount of valeric acid (23–44mg COD/l) was determined and iso-HBu (261mg COD/l) only appeared in the pH 5.5 run. The appearance of iso-HBu marked the increase in n -HBu concentration. A marked decrease in the ethanol concentration and a marked increase in the hydrogen gas content implied a shift in the predominant organisms or metabolic pathway."
9,Sulfate conversion during hydrogen fermentation,"3.3 Sulfate conversion during hydrogen fermentation Under anaerobic environments, sulfate is reduced to sulfite and then to sulfide. The type of sulfide compounds in water is pH-dependent: H 2 S (low pH) ← → HS - (neutral pH) ← → S 2 - (high pH) In the present study, the residual sulfate concentration fraction in the effluent slightly increased with the dosed sulfate concentrations; at pH 6.7 and sulfate concentrations of 500, 1500 and 3000 mg SO 4 2 - / l the residual sulfate concentration fractions were 85.2%, 87.7% and 88.5%, respectively. At 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l with a pH of 5.5 the residual sulfate concentration fraction was as high as 98.6% which shows that the acidic environment not favorable to SRB and sulfate reduction did not occur [16]. Fig. 2 depicts the concentration evolution of total sulfide ( TS - S = dissolved sulfide ( DS - S ) + unsolved sulfide ). Dissolved sulfide included ionic sulfides of HS - and S 2 - . The highest concentration values of total sulfide, dissolved sulfide and hydrogen sulfide gas ( H 2 S ( g ) ) were 73mg/l, 60mg/l and 100ppm, respectively. Hydrogen sulfide, a fuel cell-hazardous gas, was below detection level ( < 224ppb) for the control but increased to 100ppm at 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l at pH 6.7. However, this gas almost disappeared ( < 0.1ppm) when the operating pH was reduced to 5.5. Hydrogen sulfide gas resulted from sulfate consumption (1.4–14.8%) by SRB in the hydrogenic mixed microflora. These SRB consumed sulfate by using the fermentation products, VFAs and ethanol, as the electron donors [17]. The production of sulfide from sulfate reduction could be estimated by linearly regressing sulfide and sulfate concentrations: [ TS - S ] = 0.0248 [ SO 4 2 - ] - 3.0068 ( R 2 = 0.993 ) ; [ DS - S ] = 0.0202 [ SO 4 2 - ] - 3.0119 ( R 2 = 0.983 ) ; [ H 2 S ( g ) ] = 0.0338 [ SO 4 2 - ] - 2.0476 ( R 2 = 0.988 ) ."
10,Hydrogen production,"3.4 Hydrogen production The sulfate effects on microflora hydrogenic activity were evaluated using the variation in the hydrogen yield (the ability converting substrate into hydrogen, HY), hydrogen production rate (the rate of hydrogen production from a fermenter, HPR) and specific hydrogen production rate (the rate of hydrogen production from a fermenter by a unit weight of biomass, SHPR). Fig. 3 depicts the daily variations in HY, HPR and SHPR. Hydrogen production decreased when the sulfate concentration increased. Compared with the control, the HY values at sulfate concentrations of 500, 1500 and 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l (at pH 6.5) decreased by 24, 40 and 64%, respectively. The decrease in hydrogen production might relate to (1) hydrogen sulfide toxicity and (2) hydrogen consumption by SRB. In an anaerobic environment, sulfate will be converted into hydrogen sulfide by SBR and this sulfide results in toxicity to other anaerobes [5]. SRB are reported to have hydrogen-utilization hydrogenase and can readily use hydrogen as the electron donor [16,18]: (1) SO 4 2 - + 4 H 2 + H + → HS - + 4 H 2 O Δ G 0 = - 151.9 KJ Though decreased at high sulfate concentrations, hydrogen production markedly recovered and increased when the pH was reduced to 5.5, even when the sulfate concentration was as high as 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l . Under this environmental condition the HY, HPR and SHPR values were 3.6molH2/molsucrose, 374mmolH2/l/day and 90mmolH2/gVSS/day, respectively, which were all about 300% higher than those at the same sulfate concentration but at pH 6.5. Moreover, these parameter values were about 40% higher than those for the control, as reported on biohydrogen production from sucrose without any sulfate addition [2,3]. Efficient hydrogen production was obtained at high sulfate concentrations by lowering the operating pH. There were many recovery experiences in methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion suffered from an inhibitor-shock load [19]. The hydrogen production recoveries from increased sulfate concentration were sulfate concentration-dependent and the recovery times were long when the sulfate concentrations were high. The decrease in hydrogen production was immediate and the recovery time was 10–20 days with high sulfate concentrations. The recovery extent ranged from 67% to 77% with high sulfate concentrations. The dissolved oxygen sag curve model (Eq. (2)) has been used to describe the methanogenesis recovery progress in anaerobic digestion [19,20]. Using the SHPR values obtained from each sulfate concentration test to fit the recovery pattern model, the results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . (2) A h = Ae - k 1 + Be k 2 A h is specific hydrogenic activity (mmolH2/gVSS/day); A and B are initial and inhibited specific hydrogenic activities, respectively; t is reaction time (day); k 1 and k 2 are toxicity inhibition and recovery rate constants (1/day), respectively. Table 2 reveals that the A , k 1 and B values decreased with the increase in sulfate concentration but k 2 increased. Since the k 1 value responds to the inhibitory behavior, a high value indicates serious inhibition. In this study, k 1 values ranged from 0.561/day at 500mg SO 4 2 - / l to 0.111/day at 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l . This suggests that though the sulfate concentration increased, the microflora became more resistant to the toxicity, which resulted from organism acclimation. This agrees with the sulfate degradation tendency that no decrease in this degradation was observed at high sulfate concentration. As mentioned above, the residual sulfate fractions were 85.2–88.5% in the pH 6.5 test run. On the other hand, k 2 value responds the recovery behavior from inhibition with high value expressing high recovery rate. k 2 values increased from 0.061/day at 500mg SO 4 2 - / l to 0.221/day at 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l . Higher recovery rate was obtained at higher sulfate concentration. This also indicates that gradually increasing the sulfate concentration to acclimate the microflora enhanced the microflora toxicity-resistance to sulfate. Fig. 4 also reveals that except for the second test run (the first run adding sulfate into the reactor) no drastic decrease in hydrogenic activity was observed."
11,Variations in VFA and soluble metabolite product (SMP) concentrations,"3.5 Variations in VFA and soluble metabolite product (SMP) concentrations Anaerobic systems often involve the action of several microbial groups to degrade organic matter into H2, CH4 and CO2 accompanying the production of VFAs and SMP. Acetic (HAc), propionic (HPr) and butyric (HBu) acids were the acid products produced with HBu as the major product in all test runs. This system produced butyrate type fermentation [21]. The HBu concentrations decreased with increasing sulfate concentrations, from 6309mgCOD/l (control) to 3184mgCOD/l (3000mg SO 4 2 - / l at pH 6.7). Ethanol has been reported as the major SMP during anaerobic saccharide degradation. The ethanol concentrations increased with increasing sulfate concentration, from 2483mgCOD/l (control) to 4508mgCOD/l (3000mg SO 4 2 - / l at pH 6.7). Since at high sulfate concentration the hydrogen production was low, high ethanol concentrations accompanied low hydrogen production. High hydrogen production resulted from lowering operating pH to 5.5 at 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l also corresponded to quite low ethanol concentration (380mgCOD/l). Many reports gave similar experiences of ethanol concentration-dependent hydrogen production [2,3]. Table 3 summarizes the VFA and SMP fractions in the effluents. At pH 6.7, the sulfate concentration increased from 0 to 3000mg SO 4 - 2 / l resulting in a decrease in the HBu fractions (from 50.5 to 34.8%) and an increase in the ethanol fractions (from 19.9 to 40.3%). This result implies that the metabolic pathway shifted from hydrogen production favorable HBu fermentation into energy-consuming ethanol fermentation that was unfavorable to hydrogen production. For high hydrogen production in the control and 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l at pH 5.5 runs, the VFA and SMP fractions in the effluent were generally in the order of HBu (50–76%) > HAc (16–23%) > ethanol (7–20%) > HPr (2–7%). When the reactor was low in hydrogen production at 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l and pH 6.7 the fractions were ethanol 49%, HBu 35%, HAc 11%, HPr 5%. Quite low levels (3%) of iso-HBu were determined only at the pH 5.5 run in which hydrogen production peaked. At pH 5.5, peak hydrogen production, some metabolites presenting low hydrogen production decreased obviously. For example, the ethanol fraction was down to 3.6% (from 49%). Based on the marked differences in hydrogen production and metabolite distribution between the results obtained at pH 6.7 and 5.5, a shift in the predominant organisms occurred [22]. At pH 5.5, SRB could not survive and highly active hydrogen dominated. Microscopic examination by scanning electronic microscopy showed the shift in morphological type in the predominant organisms when the pH was changed from 6.7 to 5.5. At pH 6.7, coccoid and bacilli were observed in the reactor. Coccoids disappeared completely at pH 5.5. Some SRB such as Desulfococcus used acetate as the coccoid electron donor. Fig. 5 depicts the relationships between the TVFA/SMP ratio, ethanol/SMP ratio, HPR and sulfate concentration. A similar variation tendency was observed in the TVFA/SMP ratio and HPR with the sulfate concentration. The TVFA/SMP ratio, therefore, could be used as an indicator for monitoring hydrogen production in dark fermentation from a sulfate-rich substrate."
12,Significance of the experimental results,"3.6 Significance of the experimental results The variations in recovery pattern model constants (Table 2) and less steep decrease in hydrogenic activity (Fig. 4) strongly imply the effectiveness of microflora acclimation to a high sulfate concentration environment. This indicates that using sulfate-acclimated microflora to start-up a hydrogen production fermenter is a good strategy when using sulfate-rich substrate as the feed. Many organic industrial wastewaters such as paper and food processing factory contain saccharides that might contain high sulfate concentrations to thousands of mg/l. Hydrogen sulfide content in the biogas is an important factor affecting the application of fermentative biohydrogen gas in fuel cells. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic to fuel cells and decreases the cell life span. No hydrogen sulfide and other hazardous gas such as carbon monoxide were determined in the control fermenter. The hydrogen sulfide gas concentration was less than 100ppm at 3000 SO 4 2 - / l fermenter and was less than 0.1ppm at pH 5.5. These low levels of hydrogen sulfide gas enhance the application effectiveness of fermentative biohydrogen gas. Moreover, the reduction in operating pH to 5.5 drastically reduced the hydrogen sulfide concentration (from 100ppm to < 0.1 ppm ) and efficiently promoted hydrogen production by 40% (vs. the control). This suggests that maintaining an operating pH lower than the SRB's growth range is a necessary strategy to obtain a low H2S level in biogas and higher HY and HPR values in fermentative hydrogen production from a sulfate-rich substrate. High HY and HPR values indicate high hydrogen fermentation efficiency."
13,Conclusions,"During dark fermentation using enriched mixed-microflora, sulfate will inhibit hydrogen production by changing the metabolic pathway from a butyrate to ethanol fermentation. However, this sulfate inhibition will recover in a sag curve pattern model. Moreover, this inhibition can be depressed by lowering the operating pH to a level unfavorable to growing sulfate-reducing bacteria while favoring active hydrogen. At the sulfate concentration of 3000mg SO 4 2 - / l , by lowering the pH 6.7 to 5.5 resulted in about a 40% increase in HY, HPR and SHPR with 3.6molH2/molsucrose, 374mmolH2/l/day and 90mmolH2/gVSS/day values, respectively."
