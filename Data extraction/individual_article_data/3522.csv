0,Introduction,"Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) – a biodegradable, compostable, and renewable polymer – is the most researched commercial bio-based polymer with properties that can be tailored by controlling its chiral structure composition [1,2]. Although PLA has been produced on a large scale since early 2005 [3] and it has been used in the medical, textile, agricultural, and packaging fields [1,4–7], it is a relatively new polymer and its properties, such as morphologies in different environmental conditions and interactions with different chemicals, are not yet fully comprehended. One concern for PLA is that its properties can be affected by the service and storage environments such as temperature, humidity, and contacted substances. Changes in properties of PLA have been observed when PLA is in contact with solvents and solutions [8,9]. Effects of water vapor and liquid water on PLA have been extensively evaluated due to the inherent hydrolytic behavior of the PLA chemical structure [9–15]. PLA may also be exposed to organic solvents and aqueous solutions, resulting in swelling as well as changes in its morphological structure, and therefore, thermal and mechanical properties [8,9,16–19]. Evidence of solvent-induced crystallization in PLA, where permeation of selected solvents into the amorphous phase of PLA swells the polymer matrix and promotes crystallization, has also been shown [9,17,20,21]. Despite extensive studies on the effects of organic solvents and aqueous solutions on PLA morphologies, only a limited number of studies addressed the changes happening in-situ, that is when PLA is immersed in solvents. As the glass-rubber transition (T g ) measurement is one of the experimental methods used to determine plasticization effects of solvents on polymeric materials [22], some initial information about in-situ changes of PLA's T g in selected alcohols and aqueous solutions have been reported by Iñiguez-Franco et al. [9]. Using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) immersion equipment, they reported that the measured T g of PLA dropped during immersion in ethanol and ethanol aqueous solutions, and that T g decreased when the concentration of ethanol in aqueous solutions increased. In contrast, T g of PLA measured after immersion in methanol and ethanol using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique [8,23] did not show significant reductions. These findings suggest that PLA undergoes a glass-rubber transition during immersion that is not observed after immersion. Such a reversible reaction might be limited to a short-term immersion. Further investigation is needed to clarify the time frame and other factors that affect the transition. A typical commercial grade PLA has a T g around 58 ± 2 °C [24]. Since PLA may be exposed to heat such as from direct sunlight or elevated temperatures during storage and end-use applications, the glass-rubber transition can cause adverse effects on the properties of the polymer. Additionally, it is possible that the solvents or solutions that PLA is in contact with will affect its T g . To design suitable applications for PLA, it is necessary to understand and evaluate its useful temperature range when exposed to vapors and solvents, as well as the actual T g during working conditions (i.e., in-situ). Alcohols are well-known food simulants, commonly present in medicines and alcoholic beverages, and likely to be in contact with PLA. Thus, alcohols were chosen as the solvents for this study. The aim of this study was to determine the in-situ changes in PLA's thermo-mechanical properties when immersed in alcoholic solutions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these in-situ changes in properties of PLA in alcoholic solutions have not been reported in the literature. The specific objective of this study was to determine the changes in T g of PLA in selected aliphatic alcohols with C1 to C10 in the main chain (i.e., methanol to decan-1-ol), alcohols with different isomers (i.e., propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol), and aqueous solution (50% v/v) of propan-2-ol at different concentrations."
1,Experimental,
2,Film production,"2.1 Film production PLA cast film made from PLA Ingeo™ 2003D resin (NatureWorks, LLC, Minnetonka, MN, USA) was produced in a Randcastle Microtruder (Randcastle Extrusion Systems, Inc., Cedar Grove, NJ, USA) with a 1.5875 cm diameter screw, 34 mL volume and 24/1 L/D ratio at 193–215 °C and 49 rpm. PLA pellets were dried at 60 °C for 24 h prior to film processing. Thickness of the produced amorphous neat PLA film was 20 ± 5 μm. To minimize physical aging, the film was stored in a freezer (−20 °C) until use, and preconditioned at 23 °C and 50% RH for 24 h immediately prior to testing. The number average molecular weight (M n ), the weight average molecular weight (M w ), and the polydispersity index (PDI) of the film measured by size-exclusion chromatography (Waters 1515 Isocratic HPLC pump, Waters 717plus autosampler, and Waters 2414 refractive index detector, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) using tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as a solvent were 95 kg/mol, 171 kg/mol, and 1.8, respectively."
3,Solvents,"2.2 Solvents The solvents used for immersion tests were a series of selected pure aliphatic (straight-chain) alcohols with the number of carbon atoms C1–C10 (i.e., methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, butan-1-ol, hexan-1-ol, octan-1-ol, nonan-1-ol, and decan-1-ol), a pure branched chain alcohol C3 (propan-2-ol), and pure water. A mixture of 50% (v/v) propan-2-ol in water was used as an alcoholic aqueous solution. Except for octan-1-ol and decan-1-ol, which were purchased from EMD-Millipore (Burlington, MA, USA), solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the solvents were in the liquid state and were used as received. Table 1 shows the properties of the solvents."
4,Thermal and thermo-mechanical property measurements,"2.3 Thermal and thermo-mechanical property measurements 2.3.1 Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) A DSC (Q100, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) calibrated with indium standards was used to measure the thermal properties of PLA films before immersion. Film samples of 5–10 mg were weighed and sealed in a TA Instruments hermetic aluminum pan and the thermal analysis was performed under nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 70 mL/min. In the first heating cycle, the sample in a sealed pan was equilibrated at 20 °C, cooled to −50 °C, heated from −50 to 200 °C, and remained isothermal for 1 min. Then, the system continued to the second heating cycle where the sample was cooled to −50 °C and finally heated to 200 °C. The temperature ramp rate for all the cycles was 10 °C/min. The samples were tested at least in triplicate. The results were analyzed with TA Instruments Universal Analysis 2000 software version 4.5A, and the T g values were determined from the inflection point at the step change in the DSC thermogram. 2.3.2 Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) An RSA-G2 Solids Analyzer DMA unit (TA Instruments) was used to measure the thermo-mechanical properties of PLA films before and during (in-situ) immersions. The RSA-G2 settings were as follows: loading gap 15 mm, max gap changes up 5–10 mm, max gap changes down 1 mm, preload force 100 g, strain 0.2%, frequency 1 Hz, and temperature ramp rate 5 °C/min. For each DMA experiment, a 10 mm × 50 mm film sample was mounted to the tension clamps. For the in-situ immersion experiments, the RSA−G2 immersion cell, which was equipped with a removable cylindrical cup with two enclosing semicircle lids, was installed. The solvent was precooled to the starting temperature and poured into the immersion cell that contained a mounted PLA sample. The lids were closed throughout the test to minimize solvent evaporation. Liquid nitrogen and air, connected to the RSA-G2's forced convection oven, were used for cooling and heating. The DMA temperature ramp started at 25 °C for dry film, as well as for films subjected to in−situ water and aqueous solution immersions. On the other hand, starting temperatures ranging from −5 to 10 °C were used for the in−situ pure alcohol immersion experiments. Once the required starting temperature was reached, the temperature was ramped at 5 °C/min to the end temperature which was approximately 20 °C above the temperature at peak tan (delta). The samples were tested at least in triplicate. The storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan (delta) data were obtained and the results were analyzed with TRIOS software version 4.5.0 (TA Instruments). The peak tan (delta) value was recorded as the film's T g ."
5,Statistical analysis,"2.4 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis to compare the T g values of dry PLA and PLA immersed in alcohols and alcoholic solutions was conducted by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean comparisons of the T g values were determined by Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) tests using SAS analytics software (University Edition, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) at a significance level of 0.05."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Pre-immersion properties,"3.1 Pre-immersion properties Fig. 1 a shows a typical DMA result for a dry PLA sample (pre-immersion) including the storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan (delta) (i.e., the ratio of the loss modulus to the storage modulus). The T g for pre-immersion PLA samples measured from peak tan (delta) was 62.9 ± 1.0 °C. Fig. 1b shows a typical second heating scan of a pre-immersion PLA sample from the DSC. As determined from the DSC, the T g , the cold crystallization temperature (T c ), and the melting temperature (T m ) were 60.6 ± 0.1 °C, 126.1 ± 0.5 °C, and 150.9 ± 0.3 °C, respectively. The crystalline fraction (X C ), the mobile amorphous fraction (X MAF ), and the rigid amorphous fraction (X RAF ) determined from the DSC as described by Magoń and Pyda [27] were 0.5 ± 0.2%, 78.8 ± 5.1%, and 20.7 ± 4.9%, respectively. The low X C indicates that the film was practically amorphous and that the X RAF should not affect the evolution of T g [28,29]. Besides DSC analysis, X-ray diffraction pattern from a diffractor (AXS D8, Bruker Co., Billerica, MA, USA), acquired from 2° to 20° 2θ at a rate of 0.20°/min and 0.01° increment, did not reveal any sharp peaks (Section S1), confirming that the PLA sample was amorphous. The T g values of dry PLA film, measured from DMA and DSC, were statistically different."
8,Effects of alcohol chain length,"3.2 Effects of alcohol chain length Fig. 2 shows the in-situ immersion test results of PLA in a series of pure aliphatic alcohols where the tan (delta) is plotted against the temperature. Comparing the peak tan (delta) values, the T g of PLA is lower when immersed in pure alcohol with lower number of carbon atoms in the main chain, implying that smaller straight-chain alcoholic molecules can diffuse faster through the free volume region of PLA. This agrees with a general observation that an increase in the size of the compound in a homologous series (i.e., straight-chain alcohols with increasing number of carbons) results in a decrease in the diffusion coefficient through a polymer matrix [30]. Interactions of the alcohol molecules with PLA cause swelling and plasticization of the PLA matrix, leading to an increase in mobility of the PLA chain and thus a decrease in the T g . Trailing peaks are observed at around 64 °C from tan (delta) of alcohols C8–C10. While these peaks may be attributed to partially plasticized PLA films showing another T g value close to the T g of the dry film, they could be due to the sample and instrument limitations. At the temperature range where these peaks appeared, the film was softened and the elongation of the film was beyond the maximum allowed gap between the tension clamps, which was limited by the enclosed oven. Using thicker film samples might help to reduce the film elongation to within the restricted gap, but thick films could result in a nonuniform distribution of the solvent molecules within the PLA matrix. Additional tests are needed to validate these peaks and to determine a practical film thickness that best compromises between the film elongation and the solvent distribution issues. Furthermore, the high temperature tests were not conducted in alcohols C1–C6 since most of the solvents would be evaporated. The drop in the T g from the T g of dry PLA is plotted in Fig. 3 to show the trend as the number of carbon atoms and molecular volumes of the solvents changed. More discussion on the changes in the T g is provided in Section 3.4. The T g of PLA immersed in decan-1-ol is statistically higher than the T g of dry PLA. This could be due to the high viscosity of decan-1-ol as well as different thermal conductivity of the liquid from that of the air, i.e., the conditions when the film was heated in liquid were different from when the dry film was directly exposed to the heated air. Since alcohols larger than decan-1-ol are solid at room temperature, they were not tested. Additional experiments were conducted to compare properties of PLA before and after immersion. The detailed discussion is provided in Section S2. The results show varying values of post-immersion T g (i.e., the film samples were immersed in solvents, wiped dry, and measured for T g ). These findings emphasize that the post-immersion T g measurements may not capture the actual T g when PLA was exposed to the solvents. Furthermore, no detectable changes in chemical structures were observed from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses (data not shown)."
9,Effects of branching and concentration,"3.3 Effects of branching and concentration Some preliminary tests were performed to evaluate the factors affecting the T g reduction of PLA when immersed in branched-chain alcohols and alcohol aqueous solutions. The findings from these selected alcohols may not be extrapolated to other alcohols, but this section should provide some initial understanding of PLA properties in these alcohols as well as the factors affecting PLA's T g . 3.3.1 Effects of branching of propanol To compare the effects of the solvent chemical structures on T g , pure propan-1-ol (a straight-chain alcohol) and pure propan-2-ol (a branched-chain alcohol) were selected as solvents. These two alcohols are structural isomers with 3 carbon atoms and the same chemical formula. For typical alcohols with small number of carbons, a linear alcohol is more tightly packed than its branched isomer(s) [31], e.g., the molecular volumes of propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol are 75.1 and 76.9 mL/mol, respectively. However, Fig. 4 shows that the T g values of PLA when immersed in propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol were not different. The result suggests that the branched and shorter chain in propan-2-ol does not affect the solvation of PLA and the reduction of T g . Also, the difference in molecular volumes of propan-1-ol and propan-2-ol may not be large enough to result in different T g values. 3.3.2 Effects of solvent concentrations The results for PLA in-situ immersion in 100% water, 100% propan-2-ol, and 50% (v/v) propan-2-ol aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 5 . Compared to the T g of PLA film before immersion, the reduction in T g was largest in 100% propan-2-ol and the T g reduction became smaller as the concentration of propan-2-ol in water decreased. This finding may imply concentration dependency of the mass transfer of propan-2-ol in PLA. These T g reduction trends are in good agreement with the results previously reported by Iñiguez-Franco et al. [9] that T g of PLA dropped from 60 °C before immersion to 36 °C when immersed in 50% ethanol and that T g decreased when the concentration of ethanol in aqueous solutions increased. However, a linear relationship was not prominent as can be seen from the inset in Fig. 5. Further testing is needed to elucidate the T g behaviors of PLA film in different alcohols and aqueous solutions."
10,Modelling relationship between the solvent molecules and the changes in the T g of PLA,"3.4 Modelling relationship between the solvent molecules and the changes in the T g of PLA The T g values measured by DMA pre-immersion and in-situ immersion in alcohols, alcohol solutions, and water are summarized in Table 2 . Statistical comparisons of the T g values at dry conditions and in 100% straight-chain alcohols, marked with lowercase letters, show that all T g values are different. The T g values in 100% propan-1-ol and 100% propan-2-ol are not statistically different, as marked by the same uppercase letter. Finally, comparisons of the T g values at dry conditions and in 50% propan-2-ol, 100% propan-2-ol, and 100% water, marked with Greek letters, show that all T g values are statistically different. A relationship between the T g of a polymer and the plasticization effect of a low molecular weight compound can be evaluated based on the additivity of basic thermo-physical properties such as the Fox, Gordon-Taylor, and Kelley-Bueche equations. In this study, the Fox equation (Equation (1)) was used for prediction of T g reduction when PLA film is exposed to different solvents [32]. (1) 1 T g ∗ = W 1 T g 1 + W 2 T g 2 where T g * is the T g of the mixture, w1 is the weight fraction of component 1 (solvent), and w2, which in this case w2 = 1 -- w1, is the weight fraction of component 2 (polymer). T g1 and T g2 are T g of component 1 and 2, respectively. The T g values of alcohols used for the calculations are listed in Table 3 . The prediction of the T g of PLA in different solvents by the Fox equation is illustrated in Fig. 6 a. Comparing the experimental and the predicted T g values, only a small fraction of the solvent was absorbed into PLA. The Fox equation prediction shows that none of the weight fractions of solvents in PLA exceed 0.1, with methanol having the highest weight fraction in PLA (0.08) and water having the lowest value (0.02). Other alcohols C2–C6 have weight fractions in PLA in the range of 0.05–0.06. The T g values of alcohols with C > 6 are not available; therefore, the estimations for these alcohols were not included. Fig. 6b illustrates a trend in the predicted weight fraction of straight-chain alcohols in PLA where the T g was observed as a function of the solvent molecular volumes. It shows that the lowest molecular volume alcohol, i.e., methanol (C1), has the highest weight fraction in PLA. The highest drop in T g of PLA in methanol in Fig. 3 could be due to the highest amount of methanol sorbed into the film, contributing to the greatest plasticization. In the case of alcohols C2–C6, despite small variation in their predicted weight fractions in PLA, their effects on the T g reduction of PLA were different (as shown in Fig. 3). This observation suggests that the solvent content (i.e., the amount sorbed) in the film as well as the nature of the solvent (i.e., the chain length and molecular volume) affect the T g of PLA. However, more experiments are needed to measure the actual solvent content in the film sample and to confirm whether the prediction based on the Fox equation holds. The reduction in the T g of PLA when immersed in alcohols may be explained by the interactions of alcohols with PLA where the small molecular weight alcohols plasticize the PLA matrix resulting in PLA segmental chain movements, and thus a lower value of the measured T g . Lindvig et al. [36] proposed a Flory-Huggins (FH) model based on the Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) to assess the FH interaction parameters, x 12 , of a solvent (denoted by subscript 1) and a polymer (denoted by subscript 2). The model can be expressed as shown in Equation (2) where α* is an empirical factor that needs to be estimated from experimental data, V 1 is the molar volume of the solvent, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, δ d , δ p , and δ h are the HSP based on the contributions from the dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding, respectively. The HSP values at 25 °C for PLA and the solvents used for the immersion tests are listed in Table S1. The HSP values were recalculated using the HSPiP software [25] and equations S1–S3 to account for the temperature where the in-situ immersion T g (Table 2) was observed. The recalculated values are listed in Table S2. An arbitrary α* value of 0.6 was chosen for the current prediction as previously demonstrated as a good estimation [36]. (2) χ 12 = α * V 1 RT ( ( δ d 1 − δ d 2 ) 2 + 0.25 ( δ p 1 − δ p 2 ) 2 + 0.25 ( δ h 1 − δ h 2 ) 2 ) The predicted interaction parameters between PLA and different solvents were plotted against the experimental T g from the in-situ immersions as shown in Fig. 7 . The χ 12 values are higher for smaller alcohols and lower for bigger alcohols (i.e., longer chain, higher number of carbons). However, for alcohols larger than C8, the χ 12 values do not decrease as the in-situ T g values increase. A linear trend between χ 12 and the solvent weight fractions was observed for linear short-chain alcohols (C1 to C4), but not for larger and branched-chain alcohols. Since the parameters used for calculation were obtained from different sources based on different experimental setups, they may not directly correlate with the established trend. Further investigations should be focused on validating the empirical values used for the prediction and confirm whether the prediction is accurate. Additional tests with pentan-1-ol and heptan-1-ol to confirm this trend will be useful. Similar calculations based on the Fox equation for water and propan-2-ol in PLA (Fig. 8 ) show that water and propan-2-ol reach their corresponding experimental T g values at the solvent weight fractions of 0.02 and 0.06, respectively. The partition coefficients K of solute (denoted by subscript i) in liquid (denoted L) and PLA (denoted P) can be estimated from the interaction parameters (Equation (2)), as shown in Equation (3) (3) l n K i , L P = r L − 1 + x i , P − x i , L where r L is the ratio of the liquid volume to the solute volume. K of propan-2-ol between water and PLA is 88 at infinite dilution. The reciprocal of this value, 0.01, is K of propan-2-ol in PLA, which is much lower than the predicted weight fraction (~0.06) from the Fox equation. More experiments with different propan-2-ol concentrations and different alcohol aqueous solutions are needed to further elucidate the effect of solvent concentrations. The employment of the Fox equation in this study was to demonstrate how information obtained from the in-situ immersion experiments could be implemented for T g prediction of PLA in different solvents. Modeling of polymer-solvent systems such as emulsion polymers and water using the Fox equation has been demonstrated by other researchers [37]. Considering that the interpolation of the Fox equation was in a range where the solvent fraction was small (i.e., 0–0.1), the impact of interaction should be small, although further research is needed to better understand the aptness of Fox equation for the current PLA-alcohol systems."
11,Conclusion,"PLA's T g decreased when the polymer was immersed in pure alcohols and alcohol aqueous solutions. Since PLA has a low T g even at dry conditions, its properties such as thermo-mechanical and mass transfer are prone to be affected when exposed to elevated temperatures. Moreover, a reduction in its T g when exposed to solvents or chemicals in the storage or service environment will further impact its performance. For example, when PLA is used as a packaging material, a lowering in T g may lead to structural and barrier failures of the package, and thus affect the quality or in some cases, the safety, of the product. Therefore, it is critical to know the changes in properties of PLA when exposed to different environments to ensure successful commercial applications. The number of carbon atoms in pure alcohols directly affected the T g reduction (i.e., a larger alcohol induced a smaller T g reduction). However, the chemical structure of alcohol did not affect the reduction in T g for different isomers of propanol. Higher concentration of propan-2-ol in aqueous solutions induced larger T g reduction, implying concentration dependence of the T g reduction. The trend in T g reduction of PLA in pure alcohols corresponded well with the calculations based on the known values of HSP for low molecular weight alcohols C ≤ 8, but this relationship did not apply to higher molecular weight alcohols (C > 8) or propan-2-ol aqueous solutions. Further experiments are required to establish the underlying phenomena for the in-situ PLA immersion in alcohol solutions as well as to predict PLA's T g when immersed in other solutions."
