0,Introduction,"Searching for affordable and clean energy resources would be one of the important challenges presently faced on a worldwide scale. Such a challenge can be answered by green energy technologies. Increase in the world population, the growth of the polluting industries, and the use of fossil fuels have led to the release of toxic air pollutants and harmful contaminants into the environment, resulting in the climate change, global warming, and pollution-related diseases [1–3]. Azo dyes such as methyl orange (MO) are among the most important water pollutants due to their toxicity and discharge at large quantities from the textile, paper printing, residual dyestuffs, foodstuffs and pharmaceutical industries [4–6]. The challenge of the MO release and its by-products in the environment has led to pollution problems. Therefore, serious efforts should be directed to remove MO dye from the wastewater. However, opportunities arise to simultaneously remove such pollutants during water purification and generate useful fuels, such as hydrogen [7]. A good strategy to decompose organic wastes is to use them as electron donors that result in the formation of hydrogen with the simultaneous removal of the pollutants [8–10]. Previous studies showed that degradation of organic wastes using alcohols under anaerobic conditions could lead to hydrogen production [7,8]. Alcohols provide a high rate of hydrogen evolution because of their high susceptibility to oxidation reaction through adsorption on oxidic surfaces [7]. Because of the high potential of the reduction process, MO simply degrades on the cathode surface in an electrochemical cell through the electron-donating or electron-accepting properties [11,12]. A photo-electrochemical (PEC) cell based on the TiO2 thin film is an attractive environmental-friendly technology due to its ability for water purification, environmental remediation, and hydrogen production [13,14]. The wide band gap of rutile TiO2 (>3.0 eV) restricts its photocatalytic activity to the UV irradiation, which only accounts for about 5% of the absorption spectrum range [11,12]. Photocatalytic production of hydrogen by water splitting was studied by Fujishima and Honda [15]. They discovered a photo-electrochemical reaction leading to the formation of hydrogen gas through the electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen using a TiO2 electrode. Photocatalytic water splitting can be performed through the photo-chemical cell and PEC cell reactions [12]. In a photo-chemical cell, the photocatalysts are typically suspended particles to achieve the water-splitting whereas they are in the form of thin films deposited on a substrate as the photo-anode in a PEC cell. Two strategies have been presented to enhance the photoelectrocatalytic activity of TiO2-based PEC cells [16–19]. The first strategy, called photoinduced reduction reactions at the TiO2 surface, lies in changing the structure of pristine TiO2 via chemical doping, surface/sub-surface defects, change in surface morphology and particle size causing the band gap narrowing [11,20]. The second strategy, called photo-induced oxidation reactions at the TiO2 surface, is based on applying oxidizing agents such as different alcohols as electron donors in the PEC cells [11,21]. Tamaki et al. [21] studied the reaction dynamics of the trapped holes using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and found that in the presence of methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol, the transient absorption of the trapped holes decayed more rapidly, indicating that trapped holes can react with the mentioned alcohols. From the viewpoint of photo-induced reduction reactions at the electrode surface, the hydrogen evolution is characterized by the low value of apparent quantum efficiency. This is because of the high level of recombination rate between the photo-generated electrons and holes on the surface of the TiO2 electrode [9,11,20,22]. The low recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs is improved deposition of noble metal cocatalyst, including Pt [15,20], Au [18], Ag [17], Pd [23], Ru [24] or Rh [25] in nanoscale on the TiO2 thin film through precipitation [26,27], photochemical deposition [28,29], and sol-gel dip-coating method [30–32]. Moreover, these metals, used as co-catalyst, provide effective sites on the surface of the electrode for proton reduction [12,18,20,33]. Schrauzer and Guth [34] found that the photo-generated electrons in the TiO2 surface migrated to the Pt atom through reduction reactions, while photo-formed holes remained within the TiO2 bulk and shifted to its surface by oxidation reactions in the electrolysis of water into H2 and O2. Diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS) experiments indicated that both the trapped electrons and free bulk electrons move to the Pt metal site and thus to the TiO2 surface within a time interval of 1.4 and 2.3 ps, apparently in disagreement with the Schottky barrier model [35,36]. Alvaro et al. [37] studied the activity of gold nanoparticles (NPs) supported on the template-synthesized mesoporous structure of TiO2 to decontaminate chemical competition agent pinacoly methyl phosphonoﬂuoridate in the presence of visible light irradiation. Fang et al. [38] showed that the Pt-TiO2 samples could be excited by UV light irradiation. However, its cost limitations are still rather high for industrial manufacturing. Kitano et al. [39] showed that the higher Pt loading on the surface of TiO2 film enhanced the possibility of electron transport from TiO2 to Pt under visible-light. These results were in good agreement with those of electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements [20,40]. Anpo and Takeuchi [40] found that Ti3+ ions increased with irradiation time, and the loading of Au decreased the Ti3+ ions. A high value of hydrogen evolution efficiency is achieved for Au-deposited TiO2 with metal loadings of 0.3–1 wt. % [40]. Surface/sub-surface defects play a key role in the charge carrier separation, as the charges at the surface electrode or shallow traps become accessible for photelectroocatalytic reaction. The small number of defects in the catalyst acts as charge recombination centers, which result in a higher electron carrier density. In the TiO2 structure with a large number of defects, the amount of bulk defects is greater than that of surface defects, showing a negative role in the photoelectrocatalytic activity rate [20,31,41]. Ling et al. [20] showed that the surface disorder of hydrogenated TiO2 is responsible for the extended light absorption. They showed that the existence of abundant defect could act as electron donor sites, which influences the band-gap narrowing. They found that the up shift in the valence band top is assigned to the band bending, which is possibly associated with the charge discrepancy caused by the defect energy levels. Controlling the surface morphology and particle size can influence the photoelectrocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanostructures greatly. The assembled nanostructures give much more exposed surface region, well facilitating the adsorption and photoreaction of chemical reactants. Zheng et al. [42] proposed a hydrothermal process to prepare hierarchical TiO2 microspheres built from nanotubes. These microspheres exhibited a specific surface area as high as 300 m2/g and demonstrated good performance for MO degradation. Ye et al. [43] achieved flower-like hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures by a facile one-pot assembly route, showing good photocatalytic activities; however, the specific surface area of the nanostructured film is fairly low (∼70 m2/g). In earlier work, we found that the coral-like TiO2 thin films were ordered by NPs with cashew-like forms, which result in mesoporous structures with good light scattering property and specific surface area of 164 m2/g [31]. The goal of this paper is to present a facile route to photoelectrocatalytic methanol-assisted hydrogen production through the degradation of MO dye. The results were obtained by using the PEC cell based on the Pt-deposited TiO2 thin film composed of coral-like microstructures with sub-2 nm pores. Several strategies including an increase of effective surface area through the formation of mesoporous morphology, and the existence of hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface during the synthesis were applied to obtain better properties of the photocatalyst material. The MO degradation efficiency of the PEC cell was studied in the absence and presence of methanol under UV irradiation. The photoelectrocatalytic activities of the cell in the formation of hydrogen through water splitting under UV–vis, visible and sun-light were studied under anaerobic condition. The MO degradation mechanism and the important factors that affect the degradation assisted by the methanol and its intermediate by-products were studied with GCMS analysis and UV–vis spectroscopy. The efficiency and apparent quantum yield of present PEC cell were compared with that of TiO2-based photoelectrodes under visible-light-driven water splitting. The stability and photoelectrocatalytic activity of the cell are studied under different light irradiation conditions."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP, 99.9%), chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, 99.9%), nitric acid (HNO3, ≥ 90%), hydroﬂuoric acid (HF, 40%), methanol (99.9%, ACS reagent), acetonitrile (HPLC grade), and methyl orange (MO dye content 85%, ACS reagent) in analytical grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. by"
3,Synthesis of materials and thin film fabrication,"2.2 Synthesis of materials and thin film fabrication At first, TiO2 NPs were synthesized by dissolving of 1.5 ml of TTIP in 25 ml of absolute ethanol and the chemical reaction of TTIP with HF occurred based on a facile sol-gel route. The molar ratios of TTIP: HF and the experimental details are included in the previous works [31,32]. Then, the TiO2 thin films were fabricated through the immersion of the fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated (FTO) glasses in the prepared solution by a high-resolution dip-coater. The withdrawal velocity was 0.5 cm/min. The thin films with working geometric surface area of 1.0 cm2 were preheated at the temperature of 125 °C and cooled down to ambient temperature. The obtained film was annealed in a vacuum furnace at 500 °C. Finally, deposition of Pt NPs, which were synthesized by reaction of H2PtCl6 with the first solution (pH: 1.5), on TiO2 thin films led to the preparation of Pt-deposited TiO2 thin films with weight loadings of 0.1-0.7 wt.% Pt."
4,Characterization of samples,"2.3 Characterization of samples The phase structure of thin films was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Philips PW 1800). Raman spectroscopy analysis was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 400 F spectrometer by a laser beam of 514.5 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied using a Kratos Axis Ultra delay line detector spectrometer (monochromated Al–Kα X-ray source, hυ = 1486.6 eV). The binding energy was evaluated related to the C1s peak of the carbon at 284.6 eV. The VB XPS analysis was performed by PHI Quantera XPS Scanning microprobe spectrometer. The levels of binding energies are aligned by the Fermi level of the XPS analysis (4.10 eV vs. absolute vacuum value). The X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis was performed in situ on a CW Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with a Bruker TE102 using a microwave power of 1.0 mW. For EPR measurements, the TiO2 thin films were placed in a quartz tube under vacuum and evacuated at ambient temperature for one hour. After cooling down to 110 K, the tube was analyzed under UV irradiation for one hour. The morphology of the thin films was examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM, CamScan MV2300). The thickness of the TiO2 thin film was measured by proﬁlometry. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses were carried out on a JEM-2100 F TEM (JEOL, Japan) working at 200 kV. The surface area of the thin film was measured by an ASAP 2020 surface area analyzer. The size distribution of pores was determined through the Barrett − Joyner−Halenda (BJH) technique through the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm. The concentration of the MO in the solution was determined by measuring the absorbance values using UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Model Hitachi 3140). The MO degradation by-products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, 7890 A) coupled with a mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, 5975C). A HP-5MS capillary column (Dimensions: L 30.00 cm, ID 0.25 mm, DF 0.25 μm; J&W, Scientific Products, USA) was used. The column temperature was fixed at 50 °C for one minute, and increased to 220 °C at a heating rate of 4 °C/min. The detector and injector temperatures were fixed at 300 and 250 °C, respectively. The helium was applied at the flow rate of 1 ml/min."
5,Photo-electrochemical tests,"2.4 Photo-electrochemical tests The photo-electrochemical measurements were performed in an enclosed reactor made of Pyrex glass under sluggish stirring. The glass vessel was linked to a cooling water system to attain a steady-state heating condition. The PEC degradation of MO was performed in the cell under the following conditions: (1) A three-electrode system with a platinum plate (99.9%, 1.5 × 1.5 cm2) as the counter electrode (cathode), a saturated Ag/AgCl (SSE) as the reference electrode and the TiO2 thin film as the working electrode (anode); (2) A 400 W xenon lamp with optical filters (UV-REF filter: 330 nm < λ < 388 nm, ca. 83 m W/cm2; visible light (UV-CUT filter): 420 nm<λ < 760 nm, ca. 80 m W/cm2 and sunlight Air Mass (AM 1.5 G) irradiation ca. 100 m W/cm2) was used as light source; (3) Several solutions containing MO dye with fixed initial concentration of 0.1 mM and methanol (0.5–2.5 M) and Na2SO4 (0.01 M) were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) under stirring at room temperature. Water flow was circulated at 27 °C continuously in the outer layer of the reactor to attain a steady-state thermal condition. All reactions were performed at pH 6.7. The mixture of the reaction was evacuated with argon gas at a ﬂow rate of a 5 ml/min to ensure that the reaction is performed under anaerobic condition. The TiO2 electrode immersed in the electrolyte and irradiated light was absorbed by the film for 4 h. This process was supported by an external electric bias of 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). A TCD detector was applied for the determination of H2, O2, and N2 concentrations by an on-line GC–MS analyzer."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Thin film characterization,"3.1 Thin film characterization Fig. 1 a shows the XRD pattern of the TiO2 thin film prepared at 500 °C. Two strong and narrow peaks at 2θ of 27.446° and 36.085° indicate (110) and (101) planes, respectively. The other main diffraction peaks are displayed at 2θ of 39.187°, 41.225°, and 62.740°, attributed to the (200), (111), and (002) crystal planes of rutile phase. The sharp peaks with a narrow pattern indicate that the effect of the amorphous materials on the XRD pattern broadening is negligible. It is also noted that both lines (101) and (002) were significantly narrowed, relative to the line (110), which indicates a preferential orientation of the primary particles. Diffraction peaks show acceptable results with the standard data of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS, No. 21-1276), confirming the formation of a single phase [44]. Fig. 1b shows the Raman spectroscopy analysis of the rutile TiO2 film. Five distinct peaks at 140.2, 233.4, 445.6, 610 and 825.4 cm−1 represent the B1g, multi-photon process, band gap (E g), A1g and B2g Raman-active modes, respectively, related to the tetragonal phase [45,46]. The modes of B1g, E g and A1g are due to the symmetric bending vibration energy, stretching vibration and anti-symmetric bending vibration energy of O-Ti-O bonds, respectively. A broadening of the peak related to E g is because of the photon-conﬁnement effects caused by crystal defects [20]. Fig. 1c and d shows the XPS spectra of Ti 2p and O 1s, respectively. Fig. 1c shows the XPS spectra of the TiO2 thin films tested before and after one hour of UV irradiation at ambient temperature. In Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 1c), the two broad peaks at the binding energy of 458.7 and 464.3 eV (with a peak-to-peak separation of 5.6 eV) related to 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2, respectively, of Ti4+ oxidation state [47]. The absence of Ti3+ signals in Ti 2p spectrum indicates that the TiO2 structure is almost completely oxidized in the Ti4+ state before UV irradiation. The XPS spectrum of the TiO2 thin film after UV irradiation shows a small peak at 455.0 eV, which is attributed to the Ti3+ surface defect created by UV exposure. The Ti3+ surface defect level is positioned under the conduction band (CB) [48]. The Ti3+ surface defects have been recognized as being responsible for the formation of bridging hydroxyl (OH) groups on the TiO2 surface due to dissociative adsorption of water [49–51]. The XPS spectrum of O 1s shows a distinct peak located at 529.8 eV and two shoulder peaks at 531.9 and 533.8 eV (Fig. 1d). The first peak at binding energy of 529.8 eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen in the TiO2 structure through TiO bonding [45], while the second and third peaks at binding energy of 531.9 and 533.8 eV are ascribed to bridging OH-groups and water molecules, adsorbed on the surface of TiO2, respectively [49]. As the OH-groups are obtained from the adsorbed-water molecules on the oxygen vacancies, the noticeable OH-groups show the existence of oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 structure [50,51]. The water molecules chemically reacted with oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 (110) plane through dissociation and association of surface OH-groups. Previous studies have confirmed that the surface OH-groups on the (110) plane of TiO2 play a signiﬁcant role in the photocatalytic processes, in which surface hydroxylated centers act as trapping sites for both electrons and holes transferred to the surface [40,45,52]. The surface OH-groups provide possible methanol dissociation to methoxy photoactive species, thereby increasing the photocatalytic reaction of methanol on TiO2 (110) surface. Wang et al. found that the formation of OH-groups on the TiO2 surface can improve the adsorption capacity and the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue [53]. Fig. 2 shows the SEM image of TiO2 thin films. Low-magnification SEM image shows the formation of coral-like nanostructures formed through a coarsening of the primary NPs (Fig. 2a). It is not easy to find the size of coral-like structures due to the heterogeneous size distribution. Low-magnification SEM image shows the coral-like hierarchical structures with a size of 400–900 nm. High-magnification SEM image shows the primary NPs are attached on the surface of the lower layers to form coral-like structures (Fig. 2b). The formation of TiO2 coral-like structures or fractal-like agglomerates occurs based on three steps: nucleation, growth, and agglomeration. The fast nucleation step occurs continuously, and the primary NPs aggregate together to form large structures with cashew-like forms. At the growth step, full crystalline nanostructures are created by smoothing their surfaces with Ostwald ripening mechanism. This mechanism is based on the dissolution of fine particles, associated with the growth of large particles. In the agglomeration step, the NPs with a mean size of ∼30 nm tend to form coral-like microstructures with semi-spherical shapes and several hundred nanometers in size. The surface of the coral-like TiO2 structures appears as nucleation sites for the establishment of fine particles. Therefore, the tendency of NPs to link to each other due to agglomeration process would lead to the existence of the high amount of coral-like TiO2 structures. The mechanism of agglomeration originates from the short inter-particle forces including van der Waals and capillary forces [31,54]. Fig. 3 a shows the TEM image of NPs in the size range of 10–50 nm. The HR-TEM image showed square and hexagonal shapes of the truncated octahedron (Fig. 3b). The interfacial angle, related to the lateral surfaces and the top two parallel surfaces, is 81.2°, which corresponds adequately to the theoretical estimation of the angle between the {001} and {101} facets of rutile phase. The plane-view projection in HR-TEM image shows the TiO2 thin film aligned along the crystallographic orientation (Fig. 3c). Enlarged view along <001> crystal axis showed an ordered lattice structure in the interface zone without an obvious transitional atomic layer, which is composed of the aligned rutile phase grown along the [001] direction (Fig. 3d). Also, well-defined lattice fingers with an inter-planar distance of 0.356 nm and a high level of structural uniformity are observed for the TiO2 thin films, which well agrees with the {110} facet orientation of the rutile phase (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3e shows the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the HR-TEM image, which confirms the rutile TiO2 (110) single-crystal. The percentage of exposed {110} facet on the TiO2 nanosheets, as the most stable facet of rutile phase with the lowest formation energy, is estimated to be about 75%, by the HR-TEM results. Atomic ball-and-stick model and the unit cell model of rutile TiO2 structure are shown in Fig. 3f and g, respectively. Crystallography analysis based on the atomic model shows that the length of unit cell axes is a = 4.5840, b = 4.5839 and c = 2.9587 Å, while the angles of α, β, and γ are 90°, representing the tetragonal crystal system, where the basic building block consists of chains of a distorted TiO6 octahedron. Fig. 3h shows the structural analysis of HR-TEM image based on regions marked in Fig. 3c. At T1, which is selected from the edge of a primary NP with a size of 8 nm, there can be seen different types of crystal defects (as marked with a circle in Fig. 3h) and intrinsic bulk defects, including various distances between adjacent lattice planes. At T2, selected from the edge of two atomic layers formed by aggregates of two neighboring primary NPs, we can observe a well-defined crystal structure. However, we can also observe some disordered structures induced by defects, especially at the edge of primary NPs (Fig. 3h). At T3, selected from a single NP with a mean size of 8 nm, we observe well-defined lattice fringes and the distance determined between the adjacent lattice planes is equal to standard spacing, showing the high crystallinity of particles. These results are consistent with XPS results (Fig. 1c and d). The SAED pattern obtained from a single sheet polycrystalline TiO2 thin film is shown in Fig. 3i. The SAED ring pattern indicates multiple rings that are corresponding to the [110], [101], [111], [211], [301] and [321] planes of the crystalline TiO2 in rutile phase and does not show extra diffraction spots due to any impurities in the material. Fig. 4 a presents the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of the TiO2 thin film. A clear hysteresis circle at 0.26<P/P 0<0.37 corresponds to the filling of the micropores created between intra-agglomerated primary NPs. This result exhibits characteristics of the type I adsorption isotherm based on IUPAC classification [55], which indicates a mesoporous configuration of the material for P/P 0<<1. These pores lead to the formation of TiO2 structure typically formed by the type of aggregated voids between the primary NPs. Fig. 4b shows the pore size distribution of the TiO2 structures obtained by N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and DFT/Monte Carlo fitting curve. Accordingly, the specific surface area, minimum pore size and mean pore size of TiO2 structures were estimated to be 173 m2/g, 1.6 nm and 9.3 nm, respectively. Fig. 5 a shows the UV–vis diffuse reﬂectance spectrum of the Pt-deposited TiO2 thin film. As shown, a wide absorption peak in the visible light region is seen to disappear at around 471 nm (Fig. 5a, inset). A linear extrapolation in the transition region by Tauc's plot (the incident photon energy (α E photon)2 versus the energy level of the absorbed light) gives the band gap of the TiO2 with the presence of Pt NPs (Fig. 5b). The band gap energy is determined to be 2.63 eV, which is appropriate for the photodegradation of organic wastes. Small differences in the band gap of TiO2 are ascribed to crystalline size [20,56], shape and morphology of crystals [31,57], the transition metal doping [15,18,23,58], impurity content [59], and stoichiometry of Ti atoms [60,61]. Fig. 5c presents the XPS valence band (VB) spectrum of the Pt-deposited TiO2 thin film. As shown, the VB level extends the maximum VB value of reference rutile TiO2, which might further increase the optical absorption intensity of the material. Thus, a maximum O2p VB value at 2.52 eV, which shows an upward shift (∼0.37 eV) compared with the rutile phase (2.89 eV) confirms the TiO2 with preferential {110} facets [62]. The unchanged Ti3d conducting band value of 0.11 eV for rutile TiO2 is in agreement with the reference material structure [62]. The schematic diagram of the density of states (DOS) applied for the pure rutile TiO2 the TiO2 with the presence of Pt NPs is shown in Fig. 5d. Based on the XPS VB analysis, the determined band gap of the Pt-deposited TiO2 thin film is 2.63 eV, which is ∼0.37 eV smaller than that of the reference rutile TiO2 (3.00 eV) [63]. The red-shift of absorption edge of Pt-deposited TiO2 thin film compared with pure rutile TiO2 is related to the formation of Helmholtz potential on the TiO2 surface with the presence of Pt NPs as noble metal [11]. The surface state between Pt NPs and the TiO2 surface makes possible the reduction of TiO2 effective band gap energy from 3.00 to 2.63 eV. The CB of TiO2 is dominantly composed of Ti4+ (3d) whereas the O2− (2p) levels constitute the VB value. The presence of electron rich Pt (5d 9 6s 1) provides the active sites for the low energy transitions from the CB of TiO2 to CB of the Pt at the surface. The VB level is considerably more positive than the oxidation potential of O2/water, while the CB level is slightly more negative than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (Fig. 5d)."
8,Determination of the MO photodegradation by-products,"3.2 Determination of the MO photodegradation by-products 3.2.1 UV–vis analyses The typical UV–vis absorption spectra of the MO (0.1 mM) degradation are analyzed by determining the concentration of the MO and its by-products in the PEC cell under anaerobic condition (MO/Ar). Fig. 6 a shows the results of the concentration of MO versus the UV irradiation time (concentration-time curve). Experiments were performed in the absence and presence of methanol to study the role of this material in the degradation of MO and the formation of new chemical species. At the same irradiation times, the highest MO degradation and reasonably reproducible results were achieved at high concentrations of methanol (i. e. 2.0 and 2.5 M), while there is a significant loss in the degradation process in the absence of methanol. The color of the solution gradually changes from orange to colorless, which indicates that the MO is degraded under UV light irradiation (Fig. 6a, inset). In the presence of methanol 2.0 M, the full discolorization is attained at 28 min of irradiation, which is because of the adsorption of additional dye molecules on the surface of the TiO2. The required irradiation time for full discolorization of MO without methanol assistance was reported to be 120 min in the literature [64,65]. This indicates that the required time for photodegradation of MO assisted with methanol 2.0 M is less than one-fourth in which the MO degradation exists without methanol assistance. The possible reasons for the less required time in degradation of MO with methanol assistance are (1) the increase in oxidation process of methanol in the presence of MO, which is preferred over NN bond hydrogenation and proton reduction [66], and (2) methanol adsorption occurs predominately through a dissociative mechanism on the rutile surface, resulting in the formation of hydroxyl radicals and surface alkoxide groups. The existence of these functional groups led to the increase of charge transfer from the alkoxide group to the rutile surface that, in turn, led to an increase of the competitive adsorption reactions on the TiO2 surface [7,58]. Fig. 6b shows the UV–vis spectra of photodegradation of MO (0.1 mM) at different irradiation times in the presence of methanol (2.0 M) in the PEC cell. The UV–vis spectra are characterized by two distinct peaks: one peak in the visible region with the maximum absorbance (λmax) located at 457 nm and another peak in the UV region with λmax of 270 nm, which are represented by conjugated structure formed by the azo groups (–N = N–) double bond and aromatic rings in the MO, respectively. The intensity of the MO peaks gradually decreased as the irradiation time increased, and the peak at the λmax shows a slight bathochromic shift by as much as 9 nm from 456 to 465 nm. It indicated that the hydroxyl radicals (HO•) attacked the azo bonds and benzene rings of MO molecule in the presence of methanol on the surface of photo-electrochemical cell and dye break down into new simple products. The C/C 0 variation of MO versus the irradiation time in the presence of methanol is shown in Fig. 6b (inset). The MO concentration decreased with irradiation time according to an exponential decay function. In the presence of methanol, the azo bond was almost destroyed at 28 min, which corresponded to the concentration-time curve (Fig. 6a). At t = 28 min, the degradation efficiency of MO in the presence of methanol 2.0 M reached 99.6%, while in the absence of methanol it reached ∼61.3%. 3.2.2 GC–MS analysis Fig. 7 shows typical mass spectrum intensity changes of MO degradation products obtained from PEC cell in the presence of methanol (2.0 M) and in anaerobic condition (MO + MeOH/Ar) after being degraded at retention times of 3.9 min (g), 6.8 min (h), 9.7 min (i), 12.0 min (j), 16.9 min (k), and 17.8 min (l). As can be seen, at t = 0 min (Fig.7a), before UV irradiation there is a strong peak at m/z 290 ascribed to the loss of one methyl group from MO appearing at t R = 3.9 min, while there are two peaks at m/z 276 and 191 also ascribed to the loss of two methyl groups from MO and 4,6-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate, respectively. Also, a peak at m/z 32 corresponds to methanol. After 4 min of UV irradiation with 6.8 min retention time (Fig.7b), in addition to the strong peak of MO, there can be seen two new weak peaks at m/z 240 and 156, which correspond to [M−H-SO2]− and phenyl sulfonic radical, respectively. The sample, after 8 min of degradation with a retention time of 9.7 min, shows a high-intensity peak at m/z 191 corresponding to 4,6-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate and two weak peaks at m/z 136 and 121 (Fig. 7c). These peaks correspond to the formation of N,Nʹ-dimethyl-p-phenylene-diamine (m/z peak 136) and N,N-dimethyl-phenylamine (m/z peak 121) as the intermediate products of the MO degradation. After 12 min of retention time (Fig. 7d) MO molecule and its degradation products exhibit a strong peak at m/z 136 corresponding to N,Nʹ-dimethyl-p-phenylene-diamine and a medium intensity peak at m/z 172 corresponding to the formation of 4-amino sulfonic acid. As observed in Fig. 7d, the intensity of m/z 304 is highly decreased and it can be concluded that most MO is degraded. After 16.1 min of retention time (Fig. 7e), a strong peak at m/z 151 corresponding to 4-hydrazinyl-N, N-dimethyl benzene amine. In the last spectrum at 17.8 min of retention time (Fig. 7f), a strong peak at m/z 72 corresponding to acrylic acid is observed. Additionally, weak peaks at 32, 59 and 44 correspond to hydrazine, acetic acid, and CO2, respectively."
9,Proposed mechanism of MO degradation and water splitting with methanol,"3.3 Proposed mechanism of MO degradation and water splitting with methanol Fig. 8 shows the proposed mechanism of the MO degradation and water splitting in anaerobic condition (MO/Ar) using TiO2 electrode, which is composed of four steps. At the first step (photoexcitation), the photoelectrocatalytic reaction occurs when a photoelectron is promoted from the filled O2p VB to the empty Ti3d CB of TiO2 under the UV irradiation. The electron excitation from the VB level produces a valence band hole (h+ (VB)). The electron-hole pair (e−/h+) is generated as follows: (1) Ti O 2 + h ν → Ti O 2 ( e ¯ ( CB ) + h ( VB ) + ) At the second step (water ionization), the photo-generated (h+ (VB)) can react with the water surface molecules to produce radical species of OH as in the following reaction: (2) H 2 O ( ads ) + h ( VB ) + → O • H ( ads ) + H ( ads ) + The •OH free radicals act as an oxidizing agent, where they easily attach a dye molecule because of their high reactivity. At the third step (oxygen ionosorption), the electron in the conducting band ( e ¯ ( CB ) ) is captured by oxygen create superoxide anion radical ( O 2 − • ). (3) O 2 + e ¯ ( CB ) → O 2 ( ads ) − • The superoxide anion radicals (O2 −) are easily adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 with a high electron density, where these reactants attack the surface of the electrode. At the final step, the O2 − species become protonated forming hydroperoxyl radical (HO2 ). The H2O2 molecule dissociates into hydroxyl radicals ( OH). (4) O 2 ( ads ) • − + H + ⇔ O O ( ads ) • (5) 2 HO O ( ads ) • → H 2 O 2 ( ads ) + O 2 (6) H 2 O 2 ( ads ) → 2 O • H ( ads ) (7) MO + • OH → MO ( H O • ) → • OH + MO Intermediates → C O 2 + H 2 O The presence of methanol in aiding the formation of hydrogen molecules can be proposed by two reactions in anaerobic condition (MeOH/Ar). The first hypothesis is that the methanol helps to increase the proton-reduction efficiency over the Pt-deposited TiO2 electrode by reacting with photo-generated holes, producing four protons and CO (Reaction 8) [7,67]. Then, the produced protons react on the surface of TiO2 form of hydrogen molecules. (8) C H 3 OH ( 1 ) +4 h + ⟶ Pt/Ti O 2 4 H + +CO ( g ) The second hypothesis is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and formaldehyde to formic acid, reacting on the surface of TiO2 electrode, again followed by the reduction of protons into hydrogen over the Pt counter electrode (Fig. 8). The overall process is shown by Reaction (9) [66,70]: (9) C H 3 OH ( 1 ) ⟶ Pt/Ti O 2 H 2 CO ( 1 ) + H 2 ( g ) Then, formaldehyde conversion to formic acid (Reaction 10), and formic acid to CO2 (Reaction 11) are possible mechanisms to increase the rate of hydrogen production [7,69]. (10) H 2 CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( 1 ) ⟶ λ = 375 nm Pt/Ti O 2 HC O 2 H ( 1 ) + H 2 ( g ) (11) H 2 COH ( g ) ⟶ λ = 375 nm Pt/Ti O 2 C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) The presence of methanol promotes the MO degradation, which means Eqs. (2) and (8) and also Eqs. (3) and (9) are competitive reactions. Therefore, degradation of MO and water splitting with methanol should be discussed together to determine the probable mechanism. From the catalytic data obtained by on-line GC analysis as shown in the Supplementary Material (Figure S1), we can discriminate which of the products of methanol conversion is relevant. According to GC-chromatogram (Figure S.1a), the peaks at m/z 30 and m/z 46 after 24 min photodegradation of MO solution in the presence of methanol correspond to the formation of formaldehyde or its resonance hybrid and formic acid, respectively (Supplementary Material, Reaction S.1). After 28 min UV irradiation, the most active species such as formaldehyde and formic acid are broken down into small molecules, which are characterized by the presence of small peaks on the chromatogram (Figure S.1b). This result suggested that the second hypothesis (Reaction 9) is more probable than the first one (Reaction 8), which is in agreement with the literature [71]."
10,Photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution using water splitting,"3.4 Photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution using water splitting The photoelecteocatalytic activity of PEC cell in the presence of methanol (2.0 M) is measured by the amount of hydrogen production through the water splitting under various irradiation times as shown in Fig. 9 . As can be seen (Fig. 9a), there is not any hydrogen evolution before irradiation process. Under UV light (330 nm<λ < 388 nm), the maximum hydrogen evolution rate was 11.4 mmol/h after 4 h, while under visible light (420 nm<λ < 760 nm) and sunlight irradiation, the hydrogen evolution rate was 418 and 812 μmol/h, respectively. This indicated that the maximum hydrogen evolution rate achieved by UV-light irradiation is higher than that of other PEC cells based on TiO2 thin film [9,11,22]. The probable reason for the high activity in the UV region is that the high excitation of TiO2 generates electron-hole pairs and a blue shift in the absorption spectrum. Based on the literature, the weight percentage of platinum obviously affects the visible-light absorption of TiO2 [7,12,20]. The rate of hydrogen evolution at the different weight percent of Pt-deposited onto TiO2 thin film under visible-light irradiation is shown in Fig. 9b. The Pt-free electrode shows the low activity for water splitting under the visible-light irradiation, while the rate of hydrogen evolution increases with an increase in weight percentage of Pt, at a maximum value of 0.5 wt. %, and then gradually decreases. An increase in the hydrogen evolution rate occurs for two main reasons: (1) the increase in the electron-hole separation efficiency, where the Fermi level of Pt atom is lower than that of TiO2, and the photo-excited electrons can be transferred from TiO2 surface to Pt NPs, which reduces the recombination probability of electron-hole pairs [11,20,67,68]. (2) The presence of methanol and small produced molecules such as formic acid and formaldehyde provided a competitive adsorption reaction on the TiO2 surface [7,69]. The stability and a photoelectrocatalytic activity of the cell are studied after 3 runs (Fig. 9c). As seen, after multiple testing there is no visible change in the hydrogen evolution rate, which indicates the high stability of the prepared film under the visible light. There is no obvious activity loss of the prepared cell even after the conventional storage as long as 3 months (Fig. 9d). To make more comparison in the photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution under different irradiations, the apparent quantum yield (QY) is determined by applying the suitable light intensity from the sunlight source into the photo-electrochemical cell. Based on the literature, the hydrogen evolution is associated with the low value of apparent quantum efficiency [9,11,22]. The reason is a high recombination rate of electron-hole pairs on the Ti3+ sites in the structure of coral-like rutile TiO2 thin film that discussed by EPR analysis (Supplementary Material, Figure S2). The high light intensity leads to the lower QY and also causes the cell to heat up, which is undesirable. The QY was calculated by the following equation: (12) QY = N e f f ( 2 × N H 2 ) N T o t a l × 100 % where N eff is the number of effective electrons transferred (equal to 2×number of evolved hydrogen molecules in 1 h) under the monochromatic light using a calibrated photodiode, and N Total is the total number of incident photons (in 1 h). The highest QY of 3.70% is obtained for the cell in the presence of methanol (2.0 M) and 0.5 wt.% Pt under monochromatic visible light at λ = 420 nm, followed by 0.32% of Pt-free electrode. Based on the literature review, this is the highest QY value reported for stable metal oxide semiconductor cells under similar conditions [72,73]. Therefore, the notable activity and stability of Pt/TiO2 thin film make a promising photo-electrochemical cell for hydrogen production through water splitting under visible-light irradiation. This shows the TiO2 thin film has a more photoelectrocatalytic activity than the reported ones in the literature [65,73]."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, we reported a facile and scalable sol-gel dip-coating route to fabricate Pt-deposited TiO2 thin film composed of coral-like structures with sub-2 nm pores. In the presence of methanol, the PEC cell reached a maximum hydrogen evolution rate of 11.4 mmol/h after 4 h under UV light irradiation, followed by 812 and 418 μmol/h under simulated sunlight irradiation (100 m/W cm2) and irradiation in the visible light region, respectively. Spectroscopic characterization results verified the existence of a slightly disordered structure induced by surface defects, especially at the edge of primary NPs, which influences the band-gap narrowing. The coral shape of the TiO2 structures with sub-2 nm pores increases the percentage of surface defects to overcome the negative effects of bulk defects, which provide easier charge carriers under visible-light irradiation. Therefore, this material exhibits a promising photelectroocatalytic activity for hydrogen production through water splitting or degradation of azo dye MO. The UV–vis analysis results showed that the photo-electrochemical cell exhibited the best activity with 99.6% MO degradation in the presence of methanol (2.0 M). The MO degradation is enhanced due to the formation of free hydroxyl radicals that attack the azo bonds of MO and break down the dye into smaller reaction products on the surface of the electrode. The required irradiation time for full discoloration of MO using the employed cell is less than 30 min, much shorter than the corresponding value when TiO2 P25 is used. GCMS spectroscopic studies confirmed that the MO/methanol solution and its intermediate by-products simply break down into new smaller molecules, including formic acid and formaldehyde. The presence of methanol and its reaction with small molecules formed by MO degradation provides a competitive adsorption reaction on the surface of TiO2 electrode that leads to the reduction of protons to hydrogen. Same as hydrogen formation, MO dis-colorization is stimulated by the presence of methanol under anaerobic condition (MO + MeOH/Ar), without the formation of new chemicals compounds, confirming the role of methanol in the photoelectrocatalytic reactions. The photonic efficiency of the prepared cell was increased through deposition of platinum 5 wt.% on the TiO2 nanopores. It is commonly used in the construction of photoelectrocatalytic methanol-assisted evolution of hydrogen using the degradation of azo dyes in the visible-light irradiation."
