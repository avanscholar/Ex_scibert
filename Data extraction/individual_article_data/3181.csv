0,Introduction,"In order to solve the environmental crisis brought about by traditional chemical industry and cut down or phase out the adverse raw materials use and by-products production, it is necessary to develop new one-pot tandem processes with adjustable chemoselective characteristics to realize atomic economy and improve the utilization of resources. As essential intermediates and final products, aromatic amines, alicyclic amines as well as N-alkyl amines are universally used to synthesize dyes, pharmaceuticals and other chemical products [1–4]. The traditional synthesis of N-alkyl amines from aromatic nitro compounds generally consists of two steps: the first step is hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds to aromatic amines or alicyclic amines; the second step is the N-alkyl reaction of amines with alkylating agents to form N-alkyl amines [5,6]. However, the traditional alkylating agents in N-alkylation of amines were alkyl halides, which are toxic and the by-products produced are harmful to the environment [7–10]. Considering alcohols are cheaper, easier to obtain and less harmful to the environment in chemical production, developing and utilizing alcohols as alkylating agents to produce N-alkylated amines under mild reaction conditions is an attractive research field in green chemistry [11–14]. Many homogeneous transition metal catalysts, with the assistance of ligands and/or bases, have been explored in selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation reaction [15–18]. However, these catalytic systems were more or less difficult to recycle. Heterogeneous one-pot multi-directional catalytic systems are fascinating because of their potential in green synthetic applications. Seung Geun Oh et al. [19] reported temperature controlled one-pot catalytic NO2 reduction, ring hydrogenation, and N-alkylation from aromatic nitro compounds to generate alicyclic amines catalyzed by Ru/C-NaNO2 with harsh conditions (170 °C and 8.3 MPa H2 pressure). Therefore, it is obviously rather challenging to develop novel heterogeneous catalysts to construct efficient one-pot reactions for aromatic nitro compounds multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation with different alcohols to prepare more value-added N-alkylated amines under mild conditions. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a series of two-dimensional layered compound, which is constituted by positively charged brucite-like layer and interlayer anions and water molecules [20–24]. LDH as catalytic materials have been studied widely because of its many excellent properties, such as adjustable inherent composition, high thermal stability and good metal dispersion etc [25–29]. Herein, Ru/LDH catalyst with characteristics of layered mesoporous structure (SEM and BET), well dispersed small Ru NPs (2.5 nm, XRD and TEM) and stabilization effect of LDH to Ru NPs (XPS) has been successfully prepared. With this interesting new catalytic material, we discovered a highly efficient and easy to operate one-pot tandem method by which we could directly produce a broad range of multi-directional chemoselective hydrogenated amines or N-alkyl aliphatic amines using aromatic nitro compounds as the starting material under mild conditions. Multi-directional excellent chemoselectivity to aromatic amines, alicyclic amines as well as N-alkyl aliphatic amines could be achieved with attractive catalytic activity and recyclability in different solvent, including water, ethanol and isopropanol, etc., over Ru/LDH catalytic system. It is worth mentioning that the substrate range of the one-pot tandem hydrogenation N-alkylation catalytic system could be extended to various aliphatic alcohols. Additionally, this catalytic system also exhibited attractive activity and multi-directional chemoselectivity in the hydrogenation of quinoline and its derivatives with solvents of different polarity. Chemoselectivity to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives could reach as high as 95.6 %."

9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of Ru catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of Ru catalysts As revealed in Fig. 1 , the XRD patterns of the LDH samples showed the typical diffraction lines for LDH structure with interlayer carbonate. The characteristic peaks of the (003), (006), (009), (015), (018), (110) and (113) lattice planes were at 2θ = 11.7°, 23.5°, 35.0°, 39.5°, 47.1°, 60.8° and 62.2°, respectively (JCPDS card 22-0700), demonstrating that a kind of hydroxycarbonate of Mg and Al was successfully synthesized [30]. In addition, the two diffraction peaks for (110) and (113) planes demonstrated that these samples had typical highly crystalline LDH structure. When the Mg/Al molar ratio was 2, the peak intensity of (003) plane was the highest and the symmetry of the peak was the best, which indicated that LDH-2 had highest crystallinity (Fig. 1a). Although LDH-4 and LDH-6 had typical LDH characteristic peaks, the intensity of the (003) diffraction peak was lowered and the symmetry decreased. In addition, the intensity of (006) diffraction peak was also significantly weakened with a pronounced peak broadening, while a new peak appeared at 2θ = 20.0°. The diffraction peak for the (003) plane became broader with the increase of Mg/Al molar ratio also supported the LDH crystallinity decrease (Fig. 1a-1c). The diffraction peaks did not change significantly with the increase of Ru loading, indicating that Ru NPs were uniformly dispersed on LDH with no significant effect on the LDH crystal structure (Fig. 1a, 1d-1f) [31]. As shown in Fig. S1, the LDH characteristic peaks became weak and wide after calcination, inferred the LDH structure change and the crystallinity decrease. 1 wt%Ru/LDH-LTC had additional peaks at 2θ = 28.3° and 54.5° in Fig.S1(c), which should be related to the (110) and (211) planes of RuO2 (JCPDS card 06-0663). This might be attributed to the partial decomposition of RuCl3 to produce RuO2 during calcination. Fig. 2 showed SEM images of Mg-Al LDH. The layered structure LDH-2 sample in Fig. 2 (a) was formed with ultrathin platelets aggregation. The Ru/LDH maintained the layered structure after metal loading (Fig. 2 (b)), however, the platelets stacked in some degree. As shown in Fig. 2 (c, d), Ru/LDH-CTL and Ru/LDH-LTC aggregated into flower-like structure. The metal loading and calcination sequence did not significantly affect the morphology of the catalyst. The TEM characterization showed the morphology and particle size distribution of Ru NPs in 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 (Fig. 3 (a)). Ru NPs were highly dispersed on the surface of LDH with the average sizes of 2.5 nm (Fig. 3(b)). The HRTEM image of 5 wt%Ru/LDH in Fig. 3(c, d) showed that the measured lattice spacing of Ru was 0.21 nm, which was consistent with the reflection of the (101) lattice planes of metal Ru [32]. The FT-IR spectrum of catalytic materials was used to identify the structural characteristics such as interlayer anions, cations in brucite-like layers as well as Ru NPs on LDH. The typical LDH strong absorption band at 3453 cm−1 was observed in Fig. S2, which should be attributed to the stretching band of the metal hydroxyl groups and water molecules from both the interlayers and brucite-like layers [33]. The weak band centered at 1635 cm−1 should be ascribed to the bending mode of water molecules [34]. The sharp peak at 1369 cm−1 could be related to the CO3 2− symmetric stretching mode, and a weak one at 783 cm−1 could be attributed to out-of-plane deformation of interlayer CO3 2−. The remaining bands between 688 cm−1 and 450 cm−1 should be assigned to metalO and metalOH vibrations in the LDH lattice [35]. With the increase of Mg/Al molar ratio and the loading of Ru NPs, the characteristic peak of CO3 2− at 1369 cm−1 became weaker significantly, illustrated that the increase of Mg2+ and the loading of Ru NPs to the LDH surface or interlayer reduced the CO3 2− symmetric stretching [36]. The TG analysis of LDH-2 and 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 was listed in Fig. S3. Two obvious weight loss stages were observed during the TG analysis. The first weight loss at around 200 °C was attributed to the loss of physically absorbed and interlayer water. The mass loss caused by thermal decomposition at this stage was about 11.0 % of the total LDH. The second weight loss in the temperature range from 260 °C to 530 °C could be attributed to the decomposition of CO3 2− into carbon dioxide and the removal of water molecules from hydroxyl groups in brucite-like layers, resulted in the collapse of the LDH structure and eventually formed MgAl mixed oxides [21]. The weight loss in this progress was around 24.0 %. The overall weight loss of LDH-2 was about 35.0 % in the temperature range from 25 °C to 530 °C, which was equivalent to the total weight loss of water and CO3 2−. The weight loss of 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 was less than that of LDH-2 because Ru NPs remained stable during this TG analysis process. Fig. S4(a) showed the specific surface areas of LDH-2 and 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2, which were determined by the BET method. The N2-adsorption and desorption curves of both LDH-2 and 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 conformed to type IV adsorption curve with H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the sample had mesoporous structure. The maximum adsorption capacity (or plateau) did not appear on the adsorption curves at relative higher pressures, and the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of relative pressures, suggested that the mesoporous structure should be owing to the slit pore structure formed by the agglomeration of LDH platelet. The BET surface areas of LDH-2 and 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 were 78 and 75 m²/g, respectively. Fig. S4(b) exhibited that the pore size distribution of 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 decreased slightly in comparison with LDH-2, indicating Ru NPs were supported on the LDH-2. The average pore was 12.3 nm and 10.7 nm, respectively, with the BJH (Barrett-Joiner-Halenda) method. The valence state of 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 catalyst was characterized by XPS. The XPS full scan showed that the catalyst contains Ru, Mg, Al, C and O elements (Fig. 4 a). The Ru 3d XPS spectrum was displayed in Fig. 4b. The peak at 284.66 eV should be attributed to C 1s; the peaks at 281.49 eV and 285.43 eV were assigned to Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2; while the peaks at 282.47 eV and 286.29 eV should be reasonably ascribed to LDH metal hydroxyl groups stabilization effect to Ru NPs. Therefore, Ru in the 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 mainly existed in the metallic Ru(0) and Ruδ+ states. The Mg 1 s peaked at 1304 eV was assigned to Mg2+ in Fig. 4c. The Al 2p peaked at 74.4 eV was assigned to Al3+ in Fig. 4d [37]."
11,Catalytic one-pot multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation,"3.2 Catalytic one-pot multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation Table 1 presented the catalytic data in one-pot multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation reaction of nitrobenzene (NB) with isopropanol over various Ru catalysts. The multi-selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation of NB with isopropanol involve the following directions: 1) reduction of nitro group to amino group; 2) hydrogenation of aromatic ring to alicyclic; 3) N-alkylation of amine with alcohol. In comparison with traditional MgO and Al2O3 support, Ru NPs on LDH notably had the highest catalytic activity and chemoselectivity to N-alkylation product IP−CHA (Table 1, entries 1–3). This might be owing to the fact that LDH ultrathin platelets were beneficial to the dispersion of Ru NPs, and the metalO bond and metalOH bonds in LDH were beneficial to the Ru NPs stability and the catalytic performance improvement. Considering the influence of calcination on the LDH surface alkalinity, and the influence of metal loading and calcination sequence on the valence and catalytic properties of metal NPs [38,39], we also investigated these factors. However, the catalytic chemoselective hydrogenation and N-alkylation activity and chemoselectivity were significantly reduced due to the agglomeration of LDH, the decomposition of the brucite-like layer hydroxyl groups along with the interlayer CO3 2− and the RuO2 formation after calcination (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). The Mg/Al molar ratio affects not only the crystal structure of LDH, but also the surface alkalinity. Therefore, the influence of LDH Mg/Al molar ratio on catalytic performance was examined. The catalytic N-alkylation selectivity decreased with the Mg/Al molar ratio increase (Table 1, entries 1, 6 and 7). In combination with XRD characterization in Fig. 1, the crystallinity of the LDH carrier obviously affected the catalytic performance. The amount of metal loading is the key factor to influence the metal dispersion, the number of surface active sites as well as the catalytic performance of the catalyst. Obviously, as the metal loading increase, the catalytic N-alkylation selectivity increased (Table 1, entries 1, 8 and 9), confirming that the dispersibility of the Ru NPs on the LDH had important effect on the catalytic performance. When the metal loading increased to 5 %, the chemoselectivity to N-alkylation of amine could reach as high as 98.0 % with just 0.5 MPa H2 (Table 1, entry 9). In the absence of 4 Å MS, Ru/LDH catalyst could also catalyze N-alkylation of NB with just 44.0 % IP−CHA chemoselectivity, and a large number of CHA, DCHA and IPAN were detected (Table 1, entry 10). This identified the synergy effect between 4 Å MS and Ru/LDH to promote the improvement of catalytic IP−CHA selectivity. For comparison, we also tested the catalytic performance of commercial available catalyst 5 wt%Ru/C. Under the same catalytic conditions, 5 wt%Ru/C catalyst just achieved poor chemoselectivity in the N-alkylation of NB with isopropanol (Table 1, entry 11). Heterogeneous one-pot multi-directional catalytic systems are charming because they can simplify experimental procedures, realize atomic economy and save time and energy. After repeated attempts, we discovered a simple and convenient method to control multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation by tuning reaction conditions. Except the 98.0 % chemoselectivity to N-alkylation amine in isopropanol (Table 1, entry 9); Hydrogenation of NB to AN could be achieved quantitatively in water at 50 °C (Table 1, entry 12); CHA, which is NB fully hydrogenated product, could also be achieved with chemoselectivity up to 92.6 % in ethanol at 100 °C (Table 1, entry 13). In short, above results indicated that 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 perfectly achieved one-pot multi-directional highly chemoselective hydrogenation and N-alkylation of NB under mild conditions. In order to clarify whether the hydrogenation and N-alkylation chemoselectivity switch was caused by the kinetic control or by the action of the solvent to the catalyst, we investigated the time-dependent catalytic performance in isopropanol, ethanol as well as water over 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 catalyst. Fig. 5 a showed the time-dependent catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation of NB in isopropanol. The reduction of the nitro group reached 100 % conversion with 80.7 % chemoselectivity to AN in 2 h. CHA, DCHA and IPAN were also detected in the product in 2 h. When the reaction time reached 4 h, the chemoselectivity to CHA increased to 39.3 % and the chemoselectivity to IP−CHA reached 53.0 % accompany with the selectivity to AN decreased to less than 1.0 %. Further extending the reaction time, continuous increase in the concentration of IP−CHA was achieved accompanied with the decrease in chemselectivity to other products, and chemoselectivity to IP−CHA could be increased to as high as 98.0 % in 10 h. In ethanol (Fig. 5b), the nitro group reached 94.0 % conversion with 68.0 % chemoselectivity to AN and 31.8 % chemoselectivity to CHA in 2 h. The hydrogenation activity of NB in ethanol was obviously higher than that in isopropanol; however, CHA did not continually convert to N-alkylamine with the increase of time. Additionally, the hydrogenation behavior in water was similar to the catalytic performance in ethanol (Fig. 6 ). Therefore, it should be concluded that the selectivity switch of NB hydrogenation and N-alkylation was controlled by both the kinetic control and the action of the solvent to the catalyst. The recycling experiment of 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 on hydrogenation and N-alkylation of NB in isopropanol was investigated in Fig. 7 . It was apparent that 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 was very stable and could be reused at least 5 times with maintained high activity and high IP−CHA chemoselectivity. As presented in Table 2 , one-pot multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation of different aromatic nitro compounds was tested. Substrates bearing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryl ring of NB could be hydrogenated and alkylated to corresponding aromatic amines, alicyclic amines and the N-alkylated alicyclic amines with excellent switchable chemoselectivity. All aromatic nitro compounds could almost completely be hydrogenated to the corresponding aromatic amine at 50 °C in water. The stepwise hydrogenation to produce the fully hydrogenated amines could be achieved at 100 °C in ethanol. In addition, aromatic nitro compounds were completely hydrogenated and almost completely N-alkylated at 130 °C in isopropanol with just 0.5 MPa H2. In comparison with NB multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation, the presence of methyl group at ortho position had no obvious influence on catalytic activity and chemoselectivity (Table 2, entries 1–3 vs 4–6), and the N-alkylation chemoselectivity could reach as high as 99.8 %. When the methyl group was in the meta or para position, the chemoselectivity to alicyclic amines was slightly improved (Table 2, entries 8 and 11), while the chemoselectivity to N-alkylation alicyclic amines decreased to 95.4 % and 88.1 %, respectively (Table 2, entries 9 and 12). However, further enhancement of the electron donating effect in the ortho-substituted NB resulted in a significant decrease in the catalytic chemoselectivity to both alicyclic amine and N-alkylated alicyclic amine (Table 2, entries 14–15). When the substituents were electron-withdrawing groups, the catalytic activity slightly decreased. When the halogen substituted substrates were tested in the selective hydrogenation in ethanol or N-alkylation in isopropanol, severe dehalogenation was observed and high reaction temperature and alkaline of LDH might be responsible for the severe dehalogenation (Table 2, entries 17–18, 20–21) [40–42]. When the substituent groups were aldehyde or ketone, both nitro group and carbonyl group were hydrogenated in the selective hydrogenation at 100 °C or N-alkylation at 130 °C (Table 2, entries 23–24, 26–27). In short, 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 showed excellent catalytic performance in one-pot multi-directional selective hydrogenation and N-alkylation of a broad range of aromatic nitro compounds, and the extent of the chemoselectivity seemed to be subtly affected by the substituent in the substrate. We further studied the catalytic performance of one-pot chemiselective hydrogenation and N-alkylation of different alkyl alcohols with NB in the 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 catalyst. Under optimized conditions, all the NB conversion reached 100 %, and aniline could be hardly detected in the product, which indicated that 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 had high hydrogenation activity to both nitro group and benzene ring. Compared with 98.0 % N-alkylation selectivity in isopropanol at 130 °C and 0.5 MPa H2, 88.2 % N-alkylation chemoselectivity was achieved in 2-butanol (Table 3 , entry 1 vs 2), indicating less sterically hindered alcohols undergo faster N-alkylation. In order to achieve higher N-alkylation activity and chemoselectivity, the reactions with primary alcohol and tertiary alcohol were carried out at 150 °C and 3 MPa H2. The N-alkylation chemoselectivity of primary alcohol, including ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol, was 86.7 %, 88.9 % and 90.4 %, respectively (Table 3, entries 3–5). The stronger electron-donating ability of the alkyl group was the higher N-alkylation activity of alcohol achieved. However, the N-alkylation chemoselectivity in tert-butanol was only 21.0 % (Table 3, entry 6). Although tert-butyl group had strong electron-donating effect, steric hindrance mainly affected the N-alkylation at this time. So, with the integrated electronic and steric effect, the N-alkylation activity of NB and alkyl alcohols was secondary alcohol > primary alcohol > tertiary alcohol. Usually, N-alkylation of amine with alcohol involved alcohols dehydrogenation, imines formation, and imines hydrogenation [11,12]. Considering tertiary butanol could also be used for the N-alkylation over 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2, we speculated that the mechanism in this system included both alcohols dehydrogenation, imines formation along with imines hydrogenation hydrogen process and direct dehydration process between amino groups and alcohols [43]. Shortly, 5 wt% Ru/LDH-2 exhibited attractive activity in the N-alkylation of NB, and the application of this catalytic system could be extended to various alkyl alcohols. Quinoline and its derivatives have many biological activities and are widely used in the design and synthesis of dyes, drugs, insecticides and antioxidants [44–46]. However, using heterogeneous catalysts to regulate chemoselective hydrogenation of quinoline and its derivatives under mild conditions is still a daunting scientific challenge. Considering the excellent multi-directional hydrogenation performance of 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2, the chemoselective hydrogenation of quinoline and its derivatives was also studied. Quinoline could be easily hydrogenated to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline at 50 °C with 94.7 % chemoselectivity in ethanol (Table 4 , entry 1). Quinoline was completely hydrogenated at 100 °C with 100 % chemoselectivity in water (Table 4, entry 2). Interestingly, quinoline could be hydrogenated to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline with up to 68.5 % chemoselectivity in isopropanol in the presence of 4 Å MS (Table 4, entry 3). Catalytic hydrogenation chemoselectivity of 2-methylquinoline was lower than that of quinoline due to steric hindrance effect (Table 4, entries 4–6). Unexpectedly, the main product of the hydrogenation of 3-methylquinoline in ethanol was not the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivative but the corresponding 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline (Table 4, entry 7). This phenomenon might be explained that the steric hindrance formed by the Ru/LDH ultrathin platelets aggregation and the methyl group in the 3-methylquinoline blocked the contact of the pyridine ring with the Ru active center in ethanol. The multi-directional hydrogenation chemoselectivity of 8-methylquinoline was similar to that of quinoline (Table 4, entries 10–12). For comparison, 2,3-benzopyrrole and 1-benzothiophen were also examined (Table 4, entries 13–18). It's remarkable that 2,3-benzopyrrole could be completely hydrogenated in water. However, for 1-benzothiophene, the conversion was rather low. The low activity may be attributed to the affinity of sulfur atoms for its classical η1-S adsorption onto the surface of Ru NPs [47–49]. The interesting chemoselectivity change in the quinoline hydrogenation with different solvent was also preliminary discussed. Different solvent may affect the adsorption properties of substrate on catalysts, resulting in difference in activity and chemoselectivity in the liquid-phase reaction [50]. Table 5 examined the effect of different polarity (dielectric constant) solvents on the chemoselective hydrogenation with quinoline under mild conditions [51–53]. 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2 catalyst showed the best hydrogenation activity in water, mainly resulting in decahydroquinoline (Table 5, entry 1). Quinoline was mainly hydrogenated to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline in methanol and ethanol (Table 5, entries 2–3). The chemoselectivity to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline was greatly increased in isopropanol and toluene (Table 5, entries 4–5), although the conversion of quinoline was only 3.0 % in toluene. In high polarity methanol and ethanol solvent, π electrons of the benzene ring in quinoline could be attracted by the solvent [45], thus, the coordination between the LDH surface hydroxyl group and the benzene ring was inhibited and high chemoselectivity toward 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline was obtained. With the further solvent polarity increase, the catalytic hydrogenation activity evidently increased, therefore, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline could be further hydrogenated to generate decahydroquinoline. With the lower polarity solvent isopropanol and toluene, the interaction between solvent and benzene ring π electrons in quinoline was weakened, resulting in the corresponding increase of chemoselectivity to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline. Similar phenomenon in chemoselectivity change was also observed in some previous quinoline hydrogenation literature [54]. The chemoselectivity to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline in isopropanol further increased with the introduction of 4 Å MS (Table 5, entry 6). The N atom with lone pair electrons was more likely to interact with the acid sites on the 4 Å MS, resulting in the reduction of quinoline N atom interaction with the LDH hydroxyl groups in 5 wt%Ru/LDH-2. Acid sites were beneficial to improve the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline chemoselectivity, which was also reported in previous literature [55]. In short, both solvent polarity and acid sites in 4 Å MS impacted the chemoselectivity change in quinoline hydrogenation."
12,Conclusions,"In conclusion, Ru/LDH catalyst with characteristics of layered mesoporous structure and well dispersed small Ru NPs has been successfully prepared. With the guidance of atom economy, non-toxicity, harmlessness and energy saving in green catalysis, we have discovered a highly efficient and easy to operate one-pot tandem method by which we could directly produce a broad range of multi-directional chemoselective hydrogenated amines or N-alkyl aliphatic amines using aromatic nitro compounds as the starting material under mild conditions. By easily adjusting the reaction conditions in the Ru/LDH catalytic system, multi-directional excellent chemoselectivity to aromatic amines, alicyclic amines as well as N-alkyl aliphatic amines could be achieved with excellent catalytic activity and recyclability. The chemoselectivity switch of NB hydrogenation and N-alkylation was controlled by both the kinetic control and the action of the solvent to the catalyst. Additionally, this catalytic system also exhibited attractive activity and multi-directional chemoselectivity in the hydrogenation of quinoline and its derivatives with solvents of different polarity, and both solvent polarity and acid sites in 4 Å MS impacted the chemoselectivity change in quinoline hydrogenation."
