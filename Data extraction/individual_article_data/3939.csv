0,Introduction,"Transition metal-catalyzed reductions of carbonyl compounds are widely employed in the production of a wide range of important bulk and fine chemicals [1–4]. Thus transfer hydrogenation (TH) of ketones has emerged as an active area of research and a great effort is being directed towards design and development of transition metal-based catalysts for the TH of ketones [5]. This is mainly due to the greener and environmentally benign nature of this reaction, in comparison to the high-pressure molecular hydrogenation protocols [4,6,7]. To date, a variety of ruthenium(II)-based complexes have been reported as effective catalysts for the reduction of ketones. For example, Noyori et al. reported N-sulfonylated ethylenediamine ruthenium-based complexes in the transfer hydrogenation of ketones with remarkable catalytic activities of up to TOF of 227 h−1 [8]. Similarly, [RuCl(η6-Arene)(N-aryl sulfonyl-DPEN)] complexes have been applied as catalysts in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone and its derivatives displaying conversions of 99% within 2 h at catalyst/substrate ratio of 1/1000 [9]. Remarkably, Baratta and co-workers reported highly active Ru complexes displaying TOFs of up to 7 × 105 h−1 [10]. In another work, Martins et al. reported conversions of over 96% within 1 h at catalyst/substrate ratio of 1/100 using tethered N-alkylated TsDPEN Ru(II) catalysts in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone and its derivatives [11]. Recently, Satheesh et al. reported half-sandwich Ru(II) complexes, containing N^O Schiff base ligands, which show catalytic activities of up to 141 h−1 under base free conditions in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone [12]. Despite the success of ruthenium complexes in transfer hydrogenation of ketones, they have some drawbacks, such as excessive costs of establishment and instability under normal operating conditions. Thus, significant attention is being directed towards alternative metal complexes, which are relatively cheaper and more accessible [13,14]. In this category, Fe(II) complexes, containing various ligand systems have emerged as promising candidates in the transfer hydrogenation reactions [15–17]. For example, Langer and co-workers reported Fe(II) PNNP pincer complexes in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of acetophenone to give a TOF of 1 880 h−1 at room temperature [18]. A number of efficient Fe(II)-based catalysts derived from amino(imine)diphosphine organic moieties have been reported by Morris and co-workers in recent time. A classic example is the Fe(II) (P–NH–N–P) complexes which give TOFs of up to 200 s−1 [19]. Another highly active Fe(II) complexes reported by the Morris and co-workers is the Fe(II)-bis(phosphine) complexes displaying TOFs of 720 h−1 in the transfer hydrogenation reactions of a wide range of ketone substrates [20]. In the past few years, we have been working on the design and development of nitrogen-donor complexes as potential catalysts in the transfer of ketones, with promising results [21–23]. In our continued pursuit of cost-effective and stable catalysts for the (TH) of ketones. In this current contribution, we aimed to use readily accessible and stable Fe(II) complexes anchored on (pyridyl)imine ligands as catalysts in the TH of ketones. Thus, we herein report the structural elucidation, effects of complex structure and nature of ketone substrate on the TH of ketones using these Fe(II) complexes. In addition, insights into the nature of the active species have been gained through Hg(0) and sub-stoichiometric poisoning experiments and are discussed."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Syntheses and spectral characterization of Fe(II) complexes,"2.1 Syntheses and spectral characterization of Fe(II) complexes The (pyridyl)imine ligands 2,6-diisopropyl-N-[(pyridin-2-yl)methylene]aniline (L1), 2,6-diisopropyl-N-[(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene]aniline (L2), 2,6-dimethyl-N-[(pyridin-2-yl)methylene]aniline (L3), 2,6-dimethyl-N-[(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene]aniline (L4) and N-[(pyridin-2-yl)methylene]aniline (L5) were synthesized following modified literature procedures [24]. Detailed synthetic protocols and spectroscopic data have thus been provided as Supplementary materials (Figs. S1–S10). Treatments of ligands L1–L5 with FeCl2 in dichloromethane afforded the corresponding complexes cationic complexes Fe1–Fe4 and the neutral complex Fe5 as red solids in low to moderate yields (Scheme 1 ). On the other hand, reactions of L1 with FeCl2 in the presence of NaPF6 salt afforded the corresponding complex [Fe(L1)2]Cl][PF6] (Fe6) in 59% yield. All the complexes (Fe1–Fe6) were soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol but were insoluble in pentane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and hexane. The five-coordinate geometry in complexes Fe1–Fe4 could be driven by the steric bulk of ligands L1–L4. On the other hand, the less sterically demanding unsubstituted ligand L5 favours the formation of an octahedral complex as reported for complex Fe5. The formation of the [Fe(III)Cl4]− as a counter-anion in complexes Fe1–Fe4, instead of the expected [Fe(II)Cl3]− or simple Cl− anion, could be attributed to the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) due some adventitious moisture and oxygen during syntheses. This oxidation process is not new and has been observed by Erker [25] and Bauer [26] and co-workers. Structural characterization of the complexes was accomplished using infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, magnetic moment measurement, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, micro-analysis and single-crystal crystallography. In general, the IR spectra of the complexes indicated a redshift with respective to the ligand CN signals (Figs. S16–S20). This could be attributed to the π-electron flow from the ligand to the metal centre [27–29]. For instance, complex Fe1 showed an absorption band at 1629 cm−1 for the (–CN) imine group, while the corresponding free ligand (L1) recorded the same signal at 1637 cm−1 (Figs. S6 vs S16) and are in good agreement with absorption bands observed by Bauer co-workers [26]. ESI-MS technique was also employed to elucidate the identity and structure of the ligands and their respective Fe(II) complexes (Figs. S25–S29). In general, the ESI-MS data of the Fe(II) complexes showed the molecular ion peaks corresponding to the cationic fragments of the complexes. For example, complex Fe1 showed a signal at m/z = 623.3174 amu corresponding to the molecular mass of the cationic unit (Fig. S25). In addition, both the calculated and experimental mass isotopic distribution patterns were in good agreements in all the complexes (Figs. S25–S29). Elemental analysis data of compounds Fe1–Fe6 were consistent with the proposed structures in Scheme 1 and established the purity of the bulk materials."
3,Molecular structures of complexes Fe1 Fe2 and Fe5,"2.2 Molecular structures of complexes Fe1 Fe2 and Fe5 Single crystals suitable for X-ray analyses of complexes Fe1, Fe2 and Fe5 were grown by slow diffusion of hexane into dichloromethane solutions of Fe1, Fe2 and Fe5 at room temperature. Crystallographic data for complexes Fe1, Fe2 and Fe5 are summarized in Table 1 , while their molecular structures and selected bond parameters are given in Figs. 1–3 . Complexes Fe1 and Fe2 are penta-coordinate cationic species containing two ligands L1 and L2 motifs and one chlorido co-ligand in the coordination sphere. The positive charge on each complex is balanced by [FeCl4]- counter-anion (Figs. 1 and 2). On the other hand, the neutral compound Fe5 contains two bidentate ligand L5 units and two chlorido co-ligands (Fig. 3) to give a six-coordinate environment. Molecular structures of (pyridyl)imine Fe(II) complexes, bearing the counterion [FeCl4]-, are commonly encountered. For example, Erker [25] Bauer [26] Guo [30] and Solan [31] and co-workers have previously reported (pyridyl)imine Fe(II) showing similar coordination behaviour to our current Fe(II) complexes. The average bond distances of the Fe–Nim of 2.267(2) Å, 2.263(2) Å, 2.266(17) Å and Fe–Npy of 2.154(2) Å, 2.197(2) Å, 2.155(17) Å, for complexes Fe1 and Fe2 respectively are longer than the average bond distance of Nim–Fe (2.134(3) Å) and Npy–Fe (2.122(5) Å) obtained by averaging similar bond lengths in 32 related complexes reported to the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [32,33]. The average bond length of Fe–Nim of compounds Fe1 (2.163(2) Å and Fe2 (2.167(2) Å are comparable. The spatial arrangement around the Fe(II) atom in complexes Fe1 and Fe2 is such that the N atoms form four-membered basal ring representing a rectangle, with the Fe–Cl(1) bond sitting in the apical positions (Figs. 1 and 2). The Tau parameters (τ) for complexes Fe1 and Fe2 of 0.08 are consistent with square pyramidal geometries. This signifies comparable steric demands of ligands L1 and L2. The bond angles for Nim-Fe-Npy, Nim-Fe-Cl, Npy-Fe-Cl of 74.77(8)°, 101.00(6)° and 99.96(6)° in compounds Fe1, 75.64(8)°, 116.49(2)°, 99.96(6)° in complex Fe2 all deviate from the 90° expected for a perfect square pyramidal geometry. These deviations could be attributed to the steric constraints around the Fe(II) metal centres imposed by ligands L1 and L2. Comparatively, the distortion in complex Fe5 is minimal, possibly due to the less sterically demanding unsubstituted ligand L5."
4,Magnetic properties complexes Fe1-Fe6,"2.3 Magnetic properties complexes Fe1-Fe6 The effective magnetic moments of complexes, Fe1–Fe6 were determined at 297.3 K and the effective magnetic moment values (µeff ) were found to be in the range of 5.45–5.62 BM. These values are all above the spin-only magnetic moments for Fe(II) species (d6) of 4.90 BM, but all fall within the observed magnetic range of 5.6–5.9 BM [34]. The effective magnetic moment reported are thus consistent with some spin-orbital contributions to the observed magnetic moment values [35]. From this data, it is conceivable that the bulk magnetic moments of the cationic complexes (Fe1–Fe4) were largely controlled by the cationic [Fe(II)(L)2]+ core, since the observed moments are closer to those of a d6 than for a d5 ion [36,37]. The fine structure of EPR spectroscopy on the frozen solution of structurally characterised Fe(II) complexes (Fe1, Fe2, and Fe5) was performed at 77 K to determine the magnetic anisotropic parameters. In the X-band EPR spectra (Fig. 4 a and b), Fe1 and Fe2 showed anisotropic g-values (Fe1: gxx = gyy = g| = 2.31, gzz = g⊥ = 2.02 and Fe2: gxx = gyy = g| = 2.21, gzz = g⊥ = 2.01) which indicate spin sublevels with lowest S value (S = ±1/2) at the ground state). The g-tensors for the excitation characterising trigonal symmetry components x, y ≠ z indicating two spin-allowed Δms = ±1/2 with low EPR transition state involving unpaired spin in either ↑↑, ms = ±1, or ↓↓, ms = −1 within the Fe(II) dx2-y2 orbitals [38–40]. The EPR spectrum (Fig. 4c) of complex Fe5 pointed to typical character of single isotropic g-value (gxx = gyy = gzz = giso = 2.02), consistent with magnetically dilute system. This gives ms = −1, 0, and +1 triplet – state levels degenerate in the absence of applied magnetic field with Zeeman splitting being almost symmetrical and resulted in ms = +1 and ms = −1 states from ms = 0 state (barycentre). The Δms (spin allowed) = ±1 state, thus degenerate at giso frequency [41,42]."
5,Transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones catalyzed by complexes Fe1–Fe6,"2.4 Transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones catalyzed by complexes Fe1–Fe6 2.4.1 Effect of catalyst structure on transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone The complexes Fe1–Fe6 were investigated as catalysts in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of ketones using acetophenone as a model substrate (Tables 2 and S1). In a typical reaction, the substrate/complex/base ratio of 100/1/100 in excess iPrOH at 82 °C for 32 h was employed. Under these conditions, all the complexes (Fe1–Fe6) formed active catalysts in the TH of acetophenone to give percentage yields between 73% and 85% (Table 2 and Fig. 5 ). The percentage yields were monitored using 1H NMR spectroscopy employing anisole as an internal standard (Figs. S30–S33). The yields obtained confirmed the selectivity towards only the alcohol products. For example, yield of 45% obtained using catalyst Fe5 within 12 h (Fig. S31). To verify the role of the complexes in the catalyst system, we performed a control experiment using FeCl2 (Table 2, entry 7). Percentage yield of 18% was observed, indicating that, the higher catalytic activities reported were due to complexes Fe1–Fe6. From the conversion vs time plots of the complexes (Fig. 5) and the percentage conversions in Table 2, we observed that the catalytic activities of complexes Fe1–Fe6 were influenced by the electronic and steric properties imposed by the ligand backbone. For example, complex Fe1, supported on the aldimine ligand L1, displayed average yield of 85%, while the analogous complex Fe2, anchored on the ketimine ligand L2, recorded 74% (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). The lower yields reported for complex Fe2 could be attributed to the electron-rich methyl group, which has the net effect of decreasing the electrophilicity of the Fe metal, in tandem with the findings of Trovitch et al. using bis(pyridyl)imine Fe(II) complexes [43]. This hypothesis is also augmented by the lower yields of 73% recorded for the ketamine complex Fe4. The identity of the ligand aryl substituents also appeared to influence the catalytic performance of the complexes. For example, while complexes Fe1, bearing the isopropyl substituents furnished an average yield of 85%, the corresponding complex Fe3, bearing the methyl substituents afforded of 78% (Table 2, entries 1 and 3). While it is difficult to explain the higher catalytic activity of Fe1 compared to Fe3, improved solubility of Fe1 could be implicated. The neutral complex, Fe5, showed comparable average yield to complex Fe1, but relatively higher catalytic activities than the other cationic complexes Fe2–Fe4. This scenario is more complex since complex Fe5, is six-coordinate while complexes Fe2–Fe4 are five-coordinate. With respect to the role of counter-anion, higher yields of Fe1 (85%) than Fe6 (76%), points to a possible role of the counter-anion in regulating catalytic activities. In comparison to the most active catalysts reported in the literature [20,44–46] complexes Fe1–Fe6 exhibited lower catalytic activities. For instance, while catalysts Fe1–Fe6 achieved average yield of 73%–85% within 32 h (TOFs of 2.28–2.65 h−1), the Fe(II) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes reported by Pradeep et al. showed a percentage conversion of 98% in 30 min (TOF of 2194 h−1) under similar reaction conditions [47]. On the other hand, complexes Fe1–Fe6 displayed comparable or higher catalytic activities than some systems in the literature [48,49]. For instance, the Fe(II) isonitrile complexes reported by Reiser and co-workers afforded conversions of only 17% within 23 h [49]. 2.4.2 Optimization of the reaction conditions in transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone Upon establishing the viability of complexes Fe1–Fe6 as catalysts in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone, we turned our attention to the optimization of the reaction conditions. To achieve this, the effect of the nature of the base and catalyst loading (Fig. S29) were investigated using complex Fe1 as presented in Table 3 and S2. From the results in Table 3 , an increase in catalyst loading from 0.25 mol% to 1.25 mol% resulted in a decrease in TOF from 7.13 h−1 to 2.00 h−1 respectively (Table 3, entries 1–4, Fig. S29). This implies that, while there was an apparent quantitative increase in percentage conversions (57%–85%) with an increase in catalyst loadings, the magnitude of this increase is not commensurate with the amount of the catalyst added. Thus, lower catalyst loadings gave qualitatively better results as compared to activities obtained at higher catalyst loading. One possible reason for this could be catalyst aggregation, which results in a limited number of active sites available to the substrate [23]. These results are consistent with literature findings reported by Beller et al. using Fe(II) porphyrin catalysts, where an increase in catalyst loading from 0.01% to 0.5 mol%, resulted in a decrease in TOFs from 642 h−1 to 26 h−1 [13]. The effect of the base on the catalytic activity of complex Fe1 was also probed using KOH, KO t Bu, and Cs2CO3 at 100 mol% equivalents. From Table 3, KOH was found to give the highest percentage yield of 85%, while Cs2CO3 was barely active (Table 3, entries 5–6). The results agree with the increase in the base strength and mirror those previously reported by Morris et al., where KOH was the most active base among NaOH, Et3N and K t BuO [50]. 2.4.3 Investigation of the substrate scope using complex Fe1 Having established the optimum reaction conditions for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone using complex Fe1, we then expanded the scope of ketone substrates as shown in (Tables 4 and S3). From Table 4 , a significant increase in the reactivities of the substrates was controlled by the presence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the acetophenone derivatives. For example, 2′-chloroacetophenone and 4′-chloroacetophenone attained an average percentage yields of 93% and 99% respectively, compared to 85% recorded for acetophenone (Table 4, entries 1–4). On the other hand, the introduction of methyl groups as in 2-methyl and 4-methyl acetophenone witnessed diminished reactivities affording an average percentage yield of 75% and 81% respectively (Table 4, entries 5 and 6). The significant reduction in 2-methyl-acetophenone may be attributed to the additional steric effect, which has the overall effect of limiting substrate coordination to the active metal site. In addition, the diminished reactivities observed for the aliphatic 2-methyl cyclohexanone substrate of 66% and butanone of 57% (Table 4, entries 8 and 9) further supported the observations that electron-rich substrates result in lower yieds. Our current results and trends in the reactivities of the acetophenone derivatives mirror those of Yu et al. using (pyrazolyl)imine Ru(II) complexes [51]. 2.4.4 Determination of the nature of the active species in the transfer hydrogenation reactions It has been reported that the use of sub-stoichiometric amounts of poisoning agents such as PPh3, PCy3, CS2 and PMe3 may provide evidence for the formation of catalytically active metal nanoparticles under reducing conditions [52–55]. We thus used the poisoning agents PPh3 (20%), PCy3 (20%) and PPh3 (100%) and complex Fe1, to gain an insight into the nature of active species formation, in transfer hydrogenation process. From the kinetics profile shown in Fig. 6 , reduction in the catalytic activity of complex Fe1 was realized upon the introduction of the poisoning agents. For example, using PCy3 (20%), and PPh3 (20%), lower yields of 65% and 60% point to the presence of active Fe(0) nanoparticles [55]. This data was corroborated by the observation of dark suspensions during the course of the catalysis experiments. The near complete deactivation (25% yield) recorded upon addition of 100% equivalent of PPh3 further reinforced this hypothesis. On the other hand, the observed catalytic activity (25% yield) at 100% PPh3 equivalent, indicates the presence of some catalytically active homogeneous species, since for a pure heterogeneous species, complete deactivation is expected in the presence of 100 mol% equivalent of the poisoning reagent [56]. Since no single test can be used to fully conclude on the formation of Fe(0) nanoparticles as the active species, Hg(0) drop test was also conducted to confirm this phenomenon. In the mercury drop experiments, 3 and 5 drops of Hg(0) was added to a solution of the pre-activated catalyst Fe1 (Fig. 7 ). From Fig. 7, the addition of 3 drops of Hg(0) to Fe1 resulted in a decline in percentage yields from 85% to 50%. A further increase of Hg(0) to 5 drops was followed by a larger decline in catalytic activity to a yield of 38% (Fig. 7 a). In another experiment, we introduced 5 drops of Hg(0) after 12 h of reaction time (approximately 50%) and observed retardation in the percentage yield to 65%, instead of 85% in the control experiment (Fig. 7 a). The reductions in catalytic activities of complex Fe1 upon addition of Hg(0) in all these experiments point to the possible presence of catalytically active Fe(0) nanoparticles in the reaction mixture [56,57] and agrees with the data reported in the sub-stoichiometric experiments. Considering the presence of [FeCl4]− and [PF6]− counter-anions in complexes Fe1 and Fe6 respectively, together with the neutral complex Fe5, we attempted to investigate a possible role of the counter-anions in the formation active Fe(0) nanoparticles (Fig. 7b). From Fig. 7b, catalyst Fe1, bearing the [FeCl4]− counter-anion, suffered the greatest loss in catalytic activity (from 85% to 38%) compared to catalyst Fe6, bearing the [PF6]−, which showed minor reductions from 76% to 45%. While this data is consistent with the greater formation of more active Fe(0) nanoparticles in complex Fe1, the exact role of the [FeCl4]- counter-anion in promoting the same is not clear to us at this point. We can only postulate that the presence of higher total Fe content (as in Fe1) in the catalyst matrix, may accelerate the formation of Fe-Hg amalgam."
6,Conclusions,"A series of Fe(II) complexes bearing (pyridyl)imine ligands were synthesized and structurally characterized. The coordination chemistry of the complexes was largely controlled by the steric bulk of the ligand, to form five- and six-coordinate compounds. All the complexes formed active catalysts in the transfer hydrogenation of ketones. The catalytic activities of the complexes depended on the coordination environment and steric encumbrance around the central Fe(II) atom. The catalysts mediate the transfer hydrogenation of a wide range of ketone substrates. Both sub-stoichiometric and Hg(0) poisoning tests results were consistent with the possible formation of both Fe(0) nanoparticles and homogeneous Fe(II) intermediates as the active species."

Data collection and structure refinement were recorded on a Bruker Apex Duo equipped with an Oxford Instrument Cryo jet operating at 100(2) K and an uncoated micro source operating at 30 W power [58]. The data were collected with Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation at a crystal-to-detector distance of 50 mm. The data collections were performed using omega and phi scans with exposures taken at 30 W X-ray power and 0.50° frame width using APEX2. Data reduction, scaling and absorption corrections were performed using the program SAINT using outlier rejection, scan speed scaling, as well as standard Lorentz and polarization correction factors [59]. A SADABS semi-empirical multi-scan absorption correction was also applied to the data. Direct methods, SHELXS-2013 and WinGX were used to solve the structure [60]. All non-hydrogen were located in the difference map and refined anisotropically with SHELXZ-2013 [61]. All the hydrogen atoms were included as idealized contributors in the least-squares process. Their positions were calculated using a standard riding model with C–Haromatic distances of 0.93 Å and U iso = 1.2 U eq and C–Hmethylene distances of 0.99 Å and U iso = 1.2 U eq and C–Hmethyl distances of 0.98 Å and U iso = 1.5 U eq."
11,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation experiments,"4.4 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation experiments 4.4.1 General procedure for transfer hydrogenation of ketones Transfer hydrogenation reactions were performed in a two-necked round bottom flask connected to a reflux condenser under nitrogen gas atmosphere. In a typical experiment, a solution of KOH (0.11 g, 1.00 eq.) in iPrOH (5 mL) and complex Fe1 (0.016 g, 0.02 mmol, 1.00 mol%) were refluxed at 82 °C for 30 min to generate the active species (pre-activation). This was followed by addition of acetophenone (0.23 mL, 2.00 mmol) dropwise into the reaction mixture to a give a molar ratio of Acetophenone/KOH/Fe1 of 100:100:1. The reaction was allowed to proceed for a further 32 h. In the course of the reaction, about 0.1 mL aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn using a syringe at regular time intervals, cooled, and the percentage yields of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol were determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy according to the following protocol: The percentage conversions were determined using the formula: [IStd-IS]/[Istd] × 100%, where [Istd] is the integral value of OC H 3 signal at 3.78 ppm of the internal standard (methoxybenzene, anisole) and [IS] is the integral value of C H 3 protons signal at 2.58 ppm of the substrate (i.e acetophenone) at time t. The percentage yields were determined using the formula: [IP]/[Istd] × 100% where [IP] is the integral value of C H 3 proton signal between 1.41 and 1.48 ppm of 1-phenylethanol product. 4.4.2 Mercury poisoning experiments This mercury poisoning experiments were conducted following the same general procedure as described in Section 4.4.1. In a typical experiment, complex Fe1 (0.016 g, 0.02 mmol, 1.00% mol) and KOH (0.112 g, 1.0 eq.) in iPrOH (5 mL) were refluxed under nitrogen for 30 min to generate the active species. After the pre-activation, the acetophenone substrate (0.23 mL, 2.00 mmol) and 3 or 5 drops of Hg(0) were introduced into the catalyst solution refluxed for 32 h at 82 °C. During the course of the reaction, about 0.1 mL of the reacting mixture was sampled at regular time intervals, cooled and analyzed for percentage conversions and yields were determined 1H NMR spectroscopy as described in Section 4.4.1. 4.4.3 Sub-stoichiometric poisoning experiments In a typical experimental design, the poisoning agent, for example, PPh3 (20% mol equivalent with respect to the Fe1 catalyst) and acetophenone substrate (0.23 mL, 2.00 mmol) were added to the pre-activated catalyst system of Fe1 (0.016 g 1% mmol) and KOH (0.11 g, 2.00 mmol, 100 mol%) in iPrOH (5 mL) and refluxed at 82 °C for 32 h. During the reaction period, samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals, cooled and the percentage yields were determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy as described in Section 4.4.1."
