0,Introduction,"In plants, the lignin is synthesized through combinatorial free radical polymerization of phenylpropanoid basic units, namely, p-coumaryl alcohol (H), coniferyl alcohol (G), and sinapyl alcohol (S), among which the secondary benzylic alcohol (Cα–OH) is one of the most abundant units in β-O-4 linkages (Scheme 1a) [1–3]. Lignin is produced in large quantities in the process of pulping and producing of bioethanol, and the main utilization of lignin is limited in converting it to heat. However, lignin typically has a low heating value due to its stability and high oxygen content. Therefore, efficient depolymerization and deoxygenation are key steps for converting lignin and its derived compounds into high value chemicals or liquid fuels. Up to now, a variety of methods has been intensively and extensively studied to convert lignin to value-added chemicals and fuels [4–8]. Among them, the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis (CTH) of lignin has attracted much attention due to that the hydrogen gas can be replaced by the liquid hydrogen donor for the hydrotreatment of lignocellulosic feedstocks [9]; nevertheless, an in-depth insight of catalytic processes, together with the reaction mechanisms involved in the cleavage of Caromatic-Cα and Cα-O bonds over a novel catalyst, is still needed. Renewable organic molecules, such as alcohol, formic acid, tetralin and co-solvent system, are widely used as hydrogen donors for CTH of lignin-derived feedstocks [10,11]. Hu et al. reported the hydrogenolysis of aryl ether linkages carried out in the presence of PtRe/TiO2 and iso-propanol [12]. Guan and co-workers studied the CTH of lignin model compound hydroquinone monobenzyl ether using iso-propanol as H-donor and found isopropanol can provide more hydrogen atoms to promote CTH reaction [9]. Organic solvent as the in situ H-donor provides several advantages in terms of storage and transport [13]. Among the various organic H-donors, isopropanol is one of the most promising due to the excellent hydrogen transfer property [11,14]. The full process is atom-economical and environmentally friendly because merely water is produced as a byproduct [9]. The selective non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohol as reported recently is a high effective reaction to make commodity chemicals using noble-metal catalysts [15,16]. Early research has shown that noble metal palladium catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic capability for the dehydrogenation of ethanol [17]. However, quick deactivation by coke deposition and easily leach or oxidation of palladium takes place during catalytic processes, resulted in palladium particle sintering and weak interaction between the metal NPs and support [18,19]. Therefore, to explore more effective catalyst supporting materials and its structure is necessary. Several recent studies have demonstrated the nitrogen-doped carbon supports (e.g., N-GCSs, CN0.132, and mpg-C3N4) have high stability for the preparation of palladium catalysts [18–21]. N introduced into support structure as polarization between metal nanoparticles and carbon restrains the over oxidation of metal nanoparticles and remains the extraordinary metallic ratio [22,23]. Chitosan can be obtained from the deacetylation of chitin-poly(acetylglucosamine), which is the second most abundant biopolymer in the world [24]. Chitosan carbonaceous carrier exhibited bright luminescence with absolute quantum properties [25], which could dramatically improve the activity and stability of the catalysts [26]. Taken into account that α hydroxyl is the plentiful functional group in lignin (Scheme 1), selective alcoholysis to cleave the Cα-OH linkages in lignin would be desirable. These alcohol functional groups are firstly selective non-oxidative dehydrogenated to the corresponding aldehyde (b) by step I [27]. Product (b) further is transformed into (c) and (d) through the selective scission of Caromatic-Cα and Cα-O via catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis (step II) using iso-propanol and Cα-OH as H-source [3], which results in effectively removal of the excess oxygen and partially increase of the C/O and H/O in lignin structure. As a result, lignin can be liquefied into hydrocarbon fuel or aromatic chemicals at moderate temperature and pressure. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not clear how cleavage of Caromatic-Cα and Cα-O bonds over a noble catalyst. Model compounds are usually applied to study the reaction pathway and mechanism of lignin valorization [28]. 3,4-Dimethoxybenzyl (veratryl) alcohol represents a typical non-phenolic lignin model compound. It has been extensively studied for understanding the chemistry of lignin valorization and exploring efficient transformation routes [29]. In this research, we reported a catalyst made of palladium supported on N doped carbon by wet impregnation method for the selective deoxygenation of veratryl alcohol carrying out in iso-propanol, which gave high activity in the Caromatic-Cα and Cα-O cleavage. Catalysts doped N gave rise to synergistic properties, and led to the full conversion of substrate under mild conditions. Theoretical DFT calculations were employed to investigate the possible formation pathways of the main alcoholysis products. We believe this work will provide novel insight for designing and screening the multifunctional catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation of lignin oil using renewable solvent."

Experimental procedure is described in the main part of manuscript, while the operating conditions are given in Table S1."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The nitrogen-enriched carbon nitride (CNX) was synthesized by calcination of chitosan (5.0 g, 4 h) at 5 °C·min−1 in flowing nitrogen at a rate of 20 ml·min−1 using silica crucible in a furnace (GSL-1100×, Kejing, Guangzhou) operating at 600 °C [21]. The fresh CNX repeated handling three times with 5 mol·l−1 HNO3 to wash off impurities and introduce defects then further washing to a neutral pH with deionized water [19,30]. 0.5 g CNX was first dispersed in 1000 ml deionized water and sonicated for another 3 h. Then 25 ml aqueous solution of 0.5 mM Pd(O2CCH3)2 was added to the dispersed solution at RT and the reaction mixture was further stirred for 4 h. 1.0 g sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was dropwise added into the solution containing catalyst powders at 50 °C to reduce the Pd (II) to Pd (0). This reaction mixture was stirred for the next 12 h. The suspension was filtered and the solid part was washed with deionized water and methanol for three times. Then the suspension was centrifuged and the solid part was washed with deionized water three times. The supported 5% Pd/CNX sample was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum for 24 h, and the final catalysts were obtained. 5% Pd/mesoporous carbon 5% Pd/C, 5% Pd/ZSM-5, 5% Pd/C@TiO2 [31], and Fe-5% Pd/C@TiO2 were prepared using the same procedure as that of Pd/CNX, but the CNX was replaced with the corresponding support."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The obtained Pd/CNX powder was analyzed by a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operated at accelerating voltage of 200 kV to observe the texture and morphology. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by dispersing the catalyst powders (after grinding) in high-purity ethanol (60 min ultrasound treatment), and allowing a drop of the suspension to dry on a carbon-coated copper grid. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the CNX and Pd/CNX were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms from a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 equipment at 77 K. Before testing, all the catalyst samples were outgassed at 300 °C for 3 h under 5 × 10−9 Torr vacuum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Pd/CNX powder was examined on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD (UK) multi-technique system under ultrahigh vacuum (~5 × 10−9 Torr) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hv = 1486.6 eV). All XPS spectra were recorded using an aperture slot of 700 × 300 μm, survey spectra were recorded with a pass energy of 160 eV, and high-resolution spectra were recorded with a pass energy of 40 eV."
5,Catalytic activity measurement,"2.4 Catalytic activity measurement Catalytic alcoholysis experiments were performed in a sealed batch reactor under operating conditions, given in Table S1. Iso-propanol was used as the solvent and hydrogen donor. The reactor temperature was programmed to increase from 25 °C to experimental temperature at a ramp rate of 5 °C·min−1. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses were performed on an Agilent 5975 gas chromatograph equipped with an elastic quartz capillary column HP-5 MS (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (model HP 5973) detector. Helium was used as carrier gas (flow rate of 1 ml·min−1)."
6,Computational details and methodologies,"2.5 Computational details and methodologies Molecular geometrical optimizations of intermediates and transition states were performed using M06L hybrid meta-GGA functional [32] with the Grimme's dispersion-correction D3 [33,34] and a mixed basis set (BS1, the valence double-zeta polarized basis set 6-31G (d) was used to describe the C, H, and O atoms, and the pseudo potential basis set LANL2DZ [35] was used to describe Pd atoms). Besides, the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM, isopropanol) [36,37] was employed to elucidate the solvent effects. In order to confirm the transition state of each elementary was connected with the reactant and product, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were carried out. To consider the solvent effect, the single-point energy calculations were performed for all optimized intermediates and transition states by M06L-D3 functional with a larger mixed basis set (BS2, C, H, and O atoms: 6-311G (d,p), Pd atoms: LANL2TZ [35]). All DFT calculations were implemented in the Gaussian09 D.01 program package [38]. The models in the figures were depicted using Gauss View 5.0. All optimized structural coordinates of intermediates and transition states were also shown in SI."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The textural property of catalysts,"3.1 The textural property of catalysts Heteroatom nitrogen was introduced into carbon materials to enhance p-binding ability by tuning the surface structure of CNX support, which is beneficial to keep the stability of Pd nanoparticles and restrain of Pd (0) from re-oxidation [19,39]. The catalytic activity of metal supported catalysts and the selectivity toward target products largely dependent on the particle size and particle size distribution [16]. The formation of highly dispersed Pd NPs was proven by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1a). As can be seen, the average of the crystallite size was observed to be 2.81 nm (Fig. 1b), which was a quite small value comparing to the reported studies [18,19,39]. Pd NPs was also detected through the use of elemental mapping (Fig. 1c). A broad Pd NPs size distribution is apparent from the maps. HAADF-STEM images of the Pd/CNX catalyst provide evidence for the crystal structure of the Pd NPs. Fig. 1d displays (111) and (200) for two main crystal planes of Pd corresponding to lattice parameters of 0.23 and 0.20 nm, respectively, with a plane angle of 55° [19]. The adsorption-desorption isotherms of the CNX (purple trend line 1) and Pd/CNX catalyst (blue trend line 2) can be assigned to micropore materials with BJH adsorption average pore diameters of 3.29 nm (Fig. 1e). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for the Pd/CNX presents a well-defined plateau and can be classified as type 1 according IUPAC [40]. Compared with other palladium-carbon catalysts (Table S2), the catalyst synthesized in this work has higher surface area as well as much smaller pore diameter. Pd/CNX was found to have a total surface area of 1033.1 m2 ·g−1, with micropore volume of 0.59 cm3 ·g−1. The large surface area can improve the dispersity of metal sites over the catalyst surface [41]. These results indicate the successful fabrication of the nano-porous structure in Pd/CNX. The XPS survey scan spectrum of Pd/CNX and its high resolutions spectra are shown in Fig. 1f to i. The survey spectra in Fig. 1f confirmed the presence of the Pd, N, C and O elements in Pd/CNX. The survey spectrum displays three major binding energy peaks at 284.6, 398.3 and 335.2 eV corresponding to C 1s, N 1s and Pd 3d, respectively [20]. Pd/CNX contains 70.5% Pd0 as showed by Pd 3d5/2 XPS peak at 336.7 and Pd 3d3/2 XPS peak at 341.1 eV [18,39,42]. Palladium catalysts supported on N-doped carbon shows that the presence of heteroatom nitrogen results in an enhancement of Pd (0) by reduction of polarization between palladium NPs and CNX, and prevent it from re-oxidation [22,30]. The C 1s spectrum is deconvoluted to three binding peaks and appeared at 284.7, 285.6 and 288.1 eV, which reveals the existence of sp2 carbon (C=C), sp2 carbon (C-C/C-O/C-N) and C–N–C functional groups, respectively [20,21,43]. The high resolutions spectrum of N 1s contains three major deconvolution peaks at 397.2, 398.5 and 402.1 eV (Fig. 1i), endorsed to C-N=C (28.0%), -N-C (58%) and N-3C (14%), respectively [20,21,43]. The nitrogen functionalities on the surface of the carbon materials might serve as Lewis bases sites [44], with enhanced p-binding ability, which are suitable for stabilizing highly dispersed Pd(0) particles and preventing their oxidation [18]. The surface of nitrogen-enriched carbonaceous material from chitosan exhibited bright luminescence with absolute quantum properties [25], which could dramatically improve the activity and stability of the catalysts [26]."
9,Catalytic activity of Pd/CNX,"3.2 Catalytic activity of Pd/CNX To elucidate the usefulness of this nano-porous catalyst, the activity of Pd/CNX for selective alcoholytic cleavage of Cα-OH and Caromatic-Cα bonds was evaluated using iso-propanol as H-donor and solvent. Here we used veratryl alcohol, a common component of lignin-derived oil, as a substrate to explore the catalytic performance of Cα-OH and Caromatic-Cα bonds. First a blank reaction without catalyst was carried out, nearly no conversion of veratryl alcohol was observed (Fig. 2a and Table 1 , entry 1). Pd/CNX shows a considerably better reaction activity by comparison with Pd/C or other catalysts including Pd/mesoporous carbon, Pd/ZSM-5, Pd/C@TiO2, and Fe-Pd/C@TiO2. Full conversion of the veratryl alcohol into 46% of 1,2-dimethoxy-benzene (a) and 54% of 3,4-dimethoxytoluene (b) was achieved after reaction for 8 h at 220 °C. Table 1 entry 5 clearly shows that in the present of 0.5 ml 1% formic acid, this rate of yield is changed in favor of product b (nearly 70%). Formic acid can be converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide in iso-propanol solvent at 200 °C [21], which prohibited the scission of Caromatic-Cα bond. This is maybe ascribed to the formato-palladium intermediate which inhibits the disproportionation pathway by HCOO Image 1 adsorption with Pd to block the vacant coordination sites of Pd for veratryl alcohol (Fig. S1) [13]. Time-on-stream performance for veratryl alcohol hydrogenolysis over Pd/CNX is shown in Fig. 2b. Under applied reaction conditions, the scission of Caromatic-Cα and Cα-OH bonds of veratryl alcohol to products a and b appear to be the dominant pathways. 3,4-Dimethoxy-benzaldehyde (c) was detected as the primary product (Fig. 2c), indicating that Pd/CNX is a truly selective non-dehydrogenation catalyst for the bond of Cα-OH. Furthermore, the Pd supported on CNX catalyst can easily be separated from the reaction solution by simple filtration and be reused without significant loss of activity and selectivity up to four times (Table S3). Typically, the reaction rate is mainly improved with bifunctional and synergistic effects, while the activity and selectivity of alcoholysis reaction are generally influenced by electronic effects and geometric [45]. The nitrogen on the carbon may act as a critical role to affect the electronic properties of Pd. Generally, chemisorbed veratryl alcohol on the support can be activated by the Pd sites before the reaction [18]. Nitrogen in the carbon favors the electron (available hydrogen) transfer to Pd sites and the resultant electron-rich Pd greatly improves the catalytic activity [46]. Moreover, the hydrophilic property of Pd/CNX can be increased by doping with N atoms, which promotes the dispersion of the catalyst in iso-propanol and enhances the hydrogen transfer performance [19]. These results indicate that the Pd/CNX exhibits excellent selective alcoholysis activity and selectivity for veratryl alcohol under implemented reaction conditions. It has been known that lignin contains plenty of α hydroxyl. The lignin alcoholysis was examined over the Pd/CNX catalyst in a stainless stirred reactor. The product yields of lignin alcoholysis is presented in Fig. S4 and Table S4. It should be noted that the GC–MS analysis presented below is semi-quantitative based on percentages of the chromatogram peak areas. As can be seen, 1.64% C7 yield, 9.10% C8 yield, and 2.61% C9 yield were obtained over the kraft lignin. C7–C9 are also the main products and the product distribution is similar to the kraft lignin in all the observed instances. 1.77% C7 yield, 8.11% C8 yield, and 2.66% C9 yield were obtained over the enzymatic hydrolysis lignin. The differences in the product distribution may be ascribed to the difference existed molecular structure between kraft lignin, lignosulfonate and enzymatic hydrolysis lignin [47]. Nevertheless, lignin alcoholysis products are all composed mainly of C7–C9 aromatic compounds of removal α hydroxyl. These results suggest that catalytic hydrogen transfer to cleave the Cα-OH linkages in lignin is possible in alcoholysis catalyzed by Pd/CNX."
10,Reaction mechanism,"3.3 Reaction mechanism In order to have better insight into the selective alcoholysis of veratryl alcohol, kinetic studies are carried out to evaluate the catalytic performance with reaction time using iso-propanol as H-donor in the presence of Pd/CNX catalyst as depicted in Fig. S2. As shown in Fig. S5a, a graphical kinetic analysis revealed the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of veratryl alcohol in this experiment appears to be best fit multi-step-reaction characteristics with a constant rate. At the experimental temperatures investigated, the Pd/CNX catalyst displayed a fast rate in the first 2 h. The activation energy (E a ) of 7.61 kcal·mol−1 in the first stage is slightly lower than the second stage (32.02 kcal·mol−1), showing approximately first-order reaction characteristics (Fig. S5b). The products distribution pattern changes within the investigated temperature range. The conversion of veratryl alcohol less 80% at 160 °C for 6 h, with 37% of product a and 31% of product b (Fig. S2a). In the case, only trace amounts of byproduct generated from the oxidation of substrate d was observed in the initial period. Comparatively, product c reaches the highest concentration (~10%, 60 min), progressively decreasing because of further catalytic hydrogenolysis into products a and b. Veratryl alcohol conversion progressively rises (from 76.5% at 160 °C to 99.9% at 220 °C) at increased reaction temperatures. In the presence of Pd/CNX, the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of veratryl alcohol proceeds appreciably at 220 °C, with a rate constant k 1 of 0.0256 min−1 and k 2 of 0.0086 min−1 (Figs. S2d and S5b). The results show that the reaction temperature has a significant effect on the selective alcoholysis of veratryl alcohol with Pd/CNX catalyst. Experimental research suggests that products a and b were formed inevitably under the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of veratryl alcohol, while two intermediates c and d are also captured. However, the detailed mechanism of the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of veratryl alcohol remains elusive. The application of density functional theory (DFT) as a theoretical method of quantum mechanics has enormously increased in the mechanism research due to its reliability and accuracy. Thus, a DFT calculation was carried out combined with experimental results to obtain further insights into the course of the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of veratryl alcohol. On the basis of literature reports [48,49] and our own experimental observations, the reactions for the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of veratryl alcohol are depicted in Fig. 3 . It is widely accepted that in situ dehydrogenation proceeds through initial O-H bond scission of the secondary alcohol to form an adsorbed alkoxide [16,50]. Iso-propanol plays a crucial role in the selective alcoholysis of veratryl alcohol. CαH–OH groups of veratryl alcohol and iso-propanol are initially dehydrogenated reversibly into product c and acetone form a “hydrogen pool” on Pd/CNX with an approach to equilibrium (η 1 , η 2 ) [51,52]: C H 3 O 2 C 6 H 3 C H 2 OH ↔ K deh 1 C H 3 O 2 C 6 H 3 CHO + H 2 , η 1 = P H 2 P veratraldehyde P veratryl alcohol 1 K deh 1 C H 3 2 CHOH ↔ K deh 2 C H 3 2 CO + H 2 , η 2 = P H 2 P acetone P iso − propanol 1 K deh 2 Subsequently, the adsorbed hydrogen can be activated to form H− in the “hydrogen pool” [53], consequently promoting the yield of the a (INT8) and b (INT10). The nitrogen atoms in the Pd/CNX catalyst would serve as Lewis bases to promote the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen [44]. On the basis of the assumed above mentioned, the energy requirements for the selective alcoholytic/hydrogenolytic cleavage of Cα–OH and Caromatic-Cα were investigated by comparing the relative free energy barriers (∆G‡) and reaction energies (∆Gr) to dissociation veratryl alcohol into transition state (TS) and intermediates (INT), as shown in Fig. 3. The Cα–OH bond cleavage of veratryl alcohol into INT10 can occur via either the activation of the aromatic ring (∆G‡ = 22.6 kcal·mol−1, in pathway A) or direct hydrogenolysis (Fig. S6a) [54]. In ring activation, active H− on the “hydrogen pool” is added to C6, resulting in the aromatic ring to lose aromaticity, which leads to the formation of an unsteady reaction intermediate. The OH is bonded with an H− on the surface of the Pd/CNX catalyst to produce H2O. There are several possible pathways proposed to elucidate the Caromatic-Cα dissociations described in the network. In the first step, the dehydrogenation of veratryl alcohol to INT2 ((CH3O)2C6H3C⁎HOH), which was confirmed by DFT calculations, is energetically preferred over the INT11 ((CH3O)2C6H3CH2O⁎) intermediate. After that, the INT11 dehydrogenates to form INT3 (pathway C), which can either dehydrogenate or desorb to generate the acyl structure (pathway B) [55]. Generally, Caromatic-Cα bond of acyl intermediate is cleaved to produce INT7 ((CH3O)2C5H3C⁎) intermediate and CO (Fig. S6b). The first elementary reaction is the rate-limiting step with a free energy barrier of 23.3 kcal·mol−1. Direct hydrogenolysis needs to overcome higher energy barriers (ΔG‡ = 36.1 kcal·mol–1, see the pathway E). Caromatic-Cα hydrogenolysis in iso-propanol occurs only at the Caromatic-Cα bond vicinal to the O atom because that the CO double bond in product c significantly weakens the adjacent Caromatic-Cα bond [51]. Furthermore, by pathway D, INT3 can be hydroxylated by the solvent isopropanol to produce a carboxyl species (INT5), which can generate INT8 with decarboxylation. Nonetheless, the effective free energy barrier (∆G‡) of pathway D is 22.6 kcal·mol−1, which is much higher than that of elimination of acyl in pathway B (∆G‡ = 11.5 kcal·mol−1). Hence, pathway D is hardly occurred because of unfavorable thermodynamics. Indeed, INT5 was not detected in the product mixtures obtained by the catalytic experiments. As a consequence, pathway A and B are preferred as the most favorable pathways to produce INT10 and INT8, respectively. While the rate-limiting step of pathway A (∆G‡ = 22.6 kcal·mol−1) is almost isoenergetic to that of pathway B (∆G‡ = 23.3 kcal·mol−1), and the approximately equal production of INT8 and INT10 has been observed in the experiments."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, we have synthesized a porous N-doped Pd catalyst, which was proved to be an excellent activity in the selective alcoholytic cleavage of Cα-OH bond in veratryl alcohol. The proportion of Pd (0) in this catalyst was significantly increased when N precursor from chitosan was introduced. Catalysts doped N gave rise to synergistic properties, and the hydrogen binding sites and chemisorbed sites of catalyst led to the full conversion of substrate under mild conditions. The processes occur by in situ generation of adsorbed hydrogen by the catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of a secondary alcohol, and followed by catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis of Cα-OH and Caromatic-Cα bonds of veratryl alcohol. A high yield of 3,4-dimethoxytoluene was obtained as a result of the synergistic effects of Pd/CNX catalyst and formic acid. Importantly, this catalyst system can realize the bond cleavage of kraft lignin, lignosulfonate and enzymatic hydrolysis lignin. The alcoholysis products are composed mainly of C7–C9 aromatic compounds of removal α hydroxyl. Experimental results and first-principles calculations confirmed that Cα-OH bond scission are rate-limiting step due to requires overcoming the lower reaction barriers (22.6 kcal·mol−1) than Cα dehydrogenation (23.3 kcal·mol−1). This work reveals novel insight into for designing and screening the multifunctional catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation of lignin."
