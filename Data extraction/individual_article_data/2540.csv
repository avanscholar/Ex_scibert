0,Introduction,"Rising environmental concerns and reducing petroleum resources have led to the development of materials products from renewable biopolymers, e.g., konjac glucomannan (KGM), starch, cellulose, protein, and lignin. KGM is a non-ionic polysaccharide constituted by β-d-glucose and β-D-mannose connected by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds (Davé & McCarthy, 1997; Nishinari, 2000). This biopolymer is highly potential for various materials applications such as package and encapsulation, due to features involving excellent film-forming ability, and biodegradability (Wu et al., 2018). However, the KGM materials may show limited applications because of their inherent shortages, e.g., poor mechanical features and high hydrophilicity (Wu et al., 2019; Zhang, Xie, & Gan, 2005). Furthermore, to prepare biopolymer materials including films, wet processing methods (such as solution casting) have been widely practiced. For such processing, the biopolymer solution or dispersion is firstly prepared, followed by casting and removal of the solvent (Cuq, Gontard, & Guilbert, 1998). The sol-gel features (e.g., sol viscosity and sol-gel transition point) of the biopolymer systems are curial for the quality control of film products (Peressini, Bravin, Lapasin, Rizzotti, & Sensidoni, 2003). For instance, using different film-forming temperatures (below or above sol-gel transition point) apparently varies the mechanical properties of KGM related composites (Qiao et al., 2019). Therefore, to design KGM related materials with desirable performance, it indispensable to tailor the practical features (e.g., sol-gel, mechanical and hydrophobic parameters) of associated biopolymer systems. The inclusion of another polymers can be an economical and effective way to modify the performance of polymer materials (Taguet, Bureau, Huneault, & Favis, 2014; Yu, Dean, & Li, 2006). Agar is a polysaccharide extracted from the cell wall of red algae, and mainly contains 1, 3-linked β- d -galactopyranose and 1, 4-linked 3, 6-anhydro-α-L- galactopyranose or agarobiose (Lahaye & Rochas, 1991). It has been confirmed that this biopolymer displayed good compatibility with KGM, and its incorporation increased the tensile strength of KGM films (Qiao et al., 2019). Also, the agar/KGM binary hydrogel possessed enhanced stability relative to the single component system (Yuan et al., 2018). Despite such efforts, the agar/KGM materials still exhibit low water resistance (hydrophobicity), being not beneficial for their applications such as package. Also, there is still a room to further increase the mechanical features of these binary materials. It is noted that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) incorporation can be an approach to tailor the water resistance and other features of biopolymer materials. PVA possesses various advantages such as biodegradability, easy processibility, and chemical resistance (Frone et al., 2011). Blending PVA with starch (Cano et al., 2015; Tang & Alavi, 2011), lignin nanomicelle (Zhang, Liu, Liu, & Qiu, 2020) and chitosan (Cazón, Vázquez, & Velazquez, 2018) can lead to materials with enhanced water resistance. In addition, KGM/PVA/Na+ modified nanocomposite exhibits improved mechanical properties and thermal stability (Yang, Ma, Guo, & Zhang, 2013); KGM and PVA can be used to prepare materials encapsulating lemon essential oil/vermiculite with antimicrobial properties for food storage (Li et al., 2021); agar and PVA have been mainly applied to prepare composite hydrogels (Chen et al., 2016; Samadi, Sabzi, & Babaahmadi, 2018; Wang et al., 2021). Nonetheless, to date, it remains largely unclear how PVA inclusion modulates the sol-gel, mechanical and hydrophobic features of agar/KGM systems. This prevents us from developing related ternary composites with associated performance. To this end, series of analytical techniques were used to understand the rheological (sol-gel), microstructural, mechanical, and hydrophobic features of agar/KGM and agar/KGM/PVA systems. Then, the underlying links between the microstructural and practical features were discussed. The present results would further benefit the design and production of biopolymer-based composites with demanded practical properties."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Agar (gel strength: 800–1200 g/cm2; weight-average molar mass: 5.997 × 105 g/mol; agarose/agaropectin ratio: 36.3/63.7) and konjac glucomannan powder (weight-average molar mass: 9.67 × 105 g/mol; viscosity: 30,000 mPa·s at 1% w/v) were purchased from Biofroxx (Einhausen, Hessen, Germany) and Hubei Konson Konjac Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China), respectively. PVA (type: 2488; weight-average molar mass: 0.9–1.5 × 104 g/mol) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Glycerol and magnesium nitrate were commercially supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China)."
3,Preparation of colloidal solutions and composite materials,"2.2 Preparation of colloidal solutions and composite materials The colloidal solutions of different agar: KGM: PVA ratios were prepared. The agar: KGM: PVA ratios in weight were 76:24:0 (A76K24), 73:24:3 (A73K24P3), 70:24:6 (A70K24P6), 67:24:9 (A67K24P9), 64:24:12 (A64K24P12), and 61:24:15 (A61K24P15). The letters “A”, “K” and “P” denote agar, KGM and PVA, respectively. A total of 5.6 g agar, KGM, and PVA with above ratios were weighed and then placed in a three-necked round-bottom flask (containing 0.56 g of glycerol plasticizer only for agar/KGM/PVA composite films) and 400 mL of distilled water; and the flask was kept at 95 °C with stirring at 800 rpm for 90 min. Consequently, the binary and ternary solutions could be obtained. The binary and ternary solutions (100 g) were poured into plastic plates with a radius of 15 cm and kept at room temperature (about 26 °C) to form gels, and the gels were dehydrated in an oven at 60 °C to acquire composite film materials. The films were peeled off from the plates and exposed to 54% relative humidity (RH) (saturated magnesium nitrate solution) at 25 °C until they reached equilibrium."
4,Rheological analysis for colloidal solutions,"2.3 Rheological analysis for colloidal solutions 2.3.1 Steady-state test An MCR92 rotary rheometer (Anton Paar GmbH, Austria) was used to inspect the rheological properties of the binary and ternary solutions. A rotating mode was used to show the steady-state rheological features with a tapered geometry (50 mm in diameter and 1° angle) and 0.1 mm gap. The test was carried out at 90 °C, and the shear rate was increased from 0.1 to 1000 s−1. The obtained viscosity curve was fitted using the Carreau model (Wang et al., 2018) to acquire the zero-shear viscosity (η 0). (1) η − η ∞ η 0 − η ∞ = 1 + λ γ ̇ 2 n − 1 2 In this equation, η 0(mPa·s) is the zero-shear viscosity; η ∞ (mPa·s) indicates the infinite shear viscosity; λ (s) means the relaxation time; n represents the shear thinning index. 2.3.2 Sol-gel transition temperature and temperature sweeps An oscillation mode was used to determine the sol-gel transition temperature for the binary and ternary solutions with a parallel plate geometry (diameter: 50 mm) and 1.0 mm gap. The temperature sweeps cooling from 90 °C to 25 °C with a cooling rate of 5 °C/min at 1.0% strain (within the linear viscoelastic region) were used to conduct the experiments. After the cooling, the temperature sweeps from 25 to 90 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min at 1.0% strain were carried out. 2.3.3 Frequency sweeps and applicability of Cox-Merz rule The samples were subjected to frequency sweeps from 0.1 to 100 rad/s at 25 °C. The strain was set at 1.0% (within the linear viscoelastic region). To check the applicability of the Cox–Merz rule for agar/KGM/PVA gels, their apparent viscosities were measured using the steady-shear mode with the shear rate increasing from 0.1 to 100 s−1 at 25 °C. 2.3.4 Thixotropy test A hybrid oscillation-rotation-oscillation mode was applied to explore the thixotropy of the samples with a three-segment time scan. The test was performed at 60 °C with a low-shear stage with a shear rate of 0.1 s−1 for 20 s at 1.0% strain, a high-shear stage with a shear rate of 1000s−1 for 60 s, and then a structural recovery stage with a shear rate of 0.1 s−1 for 120 s at 1.0% strain. The degree of structural recovery (DSR) of the sample at different recovery times was calculated using Eq. (2). (2) DSR = η t / η × 100 % Here, η t (mPa·s) is the viscosity in the structural recovery stage at a certain time (t); η (mPa·s) indicates the final viscosity of the first stage. The hysteresis loop test was carried out to measure the thixotropy data of the samples, which involved a linear shear rate increase from 0.1 to 100s−1 and then a linear decrease from 100 to 0.1 s−1. The area of the hysteresis loop was measured using the RheoCompass software. It is worth noting that the hysteresis loop tests must be considered as quality control tests, as they depend on the changing rate of shear rate and the maximum shear rate reached (Niknam, Ghanbarzadeh, Ayaseh, & Rezagholi, 2018)."
5,Structures and properties for composite films,"2.4 Structures and properties for composite films 2.4.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) A SEM system (JSM 6390LV, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used to observe the fracture surface of the composite films. The instrument was operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV (Acar & Kurt, 2020). Before observations, all the films were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then broken. The obtained fracture surfaces were coated with gold under vacuum for observations (Li et al., 2019). The fracture surface images were collected at 800 × magnification. 2.4.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The crystalline characteristics of the film materials were inspected using a D8 Advanced X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Baden-Wuertenberg, Germany). The instrument was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with a copper target (X-ray wavelength: 0.1547 nm), a graphite monochromator, and a scintillation counter detector. The XRD patterns were recorded over a 2θ range of 5° to 45° under 0.02° step size at a step rate of 0.5 s per step (Qiao et al., 2017). 2.4.3 Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) The ATR-FTIR spectra of the composite films were collected with a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Nicolet Smart Orbit ATR accessory. Before testing, the samples were cut into 2 cm × 2 cm and dried at 60 °C for 8 h. The data were recorded in a wavenumber range of 4000–600 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Total 32 scans were conducted at room temperature (about 26 °C). The air spectrum was used as the background data and subtracted from the film spectrum. And the data were subjected to base-line correction (Agarwal et al., 2013). 2.4.4 Mechanical properties Based on the ASTM–D–882–91 standard method (ASTM–D–882–91, 1991), the mechanical properties of the composite films were inspected using a Texture Analyzer (TA. XT Plus, Stable Microsystems, Surrey, UK). For the tests, the films were cut into 5 mm × 50 mm strips, and the thickness of the strips was measured using a spiral micrometer (Shanghai Liuling Instrument Company, Shanghai, China). Then, the strips were clamped between the texture analyzer fixtures to determine the tensile strength (σt) and elongation at break (ε b ). For measurements, an initial grip length was 50 mm and a cross-head speed was 0.5 mm/s. The values of σt (MPa) and ε b (%) were calculated with Eqs. (3) and (4) (Ortega-Toro, Muñoz, Talens, and Chiralt, 2016). (3) σ t = F T × W (4) ε b = L − L 0 / L 0 × 100 % In these equations, F (N) reflects the maximum force; T (cm) or W (cm) represents the thickness or the width of the film; L 0 (cm) means the original length of the film; L (cm) indicates the length after stretching. 2.4.5 Water and diiodomethane contact angle The air/liquid contact angles of water (H2O) and diiodomethane (CH2I2) on the surface of each composite film were determined, using a contact angle goniometer (OCA15EC, Dataphysics, Filderstadt, Germany) with the sessile-drop method. Each film was cut into strips and placed on the horizontal movable stage. A total of 3.0 μL of deionized water or 0.7 μL of CH2I2 was dropped on the surface of the film using a micro-syringe. The measurements were taken every 1 s to determine the equilibrium state of water or CH2I2 droplet on the film surface. For the samples, the contact angle of CH2I2 showed less significant alterations. The contact angle of water on agar/KGM composite films changed gradually as time rose due to the hydrophilicity nature of KGM-based films until the water droplet being absorbed by the films, and the water contact angle under the equilibrium of water droplet, film and air could not be obtained. Here, the contact angle of H2O or CH2I2 at the time point of 30 s was chosen to indicate the wettability of the films."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis The data obtained were expressed in the format of mean ± standard deviation. A statistical difference level was used at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS 23.0 (Chicago, USA)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Rheological features of colloidal solutions,"3.1 Rheological features of colloidal solutions 3.1.1 Steady rheological features The apparent viscosity curves for the colloidal solutions are shown in Fig. 1a. The viscosity of the solutions decreased gradually with the increment of shear rate (i.e., a shear-thinning behavior). That is, the molecular chains in the solutions underwent disentanglement and re-entanglement at the same time under shear force (Wang, Li, et al., 2021). As the shear stress rose, the chain re-entanglement rate failed to maintain pace with the rate of chain disentanglement (Li et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2021), which led to a gradual disruption of colloidal network and a reduction of viscosity. The viscosity profile of KGM was higher than that of agar, related to the relatively higher weight-average molar mass of KGM. The agar/KGM and agar/KGM/PVA solutions showed significantly higher viscosities than those of pure agar and KGM solutions. This was indicative of the presence of molecular entanglements between components in the binary and ternary colloidal solutions. The ternary solutions with low amounts of PVA (A73K24P3 and A70K24P6) displayed higher viscosity values, whereas the samples incorporated with increased PVA contents could exhibit comparative or lower viscosity values; this was associated with the molecular entanglement behaviors and intermolecular interactions (as detailed in the next paragraph). Thus, incorporating low contents of PVA (below 6%) allowed stronger chain re-entanglement under shearing for the agar/KGM/PVA solutions as compared to the agar/KGM counterpart. The zero-shear viscosities for the composite solutions are included in Fig. 1b. With the PVA content increased, the zero-shear viscosity rose firstly and then reduced, while the zero-shear viscosity for A70K24P6 reached the maximum. The PVA showed a propensity to be entangled and physically cross-linked with agar and KGM molecules due to its highly polar and solubility in water (Chiellini, Cinelli, Fernandes, Kenawy, & Lazzeri, 2001). This increased the hydrodynamic volume and contributed to increasing the viscosity for A73K24P3 and A70K24P6. And the highest zero-shear viscosity for A70K24P6 reflected that the entanglement and intermolecular interactions between the three components were the most intensive among the samples. Note that, under the high testing temperature (90 °C), the hydrophobic force in the system would increase and the hydrogen bonding became less important (Dickinson, 1998). Since the PVA contained repeated hydrophobic segments (-CH-CH2-) on its chains, a further increase in the PVA content enhanced the hydrophobic force in the agar/KGM/PVA solutions, which was preferential for the self-entanglement of PVA chains and reduced the entanglement between PVA and other components. Consistently, when the hydrophobic force between PVA chains was shielded using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), the chain entanglement of PVA with other components could be enhanced and thus the viscosities of the sample solutions were increased (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary data). Hence, relative to the solutions (such as A70K24P6) with low PVA contents, the solutions (e.g., A67K24P9) with more PVA showed a lower zero-shear viscosity (hydrodynamic volume) (Fig. 1b). 3.1.2 Sol-gel transition temperature and temperature sweeps The storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G"") curves of PVA and the composite solutions as a function of temperature are included in Fig. 2 . As the temperature decreased from 90 to 25 °C, the G' and G"" values showed negligible alterations for pure PVA solution, and increases for the binary and ternary solutions. In Fig. 2b, at the first stage, the G' and G"" values increased gradually with G' < G"", indicating liquid-like behaviors for the composite solutions; at the second stage, G' and G"" values increased dramatically with G' > G"", suggesting solid-like behaviors for the composite solutions. The change from the first to the second stage (crossover point of G' and G"") was related to the sol-gel transition for the composite solutions. During cooling, agar and PVA can form gels with a three-dimensional network. Agar changed from random coils to orderly arranged helices, followed by further aggregation to gel (Imeson, 2009). PVA molecules associated to form micro-crystallites that acted as cross-linking points and induced the formation of gel (Hyon, Cha, & Ikada, 1989). It is seen from the Fig. 1a that G' and G"" for PVA did not show a crossover point during cooling from 90 to 25 °C, suggesting that PVA molecules did not form gels during cooling. Thus, mainly agar molecules took part in the gel formation process of the composite colloidal solutions. The sol-gel transition temperatures for the samples were approximately 40 °C and summarized in Table S1 (Supplementary data) and Fig. 2b. The sol-gel transition temperature did not show significant difference as the PVA content increased (P>0.05). In this work, the content of agar became lower as the PVA content rose, which tended to weaken the aggregation probability of agar molecules to form helices and gel structures. It has been confirmed that the gelling temperature of agar solution depends on its concentration (Imeson, 2009; Labropoulos, Rangarajan, Niesz, & Danforth, 2001). But the interactions between PVA and agar could act as physical cross-linking points for gelation, and thus stabilize the sol-gel transition of agar/KGM systems containing PVA. After cooling, the temperature sweeps (heating from 25 to 90 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min) were carried out for the samples (Fig. 2c). As the temperature increased, the G' and G"" values showed no significant changes with G' > G"" at first, and then reduced remarkably until G' < G"". It can be seen that there were two shoulders in G' data, indicating that the agar/KGM/PVA gels underwent two relaxation processes during heating. The shoulder at temperatures of approximately 50 to 70 °C depended on the PVA content, and the temperature of this shoulder was reduced as the PVA content increased (reflecting the weakened thermal stability of gel). This could be associated with the relative reduction in the agar content, which allowed fewer agar molecules constructing the gel networks and a decrease in the gel thermal stability. The other shoulder was positioned at approximately 80 °C, which was ascribed to the melting of gels. The melting temperature for the gels during heating was different from the sol-gel transition temperature during cooling. This difference was known as gelling hysteresis, and was related to the presence of agarobioses originally in the agarophyte seaweed from where the agar is extracted (Armisén & Gaiatas, 2009). Such gelling hysteresis was also found for other hydrocolloids such as κ-carrageenan (Imeson, 2009). 3.1.3 Frequency sweeps and applicability of Cox-Merz rule The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) data for the samples, and their complex viscosity (η ⁎) and apparent viscosity (η) data are displayed in Fig. 3 . The agar/KGM/PVA gels showed dominantly elastic features (G' > G""). For an ideal gel with elastic features, the G′ value is expected to be independent of frequency. As indicated in Fig. 3a, the G′ values were independency of frequency in the range of 0.1 to 100 rad/s for agar/KGM/PVA gels (except A61K24P15), indicative of a typical stiff gel behavior. Since the G′ value of a composite gel can be used to reflect its strength, the gel strength values for the agar/KGM/PVA gels were in an order of A76K24 > A73K24P3 > A70K24P6 > A67K24P9 > A64K24P12 > A61K24P15 (Fig. 3a). In such composite gels, the agar molecules mainly contributed to the gelation of composite colloidal solutions, while PVA and KGM molecules could interpenetrate into the agar network and physically crosslinked with each other through hydrogen bonding. The gel strength was mainly related to the agar network rather than physical crosslinking of molecules. As the PVA content rose, the reduced content of agar allowed a reduced gel strength, though stronger molecular entanglements emerged for A73K24P3 and A70K24P6 than for A76K24. The complex viscosities (η ⁎) of the samples were superimposed on the apparent viscosities (η) obtained from steady shear tests to check the Cox-Merz rule. The Cox-Merz rule can be used to predict the viscosity at a high shear rate region based on oscillatory strain measurements, when it is difficult to measure the viscosity due to different factors (sample fracture, secondary flow, etc.) (Snijkers & Vlassopoulos, 2014); this rule is well known to be applicable to the molecular structures of flexible polymers. In Fig. 3b, the agar/KGM/PVA composite gels did not obey the Cox-Merz rule (as indicated by the fact of η ⁎ > η), indicating that the gel structures were more intact under low amplitude oscillation than those under steady shear. 3.1.4 Thixotropic property The three-interval thixotropy curves, the degree of structural recovery (DSR) of the colloidal solutions and the hysteresis area (the area between upward and downward flow behavior curves) are displayed in Fig. 4 . It is known that DSR < 100% indicates a thixotropic behavior, while DSR > 100% suggests an anti-thixotropic behavior. For a thixotropic material, a higher DSR value means a weaker thixotropic behavior (higher shear-resistance) (Wang, Yu, Sun, & Xie, 2021). The binary and ternary solutions showed lower viscosities at the third stage than those at the first stage, whereas an opposite trend was seed for the PVA solution. The DSR values from the three-interval thixotropic test for the samples are depicted in Fig. 4b. The DSR for PVA solution was larger than 100% (i.e., anti-thixotropic), since PVA molecules could conduce to form a more stable structure during high-rate shearing at the second stage (Wang, Li, Wang, & Özkan, 2010). For the composite solutions, the DSR values were lower than 100% (i.e., thixotropic) and DSR values increased as the recovery time increased from 20 to 120 s. At the same recovery time, DSR values increased firstly and decreased afterward with the PVA content rose. As shown in Fig. 4c, the hysteresis loop area decreased firstly and then increased with the PVA content increasing. These results indicate that the recovery ability of agar/KGM/PVA samples increased firstly and decreased afterward as the PVA content rose, being similar with that changing trend of zero-shear viscosity. This implies that the enhancement of chain entanglement propensity (reflected by viscosity) could strengthen the recovery ability of the destroyed structure (by external shear), related to enhanced rigidity of molecular segments and shortened segment relaxation time."
9,Microstructure and properties for composite film materials,"3.2 Microstructure and properties for composite film materials 3.2.1 Fracture surface morphology The cross-section surface images for the film materials are presented in Fig. 5 . The fracture surfaces for the samples were smooth and condense without visible crack and phase separation. This revealed continuous structural matrices of the film materials on the macron scale. An increase in the PVA content negligibly affects the morphological features of the fracture surface. That is, the incorporated PVA component was properly compatible with the agar and KGM due to the presence of -OH. Consistently, the components such as agar could show compatibility with other biopolymers such as κ-carrageenan, through intermolecular hydrogen bonding between different components (Rhim, 2012). 3.2.2 Crystalline structure The XRD patterns of the film materials are shown in Fig. 6 . The PVA film had a relatively sharp diffraction peak at 2θ angle of ca. 19.7°, indicating the presence of crystalline components. The binary composite material (A76K24) exhibited two diffraction peaks at around 13.4° and 19.7°, attributed to the aggregation of agar molecules during the film-forming (Freile-Pelegrín et al., 2007). It is seen that the intensity of peak at around 13.4° first decreased and then increased as the PVA content increased (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary data). The composite films (A73K24P3 and A70K24P6) with low PVA contents displayed reduced intensities of the peaks especially at about 13.4°. This was related to the fact that low contents (6% or lower) of PVA could sufficiently interact with the agar and KGM chains (shown by enhanced chain entanglements in Section 3.1), and eventually suppressed the self-organization of agar molecules into crystallites. While adding more PVA, the intensity of peak at 13.4° showed an increase for A67K24P9, A64K24P12, and A61K24P15. This confirmed more crystalline materials from aggregation of agar molecules. From rheological results above, such high amounts of PVA chains tended to undergo self-entanglement and exhibited weakened interactions (entanglement) with agar and KGM. This was beneficial for the assembly of agar molecules into helices and crystallites during the film-forming process. 3.2.3 ATR-FTIR analysis The ATR-FTIR spectra of the films are displayed in Fig. 7 . The binary film material (A76K24) exhibited a broad absorption at ca. 3317 and 2885 cm−1, ascribed to the stretching of -OH group and CH group of agar and KGM. The peak at 1635 cm−1 was related to the existence of water molecules, and a similar phenomenon was found for other polysaccharides such as chitosan and curdlan (Jin, Zhang, Yin, & Nishinari, 2006; Sun et al., 2011). The peak at 1370 cm−1 was due to the presence of the ester sulfate group on agar, while the peaks at 889 and 770 cm−1 were related to the mannose in KGM (Qiao et al., 2019). For PVA, the bands at 3278 and 2917 cm−1 were referred to the stretching of -OH group and CH from alkyl groups, respectively. The band at 1733 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching of CO and CO from the acetate group of PVA. The bands at 917 and 847 cm−1 were linked to the vibration of backbone CC (Pereira, de Arruda, & Stefani, 2015). The agar/KGM/PVA composite films showed the above characteristic peaks, and no new peaks appeared on the spectra, indicative of negligibly changed chemical structures of the component molecules in the films. The diffraction intensity of the peaks in the range of 4000–2300 cm−1 for the composite films were normalized to [0,1], and the obtained spectra were depicted in the Fig. S2 in Supplementary data. The width of peak related to stretching of -OH did not change remarkably as the PVA content rose. Theoretically, the absorption band for the free -OH group emerges at about 3600 cm−1, and while involved in the formation of hydrogen bond, its absorption band shifts to a lower frequency (Elizondo, Sobral, & Menegalli, 2009). Besides, if the hydrogen bond becomes stronger, the stretching band for -OH will occur at a lower frequency (Wang, Ren, Li, Sun, & Liu, 2014). With PVA incorporation, the -OH absorption peak shifted to a lower frequency especially for A67K24P9, A64K24P12, and A61K24P15, indicating the enhancement of hydrogen bonding in the films. Such three films showed relatively strong peaks related to mainly agar crystallites containing hydrogen bonds. Hence, when the PVA content was 9% or above, the PVA chains exhibited the propensity of self-entanglement; this weakened the entanglement between PVA and agar (reflected by the lower zero-shear viscosity), and enhanced the aggregation of agar molecules into crystallites with hydrogen bonds. On the contrary, the -OH peak for A70K24P6 shifted to a higher frequency, as the stronger chain entanglements between components suppressed the chain organization into ordered structures rich in hydrogen bonds. 3.2.4 Mechanical features The tensile strength and elongation at break for the film materials are included in Fig. 8 . Relative to the binary film, the PVA inclusion resulted in increased tensile strengths for A73K24P3 (insignificant) and A70K24P6, accompanied by comparative values for A67K24P9, A64K24P12, and A61K24P15. Meanwhile, the PVA inclusion significantly increased the elongation at break for A73K24P3, A70K24P6 and A67K24P9, but unchanged this parameter for A64K24P12 and A61K24P15. These results indicate that the composite film (A70K24P6) with low content of PVA displayed simultaneous increases in the tensile strength and the elongation at break. Typically, the presence of crystallites in the film matrices hinders the migration of molecules, thus leading to an increased tensile strength but a reduced elongation at break (Liu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018). Since A70K24P6 contained fewer crystallites, its crystalline structure would not be the main factor governing the tensile strength and elongation at break. It can be suggested that the stronger chain entanglements/ interactions (shown by viscosity and film crystallites) for A70K24P6 played dominant roles in increasing the film matrix rigidity and matrix connections (tensile strength and elongation). 3.2.5 Water and diiodomethane contact angle The water (H2O) or diiodomethane (CH2Cl2) contact angles for the film materials are summarized in Table 1 . These two contact angles are important parameters that reflect the wettability of the film surface. In general, a more hydrophobic surface shows a larger H2O contact angle and a smaller CH2Cl2 contact angle. From the results, the binary film (A76K24) showed a H2O contact angle of ca. 72.7° and a CH2Cl2 contact angle of ca. 70.8°; the inclusion of PVA increased the H2O contact angle but reduced the CH2Cl2 contact angle; such effects were the most significant for A70K24P6 and became less prominent with the further increased PVA content. This information revealed that including a relatively low amount of PVA (such as 6%) led to ternary film material with apparently enhanced hydrophobicity. Accounting for this, the occurrence of intense chain entanglements (interactions) between components under low PVA content could weaken the possible interactions between the film surface components and the water. This should be the main determiner for the enhanced hydrophobicity of A70K24P6, as its reduced crystallinity and the inclusion of more PVA with hydrophobic segments did not dominantly affect the film hydrophobicity."
10,Conclusions,"This work has confirmed that the inclusion of PVA could simultaneously improve the sol-gel, mechanical and hydrophobic features of agar/KGM system. Specifically, while PVA addition stabilized the sol-gel transition point of resulted agar/KGM/PVA solutions, the inclusion of low amounts of PVA (especially 6% for A70K24P6) could enhance the chain entanglements of the components (reflected by increased zero-shear viscosity). The zero-shear viscosity for A70K24P6 solution was about 1.5 times that for A76K24 counterpart. Such enhanced chain entanglements not only increased the degree of structural recovery for A70K24P6 solution, but also led to reduced crystallites as well as simultaneously increased tensile strength, elongation at break and hydrophobicity for the related film (A70K24P6). The A70K24P6 film showed a tensile strength of ca. 105 MPa, an elongation at break of ca. 20%, and a water contact angle of ca. 97.6°. In addition, the PVA inclusion negligibly affected the morphology of film fracture surface. These results indicate that incorporating proper amounts of PVA could be an approach to design the ternary agar/KGM/PVA system with optimized practical performance."
