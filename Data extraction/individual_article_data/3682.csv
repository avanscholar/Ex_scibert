0,Introduction,"Many parts of the world have become more affluent during the last century or more. However, this has been accompanied with a large growth in energy consumption as well as huge/great dependency on fossil fuels. This of course has led to a lot of serious problems which are mainly associated with our life. Two of these most serious problems faced nowadays due to the extensive use and high dependence on the fossil fuel as a main source for energy are global warming and environmental pollution. This is of course because of the pollutants resulted from its combustion which usually produces greenhouse and toxic gases, such as SO2, NOx which in turn take part directly in causing the global warming [1,2]. Hydrocarbons such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil derived from fossil fuels are currently in common use. However, strict and rigorously implemented environmental protection will eventually require that fossil energy sources, which are considered to be responsible for the deterioration of air quality and the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, should no longer be exploited or combusted. Therefore, in future sustainable energy systems it will be necessary to switch to other energy carriers which are convenient, clean, safe, efficient and versatile [3–5]. A new drive for research in alternative fuels came as a response to the increasing concerns towards global warming and environmental pollution [6]. Increased awareness of the global warming trend has led to worldwide concerns regarding greenhouse emissions [7]. Finding other energy resources as alternatives to the fossil fuel becomes urgent. These days the world is bound to make a gradual shift from the hydrocarbon economy towards the hydrogen and renewable ones [8]. Hydrogen production has been extensively studied in the last two decades as a key element of the energy matrix. Hydrogen is industrially obtained from the steam reforming of natural gas or heavier hydrocarbons [9]. Hydrogen can be converted into electricity at a relatively high efficiency and may easily be stored in large quantities. These properties allow an increased number of intermittent renewable energy sources to be integrated into the power generation mix [10,11]. Hydrogen-based energy technology has certain attractions in combating the environmental crises namely pollution and global warming. The shift from oil to hydrogen as a response for these crises will be facilitated and achieved as a result of the continuous development in the hydrogen energy technology that is occurring all over the world. Hydrogen has become a viable compound and attracted much attention these days as a clean energy carrier due to its huge energy content. Nevertheless, the hydrogen-based energy can receive greater interest and importance when it is combined with low production cost via an efficient process that can yield high level of hydrogen. In line with this scope, several investigations and studies were done over the last few decades by many researchers using several technologies as well various kinds of materials [12–18]. A number of studies have been directed toward the manufacturing of defect free and highly active catalysts for the hydrogen production. Several techniques have been used during these studies to achieve this goal. Of these methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and electroless deposition (ELP) have been considered as the most promising; however the electroless one is more preferred. It exhibits many advantages as it provides thin metal and metal alloy films that have excellent adhesion properties, high deposition and easily controlled rate and does not require expensive setup [19]. The continuous growing of hydrogen demand in the recent years has motivated the research into improving methods for hydrogen production, separation and purification [20,21]. Hydrogen is commonly used in many catalytic and energy production applications. It is also commercially used in both petroleum and chemical processes for hydro-desulfurization and production of syngas, ammonia, methanol and higher alcohols [22–24]. Different templates, over the last few decades, have been used as supports for hydrogen selective catalysts such as alumina, iron oxides and zeolite, however certain problems regarding the hydrogen flux and chemical stability were addressed [25]. Novel catalysts via the combination of nickel alloy particles and carbon fiber to over come these problems is introduced through this research work. Hydrogen is widely considered to be one of the most promising, alternative energy carriers and clean fuels. Hence, much research has focused on the development of efficient, low cost and environmental friendly methods for hydrogen production [26]. Among the many hydrogen production reactions, the catalytic decomposition of methane (CDM) over catalysts has generated much interest [27]. The hydrogen production from several sources in general and using methane via decomposition in particular had been investigated over the last few decades. Methane could be counted as one of the simplest hydrogen containing The methane conversion to hydrogen technology is based on the catalytic breaking of C–H bond in order to release hydrogen and get in-situ carbon materials; usually CNTs [28,29]. The methane decomposition reaction is a moderately endothermic reaction which is thermodynamically favored at higher temperature. (1) CH4→C+2H2, _H 298°=75.6kJ/mol CDM is a green route to produce hydrogen with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or carbon nanofibres (CNFs) as the only side product. This will eliminate the need for CO x separation and sequestration processes altogether. It was found that transition 3d-metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) show considerable catalytic activity towards dissociation of hydrocarbon. On one hand, their non-filled 3d-orbitals can accept electrons from hydrocarbon molecules which facilitate the dissociation. On the other hand, the overlap of non-filled 3d-orbitals with carbon orbital will not only favor the hydrocarbon dissociation process but will also play an important role in the initial stage of the CNTs or CNFs growth. In general, for CDM reactions, Ni-based catalysts are more active than Co-based and Fe-based catalysts in the temperature range 500–700°C. Therefore, supported metallic nickel catalysts for CDM have attracted much attention [30–42]. There is a consensus in the literature that the catalyst performance in CDM is highly dependent on the crystallite size of the catalyst particles. Larger crystallite or particle size would render the catalyst to be deactivated rapidly. Normally, support materials such as Al2O3, SiO2 and MgO are used to control the catalyst particles size and their dispersion either by physical interactions (porous support) or chemical interaction (charge transfer effect) [31]. In the present work, the application of nano-structured nickel–boron particles as catalysts for methane decomposition is reported. These Ni alloy particles were used as supported CDM catalysts and their structural and morphological properties were also studied."
1,Experimental work,"In the present work, intensified hydrogen-selective nickel and palladium alloy based catalysts supported on carbon fiber and zirconia, respectively, were manufactured using electroless plating. Maintaining the simplicity in fabrication, operation and achieving good chemical stability while producing a high level of hydrogen yield are the main aims at this work."
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Carbon based template where its characteristics and specifications are next detailed was used as the catalyst support. The intensified nickel based catalyst was then obtained by loading a high percent of the metal through a nickel alloy deposition process that was conducted via the electroless plating technique. The deposition process provided a nano-structured surface layer as well as nano-particles of nickel through the bulk of the support layer. 2.1.1 Carbon felt The carbon felts are commercially available carbonized felts processed from a rayon precursor and fired to graphitizing temperatures. As one of carbon felt distinctive characteristics, it does not deteriorate at high temperatures and therefore has excellent features and superior thermal properties over a wide range of high operating temperatures applications. Some other properties of felt had cultivated its utilization as a catalyst support which are: flexible and easy to handle, low density and thermal mass, uniformity throughout the material, easily cut to fit specific size requirements and good chemical resistance where it does not wick. On the other hand, it also has some disadvantages, which are: compressive strength is lower than tensile strength, poor impact strength of composites, and oxidizes in air at temperatures above 450°C. 2.1.1.1 Specifications Carbon based material with a melting point of 1000°C and 5mm thickness. The felt was used through the catalyst preparation procedure as circular disks 25.5mm in diameter weighed up 0.23g/disk and has an average pore size of 60μm."
3,Preparation procedure,2.2 Preparation procedure The novel catalysts revealed through this study were prepared via depositing nickel–boron alloy particles using the electroless coating. The preparation procedures started by cutting the carbon felt sheet into circular shaped disks with a diameter of 25.5mm. The obtained circular disks were then subjected to nickel deposition using the deposition cell that is previously described by El Naggar and his co-worker [43–45].
4,Processing conditions and flow sequence,"2.3 Processing conditions and flow sequence The plating flow sequence and the processing conditions of the electroless plating which are applied through this study are similar to what is given formerly by [43,44]. Briefly the deposition process was carried out at a temperature of 50°C and 2mL/min flow rate of the deposition solution. First the metal bath solution was prepared and then pumped into the deposition cell using a syringe driver at the above given rate. The temperature of the carbon felt was raised to 50±5°C in order to cause the metal deposition at both the surface of support layer and within its pores. This deposition stage was then followed by a washing step using hot water. After each time washing, the deposition flow direction was reversed in order to obtain uniform deposition on both sides of the support. The catalyst, obtained at the end of electroless deposition process, was then subjected to thermal treatment at 800°C using a vacuum furnace at a ramping rate of 5°C/min followed by a gradual cooling."
5,Binary alloy fabrication,"2.4 Binary alloy fabrication The typical electroless plating bath components, for co-deposition of boron alongside nickel particles, are: a source of nickel and reducing agent to supply the electrons for nickel reduction, complexing agent to control free nickel and buffering agent to control the pH. In these experiments both nickel chloride (for catalyst A) and nickel sulfate (for catalyst B) were used as the nickel source with the utilization of diethyl amine boron complex as a reducing agent. Sodium dodecyl and sodium acetate were used as pH stabilizer and complexing agent, respectively. All the chemical reagents used through the electroless plating process were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, England – UK."
6,Catalytic activity: test of methane-to-hydrogen conversion,"2.5 Catalytic activity: test of methane-to-hydrogen conversion The production of CO/CO2-free hydrogen via catalytic decomposition of natural gas was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a quartz horizontal fixed-bed reactor; length and diameter of the reactor were 100 and 1.50cm, respectively. The configuration of the full inner components with their setup inside the testing reactor before testing is detailed below in Fig. 1a. The catalyst performance test was done using the testing system shown schematically in Fig. 1b. All experiments were performed in the following manner. Before entering the reactor into the furnace, 0.5g of the catalyst, Ni–B alloy based catalysts, prepared through this work was charged in the middle part of the reactor tube. The temperature was then set up to a maximum value of 700°C. In practice, once the testing system fully set up, the reactor was heated up from room temperature to the required temperature with a ramping rate of 10°C/min. The reactor was kept at this temperature for a dwell time of 1h to get the catalyst at a high level of activity for executing the reaction. High purity methane (99.995%) was then introduced into the quartz tube for a reaction time on stream from ~0 up to 8h. The catalyst was eventually cooled down after the processing time to 250°C under nitrogen. The flow rate of methane and nitrogen was set to 50sccm/min (standard cubic centimeter per minute). The produced gas, was afterwards received into an online gas chromatograph [PerkinElmer׳s Clarus 600 Gas Chromatograph-USA, equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID)] to indentify the gas components and to determine their concentrations. No gaseous products other than the hydrogen and the un-reacted methane were detected using this system. The selectivity of the catalysts towards the production of hydrogen was then determined by using calibrated data via the GC software. The methane catalytic decomposition process usually produces hydrogen and carbon species. The carbon particles are always accumulated on the catalyst surface. In order to characterize the obtained carbon through this study, the spent catalyst was discharged from the reactor and was then forwarded for analysis to categorize the type of the acquired carbon deposits. Two tools of analyzes namely Raman spectroscopy and the total carbon content were utilized in order to identify the carbon particles and quantify their amounts respectively."
7,Results and discussion,"Nowadays, some nickel and nickel-alloy are used as catalysts for hydrogen production via natural gas decomposition but they suffer from serious drawbacks including low hydrogen yield, thermal instability and chemical limitations due to the catalyst deactivation. In order to overcome these drawbacks and to enhance hydrogen production for practical applications, we have developed this ‘intensified nano-structured’ macro-porous composite catalysts where the ‘nickel-alloy particles’ were introduced at both the support surface and its inner structure."
8,Support layer analysis,"3.1 Support layer analysis In terms of high thermal and chemical stability, carbon felt was found to be a good template for the preparation of high temperature methane decomposition catalysts. The general appearance and surface morphology of raw carbon felt as received has been detected through SEM images as shown in Fig. 2. The region that was illustrated with a square on the picture was magnified to show the fiber properties. The carbon felt had a uniform fiber diameter of 15µm with highly porous structure, which was large enough for the metal solutions to flow easily through it during the plating process."
9,Structure of the intensified catalyst A,"3.2 Structure of the intensified catalyst A The structure formation of the intensified catalyst prepared through this work was examined by using both SEM and XRD. The metalized carbon felt produced by applying the conditions mentioned in Section 2.3 exhibited good physical characteristics as inspected. Catalysts of 2mm total thickness were produced through this process. The SEM images of the metalized carbon felt show uniform smooth nickel alloy deposits on both the inner interface and at the cross section of carbon felt as shown in Fig. 3. High surface area as well as high catalytic accessibility has been expected due to the formation of porous nickel–boron deposits of 5µm thickness on the carbon felt strands. The image focusing on the fiber details has shown the formation of nickel grains sized 2μm and less. Different morphology of the nickel–boron alloy deposits on carbon felt after thermal treatment has been detected as illustrated through SEM images shown in Fig. 4. This morphology change may be attributed to the fusion of nickel particles which were then bonded together and a subsequent re-crystallization without a crystal growth took place. The images showed the formation of a smooth uniform layer of nickel alloy with a thickness of less than 5µm along the carbon felt strand surface as well as at the interconnecting walls of the fiber. Some cracks in the metal film deposited can also be detected through the displayed (arrowed) image. Although the appearance of these cracks is undesirable, it may help in a physical increasing of the catalyst surface area; since a bigger area is exposed to the reaction, and hence enhancing its catalytic activity. This crack formation might be explained as a result of the thermal treatment step which was followed by a gradual cooling stage. The cooling stage might at some points affect the quality of crystals formation while the grains are coagulating together. The sizes of the nickel particles which were formed after the treatments had been reduced to become in the range between ca 1μm and few hundred nanometers. The noticed reduction of the sizes of metal particles is in fact against the normal trend of the thermal curing of metal deposits in which the ultimate sizes of the particles increase. This can be explained due to the impact of the gradual heating and the subsequent cooling during the thermal processing stage which in turn gets the crystal growth avoided; hence small metal particles were obtained. 3.2.1 EDX spectrum at the catalyst surface The EDX spectrum of the catalyst surface has been illustrated in Fig. 5. The given spectrum details the individual components as detected along the surface. Two strong peaks of the nickel metal have been noticed which reflects the domination of the nickel at the surface structure; as a result of the plating process during the catalyst preparation procedures. According to the calculations which were given by the EDX analysis, 74wt% of the main components along the catalyst structure was nickel, as detected. In relevance to the SEM images which were conducted at both the catalyst interfacial surface and the cross section, the EDX results can demonstrate the formation of intensified catalysts. This obviously is owing to the high percentages of the nickel deposits as well as the uniform dispersion and distribution of the nickel particles within the whole support structure. 3.2.2 XRD analysis for the metalized carbon felt Fig. 6 exhibits the X-ray diffraction spectrum of the Ni-alloy coated carbon felt before and after the thermal curing process. Before heat treatment, XRD pattern indicates one low intensity broad peak at 44.5° due to nickel deposition. The broad and low intense peak exhibited, reflects the highly amorphous structure of the nickel particles formed after the electroless deposition. This amorphous structure of the nickel can be referred to the influence of the support, carbon felt, which has an amorphous nature. The thermal treatment of the metalized carbon felt has shown different nickel particles structure, as given in Fig. 6b. The XRD spectrum shows high intensity peaks of nickel, reflecting the domination of nickel as the main constituents through the sample after being thermally treated at high temperature. Additionally, the Ni metal particles structure appears to be shifted from amorphous into crystalline structure. This of course is due to the fusion of the non-uniformly distributed large grains of nickel alloy produced on the felt surface into smaller uniform particles at high temperature and finally its agglomeration to form porous film of nickel metal."
10,Structure of the intensified catalyst B,"3.3 Structure of the intensified catalyst B The structure of hydrogen selective catalyst supported on nickel–boron alloy metalized carbon felt, using nickel sulfate as a nickel source at a temperature of 50°C with no thermal treatment is shown in Fig. 7. The SEM shows smooth, non-uniform, nickel alloy deposits along the surface. At higher magnifications, some cracks at the carbon felt strand and the interconnecting walls were detected. At a magnification of five thousands time, as shown in Fig. 7b, nickel film with a thickness of less than 4μm has been detected. It can also be seen that smaller grains of nickel, compared to the case of using nickel chloride, has been formed before any thermal treatment. The reason for that may be due to the utilization of nickel sulfate, where the nickel particles have been stressed to a smaller size due to the high negativities of the sulfur and oxygen anions, unlike in the case of nickel chloride. An investigation on the effect of the nickel source on the size of the obtained metal grains through the electroless plating was reported in 2011 by El Naggar [2]. In El Naggar׳s study it was concluded that the produced metal particles are strongly dependent to the surrounding negative charges to the metal in the metal salt. Therefore, the higher the electron negativity of the anionic group attached to the metal the smaller are the acquired metal deposits ultimately. For example, nickel sulfate solution produces smaller nickel particles than that of the nickel nitrate, at the same conditions, while both of them produce smaller ones than the nickel chloride. After the nickel plated carbon felt vacuously treated at 800°C, an obvious change in the nickel deposits structure was detected as shown by the SEM images given in Fig. 8. A better morphology at the surface of the nickel plated carbon felt has been obtained in terms of the smooth uniform layer of nickel formed. This smooth layer formation is obviously due to the heat fusion of nickel particles at elevated temperature into smaller particles followed by a uniform bonding of these particles together. 3.3.1 Catalyst (B) XRD analysis The structure of metalized carbon felt using nickel–boron alloy at a temperature of 50°C has been discussed through Fig. 9. XRD spectrum has shown one strong broad peak of nickel metal. The strong peak indicates the high concentration and highly dominating structure of nickel deposits produced during the plating process at the support surface. Compared to Ni–B alloy which uses nickel chloride as a nickel source, the alloy based on nickel sulfate has shown less nickel crystalline formation, as discussed from the XRD spectrums of both structures. Different crystalline structure of the metalized carbon felt has been noticed due to the thermal treatment process, as given in Fig. 9b. The XRD spectrum indicates 2 sharp high intensity peaks at 44.5 o and 52 o 2θ values are due to nickel only. This reflects the domination of nickel as the main constituents through the sample after being thermally treated at high temperature. It also shows the Ni metal particles structure shift from amorphous into crystalline structure. This of course is due to the fusion of large grains of the film produced on the felt surface into smaller particles at high temperature and finally its agglomeration to form a nano-structured film layer."
11,Hydrogen flux (evaluation of the catalytic activity),"3.4 Hydrogen flux (evaluation of the catalytic activity) Before testing the catalysts prepared through this study, the activity of a commercial catalyst (Pd–Ag dense sheet) towards the hydrogen production via methane catalytic decomposition was tested. The sheet has a chemical composition of Pd 77% to Ag 23% by weight, full specifications of this catalyst are reported by [34], and was purchased from GoodFellow Ltd – UK. Owing to the palladium and palladium alloys high affinity towards hydrogen and due to its high chemical stability against deactivation, Pd–Ag sheet; as a hydrogen producer, was selected in order to compare its activity against the prepared catalysts ones. Both catalysts either using nickel chloride or nickel sulfate, as a nickel source, activity was then studied. The effect of the process retention time versus the hydrogen production was investigated as discussed below in Fig. 10. Promising results were obtained either using catalyst A or B. Both catalysts (A and B) showed good activity towards methane decomposition into hydrogen, however a higher hydrogen concentration was observed in case of the nickel chloride based catalyst, catalyst A, according to Fig. 10. The data given through the displayed figure showed that the methane reduction performance for both catalysts is time dependent. Nevertheless a significant hydrogen flux was obtained by catalyst (A) in comparison to catalyst (B) at certain retention times. This can be referred to the structure and particles size differences between both catalysts, and consequently different surface activity is expected. In practical, a better hydrogen yield was attained by catalyst (A) during all the testing times. For example, catalyst (A) yielded about 20% of pure hydrogen at a testing time of 250min while it was only 9% in case of catalyst (B). The overall hydrogen production of catalyst (A) and (B) was approximately 40% and 12%, respectively. As it was given from the GC analysis, only hydrogen gas was produced by both catalysts and no other components apart from hydrogen and the un-reacted methane were detected. On the other hand, a very weak activity of the Pd–Ag sheet towards methane decomposition into hydrogen was attained. This might be explained due to the change of the foil properties and its quick deactivation through the methane decomposing process. The properties of the Pd-sheet based catalyst can vary in case either by crack formation or due to blocking of the effective area by the adsorption of other components than the hydrogen. In comparison to the palladium–silver based sheet, both catalysts heavily scored in terms of the obtained hydrogen concentrations. Particularly, catalyst (B) produced twice the hydrogen yield compared to Pd based foil at the end of reaction time. In line with, catalyst (A) heavily scored against the palladium based catalyst where 6 fold of hydrogen concentration was obtained by catalyst A at the end of similar experimental conditions. In other words, the process intensification (PI) principles were clearly achieved through the current study, whereas the hydrogen flux obtained by both the prepared catalysts was significantly high in comparison to the Pd–Ag catalyst. This consequently reflects the PI philosophy in terms of applying similar conditions and a better product is attained. The enhancement in hydrogen concentrations produced using the catalysts developed through this work can be explained due to the presence of nickel metal particles at both surface layer as well as in the bulk of the support. Nickel metal has been the best choice for hydrogen dissociation as reported by Pozzo and Alfe in 2009. In their investigation on the dissociation of hydrogen molecule and the diffusion of atomic H into the bulk of transition metals, the nickel metal, and to some extent palladium, has shown exceptions in terms of combining both low dissociation barriers and the excellent diffusion of the atomic hydrogen in the their bulk. In line with Pozzo and Alfe, alloying Ni with other metals can appreciably increase the hydrogen selectivity and resulted in high catalytic performance, Singh et al., reported [46,47]. Also compared to nickel based catalysts available from the literature, catalyst (A) produced through this work, showed significant performance. In 2013, Lua and Wang prepared an unsupported Ni–Cu based catalyst for methane decomposition. They reported that their catalyst showed an 85% methane conversion at 700°C and testing time of 400min with a production of 7mmol/min of hydrogen [48]. For catalyst (A), prepared through this study, at the same testing conditions, a 65% of methane conversion was detected and a hydrogen production of 4.06mmol/min was obtained. Unlike the catalyst prepared by Lua and his co-worker, catalyst (A) revealed through this work showed continuous increase in [H2] to the reaction end, while their catalyst displayed an increased activity up to 175min then a hydrogen flux decline was observed. Some studies, as next stated, were done on the methane catalytic decomposition using several nickel catalysts however at higher flow rate of methane and longer experimental time than what was used in the current study. In 2006, Li and his co-workers reported the synthesis of different nickel oxide based catalysts. These catalysts were precipitated in ethylene glycol (EG) solution at different temperatures. The produced catalysts had shown good catalytic methane decomposition activity. In particular, NiO-EG-353 sample exhibited pronounced catalytic activity for methane decomposition with 60h of time on stream, with accumulated carbon and hydrogen yields of 271gC/gNi and 2651molH2/molNi, respectively. The NiO-EG-393 showed carbon and hydrogen yields approached 398gC/gNi and 3894molH2/molNi over 72h. However, the NiO-EG-433 sample gave only marginal methane conversions for about 5h, and the accumulated carbon and hydrogen yields were calculated as 3.4gC/gNi and 33molH2/molNi [49]. Another investigation on the methane decomposition into hydrogen and carbon nanofibers was carried out over Ni/SiO2, Takenaka et al. reported. In their study, it was reported that the catalytic activity of Ni/SiO2 decreased with time on stream and finally the catalyst was deactivated completely. The catalytic activity and the yields of hydrogen and carbon nanofibers until complete deactivation of the catalysts depended strongly on the loading amount of Ni. The yield of carbon nanofibers reached the maximum (491gC/gNi) for Ni (40wt%)/SiO2, at 80h of testing [50]. In 2003, Villacampa and his co-authors reported the activity of Ni (30%)/Al2O3 catalyst during the catalytic decomposition of methane. In this study it was stated that the carbon formation was rapidly growing until a maximum was reached. This was followed by a decrease in the carbon formation rate until a residual constant value was detected [51]. The initial period, immediately before the period of rapid carbon growth, is usually called the “induction period”. This induction period has been ascribed to a stage of filament nucleation and its extent depends on the operating conditions [52–54]. In conclusion, although the natural gas can be used directly as an energy source, its combustion always produces un-neutral CO2 emissions which might contribute seriously in the global warming problem. Furthermore the usage of the natural gas for the energy production usually requires several stages of treatments and purification in order to improve its calorific value as well as to minimize the attached harmful emissions that might be generated during its combustion. So, the presented work in can introduce an efficient route to produce a cleaner energy source via the conversion of the as-acquired natural gas from reservoirs, without further treatment, into hydrogen. The energy content that could be obtained by the H2 is much higher than the corresponding amount of the natural gas. Moreover, the hydrogen combustion produces no harmful emissions since that the water vapor is just the component to be produced out. 3.4.1 Catalysts sustainability From the economic point of view, the longer the time a catalyst lasts with no defects, failure or deactivation to take place, the lower is the manufacturing costs; hence the material will be economically cost effective for industrial application purposes. Both catalysts A and B however showed different performances, they both showed good sustainability in terms of the continuous growth in the hydrogen concentrations obtained along 400min of testing. In practical, both catalysts started with a low hydrogen flux while it was then increasing till the reaction stopped. This obviously reflects that both catalysts maintained their chemical activity till the end however, a further study is needed later on to accurately determine their end point of sustainability. The progressive hydrogen productivity that had been exhibited by both catalysts A and B could be probably referred to their morphological structures changes during the operation of the decomposition process. Nevertheless, these changes had not influenced their chemical stability during the interaction; hence no failure or deactivation was noticed over about 7h of running. These morphological changes had been highly likely relevant to the change of the sizes of the nickel particles in both catalysts A and B. In practical, the two catalysts had probably encountered a sintering stage during the methane decomposition process due to the effect of the high operational temperature; 700 oC, for a long time of running. This in turn could provide a reduction of the size of the nickel particles in the catalysts and consequently an increasing level of the catalytic decomposition exploit to take place. The different activities of both catalysts, as noticed in Fig. 10, could be attributed to their different particles sizes as prepared, catalyst (A) showed bigger particles size. This sequentially could provide better activity since the occurring sintering process during the decomposition of methane had probably significantly reduced the particles of catalyst A, unlike in the case of catalyst B. By contrast, the commercial catalyst (Pd–Ag) produced stable high concentration, 45vol%, of hydrogen for a few minutes then a sudden reduction of about 40% in the hydrogen concentration was detected after 20min of testing. Furthermore, the hydrogen flux decreased again after 100min of the catalyst utilization, however a steady state of the hydrogen production was observed afterwards. Finally in line with the hydrogen production, a carbon species were formed. An increase in the catalyst weight was detected by the end of the reaction which is obviously related to carbon species deposition due to methane decomposition. The amount of the produced species of carbon was found to be 19.5gC/gNi. The spent catalyst sample as collected at the end of the reaction was then subjected to different analyses in order to examine the formed deposits. Hereafter, the carbon species characterizations are introduced through two tools analysis namely; Raman spectroscopy and total carbon content analysis. The Raman analysis of the collected catalyst after the process is next given in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 shows indicative peaks for the nano-carbon specices at wavenumber between 900 and 1500cm−1 confirming the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst structure. This however, two intense peaks around 1300 and 1500cm−1 (G and D indicative bands of carbon nanotubes [CNT]) referring to the good activity of the prepared catalyst, A. The peaks exhibited in Fig. 11 can also refer to the formation of carbon nano-fiber (CNF) along with the carbon nano-particles [55,56]. This can verify the ability of catalyst A in decomposing CH4 into carbonceous materials while producing hydrogen. On the other hand, the total carbon content of catalyst A, as collected after being processed in the methane decomposition, was matched with the Raman analysis and obviously confirms the formation of carbon materials as by-products for the hydrogen evolution process. The total carbon analysis also verifies the high activity of catalyst A toward the reduction of methane into carbon while releasing hydrogen since a carbon content of 6035g/kg was detected through this test. In conclusion, the catalysts prepared through this work are novel in terms of, the materials utilized in catalyst fabrication, fabrication methodology and preparation tools and procedures."
12,Summary and conclusion,"Hydrogen economy and the hydrogen based energy have been paid much attention over the last few decades due to the cleanness of such type of energy as well as the huge energy content of the hydrogen gas. The production of hydrogen from the natural gas is introduced in this research work. The mechanism of the natural gas decomposition into hydrogen and the utilization of different catalysts for the decomposition purpose are also reported. Two novel intensified composite nickel based catalyst for the hydrogen production by decomposing the methane is introduced in this research paper. The novelty of these catalysts is owing to their original preparation method as well as the used support material; carbon fiber. These novel catalysts have been prepared using a special technique of the electroless deposition called flow-through technique which was patented in 2006 for PIM group, University of Newcastle. Two different nickel sources; namely nickel chloride and nickel sulfide were utilized to synthesize the proposed catalysts of this study. A subsequent vacuum thermal treatment at elevated temperature was then applied, after the completion of the plating process, to obtain nano-structured nickel deposits on the carbon fiber to produce catalysts with high surface activity. The prepared catalysts have then shown much reliability and exhibited better performance compared to a commercial Pd based catalyst at all testing times, apart from the first 20min. The increasing hydrogen flux exploit which was obtained by the prepared catalysts can be explained as a result of the high concentrations as well as the good distribution of the nickel deposits within the fiber structure. This has in turn increased their selectivity and dissociating ability of methane into hydrogen due to the nature of nickel; being selective for hydrogen and its catalyst are always utilized for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The by-product of the methane decomposition, the carbon species, were identified as CNTs and subsequently quantified via using both Raman spectroscopy and total carbon content analyses respectively. Finally, the intensified catalysts in comparison with a commercially used Pd–Ag sheet have shown better sustainability in terms of no deactivation or poisoning over 6.5h of testing was noted. This explicitly was due to a nonstop state of the hydrogen flux increase which was obtained over the testing period. By contrast, the commercial sheet showed a fast decline of about 89% in the produced hydrogen concentration after only 20min of testing where it remained constant till the end of the reaction."
