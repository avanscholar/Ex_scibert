0,Introduction,"Food waste (FW) is one of the most abundant components of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) in both developed and developing countries, with 1.3 billion tonnes produced globally in 2016 (Kuczman et al., 2018). The amount of FW produced increases annually, with contributions from hotels, restaurants, families, canteens and companies all over the world (Zhang et al., 2014). Paper waste (PW) is defined as waste mostly comprised of toilet paper, newspaper, printer paper, wrapping paper and cardboard (Fonoll et al., 2016). The trend towards using paper towels or tissues instead of reusable towels at mealtimes has been shown to contribute significantly to the volume of PW around the world (Argun and Onaran, 2018). Because garbage classification systems for municipal waste recycling have yet to be implemented in most developing countries, and are rare even in developed countries, the complete separation of FW and PW is difficult to achieve (López et al., 2010; Romero-Güiza et al., 2014). For this reason, PW is typically accompanied with FW as mixed waste in the OFMSW. Anaerobic digestion (AD), a sustainable and environmental friendly process, is considered a promising technology for the disposal and minimization of organic wastes like FW and PW, and has the added value of simultaneously generating recycled fuel in the form of either methane or hydrogen (Hassan et al., 2017; Kong et al., 2018). To achieve stable operation in the AD system, the optimal carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio) needs to be maintained: a high C/N ratio results in insufficient nitrogen, and results in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) while a low C/N ratio often results in ammonia inhibition (Wang et al., 2014). By adopting a co-digestion strategy for the AD process, a suitable C/N ratio can be maintained in the substrate by mixing nitrogen-enriched organic wastes, such as FW, with nitrogen-poor organic waste, such as PW (Liu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012). Because the co-digestion of different organic wastes enhances degradation performance, it is attracting more attention than mono-digestion in the research community (Asato et al., 2016; Kong et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018). It is acknowledged that the two-phase AD system enhances the stability and improves substrate degradation because it provides the ideal environmental conditions for different groups of microorganisms (Algapani et al., 2019; Carvalheira et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). Since AD is also significantly influenced by temperature, there has been growing interest in the temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) system (Buffière et al., 2018; Dooms et al., 2018).A typical TPAD system establishes a phase-separation strategy, with hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis typically under a thermophilic condition of 55 °C in the first reactor (Liu et al., 2013), and methanogenesis in the second reactor under a mesophilic condition of 35 °C (Xiao et al., 2019). This has been shown facilitate the effective conversion from organic wastes to hythane (a mixture of methane and hydrogen) (Jiang et al., 2018). It should also be noted that the recirculation of digestate from the second reactor to the first reactor has been reported to stabilize the pH without the requirement for any extra alkalinity, and this resulted in higher hydrogen production (Cavinato et al., 2011; Kobayashi et al., 2012). Therefore, for the reliable co-digestion of FW and PW, the recirculated temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (R-TPAD) system is considered a more effective system with better outcomes than the non-recirculated temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (NR-TPAD). However, few studies have been focused on the application of the TPAD system to the co-digestion of PW and FW. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study in which the improvement of recirculation has been considered from the microbial angle. The comparative advantages of R-TPAD can be investigated by analyzing the effect of recirculation on the shift of prokaryotic community structure and functional microorganisms. The detailed results obtained from a microbial analysis during long-term operation are expected to clearly show the superiority of the recirculation strategy. Therefore, in this study, two TPAD systems, one with and one without recirculation, were operated in parallel for the co-digestion of FW and PW during a long-term operation of 365 days with periodical increases in the PW ratio of the substrate from 0 to 50%. Microbial samples of both the NR-TPAD and R-TPAD systems were taken during the stable operation for each PW increment. The characterization of the prokaryotic community structure and key microorganisms and their functions in the degradation of cellulose and the production of hydrogen were investigated and analyzed. The objectives of this study were as follows: 1) To illustrate the effect of digestate recirculation on the TPAD system by investigating the long-term performance of organic removal efficiency as well as methane and hydrogen production with the increasing of PW ratio; and 2) To determine the reasons for the different performances of NR-TPAD and R-TPAD by determining the impact of key hydrolytic, fermentative and methanogenic microorganisms on the entire system. Based on the results of this study, suggestions will also be made to improve the performance of the co-digestion of FW and PW in the treatment of OFMSW."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.1 Experimental apparatus and procedure The main components of the entire TPAD system for the co-digestion of FW and PW were two continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR) in operating in series. As shown in Fig. S1, the NR-TPAD and R-TPAD systems were clearly marked and were operated in parallel. The NR-TPAD system contains a thermophilic (55 °C) CSTR with an effective volume of 3 L (T1) and a mesophilic (35 °C) CSTR with an effective volume of 12 L (M2). The R-TPAD system used the same volume as the two CSTRs (RT1 and RM2) with an additional recirculation device pumping the digestate from the second reactor, RM2, back to the first reactor, RT1, at a recirculation ratio of 0.4 (Qin et al., 2019). No additional alkalinity was provided to the reactors. The same substrate tank was used to prepare the mixture of FW and PW for both reactors, operated under an organic loading rate (OLR) of approximately 4.4–5.3 g COD L−1 d−1. The total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the entire system was 30 days since a relative long HRT of 30 days is known to be suitable for the AD of solid waste. The HRT of the first reactor (T1 and RT1) was 6 days, while that of the second reactor (M2 and RM2) was 24 days, and separation was based on a recirculation ratio of 0.4. It should be noted that, in this study, the HRT is equivalent to the sludge retention time (SRT). The long-term continuous operation of both NR-TPAD and R-TPAD continued for 365 days. When the removal performance was stable (with stable removal and stable biogas production), the PW ratio in the substrate was increased: this occurred on the 127th, 202nd and 279th days."
3,Feedstock and inoculum sludge,"2.2 Feedstock and inoculum sludge The FW substrate was artificially prepared every 30 days and was stored at 4 °C by smashing and mixing the following raw materials: a total solid (TS) ratio of 20% wasted staple foods (including rice, bread, udon noodles and Chinese noodles), 14% animal products (including wasted meat, fish and eggs), 30% fruit waste and 36% vegetable waste. The recipe was based on a local survey result of the real FW content (Li et al., 2003). The PW substrate was prepared by artificially mixing shredded toilet paper, printed office paper and wasted newspaper with a ratio of 1:1:1 (dry weight). The mixture of FW and PW was prepared once a week and was mixed into a slurry and stored in the substrate tank at 4 °C, with a TS content of around 10%. During the operation, the PW ratio in the mixture substrate was periodically elevated from 0 to 20%, 40% and 50% of the TS in the following runs (Run-1 to Run-4). Trace elements, including Fe, Ni and Co, were added to the substrate to ensure sufficient nutrients: sufficiency was defined as 10 mg Fe, 1 mg Co and 1 mg Ni per 1 kg OFMSW (wet weight). The mesophilic reactors (M2 and RM2) were inoculated with the mesophilic anaerobic digested sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant, while the thermophilic reactors (T1 and RT1) were inoculated with the same anaerobic digested sludge acclimated to 55 °C. Before initiating the long-term continuous operation, both the NR-TPAD and R-TPAD were given two weeks for the start-up of a stable digestion of FW at an HRT of 100 days and another two weeks at an HRT of 50 days."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis The chemical reagents used in the analysis were all purchased from Wako Co. Ltd., Japan. The values of pH were measured by a HM-30R pH meter (DKK-TOA). The total ammonia nitrogen (TAN, N-NH4 +) concentration was determined with the indophenol method (Bolleter et al., 1961). The alkalinity was determined by titration with terminal pH values of 4.8. The concentrations of COD, TS and volatile solid (VS) were measured according to the standard methods: potassium dichromate method was used for COD and dry weight method for TS and VS. Carbohydrate was measured with the phenol-sulfate examination method (Qin et al., 2019). Protein was measured with the traditional Folin-phenol Lowry method. The volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ethanol (EtOH) concentrations were detected using gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, Agilent 6890) and a 30 m capillary column (J&W, DB-WAXetr). The temperature of the injector and detector were both 250 °C. For oven was used as follows: at 125 °C for 5 min and then the temperature was elevated at a rate of 2.5 °C/min, and held at 180 °C for 5 min. The VFAs detected in this study include acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), butyric acid (HBu/i-HBu), valeric acid (HVa/i-HVa) and caproic acid (HCa). Lactic acid (HLa) concentrations were determined by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE, Agilent 7100) with a (D/L)-lactic acid standard. The electrophoresis solution consisted of Tris, quinolinic acid and HDTMA, with a pH at 7.3. Biogas produced from the CSTR was collected and recorded by a wet tip gas meter (W-NK-0.5B, Shinagawa) and the volume was normalized with the standard temperature and pressure (Kong et al., 2018). The component ratios of N2, CH4 and CO2 were measured by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD, Shimadzu GC-8A) with 2 m stainless steel column packed with Porapak Q. The H2 content of the biogas was detected by another GC-TCD (Shimadzu GC-8A) with a column packed with a molecular sieve 5A (60/80, φ3 mm). The temperature of the injector, column and detector were 100 °C, 70 °C and 100 °C, respectively. The carrier gas was argon and was controlled at 100 kPa."
5,Microbial community structure analysis,"2.4 Microbial community structure analysis Sludge samples were collected from the outlet of each reactor during the stable phase of each run on Day 97, 181, 275 and 350, then stored in −80 °C before DNA extraction. The collected sludge was initially centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and 0.15 g of the sediment was used for DNA extraction with ISOIL for Beads Beating kit (Nippon gene, Japan). The concentrations and quality of the extracted DNA were measured with NanoDrop 2000 (Nanodrop Inc., USA) and diluted to 10 ng μL−1 for PCR. Former primer 341F (5'-CCT AYG GGR BGC ASC AG-3′) and mixed reverse primer 806R & 806R-P (5′-GGA CTA CHV GGG THT CTA AT-3′ & 5′-GGA CTA CCA GGG TAT CTA AG-3′ in ratio of 30:1) were used for the PCR amplification of V3-V4 fragment in 16S rRNA gene (Li et al., 2019; Ni et al., 2019). The PCR amplifications were performed under the following conditions: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s, 50 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 10 s, and a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min with Low DNA Ex Taq® (TaKaRa, Japan). Triplicate PCR products for each sample were mixed to minimize the PCR bias before the sequencing barcode was added. The purity and concentration of the amplified DNA was verified by a DNA chip with Bioanalyzer 7500 (Agilent Technologies, USA) and then purified with Agencourt® AMPure® XP (Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Purified DNA was measured by Qubit 3.0 ® (Life technologies, USA) and diluted to 4 nmol L−1. Illumina Miseq platform were used for sequencing. The raw data were processed by QIIME (version 1.8.0): Sequences were assembled and filtered to remove poor-quality sequences (longer than 480 bp or shorter than 400 bp). Operation taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated based on a similarity of 97%. OTUs were aligned against the most recent vision of the Greengenes database, 13_8, (http://qiime.org/home_static/dataFiles.html). Chimeras and Singleton OTUs were removed and the sequence number of each sample was unified to 55,000 with random selection in order to remove the bias of sequencing depth caused by the DNA concentration and PCR. The Chao1 richness index, the Shannon's diversity index and the Simpson's diversity index were calculated based on the clustered sequence data (Magurran, 1988). The representative sequence of the main OTUs listed in tables and figures were submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers from MT013413 to MT013484."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physical and chemical parameters,"3.1 Physical and chemical parameters As the PW ratio increased from 0 to 50%, the C/N ratio in the substrate increased from 17.1 to 25.8. The OLRs of four runs were 5.3, 4.7, 4.6 and 4.4 g COD L−1 d−1, respectively. While the pH of both systems gradually decreased, the pH of the mesophilic reactors (above 7.2) was higher than that of thermophilic ones (below 5.2). Note also that the pH value in reactor RT1 (4.59–5.18) was higher than that in T1 (3.76–4.80), with recirculation providing alkalinity to the first reactor. The pH, TAN and alkalinity concentrations are given in Table 1 and the concentrations of COD, TS, VS, carbohydrate and protein are shown in Table S1. The overall removal efficiency of both NR-TPAD and R-TPAD during the entire 365-day experiment is given in Table 2 . The general performance of the R-TPAD was better than that of the NR-TPAD, and the performance was notably better when the PW ratio reached 50%: The R-TPAD system maintained COD removal efficiencies from 86.2% to 76.5% with the increase of PW ratio from 0 to 50% while those of the NR-TPAD system was from 81.3% to 69.7%. The VS removal efficiencies in the R-TPAD decreased from 86.0% to 78.4% as the PW ratio increased, while those in the NR-TPAD decreased from 81.6% to 72.5%. Both the NR-TPAD and R-TPAD realized a carbohydrate removal efficiency of over 86.5%. Fig. 1 illustrates the contribution of each reactor to COD, VS and carbohydrate removal. With the COD, VS and carbohydrate contribution ratios all lower than 9%, it is reasonable to conclude that reactor T1 barely contributed to the degradation of the substrate in the NR-TPAD system. The substrate was mainly degraded in the second reactor (contributing for 91% ~ 100%), as is indicated in Fig. 1(a), (c) and (e). However, a large proportion of COD, VS and carbohydrate degradation occurred in reactor RT1, accounting for 70%, 74% and 82%, respectively when the PW ratio was 0, as can be seen in Fig. 1(b), (d) and (f). Even when the PW was elevated to 50%, the COD, VS and carbohydrate degradation in reactor RT1 was 27%, 45% and 40%, respectively. This result demonstrates the importance of the role of first reactor in maintaining the relatively high removal efficiency of organic wastes in the R-TPAD system. This means the OLR of the second reactor (RM2) is much lower, which elevates the total removal efficiencies of the whole system. From the view of biogas production rate, the R-TPAD system was also superior to the NR-TPAD system. In the NR-TPAD system, almost no hythane was generated by the first reactor, and all the hythane was produced in reactor M2. Despite the high gas production rate obtained, the CH4 content in reactor M2 was <60%. Hydrogen was generated in the R-TPAD system, accounting for approximately 50% of the produced biogas in the first reactor. Also, a large amount of methane was produced from RM2 and the CH4 content was higher than that of M2. The total combustion heat of methane and hydrogen derived from the removed COD in R-TPAD was significantly higher than that in the NR-TPAD, and even 10 times higher when the PW was 50%, as shown in Table S2. These results are clear evidence that the degradation effectiveness and biogas production of the R-TPAD were better than those of the NR-TPAD during the entire operation period."
8,Bacterial community structure in reactor T1,"3.2 Bacterial community structure in reactor T1 Reactor T1 had an average Shannon diversity of 2.19 (Table S3), which is much lower than that in a typical thermophilic AD system (Gagliano et al., 2015). A total of 21 bacteria phyla were identified. Of these, phylum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria accounted for over 99.5% of the entire community, as shown in Fig. S2(a). The OTUs with a relative abundance of >0.5% and their main functions are listed in Table S4. Among them, the functional lactic acid bacteria (LAB) group predominates, with 13 species, all belonging to order Lactobacillales. The total number of LAB increased from 74.5% in Run-1 to 95.2% in Run-4. However, the species belonging to order Bacillales, which has protein-degrading ability, only survived in Run-1. Species belonging to order Rhodospirillales, which were aligned as acetogenic bacteria (ACB) (Pitiwittayakul et al., 2016), also decreased from 3.7% in Run-1 and to 0.5% in Run-2 and were not detected in either Run-3 or in Run-4. It has been reported that the high concentration of lactic acid produced by LAB significantly inhibit the growth of other bacteria (Handous et al., 2019; Lyhs et al., 2015). This finding is consistent with the variation of community structures in our system. As can be seen in Table 1 and Table 2, the pH of the reactor T1 was very low, in the 3.76–4.80 range. This low pH facilitated the lactic acid and alcohol fermentation, resulting in higher concentrations of lactic acid and ethanol (Fu and Mathews, 1999; Luedeking and Piret, 2000). It should also be noted that the acetate concentration of T1 was lower than that of RT1. This result suggests that the conversion from ethanol to acetate was also inhibited: such an inhibition has been reported to weaken biogas production (Hwang et al., 2004). This is consistent with the lower biogas production rate found in T1. Therefore, it is likely that the predomination of these LAB made the system over-acidized and eventually led to a deteriorated and simplified microbial community (Banks et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2016). The performance of T1 went into a vicious circle, and only produced lactic acid, which greatly reduced the organic removal efficiency of the NR-TPAD system."
9,Bacterial community structure in reactor RT1,"3.3 Bacterial community structure in reactor RT1 Compared with T1, reactor RT1 obtained a relatively high Shannon diversity with average value of 3.73. A total of 32 bacterial phyla were detected in the RT1 samples. As mentioned above, the R-TPAD had better performance both in removal efficiencies and hydrogen production than that of the NR-TPAD due to the efficient operation of RT1. Therefore, by comparing the microbial community structure of RT1 to the other 3 reactors, the predominant bacteria in RT1 were classified into the 3 groups to explain the effects of recirculation on removal efficiency and hydrogen production. 3.3.1 The indigenous bacteria Since RT1 differed from T1 in terms of recirculation, T1 can be regarded as the blank control of RT1. Those bacteria which existed in both first reactors (T1 and RT1) but absence in the second ones (M2 and RM2) were defined as the indigenous bacteria (IB). The five-major species of IB predominating in T1 (Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Leuconostoc inhae, Acetobacter fabarum and Lactobacillus siliginis) were also predominate in RT1 and showed a similar variation trend with the increase of PW ratio, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The occupation of IB in reactor RT1 was maintained at around 40%, and LAB were the predominant functional group in IB. Besides, Acetobacter fabarum, an acetogenic bacterium was present in Run-1, but then disappeared in the other runs. 3.3.2 The recirculated bacteria Recirculation brought the entire microbial community from reactor RM2 to RT1 together with the digestate. In reactor RT1, those bacteria which were sourced from the recirculation were defined as the recirculated bacteria (RB). As shown in Fig. 2(a), RB have different biological classifications, which greatly improves the α-diversity of RT1. The relative abundance of RB decreased from 26.5% in Run-1 and 47.2% in Run-2 to 9.7% in Run-3 and 5.3% in Run-4, as can be seen in Fig. 3 . They were mainly hydrolytic bacteria, acidogenic bacteria and syntrophic bacteria. The presence of RB suggests that reactor RT1 was able to effectively degrade carbohydrate (including cellulose and cellobiose) and protein to produce hydrogen (detailed information is shown in Table S5). Large quantities of RB were transferred to reactor RT1, establishing a stable microbial consortium in RT1 when PW ratio was lower than 20%. However, as the cellulose ratio in the substrate continued to rise, the RB apparently did not provide effective degradation ability, especially under the inappropriate temperature from the mesophilic to thermophilic condition. 3.3.3 Thermophilic-enriched bacteria Apart from the indigenous bacteria and the recirculated bacteria, some strains of thermophilic-enriched bacteria (TB) were detected in reactor RT1 but not in the other three reactors. The pH of RT1 was higher than that of T1 because of the alkalinity provided from the recirculated digestate. Moreover, the elevated microbial diversity of RT1 due to recirculation served to enrich thermophilic bacteria. Even though only 4 OTUs were classified as TB, the total relative abundance among them was high. It is highly likely that the presence of these TB also helped to achieve cellulose degradation and hydrogen production in reactor RT1. The denovo10312 was the most predominant OTU detected in RT1, with a relative abundance ranging from 19.4% to 34.3%, which increased as the PW ratio was increased. This OTU obtained a 95% similarity with Caproiciproducens galactitolivorans, a bacteria reportedly capable of degrading glucose and lactose to H2, CO2, VFAs and ethanol (Kim et al., 2015). The presence of this strain is thought to have contributed significantly to the hydrogen production of reactor RT1. The other OTU worthy of mention is denovo9795, which had a relative abundance of almost 0 in the first two runs but as much as 7.2% in Run-3 and 12.9% in Run-4. This OTU showed a 100% similarity with Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, a hydrogen-producing bacterium capable of degrading cellulose (Zhang et al., 2019). It is reported that an enzyme named β-glucosidase (BGL) produced by T. thermosaccharolyticum has cellobiose-hydrolyzing ability and this enzyme exhibits high enzymatic activity over a broad temperature range, from 45 to 70 °C. The BGL also has shown a high tolerance to glucose and cellobiose due to its high specific activity (Pei et al., 2012). The decomposition of cellobiose is a rate-limiting step for cellulose degradation since cellobiose inhibits the activities of cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases (George et al., 2001). Due to the reduction in cellobiose inhibition after cellobiose is hydrolyzed to glucose by BGL, the cellulolytic enzymes function more efficiently. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the presence and enrichment of T. thermosaccharolyticum in this system enhanced the ability of hydrolyzing cellulose and cellobiose, and the by-products of hydrolysis were further utilized by C. galactitolivorans and the RB for hydrogen production. In addition to denovo9795, there were significant increases in the abundance of two other OTUs at the high PW ratio, and both of them are known to be capable of degrading cellulose. The total abundance of cellulose-degrading bacteria which belong to RB and TB, respectively, were calculated. As indicated in Fig. 4 , the total abundance of the cellulose-degrading bacteria in RT1 basically remained stable at around 10% during the entire operation. Although the degradation of cellulose in the system remained stable, the type of cellulose-degrading bacteria gradually shifted from RB to TB as the PW ratio increased, and the decomposition pathway of cellulose changed from a cellose and glucose pathway to a VFA pathway. The successful enrichment of these TB in reactor RT1 is evidence of a specific microbial evolution associated with the elevated pH and thermophilic condition in the R-TPAD system. The resultant microbial community helps to maintain the cellulose-degradation performance in the R-TPAD system under high PW ratios."
10,Bacterial community structure in reactors M2 and RM2,"3.4 Bacterial community structure in reactors M2 and RM2 As can be seen in Table S3, the second reactors M2 and RM2 had a higher microbial diversity than the first reactors T1 and RT1. This can be concluded from the significantly higher Shannon diversity of all samples from both M2 (4.64–5.67) and RM2 (4.83–5.48) than those of T1 (1.70–2.57) and RT1 (2.64–4.89). In the bacterial community, as shown in Fig. S2(b) and (d), Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were predominant in M2 and RM2. The third predominant phylum, Chloroflexi, obtained a high abundance in M2 but not in RM2: this was especially notable in Run-2 and Run-3. Although the identified predominant OTUs in M2 and RM2 were shown to have the similar ability of degrading cellulose, protein or saccharide, the microbial community of these two reactors differed significantly at the genus level, as can be seen in Table S6 and Table S7."
11,Effect of recirculation on archaeal community,"3.5 Effect of recirculation on archaeal community As shown in Fig. 2(b), archaea were barely detected in reactor T1. It has been reported that the methanogenesis is significantly inhibited when the pH is below 5.5 (Liu et al., 2008). The results indicate that the pH of reactor T1 at all PW ratio was below 5.0. However, a certain quantity of archaea was detected in RT1. The predominant archaeal species in RT1 in each run was highly consistent with that in RM2. It mainly consisted of Methanosaeta concilii, Methanothermobacter wolfei, Methanoculleus receptaculi, Methanobacterium petrolearium and Methanosarcina thermophile. Among which, Methanothermobacter wolfei, Methanoculleus receptaculi, and Methanobacterium petrolearium were hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Hydrogenotrophic methanogen is known to utilize hydrogen and CO2 to produce methane, but methanogenesis did not occur in reactor RT1, despite there being sufficient available substrate. It is assumed that the toxicity of undissociated acetic acid (un-HAc) inhibited biological activity in this research. As the pH of RT1 floated between 4.59–5.18, a proportion of HAc exist in the system in its undissociated form. It has been reported that un-HAc is the uncoupler of the plasma membrane, exhibiting biotoxicity and inhibiting the synthesis of ATP (Mawson et al., 1991). When the concentration of un-HAc exceeds 310 mg L−1, 50% of the methane production becomes inhibited and when the concentration exceeds 2360 mg L−1, 90% of the methane production becomes inhibited. Note also that when the concentration exceeds 810 mg L−1, the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is not recoverable (Zhang et al., 2018). With the concentrations of HAc given in Table 2, the concentrations of un-HAc in RT1 were calculated as follows: (1) HAc = C 1 + 10 pH − pKa where [HAc] is the undissociated acetic acid concentration (mg L−1), C is the total acetic acid concentration (mg L−1), Ka is the dissociation constant with the value of 4.76 for HAc. As a result, the concentration of un-HAc in RT1 were 1850.1, 2375.5, 1396.5 and 618.1 mg L−1 as the PW ratio increased, obviously exceeding the inhibition concentration for methanogenesis. As mentioned above, the activity of archaea in reactor RT1 was inhibited by low pH and the toxicity of undissociated acid. Therefore, although a certain amount of hydrogenotrophic archaea was transferred from RM2 to RT1 by recirculation, the produced hydrogen in RT1 was not utilized or consumed by these archaea. As a result, the invalidation of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in RT1 ensured the obvious hydrogen accumulation of R-TPAD system."
12,Environmental parameters and sample clustering,"3.6 Environmental parameters and sample clustering The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) diagram illustrated in Fig. 5 shows the clustering trend of all microbial samples. Recirculation significantly influenced the composition and variations in the microbial community: The distance between RT1 and RM2 in the R-TPAD was much closer than that of T1 and M2 in the NR-TPAD. The microbial community structure in the first reactor with short HRT was more likely to be influenced by recirculation, as can be seen by the clustering of the samples from M2 and RM2 but a dispersing of the samples from T1 and RT1. Among all the environmental factors, temperature is the most important one that affects the community structure. It should be noted that although pH was given as a categorical factor in CCA, pH was actually influenced by temperature and recirculation. In the case of the thermophilic reactors, the decrease in the pH was due to the production of acetic acid by the ACB but was elevated due to the recirculation of digestate. It can therefore be concluded that the pH did not directly influence the entire system, but it was just one factor that influenced the distribution of microorganisms. The variation in the PW ratio exhibited significant influence on RT1. The clustering of RT1 samples greatly changed when the PW ratio was higher than 40%. This was consistent with the previous description as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4: there were some thermophilic bacteria enriched in RT1, which substituted for RB and played a role in the degradation of cellulose."
13,Conclusions,"The stable co-digestion of food waste and paper waste was realized in the R-TPAD system at a PW ratio of 50%, achieving a VS removal efficiency higher than 78.4% and carbohydrate removal efficiency higher than 89.1%. However, the NR-TPAD system realized the same removal performance only at a maximum PW ratio of 40%. The R-TPAD also successfully produced bio-hydrogen. The variations in the microbial community variations were as follows: 1. With the recirculation of digestate, microorganisms were transferred to the first reactor, helping to establish a functional microbial community capable of hydrolyzing organics and producing hydrogen. This effect was more obvious when PW ratio ≤20%. 2. Because the recirculated digestate provided alkalinity to the first reactor, the pH was maintained at higher than 4.5. At 55 °C, thermophilic carbohydrate-degrading bacteria massively bred in the first reactor. When PW ≥40%, thermophilic cellulose-degrading bacteria replaced the role of recirculated mesophilic bacteria, becoming the main functional group of cellulose degradation. 3. Since the utilization of hydrogen by archaea was inhibited by low pH and undissociated acids, the accumulation of hydrogen was realized in RT1. Recirculation helps to realize the phase separation of R-TPAD system, converting the hydrolysis product from lactic acid to hydrogen in the first reactor, and was shown to significantly enhance the co-digestion of food waste and paper waste. This was especially the case for high-strength paper waste."
