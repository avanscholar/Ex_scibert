0,Introduction,"Traditional fossil fuels such as coal and oil are being depleted, whose long-term consumptions have brought about large emissions of carbon dioxide, leaving greenhouse effects [1]. Transformations of other natural resources including solar, tidal, wind or biomass into alternative energies has become an attractive target to both academic and industrial premises, mainly due to their ubiquitous, highly renewable, and less gas-releasing properties [2]. Biorefining techniques actually play a key role for efficient and sustainable production, deserving more attentions [3]. Among various biomass feedstocks, sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and mannitol can be obtained by hydrogenation of lignocellulosic fractions including cellulose and hemicellulose [4], showing wide applications in many areas. For example, sorbitol being the most inexpensive sugar alcohol, has been used in manufacture of toothpaste, cosmetics, as well as pharmaceuticals [4], while isosorbide, its di-dehydrated form, turned out to be a raw material for producing engineering plastics such as isosorbide polycarbonate [5]. At the same time, di-dehydration of mannitol could produce many useful polymers [6]. Mono-dehydration products of sorbitol and mannitol such as 1,4-sorbitan (1,4-anhydro-d-sorbitol) and 1,4-mannitan (1,4-anhydro-d-mannitol) are also key intermediates for synthesis of detergents [7] and pharmaceuticals [8], respectively. In practice, not only mineral acids such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid [4], but also solid acids including phosphates of transition metal [9], sulfated metal oxides [10] or superhydrophobic mesoporous acid [11] have been reported as catalysts for the dehydration of sugar alcohols. However, there were still several big problems around this transformation. First of all, the use of mineral acids sometimes brought about instrumental corrosion and needed exothermic neutralization and product purification [4]. Most known catalysts contain transition metals with high Lewis acidity, favoring di-dehydration [4,9,10]. Additionally, high temperatures (200 °C or higher for metal phosphate-catalyzed di-dehydration [9], 150−300 °C for metal oxide [10], as well as 180 °C for sodium hydrogen sulfate-catalyzed mono-dehydration [12]) seemed to be a guarantee to effective conversions, including both di- and mono-dehydration. Overall, there is a significant room for optimization through careful design or selection of catalysts. Cerium dioxide (CeO2 or ceria) contains Ce4+ / Ce3+ redox pairs with comparatively lower potential of 1.3–1.8 eV [13], indicating cerium ion could be easily oxidized or reduced to different valences [13] and thus leave many oxygen vacancies, subsequently leading to potential applications as oxygen storage accelerator in automobile three-way catalysts [14], hydrogen production catalysts from fuels [15], carbon monoxide oxidation catalysts [16], as well as electrolyte reaction catalysts of fuel cells [17]. Cerium dioxide is also slightly basic and may bring about new reactivity for mild dehydrations such as mono-dehydration reactions. Photocatalysis has aroused enormous and continuous interests in many fields, including waste water treatment [18], pretention and control of air pollution [19], electrochemical splitting of water [20], organic transformations [21], production of hydrogen [22,23] as well as biomass valorization [24]. The effectiveness of photocatalysts is determined by two factors including adsorption behavior and electron-hole pair separation efficiency [25]. Herein, cerium dioxide is a semiconductor by nature and has good specific surface area, significantly improving light capturing ability of the material [26]. And meanwhile, cerium dioxide is a wide band gap material that is stable, while cerium has another favorable property that it could increase oxygen vacancies formation with high mobility of oxygen species [26]. Therefore, use of cerium dioxide as photocatalyst may give new reactivity to dehydration of sugar alcohols. On the other hand, titanium dioxide has been extensively studied and employed as photocatalyst for the past decades, mainly due to its high refractive index and great ultraviolet (UV) light absorption property [27]. There are three crystallographic forms of titanium dioxide, including rutile, anatase, as well as brookite, which all contain octahedrally-coordinated Ti4+ ions as major frameworks [28]. Although rutile appeared to be the most stable phase, anatase is usually viewed as the best photocatalytic component for various applications [28]. In the meantime, when titanium dioxide is mixed with cerium, the energy level of Ce4+ / Ce3+ redox pair with a band gap of 1.3–1.8 eV can be induced into the band gap of titanium dioxide, leading to red shifts of resulting mixed oxide to 400−500 nm as compared to those of individual titanium dioxide [29]. Obviously, the visible light activity of titanium dioxide could be promoted through doping of cerium. In addition, pure cerium dioxide is thermally unstable, but this weakness could be overcome by incorporation of titanium ions [30]. On the basis of these findings, it may be interesting to observe whether cerium-titanium mixed oxide could bring about new reactivity for dehydration of sugar alcohols. In the past twenty years, invention and application of mesoporous silicates such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 appeared to be a breakthrough in material science and industries. The SBA-15 is composed of two-dimensional hexagonal arrays of channels featuring diameter of 5−9 nm [31], whose morphology, network connectivity and wall thickness could be controlled by adjusting ratio of raw materials in sol-gel, showing great applications in adsorption, pharmaceutical carriers, and catalyst supports [32]. In order to keep the heterogeneity, it seems reasonable to immobilize the oxide into silicate support like SBA-15, where catalyst recycling, along with product separation may be improved. Furthermore, it is of significance to test effect of additional ligand that attached to solid catalysts. The additional ligand may coordinate to metal centers on SBA-15, altering microenvironment of catalytic component, probably affecting catalytic outputs in turn. This work intends to provide an efficient, eco-friendly, recoverable and photoactive system for the photocatalytic mono-dehydration of sugar alcohols. In practice, SBA-15 was employed as support for cerium dioxide which was further functionalized by adding titanium or poly(vinyl alcohol) to provide a new coordination environment for cerium sites. All synthesized photocatalysts were then employed in the photocatalytic dehydration of sugar alcohols including d-sorbitol and d-mannitol. A reaction mechanism was also proposed according to the obtained experimental results."
1,Experimental,
2,Starting materials,"2.1 Starting materials SBA-15 was synthesized according to literature [33], and then pre-treated with H2SO4 (0.05 mol L−1) to activate silanol groups prior to its use as support (S, Scheme 1 ). Cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.5 %) and cyanuric chloride (99 %) were purchased from Aladdin, while titanium(IV) n-butoxide (Ti(OBu)4, 99 %) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, 86 %–89 % hydrolyzed, medium molecular weight) were commercially available from Adamas. The d-sorbitol (> 98 %) and d-mannitol (> 99.9 %) were purchased from Adamas-beta. Aqueous ammonia (25 wt.%), triethylamine (99.5 %) as well as other metal salts, solvents and silica gel were all analytically pure and provided by local suppliers."
3,Photocatalysts preparation,"2.2 Photocatalysts preparation S (1.0 g), cyanuric chloride (0.92 g, 4.98 mmol) and triethylamine (35.97 mmol) were combined into anhydrous toluene (150 mL), and the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 20 h under continuous stirring (Scheme 1). The resulting solid (S1) was filtered under reduced pressure, carefully washed with distilled water (3 × 5 mL) and absolute ethanol (3 × 5 mL), and then dried at 60 °C in air. S1 (1.0 g), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (C1, 5.0 mmol; C2, 4.0 mmol; C3 2.5 mmol), and Ti(OBu)4 (C1, 0 mmol; C2, 1.0 mmol; C3, 2.5 mmol) were mixed into distilled water (30 mL) under stirring. Aqueous ammonia (25 wt.%, 2.2 mL, 30.0 mmol NH3) was then added, and the resulting mixture was further stirred at RT for 3 h. The solid was collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with distilled water (3 × 3 mL) and absolute ethanol (3 × 3 mL) and dried at 60 °C in air, followed by calcination (550 °C, for 4 h, yielding the supported oxide, Cn, n = 1–3, Scheme 1). Cn (n = 1–3, 0.5 g) was acidified in a diluted HCl solution (0.1 mol L−1, 50 mL) for 0.5 h, then collected by filtration. Acidified Cn (n = 1–3) was combined with cyanuric chloride (0.46 g, 2.49 mmol) and triethylamine (20 mmol) into anhydrous toluene (100 mL), followed by gentle heating of the mixture at 70 °C for 20 h under stirring (Scheme 1). PVA (0.15 g), triethylamine (10 mmol) and anhydrous toluene (30 mL) were subsequently added and the mixture is stirred at 90 °C for 10 h. The final photocatalysts (Cm, m = 4–6, corresponding to Cn, n = 1–3 respectively) were obtained via filtration under reduced pressure, rinsed with distilled water (3 × 3 mL) and absolute ethanol (3 × 3 mL) and eventually dried at 60 °C in air."
4,Materials characterization,"2.3 Materials characterization BET surface area, pore volume, pore radius and pore size distribution are reported on Micromeritics ASAP 2020, using N2 adsorption isotherms at 77.35 K. Solid samples are degassed at 150 °C in vacuum before testing. Surface area is calculated by using the multi-point Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method based on adsorption data with relative pressure P / P 0 of 0.06-0.3. Pore volume (radius, 8.5−1500 Å) is obtained from N2 adsorbed at P / P 0 = 0.97. Both pore volume (radius, 8.5−1500 Å) and pore radius are determined by using Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Low-angle (2θ = 0.7°–10°) and wide-angle (2θ = 11°–80°) X-ray diffractions are detected on Philips X’Pert Pro diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), with interval of 0.05° second−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is measured on Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, using monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (1486.6 eV) as irradiation source, and binding energy scale is calibrated by using C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The peaks are fitted by employing Gaussian-Lorentz (G / L) product function with 30 % Lorentzian. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is detected on JEOL JSM-6700F at 20.0 kV without Au coating. The sample is dispersed into absolute ethanol by using ultrasonic bath, and then immobilized onto silicon chip. FT-IR is measured in KBr pellet on Bruker Tensor 27, having wave numbers of 400−4000 cm−1. GC–MS is reported on GCMS-QP2010 Plus, Shimadzu, equipped with Rxi-5 ms capillary column (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm). For part of GC, column temperature is 60 °C, injection port temperature is 250 °C, sampling mode was split-flow, split-ratio is 26, helium carrier gas. For MS, ion source temperature was 200 °C, and interface temperature was 250 °C."
5,Catalytic dehydration of sugar alcohols,"2.4 Catalytic dehydration of sugar alcohols D-Sorbitol (or d-mannitol, 1.0 mmol) and catalyst (2 mol% cerium over substrate, according to XPS data in Table 1 ) were combined in distilled water (5 mL) into a round-bottomed flask (50 mL) in the dark, followed by vigorous stirring for 6 h under UV irradiation (UV lamp, 300 W, 265 nm, Ultra Vitalux, Osram). Then, the solid photocatalyst was filtered, and sometimes reloaded with consumables for recycling. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure, then analyzed by GC–MS for identification and quantification."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Photocatalysts characterization,"3.1 Photocatalysts characterization Nitrogen physisorption provides a powerful method to study the porosity of synthesized samples. S shows a type IV isotherm as well as an H2 hysteresis loop [34], together with a sharp pore size distribution (Fig. S1, Sect. A1 of Supplementary data), representing a typical mesoporous material. Upon cerium dioxide incorporation, C1 still shows a type IV isotherm in association with H2 hysteresis loop (a, Fig. 1 ) [34], with reduced values of BET surface area, pore volume, micropore volume, and pore radius (C1 vs. S, Table 1), indicating cerium dioxide incorporation. Cerium and titanium co-precipitation in C2 and C3 materials showed similar textural properties and porosity as compared to C1 (b and c, Fig. 1 vs. a, Fig. 1, Fig. S1; C2 and C3 vs. C1 and S, Table 1). Further immobilization of organic ligands such as cyanuric chloride and PVA into C1-C3 would maintain the types of isotherm and hysteresis loop (d vs. a, e vs. b, f vs. c, Fig. 1), with almost unchanged or even improved BET surface areas (C4 vs. C1, C6 vs. C3, Table 1). Low- and wide-angle XRD experiments were subsequently conducted to understand the crystalline nature of synthesized samples. S shows a hexagonal symmetry according to its low-angle XRD, featuring 100 (2θ = 0.91°), 110 (2θ = 1.60°) and 200 (2θ = 1.78°) diffractions (Fig. S2, Sect. A2 of Supplementary data) [33]. After immobilization of cerium dioxide, the original 100 diffraction shifted to higher 2θ degree, while 110 and 200 diffractions disappeared (a, Fig. S3, Sect. A3 of Supplementary data vs. Fig. S2), indicating 110 and 200 interlayer spaces are filled with oxides (C1, Scheme 1). When cerium and titanium were coprecipitated in samples C2 and C3, the resulting materials exhibited identical low-angle XRD pattern as compared to C1 (b and c vs. a, Fig. S3). Further incorporation of cyanuric chloride and PVA would worsen low-angle XRD patterns in C1 (d vs. a, Fig. S3), but diffractions from C2 and C3 materials were almost unchanged (e and f vs. b and c, Fig. S3). In wide-angle XRD, C1 shows typical diffractions of cerium dioxide (CeO2; 2θ = 28.58° (111), 33.12° (200), 47.55° (220), 56.42° (311); PDF No. 65-5923; circles in a, Fig. 2 ; a, Fig. S4, Sect. A4 of Supplementary data), also observed for C2 (circles in b, Fig. 2). In addition to this component, diffractions of rutile were also observed for C2 (TiO2; 2θ = 27.49° (110), 36.14° (101), 39.27° (200), 44.13° (210); PDF No. 87-0710; dot lines in b, Fig. 2; b, Fig. S4). Upon additional titanium content incorporation (C3 vs. C2, Table 1), the resulting sample (C3) exhibited a poor crystallinity (c vs. b, Fig. 2), indicating that the crystallinity of the metal oxide may be influenced by the molar ratio of metal ions in the preparative solution (Scheme 1). The functionalization of C1, C2 and C3 with cyanuric chloride and PVA (C4, C5 and C6) rendered materials with certain crystallinity (d–f vs. a–c, Fig. 2). In particular, the phase of Ti3O5 could be observed for C6 in wide-angle XRD pattern (Ti3O5; 2θ = 18.91° (200), 33.64° (310), 40.38° (220), 44.74° (221); PDF No. 40-0806; grey cubes in f, Fig. 2; c, Fig. S4). The binding energies and atomic compositions of C1 to C6 samples are summarized in Table 2 , with XPS survey scans provided in Fig. S5 (Sect. A5, Supplementary data). C1 shows higher contents of oxygen and carbon, as well as lower content of silicon with respect to the parent SBA-15 (C1 vs. S, Table 2), indicating cerium oxide incorporation on S (C1, Scheme 1). The presence of sulfur and chloride reflects the pre-treatment of long-axis SBA-15 in sulfuric acid and incorporation of cyanuric chloride during synthesis (C1, Scheme 1). The cerium/titanium molar ratio found for C2 is 4.5 / 1 (Table 2), close to the preparative molar ratio (C2, Scheme 1) while a 1 / 1 ratio was obtained for C3 (Table 2 vs. preparative one for C3, Scheme 1). Modification of C1 with PVA led to decreased contents of silicon and oxygen (with increased carbon content, C4 vs. C1, Table 2), indicating PVA incorporation (C4, Scheme 1), analogous to those observed for C5 and C6 (C5 and C6, Scheme 1). Cerium 3d core-level XPS spectra of all samples could be fitted into eight components, corresponding to four spin-orbit doublets (Fig. 3 ). Three of them identified as v-u (3d5/2-3d3/2), v”-u”, v”’-u”’ are ascribed to Ce4+ species, while the left v’-u’ to Ce3+ species (a–f, Fig. 3) [36]. According to this standard, all samples (C1-C6) contain Ce3+ contributions, with PVA-modified samples exhibiting higher Ce3+ content with respect to their parent materials (C4-C6 vs. C1-C3, annotation b, Table 2), indicating some Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+ during modification (Scheme 1). SEM images were subsequently recorded. Overall, there are a lot of rods having length of 1−4 μm on SEM images of all samples (a–f, Fig. 4 ), corresponding to SBA-15 materials (Scheme 1). Furthermore, all rods carry small particles with sizes of 10−20 nm (a–f, Fig. 4), probably corresponding to pure or ligand-modified metal oxides. FT-IR spectroscopy showed two small peaks at 3748 and 3445 cm−1 for C1 which could be ascribed to stretching vibrations of surface hydroxyl groups belonging to cerium dioxide, and S or adsorbed water respectively (a, Fig. S6, Sect. A6 of Supplementary data) [33,37]. Another small peak appeared at 2957 cm−1, corresponding to antisymmetric stretching of C–H of methyl group, stemming from residual organic templates in C1 (a, Fig. S6) [33]. Furthermore, C1 shows three peaks with moderate intensity at 1633, 1557 and 1419 cm−1, characteristic of OH bending of adsorbed water [33], asymmetric stretching of carbon-carbon bond of residual toluene [38] and asymmetric carbon-oxygen stretching of carboxyl groups [39], respectively. Moreover, the large band centered at 1081 cm−1, along with the small one at 802 cm−1 could be both ascribed to SiO stretching of silicon dioxide (a, Fig. S6) [40]. Lastly, the peak that formed at 461 cm−1 may indicate the stretching of CeO bond (a, Fig. S6). Both C2 and C3 show very similar FT-IR spectra as C1 (b and c vs. a, Fig. S6), but the peak at 444 cm−1 on C2 and the shoulder peaks at 442 and 419 cm−1 on C3 should be attributed to the stretching vibrations of TiO bond (b and c, Fig. S6) [41]. The new peak that generated at 2987 cm−1 for both C2 and C3 seems to be C–H stretching of residual cyanuric chloride, while that at 2900 cm−1 on C3 exhibited anti-symmetric stretching of methylene group of residual organic templates (b and c, Fig. S6) [33]. Additionally, immobilization of cyanuric chloride and PVA would not bring about new FT-IR bands (d vs. a, e vs. b, f vs. c, Fig. S6)."
8,Photocatalytic dehydration of sugar alcohols,"3.2 Photocatalytic dehydration of sugar alcohols The photocatalytic dehydration of sugar alcohols was subsequently attempted by using the synthesized photocatalytic systems, with remarkably different results for d-sorbitol and d-mannitol (Tables 3 and 4 ). Moderate conversions (32–44 %) were obtained for most systems (C1 to C4 and C6) with the exception of a high photoconversion observed for C5 (85 %) in photocatalytic dehydration of d-sorbitol (Table 3). Herein, C5 exceeded C1-C3 due to coordination of additional organic ligands (Scheme 1). Simultaneously, C5 shows a Ce / Ti molar ratio of 3 / 1 as compared to pure Ce for C4 and that of 1 / 2 for C6 (Table 2), while cerium dioxide that doped with a small amount of titanium may show better photocatalytic activity than individual cerium dioxide and composition-reserved binary oxide [25], leading to the best performance of C5. On the other hand, importantly, the photo-assisted dehydration was almost quantitative to the production of the mono-dehydrated product (1,4-sorbitan, Table 3). Additionally, use of additional ligands showed positive effects for the mono-dehydration of d-sorbitol that catalyzed by C2 and C3 (entries 7 vs. 4, 8 vs. 5, Table 3), but less efficiency for that by C1 (entries 6 vs. 3, Table 3), proposing the different properties of metal centers (pure Ce for C1, Ce-Ti mixture for C2 and C3, Table 2; Scheme 1). Comparably, the photodehydration of d-mannitol was remarkably more efficient under the investigated conditions for all synthesized materials including almost quantitative product yield for C1 (only containing Ce) (entry 3, Table 4). It seems that pure cerium dioxide-based catalyst (C1) could be well activated by UV irradiation for the transformation of d-mannitol (entries 3 vs. 2, Table 4), but additional modification of such material did not apparently have any beneficial effect in terms of photocatalytic activity (entries 6 vs. 3, Table 4; C4 vs. C1, Scheme 1). Similarly, for d-mannitol conversion, the mono-dehydrated product (1,4-mannitan) was obtained almost exclusively under the investigated reaction conditions (Table 4). Recycling experiments were subsequently performed for C3 and C6 to test the stability of the systems under the investigated photocatalytic conditions. Both C3 and C6 could be well recycled during the first three uses (entries 1-1r2, 2-2r2, Table 5 ), indicating their frameworks are well maintained under UV irradiation during recycling experiments. Next, from the fourth round, C3 photoactivities began to decline sharply (entries 1r3 and 1r4, Table 5), but no significant reduced values were observed for C6 (entries 2r3 and 2r4, Table 5), clearly showing that the additional ligands could stabilize the photocatalyst framework during recycling (C6 vs. C3, Scheme 2 ). With the data obtained so far, it can be seen that the present system is comparable to other ones in terms of mono-dehydration efficiency [9–12], reaction temperature [9–12], as well as durability and cost of catalyst [42]."
9,Proposed mechanism,"3.3 Proposed mechanism In view of the whole characterization and photocatalytic data (Tables 2–5), it seemed that cerium was comparably more active than titanium in dehydration, while titanium looked like cerium activator and structural modulator under light irradiation. In other words, when C3 was used as a model, cerium should play a key catalytic role in both mono- and di-dehydration of sugar alcohols such as d-sorbitol and d-mannitol (Paths 1–2, Scheme 2). The synthesized photocatalysts (e.g. C3) should have moderate Lewis acidity, while the electron of valence band (VB, 1.96 eV) of CeO2 may be transferred to the conduction band (CB, 7.97 eV) under light irradiation (Path 1, Scheme 2) [43], but meanwhile all reactions basically stopped at the mono-dehydration step, and only a small amount of di-dehydrated products are observed (Tables 3–5; Paths 1–2, Scheme 2)."
10,Conclusions,"SBA-15-supported functional cerium dioxide nanoparticles were prepared as photocatalysts. Characterizations revealed the synthesized samples maintain crystallinity of SBA-15 to some extent and showed satisfactory porosities. In photocatalytic dehydration of sugar alcohols, the synthesized samples showed high mono-dehydration selectivity. Furthermore, cerium looked more photocatalytic than titanium, but the doped titanium seemed to be a cerium activator and structural modulator. The attachment of organic ligands shows positive effects on efficiency of photocatalytic dehydration of d-sorbitol that catalyzed by cerium-titanium mixed oxide photocatalysts and could maintain catalyst durability during recycling. In comparison with known catalytic systems, this study shows high mono-dehydration selectivity under UV irradiation, with significant implications in future sustainable production."
