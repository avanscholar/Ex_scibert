0,Introduction,"The relative increase in the ratio of shale gas to crude oil has driven gas production to steadily increase in recent years because of advanced technology such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing [1–4]. According to the 2016 data of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, global natural gas production in 2040 is predicted to double the current production and shale gas will account for about 30% of the total production. Therefore, shale gas has been spotlighted to lead to a new paradigm of energy source in conjunction with the depletion of crude oil. In addition, since it has attracted attention as a raw material of the valuable chemicals like alcohol and olefin [5–7], research on converting shale gas such as methane, which accounts for the largest fraction of shale gas, has been an extremely important issue in the current global situation. However, most methane is combusted and utilized to generate heat and electricity because intensive energy is required to cleave the CH bonds of methane, which hinders direct conversion of methane to chemicals [8,9]. Accordingly, a method of manufacturing chemicals through multistep conversion has been proposed, and various studies have been conducted to produce syngas comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide as a platform material [10–13]. Generally, there are three ways to convert methane into syngas: dry reforming of methane (DRM) as in Eq. (1), steam reforming of methane (SRM) as in Eq. (2), and partial oxidation of methane (POM) as in Eq. (3). Among these, DRM and SRM, which respectively utilize CO2 and H2O, have endothermic characteristics and require a large amount of energy to maintain the reaction temperature [14]. Furthermore, the composition of the produced syngas is not suitable for the subsequent process since the desirable syngas with a H2/CO ratio as a feed for the gas-to-liquid (GTL) process is close to 2 [15,16]. POM seems to be a reasonable alternative because it can be operated autothermally from a slightly exothermic reaction with a H2/CO ratio of 2. However, due to the possibility of methane decomposition, carbon can be formed on the surface and the H2/CO ratio may highly deviate from 2 [17]. In addition, an additional air separation unit (ASU) is required to obtain pure oxygen from nitrogen, which can be an energy intensive process. Furthermore, the presence of a flammability issue due to the direct reaction of methane and oxygen at a high temperature and the catalyst based on a noble metal such as platinum hinder the application [18,19]. (1) C H 4 + C O 2 → 2 C O + 2 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 247 k J m o l - 1 (2) C H 4 + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 165 k J m o l - 1 (3) C H 4 + 1 / 2 O 2 → C O + 2 H 2 Δ H 298 K = - 36 k J m o l - 1 The chemical looping reforming (CLR) process was devised to solve the problems of air separation and flammability in the POM mentioned above since it utilizes metal oxide to oxidize methane. In the CLR process, methane is partially oxidized by lattice oxygen (O2–) inside the metal oxide instead of gaseous oxygen, and the reduced metal is then reoxidized with air in a different reactor [20,21]. The metal oxide used for the oxygen transfer is called an oxygen carrier, and it can be fabricated using earth-abundant material [22,23], which lowers the operation cost. Instead of air, steam can be used as an alternative oxidant for refilling oxygen in the reduced oxygen carrier. This scheme is so-called chemical looping steam methane reforming (CL-SMR) [Eqs. (4) and (5)]. Fig. 1 presents a brief scheme of the CL-SMR process. It follows a reaction mechanism similar to CLR including a reduction step in the fuel reactor, but it utilizes a different oxidizer of water in a regeneration step as below. (4) Reduction s t e p : M e O x + y C H 4 → M e O x - y + y CO + 2 H 2 (5) Regeneration s t e p : M e O x - y + y H 2 O → M e O x + y H 2 CL-SMR can simultaneously produce both hydrogen and syngas with an optimized ratio (H2/CO = 2) [24]. The process combining steam methane reforming, water gas shift reaction and hydrogen separation, which is widely used for a hydrogen production process in the industry, emits a large amount of CO2 [25–27]. Producing hydrogen by thermochemical water splitting requires a temperature higher than 1200 °C [28,29]. CL-SMR is capable of producing relatively pure hydrogen at a lower temperature (800–850 °C) than this and reducing CO2 emissions, which is advantageous in terms of both environmental and energy consumption aspects. However, methane decomposition can cause the H2/CO ratio of the syngas generated in the reduction step to deviate from 2, and the purity of hydrogen produced in the regeneration step may decrease due to the carbon formation [30]. Furthermore, the efficiency of CL-SMR varies widely depending on the type of oxygen carrier. A suitable oxygen carrier for CL-SMR should have both high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and the reactivity of oxygen species toward methane to produce syngas. Furthermore, it should maintain its regenerability by steam to produce a large amount of highly-concentrated hydrogen. Complex metal oxides [31–33], ceria-based oxides such as Ce-Fe [34,35] and Ce-Zr [36], and perovskite-type oxides [30,37–40] were investigated as an oxygen carrier for CL-SMR process. However, most of the experiments were conducted at a relatively high temperature of 800–850 °C and research on oxygen carriers with long-term stability and good performance at lower temperature have rarely been reported. Therefore, this study investigates a low-temperature CL-SMR process for enhanced hydrogen and syngas productivity and excellent stability by the substitution of transition metal on the B-site of LaCoO3. The substitution element on the perovskite increases electronic imbalance, which leads to an increased amount of electron vacancy and oxygen storage capacity [22,41,42]. LaCoO3 and LaCo0.6B0.4O3 (B = Fe, Mn, Ni) samples are synthesized as oxygen carriers for the CL-SMR process. Over the repeated redox cycles, it is shown that the samples substituted with the transition metal have higher syngas selectivity and steam regeneration degree than LaCoO3. The relationship between syngas selectivity and lattice oxygen transfer are determined by the H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) and in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (in-situ XPS) analyses are conducted to understand the oxygen mobility, surface oxygen species and the oxidation mechanism of reduced perovskites by steam. These tests revealed that the LaCo0.6Fe0.4O3 sample has the highest syngas selectivity, hydrogen purity and productivity. It also provides the best stability among all the samples because it shows the highest regeneration degree by steam for the low-temperature CL-SMR at 700 °C."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of the oxygen carriers,"2.1 Synthesis of the oxygen carriers LaCoO3, LaCo0.6Fe0.4O3 (LCF), LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3 (LCM), and LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3 (LCN) were synthesized via a modified Pechini method [43]. Stoichiometric amounts of La(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (≥97%, Daejung), Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (≥97%, Sigma-Aldrich), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water. The solution was then heated to 50 °C and stirred for 30 min. After that, citric acid (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the solution (molar ratio of citric acid : total metal cations = 2:1) and was stirred for another 30 min at the same temperature. For the sol–gel production, ethylene glycol (99.5%, Samchun Pure Chemical Co.) was added to the solution (molar ratio of ethylene glycol : citric acid = 2:1) and heated to 80 °C with 140 min of stirring. The obtained gel was fully dried in a 100 °C oven. For the calcination, the dried sample was loaded in the furnace. The temperature of the furnace was raised to 450 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min and maintained for 4 h. The temperature was then raised to 900 °C with the same ramping rate and maintained for 6 h to completely anneal the sample. All of the calcination processes were carried out in a condition of 80 mL/min of dry air."
3,Oxygen carrier characterization,"2.2 Oxygen carrier characterization In order to identify the crystal phases of synthesized oxygen carriers, high resolution powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) operating at 45 kV and 200 mA. The diffraction patterns were recorded for 2θ = 20–80˚ with a scanning rate of 5˚/min. The obtained data were processed by the PDXL program. The transition of chemical states of elements were measured by in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (in-situ XPS, Axis-Supra, Kratos), which is equipped with a microfused monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source. The measured samples were completely reduced by hydrogen and partially reoxidized by steam at 700 °C. After collecting the data at room temperature, the sample temperature was raised to 300 °C and the data was collected. The obtained data were analyzed through Avantage software."
4,CL-SMR experiments,"2.3 CL-SMR experiments CL-SMR experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed inconel reactor (i.d. = 9.8 mm) to measure the performance of the oxygen carriers. 600 mg of oxygen carrier was packed in the reactor with quartz wools, and the reactor was then heated to 700 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min by an electric furnace. For the methane reduction step, 7 mL/min of CH4 (99.9%, Air Products Korea) gas was injected into the reactor for 20 min with 20 mL/min N2 (99.999%, Air Products Korea) as a carrier gas. The purge step was then carried out with 20 mL/min N2 for 10 min. For the steam regeneration step, 0.05 mL/min of water flowed out constantly, and the water was vaporized in the electric furnace at 350 °C. The vaporized steam was injected into the reactor for 20 min with 40 mL/min N2 as a carrier gas. The same purge step as above was implemented after that. All steps were repeated for 5 cycles (20 cycles for the extended operation stability test). The product stream after removing the unreacted steam was analyzed. H2 was analyzed by an infrared gas analyzer (Fuji Electric System, ZRJ-6) and all other gases were analyzed by a thermal conductivity (Fuji Electric System, ZAF-4). Apart from the gases which were injected to the reactor, 600 mL/min of N2 directly entered into the gas analyzer to satisfy the limit of measurement (0–3 vol% for CO2 and CH4, 0–5 vol% for CO, O2, and H2). The scheme of the overall reaction system can be found in the Supplementary Data (Fig. S1). To analyze the results of CL-SMR experiment and determine the performance of oxygen carriers, CO selectivity, H2/CO ratio, H2 purity were calculated by the following equations. (6) C O s e l e c t i v i t y % = moles of CO in the product of r eduction step moles of CO and CO 2 i n t h e p r o d u c t o f r e d u c t i o n s t e p × 100 % (7) H 2 / C O r a t i o = moles of H 2 i n t h e p r o d u c t o f r e d u c t i o n s t e p moles of CO i n the product of reduction step (8) H 2 p u r i t y ( % ) = moles of H 2 i n t h e p r o d u c t o f r e g e n e r a t i o n s t e p moles of ( C O + CO 2 + H 2 ) i n t h e p r o d u c t o f r e g e n e r a t i o n s t e p × 100 %"
5,H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),"2.4 H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) H2-TPR measurements were carried out to reveal the behavior of oxygen in the methane reduction step. 100 mg of fresh oxygen carrier was packed in the quartz reactor and sealed with quartz wools. 10 mL/min of H2 (99.999%, Air Products Korea) balanced with 20 mL/min N2 (99.999%, Air Products Korea) was injected to the reactor. After the stabilization, the reactor was heated to 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Unreacted hydrogen was analyzed by an infrared gas analyzer (Fuji Electric System, ZRJ-6)."
6,O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD),"2.5 O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) O2-TPD was conducted using an AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation) equipped with TCD. Firstly, 0.4 g of each sample was packed into a U-type quartz tube and sealed with quartz wools. The temperature was then increased to 700 °C with a ramping rate of 30 °C/min, and the sample was pretreated for 1 h in hydrogen (10% H2/Ar, Korea Nano Gas) at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. After the pretreatment, the temperature was cooled to 60 °C under the same hydrogen flow, and the gas channel was changed to oxygen (10% O2/He, Korea Nano Gas) with the same flow rate. The sample was exposed for 30 min at these conditions. Lastly, the purge gas was changed to pure helium (50 mL/min, 99.999%, Air Products Korea), and the sample was heated to 900 °C at a ramp of 30 °C/min and maintained at 900 °C for 1 h. The signals were gathered to form the TPD spectrum."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structure of the perovskites,"3.1 Structure of the perovskites Fig. 2 (a) shows the crystalline structure of synthesized LaCoO3, LaCo0.6Fe0.4O3 (LCF), LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3 (LCM), and LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3 (LCN) that was identified by XRD. The four crystal structures were matched with the PDF card of LaCoO3 (PDF number: 01-074-4183). In particular, the structure of LaCoO3 was perfectly matched with the reference without any other impurity peak. The transition metal-substituted samples also retained the structure with a slight peak shift and it could be observed in detail in Fig. 2(b). Thus, it was confirmed that the perovskite structure was precisely fabricated and the crystal structure did not change even when another transition metal was substituted at the B-site."
9,CL-SMR with LaCoO3 and transition metal-substituted LaCoO3,"3.2 CL-SMR with LaCoO3 and transition metal-substituted LaCoO3 In order to understand the effect of the B-site substitution element on the activity of CL-SMR, the CO production amount, selectivity, and hydrogen purity data for each cycle of LaCoO3 and various transition metal-substituted samples are summarized in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3(a) shows the amount of CO production in the methane reduction step. First of all, LaCoO3 produced the largest amount among the four samples at the 1st cycle but it decreased significantly as the redox cycle was repeated (CO_5th/CO_1st = 13.47%). This deactivation phenomenon was not caused by the carbon deposition because both CO and CO2 were hardly observed in the data of the steam regeneration step (Fig. S2). In addition, the hydrogen production amount of LaCoO3 was significantly lower than that of LCM and LCF (Figs. S2–S4). As mentioned above, since the reduced samples were reoxidized in the steam regeneration step and hydrogen was produced accordingly, the small amount of hydrogen production in LaCoO3 could explain its incomplete regeneration by steam. Thus, it can be determined that the reduced LaCoO3 was not regenerated properly by steam and the required lattice oxygen for the syngas production was not sufficient in the oxygen carrier. On the other hand, LCM and LCF maintained their productivity up to the 5th cycle, which means that they can be regenerated by steam more effectively than LaCoO3. It is impressive that substituting the transition metal on the LaCoO3 can dramatically enhance the regenerability toward steam. With LCN, while the CO production increased with repeated cycles, the amount of CO production was much lower than with LCF and LCM. For the CO selectivity, LCF and LCM remained higher than 91%, while the selectivity on LCN was lower than 78%. While LaCoO3 showed higher CO selectivity than LCN at the 1st cycle, it decreased dramatically with the repeated redox cycle. The hydrogen purity in the steam regeneration step demonstrated that the LCF remarkably maintained a 99.3% level and had a superior purity compared to the other samples. LaCoO3 also showed high purity, but it was lower than LCF. The difference in the hydrogen purity was due to the unidentical amount of carbon deposition in the respective samples during the methane reduction step because the deposited cokes from methane decomposition directly gasified with steam during the regeneration step, which produced CO or CO2. The real-time H2/CO ratio with LCM and LCN deviated significantly from a ratio of 2 after a certain period of time (see Figs. S4 and S5), while LCF maintained the H2/CO ratio of 2 (Fig. S3), which further demonstrates the least carbon deposition on LCF from CH4 decomposition. Thus, substituting Fe or Mn can significantly enhance steam regeneration in the oxidation step with negligible carbon deposition in the reduction step while LaCoO3 showed poor steam regenerability. LCF displayed the highest hydrogen purity of 99.3% with stable syngas production, and LCM showed the highest CO productivity. Therefore, extended operation stability tests were performed for 20 cycles on LCF and LCM."
10,Extended operation stability test,"3.3 Extended operation stability test Fig. 4 shows the results of the extended operation stability tests for both LCF and LCM samples. The syngas and hydrogen production amounts are summarized in Fig. 4(a) to (d). In detail, while the productivity of syngas and hydrogen of LCM was higher than that of LCF at the early step, there was no significant difference at the end of the cycle. This was because LCF maintained 70% of CO production and 80% of hydrogen production at the 20th cycle compared to the 1st cycle (Table 1 ), whereas LCM maintained the production rate of 54.5% of CO and 52.6% of hydrogen based on the 1st cycle. After the 10th cycle, 97% of CO and 99% of hydrogen production were maintained through additional ten cycles, which means that the productivity of syngas and highly-concentrated hydrogen on LCF was stabilized after the 10th cycle. Furthermore, the H2/CO ratios in the second y-axis of Fig. 4(a) and (b) show that LCF maintained a H2/CO ratio of 1.9 to 2.05 from the first to the last cycle while the LCM recorded a significantly deviated H2/CO ratio from 2 in the early cycle. Therefore, it is clear that LCF is the most advantageous oxygen carrier in terms of the stable CL-SMR operation. Fig. 4(e) and (f) portray the selectivity of CO produced in the reduction step and the purity of hydrogen produced in the regeneration step. The CO selectivity of the two samples was similar in the early cycle, but the CO selectivity of LCM decreased after the 8th cycle, while LCF demonstrated a steady CO selectivity. As a result, at the 20th cycle, LCF maintained 92% of CO selectivity while the LCM selectivity declined to 85%. The hydrogen purity in Fig. 4(f) has the opposite tendency compared with the CO selectivity. With the decline of CO selectivity in LCM, the hydrogen purity rose over the cycles and was maintained at that level after the 10th cycle. That stems from the fact that the degree of methane decomposition in the reduction step decreased as the redox cycle progressed and the hydrogen purity reached 93% at the 20th cycle, but the value was still lower than that of LCF because of certain amounts of coke deposition in LCM. On the other hand, LCF maintained the highest hydrogen purity of 99.3% throughout the 20 repeated cycles, and the hydrogen production also remained at 2.22 mmol/g oxygen carrier after the 10th cycle. Considering all our experimental results, LaCo0.6Fe0.4O3 (LCF) proved to be the most promising oxygen carrier for the low-temperature CL-SMR process by utilizing the earth-abundant iron metal. Table 2 compares the CL-SMR performance of LCF with the results from the prior studies for hydrogen production experiments. Specifically, CL-SMR was mostly performed at 850 °C. Even if their hydrogen productivity was quite higher (1.69–6.39 mmol/gcat) than that in our study, most of them presented a low hydrogen purity and their operation temperature was much higher than that of our study (700 °C). Furthermore, the experimental results at 800 °C demonstrated that the amount of produced hydrogen in the steam regeneration step (0.89–1.88 mmol/gcat) was lower than our productivity at 700 °C. Since the oxygen carrier synthesized in this study provided a higher amount of hydrogen production and purity (2.22 mmol/g oxygen carrier with 99.3% purity) with a lower temperature of 700 °C than the previous studies, it presents new potentials for the low-temperature CL-SMR."
11,H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),"3.4 H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) In order to obtain fundamental insights into the above experimental results and to propose the mechanism of CL-SMR, various analyses have been conducted. At first, H2-TPR measurements were performed on LaCoO3 and its transition metal-substituted samples to understand the phenomena occurring inside the oxygen carrier in the reduction step. Fig. 5 shows the rate of hydrogen consumption during the H2-TPR measurement. When the metal oxide sample is reduced by hydrogen, the surface oxygen is generally more active than the lattice oxygen, so it reacts rapidly with hydrogen, which represents as peaks at low temperature. Also, the lattice oxygen reacts only after they migrates to the surface, thereby the peaks emerge at relatively high temperature [46,47]. Therefore, each graph can be divided into two large peaks of hydrogen consumption: one low-temperature peak corresponding to surface oxygen and the other high temperature peak corresponding to the reduction in the lattice [48,49]. The temperature of the latter peak differed depending on the substituted transition metal, which displays the different trends of the lattice oxygen transfer to the surface. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the Ni-substituted LaCoO3 showed the lowest temperature of lattice reduction and the Mn- or Fe-substituted sample had a higher temperature than LaCoO3. Since the low temperature of the peak presents the easy transfer of lattice oxygen to the surface, the lattice oxygen transfer of LCN was more facilitated than that of LaCoO3, while the transfer on LCM and LCF were lowered. According to our previous study that described the correlation of CO selectivity with the lattice oxygen transfer [43], the surface oxygen vacancies were rapidly filled as the transfer of lattice oxygen occurred easily, which led to an abundance of oxygen on the surface and the full oxidation of methane. On the other hand, when the transfer of lattice oxygen occurred moderately, the oxygen vacancies on the surface were not completely filled and the partial oxidation of methane mainly occurred. Therefore, the substitution of Ni lowers CO selectivity while the substitution of Mn or Fe enhances CO selectivity, which is consistent with the experimental results of this study (Fig. 3(b)). The CO selectivity of LaCoO3 decreased with the cycle repetition because the regeneration of lattice oxygen did not occur completely."
12,O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD),"3.5 O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) O2-TPD was performed on the three samples to analyze the oxidation mechanism of reduced perovskites by steam, and Fig. 6 presents the O2-TPD results for LaCoO3, LCF, and LCM. Each sample consists of two peaks where the low-temperature peak corresponds to α-oxygen, a weakly adsorbed oxygen species on the surface oxygen vacancies and the intermediate peak for α'-oxygen, an oxygen species that exists at subsurface between the surface and lattice, respectively [50–52]. The relationship between these two species can be analyzed to infer a different mechanism during regeneration by steam. Firstly, LCF and LCM had more α'-oxygen and a higher relative ratio to α-oxygen than LaCoO3. This means that the ratio of oxygen penetrated to the lattice was higher during regeneration in LCF and LCM. This explanation can be supplemented by analyzing the peak temperature of α'-oxygen. The peak temperature of α'-oxygen on LCF (330 °C) and LCM (386 °C) was much lower than LaCoO3 (516 °C), which means that the mobility of the oxygen species is improved in Fe- or Mn-metal substituted samples compared to LaCoO3 [53]. Thus, when reoxidizing the reduced oxygen carrier, the oxygen species on the surface was easily transferred to the lattice and regenerated. Therefore, the regeneration by steam was further facilitated, which was visually confirmed through the enhanced CO production in the methane reduction step as shown in Fig. 3."
13,In-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (In-situ XPS),"3.6 In-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (In-situ XPS) To reveal the water splitting and oxygen regeneration, the XPS spectra of the reoxidized LaCoO3 and LCF with steam at 700 °C were collected at room temperature and 300 °C. Fig. 7 shows the O 1s spectra of in-situ XPS measured at room temperature and 300 °C. As can be represented in the figure, the hydroxide peak of the LCF was observed at room temperature, but disappeared when the temperature was raised to 300 °C. On the other hand, LaCoO3 hardly showed the hydroxide peak and there was no particular change with the temperature rise. Therefore, it can be said that substituting Fe facilitates the adsorption and decomposition of the hydroxide on the surface. Also, steam splitting hardly occurred in LaCoO3, but increased dramatically with Fe substitution. Thus, it can be concluded that steam splitting was possible due to the adsorption and decomposition of hydroxyl group on the surface of LCF. Fig. 8 describes the Fe 3p spectra of the LCF sample. Generally, Fe 3p spectra can be divided to two peaks, where one peak with higher binding energy corresponds to Fe3+ and the other peak with lower binding energy is associated with Fe2+ [54]. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show that Fe is more oxidized with the temperature increase from room temperature to 300 °C because the relative ratio of Fe3+ peak was increased. It means that the Fe oxidation state was increased even though the hydroxyl group (OH-) was removed. It can be interpreted that oxygen remained at the Fe site during the removal of hydroxyl group, and the oxidation state of Fe increased accordingly. Therefore, the increase in the oxidation state of Fe itself means that the hydroxyl group was adsorbed and decomposed on the Fe-site, which is an evidence that Fe directly participated in the steam splitting process. In addition, the steam splitting barely happened in non-substituted LaCoO3, which further supports that Fe acts as an active site for steam splitting. Also, for continuous steam splitting, oxygen should be transferred to lattice from the oxidized surface to maintain the surface sites reduced. This is because when the metal is fully oxidized, the hydroxyl group cannot adsorbed and thus the steam split cannot proceed. According to the O2-TPD graph (Fig. 6), LCF showed lower peak temperature and higher intensity of α'-oxygen than LaCoO3, corresponding to the adsorbed oxygen on the subsurface. Therefore, oxygen could be more easily transferred from the surface to the bulk, which facilitates oxygen regeneration. This was also increased markedly with Fe substitution. Thus, it can be concluded that substituted Fe acts as an active site for water splitting and oxygen regeneration. According to Wang et al. [55] and our in-situ XPS result, mechanism of H2O splitting with H2 desorption for the material with perovskite structure can be proposed as follows: 1) H2O is dissociated from the surface of the perovskite to H and OH. 2) H is adsorbed on the non-reducible La-O site to form La-OH. 3) OH is adsorbed to the transition metal site to form B-OH. 4) Hydrogen is released through the process La-OH + B-OH → La-O + B-O + H2. In the overall mechanism, the hydroxyl group generated from the dissociation of H2O adsorbed on the transition metal site and removed with remaining oxygen at the site with hydrogen formation. Thus, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, as the sample temperature rise, the hydroxide peak of LCF disappeared while the oxidation state of Fe increased."
14,Proposed mechanism of CL-SMR,"3.7 Proposed mechanism of CL-SMR The results obtained from the CL-SMR experiments and various analyses propose a mechanism that represents the behavior of LaCoO3 and the transition metal-substituted samples. The schemes for the proposed reaction mechanism are organized in Fig. 9 . As can be seen in Fig. 9(a), the steam regeneration step on LaCoO3 showed that the hydrogen production did not clearly occur because of the lack of hydroxide adsorption, as illustrated by the O 1s spectra results of in-situ XPS in Fig. 7. The analysis data of O2-TPD in Fig. 6 also showed that the regeneration of lattice oxygen occurred poorly in LaCoO3, which confirms that oxygen species on the surface hardly transfer to the lattice. The reason for the low CO selectivity in the methane reduction step was found in the results of H2-TPR: The lattice oxygen moved easily to the surface, creating an oxygen sufficient environment at the surface. The mechanism of LCF arranged in Fig. 9(b) demonstrates that all the drawbacks of LaCoO3 have been overcome. The results of in-situ XPS demonstrated the favorable adsorption and decomposition of the hydroxide facilitated the hydrogen production. In addition, the oxidation state of Fe increased with the process, and thus Fe proved to be an active site for steam splitting. O2-TPD further confirmed that the regenerated oxygen through H2O splitting was easily transferred from the surface to the lattice. The high CO selectivity in the methane reduction step was also explained through the H2-TPR measurements because inadequate filling of surface oxygen vacancies from the low transfer of lattice oxygen via Fe substitution facilitates the partial oxidation of methane. As a result, LCF showed the highest performance in various aspects such as hydrogen production and syngas selectivity, and thus it was shown to be the most suitable oxygen carrier for low-temperature CL-SMR."
15,Conclusions,"This work has studied the effect of transition metal substitution at the B-site of LaCoO3 on methane reforming and water splitting. LaCoO3, LaCo0.6Fe0.4O3 (LCF), LaCo0.6Mn0.4O3 (LCM), and LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3 (LCN) were synthesized and a cyclic redox experiment was conducted to investigate the overall performance of the prepared samples and the effect of transition metal substitution. While LaCoO3 was not regenerated properly by steam, the transition metal-substituted samples showed its significant regeneration and water splitting to hydrogen. Among them, LCF had the highest performance for hydrogen purity and production rate while LCM showed the highest performance for CO production. The extended operation stability test over the 20 cycles demonstrated that LCF has higher stability, CO selectivity, and hydrogen purity than LCM. In particular, LCF steadily retained a hydrogen purity of 99.3% with 2.22 mmol of H2/g after the 10th cycle. H2-TPR revealed that the enhanced CO selectivity in the Mn or Fe substituted samples originated from the lowered lattice oxygen transfer to surface oxygen vacancies. In addition, the O2-TPD and in-situ XPS analyses confirmed that the substitution of the transition metal improved the regeneration through the favorable adsorption and the decomposition of the hydroxide and the increased oxygen mobility from the surface to the lattice. The substitution of the earth-abundant iron element at the B-site of LaCoO3 (LaCo0.6Fe0.4O3) is the most promising oxygen carrier in the low-temperature CL-SMR for enhancing the productivity of syngas and highly-concentrated hydrogen."
