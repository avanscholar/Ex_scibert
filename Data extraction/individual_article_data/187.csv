0,Introduction,"Recently, significant progress has been achieved in the preparation of nano-structured materials by utilizing the so-called nano-casting route [1,2]. According to this method, an ordered porous carbon or silica matrix acts as nano-scopic mold, which restricts, through confinement, the formation and growth of metal or metal oxide species [3–6]. Various nano-objects such as nano-particles, nano-wires, or nano-structured networks can form selectively in the voids of porous silica, and have potential applications such as catalysts [7–9], new materials for gas sensors [10,11], and precursors of anode materials in Li-ion rechargeable batteries [10,12] because of their large specific surface areas and shape-selective properties, which enhance the efficiency of catalysis, conduction, and adsorption. Ethyl alcohol is preferable as the hydrogen resources for the fuel cells compared with other resources since it can be easily produced from biomass by fermentation [13]. The most effective process for hydrogen production from ethyl alcohol is the steam reforming reaction, C2H5OH+3H2O→2CO2 +6H2. For this reaction, Co- [14–17], Ni- [18–21], or Rh- [22,23] based catalysts exhibited high activities, whereas a high reaction temperature (>623K) is required to obtain high hydrogen yield, and CO is generated as by-product, which should be removed to prevent from the poisoning of electrode catalysts of fuel cells. On the other hand, there have been limited examples of indium catalysts thus far; only some composite catalysts including indium as a promoter or co-catalyst have been reported [24–26]. Here we report the first high performance single-component indium oxide catalysts for the steam reforming of ethyl alcohol, which produces hydrogen with low CO concentration at low temperature."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Commercial and prepared In2O3 catalysts were used for the steam reforming of ethyl alcohol. The commercial In2O3 catalyst was purchased from Mitsuwa Chem. Co. Two nano-structured In2O3 catalysts were prepared with mesoporous KIT-6 [27,28] and MCM-41 [29,30] silicas as templates. The KIT-6 template was prepared according to the reported procedure [27,28], while MCM-41 was commercially purchased (Aldrich Chem. Co.). The templates were immersed in 0.1M aqueous solution of indium nitrate (Kishida Chem. Co.) for 2h. After drying at 393K, the samples were calcined in air at 623K for 3h. Nano-structured In2O3 materials were obtained through the solution etching of silica framework by a 1.0M NaOH aqueous solution. The resulting materials were then centrifugally separated, washed with distilled water to pH 7, and dried at 383K."
3,Characterization of catalysts,2.2 Characterization of catalysts Powder XRD measurements were performed on a RINT2200 diffractometer (Rigaku) equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray tube operating at 40kV and 40mA at a scanning rate of 0.02°s−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out on a H-9000NA equipment (Hitachi). Specific surface areas of the In2O3 catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption on a Quantasorb Jr equipment (Quantachrome Co.). The catalysts were outgassed at 473K prior to N2 adsorption. The surface areas were calculated by the BET method using the N2 adsorption isotherm at 77K. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired with an ESCA-3400 spectrometer (Simadzu) equipped with a Mg Kα X-ray exciting source (1253.6eV) operating at 10kV and 10mA. The binding energies (BE) were referred to the C 1s peak at 284.9eV.
4,Evaluation of catalytic performance,"2.3 Evaluation of catalytic performance The In2O3 catalysts (65mg) held in L-shaped quartz tubes were loaded in a fixed-bed flow reactor (TPR-5D, Bell Japan Inc.). The catalytic activity measurements were performed with an electrically heated reactor equipped with a thermocouple that allowed temperature measurement inside the catalytic bed. A flow of 0.4% C2H5OH/1.6% H2O in N2 stream (molar ratio) was introduced into the reactor with a rate of 50mLmin−1 at 498, 523, 548, 573, and 623K. The C2H5OH–H2O liquid mixture was supplied by a syringe pump (KD Science) and vaporized at 403K, and then mixed with the N2 flow and introduced into the reactor. Effluent gas was analyzed by two on-line microgas chromatographs, GC3000A and M-200H (Agilent), equipped with TC detectors for 10h at each reaction temperature. An induction time was first observed for each catalyst and then the catalytic activity was kept constant. GC3000A is equipped with Porapak Q for separating CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, CH3CHO, and C2H5OH, and Molecular Sieve 5A for separating H2, CO, and CH4. M-200H is equipped with Porapak Q for separating C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, and CH3COCH3, and Molecular Sieve 5A for separating CO and CH4. The detection limit of CO is <50ppm."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows XRD profiles of the commercial and prepared In2O3 catalysts. The commercial In2O3 catalyst shows sharp peaks, whereas the nano-structured In2O3 catalysts prepared with the KIT-6 and MCM-41 silica templates exhibit broadened diffraction peaks at the same positions, indicating that the commercial In2O3 catalyst has high crystallinity and the prepared nano-structured In2O3 catalysts have lower crystallinities. Fig. 2 shows TEM images of the commercial and prepared nano-structured In2O3 catalysts. In comparison with the commercial one (Fig. 2a), a mesoporous structure was observed for the In2O3 catalyst prepared using the KIT-6 template, which has a 3D mesopore structure; the pore diameter (7.5nm) of the mesoporous In2O3 corresponds to the wall thickness of the KIT-6 template and the wall thickness (2.0–3.0nm) of In2O3 corresponds to the pore diameter of the KIT-6 template. On the other hand, not a mesoporous but worm-like structure was observed for the In2O3 catalyst prepared using the MCM-41 template, reflecting the 1D channel structure for the template [29,30]. The diameter of worm-like In2O3 catalyst (2.5nm) corresponds to the 1D pore diameter of the MCM-41 template (3.4–4.0nm) [30]. BET measurement reveals that the commercial In2O3 catalyst with a high crystallinity has a surface area of 7m2 g−1. The mesoporous In2O3 catalyst has higher surface area (107m2 g−1) and the worm-like In2O3 catalyst has the highest value (173m2 g−1), in agreement with their low crystallinities as observed by powder XRD measurements."
7,Catalyst activity,"3.2 Catalyst activity All the catalysts show conversions of ethyl alcohol at the same levels at each temperature (Fig. 3 ). In comparison with the commercial In2O3 catalyst, the mesoporous In2O3 catalyst gives higher hydrogen production rates at all the temperatures (Fig. 4 ). The worm-like In2O3 catalyst prepared with the MCM-41 template shows the highest hydrogen production rates at all the temperatures. The product distribution reflects the differences in the catalytically active sites on the surfaces of the catalysts with different structures. Table 1 shows the product selectivities over the In2O3 catalysts at 498–623K. The commercial In2O3 catalyst mainly affords the dehydrate product C2H4 at low temperatures (Eq (1)) (1) C2H5OH→C2H4 +H2O It is noted that ethyl alcohol is converted without hydrogen production via this reaction route and dehydration is the undesirable path for hydrogen production. In contrast, the mesoporous (KIT-6) and the worm-like (MCM-41) In2O3 catalysts mainly afford the products H2, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3. It is proposed that CH3CHO is generated by the dehydrogenation of ethyl alcohol (Eq. (2)) [31]. The CH3CHO may be further converted to CH3COCH3 via aldol condensation with hydrogen production (Eq. (3)) [31]. (2) C2H5OH→CH3CHO+H2 (3) 2CH3CHO+H2O→CO2 +CH3COCH3 +2H2 It is noted that hydrogen is produced in reaction (2) and (3). The reaction (3) was also observed over CuO/CeO2 [31], Fe2O3/ZnO [32], and ZnO/CaO [33,34]. Fig. 5 shows the In 3d XPS spectra of worm-like In2O3 catalysts before and after reaction at 573K. The characteristic spin–orbit split 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 signals are attributed to In2O3 [35–37]. No marked differences were observed for the samples before and after the reaction, suggesting that In2O3 is the active phase for the reforming reaction of ethyl alcohol. In addition, peak areas of the C 1s XPS spectra of worm-like In2O3 catalysts keep unchanged before and after the reaction, suggesting negligible amount of coke formation on the worm-like In2O3 catalyst. Over the present In2O3 catalysts, no CO impurity was detected within the detection limit (<50ppm). In contrast, it was previously reported that Co-, Ni-, and Rh-based catalysts yield high concentration CO by-product up to 8%. It was suggested that the reverse water-gas shift reaction of CO2 and H2, the products of the steam reforming of ethyl alcohol, produces CO as by-product on the Co, Ni, and Ir/CeO2 catalysts (Eq. (4)) [38]. (4) CO2 +H2 →CO+H2O The absence of CO in the present experiments may be due to the low activity of the In2O3 catalysts for the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
8,Conclusions,"Mesoporous and worm-like In2O3 catalysts have been prepared using KIT-6 and MCM-41 silicas as templates, which have low crystallinities and high surface areas. These two nano-structured In2O3 catalysts exhibit high hydrogen production rate from ethyl alcohol at low temperatures. The In2O3 catalysts yield low-concentration CO impurity, presenting an advantage in comparison with previous reported catalysts."
