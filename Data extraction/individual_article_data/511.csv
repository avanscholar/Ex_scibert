0,Introduction,"In the viewpoint of hydrogen production, alcohols represent an emerging source since they can be produced renewably from biomass [1,2]. Among them, bio-ethanol constitutes an important source that seems to be particularly suitable due to its easy and broadly implemented production from a variety of plants. Also, bio-glycerol is the main byproduct of biodiesel obtained via transesterification of vegetable oils. Biodiesel production, as a surrogate of fossil diesel, could be more economical viable using glycerol as a value added product. Thus, it could be directly used for producing hydrogen. Alcohol catalytic reforming processes aimed to the production of hydrogen have been widely reported in the literature [3,4]. More recently, alcohols and renewable bio-alcohols have been used in photochemical processes [5–10]. Although the hydrogen yields reported in catalytic reforming are higher than those obtained by photocatalytic routes, the later is receiving particular attention because is based on the Sun, which is a perpetual source of energy, and it is an environmentally safe technology operating at ambient conditions without undesirable byproducts. Photocatalytic processes are based on electron–hole pairs that are generated in semiconductors upon bandgap excitation by light. Depending on the excitation lifetime relative to that of charge recombination a net fraction of photocharges are present, which are trapped at defect sites or migrate toward the photocatalyst surface. These surface electrons and holes can reduce and oxidize surface adsorbed molecules, respectively. TiO2-based photocatalysts are among the most attractive due to their availability, corrosion resistance, non-toxicity, low price and high photoactivity and stability. Incorporating organics such as alcohols as sacrificial electron donors into the photocatalytic process increase charge-separation efficiency and give higher H2 generation rates [6–10]. The rate of hydrogen evolution is much higher, compared to that obtained in the absence of organics in the irradiated photocatalyst, due to the irreversible oxidation of the organic molecule with photogenerated holes and the concomitant suppression of electron–hole recombination and H2–O2 back reaction, which are the most important processes for decreasing the light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. The effect of the addition of noble metal nanoparticles (cocatalyst) to TiO2 is well known as it considerably increases the hydrogen production rate [5]. Deposition of Au nanoparticles onto TiO2 has been found to enhance hydrogen production by facilitating electron transfer and therefore inhibiting electron–hole recombination as well as by reducing the overpotentials for H2 generation [7–10]. It is important to recall that, whereas photocatalyst development constitutes an active area of research, if photons are not effectively transmitted to the photocatalyst then its full potential will not be reached and system efficiency will be lowered [11]. Slurry photoreactors, which are the most used in photocatalysis research in liquid phase, facilitate mass transfer, but they are limited by poor light penetration in the suspension. In many photoreactor designs (slurry reactors, annular reactors, spinning disk reactors, optical tube reactors and immersion reactors) the light has to travel through the fluid containing reagents and also through a transparent wall. In addition, it is very difficult to achieve uniform irradiance on the entire catalyst surface, which is critical because a minimum energy level is needed to activate the photocatalyst. Once the photocatalyst is activated, maximized contact between the photocatalyst and reagents should be achieved, as well as removal of the reaction products formed. An ideally intensified photoreactor should thus be able to integrate both maximized light efficiency and mass transfer simultaneously. We have recently reported photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from gaseous water–ethanol mixtures in an optical fiber honeycomb reactor, where Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were immobilized on the monolith walls [12]. With this configuration, high light efficiency and availability combined with optimum mass transfer and scale-up potential was achieved. In this work, we extend our work on photocatalytic production of hydrogen in optical fiber honeycomb reactors by studying their performance in liquid phase with a variety of bio-related alcohols. Different mixtures of water and alcohol (methanol, ethanol, glycerol, bio-ethanol and bio-glycerol) have been tested over 1wt.% Au/TiO2. We have used dendrimer-protected pre-formed Au nanoparticles to ensure a constant Au nanoparticle size and to prevent Au agglomeration [13,14]."
1,Experimental,
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation Cordierite (Al4Mg2Si5O18) honeycombs (Rauschert, 100 cells per square inch, pore volume 210±30mm3 g−1, average pore diameter 3±1.5μm) measuring 16mm in diameter and 20mm length were used. They contained exactly 21 square channels with 2.1mm channel width. The preparation of the Au/TiO2 photocatalytic monoliths involved two steps. First, the honeycombs were coated with a pure TiO2 layer by soaking them into pure titanium isopropoxide, Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4, dried under continuous rotation and calcined at 723K for 4h (10Kmin−1). Titania mass was monitored by weight gain and was 30±5mg, which corresponds to a catalyst loading of about 0.7mgcm2. Gold nanoparticles were loaded onto the TiO2 layer by incipient wetness impregnation from a toluene solution containing pre-formed Au nanoparticles measuring ca. 2.5nm and capped with thiol-derived carboxilane dendrons HS(CH2)3Si((CH2)3Si(CH3)3)3, which were prepared as reported previously [13]. The Au loading was 1wt.% with respect to TiO2. Honeycombs were finally calcined at 673K for 2h (2Kmin−1) to eliminate the carboxilane dendron shell and to assure a tight contact between the Au nanoparticles and the TiO2 support. This temperature was selected following a detailed in situ XPS and HRTEM study reported in [15]. After calcination the monoliths exhibited the characteristic purple color of Au/TiO2 containing small Au nanoparticles."
3,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.2 Photocatalyst characterization Surface area measurements (BET) of the TiO2 powders were carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus after degassing at 443K. The photocatalytic Au/TiO2 cordierite honeycombs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD patterns were collected between 10° and 90° of 2θ with a step width of 0.02° and a step time of 1s using a Bruker D8 instrument equipped with Cu Kα incident radiation and a graphite monochromator. HRTEM was carried out with a JEOL J2010F electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun operating at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Samples were dispersed in alcohol in an ultrasonic bath and a drop of supernatant suspension was poured onto a holey carbon coated grid. UV–vis reflectance spectra were collected with a Shimadzu UV3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere. XPS was performed on a SPECS system equipped with an Al anode XR50 source operating at 150mW and a Phoibos 150 MCD-9 detector. The pass energy of the hemispherical analyzer was set at 25eV and the energy step was set at 0.1eV. Charge stabilization was achieved by using a SPECS Flood Gun FG 15/40. The binding energy (BE) values were referred to the C 1s peak at 284.8eV. Stability of the optical fibers was checked before and after the photocatalytic tests by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a Zeiss NEON40 crossbeam instrument operating at 5kV."
4,Photoreaction experiments,"2.3 Photoreaction experiments The optical fiber catalytic wall reactor used in this work was described in detail in [12]. The light source consisted on four high efficiency UV LEDs emitting at a wavelength of 365±5nm (12W, 0.7A) coupled to a bunch of optical fibers (Fig. 1 ). The optical fibers measured 0.8mm in diameter and were made of PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)). The fibers were originally coated to avoid light losses, so they were treated individually to obtain lateral irradiation exactly where the monoliths were placed. To attain uniform illumination, the end of the optical fibers was capped with a zinc-based paint to attain back-reflection of light. The photoreactor casing was made of glass and consisted of two pieces sealed by an O-ring that allowed an easy exchange of the photocatalytic monoliths. The nominal distance between the surface of the fiber and the honeycomb walls was 0.9±0.2mm. Photoreactions were carried out in liquid phase at 298K in batch mode (20mL). In a typical experiment, the optical fibers were first inserted into the channels of the photocatalytic monolith inside the photoreactor. Then, the photoreactor was loaded with the water–alcohol mixture and the system was purged with Ar until no air was detected and the experiment started. Agitation was provided by bubbling Ar through the liquid inside the photoreactor, which also served as sweep gas. Several alcohol–water mixtures were tested (100%, 80%, 50%, 30%, 10%, and 1% alcohol on a molar basis). The alcohols used were methanol (Panreac 99.9%), ethanol (Panreac 99.9%), glycerol (Panreac 99.5%), bio-ethanol (Deulep 96%), and bio-glycerol (from sunflower, 94%). Slurry reactor operation was carried out strictly under the same conditions by replacing the photocatalytic monolith with photocatalyst powder. The photoreactor effluent was monitored on-line every 1.5min by gas chromatography (Agilent 3000 A MicroGC) using MS 5Å, Plot U and Stabilwax columns. Light irradiation was measured directly with a UV-A radiation monitor from Solar Light Co. before and after each photocatalytic test. Blank experiments were carried out with the cordierite monolith support and no photoactivity was measured."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization The BET surface area of the TiO2 support was 41±6m2 g−1. XRD profiles showed the presence of both anatase and rutile with a ratio of anatase:rutile ∼93:7, as determined according to the method described in [16]. The microstructure of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst was studied by HRTEM and HAADF. The photocatalysts were constituted by anatase and rutile crystallites of about 20–50nm and Au nanoparticles measuring 3.8±0.5nm in diameter (Fig. 2a and b). This is slightly larger than the size of Au nanoparticles capped with carboxilane dendrons in the precursor solution (Fig. 2c) as a result of the calcination treatment, in accordance to [15]. The homogeneity in size and good dispersion of the Au nanoparticles merits to be highlighted, which are a direct consequence of the preparation method employed. UV–vis reflectance spectra showed a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au nanoparticles supported on TiO2 at about 567nm (Fig. 2d), which is fairly similar to values reported in the literature for Au nanoparticles measuring 3–5nm supported on anatase [9]. The Au 4f core-level spectra showed photoemitted electrons with binding energies at 83.7–83.9eV (Au 4f7/2) and 87.2–87.4eV (Au 4f5/2)eV, indicating that metallic Au was the only gold species on the near surface region of the photocatalysts."
7,Photocatalytic tests,"3.2 Photocatalytic tests Fig. 3 shows the results of a typical experiment over a photocatalytic 1wt.% Au/TiO2 honeycomb. In this case, the alcohol–water mixture employed was EtOH:H2O=1:1 (molar basis). After purging the system, light was turned on and, immediately, the photoproduction of H2 started and shortly after steady state was reached. By using a sweep flow gas (Ar) of 10mLmin−1 the concentration of H2 was about 0.05% and the rate of photoproduced hydrogen 11.8μmolH2 min−1 g−1. When the sweep gas flow was doubled (20mLmin−1) the concentration of hydrogen halved, but the rate of photoproduction of hydrogen was maintained. Therefore, the sweep gas flow had an effect on the concentration of hydrogen at the photoreactor outlet but no effect on the rate of photoproduction of hydrogen (no diffusion limitations). From now onwards, only the photoproduction rates will be then considered, which are independent of the sweep gas flow used. At the end of the experiment the light was turned off and the production of hydrogen stopped. However, the other products of the photoreaction (mostly acetaldehyde) remained in the outlet stream of the photoreactor since they were dissolved in the liquid medium. For that reason, no mass balance calculations were possible since the product distribution between the liquid and gas phases varied. A blank experiment with a honeycomb loaded only with TiO2 did not show appreciable hydrogen photoproduction. Also, the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst was tested under visible light in order to assess if the Au Plasmon resonance at about 567nm (Fig. 2d) contributed into the reaction, but no hydrogen was detected. Fig. 4 compiles the hydrogen photoproduction rates obtained at steady state using different alcohols and alcohol–water mixtures. For each alcohol–water mixture ratio tested, the photoproduction of hydrogen using pure methanol, ethanol and glycerol was always higher than that obtained with bio-ethanol and bio-glycerol. The amount of hydrogen photoproduced was virtually indistinguishable when comparing methanol and ethanol, and slightly higher than that obtained with glycerol. Other authors have reported [17,18] or theoretically predicted [19] higher hydrogen yields with glycerol with respect to methanol and ethanol, but in any case they all give good rates. The photoproduction of H2 from bio-ethanol was roughly 25% less than that from the pure alcohol. The lowest hydrogen photoproduced rate was obtained when using bio-glycerol, which was about 60% less than that from pure glycerol. The lower H2 photoproduction rates obtained from the bio-alcohols with respect to the pure alcohols can be explained by the presence of impurities such as aldehydes, organic acids and FAMEs. The strong adsorption of aldehydes on the surface of titania-based photocatalysts, for instance, has been shown to compete with the adsorption of alcohol molecules, lowering the overall hydrogen photoproduction rate [12,18]. Concerning the effect of the alcohol–water mixture composition on the photoproduction rate of H2, although the rate behavior as a function of alcohol concentration is shallow, it is observed that the higher the water content in the mixture the lower the H2 photoproduction rate. This has been already reported in the literature [12] and related to a beneficial effect of alcohol concentration on hole scavenging on TiO2. Interestingly, whereas the trend between alcohol concentration and H2 photoproduction rate was maintained approximately linear for the pure alcohols, a different behavior was observed for the bio-alcohols. In this case, the scavenging effect was progressively suppressed at high water concentrations (1–10% alcohol) and the photoproduction of H2 decreased markedly. Since CO2 production was almost inexistent, photo-induced reforming of alcohols was ruled out. Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen photoproduced rates at steady state obtained from the different alcohol:water=1:1 molar mixtures by using the optical fiber honeycomb photoreactor and the slurry photoreactor configuration with the same amount of 1wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst. Clearly, in all cases the photocatalytic performance of the honeycomb photoreactor is much better than that of the conventional slurry reactor configuration (ca. 4–5-fold increase). Taking into account that in both cases the light source was exactly the same (optical fibers), either inside the monolith channels (catalytic wall photoreactor) or without them (slurry reactor), the better photocatalytic performance of the optical fiber honeycomb photoreactor is ascribed to a better photon delivery. Both the immobilization of the photocatalyst onto the honeycomb structure and the insertion of optical fibers inside the channels likely result in enhanced photon delivery to the photocatalyst, which yields a higher H2 photoproduction rate with respect to that obtained in the slurry photoreactor configuration, where photon delivery is less controlled. Assuming optimal light absorption, operation in a non-diffusion-limited regime, and that two photons are required for liberation of one hydrogen molecule, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for hydrogen photogeneration was calculated from the ratio of the double amount of H2 ( r H 2 ) and the overall amount of photons irradiated by the optical fibers (N λ , 2.4μmolphotonsmin−1) using the equation AQE = ( 2 r H 2 / N λ ) × 100 [20,21]. The AQE values corresponding to the optical fiber honeycomb and the slurry photoreactors are included in Fig. 5. Light irradiation was measured directly on the optical fibers before and after each photocatalytic test and was maintained constant within 3% error. All the hydrogen photogeneration rates were normalized to the initial value N λ . However, a progressive decrease of the overall amount of photons irradiated by the optical fibers was observed over all the different experiments (decrease of ca. 60%). Fig. 6 shows SEM images of a fresh optical fiber and an optical fiber at the end of the experiments. It is evident that the roughness of the optical fiber increased markedly at the end of the experiments (Fig. 6b), which explains the decrease of photons irradiated. The deterioration of the optical PMMA fibers was mostly due to the adverse effect of aldehydes, as tested in a separate experiment. Therefore, chemical-resistant optical fibers (i.e. quartz) would be more adequate for longer durability in the photoproduction of hydrogen from water-alcohol/bio-alcohol mixtures."
8,Conclusions,"Au/TiO2 photocatalyst (1wt.% Au, 93% anatase, 7% rutile) prepared from pre-formed Au nanoparticles was tested for the photoproduction of hydrogen from various alcohols and bio-alcohols. The photocatalyst was used in powdered form in a slurry reactor, or was deposited onto catalytic walls (cordierite honeycomb) in an optical fiber photoreactor. The hydrogen photoproduction rate was higher when pure methanol, ethanol and glycerol were used, followed by that of bio-ethanol and bio-glycerol, thus suggesting that impurities that commonly accompany bio-alcohols are adsorbed onto the photocatalyst surface and compete with alcohol hole scavenging capacity. Alcohol–water mixtures were also tested and the hydrogen photoproduction rate progressively decreased with water content. Aqueous bio-alcohol showed a stronger decline of hydrogen photoproduction at increasing water content. The optical fiber honeycomb photoreactor showed better performance (4–5-fold enhancement of hydrogen photoproduction rates) than the conventional slurry reactor under the same operational conditions, allowing a higher degree of process intensification."
