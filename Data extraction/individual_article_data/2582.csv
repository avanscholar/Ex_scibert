0,Introduction,"Anthropogenic climate changes and the decreasing availability of fossil fuels have led scientists all over the world to look for alternative sources of energy [1]. One alternative to fossil fuels that is drawing international attention is the employment of biological processes to produce biofuels, such as hydrogen and ethanol. Ethanol and hydrogen can be produced simultaneously and in significant amounts [2], which makes them promising alternative energy sources [3]. Hydrogen has the highest energy content per unit weight of all known fuels (142kJg−1 or 61,000Btulb−1) and can be easily transported for domestic and industrial use. Today, it is regarded as an environmentally safe and renewable source of energy, i.e., one that does not contribute to the greenhouse effect [4]. A promising area of technological development is the production of hydrogen and ethanol by microorganisms from a wide variety of renewable sources, such as beet sugar plant residues, potato and wheat starches, and cellulose, e.g., Miscanthus [2]. The main species identified as responsible for the biological production of hydrogen during acidogenesis of carbohydrates are Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium [5] as well as Clostridium for the simultaneous production of H2 and ethanol [2]. According to Ren et al. [6], three types of fermentation may occur: (1) butyric acid-type fermentation, (2) ethanol-type fermentation, and (3) propionic acid-type fermentation. Butyric acid-type fermentation occurs when most of the products generated by acidogenic fermentation consist of acetic and butyric acid. This type of fermentation is suitable for hydrogen production because four moles of hydrogen are produced when generating one mole of acetic acid from glucose fermentation, and two moles of hydrogen are produced in the generation of one mole of butyric acid. In ethanol-type fermentation, the liquid products are derived mainly from ethanol and acetic acid. Lastly, in propionic acid-type fermentation, the propionic acid is converted to methane and accumulates in the reactor during fermentation. Among the high-rate anaerobic reactors used for biological production of hydrogen is the anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR). In AFBRs, the microbial film is retained by natural adherence of microorganisms to particles of a solid support medium, which is its most influential variable [7]. It is therefore important to use support materials that are simultaneously lightweight, inexpensive, easy to purchase and that can also contribute to solving the serious environmental problems caused by today's generation and inappropriate disposal of solid wastes. Polymeric support materials, such as polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and grounded tire, are lightweight, easy to purchase, and reusable, and their use as support medium may reduce the amount of waste in landfills and minimize the energy required for fluidization in AFBRs. Some studies have shown that the products of fermentation depend on the type of substrate used and the operating conditions of the reactor, e.g., the hydraulic retention time (HRT), temperature, and pH. In particular, pH has the greatest influence on the composition of the acidogenic reactor effluent [8]. According to Wang and Wan [9], it influences hydrogen production because it can affect the hydrogenase activity as well as the metabolic pathway. As indicated by van Ginkel et al. [10], Fang and Liu [11], Li et al. [12], and Aceves-Lara et al. [13], the optimum pH value for hydrogen production is between 5.5 and 6.0. A pH between 6.0 and 6.5 can produce an excessive amount of propionic acid. However, pH values lower than 4.5 are conducive to the production of H2, CO2, acetic acid, butyric acid, and ethanol [8]. The literature presents contradictory results in regard to the optimum pH value for hydrogen production. Possible reasons for this lack of consensus are the type of inoculum and substrate used in these studies as well as the pH range under investigation [9]. Another important aspect of AFBRs is whether the pH should be controlled because the use of alkalis to achieve this control increases the cost of the process. Contradictory results have been described in the literature. For example, Barros et al. [14] achieved a high hydrogen yield (HY) (1.90 and 2.59molH2 mol−1 glucose, respectively) and a low ethanol concentration (1.96 and 4.35mM, respectively) with glucose as the carbon source, polystyrene and expanded clay as the support materials, and alkalis for pH control. Amorim et al. [15] and Shida et al. [16] also achieved a high HY (2.49 and 2.29molH2 mol−1 glucose, respectively) and a low ethanol concentration (1.86 and 1.18mM, respectively) with glucose as the carbon source and expanded clay as the support material, but without using alkalis. Abreu et al. [17] reported a low HY (0.8molH2 mol−1 arabinose) and a high ethanol concentration (197.43mM) with arabinose as the carbon source and a batch reactor and the use of an alkalizing agent for pH control. However, Wu et al. [3] achieved a high HY (1.04molH2 mol−1 hexose) and ethanol concentration (20.43mM) with polyethylene-octane elastomer as the support medium, pH control, and glucose as the carbon source, despite the fact that the production pathways of these biofuels compete with one another. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the simultaneous biological production of hydrogen and ethanol in an AFBR with synthetic wastewater used as the substrate (4000mgL−1 of glucose as the carbon source), an HRT reduction from 8 to 1h at a temperature between 20°C and 25°C, different support materials (polystyrene, grounded tire, and PET) and an effluent pH around 3.5, without the addition of alkalis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Anaerobic fluidized bed reactors,"2.1 Anaerobic fluidized bed reactors Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the three identical jacketed reactors used for H2 production in this study. The reactors were constructed of transparent acrylic with the following dimensions: a height of 190cm, an internal diameter of 5.3cm, and a total volume of 4192cm3. The temperature in the AFBRs was maintained at 23±2°C."
3,Synthetic wastewater and support materials,"2.2 Synthetic wastewater and support materials The synthetic wastewater contained glucose as the main carbon source (4000mgL−1) and was supplemented with nutrients as described by LEITE et al. [18]. Particles of polystyrene (R1), grounded tire (R2) and PET (R3) were used in the AFBRs as support materials for biomass immobilization. The support materials were submitted to prior chemical treatment to increase their surface roughness [19]. The basic characteristics of the support materials are shown in Table 1 ."
4,Heat treatment of inoculum and AFBRs start-up,"2.3 Heat treatment of inoculum and AFBRs start-up The inoculum used in this study was obtained from the anaerobic sludge of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating effluent from swine wastewaters. The H2 productivity of the sludge was enhanced by heat treatment according to the methodology of Kim et al. [20]. This treatment consisted of preheating the sludge for 10min at 90°C to inhibit the methanogenic activity. The three AFBRs were fed with a medium containing glucose (4000mgL−1) and heat-treated sludge (10%, v/v). Reactor R1 was filled with 930g of polystyrene, reactor R2 was packed with 621g of grounded tire, and reactor R3 was filled with 1375g of PET, thus creating an initial fixed bed of 73cm, 50cm and 80cm in depth for the reactors, respectively. Due to use of different particle sizes and densities, we made the experimental determination of the minimum fluidization velocitiy for each particle, in order that the reactors reach similar heights when they were fluidized. The total liquid flow (Q) was adjusted at 76, 122 and 139Lh−1, for the reactors R1 (polystyrene), R2 (grounded tire) and R3 (PET), respectively. These flow rates produced a superficial velocity 1.30 times greater than the minimum fluidization velocity for each particle. After fluidization, the reactors R1, R2 and R3 reached an average initial height of 106cm, 92cm and 96cm. Nitrogen gas was used to sparge the fermentation medium to create an anaerobic environment. The bioreactors were initially operated on batch mode for 48h to activate the H2-producing sludge. Afterward, they were switched to a continuous mode at a designated hydraulic retention time (HRT=8h). When a steady state condition was reached (based on a constant H2 production rate with a variation of within 5–10% for 5–10 days), the HRT was decreased progressively from 8h to 1h. The three reactors were operated for 175 days in five experimental phases. A gas–liquid separator was used at the effluent outlet to collect gaseous and soluble products separately. A gas meter (TG1; Ritter Inc., Germany) was used to quantify the amount of hydrogen generated."
5,Chemical and biomass analyses,"2.4 Chemical and biomass analyses The pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and solids (total solids, TS; volatile suspended solids, VSS; and total volatile solids, TVS) were measured in accordance with Standard Methods [21]. The glucose concentration was measured with an enzymatic GOD-PAP [18]. Biomass adhesion to the polystyrene, grounded tire and PET particles was determined according to the methods of Chen and Chen [22]. The biogas hydrogen content was determined by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with argon as the carrier gas and a column packed with Supelco Carboxen 1010 Plot (30m×0.53mm i.d.) [23]. Concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols were also measured by gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) using a device equipped with FID (flame ionization detector) and COMBI-PAL headspace injection (AOC 5000 model) as well as a HP-INNOWAX column (30m×0.25mm i.d.×0.25-μm film thickness) [23]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Glucose conversion and hydrogen production,"3.1 Glucose conversion and hydrogen production The pH remained stable throughout the system operation within the operating range of acidogenic anaerobic systems, i.e., between 3.40 and 3.99 in R1 (polystyrene), 3.43 and 3.98 in R2 (grounded tire), and 3.41 and 4.01 in R3 (PET). The influent pH remained between 4.86 and 5.53. Fig. 2 shows the behavior of glucose conversion as a function of the applied HRT. The average influent glucose used was approximately 3500mgL−1. In R1, the glucose conversion decreased from 91% to 60% when the HRT was reduced from 8h to 1h. The glucose conversion in R2 at an HRT of 8h and 6h should have been about 80%, whereas it actually dropped at an HRT of 4h. It rose to approximately 75% at an HRT of 2h and dropped again at 1h. In R3, the glucose conversion increased from 74% to 82% as the HRT was reduced from 8h to 6h. With the HRT reduction to 1h, the glucose conversion decreased to 61%. In the same way, Koskinen et al. [24] observed a decrease in glucose conversion by decreasing the HRT, and Chang and Lin [25] obtained similar results using sucrose as the carbon source. In reactor R1, the H2 content increased from 33% to 51% as the HRT was reduced from 8h to 1h; in reactor R2, it increased from 46% to 60% as the HRT was reduced from 8h to 2h; and in reactor R3, it increased from 38% to 51% as the HRT was reduced from 8h to 2h (Fig. 2). R2 achieved the highest hydrogen content, reaching a maximum value of 60%. No methane was detected during the operation of the reactors. This trend of increasing hydrogen content with decreasing HRT has also been reported in the literature on AFBRs [15,26,27]. Fig. 3a and b presents the variation in HY and hydrogen production rate (HPR), respectively, as a function of the HRT in the three reactors. The reactor that displayed the highest HY was filled with grounded tire (R2) at an HRT of 2h (2.11molH2 mol−1 glucose) (Fig. 3a). In R1 (polystyrene) and R2 (grounded tire), the highest HY was achieved at an HRT of 2h and, in R3 (PET), at an HRT 4h. These phenomena indicate that metabolic changes may have occurred when the HRT was reduced from 2h to 1h and that more substrate was diverted to biomass growth and maintenance than to the generation of end products [28]. In R1 and R3, the HPR increased with HRT reduction from 8h to 1h; in R2, the HPR increased with HRT reduction from 8h to 2h (Fig. 3b). The maximum HPR for the reactors containing polystyrene, grounded tire and PET was 0.52, 0.36, and 0.30Lh−1 L−1, at HRTs of 4h, 2h, and 1h, respectively (Fig. 3b). Likewise, the HPR values increased with HRT reduction in the studies of Lin et al. [27], Zhang et al. [28], and Shida et al. [16]. According to Wang and Wan [9], the pH is a factor that influences hydrogen production because it can affect hydrogenase activity as well as the metabolism of metabolic pathways. Barros et al. [14] obtained hydrogen yields similar to those in our study using a pH around 5.5 with the addition of alkalis. On the other hand, Zhang et al. [28], Shida et al. [16], and Amorim et al. [15] also achieved HY values similar to those in our study at pH values below 4.0 without the addition of alkalis."
8,Soluble microbial products,"3.2 Soluble microbial products Fig. 4 a–c shows the amount of soluble microbial products (SMP), i.e., butyric acid (HBu), acetic acid (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), ethanol (EtOH) and methanol (MetOH) produced in R1 (polystyrene), R2 (grounded tire), and R3 (PET), respectively. The highest HAc concentrations were 208.79, 434.74, and 291.62mgL−1; while the highest HBu concentrations were 625.09, 1013.61, and 660.44mgL−1 for the reactors R1, R2, and R3, respectively. The HPr concentrations ranged between 0 and 44.01mgL−1 in R2 and R3; there was no production of this acid in R1. The highest EtOH concentrations were 1288.36, 1107.36, and 1359.24mgL−1; while the highest MetOH concentrations were 159.88, 147.21, and 155.29mgL−1 for the reactors R1, R2, and R3, respectively. There was a predominance of HBu over HAc at all stages in the three reactors. In reactors R1 and R3, the production of acetic acid was almost constant at all HRTs. However, at an HRT of 1h, the HAc concentration increased whereas the HY in R2 decreased. According to Antonopoulos et al. [29], this may be attributed to the fact that a considerable amount of the hydrogen produced is probably consumed by hydrogen-consuming microorganisms, such as homoacetogenic bacteria growing in the reactor, producing HAc (Eq. (1)). (1) 4H2 +2CO2 →CH3COOH+2H2O HPr was present in the system in small concentrations in all reactors (0–44.01mgL−1). This finding may promote an increased HY because, when the HPr production pathway is favored, it results in the consumption of two moles of H2 for every two moles of HPr produced (Eq. (2)). Additionally, it may be related to inhibition caused by low pH and sensitivity to short HRTs, which has been reported by other researchers [28]. (2) C6H12O6 +2H2 →2CH3CH2COOH+2H2O According to Koskinen et al. [2], hydrogen production from carbohydrates takes place when HAc or HBu is produced while EtOH production results in no H2 production. This observation implies that when H2 production is optimized (HAc production), EtOH production diminishes and vice versa. Depending on the microorganisms present, EtOH and H2 yields vary considerably: from traces to small amounts. These authors also obtained EtOH as the main soluble metabolite. On the other hand, Wu et al. [30] reported an increased production of HAc and a decreased production of EtOH upon HRT reduction due to limited alcohol production because it is an unfavorable pathway to H2 production (Eq. (3)). Abreu et al. [17] observed that the presence of a large amount of EtOH and a small amount of HAc, in addition to the butyrate/ethanol-type fermentation pathway, may account for the low HY obtained in their study. The presence of EtOH is particularly undesirable because it has a toxic effect on hydrogen-producing bacteria [31]. (3) C6H12O6 →CH3CH2OH+2CO2 Cheong and Hansen [32] and Antonopoulos et al. [29] stated that selecting the proper pH value is crucial for hydrogen production, due to the effect of pH on hydrogenase activity and metabolic pathways. According to these authors, when EtOH production increases rapidly, hydrogen production ceases. Moreover, when these authors tested different pH values (4.6, 5.7, and 6.8), they found a higher production of EtOH and a lower production of HAc at pH 4.6. At pH 6.8, there was an increased production of HAc and a reduction of EtOH, which, according to the authors, may be used to produce HAc. Ren et al. [8], Hwang et al. [33], Wang et al. [34], Ren et al. [6], Guo et al. [35], and Antonopoulos et al. [29] had higher EtOH production at pH values below 4.5, which may also explain the high concentrations of EtOH found in our study, in which the effluent pH was around 3.5. The complex distribution of VFA may be caused by different microbial community structures and different types of fermentation occurring in the reactor [24]. According to Ren et al. [8], the ethanol-type fermentation produces EtOH and HAc and can preserve the balance between NADH and NAD+. EtOH is the main product of this type of fermentation and is neutral at a pH around 4.5. Thus, it will diminish the production of acid and will perform acid fermentation smoothly and swiftly. Therefore, it minimizes propionic acid production, which improves the overall stability of the anaerobic treatment operation. In NADH regeneration, the reaction is also directed to convert pyruvate to lactic acid and HPr or to convert acetyl-CoA to EtOH and HBu. As indicated by Wu et al. [3], Clostridia species (C. acetobutylicum) can produce hydrogen and ethanol/organic acids (acetate); however, when more EtOH and less acetate are produced, the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio decreases, leading to low H2 production yields. As also indicated by the authors, the bacterial community structure of the mixed culture producing H2 and EtOH at an equally important amount could be markedly different from the culture producing mainly H2 because H2 and EtOH production seem to be competitive events from the perspective of metabolic electron transfer and energy generation. Ethanol-type fermentation is an excellent choice for maximum HPr in continuous mode hydrogen-producing systems with mixed cultures [35]. A decreased pH gives origin to a phase of solvent production, such as EtOH, toward the end of the anaerobic fermentation. Gottschalk [36] reported that volatile fatty acids are no longer produced toward the middle of the batch growth of C. acetobutyricum and that n-butanol, acetone, and EtOH appear as new products toward fermentation. According to Ren et al. [6], most of the ethanol-type fermentation includes Bacteroides sp., Zymomonas sp., and Fusobacerium sp. with potential redox strictly for anaerobic bacteria that survive at pH values between 3.0 and 9.0. Fusobacerium sp. can survive under different conditions and produce a high content of EtOH and HBu at pH 4.0. Each type of fermentation was verified for different microbial populations, and each population reached its peak at different stages and fermentation types. Fig. 5 shows the ethanol yield (EtOHY) as a function of HRT in the three reactors. According to the studies conducted by Wu et al. [3], Koskinen et al. [2], and Wang et al. [37], HY decreases with increasing EtOHY. In general, HY and EtOHY are inversely correlated irrespective of the type of sugar substrate or bioreactor used [3]. In our study, however, HY increased with an increase in EtOHY (Figs. 2 and 5). In Figs. 2 and 5, the EtOHY in R1 (polystyrene) at an HRT of 2h increases by 2.12 times while the HY increases by 1.02 times. In R2 (grounded tire) at the same HRT, the EtOHY increases by 2.69 times while the HY increases by 1.13 times. However, in R3 (PET), at an HRT of 2h, the EtOHY increases by 2.04 times whereas the HY decreases by 0.86. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between the HY and the EtOHY (HY/EtOHY – selectivity) in all three reactors at varying HRTs. Fig. 6 shows that, in reactor R1, an HRT of 6h and 4h favors the HY over the EtOHY, whereas at an HRT of 8h, 2h, and 1h, the EtOHY values were approximately equal to HY values. In reactor R2, an HTR above 2h promoted HY values over that of EtOHY, while at HRTs of 2h and 1h, EtOHY were approximately equal to HY. On the other hand, in reactor R3, an HRT above 6h favored HY over EtOHY, and at HRTs of 4h, 2h and, 1h, EtOHY values prevailed over that of HY. As stated by Hwang et al. [33] and Zhu et al. [38], there are several pathways for the production of organic acids, EtOH and hydrogen (Eqs. (4)–(6)). In addition to the production of EtOH by means of Eq. (3), EtOH can also be obtained by another pathway (Eq. (4)) [39]: (4) C6H12O6 +H2O→C2H5OH+CH3COOH+2H2 +2CO2 (5) C6H12O6 →2H2 +2CO2 +(1/2)CH3COOH+(3/4)CH3(CH2)2COOH (6) C6H12O6 →(4/3)CH3CH2COOH+(2/3)CH3COOH+(2/3)CO2 +(2/3)H2O From Eq. (4), it is possible to verify that hydrogen and EtOH can be produced because this pathway presents no competition between these two biofuels; they are produced concomitantly. Additionally, HAc and HBu may be produced via other metabolic pathways, as indicated in Eqs. (5) and (6). Along these lines, Wu et al. [3] investigated the feasibility of producing these two biofuels simultaneously by employing sucrose, glucose, and fructose as carbon sources. Using an AFBR, polyethylene-octane elastomer as a support material, seed sludge as inoculum and treatment with acid, a 35°C temperature, a pH between 5.8 and 6.8, and sucrose, fructose, and glucose as carbon sources at a concentration of 20gCODL−1, these authors concluded that glucose was more appropriate for hydrogen production (1.04molH2 mol−1 hexose), whereas fructose was better for EtOH production (0.65molEtOHmol−1 hexose). Notwithstanding, both carbon sources were adequate for simultaneous production of hydrogen and EtOH. Our study presented a higher production of hydrogen and EtOH for the three reactors when compared to the study by Wu et al. [3]. In addition, Buitrón and Carvajal [40] claimed that there is more EtOH production at 25°C than at approximately 35°C, which may explain the high EtOH production in our study, which was conducted at room temperature (23°C). Another important aspect analyzed was the HAc/HBu ratio, which is frequently used as an indicator of hydrogen production [41]. This ratio is shown in Fig. 7 for all three reactors at varying HRTs. In mesophilic processes using microbial communities, optimum performance in hydrogen production by fermentation (Eqs. (7) and (8)) is often achieved with a high HAc/HBu ratio [24]. (7) C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 (8) C6H12O6 →CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 In our study, the HAc/HBu ratio in reactor R1 increased from 0.61 to 0.84 when the HRT was reduced from 8h to 2h. Upon reduction of the HRT to 1h, this ratio decreased to 0.40. In reactor R2, this ratio increased from 0.56 to 0.95 when the HRT was reduced from 8h to 2h and decreased to 0.63 when the HRT decreased to 1h. Reactor R3 performed in a similar way; this ratio increased from 0.55 to 0.80 with the reduction of the HRT from 8h to 2h and decreased to 0.66 with the reduction of the HRT to 1h (Fig. 7). An increase in the HAc/HBu ratio with a reduced HRT has also been reported by other researchers [15,27,42]. On the other hand, while Skonieczny and Yargeau [31] found no such correlation between HAc and HBu, their study still indicated the production of hydrogen and EtOH. Hence, it may be claimed that, despite its importance to hydrogen production [41], the HAc/HBu ratio cannot be analyzed as the only factor in the production of this gas, but as part of a set of operational conditions, e.g., pH, temperature, and inoculum treatment/concentration [4,9]. Thus, it is possible to state that reactor R2 (grounded tire) was the most appropriate in terms of hydrogen production, whereas reactor R3 (PET) performed better in EtOH production. This phenomenon may have occurred due to changes in metabolic pathways promoted by these two support materials or even due to the selection of different types of microorganisms favoring the production of either hydrogen or EtOH. Fig. 8 shows the biomass adhered as a function of the mass support of material in reactors R1, R2 and R3. Fig. 8 shows that when the HRT was decreased from 8h to 1h, the biomass concentration in TVS adhered to the support medium increased from 0.4 to 1.7mgTVSg−1 particle, from 0.7 to 2.1mgTVSg−1 particle, and from 0.2 to 1.5mgTVSg−1 particle in reactors R1, R2 and R3, respectively. The reactor containing grounded tire (R2) displayed the greatest amount of adhered biomass per unit support medium mass, which may be explained by its porosity (18.0%) being higher than that of polystyrene (14.6%) and PET (10.2%). This increased amount of biomass adhered to grounded tire particles may also account for R2 performing better in hydrogen production because there may be a greater quantity of hydrogen-producing acidogenic bacteria adhered to this support medium. Therefore, it is possible to claim that, in addition to using inexpensive materials as support medium, i.e., polystyrene, grounded tire, and PET, our study reduced operation costs by not employing alkalis to control pH while achieving satisfactory results in the production of hydrogen and ethanol as biofuels."
9,Conclusion,"The AFBR containing grounded tire as the support material (R2) was found to be the most appropriate for the biological production of hydrogen because, in addition to presenting the highest HY (2.11molH2 mol−1 glucose), it also presented the highest H2 content in biogas (60%) and the highest HAc and HBu production (434.74 and 1013.61mgL−1, respectively). The outstanding performance of this reactor may be attributed to the porosity of grounded tire, which is higher than that of the other materials (PET and polystyrene); thus, it accumulates a greater amount of biomass attached and results in a greater quantity of hydrogen-producing acidogenic bacteria. Nevertheless, the reactor containing PET particles (R3) as the support material performed better in regard to ethanol concentration (1359.24mgL−1). However, in spite of reactor R2 being more suitable for hydrogen production and reactor R3 performing better in ethanol production, it was possible to produce both of these biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, simultaneously in all three reactors under investigation."
