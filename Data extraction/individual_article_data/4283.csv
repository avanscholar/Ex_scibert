0,Introduction,"Nowadays, energy demands remain increasingly urgent, owing to fast population growth and industrial development. It has been estimated that global energy consumption will grow by nearly 50%, and CO2 emissions increase by 19.2% from 2018 to 2050 [1]. The overuse of fossil energy will result in the rise of sea level and the deterioration of the ecosystem owing to the generation of massive greenhouse gases, which further threat to the health of human beings [2]. Therefore, the development of novel energy sources and the effective treatment of hazardous gases are significant challenges that must be tackled in this century [3,4]. As is known, solar energy is inexhaustible and environmentally friendly. Therefore, it is a promising scheme to solve issues of the depletion of fossil energy and the accumulation of greenhouse gases by utilizing solar energy. In a pioneering work in 1972, an intriguing phenomenon that water successfully decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen on the surface of titania anode under light irradiation was observed by Fujishima and Honda, which revealed the feasible conversion of solar energy to hydrogen [5]. In 1978, Halmann et al. achieved the generation of formic acid, formaldehyde, and methanol by direct CO2 reduction over p-type gallium phosphide photocathode under ultraviolet light, which was conceived as an ideal solution for CO2 emissions and energy depletion [6]. Since then, numerous semiconductor photocatalysts such as CdS [7,8], ZnS [9,10], TiO2 [11–14], ZnO [15], g-C3N4 [16], BiVO4 [17,18], Bi2WO6 [19], metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [20,21], covalent organic frameworks (COFs) [22–25] were exploited for the further advance of photocatalytic efficiency. However, both photocatalytic water splitting and photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the uphill reactions, which is restricted by the kinetic and thermodynamic barrier, thus leading to a low quantum efficiency [26–30]. In addition, the shortage of active sites and severe recombination of photoexcited charge carriers further deteriorate the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts [31–33]. Therefore, various cocatalysts were loaded on the surface of photocatalysts for improved charge separation and increased active sites in the photocatalytic process [34,35]. Some noble metal or metal oxides such as Pt [36], Pd [37,38], Au [39,40], Ag [15], RuOx [41], and IrOx [31], as cocatalysts exhibited outstanding catalytic performance in the photocatalytic overall water splitting, H2 production, and CO2 reduction reaction. Nevertheless, the scarcity and expensive costs are insurmountable obstacles for the large-scale application of noble metal cocatalysts. Hence, massive noble metal-free cocatalysts such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) [42], transition metal complexes [43], Mxene [44], graphene [45] and graphdiyne [46,47] were widely investigated in the arena of photocatalysis [48]. Among them, nickel-based cocatalysts presented a promising blueprint in photocatalysis owing to low costs, facile and flexible synthesis methods, abundant varieties, and excellent catalytic performance [49,50]. Back in 1980, Domen et al. [51] achieved photocatalytic decomposition of water to hydrogen and oxygen by anchoring NiO cocatalysts on SrTiO3. Years later, Beley et al. [52] demonstrated that the extraordinary selectivity of nickel(II)-cyclam in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO in aqueous solution. These two pioneering works verified the accessibility of nickel-based cocatalysts in the solar-to-fuels conversion. Especially, great progresses have been achieved on the development, design, characterization, catalytic mechanism of nickel-based cocatalysts in the last decade. The number of publications on nickel-based cocatalysts for photocatalysis has an apparent increase from 2013 and reaches 105 in 2019, indicating the significance of nickel-based cocatalysts in the field of photocatalysis (Fig. 1 ). In 2010, Hu et al. [53] loaded 3 wt% p-type NiO as cocatalysts on n-type NaTaO3, which realized overall photocatalytic water splitting under UV light with a high H2 production rate of 9000 μmol g−1 h−1. In the next year, Husin et al. [54] compared Ni, NiO, and Ni/NiO dual core-shell structure as cocatalysts for enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production performance of LaxNa1-xTaO3, respectively. The results demonstrated the promotion effect of these cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production was Ni/NiO > NiO > Ni in aqueous solution, while it was Ni > Ni/NiO > NiO in aqueous methanol. The metallic nickel served as active sites and captured the photoexcited electrons from LaxNa1-xTaO3, thus boosting photocatalytic H2 production in the sacrificial reagent of methanol. However, the metal nickel failed to utilize photoexcited holes in aqueous solution, which caused a low photocatalytic H2 evolution rate. Instead, dual Ni/NiO core-shell cocatalysts can capture the photoexcited electrons and holes to simultaneously enhance the oxidative and reductive reaction, thus leading to high photocatalytic H2 production activity in pure water. The work revealed the advantages of nickel-based dual cocatalysts in the overall improvements of photocatalytic redox reactions. Yu's team [55] achieved photocatalytic H2 production under visible light by Ni(OH)2 decorating CdS nanorods. The H2 evolution rate for the optimal CdS/Ni(OH)2 can reach 5085 μmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 28% at 420 nm, which even exceeded CdS loaded with noble metal Pt. Subsequently, in 2012, Mohamed et al. [56] discovered that when metallic nickel anchored on TiO2–SiO2, the composite exhibited ≥ 99% photocatalytic selectivity for H2 production over CO evolution. The work provided a novel insight on metal nickel for the selectivity of the photocatalytic H2 production. Since then, the research on nickel-based cocatalysts for photocatalysis was growingly developed by various modification strategies. With the development of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the photocatalytic mechanism can be discussed in depth at the atomic and even electronic level, which has greatly promoted the theoretical progress of nickel-based cocatalysts [20,57–61]. The charge transfer between the photocatalysts and cocatalysts is vital for revealing the type of junction and the redox capability of a composite. Li et al. [35] found the work function of NiCo2S4 (311) surface is 5.33 eV larger than CdS (100) surface of 5.24 eV by work function calculation. In this way, when the NiCo2S4 grew on the CdS, the electrons of CdS will transfer to the NiCo2S4. Therefore, the energy band of CdS will bend upward owing to the loss of electrons and a typical Schottky junction between CdS and NiCo2S4 will form. The Schottky junction has a rectifying effect so that the electrons transferred from the CdS to the NiCo2S4 will not be transferred back, thus promoting the separation of charge carriers. The work manifests that work function can serve as a significant cause for the transfer of interfacial electrons. In the surface catalytic process, the adsorption free energy was reckoned as crucial evidence to unveil the process or energy barrier of catalytic reactions. Zhu et al. [62] discovered that the hydrogen adsorption free energy of Ni2P, FeP and FeNiP was −0.29, −0.72 and −0.23 eV, respectively. The results illustrated that the adsorption of hydrogen on the Ni2P, FeP and FeNiP was a spontaneous process. Meanwhile, the absorbed hydrogen more easily desorbed from the surface of FeNiP in contrast with Ni2P and FeP. When these cocatalysts were loaded on g-C3N4, the FeNiP/g-C3N4 exhibited higher photocatalytic hydrogen production activity than FeP/g-C3N4 and Ni2P/g-C3N4. The work verifies that the adsorption free energy can be employed as a significant indicator to predict the catalytic activity of cocatalysts. Similarly, Tan et al. [63] employed ruthenium complex and a monolayer nickel-alumina layered double hydroxide (NiAl-LDH) as photosensitizer and catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. By tuning the surface defect and the wavelength of incident light, the NiAl-LDH can lower the driving force of photogenerated electrons to 0.313 eV. While the Gibbs free energy calculation uncovered that the energy barrier for CO2 reduction and hydrogen production is 0.127 and 0.425 eV, respectively. Therefore, the NiAl-LDH with defect state achieved 70.3% selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 with fully restraint of photocatalytic hydrogen production under light wavelength larger than 600 nm. The work elucidates the significance of DFT calculation for revealing the photocatalytic mechanism. Based on this, some timely review on nickel-based cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production has been reported [49,50]. Nevertheless, there is still a shortage of reviews on nickel-based cocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, which is the competition reaction for photocatalytic H2 production. Therefore, it is imperative to give a more comprehensive review on nickel-based cocatalysts for elucidating the photocatalytic mechanism, and vital roles of nickel-based cocatalysts in photocatalysis. Meanwhile, with the devotion of many efforts and the increase of advanced characterization means, numerous state-of-the-art nickel-based cocatalysts are constantly emerging. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the latest progress of nickel-based cocatalysts for photocatalysis was summarized. In this review, the promotion mechanism of nickel-based cocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production, overall water splitting and CO2 reduction are elaborately discussed. Meanwhile, the design strategy for nickel-based cocatalysts on morphology, interface, the development of novel nickel-based cocatalysts and the synergy effect of dual cocatalysts are systematically investigated (Fig. 2 ). Finally, the challenges and perspectives on nickel-based cocatalysts for photocatalysis are also presented."
1,Fundamentals of cocatalysts,
2,Basic principles of photocatalysis,"2.1 Basic principles of photocatalysis The photocatalytic efficiency is affected by the following three factors: light absorption, the separation and migration of photoexcited charge carriers, and the redox reactions on the surface of the photocatalyst. Schematic illustration of the photocatalytic mechanism for semiconductor photocatalysts anchored with oxidative and reductive cocatalysts under light irradiation was displayed in Fig. 3 . The electrons will jump from the valance band to the conduction band when the semiconductor photocatalysts are exposed under light irradiation. The photoexcited electrons will migrate to reductive cocatalysts to participate in photocatalytic H2 production or photocatalytic CO2 reduction. While the photoexcited holes will transfer to oxidative cocatalysts to involve in the oxidation of water. During these processes, the interfacial electric field (IEF) at the junctions between photocatalysts and cocatalysts will provide the driving force for the transfer of photoexcited charge carriers [64,65]. Photocatalytic H2 production and photocatalytic CO2 reduction require that the potential of the conduction band of the semiconductor is more negative than 0 V E(H+/H2)/0 V) and 0.169 V (E(CO2/CH4)/0.169 V), respectively. Meanwhile, photocatalytic CO2 reduction requires the involvement of protons which originate from the oxidation of water (E(H2O/O2)/1.23 V) [66,67]. Therefore, the potential of the valence band of semiconductors requires more positive than 1.23 V for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In this way, it is imperative to endow the photocatalysts with a wide enough bandgap for generating photoexcited charge carriers with strong redox capability. Paradoxically, photocatalysts with wide bandgap are unfavorable for the light adsorption. Moreover, the photoexcited charge is more inclined to recombination in the inner of photocatalysts due to thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, which will cause a low photocatalytic efficiency for a single photocatalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to load cocatalysts on the photocatalysts to ameliorate the photocatalytic performance [68]."
3,The roles of nickel-based cocatalysts,"2.2 The roles of nickel-based cocatalysts Earth-abundant nickel-based cocatalysts are promising candidates in the photocatalysis due to their outstanding catalytic performance and low costs [49,50,69–74]. First, nickel-based cocatalysts can promote photocatalytic activity through the following five aspects. (i) Improving light absorption: Metal nickel [75,76] and some nickel-based cocatalysts with narrow bandgap such as nickel sulfide [77,78], nickel phosphide [79–82], nickel carbide [83,84] and nickel nitride [85,86] can improve light absorption ability of photocatalysts by stimulating the absorption for light with wide wavelength. In comparison, the nickel hydroxide and nickel oxide with wide bandgap can improve light absorption by multiple scattering of light based on a hierarchical nanostructure [87,88]. (ii) Boosting charge separation: the promoting effect of nickel-based cocatalysts on charge separation is based on the junction principle [89]. When the cocatalysts anchored on photocatalysts, various junctions such as Schottky junction, ohmic contact, p-n junction will form owing to the difference of work function [44,90–92]. These junctions can effectively transfer the photoexcited charge from the photocatalysts to cocatalysts, which achieves charge separation [93]. (iii) Increasing active sites: nickel-based cocatalysts possesses abundant active sites, which have been verified by some in-situ characterization technologies such as operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra [61,94–96], in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test [97,98], Operando Raman spectra [99,100] and DFT calculations. For the design of nickel-based cocatalysts, it is a common method to increase active sites for nickel-based cocatalysts by augmenting the specific surface area and surface engineering [50,88]. The active site is where the catalytic reaction proceeds [96]. Compared with other positions on the catalyst, these positions generally have a lower overpotential and catalytic reaction energy barrier, so they are more conducive to the occurrence of the catalytic reaction [60,61]. First, the specific surface area of the catalyst can be increased through surface design [87,88]. With the same surface conditions, the larger the specific surface area, the more active sites. Secondly, the surface design can expose different crystal planes, and the coordination numbers of nickel atoms on various crystal planes are distinct, so they exhibit different adsorption free energy. Exposing more surfaces with low adsorption free energy will increase the number of active sites. In addition, surface designs can produce certain surface defects. These surface defect states can also reduce the adsorption free energy and overpotential and provide more active sites for catalytic reactions [101,102]. (iv) Lowering overpotential: in general, an excellent electrocatalyst as a cocatalyst can also perform well in photocatalysis [11]. Because when the photogenerated charge of the photocatalyst transferred to the cocatalyst, the cocatalyst will finish catalytic processes that are similar to electrocatalysis [103]. Many nickel-based cocatalysts exhibit low overpotentials in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or CO2 reduction reaction (CRR), indicating excellent electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, when these electrocatalysts as cocatalysts loaded on photocatalysts, the composite can also exhibit outstanding photocatalytic performance [37,60,104–106]. (v) Decreasing adsorption free energy: The process of surface catalysis on the cocatalysts can be divided into three steps [107]. (1) Reactants are adsorbed on the surface of the cocatalysts, which is related to the surface structure and inherent attributes of the cocatalysts [108]. (2) The cocatalysts capture photoexcited charge carriers to reduce, or oxide reactant adsorbed on its surface. (3) The resultant products are desorbed from the surface of the cocatalysts to generate free product molecules. Therefore, in the early stage of catalytic reactions, it is expected that reactants can easily be absorbed on the surface of cocatalysts. While in the latter stage of catalytic reaction, it is expected that the adsorption capability of cocatalysts for resultant products is relatively small so that the resultant products can be quickly desorbed for the formation of the next resultant molecules. Meanwhile, the adsorption sites of reactants are related to the location of the active sites in theory [20,57,109,110]. Therefore, the adsorption free energy (ΔGH∗) are commonly employed as evaluation criteria for the difficulty of the catalytic reaction [111–115]. For the multi-step CO2 reduction process, the adsorption free energy can reveal the determining step (the highest energy barrier) of the catalytic reaction [20]. Some nickel-based cocatalysts exhibit a low hydrogen adsorption free energy, which indicates that these nickel-based cocatalysts are appropriate for photocatalytic H2 production [116,117]. While some nickel-based cocatalysts present a small potential energy barrier in the multi-step CO2 reduction processes, which illustrates that these nickel-based cocatalysts can perform well in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction [113]. Second, nickel-based cocatalysts can improve photocatalytic selectivity in the multi-product photocatalytic CO2 reduction process [20,23,61,73]. First, the driving force of photogenerated electrons is different for various nickel-based cocatalysts [63]. Therefore, when the driving force of photogenerated electrons provided by a nickel-based cocatalyst is lower than the energy barrier of H2 production but higher than CO2 reduction, the H2 production will be suppressed by kinetics, which boosts selective CO2 reduction. Second, experiments and DFT calculations unveil that the adsorption of CO2 plays a significant role in the rate-determining step (RDS) of selective CO2 reduction [23,118,119]. As is known, photocatalytic H2 production is a competitive reaction of photocatalytic CO2 reduction (both require the participation of photogenerated electrons) [66,120]. Thereby, the adsorption preference for H2O or CO2 affects the selective reduction process of photocatalysis [109]. The adsorption capability for various nickel-based cocatalysts has significant differences [121]. Third, the inherent attribute and coordination environment of element nickel also determines the selectivity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over competitive H2 production [122]. Consequently, some nickel-based cocatalysts showed high photocatalytic H2 production efficiency [43,123–125]. In contrast, some nickel-based cocatalysts exhibited excellent selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with a CO/H2 ratio of more than 99% [118,122]. Third, nickel-based cocatalysts can enhance the durability of photocatalysts by promoting charge separation [126,127]. The surface structure of a single photocatalyst is susceptible to photocorrosion in the photocatalytic redox process, which affects the long-term stability of the photocatalysts [79]. When the nickel-based cocatalysts loaded on photocatalysts, the photocatalytic redox reactions will transfer to the surface of nickel-based cocatalysts, thus avoiding the photocorrosion of photocatalysts [117,128–131]."
4,Design,
5,Morphology engineering,"3.1 Morphology engineering Morphology engineering, as a general modification method of nanomaterials, has also found many applications in nickel-based cocatalysts [87,88]. A cocatalyst with the desired morphology can drastically improve catalytic performance by promoting light absorption, charge separation, increasing specific surface area, enhancing adsorption ability, and increasing active sites of the photocatalytic system (Fig. 4 ) [132,133]. 3.1.1 Morphology design of photocatalyst For example, Meng et al. [88] prepared hierarchical TiO2/Ni(OH)2 (TN) composite fibers by electrospinning and oil bath methods (Fig. 5 A). The hierarchical Ni(OH)2 (N) nanosheets entirely enclosed the TiO2 (T) fibers (Fig. 5B). The TN showed enhanced absorption for visible light owing to the hierarchical structure of N (Fig. 5C). The hierarchical nanostructure not only improved light absorption by light scattering effect but enhanced the specific surface area and adsorption capability of photocatalysts. The CO2 adsorption activity for hierarchical N reached 1.92 mmol g−1 (Fig. 5D). When N enclosed around the T, the TN showed an improved CO2 adsorption ability than T. As a result, compared to pristine T, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of TN composite fibers showed remarkable improvements for the yield of CH4, CH3OH, C2H5OH and CO (Fig. 5E). Therefore, anchoring a cocatalyst on a hierarchical nanostructure is a practical approach to improve the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts. 3.1.2 Spatial separation of cocatalysts The photocatalysts with a regulated morphology not only facilitate the contact of cocatalysts but make it more feasible to load on specific desired spatial sites of photocatalysts, which benefit for the separation of photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions. Wu et al. [134] anchored Ni2P nanoparticles (NPs) on the outer surface of hollow CdS@TiO2 microspheres by a calcined process in Ar flow (Fig. 6 A). According to the photocatalytic mechanism (Fig. 6B), the photoexcited holes transferred from the TiO2 VB to CdS VB while the photoexcited electrons moved from the CdS CB to TiO2 CB and eventually to Ni2P. In this way, the oxidative reaction occurred on the inner surface while the reductive reaction (photocatalytic hydrogen evolution) conducted on the outer surface of hollow CdS@TiO2 microspheres, which realized the spatial separation of the photocatalytic redox reactions. With the load of Ni2P, the CdS@TiO2/Ni2P ternary composite exhibited enhanced visible light harvesting and high photocurrent density. As expected, the H2 evolution rate of CdS@TiO2/Ni2P ternary composite reached 7.42 mmol g−1 h−1 under Xe lamp with AM1.5G filter, which was higher than that of CdS@TiO2 (4.65 mmol g−1 h−1) and CdS/Ni2P (5.33 mmol g−1 h−1). 3.1.3 Minimizing the size of cocatalyst When the shape or the surface of the photocatalyst is not well regulated, minimizing the size of cocatalysts is an essential strategy for intimate contact with photocatalysts for enhancing charge separation. Zeng et al. [135] loaded Ni2P NPs evenly on porous g-C3N4 nanosheets, which realized the hydrogen evolution rate of 474.7 μmol g−1 h−1 with an AQY of 3.2% at 435 nm. Notably, the nearly monodispersed Ni2P NPs effectively contacted with porous g-C3N4, which was a significant factor for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. Therefore, for photocatalysts with irregulated surface or structure, loading small cocatalysts as colloidal NPs or quantum dots is an effective method (Fig. 7 ). The small cocatalysts can be embedded in small pores or grooves of the photocatalyst, thus ensuring intimate contact between the cocatalysts and photocatalysts. 3.1.4 Morphology design of cocatalyst An alternative approach is loading photocatalysts onto cocatalysts with desired morphologies. For instance, Xu et al. [124] first assembled g-C3N4 on the outer surface of Ni-MOF hollow spheres. Then, the Ni-MOF/g-C3N4 transformed into Ni2P/Ni@C/g-C3N4 composites by the calcining and phosphorization processes (Fig. 8 ). The Ni-MOF sustained the spherical structure of g-C3N4 and more importantly formed Ni2P/Ni@C ternary cocatalysts inside the composite hollow sphere. Benefiting from the delicate fabrics, the hydrogen production rate for Ni2P/Ni@C/g–C3N4–550 achieved 18.04 mmol g−1 h−1 using Eosin Y (EY)-sensitization, which was 14 folds higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (1.33 mmol g−1 h−1). Besides, the AQE of Ni2P/Ni@C/g-C3N4 reached 58.1% under 420 nm light irradiation."
6,Interface engineering,"3.2 Interface engineering The effect of cocatalysts on the photocatalytic process is significantly influenced by the interface between cocatalysts and photocatalysts (Fig. 9 ) [66,136,137]. As is known, the cocatalysts can boost charge separation by capturing the photoexcited charge from photocatalysts. The migration efficiency of charge carriers at the interface is affected by the following factors but not limited to: the junction area, the interfacial interaction force, and lattice matching degree [138,139]. The design of the junction area has been discussed in Section 3.1 of morphology engineering. The interface design is a vital strategy to tune the IEF of heterojunction, which affects the kinetics of charge migration and determines the direction of charge transfer [140]. The IEF at the interface can be calculated using the work function difference between photocatalysts and cocatalysts. 3.2.1 Schottky junction Besides, most of the cocatalysts are metal or metal-like semiconductors. Since the work function of the metal is usually larger than that of n-type semiconductor [50], therefore, when the metal cocatalyst loads on n-type semiconductor photocatalyst, a typical Schottky junction will form [7]. Jiang et al. [141] discovered that the work function of g-C3N4 (Φ = 4.76 eV) was smaller than that of CoNiSx (Φ = 4.84 eV) by DFT calculation (Fig. 10 A). When CoNiSx contacted with g-C3N4, the electrons thermodynamically transferred from g-C3N4 to CoNiSx until the Fermi level of g-C3N4 was equal to that of CoNiSx. The energy band of g-C3N4 bent upward due to the loss of electrons. A Schottky heterojunction between CoNiSx and g-C3N4 formed (Fig. 10B). Due to the rectifying effect of the Schottky junction, the transfer of photoexcited electrons from g-C3N4 to CoNiSx was favourably promoted, and the transfer of photoexcited electrons from CoNiSx to g-C3N4 was inhibited, which effectively boosted the charge separation and simultaneously increased the utilization rate of photoexcited charge carriers (Fig. 10C). The g-C3N4/CoNiSx exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with a hydrogen production rate of 2366 μmol g−1 h−1, which was about 77 times that of pristine g-C3N4. The promotion effect of CoNiSx on photocatalytic H2 production was even close to that of the conventional noble metal Pt. Therefore, it is a feasible method to select an appropriate cocatalyst to construct a composite by comparing the work function difference between photocatalysts and cocatalysts. 3.2.2 Ohmic contact An ohmic contact is another contact type between metal and semiconductor, which possesses smaller resistance in the interface [142]. Wang et al. [143] found that the work function of Au (5.27 eV) was smaller than the work function of TiO2 (5.55 eV) by the first principle calculation (Fig. 11 A and B). The band alignment is exhibited in Fig. 11C. When Au was loaded on TiO2, the electrons transferred from Au to TiO2 until the Fermi level of TiO2 was equal to that of Au. The energy band of TiO2 bent down owing to the accumulation of electrons. Meanwhile, an IEF directed from Au to TiO2 formed, which facilitated the photoexcited electrons transferred from the TiO2 to Au under light irradiation. Benefited from the ohmic contact between Au and TiO2, the CH4 and CO yield rates for 0D/2D Au/TiO2 reached 70.34 and 19.75 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, with nearly 80% selectivity for CH4. 3.2.3 Composite with a wide-bandgap cocatalyst Some Ni-based wide-bandgap semiconductors, such as NiO (3.4 eV [144]), can also serve as cocatalysts to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. Liu et al. [145] loaded amorphous NiO cocatalyst on the surface of g-C3N4 by a calcining method. A C–O–Ni bond formed at the interface between g-C3N4 and NiO. Although NiO cannot be excited by visible light, the IEF in the heterojunction of g-C3N4/NiO drove the photogenerated electrons from the g-C3N4 to NiO by the C–O–Ni bond, which facilitated charge separation (Fig. 12 ). The NiO exhibited excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, which indicated that the surface of NiO was abundant in active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction. As expected, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of g-C3N4/NiO composite (68.8 μmol h−1 g−1) drastically enhanced compared with that of pristine g-C3N4 (0.16 μmol h−1 g−1). Notably, the g-C3N4/NiO synthesized by the calcining method was more durable in the photocatalytic H2 production process. The stability tests showed that negligible activity loss was observed even after the Ni/g–C3N4–300 was used in the photocatalytic H2 production for 30 h. 3.2.4 2D/2D van der Waals heterojunction Although it is a normal method to prepare composite by oven heating, some nanomaterials such as low-dimensional transition metal sulfide, MOFs, metal complexes cannot be subjected to high temperatures. Therefore, more wild synthetic methods have to be employed to construct composite with substances that are not heat-resistant. Hu et al. [82] first synthesized SnNb2O6/CdS-diethylenetriamine(DETA) composite by in-situ growing 2D CdS-DETA (Fig. 13 A and B) on the 2D SnNb2O6 nanosheets (Fig. 13C and D) in a microwave reaction process. Then, the 2D Ni2P was loaded on the 2D/2D SnNb2O6/CdS-DETA composite by a mechanical grinding method (Fig. 13E and F). The 2D/2D interface endowed the ternary 2D heterojunction with a large junction area and effective charge transfer. The charge transfer in the SnNb2O6/CdS-DETA composite was demonstrated to comply with the step-scheme mechanism by a work function calculation (Fig. 13G). In this way, the photoexcited electrons will transfer from the SnNb2O6 to Ni2P to participate in photocatalytic H2 production. The hydrogen evolution rate for SnNb2O6/CdS-DETA/Ni2P composite achieved 11,992 μmol g−1 h−1, which was nearly 200 and 3.6 times that of pure SnNb2O6 and CdS-DETA, respectively. This work provides an efficient design strategy to load cocatalysts with a facile, morphology-protected route for the construction of 2D/2D van der Waals heterojunction. 3.2.5 Intimate interface by in situ growth In situ growth is a vital synthesis approach toward an intimate interface between materials, which benefits for charge transfer and keeps the stability of junction. Deng et al. [146] utilized C/ZnO nanofibers (Fig. 14 A) as substrates to in situ grow the Ni–NiS cocatalysts by an in situ photochemical deposition procedure. First, the photogenerated electrons accumulated on the surface of C/ZnO nanofibers under light illumination. Then, the Ni2+ cations were attracted and deposited on the C/ZnO. Subsequently, the hierarchical NiS nanosheets in-situ grew around C/ZnO nanofibers owing to the decomposition of thiourea, realizing intimate and firm junction. Meanwhile, the metallic Ni also generated by the reduction of excessive photoexcited electrons, which is favorable for light harvesting. The resulted C/ZnO/Ni–NiS (Fig. 14B–E) exhibited improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, of which the CO and CH4 evolution rates increased to 11 and 16 times that of pure C/ZnO under visible light. Meanwhile, no noticeable activity loss was observed for C/ZnO/Ni–NiS for continuous 9 h runs, which indicates the C/ZnO/Ni–NiS junction by in situ growth was durable enough."
7,Nickel single atoms,"3.3 Nickel single atoms Recently, single-atom catalysts spark tremendous interest in photocatalysis [147–149], electrocatalysis [150], organic synthesis [151], hydrogenation [152], hydrogenolysis [153], in the light of the high activity, selectivity, stability and inexpensive costs (Fig. 15 ). Considering that the catalytic reaction occurs on the surface of catalysts, the atom utilization efficiency of single-atom catalysts can nearly achieve 100%, thus leading to extremely high catalytic efficiency. The single metal atom can tightly bond with N, O, C, or other metal atoms of the substrate, which maintains the long-term durability of single atom catalysts [107]. The various coordination environment endows single atom catalysts with unique electric structure and adsorption capability, thus leading to high activity and selectivity [154,155]. Particularly, single metal atom catalysts provide convenience and possibility for the thorough insight of photocatalytic mechanism by DFT calculations owing to limited atoms and specific coordinated sites [57,156]. Compared to single noble metal atoms, single nickel atoms catalyst exhibits more appealing in the catalytic reaction due to a high earth abundance. Back in the 1980s, Tung et al. [157] first introduced the conception of single atom nickel and systematically investigated the single nickel atoms self-diffusion on five different crystal planes of metal nickel by field ion microscope [158]. In 2015, Qiu et al. [159] obtained nickel single atoms on graphene with empty C–Ni hybrid orbitals for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Afterwards, a series of nickel single-atom catalysts were developed by bottom-up (pyrolysis, acid etching) and top-down (thermal reduction, coordination confinement) channels [20,58,61,95,109,113–115,160–166]. 3.3.1 Coordinated with MOFs In 2017, An et al. [167]. Achieved photocatalytic overall water splitting by Al-2-Aminoterephthalate (Al-ATA) MOFs coordinated with nickel single atoms. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) revealed that nickel atoms were coordinated with oxygen and aluminum atoms (Fig. 16 A and B). No Ni–Ni bond in Al-ATA-Ni MOF can be observed, indicating the inexistence of bulk nickel. Meanwhile, the Ni–N bond of Al-ATA-Ni MOF can be observed in the FTIR spectra (Fig. 16C). These results illustrated that single nickel atoms existed in the pores of Al-ATA and simultaneously coordinated with the N atoms of 2-Aminoterephthalate, the Al atoms of AlO4OH)2 octahedra. Unexpectedly, the Al-ATA-Ni MOF achieved photocatalytic overall water splitting in pure water with H2 and O2 evolution rate ratio of near 2:1. The Al-ATA MOF was an oxidation-type photocatalyst, which failed to achieve photocatalytic H2 production by itself. When the Ni coordinated with Al-ATA MOF, the photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution for Al-ATA-Ni MOF remarkably elevated. The results showed that the nickel single atoms not only served as active sites for hydrogen evolution but considerably improved the oxygen evolution ability of Al-ATA MOF. 3.3.2 Anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) In another work, Zhao et al. [168] successfully anchored nickel single atoms on the vacancy of nitrogen-doped graphene by an NH3 thermal reduction route (Fig. 17 A–D). Graphene loaded with nickel single atoms as a cocatalyst significantly improved the photocatalytic activity of CdS. When only 0.0013 wt% of nickel single atoms were loaded, the H2 evolution rate of Ni-NG/CdS composite was 3.4 times higher than that of NG/CdS without a load of nickel single atoms. Meanwhile, the AQE of Ni-NG/CdS composite reached 48.2% at 420 nm. DFT calculations revealed that nickel single atoms anchored on the vacancies of nitrogen-doped graphene, which effectively reduces the hydrogen adsorption free energy, thus lowering energy barrier for photocatalytic H2 production. 3.3.3 Steering of the d band electrons The d band electrons of nickel exert a significant effect on photocatalytic redox reaction. Jin et al. [156] prepared CN-0.2Ni–HO with partial oxidated nickel single atoms by thermal treatment of carbon nitride incorporated with an atomic percentage of 0.2 at% nickel single atoms in H2 then O2 gas flow, respectively. The Ni K-edge XANES profiles showed that the X-ray absorption intensity of Ni2+ for CN-0.2Ni–HO was lower than that for pure Ni foil and higher than that for NiO, indicating a partial oxidation state (Fig. 18 A). Meanwhile, no X-ray absorption peak for NiO can be observed, which demonstrated that the oxidation process just altered the coordination of nickel single atoms rather than formed the NiO NPs. The Ni 2p XPS spectra showed two distinct signals of Ni0 and Ni2+ for CN-0.2Ni–HO (Fig. 18B). Further, the CN-0.2Ni–HO showed enhanced EPR signals at the g value of 2.1, which also signified a partial oxidation state of nickel single atoms (Fig. 18C). The partial oxidative CN-0.2Ni–HO possessed different electron configurations from CN-0.2Ni, which exhibited a small work function (Fig. 18D), indicating that the electrons of CN-0.2Ni–HO were more likely to be excited by photons. As expected, the photocatalytic H2 production performance of CN-0.2Ni–HO was better than CN–Ni, CN-0.2Ni–H (just thermal treatment of CN–Ni in H2 gas flow) and CN-0.2Ni–O (just thermal treatment of CN–Ni in O2 gas flow). In addition, the photocatalytic H2 production performance of partial oxidated nickel single atoms of CN-0.2Ni–HO was more distinguished than Fe, Co, and Cu counterparts (Fig. 18E). 3.3.4 Anchored on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) The catalytic CO2 reduction performance for nickel single atoms have been verified from the electrocatalytic tests and DFT calculation, which indicated that nickel single atoms could serve as cocatalysts in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction [20,57,61,113,162,164–166]. Zhong et al. [23] employed covalent organic frameworks of TpBpy as a substrate to anchor nickel single atoms for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (Fig. 19 ). The Ni-TpBpy showed improved CO2 adsorption ability despite decreased specific surface area than TpBpy, indicating the nickel single atoms can facilitate the adsorption of CO2. The CO and H2 evolution rates for Ni-TpBpy were 811 and 34 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which achieved 96% selectivity with an AQE of 0.3 at 420 nm in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO over completing H2. The control experiments revealed that the nickel single atoms played an indispensable role in improved activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Meanwhile, a slight loss in photocatalytic activity can be observed after the Ni-TpBpy was used for 6 h under visible light, indicating satisfying durability. DFT calculations revealed that the adsorption of CO2 is the key factor, which determined the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. The Ni-TpBpy showed preferable adsorption for CO2 over H+, which is a dominant factor for highly selective CO2 reduction. In addition, the nickel single atoms anchored in the COFs of TpBpy served as active sites of CO2 reduction by effectively lowering the potential barrier of Ni–COOH to Ni–CO, thus boosting the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. This work demonstrated the immense potential of COFs for the design and synthesis of nickel single atoms."
8,Nickel alloys,"3.4 Nickel alloys In Section 2.2, the significance of adsorption free energy was discussed. For photocatalytic H2 production, the hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH∗) exerts a tremendous effect on the catalytic performance. The ΔGH∗ value is different for various catalysts due to the intrinsic attribute of metals (Fig. 20 A). The noble metals such as Au, Pt, Pd, showed a lower ΔGH∗ value, indicating a high efficiency in photocatalytic H2 production. However, the limited earth abundance restrained large-scale applications [169]. Developments of alloys are a feasible way of improving ΔGH∗ value (Fig. 20B). Meanwhile, the alloys exhibited tunable work function, overpotential, and low costs compared with a single metal cocatalyst (Fig. 21 ) [125,170–174]. 3.4.1 Noble metal-nickel alloys In this context, some noble metal-nickel alloys were developed, such as AuNi [176], PtNi [177], PdNi [178], which has proven to be useful for adjusting the overpotential and lowering the costs. Jia et al. [179] synthesized CdS nanorods anchored with PtNixCoy alloy nanocubes by an electrostatic self-assembly process. The merit of this method was that the morphology of both photocatalyst and cocatalyst could remain intact. As shown in Fig. 22 A–C, the CdS/PtNixCoy junction exhibited enough stability after the photocatalytic reaction. Compared to pure CdS, the photocurrent density increased when the cocatalyst, such as Pt, PtNi, PtNiCo, is attached (Fig. 22D), indicating effective charge separation. Among them, the PtNiCo attached material showed the highest photoresponse, implying PtNiCo can better promote charge separation. In Fig. 22E, the PtNiCo/CdS showed the smallest overpotential for photocatalytic H2 production. As a result, the PtNiCo/CdS showed the optimum photocatalytic performance with a hydrogen evolution rate of 50.6 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 1.3 times than that of Pt/CdS (Fig. 22F). 3.4.2 Non-noble metal-nickel alloys Many non-noble metal-Ni alloys such as CdNi [180], CuNi [181], CoNi [173], and MoNi [170] have been developed. By rationally designing the atom ratio, interface, and morphology, the photocatalytic performance of non-noble metal-Ni alloys even outweighed the noble metal cocatalysts, presenting intriguing photocatalytic prospects. Li et al. [130]. Reported ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) hierarchical microspheres anchored with CoNi bimetal cocatalysts by ion reduction method for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light. The fluorescence intensity of ZIS was significantly reduced by anchoring the CoNi alloys, which illustrated that photogenerated charge carriers were effectively separated. As a cocatalyst, CoNi alloys showed better promotion for photocatalytic H2 production than pure metals of Co or Ni. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of CoNi-ZIS photocatalyst reached 100 μmol h−1 under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The work function of metallic Co and Ni were respectively 5.0 and 5.15 eV, which was higher than the work function of ZIS (4.56 eV). Therefore, when ZIS contacted with metallic nickel or cobalt, a Schottky barrier formed. Because the work function of the alloys was between the metals nickel and cobalt, the Schottky barrier can be effectively adjusted within a specific range by controlling the proportions of the two metals, which influenced photocatalytic H2 production performance (Fig. 23 A). Meanwhile, the Schottky barrier can prevent photogenerated carriers from flowing from the metal to the photocatalyst, thus improving charge separation and enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency (Fig. 23B). The ΔGH∗ value of metal Ni is negative, which means that the adsorption of hydrogen atoms or protons on metal Ni is a spontaneous process [175]. While the ΔGH∗ value of metal Cu is positive, illustrating that metal Cu facilitates the desorption of resultant hydrogen molecules from its surface [121]. The absolute value of ΔGH∗ for CuNi alloys is smaller than the pure metal Ni or Cu, indicating a favorable potential as cocatalysts in the photocatalytic H2 production [175]. Lin et al. [182] prepared CuNi alloys by liquid laser ablation. By controlling the two metal ratios, the photocatalytic H2 production activity and durability were reasonably optimized. As shown in Fig. 24 A, when the Cu, Ni, and CuNi alloys loaded on TiO2, respectively, CuNi alloys exhibited more excellent photocatalytic performance than pure metal Cu and Ni. When the atomic ratio of copper to nickel was 63:37, the CuNi alloys exhibited the optimal photocatalytic performance. Interestingly, the hydrogen production performance over Cu63Ni37 alloy even exceeded noble metal Pt (Fig. 24B and C). In addition, the Cu63Ni37 alloy also exhibited strong durability to resist oxidation under the recycling runs for a total of 24 h, showing seductive practical application potential (Fig. 24C and D). 3.4.3 Insight of active sites It is of considerable significance to in-situ monitor the photocatalytic reaction process for profoundly understanding the photocatalytic mechanism [183]. Muñoz-Batista et al. [96] used operando micro-XANES and micro-EXAFS to in-situ monitor the gas-phase photocatalytic H2 production process of TiO2 loaded with a CuNi alloy. It was found that metal Cu and CuNi alloy were in a sufficiently reduced state at a saturation time in a reducing alcohol solution before light irradiation. Then, both the metal Cu and the CuNi alloy suffered from an oxidation process from the sufficiently reduced state under light irradiation. Since copper was in the wholly reduced state before light irradiation, the oxide process on the surface of copper under light irradiation generated a Cu@CuO core-shell structure. The metal copper facilitated the charge transfer, while copper oxide served as active sites for the surface redox process. Contrary to the case of copper, XANES proved that nickel always maintained the oxidation state of Ni2+ on the surface and inner of CuNi alloys and the change in the dark or light irradiation is negligible, indicating nickel plays a secondary role in the process of photocatalytic H2 production."
9,Nickel solid solutions,"3.5 Nickel solid solutions The design of nickel-based solid solutions is an essential modification approach for nickel-based cocatalysts (Fig. 25 ) [184–186]. These nickel-based solid solutions exhibited a different electron structure compared with nickel-based cocatalysts owing to distinct elemental ingredients [187]. By adjusting the variety and ratios of the incorporated elements, the adsorption capability, work function, overpotential can be altered in the desired manner [60]. Peculiarly, an IEF easily formed in the inner of solid solutions due to the difference of charge density for various elements, which is favorable for charge separation [188]. Based on this, some nickel-based solid solutions have been developed, such as NiCo2S4 [189–191], Ni–Mo–S [192], Zn–Ni–P [34], NiCoP [129,184,187,188], NiFeP [62], FeCoPOx [193], for improved catalytic efficiency. Li et al. reported Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods loaded with NixCo1-xP for improved photocatalytic H2 evolution [194]. First, the NiCo-LDH and Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods were mixed by a mechanical approach, and then NixCo1-xP in situ grew on Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods by the high-temperature phosphating of NaH2PO2 in a tube furnace. DFT calculation exhibited the ΔGH∗ values for Ni2P, CoP, Ni0.1Co0.9P–Ni and Ni0.1Co0.9P–Co varied (Fig. 26 A). The ΔGH∗ value of Ni0.1Co0.9P–Ni and Ni0.1Co0.9P–Co both were smaller than Ni2P and CoP, illustrating a synergistic effect between metallic Co and Ni. The absolute ΔGH∗ value for Ni0.1Co0.9P–Co is smaller than Ni0.1Co0.9P–Ni, illustrating that Co sites may be the active sites in Ni0.1Co0.9P. The H2 evolution rate of 4 mol% Ni0.1Co0.9P reached above 450 μmol h−1 with AQE of 19.7% at 420 nm (Fig. 26B). The work function of Ni0.1Co0.9P (4.75 eV) smaller than Zn0.5Cd0.5S (6.7 eV) (Fig. 26C). Therefore, a typical ohmic contact between Ni0.1Co0.9P and Zn0.5Cd0.5S formed, which facilitated the separation of charge carriers and the enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency. Li et al. [35]. Decorated the NiCo2S4 NPs on one-dimensional CdS nanowires (NW) via a hydrothermal approach. In Fig. 27 A, pristine CdS showed low photocatalytic H2 evolution activity owing to the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and the shortage of active sites. The load of NiCo2S4 significantly increased the H2 evolution rate of CdS NW. When the molar ratio of NiCo2S4 to CdS was 10%, the photocatalytic H2 production rate reached 20 mmol h−1 g−1. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic H2 production activity of the 10% NiCo2S4/CdS composite hardly decreased with five times runs for a total of 15 h, revealing that the 10% NiCo2S4/CdS composite possessed satisfied stability in the photocatalytic process (Fig. 27B). The LSV (linear sweep voltammetry) polarization curves for various photocatalysts were displayed in Fig. 27C. The 10% NiCo2S4/CdS exhibited the lowest overpotential among all photocatalysts, which was a vital factor for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production performance. The lifetime of charge carriers for 10% NiCo2S4/CdS was investigated by transient adsorption decay curves (Fig. 27D). The average lifetime of pure CdS NW was about 904 ps. With the load of 10% NiCo2S4, the average lifetime of 10% NiCo2S4/CdS significantly reduced to 30 ps. Considering that the transient adsorption signal only originated from the absorption of CdS NWs, the electron transfer from CdS to NiCo2S4 resulted in a shortened lifetime. The effective electron transfer from CdS to NiCo2S4 was also a significant cause of improved photocatalytic performance."
10,Nickel complexes,"3.6 Nickel complexes Ni(II) complexes as cocatalysts are extensively investigated in photocatalytic H2 production and photocatalytic CO2 reduction by virtue of the merits of facile synthesis, abundant varieties, high activity, selectivity, stability, and atom utilization (Fig. 28 ) [195–199]. Zhao et al. [200] ingeniously discovered the Ni(II) coordinated with ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) could serve as a high efficient cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production. In their experiments, Ni(II)-EDTA (NiE) complexes first were absorbed on the surface of CdS in methanol solution. After the ethanol evaporated, the left powder was calcined at various temperatures under argon for 1 h to enhance the interaction between the CdS and Ni(II)-EDTA complexes. The photocatalytic H2 production tests demonstrated that CdS and Ni(II)-EDTA complexes exhibited a high activity of 4.3 mmol h−1 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 864 h−1 with AQE of 67.5% at 420 nm (Fig. 29 A). The extraordinary photocatalytic performance of Ni(II)-EDTA complexes were even superior to that of conventional noble metal platinum. The calculated hydrogen adsorption free energy revealed that the coordination of EDTA molecules drastically decreased the free energy of metallic nickel (Fig. 29B). The free energy of Ni(II)-EDTA complexes was even smaller than that of popular MoS2, an excellent cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production. Although the hydrogen adsorption free energy of Ni(II)-EDTA complexes were a little larger than that of platinum, Ni(II)-EDTA complexes possessed better photocatalytic H2 production performance. The DFT calculations further unveiled that the carboxylic acid-Ni-H intermediate with a binding energy of 0.065 eV boosted charge transfer by a beneficial thermodynamic and kinetic process, thus leading to high photocatalytic H2 production. Besides, nickel complexes as cocatalyst have exhibited high CO2 reduction activity. Shirley et al. [73] investigated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of various Ni bipyridyl-NHC complexes under simulated sunlight. Macrocyclic 2-Ni (two nickel bipyridyl-NHC macrocyclic complexes) showed high selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 in aqueous solution. In the early stage, CO and H2 gradually accumulated, and then they evolved into CH4. The conversion process was further verified by deuterium and C13 labeling detection, respectively. With the presence of 1:1 CO/H2 gas mixture and aqueous solution, the 2-Ni-based complexes achieved 570,000 turnovers for CH4 yields. The excellent selectivity of nickel complexes in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction has been demonstrated. Kuehnel et al. [201] designed a nickel terpyridine complexes cocatalyst by facilely mixing the Ni(BF4)2·6H2O and terpyX (X = C(CO2H), P(PO3H2) and S(SH)) in an acetonitrile solution with sonication. The nickel terpyridine complexes showed excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and stability in aqueous solution. When the nickel terpyridine complexes anchored on the CdS dots, the composite showed excellent photocatalytic CO2 activity with more than 90% selectivity CO2 reduction to CO under visible light. Further investigation found that the content of water played an indispensable factor in the enhanced selectivity of photoconversion CO2 to CO. Moreover, the immobilized interface of the sensitizer and the nickel terpyridine also exerted a significant effect on selective CO2 reduction in water. By rational design, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity of nickel complexes even approached 100%, which presented tantalizing prospects in practical application. Similarly, Hong et al. [118] designed a novel photocatalytic system, in which Ni(II) S2N2-type tetradentate complex, [Rubpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1Hbenzo[d]imidazole (BIH) respectively served as cocatalyst, photosensitizer and an electron donor. Surprisingly, the photocatalytic system showed a high turnover number of 713 and CO selectivity of >99% with an AQE of 1.42%. The electrochemical and kinetic results indicated that the rate-determining step (RDS) of the CO formation is determined by coordination equilibrium between CO2 and the [Ni0L]0. When the CO2 molecules are reduced to CO, the [Ni0L]0 will change to [NiIIL]2+, which will again be reduced to [Ni0L]0 by accepting the photoexcited electrons from [Ru(bpy)2bpy•−)]+. The cyclical change endowed Ni(II) S2N2-type tetradentate complex with durable stability. In addition, the Ni0 atom played a significant role in CO2 adsorption and activation, revealing that the metal Ni atoms was the active sites of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Regretfully, it is still relatively rare for the investigations of the contribution of organic ligands to the catalytic activity, selectivity and stability of nickel complexes. Therefore, it is expected that there will be more in-situ characterization methods and theoretical calculations in the future to reveal the significant effects of organic ligands on the photocatalytic behavior of metal nickel atoms [202–204]."
11,Nickel MOFs,"3.7 Nickel MOFs MOFs as cocatalysts sparked intense interests in the photocatalytic H2 production and photocatalytic CO2 reduction owing to porosity, large specific surface area, high adsorption ability, abundant varieties, controllable morphology, and flexible design ways (Fig. 30 ) [21,205–209]. 3.7.1 Single layer of nickel MOFs Han et al. prepared Ni metal-organic framework monolayers (Ni MOLs) by sonicating the mixture of benzenedicarboxylic acids (BDC), NiCl2·6H2O, triethylamine (TEA) triethylamine (TEA) in the mixed solution of Dimethyl Formamide (DMF), ethanol and deionized water at room temperature [119]. The Ni MOLs showed outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance under visible light. The AQE and CO selectivity was 1.96% and 96.8% in diluted CO2, and 2.2% and 97.8% in the pure CO2 atmosphere, respectively. When Co atoms substituted the Ni atoms, the Co MOLs exhibited a low photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2. The result strongly affirmed the significance of Ni atoms in MOFs for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and simultaneously revealed that Ni atoms served as the active site in the Ni MOLs. The Ni MOLs showed high adsorption capability for CO2 and low adsorption ability for H2O molecules, which was the dominant cause for high selectivity of CO2 reduction to CO. Furthermore, DFT calculation revealed the energy barrier from CO∗ to COOH∗ for Co MOLs was smaller than that for Ni MOLs, which meant Co MOLs was more appropriate for the conversion of CO∗ to COOH∗. The result was loaded against the fact that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of Co MOLs was inferior to that of Ni MOLs, indicating that the adsorption of CO2 molecules was the crucial step of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Ni MOLs showed strong CO2 adsorption affinity due to the short Ni–C bond (1.896 Å) in Ni–CO2, which contributed to the high photocatalytic CO2 activity and selectivity (Fig. 31 ). 3.7.2 The substitution of ligand organic molecules The substitution of ligand organic molecules or metal atoms of MOFs also an essential route for designing highly active MOFs. Niu et al. [122] prepared disordered spongy Ni(TPA/TEG) composite by partially replacing terephthalic acid (TPA) in the frameworks of Ni(TPA) MOFs with triethylene glycol (TEG) by laser treatment. The CO yield rate of Ni(TPA/TEG) was higher than that of Ni(TPA), which indicated that the positive effect of TEG molecules in the framework of Ni(TPA) MOFs. Moreover, various M(TPA/TEG) MOFs (M = Ni, NiCo, Co, NiCoCu, and Cu) was investigated to determine the role of metal atoms of MOFs in the photocatalytic process. The CO yield rate presented an order of Ni > NiCo > Co > NiCoCu > Cu, which verified that metal Ni of MOFs exerted a vital effect on photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The H2 production rate showed an order of Co > NiCoCu > Cu > NiCo > Ni, which illustrated that metallic Ni of MOFs could effectively suppress the formation of byproduct hydrogen. The extraordinary selectivity contributed to nearly 100% photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO over H2 production. The work presented a brand insight into the modification of nickel MOFs for excellent selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction."
12,Dual cocatalysts,"3.8 Dual cocatalysts Although the single cocatalyst can significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts, the limited improvements are still challenging to satisfy the demands of practical applications [183]. Therefore, the design of the dual cocatalysts for photocatalysis remains imperative [210–212]. The common dual cocatalysts include double reductive dual cocatalysts and oxidative and reductive dual cocatalysts. The double reductive dual cocatalysts improve the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction reaction by the synergy effect between the cocatalysts [211]. In comparison, the oxidative and reductive dual cocatalysts can enhance the overall photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalysts by simultaneously facilitating the photocatalytic oxidation reaction and the reduction reaction (Fig. 32 ) [213]. Yu et al. [214] investigated the synergistic effect of Ti(IV) and Ni(II) on CdS for photocatalytic H2 production. Pristine CdS without a load of cocatalysts showed low photocatalytic H2 production activity and poor stability owing to the shortage of active sites and the oxidation of S2− on the surface of CdS, respectively (Fig. 33 A). When the Ti(IV) was used as oxidative cocatalysts and loaded on CdS, the photoexcited holes in CdS will transfer to the Ti(IV) to involve in the oxidation reaction, which effectively avoided the oxidation of S2− (Fig. 33B). Therefore, the stability of CdS was improved. However, the photocatalytic H2 production activity of CdS failed to enhance. Instead, when Ni(II) was served as reductive cocatalyst and loaded on CdS, Ni(II) captured the photoexcited electrons and provided active sites, thus promoting photocatalytic H2 production activity (Fig. 33C). Regrettably, the stability of CdS failed to improve. When the CdS was simultaneously anchored with Ti(IV) and Ni(II), the reduction and oxidation reactions were overall boosted, which endowed CdS with high activity and stability (Fig. 33D). Luna et al. [215] respectively loaded Pd, Ni, Pd–Ni NPs on TiO2 by a photodeposition approach for photocatalytic H2 production. When the metal NPs/TiO2 photocatalytic were exposed on light irradiation, the photoexcited holes transferred to the surface of TiO2 to involve in the photocatalytic oxidation reaction, while the photoexcited electrons migrated to the metallic cocatalyst to achieve hydrogen evolution (Fig. 34 A). No matter how many the molar ratio of Ni to Pd was or whether Ni contacted Pd, the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of TiO2 loaded with Ni–Pd bimetallic was higher than that of TiO2 loaded with single metal Ni or Pd (Fig. 34B and C). The enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity over dual Ni–Pd NPs can be ascribed to the synergy effect between Ni and Pd NPs, indicating the merits of dual reductive cocatalysts. Zhang et al. [216] prepared cubic NaTaO3 loaded with Ni and NiO dual cocatalysts for photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction. Both oxidation and reduction capability of NaTaO3 was more robust than that of NiO (Fig. 35 A). Therefore, when the NiO was anchored on the NaTaO3, the photoexcited holes and electrons of NaTaO3 will transfer to NiO. The photoexcited electrons will reduce the Ni2+ on the surface of NiO to metallic Ni (Fig. 35B). Interestingly, the NiO located at oxidative sites of NaTaO3 just received photoexcited holes and served as oxidative cocatalysts, thus avoiding be reduced. While the NiO centred at reductive locations of NaTaO3 accepted photoexcited electrons and gradually was reduced to metallic Ni (Fig. 35C and D). The metallic Ni can capture the photoexcited electrons and promote charge separation. Meanwhile, the metallic Ni was also an excellent reductive cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 production owing to a low overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction [175]. When the NiO and metallic Ni functioned as the oxidative and reductive cocatalyst, respectively, photocatalytic water splitting efficiency was overall boosted. With the load of 2% NiO on NaTaO3, the photocatalytic H2 and O2 production rates for NaTaO3/NiO composite can respectively reach about 1000 and 500 μmol g−1 h−1."
13,Conclusions and perspectives,"In this review, the various design schemes for nickel-based cocatalysts have been summarized, such as morphology engineering, interface engineering, nickel single atoms, alloys, solid solution, complexes, MOFs and dual cocatalysts, all of which effectively enhanced the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts [61,82,188,217]. The photocatalytic H2 production performance of some nickel alloys and complexes reach and even surpass the conventional noble metal Pt cocatalysts [177,182,200]. Meanwhile, nickel-based cocatalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Notably, some nickel single atoms, complexes, and MOFs exhibited distinguished selectivity of nearly 100% in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO over competitive H2 production [23,118,119,122]. Although nickel-based cocatalysts have made significant progress in the last decade, the research for nickel-based cocatalysts is still in infancy. To further elevate the performance of nickel-based cocatalysts, the following issues need to be given more attention: (i) Morphology engineering is still an essential method for the modification of (co)catalysts. First, the morphology modulating affects the light absorption capacity of the catalysts. Some hierarchical, hollow, core-shell, yolk-shell structures can increase the light absorption capacity of the catalyst by multiple scattering and refraction of the incident light. The fine-tuned morphology will significantly improve the adsorption capacity of the catalyst to the reactants and provide more active sites for the catalytic reaction, which will further enhance the catalytic efficiency. Moreover, morphology control can rationally guide the composite of catalysts. The precise and controllable loading cocatalyst helps to promote the charge separation, and this well-designed structure makes it easier to understand the relationship between structure and activity for further understanding the catalytic mechanism. For example, the oxidative and reductive cocatalysts can be anchored on the inner and outer surfaces of the hollow sphere, respectively. This delegate design can not only promote charge separation but also spatially separate oxidation and reduction reactions. Although some unique morphologies are synthesized, the harsh and complex reaction process makes it challenging to apply on a large scale. Therefore, some simple and general methods of morphology control will be recommended. (ii) Interface engineering is the key to the design of cocatalysts. The interface is the link between the photocatalyst and the cocatalyst, where the charge carriers will pass through. It is imperative to analyze the band structure and work function of the photocatalyst and understand the junction that forms at the interface, which affects the efficiency and direction of charge migration. Meanwhile, the lattice matching in the interface between the photocatalyst and cocatalyst is critical. For a lattice-matched interface, the defects between the interfaces will be significantly reduced, which is more conducive to interface charge transfer. However, this issue has received less attention in previous works of nickel-based cocatalysts. Therefore, in the future preparation of specific composite, it is essential to adjust the crystal plane of the catalyst so that the interface of the heterojunction has a favorable lattice matching degree to promote charge transfer. Besides, the interaction force between the interfaces also affects the charge transfer efficiency and the stability of the heterojunction. For instance, the 2D/2D van der Waals force heterojunction has received much attention. 2D materials can be readily fabricated into nanosheets or monolayers due to the unique layered crystal structure. This kind of sheet structure is more favorable to separate charges and expose more active sites. It is also easy to prepare a heterojunction with a larger contact area to promote the charge transfer at the interface via van der Waals attraction. (iii) The development of novel cocatalysts is the driving force for the development of nickel-based cocatalysts. Some conventional nickel-based materials like metallic nickel, nickel sulfide, nickel hydroxide, nickel oxide, have proved to be active and inexpensive cocatalysts. In recent years, some novel nickel-based cocatalysts such as nickel phosphide, nickel carbide, nickel nitride, nickel-based alloys, solid solutions, complexes, MOFs and nickel single atoms have been developed, which greatly enriched the type of nickel-based cocatalysts and significantly improved the performance of nickel-based co-catalysts. Among them, nickel single atoms, nickel complex, and MOFs are the hotspots of recent research due to their excellent catalytic performance and are worth further systematic exploration. Meanwhile, some novel and advanced nickel-based cocatalysts are also encouraged to be developed and explored. (iv) The active site, reaction pathways, and catalytic mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction need to be further investigated. The mechanism of photocatalysis, including the active site and the reaction pathways, has involved the level of atoms and even electrons, and the existing characterization techniques are still difficult to match. Even some advanced in-situ characterization techniques still need to be combined with subjective semi-empirical speculation to have a relatively complete understanding of the catalytic mechanism. Nevertheless, these advanced in-situ characterization techniques are still currently the most recommended method for identifying active sites (Operando XAS, in situ EPR test, Operando Raman spectra), reaction pathways (In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) [218,219]) and catalytic mechanism. DFT calculation can facilitate the reasonable explanation of the photocatalytic mechanism from the atomic and electronic levels, which can adequately compensate for the shortcomings of existing technical means. Therefore, it is recommended to combine the in situ characterization technique and DFT calculation when explaining the photocatalytic mechanism. Meanwhile, more advanced characterization techniques are also expected. (v) Exploring the overall photocatalytic redox reaction is of great significance for the application of nickel-based cocatalysts. Photogenerated electrons and holes are always generated in pairs, which means that the photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reactions proceed simultaneously. It remains challenging for comprehensive photocatalytic redox reactions in the photocatalytic H2 production and CO2 reduction owing to distressful thermodynamics and kinetics barriers. Consequently, most nickel-based cocatalysts are mainly used as reductive cocatalysts, and sacrificial agents assisted the photocatalytic oxidation reactions. Therefore, it is expected that more nickel-based cocatalysts will be designed for the photocatalytic oxidation process, thereby promoting the photocatalytic overall water decomposition and the complete carbon dioxide reduction process."
