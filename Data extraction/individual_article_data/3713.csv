0,Introduction,"Wastewaters from food industries present generally high organic load and therefore the anaerobic digestion is considered as the best available technology for their treatment (Angenent et al., 2004). Alcohol producing industries affront real problems cause of their high strength stillages. Of special interest for this study are the Tequila’s stillages, given the proximal organic load of 60g/l as chemical oxygen demand due to remaining organic suspended solids and the dissolved organic compounds (Espinoza-Escalante et al., 2006). In Mexico, the Bureau for the Regulation of Tequila, reported a production of 253,000m3 of Tequila during 2006 (http://www.crt.og.mx), and it is known that when producing Tequila, 10l of stillages are produced for each liter of this beverage, and then 2.5 million m3 of Tequila’s stillages were generated for this year. Considering the high organic load of the wastewater and the high volume generated per year, this becomes a real problem of pollution for Mexico. Given the complex composition of Tequila’s stillages, the hydrolysis is the rate limiting step in the anaerobic digestion process. Pretretaments are often required to promote solubilization of organic matter, such as: chemical addition, thermal pretreatment, disintegration or mechanical or ultrasonic oxidation, enzymatic or microbial pretreatment (Carballa et al., 2004; Benabdallah et al., 2007). Thermal hydrolysis is referred as the process where wastes are heated in a range varying from 130 to 180°C during 30 to 60min at the corresponding vapor pressure, however, according to several authors optimal temperature is around 170–200°C (Gosh, 1991; Tanaka et al., 1997). This process yields a partially solubilized waste and biological cells are broken (Bougrier et al., 2004; Carballa et al., 2004). Even when thermal hydrolysis is energetically demanding, electrical needs are actually low. The energy consumed during heating can be optimized in such way that the energetic balance becomes positive compared to the conventional treatment of wastes. In chemical hydrolysis (alcalinization), the waste pH is increased up to 12, and this process may be used to hydrolyze and decompose lipids, hydrocarbons and proteins into smaller soluble substances such as aliphatic acids, polysaccharides and aminoacids (Carballa et al., 2004; Chiu et al., 1997; Luo et al., 2002). In ultrasonic treatment, cavitational collapse produces intense local heating and high pressure on liquid–gas interface, turbulence and high shearing phenomena in the liquid phase, but also formation of OH–, HO2 and H+ (Bougrier et al., 2004). The physical process occurring during cavitation is almost the same as boiling. The major difference between these two processes is how is affected the phase change. In boiling, the vapor pressure of the liquid is increased over the local pressure to cause a change to gas phase, meanwhile cavitation is caused by a local pressure decrement under the vapor pressure of the liquid. This offer the possibility of analyze the effect of pretreatments in solubilizing the complex compounds (mainly polymeric sugars) present in Tequila’s stillages, and also to study their aid in the acidogenic process known already as the first stage of the anaerobic digestion process in which hydrogen is produced. It has been shown by several studies that the response surface methodology (RSM) is a suitable tool to investigate the acidogenic process (Hwang et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005). However, as we have several response variables, besides of use RSM it is necessary to use MRO. Which gives the opportunity of optimize multiple process variables at once and facilitates the process of taking decisions at same time that offers a general view of the anaerobic digestion process of this novel wastewater. The MRO methodology is oriented to the industrial processes depending on multiple variables (X 1, X 2 , …, Xp ), which have to been controlled in order to achieve a final goal; this statistical tool leads to achieve a global optimum for each the individual variables of interest. In this technique two or more variables are evaluated at once, these are correlated to generate the global optimum that satisfies as much as possible the individual optimum of each variable considering acceptable all those values of the variable inside of the “desired” limits. The desirability function approach is one of the most widely used methods for the optimization of multiple response processes. It is based on the idea that the “quality” of a product or process that has multiple quality characteristics, with one of them outside of some “desired” limits, is completely unacceptable. The method finds operating conditions x that provide the “most desirable” response values (http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/, 2006). The objective of this work was determine the effect of three pretreatment factors (thermical treatment, alkalinization and sonication) on the Tequila’s stillages hydrolysis process in the acidogenesis stage, through the following response variables: soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs), total sugar and volatile fatty acids profile and the hydrogen production at the time."
1,Methods,
2,Tequila’s stillage,"2.1 Tequila’s stillage Stillages coming from a Tequila distillery of Jalisco, Mexico, processing Tequila 100% Agave, were frozen at −20°C until their utilization. The Tequila’s stillage used in this study has a total COD of 64,000mg/l, a sugars content of 19g/l and a VFAs concentration of 3g/l."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods The pH was measured using a potentiometer (Orion 520A+). For VFAs analysis, samples were centrifuged to 10,000rpm for 10min, a 1ml supernatant aliquot was taken into a clean 2ml vial then 1μl of extern standard (2-ethyl butyric acid) was added. Samples were thoroughly mixed with vortex; 1μl of sample was used for chromatography. VFAs were detected and quantified with a Perkin–Elmer Autosystem XL chromatographer using a capillary column (WCOT Fused Silica 25m×0.32mm ID Coating CP-Wax 25CB DF 0.2) with nitrogen as carrier gas; the temperature of the injector was 205°C, flame ionization detector (FID) temperature was 250°C. The soluble COD was measured according to the colorimetrical method of Knetchel (1978), samples were centrifuged to 10,000rpm for 10min, a 20μl aliquot of supernatant was taken for CODs analysis. Total reducing sugars were measured with the Phenol–Sulphuric method (Dubois et al., 1956) and total solids and volatile soluble solids were analyzed according to the APHA (1998). Gases were measured using a Perkin–Elmer Autosystem XL with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) chromatographer using molesieve 13X column with nitrogen as carrier gas."
4,Fermentation tests,"2.3 Fermentation tests A 1l glass vessel was used as model reactor with a working volume of 540ml. A 90% vinasse:10% inoculum mixture was added to the reactor and then purged with gaseous nitrogen for 15min and then sealed. A tedlar bag was used for gas capture. Temperature was controlled with a water bath to 35°C. The pH was adjusted manually twice a day, keeping it into a pH range varying from 6.5 to 7.5."
5,Inoculum,"2.4 Inoculum A digested sludge (14,158mgVSS/l and 1.74mgCOD/mgVSS) from a mesophilic reactor from a brewing plant was used as inoculum."
6,Experimental design,"2.5 Experimental design Tequila’s stillages were pretreated according to 23 experimental design (Neter et al., 1996). Based on previous studies, three independent variables (factors) were selected: X 1 for Alcalinization, pH was adjusted from 3.5 up to 12 and kept for 24h period, as reported previously by other authors (Carballa et al., 2004); X 2 for Thermal treatment, stillages were heated up to 150°C using a block heater for 30min, this considering a medium point to that reported previously; X 3 for Ultrasonic Sonication, stillages were sonicated to 47kHz for a 30min period using an Ultrasonic 104X (NDI) cleaner, since ultrasonic cleaner can help to destroy cells as observed in previous experiences (Espinoza-Escalante et al., 2006). All these levels are considered as the high level of a multifactor design (Table 1 ). The low levels were equal to current industrial characteristics of the stillages: pH 7 (even when it is initially 3.5, an adjustment to pH 7 was considered as low level), temperature of 70°C and without sonication (see Table 1). The analytical methods for determine each of the interest parameters were described above. Before seed the reactors, stillage’s pH was adjusted up to 7.0 with NaOH. The models were fitted to estimate the effect of pretreatments on each response variable through the MRS. To fit the models were used coded levels for the three factors (see Table 1)."
7,Computing of the multiple response optimization,"2.6 Computing of the multiple response optimization Multifactor variance analysis (ANOVA), linear regression models and response surface plots for each variable were computed using a statistical software program (Statgraphics Centurion XV). The best model for each response variable was obtained by the forward stepwise regression procedure (Neter et al., 1996). Then the optimum pretreatment condition for each variable was obtained using that model. After the analysis for each response variable, a MRO analysis (Derringer and Suich, 1980) was done; an optimization analysis was computed and plotted using Statgraphics Centurion XV. For MRO analysis, a desirability function was considered, it involves transformation of each estimated response variable ( Y ^ i ) to a desirability value di, where 0⩽ di ⩽ 1. The value of di increases as the “desirability” of the corresponding response increases. The individual desirabilities are then combined using the geometric mean, (1) D = ( d 1 ( Y 1 ) × d 2 ( Y 2 ) × … × d k ( Y k ) ) 1 / k with k denoting the number of responses. This single value of D gives the overall assessment of the desirability of the combined response levels. Clearly the range of D will fall in the interval [0,1] and D will increase as the balance of the properties becomes more favorable. D also has the property that if any di = 0 (that is, if one of the response variables is unacceptable) then D = 0 (that is, the overall product is unacceptable). It is for these reasons that the geometric mean, rather than some other function of the di ’s such as the arithmetic mean, is used (Derringer and Suich, 1980)."
8,Results and discussion,"It was analyzed the effect of pretreatments on the solubilization of the raw material present in the Tequila’s stillages (increment of the CODs, initially representing 60.5% of the total COD, 64g/l), as well as total reducing sugars (TRS) increment, (reducing sugars, expressed as glucose, contribute to the COD by 1.066g O2/g TRS, then TRS contribute to 53% approximately of the CODs). Both response variables help to evaluate the degree of hydrolysis, as the CODs leads to determine the hydrolysis/dissolution of the organic compounds (polysaccharides and other organic polymers, yeast cells, etc.) present in the Tequila’s stillages and the TRS show the hydrolysis of complex sugars, which is related to the availability of the main substrate for the acidogenic fermentation which produces the methane precursors. Finally, the effect of pretreatments was analyzed on the VFAs behavior profile as consequence of the hydrolysis of the raw material; each of three main acids were analyzed separately (acetic, propionic and butyric acids) since their presence in the reactor is considered for controlling the anaerobic digestion reactors and hydrogen yield was also evaluated as considered one of the most important energetic sources nowadays."
9,Pretreatments effect on CODs and total reducing sugars,"3.1 Pretreatments effect on CODs and total reducing sugars In Table 1 are shown the results of the 23 experimental design. The increments in soluble chemical oxygen demand (ΔCODs) demonstrate that effectively the non-dissolved compounds in the residual water were hydrolyzed and/or dissolved in water. In order to evaluate the effect of pretreatments on CODs increment rate was fitted a multiple regression model and applying the forward stepwise regression procedure the following equation was obtained: (2) CODs _ inc = 13.81 + 7.86 ∗ X 2 - 5.14 ∗ X 1 ∗ X 2 - 2.64 ∗ X 2 ∗ X 3 The determination coefficient R 2 was 0.968, the high value of R 2 implies a good model fitting for CODs increase. All terms in Eq. (2) are statistically significant with α compared versus a p-value of 0.05. The important effects that emerge from this analysis are the main effect of temperature (X 2) and the X 1 X 2 and X 2 X 3 interactions. Then temperature and its interaction with the other factors have an important effect on increasing CODs values, then hydrolyzing the organic material. A simple optimization analysis showed that the maximum increment in CODs is achieved with temperature (X 2) at the high level, and alkalinization (X 1) and cavitation (X 3) both at the low level. And as all low levels in the factors of Table 1 are equal to current industrial characteristics of the stillages, then only higher temperature is required to achieve the maximum increment in CODs. The experimental design matrix with the corresponding TRS increments (TRS_Inc) in Table 1 were subject to regression analysis, generating the following equation: (3) TRS _ inc = 2.76 + 0.94 ∗ X 1 + 1.36 ∗ X 2 + 0.89 ∗ X 3 - 1.54 ∗ X 1 ∗ X 2 ∗ X 3 where the determination coefficient (R 2) was 0.922. This value of R 2 indicates that the model had a high accuracy for fit the experimental results. all the coefficients were statistically significant because of lower p-values than α with α of 0.05. Then the three factors have an influence on TRS increments. An optimization analysis showed that maximum increments can be obtained when alkalinization (X 1) and temperature (X 2) are applied without applying cavitation. In this treatment a maximal increase rate of 5.71g/l was estimated compared to the 5.9g/l observed, Table 1."
10,Pretreatments effect on acidogenesis,"3.2 Pretreatments effect on acidogenesis In the acidogenesis of carbohydrates, H2 is also generated as an important product in addition to VFA and alcohols (Wang et al., 2005). Some stoichometric equations has been defined to describe the metabolism of glucose for H2 production (acidogenesis) where acetate and butyrate are the final products depending on the environmental conditions (Angenent et al., 2004), this is why, TRS consumption is evaluated in this study. From results of Table 1 it is observed that total consumed sugars (g) can be described in two groups, the first one when no pretreatment or only one pretreatment is applied the total consumed sugar are below 10g (18.5g/l), and the second group is observed when two or more pretreatments are applied with a consumption of about 11g (21g/l), this reinforce the idea that sugars are hydrolyzed and therefore more consumed. The experimental design matrix and the corresponding sugar consumption (g), Table 1, were subject to regression analysis, the model was then depurated by the forward stepwise regression procedure, the obtained equation is shown below Eq. (4); the determination coefficient was 0.981, the p-values for each coefficient are below to α with α of 0.05 (4) TRS _ cons = 9.61 + 0.59 ∗ X 1 + 1.31 ∗ X 2 + 0.51 ∗ X 3 - 0.96 ∗ X 1 ∗ X 2 ∗ X 3 Then in the best treatment (+1,+1,−1), the estimated maximal total consumed sugars was 11.96g, considering the working reactor volume in this study (540ml), the total consumed sugars was 22.8g/l, which is in good agreement with that reported by other authors. In their work Wang et al. (2005), reported that a sucrose concentration of 24.2g/l is advised for hydrogen production at mesophilic temperature (33.5°C). By their own, Cheong and Hansen (2006), reported an optimal glucose concentration in the reactor of 21.3g/l for hydrogen production when working in batch after optimization trials were carried out. Despite these results, not all the process variables are considered in these studies. Respect to the volatile fatty acids production, Table 1 is more difficult to observe a behavior pattern since in some cases the methanization process has began earlier, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (continuous line), and therefore at the end of 96h period time (time of the experiment) some of the produced VFAs have been consomed (e.g., acetic acid) whilst in other cases they remained or were increased until the end of the experiment Fig. 2 (dotted line), Figs. 3 and 4 . A complete profile of VFAs can be observed in Fig. 5 . In order to evaluate the effect of pretreatments on VFAs (acetic, propionic and butyric acids) increment rates, a multiple regression model was fitted to each variable; then forward stepwise regression procedures were performed. The three equations representing each acid increment rate are shown below. All coefficients in these equations are statistically significant with α below α =0.05: (5) Acetic acid = 1.59 + 0.52 ∗ X 1 - 0.36 ∗ X 2 + 0.40 ∗ X 1 ∗ X 3 + 0.29 ∗ X 2 ∗ X 3 (6) Propionic acid = 1.41 + 0.48 ∗ X 1 - 0.45 ∗ X 2 - 0.26 ∗ X 3 + 0.37 ∗ X 2 ∗ X 3 (7) Butyric acid = 2.20 + 0.12 ∗ X 3 - 0.28 ∗ X 1 ∗ X 2 + 0.24 ∗ X 1 ∗ X 3 + 0.14 ∗ X 2 ∗ X 3 According to these equations, alkalinization (X 1) has a positive effect on acetic and propionic acid and no effect on butyric acid production; temperature (X 2) has a negative effect on acetic and propionic acids accumulation; cavitation (X 3) has a negative effect on propionic acid increment. Combined pretreatments have positive effect on VFAs increments, but alkalinization–temperature (X 1 ∗ X 2) has a negative effect on butyric acid accumulation. This could mean in general that combined pretreatments have positive effect in hydrolysis thus in VFAs production. Maximal VFAs increment rates were calculated around 250–300%. According to the results of Kim et al. (2004), the use of thermal pretreatment combined with enzymatic pretreatment, a VFAs production increase of 340–380% are observed when fermenting food wastes. Differences between the results of our study and those of Kim et al. (2004) could be due to the fact that these lasts calculated total VFAs increase and applied other pretreatments than the used in this study. However, Kim et al. (2004) reported a maximal VFAs accumulation at 5days (120h), similar results were observed in our study."
11,Pretreatments effect on hydrogen production,"3.3 Pretreatments effect on hydrogen production An important objective of this study was to determine the pretreatments which improve hydrogen production. The experimental results of the H2 production (ml) are shown in Table 1. Applying multiple regression analysis, the final model (Eq. (8)) was obtained (8) H 2 ( ml ) = 968.38 - 203.38 ∗ X 1 - 279.62 ∗ X 3 - 325.38 X 1 ∗ X 3 The corresponding determination coefficient was 0.792 with all terms being statistically significant because of lower p-values than α with α of 0.05. According to the statistical analysis, the model shows that applying alkalinization at high level (X 1 =+1) and cavitation at low level cavitation (X 3 =−1) is possible to get a higher H2 production, with a slight difference to that treatment were alkalinization is set to −1 and cavitation to +1, then opposed levels of alkalinization and cavitation are advised in order to get high hydrogen productions. This agrees with the fact that acetic acid accumulation, the main substrate for H2 production (Lin and Chang, 1999; Lay, 2000), is mainly affected by alkalinization and cavitation, Eq. (5). Among the newer works related to hydrogen production, Lee et al. (2006), developed a carrier-induced granular sludge bed (CIGSB) bioreactor able to significantly enhance H2-producing efficiency by gaining a high biomass concentration of up to 26g VSS/l even when it was operated at a low HRT of 0.5h, achieving hydrogen yields varying from 2 to 4mol H2/mol sucrose. Mu et al. (2006) in their experiments achieved maximal hydrogen yields in the range of 1–2 mol H2/mol glucose. Fang et al. (2006) reported a hydrogen production rate of 346ml H2/g of carbohydrate, using rice as model carbohydrate. Zhang et al. (2006), reported hydrogen yields of 0.9mol H2/mol of glucose in a trickle bed reactor; working in CSTR’s Iyer et al. (2004), reported H2 yields of 1.6mol H2/mol glucose; working in batch, Wang et al. (2005) found an optimal hydrogen yield of 3.728mol H2/mol sucrose. Finally, in our study it has been demonstrated that Tequila’s stillages have a great potential to be used as substrate for hydrogen production, since a production rate of 1.55mol H2/mol glucose can be achieved when the optimal pretreatment is applied, result that is in good agreement with the results reported by other authors as mentioned above. Given that Tequila’s stillages have a great potential for hydrogen production and considering the economical analysis presented by Van Ginkel et al. (2005) and the annual generation of this wastewater (50 million liters; www.crt.org.mx), the hydrogen produced could represent an annual income of $67,000 USD. Moreover, the purifying process must be considered."
12,Multiple response analysis for acidogenesis,"3.4 Multiple response analysis for acidogenesis The MRO was applied in order to determine the global optimum treatment, and then to achieve the objective of the study: minimize propionic acid increment, usually desired in anaerobic digestion processes as reported by authors like Wang et al. (2006), and maximize all the remaining variables, considering as the most important variables hydrogen production. With these restrictions was transformed each estimated response variable Eq. (2) to Eq. (8) to a desirability value di where 0⩽ di ⩽1. And then according to Eq. (1) was obtained the desirability function. According to the optimization analysis, it was observed that the higher desirability value, 0.724, is achieved with the following combination of pretreatments in codified levels: X 1 =−1, X 2 =+1 and X 3 =+1, this is, Tequila’s stillages must be subject to alkalinization up to pH 7, thermical treatment (Temperature) of 150°C/30min and cavitation treatment at 47kHz/30min; time periods can be addressed since only the value of the parameter per se is taking in count for the analysis. According to predictions with Eq. (8) (hydrogen production) for the desirability function, it was observed that from the eight possible treatments (only vertices), in six cases desirability value equals to zero (e.g., the low level of the three factors X 1 =−1, X 2 =−1, X 3 =−1), but a high values of desirability can be observed when temperature (X 2) and cavitation (X 3) are applied when alkalinization is set at low level. Fig. 6 shows the contour plot where each curve connecting points of temperature (X 2) and Cavitation (X 3) where the response has a same particular value. It can be seen that X 2 has a high impact on desirability increasing desirability as the level of X 2 increases and slight increase on desirability is observed as X 3 level does. In previous studies oriented to the optimization of the anaerobic digestion process, and mainly to hydrogen production optimization, it has been proposed a two-step anaerobic digestion concept coming from the fact that this biological process involves generally two stages: the acidogenesis and the phase of methane production (Alexiou and Panter, 2004). The two stages design takes advantage of the phase’s separation phenomenon occurring naturally at different kinetic values, and then the use of separated units for hydrolysis and methanogenesis would imply cost reductions and efficiency improvements in hydrogen and methane production as well as in the stability of the anaerobic digestion plant (Alexiou and Panter, 2004). In addition to the above mentioned advantages of the two-stage process, operational differences can be attached. In classical anaerobic digestion process (mono-stage), organic load must be controlled in order to avoid the VFAs accumulation in the reactor, preventing a fermentation accident in the system, as other organic acids different from acetic acid are slower degraded to methane than acetic acid is. In the counterpart, in the two-step anaerobic digestion, in the first stage (acetogenesis) VFAs accumulation in important quantities is permitted and desired (Hu et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2001; Mu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005), so the organic load to treat can be higher, this profile corresponds to the fermentation accident mentioned above, preparing the methanogenic archeas to a mixture of acids (propionic and butyric) and a noteworthy development of the obligated hydrogen producing acetogens can be observed, these will degrade the VFAs in syntrophic association with methanogenic archeas in second stage (Bories, 1980). The acetogenesis stage however, is not as robust as it could be thought, even when it is feasible to treat high organic loads and VFAs accumulation is permitted, and the hydrolysis of the raw material is a primary concern in this stage. This is why some considerations must be done in order to: (i) achieve the maximum hydrolysis of the polymeric compounds for the maximum acidification (main indicator of the acetogenesis) in the reactor, and (ii) find the best VFAs profile for the desired objective. The effect of simple operational parameters on acidogenesis, is referred in literature (e.g., Decloux and Bories, 2002; Swamy et al., 1998), but a global optimization is needed in order to observe the effect of a group of factors over a group of variables at once. The MRO, however, is able to respond to the increasing demands of the scientific and technological questions oriented to process optimization, given that this powerful statistical tool can identify the best operational parameters, for the process under study, in a well defined range of desired values for many variables at once, as shown above, the MRO was an useful tool to determine which combination of pretreatments accomplished, as much as possible, all the desired objectives of this study at once including the imposed restrictions, having an overall accomplishment of 72.4% when considering the global optimum (X 1 =−1, X 2 =+1 and X 3 =+1). Optimal values for each variable under study are shown in Table 2 ."
13,Conclusions,"Tequila’s stillages represent an important pollution problem in Mexico given the increasing demand of Tequila in the international market, with the consequent generation of stillages in the order of 10 liters per liter of produced Tequila. According to the results presented in this work, it was found that Tequila’s stillages can become a secondary income to the Mexican industries given their potential for hydrogen production. In our study, it was observed that temperature and cavitation pretreatments highly improve the digestion potential by hydrolyzing or dissolving the complex compounds of the Tequila’s stillages and therefore the consumption rate of reducing sugars and the acidogenesis process. The aim of the statistical tools, in this case MRO, was useful in helping to observe these results globally at same time that facilitates the decision taking, as well it offers the opportunity to get models which correlate the available information in order to make improving changes in the process for the future or well changes oriented to the desired objectives."
