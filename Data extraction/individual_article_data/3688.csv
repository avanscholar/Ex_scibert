0,Introduction,"Pharmaceutical wastewater is mainly generated by chemical-synthetic industries, the components are complicated because of the high chemical oxygen demand (COD), toxicity and a low biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/COD ratio (Kasprzyjk-Horden et al., 2008; Sreekanth et al., 2009). In some chemical synthesis pharmaceutical industries, m-cresol (MC) and iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) are used as the solvent in the productive process of β-lactam, steroids, vitamins, cephalosporins and intermediates and so on. For instance, in the production of cephazolin which the 7-Phenglacetamido-3-chloromethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid p-methoxybenzyl ester (GCLE) was employed as raw materials, GCLE will react to generate GTDE, then through the reaction of cracking, crystallization in the production of ATDA where need to add MC. The IPA is added in the process of cafazolin acid salt formatting cefazolin sodium. As a result, pharmaceutical wastewater containing solvent of MC and IPA is produced from theses pharmaceutical industries. This wastewater has the characteristics of highly corrosive, toxicity and carcinogenicity (ATSDR, 1992a; Jiang et al., 2006; Bai et al., 2007). Once the pollutants were inhaled or absorbed by the skin, it may lead to the damage of liver and kidney (Andersen, 2006; Leclercq et al., 2014), headaches, dizziness, eye irritation even induce cancer (John Kennedy et al., 2007; Tu et al., 2012; Rossitza, 2015). It not only affects human health, but also shows the impact on biological survival. In addition, cresols (including o-cresol, MC and p-cresol) which are listed as priority pollutants by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Chen et al., 2017a), are major toxic pollutants in phenolic compounds (Surkatti and El-Naas, 2014a). Numerous IPA exposures have been reported in the medical and medico-legal literature and sometimes result in fatal outcomes (Alexander et al., 1982; Kelner and Bailey, 1983; Gaulier et al., 2011; Palmiere et al., 2012). Therefore, it is urgently to treat pharmaceutical wastewater containing MC and IPA by appropriate and efficient technologies (Klavarioti et al., 2009). Currently, multiple studies have reported that MC and IPA can be treated by carbon adsorption (Viraraghavan, 1998; Schmotzer et al., 2002; Shen, 2002; Sun and Chen, 2014), ion exchange (Surkatti and El-Naas, 2014b; Choi et al., 2016a) and chemical oxidation (Du et al., 2012) and biological methods (ATSDR, 1992b). However, physical and chemical processes have some defections. Adsorption is only used to treat low concentration MC wastewater (less than 200 mg/L) and the high cost of activated carbon is discovered comparing with biological methods (Ahmaruzzaman, 2008; Lin and Juang, 2009; Chen et al., 2017b). The ion exchange method can be used to treat MC wastewater with a concentration of 100–600 mg/L (Bai, 2016). Chemical oxidation, a destructive treatment, cannot recycle cresols and reuse oxidants and it even has relative higher operating cost (Zhou et al., 2017). Biological treatments are the practical and favored approach compared to physical and chemical processes since its cost-effectiveness, high efficiency and safety. Historically, anaerobic process is the most common biological technology for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater or high-strength wastewaters as it requires no oxygen, reduces biomass yield and low-energy consumption compared to aerobic process (Ng et al., 2015a). Chelliapan et al. (2011) reported that a unique up-flow anaerobic stage reactor (UASR) was employed to treat pharmaceutical wastewater, indicating the removal efficiency of COD was 45% with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.7 kgCOD/(m3·d). Chelliapan and Golar (2011) employed an upflow anaerobic fixed bed reactor could effectively remove 60–70% of the COD with an OLR of 1.5–4.6 kgCOD/(m3·d) in the antibiotic solvent pharmaceutical wastewater. Li et al. (2015) used an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) to treat chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater containing rich organic sulfur compounds and sulfate, the COD removal decreased nearly 70% under condition of OLR of 8 kgCOD/(m3·d). Furthermore, there are a few anaerobic processes applied in the treatment of MC and IPA wastewater, to authors’ knowledge. However, the traditional anaerobic process is incapable of achieving the complete separation of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and sludge retention time (SRT), resulting in the loss of anaerobic sludge from the reactor and poor effluent quality. Based on this, it should be drew attention to provide an effective wastewater treatment technology which have many advantages than other anaerobic bioreactor to solve the above issue and study the related reactor performance. AnMBR is a kind of wastewater treatment technology which combines membrane separation and anaerobic bioreactor. The microorganisms are completely blocked in the bioreactor by membrane module to achieve the separation of HRT and SRT, ensuring the high concentration of sludge, and then the reactor could obtain effective organic contaminants removal and resistance of impact loads. AnMBR offers many other advantages over traditional anaerobic processes, such as smaller footprints, longer SRT, shorten HRT, less sludge production, in which brought better effluent qualities and the rapid start-up of biological processes (Visvanathan et al., 2000; Yigit et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010). Recently, the feasibility of AnMBR in treating high-strength wastewater containing refractory contaminants has been verified by lots of studies. As Zayen et al. (2010), an AnMBR was used to treat landfill leachate could achieved a COD removal up to 90% at OLR of 6.27 kgCOD/(m3·d). Galib et al. (2016) reported that the AnMBR achieved COD removal efficiency of 88–95% with OLR increased from 0.4 to 3.2 kgCOD/(m3·d) for the treatment of meat-processing wastewater. Although many AnMBRs were applied in the treatment of industrial and pharmaceutical pollutants, there was rarely attention on the treatment of solvent wastewater, especially containing the deleterious MC and IPA which were used largely. Moreover, the overall performance and suitable operating condition of reactor should be researched to give reliable and economic reference in the future wastewater treatment of pharmaceutical solvents. Accordingly, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance and methane fermentation characteristics at different HRTs (48, 36, 24, 18 and 12 h) by applying a pilot-scale AnMBR. The reactor was composed of an internal circulation (IC) anaerobic reactor as the anaerobic pretreatment process which has superior removal efficiency compared with the technology of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) as bioreactor in the traditional AnMBR, and membrane module as the anaerobic post-treatment process for the treatment of the IC reactor effluent. The ability of removal MC and IPA pollutants, VFA and terminal fermentation products, bicarbonate alkalinity, biogas production, methane content, as well as the methanogenic community was studied in this paper. Then the most appropriate HRT was discussed mainly based on MC and IPA removal and methane content, the ratio of permeate VFA and bicarbonate alkalinity."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental apparatus,"2.1 Experimental apparatus A schematic diagram of pilot-scale anaerobic process was shown in Fig. 1 . The system combined an anaerobic internal circulation (IC) and membrane modules. Detailed parameters of the IC system used in this research were listed as follows: height 1.5 m, internal diameter 2.5 m, providing a working volume of approximately 4.4 m3. The membrane module was hollow fiber curtain membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (HT-MBR-20-PVDF, Hangzhou Haotian Membrane Technology Co., Ltd., China) with a pore size of 0.22 μm. There are four membrane components; each membrane has area of 7 m2 with a total area of 28 m2. In fact, there are 20 m2 of membrane area which are able to meet the experimental needs according to the designed membrane flux. So when a membrane is under backwashing, the other three can work properly, and it will not affect system productivity in terms of permeate volume. The maximum operating temperature of this membrane module was 40 °C, the range of pH was 2–13. The wastewater was sucked into the IC by a pump. The pump and flow meter can change the flow rate, thereby changing the HRT of the reactor. The bottom of the IC reactor is a kind of mixing area, including the influent, granular sludge and the regurgitant water-sludge mixture of gas-liquid separation zone. These substances adequately mix in this area. The water-sludge mixture emerged in mixing area inflowing into the first anaerobic area. Most organics (solvent) could be conversed as the biogas in the role of high concentration suspended granular sludge. The acute disturbance from upwelling of the mixed liquid and methane make the suspended granular sludge is in the situation of swelling and fluidifying, which could strengthen the contact of wastewater with suspended granular sludge and also improve the removal efficiency. With the increased production of biogas, part of the mixture of suspended granular sludge and wastewater is raised to the top gas-liquid separation area. After the treatment of the first anaerobic zone, some of the solvent waste water was lifted by the biogas, and the rest was passed through the three-phase separator into the second anaerobic zone. In this area, the solvent water would be further degraded by suspended granular sludge. The water-sludge mixture in the second anaerobic area flows into the setting area and is operated by the solid-liquid separation. The sedimentary particles return to the mud bed in the second anaerobic area. The supernatant flowed from the bottom up to membrane module by outlet pipe. Then the wastewater was driven by the pressure difference transmembrane pressure TMP on both sides of the membrane, and the hollow fiber membrane made of PVDF was used as the filter medium. Under certain pressure, when the wastewater flowed through the membrane surface, many small pores of membrane surface only allow water and small molecules to pass through. While the substance which larger than the membrane pore diameter was blocked in bioreactor to remove. The sludge attacting on the membrane surface could remove for second time to insure the AnMBR removal rate. In addition, the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), pH, and temperature of the IC reactor are detected by an online control system. Finally, the treated wastewater flows from the membrane module, completing the whole process. The AnMBR system was equipped with a biogas–water–chemical backwashing system. A backwashing was conducted at 72nd day due to the high TMP which achieved 60 kPa during long-term operation. The detailed implementation process was described as follows: In the first place, when membrane module 20 was under backwashing, the other three membrane modules maintained normal operation. The membrane module 20 was first cleaned with biogas for 10 min at a flow rate of 500 L/min meanwhile the valve 24, valve 39, valve 40 were closed, the valve 25–33, valve 38, valve 43, valve 44 were opened. Next, the modules were subject to a simultaneous biogas wash (flow rate, 500 L/h) and water wash (flow rate, 20 L/min) for 10 min when the valve 39 was opened. Then, closing the valve 39 and opening the valve 40, the modules were further cleaned with chemicals (flow rate, 5 L/min) and biogas (flow rate, 500 L/h) for 30 min simultaneously. Finally the membrane modules were backwashed with water for 20 min at a flow rate of 20 L/min meanwhile the valves of 40 and 43 were closed, and the valve 39 was opened. Chemicals used in the present work were a mixed solution containing 95% ethanol and 5% sodium hypochlorite. Membrane permeate was used as washing and backwashing water. After the backwashing of membrane module 20 was finished, and then clean the membrane module 21, membrane module 22, membrane module 23 in turn by similar method. Through the operation of the above membrane modules have been theoretically complete cleaning."
3,Operating conditions,"2.2 Operating conditions After 43 days of start-up and stable period (COD removal efficiency was basically stable at about 94%), we started an experimental study for 80 days. 15 days of running data were conducted during different HRT conditions in the study to better illustrate the phenomenon for the anaerobic process. The variations of operational parameters are listed in Table S1. The HRTs were 48, 36, 24, 18 and 12 h and the temperature was 35 ± 1 °C. Cross flow velocity (CFV) was 0.8 ± 0.1 m/s and transmembrane pressure (TMP) was 40–60 kPa. The TMP value was obtained by reading the vacuumatic pressure gauge daily, the constant flux was controlled by the flow meter and the pump speed every day. The flux of each HRT was 92 L/h, 122 L/h, 183 L/h, 244 L/h, and 366 L/h. The TMP during the start-up period was 10–30 kPa, and the TMP during the steady-run period was 30–40 kPa. Therefore, the TMP at the beginning of this study was 40 kPa. However, with long-term operation, pressure increasing was formed at constant flux. The changing graphic of TMP-flux was given in Fig. S2. The membrane module was backwashed at 72nd day due to the TMP reached 60 kPa. The TMP dropped after a wash but it could not reach the original value."
4,The wastewater quality and the inoculation of anaerobic sludge,"2.3 The wastewater quality and the inoculation of anaerobic sludge The synthetic wastewater containing MC and IPA were tested at five different HRTs. The total concentration of influent COD was 4250–5129 mg/L. In order to conduct a single-factor effect experiment, the concentrations of influent MC and IPA were controlled at a range of 370–440 mg/L and 60–81 mg/L, respectively. The specific water quality indicators are showed in Table 1 . In the start-up of experiment, glucose was added to the wastewater simultaneously as the co-substrate (1000 mg glucose is about 1066.7 mg/L COD), forming the glucose and pharmaceutical wastewater. As the progress of start-up the glucose concentration in the wastewater was gradually reduced, while the concentration of antibiotics solvent was increased. During the 23-day start-up period, the HRT remained at 48 h, the influent MC gradually increased to 200 mg/L, and the IPA concentration gradually increased to 20 mg/L. The reactor then entered a stable period of 20 days, the influent MC increased from 200 mg/L to 400 mg/L, and the IPA increased from 20 mg/L to 60 mg/L. Therefore, anaerobic sludge was domesticated to degrade antibiotic solvents, and eventually it became a complete pharmaceutical wastewater. The experiment after the stable operation period was the major object of this study. Consequently, the chart of this paper will not contain the data of start-up period and stable operating period. Inoculation and domestication are carried out simultaneously in this experiment, four types of anaerobic sludge were chosen as inoculation sludge, which were taken from the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in Harbin Traditional Chinese Medicine Factory, up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor in North China Pharmaceutical Factory, Harbin Brewery Internal Circulation (IC) reactor and Wenchang Wastewater Treatment Plant secondary clarifier, respectively. The detailed characteristic of anaerobic sludge of CSTR was as follows: mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS), mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) and MLVSS/MLSS were 14.7 g/L, 11.6 g/L, and 0.79, respectively. The MLSS, MLVSS, MLVSS/MLSS of UASB were 39.8 g/L, 24.7 g/L and 0.62. The MLSS, MLVSS, MLVSS/MLSS of IC were 20.5 g/L, 13.3 g/L and 0.65. The MLSS, MLVSS, MLVSS/MLSS of secondary clarifier sludge were 6.8 g/L, 5.5 g/L and 0.81. The inoculation ratio was 1: 1: 1: 1 (V: V: V: V) of each sludge to obtain abundant microbial communities, accelerate the start-up process of the AnMBR and shorten the start-up time of the reactor. The MLSS, MLVSS, MLVSS/MLSS of inoculated sludge were 16.5 g/L, 12.4 g/L and 0.75 at last."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods In this study, the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation. The specific operating conditions for the IC reactor sludge sample mixture first centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min and then filtered through 0.22 μm filter. MC concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (Chen et al., 2016). The concentration of IPA was determined by gas chromatograph (Choi et al., 2016b). The total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration in the reactor (Scoma et al., 2016a) and the compositions of VFAs were determined by a SP-502 gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame ion detector (Scoma et al., 2016b). The bicarbonate alkalinity in the reactor was measured by titration (Lafay et al., 2014). The biogas production was assessed by measuring the headspace pressure with a manometer. The analysis of community structure diversity of anaerobic sludge was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A combined detergent and bead beating procedure (Ultra Clean Soil DNA Kit. Mo Bio Laboratories Inc., Solana Beach, CA, USA) was used to extract DNA. A total DNA sample was used as a template for PCR amplification using 16SrRNA gene primers ARC787F (5′-ATTAGATACCCSBGTAGTCC-3′) and ARC1059R (5′-GCCATGCACCWCCTCT-3′). The PCR reaction system was 50 μL, including 5 μL PCR buffer, 1 μL dNTPmix, 5 μL DNA modulus, 1 μL upstream primer, 1 μL downstream primer, 1 μL Taq enzyme, and 36 μL sterile water. The PCR reaction conditions were: pre-denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 45 s, annealing temperature at each cycle was reduced by 0.5 °C, and 55 °C for 20 cycles; 94 °C denaturation 1 min; 55 °C annealing 45 s, 72 °C extension 45 s, 10 cycles; 72 °C final extension 8 min. Detection of PCR products was 1% agarose electrophoresis. The bands in the DGGE map were cut out and the DNA samples in the bands were recovered and used as a template for secondary PCR amplification. The amplified products were purified and sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd."
6,Calculation of removal efficiency,"2.5 Calculation of removal efficiency The total removal efficiency was calculated as influent pollutants minus permeate pollutants and then divided influent pollutants. The biological removal efficiency was calculated as influent pollutants minus supernatant pollutants and then divided influent pollutants. The physical removal efficiency was the total removal efficiency minus the biological removal efficiency. The detailed equation for the percentage of each pollutant removal is listed as follows: MC R . E . , IPA R . E . = MC in , IPA in , – MC per , IPA per MC in , IPA in × 100 % MC B . E . , IPA B . E . = MC in , IPA in − MC sup , IPA sup , MC in , IPA in × 100 % MC P . E . , IPA P . E . = MC R . E . , IPA R . E . − MC B . E . , IPA B . E . where MCR.E.., IPAR.E were represent the MC, IPA total removal efficiencies; MCB.E.., IPAB.E were represent the MC, IPA biological removal efficiencies; MCP.E.., IPAP.E were represent the MC, IPA physical removal efficiencies; MCin, IPAin, were represent the influent MC, IPA; MCsup, IPAsup, were represent the supernatant MC, IPA; MCper, IPAper, were represent the permeate MC, IPA;"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Removal of MC and IPA,"3.1 Removal of MC and IPA MC removal from pharmaceutical wastewater of the AnMBR was investigated under five different HRTs (48, 36, 24, 18 and12 h). As it can be seen in Fig. 2 , the concentration of influent MC fluctuated in a range of 370–440 mg/L with a MC loading rate of 0.19–0.82 kgMC/(m3·d). As shown in Fig. 2a, supernatant MC gradually increased at 18 h and 12 h with average values of 119.8 mg/L and 149.4 mg/L, respectively. The corresponding biological removal efficiency (Fig. 2b) exhibited a decreasing trend, indicating that the shorter HRT had caused a higher organic load, which had caused an impact on the bioreactor. The change of permeate MC was stable regardless of HRT variation, the average value was 20.16 mg/L. The average total removal efficiencies were 96.03%, 95.4%, 93.6%, 94.9% and 94.6% at each stage with no obvious defects, which demonstrated that the AnMBR system performed well in the MC removal. Interestingly, there was a great difference between biological and physical removal efficiency of MC at different HRTs. With the decrease of HRT, MC biological removal efficiency declined with average of 76.8%, but MC physical removal efficiency increased with average of 18.2% (Fig. 2b). MC biological removal efficiency reduced from 86.3 ± 1.93% to 62.9 ± 3.67% when HRT dropped from 36 to 12 h in Fig. 2c, on the contrary, physical removal efficiency increased from 9.2 ± 2.6% to 31.7 ± 3.9%. It could be explained that the dynamic biofilm formed on the membrane surface played a very important role in ensuring the removal effect of MC, especially at shorter HRT. Fig. 2 also showed the concentration of influent IPA, permeate IPA and the remove efficiency of IPA. Influent IPA concentration fluctuated between 60 and 81 mg/L, corresponding to IPA loading rate of 0.03–0.17 kgIPA/(m3·d) during the 80 days. The supernatant IPA remained at a low level with the average of 7 mg/L when HRT was 48–12 h (Fig. 2d). The trend of permeate IPA kept steady, the average permeate IPA were 2.94 mg/L, 3.56 mg/L, 1.3 mg/L, 2.9 mg/L, 3.9 mg/L when HRT were 48 h, 36 h, 24 h, 18 h, 12 h. The low values (0.9–1.7 mg/L) were found at HRT of 24 h. The total removal efficiency of IPA maintained at a stable level of 96% and the high value was obtained with the average value of 98.2% at HRT of 24 h. In general, HRT should be greater than 18 h in order to have better removal efficiency. The variation of IPA biological removal efficiency and IPA physical removal efficiency was not distinct (Fig. 2e). The IPA biological removal efficiencies were 90.2 ± 1.2%, 90.3 ± 2.6%, 92.8 ± 1.5%, 89.7 ± 1.4%, 89.5 ± 1.9% and the IPA physical removal efficiencies were 5.2 ± 1.05%, 4.5 ± 1.9%, 5.4 ± 1.1%, 6.5 ± 0.4%, 5.5 ± 2.6% at each HRT(Fig. 2f)."
9,"Volatile fatty acid, bicarbonate alkalinity and terminal fermentation products","3.2 Volatile fatty acid, bicarbonate alkalinity and terminal fermentation products VFA is the intermediate products from the acidogenic step of the anaerobic process. HRT is an important factor for VFA, bicarbonate alkalinity, terminal fermentation products and pH. The floating range of permeate VFA was 137–1328 mg/L and bicarbonate alkalinity was 2861–762 mg/L (Fig. 3 a) at different HRTs. At the former four stages (HRT: 48-18 h), the trends of permeate VFA and bicarbonate alkalinity were stable, the average value of permeate VFA and bicarbonate alkalinity was 240.6 mg/L and 2364.1 mg/L, respectively. But, permeate VFA significantly accumulated (maximum value of 1328 mg/L) with average value of 1053.3 mg/L and the bicarbonate alkalinity sharply declined to 762 mg/L with average value of 948.8 mg/L when HRT decreased to 12 h, indicating that the operation of the reactor had been affected at shorter HRT. The value of alpha was the ratio of permeate VFA and bicarbonate alkalinity. Therefore, alpha value also can be used to evaluate the permeate VFA and bicarbonate alkalinity simultaneously, and further explore the performance of reactor. As the value of alpha became larger, the increase of VFA and the decrease in the bicarbonate alkalinity were not good for the reactor. Some researchers had proposed the evaluation of anaerobic reaction stability based on the relationship between VFA and bicarbonate alkalinity. Chaiprapat et al. (2016) suggested that the alpha value should be maintained at 0.4 in order to improve the anaerobic digestion. Khoufi et al. (2015) stated that the ratio of less than 0.3 was required for successful operation of anaerobic reactor. In this study, the value of alpha was sharply increased from 0.7 to 1.6 when HRT was 12 h. However, the value of alpha was less than 0.3 (in range of 0.07–0.16) at 48-18 h. Therefore, a stable reactor performance was obtained when HRT≥18 h. The pH had slightly decreased with a range of 6.3–6.7 which corresponding a higher VFA production when the HRT was 12 h (Fig. 3c). The maximum concentration of VFA was 1328 mg/L at pH of 6.5. This conclusion was consistent with Xing et al. (2014), who studied the process of actual antibiotic fermentation-based pharmaceutical wastewater by using anaerobic and aerobic moving bed biofilm reactors combined with ozone/hydrogen peroxide process and found that the maximum VFAs production was 931.75 mg/L, at pH = 6.5. In addition, the pH of AnMBR was in a narrow range of 7.1–7.8 when the HRT was above or equal to 18 h, indicating that the AnMBR remained constant permeate during the former four stages. The hydrolytic acidification of the anaerobic process can transform macromolecular and bio-refractory molecular substances into simple ones, then the simple molecular substance is decomposed into VFA, such as, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid. Fig. 3b showed that, acetic acid was dominant; propionic acid was second, followed by butyric acid during all the experimental period. This was consistent with previous studies (Wijekoon et al., 2011). The average concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid were 68.0 mg/L, 47.6 mg/L, and 28.5 mg/L when HRT was more than 12 h (Fig. 3b). Once the HRT reduced to12 h, the concentration of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid began to increase drastically, up to 511.2 mg/L of acetic acid, 346.8 mg/L of propionic acid and 187.3 mg/L of butyric acid."
10,Analysis of biogas production,"3.3 Analysis of biogas production The variations of biogas production, methane content and biogas yield at different HRTs are shown in Fig. 4 . The biogas production maintained at a higher level during the 55 days of operation (HRT was 48–18 h). The average biogas productions were 37.4 L/d, 53.3 L/d when the HRTs were 48 h, 18 h. The biogas production dramatically increased with average value of 43.9 L/d when HRT was 36 h. At the end of second stage (HRT: 36 h), the biogas production reached 62.8 L/d. The stable biogas production was discovered with average value of 56.2 L/d and most of them were higher than other HRTs, as well as the highest value (75 L/d) was found during the 30–40 days (HRT was 24 h). It is noteworthy that biogas production dramatically declined (the lowest value was 27.2 L/d) due to permeate VFA accumulated when HRT felled to 12 h. The biogas yield showed a declined trend with the decrease of HRT as illustrated in Fig. 4. The average biogas yield of the AnMBR were 0.18 L/gCODremoval, 0.14 L/gCODremoval, 0.12 L/gCODremoval, 0.08 L/gCODremoval respectively, when the HRTs were 48 h, 36 h, 24 h 18 h. The biogas yield was decreased to 0.035 L/gCODremoval with the average value of 0.04 L/gCODremoval when HRT reduced to 12 h. It could be interpreted that methanogenesis was inhibited under shorter HRT. The measured methane content in this study is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4. The methane content showed an upward trend with average value of 76.2% when HRT was 48 h. The average proportion of methane was 78.5% when HRT was 36 h, bigger than the value of 71.4% (HRT: 24 h). Therefore, 36 h was more suitable for methanogen to accumulate. However, the methane content slightly declined when HRT was 24 and 18 h, the average values were 71.5% and 60.0% respectively. The methane content obviously reduced with the average of 46.4% when HRT was 12 h. Moreover, 63.8–80.3% of methane was detected in the biogas during the 1–49 days, which is relatively consistent with the previous studies. Shi et al. (2014) applied an UASB reactor for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater and show that the methane content in biogas was 65–73%. Ng et al. (2015b) also reported that nearly 60–70% of methane was detected in the biogas produced in anaerobic MBRs reactor for the pharmaceutical wastewater treatment. Results showed that the optimal HRT was 36 h of AnMBR in this paper through the comprehensive analysis of the MC and IPA removal, methane content and stable performance of reactor."
11,Analysis of methanogenic community,"3.4 Analysis of methanogenic community Four kinds of methanogens were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, including methanosaetaceae, methanosarcinaceae, methanobacteriales, and methanomicrobiales. Methanosaetaceae and methanosarcinaceae were considered the acetoclastic methanogens (Conklin and Ferguson, 2006; Zamalloa et al., 2012). Fig. 5 illustrated that dominant microbial community was always methanosarcinaceae regardless of the change in acetic acid concentration during the 80 days. When the HRT was 48–18 h, the average relative abundance of methanosarcinaceae maintained at 15.7%. When HRT was reduced to 12 h, the acetic acid concentration sharply increased. Meanwhile, the average relative abundance of methanosarcinaceae was 31% (the maximum value was 33%), indicating that methanosarcinaceae can proliferate under the high concentration of acetic acid. As shown in Fig. 5, the number of methanosaetaceae was stable when HRT were 48 h, 36 h, 24 h and 18 h. And the average relative abundance was 6.4%, 6.6%, 7.5%, and 7.6%. However, the amount of methanosaetaceae was gradually decreased with the increase of acetic acid concentration when HRT dropped from 18 h to 12 h. Corresponding to relative abundance was below 4%. Therefore, it can be concluded that methanosaetaceae were capable of growing abundantly at low acetic acid concentration. This conclusion was consistent with Sudini et al. (2007a). Two kinds of hydrogen utilizing methanogenic groups (methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales) were found in the AnMBR (Sudini et al., 2007b). Methanobacteriales remained at lower lever during the operation time. Methanobacteriales changed inconspicuously with the average values of 2.2%, 2.0%, 2.3%, 2.4% when HRT were 48 h, 36 h, 24 h and 18 h. Methanobacteriales slightly increased to 5% with average of 4.0% when HRT was reduced to 12 h. Methanomicrobiales was the dominant hydrogen utilizers throughout the operational period. The average abundances of the methanomicrobiales were 16%, 15%, 15.3%, 14.2% when HRT were 48–18 h. The abundance of the methanomicrobiales increased to 33% (the average abundance of 30%) when HRT was shortened to12 h. It is worth noting that some strains of methanosarcina also can utilize hydrogen. However, hydrogen as a growth substrate for methanosarcina spp. in complex microbial communities has not been studied extensively. A few studies have shown that methanosarcina spp. cannot compete with other hydrogen using methane bacteria as a substrate for hydrogen in most anaerobic reactors (Zinder, 1993)."
12,Conclusions,"This study has illustrated that the AnMBR can be effective as a technological mean for treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing MC and IPA, the satisfactory removal efficiency was achieved during the whole experiment. With the reduction of HRT, the biological removal efficiency gradually decreased and the physical removal efficiency gradually increased which proved the importance of the membrane. When HRT was reduced to 12 h, the accumulation of VFA and decrease of bicarbonate alkalinity was observed, in addition, the methane content was small at this time. The biogas production increased rapidly when HRT was 36 h, meanwhile, the methane content was bigger than other HRTs. The biogas yield also showed a declined trend with the decrease of HRT. Methanosaetaceae was capable of growing abundantly at low acetic acid concentration. Low level of acetate corresponded to a high abundance of methanosarcinaceae and methanomicrobiales. Based on the comprehensive performance of reactor and economic feasibility, HRT of 36 h was considered as the most suitable in the operation of the AnMBR."
