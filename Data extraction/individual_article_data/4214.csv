0,Introduction,"Pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas that is associated with high mortality due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Approximately 3% of emergency admissions to general surgery are patients with pancreatitis in the United Kingdom, with mortality of approximately 1–7%, and approximately 10% to 18% for those with severe pancreatitis [1]. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of pancreatitis is not well understood. Currently, there is no effective drug to treat pancreatitis, and fluid resuscitation and supportive treatment are the main treatment options for acute pancreatitis [2]. However, multiple signaling pathways and immune cells have been implicated in the inflammatory response to pancreatitis; endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), impaired autophagic flux and its interaction with the inflammatory response and damaged mitochondria are important mechanisms in the development of pancreatitis. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a new natural antioxidant that was first reported for its selective scavenging of hydroxyl free radicals and peroxynitrite anions in the treatment of oxidative stress [3]. Recent studies have shown that H2 can significantly improve tissue damage and reduce mortality from pancreatitis [4,5]. This therapeutic effect of H2 may be related to antioxidative stress [4,6], anti-inflammation [6], anti-acinar cell apoptosis [7] and the regulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [4], mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway [8,9] and heat shock cognate 71 kDA protein (Hsc70) [8]. Therefore, the objectives of the current review are to summarize the pathogenesis of pancreatitis to find possible therapeutic targets for pancreatitis and to explore the corresponding mechanisms of H2 in the treatment of pancreatitis. Interpreting the role of H2 in the treatment of pancreatitis will have outstanding implications for its clinical application."
1,Classification of pancreatitis,"According to the course of the disease, pancreatitis can be divided into two categories: acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). The incidence and mortality of AP remain high worldwide, despite improvements in nursing, imaging, and interventional techniques [10]. According to the pathological types, AP can be classified into interstitial edema pancreatitis characterized by inflammatory edema and diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and necrotizing pancreatitis characterized by necrosis of the parenchyma and surrounding tissues of the pancreas; AP can also be segmented into mild, moderately severe, and severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) depending on the presence or absence of local or systemic complications and organ failure (Table 1 ) [11]. SAP is often associated with very high morbidity and mortality, and the development of infection and necrosis is the primary factor associated with high mortality [11]. CP pathology is characterized by progressive fibrosis of pancreatic tissue destruction caused by sustained inflammation [4], and endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas would be progressively lost as the fibrotic tissue gradually replaced the normal pancreas tissue [12]. Chronic pancreatitis is usually categorized according to known etiologies, including toxic-metabolic, idiopathic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent and severe acute pancreatitis, and obstructive pancreatitis [12–14] (Table 2 ). Among them, toxic-metabolic (mainly smoking and alcohol abuse) and genetic factors are considered to be the primary causal agents of the onset of CP [13]; the occurrence of CP is usually the outcome of the coexistence of one or more etiologies [14]. Local complications: acute peripancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections (pancreatic/peripancreatic) or walled-off necrosis. Systemic complications: aggravation of pre-existing complications caused by AP, such as coronary artery disease and chronic pulmonary disease. Organ failure: respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal systems, scored at least two points classified by the modified Marshal scoring system. Meanwhile, pancreatitis can also be classified as pancreatitis caused by complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and traumatic pancreatitis (TP). Among them, pancreatic injury caused by external forces has become a significant cause of AP with the occurrence of violent abdominal impingement in an increasing number of traffic accidents [5]."
2,Inflammation in pancreatitis,"Several factors cause the initial damage to pancreatic acinar cells and subsequently trigger a series of inflammatory signaling pathways (Fig. 1 ). First, necrotic cells activate inflammatory and immune responses by releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and other related molecules [15,16]. DAMPs can bind to membrane binding receptors and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors expressed in immune cells, activating signaling pathways and aseptic inflammation [15]. High mobility group box (HMGB) 1, as one of the DAMPs, plays a dual role in the pathogenesis of SAP and AP: extracellular HMGB1 aggravates the inflammatory response, while intracellular HMGB1 inhibits it [17,18]. Activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway is the primary downstream mechanism of the HMGB1-mediated inflammatory response [17,18], and inflammatory nucleosome release and activation of MAPK phosphorylation are also involved [18]. Activated NF-κB upregulates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1. In the inflammatory site, ICAM1 is produced in large quantities, which mediates the adhesion process of neutrophils. Activated neutrophil cells release nuclear DNA and histones, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs were abundant in the pancreatic tissue of experimental AP [19,20], and NET components were significantly increased in the plasma of SAP patients [20]. NETs activate signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 in acinar cells and then participate in the inflammatory response [20]. In contrast, NET deficiency decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 [19]. Furthermore, IL-6 can bind to soluble IL-6 receptors to form a complex or bind to IL-6 membrane binding receptors to activate the IL-6 signal transducer, thereby enabling the Janus kinase (JAK) 2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was found in experimental pancreatitis induced by cerulein, and astaxanthin and JAK2 inhibitors reduce pancreatic damage by inhibiting their activation [21]. In addition to neutrophils, dendritic cells and mononuclear macrophages are also involved in the development of pancreatitis. Dendritic cells can induce CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3+ Tregs, and Treg inhibition can lead to uncontrolled inflammation. Experimental CP [4] and spontaneous pancreatitis [22] showed a decrease in Tregs in the spleen, and increasing the proportion of Tregs in the spleen induced by hyperglycemia may alleviate spontaneous pancreatitis [22]. Meanwhile, mononuclear cells can be differentiated into two polarization types in experimental pancreatitis: M1 type (classically activated macrophages, CAMs) and M2 type (alternatively activated macrophages, AAMs). AAMs are dominant in experimental and human CP, and IL4 and IL13 derived from stellate cells can increase AAMs, thereby increasing fibrosis [23]. Overall, a variety of inflammatory signaling pathways and immune cells are involved in the occurrence and development of pancreatitis, which may represent a breakthrough in the treatment of pancreatitis."
3,Molecular hydrogen,"As a novel antioxidant, H2 has unique advantages over other antioxidants. i Because it is the smallest molecule in nature, H2 can spread easily and permeate cell membranes to act on organelles, including mitochondria and the nucleus [6,24,25]. ii H2 selectively removes harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite, while maintaining normal metabolism, redox reactions and other low-intensity ROS levels [6,26]. iii The end product of the reaction of H2 and ROS is water, which is nontoxic [6]. Moreover, there is no risk of explosion in the air or pure oxygen when the concentration is less than 4%. The primary sources of H2 are inhalation, drinking water, injection of hydrogen rich saline/water (HRS/W), skin diffusion and endogenous production by Escherichia coli [4,6,26–28]. H2 inhalation is the most straightforward treatment, while dissolving H2 is a safer and more portable method. There are three main ways to liquefy H2: electrolysis of H2 in pure water, pressure to dissolve H2 in saline/water, and the use of H2 release agents (for example, magnesium, Mg, Mg + H2O → H2) [27]. H2 has antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, anti-shock, and autophagy regulation effects on various diseases, such as sepsis organ injury, ischemia-reperfusion organ injury and vascular dementia [28–32], by directly reacting with hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrites and regulating specific gene expression or signaling pathways [29]."
4,Autophagy is impaired and ERS is activated in pancreatitis,"Autophagy is the process of forming a double-membraned autophagosome in a cell, encapsulating damaged mitochondria, peroxisomes, protein aggregates, and cytoplasmic masses that cannot be effectively processed by other degradation methods, and fusing with lysosomes to form autophagosomes to degrade the contents [33]. Autophagy plays a vital role in intracellular material circulation and energy metabolism and is an essential mechanism of cell self-renewal and regulation under various pathophysiological conditions. Autophagy can be divided into three categories: chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), microautophagy, and macroautophagy (commonly known as “autophagy”). Autophagy is a dynamic process. To facilitate its study, autophagy is artificially split into several steps, such as nucleation, the formation of autophagosomes, the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, and the degradation of contents of autolysosomes (Fig. 2 ). At present, through the study of the yeast autophagy mechanism, a network of autophagy molecular regulatory mechanisms composed of 35 autophagy-related genes (ATGs) has been constructed [34]. Among them, light chain (LC) 3 (mammalian homolog of yeast ATG8) plays an important role in the process of vesicle extension and closure to form autophagosomes. During this process, cytoplasmic LC3-I is lipidized to LC3-II and then located on the inner and outer surface of the autophagosome membrane. Therefore, LC3-II is often used to monitor the formation of autophagosomes [35]. Lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) is involved in autophagosome and lysosome fusion [36] and protects the lysosomal membrane and cytoplasm from acid hydrolases. Upon induction of autophagy, LC3-II binds to the adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1, which targets ubiquitination protein aggregates [37]. p62 is specifically degraded by autophagy and remains low under normal conditions [38]. Impaired autophagic flux is characteristic of early AP. Excessive vacuole accumulation and coexistence with p62 and LC3-II were found in experimental pancreatitis [39–41], suggesting that the dysfunction of autophagosome and lysosome fusion or degradation of autophagosome contents may lead to impaired autophagic flux. Recent studies have demonstrated that LAMP1 and/or LAMP2 are reduced in animal models of alcoholic and nonalcoholic pancreatitis and human pancreatitis [25,42]. LAMP may be degraded by the accumulation of immature intermediate forms of cathepsin (Cat) B, leading to its cleavage near the boundary of the lumen and transmembrane regions; furthermore, drug inhibition or gene knockout of CatB may reduce the symptoms of pancreatitis [42]. Meanwhile, LAMP2 knockout was found to cause autophagy damage, vacuolization of acinar cells, and progression to pancreatic injury similar to that of pancreatitis eventually [42]. Exendin-4 (a hypoglycemic drug) can cause apoptosis of AR42J cells (pancreatic exocrine cells) by downregulating LAMP2 to impair autophagy, and overexpression of LAMP2 can antagonize the cytotoxicity of exendin-4 [43]. However, exendin-4 did not alter CatB activity [43]. miR-352 can also downregulate LAMP2 expression at the gene level and damage autophagy [44]. (Fig. 2). Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a major transcription regulator related to lysosomes in autophagy and promotes the expression of many lysosome-associated proteins, including LAMP [45]. Recent studies have demonstrated that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/TFEB pathway is activated in experimental pancreatitis, and the expression of TFEB in the nucleus is decreased, resulting in impaired autophagic flux; moreover, acinar cell TFEB and TFE3 specific knockout can induce spontaneous pancreatitis by damaging autophagic flux [41]. Consistent with this, TFEB levels in the nuclei of human pancreatitis tissues also diminished [41]. (Fig. 2). Inhibition of miR-155 can reduce the accumulation of vacuoles and improve damaged autophagic flux and the prognosis of experimental pancreatitis [40]. Accordingly, LAMP2 downregulation leading to impaired autophagic flux may be one of the pivotal mechanisms of various types of pancreatitis, and its downregulation may be related to intermediate CatB abnormal accumulation and mTOR/TFEB pathway activation. The upregulation of LAMP2 may improve pancreatic injury. The correction of impaired autophagy flux may be a future research direction for the treatment of pancreatitis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle of eukaryotic cells that exists in the cytoplasm. It is a three-dimensional network structure and has the functions of protein synthesis, modification and processing [46]. A large number of unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER cavity, causing ERS when ER protein processing and transport are disrupted by toxin stimulation, continuous oxidative stress and other external damage factors [47]. When ERS is triggered, the stress signal is transmitted to the nucleus through the ER membrane, which in turn causes a series of signaling pathway molecules to act in maintaining intracellular homeostasis, known as the unfolded protein reaction (UPR) [48]. The UPR regulates ERS by three ER transmembrane proteins, including protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [46–48]. Glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78)/BIP (heavy-chain binding protein), a kind of molecular chaperone protein localized in the ER membrane, binds to the above three proteins under normal conditions; when ERS occurs, the three proteins dissociate from it, and UPR is initiated [46]. The three dissociated proteins improve ER unfolded or misfolded protein accumulation in different ways [46–48]: PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic transcription initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which slows protein synthesis and reduces the pressure for ER to fold new synthetic proteins [46,49]; IRE1 promotes the production of activated X-box binding protein 1 splicing (XBP1s), which can accelerate protein folding and incorrect protein degradation [46,50]; ATF6 is translocated from the ER to the Golgi body to generate activated ATF6, which is inserted into the nucleus as a transcription factor to induce transcription of BIP, XBP1 and other ERS reactive elements. The UPR is a self-protective mechanism of cells. However, when ERS persists, it initiates apoptosis pathways through CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase 12. In addition, the damaged ER can be engulfed and degraded by the autophagy pathway, and the degraded ER fragments can form new ER to restore cell homeostasis. The main physiological function of pancreatic acinar cells is to synthesize digestive enzymes, so acinar cells are one of the most abundant enzymes in the ER. At the early stage of AP, morphological and structural changes of the ER of acinar cells were observed, including local or extensive swelling and expansion and cavitation formation, suggesting that ERS may already exist in AP [51]. Studies have revealed that ERS exists in various APs, manifested by increased expression of caspase 12 [51], CHOP [51,52], GRP78/BIP, IRE1 [52,53], and decreased expression of XBP1s [52]. SAP can be improved by inhibiting ERS and thereby inhibiting ERS-induced apoptosis and NF-κB inflammatory pathways [51]. XBP1s partial deletion can aggravate alcohol-induced acinar cell damage [50]. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), a short-chain aromatic fatty acid with a molecular chaperone effect, can inhibit ERS. In SAP, 4-PBA can improve ERS by reducing the expression of GRP78, PERK, and ATF-6 protein and ameliorate ERS-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells by decreasing caspase 12 [54]. 4-PBA can also inhibit the activation of the IRE1/XBP1s signaling pathway. In addition, XBP1s was found to induce autophagy of endothelial cells by activating Beclin1 (mammalian homolog of yeast ATG6) [55]. 4-PBA also inhibits autophagy by inhibiting ERS mediated by the IRE1 pathway, and autophagy inhibitors can increase the expression of BIP mRNA and CHOP protein [56], suggesting that ERS can trigger autophagy, and autophagy in turn improves excessive ERS. Autophagy deletion can lead to ERS, which is also proven in studies of pancreatitis [57]. Similarly, impaired autophagy and ERS were found in arginine-induced AP; the use of trehalose to enhance autophagy improved pancreatic injury, as well as ERS [52]. Collectively, impaired autophagy flow and excessive ERS are both pivotal pathogenesis mechanisms of pancreatitis. In pancreatitis, ERS can induce autophagy, which in turn improves excessive ERS. Further exploration of the molecular pathways between the two in pancreatitis and how to improve them will be future research directions."
5,The therapeutic effect of H2 on pancreatitis,"The pancreatitis animal model is a necessary instrument to examine the mechanisms of H2 in treating pancreatitis. Currently, animal models of AP and CP are induced mainly by the following methods: retrograde injection of taurocholic acid into the bile duct, L-arginine, caerulein, choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented diet (CDE) [58] and alcoholic diet. Compressed air shock to expose the pancreas is used to induce TP in animal models. Serum amylase concentration, the general morphology of the pancreas, the modified Schmidt score for pancreatic histopathology and the wet/dry ratio of the pancreas are commonly used to judge animal model construction for pancreatitis, among which the detection of pancreatic histopathology is the most critical evaluation index."
6,H2 improves pancreatic tissue damage,"6.1 H2 improves pancreatic tissue damage H2 can significantly improve the sluggish activity and grooming activity of pancreatic rats, reduce pancreatic water content, and improve the survival rate [4,5]. AR42J cells have been widely used as an in vitro model of pancreatic exocrine cells due to their similar receptor expression and signal transduction mechanisms to normal pancreatic acinar cells [6,8]. Studies have shown that H2 can reverse the increase in amylase in AR42J cells and rat models of pancreatitis [4,6,7]. In contrast, other studies have confirmed that H2 cannot change amylase in rat models of pancreatitis [5,9,59,60]. It is speculated that the occurrence of this contradiction may be linked to the severity of pancreatitis and the drug delivery mode and concentration of H2. Additionally, H2 can consistently improve the histopathological damage of AP, relieve pancreatic edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, bleeding and necrosis [5–7,9,59,60], and improve the pancreatic fibrosis of CP [4]."
7,"Antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of H2","6.2 Antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of H2 Oxidative damage and ROS play essential roles in the development of many diseases, so the term “oxidative stress” is frequently used [61]. Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of oxidants, resulting in disruption of redox signals and/or molecular damage [62]. It is also indispensable in the occurrence and development of AP and CP [6]. Mitochondria are where ROS are produced, and H2 can be dispersed into mitochondria to selectively remove harmful ROS [9]. ROS mainly include superoxide anion (·O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (·OH), nitric oxide (·NO) and peroxynitrite anion (·ONOO-) [29]. Oxygen (O2) gains an electron via DADPH oxidase and is reduced to ·O2-, which can be further reduced by superoxide dismutase (SOD) to form H2O2 or ·OH; H2O2 can be converted to water by glutathione (GSH) [63]. Thus, GSH and SOD remove harmful ROS and reflect the antioxidant level of the organism [64]. L-arginine, which is used to induce pancreatitis, produces ·NO in the presence of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which then reacts with ·O2- to form ·ONOO- [63]. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an important peroxidation product of membrane lipids that can reflect the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation. In all types of pancreatitis, MDA increased, GSH and SOD decreased, and H2 reversed the above changes [4,6,9,59,60], suggesting that H2 could reduce ROS by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in pancreatitis. H2 can also reduce 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), a marker of oxidative damage to DNA [6]. In addition, H2 plays an antioxidant stress role by directly neutralizing ·OH, reducing the expression of the · ONOO- gene, and inhibiting NOS and NADPH oxidase activity [29], but these mechanisms need to be further verified in pancreatitis. Thus, antioxidative stress is one of the underlying mechanisms of H2 to treat pancreatitis injury. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a specific marker of myeloid cells (mainly monocytes and neutrophils). MPO activity is often used to evaluate the accumulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in inflammatory tissues, and MPO activity is significantly correlated with the number of PMNs detected histologically [6]. H2 can reverse the increase in MPO in pancreatitis [4,6,59,60], suggesting that H2 can improve the infiltration of pancreatic neutrophils. Furthermore, H2 can also improve the apoptosis of acinar cells in pancreatitis [4,7,9]. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a cell cycle regulatory nuclear protein of a crucial DNA polymerase. PCNA is a sound index of cell proliferation status. The late G1 and early S phase of the cell cycle, as well as DNA repair cells, can be distinguished by the PCNA that marks the nucleus [7]. H2 can significantly increase the expression of PCNA in acinar cells of pancreatitis [7], indicating that H2 can also promote the proliferation and regeneration of acinar cells. In summary, H2 plays an antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis role in pancreatitis. Oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis signal regulatory pathways interact with each other to conduct a complex regulatory network in pancreatitis. H2 can regulate the nodes of the signaling network referenced below. 6.2.1 H2 inhibits NF-κB signaling pathway The NF-κB signaling pathway is a classical inflammatory signaling pathway. NF-κB is usually present in the form of dimers that bind to I-κB protein or DNA. I-κB protein is an inhibitor of NF-κB. When cells are subjected to various extracellular stimuli, I-κB kinases are activated. Activated I-κB kinases mediate the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the I-κB protein and therefore degradation. Subsequently, the NF-κB dimer is activated, and NF-κB p65 is released into the nucleus to mediate TNF-α, IL-6, and other proinflammatory factor transcription and expression. In pancreatitis, the components of NF-κB signaling pathways, including I-κB protein phosphorylation, NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, and the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, can be inhibited by H2 [6–9,59,60] (Fig. 3 ). Active NF-κB induce increased ICAM1 expression as known from the inflammatory mechanism of pancreatitis above; NF-κB activation is also associated with upregulated expression of adhesion molecules in acinar cells, both leading to a significant increase in adhesion and migration of neutrophils. These conditions induce a positive NF-κB feedback response leading to increased NF-κB activation thus causing the inflammatory cascade response [65,66]. The NF-κB signaling pathway has therefore been recognized as the central mechanism for the progression of pancreatitis. Inhibition of NF-κB activation significantly reduces the severity of pancreatitis [67]. HMGB1, one of the inducing molecules of the NF-κB signaling pathway, is also inhibited by H2 in pancreatitis [59]. Meanwhile, H2 can upregulate the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 [6,59]. These findings suggest that H2 breaks the inflammatory vicious cycle centered on the activated NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating that H2 has the ability to inhibit the central mechanisms underlying the progression of pancreatitis. 6.2.2 H2 inhibits MAPK signaling pathway The MAPK signaling pathway also plays a complex role in regulating the inflammatory response and apoptosis [64]. The traditional MAPK signaling pathway includes three family members: c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38-MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The JNK and p38-MAPK signaling pathways can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines such as ROS and TNF-α [68,69]. The activated p38-MAPK signaling pathway, in turn, enables the NF-κB signaling pathway to promote the production of inflammatory cytokines and worsen the disease [70]. Therefore, breaking the above vicious cycle is the key to reducing the inflammatory response and improving cell apoptosis. H2 can significantly reduce the level of pancreatic ROS [59], inhibit the phosphorylation of JNK, p38-MAPK [8,9] and ERK [8], and prevent the translocation of p-JNK, p-p38 MAPK and p-ERK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [8], thereby reducing the expression of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, improving the apoptosis of acinar cells and reducing the inflammatory response [9]. (Fig. 3). 6.2.3 H2 reduces NLRP3 inflammasome expression The NLRP3 inflammasome, one of the most characteristic inflammasomes of NOD-like receptor family, is an intracellular multiprotein complex composed of NLRP3 protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and active caspase-1. It can be activated by ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction and other danger signal molecules [71] to promote maturation and secretion of IL-1β by providing a platform [72,73]. NF-κB also promotes the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [74]. In pancreatitis, the expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes is increased, and drugs inhibition of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome reduce the severity of pancreatitis; the upstream mechanisms were to inhibit NADPH oxidase [67] and to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 [75]. Furthermore, ROS can promote the activation of NLRP3 infammasome by activating TXNIP, a key regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome [60]. Interestingly, in addition to reducing ROS production at the source, H2 significantly reduced both TXNIP and NLRP3 expression in pancreatitis [60]. (Fig. 3). Therefore, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is one of the inflammatory mechanisms in pancreatitis. H2 can combat pancreatitis by reducing its expression, but the specific mechanism needs to be further explored."
8,H2 restores the loss of Tregs,"6.3 H2 restores the loss of Tregs Tregs are important immune cells for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases. Tregs regulate the immune response through an assortment of mechanisms [76], among which promoting the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is the key to inhibiting the excessive activation of cytotoxic T cells in a dose-dependent manner [77]. It has been demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in CD25 + Foxp3+ Tregs in both peripheral monocytes and splenic monocytes of CP, which can be reversed by H2 [4]. Moreover, H2 also improved the related indexes of CP, including reducing the size, weight and water content of the pancreas, improving the histopathological score, apoptosis of acinar cells and infiltration of neutrophils, and decreasing the secretion of amylase and lipase and pancreatic fibrosis [4]. At the same time, transfection of purified Tregs into mice with CP produced an improvement similar to that of H2, while simultaneously reducing oxidative stress and TNF-α and increasing IL-10; however, this improvement was significantly reduced in Treg-deficient mice with CP [4]. (Fig. 4 ). Thus, H2 restoring Treg levels to regulate immunity and inflammation may be one of the critical mechanisms in the treatment of CP."
9,H2 further upregulates Hsc70,"6.4 H2 further upregulates Hsc70 Hsc70 is a cytoplasmic chaperone protein that plays an important role in stabilizing the folding of newly synthesized peptides under nonstress conditions. Hsc70 maintains the normal structure and physiological functions of the polypeptide and regulates the translocation of proteins to organelles such as ER, mitochondria and lysosomes. In fact, Hsc70 is crucial for the protection of innate immune regulation and endogenous stimuli. In mouse macrophages research administrated with LPS, Hsc70 could attenuate NO production, mitigate TNF-α and IL-6 expression, diminish NF-κB nuclear translocation, and reduce the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK, and phosphodylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) [78]. It has been proved that the upregulation of Hsc70 can protect against pancreatitis [79]. The study found that Hsc70 in AR42J cells induced by caerulein was increased, and H2 further upregulated its expression [8]. Knockdown of Hsc70 by Hsc70-specific siRNA transfection increased the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and upregulated the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β [8]. Activation of NF-κB p65, however, can reduce Hsc70 expression in AR42J cells [80]. In addition, Hsc70 can also reduce the expression of caspase-1, which mediates the maturation of IL-1β [81]. Thus, upregulation of Hsc70 is one of the mechanisms of H2 against pancreatitis, but the specific upstream and the downstream pathway closed-loops such as MAPKs, PI3K, and NF-κB signaling pathways need to be further verified. Hsc70 is also engaged in CMA. CMA is a selective degradation system that is mainly involved in the removal of damaged or abnormal proteins and hence is considered to be a significant regulatory process for intracellular environmental stability. Hsc70 binds to the substrate and other molecular chaperones to form a complex for cotransport to the lysosomal membrane, where it interacts with LAMP2A to form a multiprotein complex that allows the target substrate to enter the lysosomal cavity for degradation [82]. Even so, whether further upregulation of Hsc70 by H2 to improve pancreatitis is related to Hsc70-mediated CMA remains to be further examined. Collectively, H2 can treat all types of pancreatitis by antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, and anti-acinar cell apoptosis processes, recovery of Treg loss and upregulation of Hsc70. Meanwhile, SAP and acute necrotizing pancreatitis often cause SIRS and MODS, and H2 also has a significant protective effect on pancreatitis-related liver injury [9], kidney injury [59] and lung injury, which is of outstanding significance in reducing the mortality of pancreatitis."
10,Other possible mechanisms by which H2 improves pancreatitis,"6.5 Other possible mechanisms by which H2 improves pancreatitis Regulation of the autophagy process has intersections with many signaling pathways, such as inflammation [45,83] and apoptosis [45]. Therefore, the regulation of autophagy is crucial for the treatment of many diseases. Studies have found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pancreatic injury was similar to alcoholic pancreatitis because both had impaired autophagic flux [84]. Intriguingly, by regulating autophagy, H2 can also have a significant effect on sepsis [85], hypoxic organ injury [31] and neuropathic pain [86]. H2 can downregulate the mTOR, STAT3, and ERK signaling pathways, thereby activating autophagy to improve hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [87]. H2 can improve acute kidney injury by reducing the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway [88]. By inhibiting the mTOR/TFEB signaling pathway, H2 can also improve the impaired autophagic flux induced by LPS in acute lung injury [45]. Thus, whether H2 has positive effects on pancreatitis by regulating autophagy via these signaling pathways remains to be further studied. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to impaired autophagic flux [52]. Recent studies have proposed that the interaction among acinar cell dysfunctional organelles, including impaired mitochondria, excessive ERS and damaged autophagic flux, might be the primary pathogenesis of pancreatitis and suggest the consideration of correcting organelle functions [58]. Impaired mitochondria were found in different experimental pancreatitis models, and the mechanism was mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation mediated by mitochondrial retention protein cyclophilin D (CypD); the pathological injury of the pancreas in mice lacking CypD was alleviated [52]. CypD controls the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which abnormally reduces F-ATP synthase activity. Recent studies have shown that H2 can inhibit the abnormal opening of the mPTP in spinal cord neuron injury in mice, thus improving mitochondrial structure damage [89]. Mitochondria are the places where ATP is produced. H2 can reverse the LPS-induced decrease in myocardial ATP by increasing fatty acid oxidation [90]. H2 can improve ERS caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced renal insufficiency by reducing the expression of CHOP, caspase-12, and GRP78 [31]. Likewise, H2 can improve ERS in intermittent hypoxia-induced cardiac disturbance through the PERK/eIF2/ATF4, IRE1/XBP1s and ATF6 signaling pathways [91]. Accordingly, H2 has broad application prospects in the treatment of pancreatitis. Whether the above signaling pathways are related to inflammation, autophagy and ERS and the mechanisms of damaged mitochondria are the potential targets of H2 therapy for pancreatitis may be future research directions."
11,Methods and dosage of H2 in the treatment of pancreatitis,"In the treatment of pancreatitis with H2, the main methods of administration in animal models are inhalation of 2% H2 and intraperitoneal or tail vein injection of HRS. Continuous inhalation ensures that H2 is maintained at a high level of affectability, whereas intraperitoneal or caudal injection is more convenient [6]. AR42J cells were mainly cultured with HRW or 2% H2. The specific summary is shown in Table 3 . Studies have shown that the peak time of H2 concentration in blood and tissues is different with different administration methods. Oral HRW and intraperitoneal injection of HRS peaked after 5 min, intravenous injection of HRS peaked after 1 min, and inhalation of H2 peaked after 30 min; intraperitoneal injection showed the highest peak concentration among the four administration methods [92]. Furthermore, H2 concentrations in the pancreas and spleen were significantly higher than those in the blood and heart, liver, kidneys, brain and muscles when given in the same way [92]. With inhalation administration, H2 concentrations in target organs can be maintained for more than an hour; however, with oral, intraperitoneal, and intravenous administration, H2 concentrations in target organs drop to less than half of their peak levels within 15 min [92]. Therefore, the stability of the H2 concentration of target sites is also one of the research directions for H2 application in disease treatment. Fortunately, recent research has sufficiently improved by preparing pdhydride for sustained release of H2 in the target area after a single local injection for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [93]."
12,Conclusion,"Taken together, inflammatory responses involving multiple signaling pathways and immune cells, impaired autophagic flux, ERS and impaired mitochondria are involved in the occurrence and development of pancreatitis. H2 is of great significance for the treatment of pancreatitis due to its unique physicochemical properties. H2 improves pancreatitis by antioxidative stress, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis activities and the regulation of immunity and Hsc70. In addition, H2 can further activate autophagy to inactivate the NLRP3 inflammasome [30], thereby improving mitochondrial and organ damage. Hsc70 also plays a pivotal role in CMA. However, these findings are only preclinical (experimental models). H2 will be a promising therapy for pancreatitis if it can be tested in human pancreatitis. Its mechanisms of action in regulating the inflammatory signaling pathways in pancreatitis need to be further improved. Its role in immunity, repair of damaged mitochondria, excessive ERS and regulation of autophagy will be the focus of future research in pancreatitis."
