0,Introduction,"The present work is a continuation of systematic studies on thermo-physical and spectroscopic properties of binary liquid mixtures of alkoxy alkanols and alcohols [1–10]. The increasing use of binary liquid mixture of alkoxy alkanols and alcohols in many industrial process such as pharmaceutical and cosmetics has greatly enthused the need for extensive information on these properties [11–13]. These properties provide paramount information about the bulk properties and intermolecular properties [14–17]. Binary mixtures of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol and alcohols can serve as materials with enhanced properties than that of individual components and can be used in various biotechnical and biomedical applications, constituting a simple model of biological systems and as automotive brake fluid. In an effort to make a comprehensive study, we measure the density ρ and speed of sound u for the binary liquid mixtures containing 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol with alcohols at temperatures of (293.15, 298.15, 303.15, 308.15 and 313.15) K over the entire composition range. The evaluated properties from experimental data have been construed in terms of the difference in the size of the molecule as well as the strength of specific and non-specific interactions between components of the mixture. They provide important information about molecular packing, molecular motion, various types of intermolecular interactions and their strength influenced by the size, shape and the chemical nature of component molecules [18]. The excess functions and their deviations have also been correlated using Redlich-Kister type polynomial equation by the method of least-squares for the estimation of the binary coefficients and the standard deviations. The FT-IR and NMR techniques have been used to scrutinize the –OH interactions between the binary mixtures and inestimable to spot the influence on the structural variation in the alcohols."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials 2-(2-Butoxyethoxy) ethanol was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, USA. All alcohols i.e. 1-propanol (Analytical reagent grade), 2-propanol (Extra pure grade), 1-butanol (HPLC and spectroscopic grade) and 2-butanol (Analytical reagent grade) were procured from SD Fine Chemicals, India. All the chemicals were fractionally distilled and dried over 0.4 nm molecular sieves. The provenance and mass fraction purities tested by gas chromatography (GC–MS agilent, 5975C-7890A) and water content determined by coulometric Karl Fisher method are reported in Table 1 . The apparatus was comprised of an electrolytic cell for iodine production and a potentiometric titration system. The anode was immersed in the anolyte solution and the cathode was immersed in the catholyte solution. The titration apparatus was protected from atmospheric moisture with the help of silica gel. The purities of solvents were further ascertained by comparing their densities and speeds of sound at 298.15 K with values reported in the literature [19–27] as shown in Table 2 ."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods Each binary mixture were prepared by weighing appropriate amounts of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol and each alcohol mentioned above on an A&D Company limited electronic balance (Japan, Model GR-202), with a precision of ±0.01 mg, by syringing each component into airtight narrow mouthed stoppered bottles to minimize evaporation losses. The pure components were separately degassed shortly before sample preparation. The accuracy of the mole fractions prepared was found to be ±5 × 10−4."
4,Density and speed of sound measurements,"2.3 Density and speed of sound measurements Densities ρ and speeds of sound u were measured by using a digital vibrating tube density and speed of sound analyser (Anton Paar DSA 5000). The details of calibration of the instrument and the experimental procedure have been described elsewhere [1–10]. The speed of sound is measured using a propagation time technique. The sound speed cell consists of a circularcavity 8 mm in diameter and 5 mm deep. The sample is sandwichedbetween two piezoelectric ultrasound transducers. Onetransducer emits sound waves through the sample- filled cavityat a frequency of approximately 3 MHz; the second transducer receivesthose waves. Thus, the speed of sound is obtained bydividing the known distance between transmitter and receiver bythe measured propagation time of the sound wave [28]. The repeatability of values of density and speed of sound was within a maximum range of ±0.5 × 10−3 kg m−3 and ±0.05 m s−1, respectively. Standard uncertainties are u (T) = ±1 × 10−2 K, u (P) = ±2 kPa, u (x) = 5 × 10−4 and a combined expandeduncertainty (level of confidence = 0.95, k = 2) U (ρ) = 0.4 kg·m−3, U (u) = ±7 m·s−1. The reliability of experimental measurements of ρ and u were ascertained bycomparing the experimental data of pure liquids with the corresponding literature values(Table 2)."
5,Spectral analysis,"2.4 Spectral analysis FT-IR measurements of binary liquid mixtures of 2-(2-Butoxyethoxy) ethanol with alcohols at different mole fractions were recorded using ABB Horizon (MB 3000) spectrometer, which have resolution better than 4 cm−1 and maximum signal-to-noise ratio (root-mean-square, 60 s, 4 cm−1, at peak response); 50,000: 1. The NMR chemical shifts of pure components and their molar equimolar mixture for 1H were observed with a Bruker FT-NMR spectrometer operating at 300 MHz. In order to determine chemical shift δ for pure components and their molar equimolar mixture, CDCl3 was used as an external solvent for all the NMR measurements. Details of measuring procedure have been given in our earlier publication [1–10]. All the data analysis were performed in Microsoft Excel and Origin 6.1 software."
6,Results and discussion,"Following are the equations adopted for calculating the properties from the measured properties. The experimental values of density are used to calculate the excess molar volumes, V m E of the mixtures as: (1) V m E = ∑ i = 1 2 x i M i ( ρ - 1 - ρ i - 1 ) where ρ is the density of the mixture and x i , Mi and ρ i are the mole fraction, molar mass and density of pure component i, respectively. The molar isentropic compressibility, K S , m has been calculated from the relation: (2) K s , m = - ( ∂ V / ∂ P ) s = V . κ s = ∑ x i M i / ( ρ u ) 2 where V is the molar volume, Δ the molar mass of the mixture and κ s = 1 / ( ρ u 2 ) is the isentropic compressibility. The excess molar isentropic compressibility was calculated as: (3) K S , m E = K S , m - K S , m id where K S , m id is defined by Kiyohara and Benson [29–34]: (4) K s , m id = ∑ x i K s , i ∗ + T A P , i ∗ ∑ x i A P , i ∗ / ∑ x i C P , i ∗ - A P , i ∗ / C P , i ∗ where A P , i ∗ ( = V m , i ∗ × α P , i ∗ ) is the product of the molar volume V m , i ∗ and the isobaric expansivity α P , i ∗ , C P , i ∗ is the isobaric molar heat capacity [35,36], K S , i ∗ is the product of the molar volume V m , i ∗ and the isentropic compressibility κ S , i ∗ of the pure liquid component i and T is the temperature. The deviations in speed of sound from their values in an ideal mixture are calculated from equation: (5) u D = u - u id where u id was calculated using the equation: (6) u id = ( V m id ) 1 / 2 ( K S , m id ∑ i ϕ i ρ i ) - 1 / 2 where φ i is the volume fraction of i th component. The composition dependence of V m E , K S , m E and u D for each mixture were correlated by the Redlich-Kister polynomial equation [37]: (7) Y ( x ) = x 1 x 2 ∑ i = 0 p A i ( x 1 - x 2 ) i where Y(x) represents the excess or deviation property, p is number of estimated parameters and A i ’s are polynomial coefficients obtained by fitting Eq. (7) to the experimental results using a least-squares regression method with all points weighted equally. The standard deviation σ was calculated using the relation: (8) σ = ∑ i = 1 n Y ( x ) exp tl - Y ( x ) cal 2 / n - ( p + 1 ) 1 / 2 where Y ( x ) exptl , Y ( x ) cal are the values of the experimental and calculated property ( V m E , K S , m E and u D respectively and n is the number of experimental data points. The percentage standard deviation has been calculated by using the relation: (9) σ % = ∑ 100 exptl . - theo . /exptl . 2 / n - 1 1 / 2 where exptl. and theo. stand for experimental and theoretical values and n represents the number of experimental data points. The variation of ρ , u , V m E and K S , m E at all temperatures of interest for the studied binaries are given in Tables 3 and 4 . The Redlich-Kister polynomial equation was applied successfully for the correlation of these excess properties ( V m E , K S , m E and u D ). The calculated values of the coefficients A i along with the standard deviations are given in Table 5 . It is observed that, in all the system all experimental values increased non-linearly with mole fraction. This non-linear variation is a deviation from ideal behaviour which suggests the presence of intermolecular interactions between the component molecules of the mixtures, however the strength of interaction is well reflected in the excess parameters and these parameters are found to be more sensitive towards intermolecular interactions in the liquid mixtures. According to Fort and Moore [38,39] negative excess volume is an insinuation of strong heteromolecular interactions in the liquid mixtures and attributed to charge-transfer, dipole-dipole and hydrogen bonding between the unlike components, while a positive sign designate a weak interactions and is ascribed to dispersive forces (London forces), which are likely to be operative in each case. The magnitudes of the contributions made by the different types of interactions will vary with the composition of the mixtures. In the present investigation, all the four mixtures exhibit negative magnitude of V m E , presented in Fig.1 . Moreover, the former effect results in contraction in volume and later contributes to expansion in volume [40]. The magnitudes of V m E suggest that the former effect is dominant in all the binary mixtures. It shows the presence of heteromolecular interaction in all the binary liquid mixture, which supports the Fort and Moore observations. On comparing with literature, the trend of excess molar volume of binary mixture of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol with 1-propanol are negative for Pal et al. [41] study and for binary mixture of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol with 1-butanol are negative in the study of Cobos et al., Mozo et al. [42,43], which is similar with present paper but there is difference in magnitude as shown in Figs. S1 and S2, respectively in Supplementary information. This may be due to the different experimental techniques having been adopted for the measurement of V m E . The trend can be described by considering the steric hindrance effects of the alkyl chain, because the hydrophobic character of the alcohols is amplified by an increase in chain length and consequently, the molecular interactions between alkoxy alkanol and alcohol molecules weaken. The magnitude of V m E value follows the sequence: 1-propanol < 2-propanol < 1-butanol < 2-butanol Similar trend is also observed in case of K S , m E . Further, it is also observed that the values of V m E decreases with rise in temperatures. The effect of temperature on excess molar volume for all the mixtures shows a systematic volume expansion due to increase in temperature which can be explained by the increase of thermal energy, which contributes to weaken like interactions. Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate the behaviour of K S , m E and u D of binary mixture of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol with alcohols are consistent with V m E . Due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, differences in size and shape of the component molecules of the mixture and fitting of the component molecules into each other’s structure thereby reducing the compressibility of the mixture, resulting in negative K S , m E and positive u D . More negative value of K S , m E and positive value of u D in case 1-propanol, due to proper fitting of one component molecules into the other. The magnitude of K S , m E decreases with increase in temperature and becomes more and more negative whereas u D values increase with increase in temperature and becomes more and more positive for all mixtures. On increasing the temperature, dissociation induces in the mixture releasing an increased number of free 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol and alcohols dipoles and also leads to an expansion in volume, which allows more favourable packing. This leads to contraction in volume, causing a decrease in compressibility of the mixture. To compare with literature, the deviation of speed of sound (Δu) for binary mixture of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol with 1-butanol are calculated using the relation (10) Δ u = u mixl - ( x 1 u 1 + x 2 u 2 ) The trend of Δu are positive at 293.15, 298.15 and 303.15 K, which is similar as in the study of Mozo et al. [43], but there is small difference in magnitude as shown in Fig. S3, in Supplementary information. This may be due to the different experimental techniques having been adopted for the measurement."
7,Spectral studies,"FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy are successful method to search the molecular structure of association effects among molecules. These techniques offer the advantages to measure the association properties and hydrogen bonding capability to assess interactions by analysing band shifts and shape [44]. In order to show the presence of intermolecular interactions, the systems were further investigated by FT-IR and NMR studies. In FT-IR, the H-bonding changes both the stretching and bending vibrations of a functional group. The sharp band around 3650 cm−1 is due to free –OH while the weak band observed at 3350 cm−1 is due to hydrogen-bonded –OH [45]. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding involves association of two or more molecules of same component or different component. The bands that result from intermolecular hydrogen bonding appear at lower energies. FT-IR data are given in Table 6 for all above mentioned pure components and their equimolar concentration clearly shows that all the binary mixtures have strong intermolecular interactions. The chemical shift of the –OH proton is variable and depends on the extent of association through H-bonding, generally, strong the association, the lower the field strength required to induce resonance. Because the electron density around the proton decreases with the influence of H-bonding causes shifts to lower δ values, but no such shift is observed in intramolecular H-bonding. Lower the δ value of –OH groups of binary mixtures given in Table 7 again fortified the strong interactions between mixtures containing 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol as one of the components [46]."
