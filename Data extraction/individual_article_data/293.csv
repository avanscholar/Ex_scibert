0,Introduction,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technology that has been widely used in the treatment of wastewater and waste (Kumar and Samadder, 2020). Anaerobic microorganisms effectively degrade high molecular weight organic materials into small molecular weight organic matter, ultimately producing a renewable source of energy. AD is a complicated and sensitive process, which involves different microbial communities to partake in the four metabolic steps of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis (Zhou et al., 2021). The advantages of AD include the ability to degrade complex pollutants with a decrease in the production of sludge and a lower consumption of energy, the presentation of a high organic loading rate and treatment efficiency, the production of biogas as an energy carrier and an enhancement in the control of odors (Zhang et al., 2021). Since the beginning of the twentieth century, AD has been utilized in various applications, including the treatment of sewage sludge, municipal waste, energy crops, solid waste and industrial wastewater and the conversion of manure and agricultural residues (Arhoun et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Kumar and Samadder, 2020; Mehariya et al., 2018). Although AD has been in use for many years, the process still faces various challenges, and there are increasing requirements for the improvement and stability of the AD process. Moreover, there are many factors that can affect the stability and efficiency of AD, such as operational strategies, different configurations of anaerobic reactors, substrates composition and the contents of nutrients and trace elements (Lu et al., 2019; Silva et al., 2021). Several strategies have been used to optimize the process performance of AD and solve the inhibitory problems of AD, including co-digestion, pre-treatment and the addition of promotors, of which the co-digestion is considered to be the most effective and energy-efficient (Hagos et al., 2017; Meier et al., 2020). The availability and biodegradability of feedstocks have some significant effects on the AD process. Co-digestion (the use of mixed feedstocks) is an inexpensive and effective strategy to optimize the process performance of AD (AcoD) and overcome the disadvantages of mono-digestion. Co-digestion can provide a series of benefits, such as the enhancement of system stability, the dilution of toxic substances or inhibitory compounds, and an improvement in the production of biogas and yield of methane, that offer a more appropriate carbon and nitrogen (C/N) ratio and maintain the balance of nutrients and synergetic effects of microorganisms (Zhang et al.,2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2020; Ryue et al., 2020; Tonanzi et al., 2020; Meier et al., 2020). Co-digestion has been explored in a variety of types of AD research. For example, solid feedstocks composed of different substrates can balance their contents of carbon and nitrogen to a more appropriate ratio and provide synergistic effects of microorganisms to more effectively improve the AD. Zhang et al. (2021) revealed that the co-digestion of 65% food waste and 35% cattle manure promoted less VFAs accumulation, reached the highest synergistic rate (22.3%), stimulated the methanogenic activities and enhanced the performance of AD. Hou et al. (2020) found that the co-digestion of rice straw, rice bran and food waste generated a positive synergistic effect by increasing the methane yield by 27.4%, decreasing the accumulation of propionic acid and improving the stability of operation (Hou et al., 2020). Owing to the additional supplement of trace elements from co-digestion of waste-activated sludge, the stable process with methane yields of up to 0.27 Nm3 ·kg-1VS fed for OLR of 1.7 gVS· L-1·d-1can also be achieved, thereby providing promising synergies for the food waste industry (Tonanzi et al., 2020). Moreover, the addition of chicken manure to banana pseudo-stems for co-digestion could balance the high C/N ratio of banana pseudo-stems, which promoted a stable AD performance at the increasing organic loading rate (OLR) with higher methane yields and more active AD microbial functional groups, regardless of whether batch fermentation or semi-continuous fermentation was used (Zhou et al., 2021). To solve inhibitory problems related to wastewater, mixing or co-digestion with various wastes have been applied. The addition of food waste (FW) into blackwater (BW) with different mixing ratios provided the highest OLR for the BW and the highest methane production efficiency reported in the literature for BW treatment (Gao et al., 2020). It was proven that the co-digestion of vegetable wastes and swine wastewater offered better buffering capacity, thus, alleviating the inhibition of methane production by VFAs and providing a stable reactor performance (de Silva Mazareli et al., 2016). The supplementation of corn stalks mitigated the inhibition of high concentrations of sulfate in wastewater, which led to the highest methane production of 260.14 mL·g−1 volatile solids (VS) and a maximum rate of sulfate removal of 93.43% (Yang et al., 2019). However, the AD co-digestion of different types of wastewater has rarely been reported. Molasses alcohol wastewater (MAW) and Cassava alcohol wastewater (CAW) are wastewaters that are produced by alcohol production plants. Approximately 13–15 L of wastewater is generated with the manufacture of 1 L of alcohol during the production of molasses and cassava alcohol. In Guangxi, China, molasses and cassava are the main raw materials used in alcohol production, which produces an enormous amount of wastewater. Many alcohol factories simultaneously produce molasses alcohol and cassava alcohol, and these two types of alcohol wastewater have high COD and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values. In addition to the extremely high BOD (50,000–270,000 mg·L-1) and COD (111,000–658,000 mg·L-1), the pH value is also low (typically 3–5.9) in the MAW (Silva et al., 2021). MAW pose a treatment challenge in view of high COD, high concentrations of sulfate (SO4 2-), high content of toxic substances, low pH, dark colors and unpleasant odors (de Barros et al., 2017; Basu et al.,2015). Moreover, MAW contains pigments and melanoidins that are not easily degraded, and cytotoxic can easily lead to rancidity (Arimi et al., 2014). It was reported that polyphenols in MAW can inhibit the activity of methanogenic archaea (Silva et al., 2021). AD is a promising method to treat MAW, and various technologies have been developed to treat this type of waste, such as the case of up-flow anaerobic filter reactor (Chen et al., 2020), up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor (de Barros et al., 2017) and microfiltration (MF) reactor (Basu et al., 2015). However, these technologies require additional investment on pre-treatment or equipment, and some inhibitory effects also severely influence the stability and efficiency of AD. The task to treat this wastewater is intensive and difficult and seriously restricts the production and development of the molasses alcohol industry (Arimi et al., 2014). Previous research indicated that using pig manure as a mixed feedstock of MAW was relatively effective (Shen et al., 2014). However, owing to its strong odor and high costs of transportation, pig manure is not suitable for use as a feedstock for co-digestion in or near alcohol production plants. CAW is rich in carbohydrates and contains a large amount of nutrients and trace elements, such as nitrogen and phosphorus (Wang et al.,2013; Rosa et al.,2014). In addition, its suitable C/N ratio and high BOD render it highly suitable for treatment with AD (Zhang et al., 2017; Wadjeam et al., 2019). Although CAW has a low degree of toxicity, its BOD, COD, and suspended solids exceed the national allowable limits for discharge. Thus, the disposal of untreated CAW is harmful to the local environment (Meier et al., 2020). However, CAW is an attractive co-substrate, which is produced simultaneously with MAW in alcohol production plants. The co-digestion of MAW and CAW offers economic and environmental benefits owing to its cost savings by enabling the processing of different types of wastewater in the same facility and solving the issue of seasonal production stagnation of alcohol production plants. Furthermore, the co-digestion process is more consistent with the mode of production of various alcohol feedstocks in the plant and could improve the efficiency of utilization of raw materials and ensure the quality and sustainable supplementation of raw materials. The co-digestion of MAW and CAW could play an important role in reducing the cost of wastewater treatment in the alcohol production industry in Guangxi and extending the industrial chain of the sugar industry. To date, however, no studies have reported the use of CAW for the co-digestion of MAW. In this study, the co-digestion technique was applied to the degradation of organic matter and the resource utilization of MAW. The purpose of this experiment was to explore the auxiliary effect of CAW on the degradation of MAW, compare the effects of co-digestion and single feedstock AD treatments, and explore the relationship of microbial community structural diversity in the fermentation system at different stages of anaerobic digestion, providing a foundation for the further effective treatment of alcohol wastewater."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock and inoculum,"2.1 Feedstock and inoculum MAW and CAW were provided by the Guangxi Guitang (Group) Co., Ltd. Guangxi, China) and the Guangxi Beihai COFCO Group Co., Ltd. (Guangxi, China), respectively. MAW and CAW were stored at 4 °C following their collection. The physico-chemical characteristics of MAW and CAW are provided in Table 1 . Elemental analysis showed that the C/N ratio of MAW and CAW were 53 and 21.3, respectively. The activated sludge was collected from an internal circulation AD reactor of a sugar plant. The total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) of the inoculum were 35.4 g·L-1 and 20.8 g·L-1, respectively."
3,Experiment establishment and operation,"2.2 Experiment establishment and operation The device used in this experiment was an AMPTS-II fully automated methane potential test system from Bioprocess Control Sweden AB (Lund, Sweden). The methane production of the samples was tested and analyzed using AMPTS II. The experiment was conducted in six 500 mL glass bottles with a working volume of 400 mL at 37 ± 0.5℃ controlled by the water bath and continuously stirred at a speed of 120 r·min−1. A total of 150 mL of activated sludge and 250 mL of feedstock were added to each bottle, and the S/I (substrate/inoculum ratio) was 1.5. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Two treatments (designated the M and C treatment) of three replicates were tested for a total of six experimental AD bottles (see Supplementary Materials). The operation mode was semi-continuous, and the feedstock was adjusted so that the readings were in the range of 6.9–7.2. Each reactor was fed manually every 24 h using an injection syringe with an 80 mL feedstock, and an equivalent amount of the digestate was removed. Oxygen was removed by flushing the reactor with nitrogen gas for 20 min. The run was divided into five stages. The run was maintained for five days as one Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) and established for 15 days (three HRT) as one reaction stage. C treatment: AD was conducted using only MAW with an increasing OLR that ranged 3.75 gCOD·L-1·d-1 to 7.5 gCOD·L-1·d-1 (see Supplementary Materials). The volume and concentration were the same as those of the MAW, which was fed into the M reactor, and the remaining volume of the solution was replenished with distilled water. M treatment: During the entire process, the OLR was 7.5 gCOD·L-1·d-1. Based on MAWCOD: CAWCOD ratios of 1:1, 1:0.67, 1:0.5, 1:0.33, and 1:0, the concentration of CAW in the mixed wastewater was gradually reduced until the injected sample was pure MAW (i.e., 1:0) (see Supplementary Materials)."
4,Analytical measurements,"2.3 Analytical measurements The soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) was determined using the Hach 2 h spectrophotometry method and pH (pH-3C pH meter) of the influent water were measured daily, and the methane yield was recorded daily using an automatic methane potential system. The VFAs were detected using gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2010, a DB-FFAP column). Microbial community changes were analyzed at the end of each stage as previously described (Lu et al., 2019). The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) was detected using Hach BODTrakⅡ, and the concentrations of SO4 2− were determined through Hach DR3900. The C/N ratio was measured using an elemental analyzer. The total contents of Fe and Zn2+ were determined using Inductive Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry (ICP5000). The determination of total solids (TS), Volatile solids (VS) and NH4+-N were measured as previously described (Lu et al., 2020), while total phosphorus (TP) was measured as previously described (Lu et al., 2019). Elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Vario EL III, Elementar, Germany)."
5,Microbial community analysis,"2.4 Microbial community analysis The starting sludge (Day 0) was extracted separately and designated Group O. Sludge samples were obtained on the last day of each stage and stored at −80℃ until the DNA was extracted. The samples were sent to Biomarker Technologies Co. (Beijing, Ltd., China) for high-throughput sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis of the V3-V4 16S rRNA regions as previously described (Lu et al., 2019)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Performance characteristics of the AD bottles,"3.1 Performance characteristics of the AD bottles 3.1.1 SCOD removal rate Additional CAW was added to the M treatment, and its OLR was substantially higher than that of the C treatment. At the beginning of AD process, the M treatment reached the highest rate of removal of the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), as high as 81.41 ± 2.47%, while the rate of removal of SCOD by the C treatment was approximately 56.74 ± 1.07% (Fig. 1 ). During the periods of stage I and II, the rate of removal of the SCOD from the M treatment was observably higher than that of the C treatment. This could have been because CAW is a promising co-digestion feedstock, which is rich in nutrients and has the potential to enhance the production of biogas (Meier et al., 2020). The optimal C/N ratio is in the range of 20–30 for AD, which is critical for the high efficiency of AD (Kumar and Samadder, 2020). In this study, the C/N ratios of MAW and CAW were 53 and 21.3, respectively. The C/N ratio of CAW fell under the optimal range, which is characterized as a promising substrate with a high potential for AD. The C/N ratio of MAW was higher than the optimal value, which could inhibit the AD process. The addition of CAW decreased the C/N ratio of the feedstock. Thus, the mixing of MAW and CAW provided an appropriate ratio of various levels of carbon and nitrogen, which maintained the balance of nutrients for microorganisms and enhanced the stability of AD. As the OLR increased, the rates of removal of SCOD from the M and C treatments were 68.35 ± 0.86% and 57.77 ± 0.58%, respectively, at the end of stage II. It is worth noting that rate of removal of SCOD from the M treatment was much higher than that of the C treatment. The elevated OLR resulted in a decreasing rate of utilization of substrates, while the co-digestion alleviated the inhibitory effects of high OLR and promoted the performance of AD. This result agreed with research by Zhou et al. (2021). Moreover, as the ratio of CAW decreased in the M treatment, the rate of removal of SCOD also decreased from 81.41 ± 2.47% to 68.35 ± 0.86%. The reason was that MAW contains a variety of toxic substances or inhibitory compounds, such as melanoidins and polyphenol colorants, which have serious antimicrobial effects on the process of AD (Arimi et al., 2014). CAW was reported as a promising substrate of co-digestion (Wang et al.,2013; Rosa et al.,2014; Wadjeam et al.,2019). CAW can alleviate the inhibitory effect in the MAW, and the nutrient substances in CAW favor anaerobic microorganisms (Rosa et al., 2014). Thus, the co-digestion of MAW with CAW alleviates the antimicrobial effects and promotes the performance of AD. During stage III, the rate of removal of SCOD from both treatments displayed an upward trend. During stage IV, the rate of removal of SCOD in the M treatment proceeded steadily, remaining at 70% to 72%. However, the rate of removal of SCOD from the C treatment shifted from 63% to 70% at the end of stage IV. It was apparent that the M treatment had a steady AD performance. At stage V, when the CAW was no longer added, the same amount of MAW was used. When the influent COD was the same, the rate of removal of COD from the M treatment was significantly higher than that of the C treatment (P < 0.0001). During the final 10 days of stage V, the maximum rate of removal of M was 70.85 ± 1.86%, while the maximum rate of removal from the C treatment was 65.40 ± 0.83%. When the stable period was reached, the rate of removal of SCOD from the M treatment was 70.13 ± 0.16%, and the rate of removal of SOCD from the C treatment was 61.23 ± 0.36%. Thus, with respect to the removal of SCOD, the addition of CAW guarantees better acclimation and performance of the biomass. The results revealed that the M treatment promoted a preferable operational performance for AD than the C treatment in the OLR of 7.5 gCOD·L-1·d-1 at the same influent situation. 3.1.2 Methane (CH4) production The rate of methane production represents the methanogenic activities related to the performance of AD. The variation of the production of CH4 on a daily per gram of COD removal basis for the M and C treatments is shown in Fig. 2 . Different trends could be observed for the C and M treatments. It is clear that the production of methane by the C treatments dramatically fluctuated during the first stage. Indeed, the production of methane by the C treatment reached its maximum value at day 7 with 149.73 ± 6.11 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1, and the production of methane then gradually dropped to 86.47 ± 5.43 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 at the end of the first stage. Alternatively, the production of methane from the M treatment increased and reached its peak value of 131.73 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 on day 6. This was followed by a gradual reduction to 120.13 ± 0.93 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 at the end of the first stage. The highest rate of production of methane by the C treatment occurred on day 7, while that of the M treatment occurred on day 6. This could be due to the addition of carbohydrate-rich CAW which helped the nutrients to be balanced and the effects of microorganisms to be synergistic (Wadjeam et al., 2019). Co-digestion reduced the time that the anaerobic microorganisms required to adapt, thus, accelerating the process of production of methane. Moreover, not only did the co-digestion produce more intermediates, including VFAs that can be utilized by methanogenesis, it also promoted the activities of methanogenic bacteria that enhance the production of methane. Similar findings have also been reported by Li et al. (2017). After stage I, when the OLR had increased further, the production of methane by the C treatment fluctuated at a considerably lower level. This suggests that the mono-digestion of MAW inhibited the growth of methanogens, which influenced the methane production and system stability. With the accumulation of non-biodegradable components in the MAW, the activities of microbial communities decreased, which could result in the low production of methane. (Zhou et al., 2019) During the final stage at a high load (7.5 gCOD·L-1·d-1), the daily methane production rate of the C treatment was dramatically reduced, which manifested in the increased inhibitory effects on methanogens owing to the increased presence of toxic substances or inhibitory compounds contained in the MAW. This result was consistent with previous findings (de Silva Mazareli et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2009). Moreover, since the production of methane directly correlated with the OLR, the lower value indicated that the loading COD could not be effectively degraded to methane, since an overloaded COD exceeded the digestion ability of the current AD system. Gao et al. (2020) observed similar results. The same inhibitory effect of MAW was also observed by Li et al. (2017), including the inhibitory effects of high sulfate and COD concentrations. The accumulation of VFAs also have adverse effects on the production of methane (Glanpracha and Annachhatre, 2016). By comparison, owing to the acclimation of CAW, the M treatment reactor maintained a steady state with respect to more stable methane production at the high OLR (7.5 gCOD·L-1·d-1) during stages II to IV, indicating that the addition of CAW enhanced the tolerance of AD system and its ability to recover biogas. The high degree of enhancement of the daily production of methane was observed in the M treatment during its final stage, resulting in the accumulation of up to 103.93 ± 1.50 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 (79.1 ± 1.72 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 of C treatment), which was confirmed by the lower amounts of VFAs that accumulated in the M treatment in comparison with the C treatment. Moreover, the C/N is one of the most important values that influences the production of biogas in AD (Gao et al., 2020). The addition of CAW promoted the optimal C/N ratio of the feedstock, which alleviated the inhibitory effect caused by MAW, thus increasing the production of methane. Under the same conditions, the maximum daily production of methane by the M treatment was 23.87% higher than that of the C treatment. In this study, the addition of CAW was considered to be an inexpensive strategy to weaken the inhibitory effects with respect to MAW and enhance system stability. Therefore, co-digestion promoted the degradation of biowaste and the recovery of bioenergy. 3.1.3 pH variation and contents of VFAs The pH value can directly reflect the efficiency of the AD system. The optimal pH value favors system stability and promotes methane production. Methanogenic microorganisms prefer a pH of approximately 7.0 (Arhoun et al., 2019). Thus, during the entire anaerobic digestion process, the wastewater influent pH value was adjusted to approximately 7.0. AD is a complicated process that utilizes different types of microorganisms. Acidogenic microorganisms can tolerate a wide range of pH values from 4.0 to 8.5. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the pH values of both treatments were maintained between 7 and 8, which is appropriate to the survival of microorganisms and the degradation of organic matter. The M treatment had a slightly higher pH value than that of the C treatment during the whole AD process, which indicated that the M treatment had a higher capacity and was more stable than the C treatment. Thus, the co-digestion provided lower acidification potential. Similar results were found by Mazareli et al. (2016). Furthermore, this may indicate that the M treatment is more efficient at degrading acidic components, such as fatty acids, thus, promoting the rates of removal of SCOD and enhancing the production of biogas. VFAs are generated as a group of key intermediates from hydrolysis and acidogenesis that include acetic acid, propionate acid, butyrate acid, valeric acid and lactic acid (Ryue et al., 2020). The VFAs play an important role in AD and can be converted into methane by the methanogenic phase. It has been estimated that 72% of the methane was produced from acetic acid in VAFs (Yuan and Zhu, 2016). The rapid accumulation of VFAs may lead to system failure and process inhibition, such as a sudden drop in the pH and a decline in methanogenic activity (Kumar and Samadder, 2020). Under some circumstances, the VFAs can reach concentrations of 1,500 mg·L-1, which can influence the performance of system (Kumari et al., 2018). Furthermore, the AD system was clearly unstable when the concentrations of VFAs reached as high as 3,500 mg·L-1 (Mehariya et al., 2018). Thus, the production of VFAs is a crucial indicator throughout the whole AD process and describes the efficiency and stability of the AD digestor. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the concentrations of VFAs ranged from 118 mg·L-1 to 1,403 mg·L-1 or two treatments during the five stages. During the first four stages of the anaerobic reaction, the effluent VFA contents of the C and M treatments did not differ considerably, and both were < 180 mg·L-1, indicating that the VFAs generated from hydrolysis and acidogenesis were degraded by methanogens at an equally appropriate rate (Glanpracha and Annachhatre, 2016). Thus, the situations of the anaerobic reaction systems of the two treatments were stable. In the final stage, the VFA contents of the C and M effluents were 1,150.05 ± 253.13 mg·L-1 and 397.06 ± 141.82 mg·L-1, respectively. There was some increase in the VFA content of the two treatment effluents, and that of the C treatment increased remarkably. This indicated that the imbalance between the rate of production of VFAs and their rate of consumption resulted in an accumulation of VFAs in the C treatment at a high OLR (7 g·L-1·d-1) of MAW, which resulted in a sharp continuous decline in the rate of removal of SCOD. Therefore, the high concentration of VFAs resulted in the inhibition of the efficiency of AD related to the C treatment of effluents. These findings were highly consistent with those of Meier et al. (2020). In contrast, the inhibitory effects owing to VFAs were not observed in the M treatment, which confirmed that a more effective nutritional balance and dilution of toxic substances or inhibitory compounds was provided by the addition of CAW. Thus, the performance of AD in the M treatment was higher than the high OLR of MAW (7 g·L-1·d-1). To maintain the stability of system, the effluent VFAs should generally be controlled when they reach approximately 1,000 mg·L-1. At the beginning of AD, the two treatments were in optimal operating conditions when the contents of VFAs were < 500 mg·L-1. The low content of VFAs was owing to the conversion of acids into biogas, which indicated that the VFAs can be effectively used by the methanogenic phase. This is consistent with the research of Kumari et al. (2018). Furthermore, it was obvious that the OLR of effluent should not be elevated since the contents of VFAs were increasing up to 1,000 mg·L-1. This result was consistent with that of previous research. At the overloaded OLR, the rate of generation of VFAs in the AD was much higher than the VFA consumption of AD, which led to the accumulation of VFAs and decrease in pH (Glanpracha and Annachhatre, 2016). In the final stage, the contents of VFAs of the M and C effluents were 397.06 ± 141.82 mg·L-1 and 1,150.05 ± 253.13 mg·L-1, respectively. The contents of VFAs in the M treatment were dramatically lower than those of the C treatment. This phenomenon occurred because the excessively increasing dosage of MAW lead to further inhibition with the increase in accumulation of VAFs, which impacts the stability of AD system. In the case of the influent of two treatments with the same properties, it is apparent that the content of VFAs in the M treatment was significantly smaller than that of the C treatment, indicating that the addition of CAW in the previous stage for mixed anaerobic digestion enhanced the stability and biodegradability of the reaction system. Thus, the co-digestion of MAW and CAW promoted positive effects on the performance of AD."
8,Microbial community structure,"3.2 Microbial community structure Typically, the performance of anaerobic system is directly related to the structure of microbial community. Anaerobic microbial communities can be categorized into two domains, bacteria and archaea (Yuan and Zhu, 2016). Bacteria partake in the hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps, while the archaea participate in the process of methanogenesis with respect to methane formation (Tonanzi et al., 2020). Co-digestion offers the benefits of substrate diversification and a more effective nutritional balance, which led to a more versatile and robust microbial community (Tyagi et al., 2018). Thus, the co-digestion AD system can withstand various types of operational stresses. The alpha-diversity index can be introduced to compare the richness and evenness of microbial communities in the two treatments. The abundance-based coverage estimators (ACE) and the Chao, Simpson and Shannon indices that were analyzed on the basis of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) number (see Supplementary Materials), and the Coverage of Bacteria and Archaea were as high as 0.997and 0.9997. The OTUs of bacteria ranged between 469 and 595, while the analysis of the archaeal microbiome produced a lower number of OTUs (52–59). The results demonstrated that the microbial diversity of the M treatment was higher than that of C treatment, particularly for the archaea. Compared with the number of OTUs of the original activated sludge, the number of OTUs in the C treatment gradually decreased, and a pronounced reduction was particularly evident in stage I. For the M treatment, the number of OTUs exhibited a small decrease compared with that of the original activated sludge. The number of OTUs of archaea in the M treatment was higher than that of the C treatment in each stage. The results indicated that the addition of CAW in the early stages boosts the activities of microorganisms and helps to increase the number of archaeal OTUs. The diversity indices ACE and Chao1 of the two treatments presents similar trends with the number of OTUs. Thus, the richness of archaea in the M treatment was higher than that of the C treatment. The diversity indices ACE and Chao1 of the two treatments were reduced during the process of AD, which indicates that more adapted microorganism were enriched and the abundance of redundant microorganisms reduced. This was consistent with the result of a previous study (Zeng et al., 2019). Simpson and Shannon indices are used to demonstrate the diversity of microbial community. The similar results of the Simpson and Shannon indices between the C and M treatments revealed that there was no significant different in the diversity of the two treatments. PCA can be used to analysis the similarity of the microbial community and was performed to show the influence of the addition of CAW in feedstock (Fig. 4 ). A PCA analysis indicated that the samples can be divided into three groups. This is consistent with the research of Wang et al. (2019). In terms of bacteria, all the samples of C treatment clustered together in the bottom-left quadrant, while the sample of M treatments grouped in the left-top quadrant. Moreover, the original activated sludge sample was positioned in the right quadrants. Thus, the co-digestion of CAW promoted a significant effect on the bacterial community composition. The samples of archaea in the two treatments were more similar in stage Ⅱ. The co-substrate of CAW can directly be used by bacteria in the steps of hydrolysis, acidogenesis and acetogenesis, which could significantly influence the bacterial composition. In contrast, the methanogenic archaea predominantly participated in the final phase of anerobic processes and consumed acetate acids, CO2 and H2 to produce methane. Therefore, the addition of CAW had less of an impact on the archaeal community during the process of AD. 3.2.1 Bacterial populations The distribution of bacterial community at the phylum level is shown in Fig. 5 a, and the distribution of bacterial community at the family level is demonstrated in Fig. 5 b. The diversity of bacteria in the level of phylum and family did not differ during the five stages in AD for two treatments. However, their abundances varied. The most representative phyla were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Thermotogae and Proteobacteria, which were also the most prevalent bacteria that were frequently detected in the AD of vinasse and sugarcane vinasse (de Barros et al., 2017; Li et al.,2017). The phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, also observed in the AcoD of bagasse spraying wastewater and MAW by Shen et al. (2013), comprised 33.93% and 27.83%, respectively. The acidogenic bacteria included Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi in the two treatments, and they had a significant effect on the maintenance of a syntrophic balance between acetogens and methanogens. Firmicutes are acetate-oxidizing bacteria, which can cooperate with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in syntropy. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are hydrolytic bacteria, which can decompose raw feedstocks into small organic molecules (Kim et al., 2019). Chloroflexi participates in the degradation of glucose and utilizes hydrogen to produce methane. Chloroflexi can also convert phenol to VFAs. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the two dominant bacterial phyla during the first stage. The abundances of these two phyla in the C treatment were 29.28% and 18.8%, respectively, and the abundances of these two phyla in the M treatment were 31.87% and 18.81%, respectively, higher than those in the C treatment. Bacteroidetes is active in the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of AD, which is composed of strict anaerobes that can convert complex organic compounds into organic acids, monosaccharides, lower alcohols and amino acids as primary byproducts (Nilawati et al., 2021). Related research shows that the Firmicutes phylum is composed of acetate-oxidizing bacteria (Campanaro et al., 2018), which also have an outstanding effect on cellulose degradation by the biogas microbial community (Wirth et al., 2012). During the first stage, the relative abundances of the most prevalent three bacterial phyla of the two treatments were higher than those of the original activated sludge with the exception of Bacteroidetes. This could be because the addition of MAW had a negative effect on the phylum Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, changes in the abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes can also influence the system performance of AD related to the rate of removal of SCOD and methane production, which were consistent with the higher rate of removal of SCOD and the production of methane in the M treatment of co-digestion. The abundance of Proteobacteria increased to 13.2% in the M treatment, while that in the C treatment was reduced to 3.3%. The prevalence of Proteobacteria was the most significantly altered with the addition of CAW. The phylum Proteobacteria, which live symbiotically with hydrogenotrophic methanogens, is composed of microbes that can degrade long-chain fatty acids to produce acetate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide (Hua et al., 2020). CAW has been demonstrated to be a promising co-substrate to increase the production of hydrogen, and co-digestion could promote the utilization of substrates to produce hydrogen by bacteria, such as Proteobacteria (Meier et al., 2020; Wadjeam et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013). The Cloacimonetes phylum comprised 3.4% in the C treatment and 8.57% in the M treatment, indicating that Cloacimonetes facilitates the co-digestion system. Cloacimonetes has been reported to be involved in the degradation of cellulose and amino acids in syntrophic propionate oxidation and produce acetate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen (Westerholm et al., 2020). From the second to the fourth stages, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were also the two predominant bacterial phyla, and the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phylum in the M treatment were higher than those in the C treatment. In particular, the bacteria in phylum Firmicutes in the C treatment decreased from 18.8% to 9.6%. Moreover, the phylum Proteobacteria in the C treatment increased to 11.8% during the second stage, which was higher than that in the M treatment. However, during the third and fourth stages, the numbers of bacteria from the phylum Proteobacteria in the M treatment were much higher than those in the C treatment. Thus, the addition of CAW positively affected the bacterial communities, which were consistent with previous evidence of the rate of removal of SCOD and the production of methane. A decrease in the ratio of CAW added resulted in the fluctuation of the relative abundances of the phyla Proteobacteria in the M treatment, which were consistent with the fluctuation of rate of removal of SCOD in these stages. Alternatively, the gradual increase in the OLRs and mono-digestion led to the decrease in relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes in the C treatment. Firmicutes can degrade carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and also utilize various VFAs (Li et al., 2013). Therefore, the production of methane in the C treatment was much lower than that in the M treatment. These results reveal that the characteristics of feedstock (co-digestion with different ratios) and operating situation relating to AD may be impacted by the composition of bacterial community, thus, affecting the performance of AD. Moreover, the same observations were reported in a previous study (Tang et al., 2019). In the final stage, the abundance of Bacteroidetes gradually increased following the addition of MAW ratio. Most Bacteroidetes species produce acetic acid, propionic acid, formic acid and succinic acid (Tang et al., 2019). This may be the reason that VFAs in both treatments increased dramatically during the final stage. With a lack of the addition of CAW in M treatment, the phylum Proteobacteria decreased from 16.2% to 11.06%, and the phylum Firmicutes decreased from 16.7 % to 12.8%. This was consistent with the unstable conditions of co-digestion system related to an unstable rate of removal of SCOD. The abundance of Thermotogae was 12.7% in the C treatment and 12.6% in the M treatment. Thermotogae can adapt to a wide range of temperatures and utilize a variety of simple sugars, complex carbohydrates and complex polysaccharides (de Barros et al., 2017). Thermotogae are known as hydrogen-producing bacteria and can also degrade glycerol to produce acetate and hydrogen (Hu et al., 2020). This observation revealed that the co-digestion of CAW had a negligible influence on Thermotogae. Elusimicrobia is an essential anaerobic microorganism in anaerobic reactors. Some researchers have found that Elusimicrobia has some effect on improving the performance of removal of organic substances. Additionally, it can effectively degrade compounds that are not easily degraded by other organisms. Elusimicrobia helps to improve organic wastewater treatment. The abundance of Elusimicrobia in the C treatment was 2.62%, while the abundance of Elusimicrobia in the M treatment was 1.77% higher than that in the C treatment. Synergistetes can decompose carbohydrates, organic acids, sugars, cellulose and glucose into H2 and acetate (Granada et al., 2018). The abundance of Synergistetes in the C treatment was 12.71%, while the abundance of Synergistetes in the M treatment was 4.45% higher than that in the C treatment. The dominant family was Porphyromonadaceae, followed by Kosmotogaceae and family uncultured_bacterium_c_Bacteroidetes_vadinHA17. Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, most of the bacteria were from the family Porphyromonadaceae and family uncultured_bacterium_c_Bacteroidetes_vadinHA17. During the first stage, the abundance of family Porphyromonadaceae increased from 6.6% to 19.7% in the M treatment, while it decreased from 6.6% to 5.6% in the C treatment. Conversely, the relative abundance of family uncultured_bacterium_c_Bacteroidetes_vadinHA17 significantly decreased for two treatments. The results indicated that MAW may have an inhibitory effect on the families Porphyromonadaceae and uncultured_bacterium_c_Bacteroidetes, but CAW may facilitate growth of the family Porphyromonadaceae to counteract the inhibitory effect from MAW. Porphyromonadaceae are syntrophic bacteria that participate in the important steps, including hydrolysis, acidogenesis or acetogenesis, offering acetate as a substrate for methanogens (Nzila et al., 2019). Therefore, the addition of CAW brings benefits to the co-digestion system to maintain better AD performance, thus, alleviating the negative effects related to MAW. During the second to the fourth stages, the family Porphyromonadaceae was dominant and gradually increased during these stages. The abundance of Porphyromonadaceae was 17.1% and 26.1% in the C and M treatments, respectively. It was reported that Porphyromonadaceae significantly positively correlated with the production of acetate and butyrate (Ayudthaya et al., 2018). Butyrate can be converted to acetate that is utilized by methanogenic bacteria to produce methane. Thus, the production of methane coincided with an increase in the relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae. The family Porphyromonadaceae may be responsible for the accumulation of methane during AD. During the final stage, the abundance of Porphyromonadaceae was 21.6% and 28.9% in the C and M treatments, respectively. Porphyromonadaceae can degrade complex substances and produce VFAs during the process of acidogenesis (Granada et al., 2018). This family is closely related to a high concentration of VFAs (Ayudthaya et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019). The results of VFAs showed that the concentrations of VFAs significantly increased during the final stage, which was consistent with the changes in bacterial communities. Owing to the inhibition from MAW, the abundance of family uncultured_bacterium_c_Bacteroidetes_vadinHA17 also decreased in both treatments until the final stage. The second most prevalent family was Kosmotogaceae. The abundance of family Kosmotogaceae (Thermotogae phylum) clearly increased for two treatments during the whole stages and had a similar abundance during the final stage, 12.7% and 12.6%, which corresponded to the result of Thermotogae phylum. The fourth most prevalent family was Desulfomicrobiaceae (Proteobacteria phylum). Desulfomicrobiaceae is a sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) that can use sulfate as an electron acceptor to produce hydrogen sulfide. The presence of SRB could compete with methanobacteria to consume organic substrates, and the high concentrations of H2S are noxious to microorganisms; thus, reducing the production of methane (Shen et al., 2013). MAW is a type of sulfate-rich effluent. Owing to the addition of MAW, an increased amount of sulfuric acid was added during the AD process and can be used to produce hydrogen sulfide. In terms of essential trace elements, higher concentrations of total Fe and Zn2+ were found in the CAW in this study. These trace elements favor the synthesis of critical enzymes during the process of methanogenesis. The sulfide concentration of the MAW was as high as 7,505 ± 180 mg·L-1, which is higher than the concentrations of sulfide that can inhibit the MAW (Yuan and Zhu, 2016). Fe also can precipitate with sulfide, which relieves the inhibitory effect on methanogens (Yuan and Zhu, 2016). The competition between SRB and methanogenic microorganisms for organic matter and H2 may result in the inhibitory effect on methanogens and subsequent decrease of methane production. During the first to fourth stages, the abundance of Desulfomicrobiaceae in both treatments was almost the same. However, with the addition of same effluent during the final stage, the abundance of Desulfomicrobiaceae increased to 14% in the C treatment, which was much higher than that in the M treatment (7.8%). The higher abundance of Desulfomicrobiaceae indicated that the AD system may suffer inhibitory effects from SRB. The co-digestion of CAW may relieve the inhibitory effect from SRB, thereby optimizing the performance of AD. Additionally, the MAW was diluted with deionized water in the C treatment, while the dilution was conducted using CAW in the M treatment. Thus, the stabilizing effect of CAW had no relationship with the dilution effects on the toxic compounds or inhibitory materials in MAW. During the third to final stages, the abundance of Ruminococcaceae (Firmicutes phylum) in the M treatment was higher than that in the C treatment. It was revealed that the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae increased with the gradual increase of molasses wastewater in the AD process, which suggests that the fermentation microbial community acclimated. This acclimation suggests that the use of Ruminococcaceae is a promising strategy to promote the production of methane (Chen et al., 2020). This could be the reason why the production of methane by the M treatment was higher than that of the C treatment. 3.2.2 Archaeal populations Methanogenic archaea predominantly participated in the final phase of anerobic processes. Methanogens can be divided into aceticlastic groups and hydrogenotrophic groups. The major aceticlastic genus included Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta, while the genus of hydrogenotrophic groups included Methanosphaerula, Methanobacterterium, and Methanospirillum (Kim et al., 2019). Hydrogenotrophic methanogens primarily consume CO2 and H2 to produce methane. Aceticlastic methanogens can directly transform acetate into methane and CO2. The community of methanogens is shown in Fig. 5 c. The predominant archaeal genera in the inoculum and two treatments had the same composition but differed in their richness. Methanosaeta, uncultured_ bacterium_c_W5, uncultured_archaeon, Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium were the predominant methanogens in the two treatments during the AD process. In the first stage, the relative abundance of Methanosaeta was 52.8% in the C treatment, higher than the 45.1% in M treatment. Methanosaeta was the dominant archaea genus in the two treatments and can only utilize acetic acid to produce methane, which is a type of strict acetotrophic methanogen (Tang et al., 2019). This could be the reason that the production of methane by the C treatment reached a maximum value of 131.73 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 on day 7 of compared with the peak value of 120.13 ± 0.93 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 at day 6 in the M treatment. During stage II to IV, the relative abundance of Methanosaeta in the C treatments tended to decrease, with a change from 52.8% to 45.3%. This decrease indicated that the increased inhibitory effects on methanogens were owing to the increasing presence of toxic substances or inhibitory compounds contained in the MAW. In contrast, the relative abundance of Methanosaeta in the M treatments slightly increased from 45.1% to 46%. Thus, the addition of CAW alleviated inhibitory effects on methanogens with respect to MAW and promoted the stability of AD system, such as promoting an increase in the production of methane. During the final stage, the relative abundance of Methanosaeta decreased sharply from 45.3% to 27.9% in the C treatment and from 46% to 31.9% in the M treatment. This is because Methanosaeta in both treatments (with no addition of CAW in the M treatment) were exposed to the serious inhibitory effects of MAW at an OLR of 7.5 gCOD·L-1·d-1. However, the M treatment with the acclimation of CAW exhibited a better AD performance. Furthermore, with the higher richness of Methanosaeta, the M treatment also displayed a superior ability to produce methane and accumulated lower amounts of VFAs. In particular, up to 103.93 ± 1.5 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 methane was produced during the final period, while only 79.1 ± 1.72 mLCH4 ·gCOD -1·d-1 methane was generated by the C treatment. Methanosaeta can form long, thin filaments that provide granules and syntropy, while Methanobacterium produces short filaments. The thin filaments on Methanosaeta may increase the surface area of microorganism and offer more chances to degrade acetic acid (Zhou et al., 2019). During the first to fourth stages, the accumulated VFAs were rapidly metabolized by the methanogens. During the final stage, the relative abundance of Methanosaeta decreased sharply, and the concentrations of VFAs increased correspondingly. The relative abundance of methanogenic Archaea, such as Methanosaeta, were consistent with the remarkable increase in the concentration of VAFs related to acetate during the AD process. Thus, the results of Microbial Community Structure showed that the relative abundance of MA, such as Methanosaeta, declined in the two C treatments concurrent with the decrease in methane production and an increase in the accumulation in the amounts of VFAs. Additionally, the addition of CAW resulted in more effective AD performance and then facilitated the activities of methanogenetic microorganisms and the production of high amounts of methane. Methanosarcina is both an aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen that can utilize acetate, methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, H2/CO2, and CO to produce methane (Guo et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2020). Methanosaeta was more sensitive to high concentrations of acetate than Methanosarcina (Nilawati et al., 2021). In this study, the predominance of aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina) indicated that the production of methane in the two treatments primarily utilized acetate to produce methane via the aceticlastic metabolic pathway. During the first stage, the relative abundance of Methanosarcina in both treatments visibly declined by 4.4% in the C treatment and 3% in the M treatment compared with 11.7% in the inoculum. After the first stage, the relative abundance of Methanosarcina in the C treatment tended to decrease, from 4.4% to 1%, while the relative abundance of Methanosarcina in M treatment increased to 5.5% during the second stage and then dropped to 1.2% during the final stage. Moreover, not only the distribution of the aceticlastic archaea in two treatments produced a large amount of methane utilizing the produced acetic acid. In addition, hydrogenotrophic archaea can use H2 and CO2 in the AD process to generate methane. Indeed, the hydrogenotrophic archaea, such as Methanobacterium in this study, favor the efficient utilization of H2, thus maintaining the balance of H2 concentration in the AD system (de Barros et al., 2017). Methanobacterium was the sixth most predominant genus in the AD process. During the second to final stages, the relative abundance of Methanobacterium in the C treatment was close to that in the M treatment. Thus, the changes related to the relative abundance of Methanobacterium had no obvious influence on mono-digestion and co-digestion. These results indicated that during the AD stage of alcohol wastewater, the addition of CAW for mixed AD during the early stage favored an increase in the abundance of methanogens and resulted in an increase in the yield of methane. Therefore, the domains Bacteria and Archaea favored more effective AD performance of the treatments. In particular, the enhanced performance of CAW co-digestion with MAW over MAW mono-digestion is primarily associated with the enhanced activity of bacteria in the families Porphyromonadaceae (Bacteroidetes phylum), Ruminococcaceae (Firmicutes phylum), and Desulfomicrobiaceae (Proteobacteria phylum) and Archaea in the genera Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina. The equilibrium in the richness between the microbial communities for the domains Bacteria and Archaea favored more effective AD performance. In this study, MAW was not a desirable substrate for AD, since it results in a relatively high C/N ratio, high concentrations of sulfate and SCOD, and contains various toxic compounds. The mono-digestion of the high OLR of MAW (7 g·L-1·d-1) indicated a typical inhibitory effect owing to an accumulation of VFAs, which resulted in a sharp continuous decline in the rate of removal of SCOD, a reduction in the production of methane and a decrease in the abundance of dominant bacteria and archaea. Similar inhibitory effects of mono-digestion have also been previously reported (Li et al., 2017; Glanpracha and Annachhatre, 2016; Meier et al., 2020; Kumari et al., 2018). In contrast, the M treatment was performed at the high OLR during the whole process of AD, which maintained a steady state with respect to the effective removal of VFAs, the higher rate of removal of SCOD, more stable methane production and no archaeal inhibition. This was consistent with the findings of Tonanzi, et al. (2020). Compared with the mono-digestion of MAW, the main improvement in the co-digestion of CAW and MAW could be attributed to the appropriate C/N ratio and the sufficient trace elements in feedstock, which alleviates the inhibition of potentially toxic compounds and the synergistic reaction of microorganisms. The co-digestion alleviated the inhibitory effect caused by MAW, including the improper C/N ratio and higher concentration of sulfate and SCOD. The addition of CAW decreased the C/N ratio of the feedstock and increased the concentrations of total Fe and Zn2+, which maintained the balance of nutrients for microorganisms and favored the synthesis of critical enzymes in the process of methanogenesis. Thus, the co-digestion promoted synergistic effects in the process of AD, which was consistent with the results of Zhang et al. (2021) and Zhou et al. (2021). Moreover, consistent with previous evidence found in the co-digestion of CAW, the addition of CAW may promote higher abundance and activity of the microorganisms (Wadjeam et al., 2019; Wang et al.,2013; Rosa et al.,2014). Thus, this leads to the conclusion that the co-digestion of MAW and CAW have triggered advantageous synergistic effects, which alleviate the accumulation of VAFs, enhances the stability of AD system, improves the rate of removal of SCOD, boosts microbial activities, and facilitates the production of methane."
9,Conclusions,"CAW is available in sufficient quantity and can be transported inexpensively, which is promising for its use as a co-digestion feedstock for MAW. This study is the first to explore the performance of AD with two different types of wastewater produced by an alcohol distillery. The results reflect that the co-digestion is an effective and suitable strategy to solve the problem of disposal of MAW. The co-digestion counteracted the inhibitors of MAW, which significantly improved the efficiency of wastewater treatment. The improvement in AD performance could be owing to better feedstock properties and subsequently favored microbial activities."
