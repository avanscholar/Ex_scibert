0,Introduction,"The increase of worldwide energy demand and environmental concerns are among the most challenging issues of the 21st century [1]. As an emissions-free alternative fuel, hydrogen has been receiving a growing interest as an option to alleviate the world energy crisis [2]. More than 95% of current hydrogen production is based on steam reforming of natural gas and other fossil resources [2]. However, either depletion of fossil fuel reserves or global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions are questioning the use of fossil resource as feedstock for hydrogen production [3,4]. Recourse to using renewable feedstocks such as biomass or biomass-derived by-products can offer a sustainable and cost-competitive hydrogen production route. While hydrogen and syngas are generated from these renewable resources, biomass growth serves as a sink for produced CO2 thus offering a carbon dioxide neutral energy supply. As an important by-product of biodiesel production, glycerol has emerged as a promising feedstock for green hydrogen generation [2]. Biodiesel has been already commercialized in several countries in the past two decades and its use is expected to grow due to its renewability and considerable reduction in CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels [5,6]. In common biodiesel synthesis through transesterification of triglycerides with methanol, around 0.1 ton of crude glycerol by-product is stoichiometrically produced per each ton of biodiesel [7]. By 2020, approximately 3 Mt of crude glycerol are expected to be produced, whereas the annual demand for commercial use is expected to be less than 0.5 Mt [8]. Considering the significant oversupply, there is a compelling need to valorize this by-product economically, thus avoiding it to become a waste problem and to adversely weigh on biodiesel industrial development [7–9]. Regarding the expected unlimited future market of hydrogen and the interest in switching to renewable sources for its production, hydrogen generation from glycerol is one of the promising alternatives [10]. Various methods such as pyrolysis, steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (PO), auto-thermal reforming (ATR), and aqueous-phase reforming (APR) have been proposed to valorize biodiesel by-product into hydrogen [11–14]. SR is amongst the most mature industrial technologies [12] and only few adjustments are required to shift from commonly used feedstocks to glycerol. To enhance hydrogen production by glycerol steam reforming (GSR), the choice of appropriate catalysts is crucial. According to the literature, ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co) have shown catalytic activity in GSR [7]. Among them, catalysts with Ni supported on different inorganic oxides and their mixtures (such as Al2O3, MgO, CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, and SiO2) [4,15,16] are the most investigated ones due to their low cost and high availability. However, while Ni is effective for the cleavage of −CH3, −CH2-, OH, and −CC- bonds, its activity in water gas shift (WGS) reaction is limited beside its vulnerability to sintering and coke formation [17]. The surface properties of support materials used in the formulation of steam reforming catalysts can play an important role in enhancing WGS reaction and decreasing coke formation by oxidative removal of surface carbon deposits. One of the highly favored strategies is the utilization of oxides with good redox properties, such as rare-earth and transition-metal oxides (e.g., CeO2) [18]. Promotion of the catalytic performance by enhancing water activation can also be achieved by using oxides with basic properties such as alkaline earth oxides (e.g., MgO) [19–21]. Moreover, the use of basic oxides has also been suggested for lowering the concentration of acidic sites on the surface of acidic supports such as Al2O3. Dehydration of alcohols leads to alkenes production in the presence of strongly acidic surface sites leading to carbon deposition [19–21]. In addition, improved dispersion of Ni particles together with stronger interactions with the support through mediation of promoters, e.g., Mg, Ce and La, can also prevent coke formation [22]. New types of catalysts have also been developed by dispersing active metal phase on metal oxide matrix precursors such as perovskites (e.g., LaNixFe(1-x)O3 and La1-xCe x NiO3) [23,24], Mg-Al hydrotalcite [25,26], and mixed oxide spinels (e,g., NiAl2O4 and NiFe2O4) [27–30]. Mineral-type precursors [31,32] (like olivine [33,34]), with homogeneously distributed exchangeable metal cations in the crystal structure, are the other proposed materials to obtain a good dispersion of Ni particles and to benefit from the presence of elements, such as Mg and Fe, inside these materials. It has been reported that in some of these structures, highly dispersed metal particles formed in a reducing atmosphere exhibited high activity and stability in reforming reactions [30]. Moreover, the reduction of such catalysts may sometimes result in the combination of Ni with another element of the structure, to form a bimetallic species or alloy with improved catalytic performance [35]. In the case of Ni-olivine catalysts used in steam reforming reactions, it was suggested that the formation of various Ni-Fe alloys [36,37] and (Ni,Mg)O solid solutions [34,38] limited coke formation. Currently, about 65kt of solid oxide residues are yearly produced in a production process of upgraded titania-rich slag (UGS) from hemo-ilmenite ore (FeTiO3-Fe2O3), at Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium (RTIT) Company located in the metallurgical complex of RTIT in Sorel-Tracy (Québec, Canada). Without marketable use, this residue (UGS oxides) is disposed of in a mining waste site (P- 84, Sorel-Tracy). The elements composing this residue are mainly Fe, Mg and Al aggregating in the form of crystalized spinel groups of magnesioferrite (MgFe2O4), hercynite (FeAl2O4) and free periclase (MgO) [39]. Considering the magnesium and iron oxide species present in the residue, with several reported promoting effects in the formulation of steam reforming catalysts [19–22,25,33,34,38,40,41], this solid waste can be explored as an appropriate precursor for incorporating more active metals inside its spinel structure. This has been demonstrated in our recent study on nickel-borne UGS oxides which proved very efficient for the catalytic dry reforming of methane [42]. Solid state impregnation (SSI) is a facile, energy efficient and time saving method for preparation of mixed oxides for different applications including catalysis [43–46]. This method involves grinding of the reactants and subsequent calcination of the precursors to decompose them into corresponding oxides and does not require drying, purification or recycling of solvents [43]. Small amounts of volatile liquids (e.g., acetone, alcohol) can only be used as mixing homogenizers (they usually volatilize completely after less than 10–15min of grinding) [47]. In comparison with conventional wet impregnation method, higher dispersion of active metal species, stronger metal-support interactions and enhanced catalytic performance were reported by several authors for the catalyst synthesized by SSI [43]. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of Ni incorporated UGS oxides residue (Ni-UGS) as catalyst in glycerol steam reforming for hydrogen production. Ni was incorporated in the UGS oxides residue by SSI and the synthesised catalysts were characterized by XRD, ICP, TEM, and BET. Hydrogen yield, glycerol conversion, stability and regenerability of Ni-UGS catalyst were evaluated."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The as-received fine agglomerates of UGS oxides residue (hereinafter called as UGS) was ground to fine powder and sieved to particle size less than 75μm prior to use. The Ni-UGS catalyst was prepared based on the SSI method described above [43–47], by incorporating 12.5wt.% Ni into the UGS residual material. For this purpose, nickel nitrate hexahydrate Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Fisher, 99.9%) precursor and UGS were weighed out in their required amounts and then ground in an agate mortar at ambient temperature for about 20min. Acetone used to help homogenization was gradually evaporated during mixing after ca. 10min. The sample was calcined under air flow (200mLmin−1) at 600°C for 5h. Finally, the resulting solid was ground and sized afresh to particle sizes less than 75μm before characterisation and use in the reforming tests."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization Elemental analyses were carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300DV apparatus. Crystalline phases were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Siemens D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation (wavelength λ=1.54059Å) generated at 40kV and 30mA. The diffraction angles, 2Ɵ, ranged from 10° to 80° with a sweep of 1°/min. The particle size and morphology of catalyst as well as the type of coke formed on the reacted catalyst were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEOL JEM 1230 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 80kV. The samples were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol using an ultrasonic bath and then a drop of produced suspension was placed onto a copper grid coated with carbon films and dried at room temperature naturally. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET) were obtained with a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 system. BET surface areas were determined in the range of 0.05–0.3P/P0. Before measurements, the samples were outgassed under vacuum for 6h at 150°C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Perkin Elmer Lab System Diamond TGA-DTA) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) with quadrupole analyzer (Thermostar Prisma QMS200, Pfeiffer Vacuum) was used to study the solid state reaction of Ni precursor and UGS, and investigate the carbon deposited on catalyst. The samples were loaded in alumina crucibles and heated at a rate of 10°C/min under air flow (50mLmin−1) from room temperature to 1000°C (800°C for coke analysis). Changes in sample mass as well as the evolved gases were monitored as a function of time."
4,Evaluation of catalyst activity,"2.3 Evaluation of catalyst activity To evaluate the performance of prepared catalyst for H2 production by GSR, the reaction was performed in a stainless steel tubular fixed-bed reactor (11mm internal diameter and 40cm length) under atmospheric pressure. 0.5g of catalyst sample was loaded on a grid support fixed in the middle of the reactor and covered with quartz wool. Temperature was controlled by a thermo-controller (Omega, CN-7800) connected to a k-type thermocouple located inside the catalytic bed. Before introducing any reactant, the reactor was purged with argon for 30min. Prior to GSR reaction, an in-situ reduction pre-treatment at 650°C for 1.5h by a mixture stream of H2/argon (total flow of 50 STDmLmin−1 with 20vol% H2) was performed to activate the catalyst. The reactor was then cooled down to the reaction temperature of 580°C in a stream of pure argon to purge residual hydrogen. Hydrogen and argon flows were controlled using Omega (FMA-2620A) mass flow meters. After reaching the reaction temperature, a feed mixture of pure glycerol (Caledon, ≥99.5%) and water with a water/glycerol molar ratio of 9 (steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C) of 3) was injected into the pre-heater by a gas-tight glass syringe mounted in a New Era syringe infusion pump (NE-1000). The preheating section consisted of a horizontal spiral coil located inside a furnace and its temperature was controlled by a thermo-controller (Omega, CN-7800) connected to a k-type thermocouple located outside the spiral coil. The reactant mixture of glycerol and water were vaporized in the preheater and then mixed with argon as a carrier gas prior the feeding into the reforming reactor. The temperature of pre-heater and the line connecting the preheating section to the reactor were maintained at 300–350°C. The flow rate of argon was set to obtain a molar ratio of feeding reactant (glycerol+water mixture) to inert gas (argon) FI of 1:4. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) at the standard temperature and pressure (STP) was calculated to be 20,600cm3 gcat −1 h−1. The reactor outlet stream entered the condenser to separate condensable products. The gaseous reaction products were then analyzed on-line by microGC (Agilent Technologies, 3000A). Glycerol conversion to gaseous products (Xg) was calculated on the basis of the carbon balance (Eq. (1)): (1) X g ( % ) = m o l e s o f C a t o m s i n t h e g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s 3 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d × 100 Hydrogen yield (YH2) was calculated based on the maximum stoichiometric ratio of 7 between hydrogen and glycerol (Eq. (2)): (2) Y H 2 ( % ) = m o l e s o f H 2 p r o d u c e d 7 × m o l e s o f g l y c e r o l i n t h e f e e d × 100 To perform carbon balance, the carbon content of the condensable by-products was measured by CHNS analysis (EA 1108, Fisons, CHNS). Moreover, the amount of deposited carbon was determined by burning it in-situ with air after each experiment and measuring the amount of CO2 evolved by microGC. A carbon balance error (defined as |1− m outlet carbon /m inlet carbon |) less than 5% was calculated for all glycerol steam-reforming tests presented in this study. Thermodynamic equilibrium concentrations were calculated by Aspen Plus V9 software based on direct minimization of Gibbs free energy and used to estimate glycerol conversion, H2 yield and product distribution. The experimental data were compared to the theoretical values to investigate if equilibrium was reached."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of UGS oxides residue and Ni-UGS catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of UGS oxides residue and Ni-UGS catalyst Elemental analysis of as-received UGS oxides residue using ICP-MS (Table 1 ) revealed that iron (32wt.%), magnesium (18wt.%), and aluminium (5wt.%) are the main constitutive elements of the material and other elements such as Ca, Mn, Ti, and V are present in much lesser extent. Fig. 1 shows the TGA results and the corresponding differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of UGS without any modification (as-received UGS) and Ni incorporated UGS before air-calcination (as-prepared Ni-UGS) in the range of ambient temperature to 1000°C. According to Fig. 1a, the as-received UGS showed about 12% total weight loss that occurred in the ranges of 25–200°C and 280–430°C. The first region can be assigned to the loss of physisorbed water, while the second to the dehydroxylation of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) into periclase (MgO) [48]. The two other minor weight losses (totally about 3%) in TG curve of as-received UGS, which occurred in the ranges of 430–600°C and 820–980°C, can be attributed to crystal-phase changes of the material. According to Fig. 1b, a total weight loss of about 42% was observed during the decomposition of Ni-UGS up to 1000°C, with two main intervals accompanied by five peaks of weight loss rate in the DTG curve. The first interval (25–240°C) with two DTG minima at about 146°C and 215°C can be assigned to the loss of adsorbed water and crystal water of initial nickel nitrate hexahydrate reagent [49,50]. The weight losses in the second temperature region (285–480°C), with three DTG minima at about 326°C, 390°C, and 425°C, can be attributed to the decomposition of nickel nitrate [51,52], dehydroxylation of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) [48] and formation of new crystal phases. As can be seen from TG curve of Ni-UGS (Fig. 1b), there is almost no loss of weight after 600°C, suggesting that the nickel precursor decomposed completely up to this temperature with new phases formed, which has been further investigated by XRD. It was therefore concluded that 600°C could be a suitable calcination temperature for the Ni-UGS catalyst. Fig. 2 compares the X-ray diffractograms of as-received UGS and Ni-UGS. According to Fig. 2a, the major mineral phases of UGS oxides residue are spinel groups of magnesioferrite (MgFe2O4) and hercynite (FeAl2O4), which mutually co-exist in a Mg(Alx Fe2-x)O4 solid solution [39]. Magnetite(Fe3O4) (ICDD file No. 01-075-0449) and brucite (Mg(OH)2) (ICDD file No. 01-074-2220) were also detected. After Ni incorporation into UGS structure by SSI method (Fig. 2b), the diffraction lines of Mg(OH)2 at 2Ɵ=18.594°, 37.998°, 50.845°, and 58.621° (ICDD file No. 01-074-2220) disappeared as a result of thermal treatment (calcination of material at 600°C for 5h under air flow). Moreover, the appearance of new line at 2Ɵ=37.1° and intensification of peaks with maximum at 2Ɵ=43.1°, 62.9°, 74.7°, and 79.08° were also observed, which can be assigned to the formation of NiO (2Ɵ=37.23°, 43.26°, 62.84°, 75.37° and 79.36°) (ICDD file No. 01-078-0423), MgO (2Ɵ=37.13°, 43.14°, 62.66°, 75.14° and 79.11°) (ICDD file No. 01-075-1525) and/or a solid solution between these oxides as (Mg,Ni)O (2Ɵ=37.11°, 43.10°, 62.60°, 75.09° and 79.06°) (ICDD file No. 00-024-0712). Since MgO is a good solvent for the 3d-block transition metal ions, such as Ni+2 and Co+2 [53], it can be concluded that the formation of (Mg,Ni)O solid solution is more likely to occur. The formation of this solid solution can result in a better dispersion of Ni+2. Furthermore, the intensity of peaks at 2Ɵ=30.3°, 35.7°, 53.74° and 57.4° was also amplified, possibly due to the formation of NiFe2O4 (2Ɵ=30.27°, 35.74°, 37.28°, 43.47°, 53.88°, 57.55°and 62.72°) (ICDD file No. 00-003-0875) and/or a nickel iron mixed oxide (NixFe1-xO) such as Ni1.43Fe1.7O4 (2Ɵ=30.26°, 35.64°, 37.29°, 43.32°, 57.31°and 62.94°) (ICDD file No. 01-080-0072). It should be noted that a precise identification of new formed phases after Ni incorporation in UGS structure is not possible due to the overlapping of the most intense XRD peaks corresponding to the probable phases formed in the system. The final nickel loading of Ni-UGS catalyst, determined by ICP-MS analysis, was found to be 11.7wt.%. As reported in Table 2 , the BET surface area of UGS oxides residue and Ni-UGS are 8.5m2 g−1 and 10.3m2 g−1, respectively."
7,Catalytic performances in glycerol steam reforming,"3.2 Catalytic performances in glycerol steam reforming The catalytic performance and gas products distribution of glycerol steam reforming over Ni-UGS catalyst was investigated in a continuous fixed-bed reactor. All GSR tests were conducted at T=580°C, P=1bar, water to glycerol feed molar ratio (WGFR) of 9:1 (S/C=3) and feeding reactant (glycerol+water) to inert gas (Ar) molar ratio (FI) of 0.25, considered as optimum conditions according to a detailed thermodynamic analysis [54]. First, a blank (catalyst-free) experiment was carried out to determine the amount of hydrogen that could be produced as a result of glycerol thermal decomposition and its reaction with water. Second, the activity of the as-received UGS without any treatment was examined to study its ability to catalyze GSR. Finally, the performance of the prepared Ni-UGS catalyst was compared with that of a commercial alumina-supported nickel steam reforming catalyst (Hifuel™, Johnson Matthey Catalysts (UK) with 29.8wt.% Ni content and BET surface area of 24.99m2g−1). All tests were performed at the same operating conditions mentioned above. Fig. 3 a–c, presents the averages of glycerol conversion, hydrogen yield, gas product distribution, and H2/CO molar ratio for the above-mentioned experiments carried out for a run time of 4h. During this period, no significant catalyst deactivation was observed and the product distribution was approximately constant. The experimental results were compared with those at thermodynamic equilibrium at the mentioned operating condition. The weight of total deposited carbon on Ni-UGS and commercial catalyst at the end of 4h GSR test, was measured by TGA analysis and reported as the percentages of total inlet carbon. The results are showed in Fig. 3d. As can be seen, in the selected reaction conditions, both glycerol conversion to gaseous products and hydrogen yield in the blank test were quite low (Xg =7% and YH2 =4%, respectively). The catalytic performance of as-received UGS was better as compared to the blank reaction (Xg =23% and YH2 =14%), but still of modest appeal to claim status for an efficient catalyst. Although metallic iron is known to have catalytic activity in steam reforming processes, it is less effective than other active metals such as Ni [41]. For example, Toshihide et al. [55] compared the catalytic activity of several catalysts supported on La2O3 for GSR and reported the following order: Ru≃Rh>Ni>Ir>Co>Pt>Pd>Fe. It has also been stated that the presence of ion pairs on the surface of alkaline earth metal oxides (especially MgO) can heterolytically cleave alcohols to give RO− and H+ (Eq. (3)) [53]. Therefore, the better performance of as-received UGS in comparison with the blank test may also be attributed to the dehydrogenation of glycerol by the MgO existing in the as-received UGS. (3) The average glycerol conversion, hydrogen yield, and H2/CO molar ratio over Ni-UGS are Xg =87%, YH2 =79%, and 5.5, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 3b, the gaseous concentrations in experimental results of Ni-UGS catalyst are near those predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. At same operating conditions, Xg =86%, YH2 =71%, and H2/CO ratio of 4.1 were obtained for the commercial Ni-based steam reforming catalyst. Generally, glycerol steam reforming (GSR) mainly involves pyrolysis of glycerol to produce syngas (Eq. (4)) whereas H2 production is further promoted by water gas shift reaction in the presence of steam (Eq. (5)) [11]. Consequently, the overall reaction of GSR is represented by Eq. (6) [7]. (4) C 3 H 8 O 3 ↔ 3 CO + 4 H 2 Δ H 298 r = 251 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 (5) CO+H 2 O ↔ H 2 +CO 2 Δ H 298 r = − 41 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 (6) C 3 H 8 O 3 +3H 2 O ↔ 3CO 2 +7H 2 Δ H 298 r = 128 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 The product distribution in GSR is strongly affected by catalyst formulation. The higher activity of catalyst in water gas shift reaction will help removing the adsorbed CO from the catalyst surface and increase H2 production. It is worth mentioning that the Ni-UGS catalyst achieved higher hydrogen yield and H2/CO ratio despite its lower Ni content (11.7wt.%) in comparison with the commercial catalyst (29.8wt.%). Moreover, as can be seen in Fig. 3d, the amount of coke formation is significantly lower in case of Ni-UGS catalyst. In comparison with the alumina support of the Ni-based commercial catalyst used in this study, these results confirm the superiority of UGS oxides metallurgical waste in promoting the water gas shift reaction and the lower tendency to form carbonaceous deposits. The results will be discussed more in details in §3.4."
8,Ni-UGS catalyst stability,"3.3 Ni-UGS catalyst stability To assess stability of Ni-UGS, its catalytic performance was investigated during 48h on stream. According to Fig. 4 , time-indifferent results were obtained for glycerol conversion to gaseous products, hydrogen yield and gas product distribution. Generally, sintering and coke formation are the two main causes for catalyst deactivation in steam reforming processes. A relatively lower reforming temperature is required when oxygenates (e.g., glycerol and ethanol) are used as feedstocks instead of hydrocarbons which tends to delay sintering of metal particles. However, coke formation on the metal surface was found to occur in a much higher extent and it mostly deactivates the catalysts in the first hours on stream [18]. These results will be discussed in §3.5 where the phenomenon of coke formation on used Ni-UGS catalyst is examined."
9,Structural changes in reduced and used Ni-UGS catalyst,"3.4 Structural changes in reduced and used Ni-UGS catalyst To make sense of the nature of active centers of Ni-UGS and catalyst stability during GSR reaction, the changes in the crystal structure of catalyst after the mentioned pre-reduction step (reduced catalyst) and after 48h GSR reaction (used catalyst) were investigated by XRD (Fig. 5 ). Comparing the XRD patterns of fresh Ni-UGS (Fig. 5a) and reduced catalyst (Fig. 5b) shows that the intensity of the main peak at 2Ɵ=35.7° decreased as a result of reduction pre-treatment. This peak is the main line for NiFe2O4 (and/or a nickel iron mixed oxide (NixFe1-xO)), magnesium aluminum iron oxide (Mg(Alx Fe2-x)O4), and magnetite (Fe3O4) phases. Moreover, new peaks at 2Ɵ=43.92° and 51.24° appeared, which are attributed to the formation of Ni-Fe alloys (such as NiFe, FeNi3) (ICDD file No. 00-012-0736 and ICDD file No. 00-038-0419). Furthermore, the diffraction lines related to (MgO)1-x(FeO)x solid solution (2Ɵ=36.81°, 42.77°, 62.08°, 74.41°, 78.33° ICDD file No. 01-077-2365) were also detected in the reduced sample. It should be noted that (Ni,Mg)O solid solution (2Ɵ=37.12°, 43.14°, 62.63°, 75.09°, 79.09°) (ICDD file No.00-034-0410) is the predominant phase in the reduced Ni-UGS sample. According to XRD analyses, the obtained GSR results can be partly attributed to good dispersion of Ni particles owing to the presence of (Ni,Mg)O solid solution in the reduced catalyst. Moreover, as discussed in §3.2 (Eq. (3)), the presence of MgO can also help dehydrogenation of glycerol. Another feature of Ni-UGS is the presence of different magnesium and iron oxide species (such as (Ni,Mg)O, MgFe2O4, (MgO)(FeO) solid solution, and Fe3O4) in the crystal structure of the reduced catalyst, which can help water activation and promote water gas shift reaction. Generally, the metal surface is the principal active site for dehydrogenation or CC and CO bonds dissociation of oxygenates in steam reforming process. As a result, surface-bound protons, carbonyl groups, carbon and oxygen species can be formed on the surface of catalyst. Oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbon species by water, as steam-reforming oxidant, plays an important role in the selectivity and stability of catalyst [18]. Since activation of water on metal sites is relatively difficult, one of the approaches is the use of oxides with good basic and redox properties, which can help water activation and promote water gas shift reaction [18]. Magnesium oxide is known for its ability in heterolytic cleavage of water (Eq. (7)) [53]: (7) An associative mechanism for MgO and MgFe2O4 as WGS catalysts has been reported by Rethwisch and Dumesic [56]. Magnetite-based catalysts are also well-known for high-temperature WGS reaction, based on regenerative mechanism [56]. However, it has been reported that the use of alkaline or alkaline-earth metals as promoters with basic characteristics promotes associative mechanism in magnetite-based WGS catalysis. Boudjemaa et al. [57] reported high activity for hematite- (later in reaction, magnetite) supported MgO catalyst in high temperature shift reaction. By using in-situ DRIFT measurements, an associative mechanism was confirmed with formate intermediates produced by reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the Fe–MgO interface with the carbonyl species adsorbed on Fe. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, part of the Ni-UGS catalyst was reduced to Ni-Fe alloys after the pre-reduction step. Several authors reported a promoting effect of Fe in Ni-based steam reforming catalysts when Ni-Fe alloys are formed after reduction or during steam reforming reaction [25,40,41]. Ashoke et al. [40] reported that Fe species in Ni-Fe alloys presented in the reduced Ni/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalyst are partially oxidized to form intermediary FeO species endowed with good redox property. The redox behavior of Fe species enables them to switch easily between their oxidation states and increase the surface coverage of oxygen containing species. They enhance the steam reforming reaction and suppress coke formation. The main drawback of Ni-Fe alloys is the hydrogenating power of iron which favors the side reactions such as methanation (Eq. (8)) and reversed water gas shift (RWGS) (Eq. (9)) [58–60], resulting in low activity and low H2/CO ratio. (8) CO + 3H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H 298 r = − 206 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 (9) CO 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O Δ H 298 r = 41 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 However, Watanabe et al. [61] showed that FeNi3 highly dispersed over a reducible oxide support (mesoporous CeO2-ZrO2) with a good transfer rate of lattice oxygen, can effectively suppress methanation side reaction at high temperature WGS reaction. The high H2/CO ratio and low concentration of CH4 obtained with Ni-UGS catalyst (Fig. 3b and c) show that the contribution of WGS reaction overcomes methanation and RWGS reactions. Slight structural changes occurred for Ni-UGS catalyst during 48h on reaction. As can be seen in the XRD pattern of used catalyst (Fig. 5c), the reflections assigned to (Ni,Mg)O solid solution at 2Ɵ=43.14° and 62.7 became less pronounced. Moreover, the intensity of the lines related to Ni-Fe alloys at 2Ɵ=44.14° and 51.42° was amplified and new lines related to MgO phase at 2Ɵ=43.04° and 62.52° have appeared. A reflection line attributed to coke with graphite-like structure at 2Ɵ=26.1° was also detected (ICDD file No. 00-003-0401). TEM images (Fig. 6 ) and Digimizer image analysis software were used to evaluate the changes in morphology and size of Ni-UGS particles (Table 3 ) after 48h on GSR. As can be seen in Fig. 6 (a, b) and Table 3, the used Ni-UGS catalyst shows the same morphology as fresh Ni-UGS with a slight averaged size increase from around 23nm to 36nm, indicating the slow tendency of catalyst particle to sintering."
10,Coke formation on used Ni-UGS catalyst,"3.5 Coke formation on used Ni-UGS catalyst Carbon deposition, which is the main cause for catalyst deactivation in GSR process, was studied by TEM, TGA and BET analyzes of used Ni-UGS catalyst (after 48h on reaction). Fig. 6c shows the presence of tubular filaments of carbon with metallic nickel on the tip of the fibers in the TEM micrograph of used Ni-UGS. The presence of graphitic carbon is in agreement with XRD analysis (Fig. 5c). As can be seen in Table 2, formation of filamentous type carbon with high surface area caused an increase in the BET surface area of the used Ni-UGS (59.5m2 g−1) in comparison with that of fresh catalyst (10.3m2 g−1). The BET surface area practically retrieved its initial value (Table 2) after regeneration (§ 3.6), which led to carbon removal. Fig. 7 and Table 4 show the results of TGA-MS analysis of used Ni-UGS catalyst. The weight loss of 0.6wt.% observed in the range of 25–200°C can be attributed to water removal. The TGA profile (Fig. 7) outreaches the 100% and shows a mass gains of 2.6% in the range of 200–440°C due to the oxidation of reduced species (e.g., metallic nickel and iron or their alloys) formed during the reforming reaction. The CO2 evolved from the sample was detected by mass spectroscopy in the range of 440–600°C (Fig. 7), which is a result of the oxidation of carbonaceous deposits. Since the oxidation of reduced species interfered with coke burning during TGA in air (in the range of 440–600°C), an accurate quantification of the coke content is not possible based on Fig. 7. To estimate the rate of coke formation, a TGA analysis of the reduced Ni-UGS catalyst (after reduction pre-treatment and before GSR reaction) (Fig. 8 ) indicated that about 3.8% mass gain (Table 4) can be attributed to the oxidation of reduced species in the temperature range of 270–600°C. Comparing the amount of mass gain in the case of reduced Ni-UGS (3.8%) with that of used Ni-UGS (2.6%), one can estimate that actual mass loss due to CO2 emission is nearly 1.2% higher than the value detected in TGA of used Ni-UGS in the range of 440–600°C (12%). Accordingly, considering a weight loss of 13.2% due to gasification of carbonaceous deposits and 48h as time on stream, the average rate of coke formation on the Ni-UGS catalyst under tested GSR conditions is estimated to be as low as 2.7mgcoke gcat −1 h−1. Generally, encapsulating, filamentous (whiskers), and pyrolytic type carbon are the most common types of carbon deposition that can be formed during steam reforming of hydrocarbons on Ni catalysts [62]. Diffusion and subsequent nucleation of adsorbed carbon atoms through Ni crystal lead to the formation of filamentous carbon (typically at T>450°C) with Ni-crystal atop [62]. In such condition, Ni surface is still active and only part of nickel particles can be deactivated as a result of blockage by the growing of carbon filaments in the pores of catalyst [63]. If accumulation of adsorbed carbon atoms on the free Ni surface increases, filament growth is suppressed and the Ni particles can be entrapped within a carbon layer; however, entrapment of a metal particle can be inhibited provided sufficient superstoichiometric excess of steam. Hence, in comparison with encapsulating and pyrolytic types, carbon filamentous would not necessarily result in a loss of catalyst activity [62–64]. As has been confirmed by several authors, the presence of basic MgO in catalyst formulation can limit dehydration and polymerization reactions which lead to the formation of encapsulating type carbon and quick catalyst deactivation [19,65]. The enhanced steam adsorption in presence of basic material can also help the oxidation of carbonaceous deposits [66]. Considering the discussion above (§3.4), it can be concluded that the different magnesium oxide species (such as MgO, MgFe2O4, (Ni,Mg)O and (MgO)(FeO) solid solutions) present in the Ni-UGS catalyst can assist coke gasification by promoting steam activation. Sufficient excess of H2O/glycerol (S/C=3) ratio used in our tests can also help oxidative removal of carbonaceous deposits. Moreover, the formation of (Ni,Mg)O solid solution can stabilize nickel and prevent catalyst sintering [67]. Wang and Lu [68] reported a long-term stability and limited carbon formation by using Ni/MgO as catalyst for CO2 reforming of methane, which was attributed to a low sintering of nickel particles. These can justify the low rate of coke formation as estimated above and the stability of the Ni-UGS catalyst in the 48h GSR experiment."
11,Regeneration of used Ni-UGS catalyst,"3.6 Regeneration of used Ni-UGS catalyst An oxidative treatment was considered to investigate coke removal and possible recovery of pristine catalyst crystal structure. The used Ni-UGS catalyst was heated from room temperature up to 600°C with a rate of 10°C/min under air flow (40STDmLmin−1) and maintained at 600°C for 4h. The conditions were selected based on the results of TG-MS analysis of used Ni-UGS in air atmosphere (Fig. 7), where CO2 released by the burning of carbonaceous deposits terminates at 600°C. Fig. 9 shows the result of TG analysis of the regenerated Ni-UGS catalyst, carried out from ambient to 800°C under air flow. Almost no loss of weight (less than 0.7%) was detected in the TG/DTG curve, confirming a total carbon removal. The XRD analysis of the catalyst after regeneration (Fig. 5d) also shows no peak related to graphitic type carbon. Moreover, a comparison with the XRD results for the fresh Ni-UGS catalyst (Fig. 5a) shows a complete recovery of the initial crystalline phases upon oxidizing of Ni-UGS in air atmosphere at 600°C. According to Table 2, comparison of the BET surface area of regenerated Ni-UGS catalyst (7.9m2 g−1) with those of used (59.5m2 g−1) and fresh (10.3m2 g−1) ones reveals that the surface area practically retrieved its initial value due the removal of filamentous carbon with high surface area. Finally, the catalyst performance after regeneration was also evaluated. Fig. 10 shows the results of repeating GSR test for 4h using the regenerated catalyst after 48h on stream. Comparing with the results of fresh Ni-UGS, it can be seen that similar levels of performance can be achieved by using the regenerated Ni-UGS catalyst."
12,Conclusion,"A Ni-based catalyst (11.7wt.%) was prepared by Ni incorporation into Fe/Mg containing UGS oxides metallurgical waste and investigated in steam reforming of glycerol. In comparison with the Ni-based commercial steam reforming catalyst (29.8wt.% Ni), superior results were obtained in terms of glycerol conversion to gaseous products, H2 yield, and H2/CO molar ratio. Furthermore, the Ni-UGS catalyst showed a stable performance during 48h on stream, where only slight structural changes with low average rate of filamentous type coke formation (approximately 2.7mgcoke gcat −1 h−1) were detected on the used catalyst. A complete coke removal as well as the recovery of pristine crystalline phases were achieved by oxidative treatment of used catalyst in air atmosphere. These promising results were attributed to the synergy between (i) the ability of Ni for activation of CH, CC and OH bonds of glycerol, (ii) the good dispersion and stabilization of Ni particles through formation of (Ni,Mg)O solid solution, (iii) the potential of basic MgO, which is in close contact with Ni in the form of (Ni,Mg)O solid solution, to activate hydroxyl species of glycerol, (iv) the ability of different magnesium and iron oxide species (such as MgO, Fe3O4, MgFe2O4 and (MgO)(FeO) solid solution) existed in the Ni-UGS catalyst under selected GSR operating conditions, to activate steam and promote water gas shift reaction, and (v) the sufficient excess amount of water (S/C=3) used in GSR experiments. In conclusion, the results of this work clearly proved the capability of the Ni-UGS of acting as a powerful catalyst for GSR. A thorough parametric study and process optimisation will be the object of a forthcoming publication, to confirm the potential of this technology for industrial applications."
