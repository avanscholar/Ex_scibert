0,Introduction,"As an energy carrier, hydrogen has been attracting a great deal of attention for possible application in motorized vehicles or small stationary power units. Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) has been shown to be an interesting process for hydrogen production. The use of ethanol has environmental advantages, such as its natural availability from natural sources, besides its safe storage and handling [1]. Ethanol can be made renewably from several biomass sources, including energy plants, which grow by capturing the carbon dioxide from air, including that produced during fuel reforming or burning [2]. In the ESR, alcohol reacts with steam, producing CO2 and H2. Ethanol steam reforming can be represented by reaction (1). The water-gas shift reaction (WGSR – reaction (2)) occurs simultaneously. (1) C2H5OH+H2O⇆2CO+4H2 (2) CO+H2O⇆CO2 +H2 Co and Ni have been reported as active catalysts in ESR [3,4]. Haga et al. [5,6] reported that selectivity for H2 decreased in the order: Co>Ni>Rh>Pt. The authors described selectivity in the ESR as sensitive to structure and showed that the amount of CH4 produced decreases with increasing Co particle size. Metal catalysts supported on CeO2–ZrO2 have aroused interest in their activity, thermal stability and the existence of oxygen vacancies. Some studies [7,8] have shown that addition of zirconia to ceria improves its redox property, oxygen storage capacity and thermal stability, resulting in better performance in CO oxidation and methane combustion. The objective of this study was to investigate the properties of cobalt catalysts supported on CeO2–ZrO2 in relation to ethanol steam reforming, while varying the temperature and water/ethanol molar ratio."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of supports and catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of supports and catalysts The supports were made by the polymeric precursor (Pechini) method. Firstly, zirconium carbonate was stirred into a solution of ethylene glycol and citric acid (producing a translucent resin) [9]. Next, a cerium ammonium nitrate solution was added, to give the following final molar ratios of CeO2 to ZrO2: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1. After this procedure, the resin underwent curing, drying and calcination at 873K for 3h in air (30mLmin−1). The catalysts with 10wt% Co were prepared by impregnation of the support with Co(NO3)2·3H2O solution at 338K for 12h. The solid was dried in an oven at 333K for 12h and then calcined in air at 873K for 3h. From here on, the catalysts Co/Ce x Zr1−x O2 (0< x <1) are referred to as CoCZ and the supports as C, Z, 20CZ, 40CZ, 60CZ and 80CZ for ceria, zirconia, 20%ceria in zirconia, 40%ceria in zirconia, 60%ceria in zirconia and 80%ceria in zirconia, respectively. The catalysts, with a cobalt load of 10wt%, are named 10CoC, 10CoZ, 10Co20CZ, 10Co40CZ, 10Co60CZ and 10Co80CZ."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 Raman spectroscopy The Raman spectroscopy analyses were performed in a Dimensions – P2 Raman spectrometer from Lambda Solutions, Inc. The spectra were collected between 190 and 2000cm−1, using a laser of wavelength 785nm and a refrigerated CCD detector operating at 254K. 2.2.2 X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES-H2) X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Co K-edge were measured at the D06A – XAS beamline of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) in Campinas, Brazil. A Si (111) polychromator was used to select the X-ray beam from the synchrotron light produced by the 1.37GeV electron storage ring, at a maximum current of 200mA. The Co K-edge absorption spectra were recorded in the transmission mode, in a photon energy range from 7600 to 7900eV, using a CCD camera. The oxidized samples were heated in a TPR reaction chamber under H2 flowing at 30mLmin−1, from 298 to 923K at 10Kmin−1, and held at 923K for 30min. The XANES spectra at the Co K-edge were collected in situ throughout the temperature range. 2.2.3 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the ultraviolet near visible (DRS-UV–Vis) The DRS analyses were performed in a Varian Cary 5G UV–Vis NIR Spectrophotometer with a diffuse reflectance attachment. For DRS analysis, the samples were diluted with barium sulfate, in the proportion 1:1 by weight."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The catalytic tests were performed at atmospheric pressure, in a fixed-bed tubular quartz micro-reactor. The product composition was recorded over 6h of reaction time. Prior to the reaction, 150mg of the catalyst was introduced into the reactor and reduced in situ in flowing H2 (30mLmin−1) at 923K (10Kmin−1) for 1h, to activate the catalyst. Next, the sample was brought to the reaction temperature (673, 773 and 873K) under a flow of pure N2. The catalytic bed temperature was controlled with the aid of a thermocouple introduced close to the bed. The reaction was started in a hydrogen-free feed. The catalysts were tested in water:ethanol feeds of molar ratio 3:1, flowing at 2.5mLh−1, supplied by a piston pump. This mixture was vaporized in a preheating chamber (453K) before reaching the reactor. During the reaction, the liquid products were condensed in a cold trap kept at 273K. At the end of reaction, the condensed liquid products were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard 5890), with an HP-FFAP capillary column (25m×0.2mm i.d.) and FID detector. During the sample preparation, the solution was keep in a temperature lower than 283K, to avoid any liquid product evaporation. The gaseous products were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (VARIAN GC-3800) with two columns in parallel, each with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), with helium and nitrogen as carrier gases, operating in line with the reactor. The columns were packed with Porapak-N and 13× Molecular Sieve, respectively, operating between 313K and 353K, the carrier gas flowing at 10mLmin−1. The total ethanol conversion during the test was taken as the total volume of ethanol fed to the reactor minus the total volume of condensed ethanol, expressed as a percentage of the total fed volume. The selectivity (S i ) of each product (i =H2, CH4, CO2, CO or C2H4) was calculated by the following equation: (2′) S i = mol flow of i produced mol flow of ethanol converted"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Raman spectroscopy,"3.1 Raman spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the structures of the supports, and the spectra obtained are shown in Fig. 1 . In the C support spectrum, there is an intense band at 463cm−1. This band is attributed to the F2g mode of materials (such as CeO2) with the cubic fluorite structure [10,11]. The ZrO2 bands in the Z support spectrum, at 176, 380, 475 and 640cm−1, are typical of the monoclinic phase and bands at 266, 313, 470 and 640cm−1 are typical of the tetragonal phase. According to the literature [12], six Raman active modes (A1g +3Eg +2B1g) are expected for t-ZrO2, but only four bands were observed in the spectrum. Since Raman bands for monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia overlap, it is difficult to identify the individual crystal phases [13,14]. The insertion of Zr4+ into the CeO2 lattice leads to a shift of the band characteristic of cubic fluorite structure to higher frequencies and this peak becomes less pronounced at lower CeO2 content. Thus, for the sample 80CZ in Fig. 1, a single peak appears between 467 and 472cm−1, indicating the F2g mode for cubic CeO2. This shows that, when a small amount of ZrO2 is added to the CeO2 support, its cubic structure is retained. For the 60CZ, 40CZ and 20CZ supports, besides the band characteristic of the cubic fluorite structure, there are bands attributed to tetragonal structure, confirming a typical structure of ZrO2. Thus, it can be said that the supports with 40% or more of ZrO2 have a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases [12,15]. It is noteworthy that the F2g band in Raman spectra decreased in intensity with the addition of Zr, possibly on account of the increasing number of structural defects in the mesocrystal units on the introduction of Zr ions [15]. The Raman spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . For comparison, the Raman spectrum of Co3O4 is also included in this figure. The spectra show the four characteristic vibrational signals of Co3O4: a sharp, intense signal at 683cm−1, which can be assigned to the stretching vibration of Co–O in the spinel Co3O4 (A1g mode) [16,17], two weak bands at 612cm−1 and 510cm−1 corresponding to the F2g mode and a band at 475cm−1 corresponding to the Eg mode of the Co3O4 crystalline phases [17,18]. It is observed that the Co3O4 bands appear in the spectra of all catalysts; however, these bands are shifted to lower wave numbers. This shift in band positions can be explained by varying metal–support interactions [19]. Moreover, it is notable that the addition of cobalt oxide results in a dramatically decreased intensity of the Raman peak of the CeO2 support, which is caused by dispersion of cobalt oxide over the support."
7,X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES-H2),"3.2 X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES-H2) In order to follow changes in the oxidation states of the cobalt species during reduction with H2, X-ray absorption spectra were collected in situ in the XANES region at the Co K-edge (7709eV), from freshly calcined catalysts undergoing temperature – programmed reduction. The XANES method is often employed to identify the oxidation state and obtain qualitative information about the local geometry around the atoms of a selected element in a sample. Fig. 3 shows XANES spectra of cobalt reference compounds, CoO, Co3O4 and CoAl2O4, and cobalt foil (Co0) [3,20]. The oxidized reference compounds display a strong absorption white line, absent in elemental Co, with differing features due to the presence of cobalt atoms in distinct Co–O environments and oxidation states. The XANES spectra of the oxides also display a weak pre-edge feature (ca. 7710eV), arising from the 1s–3d absorption transition which is normally dipole-forbidden, but becomes allowed when the metal has tetrahedral coordination, appearing more strongly for tetrahedral than octahedral cobalt environments [21]. The intensity of the pre-edge feature is related to the symmetry and to the occupancy of the 3d shell [3]. CoO consists of Co2+ ions octahedrally coordinated to oxygen, whereas in Co3O4 there is a spinel type structure, with both tetrahedral Co2+ and octahedral Co3+ ions [22]. The white line, a sharp peak at an energy just above the K-edge, is due to the allowed 1s–4p transition. Fig. 4 shows XANES spectra obtained in situ during the reduction of the CoZ (A) and CoC40Z (B) catalysts with H2 at temperatures up to 923K. It is observed that the two catalysts possess similar reduction profiles, and this can be attributed to similar interactions between cobalt and the support in both catalysts. As seen in these results, the pre-edge feature appears at 7710eV. The main absorption edge is observed at ca. 7725–7730eV, with characteristics that are very similar to those of the standard Co3O4 XANES spectrum. This result is close to those reported by Profeti et al. [3] and Jacobs et al. [23]. The transformations from Co3O4, present in the catalysts initially, to CoO, are obvious when the catalysts’ spectra are compared with those of the reference compounds (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows that the reduction of cobalt species begins close to 673K, where a modest increase in the intensity of the white line is observed. This feature can be assigned to the conversion of Co3+ to Co2+ in the first reduction Co3O4 →CoO. As the temperature is increased, the white line intensity diminishes and the spectrum assumes a profile more like that of Co foil (reduction CoO→Co0), close to 773K, and at 873K the complete reduction of cobalt oxides is seen in all catalysts."
8,Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis NIR),"3.3 Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis NIR) Figs. 5 and 6 show the UV–Vis spectra of the supports and catalysts, respectively. The supports have bands in the ultraviolet region, while the catalysts, besides bands in the ultraviolet region, have bands in the visible region. Fig. 5 shows that the spectrum for support ZrO2 features two absorption bands in two nearby regions, at 230 and 260nm (dotted lines). These two bands are expected for this sample, in which the predominant phase is monoclinic ZrO2 [24]. These two absorption bands correspond to interband transitions in monoclinic ZrO2 and they are not observed in the mixed oxide supports. However, CeO2 shows three strong absorption bands at 234, 277 and 301nm (solid lines). These three bands are present in both the pure oxide and the mixed oxide spectra, with different intensities, and are attributed to charge-transfer transitions of the O–Ce type, involving a number of Ce4+ ion species with different coordination numbers [24]. The bands at 234 and 277nm in the UV–Vis spectrum of CeO2 are assigned to low-coordination charge-transfer transitions of Ce3+ ←O2− and Ce4+ ←O2−, respectively. The absorption band at 301nm is attributed to the interband transition of CeO2. Fig. 6 shows the UV–Vis spectra of the catalysts. The bands marked with solid vertical lines correspond to the CeO2 absorption band, and those marked with dashed lines to ZrO2 absorption while the bands marked with dotted lines correspond to absorption by cobalt ions. Similar profiles are observed in the non-Co-related bands of the catalysts and their respective supports, which are located at the same wavelengths, but for the catalyst CoZ a higher intensity can be seen in the longest wavelength band, referring to interband transitions in monoclinic ZrO2. Moreover, there is a small reduction in the intensity of these bands in the catalysts, probably due to the addition of cobalt metal to the supports. The dotted lines at 457 and 750nm represent the absorption bands of cobalt, due to the formation of Co3O4. The bands become more intense with increasing surface area of the catalysts. These two bands show the formation of the spinel structure of Co3O4, represented by Co2+Co2 3+O4 2−, which contains Co(II) and Co(III) in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination, respectively [25,26]."
9,Catalytic tests,"3.4 Catalytic tests Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 7 show the mean selectivity of gaseous products formed on the catalysts in 6h on stream in the ESR reactions. It is observed that at lower temperatures (673–773K), there was a greater selectivity for CO2 than for CO, suggesting that the WGSR was favored (reaction (2)). Highest ratios of CO2/CO are seen on all catalysts at 773K, this being an ideal condition for the WGSR. On the catalyst CoC (Table 1), there is little formation of CO, CO2 or CH4 at 673K compared to 873K, which may be due to the low capacity of metallic cobalt to break the CC link of the ethanol molecule at lower temperatures, interfering with the formation of one-carbon products [27]. Marked differences in the ratio of CO and CO2 can be observed between catalysts Co80CZ and CoC (Table 1). The addition of zirconium to the supports (Co80CZ, Co60CZ, Co40CZ and Co20CZ catalysts) may lead to greater formation of CO2 at 673–773K. This component increases the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the redox capacity of the support for oxidation reactions such as the direct oxidation of CO to CO2 by the WGSR [7,8]. Another factor that may favor the formation of CO2 is the basicity and capacity of the support for partial oxidation reactions in the presence of excess H2 [28]. In addition to this, the high activity of the cobalt itself for the WGSR should also cause this catalyst to produce greater quantities of CO2 [29,30]. It should be noted that the catalyst Co40CZ, at 773K had the highest selectivity for CO2 relative to CO, under these conditions. Increasing the temperature to 873K leads to the lowest CO2/CO ratio, indicating that the WGSR is unfavored at high temperatures, since it is exothermic. This behavior was observed on all catalysts. On the catalysts Co80CZ, Co60CZ and Co40CZ (Fig. 7) at 873K, the large increase in CO and decrease in CH4 and CO2 indicate that methane steam reforming and dry reforming (reactions (3) and (4), respectively) and the reverse WGSR are major reactions. The enhanced H2 production may also be due to the CH4 reforming reactions and not the forward water-gas shift reaction [7,31]. (3) CH4 +H2O⇆CO+3H2 (4) CH4 +CO2 ⇆2CO+2H2 For catalysts Co20CZ and CoZ (Table 2 and Fig. 7), a great difference in selectivity difference is observed for CH4 between the temperatures of 673K and 873K. The decrease in CH4 at 873K is accompanied by an increase in CO selectivity. This may be due to enhancement of the steam or dry reforming of CH4 at the higher temperature. The increased oxygen mobility in the supports with higher ZrO2 content enhanced the oxidation reaction activity, but not sufficiently to convert the CO to CO2."
10,Conclusions,"It has been demonstrated that the Pechini method for preparing the supports was efficient in forming solid solutions and that incorporating Zr4+ into the crystal lattice of CeO2 leads to structural changes in the oxides with higher ZrO2 contents. The catalytic tests on CoCZ showed that ethanol conversion and H2 selectivity were temperature dependent, and highest at 873K. However, this high temperature did not favor the WGSR, as evidenced by the low formation of CO2 at this temperature. The association of CeO2 with ZrO2 may also promote low formation of CO, due to the higher mobility of oxygen. In sum, the systems CoCZ under study are promising as catalysts for steam reforming of ethanol at a temperature of 873K."
