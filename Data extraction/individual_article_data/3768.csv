0,Introduction,"In the nowadays world, the consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels has generated series of environmental concerns, and then seriously influenced on human life. Therefore, the development of the alternative energy sources has already become very urgent [1–5]. In recent years, hydrogen energy, due to the characteristics of cleaning and non-pollution, will play a key role in the energy structure [6,7]. Because the solar-light and water are abundant and free in the earth, the solar-light photocatalytic splitting water for hydrogen production will be a best choice. Since the pioneers, Fujishima and Honda, reported on photoelectrochemical splitting water on TiO2 electrode, there have been increasing semiconductor materials for photocatalytic splitting water to produce hydrogen investigated by many researchers in the world [8–12]. Especially, many inorganic oxide materials, owing to its low energy consumption in preparation, large surface area and high adsorption, have caught people's interests. In these materials, the tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) due to its outstanding performance has been utilized in photocatalytic hydrogen production field [13–18]. Particularly, Ta2O5 has wide band-gap (Ebg =3.90eV) [19,20], enough hydrogen production power and high photocatalysis velocity, so it displays a fairly high photocatalytic efficiency in hydrogen production under corresponding ultraviolet-light irradiation. Nevertheless, owing to so wide band-gap, the Ta2O5 only can be activated by ultraviolet-light which accounts for about 4.0% in solar-light [21,22]. Recently, concerning this issue, some rare earth compounds with up-conversion luminescent function, which can generate one high-energy photon by absorbing two or more low-energy photons, have been applied in photocatalytic reaction to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of wide band-gap semiconductor materials [23–26]. In previous work, we reported that the use of Er3+:Y3Al5O12 as up-conversion luminescence agent could dramatically enhance the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of TiO2. Therefore, in this work, we adopted the wide band-gap Ta2O5 to combine with a new up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Ta2O5. In this designed catalytic system, Er3+:YAlO3 can effectively transform visible-lights into ultraviolet-lights to satisfy the energy requirement for wide band-gap Ta2O5. Obviously, it may increase the utilization ratio for solar energy. In addition, in previous researches the direct mixing method was employed to prepare the Er3+:Y3Al5O12/Pt-TiO2 as visible-light photocatalyst [27]. It may well relatively decrease the active surface of TiO2 particles and then lose the hydrogen production ability. So, in the present work we selected the sol-gel method to prepare a coated Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite as visible-light photocatalyst, which would efficiently carry out the photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting. Furthermore, as well known, the photogenerated electrons and holes in semiconductor photocatalyst have a high recombination rate, which may greatly decrease the catalytic activity. Fortunately, recent researches manifested that the co-catalyst could play a significant role in dealing with this problem. According to previous study, depositing Pt on the surface of Ta2O5 particles can restrict the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Ta2O5 [28]. However, Pt is a rare and noble metal, so its large-scale applications are limited. Apparently, it is necessary to find some appropriate co-catalysts to replace Pt. They also can effectively restrict the electron-hole recombination to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of Ta2O5. Recently, the graphene, due to the superior electro-conductivity, special surface, high adsorption and two-dimensional nature, was considered to be an effective substance to restrict the electron-hole recombination in traditional semiconductor photocatalysts [29–31]. The graphene can act as an electron-transfer bridge and quickly transfer electrons from conduction band (CB) to other places. Thus, the graphene as co-catalyst has been applied in photocatalytic hydrogen production [32–34], while the reports on the combination of graphene with Ta2O5 are still very few [35]. In this work, we selected the graphene to combine with Ta2O5 through a certain design technology, which employed the good conductivity of graphene, fastly transferring the electrons from conduction (CB) band of Ta2O5 to the surface of graphene and reducing the H+ to produce H2. In addition, in order to further improve the photocatalytic activity of Ta2O5, the MoSe2 was also added into co-catalyst system. MoS2 is an excellent traditional co-catalyst and can vastly enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of some common photocatalysts. Compared to MoS2, MoSe2 has much lower electric potential and higher electrical conductivity as well as the coverage rate of hydrogen on the edge [36,37]. So, the MoSe2 as co-catalyst can not only more effectively resist the photogenerated electron-hole recombination, but act as the active sites reducing H+ to produce hydrogen (H2). And that, it has already been proved that the MoSe2 can be used for photocatalytic hydrogen production [38–40]. Hence, in this study, we prepared the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite on sheet MoSe2-reduced graphene oxide (MoSe2-rGO) for further enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Ta2O5. In this work, the synthesis of Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent by using sol-gel process and preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 visible-light photocatalyst by using sol-hydrothermal and calcination methods were reported. The composition, morphologies and photocatalytic performance of the prepared samples were investigated and the mechanism of visible-light photocatalytic splitting methanol/water to produce hydrogen was also proposed. The experimental results showed that the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of Ta2O5 could be significantly enhanced in the presence of Er3+:YAlO3 and MoSe2/rGO under visible-light irradiation. It is wished that this study would provide some valuable strategies for photocatalytic hydrogen production using solar energy in the future."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Erbium oxide (Er2O3, 99.999% purity), Yttrium oxide (Y2O3, 99.999% purity) and Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, analytical reagent), citric acid (C6H8O7, analytical reagent) and nitric acid (HNO3, 65%, analytical reagent) (Veking Company, China) were used to synthesize the up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3). Tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5, 99.99%, analytical reagent) and absolute ethanol (CH3CH2OH, analytical reagent) (Veking Company, China) were used to prepare the Ta2O5. Hydrazine hydrate (H4N2·xH2O, analytical reagent), Sodium molybdate dehydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O, analytical reagent), Selenium powder (Se, analytical reagent) and Graphene oxide (Veking Company, China) were used to prepare the co-catalyst (MoSe2/rGO). Double distilled water (Millipore Corporation, USA) was buffered with methanol (CH3OH, analytical reagent, Veking Company, China), which was used to act as sacrificial agent. All chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts 2.2.1 Synthesis of Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent According to the previous reports, the Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent was synthesized by sol-gel and calcination methods [23,24]. Firstly, by dissolving stoichiometric Y2O3 (5.4562g) and Er2O3 (0.0938g) into 50mL hot HNO3 solution (about 60°C) the Y(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 mixed solutions were prepared. Al(NO3)3·9H2O (9.1000g) powder was mixed with the prepared Y(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 solutions under magnetically stirring at room temperature. After stirring for 30min, the homogenous solution of Y(NO3)3, Er(NO3)3 and Al(NO3)3 was obtained. The solid citric acid powder was added in batches into the above mixture solution according to 3:1mol ratio of citric acid and metal ions (Y3+, Er3+ and Al3+). The mixture solution was further magnetically stirred and then heated at 50–60°C until the transparent sol successfully formed. The transparent sol was heated at 80°C for 24.0h until became the gel. After being naturally cooled to room temperature in the air, the gel was adequately ground into fine homogeneous powders. Subsequently, for completely removing the residual organic components and nitrate ions the homogeneous powders were calcined at 1100°C for 2.0h. The sintered substance was taken out of the muffle furnace and allowed to cool down to the room temperature in atmosphere. At last, the desired white Er3+:YAlO3 powder as up-conversion luminescence agent was obtained after fully grinding. 2.2.2 Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite as photocatalyst The Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite was prepared by sol-gel process. At first, the transparent TaCl5 solution was obtained by dissolving the required amount of TaCl5 in absolute alcohol, then adding the Er3+:YAlO3. The citric acid as chelating agent of Ta5+ ions, in which the molar ratio of Ta5+ ions to citric acid was 1:2, was dissolved in a suitable amount of ethanol-water solution (with a volume ratio of CH3OH:H2O=9:1). The obtained citric acid solution was slowly mixed with the TaCl5 solution. Then, a reasonable quantity of polyethylene glycol as crosslinker was added. After continuously stirring for 2.0h, the highly transparent sol formed, which was heated at 80°C in a water bath to obtain the corresponding gel. Afterwards, the transparent gel was dried at 110°C for 12.0h. After fully grinding the obtained powders were calcined at 500°C for 5.0h in air. Finally, the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite as photocatalyst was obtained. 2.2.3 Preparation of MoSe2/rGO as co-catalyst The MoSe2/rGO was prepared by hydrothermal method. 1.0mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O was dissolved in 50mL distilled water and then 0.0134g graphene oxide (5.0wt% in MoSe2/rGO) was added under ultrasonic irradiation at room temperature until forming a homogeneous solution. In another flask, 2.0mmol Se powder was disperse in 10mL hydrazine hydrate (H4N2·xH2O) solution. Immediately, the color of obtained solution transformed from colorlessness to dark brown and kept invariability at least for one day. Then the obtained solution was added to Na2MoO4 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) solution. Then the color of mixture changed into orange-red. The mixture was transferred to a 100mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200°C for 10.0h. After cooled to room temperature naturally, the black sediments were gathered by centrifugation, which were washed with redistilled water and ethyl alcohol at least four times. Finally, the obtained substance was annealed at 200°C in vacuum atmosphere for 12.0h to obtain the final products. 2.2.4 Preparation of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 as visible-light photocatalyst Er3+:YalO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 as visible-light photocatalyst was prepared through the sol-hydrothermal and calcination methods. The Er3+:YalO3/Ta2O5 coated composite and MoSe2/rGO powders, whose mass ratios of Er3+:YalO3/Ta2O5 and MoSe2/rGO were adopted as 100:0.00, 99.75:0.25, 99.50:0.50, 99.25:0.75 and 99.00:1.00 were added into a 200mL beaker filled with 20mL redistilled water, dispersed by ultrasound (80kHz frequency and 50W output power) for 35min. Then, the 10mL C2H5OH was added to the suspension, stirring for 30min. The mixture was transferred to a 50mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200°C for 12.0h. After cooled to room temperature naturally, the sediments were washed with redistilled water for three times. Finally, the obtained substance was dried at 120°C in the vacuum atmosphere to attain the final products."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The Er3+:YAlO3, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5, MoSe2/rGO and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D-8, Bruker-axs, Germany) using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation in the range of 2θ from 10° to 70°, scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-5610LV, Hitachi Corporation, Japan), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100, Hitachi Corporation, Japan), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, JEOL JSM-5610LV, Hitachi Corporation, Japan), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, XSAM800, Shimadzu-Kratos, Japan), Raman spectrum (JY HR800, Horiba, Japan) and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, UV-3600, SHIMADZU, Japan). The UV–vis absorption spectrometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan) and photoluminescence spectrometer (RF-5301PC, Shimadzu, Japan) were used to measure the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent."
5,Visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments,"2.4 Visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments The experiments of photocatalytic splitting methanol/water for hydrogen production were carried out in 500mL Pyrex reactor. The headspace of the reactor was connected with an inverted beret to measure the produced hydrogen gas (H2), which was filled with methanol-water (10wt%) solution at atmospheric pressure. In the reactions of photocatalytic splitting methanol/water for hydrogen production, a needed amount of photocatalysts (300mg) were dispersed in methanol-water (10wt%) solution under continuously stirring. After purging the suspensions by argon flow for 30min at least to wipe out dissolved air, the suspensions were irradiated for 5.0h using 300W xenon lamp (Microsolar 300, Beijing perfect light science and technology Ltd., China). The used irradiation wavelengths were controlled by a combination of cold mirror (CM-1) and water filter (350nm<λ<800nm). For visible-light irradiation, a cut filter (L42) was fitted to the aforementioned light source (400<λ<800nm). The produced hydrogen gas (H2) was confirmed by gas chromatograph (GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar Carrier, Shimadzu, Japan)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Materials characterization,"3.1 Materials characterization Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Er3+:YAlO3, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5, MoSe2/rGO and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2. From the Fig. 1(a), it can be found that the characteristic diffraction peaks of 2θ=18.15°, 33.50°, 41.50°, 46.62° and 55.12° are similar with the standard YAlO3 card (JCPDS-70.1677). It proves that the Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent has been successfully synthesized. Fig. 1(b) displays the XRD patterns of MoSe2/rGO hybrid and the main peaks can be indexed with the standard diffraction data of MoSe2 nanosheets (JCPDS-00-05101426). And that, the diffraction peak of 2θ=26.52° can prove the existence of rGO. As shown in Fig. 1(c and d), they are very similar with the XRD patterns of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Ta2O5 are hardly to find in the XRD patterns and the characteristic diffraction peaks of Er3+:YAlO3 such as 2θ=18.15°, 33.50°, 41.50°, 46.62° and 55.12° are present. Thus, it can prove that the Ta2O5 mainly exits in the amorphous to form and well prepared [41]. And the characteristic diffraction peaks of MoSe2/rGO are difficult to find, since the amount of MoSe2/rGO in the compounds is too low. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Er3+:YAlO3, MoSe2/rGO and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2. As clearly shown in Fig. 2(a), the synthesized Er3+:YAlO3 presents the spherical particles with 50–70nm size. Fig. 2(b) displays that the MoSe2 particles are dispersed on the rGO and the particle size is about 50nm. Apparently, the particle size becomes much smaller after fully dispersed on the rGO. In Fig. 2(c), it can be found that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 exists on the rGO and the minimum particles are MoSe2. This could demonstrate that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 nanocomposite is successfully prepared. The existence of Er3+:YAlO3 in the internal of Ta2O5 particles could be further proved by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) can be used to know the detailed structure and composition of samples. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of prepared MoSe2/rGO and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 with two magnification ratios (unit lengths corresponding to 100nm and 20nm). As shown in Fig. 3(a), the sheet rGO as a support is abundantly decorated with MoSe2 particles, which is concluded that the MoSe2 particles are well dispersed on the rGO. As presented in Fig. 3(b), the darker parts are Er3+:YAlO3 particles coated into the Ta2O5 and the rGO attached with MoSe2 with smaller particle size are also dispersed on the Ta2O5. After the magnification ratio is further enlarged to scale of 20nm, as seen in Fig. 3(c), the structure of samples becomes much more distinct. It can be also seen that the MoSe2 particles as co-catalysts are indeed dispersed randomly on the surface of rGO, resulting in intimate contact with Ta2O5, which is beneficial to transfer the photogenerated electron from the CB of Ta2O5. Besides, the presence of deep-colored up-conversion luminescence agent (Er3+:YAlO3) particles can also be seen clearly. Also, it can be confirmed that the Er3+:YAlO3 nanoparticles have been coated with Ta2O5 particles through the sol-gel method. The TEM results indicate that the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 part forms a coated (core-shell) structure. The EDX spectra of prepared samples are all shown in Fig. 4 . As displayed in Fig. 4(a), the results of EDX give the peaks of Er, Y, Al and O elements, which demonstrate that the up-conversion luminescence agent, Er3+:YAlO3, is composed of Er, Y, Al and O elements. Besides, the atomic ratio of synthesized Er3+:YAlO3 up-conversion luminescence agent is similar with that given in the Fig. 4(a). From Fig. 4(b) it can be seen that the co-catalyst is composed of C, Mo, and Se elements, basically being similar with the atomic ratio of prepared MoSe2/rGO. In addition, as can be seen in Fig. 4(c), the prepared photocatalyst contains Er3+:YAlO3, Ta2O5 and MoSe2/rGO. The ratio of each material in the photocatalyst is similar with the precursor solution. Elementary composition and valence bond structure of the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 is characterized by XPS, as is shown in Fig. 5 . It indicates that the nanocomposite contains Er, Y, Al, Ta, Mo, Se, C and O elements and the corresponding peaks are plotted carefully. From Fig. 5(o), it can be seen the fully XPS scanned spectra of the prepared Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2. Specifically, the Fig. 5(a) shows the peak of Er (4d) positioned at 167.3eV which is assigned to the Er (4d5/2), demonstrating that the valence of Er is three. The Fig. 5(b) displays the Y (3d) with peaks of 156.4eV (3d5/2) and 159.4eV (3d3/2), demonstrating that the valence of Y is also three. In Fig. 5(c) the peak at 74.35eV assigned to the Al (2p), demonstrating that the valence of Al is three. Furthermore, according to Fig. 5(h), the peak of 532.7eV is the O (1s), indicating that the valence of O is two. So the Fig. 5(a, b, c and h) prove that the up-conversion luminescence agent Er3+:YAlO3 has been synthesized. The Fig. 5(d) shows the characteristic peaks of Ta (24.5eV (4f7/2) and 26.5eV (4f5/2)), demonstrating that the valence of Ta is five. The Fig. 5(e–g) shows the XPS of Mo, Se and C in co-catalyst MoSe2/rGO. Fig. 5(e and f) shows the characteristic peaks of Mo4+ (229.5eV (3d5/2) and 230.8eV (3d3/2)) and Se2+ (60.6eV (3d5/2) and 61.6eV (3d3/2)). And then, the characteristic peaks at 284.6eV assigned to the C (1s) proves the reduction of GO to graphene. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for evaluating the structural properties of grapheme. In order to confirm the existence of rGO, the special D band (k point phonons of A1g symmetric vibrational mode) and G band (E2g vibrational mode of sp2 bonded carbon atoms) of rGO were detected by Raman spectroscopy. In Fig. 6 , the Raman spectrum of the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 exhibits two prominent peaks at 1393cm−1 and 1621cm−1, attributing to the typical D and G bands of rGO, respectively. In addition, it is also displayed that two main peaks appear at 721cm−1 and 848cm−1, corresponding to the vibration spectrum of Ta2O5. The coupled mode indicates that the bands at 721cm−1 and 848cm−1 mainly involve the stretching vibration of various Ta-O-Ta bonds [42,43]. Based on the above considerations, it can be confirmed that rGO and Ta2O5 exist in Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 composites. The optical diffuse absorption spectrum of prepared Ta2O5 was measured by UV–vis absorption spectra at ambient temperature in the range of wavelength from 200 to 800nm. Fig. 7(a) shows that Ta2O5 has intense absorption in near ultraviolet region, and the intense absorption edge of Ta2O5 is at approximately 200–320nm. Based on the optical diffuse absorption spectra of prepared Ta2O5, the corresponding band-gap was calculated as the following equation: αhν = A hν − E g 1 / 2 where α, h, ν, Eg and A represent absorption coefficient, plank constant (h=6.626169×10−34 J·s), light frequency, band-gap and a constant, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the calculated band-gap (Eg) of the as-prepared Ta2O5 is 4.02eV. The calculated band-gap is very close to those in literature references [44,45]."
8,UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent,"3.2 UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent In order to examine the up-conversion luminescence property of Er3+:YAlO3, the ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured, respectively, and the results were all displayed in Fig. 8 . From the Fig. 8(a), it can be obviously found that some typical absorption peaks located at 400–700nm in visible-light region. It indicates that the synthesized Er3+:YAlO3 is able to absorb the visible-lights. In the photoluminescence spectra of Er3+:YAlO3, when the 452nm and 651nm in visible-light region were adopted as excitation wavelengths, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8(b and c) some emission peaks can conspicuously be found in the ultraviolet-light region (200–360nm). There are many absorption peaks for Er3+:YAlO3 in visible-light region displayed in Fig. 8(a), which herald that the solar-light with continuous spectrum can fully utilized as illumination source. In this work, we just randomly choose the wavelengths (453nm and 652nm) of two absorption peaks as excitation wavelengths. Thus, it can be proved that the synthesized Er3+:YAlO3 can emit the high-energy ultraviolet-lights after absorbing low-energy visible-lights. The ultraviolet-light generated from Er3+:YAlO3 can activate the wide band-gap Ta2O5 to effectively perform the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction."
9,Activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 in visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.3 Activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 in visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production The activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 in visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production was examined through the amount of hydrogen production at different irradiation times and the results were displayed in Fig. 9 . In order to demonstrate the photocatalytic activity enhancement of Ta2O5 caused by Er3+:YAlO3 and MoSe2/rGO, the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activities of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 and Ta2O5 were also investigated. For Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 systems, it can be found that, along with the extension of visible-light irradiation time, the hydrogen yields increase gradually. While for pure Ta2O5 no hydrogen can be detected even under visible-light irradiation, because the Ta2O5 can only be activated by ultraviolet-light due to its relatively wide band-gap (Eg =3.90eV). It can be considered that, because of possessing up-conversion luminescence effect from visible-light to ultraviolet-light, Er3+:YAlO3 can provide more high-energy ultraviolet-lights to stimulate Ta2O5 to successfully carry out the photocatalytic hydrogen production. For Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 and Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5, it can be found that their hydrogen production amounts both increase, but the former is much more than the latter at any visible-light irradiation time. It is because that, after adding such co-catalyst, MoSe2/rGO, the photo-generated electrons in CB of Ta2O5 can easily and fastly inject onto rGO surface due to the super-high electrical conductivity (ultrahigh electron mobility >1000cm2·V−1·s−1) [35]. And then, these electrons are accepted by MoSe2 particles acting as the active sites loaded on the rGO for effective hydrogen production. That is, the rGO as an electron-transporting bridge efficiently restrains the recombination of photo-generated electrons and photo-generated holes, which is significant for photocatalytic splitting water to produce hydrogen gas (H2)."
10,The effect of solution acidity (pH) on visible-infrared light photocatalytic hydrogen production of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2,"3.4 The effect of solution acidity (pH) on visible-infrared light photocatalytic hydrogen production of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 The effect of solution acidity (pH) on photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting was studied in the pH=4.0–10.0 range under visible-light irradiation. Obviously, from Fig. 10 , it can be seen that the pH values closely influence the hydrogen production efficiency. When the pH value of the methanol aqueous solution increases from pH=4.00 to pH=6.00, the amount of hydrogen production goes up and the maximum amount of hydrogen production is achieved at pH=6.00. And then, it begins to decrease along with further increasing pH values. It can draw a conclusion that weak acidic condition is more suitable for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 from water splitting when the methanol is used as electron donor, whereas strong acidic or alkaline conditions are both unfavorable. Of course, the influence of pH value on photocatalytic hydrogen production is very complicated. At least, in strong acidic solution (pH<pI (isoionic point)) the hydrogen ions (H+) cannot get close to the positively charged surface of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 nanocomposite and are difficult to be reduced for generating H2. Conversely, in strong alkaline solution the insufficient hydrogen ions (H+) inhibit the photocatalytic hydrogen production."
11,Influence of MoSe2/rGO amount on visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite,"3.5 Influence of MoSe2/rGO amount on visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite The mass ratios of Ta2O5 and MoSe2/rGO can also influence the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2. Thus, in this study, a series of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 composited with various mass ratios (99.75:0.25, 99.50:0.50, 99.25:0.75 and 99.00:1.00) were tested compared to Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 coated composite without MoSe2/rGO under visible-light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 11 , the amount of hydrogen production increases with the content of MoSe2/rGO rising (from 99.75:0.25 mass ratio to 99.25:0.75 mass ratio). After achieving a maximum value at mass ratio of 99.25:0.75, the amount of hydrogen production slightly decreases with further adding the MoSe2/rGO. Apparently, adding appropriate amount of MoSe2/rGO as co-catalyst is benefit for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5. Nevertheless, along with further increasing the amount of the black MoSe2/rGO, the opacity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 photocatalyst also increases significantly. It reduces the light-admitting quality of the Ta2O5, leading to the decrease of up-conversion luminescence efficiency of Er3+:YAlO3, which must cause the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 to be reduced."
12,The stability of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 for photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.6 The stability of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 for photocatalytic hydrogen production The recycle number of catalysts is an important point for evaluating catalytic efficiency in practical applications. To confirm the reusability of the obtained photocatalyst, five circulating run experiments were examined for Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation (as shown in Fig. 12 ). In Fig. 12, it can be found that there is no significant decrease in the hydrogen production after every five hours. That is, the hydrogen production has only a slight decrease as the used times increase. Over all, the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 nanocomposite can be effectively recycled for five repetitive cycles without an apparent deactivation in its visible-light photocatalytic activity, which demonstrates its great potential as an efficient and reusable photocatalytic material."
13,Possible visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2,"3.7 Possible visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 The previous researches have proved that the Er3+ doped YAlO3 (Er3+:YAlO3) as up-conversion luminescence agent can effectively emit high-energy ultraviolet-light in the region of 220–350nm pumped by 540–545nm and 648–652nm wavelengths of visible-lights [24–27], respectively. Some research teams have also investigated the up-conversion luminescent characteristics of Er3+:YAlO3 and also discussed the related mechanisms in detail [46,47]. When the Er3+:YAlO3 are stimulated by 485nm and 543nm wavelengths of visible-lights, two up-conversion luminescent signals can be found at 319nm and 321nm in the region of ultraviolet-light, respectively. In addition, when the wavelengths of excitation lights are controlled at 653nm and 658nm, the signals of 326–342nm and 354–359nm in the region of ultraviolet-light can also be observed, respectively. In general, the up-conversion luminescent phenomenon of Er3+ ion in YAlO3 environment excited by F9/2 has been confirmed to be attributed to ETU and ESA processes [48,49]. According to the energy level data of Er3+ ion [50], the ultraviolet emissions at 326–342nm and 354–359nm belong to the transitions from 2H9/2 to 4I13/2 and 4D5/2 to 4I11/2, respectively. Apparently, it can be considered that the up-conversion luminescent process may take place easily in Er3+:YAlO3 crystals, if the visible-lights (400–800nm) in solar-light with continuous spectrum are employed as excitation source. Fig. 13 illustrates the possible mechanism on the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from methanol aqueous solution caused by Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 photocatalyst. On the basis of up-conversion luminescence feature of Er3+:YAlO3, a tentative process on visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution caused by Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 photocatalyst was put forward. For Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 system, the Ta2O5 with 3.90eV band-gap can be activated by enough high energy of lights (ultraviolet-lights) generated from Er3+:YAlO3 as up-conversion luminescence agent through absorbing the low-energy visible-lights in solar-light and emitting the high-energy ultraviolet-lights. As shown in Fig. 13, under the irradiation of such ultraviolet-light emitted by Er3+:YAlO3, the electrons in the valence-band (VB) of Ta2O5 leap into the conduction-band (CB), creating photogenerated-electrons in the CB and photogenerated-holes in the VB, respectively, at the same time. The previous researches reported that the CB electrons of Ta2O5 can be transferred to the surface of rGO sheets with high electrical conductivity [35,36]. Then, these photogenerated-electrons in the rGO can be accepted by MoSe2 nanoparticles as the active sites for hydrogen production [51,52]. That is, due to the presence of rGO sheets acting as electron-transporting bridge the photogenerated-electrons transfer from the CB of Ta2O5 to MoSe2 nanoparticles, and then the electrons can well reduce the H+ ions around the MoSe2 particles to produce hydrogen gas (H2) [53]. However, the situation that rGO may traps free radicals should also be considered [54–56]. These free radicals trapped by rGO tend to react with electrons, resulting in a decrease of hydrogen production capacity. Nevertheless, due to the presence of MoSe2, the electrons can be transferred rapidly from rGO and react with H+ ions. Therefore, the free radicals are hardly captured by rGO, since the electrons on rGO are consumed. In addition, due to the high activity, the free radicals can oxidize fleetly methanol molecules and then be consumed. Simultaneously, the photogenerated-holes with highly oxidability on VB of Ta2O5 can also oxidize the methanol molecules as sacrificial agent, producing methanals or methanoic acids. Understandably, the oxidation reaction happened on the Ta2O5 with high positive potential (3.6eV) of VB is reasonably conducive to the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution."
14,Conclusions,"In summary, an effective up-conversion luminescence agent (from visible-light to ultraviolet-light), Er3+:YAlO3 which is coated by Ta2O5 through sol-gel method, and an excellent co-catalyst, MoSe2/rGO, were successfully synthesized, respectively. And then, the Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 and MoSe2/rGO were combined and a novel visible-light photocatalyst, Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2, was prepared for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production. The visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Ta2O5 by splitting methanol aqueous solution could be immensely enhanced by adding Er3+:YAlO3 and MoSe2/rGO. Also, the mass ratio of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5 and MoSe2/rGO can obviously influence the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2. The Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 with 0.75wt% MoSe2/rGO displays a highest visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity at pH=6.00 in methanol aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. The Er3+:YAlO3/Ta2O5/rGO/MoSe2 nanocomposite also exhibits excellent recyclability and sustainability in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiment. Perhaps, this study provides an enlightened strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production using solar energy in the future."
