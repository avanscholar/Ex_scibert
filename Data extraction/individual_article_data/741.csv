0,Introduction,"Increasing energy supply is required for sustainable economic and social development. Global energy consumption in 2018 had an average growth rate of 2.3%, which was nearly twice the growth since 2010, and fossil fuels accounted for 70% of the increase [1]. In this case, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions grew by 1.7% to a historic high of 33.1 Gt, resulting in a precarious lower-carbon energy future [1]. Thus, it is urgent to develop renewable energy alternatives. Hydrogen is considered as an effective and eco-friendly energy carrier [2]. Compared with other alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, and tidal energy, hydrogen possesses a high energy yield of 142 kJ/g with easy storage and transportation [3,4]. Additionally, hydrogen is recognised as a carbon-free energy, whose combustion yields only water. Currently, most hydrogen is produced from non-renewable energy sources, including natural gas, oil, and coal [5,6]. Statistics show that natural gas-derived hydrogen accounts for approximately 50% of the global hydrogen production, while oil/naphtha reforming and coal gasification account for approximately 30% and 18%, respectively [7]. The heavy dependence on fossil fuel also results in adverse environmental problems, such as air pollution, acid precipitation, and climate change [3]. In contrast, the clean and sustainable biological hydrogen production via dark fermentation has increasingly aroused public interest and concern because of its high hydrogen production rate, good energy saving, simple reactor construction, and potential environmental benefit [8,9]. In this process, energy stored in biomass and organic wastes can be effectively recycled by employing a variety of microorganisms at relatively low temperatures of 35–65 °C and ambient pressure under an anaerobic environment [10]. Biomass-based materials such as lignocellulosic biomass and algae blooms are abundant worldwide, which also provide reliable low-cost substrates for fermentation. Therefore, dark fermentation supplies dual benefits of biomass waste treatment and renewable energy generation. However, due to the compact crystalline structures of lignocellulosic biomass and the recalcitrant cell wall of algae biomass, the degradation of intracellular organic matters including carbohydrates and proteins is severely restricted during hydrogen fermentation [11]. Xia et al. reported that algae without pre-treatment achieved relatively low hydrogen yields of 7.1–33.8 mL/g volatile solids (VS), corresponding to 4.1%–17.7% of the stoichiometric yield [12]. Bundhoo et al. also found that milled corncob and cornstalk without pre-treatment gave the low hydrogen yields of 13.1 and 22.1 mL/g VS, respectively [13]. Thermo-chemical catalytic hydrolysis achieved by adding dilute acids and alkalis prior to hydrogen fermentation is considered as a particularly effective method to enhance the biological accessibility of fermentative microorganisms to intracellular organic matters [11,14]. High-molecular-weight compounds such as polysaccharide and protein can be hydrolysed to fermentable reducing sugars such as xylose and glucose and amino acids such as glycine and glutamic acid. Previous studies found that the hydrolysis of rice residue (140 °C, 10 min, 0.5% (v/v) H2SO4) and Chlorella pyrenoidosa (140 °C, 10 min, 1% (v/v) H2SO4) achieved high reducing sugar yields of 924.9 and 187.3 mg/g VS [15], and the corresponding saccharification efficiencies reached up to 100% and 54%, respectively. Additionally, microwave-assisted acid pre-treatment was also demonstrated to be effective for hydrolysing water hyacinth, resulting in a high saccharification efficiency of 94.6% under 140 °C for 15 min with the addition of 2% H2SO4 (v/v) [16]. While thermo-chemical pre-treatment can effectively facilitate depolymerisation of polysaccharide and protein, a large quantity of toxic hydrolytic by-products would be generated [17], which strongly inhibit hydrogen fermentation. Increasing the pre-treatment temperatures or adding acid/alkali catalysts can promote direct thermal decomposition of monosaccharide to generate furan derivatives such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) [16]. The amino group in amino acids would also react with the carbonyl group in sugars (named as Maillard reaction) under the thermo-chemical environment [18], and furan derivatives are the typical intermediate products for the Maillard reaction. Additionally, the produced nitrogen-containing compounds and high-molecular-weight polymers such as melanoidins are degraded difficultly, thus influencing microbial activity and overall metabolic pathways [10]. As previously mentioned, furfural derived from carbohydrate decomposition and the Maillard reaction is one of the major hydrolytic by-products. Table 1 shows the comparison of furfural inhibition on hydrogen fermentation. Furfural can decrease the glycolysis enzyme activities, suppress the microbial cell growth, and even cause DNA mutations [19]. Lin et al. reported that furfural with a concentration of 15 mM (1.44 g/L) could obviously prolong the fermentation lag-phase time [20]. Quéméneur et al. found that the maximum decrease of hydrogen yield could reach up to 69.5% when using xylose-based medium with furfural addition [21]. Siqueira et al. analysed the impacts of hydrolysis by-products on the kinetic parameters of fermentation according to the modified Gompertz model, and the concentration of furfural that reduced 50% of the maximum hydrogen production rate was calculated as 0.62 g/L [22]. Besides, synergistic inhibitory effects were also exhibited in the introduction of combinations of inhibitors to the medium and in the hydrolysates with concentrated inhibitors [23]; the presence of furan derivatives in these hydrolysates would potentialize the phenolic compounds toxicity, thereby hindering the growth of microorganisms and decreasing the hydrogen yields. The detoxification of furfural is regarded as a transformation process to low toxic compounds (such as furfuralcohol and furoic acid) through the synergistic effects of different microorganisms. Furfural addition could increase the abundance of the class Actinobacteria [27]. Additionally, the enteric bacteria, Clostridium spp., and Lactobacillus spp. also had the ability to degrade furfural [24]. Notably, our previous studies concluded that furfural with the concentration of 1–4 g/L could be completely degraded within 48 h of hydrogen fermentation, while the furfuralcohol concentration in the effluents reached up to 0.7–3.6 g/L after 96 h of hydrogen fermentation [25]. Recent studies mainly focused on the direct inhibitory effects of furfural on hydrogen fermentation, while the functional consequences of the typical furfural intermediate degradation products including furfuralcohol and furoic acid have been rarely studied. These furfural derivatives may result in good reciprocal effects on metabolism, or may still exhibit strong antagonistic actions for fermentative enzymes and microorganisms. The detoxification of furfural is closely related to the microbial community structure and function. However, little research has studied the microbial community succession during the degradation of such furfural derivatives in hydrogen fermentation. The main inhibition stage as well as the rate-limiting process for the aldehyde-alcohol-acid transformation are still unclear. In this study, the inhibitory effects of typical intermediate degradation products of furfural including furfuralcohol and furoic acid on fermentation were analysed by the discrepancy factor between the experimental and theoretical hydrogen production, as well as the inhibition coefficient that considering the fermentation lag-phase time, whole fermentation period, and hydrogen yield. To fill the gap in the state of art, the transformation characteristics of furan compounds and the corresponding rate-limiting step were evaluated. Furthermore, the microbial synergy in detoxification of furfural derivatives was studied via the changes of species richness and diversity, as well as the microbial community succession. The deviations in the chemical oxygen demand balance and the energy conversion characteristics caused by adding furfural and its derivatives were also comparatively assessed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inocula,"2.1 Inocula The hydrogen producing bacteria (HPB) was obtained and acclimatised based on the previous studies [25]. Total solid (TS) of activated HPB was 112.8 g/kg fresh weight, and the VS content was 59.8%."
3,Hydrogen fermentation,"2.2 Hydrogen fermentation Hydrogen fermentation was conducted in the glass fermenters under batch conditions. Each fermenter with an effective working volume of 300 mL was inoculated with 30 mL of activated HPB. Glucose with a concentration of 10 g/L was used as feedstock, and 2 g/L yeast extract was used as a nitrogen source [20]. Furfural, furfuralcohol, and furoic acid were separately added to each fermenter at the concentrations of 1–6 g/L, to analyse the degradation and transformation characteristics of typical intermediate degradation products of furfural during hydrogen fermentation. The pH values were adjusted to 6.5 ± 0.1 at the beginning of the test [28]. Nitrogen was bubbled through the fermenters to ensure an anaerobic environment. The fermenters were placed at 37 ± 0.5 °C for 96 h, and the pH values during hydrogen fermentation were also adjusted to 6.5 ± 0.1 for a time interval of 12 h. A blank group only containing inocula, a control group only containing glucose (10 g/L) and yeast (2 g/L), and the other control groups only adding furfural or its derivatives (4 g/L for each) were operated under the same experimental processes."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The contents of TS, VS, ash, and moisture were determined by the Standard Methods 2540 G [29]. The glucose concentration was measured by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method [30]. Besides, the contents of C, H, N, and S in yeast extract were measured by an elemental analyser on Elementar Vario MACRO cube equipment; the content of O was calculated according to the remaining content of VS in yeast extract [25]. A gas chromatograph (Thermo Trace 1300, USA) with a thermal conductivity detector was used to measure the contents and composition of hydrogen and carbon dioxide [28]. Another gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B, USA) coupled with a flame ionisation detector was used to determine the concentrations of the soluble metabolic products (SMPs) [25,28], including ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid. Furfural and its derivatives were measured by a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (Thermo Trace 1300/Thermo ISQ QD, USA) [25]. After hydrogen fermentation, the sludge from the control group (only containing glucose) and the sludge with the addition of 2 and 6 g/L furfural and its derivatives were collected for the analysis of microbial community structure. The genomic DNA was firstly extracted via the PowerSoil@DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). The V3-V4 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified by the bacterial primer sequences of 338F and 806R, respectively. Illumina HiSeq 2500 was used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and raw sequences were assembled, screened, and trimmed. The sequences from the clone libraries were calculated as different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Alpha diversity analysis was used to assess the species richness and diversity for individual sample [31]. Four measure indexes, i.e., the Chao-1 estimator [32], abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) [32], Shannon index estimator [33], and Simpson index estimator [31,33], were statistically analysed at a similarity level of 97% by using Mothur software. The coverage of OTU was also statistically analysed."
5,Calculation,"2.4 Calculation The hydrogen yield (mL/gglucose) was calculated using the ratio of final cumulative hydrogen production volume (mL) to the weight of glucose addition (g). The final cumulative hydrogen production volume was determined according to the hydrogen contents both in the gas collector and fermenter headspace as well as the volume of total produced gases at each time interval [34]. The values were normalised to a standard pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 0 °C. The kinetic parameters of hydrogen fermentation, i.e., the cumulative production (H, mL/gglucose), maximum production potential (H m , mL/gglucose), peak rate (R m , mL/gglucose/h), peak time (T m , h), and lag-phase time (λ, h), were calculated based on a modified Gompertz equation by an Origin software [35], as shown in Eq. (1). Previous studies found that fermentative inhibitors may have slight impacts on the cumulative hydrogen production [25]. However, they could significantly prolong the fermentation lag-phase time, resulting in the delay of production peak time. Thus, conducting the assessment on important kinetic parameters via the modified Gompertz model is more helpful to study on the comprehensive influences of fermentative inhibitors [36]. (1) H = H m exp { − exp [ R m e H m ( λ − t ) + 1 ] } The inhibition coefficient (IC, %) was calculated based on a previous study [25], as shown in Eq. (2), where APR90% represents the average hydrogen production rate reached by total produced hydrogen up to 90% of final cumulative production. This parameter also reflects the functional consequences of furfural and its derivatives on the fermentation lag-phase time, whole fermentation period, and hydrogen yield. (2) Inhibition coefficient ( % ) = ( 1 − APR 90 % from glucose with furfural or its derivatives addition APR 90 % from glucose ) × 100 % The hydrogen discrepancy factor (HDF, %) was determined as the difference between experimental and theoretical hydrogen production [37], as shown in Eq. (3), where H 2 Exp and H 2 T represent experimental and theoretical hydrogen production, respectively. This parameter could be used to assess the transformation of microbial metabolic pathways caused by the addition of furfural and its derivatives, as well as the subsequent effects on the relationships of SMPs and hydrogen. The relationships of SMPs and hydrogen production were calculated by the following stoichiometric equations, as shown in Eqs. (4)–(10). In this case, the theoretical hydrogen production was based on Eq. (4) [37], where H 2 A and H 2 B represent theoretical hydrogen production via the acetic acid (Eq. (5)) and butyric acid pathways (Eq. (6)), respectively. Besides, H 2 E , H 2 P , H 2 V , and H 2 C represent theoretical hydrogen consumption via the ethanol (Eq. (7)), propionic acid (Eq. (8)), valeric acid (Eq. (9)), and caproic acid (Eq. (10)) pathways, respectively.

(11) [25,38], where CODdistribution represents the total COD values (mg/L) of the formed products (i.e., SMPs and hydrogen) and residual organic matters (i.e., residual sugars, furfural, and its derivatives). Besides, CODinitial represents the total COD values (mg/L) of substrates (i.e., glucose and yeast extract), furfural, and its derivatives added to fermentation. The COD equivalent values of glucose, yeast extract, furfural, furfuralcohol, and furoic acid were determined as 1.07, 1.38, 1.67, 1.8, and 1.29 g COD/g, respectively [25]. The COD equivalent values of hydrogen and SMPs including ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid were determined as 16, 96, 64, 112, 160, 208, and 256 g COD/mol, respectively [25]. (11) COD balance ( % ) = ( ∑ COD distribution COD initial − 1 ) × 100 % The energy conversion efficiency (ECE) was calculated based on Eq. (12) [28]. The higher heating values of glucose (16.1 kJ/g), yeast extract (16.3 kJ/g), furfural (22.8 kJ/g), furfuralcohol (24.9 kJ/g), and furoic acid (18 kJ/g) were determined based on the Mendeleev formula, as shown in Eq. (13), where C, H, O, and S represent the corresponding VS contents of each element in organic matters. The higher heating values of hydrogen and SMPs including ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid were determined as 286, 1367, 874, 1527, 2184, 2837, and 3492 kJ/mol, respectively [39]. (12) ECE ( % ) = Total energy values ( kJ ) of produced hydrogen and SMPs Total energy values ( kJ ) of initial orginic matters × 100 % (13) Heating value ( kJ/g ) = 0.33858 C + 1.254 H − 0.10868 ( O − S )"

7,Effects of furfural and its derivatives on hydrogen fermentation,"3.1 Effects of furfural and its derivatives on hydrogen fermentation 3.1.1 Biohydrogen production 3.1.1.1 Furfural addition As shown in Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. 1(b), the maximum hydrogen yield from glucose without adding furfural was 267.1 mL/gglucose, and the hydrogen production peak rate was 16.1 mL/gglucose/h. With increasing furfural concentration from 1 to 2 g/L, the maximum hydrogen yield decreased from 248.1 to 209.4 mL/gglucose, whereas the hydrogen production peak rate decreased from 15.1 to 9.6 mL/gglucose/h. Previous studies found that the reductive power of microorganisms for converting hydrion to hydrogen would be obviously reduced due to excessive consumption of reductive coenzyme NADH during furfural degradation [40] (detailed can be found in Section 3.2.1). Additionally, the activities of glycolysis enzymes and the growth of microbial cells would be restrained in the presence of furfural [20]. Furfural with the concentration of 4 g/L greatly prolonged the fermentation lag-phase time. However, the hydrogenogens could be revived within 36 h of fermentation, resulting in the maximum hydrogen yield of 209.9 mL/gglucose and production peak rate of 8.7 mL/gglucose/h. Further increasing the furfural concentration to 6 g/L completely inhibited hydrogen fermentation, and only a small amount of hydrogen (2.2 mL/gglucose) was produced. In general, the inhibition thresholds for microorganisms were obviously different, due to the changes in culture conditions such as pH values, feedstock types, and fermentation types [25]. The tolerance of furfural also had a wide variability for the mixed culture with complex microbial community structures [25]. Haroun et al. found that the maximum hydrogen yield decreased by 62% with the addition of 4 g/L furfural [41], whereas Siqueira et al. reported that no hydrogen was detected at a furfural concentration of 2 g/L [22]. 3.1.1.2 Furfuralcohol addition Fig. 1(c) and (d) display the effects of furfuralcohol on hydrogen fermentation. In the control group, the maximum hydrogen yield and production peak rate from glucose were 279.4 mL/gglucose and 16.9 mL/gglucose/h, respectively. Compared with furfural, furfuralcohol (1–4 g/L) had slight impacts on hydrogen production, which were neither synergistic effects nor antagonistic actions. The achieved maximum hydrogen yield was in the range of 269.4–274.5 mL/gglucose, and the hydrogen production peak rate was in the range of 15.4–16.2 mL/gglucose/h. Nevertheless, furfuralcohol with a high concentration of 6 g/L led to a relatively low hydrogen yield of 232.2 mL/gglucose, and the hydrogen production peak rate also decreased to 12.8 mL/gglucose/h. This indicated that furfuralcohol was still not an ideal substrate. Nicolaou et al. found that most of furan compounds could be metabolised to their less toxic alcoholic forms [42]. Based on our study, fermentative bacteria exhibited strong adaptability and high tolerance to these alcohol intermediate metabolites such as furfuralcohol. These results demonstrated that furfuralcohol may have no adverse effects on activities of key enzymes involved in glycolysis. Additionally, the further transformation of furfuralcohol may no longer be the reductive degradation, and this provides efficient NADH depending reductases for hydrogen production. Taherzadeh et al. reported that furfural (4 g/L) still hindered the bacterial growth and limited the fermentation performance, despite conversion to the less inhibitory furfuralcohol [43]. Therefore, the furfural inhibition of hydrogen production mainly occurred in the aldehyde-alcohol transformation. Such inhibition was irreversible, and did not totally disappear after the completion of aldehyde-alcohol transformation. 3.1.1.3 Furoic acid addition In terms of hydrogen fermentation with furoic acid addition (see Fig. 1(e) and (f)), the maximum hydrogen yield and production peak rate from glucose in the control group were 261.3 mL/gglucose and 24.3 mL/gglucose/h, respectively. Furoic acid with the concentration of 1–6 g/L enhanced the cumulative hydrogen yield (ranging from 277.1 to 301.1 mL/gglucose), suggesting that hydrogen may be produced by converting furoic acid to alcohols or volatile fatty acids. Nevertheless, the hydrogen production peak rate decreased to 9.0–19.7 mL/gglucose/h. The higher concentration of furoic acid conversely resulted in a lower hydrogen production peak rate. Furoic acid with a low molecular weight easily diffused into the microbial cell membrane compared with glucose. In this case, at the early stage of fermentation (approximately 6–12 h), most hydrogen was produced by the utilisation of furoic acid. The low hydrogen production peak rate achieved from furoic acid addition indirectly confirmed that the amount of hydrogen produced by glucose was higher than furoic acid under the same fermentation period. Muñoz-Páez et al. found that the complete furfural detoxification and presence of furoic acid could produce additional hydrogen [24]. Klinke et al. studied the inhibition of furoic acid on ethanol fermentation from xylose; the ethanol yield was 102%–106% relative to the reference when furoic acid was added [44]. These results indicated that furoic acid indeed enhanced the relevant metabolic effects of target product formation. Guarnieri et al. found that furfural conversion primarily proceeded via non-specific dehydrogenase activity to the furfuralcohol intermediate [45], as previously discussed. However, the catabolism of furfural into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle could be also achieved through using furoic acid as a common intermediate, while such process mainly occurred under an aerobic environment [45,46]. Based on these, the oxidation of furan compounds and alcohol derivatives would not consume the reductive power supplied by glycolysis, resulting in slight impact on hydrogen production (see Section 3.1.1.2). It should be noted that the conversion proceeds via furoic acid was shown to be a bottleneck for the furfural metabolism [45]. Additionally, hydrogen fermentation also could not provide an efficient aerobic environment, which probably limited this alcohol-acid transformation of furfural. 3.1.1.4 Mono fermentation of furfural and its derivatives Hydrogen fermentation using furfural and its derivatives (4 g/L) as the sole feedstock is shown in Fig. 1S. No hydrogen was detected during furfural degradation in the absence of glucose, and the cumulative SMPs concentration was 3.2 mM. Haroun et al. also only observed acetic acid and butyric acid accumulation with no hydrogen production when 2 g/L of furfural was used as the sole carbon source for fermentation [41]. This result was consistent with our study. A small amount of hydrogen was produced when only using furfuralcohol (1.7 mL/g VS) and furoic acid (2.7 mL/g VS). The SMPs concentration increased to 19.2–26.6 mM, which was dominated by acetic acid (9.9–13.7 mM) and butyric acid (6.7–9.7 mM). These results demonstrated the existence of positive co-metabolism action between glucose and furoic acid. Such a process should contain hydrogen-producing pathways. Si et al. concluded that furfuralcohol could be degraded to furoic acid by Desulfovibrio sp. in methane fermentation [47]. Based on this, hydrogen also could be produced from furfuralcohol. Nevertheless, furfuralcohol had less of an effect on the hydrogen fermentation in the presence of glucose (see Fig. 1(c) and (d)). As previously discussed, the above alcohol-acid transformation was obviously hindered, due to the lack of key enzymes and microorganisms [25]. Overall, furfural exhibited stronger inhibition than its derivatives on hydrogen fermentation. 3.1.2 Kinetic parameters, inhibition coefficient, and hydrogen discrepancy factor Table 2 shows the kinetic parameters of hydrogen fermentation. With the high fitting coefficients ranging from 0.9949 to 0.9999, the change trends of hydrogen production potential (H m ) and peak rate (R m ) obtained from furfural, furfuralcohol, and furoic acid accorded with the experimental data. Besides, as the concentration of furfural or its derivatives increased, the prolonged effects of fermentation lag-phase time (λ) and peak time (T m ) was enhanced. IC (see Eq. (2)) was used to assess the inhibitory effects of these compounds on the hydrogen yield and production peak rate, as well as the fermentation lag-phase time and peak time [25]. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), when furfural concentration increased from 1 to 6 g/L, the ICs increased from 7.1% to 99.8%. This was mainly attributed to low hydrogen yield and long fermentation lag-phase time. In contrast, furfuralcohol has very slightly adverse impacts on fermentation (see Fig. 1), resulting in the low ICs ranging from 1.8% to 16.9%. When adding 1–2 g/L furoic acid to fermentation, the ICs were calculated as negative numbers (around −6.0%). Due to the easy transmembrane transport of furoic acid, hydrogen could be produced under a short fermentation period. Thus, the high hydrogen yield achieved from the non-obvious fermentation lag-phase time ultimately led to the negative ICs. Further increasing the furoic acid concentration to 4–6 g/L resulted in the higher ICs ranging from 28.1% to 42.4%. Furoic acid was more easily degraded by microorganisms to produce hydrogen than glucose. Although hydrogen yield was enhanced with increasing furoic acid concentration (see Fig. 1), the whole fermentation period was prolonged due to the delay of glucose degradation, thereby causing relatively higher ICs. Bakonyi et al. reported that the HDFs derived from hydrogen fermentation using glucose as feedstock were 2.2%–6.8% [37], which were similar to the control groups in this study (1.2%–5.1%). As shown in Fig. 2(b), furfuralcohol exhibited the lowest HDFs ranging from 0.4% to 23.8%. When furfural was added to fermentation, the HDFs significantly increased to 4.1%–86.5%. The large differences in the theoretical and experimental data demonstrated that hydrogen production with furfural addition was hindered during the degradation of glucose to SMPs. Moreover, the HDFs from furoic acid were 2.9%–33.5%. The HDF was calculated by the glucose degradation, see Eqs. (3)–(10). Note that the production of acetic acid was promoted with furoic acid addition (see Table 3 ), and this process could be possibly determined by Eq. (14). (14) C 5 H 4 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + CO 2 + H 2 Based on this, the theoretical hydrogen production obtained from degrading glucose to acetic acid (2 mol H2/mol acetic acid) was much higher than that from furoic acid (0.5 mol H2/mol acetic acid). This was the main reason why the HDFs increased with the increase of furoic acid concentration. 3.1.3 Production of soluble metabolites As shown in Table 3, the addition of furfural and its derivatives had no adverse effects on glycometabolism. The high glucose utilisation efficiencies ranging from 98.4% to 99.6% illustrated that most feedstock was effectively degraded by the fermentative microorganisms (except for the addition of 6 g/L furfural). In the control groups, the cumulative SMPs concentrations were 67.9–74.4 mM. As acetic acid (29.6–34.2 mM) and butyric acid (33.3–35.9 mM) were identified as the dominant SMPs, fermentative microorganisms preferred the acetic acid and butyric acid metabolic pathways [20]. Besides, the corresponding molar ratios of acetic acid to butyric acid were 0.89–0.95. When furfural (1–4 g/L) or furfuralcohol (1–6 g/L) was added to fermentation, similar cumulative SMPs concentrations and acetic/butyric acid molar ratios were achieved, indicating that these compounds could not obviously change the microbial metabolic pathways [25]. In contrast, the completely restricted hydrogen fermentation with the addition of 6 g/L furfural resulted in the lowest glucose utilisation efficiency of 44%, and the cumulative SMPs concentration was only 9.8 mM. Compared with the control group, when furoic acid was added to fermentation at the concentrations of 1–6 g/L, the cumulative SMPs concentration increased from 71.0 to 112.5 mM. More acetic acid was produced in such a process (ranging from 35.5 to 61.6 mM), leading to higher acetic/butyric acid molar ratios ranging from 1.12 to 1.43. According to the high hydrogen yield achieved from furoic acid addition (see Fig. 1), the conversion of furoic acid to acetic acid could be a hydrogen-producing pathway, as previously discussed. If all furoic acid was used to produce acetic acid by microorganisms, the resulting hydrogen yield and acetic acid concentration would outclass the observed data. Therefore, most furoic acid was still degraded via the non-hydrogen-producing pathways."
8,Transformation characteristics of furfural and its derivatives,"3.2 Transformation characteristics of furfural and its derivatives 3.2.1 Aldehyde-alcohol transformation Fig. 3 displays the transformation characteristics of furfural and its derivatives during hydrogen fermentation. As shown in Fig. 3(a), when adding furfural to fermentation at the concentrations of 1–2 g/L, it was completely degraded within 6 h of fermentation. Reducing sugars such as fructose and glucose could be used as the regenerators of reducing power in furfural degradation, thereby effectively decreasing the degradation period [25,48]. Gutiérrez et al. also found that the degradation efficiency of furfural (below 0.5 g/L) could reach up to 100% within 4 h of fermentation [48]. Increasing the furfural concentration would obviously prolong the degradation period. When the initial concentration achieved 6 g/L, 53.3% of furfural still remained in the effluents even after 96 h of fermentation. Furfural degradation was regarded as an aldehyde-alcohol transformation process [47]. The effluents eventually contained 0.37–1.93 g/L furfuralcohol, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Ask et al. demonstrated that the intracellular NADH level at the stable stage obviously decreased from 0.48 to 0.2 μmol/g dry weight with the addition of furfural and 5-HMF [40]. Reductive coenzyme NADH would be generated through converting glucose to SMPs [12]. Generally, the generated NADH was used to produce hydrogen [12,20], as shown in Eq. (15). But inevitably, the reductive degradation of furfural would simultaneously decrease the intracellular level of NADH to produce less toxic furfuralcohol, as shown in Eq. (16). Furfural could also inhibit the energy metabolism by inhibition of the enzymes alcohol and pyruvate as well as aldehyde dehydrogenase [42]. Therefore, the excessive depletion of cofactor pools and the inhibition of key enzymes during the detoxification of furfural directly resulted in a low hydrogen yield. This result was consistent with previous discussion. (15) NADH + H + → NAD + + H 2 (16) C 4 H 3 OCHO + 2 NADH → C 4 H 3 OCH 2 OH + 2 NAD + 3.2.2 Alcohol-acid transformation Furfuralcohol exhibited a lower microbial degradation rate than furfural. When 1–6 g/L furfuralcohol was used as an inhibitor, approximately 49%–70% of furfuralcohol remained unconverted after 96 h of fermentation, as shown in Fig. 3(c). However, as the unconverted furfuralcohol had low toxicity to microorganisms [25], the obtained hydrogen yield and production peak rate were similar to the control group (see Fig. 1). In contrast, furoic acid could be rapidly and effectively utilised during fermentation. It was observed that the degradation of furoic acid (1–6 g/L) was terminated within 24 h of fermentation, as shown in Fig. 3(d). Overall, the alcohol-acid transformation of furfural was limited in fermentation. Improving the microbial conversion processes of furfuralcohol to furoic acid is an effective approach to enhance hydrogen production."
9,Microbial community succession,"3.3 Microbial community succession 3.3.1 Species richness and diversity Table 4 shows the changes of species richness and diversity during fermentation. The high OTU coverage ranging from 0.9987 to 0.9995 corresponded to a high probability detection of species, and the sequencing results could represent the actual situation for microorganisms in all samples. With increased concentrations of furfural and its derivatives, the numbers of OTUs decreased, resulting in decreases in microbial populations. The relatively low Chao-1 and ACE estimators further demonstrated the reduction of species richness [32]. Additionally, these samples with low Shannon estimators and high Simpson estimators corresponded to the decline of species diversity [31,33]. The addition of furfural and its derivatives limited the bioactivity of microorganisms and suppressed microbial growth. This process was regarded as targeted screening, and a portion of microorganisms that were unable to adapt to adverse environments were eliminated. 3.3.2 Genus-level classification of microbial populations As shown in Fig. 4 , two notable hydrogen-producing genera of Clostridium (15.6%–32.1%) and Ruminococcaceae (0.7%–26.5%), which are gram-positive, anaerobic, and able to form spores [27,49], were dominant populations during fermentation in all samples. A number of Caproiciproducens (0.7%–12.8%) were also detected among the microbial communities. However, there was no significant difference in the concentration of caproic acid from the samples with different genus abundances. The main metabolic products of Caproiciproducens, besides containing caproic acid, also contained acetic acid and butyric acid [50]. Some Clostridium bacteria, such as Clostridium kluyveri, and some Ruminococcaceae bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae bacterium CPB6, could also produce caproic acid [51,52]. Previous studies reported that most furfural-degrading microorganisms belong to the aerobic gram-negative bacteria [27,53]. In this study, the high furfural concentration of 6 g/L significantly increased the relative abundances of Enterococcus and a portion of the Clostridium genus. Wee et al. [54] and Muñoz-Páez et al. [24] found that enteric bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis and some Clostridium spp. were able to convert furfural to less toxic compounds, such as furfuralcohol and furoic acid. Even so, the enteric bacteria could not use furfural as their sole carbon source and energy. The microbial transformation of furfural was achieved by co-metabolism with glucose and yeast extract as the main feedstocks [55]. Although furfural could be degraded by the enteric bacteria under an anaerobic or aerobic environment in a short incubation time [55], this co-metabolism effect was limited when adding excessive furfural (6 g/L), resulting in a low hydrogen yield. Desulfovibrio sp. are reported to be notable bacteria that degrade furfural to acetic acid in anaerobic methane fermentation [27]. However, these bacteria were not detected in this study. The changes of microbial communities derived from furfuralcohol addition were not significant compared with furfural during fermentation. However, adding a high concentration of furfuralcohol (6 g/L) reduced the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Macellibacteroides, and this phenomenon was also observed when adding a high concentration (6 g/L) of furfural and furoic acid. Bacteroides and Macellibacteroides belong to the hydrolytic microorganisms, which are capable of hydrolysing proteins and polysaccharides to amino acids and monosaccharides [56]. Thus, the utilisation of nitrogen sources (i.e., yeast extract in this study) could be hindered to some extent, due to the lack of these two bacteria. This would suppress microbial growth and then lead to obvious decreases in species richness and diversity (see Table 4). The relative abundance of Haloimpatiens increased with increasing furoic acid concentration. Haloimpatiens is an anaerobic gram-positive microorganism, and its main metabolic end products are ethanol and acetic acid during fermentation using glucose and peptone as feedstocks [57]. According to previous studies, adding furoic acid enhanced acetic acid production. Haloimpatiens may promote the transformation of furoic acid to acetic acid by co-metabolism in the presence of glucose."
10,Chemical oxygen demand balance,"3.4 Chemical oxygen demand balance Table 5 shows the distribution of COD during fermentation. In the control groups, the COD was mainly distributed in hydrogen (13.9%–14.9%), SMPs (57.7%–64.1%), and residue sugars (0.28%–0.48%), resulting in the COD balances ranging from −27.9% to −20.5%. COD balance was a primary result of COD losses due to unmeasured metabolites and COD consumption of microbial growth [25]. Among these, organic matters used for microbial growth accounted for around 10%–15% of the initial COD input [25,38]. When separately adding furfural, furfuralcohol, and furoic acid to hydrogen fermentation, the COD balances were −42.7% to −31.8%, −27.9% to −25.1%, and −37.3% to −32.7%, respectively. A further analysis showed the changes of COD balances for each group were not significant (except for 6 g/L furfural), confirming that the metabolic pathways with the addition of furfural and its derivatives only demonstrated slight variation. Even so, more metabolites remained unmeasured in the effluents compared with the control group. The high organic matters contained in the residue inhibitors of furfural and furfuralcohol suggested a poor degradation of these two compounds."
11,Energy conversion efficiency,"3.5 Energy conversion efficiency Fig. 5 shows the total ECEs during hydrogen fermentation. In the control groups, the total ECEs were in the range of 71.9%–79.1%. To be specific, energy contained in hydrogen only accounted for 17.2%–18.4%, whereas energy contained in SMPs accounted for 56.1%–60.7%. Significant energy remained in fermentation effluents. Further utilisation and purification of SMPs for energy recovery or downstream biochemical production is beneficial in large-scale industrial application [58,59]. When adding 1–6 g/L furfural to fermentation, total ECEs decreased from 63.1% to 6.0%. The strong inhibitory effects of furfural on hydrogen and SMPs production resulted in the obvious decline of total ECEs. Although the addition of furfuralcohol had slightly negative effects on hydrogen production, the total ECEs still decreased from 66.3% to 44.4% when increasing the furfuralcohol concentration from 1 to 6 g/L. This was attributed to the limited transformation of furfuralcohol to SMPs during fermentation. In contrast, the total ECEs derived from furoic acid addition (1–6 g/L) were in the range of 62.8%–67.4%, which were only slightly lower than the control group (71.9%). Furthermore, no significant decreases of the total ECEs were observed when adding excessive furoic acid (6 g/L). This result suggested that improving the conversion of furfuralcohol to furoic acid would promote the SMPs production and achieve relatively higher total ECEs."
12,Perspective of furan compounds degradation,"3.6 Perspective of furan compounds degradation The hydrolytic by-products of biomass feedstocks are complex and diverse. The main by-products derived from lignocellulosic biomass are classified into three groups, i.e., weak acids, phenolic monomers, and furan derivatives [25]. Besides, the hydrolysates from algae also contained nitrogen-containing compounds and high-molecular-weight polymers. The simultaneous exposition of microbial cells to these inhibitors can lead to the combined responses, such as antagonistic, additive, and synergistic effects [60]. Muñoz-Páez et al. reported that adding furfural (0.1–0.5 g/L) and 5-HMF (0.02–0.09 g/L) mixture to fermentation exhibited an obvious synergistic response, and the hydrogen production decreased by 11% opposite to the individual treatments that did not inhibit [24]. Larsson et al. found that no coupling inhibitory effects were observed when adding different weak acids to ethanol fermentation [61], while the synergistic effects of acetic acids and furfural were observed for E. coli LY01 [42]. Our previous studies also showed that the inhibition of hydrogen fermentation depended largely on the concentrations of phenolic monomers that added to furan derivatives [25]. The use of individual inhibitor compounds for fermentation is fundamental to identify their inhibitory effects and microbial degradation routes. Note that studying the combined responses of complex inhibitor mixtures is more important to assess the detoxification of hydrolytic by-products from actual biomass. In many cases, researchers can select members of microbial consortia that experience less inhibition than others by directly adding individual inhibitors, helping the entire consortium to overcome the combined effects of real hydrolysates via co-culture and constant domestication [24]. Jiang et al. concluded that the main furan compounds from dilute acid hydrolysis of corn stover were furfural and 5-HMF, which totally accounted for 55.6% (in area percent) of the hydrolytic by-products [62]. In contrast, furfuralcohol and furoic acid only accounted for 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Combined with the previous results, there is almost no synergistic inhibition effects of furfural, furfuralcohol, and furoic acid on hydrogen fermentation. Moreover, the metabolic detoxification by converting a toxic chemical into a non-toxic one can well explain the tolerance to inhibitors for microorganisms [42]. The identification of the fermentation inhibition stage and the rate-limiting process during furfural transformation can provide rational methods on the improvement of hydrogen production. Screening tolerant strains towards furfural by over expressing reductive coenzyme NADH may effectively reduce furans to their less toxic alcoholic forms, and hydrogen production may also be enhanced via using available residual NADH. Overcoming the limitation on conversion of furfuralcohol to furoic acid is a vitally important issue. Guarnieri et al. engineered the soil microbe called Pseudomonas putida KT2440, and this strain achieved the stable accumulation of furoic acid compared to the wild type strain [45]. However, this conversion process is direct aerobic catabolism of furfural. Developing a grading system that respectively contains P. putida KT2440 and HPB, or even establishing a co-culture system may be possible to enhance furfural degradation and biofuel production. Besides, the genetic diversification and selection strategies can also be applied to find mutants with robust synthesis of furoic acid, helping to achieve an efficient alcohol-acid transformation."
13,Conclusions,"Furfural exhibited stronger inhibition on hydrogen fermentation than its derivatives, leading to the maximum inhibition coefficient in the range of 7.1%–99.8%. Furfural inhibition mainly occurred in aldehyde-alcohol transformation, while transformation of furfuralcohol to furoic acid was still a rate-limiting step. Furoic acid could be completely degraded after 24 h of fermentation, and the hydrogen yield increased by 6%–15.3%. The metabolic pathway of acetic acid production from furoic acid may simultaneously produce hydrogen. Compared to the control group only containing glucose, furfural and its derivatives led to a deviation in the chemical oxygen balance ranging from −27.9% to −42.7%, and the energy conversion efficiency maximally decreased by 12.7%–91.7%. Additionally, a high concentration (above than 2 g/L) of furfural and its derivatives would also significantly decrease the species richness and diversity."
