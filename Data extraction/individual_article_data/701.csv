0,Introduction,"Solar energy is one of the most abundant natural resources available to mankind, with the amount of solar energy received by the earth each day greatly exceeding the total energy demand of humans per year. The challenge to current and future societies is how to efficiently capture solar energy, the key to a transition away from fossil fuel energy sources. Concerns about future energy supply security, and environmental issues of fossil fuels-dominated energy strategy, focus attention on the need to develop better technologies for solar energy capture [1]. Hydrogen has long been identified as the next generation energy carrier due to its high energy density values per unit mass and potential to be generated sustainably from a wide range of sources (fresh water, sea water, biomass resources). Extracting hydrogen efficiently from water through photocatalytic water splitting is generally regarded as the ‘Holy Grail’ in the field of chemistry [2], potentially offering an inexhaustible source of fuel for future generations. To date, rates of H2 generation via photocatalytic water splitting remain too low to warrant serious consideration as integral components of future hydrogen economies, motivating the search for new and improved photocatalysts with step change and disruptive performance levels (i.e., activities several orders of magnitude higher than current state-of-the-art photocatalysts). Solar water splitting for hydrogen production relies on the photoexcitation of a semiconductor by incoming solar irradiation. Photons with energy larger than the bandgap of semiconductor will excite orbital electrons from the semiconductor valence band (VB) into the conduction band (CB). These electrons and holes either recombine, or migrate to the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst and react with adsorbed species (Fig. 1 ). VB holes are capable of oxidizing water if the energy of VB level is more positive than the redox potential of O2/H2O, whilst CB electrons can reduce protons if the CB level is more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2. Efficient separation of photoexcited electrons and holes is key to achieving high rates of H2 evolution. Photocatalytic water splitting was first discovered by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [3]. Since that time, tremendous effort has been devoted to develop highly efficient photocatalysts for solar water splitting [4,5], with limited success to date. Many excellent review papers relating to photocatalytic hydrogen production have been published [6–8], which identify the key attributes of the semiconductor needed to be an efficient water splitting photocatalyst, which include: (1) the photocatalyst must be stable under the conditions of the photoreaction; (2) the VB and CB levels of the semiconductor must be suitably positioned to allow water oxidation and proton reduction, respectively; (3) the bandgap energy (Eg ) of the semiconductor should be larger than the standard Gibbs free energy for the water splitting reaction (273 kJ mol−1 or 1.23 eV). In practice, the semiconductor Eg needs to be >1.8 eV due to the over-potentials for H2 and O2 evolution on semiconductor surfaces; and (4) ideally the semiconductor should have a bandgap in the visible range (somewhere between 400 and 600 nm) to maximize solar spectrum utilization. A variety of other factors influence photocatalyst performance, such as the efficiency of charge separation following photoexcitation, charge mobility and lifetime of photoinduced electrons and holes, photocatalyst morphology and surface area. Sacrificial reagents (hole scavengers) are also important for achieving high rates of H2 evolution. Through optimizing these parameters (many of which are co-dependent), it is possible to achieve photocatalytic water splitting with reasonable efficiency. Over the past decades, significant breakthroughs have been made in solar-driven water splitting over niobium-based semiconductor photocatalysts. In addition, significant improvements have been made in the mechanistic understanding of these photocatalysts [7]. Owing to their unique crystal and energy band structures, niobium-based semiconductors consisting of corner-sharing octahedral NbO6, which are beneficial for the transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes, exhibited excellent performance in solar-driven water splitting. A key attribute of niobium-based semiconductor photocatalysts which makes them suitable for overall solar water splitting is the favorable position of their VB and CB levels. Compared with many traditional semiconductor photocatalysts like TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV, VBM = +2.7 V, CBM = −0.5 V), the conduction band minimum (CBM) of niobium oxide or niobates is higher (more negative w.r.t. NHE), thus imparting photoinduced electrons with the energy needed to overcome the barrier involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction. Compared with tantalum-based semiconductors, nanostructured niobium-based semiconductors can be easily fabricated and modified via the soft chemical routes due to the extra low water solubility of tantalum oxide. Moreover, many ternary structured niobates materials can absorb visible light due to their up-shifted VB. For example, in SnNb2O6 the Sn5s and O2p levels hybridize to raise the VB, resulting into a narrow bandgap. Accordingly, some niobates such as SnNb2O6, NiNb2O6 and InNbO4 can directly work as visible light photocatalysts without the need for further modification (i.e., without the need for a hydrogen evolution co-catalyst). Further, niobium oxynitrides with absorption edges between 600 nm and 750 nm have emerged as very promising candidates for direct solar water splitting owing to their excellent solar spectrum utilization. In addition, most niobium-based semiconductor photocatalysts are stable under photocatalytic water splitting conditions without the need for sacrificial electron donors, an essential requirement for practical applications. This review describes the synthetic methodology, structure design and active sites engineering of niobium-based semiconductor for photocatalytic water splitting. The niobium-based photocatalysts are divided into three main categories: niobium oxide, niobates and niobium oxynitrides. The effects of composition, structure and surface modification on the photocatalytic activities of these systems are discussed in detail, with particular attention given to photocatalysts operating at visible light wavelengths. A comprehensive summary to design strategies for niobium-based nanomaterials is provided, followed by a feasibility assessment of niobium-based photoctalysts as part of a cost-effective solar water splitting system for future green hydrogen generation."
1,Niobium oxide,"Niobium oxide (Nb2O5, also known as niobium pentaoxide) is one of the most important semiconductor materials, finding widespread application in electrochromic materials [9], supercapacitors [10], and Li-ion batteries [11], and catalysis [12–18]. Compared with TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV), Nb2O5 has a very similar band gap structure with a bandgap of 3.4 eV, of which the CB consists of the Nb4d states and the VB comprises O2p states. In addition, the CBM and VBM of Nb2O5 straddled the H+/H2 and O2/H2O redox potentials, thus enabling the oxide to drive overall water splitting under bandgap excitation. Importantly, Nb2O5 exhibits the excellent chemical stability and corrosion resistance in both acid and base media, resulting in practical application potential in the field of photocatalysis. Table 1 provides a summary of research relating to Nb2O5 photocatalysts for hydrogen production in aqueous systems."
2,Synthetic methodologies towards Nb2O5,"2.1 Synthetic methodologies towards Nb2O5 Early works relating to Nb2O5 photocatalyst development focused mainly on synthetic methods that yielded large surface areas. Zou’s group used an evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process to synthesize mesoporous Nb2O5 [15]. The photocatalytic H2 production rate of mesoporous Nb2O5 increased by nearly 20 times compared with non porous bulk Nb2O5. The superior performance of the mesoporous Nb2O5 photocatalyst was mostly due to suppression of bulk electron-hole recombination. On account of their different structure, mesoporous and bulk Nb2O5 displayed different properties in terms of the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes due to their different surface structure. Compared with bulk Nb2O5, a very short distance for the photogenerated electrons and holes migrating to the photocatalyst’s surface can be achieved for Nb2O5 with mesoporous structure, and thus a high efficiency of the photocatalytic activity. For most semiconductor photocatalyst systems, loading suitable co-catalysts on semiconductor can significantly improve the activity for photocatalytic water splitting [16,17]. Commonly used co-catalysts to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction are high work function metals such as Pd, Pt or Au nanoparticles. These metal nanoparticles accept electrons from the CB of the semiconductor, creating active sites for H2 evolution with low over-potentials (and assisting charge separation in the semiconductor at the same time). Lin and coworkers investigated the effect of co-catalysts over mesoporous niobium oxide photocatalysts, prepared by an EISA method [18]. It was found that H2 evolution rate of Nb2O5 in aqueous methanol under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation varied significantly depending on the metal co-catalyst. Pt loaded Nb2O5 afforded the highest H2 production activity of 4647 µmol h−1 g−1, which was 2.2, 2.9 and 6.5 times higher than the rates achieved over Au, Cu and NiO loaded Nb2O5 photocatalysts, respectively. Pai and coworkers also compared the performance of co-catalysts on photocatalytic H2 production activity over porous Nb2O5 photocatalysts in aqueous methanol [19]. Activities followed the order: CuO/Nb2O5 > NiO/Nb2O5 > Pt/Nb2O5. The lower performance of the NiO/Nb2O5 and Pt/Nb2O5 photocatalysts was attributed to catalyst poisoning caused by CO on active sites (resulting from the incomplete oxidation of the methanol hole scavenger). Sol-gel methods with the aid of mesopore-directing surfactants can also be used to prepare mesoporous Nb2O5 nanoparticles [20]. It was shown that the thermal treatment of a dried Nb2O5 gel at different temperatures greatly affected the photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared Nb2O5 nanoparticles. The highest photocatalytic H2 production activity was obtained over Nb2O5 nanoparticles calcined at 550 °C, exhibiting an activity comparable with commercial P25 TiO2 under the same testing conditions. Low dimensional structures are especially desirable in photocatalysis, as they provide a large surface area and short average charge transfer distances from the semiconductor bulk to surface. A large number of studies have been conducted aimed at the fabrication of Nb2O5 with the one dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2D) topologies such as nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes and nanosheets [21–33]. In our previous work, Nb2O5 nanorods assembled superstructures were successful synthesized via a hydrothermal method using niobate nanoparticles as precursors [21]. Large superstructures were formed by the self-assembly of small Nb2O5 nanorods. The nanorods assembled superstructure facilitated the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, leading to excellent photocatalytic H2 production activity using methanol as holes sacrificial agent. The H2 production rate achieved was about 150 times higher than that of Nb2O5 bulk powders. This work identified rational design principles for the construction of photocatalysts with anisotropic superstructures to improve the photocatalytic efficiency. The Nb2O5 nanorod superstructures maintained an almost constant photocatalytic H2 production rate without any noticeable catalyst deactivation during a 24 h photocatalytic recycling experiment, confirming the good stability of Nb2O5 nanorod superstructures under light irradiation. Kudo and coworkers reported that Nb2O5 nanowires with adjustable diameters can be successfully prepared by heat treatment of amorphous Nb2O5 nanowires obtained by self-assembly of (NH4)3[NbO(Ox)3]·H2O in the presence of secondary and ternary amines with different lengths of methylene chain as structure directing agents [22]. It was demonstrated that the average diameter of the Nb2O5 nanowires decreased with increasing chain length of the ternary amines. Nb2O5 nanowires with smallest diameter exhibited the best photocatalytic H2 production activity. Porous 1D Nb2O5 nanowires was also synthesized via a solvothermal method [31]. The pores in the Nb2O5 nanowires acted to narrow the semiconductor bandgap, enhancing visible light absorption and increasing charge separation efficiency. In addition, no obvious decrease of H2 evolution rate was observed for the porous nanowire photocatalyst during a 24 h photocatalytic recycling test, confirming that the porous 1D Nb2O5 nanowires were both active and highly stable. 2D Nb2O5 nanostructures are also promising candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen generation owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio, abundance of exposed active sites, atomic-scale thickness, and high fraction of coordinatively unsaturated surface sites [32,33]. Orthorhombic Nb2O5 nanosheets predominantly exposing (0 1 0) facets were prepared by a hydrothermal topological method using layered K4Nb6O17·4.5H2O as a precursor [34]. The nanosheets delivered enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity relative to spherical Nb2O5 nanoparticles. Hollow structured Nb2O5 nanomaterials also provide excellent photocatalytic performance due to their improved light-harvesting efficiency, fast charge carriers mobility and high specific surface area. Xing et al. developed a simple template-free synthetic method to produce hollow Nb2O5 nanospheres [35]. An Ostwald ripening mechanism was proposed for the formation of Nb2O5 hollow nanospheres, with the structural evolution between niobium oxide and niobate species established through a self-sacrificing template process (Fig. 2 ). The as-obtained hollow Nb2O5 nanospheres preferentially exposed high surface energy (0 0 1) planes, and were able to efficiently produce H2 from aqueous Na2SO3 solution under visible light irradiation. Many of the synthetic methods discussed so far in this section for the preparation of nanostructured Nb2O5 were based on the soft chemical process, including EISA, sol-gel, hydrothermal method. However, hard templates or structural directing reagents, which may complicate the process and decrease the photocatalytic activity of products, are not recommended during the synthesis procedure. Furthermore, nanostructured Nb2O5 with low dimensional structures, such as 1D nanorods, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets, are highly recommended for getting better performance for the photocatalytic water splitting due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, abundance of exposed active sites, short average charge transfer distances from the semiconductor bulk to surface."
3,Doping of non-metal ions,"2.2 Doping of non-metal ions Similar to other UV responsive wide bandgap semiconductor photocatalysts, pristine Nb2O5 cannot be excited by visible light. To achieve visible light absorption and increase the utilization of solar energy, it is necessary to modify Nb2O5-based photocatalysts to achieve a narrower bandgap. Among the various methods explored for bandgap modulation of Nb2O5, atomic doping attracted numerous attentions since it can greatly affect the intrinsic electronic and band structures of semiconductor substrates. Carbon-modified Nb2O5 nanostructures were obtained using a one-pot non-aqueous so-gel method at moderate temperatures [36]. It was shown that carbon atoms obtained from a benzyl alcohol precursor could influence the surface electronic density of state of Nb2O5 to extend its absorption into visible range. The resultant carbon-modified Nb2O5 have shown the ability to split water under visible light irradiation. The excellent visible light photocatalytic activity of carbon-modified Nb2O5 nanostructure could be attributed to its extended light absorption, nanostructure network and large specific surface area. A one-step flame assisted pyrolysis method was developed for the synthesis of carbonaceous Nb2O5 microspheres [37]. The as-prepared carbon modified Nb2O5 microspheres exhibited excellent photocatalytic H2 generation activity, affording a rate nearly 3 times higher that of a commercial Nb2O5 sample. The carbon species in the carbonaceous Nb2O5 sample increased the light absorption efficiency and promoted photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation through a sensitizing effect, leading to the enhanced activity. Doping nitrogen atoms into Nb2O5 is also effective for shifting light absorption from the UV into the visible range, allowing more solar energy to be utilized in photocatalytic applications [38–40]. Nanostructured nitrogen-doped Nb2O5 nanoplates combined with reduced graphene oxide (N-Nb2O5/rGO) were prepared using an in-situ wet chemical method [39]. Under sunlight irradiation, the N-Nb2O5/rGO composites (containing 1.0 wt% rGO) exhibited photocatalytic hydrogen generation rates of 537 μmol h−1 and 1385 μmol h−1 in water and H2S, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of nanostructured N-Nb2O5/rGO composites was mainly attributed to its extended light absorption range (arising from the introduction of N 2p states in the bandgap near the VB) and the formation of a well-defined N-Nb2O5/rGO interface, which offered a large interfacial surface area for accelerated charge transfer. Although doping of heteroatoms into the lattice of Nb2O5 can improve its visible light absorption behavior, dopants can also lead to crystal instability and increased recombination centers, causing a reduced overall photocatalytic H2 production efficiency. Recently, it has been demonstrated that self-doping, as opposed to impurity incorporation, is a more effective approach to achieve visible light absorption of wide bandgap semiconductors [41,42]. Black Nb2O5 nanorods with exposed (0 0 1) active surfaces were prepared for the first time by aluminum reduction of pristine Nb2O5 nanorods [42]. The substantial oxygen vacancies (Nb4+ sites) in the black Nb2O5 nanorods created defect states in the bandgap, resulting in greatly improved light absorption up to infrared light. The resultant oxygen-deficient Nb2O5 nanorods exhibited excellent photocatalytic hydrogen-generation activity under solar irradiation. Furthermore, the reduced Nb2O5 nanorods retained good photocatalytic activity after five cycles."
4,Heterojunction construction,"2.3 Heterojunction construction The photocatalytic performance of Nb2O5 can be further enhanced by constructing heterojunctions with other semiconductors to effectively promote the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs across the interfaces, thus very efficient Nb2O5-based photocatalysts [43–46]. Ultrafine Nb2O5 nanoparticles were successfully loaded onto rutile TiO2 supports through a simple hydrolysis route in strong acid solutions [47]. The resultant Nb2O5/TiO2 heterojunctions exhibited remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in the presence of methanol, far higher rates than were realized using pure rutile TiO2 or Nb2O5 photocatalysts. It was determined that the photogenerated electrons in the CB of Nb2O5 migrated into the CB of rutile TiO2, whilst photo-generated holes in rutile were transferred in the opposite direction into the Nb2O5 VB driven by Fermi energy level difference between the two semiconductors, resulting in a high charge carrier separation efficiency. In addition, combining Nb2O5 with other semiconductors with narrower bandgaps has shown potentials to improve the photocatalytic activity under visible light [48–52]. Li and coworker reported the growth of mesoporous Nb2O5 microspheres with large-surface-area on g-C3N4 nanosheets via a facile solvothermal process (Fig. 3 ) using Pluronic P123 as a structure-directing agent [49]. The as-obtained g-C3N4/Nb2O5 heterostructures showed high photocatalytic hydrogen production activity under visible light irradiation. A H2 evolution rate of 1710.04 μmol h−1 g−1 was achieved over the optimal composition (38.1 wt% Nb2O5), nearly 5 times higher than that of pristien g-C3N4. The photocatalytic activity enhancement was ascribed to intimate interfacial contact in the heterostructure which enabled effective charge separation between the g-C3N4 and Nb2O5 components. Under visible light irradiation, the photoexcited electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 can effectively immigrate to the CB of Nb2O5 through the sufficient contact interfaces because of the much more negative CB edge potential of g-C3N4 as compared with that of Nb2O5. Meanwhile, photoexcited holes on the VB of Nb2O5 can efficiently transfer to the VB of g-C3N4 to oxidize the sacrificial reagents since the VBM potential of Nb2O5 is more positive than that of g-C3N4. Consequently, the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers can be significantly suppressed, leading to the higher activity. Moreover, the stability results indicated that the photocatalytic performance of the heterostructures with the optimal composition presented no apparent deactivation after six repetitive cycles with the exposure of visible light irradiation for 24 h. Nb2O5/g-C3N4 with three-dimensional network heterostructures were prepared through a hydrothermal treatment [51], showing remarkable photocatalytic activity under simulated sunlight in the presence of hole sacrificial agents such as methanol and triethanolamine (TEOA). A remarkable photocatalytic H2 production rate of 110 mmol h−1 g−1 was obtained for a composite containing 10 wt% g-C3N4 on Nb2O5, owing to the formation of a direct Z-scheme system to allow fast electron-hole pair separation at Nb2O5/g-C3N4 interfaces. By comparison, the individual g-C3N4 and Nb2O5 photocatalyst showed rates of only 33.46 and 41.20 mmol h−1 g−1 under the same testing conditions. A noble-metal-free hetero-structured ternary photocatalytic system (CdS/Nb2O5/N-doped-graphene) was prepared via a hydrothermal treatment [52]. The resultant ternary photocatalyst exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity compared to the individual CdS, Nb2O5 nanorod and binary CdS/Nb2O5 components. The photocatalytic H2 production rate over the ternary nanocomposite was ca. 7.7 times higher than that obtained using CdS. The exceptionally high photocatalytic activity was explained as the co-contribution of the 1D Nb2O5 nanorods (possessing a high surface-to-volume ratio) and excellent separation of photogenerated charge carriers at interfaces. Although the band edge position of Nb2O5 is suitable for overall solar water splitting, Nb2O5-based photocatalysts often suffer from low photocatalyic efficiency under solar irradiation. To overcome this limitation, researchers are now directing attention to the design and construction of niobate-based photocatalysts with excellent photocatalytic activity, as is discussed in the next section. Meanwhile, we also described the bandgap engineering and defect engineering to expand the light absorption of niobate-based photocatalysts from UV to visible region in the next section."
5,Niobates,"Niobates represent a large group of semiconductors consisted of NbO3 −, Nb2O6 2− or other niobium containing anions that are held together by metal cations (e.g. alkali metal cations, alkaline earth cation, transition metal cations or and some main group metal cations). In this section, niobates are classified into alkali niobates, alkaline earth niobates, transition metal niobates and main group metal niobates. Table 2 compares the performance of various niobate-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production."
6,Alkali niobates,"3.1 Alkali niobates 3.1.1 Perovskite alkali niobates Perovskites belong to a class of inorganic crystals with chemical formula ABX3, sharing the same structure with calcium titanate CaTiO3. In such a perovskite structure, the inorganic cations A and B are coordinated by 12 and 6 anions X, respectively. Alkali niobates with a perovskite structure (e.g. ANbO3, where A = Li, Na, K, etc.) have been widely investigated as photocatalysts over the past decades. Various synthesis methodologies have been used to fabricate perovskite-type alkali niobates, some of which have demonstrated excellent performance for photocatalytic hydrogen production [53–58]. The high temperature SSR method is the most common approach used to prepared alkali niobates, with the method using niobium oxide and alkali salts as starting materials. However, the high temperatures used during the syntheses usually result in large-sized crystals with low specific surface areas, and correspondingly poor photocatalytic activities. Recently, wet chemical synthesis techniques, including hydrothermal, solvothermal, polymerizable complex, sol-gel and microwave assisted methods, have been developed to synthesize high surface area alkali niobates [59–64]. LiNbO3 nanowires were obtained by thermal treatment of a niobium complex, (NH4)3[NbO(Ox)3]·H2O (Ox = oxalate), in the presence of excess amounts of LiOH and trioctylamine structure-directing agent [65]. The as-prepared LiNbO3 nanowires showed enhanced photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution activities in aqueous solutions containing hole and electron sacrificial agents, respectively, compared with a bulk counterpart prepared by SSR method. The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the increased availability of active sites for the photocatalytic reactions owing to the high surface area of the nanowires. The phase dependent photocatalytic activity of alkali niobates has been widely investigated. A simple non-aqueous sol-gel process allowed the preparation of monodisperse LiNbO3 nanocrystals from LiNO3 and Nb(OEt)5 precursors [66]. The LiNbO3 nanocrystals with a polyhedral surface structure showed excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. The photocatalytic activity of LiNbO3 nanocrystals was determined by hydrogen-related defects in the crystals. A hydrothermal method was employed to synthesize KNbO3 submicron-crystals containing cubic or orthorhombic phases [67]. Both the cubic and orthorhombic KNbO3 submicron-crystals showed enhanced photocatalytic H2-evolution activity relative to a commercial bulk KNbO3 reference powders. Moreover, the surface area-normalized rate of H2 evolution over the submicron-cubes of the cubic KNbO3 was two times larger than that of the submicron-rods of the orthorhombic KNbO3 phase. The phase dependent photocatalytic activity of NaNbO3 was studied by Ye’s group [68]. NaNbO3 with cubic phase showed better photocatalytic activity compared with niobates prepared by the conventional way. The improved photocatalytic activity could be assigned to the unique crystal structure created by surface ligand coordination as well as the large surface area resulting from the low synthesis temperature. The influence of morphology on the photocatalytic activity of NaNbO3 photocatalysts has been the subject of a number of investigations [59,69]. Cubic NaNbO3 samples in the form of nanowires and nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified solvothermal strategy [59]. Directed by proepr organic solvent, a momentary temperature variation during the solvothermal synthesis can induce the formation of chain-like structures, leading to the formation of 1D nanowires. The as-obtained NaNbO3 nanowires (modified with 0.5 wt% Pt as the co-catalyst) showed much higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity compared to the Pt/NaNbO3 nanoparticles. The enhanced activity of NaNbO3 nanowires were attributed to its 1D nanostructure which facilitated the separation of charge carriers and large specific surface area. Dai and coworkers synthesized NaNbO3 nanowires and NaNbO3 nanocubes via a hydrothermal approach [69]. The NaNbO3 nanowires exhibited a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activity (Fig. 4 ) relative to the nanocubes. The stronger interaction between NaNbO3 nanowire and Pt nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the charge carrier transfer efficiency, thus a remarkably promoted photocatalytic activity of Pt/NaNbO3 nanowire was realized. In addition, the Pt/NaNbO3 nanowires presented super stability as well. The relationship between particle size, morphology and photocatalytic activity were systematically investigated over NaNbO3 powders obtained by several methods, including SSR, hydrothermal and a polymerized complex route [70]. It was found that the NaNbO3 sample prepared by polymerized complex method with the smallest particle size exhibited the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity from both aqueous methanol and pure water. In addition, the cubic and rectangular shaped NaNbO3 samples obtained using the hydrothermal method showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution in comparison with the SSR sample. Our group recently investigated the effect of crystal structure on the photocatalytic activity of perovskite alkali niobates. Pyrochlore-like K2Nb2O6 with a cubic structure consisting of distorted NbO6 octahedra (similar to K2Ta2O6) was successfully synthesized by a facile and eco-friendly one-pot hydrothermal method using Nb2O5 and KOH as the starting materials [71]. The resulting K2Nb2O6 photocatalyst exhibited a higher H2 production activity than perovskite KNbO3 and commercial Nb2O5. The higher activity of pyrochlore-like structure was attributed to its unique crystal and favorable VBM and CBM positions. The obtained K2Nb2O6 sample showed negligible loss of activity over four successive cycling tests, confirming high stability during photocatalytic operation. 3.1.2 Layered alkali niobates Alkali niobates with layered structures have been the focus of intense research in the field of solar driven hydrogen production because their perovskite-like layers are believed to facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus leading to higher photocatalytic activities. K4Nb6O17 as a well-known layered niobate had received numerous attentions due to its excellent photochemical and photocatalytic activities. Fig. 5 shows the layered structure of K4Nb6O17. K4Nb6O17 consists of asymmetrically stacked Nb6O17 4− layers with edge- and corner-shared NbO6 octahedra units. The stacked layers produce two distinct interlayer regions I and II. It was proposed that water reduction and water oxidation reactions can separately conduct in regions I and II, respectively. The electric field gradient generating from the unevenly distributed K+ ion is believed to accelerate charge separation [72], thus benefitting photocatalyst performance. Several synthetic methodologies to K4Nb6O17 had been developed, including the conventional SSR method, flux growth and hydrothermal syntheses. Domen and coworkers reported that pristine K4Nb6O17 could be used as an efficient overall water splitting photocatalyst, showing high and stable activity for H2 evolution without the need for assistance from a co-catalyst [73]. The effect of co-catalyst loading, particle size, light intensity and Na2CO3 addition on photocatalytic activity of K4Nb6O17 was further investigated [74–79]. Since then, many studies had been carried out on K4Nb6O17 to further improve its photocatalytic activity. Chen and coworkers synthesized porous K4Nb6O17 microspheres with a large surface area (86.6 m2 g−1) by a homogeneous precipitation method using urea. The resultant microspheres showed excellent photocatalytic water splitting activity, achieving a H2 evolution rate of 3.0 mmol h−1 without any co-catalyst [80]. Furthermore, there was no obvious decrease in gas evolution after three reaction runs, suggesting that the porous K4Nb6O17 microspheres was quite stable under light irradiation. Since K4Nb6O17 is a layered compound, it can be exfoliated then modified through ion exchange. Various K4Nb6O17-based photocatalysts with active metal or metal oxide intercalating species have been developed [73,79,81–84]. A series of ion exchanged K4Nb6O17 catalysts were prepared by exchange of K+ for H+ by immersion in H2SO4, or by exchange of K+ with transition metal ions (Cr3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+) in aqueous metal nitrate solutions at room temperature [73]. Among these photocatalysts, the H+-exchanged K4Nb6O17 showed the best photocatalytic H2 production activity. Arakawa and coworkers reported that a Pt-intercalated K4Nb6O17 catalyst, prepared by [Pt(NH3)4]2+ replacement followed by a H2 reduction step, showed excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production activity [79]. It was found that the H2 reduction step created ultrafine Pt nanoparticles with diameters less than 0.6 nm homogeneously dispersed in the interlayer space of K4Nb6O17. Under light irradiation, intercalated H2O was reduced to H2 on the Pt nanoparticles in interlayer I regions, whilst water was oxidized to O2 in interlayer II region. K4Nb6O17 with intercalated Ni, NiO and rGO were also found to be active for photocatalytic hydrogen production [81–83]. The introduction of other photoactive species, such as photoactive complexes, sulfides particles with narrow bandgaps, into the interlayer of layered alkali niobates acted as an alternative strategy to improve the visible light photocatalytic activity [85–94]. ZnS and PbS were co-incorporated into the interlayer of HCa2Ta x Nb3- x O10 (x = 0, 1) through successive reaction with n-C6H13NH2/C2H5OH organic solution in the presence of zinc acetate and lead acetate aqueous solution, followed by introducing H2S gas [93]. The resultant ZnS and PbS-intercalated HCa2Ta x Nb3- x O10 showed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with that of unsupported HCa2Ta x Nb3- x O10. The enhanced performance is mainly originated from its better guest-to-host charge transfer efficiency. Recently, a number of heteropolyoxoniobate compounds have also been found to be active for photocatalytic water splitting. Feng and coworkers reported a new heteropolyoxoniobate, K 10[Nb2O2(H2O)2]-[SiNb12O40]3·12H2O, which offered a photocatalytic water splitting activity significantly higher than that of Na10[Nb2O2][SiNb12O40]3·xH2O. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the larger yield of longer-lived charge trapping states in the compounds [95]. As polyoxometalates are a large family of compounds with diverse structures and compositions, they provide many new opportunities for the rational design and development of novel and highly efficient photocatalysts for water splitting and other applications. 3.1.3 Doping of metal ions Rh-doped calcium niobate nanosheets were prepared by the exfoliation of layered KCa2Nb3-xRhxO10-δ (Fig. 6 ). It was shown that the color of the sample became light yellow on increasing the amount of Rh dopant, indicating that the introduction of Rh into the lattice of calcium niobate shifted its light absorption into the visible region. The nanosheets exhibited a photocatalytic activity for H2 production over 160 times higher than that of the Rh-doped original layered oxide in a water/methanol reaction medium using 500 W Xe lamp as the light source [96]. The study also revealed that Rh doping caused conductivity loss of the origional layered oxide, indicating that the octahedral RhO6 unit functioned as an electron trap site. The doping of La or Ta into the niobate crystal lattice is also a useful method to promote photocatalytic performance [97–102]. La-doped calcium niobates (H1- x La x Ca2- x Nb3O10, x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) were synthesized by SSR treatment followed by an ion exchange process [100]. The effect of La3+ substitution on photocatalytic H2 production was subsequently investigated using methanol as an hole scavenger and Pt as co-catalyst. The photocatalytic activity of the catalyst highly depended on the x value. When x = 0.5, the 1.4 wt% Pt/H0.5La0.5Ca1.5Nb3O10 showed the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 169 cm3 h−1 g−1. Guo and coworkers demonstrated that Cr-doped layered KSr2Nb3O10 synthesized by SSR also exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activities [101]. The results confirmed that Cr doping level strongly influenced the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts, reached the highest H2 evolution rate at a doping level of 1.25 mol.%. Co-doping is important for balancing the charge state of niobite photocatalysts and reducing defects, thus improving photocatalytic activities [102,103]. A series of NaNbO3 photocatalysts doped with lanthanum and cobalt also showed better photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible light irradiation than NaNbO3, Cr-doped NaNbO3 or Co-doped NaNbO3 [102]. The further theoretical study indicated that the cobalt dopant created new states in the bandgap of NaNbO3, thus increasing visible light absorption. 3.1.4 Co-catalysts Adding metal co-catalysts (especially noble metal nanoparticles of Pd, Pt or Au) with low hydrogen evolution over-potentials is an efficient way to improve the photocatalytic performance of niobates-based materials [104–109]. Chuang and coworkers examined the effect of different co-catalysts (Pt, Cs, Ru, Ir, etc.) on the performance of K4Nb6O17 for photocatalytic H2 evolution [106]. It was discovered that a 0.1 wt% Cs/K4Nb6O17 photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic H2 production activity in pure water. The H2 evolution rate was 1.47 mmol h−1, about 49 times higher than that of a 0.1 wt% Pt/K4Nb6O17 photocatalyst. Only trace amount of H2 were detected for Ru, Ir and Ni loaded K4Nb6O17, and no activity was found over Fe, Co, Cu and Zn loaded K4Nb6O17. The high activity of Cs loaded K4Nb6O17 was due to the low ionization energy of cesium. Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles with plasmonic properties have also been shown to act as efficient co-catalysts to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production activity over niobates [107]. The effect of Au photodeposition on the photocatalytic performance of K4Nb6O17 was also investigated by Kudo’s group [108]. Li and coworkers also founded that the self-doped K4Nb6O17 microflowers modified by Cu nanoparticles exhibited improved photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible light [109]. The Cu nanoparticles acted as a plasmonic catalyst for the transformation of Nb5+ to Nb4+ and also acted as co-catalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Besides metal nanoparticles, metal oxides and metal sulfides can also function as efficient co-catalysts to accelerate photocatalytic H2 evolution [110–112]. NiO has been widely investigated as the co-catalyst for alkali niobate photocatalysts. A novel layered KTiNbO5 catalyst was prepared by a polymerizable complex technique by Domen and coworker. After modification with NiO, the KTiNbO5 catalyst offered a photocatalytic H2 production activity more than 10 times that of bulk KTiNbO5 prepared by the high-temperature SSR method [110]. Co3O4 and MoS2 have also been employed as co-catalysts to improve the photocatalytic activity of alkali niobates [111,112]. By directly growing MoS2 nanorod co-catalyst at the junction site of LiNb3O8 particles, a novel MoS2 nanorods/LiNb3O8 heterostructure was obtained that exhibited a H2 production rate three times higher than that of pure LiNb3O8 [112]. Further, the MoS2 nanorods were found to be better co-catalyst than 2D MoS2 nanosheets. The improved photocatalytic activity of the MoS2 nanorods/LiNb3O8 heterojunction was ascribed to the intimate junctions formed between LiNb3O8 and the MoS2 nanorods which enabled facile electron transfer. Molecular co-catalysts and rGO were also found to be effective co-catalysts for solar hydrogen production [113,114]. By introducing a small amount of rGO, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of K4Nb6O17 microspheres can be significantly improved, owing to the higher separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers [113]. The photogenerated electrons in K4Nb6O17 microspheres can easily transfer to rGO due to a slightly lower graphene/graphene·− redox potential (−0.08 V vs. NHE) compared to the CB of K4Nb6O17 microspheres, while the photogenerated holes remain in the VB of K4Nb6O17 microspheres. As a result, the photogenerated electron/hole pairs were efficiently separated. Furthermore, the composite photocatalyst was quite stable and easy to recycle, and the amount of H2 evolution did not decrease after six cycling tests. A water-soluble molecule trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), by virtue of, can serve as a homogeneous co-catalyst to accelerate hole transfer in K4Nb6O17 nanosheets owing its reversible redox couple TFA·/TFA− [114]. In the presence of TFA, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of K4Nb6O17 nanosheets was increased by ~32 times relative to that of K4Nb6O17 nanosheets without the molecular co-catalyst. The molecular co-catalyst greatly promoted hole transfer to the methanol sacrificial reagent, thus acting to suppress charge recombination (Fig. 7 ). 3.1.5 Niobic acids derived from niobates As an extension of the category of niobates-based photocatalysts, niobic acids can be obtained by hydrolysis of niobates in aqueous acid solutions [115–122]. Table 3 describes the synthesis conditions of various niobic acids from different parent niobates. The surface state of niobic acids is favorable for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Domen and coworkers first reported the synthesis of H3NbO4 and H8Nb6O19 powders from the hydrolysis of K3NbO4 and K8Nb6O19, respectively, in sulfuric acid [123]. Both of the niobic acids showed high photocatalytic H2 production activity using methanol as a sacrificial reagent in the absence of co-catalyst. Since that time, intensive studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of calcination temperature and hydrated state on the photocatalytic activities of these and related niobic acids. Ultrathin nanobelts of a protonated niobate, possessing the formula H1- x Rb x NbO3, were successfully fabricated through a sonication-assisted liquid exfoliation route from the parent material RbNbO3 in water (Fig. 8 ). The hydration of the Rb+ ions and the hydrolysis of the (NbO3)n n− chains were the main driving force for the exfoliations, which resulted in partial ion exchange (H+ replaced Rb+). Benefiting from an ultrathin nanobelt structure, the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers was effectively suppressed. As a result, the ultrathin nanobelts showed higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation in methanol aqueous solution relative to the parent material RbNbO3 [124]. To improve the photocatalytic activity of HNb3O8 2D nanosheets, ultrafine NiS nanoparticles was deposited via a facile self-assembly process [125]. Interestingly, the growth of NiS was greatly suppressed by an interlayer spatial steric effect and the strong interaction between the two components. The resultant ultrafine NiS decorated HNb3O8 nanosheeets exhibited a high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity (1519.4 μmol h−1 g−1), around 17.4 times higher than that of the pristine HNb3O8 nanosheets. Heterostructured Pt and Cu modified-Nb3O7(OH) with excellent H2 production activity were reported by Ozin and coworkers [126]. CuO and Pt nanoparticles were deposited on to Nb3O7(OH) nanorods through a microwave-assisted nucleation and growth technique. The prepared Pt-Nb3O7(OH) photocatalyst showed higher activity for H2 evolution than CuO-Nb3O7(OH), with the latter being inactive during an early induction period. The photocatalytic activity of Cu-Nb3O7(OH) was improved dramatically with time on stream due to an in-situ photoreduction process (which converted CuO to Cu0). By incorporation of titanium into Nb3O7(OH) (via substitution of niobium at octahedral lattice sites), hierarchical Ti-doped Nb3O7(OH) superstructures with larger surface areas were obtained, which exhibited high H2 evolution activity relative to pristine Nb3O7(OH) [127]. Pyrochlore H4Nb2O7 was also found to be an effective photocatalyst for H2 evolution by our group. Pyrochlore H4Nb2O7 hollow microspheres was synthesized in 2 M HCl aqueous solution at 100–180 °C using Sn2Nb2O7 hollow microspheres as the precursor [128]. The as-synthesized H4Nb2O7 hollow microspheres displayed remarkable overall water splitting performance under UV light irradiation, showing H2 and O2 evolution rates of 1240 and 600 µmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the hydrothermal synthesis method reported was also applicable for the synthesis of pyrochlore H4Ta2O7, further indicating the generality of the approach. 3.1.6 Activity enhancement under visible light irradiation Doping is a commonly used strategy to reduce the bandgaps of alkali niobates and improve their visible photocatalytic activity. NaNbO3 co-doped with iridium and lanthanum or alkaline earth metal ions have shown good visible light photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution activities in aqueous solution containing hole and electron sacrificial agents, respectively [129]. Doping with non-metal ions also proved an effective strategy for the development of visible-light-responsive KNbO3 photocatalysts [130–134]. A carbon-doped KNbO3 photocatalyst, synthesized via a hydrothermal and post-calcination two-step process with glucose as the carbon source, exhibited excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance under simulated sunlight. The doping with carbon extended light absorption into the visible region visible light and also enhanced the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs [133]. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of KNbO3 nanocubes was improved by doping nitrogen atoms into the crystal lattice [134]. However, as discussed above, doping of metal or non-metal ions can result in crystal instability, leading to severe charge recombination and result in poor photocatalytic activities. An alternative strategy to extend light absorption of semiconductors is self-doping [135–138]. Our group developed a facile yet effective UV light photoreduction method to synthesize a defective K4Nb6O17 photocatalyst [136]. By introducing Nb4+ species, the Nb4+ self-doped K4Nb6O17 microspheres were able to harvest visible and near-infrared light, resulting in significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic H2 production. This method was also applicable for the synthesis of other Nb4+ self-doped niobates. Xie and coworkers used the spatial engineering of surface oxygen vacancy defects to optimize the photocatalytic activity of K4Nb6O17 ultrathin nanosheets [137]. An enhanced H2 evolution rate was achieved for the defective K4Nb6O17, around 20 times higher than the defect-free bulk counterpart and 6 times higher than the defect-free nanosheets. The surface oxygen vacancies not only narrowed the bandgap and enhanced the optical absorption, but also reduced the migration paths of electrons and holes, resulting in improved separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs (Fig. 9 ). An efficient strategy to improve the visible photocatalytic activity of alkali niobates is to couple them with narrow bandgap semiconductors, such as transition metal sulfides and metal oxides [139–147]. Hoffmann and coworkers reported that Ni/NiO/KNbO3/CdS nanocomposites showed good visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production activity in the presence of isopropanol [141]. The enhanced activity the nanocomposite was attributed to partially reduced states of niobium (e.g., Nb4+ and Nb3+) generated under the conditions of the photoreaction. Similarly, a Ni/CdS/K4Nb6O17 photocatalyst showed good photocatalytic H2 evolution activity from water/ethanol solution under visible light illumination [142]. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity of K4Nb6O17-based catalysts can be also achieved by combining with sulfides such as CdS, Cu2S and PbS [143–145]. Transition metal oxides with narrow bandgaps are also strong candidates for the construction of niobate-based composite photocatalysts that operate under visible light. A co-precipitation method was developed by Ye and coworkers to fabricate In2O3/NaNbO3 nanocomposites [146]. By modification of NaNbO3 rods with In2O3 nanoparticles, photocatalytic pure water splitting activity under UV light irradiation were enhancedowing to the improved transport of photoexcited holes in the nanocomposites. Kudo and coworkers also demonstrated that the photocatalytic H2 production activity of NaNbO3 nanowires could be improved by coupling with a narrow bandgap SnNb2O6 shell under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) [147]."
7,Alkaline earth niobates,"3.2 Alkaline earth niobates 3.2.1 Synthetic methodologies towards alkaline earth niobates The high-temperature SSR method is the most commonly used approach to synthesize alkaline earth niobates. Sr2Nb2O7 with a layered perovskite structure and a bandgap of 3.9 eV was synthesized by the SSR method at 1370 K for 150 h [148]. The as-prepared Sr2Nb2O7 photocatalyst evolved a small amount of H2 but no O2 during photocatalytic water splitting tests. However, NiO-loaded Sr2Nb2O7 showed greatly improved overall water splitting activity. It should be noted that a H2 reduction pretreatment and subsequent O2 oxidation treatment during loading of NiO co-catalyst was key to activating Sr2Nb2O7 for water splitting. A Sr-Al-Nb-O double perovskite, possessing a domain structure with ordered Sr2AlNbO6 and disordered SrAl0.5Nb0.5O3 phases, was also synthesized using the conventional SSR method [149]. The photocatalytic activity of Sr-Al-Nb-O double perovskite for both H2 evolution in methanol aqueous solution and O2 evolution in aqueous AgF increased with as the fraction of the ordered phase decreased. The traditional SSR method uses high temperatures and long reaction times, which inevitably result in large grain growth and the products with low surface areas. Accordingly, photocatalytic activities tend to be poor. A technique based on polymerization between ethylene glycol and citric acid, was employed to overcome these problems and to prepare Sr2Nb x Ta2- x O7 solid solutions. The solid solutions obtained showed dramatically improved photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation [150], producing H2 and O2 in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio from pure water. Ba5Nb4O15 with a four-layered perovskite structure was also obtained by polymerizable complex method [151,152], exhibiting a high activity towards overall water splitting, affording H2 and O2 evolution rates of 2.4 and 1.2 mmol h−1, respectively. It was proposed that the distorted structure and appearance of polarization contributed to the high photocatalytic activity [151]. Hydrothermal and solvothermal techniques are frequently used to obtain nanosized alkaline niobates [153–155]. Ca2Nb2O7 nanoparticles with diameters between 200 and 300 nm were synthesized through the combination of solvothermal treatment and post-synthesis calcination [156]. The Ca2Nb2O7 nanoparticles (orthorhombic phase) exhibited improved activity for solar water splitting compared with bulky Ca2Nb2O7 prepared by the SSR method. A simple hydrothermal strategy for the preparation of novel niobate nanostructures was described by Ye’s group [157]. 1D single-crystalline Sr2Nb2O7 nanoribbons and SrNb2O6 nanorods with large BET surface areas were obtained, which offered higher photocatalytic activities for water splitting under UV light irradiation than the same compounds prepared by the SSR route. The rates and ratios of evolved H2 and O2 remained stable during two reaction cycles, indicating the super stability of the catalyst. 1D SrNb2O6 nanotubes and Sr0.4H1.2Nb2O6·H2O nanopolyhedra were also successfully synthesized via hydrothermal methods [158,159]. Compared with bulk SrNb2O6 powders, the 1D SrNb2O6 nanotubes (with average diameter of 300 nm, length of 3 µm and wall thickness of 50 nm) exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 production in pure water [158]. The superior activity was ascribed to higher surface area and increased light absorption properties of the nanotubes. Hydrothermally synthesized Sr0.4H1.2Nb2O6·H2O nanopolyhedra also showed excellent photocatalytic activities for pure water splitting under UV, approximately 15 times higher than that of P25 TiO2 [159]. 3.2.2 Layered alkaline earth niobates Silica pillared Ca2Nb3O10 can be synthesized from layered perovskite KCa2Nb3O10 via the intermediate formation of alkylammonium ion intercalated Ca2Nb3O10 (the interlayer spacing in the precursor increased as the alkyl chain length of the intercalated alkylamines increased). This silica pillared Ca2Nb3O10 exhibited a H2 production activity ca. 30 times higher than that of the original KCa2Nb3O10 in aqueous propanol or aqueous butanol. The enhanced activity was ascribed to the facilitated intercalation of alcohols in expanded interlayers [160]. Osterloh et al. reported that tetrabutylammonium-stabilized Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets can decompose water stoichiometrically into H2 and H2O2 under UV light irradiation [161]. However, a noticeable deactivation was observed after 48 h of irradiation, resulting from surface active sites becoming covered by H2O2. For Pt-modified niobates, the deactivation completed within 24 h due to higher H2 production rate. 2D heterostructures are of great interest in water splitting due to high surface areas and enhance charge separation properties [162,163]. Chen and coworkers reported the synthesis of heterostructured HCa2Nb3O10/CaNb2O6 nanosheets by a sintering method followed by a subsequent ion exchange step [162]. The as-prepared 2D heterostructure enabled rapid photoinduced charge carrier separation and transfer, leading to excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution performance under UV light irradiation. 3.2.3 Relationship between crystal structure and photocatalytic activity Alkali-earth metaniobate compounds, ANb2O6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba), can easily be synthesized by SSR route [164]. The relationship between the electronic band structures and photochemical properties of this family compounds were investigated. The Eg of these metaniobate compounds increases in the order CaNb2O6 (3.87 eV) > SrNb2O6 (3.85 eV) > BaNb2O6 (3.54 eV). Amongst these compounds, SrNb2O6 has the highest CBM potential, thus offering the best photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution in pure water. The relationship between electronic structure and photocatalytic water splitting activities of ABi2Nb2O9 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds has also been investigated [165]. Chen and coworkers reported that SrBi2Nb2O9 showed much higher activity than CaBi2Nb2O9, since the angle between the corner-linked NbO6 octahedral of SrBi2Nb2O9 was closer to 180° thus resulting in a higher CBM. Plane-like ABi2Nb2O9 was prepared by a molten salt approach, with the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of the samples being almost 10 times higher than those of bulk samples obtained by the SSR method [166]. Moreover, CaBi2Nb2O9 and SrBi2Nb2O9 with an orthorhombic lattice showed higher activities than BaBi2Nb2O9 with a tetragonal lattice owing to their strong distortion of NbO6 octahedra (Fig. 10 ). Novel intrinsic plasmonic photocatalysts MNbO3 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) sharing the same perovskite structure, of which all M-elements have the same group number in the periodic table of elements, were fabricated in powder form by the conventional SSR method [167,168]. The MNbO3 powders showed higher H2 evolution activity in oxalic acid aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (Fig. 11 ), with the photocatalytic H2 production efficiency following the order: CaNbO3 > SrNbO3 > BaNbO3. As the plasmonic resonance provides the only available state within the visible range, the hot carriers solely generated through the decay of photonexcited plasmon resonances are responsible to the photocatalytic properties of MNbO3. The authors also demonstrated that the solar energy absorbed by MNbO3 scales with their photocatalytic performance. Normalizing against surface area, the photocatalytic performance was determined to be proportional to the product of the solar energy absorption and electron-phonon coupling time constant [167]. 3.2.4 Enhanced activity under visible light irradiation Most alkaline earth niobates studied have wide bandgaps and therefore are active only under UV irradiation. To fully utilize solar radiation, novel alkaline earth niobates with higher visible-light-driven activity are highly desirable [169,170]. Alkaline earth niobates with nitrogen doping (Sr2Nb2O7, Sr4Nb2O9) showed a red-shifted absorption edge into the visible light region, resulting in considerable visible light photocatalytic H2 production activity [171,172]. The optimum nitrogen doping level was around 8.28 wt%, above which nitrogen doping introduced a non-layered cubic oxynitride structure and the activity deteriorated. Efficient photocatalytic oxygen evolution was observed using silver nitrate as a sacrificial reagent after N doping, with an oxygen evolution rate of 27 µmol h−1 realized under visible light irradiation corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.31%. Theoretical calculations revealed that N doping introduced additional VBs and was responsible for the visible light response. The formation of heterojunctions by combining niobates with active catalysts with narrow bandgaps is also an effect method to improve their visible light activity [173–175]. A novel heterojunction photocatalyst system composed of Sr0.4H1.2Nb2O6·H2O and g-C3N4 nanosheets was constructed by Jiang and coworkers [174]. The Sr0.4H1.2Nb2O6·H2O/g-C3N4 heterostructure showed enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible light irradiation relative to Sr0.4H1.2Nb2O6·H2O. The enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity can be attributed to the matched energy level and heterojunction structure which could improve the photogenerated charge carriers separation and transfer. Improved visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production activity was also achieved on g-C3N4/N-doped Sr2Nb2O7 heterojunctions. The enhanced activity was explained by faster charge separation resulting from the intimate contact between the heterojunction components [175]."
8,Transition metal niobates,"3.3 Transition metal niobates Recent works have shown that transition metal niobates with the general formula MNb2O6 (M = Ni, Cu, Zn, Co) are excellent candidates for photocatalytic water splitting [176–178]. Further, perovskite type AgNbO3 is also a promising visible-light active photocatalyst owing to its narrow bandgap of 2.8 eV. Columbite-type NiNb2O6 with a bandgap of 2.2 eV was synthesized by the SSR method, with the photocatalyst showing high activity for H2 production in aqueous methanol under UV irradiation [178]. Moreover, it is able to generate H2 from pure water under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) without the need for a co-catalyst, albeit at a very low rate. It was found that Ni d-d transition likely play an important role in the photoexcitation process and photocatalytic activity of NiNb2O6 catalyst. Kamimura and coworkers reported that two different polymorphs of CuNb2O6 (monoclinic and orthorhombic phases), each with a bandgap of ~2.7 eV, exhibited good photocatalytic H2 evolution activity in aqueous methanol under AM 1.5G solar light irradiation [179]. By depositing Pt nanoparticles over the CuNb2O6 photocatalysts, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate could be improved by around 7 times relative to the bare CuNb2O6 polymorphs. Thus, both polymorphs of CuNb2O6 are promising candidates as visible light photocatalysts for H2 evolution from water, despite their d9-d0 oxide configuration. ZnNb2O6 consisting of d10 and d0 metal ions was found to be highly active for photocatalytic water splitting by Kudo’s group [180]. Subsequently, various methodologies had been developed to fabricate nanostructured ZnNb2O6 with improved photocatalytic activities [181–189]. In order to expand the visible light absorption of ZnNb2O6 with a wide bandgap of ~4.0 eV, vanadium incorporated ZnNb2O6 were synthesized by SSR method to form Zn(Nb1- x V x )2O6 solid solutions (0.01 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) [190]. V-doping narrowed the bandgap energy ZnNb2O6 to ca. 2.5 eV. The resultant solid solutions, after loading with RuO2 as an oxygen evolution co-catalyst, exhibited good photocatalytic activities for O2 production from aqueous solution under irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Kudo and coworker reported that AgNbO3 obtained by SSR exhibited visible light photocatalytic activity for the O2 evolution reaction using AgNO3 as electron sacrificial agent, and H2 evolution in methanol aqueous solution [191]. Solvothermal and liquid-solid methods were used by Zou’s group to synthesize polyhedron-shaped AgNbO3 crystals with a nanostep microstructure [192]. The results indicated that the polyhedron-shaped structure was favorable for the photocatalytic oxygen evolution under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, doping with Cu on the surface can significantly enhance the visible light activity, yielding a four-fold higher increase in activity relative to the pure AgNbO3 phase. Ye and coworkers further demonstrated that the photocatalytic O2 evolution activity of AgNbO3 can be dramatically improved by constructing a perovskite-type solid solution (AgNbO3)1- x (SrTiO3) x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) [193]. The orbital hybridization (Ag 4d and O 2p, Nb 4d and Ti 3d) played critical roles in adjusing the band structure, and thus in tailoring the photophysical and solar hydrogen production properties. In addition, the photocatalytic O2 evolution activity of solid solutions can be further improved significantly by decoration with Ag nanoparticles. Significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity was observed for AgNbO3/NaNbO3 solid solutions [194,195]."
9,Other main group metal niobates,"3.4 Other main group metal niobates Recently, the photocatalytic activity of a series of main group metal niobates, including indium niobates, tin niobates and bismuth niobates have been widely studied. The photocatalytic water splitting activities of wolframite-type InNbO4 containing InO6 and NbO6 octahedra in a unit cell was first investigated by Zou’s group [196,197]. The bandgap of InNbO4 was determined to be 2.5 eV, allowing the absorption of the visible light up to ~500 nm. The potential of the CBM in InNbO4 was more negative than that of H+/H2 redox couple, while the VBM being 0.57 eV positive than that the O2/H2O couple, suggesting that InNbO4 had a suitable band structure for visible light-driven water splitting. It was found that InNbO4 can produce H2 from visible light photocatalytic pure water splitting, though the activity was very low. Single-crystal Bi3NbO7 nanoparticles were synthesized by combining polymerized complex-assisted and hydrothermal methods [198]. The as-prepared Bi3NbO7 nanocrystallites showed good H2 production activity under visible light irradiation, approximately 2.3 times higher activity than bulk Bi3NbO7 powders obtained by a SSR method. Another bismuth niobate, the layered oxychloride with a Sillen-Aurivillius perovskite structure (Bi4NbO8Cl), was found to be a stable photocatalyst for water oxidation (Fig. 12 ). Moreover, Bi4NbO8Cl showed good water splitting performance under visible light irradiation through the Z-scheme heterojunction when coupled with a Rh-doped SrTiO3 H2 evolution photocatalyst [199]. Tin-based niobates are promising candidates for solar water splitting due to their interesting crystal structures and narrow bandgaps [200]. Two crystal structures, froodite type SnNb2O6 and pyrochlore type Sn2Nb2O7, were found to be suitable photocatalysts for solar water splitting [201–208]. Kudo and coworkers first examined the visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production activity of SnNb2O6 and Sn2Nb2O7 [201]. Although these two tin niobates possessed similar bandgaps of about 2.3 eV, a H2 production rate of 18 μmol h−1 was obtained for SnNb2O6 whilst no H2 was detected under the same photocatalytic conditions for Sn2Nb2O7. SnNb2O6 nanoplates with a thickness of about 10 nm were later obtained by calcinating Sr2Nb2O7 and molten SnCl2 mixture at 573 K [202]. Although the flux-assisted method resulted in a nanostructured SnNb2O6 with a large specific surface area (56 m2 g−1) in comparison to the bulk powders synthesized by the SSR method, no improvement in the H2 production activity was achieved. This was attributed to a decreased crystallinity in the nanostructured SnNb2O6. Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of SnNb2O6 synthesized using Sn3O2(OH)2 instead of SnO as the Sn source in the SSR method was improved [203]. The enhanced photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the suppressed formation of Sn4+ as an impurity at grain boundaries. To further improve the photocatalytic activity of SnNb2O6, well-defined nanoplates with thicknesses between 20 nm and 30 nm were prepared by a template-free solvothermal method in ethanol aqueous solution [204]. In our previous work, we further developed a simple and effective hydrothermal method for the synthesis of ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheets with an average thickness of ~3 nm using SnCl2 and K4Nb6O17 nanosheets as precursors [205]. The resulting ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheets processed higher visible light photocatalytic H2 evolution activity than two reference samples: 1) SnNb2O6 nanosheets with a thickness of ~50 nm and 2) bulk SnNb2O6 powders prepared by SSR method. The high photocatalytic activity of the ultrathin SnNb2O6 nanosheets can be attributed to the enhanced electron transfer capability and large specific surface area. The formation of heterojunctions is also an effective route to improve the photocatalytic performance of SnNb2O6 photocatalysts. Chen and coworkers reported that a MoS2/SnNb2O6 2D/2D nanosheet heterojunction fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method showed enhanced H2 production activity compared with bare SnNb2O6 nanosheets [206]. The superior photocatalytic performance was ascribed to the extended visible light absorption as well as promoted charge carrier separation and transfer efficiency in the composite, which stems from the synergistic effect of SnNb2O6 and MoS2, the large contact area between the two components, and an abundance of active reaction sites. Our group also reported a facile method to prepare hierarchical Sn2Nb2O7 hollow spheres using NH3 and CO2 bubbles generated during the decomposition of urea under hydrothermal conditions as gas templates [207]. The as-prepared hollow spheres exhibited ~4 times higher visible light photocatalytic H2 evolution activity than that of bulk Sn2Nb2O7 prepared using a conventional SSR method. We also found that lactic acid is more than a hole sacrificial reagent in improving the photocatalytic H2 production activity of Sn2Nb2O7, since no H2 evolution was detected when lactic acid was replaced by methanol (another frequently used sacrificial reagent)."
10,Niobium oxynitrides,"Nitride and oxynitride are two kinds of promising semiconductors for solar energy conversion applications, including photocatalysis, photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical cells. Nitrides and oxynitrides typically have better solar absorption and electrical transport properties than oxides. In addition, they are less well-studied compared to other semiconductor systems (oxides, sulfides), thus offering more opportunity for exciting breakthroughs and the discovery of new materials [209,210]. Niobium oxynitrides are promising visible light responsive catalysts due to their relatively small bandgaps (e.g., ~1.6 eV for LaNbON2, ~1.7 eV for BaNbO2N, ~1.8 eV for SrNbO2N and ~2.0 eV for CaNbO2N), thus giving absorption edges between 600 nm and 750 nm. The hybridization of N2p with O2p orbitals pushes the VBM of niobium nitrides upwards (in a negative direction toward EF ) and thus decreases the bandgap energy. Importantly, most niobium oxynitrides have the bandgap structure that straddles the H+/H2 and O2/H2O redox couples, indicating their potential ability to drive overall water splitting. As a same family element, tantalum (oxy)nitrides, especially TaON and Ta3N5, have been widely studied in the field of solar water splitting [211]. Both Ta and Nb elements belong to the group VB in the periodic table, and they can be classified as twin brothers with similar atomic, chemical and physical properties. However, the NbON and Nb4N5 powders have received little attention in photocatalytic water splitting, since they are difficult to synthesize in pure form and appear to have low photocatalytic activity [212–215]. Thus, in the remainder of this section, the development of perovskite-related niobium oxynitrides will be prioritized."
11,Synthesis of niobium oxynitrides,"4.1 Synthesis of niobium oxynitrides Perovskite LaNbON2 and ANbO2N (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) have also been widely investigated for solar water splitting [216–227]. Traditionally, niobium oxynitrides were synthesized by SSR at higher temperature under an ammonia atmosphere. Highly crystalline perovskite-type LaNbON2 were synthesized using sodium hydroxide as an oxygen source in supercritical ammonia [216]. Ammonothermal methods and cation-doping with ions of lower valence than the parent cation, were employed to improve the photocatalytic water splitting activity of LaNbO2N. During the synthesis process of LaNbO2N, Nb5+ is easily reduced to Nb species with lower oxidation state due to the nitrogen vacancy-induced charge compensation effect. The reduced Nb species will act as recombination centers due to the introduction a donor level below the conduction band minimum [217]. This leads to poor photocatalytic activity. However, doping with lower-valence cations can decrease the formation of reduced niobium species, leading to improved photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Similar phenomena were observed by Xu and coworkers [218]. It was found that the defect levels can be minimized by introducing Mg2+ into the B site of CaNbO2N, which also resulted in a beneficial positively shift of the VBM. As a result, improved photocatalytic activity for water oxidation was achieved for CaNbO2N by Mg modification. The choice of precursors during nitridation syntheses is another efficient strategy to decrease the defect of niobium oxynitrides [219,220]. Yang and coworkers reported that LaNbO2N with a low defect density and high surface area can be successfully prepared via thermal ammonolysis of La3NbO7 as a novel precursor, which has more basic oxide and lower Mulliken charge on Nb5+ than LaNbO4 [220]. Perovskite-type niobium oxynitrides compounds are also promising photocatalysts for visible light water splitting due to their small bandgap energies of 1.7–2.0 eV [221,222]. A series of perovskite niobium oxynitrides (ANbO2N, A = Ca, Sr, Ba and La) were prepared by heating the corresponding metal oxide precursors under a flow of NH3 at an appropriate temperature [222]. CaNbO2N can produce H2 and O2 from aqueous solution with hole and electron sacrificial agents, respectively, indicating its capability of driving overall water splitting. The nitridation temperature of CaNbO2N was important for achieving a high photocatalytic activity, due to the need to achieve a balance between producing the active oxynitrides phase and suppressing the formation of reduced Nb species. As mentioned above, reduced niobium species can act as electron-hole recombination centers and thus decrease photocatalytic activity. To overcome the high defect density and low photocatalytic activity of BaNbO2N synthesized by traditional thermal ammonolysis methods, a modified synthesis procedure was developed by adding BaCO3 to the Ba5Nb4O15 precursor [223]. By adjusting the nitridation precursors and co-catalysts, photocatalytic water oxidation up to 740 nm, the longest wavelength reported for (oxy)nitride photocatalysts, was observed over BaNbO2N (Fig. 13 ). A further study indicated that both higher NH3 flow rates and larger Ba/Nb ratios in precursors can suppress the reduction of Nb5+ ions in the nitridation products. Further, the use of a precursor prepared by a soft-chemistry method allowed the lower nitridation temperatures and shorter nitridation times, compared with precursors based on a physical mixture of BaCO3 and Nb2O5 [224]. Perovskite-type SrNbO2N nanoparticles with size ~40 nm were prepared by thermal nitridation of an oxide precursor synthesized using a solvothermal method. After decoration with a Pt co-catalyst, the resulting Pt/SrNbO2N nanoparticles showed excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2-production activity in a water-carbinol system [225]."
12,Layered niobium oxynitrides,"4.2 Layered niobium oxynitrides 2D layered oxynitrides are promising candidates for visible light photocatalytic H2 production, but few examples have been reported to date owing to the difficulty of synthesizing 2D oxynitrides. Maeda and coworkers reported that Rb2NdNb2O6N·H2O, a layered perovskite belonging to tetragonal P4/mmm space group, can be obtained by ammonothermal treatment of layered RbNdNb2O7 in the presence of Rb2CO3 [226]. The as-synthesized Rb2NdNb2O6N·H2O has an absorption edge at about 500 nm, showing good activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution in aqueous triethanolamine solutions under visible light (λ > 400 nm). Two oxynitride Ruddlesden-Popper phases, Rb1+ x Ca2Nb3O10- x ·yH2O and Rb1+ x LaNb2O7- x ·yH2O were synthesized by thermal ammonolysis at 800 °C from the Dion-Jacobson phase RbCa2Nb3O10 and RbLaNb2O7, respectively, in the presence of Rb2CO3 [227]. Photocatalytic water oxidation test showed that the former niobate exhibited a higher oxygen evolution activity, with a quantum efficiency of 0.025% in the presence of AgNO3. A novel Ruddlesden-Popper phase oxynitride K1.6Ca2Nb3O9.4N0.6·1.1H2O was prepared by the topochemical ammonolysis reaction using a Dion-Jacobson oxide phase compound KCa2Nb3O10 as the precursor in the presence of K2CO3. The resultant oxynitride layered perovskite K1.6Ca2Nb3O9.4N0.6·1.1H2O can be protonated and thus exfoliated into nanosheets. The modest bandgaps of such 2D materials make them promising candidates for photocatalytic solar water splitting."
13,Concluding remarks and outlooks,"Photocatalytic water splitting continues to receive a lot of attention from the scientific community, motivated by the possibility of utilizing zero cost and abundant solar energy to generate H2 fuel from water. Tremendous advances have been made in the field over the past decade, particularly with respect to the understanding of the fundamental photophysics of semiconductors and reactions occurring on the surface of working photocatalysts under bandgap excitation [228,229]. Niobium-based systems represent one of the most exciting areas of modern photocatalyst development for water splitting. This review aimed to summarize some of the most important work reported in the past 40 years relating to niobium-based materials for solar water splitting. The design, synthesis and applications in solar water splitting was discussed in detail, with special attention being focused on structure-activity relationships. Most niobium-based semiconductor photocatalysts have large bandgaps, thus allowing them to drive overall solar water splitting [230,231]. However, these wide bandgap semiconductors typically only work under UV irradiation, meaning that they are not particularly efficient under full spectrum solar irradiation. Various strategies (i.e., non-metal doping [38–40,50,99,232], self-doping [41,42,109,136], construction of heterojunctions [48,51,144], etc.) have been employed to expand the absorption of niobium-based photocatalysts into the visible region. In spite of these modifications, truly meaningful rates of overall photocatalytic water splitting (e.g., 100 mmol h−1 g−1 as a starting point) under visible light irradiation/solar light have still not been achieved. Thus, the discovery of novel niobium-based semiconductor photocatalysts with excellent photocatalytic water splitting activity under visible light irradiation remains a great research challenge. Furthermore, it is highly desirable to develop effective method to suppress the recombination of the charge carriers for niobium-based photocatalysts. Here, bandgap engineering [174,193], defect engineering [233,234] and facet engineering [235–237] are plausible approaches to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Meanwhile, the kinetics analysis of the main catalytic reactions involved in the production of H2 and O2 by overall solar water splitting remains a further challenge in this field. Multi-disciplinary research using operando must be applied in order to realize step-change improvements in the performance of niobium-based photocatalysts for water splitting. Regarding performance targets, solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies of at least 5% are needed to achieve economic feasibility [238]. Therefore, photocatalysts with wide light absorption ranges are needed (i.e., absorption edges larger than 600 nm). Niobium oxynitrides, especially perovskite type ANbO2N (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) and LaNbON2 with absorption edges between 600 nm and 750 nm, are regarded as the very promising candidates owing to their excellent visible light responsiveness. However, these particular niobium oxynitrides are inefficient for overall water splitting currently due to the lack of surface active sites and fast electron-hole recombination rates. Bandgap engineering and co-catalyst modifications are therefore a very important consideration in this field. In addition, defects (reduced niobium species, such as Nb3+ and Nb4+) created during the nitridation process act as electron-hole recombination centers, leading to a decrease in photocatalytic activity. Thus synthetic routes need to be developed that minimize or eliminate these defects must be developed. Ionic-liquid-supported synthesis may be an alternative and promising approach. For niobium-based semiconductor photocatalysts, understanding of photocatalytic reaction mechanisms at the solid-liquid interface should be investigated in detail. The understanding of photocatalytic processes on the atomic and molecular level is crucial. The combination of rational photocatalyst/experimental design and advanced analytical tools for materials, such as in-situ spectroscopies, especially advanced space- and time-resolved techniques, provide useful and strong evidence to deep the understanding of reaction mechanisms and the factors influencing photocatalyst activity. Whilst encouraging advances have been achieved in recent years relating to the synthesis of photocatalysts with higher activity, drastic improvements in solar energy conversion efficiencies are still needed. Photocatalytic water splitting process is affected by serval factors, such as crystal structure, bandgap energy structure, surface states, co-catalysts, and trace amount of impurities/dopants. Many of these factors cannot be studied in isolation, and instead act cooperatively on a photocatalytic system. Current most experimental techniques can investigate only one factor at a time. Accordingly, theoretical studies such as DFT calculations will play an increasingly important role in future photocatalyst research to aid understanding of photocatalytic reaction processes. Can we achieve the ultimate goal of solar-driven hydrogen production from water on a large scale? That is difficult to say at this stage. In the short term, more realistic goals should be targeted such as a benchmark H2 evolution rate of 100 mmol h−1 g−1 or a STH efficiency of 2% for pure photocatalytic water splitting in the absence of sacrificial hole scavengers."
