0,Introduction,"The reduction of nitro compounds by acid/metal (e.g. Fe, Zn or Sn) or via transition-metal catalyzed hydrogenation is commonly used access to amines, an important class of organic compounds. However, these traditional processes usually proceed under high pressure of hydrogen and/or use stoichiometric acids and metals with a lot of toxic wastes released. From the standpoint of sustainable development, an atom-economic, “green” and operationally convenient method for the synthesis of amines from nitro compounds is highly desirable. In this regard, the borrowing- hydrogen methodology [1–3], which transfers hydrogen from readily available alcohols to nitro compounds to produce amines as well as valuable aldehyde, provides a promising alternative to the existing method for reduction of nitro compounds. Till date, many efforts have been made to contribute the development of the borrowing-hydrogen methodology. N-functionalized compounds (secondary and tertiary amines mainly) syntheses starting with nitroarenes and alcohols without any other reductants have been established over homogeneous catalysts (mostly Ru) [1], heterogeneous catalysts [2] and TiO2-based photocatalysts [3]. Notably, outstanding catalytic activities have been obtained from the Au recyclable heterogeneous catalysts [2a,b] that overcame the inherent drawbacks of homogeneous ones such as the dependence on toxic and costly ligands and the difficulties in separating and reusing expensive catalysts from reaction mixture. The transfer of hydrogen from alcohols to nitro compounds allows generating amines and aldehydes and because the two products can easily condense into imines, these hydrogen-transfer reactions would yield imines as the final products. In certain cases, the amines can even formed due to further hydrogenation of the imines [1b,c,d,e,2b,c,d]. Supported-palladium catalysts are classical heterogeneous catalysts for oxidations and reductions. Among various heterogeneous catalysts [4], palladium-based catalysts have shown excellent performances for the dehydrogenation of alcohols [4f]. In this sense, we speculated that supported-palladium catalyst would promote the reduction of nitro compounds with alcohols as a hydrogen source if the palladium-hydride species from palladium-mediated dehydrogenation of alcohol could deliver hydrogen to nitro compounds. Herein, we reported an easy-to-handle heterogeneous palladium catalytic system for the selective production of imines, a class of versatile synthetic intermediates for dyes, fragrances, pharmaceuticals, fungicides, optical material and agricultural chemicals [5], using hydrogen-transfer strategy between nitroarenes and benzyl alcohols. To the best of our knowledge, only one palladium heterogeneous catalysis has been reported recently for this kind of transformation, however strong base was required in that case [2e]."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The hydrotalcites used in this work with the composition of Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3 were prepared according to an established method [6]. Two aqueous solutions were ready at first. AlCl3·9H2O (50mmol) and MgCl2·6H2O (150mmol) were dissolved in 100mL of deionized water (solution a). Na2CO3 (60mmol) and NaOH (210mmol) were dissolved in 60mL of deionized water (solution b). Solution a was slowly added into solution b and the emulsion was heated at 65°C for 18h with vigorous stirring. Thereafter, the white slurry was cooled to room temperature. The solids were filtered and washed with about 1.6L deionized water, finally dried at 120°C overnight. Pd/C was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Corporation. The rest supported-palladium catalysts were synthesized by the impregnation method. The support was immersed into a fresh aqueous solution of PdC l 4 2 − , and the mixture was stirred for 4h. Thereafter the mixture was allowed to stand for 6h and then dried at 60°C under stirring. The powdery sample was dried at 120°C over night and calcined at 300°C for 0.5h. For a hydrotalcite supported catalyst, the calcination was not carried out in order to keep the special layer-to-layer structure. XRD patterns confirmed the hydrotalcite structure on Pd/HT."
3,Catalyst characterization,2.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area of varied supports were determined by micropore analyzer ASAP 2020. The palladium loading in the catalysts before and after reaction were determined by inductively coupled plasma OES spectrometer (ICP) using a Jobin Yvon Ultima 2. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEM 2010 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200kV. Samples for TEM measurements were suspended in ethanol and dispersed ultrasonically. Drops of the suspensions were applied on a copper grid coated with carbon.
4,Catalytic test,"All reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere using Schlenk techniques. The reagents used in the experiments were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Acros Organics, Avocado and Alfa Aesar and used as received. In a typical reaction, 2wt% Pd/HT catalyst (0.05g, 2mol% Pd relative to nitrobenzene) was added to a pressure tube (25mL) equipped with a stir bar. The tube was sealed with a rubber septum, and vacuumed for several times. Substrates nitrobenzene (0.5mmol, 50μL), benzyl alcohol (1.5mmol, 150μL), and solvent toluene (2mL) were added into the tube though the rubber septum using syringes, and then the septum was replaced by a Teflon screwcap under a nitrogen flow. The tube was sealed and the mixture was allowed to stir in a preheated oil bath at 130°C for 24h. After the reaction was completed, a GC internal standard dodecane (10μL) was added to the mixture. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and filtered through a pad of silica gel. The pad of the silica gel was washed again with small amount of ethyl acetate and the final volume of the clear solution was marked up to 25mL. The liquid products were then analyzed using a gas chromatography equipment (Agilent 7820A). For the cycling performance test when the reaction mixture was cooled down, the solid catalyst was separated by centrifuge, washed with ethanol several times and dried at 120°C. Then the recycle catalyst was ready for the next reaction. After the reaction the solid catalyst was filtered, and the filtrate was analyzed for palladium by ICP. And the palladium loading in the 2wt% Pd/HT catalyst was also determined by ICP. For the analysis of the nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol derivatives, an aliquot (2mL) was removed from the reaction mixture in the pressure tube, and it was concentrated under reduced pressure. NMR internal standard paraldehyde was added to it. The product was then determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Optimization of catalytic systems and recycling of catalysts,"4.1 Optimization of catalytic systems and recycling of catalysts The optimization study was first performed on a series of palladium catalysts loaded on various supports (Table 1 ). The reaction of nitrobenzene (1a) with 3 equiv. of benzyl alcohol (2a) was chosen as the model system, in which the 1:3 ratio of 1a to 2a was calculated on the basis of the minimum theoretical amount of hydrogen needed for the nitrobenzene reduction. Among the palladium heterogeneous catalysts tested, the supports were observed to greatly affect the catalytic performances. The conversion of benzyl alcohol (2a) was high over Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Pd/TiO2 (entries 1 and 2). However, most of the palladium catalysts tested afforded N-benzylideneaniline (3a) in low yields (entries 1–5) due to the poor reactivity of nitrobenzene (1a). We were pleased to find that 2wt% Pd/HT catalysts exhibited the best catalytic performance for the direct synthesis of N-benzylideneaniline. Almost complete conversion (>99%) was obtained and the yield of 3a reached 93% (entry 6). In fact, the total yield (3a and 4a) could be achieved at 95% after half reaction time (12h). Once the layer-by-layer structure of HT was destroyed by calcination, the catalytic activity declined sharply from 94% to 32% (entries 8–9). By substituting Co for Mg, the basicity of HT was regulated and the yield of 3a was diminished significantly from 79% to 12% (entries 9–10) at the same time. The blank support HT showed no activity for this reaction (entry 11). Using an organic palladium source, the Pd/HT catalyst gave moderate yield (63%, entry 12). The main product was 3a on Pd/HT (Table 1, entries 6, 8, 9 and 13) with no amine observed. When H2 behaved as hydrogen source to carry out the transformation (entry 13), the conversion of 1a and the yield of 3a dropped sharply indicating that the Pd–H species formed in situ from alcohol was more active than from the molecule of hydrogen (H2) and preferred to affording imines. The recyclability of the supported-palladium catalyst was performed (Table 2 ). We found the conversion of substrates and the selectivity of N-benzylideneaniline (3a) underwent a slight decrease after 5 runs on the recycled 2wt% Pd/HT catalyst."
7,Catalyst characterizations,"4.2 Catalyst characterizations To further understand the differences of catalytic performance, we characterized the various supported-palladium catalysts. It seemed that the correlation between the specific areas of different supports (Table 3 ) and the activities of the catalysts can not be established. The dispersion states of palladium species on supports were presumed to be responsible for their different performances. At the end of the reaction, we observed that the palladium particles were formed in situ during reaction (Fig. 1 and Table 4 ). Among the catalysts prepared by wet impression method, the size distribution of palladium particles on HT was found relatively narrow. And the mean size of Pd particles on HT was estimated at about 3.5nm, which was smaller than the one measured for other catalysts prepared by wet impression method. We speculated that the unique layer-by-layer structure of HT was helpful to enhance the dispersion of the palladium precursors in impregnation preparation and to limit the aggregation of the palladium species in reaction [7]. The well-dispersed palladium particles on HT exhibited the excellent performance. The big gap of performance between Pd/HT and Pd/C purchased was probably resulted from the rich hydroxyl groups on HT surface [4f,g]. In order to find out the reason for the slight decrease in Pd/HT activity, the recycled catalyst was characterized. The XRD results showed that the layer-by-layer structure of HT support was maintained after reaction. However, the signals of recycled catalyst were much weaker than that of HT before use. According to TEM results, the average size of palladium particles did not get changed significantly and the distribution of the palladium particles size was a little wider after first use of Pd/HT catalyst. The amount of the palladium species in the solution (0.01mg palladium in the reaction liquid) was lower than 1% of the palladium loaded on the 2wt% Pd/HT catalyst. Therefore, the leached palladium species in the reaction solution could be ignored. Based on these results the slight reduce on catalytic performance of cycled catalyst could be attributed to the decrease in crystallinity of HT support as well as the minor changes on morphology and size of palladium particles."
8,Selective formation of imine on Pd/HT catalyst,"4.3 Selective formation of imine on Pd/HT catalyst The selective formation of N-benzylideneaniline (3a) was affected by the ratio of 2a to 1a (Table 5 ). The previous studies demonstrated that the activation of the substrate required raising the amount of 2a to 5–8 equiv. and reducing the reaction time carefully, which afforded 3a in 80–95% yields. [1a,2a] In contrast, our Pd/HT system was shown able to produce the target product with high yield (93% yield) using only 3 equiv. of 2a. Additionally, no high degree amines was found when the equivalence of 2a increased from 3 to 15. To better understand the product selectivity on Pd/HT, the compositions of reaction mixture gathered during reaction process were analyzed. The time-dependence of Pd/HT catalyzed imine formation (Fig. 2 ) revealed that the consumption rates of 1a and 2a were almost the same, indicating that the formation rate of hydrogen species well matched the delivering rate. The intermediate 5a that was formed initially was converted to 3a within 2h, and after 20min the main product was 3a. The amount of 4a present was always less than 15% of the total yield. These results further indicated that under the typical reaction condition the hydrogen from alcohol led to the reduction of nitrobenzene but not the hydrogenation of imine. It could be attributed to the low initial rate of imine hydrogenation (only one third of that of alcohol dehydrogenation) over palladium catalyst [8]. Therefore, palladium catalyst showed extraordinaryly high imine selectivity."
9,Scope of substrates for Pd/HT catalyst,"4.4 Scope of substrates for Pd/HT catalyst The generality for the synthesis of imines from nitroarenes and alcohols was further explored on 2wt% Pd/HT (Table 6 ). The approach furnished the desired products in generally good to excellent yields. Electron-donating group could afford higher total yields than electron-withdrawing ones. This reaction was compatible with ester- and fluoro- substituents. Tertbutyl benzyl alcohol provided moderate yield (56%) probably due to steric factors. Morpholino-, amido- and methylamino-groups on nitrobenzenes could be tolerated if prolonging the time. It was worth noting that the nitrobenzene with a nitro or amino group at ortho position could not only be reduced but also undergo the ring closing to form imidazole (Scheme 1 ), which is an important biological material used in pharmaceutical production, novel DNA recognition and assembling [9]. After 48h, nitrobenzene was almost completely converted to imidazole over 2mol% palladium catalyst."
10,Conclusions,"We provided a new imine synthesis method starting from benzyl alcohols and nitrobenzene on hydrotalcite-supported palladium heterogeneous catalysts. The Pd/HT catalyst was shown efficient towards production of imine without any addition of base. Moreover the catalyst enables to be recycled. The HT support enhanced the dispersion of palladium species, and the palladium particles with size of about 3.5nm were formed during reaction. Both of the small size of palladium nanoparticles and the rich hydroxyl groups on HT surface were great helpful for the catalytic performance of Pd/HT. The simple and efficient strategy was applicable for the broad scope ranging from electron-donating to -withdrawing substituted substrates. The matched rate of producing and consuming Pd-H promoted the overall reaction. The hydrogen-transfer protocol in combination with the executive condition ensured the high atom-efficiency."
