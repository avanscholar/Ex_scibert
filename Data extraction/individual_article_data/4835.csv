0,Introduction,"Urea as the most widely used synthetic fertilizer, similar with the pesticides, plays a tremendous role for alleviating the global food crisis triggered by the rapid population growth owing to its high nitrogen content of 46% and low cost of production [1]. Unfortunately, due to the surface runoff, leaching and vaporization, the practical utilization efficiency of the conventional urea used in agroindustry is merely below 50% and whereas approximately 20%–70% of the primary components escape to the environment, which gives rise to less economic cultivation, overuse of the fertilizer, adversely environmental pollution and adverse human health problems, etc. [2]. Therefore, it is of urgent requirement to develop effective technologies for simultaneously enhancing the efficiency of urea intake and the crop yields without increasing the existing application scale of fertilizer [3]. It is well-known that the slow-release conception and formulation of the conventional urea, which is mainly prepared by physically encapsulating the urea with partially hydrophilic and partially hydrophobic inorganic and/or organic materials capable of reducing its dissolution rate, could effectively address the above problems [4]. Undoubtedly, besides the coating technology, the coating material with desirable properties is the core of the preparation of slow-release urea (SRU) [5]. Although sulfur and synthesized polymers, such as polyethylene, polyacrylic acid latex and polyvinyl acetate [6], have been extensively explored and utilized as the coating materials in the past few years, most of them are severely subject to the limitations for the large scale of application due to high costs, process complexity, non-degradable and environmental pollution, etc. [7]. Recently, as a widespread natural polysaccharide polymer, starch was considered as the most promising alternative coating material for the SRU preparation [8]. However, utilization of the native starch-based coatings is still restricted due to its inherent hydrophilicity, low viscosity, and brittleness, etc. [9]. To meet various application requirements, native starch is generally modified through physical, chemical, and enzymatic approaches to improve its properties and functionalities [10]. Among them, chemical modifications of starch commonly including etherification, esterification, cross-linking and grafting are one of the most prevalent techniques and the corresponding modified starch was also widely used in food manufacturing and other industrial processes [11]. As a new amphoteric esterified starch, SPC was traditionally synthesized in organic solvents such as benzene or pyridine by reacting the dry starch with phosphate and urea under vacuum or microwave irradiation at varied temperature [12]. After esterification, the formed SPC has the superior physicochemical characteristics, such as high viscosity, low gelatinization temperature, and strong ion adsorption capacity, etc. [13]. It also needs to be noted that both of the phosphate and urea used in this procedure can simultaneously be acted as the plasticizer and cross-linking agent of native starch which can further reinforce the viscosity and film formation properties of the resulted SPC products [14]. However, the current reported methods commonly suffer from harsh preparation conditions and high solvent toxicity which are not conducive to mass scale production for industrial application. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there are rare reports on the investigation of application for encapsulating the urea to prepare the SRU except for the urea plasticized starch as coating materials of urea. In this work, we developed a facile and green approach for modifying the native starch with phosphate and urea via alcohol solvothermal method and in combination with the ethyl cellulose (EC) utilized as the coating matrix of the urea for preparing double layer slow-release fertilizer (SRF). Consecutively, a series of characteristics measurements were performed on the native starch (NS) and the final starch phosphate carbamate (SPC) to confirm the structure and performance variation. Due to the desirable properties such as high viscosity, low gelatinization temperature and water swelling capability of the SPC, the EC/SPC based SRU shows a better slow-release ability both in water and simulated soil assays in comparison with the blank urea and EC and NS coated counterpart (abbreviated as EC/NS based SRU). Furthermore, the SPC itself can also gradually be utilized as a comprehensive SRF due to primary ingredients of C, O, N and P. In conclusion, our present work provided a facile preparation method of SPC and explored its potential application for preparation of SRU in future."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn starch (food grade), Urea (industrial grad, CH4N2O), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4·2H2O), Disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4·2H2O), Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35% for m/m) were purchased from Tianjin Kaitong Chemical Co., Ltd. Anhydrous cupric sulfate (CuSO4), Potassium sulfate (k2SO4), Methyl Red (C15H15N3O2), Methylene blue (C16H24ClN3O3S), 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (C9H11NO) were obtained from Shanghai Rhawn Chemical Co, Ltd. Absolute ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH), Glycerol (C3H8O3), Formaldehyde (CH2O) were provided by Shanghai Aladdin Chemical Co, Ltd. Apart from corn starch and urea, almost all the chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and directly used as received. The used water for preparing solutions and standards were double distilled water. The sandy loam soil was obtained from 0 to 20 cm depth from the experimental farm located on Qiqihar university of Heilongjiang Province in China and pretreated by drying at 80 °C for 5 h in oven, then grinding and finally passing through the 15-mesh sieve."
3,Preparation of starch phosphate carbamides,"2.2 Preparation of starch phosphate carbamides Starch phosphate carbamides (SPC) were prepared via a facile alcohol solvothermal method. Typically, 2.5 g dried corn starch, 0.7 g urea, 0.45 g NaH2PO4·H2O and 0.45 g Na2HPO4·H2O were homogenized by grinding for 30 min in an agate mortar and then transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 15 mL mixed solvents of ethanol and water (7:1, v:v). After the pH was adjusted to 6 with phosphoric acid or sodium hydroxide, the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 130 °C for 9 h. The final product was collected by rinsing three times with ethanol and double distilled water (8:2, v:v) for removing the unreacted urea combined with phosphate and then dried at 50 °C in vacuum after cooling to room temperature."
4,Determination of physicochemical properties of as-prepared SPC,"2.3 Determination of physicochemical properties of as-prepared SPC 2.3.1 Degree of substitution of carbamide groups The content of carbamate groups in the SPC, termed as degree of substitution of carbamide groups (DSc), was determined with the widely used Kjeldahl method (GB/T12091-1989) and the DSc of SPC was calculated by subtracting the content of nitrogen of the NS according to the following formula [15]. It needs to be noticed that all results were performed in triplicate and the data were recorded as a mean. (1) N = 1.401 × T × V 1 − V 0 / m (2) DS c = 162 N / 1000 − 43 N where V 1 and V 0 are the volume of hydrochloric acid consumed by the SPC and NS (mL), m is the mass of the SPC (g), T is the concentration of standard hydrochloric acid aqueous (mol·L−1), N is nitrogen content of carbamic acid (mol·kg−1), DS c is the degree of substitution of carbamate groups in SPC, 162 is the molecular weight of the anhydroglucose unit (g·mol−1) and 43 is the molecular weight of the carbamate group/-CO-NH2 (g·mol−1). 2.3.2 Determination of viscosity For the viscosity measurements, the SPC sample paste was prepared in a glass vessel by heating a SPC slurry in deionized water (1.0%, w:w) at 95 °C for 60 min in a water bath to completely gelatinize and then sonicating for 30 min in a sonifier equipped with a tapered horn tip. An ice-water bath was used to hold the sample container in order to keep a constant temperature in the above sonicating process. Finally, the formed sample was promptly measured with rotational viscometer (RVDV-III +, Olivia). Meanwhile, the NS sample was also prepared and investigated with the above described procedure for comparison. 2.3.3 Gelatinization temperature measurement The gelatinization temperature was determined by conducting the DSC measurement [16]. Typically, 2.5 mg sample (NS or SPC) and 10 μL H2O were sealed in a hermetic aluminum crucible, and then stored at room temperature for 12 h in order to make the water and sample reach a complete equilibration. Afterwards, the DSC curves of the samples were recorded on a differential scanning calorimeter Q20 (TA Instruments, USA) by heating the crucibles from 10 to 100 °C at a rate of 10C/min. Notably, an empty crucible was used as a reference during measurement. The obtained DSC curves were shown in Fig. S1. 2.3.4 Swelling behavior About 0.1 g of dried samples (SPC or NS) were weighed accurately and put into 200-mesh nylon bags, which were immersed in distilled water at 37 °C. After predetermined regular time intervals, the nylon bags were taken out from the distilled water and weighed after wiping surface distilled water with filter paper. The procedure was repeated until swelling equilibrium was reached. The water absorbency W a (g/g) was calculated by the following expression. (3) W a = M 1 − M 0 M 0 where M 1 and M 0 (g) is the weight of swollen and dried SPC or NS at equilibrium, respectively. All the results are recorded by averaging the 3 replicates. 2.3.5 Characterizations The FT-IR infrared spectrum was measured using Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (PE Company, America) at wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm−1 with KBr discs. The XRD patterns were recorded using X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu K X-ray radiation at 60 kV and 80 mA (German Bruker-AXS(D8)). The pH of different solutions was measured and adjusted with a digital pH/ion meter Mettler Seven Compact (S 220-K). Scan electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4300 scanning electron microscope with an operating voltage of 5 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with Al Ka radiation at 300 W. The absorbance results were determined by the TU-1901 UV–vis dual-beam spectrophotometer manufactured by Beijing P&A General Electric Co., Ltd."
5,Preparation of slow-release urea granules encapsulated with NS or SPC,"2.4 Preparation of slow-release urea granules encapsulated with NS or SPC Initially, a uniform hydrophobic slurry with a weight concentration of ~50% was prepared by dispersing 2.125 g ethyecellulose (EC) into a mixed solvent containing glycerol (10 mL) and deionized water (5 mL) together with formaldehyde (3 mL) in a three-necked bottle and vigorously stirring at 80C for ~1 h with a magnetic stirring apparatus. The as-prepared slurry was poured into a beaker and the urea granules with diameter approximately 2–3 mm were sequentially added into the slurry for 2 min with aiming at forming a homogeneous coating layer. Afterwards, based on the previous approach with proper modification, the fresh EC coated urea granules were transferred into a rotating pan in which the SPC was placed in advance [17]. Thereby, the SPC can be adhered on the surface of urea granules acting as the outer-coating layer and then the formed granules were sieved and dried for a short time at 50 °C in an oven. After the above procedures were duplicated for constructing a stable slow-release coating layer, the slow-release urea (SRU) with double coating layer of EC and SPC (named as EC/SPC based SRU) can be obtained by drying the above prepared urea granules at 50 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven. Meanwhile, the native starch (NS) based slow-release urea granules (EC/NS based SRU) were prepared by adopting the same procedure."
6,Release behaviors of as-prepared SRU,"2.5 Release behaviors of as-prepared SRU In present work, the slow-release property of the SRU was simultaneously investigated in water and soil, respectively, and the final results for each of them were collected by uniformly performing the tests in triplicate and averaging the obtained data. 2.5.1 Release behavior of as-prepared SRU in water It needs to be noted that both of the investigated SRU including the EC/NS based SRU and EC/SPC based SRU were prepared with equal amounts of urea (0.1 g) and the pure urea was chosen as the control. Slow-release behavior of as-prepared SRU was initially studied in distilled water. Briefly, the prepared SRU and 5 mL of distilled water were added into dialysis bags, respectively. And then they were transferred to conical flasks containing 200 mL of distilled water. 5 mL aqueous solution was removed from each of the flasks at a certain time interval and then 5 mL of fresh distilled water was replenished to maintain the constant volume [18]. The amount of released urea from pure urea, EC/NS based SRU and EC/SPC based SRU in water at preset time intervals was determined by measuring the absorbance at 400 nm of the urea-PDAB complexation applying Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry which is based on Ehrlich reaction [19]. The conditional experiments for the determination of urea were performed according to the previous methods [20]. 2.5.2 Release behavior of as-prepared SRU in soil The slow-release of the aforementioned SRU was also evaluated in simulated sandy loam soil column. Briefly, three identical simulated soil columns setup were constructed by packing certain quantity of the obtained soil into a glass cylindrical tube with an internal diameter of 10 cm and a height of 50 cm (similar with a burette) in which a layer of cotton was in advance padded at the bottom for preventing the loss of soil and promoting the infiltration of the SRU leachates. Afterwards, these soil columns were sequentially dropwise washed with tap water and double distilled water for each of 10 days in order to removing the soluble materials and then maintained at dried atmosphere for 7 days aiming at removing as much water as possible [21]. Samples identical with the above-mentioned SRU including urea-0.1, NS-urea-0.1 and SPC-urea-0.1 were enclosed into non-woven bag and then placed on the top of as-constructed soil column and then packed with some clean sand to avid the disturbance of water. 50 mL distilled water for each time was slowly dropped into the soil column in a preset time interval for testing the simulative release of SRU in soil. The leachate completely collected from bottom of the soil column was analyzed and applied to determine the amount of released urea according to the above-mentioned method. Additionally, the detailed description on the conditional assays for quantitative analysis of urea and its associated results were shown in Supporting Information."
7,Results and discussion,
8,FT-IR spectra and appearance of the samples,"3.1 FT-IR spectra and appearance of the samples Commonly, the esterification of starch mainly involves acylation of hydroxyl groups of glucose units [22]. Therefore, the synthesized samples were initially evidenced by performing the FT-IR spectroscopy measurements. As observed from the FT-IR spectra of the unesterified NS and esterified SPC shown in Fig. 1(a), the NS exhibits a series of typical IR characteristic bands and peaks. The extremely broad band located at approximately 3500–3200 cm−1 is mainly attributed to the stretching vibration of free, inter- and intra-hydroxy groups (OH) which are composed of the whole structure unit of starch. The bands appeared at 3000–2800 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of CH and a triplet peaks at 1158 cm−1, 1081 cm−1 and 1015 cm−1 primarily correspond to the C-O-C stretching. More interestingly, apart from the characteristic peaks for the starch backbone, the as-prepared SPC displays some new absorption signals at 1705 cm−1, 1380 cm−1, 1015 cm−1 and 942 cm−1, illustrating the presence of CO, PO, P-O-C and P-O-H groups in the molecular structure of the SPC, respectively. Quite obviously, these new absorption bands substantially elucidated that the esterified starch adduct, namely SPC, was successfully synthesized [23]. Furthermore, Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the photographs of the ground NS and SPC, respectively. We can clearly see that the NS exhibits nearly white color and whereas the SPC shows a brown color. According to the previous reports, this significant color variation also provides an indirect demonstration for the formation of SPC [24]."
9,Esterification reaction mechanism,"3.2 Esterification reaction mechanism Based on confirmation in above FT-IR spectra measurement and previous literature, Fig. 2 presumably provides the possible formation of starch ester complexes in present work. Initially, the urea generally decomposed into ammonia and isocyanic acid owing to the disproportionation reaction at ~133 °C. Then the phosphorylation and carbamoylation of starch gave rise to the formation of the starch derivatives mainly due to the dehydration reaction between the OH of the formed isocyanic acid and/or phosphate together with the OH groups of the AGUs of starch [25]. Owing to the chemical heterogeneity for the initial reactants, the resulted starch derivatives probably included not only the starch phosphate carbamides (A), starch carbamate monoesters (B) and starch phosphate monoesters (C) but also the starch phosphoric amides (D) and starch carbamoyl phosphates adducts (E) primarily due to the interaction between isocyanic acid and phosphate. Thus the SPC could be a mixture system including at least 5 components, which is good accordance with the previous reports [26]."
10,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.3 X-ray diffraction (XRD) For further exploring the effect of the esterification reaction on the crystal structure of starch, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to investigate the NS and SPC samples and Fig. 3 displays the XRD patterns. Quite obviously, four significant diffraction peaks at 2θ angle around 15.28°, 17.24°, 18.15° and 22.91° can easily be recognized in the XRD pattern of the NS sample, indicating that the starch is a typical A-type crystallization demonstrated in previous work [27,28]. As for the esterified SPC sample, a significant decrease of the crystallinity, mainly embodied in a reduction of the corresponding diffraction peaks intensity, proves that the starch granules indeed suffer from relative variation after esterification reaction happening. Furthermore, the appearance of some new diffraction peaks at 2θ of 8.08°, 13.32° and 20.16° further indicate that the esterification reaction can not only destroy the structure of the original starch to a certain extent but also form a new structure for the synthesized SPC."
11,Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS),"3.4 Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) Fig. 4 shows the SEM and the EDS elemental mapping images of the control NS and esterified SPC. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 4(a) and (c), the NS granules exhibit quasi round or oval spherical shape with various particle size and smooth surface without any voids [29]. After esterification, the surface of SPC granules shown in Fig. 4(b) and (d) suffered from slight corrosion and destruction and therefore showed significantly irregular granular morphology with surface dents, cracks and even particle rupture. Quite obviously, this inside and surface erosion of the starch granules indicates that the esterification reaction not only occurs in the amorphous region of the starch, but also has a certain effect on the structure of the crystalline region, which is in good coincidence with the above XRD measurement results [30]. Additionally, as observed from Fig. 4(e–h), the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of esterified SPC demonstrated that the SPC specimen is primarily composed of four uniformly distributed chemical elements including C, O, N and P. Apparently, except for the C and O elements which is the main compositional ingredients of native starch (NS), the N and P elements are mainly introduced by the esterification reaction."
12,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"3.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) In addition, the NS and esterified SPC were further investigated by performing the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement and Fig. 5 shows the corresponding XPS spectra. We can see from Fig. 5(a) that the XPS survey spectrum of NS displays two distinct peaks located at 284.7 eV and 531.5 eV which are attributed to the characteristic peak of C1s and O1s, indicating that the NS is mainly composed of C and O elements [31]. Conversely, as shown in Fig. 5(b), besides the C1s and O1s characteristic peaks, the XPS survey spectrum of SPC shows other peaks such as P2p allocated at 191.3 eV and 134.2 eV and N1s located at 402.3 eV, respectively, revealing that the phosphate and urea is effectively incorporated with native starch during the esterification reaction, which makes the esterified SPC be composed of four kinds of main elements including C, O, N and P. In addition, the high resolution XPS spectra of C1s, O1s, N1s and P2p of the SPC are presented in Fig. 5(c–f). After deconvolution by means of the least-squares peak analysis software (XPSPEAK version 4.1), the P2p spectrum can be resolved into three peaks at binding energy of 133.5 eV, 134.2 eV and 134.9 eV, indicating the presence of P-O-H, P-O-C and PO chemical bonds in the molecular structure of SPC. Meanwhile, the C1s, N1s and O1s high resolution spectra are also divided into three peaks located at various binding energy, respectively [32]. These further verified the presence of different chemical groups for each of the elements, such as, CO, CO, CC, NP, NC, NH. In conclude, the above investigations and analyses of the XPS spectra powerfully demonstrated the successful formation of the SPC. Furthermore, through integrating the intensity of the XPS peaks, the surface element atomic percentage for the NS and SPC specimens was calculated and summarized in Table 1 . As can be seen, the NS is primarily composed of C with percentage of 62.8% and O up to 35.4%, whereas the compositional percentage of C, O, N and P regarding the SPC sample are 37.8%, 43.4%, 3.37% and 8.16%, respectively."
13,Other properties of the SPC,"3.6 Other properties of the SPC In view of the above-confirmed successful esterification of the NS by phosphate and urea, the impact of esterification reaction on the associated properties of starch were in detail compared and Table 1 partly listed the values including degree of substitution (DS), gelatinization temperature (GT), viscosity and water retention value (WRV), all of which are great important factors for the application of urea coating. As shown in Table 1, compared with the higher GT of up to 83 °C and lower viscosity of only 120 ± 5 mPa·s−1 of the NS, the obtained SPC with a DS of 0.27 shows a GT of even lower than 10 °C, higher viscosity of 480 ± 7 mPa·s−1 and desirable WRV of 210%, indicating that the esterification reaction can reduce the gelatinization temperature and enhance the viscosity as well as the water retention capability. Furthermore, According to the previous reports, these properties will be benefit for the application of urea coating [33]."
14,Release behaviors of SPC coated urea,"3.7 Release behaviors of SPC coated urea Based on the above-confirmed outstanding properties of the formed SPC, the double layer slow-release urea (SRU) was prepared by adopting the EC and SPC or NS as the inner and outer coating layer materials and the slow-release behavior was simultaneously investigated in diluted water and simulated soil column assay [34]. Fig. 6 shows the photographs of the as-prepared EC/SPC based SRU and the slow-release behavior profiles varying with time in water at room temperature. As easily be observed from Fig. 6(a), the formed EC/SPC based SRU with a core-shell structure exhibited a brownish black color and have a granule diameter size of ca. 4 mm, whereas the pure urea showed a bright white and have a particle diameter size approximately 2.5 mm. Additionally, from the slow-release behaviors profiles shown in Fig. 6(b), we can observe that the pure urea rapidly dissolved in water entirely within an experimental time interval of 2 h due to its high solubility. In addition, when the pure urea was encapsulated with coating materials (EC in combination with NS or SPC), both of the formed double-layer SRUs exhibited boosted release behaviors with reduced release rate and prolonged release time compared with that of the pure urea. By further comparison, the EC/SPC based SRU had a slower cumulative release rates of 8.1%, 13.8%, 40.9% within time interval of 2, 4 and 12 h, respectively. In contrast, the cumulative release rates of the EC/NS based SRU were approximately 46.3%, 80.1.%, 95.3%, respectively. These indicate that the prepared SPC is a desirable coating material for the preparation of SRU and the improvement on the slow-release behavior of the SRU may be primarily attributed to the enhanced properties of the esterified starch. In view of the enhanced slow-release capacity of the EC/SPC based SRU in water compared with that of the counterparts, the cumulative release behaviors of pure urea, EC/NS based SRU and EC/SPC based SRU in soil were further evaluated and compared Fig. 7 presents the used soil columns photograph and the release curves varying with time at room temperature. As can be seen in Fig. 7(a), the used soil columns were glass cylindrical tube with an internal diameter of 10 cm and a height of 50 cm in which the collected sandy loam soil samples were filled with a height of 30 cm. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the whole release behaviors for both of the pure urea, EC/NS based SRU and EC/SPC based SRU in the soil are significantly superior than that in water because the lower free water content in the soil decreases the dissolution of the urea core, thereby reducing the release rate and extending the release period. The release percentage of pure urea in soil reached to as high as 98% within 24 h. As well, the EC/NS based SRU also display an undesirable release performance with an almost complete release merely 10 days in soil. Oppositely, the EC/SPC based SRU has a better release property with a longer release period more than 30 days. The release percentages of EC/SPC based SRU within 5, 10 and 20 days were about 12.4%, 22.1%, 59.6%, respectively. Obviously, the diffusion of urea from the coating layers into outside can be effectively retarded, and the sustained release property of the SRU can thereby be significantly improved because the higher viscosity of SPC can make the starch coating more tightly connected [35]. On the basis of the above investigation, we conclusively suggest that both of the SPC and EC were crucial for altering the nutrient release behaviors of the SRU. Fig. 8 schematically displays the possible mechanism of slow-release process for the EC/SPC based SRU. Initially, due to the amphipathicity and tiny porosity of the coating, the water molecular penetrates into the interlayer spaces through SPC coating as the first barrier. Sequentially, the penetrated water molecular infiltrates into the hydrophobic inner layer of ethyecellulose (EC) which acts as the second wall-like barrier inside against the water penetration and finally dissolves the soluble urea granules. Finally, the dissolved urea diffuses out of the SRU granules through the double layer barriers and enters into the plant growth medium, indicating the accomplishment of the urea slow-release. Furthermore, the primary composition elements of the coating materials (SPC or EC) are C, O, N and P, which can also be taken up and utilized by the plant after mineralization and humification."
15,Conclusions,"In summary, a category of esterification modified natural starch (SPC) with phosphate and urea was developed and creatively utilized as outer coating material together with ethyl cellulose as inner coating material for preparing double layer SRU. The formed SPC was initially investigated by performing the FT-IR, XRD, SEM, XPS measurements. The FT-IR results demonstrated the successful introduction of new groups in the molecular structure of the starch such as CO, PO, P-O-C and P-O-H. The XRD and SEM results indicated that the esterification reaction can not only lead to the slight corrosion and destruction for the starch surface morphology but also destroy the crystal structure. More importantly, this esterification reaction can significantly result in a higher viscosity of 480 mPa.s−1 and lower gelatinization temperature of under 10 °C for the formed SPC than that of the unmodified native starch. Furthermore, compared with the pure urea, the prepared EC/PSC based SRU had a desirable slow-release behavior with release percentages of 40.9% for 12 h in water and merely 59.6% for 20 day together with even exceeding 30 days in soil. Conclusively, our present work provides a facile preparation approach for the SPC and corresponding application as a coating material of the SRU."
