0,Introduction,"There have been intensive efforts toward the development of technologies for the sustainable production of hydrogen from renewable resources, mainly water and biomass, to boost the use of hydrogen as energy carrier for meeting future fuel needs with no carbon footprint [1]. These include steam reforming of biomass components [2,3], water splitting [4,5], and dark fermentation [6] routes. Photocatalytic H2 production over irradiated semiconductors is receiving particular attention because of based on the Sun, which is a perpetual source of energy, and it is an environmentally safe technology without undesirable byproducts. Initially, electron–hole pairs are generated in semiconductors upon bandgap excitation. Depending on the excitation lifetime relative to that of charge recombination, a net fraction of photocharges are present, which are trapped at defect sites or migrate toward the photocatalyst surface. These surface electrons and holes can reduce and oxidize surface adsorbed molecules, respectively. The structural and electronic properties of semiconductor photocatalysts largely determine the photocatalytic H2 production and numerous nanostructures and hybrid assemblies have been proposed [7–9]. TiO2-based photocatalysts are among the most attractive due to their availability, corrosion resistance, non-toxicity, low price and high photoactivity and stability. The biggest disadvantage of TiO2 is the low utilization of visible light, as a consequence of its wide bandgap. Incorporating organics such as carboxylic acids, alcohols and carbohydrates as sacrificial electron donors into the photocatalytic process increase charge-separation efficiency and give higher H2 generation rates [10,11]. The rate of hydrogen evolution is much higher, compared to that obtained in the absence of organics in the irradiated photocatalyst, due to the irreversible oxidation of the organic molecule with photogenerated holes and the concomitant suppression of electron–hole recombination and H2–O2 back reaction, which are the most important processes for decreasing the light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. Among the most promising hole scavengers is ethanol because it is readily available, easy to obtain from biomass (bioethanol) and to transport, CO2-neutral and safe to handle [2]. The effect of the addition of noble metal nanoparticles (the so-called cocatalyst) to TiO2 is well known as it considerably increases the hydrogen production rate. Deposition of Au nanoparticles onto TiO2 has been found to enhance hydrogen production by facilitating electron transfer and therefore inhibiting electron–hole recombination as well as by reducing the overpotentials for H2 generation [11–13]. Au/TiO2 has also the ability to increase the photoresponse of TiO2 to visible light because of the Au surface plasmon band at 500–600nm (localized surface plasmon resonance effect, LSPR). Au nanoparticle size, dispersion, loading, and metal–support interaction all play critical roles in determining the photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO2 with all these parameters depending on the catalyst preparation methods [14,15]. Another important parameter is the polymorphism of the TiO2 support; for Au loaded onto rutile, hydrogen production is about two orders of magnitude lower than that on anatase due to the greater charge recombination rate of rutile as compared to anatase [16]. On the contrary, support particle size is not an important parameter for Au/TiO2 photocatalysis [17]. It is important to stress out that, whereas material development constitutes an active area of research, it represents only one of the key elements of a photocatalytic system [18]. Designing a functional photocatalytic system for practical application requires an integrated approach involving engineering photon delivery in proper photoreactors as well as optimum mass transfer. No matter how active a photocatalyst, if photons are not effectively transmitted to its surface then its full potential will not be reached and system efficiency will be lowered. For instance, slurry photoreactors, which are the most used in photocatalysis research, facilitate mass transfer, but they are limited by poor light penetration in the suspension (the irradiance of light decreases inversely with the square of distance from the source). The major parameter that is currently assessed with respect to illumination is the amount of illuminated surface per unit of volume inside the reactor, but this parameter does not take into account other aspects related to illumination, such as the ratio incident/emitted light power and the uniformity of light incidence [18]. In many photoreactor designs (slurry reactors, annular reactors, spinning disk reactors, optical tube reactors and immersion reactors), the light has to travel through the fluid or gas containing reagents and also through a transparent wall. In addition, it is very difficult to achieve uniform irradiance on the entire catalyst surface, which is critical because a minimum energy level is needed to activate the photocatalyst. Once the photocatalyst is activated, maximized contact between the photocatalyst and reagents should be achieved, as well as the removal of the reaction products formed. An ideally intensified photoreactor should be able to integrate both maximized light efficiency and mass transfer simultaneously. One of the main developments in improving illumination efficiency has been the introduction of optical fibers [19–21]. In an optical fiber reactor, the photocatalyst is typically coated on the fibers, where light is propagated along the fiber length by reflection on the fiber wall. However, one problem is that light intensity decays exponentially along the axial direction of the coated fiber and that the amount of refraction in the fiber depends on the thickness of the photocatalyst coating. Another problem with coated optical fibers is that the charge carriers (electrons and holes) are generated far from the interface between the photocatalyst and the reagents (because of the back-irradiation) and, consequently, are more susceptible to recombination loss. Recently, a substantial improvement has been reached in the field of water/air treatment by designing optical fiber honeycomb reactors, where the photocatalyst is immobilized on the monolith wall [22–24]. With this configuration, high light efficiency and availability combined with optimum mass transfer and scale-up potential can be achieved. In this work, the dynamic hydrogen production from water–ethanol mixtures is investigated in an optical fiber reactor over Au/TiO2 immobilized on ceramic monoliths. Several operational parameters have been studied, such as photocatalyst loading on the monolith wall, water–ethanol ratio, temperature, residence time, and gaseous vs. liquid feed. In order to avoid undesirable effects originating from catalyst preparation we have used dendrimer-protected pre-formed Au nanoparticles to ensure a constant Au nanoparticle size [25] and to prevent Au agglomeration [26]. The influence of Au loading on hydrogen photoproduction has also been explored."
1,Experimental section,
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation Cordierite (Al4Mg2Si5O18) honeycombs (Rauschert, 100 cells per square inch, pore volume 210±30mm3 g−1, average pore diameter 3±1.5μm) measuring 16mm in diameter and 20mm length were obtained by cutting larger pieces with a diamond saw. They contained exactly 21square channels with 2.1mm channel width. The photocatalyst used was Au/TiO2 and the preparation of the photocatalytic monoliths involved two steps. First, the honeycombs were coated with a pure TiO2 layer by soaking them into pure titanium isopropoxide, Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4. Different TiO2 loadings were achieved by blowing with dry air the titania precursor. Honeycombs were then dried under continuous rotation for 30min at room temperature followed by 30min at 393K. Finally, they were calcined at 723K for 4h (10Kmin−1). Titania mass was monitored by weight gain and ranged from ca. 5 to 100mg. Gold nanoparticles were loaded onto the TiO2 layer by incipient wetness impregnation from a toluene solution containing pre-formed Au nanoparticles measuring ca. 2.5nm and capped with thiol-derived carboxilane dendrons HS(CH2)3Si((CH2)3Si(CH3)3)3, which were prepared as reported previously [25]. The Au loading was varied between 0.5 and 2wt.% with respect to TiO2. Honeycombs were finally calcined at 673K for 2h (2Kmin−1) to eliminate the carboxilane dendron shell and to assure a tight contact between the Au nanoparticles and the TiO2 support. This temperature was selected following a detailed in situ XPS and HRTEM study reported in [27]. After calcination the monoliths exhibited the characteristic purple color of Au/TiO2 containing small Au nanoparticles, with the purple coloration intensifying with Au loading."
3,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.2 Photocatalyst characterization The photocatalytic Au/TiO2 cordierite honeycombs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and focus ion beam (FIB), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), UV–Vis spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). SEM–EDX–FIB was carried out with a Zeiss NEON40 crossbeam instrument. XRD patterns were collected between 10° and 90° of 2θ with a step width of 0.02° and a step time of 1s using a Bruker D8 instrument equipped with Cu Kα incident radiation and a graphite monochromator. HRTEM was carried out with a JEOL J2010F electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun operating at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. Samples were dispersed in alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, and a drop of supernatant suspension was poured onto a holey carbon coated grid. UV–Vis reflectance spectra were collected with a Shimadzu UV3600 UV–Vis–NIR spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere. XPS was performed on a SPECS system equipped with an Al anode XR50 source operating at 200mW and a Phoibos 150 MCD-9 detector. The pass energy of the hemispherical analyzer was set at 25eV and the energy step was set at 0.1eV. Charge stabilization was achieved by using a SPECS Flood Gun FG 15/40. The binding energy (BE) values were referred to the C 1s peak at 284.8eV. Surface area measurements (BET) of the TiO2 powders were carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus after degassing at 443K. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD-MS) was conducted in a Catalyst Analyzer Belcat-M instrument coupled to a Cirrus MKS mass spectrometer equipped with a multiplier detector."
4,Photoreaction experiments,"2.3 Photoreaction experiments The optical fiber catalytic wall reactor used in this work was specifically designed and constructed by us and was inspired by the work of Mul et al. [22,23]. The light source was manufactured by Sacopa S.A.U. and consisted of four high efficiency UV LEDs emitting at a wavelength of 365±5nm (12W, 0.7A) coupled to a bunch of optical fibers (Fig. 1 ). The optical fibers measured 0.8mm in diameter and ca. 10cm in length and were made of PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)). The fibers were originally coated to avoid light losses, so that they were treated individually to obtain lateral irradiation exactly where the monoliths were placed. To attain uniform illumination, the end of the optical fibers was capped with a zinc-based paint to attain back-reflection of light. The photoreactor casing was made of glass (Trallero and Schlee S.L.) and consisted of two pieces sealed by an O-ring that allowed an easy exchange of the photocatalytic monoliths (Fig. 1). It allowed working with gaseous and liquid reactants and the placement of a thermocouple inside the photocatalytic monolith. In a typical experiment, the optical fibers were inserted into the channels of the photocatalytic monolith inside the photoreactor. Then, the system was purged with Ar and the gaseous reactants were introduced continuously by bubbling Ar through a saturator containing ethanol and water (HPLC grade). Several ethanol–water gaseous mixtures were tested (100%, 80%, 50%, 30%, 10%, 1% and 0% ethanol on a molar basis). Experiments were carried out at 298, 323 and 348K and at different residence times, between 300 and 2100h−1 VHSV (volume hourly space velocity). The photoreactor effluent was monitored online every 1.5min by gas chromatography (Agilent 3000 A MicroGC) using MS 5Å, Plot U and Stabilwax columns. Light irradiation was measured with a UV-A radiation monitor from Solar Light Co. before and after each photocatalytic test and was maintained constant within 3% error. The integral value measured for each individual fiber was about 0.2mWcm2. Blank experiments were carried out with the cordierite monolith support and no photoactivity was measured. For comparative purposes, photoreactions were also carried out in liquid phase in batch mode (10mL) in the presence of a photocatalytic monolith or with photocatalyst powder to simulate a slurry reactor operation. In these experiments, agitation was provided by bubbling Ar through the liquid inside the photoreactor."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst loading,"3.1 Catalyst loading In the optical fiber honeycomb photoreactor, the light is irradiated laterally from the optical fibers to the inner walls of the cordierite monolith coated with the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst. Therefore, for an optimum configuration, it is important to assess the thickness of the photocatalytic layer, since a low photocatalyst loading will result in low efficiency on a photoreactor volume basis whereas an excess of photocatalyst will have an undesirable effect on photoreactor cost. In our photoreactor, the light intensity irradiated for each fiber is about 0.2mWcm2, and the nominal distance between the surface of the fiber and the honeycomb walls is between 0.7 and 1.1mm. We have prepared and characterized a series of photocatalytic monoliths with different Au/TiO2 loading (1wt.% Au), from 0.11 to 2.90mgcm2 (4.6–122mg of photocatalyst), and tested them in the photoproduction of hydrogen with pure ethanol (30μmolEtOHmin−1) at VHSV=300h−1. The thickness of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst layer was obtained directly from SEM images as well as from FIB cuts (Fig. 2 a and b). XRD profiles showed the presence of both anatase and rutile with a ratio of anatase:rutile∼93:7, as determined according to the method described in [28]. The BET surface area of the TiO2 coatings was 41±6m2 g−1. The microstructure of the catalyst layer was studied by HRTEM and HAADF. As expected, in all cases, the photocatalysts were constituted by anatase and rutile crystallites of about 20–40nm and Au nanoparticles measuring 3.9±0.8nm in diameter (Fig. 2d). This is slightly larger than the size of Au nanoparticles capped with carboxilane dendrons in the precursor solution (Fig. 2c) as a result of the calcination treatment, in accordance with [27]. Concerning UV–Vis reflectance spectra, all samples showed a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au nanoparticles supported on TiO2 at about 567nm, which is fairly similar to values reported in the literature for Au nanoparticles measuring 3–5nm supported on anatase [12]. The homogeneity in size and good dispersion of the Au nanoparticles merits to be highlighted, which are a direct consequence of the preparation method employed. As it can be inferred from Fig. 3 a, there is a good relationship between photocatalyst loading and photocatalyst layer thickness onto the monolith walls, which is approximately linear in the range studied. To ensure a proper comparison of the photocatalytic data of the different monoliths, the surface atomic Au/Ti ratio was recorded by means of XPS for all of them (Fig. 3b). The Au/Ti ratio was maintained approximately constant for photocatalyst loadings up to 2.1mgcm2 with a value of about 0.0021–0.0026. In contrast, for the highest loading tested, 2.9mgcm−2, the Au/Ti ratio increased significantly up to 0.0034. Taking into account that the Au nanoparticle size was constant for all samples, this means that the preparation method used for incorporating the pre-formed Au nanoparticles onto the TiO2 support was totally reproducible at moderate loadings (at least up to 2.1mgcm2), whereas for higher loadings, the impregnation of the Au nanoparticles into the TiO2 pores was not completely homogeneous, and they accumulated at the surface of the photocatalyst. In all cases, the Au 4f core-level spectra were identical and the binding energies recorded at 83.7–84eV (Au 4f7/2) and 87.2–87.5eV (Au 4f5/2) indicated that metallic Au was the only gold species on the near surface region of the photocatalysts. Fig. 3c and d shows the photocatalytic results in terms of hydrogen produced at steady state at different photocatalyst loadings. Besides hydrogen, the only product detected was acetaldehyde. When the results are plotted considering the weight of photocatalyst (Fig. 3c), higher intrinsic H2 production rates are obtained at low loadings. Interestingly, there is a strong exponential decay of the H2 production rate when the thickness of the photocatalytic layer increases in accordance with the light irradiance decay expected within the photocatalyst layer. However, when the net amount of H2 produced is plotted against the photocatalyst loading (Fig. 3d), a new scenario appears. The amount of photoproduced H2 increased sharply with photocatalyst loadings up to 0.57mgcm2, whereas for higher photocatalyst loadings, the net production of hydrogen remained essentially constant. Therefore, from the information gathered from Fig. 3c and d, it is concluded that there is certainly an optimum photocatalyst loading depending on light penetration and photocatalyst characteristics in an optical fiber monolith photoreactor. In our case, the optimum photocatalyst loading is about 0.5–0.6mgcm2, which corresponds to a photocatalytic layer thickness around 1μm. In this case, ca . 10 - 5 mol H 2 min - 1 g cat - 1 are obtained under steady-state conditions. For lower photocatalyst loadings, part of the light irradiated by the optical fibers is not fully used, whereas for thicker photocatalytic layers, the light is fully absorbed before reaching all the photocatalyst particles. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for hydrogen photogeneration can be accurately determined around the plateau onset in Fig. 3d, where optimal light absorption is ensured as well as operation in a non-diffusion-limited regime [29,30]. Assuming that two photons are required for liberation of one hydrogen molecule, AQE was calculated from the ratio of the double amount of H2 (r H2, 0.25μmolH2 min−1) and the overall amount of photons irradiated by the optical fibers (Nλ , 2.4μmolphotonsmin−1) using the equation AQE=(2r H2/Nλ )·100 [31]. The AQE value in our photocatalytic system was 20.8%. The efficiency of light-to-chemical energy conversion, defined as the energy stored as hydrogen (r H2·ΔH c,H2, where ΔH c,H2 is the heating value of hydrogen, 285.8kJmol−1) divided by the incident photon energy (13.2mW), is about 9%."
7,Reaction temperature,"3.2 Reaction temperature In order to infer on adsorption/desorption effects on the photogenerated H2 rate, a series of experiments were performed at various temperatures (298, 323, and 348K) over photocatalytic monoliths with ca. 0.5mgcm2 Au/TiO2 loading (1wt.% Au) using a water–ethanol mixture of H2O:EtOH=9:1 molar at VHSV=300h−1. At 298K (room temperature), the products analyzed were H2, CH3CHO, CO2 and trace amounts of CH3COCH3. No CO, CH4, C2+, CH3COOH or other oxygenates were detected. At 323 and 348K, the only products detected were exclusively H2, CH3CHO, and CO2. Fig. 4 shows the concentration of the different species at the initial steps of the photoreaction, at steady state, and after light shut down for the three temperatures tested. At 298K (Fig. 4a), hydrogen concentration increased sharply when the light was turned on and then decreased considerably until steady state was attained after ca. 15min. The concentration of acetaldehyde, in contrast, increased slowly during the first ca. 15min and then decreased smoothly. Carbon dioxide appeared at the same time that acetaldehyde and remained constant. Small amounts of dimethyl ketone appeared after ca. 15min of reaction, at the same time when the concentration of acetaldehyde started to decline. When the light was turned off, the concentration of hydrogen rapidly went to zero, whereas those of acetaldehyde, CO2, and dimethyl ketone vanished much more slowly. As reported elsewhere [11,12], following electron–hole formation upon light irradiation in the photocatalyst, adsorbed ethanol is likely oxidized into acetaldehyde by surface trapped holes h tr + : (1) 2 h tr + + C 2 H 5 OH → 2 H + + CH 3 CHO Electrons are trapped at Au nanoparticles, e−(Autr), where they reduce and recombine protons to produce H2 gas as follows: (2) 2 e - ( Au tr ) + 2 H + → H 2 In the presence of water, photo-induced reforming of adsorbed acetaldehyde may explain the formation of carbon dioxide [10]: (3) CH 3 CHO + 3 H 2 O → 5 H 2 + 2 CO 2 and dimethyl ketone is likely the result of the condensation of acetaldehyde over basic centers of TiO2 [32]: (4) 2 CH 3 CHO + H 2 O → 5 H 2 + CO 2 + CH 3 COCH 3 The absence of methane and C2 among the reaction products rules out the photo-Kolbe reaction. The fact that the concentration of acetaldehyde increased slower than that of hydrogen at the initial stage of the photoreaction (first 1–6min in Fig. 4a) and disappeared later (min 34–36 in Fig. 4a) and much slowly when the light was turned off suggests that acetaldehyde was strongly adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface at room temperature. This was checked by TPD-MS after light shut down. Chemisorbed ethanol desorbed in small amounts at about 425–540K, whereas large amounts of acetaldehyde desorbed at 560–680K. Similar acetaldehyde accumulation has been already reported to occur during the photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol on TiO2 [33,34]. Also, when the light was turned off and the reactant mixture was replaced by pure Ar to remove ethanol and physically adsorbed acetaldehyde, and then, the light was turned on again, hydrogen was readily photoproduced from chemisorbed acetaldehyde on the photocatalyst surface. In the photocatalytic test, the evolution of CO2 followed that of acetaldehyde, in accordance with the reaction scheme outlined above (Eq. (3)). Similarly, dimethyl ketone formed at the expenses of acetaldehyde (Eq. (4)) since the appearance of trace amounts of dimethyl ketone at ca. min 15 coincides with the smooth decline on acetaldehyde concentration (min 15 in Fig. 4a). At steady state, the concentration of H2 was approximately the sum of CH3CHO (Eqs. (1) and (2)) and that corresponding to Eqs. (3) and (4) taking into account the amount of CO2 and CH3COCH3, which means that the reaction scheme outlined above accounts for all observed products and their respective concentrations (within 10% error). It is not straightforward to explain why the hydrogen concentration increased initially up to ca. 8μmolmin−1 g−1 and then decreased to 4.8±0.2μmolmin−1 g−1 at steady state. One possible explanation is that the hydrogen evolution sites in the photocatalyst (Eq. (2)) are affected by acetaldehyde adsorption, which might imply that close sites are involved in Eqs. (1) and (2) of the photoprocess. This is supported by the observation that acetaldehyde concentration increased fast approximately at the same time that hydrogen concentration started to decline (min 4–12 in Fig. 4a). In fact, ethanol is preferentially adsorbed on the TiO2 surface rather than on the metal surface due to the stronger heat of adsorption of the oxide when compared to those on metals [34,35], but for an efficient reaction to occur the adsorption site should be at the interface between Au and the support to facilitate proton transport from TiO2 to Au nanoparticles. When the temperature of the photocatalytic monolith was increased to 323 and 348K (Fig. 4b and c, respectively), important differences were observed with respect to the photoreaction carried out at room temperature. Again, at 323K, the concentration of H2 increased sharply and then decreased, but much less than that observed at 298K. The concentration of acetaldehyde increased faster than that at 298K and was maintained constant. No dimethyl ketone was detected, so the concentration of acetaldehyde did not decline with time on stream. When the light was turned off, the concentration of H2 and CO2 vanished immediately, whereas that of acetaldehyde again decreased slowly, but much faster that that recorded at room temperature. This indicates that acetaldehyde adsorption strength on the photocatalyst surface was less important at 323K than at 298K, as expected. The higher desorption rate of acetaldehyde would prevent the formation of dimethyl ketone. At 323K, the H2 photoproduction rate at steady state was 6.2±0.2μmolmin−1 g−1, which is about 30% higher than that recorded at 298K (4.8±0.2μmolmin−1 g−1). Then, the beneficial effect of temperature on the photoproduction of H2 could be likely related to a weaker adsorption of acetaldehyde on the photocatalyst surface, which in turn would unblock the active sites for Eqs. (1) and (2). The positive effect of temperature on the photoproduction of H2 was confirmed when the photoreaction was performed at 348K (Fig. 4c). At this temperature, the increase in hydrogen, acetaldehyde, and carbon dioxide concentrations was almost parallel, and when the light was turned off the acetaldehyde concentration decreased faster. At this temperature, the H2 photoproduction rate at steady state increased up to 8.0±0.2μmolmin−1 g−1. On the other hand, the CO2 photoproduction rate at 348K (1.3±0.1μmolmin−1 g−1) was higher than that at 323 and 298K (0.7±0.1 and 0.5±0.1μmolmin−1 g−1, respectively), suggesting that the photo-reforming of acetaldehyde (Eq. (3)) is strongly influenced by the temperature of the photocatalyst. The apparent activation energy for the photogeneration of hydrogen can be calculated from the slope of ln(H2 rate) as a function of 1/T (K−1) from the steady-state values shown in Fig. 4, and it is 30.3±0.5kJmol−1. This value is significantly higher than the activation energies reported for Pd/TiO2 (10.5kJmol−1) and Pt/TiO2 (15.5kJmol−1) [36], in accordance with the occurrence of adsorption phenomena in our system as discussed previously. The activation energy calculated from ln(CO2 rate) is 56.5±0.5kJmol−1, which accounts for the higher energy required to perform the photo-reforming of acetaldehyde."
8,Contact time,"3.3 Contact time The effect of contact time was studied over a photocatalytic monolith with 0.5mgcm2 Au/TiO2 loading (1wt.% Au) using a water–ethanol mixture of H2O:EtOH=9:1 molar at 298K by varying the VHSV between 300 and 2100h−1. The hydrogen photoproduction rate results are shown in Fig. 5 . As explained in Section 3.2, when the photoreaction was carried out at VHSV=300h−1, there was a strong transient period in the photoproduction of H2 before a steady-state regime was attained, which has been related to competition between acetaldehyde adsorption and hydrogen evolution on the photocatalyst surface. However, when the contact time was reduced by increasing the VHSV up to 900h−1, the transient period decreased considerably, and at 1500h−1, it almost disappeared. This is a further indication that acetaldehyde adsorption plays an important role in the photoprocess, since product desorption is facilitated at high flow rates, which in turn should decrease or even suppress the transient period of H2 evolution, as it is observed in Fig. 5. Steady states were maintained constant in extended tests over periods up to 24h. The steady-state photoproduction rate of H2 was maintained approximately constant for VHSV values up to 1800h−1; in fact, the rate increased slightly as the VHSV increased (from 4.8±0.2μmolH2 min−1 g−1 at 300h−1 to 5.1±0.2μmolH2 min−1 g−1 at 1800h−1), which again reflects a positive effect of short contact times on the photoreaction by decreasing acetaldehyde coverage on the photocatalyst surface. Also, the approximate constant H2 photoreaction rate at VHSV values up to 1800h−1 demonstrates the absence of mass transfer limitations in the photoreactor under these conditions. At 2100h−1, however, the photoproduction rate of H2 decreased, imposing a limit on the photoreactor optimum operational conditions."
9,Water to ethanol ratio and gold content,"3.4 Water to ethanol ratio and gold content A set of experiences were carried out systematically with different water–ethanol mixtures and Au contents maintaining a constant TiO2 load in the photocatalytic monoliths of 0.5mgcm2 and VHSV=900h−1 to study the effect of the H2O:EtOH ratio and the Au loading on the photoproduction of hydrogen under strictly the same operational conditions. As already explained, the use of dendron-capped, pre-formed Au nanoparticles ensures that all photocatalysts contain Au nanoparticles with the same particle size, so a direct comparison among the performance of the different photocatalytic monoliths can be performed. Fig. 6 shows the results attained at steady state. In all cases, the higher the ethanol content in the reactant mixture, the higher the photoproduction of hydrogen and the lower the photoproduction rate of CO2. The increase in the photoproduction of H2 when the partial pressure of ethanol increases was particularly important for Au loadings of 1wt.% and higher, whereas for the photocatalytic monolith with 0.5wt. Au, the amount of H2 was similar for mixtures containing between 50% and 100% ethanol (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, the photoproduction of H2 at low ethanol partial pressure (water–ethanol mixture with 1% ethanol on a molar basis) was similar for all the photocatalytic monoliths tested, about 4–5μmolmin−1 g−1. These observations suggest that there is a relationship between electron trapping by Au nanoparticles with subsequent H2 evolution (Eq. (2)) and hole scavenging by ethanol on the photocatalyst surface (Eq. (1)). In other words, at low ethanol partial pressure, the photoreaction is governed by the interaction of holes and adsorbed ethanol molecules, whereas high ethanol partial pressure facilitates the formation of more H+ species (Eq. (1)) by suppressing electron–hole recombination, and therefore, there are more electrons to be trapped in Au nanoparticles to yield H2 (Eq. (2)). According to this, the photoproduction of acetaldehyde followed that of hydrogen. In the case of 0.5% Au/TiO2, the increase in ethanol partial pressure was not accompanied by an increase in Au nanoparticles; therefore, no more H2 could be generated. The maximum H2 photogenerated rates were obtained with photocatalytic monoliths 1wt.% Au/TiO2 and 1.5wt.% Au/TiO2 (Fig. 6b and c, respectively). The H2 photoproduction rate obtained over sample 2% Au/TiO2 was lower, suggesting that an excess of Au nanoparticles is detrimental for hole scavenging by ethanol on TiO2. These results are in agreement with those reported by other authors on Au/TiO2 systems [12,14,31], where noble metal loadings of about 1–2wt.% were also found to be optimal for the photoproduction of H2 from water–alcohol mixtures. Concerning CO2, it is interesting to note that in all cases, the photo-reforming of acetaldehyde (Eq. (3)) was progressively favored at higher water partial pressure. However, experiments with only water yielded insignificant photoproduction rates for both H2 and CO2, as reported previously [10,11], thus highlighting again the role of ethanol in the photoreaction scheme."
10,Liquid-phase photoreaction. Slurry reactor vs. catalytic wall reactor,"3.5 Liquid-phase photoreaction. Slurry reactor vs. catalytic wall reactor To compare the photocatalytic performance of the honeycomb photoreactor and the conventional slurry reactor configuration, a experiment was carried out in liquid phase with the photocatalyst 1wt.% Au/TiO2 loaded onto the cordierite monolith (catalytic wall photoreactor) or in powdered form (slurry photoreactor). The amount of photocatalyst used was 5mg, which in the case of the photocatalytic monolith corresponds to a photocatalyst loading of 0.12mgcm−2. This value was selected because it represents a compromise between an optimum value for photogeneration of H2 on a photocatalyst weight basis in the photocatalytic monolith configuration (Fig. 3c) and a low amount of photocatalyst in powdered form in the slurry photoreactor configuration to avoid limitation by poor light penetration in the suspension. In both cases, the light source was the same optical fibers, either inside the monolith channels (catalytic wall photoreactor) or in the liquid medium (slurry reactor). The reaction was carried out in batch mode with a water–ethanol 1:1 molar mixture at room temperature. Efficient agitation was accomplished by bubbling Ar through the liquid inside the photoreactor. The Ar stream at the outlet of the photoreactor was monitored online by GC to analyze the H2 photogenerated rate. Under these conditions, the H2 photogenerated rates were 15.8±0.4μmolmin−1 g−1 for the optical fiber honeycomb photoreactor and 3.1±0.1μmolmin−1 g−1 for the slurry photoreactor. No induction time was observed for reaching H2 steady state in any case. Clearly, for the same amount of photocatalyst, the catalytic wall photoreactor performs much better than the slurry photoreactor (ca. fivefold increase). Taking into account that exactly the same photocatalyst and photocatalyst amount were used as well as light source and reactor vessel, we consider photon delivery to be the major difference between the two photoreactor configurations. Both the immobilization of the photocatalyst onto the honeycomb structure and the insertion of optical fibers inside the channels likely result in enhanced photon delivery to the photocatalyst, which yields a higher H2 photoproduction rate with respect to that obtained in the slurry photoreactor configuration, where photon delivery is less controlled. The flow rate of Ar used to remove the gaseous products of the reaction and to ensure efficient agitation had no effect on the H2 photoproduced rates, as deduced by experiments where the Ar flow rate was varied by one order of magnitude. It merits to be highlighted that, under the conditions tested, the rates of photogenerated H2 and CO2 in liquid medium, 15.8±0.4 and 0.9±0.1μmolmin−1 g−1, respectively, almost doubled that obtained in gas phase, 8.1±0.2 and 0.5±0.1μmolmin−1 g−1, respectively, even if photon delivery in a liquid medium is worse because light is absorbed following a Lambert–Beer-type law [18]. The approximate constancy in the H2/CO2 ratio suggests that a similar photoreaction scheme governs in both liquid and gas phases. The remarkably higher yield obtained in liquid medium and the absence of an induction time for hydrogen steady-state production at room temperature could be tentatively ascribed to a more effective desorption of acetaldehyde from the photocatalyst surface. In fact, acetaldehyde was detected among the reaction products in gas phase but in very low amounts (ca. 0.3μmolmin−1 g−1) because it dissolved effectively in the water–ethanol reactant mixture in the photoreactor. After light shut down, H2 and CO2 disappeared immediately in the gas phase whereas acetaldehyde persisted for long time, thus confirming its presence in the liquid phase."
11,Conclusions,"Process intensification in the photogeneration of hydrogen from ethanol and water–ethanol mixtures can be effectively performed in optical fiber honeycomb photoreactors. We have shown a significant fivefold enhancement of H2 photogeneration in liquid phase (15.8±0.4μmolmin−1 g−1) with respect to conventional slurry photoreactors using Au/TiO2 photocatalysts. A detailed operational study has been performed in gas phase by studying the effect of catalyst loading, Au content, temperature, contact time, and water to ethanol composition. The best photocatalytic performance has been obtained over photocatalytic monoliths loaded with ca. 0.5mgcm−2, which corresponds to a photocatalyst layer thickness of about 1μm. For lower loadings, the net amount of photoproduced H2 was significantly lower, whereas higher loadings did not increase the H2 photoproduction rate, possibly due to a poorer photon delivery to the deposited photocatalyst. An apparent quantum efficiency of 20.8% has been calculated. Concerning Au content, a precise comparison has been accomplished by using pre-formed Au nanoparticles that, after catalyst pretreatment, measured 3.9±0.8nm and were well dispersed on TiO2 (anatase:rutile=93:7). The optimum Au content has been found to be in the range 1–1.5wt.% Au. The photoproduction of H2 is markedly influenced by temperature and contact time. The higher the temperature, the higher the H2 photogeneration rate. On the other hand, the establishment of steady state is faster with temperature and short contact times. The evolution of H2 seems affected by acetaldehyde adsorption, suggesting that similar or neighboring sites might be involved in hole scavenging and proton reduction on the photocatalyst surface. Distribution of photoproducts indicates that, in addition to ethanol transformation into acetaldehyde, photo-reforming into H2 and CO2 also occurs, which is favored as the amount of water in the reaction mixture increases."
