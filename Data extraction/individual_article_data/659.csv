0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy systems are considered to be a promising route to replace the fossil fuel resources [1–4]. Biomass as an energy carrier is a large source of renewable energy source [5]. Developing technology for H2 production from biomass is an important toward achieving sustainable development [6,35]. H2 production from biomass pyrolysis has become an effective method for biomass resource utilization because of its high pyrolysis efficiency [7,8]. However, the process of biomass pyrolysis often produces significant amounts of tar and CO2, resulting in the low conversion efficiency and H2 content. Therefore, the removal of tar and CO2 can improve the quality of H2-rich gas, which has been attracted increasing attention for the development of technology for H2 production from biomass [9,10]. In the process of H2-rich production, the addition of a catalyst can effectively control the pyrolysis process and improve the selectivity of target products [11,12]. CaO catalysts have a good catalytic performance in absorbing CO2 generated in the biomass pyrolysis process, which is beneficial for improving the quality of H2 gas products. Li et al. [13] investigated the effects of the addition of a high amount of CaO on the yields of pyrolysis products and the evolution of noncondensable gas from corn stalk pyrolysis at different temperatures. The results showed that almost all the CO2 generated during the pyrolysis process could be absorbed by CaO (CaO/C = 1) at temperatures of 550–650 °C, at the same time, CaO could catalyze the pyrolysis of volatiles substances to produce more H2. Zhao et al. [14] studied the in-situ CO2 removal during pyrolysis of Chinese herb residue. Under the following reaction conditions including atmospheric pressure, reaction temperature of 700 °C and a Ca/H ratio of 0.65, the CO2 in the product gas was effectively removed. The contents of H2 and CO2 contents reached 47.52 vol.% and 9.01 vol.%. Although CaO exhibits a catalytic ability for cracking of tar, Ni-based catalysts are known to be effective catalysts for thermal conversion of tar. Ma et al. [15] investigated the catalytic performance of Nix/HG in the catalytic cracking of biomass tar using toluene as a model compound. The results showed that the toluene conversion reached 90 % at a reaction temperature of 700 ℃. Yang et al. [16] prepared a novel porous Ni-Al nanosheet catalyst for the pyrolysis of biomass for production of H2-rich gas. The results suggested that the liquid (tar and water) yield decreased from 38.12 wt.% to 18.06 wt.%, while the H2 content reached 48.2 vol.% at a temperature of 800 ℃. Simultaneous removal of CO2 and tar during biomass pyrolysis could further enhance the H2 content and yield. In a previous study [17], a Ni/CaO catalyst was used to remove tar and CO2 from pyrolysis of a Chinese herb residue in order to improve the gas quality. At a pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C, the yield of condensable liquids was reduced by 28 %, and the CO2 removal rate was more than 60 %. Moreover, the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the gas reached 18.6 MJ/m3 and the H2 content was approximately 50 vol.%. The Ni/CaO catalyst not only improved the composition of each gas and the calorific value but also reduced the amount of condensable liquids, including tar. In summary, the Ni/CaO-based catalyst could achieve the removal of CO2 and tar from biomass pyrolysis, but the content of H2 still needs to be further increased further. Modification of a catalyst to improve the efficiency of H2 production often requires long durations and high costs. Many studies have confirmed that the introduction of a magnetic field can enhance the activity of the catalyst [18,19]. Jose et al. [20]reported a significant enhancement of alkaline water electrolysis when a moderate magnetic field (≤450 mT) was applied to the anode, which indicated that the magnetic field increased the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst NiZnFe4Ox. Sirapassorn et al. [21] determined that the highest CO2 conversion was obtained over 10(Cu)-10(Fe)/MCM-41 catalyst with magnetic flux density of −27.7 m T in the north-south (N–S) direction which was 1.8 times higher than that of without magnetic field. Therefore, the magnetic field can improve the activity of these transition metal oxide catalysts with unpaired electrons in the outer 3d orbitals, which can be easily induced by a magnetic field to change the electron spin properties [22], improve the conversion rate of reactants, and improve the selectivity of products. In the process of H2 production from biomass pyrolysis using a Ni-based catalyst, the introduction of a magnetic field might improve the conversion rate of reactants and selectivity of products. At present, the influence of the magnetic field on H2 production from biomass pyrolysis has seldom been studied. Accordingly, in this study, the effect of the magnetic field on the catalytic performance in H2 production from biomass pyrolysis was comprehensively investigated. The Ni/CaO catalyst was operated under a magnetic field to obtain favorable conditions for H2 production. The foundings of this study will provide guidance for developing technologies for H2 production from biomass."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Wood sawdust was used for the catalytic pyrolysis of H2-rich gas, which was compressed on a tablet press at a pressure of 15 MPa after being sieved into 30–40 mesh size particles. The results of proximate analysis were as follows: 8.88 wt.% moisture, 69.70 wt.% volatile content, 14.19 wt.% fixed carbon and 7.23 wt.% ash. The elemental analysis illustrated that the C, H, O, N, and S contents were 42.27, 5.74, 35.25, 0.49, and 0.14 wt.%, respectively."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The chemicals used in the experiment were analytical reagents and no further purification was required, which was from Sinopharm. The catalysts were prepared using an isovolumetric impregnation method. According to the mass ratio of Ni to CaO, the mass of CaO and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O required for the 10 g Ni/CaO catalyst could be obtained. Ni(NO3) 2·6H2O was dissolved in 36 mL of deionized water to obtain a nickel nitrate solution, which was then poured onto the weighed CaO. This mixed sample was placed in an ultrasonic cleaner to vibrate for 0.5 h to ensure complete mixing, and it futher for 12 h to complete the impregnation process. After being placed in an oven at 120 °C for 24 h, the prepared Ni/CaO was ground into fine powder and calcined at the temperature of 900 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere. Then, the prepared Ni/CaO was pressed into disks, pulverized and screened into particle size ranges of 30–40 mesh. Finally, catalysts with different Ni loadings (5 wt.%, 10 wt.%, 15 wt.%, and 20 wt.%) were obtained through reduction at 700 ℃ for 2 h in a H2 atmosphere furnace."
4,Catalyst analysis,"2.3 Catalyst analysis The magnetic properties of the catalysts were analyzed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Quantum Design Co., America) at 20 ℃ in an applied magnetic field sweeping between ±1 T. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D/max-rB, Rigaku, Japan) was used to measure the crystal structure of the Ni/CaO catalysts with CuK α radiation (λ =1.54184 Å). The scanning step and scan range in 2θ were 0.02° and 10−90°, respectively. The surface area and total pore volume of the catalysts were determined using a surface area and porosimetry analyzer (JW-BK132 F, JWGB Sci & Tech, China). N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were recorded at -196 ℃ after the samples (50 mg) were vacuum-degassed at 150 ℃ for 12 h."
5,Experimental apparatus and procedure,"2.4 Experimental apparatus and procedure The experiments of wood sawdust catalytic pyrolysis were performed using a fixed-bed reaction system assisted by a magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 1 , which was self-designed and manufactured. The magnetic field was generated by two magnets placed parallel to each other outside the heating equipment with an inner diameter of 60 mm and an outer diameter of 160 mm. The specific magnetic field intensity could be obtained by adjusting the distance between the two magnets. According to a previous study [14,17], the catalytic temperature range of 550−700 °C was considered to for the catalytic pyrolysis of wood sawdust for H2-rich gas. In the experiments, wood sawdust (4.0 g) and catalyst (4.0 g) were separately loaded in a quartz tube reactor. When the reactor was heated to the desired temperature, wood sawdust was dropped from the top of the quartz tube and quickly placed in the high-temperature reaction zone for heating. The generated volatiles substances were blown into the catalyst bed by N2 at a flow rate of 30 mL/min, the volatiles substances were catalytically cracked on the catalysts, and the gaseous products passed through the condensing system cooled using ice-salt baths. Then, the liquid products were condensed and the non-condensing gas was collected for 30 min for analysis using an gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890 A, USA). The solid residue was collected as char."
6,Thermodynamic simulation,"2.5 Thermodynamic simulation Thermodynamic simulation of wood sawdust catalytic pyrolysis was carried out using MATLAB programming based on the Gibbs free energy minimization method [23,24]. A pyrolysis temperature range of 550−700°C, a pressure of 101.325 kPa, and a mass ratio of 10 wt.% Ni/CaO to biomass of 0.72 were adopted for the calculations. The output products included 18 components as in previous studies [25,26]."
7,Result and discussion,
8,Characterizations of catalysts,"3.1 Characterizations of catalysts 3.1.1 XRD analysis The XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction peaks are marked with (◆, ●,▲, ◊) assigned to CaO, Ca(OH)2, Ni and NiO, respectively, which corresponded to the CaO phase (jcpdsno. 99-0070), Ca (OH)2 phase (jcpdsno. 56-0065), Ni phase (jcpdsno. 65-2865), and NiO phase (jcpdsno. 65-6920). The diffraction peaks of CaO appeared at 2θ = 32.2°, 37.3°, and 53.8°, while those of Ni appeared at 2θ = 44.3°, 44.6°, and 51.9° respectively. Four types of Ni/CaO catalysts could reduce Ni, and the diffraction peak of Ni was increasingly obvious with the increase in Ni content the catalyst. 3.1.2 N2 adsorption/desorption analysis The specific surface areas and porosities of the Ni-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 . All the Ni-based catalysts exhibited type IV isotherms, which indicated that they had a mesoporous structure, according to the IUPAC classification [16]. The surface area and pore volume decreased with an the increase in Ni content, resulting in a decrease in the catalytic absorption capacity of the Ni/CaO catalyst [17]. 3.1.3 Magnetic properties of Ni/CaO catalysts The magnetic properties of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . It can be seen that the unreduced catalyst had no magnetic hysteresis loop with zero of saturation magnetization (Ms), remanence magnetization (Mr), and coercivity field (Hc), which indicated that it was not magnetic. Owing to the appearance of the magnetic substance Ni, the reduced catalyst had an obvious hysteresis loop constriction in the middle section [19]. The Ms and Mr values of the reduced catalysts increased when the Ni content of the catalyst increased. Therefore, it was determined that the magnetic properties of the reduced Ni/CaO catalyst were enhanced with higher Ni contents."
9,Experimental analysis of catalytic pyrolysis,"3.2 Experimental analysis of catalytic pyrolysis 3.2.1 Effect of temperature With the 10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst, 80 m T magnetic field intensity and the temperature range of 550−700 °C, the content change of H2, CH4, CO, and CO2 based on experiments and calculations are illustrated in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that the variation trends of the gas components from the experiments were in accordance with those from the simulation, which verified the experimental results. The H2 content increased and then decreased, reaching the highest experimental value of 62.20 vol.% at 650 °C. The CO2 content decreased and then slightly increased with the lowest value at 650 ℃. With the increase of temperature, the CH4 content continuously decreased, whereas that of CO increased. Via comprehensive analysis of the contents of H2, CO2, CO, and CH4 content at different temperatures, it was determined that high-quality H2-rich gas products could be obtained at 650°C with the highest H2 content and lowest CO2 content. This might be because the 10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst at 650 ℃ had the strongest adsorption capacity for CO2 and could effectively absorb CO2, which was reported in our previous study [27]. Meanwhile, CO2 absorption promoted a forward shift of the water gas shift reaction (WGSR), as the key reaction to control the H2 yield in this complex reaction network [25,26], leading to an increase in the H2 content. H2H2. 3.2.2 Effect of Ni/CaO catalyst The catalytic performances of the four catalysts with different Ni contents (5 wt.%,10 wt.%,15 wt.%, and 20 wt.%) were compared at the temperature of 650 ℃ and magnetic field intensity of 80 m T, as shown in Fig. 6 . The changes trend of H2, CH4, CO, and CO2 with the different Ni content catalysts were similar with and without the magnetic field. With an increase in the Ni content, the H2 content increased and then decreased, reaching a maximum of 62.20 vol.% when at 10 wt.%Ni content. The CO content increased, while CH4 and CO2 decreased and then increased. Among the four types of catalysts, the 10 wt.%Ni/CaO could achieve the highest H2 content and the lowest CO2 content, which could be explained by the findings of a previous study [27]. When CO2 was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst, the C atom forms a bond with the O atom on the surface of the catalyst (Osurf). After doping Ni with CaO, the electronic structure of the Osurf atom was changed and the activity was enhanced. Compared with the CaO catalyst, the Ni/CaO catalyst can better adsorb CO2 molecules better. However, the adsorption capacity was greatly reduced owing to the decrease in the specific surface area and porosity of the catalyst when the Ni content exceeded 10 wt.%, Therefore, the 10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst demonstrated the optimal capacity to absorb CO2, which promoted a forward shift of the WSGR to produce more H2. In addition, it was noted that the addition of a magnetic field further increased the content of H2 and decreased the CO2 content, which clearly improved the gas quality. In conclusion, the10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst assisted by magnetic field was adopted to produce H2 from biomass pyrolysis. 3.2.3 Effect of magnetic field intensities The magnetic intensity of 0–80 m T, temperature of 650°C, and 10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst were adopted for catalytic pyrolysis of wood sawdust. The distribution of the gas composition is shown in Fig. 7 . The H2 content continued to rise with the increase in magnetic field intensity and reached a the maximum of 62.20 vol.% at 80 m T. And the CO content decreased, while the CH4 and CO2 content showed a slightly decrease. According to the above analysis, WGSR which is a redox reaction mechanism with a Ni-based catalyst [28], was responsible for adjusting H2 production. (1) H 2 O→ O * + OH * (2) OH * → O * + H * (3) CO * + O * → CO 2 (4) H * + H * → H 2 In the redox reaction mechanism of WGSR, Reaction 1 marks the entire process, while Reaction 3 presents the rate-determining step considering its high energy barrier [29]. H2O molecules are bound by low-energy intermolecular van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and dipole-dipole interactions. There were two reasons for the promotion of the reaction (Reaction1) by the magnetic field [30]. First, van der Waals bonds were broken, leading to the pre-dissociation of weakly-bound van der Waals complexes. Further, the hydrogen bonds were deformed, resulting in some partial rupture. In Reaction 3, O2 could be interacted strongly with the d holes of the transition metals Ni, which had a profound influence on surface magnetism, as well as on catalytic oxidation activity. The external magnetic field promoted O2 adsorption and CO conversion on the paramagnetic catalyst in the d state [31], resulting in a forward reaction (Reaction 3). Therefore, it was possible that the magnetic field improved the performance of the catalyst and promoted the forward reaction of water gas shift, leading to an increase of the H2 content and a decrease in the CO content. The changing trend of the gas yield under various magnetic field intensities is shown in the Fig. 8 .a. With an increase in the magnetic field intensity, the total gas yield and H2 yield continued to increase. The magnetic field was useful for producing H2 from biomass pyrolysis and the maximum of the experimental H2 yield was 469.2 mL/g at 80 m T. The influence of the magnetic field on the distribution of the three state products distribution is illustrated in Fig. 8.b. It was determined that the gas yields increased with an increase in magnetic field intensities, whereas that of liquid (including tar and water) decreased. Compared with the yield without a magnetic field, the mass content of gas increased by 13.60 % and that of liquid decreased by16.00 % at 80 m T. The mass content of solid (including biochar, deposited carbon, and the CO2 of carbonatization) slightly increased. This indicated that the magnetic field promoted tar cracking, resulting in an increase in the gas yield. This could be attributed to the unpaired electrons in the outer 3d orbital of Ni, which were induced by the magnetic field to change the spin properties of the electrons, in order to improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst for tar macromolecules. Moreover, tar cracking is a free-radical reaction mechanism [32,33]. Its key feature is the spin evolution between the singlet and triplet states. Externally applied magnetic fields affected the rate and extent of this spin evolution and hence changed the yields of the reaction products. Thus, the magnetic field influenced the reaction of free radicals with unpaired electrons, resulting in the deep conversion of tar [33]. Fig. 9 showed that the main components of tar were phenols and hydrocarbons, while the minor components included acids, esters, alcohols, ketones and aldehydes. The tar components under different magnetic field intensities were showed in Tables A1–A5. With the increase in magnetic field intensity, the phenols content decreased and that of hydrocarbons increased. This might be attributed to the effect of the magnetic field could effect on the paramagnetic center of the aromatic component of phenols, leading to their excitatation into a higher electronic/spin states. Moreover, some aromatic structures within phenols macromolecule were rearranged, which resulted in partial rupturing [34]. Fig. 9 also shows the content of O2-containing compounds in the tar decreased with the increase in magnetic field intensity. Compared to the case without the magnetic field, the content of O2-containing compounds reduced by 65.73 %, whereas that of hydrocarbons increased by 43.89 % with the magnetic field intensity of 80 m T, which indicated that magnetic field was helpful to the deoxidation of tar. 3.2.4 Experimental results of optimization parameters Based on the above experimental results and analysis, the optimal experimental operating parameters were obtained as the temperature of 650 ℃, the magnetic field intensity of 80 m T, and the 10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst were obtained. The experimental results are presented in Table 3 . The H2H2 content and yield reached 62.2 vol.% and 469.2 mL/g, increasing by 9.50 % and 19.78 %, as compared to the values without the magnetic field, respectively. In the experiment, the magnetic field was generated by a the permanent magnet with no energy consumption, which was an economically-assisted method to prepare H2-rich gas by the thermochemical conversion of biomass."
10,Conclusions,"The H2-rich gases produced from biomass pyrolysis with 10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst assisted by a magnetic field was studied. The magnetic field was beneficial to the catalytic cracking of the tar content and promoted the forward WGSR, which increased the H2 content and yield. The highest H2 content and yield were obtained under the optimized operation parameters of a temperature of 650 ℃, 10 wt.% Ni/CaO catalyst and 80 m T magnetic field intensity, As the permanent magnet does not consume energy, this technology can provide a new method for economical production of H2 from biomass."
