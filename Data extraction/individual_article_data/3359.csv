0,Introduction,"The level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is constantly increasing concerns about the environment and increasing interest in sustainable energy [1,2]. The direct electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for converting CO2 into chemical feedstock and fuels has attracted great attention; this conversion process not only reduces the level of CO2 in the atmosphere but also produces valuable chemicals at feasible operating conditions [3,4]. Unfortunately, the large dissociation energy of CO (805 kJ/mol) makes the CO2RR kinetically slow and diverges reaction that needs a catalyst that possesses high activity and selectivity for a particular of interest [5]. Various transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been studied to reduce the excessive potential arising from the sluggish CO2RR process of converting CO2 to hydrocarbons [6,7]. Among the materials, copper (Cu) is the only cost-effective non-precious metal element that produces a large quantity of hydrocarbons or alcohols through the catalysis of the CO2 reduction process [8–11]. In the case of CO2RR, the selectivity of the product is dominated by the binding energy of the reaction intermediate (i.e., *CO) to the catalyst surface [12,13]. According to the Sabatier principle, Cu achieves the Sabatier optimal, where the bond with *CO is not too strong or weak, so that the *CO attached to the Cu atom is in a state that can actively participate in the further hydrogenation reaction [14,15]. However, to satisfy this principle, only Cu and *CO must be present on the reaction surface, therefore highly pure electrolyte and electrocatalyst surface are essential prerequisites for high activity and selective hydrocarbon production. Given that the impurities from the electrolyte or catalytic surface are highly sensitive toward CO2RR, which leads to an enhanced side reaction, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) instead of the desired CO2RR [16–18]. For example, heavy metal ion impurities (Fe2+ and Pt2+) that were deposited on the Cu film which leads to the deactivation of the electrocatalytic performance [19] and the deterioration of Cu electrode in CO2RR [20–23]. In particular, Fe impurity is the active site for HER due to its strong binding energy to CO, the intermediate of CO2RR [17,19]. The increased formation of adsorbed CO on Fe impurities accelerates blocking the C–H bond formation on Cu film surface [24]. As such, trace amounts of Fe impurities present in the Cu film can promote competition with HER during CO2RR. Consequently, purification process steps such as polishing, electroplating, and additional costs are necessary to obtain the high purity of Cu film which shows excellent electrochemical performance. Here we report an effective method to compensate for the effect of Fe impurities, which adversely affects CO2RR, on the surface of the Cu film through the growth of an nano-sized metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) on Cu foils. We cover Fe impurities on the Cu surface using UiO-66 [25], composed of zirconium (Zr)-based nodes and terephthalic acid (TPA). Growing UiO-66 on Cu film has overcome the deactivation of CO2 reaction and enhanced catalytic performance. The UiO-66 has high chemical stability in organic and water solvent with high thermal stability in the air [26], and can be cost-effectively synthesized on Cu films by solvothermal method. The UiO-66 deposited through the coordination of TPA as the organic linker with Fe impurities on Cu film surface [27]. Therefore, the Fe site on the Cu film is covered by UiO-66 with the TPA-Fe coordination network. As a result, the optimal UiO-66@Cu surface functionalized by UiO-66 exhibits an improved CO2 conversion to hydrocarbons."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and sample preparation,"2.1 Materials and sample preparation Two commercial Cu foil of different purities (99.9% and 99.9999%) was purchased from UACJ Foil Corp and Alfa Aesar (metal basis), repectively. Terephthalic acid (H2BDC, 98%), 70% zirconium(IV) propoxide (Zr(OnPr)4) solution in 1-propanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and acetic acid (HAc) were purachased from Sigma-aldrich. At first, 36.3 mg of terephthalic acid was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF and dispersed it evenly in ultrasonic homogenizer. Second, Cu film substrate (~1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) was immersed into 50 mL vial with Teflon cap and 64.2 µL of Zr-propoxide solution and 2.1 mL of acetic acid were added to the homogeneous solution. Then, the precursor solution was heated at 120 °C for 1 h and rinsed three times with DMF and the solvent exchanged with Methanol. Finally, the obtained film was dried at 60 °C overnight. In this study, Fe island doped Cu film was prepared by thermal evaporation. UiO-66 particles were synthesized by following steps [28]. Zirconium(IV) chloride (ZrCl4) (66.8 mg) with HAc (1.38 mL) and a mixture of H2BDC (50.1 mg) with triethylamine (TEA) (30 µL) were dissolved in DMF 5 mL, respectively. After mixing the two solutions in one vial, the solution was heated at 85 °C for 24 h. The precipitated particles were rinsed three times with DMF and the solvent exchanged with methanol. The obtained particles were dried under vacuum at 85 °C overnight."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The morphology and chemical composition of UiO-66 were analyzed by field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL), and the corresponding elemental mappings were conducted by scanning TEM (STEM) energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, X-MAS, Oxford instruments). Moreover, UiO-66@Cu microstructure analysis was carried out by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SUPRA55VP, Carl Zeiss). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of each material were collected using X'pert PRO MPD (Malvern PANalytical). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was investigated by N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 gas adsorption apparatus. The value of specific surface area was obtained in the relative pressure (P/P 0) range of 0.0–1.0. In order to examine the chemical state of coordinated UiO-66 on Cu film, some samples were etched by Ar+ bombardment (~5 × 10−5 Torr) with an energy of 2.5 kV and a current of 2.0 μA. The quantitative information about the impurities present in Cu film was detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkinelmer Optima 7300 DV) instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected through an Axis-Supra by Kratos using an Al X-ray source and the spectra were obtained using an incident photon energy of 1486.7 eV and corrected by using the detector work function."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements All electrochemical measurements were made using multipotentiostat (VMP3, Biologics). CO2 was purged into the electrolysis cell at a flow rate of 5 sccm. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 was performed in 0.1 M KHCO3 using a H-type cell [29] and the details of product analysis is provided elsewhere [30]. In brief, gaseous products such as H2, CO, CH4, and C2H4 were analyzed by online gas chromatography (GC) using a stainless steel column (1.8 m × 0.3 cm) packed with 80/100 Molecular Sieve 5 A (Restek®PLOT) and microthermal conductivity detector (μTCD). And then the product on the liquid was collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography (HPLC, 1260 Infinity II, Agilent Technologies) of the location performance and sulfuric acid (1 mM) was used as eluent."
5,Results and discussion,"Hydrocarbon is actively produced through the CO2RR reaction on the surface of the copper film of ideal purity (Fig. 1 a), but this is not possible with commercial Cu films containing impurities (Fig. 1b). Impurities on the surface of commercial Cu films, especially Fe (Table S1), interfere with the CO2RR reaction and promote the generation of hydrogen through the HER. In order to control the reaction of these iron impurities, we propose a UiO-66 coating on Cu film, i.e., UiO-66@Cu that compensates for iron impurities, which reduces the generation of hydrogen and induces the formation of hydrocarbon during the CO2RR reaction (Fig. 1c). To generate the compensating layer consisting of UiO-66 on Cu film, Cu film was immersed into a reaction mixture of Zr precursor and TPA in the presence DMF solution and acetic acid in a beaker (Fig. 2 a). The TEM image showed that the UiO-66 particles were grown on Cu film in octahedral morphology and EDS mapping (Fig. 2b) also confirmed uniformly distributed C, O and Zr elements. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms from BET technique in Fig. 2(c) show that the synthesized UiO-66 particles have a very large specific surface area (1209.93 m2/g) that allows easy access of CO2 to the channels of MOF [31,32]. Besides, the SEM image in Fig. 2(d) further supports the formation of a nano-sized particle and porous structure of UiO-66 in UiO-66@Cu. Fig. 2(e) displays the XRD profile of UiO-66@Cu, where all diffraction patterns matched with the obtained UiO-66 powder peak and purity of 99.9% metallic Cu without any other substance. Three narrow XRD peaks of UiO-66@Cu correspond to metallic Cu (2θ = 43.19°, 50.3° and 73.89°) (JCPDS No. 01-070-3039), respectively [33]. In particular, UiO-66@Cu consists of UiO-66 grains oriented along the (111) direction (2θ = 7.412°) [25,34]. Electrochemical tests were conducted to measure the CO2RR activity and product selectivity of Cu film and UiO-66@Cu. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of commercial Cu film and UiO-66@Cu which was performed in the potential range from 0 V to − 1.3 V vs. RHE at a scan rate 20 mV s−1 show that the current density of UiO-66@Cu is three times higher than the Cu film, with a difference of about 38 mA cm−2 at −1.3 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3 a). UiO-66 has a high surface area so that it is not only excellent in mass transfer, but as a result of conducting an evaluation of CO2 permeability according to the orientation of UiO-66 in a previous study it was revealed that (111)-oriented UiO-66 has high CO2 permeation selectivity [35–37], thus resulting in the improvement of the current density of UiO-66@Cu in CO2RR. Gaseous product selectivity of commercial Cu film and UiO-66@Cu was obtained via online GC analysis at constant applied potentials between −1.1 and −1.3 V vs. RHE where CH4 is the dominant hydrocarbon product on Cu [38] so that the contribution of Fe impurities toward HER can be easily distinguished (Fig. 3b). In contrast to highly promoted hydrogen production on commercial Cu film, considerable production of hydrocarbon is observed on high purity Cu film (99.9999%) during CO2RR (Fig. S1a). Based on the result, it can be confirmed that the Fe impurity on the Cu film enhances HER. On the other hand, the UiO-66@Cu exhibits improved hydrocarbon production selectivity due to the UiO-66 film blocking Fe impurities, which is maximal at −1.1 V vs. RHE. Specifically, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of hydrocarbon selectivity for UiO-66@Cu was 37.59%, which corresponds to a 2-fold improvement over the commercial Cu film. Fig. 3(c) shows the partial current density of hydrocarbons as a function of applied potentials. For commercial Cu film, the partial current density of hydrocarbons is nearly zero, while UiO-66@Cu exhibits 18.4 mA/cm2 at −1.3 V vs. RHE. For gaseous products in the potential range of −0.5 to −0.9 V vs. RHE, UiO-66@Cu, commercial Cu film, and high purity of Cu film produce dominantly H2 and trace amounts of CO instead of hydrocarbons at relatively low overpotentials (Fig. S2). The main liquid product of UiO-66@Cu and commercial Cu film is formic acid (HCOOH) (Fig. S3), which is generated via a two-electron transfer at low overpotential [38]. Meanwhile, in case of high purity Cu film and UiO-66@Cu, the hydrocarbon selectivity increases considerably as the overpotential increases. As a result, the total FE of UiO-66@Cu including liquid products reached to 89.7% and 85.23% at −1.3 and −1.1 V vs. RHE, respectively. Chronoamperometry (CA) tests were performed over an extended period of time to determine the stability at each potential. As shown in Fig. S4, the UiO-66@Cu exhibits long-term stability at various voltages. As the current density reached a steady-state, it maintained a high current density without a special voltage drop compared to the Cu film. The activity of UiO-66 electrode shows the decay of ~2.77 mA/cm2 during 3 h long-term stability test (Fig. S6), and the product selectivity of hydrocarbon was also maintained over 30% FE during CA at −1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. S5). To confirm the stability of UiO-66 after reaction, the structure of UiO-66 was observed by ex-situ SEM and XRD analyses (Figs. S7 and S8). The morphology of UiO-66 particles after the processes at various reaction time is not changed significantly (Fig. S7). Moreover, XRD spectrum of UiO-66 remains after the reaction. It should be noted that UiO-66 shows the stability under CO2RR in this study. Non-catalytic properties of UiO-66 on glassy carbon substrate for CO2RR are shown in the absence of Cu electrode (Fig. S9) [39]. Moreover, FE of hydrocarbon of UiO-66@high purity Cu film is consistent with CO2RR properties of high purity Cu film (Fig. S2b). These results support that the porous structure of UiO-66@Cu has high mass transfer capability due to its large surface area and the impurities covering, inducing both the high partial current density of hydrocarbons and recovering the FE for hydrocarbons [40,41]. We have further analyzed whether UiO-66 can effectively cover the surface of Fe impurities to inhibit the HER. Fe impurities located on the surface of the Cu film have a significant effect on the CO2RR reaction, but their compositional ratio is very small, making it difficult to detect by general analysis methods. Therefore, it is also difficult to confirm whether the Fe impurity is clearly covered. In this study, we tried to increase the content of Fe impurities on the surface of the Cu film for better identification, and for this purpose, additional Fe was deposited on the surface of the Cu film (Cu film/Fe) through thermal evaporation (Fig. S10). The morphology of Fe was controlled by small islands of ~5 nm thickness. Then, UiO-66 is synthesized on the surface of the Cu film/Fe (UiO-66@Cu film/Fe) in the same way as the solvothermal treatment. The change that occurs in Fe impurities after UiO-66 deposition was confirmed through XPS analysis. Fig. 4 (a) shows that the Fe 2p spectra of Cu film/Fe were fitted to Fe2+ (709.2 eV), Fe3+ (711.3 eV), and the peak located at 706 eV is attributed to metallic Fe [42,43]. UiO-66 is composed of carbon, zirconium and 4-oxygens involved in the carboxylate functional groups of organic linker from μ3-OH and μ3-O and UiO-66 binds to Fe impurities through oxygen atoms. After deposition of UiO-66 on Cu film/Fe, the presence of Fe3+ species is found to further increasing thereby corroborating the existence of Fe–O bonding on Cu surface and Fe impurities on Cu film act as nucleation sites for the growth of the UiO-66 (Fig. 4b). In Fig. S11, XPS spectra of O 1s provide the evidence for coordination between Fe and O by the epitaxial UiO-66 growth process on Cu film. A O 1s major spectrum of UiO-66@Cu film/Fe was shifted to a higher binding energy by 2 eV than those of Fe deposited Cu, indicating the UiO-66 coverage caused the protonated O. At Fe island coverage, the signal of 529 eV correlated to the lattice oxygen and coordinated oxygen is at 530.4 eV [44,45]. Subsequent epitaxial growth of UiO-66 onto a Cu substrate containing small Fe coverage, O 1s spectra display high intensity of coordinated oxygen corresponding to dominate Fe–O bond and Cu–O bond. The core-level XPS spectra of Cu 2p in both commercial Cu film/Fe and UiO-66@Cu film/Fe samples show the same peaks of metallic state Cu at the binding energies of 931.6 eV (Fig. S12). The absence of an obvious change in the binding energies of Cu 2p XPS spectra in UiO-66@Cu film/Fe compared to Cu film/Fe suggests that UiO-66 preferential binds to Fe sites rather than Cu sites [46]. In this process, UiO-66 is partially attached to the Cu site. In order to carefully distinguish the chemical state of Cu, oxidation state change of Cu by growth reaction with UiO-66 is shown in Fig. S12 (insets). The LMM spectra for copper can be deconvoluted to the spectra of Cu2O, CuO and Cu corresponding to ~569.6, ~568.6 and ~567.6 eV, respectively [47]. The Cu LMM spectra are not significantly changed before and after coating of UiO-66, and metallic Cu is observed in both cases. It is noted that change of oxidation states to metallic states after UiO-66 coating are sensitive in Fe rather than Cu. These results also support the fact that the oxygen in the UiO-66 ligand preferentially binds to Fe on the Cu film/Fe surface. Thus, from the XPS analysis, it appears that there is an apparent interaction between UiO-66 and Fe impurities. To clearly understand the effect of UiO-66 covering the Fe impurity on Cu foils, electrochemical CO2RR of Cu film/Fe and UiO-66@Cu film/Fe were investigated (Fig. S13). Cu film/Fe exhibits around 100% FE for hydrogen at −1.3 and −1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. S13a), indicating the Fe impurities on Cu surface highly stimulate the hydrogen evolution during CO2RR. On the other hand, UiO-66@Cu film/Fe effectively suppresses hydrogen generation and enhances hydrocarbon production compared to that of Cu film/Fe at −1.3 and −1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. S13b). From these results, it is noted that the deposition of UiO-66 completely compensates for the Fe impurities on Cu films even with high concentration of Fe impurities, by covering the Fe impurities with UiO-66 bindings. Finally, such a surface control for compensation depends on interaction with Fe impurities and functional groups of UiO-66, decreasing the possibility of an active site for HER on 99.9% purity commercial Cu film."
6,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the sub-ppm level of Fe impurities on the high purity Cu (99.9%) film increases the FE of H2 up to 80% via HER (as the CO prefers to bind with Fe sites rather than Cu) and therefore, dramatically suppressing the CO2RR process that leads to poor hydrocarbon generation. In this study, we covered the Fe impurity of the Cu foil with UiO-66 which shows superior electrocatalytic performance for CO2RR instead of HER under the same electrochemical conditions. Significantly, the optimized UiO-66@Cu shows the FE of hydrocarbon as high as 37.59% with a large partial current density which is 3-fold larger than that of commercial Cu film. The high selectivity of UiO-66@Cu for hydrocarbon is attributed to the strong binding of the organic linker from UiO-66 to the Fe impurity that suppresses the role of Fe during the CO2RR. The high catalytic performance is attributed to the synergetic effects of the Cu film and UiO-66 with a large surface area that facilitated the mass transport for the catalytic CO2RR. Additionally, the effect of highly (111)-oriented UiO-66 membrane on a Cu film which exhibits high CO2 permeation dominated the sufficient supply of CO2 to the Cu surface for the enhanced catalytic reaction."
