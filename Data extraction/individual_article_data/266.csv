0,Introduction,"The realization of finite fossil fuel scarcity and environmental pollution has led the research community and environmentalists to search for alternative renewable and environmentally friendly green fuel [1–3]. Conversion of solar energy to storable chemical fuel from a clean source such as water is the key technology to the carry out the future energy demands [4]. Hydrogen has emerged as the most promising green fuel because of its high energy emission, zero hazard and most important can be produced from the water [5–7]. Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution has been most popular route for hydrogen generation [8]. There are numerous issues including cost-effectiveness related to these techniques. Sustainable photocatalytic H2 production has been a promising and solution to tackle dual issues of the energy crisis and environmental pollution [9–11]. However, for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation, some external sacrificial agents or donors as alcohols, organic acids etc are generally employed for scavenging holes and diminishing recombination [12,13]. Such addition is economically viable and practically suitable as the external sacrificial agents act as an energy supply or input and thus raise the cost of hydrogen evolution eventually [14]. Regarding sustainable and efficient hydrogen evolution, there are two important requisites. Firstly, the photocatalyst must be able to separate photogenerated electrons and holes efficiently along with numerous requisite reaction sites and high visible light activity [15,16].The second challenge lies in recovery or generation of hydrogen energy from waste water for implementation of a environmental friendly and sustainable energy production-cum-water treatment with promising scale-up. Among numerous contaminants of emerging concern, antibiotics and their residues have been most widespread because of their resistance to biological oxidation and other traditional methods [17–19]. Norfloxacin (NFN) belongs to class of fluoroquinlones which are one of the most common antibiotics [20,21]. These are not completely metabolized by body and about 70% is excreted out [22]. Being reported in ng L−1 to μg L−1 in environment, their presence is surely a threat to aquatic ecosystem and humans [23] and lead to antibiotic resistance in microbes in longer run [24]. Thus utilizing these antibiotics as sacrificial agent in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution serves both the purposes of clean energy generation and wastewater treatment. The semiconductor heterojunctions especially Z-schemes formed by choosing materials with suitable band structures are highly beneficial in the charge separation [25] which is an essential prerequisite for such purpose. Recently, bismuth oxyhalides have garnered extensive attentions owing to their significant sunlight response, built-in electric field and adequate chemical stability, such as (BiaObXc, X = Cl, I, Br) [26–28]. Among them, a new bismuth-rich Bi7O9I3 has been widely reported as one of most promising photocatalysts in the field of photocatalytic energy production and environmental remediation [29,30]. It possesses excellent photocatalytic activity and high charge transfer ratio owing to the increased Bi and O content, deeply anisotropic p or hybridized sp states, and highly dispersed conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) [31]. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic efficiency of Bi7O9I3 remains far from suitable for practical applications because the quantum yield of Bi7O9I3 is rather poor due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and slow rate of photogenerated charge transfer [26,32]. Boron carbide (B4C), is a stable and low-cost metal-free semiconductor with a strong absorption in solar light owing to mid-gap states and various structural distortions [33,34]. It has low band gap, low density with an excellent resistance to oxidation resistance and tunable electrical properties [35]. Feng and co-workers (2013) utilized B4C in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, with a decent hydrogen evolution activity originating from structural defects and distortions in [36]. Very few works have reported heterojunctions based on B4C for photocatalytic applications as B4C/TiO2 [35], B4C/C3N4 [37] etc. As compared to Bi4O9I3, boron carbide has more strength and active sites for a robust heterojunction formation. In the current work, synthesis of Bi7O9I3/B4C heterojunction is reported for simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and fluoroquinolone antibiotic degradation under visible light. The unique hierarchical structure of the heterojunction shows high visible light capture, high electron transport, highly suppressed electron-hole recombination with an effective Z-scheme mechanism. A 456.3 μmol g−1h−1H2 evolution with almost complete norfloxacin removal was achieved under anoxic conditions with retaining of high activity under oxic conditions too. An effective Z-scheme transfer facilitated by Bio (as found in XPS findings) was active for a higher charge separation and effective hydrogen evolution with NFN molecules acting as sacrificial agent by capturing directly holes as well as indirectly ●OH radicals. The activity was also tested with other pollutants as rhodamine B and tetracycline. This work paves way for converting different waste-water sources for a sustainable hydrogen evolution, water treatment and resource utilization. Utilizing pharmaceutical waste for hydrogen generation is essentially an important step towards realizing sustainable development and circular economy."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation of Bi7O9I3/B4C heterojunction,"2.1 Preparation of Bi7O9I3/B4C heterojunction Boron carbide (B4C) was synthesized by condensation reaction of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and boric acid (H3BO3) (detailed procedure in supplementary data). Bi7O9I3/B4C (BIBC) heterojunction photocatalyst with different ratios was prepared via a hydrothermal route. In a reaction vessel, 2.425 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was added into 50 mL ethylene glycol (EG) with constant stirring and sonication at 313 K until the solution becomes transparent. Subsequently, a certain amount (0.1–0.5 g) of as prepared ultrathin B4C was gradually added with continuously stirring for 10 min. Later, 1.498 g sodium iodide was dissolved into the above mixture with continuously stirring for 30 min. A certain quantity of sodium acetate (1 mol/L) was added drop-wise into the mixed solution to adjust pH to 10 with continuously stirring for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then hydrothermally treated at 160 °C for 12 h. The products were then washed with water and ethanol and vaccum dried. Eventually, BIBC heterojunctions with varying percentage of B4C were synthetized as BIBC-10 (10% B4C), BIBC-20 (20% B4C), BIBC-30 (30% B4C), BIBC-40 (40% B4C) and BIBC-50 (50% B4C). Fig. 1 shows the pictorial representation of the whole synthetic route. Pure Bi7O9I3 was prepared via same route without addition of B4C."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystallographic structures of samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Advance, Germany instrument with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of as synthesized materials was examined by a JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope (SEM). The microstructural properties of photocatalysts were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using FEI-Tecnai G2 F20S-Twin instrument being operated at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 XPS instrument with a Al Kα monochromatic source. The BET surface area of photocatalyst was measured by N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained analyzed using Shimadzu (Japan) U-3900 spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as standard reference. Thephotoluminescence(PL) spectra of samples to ascertain the charge carrier separation was obtained using fluorescence spectrometer (F-2700, Hitachi) at room temperature. The point of zero charge (pzc) was determined using Malvern zeta analyzer, UK. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation by employing a standard three-electrode cell with saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference, platinum as counter, and sample coated indium tin oxide (ITO) glass working electrode. Further Mott-Schottky plots were also obtained."
4,Photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin with simultaneous H2 evolution,"2.3 Photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin with simultaneous H2 evolution The set of experiments include: Visible light powered photocatalytic degradation of NFN alone; Photocatalytic H2 evolution without using sacrificial agent i.e ultrapure water under anoxic and oxic conditions; Using norfloxacin antibiotic (target pollutant) as sacrificial agent for simultaneous antibiotic degradation and hydrogen evolution. All photocatalytic experiments were performed in a Pyrex photo-reactor fitted with a gas circulation arrangement and an auto-sampler. The temperature was kept fixed at 30 ± 0.5 °C inside reactor using a circulating water system. For the anoxic environment, the dissolved oxygen was first removed from reaction system before experiment using vacuum pump. For visible light source, a 500 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter was used. In a particular experiment, 35 mg (optimized dose) of photocatalyst powder was first suspended in 100 mL norfloxacin (10 mg L−1) solution. High purity argon (Ar) gas was used as carrier. The hydrogen evolution was observed on exposure to light was detected and measured using an online gas chromatograph (GC) Tianmei GC-7900, China (equipped with a having a 5 Å capillary column) and TCD detector. The experiments were also performed under oxic environment (initial dissolved oxygen-6.5 mg L−1). The H2 evolution was also studied without any sacrificial agents and also in presence of other agents as methanol, rhodamine B, triethonalmine and tetracycline antibiotic. The degradation of norfloxacin (10 mg L−1) under visible light was also studied under normal conditions (catalyst dosage- 0.35 mg mL−1) in ultrapure water i.e under oxic conditions. Analytical methods: Along with hydrogen evolution, the removal or degradation of NFN antibiotic was also quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Shimadzu CTO-16L HPLC, Japan with detector wavelength of 275 nm (involving a C-18 column- 5 µm, 4.8 mm × 150 mm). The flow rate was 0.3 mL min−1. The mobile phase used was mixture of 0.3 % formic acid and acetonitrile. The ratio of formic acid and acetonitrile was varied from from 90:10 to 10:90 (V/V) in 20 min and then to 90:10 in 5 min. The norfloxacin degradation intermediates were identified by LC-MS using an Agilent 1100 + Thermos TSQ Quantum Ultra AM, USA instrument. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal was quantified using a Shimadzu TOC-VCPH analyzer. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was determined as: % A Q E = noofreactedelectrons noofincidentphotons X 100 = noof H 2 m o l e c u l e s e v o l v e d X 2 noofincidentphotons X 100 A 500 W Xe lamp (180 mW cm−2) with 420 (±5) nm band-pass filter was used for determining AQE."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 XRD analysis The phase purity and crystallinity of the synthesized Bi7O9I3/B4C (BIBC), Bi7O9I3 and B4C were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction analysis, as shown in Fig. 2 . The XRD pattern of Bi7O9I3, exhibits characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.6°, 31.4°, 36.9°, 45.1°, 49.3° and 54.4° corresponding to (102), (110), (103), (200), (114) and (202) planes which are assigned to tetragonal phase of Bi7O9I3 [38]. It can be observed that the peak for (102) plane which is placed at 29.7° for BiOI (JCPDS – 10–445) is shifted to 28.6° in case of Bi7O9I3 due to lattice expansion and structure distortion in Bi rich Bi7O9I3 [39]. A small diffraction peak at 27.3° in BIBC junction is assigned to Bio. For B4C, the peaks at 23.5⁰, 34.9⁰, and 37.5⁰ are assigned to (012), (110) and (104) lattice planes corresponding to rhombohedral B4C which are well matched with JCPDS 35-0798 [35,40]. The binary junctions BIBC-10, BIBC-20 and BIBC-40 shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of both semiconductors with change in intensities depending upon the content of each in the heterojunction. Due to low content and crystallinity of B4C as compared to Bi7O9I3, some peaks of the former are not easily observable in the heterojunction. 3.1.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis Fig. 3 (a-f) shows the XPS spectra i.e survey scan and corresponding fitted elemental spectra for BIBC-30 sample. The survey spectrum confirms the presence of Bi, O, I, B and C elements in the binary heterojunction. The core level Bi 4f spectrum (Fig. 3b), shows two peaks at 160.1 eV and 165.4 eV corresponding to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 respectively for Bi3+ oxidation state in Bi7O9I3 [41]. As compared to literature [42] the B.E for Bi 4f in BIBC heterojunction are shifted towards positive side suggesting a decrease in electron density. In addition to peaks for Bi3+, low intensity peaks are assigned to presence of metallic Bi° [43]. For I 3d spectrum (Fig. 3c), the peaks at 617.3 eV and 628.7 eV correspond to I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2, respectively for I− state in Bi7O9I3 [44]. The two small intensity peaks at 618.1 eV and 629.2 eV are assigned to I3 − state. Fig. 3 (d) shows O 1s spectrum with three peaks at 531.1 eV, 532.8 eV and 533.8 eV corresponding to Bi-O, I-O and adsorbed water molecules respectively [45,46]. The high-resolution C 1s spectra (Fig. 3e) showed three peaks at 284.9 eV, 286.1 and 290.3 eV which are ascribed to C-B, C-C and C-O bonds, respectively. The B 1s peak is located at 194.2 eV (Fig. 3f), corresponding to B4C. The B.E (C 1s) shows negative shift as compared to C 1s spectra for bare B4C (Fig. S1) indicating increase in electron density around B. The B.E shifts suggest movement of electrons from Bi7O9I3 towards B4C. 3.1.3 Morphology and microstructural analysis Fig. 4 (a) and (b) shows the SEM micrographs of Bi7O9I3 and BIBC-30 respectively. It can be observed that Bi7O9I3 possesses flower like morphology with a uniform structure. The SEM image for binary junction BIBC-40 shows Bi7O9I3 flowers in intimate contact with B4C with irregular morphology with nano-sheets like structure. The flower like nanoparticles morphology of Bi7O9I3 is clearly more visible in TEM image of BIBC-40 heterojunction (Fig. 4c). Both the semiconductors are intimately forming a junction which is necessary for efficient photocatalytic activity. The HRTEM image (Fig. 4d) shows the lattice fringes of both Bi7O9I3 and B4C which are in good agreement with XRD data. The elemental mapping and spatial constituent elemental distribution for BIBC-40 photocatalyst (Fig. 4 e-j) confirms the presence of Bi, O, I, B & C and a uniform heterojunction formation. BET nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for BOBC-40 photocatalyst were obtained to assess the surface area (Fig. S2). BIBC-40 exhibits a typical type-IV isotherm and high surface area of 122.4 m2 g−1 with a pore size of 10.23 nm and pore volume of 0.722 cm3/g. The high surface area is beneficial for excellent photocatalytic activity. 3.1.4 Optical and electrochemical analysis Fig. 5 (a) shows the UV–vis diffuse reflection (UV-DR) spectra for Bi7O9I3, B4C, BIBC-10 and BIBC-30. Bi7O9I3 which is an indirect bandgap semiconductor material shows typical absorption at nearly 630 nm with a low band gap (calculated from Kubelka-Munk plots shown in Fig. 5b) of 1.98 eV [47]. B4C shows a strong absorption in the visible region extended to near infra-red (NIR) region. Both of semiconductors exhibit photo-activity over whole spectrum. The band gap energy (Eg) of B4C was calculated as 2.30 eV. Compared with the bare B4C, formation of heterojunction with Bi7O9I3, leads to red shift. Both the heterojunctions BIBC-10 and BiBC-30 shows high absorption in visible light and NIR region too. Further the conduction band edges (Ecb) were obtained for determining the band structure by calculating flat band potential (Efb) from Mott-Schottky plots (obtained from electrochemical impedance data) as [48]: (1) 1 / C 2 = 2 E app - E fb - k t / e N D ε ε o e A 2 Where, ND is donor density, T is absolute temperature, k is Boltzmann constant, Efb is flat band potential, e is electronic charge, ND, ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of material and in vacuum. Using Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. 5 c-d), Efb for Bi7O9I3 and B4C were calculated as 0.75 V and −0.7 V vs NHE respectively (plots suggest n-type conductivity). For calculating CB edges i.e Ecb we consider that the fact that CB for a n, typical -type semiconductor is approximately 0.1–0.2 eV below the FB [49]. Considering it as 0.2 eV, the Ecb for Bi7O9I3 and B4C are found to be 0.55 and −0.9 eV respectively. Further with aid of Eg and Ecb, the valence band edges (Evb) are 2.50 eV and 1.4 eV vs NHE for Bi7O9I3 and B4C respectively. To ascertain the charge transfer capacity of the heterojunction BIBC, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in dark and corresponding Nyquist plots were obtained (Fig. 5e). The semicircle/arc radius for BIBC-10 and BIBC-30 heterojunctions was very small as compared to bare semiconductors. The smaller radius suggests low impedance and better charge transfer capacity which is due to an effective staggered heterojunction formation. Further photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed to test the charge separation efficiency of the photocatalyst. Fig. 5(f) shows that binary heterojunctions BIBC-10 and BIBC-30 have poor PL intensity (almost flattened curve) with latter being more effective. This indicates that the electron-hole recombination is markedly reduced on the formation of heterojunction. Meanwhile, B4C shows highest PL intensity owing to highest recombination of electron-hole pairs which is substantially reduced on heterojunction formation with Bi7O9I3. The presence of metallic Bio and I3 −/I− redox mediators also facilitate the charge transfer at the interface of the junction leading to better conductivity and lower recombination."
7,Photocatalytic H2 generation with simultaneous norfloxacin removal,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 generation with simultaneous norfloxacin removal 3.2.1 Optimization of material The photocatalytic norfloxacin degradation coupled with H2 evolution was tested under anoxic/anaerobic conditions in visible light. For detailed experiments, firstly the best heterojunction sample (with optimized ratios for best photocatalytic performance for antibiotic degradation and hydrogen evolution) was finalized. Fig. 6 (a) shows the norfloxacin removal (10 mg L−1) in ultrapure water under visible light irradiation with synthesized photocatalysts. The performance of single and binary photocatalysts in a 90 min experiment follows the order BIBC-30 (99.3%) > BIBC-30 (92.3%) > BIBC-20 (84.1%) > BIBC-10 (75.4%) > Bi7O9I3 (51.2%) > B4C (34.5%). The NFN degradation kinetics (Fig. 6b) follows pseudo-first order with apparent constant kapp = 0.05443 min−1 (BIBC-30) which is ∼ 5 times that of B4C. B4C and Bi7O9I3 in spite of low band gap and high visible region activity, show poor NFN removal because of high recombination rate and poor charge transfer capacity. However when junction is formed, the performance improves manifolds. This is attributed to the facile electron charge transfer along the interfaces and high charge carrier separation. The high surface area of the heterojunction BIBC-30 leads to better NFN adsorption and hence faster degradation by generated radicals. These findings are supported by UV-DRS, PL and EIS findings. However the NFN removal falls in case of BIBC-40 because of high content of B4C, as redundant semiconductor becomes center of recombination. 3.2.2 Photocatalytic experiments results Further photocatalytic H2 evolution was also tested in ultrapure water in anoxic medium without any sacrificial agent and results are shown in Fig. 6 (c) and (d). The time profile shows that under 3 h visible light exposure BIBC-30 photocatalyst exhibits 1068.3 μmol g−1H2 evolution. The cumulative H2 evolution shows the following performance order: BIBC-30 (356.4 μmol g−1h−1) > BIBC-30 (322.2 μmol g−1h−1) > BIBC-20 (300.7 μmol g−1h−1) > BIBC-10 (211.2 μmol g−1h−1) > Bi7O9I3 (98.5 μmol g−1h−1) > B4C (66.7 μmol g−1h−1). The binary heterojunctions are able to generate considerably high hydrogen in absence of any noble metal as Pt, scavenger and co-catalyst. The high charge separation and transfer along the interfaces in the heterojunction boosts the hydrogen evolution. Further, the synergistic hydrogen evolution and antibiotic (norfloxacin as target pollutant) degradation was tested under visible light under anoxic/aerobic conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 6 (d) and (e). It was observed that, with BIBC-30 catalyst 2436.3 mmol g−1 evolution was achieved in 3 h illumination. The cumulative H2 production under this condition follows the same order as BIBC-30 (812.4 μmol g−1h−1) > BIBC-30 (714.2 μmol g−1h−1) > BIBC-20 (636.6 μmol g−1h−1) > BIBC-10 (455.5 μmol g−1h−1) > Bi7O9I3 (201.2 μmol g−1h−1) > B4C (143.7 μmol g−1h−1). Analysis of the coupled hydrogen evolution and norfloxacin removal shows that the best sample BIBC-30 is able to degrade 94.2% NFN was removed and simultaneously 812.4 μmol g−1h−1hydrogen was evolved. The hydrogen removal without scavenger is low as compared to use of antibiotic. Another observation shows that during the coupled NFN removal and H2 evolution the NFN removal is 94.1% which is lower than under NFN removal alone (∼100%). However, the H2 evolution is manifolds under the combined process as compared to the alone hydrogen evolution experiments (356.4 μmol g−1h−1). Thus the NFN antibiotic acts as a scavenger during photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and gets degraded in the process. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for BIBC-30 reached 18.3% at 420 nm during sacrificial antibiotic condition which is much higher than H2 evolution under normal conditions (4.2 %). Thus high photon energy conversion efficiency was achieved with excellent charge separation. During the presence of NFN antibiotic as sacrificial agent, the superior H2 evolution is achieved because the holes are consumed by antibiotic molecules directly or indirectly via formation of ●OH radicals and getting degraded. Thus the photogenerated electrons are well-separated and available for hydrogen generation via water. This leaves the photogenerated electrons available for hydrogen evolution. The superior performance of BIBC-30 heterojunction is because of Z-scheme transfer with high separation of electrons-holes, facile charge transfer facilitated by Bio and iodide redox mediator. This has been explained in detail in subsequent sections. The high potential conduction band and valence band are protected for effective hydrogen production and antibiotic pollutant degradation. One most important is that during photocatalytic process, the NFN concentration falls with time, but still the hydrogen evolution increases during the course of reaction. Firstly, this is attributed to the fact that when antibiotic degrades various intermediates are formed which offer more electrons for hydrogen generation [15]. The lower aliphatic intermediates like alcohol, acid, aldehyde molecules etc. formed during the repeated oxidation and degradation (as observed by decreasing total organic carbon removal). Such simpler organic molecules are better sacrificial agents owing to their negative redox potentials [50]. Thus the momentum of hydrogen evolution is maintained and improved. Further the metallic Bi and redox mediator maintain the separation of photogenerated electrons for a better hydrogen evolution experience. As explained in scheme 1 the NFN molecules are directly oxidized by photo-generated holes or by hydroxyl radicals and separated photogenerated electrons bring about hydrogen evolution. As mentioned earlier, the coupled experiments were also performed under oxic/aerated environment and results are shown in Fig. S3. Under oxic or aerobic conditions ∼ 100% NFN degradation was obtained under visible light with 356.4 μmol g−1h−1hydrogen evolution with BIBC-30 heterojunction. With presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) the oxygen molecules get transformed into ●O2 – radical anions which is the rate controlling step as it’s a slow reaction as compared to reaction of holes with water [50].Thus higher and faster NFN degradation is achieved in presence of oxygen as manifested in the results. But the H2 evolution is lower under oxic medium. Thus here two steps are involved- firstly the NFN removal phase (DO consuming step) and H2 evolution (anoxic or anerobic step). Herein, the e- transfer to molecular oxygen and H+ or H2O compete with each other leading to a low hydrogen evolution. However it is important to note that under both oxic and anoxic conditions the hydrogen evolution and NFN (target pollutant) removal simultaneously. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction parameters Among various reaction parameters, the reaction pH optimization is very crucial for norfloxacin degradation (antibiotics aqueous chemistry is pH sensitive) and hydrogen evolution. Fig. 7 (a) shows the effect of initial pH on NFN removal under visible light illumination. The highest NFN degradation was achieved at pH = 5 using BIBC-30 with fall in performance at highly acidic and alkaline medium. The pKa1 and pKa2 values for norfloxacin are 6.34 and 8.75 respectively [51]. In addition, the pH at point of zero charge (pzc) for BIBC-30 catalyst is found to be 4.15. Thus at working pH = 5, the interactions between NFN and catalyst are strong because at this pH the surface of catalyst is negative and that of drug is positive. The better adsorption of drug onto catalyst leads to better degradation [52,53]. The effect of common electrolytes onto NFN removal with BIBC-30 was also studied (Fig. S4). As far as cations are considered, Na+ doesn’t affect the NFN degradation, but Ca2+ ions decrease the rate (0.04214 min−1) because of their co-ordination-complex forming ability. Among anions, sulfate ions reduce the rate to a great extent because they compete with drug molecules for active sites. However, NO3 – ions have lower detrimental effect than SO4 2− because of their capacity of forming ●OH radicals under visible light illumination. The HCO3 – also leads to fall in degradation efficiency (k = 0.03921 min−1) owing to scavenging of ●OH radicals to produce lesser active variant CO3 –● [54]. In presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) the NFN degradation falls because they compete with antibiotic molecules for reactive oxygen species consumption. Fig. 7(b) shows the effect of pH onto hydrogen evolution under visible light in anoxic medium. It was observed that highest evolution of 1212.4 μmol g−1 in 3 h at pH = 3 and 1068.3 μmol g−1 at pH = 5. The hydrogen evolution is favored by acidic conditions and it is manifested in results. However, the highest NFN removal was achieved at pH = 5, and, thus considering the coupled antibiotic removal and hydrogen production, catalyst leaching at extremely acidic environment, pH = 5 was optimized for all experiments. 3.2.4 Photocatalytic mechanism, hydrogen evolution and NFN degradation route To determine the photocatalytic mechanism, various parameters need to be analyzed including the band structure of heterojunction, charge carrier flow, scavenging experiments and other parameters. For radicals identification active during NFN degradation, EDTA-Na, tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and benzoquinone (BQ) were used to scavenge holes, ●OH and ●O2 – respectively and results are shown in Fig. 7(c). The results show that the NFN degradation falls in presence of TBA and EDTA-Na suggesting major role ●OH and photogenerated holes. This is in sync with our explanation of high performance coupled hydrogen evolution and antibiotic degradation. To further test the role of pollutant as sacrificial agents in hydrogen evolution, the experiments were conducted with CH3OH, triethanolamine (TEOA), rhodamine B (RhB) and tetracycline (TC) antibiotic keeping all the conditions same under anoxic conditions. Fig. 7(d) shows the hydrogen evolution performance with other sacrificial agents as TEOA (944.3 μmol g−1h−1) > CH3OH (913.5 μmol g−1h−1) > NFN (812.4 μmol g−1h−1) > TC (765.2 μmol g−1h−1) > RhB (622.1 μmol g−1h−1) > H2O (433.5 μmol g−1h−1). It can be observed that even without any sacrificial agent i.e in presence of ultrapure water, the heterojunction is still able to generate high quantity of hydrogen and NFN degradation. TEOA and CH3OH have a higher contribution for hydrogen evolution. The lone pairs in these molecules are more prone to attack by photogenerated holes which also indirectly lead to photogenerated electron-holes separation ideal for water splitting. In case of rhodamine B as sacrificial agent, the H2 generation is lesser than antibiotics. This due to the fact that RhB has pKa value of 3.7 and at working conditions (pH = 5) the dye exists primarily in anionic form which doesn’t favor the interactions with BIBC-30 photocatalyst. Tetracycline (TC) also shows a small decrease in hydrogen evolution as compared to NFN owing to its pKa values of 9.4, 7.3, and 3.3. At working pH = 5, the antibiotic is in nearly neutral form which leads to limited interactions with catalyst surface. However, it can be observed that different classes of antibiotics can be used as sacrificial agents for a synergistic pollutant removal and hydrogen generation. Few previous experiments have been reported with such observations [55]. Further, the NFN degradation intermediates were identified by the LC-MS technique. Table S1 shows the NFN degradation intermediates as detected with their possible structures obtained from mass spectra obtained after 30 min experiment. The plausible degradation route of NFN during coupled process is shown in scheme 2 . The degradation mechanism involves three pathways/routes: Pathway 1: (Piperazine ring opening and elimination), Pathway 2: (Defluorination) and Pathway 3: (Quinolone moiety cleavage) [56–58]. In the first pathway, Piperazine ring opening occurs with the oxidation of the ring through the attack of ●OH radicals forming products P3 (m/z = 336) and P8 (m/z = 350). Further decarboxylation process in the ring forms products P9 (m/z 322) and P10 (m/z 294) [59]. In the pathway 2, the process of defluorination occurs through the removal of fluorine atom and addition of the –OH group forming product P2 (m/z = 318) which furthers transforms into P6 by the removal of the carboxylic group at terminal position and P6 further changes into P7 by the elimination of the Piperazine ring elimination [60]. Third pathway includes the quinolone moiety cleavage forming product P1 which upon further removal of carboxyl group changes to P4 and P5 groups. Further all these groups are degraded into smaller organic and inorganic molecules (aliphatic molecules with m/z = 118, 149 were detected). Obviously, in due course of reaction, more aliphatic and simpler molecules are formed which were further confirmed by total organic carbon (TOC) removal. Fig. 7(e) shows that after 3 h of coupled hydrogen evolution and NFN degradation with BIBC-30 photocatalyst 76.2% and 65.1% TOC removal with visible light and solar light respectively. Under natural solar light irradiation BIBC exhibits 644.3 μmol g−1h−1H2 evolution. The experiments in oxic and anoxic medium, scavenging experiments and use of various sacrificial agents help in determining photocatalytic mechanism for simultaneous NFN removal and hydrogen generation. As discussed earlier, photogenerated holes and ●OH radicals are active in NFN degradation with little role of ●O2 – radicals which is obvious as medium is anaerobic. So under anoxic environment h+ and ●OH radicals are responsible for NFN degradation and e−/H2O route (electron/ H+ route is less probable because of 5 pH) is responsible for H2 evolution. This is in accordance with literature [61]. As observed in degradation route in scheme 2 the molecular ion peak for NFN is observed at m/z = 320 which is a [M + H+] peak. It can be observed that the degradation intermediate with m/z = 318 is formed via direct oxidation by photogenerated holes. The degradation intermediates detected and the predicted mechanism suggested that no photogenerated electrons were involved in NFN degradation. Thus, electrons were free for hydrogen evolution as per scheme 1. Fig. 8 shows the band structure, alignment and photocatalytic mechanism for the simultaneous hydrogen evolution with NFN degradation with Bi7O9I3/B4C heterojunction. Due to difference in Fermi energy levels of Bi7O9I3 and B4C, the contact between the two leads to development of an internal electric field which makes the transfer of charge carriers along the interface on light exposure. Two photocatalytic mechanisms can be predicted- conventional double charge transfer and Z-scheme. The conventional route will involve the electron migration from CB of B4C (-0.9 eV) to that of Bi7O9I3 (0.55 eV) which is more positive than Eo (H+/H2) = 0.00 eV vs NHE and hence hydrogen evolution is not feasible. On the other hand the holes when moving from VB of Bi7O9I3 to that of B4C (+1.40 eV) where they lose energy to oxidize water because E (●OH/H2O) = 2.27 eV vs NHE. Thus, this mechanism is not feasible as hydrogen cannot be evolved. Though a charge separation is achieved in conventional mechanism and still some hydrogen can be produced due to some accumulated photogenerated electrons, the superior hydrogen evolution and NFN degradation can’t be justified. The energy bands of the semiconductors are such placed that a Z-scheme is feasible. In a Z-scheme transfer the electrons from CB of Bi7O9I3 (0.55 eV) migrate to VB of B4C (1.40 eV) under the effect of internal electric field. The separated photogenerated electrons in CB of B4C (-0.9 eV) have high thermodynamic potential to produce hydrogen via H2O or H+. Similarly, the accumulated holes in VB of Bi7O9I3 (2.50 eV) have enough energy to oxidize water molecules into ●OH radicals. The highly negative CB of B4C leads to high generation of hydrogen via 2e−/2H2O route. But the probability of other common route e−/H+ for hydrogen evolution cannot be completely ignored. The presence of metallic Bio metallic nanodots as confirmed by Bi 4f XPS results help in facile Z-scheme transfer i.e Bi7O9I3 → Bio → B4C. Bi nanodots are beneficial in Z-scheme transfers as reported earlier too [43]. In addition, the presence of I−/I3 − redox (as proven by XPS findings) also facilitate the facile Z-scheme transfer of electrons among Bi7O9I3 and B4C. The Z-scheme charge transfer route was also confirmed by the B.E shifts as discussed in XPS findings. The charge separation in the heterojunction which was proven by EIS and PL findings makes the simultaneous NFN degradation and hydrogen production feasible. The antibiotic as a sacrificial agent leads to manifolds improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and also reduces the cost of hydrogen production for practical applicability. The concentration of pharmaceutical pollutants is quite low in waste water as compared to 10 ppm used in this work. As discussed earlier the simultaneous NFN degradation and hydrogen evolution is due to charge separation via Z-mechanism and via H2O/e− route. Even the holes can directly oxidize organic pollutants making photogenerated electrons accumulate at high potential CB for hydrogen production. Generally, the levels of antibiotic are high before discharge into water bodies which can be used as sacrificial agent source for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. As observed the hydrogen evolution is high enough without any sacrificial agents and catalyst would work efficiently in ultra-low concentrations of antibiotics. However, it is difficult to use low concentration because of limit of detection constraints. Also, the natural organic matter may produce low molecular weight aliphatic compounds which are better electron donors and generate further hydrogen. It’s a fact that hydrogen generation is not favored by dissolved oxygen and works well under anaerobic conditions. This work reports simultaneous hydrogen evolution and antibiotic degradation under anaerobic/anoxic conditions. As far as cost-effectiveness or economy is concerned, we already use a sustainable approach for waste/pollutant induced hydrogen generation. Without any external sacrificial agents high H2 evolution is achieved both under oxic and anoxic conditions which reduces the cost of hydrogen production to a significant level."
8,Reusability and stability analysis,3.3 Reusability and stability analysis The economic viability of the photocatalyst for water treatment and clean energy generation depends on its stability and reusability. Fig. 7(f) shows the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with coupled NFN removal under visible light with BIBC-30 photocatalyst over consecutive cycles. The H2 evolution as well as antibiotic degradation falls marginally after 4 test cycles. The XRD pattern of BIBC-30 photocatalyst before and after test cycle was obtained and shown in Fig. S5. It was observed that except slight intensity changes no abnormal peaks or shifts were obtained which suggests that photocatalyst is stable and strong. The SEM micrograph of BIBC-30 photocatalyst after reuse (Fig. S6) shows that morphology is retained after photocatalytic experiments. Waste-to-energy conversion is obviously an ideal solution for sustainable development. Herein we observe that pollutant can be used as a sacrificial agent for hydrogen evolution powered by visible or solar light.
9,Conclusions,"Focusing waste to energy conversion, this work presents research on wastewater purification coupled to photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The findings confirm the role of antibiotic pollutant as a sacrificial agent or electron donor for hydrogen evolution on visible/solar light irradiation. Bi7O9I3/B4C (30 wt% B4C) i.e BIBC-30 heterojunction under visible light exhibits 812 μmol g−1h−1hydrogen evolution along with 94.2% norfloxacin antibiotic degradation which is manifolds higher than B4C and Bi7O9I3. The photocatalyst shows excellent performance under Sun and in presence of other pollutants and even under oxic conditions. A Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism between Bi7O9I3 and B4C boosted by Bio and I−/I3 − mediators assures highest charge separation and retaining the high energy CB and VB for simultaneous hydrogen generation and norfloxacin degradation. The hydrogen evolution continues to increase in course of time even though the antibiotic concentration falls as the degradation intermediates become better electron donors to boost the H2 generation. Excitingly, this reported work offers further opportunities for develop new hybrid material and technology for addressing dual issues of energy shortage and environmental detoxification in a single process."
