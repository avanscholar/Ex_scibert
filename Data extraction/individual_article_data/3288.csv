0,Introduction,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is viewed as a promising approach to convert solar energy into clean chemical fuels [1–3]. This approach can partly address the increasing demand for energy, also presenting the advantage of addressing the challenge of storage, which is common to all renewable forms of energy [4–6]. Among various semiconductors studied so far, metal oxides exhibit several benefits such as suitable electronic band structures for solar-driven water splitting and corresponding excellent hydrogen (H2) generation performance, as well as superior chemical and photo stability [7,8]. However, the typically large bandgap of metal oxide semiconductors (E g ≥ 3 eV), such as TiO2 and ZnO, seriously limit their performance in optoelectronic devices due to the narrow light absorption range, only being responsive to ultraviolet (UV) photons which represent a mere ~5% of the full solar spectrum [9]. Extending the photo-response region is therefore essential to increase the efficiency of solar energy conversion. In this context, the combination of large band-gap metal oxide semiconductors with photosensitizers, including plasmonic nanocrystals [10,11], dyes [9], and QDs [12–14] has been widely explored to harvest visible or even near-infrared (NIR) photons to obtain higher power conversion efficiencies. Integrating QDs with large bandgap semiconductors (e.g. TiO2, ZnO etc.) to construct highly efficient heterostructured photoanodes for PEC water splitting is therefore considered promising due to the unique optoelectronic properties of QDs, in particular their tunable and broad absorption range from the visible to NIR [12,13] and the possibility of multiple exciton generation (MEG) and hot electron extraction before thermalization [15,16]. QDs absorb incident photons to generate electron-hole pairs (so-called “excitons”), which subsequently migrate and separate at the QDs/TiO2/electrolyte interface due to the energetically favourable electronic band-alignment. Then the separated holes oxidize water or hole scavenger molecules, whereas electrons transfer through the external circuit and reduce water to form H2 at the counter electrode, respectively. Up to now, most high performance PEC devices for H2 generation employed extensively metal chalcogenide QDs, such as CdS [17,18], PbS [19,20], CdSe [21], as well as their structured composites [22–26] to harvest a broader portion of the solar spectrum. Despite the outstanding efficiency and stable performance, the high toxicity of heavy metals (Cd and Pb) in QDs are a major drawback for commercial-scale applications. To address this issue, a number of heavy metal-free QDs have been developed. For instance, Zn-treated spherical CuInSe2/CuInS2 “giant” QDs can be synthesized by the sequential cation exchange method using CdSe/CdS core/thin shell QDs as a template [27]. Zn-CuInSe2/CuInS2 “giant” QDs sensitized TiO2 photoanode displays an excellent saturated photocurrent density of ~3.1 mA cm−2 and maintain 80% of initial value of photocurrent density after 2 h of continuous one sun illumination. On the other hand, the precursors of the template CdSe/CdS core/thin shell QDs are toxic. Heavy metal-free and NIR photons sensitive CuInSexS2−x/ZnS core/shell QDs designed for integration with TiO2 photoanodes exhibit a saturated photocurrent density of ~5.3 mA cm−2 under one sun illumination [28]. Similarly, other heavy metal-free colloidal QDs, such as carbon dots [29], graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) [30], Si [31], AgInS2 [32], Zn doped AgIn5S8 [33], InP [34] etc., are also being widely studied. However, the low energy conversion efficiencies and limited long-term operational stabilities are still major unresolved challenges, which motivated us to design and synthesize alternative heavy metal-free, efficient, and stable QDs. Environmentally friendly copper (Cu) doped ternary semiconductor nanocrystals have been recently developed as a class of colour tunable and efficient light emitters [35,36]. By adjusting the molar concentration of Cu dopants and varying the Zn:In ratios, the UV–vis–NIR absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra window can be tuned to harvest a broader range of photons, towards optimal use of solar energy [36–38]. Moreover, other unique merits including the long lifetime of charge carriers [37,39] and suitable band structure [37] for water splitting, suggest the enormous advantages of solar-driven PEC H2 production. In this work, we report the synthesis of Cu doped ZISe QDs with varied nominal molar ratios of Cu dopants (0–15%) and Zn:In ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6) by the modified hot injection method. The QDs were then uniformly anchored onto the mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes via electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Subsequently, two layers of ZnS were deposited on the heterostructured films by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) to reduce the photo-corrosion effect of selenides as well as the leakage of electrons from photoanode to electrolyte. We then report the systematic investigation of carrier dynamics by tuning the QDs’ composition and correlating it with device performance. The PEC performance is found to be strongly dependent on the composition of colloidal Cu doped ZISe QDs. Briefly, PEC devices based on optimized QDs (Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4)/TiO2 yield unprecedented values of saturated photocurrent density of ~11.23 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) using Na2S/Na2SO3 electrolyte as hole scavenger. This is the highest photocurrent density as yet reported for heavy metal-free colloidal QDs based PEC cells. Deeper insights into the relationships of broader light absorption, enhanced carriers’ lifetime and extraction rates, and suitable electronic band structures of the optimized colloidal QDs lead to an excellent performance of H2 production. Our findings suggest that Cu doped ZISe QDs can be employed as efficient light harvesters in PEC devices towards the production of high efficiency, inexpensive and environmentally friendly solar-driven chemical fuels."
1,Results and discussion,"In addition to the rational design of device architectures, developing high efficiency heavy metal-free colloidal QDs to extend solar absorption is an alternative effective strategy to enhance the performance of PEC cells. Here, Cu doped ZISe colloidal QDs were synthesized via a slightly modified hot injection method by tailoring the Cu ions concentration and Zn:In molar ratios [37]. Primarily, for the purpose of revealing the influence of Cu doping on the microstructure of ZISe QDs, Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 and Cu(0%):ZISe-1:4 QDs were selected as case studies to carry out imaging by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). No morphology evolution is observed, which may be attributed to the relatively small proportion of Cu ions ( Fig. 1a and b). Similarly, changes in the Zn:In ratio also have almost no effect on the morphology (Fig. S1). However, the interplanar distance of 0.34 nm, indexing the (111) plane of Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 and Cu(0%):ZISe-1:4, is slightly larger than the standard (111) plane space of pure ZnSe (0.32 nm, JCPDS 80-0021). The incorporation of larger In3+ ions (r = 0.94 Å) to replace Zn2+ (r = 0.88 Å) expands the crystal plane distances [36]. Moreover, according to the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 1c and d), no diffraction patterns arising from InSe were recorded, further pointing to the replacement of Zn2+ by In3+. After introducing Cu2+ in the synthesis process, no signals arising from Cu compounds (e.g. CuSe, etc.) were detected in the obtained QDs, confirming the successful incorporation of Cu into the ZISe structure, instead of forming undesired impurities. XRD patterns of concerned QDs (Fig. 1g) correspond to the zinc blende phase of ZnSe QDs (JCPDS 80-0021) [36]. On the other hand, the 2θ corresponding to (111) crystal plane has a slightly negative shift, representing a larger crystal distance compared to ZnSe after introducing In3+ into its chemical structure. These observations confirm the above derived conclusions from TEM images. In addition, the average diameter is 3.1 ± 0.6 nm and 3.0 ± 0.5 nm for Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 and Cu(0%):ZISe-1:4 QDs (Fig. 1e and f), respectively, also indicating the limited effect of Cu doping on the size of ZISe QDs. The successful incorporation of Cu can be directly demonstrated by acquiring energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra (Fig. 1h). Besides C and O, element Cu, In, Zn, Se, and S are clearly detected in Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs. However, the S originates from the pyrolysis of 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) molecules under high temperature in the synthesis procedures. In addition, as listed in Table S1, slight deviations of elemental contents in the QDs are observed by comparing the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) results with the nominal dosage of precursors. Taking Cu(5%):ZISe-1:2 QDs as a typical example, its nominal molar ratio of Cu/(Zn+In) was set as 0.05, while the detected true value is 0.0379. The ratio of In:Zn was detected as 2.20, which also gives a deviation from the nominal value 2. Such deviations possibly arise from the different chemical reactivities of Cu2+, Zn2+, and In3+ cations in the stock solution [37,40]. The real values of In:Zn ratios increase with the nominal increment of In content. No Cu2+ ions were detected in Cu(0%):ZISe-1:2 QDs. Consequently, the desired QDs were successfully synthesized with deliberately designed variations in content of Cu and In:Zn ratio. The chemical states of elemental Cu, Zn and In of as-synthesized Cu doped ZISe QDs were examined by XPS. The Cu 2p spin orbit is split into two peaks of Cu doped ZISe QDs (Fig. 1i). The Cu 2p3/2 component around 932.1 eV can be assigned to Cu+ [41,42], although the bivalent Cu(OAc)2·H2O was used as precursor. The conversion of Cu2+ to Cu+ was proposed to arise from the doping process [43] and/or the presence of fatty amines [44]. No Cu component was detected in Cu(0%):ZISe-1:2 QDs. The binding energies around 1021.8 eV and 445 eV corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 (Fig. 1j) and In 3d5/2 (Fig. 1k) indicate that the chemical states of Zn and In are + 2 and + 3, respectively [42,45]. UV–visible absorption spectra (all the spectra were normalized by the absorbance value at 400 nm) of as-prepared QDs are shown in Fig. 2(a). No excitonic absorption peak is observed, which could be attributed to their irregular elemental distribution and/or intra bandgap states [46,47]. In detail, ZISe QDs without Cu dopant show an absorption edge around 547 nm (Table S2) and simultaneously, have a relatively weak PL emission signal around 770 nm in the NIR region (Fig. S2). After incorporating Cu+ ions (Cu = 2%) in ZISe QDs, the absorption edge of newly synthesized QDs extends to 595 nm. Meanwhile, a distinct PL emission peak is detected at 669 nm. Previous work showed that the PL emission of Cu doped nanocrystals originates from the recombination of electrons in the conduction band of a host semiconductor material with holes in the Cu T2 states (Fig. 2c) [48,49]. Accordingly, in our case, the Cu+ ions play the role of phosphors in the Cu doped ZISe QDs. Moreover, by changing the Cu molar ratio from 0% to 15% in ZISe QDs, we tuned the absorption edge window from 547 to 647 nm and the PL emission window from 669 to 698 nm. On the other hand, as displayed in Fig. 2b, the optical properties also are extremely sensitive with respect to the Zn:In ratios. Briefly, the absorption edge gradually shifts from 563 to 676 nm, and the PL emission centre moves from 653 to 769 nm, by varying the Zn:In ratio from 1:1–1:6, respectively. Considering that the changed Zn:In ratio does not tailor the size and morphology of QDs, we infer that the tuned optical properties may be attributed to the continuous replacement of Zn sites by In ions. Since the band gap of bulk ZnSe (2.7 eV) is larger than that of bulk In2Se3 (1.8 eV), we expect that a lower Zn:In ratio in alloyed QDs would shift the absorption edge and PL emission centre towards longer wavelength [36]. Thus, increasing the In content in the Cu doped ZISe QDs can effectively broaden solar absorption, which enhances the performance of QDs based PEC devices. Elemental composition dependent transient PL decay curves were measured to detect the lifetime of photo-induced charge carriers, a crucial performance parameter in PEC devices. Due to the relatively weak PL emission intensity, it was impossible to measure the transient decay curve from pure ZISe QDs (Fig. S2). Other measured transient PL decay curves were fitted according to the following equation: (1) < τ > = a 1 τ 1 2 + a 2 τ 2 2 + a 3 τ 3 2 a 1 τ 1 + a 2 τ 2 + a 3 τ 3 where ai (i = 1, 2, 3) are the coefficients of fitting parameters, and τi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the characteristic lifetimes, respectively. The PL lifetime is defined by following three major processes, including the short lifetime (τ1) of the non-radiative process, the medium lifetime (τ2) relative to the radiative process for the photogenerated carrier recombination, and the long lifetime (τ3) representing the energy transfer process [50]. The fitting parameters and calculated average charge carrier lifetimes (<τ > ) of all prepared QDs are listed in Table S3. For the different amount of Cu ions doped ZISe-1:2 QDs (Fig. 2d–f), the charge carrier lifetime is first prolonged (from 133 ns to 154 ns) with the increasing molar ratio of Cu ions (from 2% to 5%), then shortened (from 154 to 113 ns) for further adding Cu ions (10%), respectively. Cu doped ZISe-1:2 QDs with 5% nominal percentage, namely Cu(5%):ZISe-1:2 QDs, exhibit the longest charge carrier lifetime (154 ns), indicating that both inadequate and superfluous dopants would result in faster recombination of photo-excited charges. The prolonged lifetime should be mainly attributed to the prolonged τ3 relating to the energy transfer process affected by the surface defect states and intrinsic deep donor-acceptor states that depend sensitively on the dopant [51]. Regarding the influence of the Zn:In ratio, by comparing ZISe QDs with varied Zn:In ratio and fixed Cu ion concentration as 5% (Fig. 2e, g, and h) and corresponding fitting values (Table S3), the variation of the Zn/In ratio significantly changes the relative weights a1 and a3. Meanwhile, the decreasing Zn/In value shortens the τ1 and prolongs τ3, indicating the inhibition of non-radiative processes and promotion of energy transfer processes. As a result, the average lifetime value is significantly enhanced by increasing the In content. For instance, the lifetime values measured from Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 and Cu(5%):ZISe-1:6 are 187 ns and 692 ns, respectively. Generally, prolonged lifetime increases the number of charge carriers that, following separation and transfer, can participate in the H2 production reaction and therefore generally contributes to improving PEC performance. The bandgap of Cu doped ZISe QDs depends on the Zn:In ratio (Fig. S3), because of the smaller bandgap of In2Se3 compared to ZnSe as mentioned above [36]. Here, the bandgap of the alloyed ZISe QDs is 2.07 eV, which falls in the bandgap range of In2Se3 (1.8 eV) and ZnSe (2.7 eV). Thus, both the incorporation of Cu ions into the structure of ZISe QDs and the increasing content of In result in the reduction of bandgaps. As listed in Table S5, the bandgap values are 1.93, 1.86 and 1.79 eV for Cu(5%):ZISe-1:2, Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4, and Cu(5%):ZISe-1:6, respectively. According to ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data (Fig. S4 and Table S5), introducing Cu ions can significantly modify the electronic structure of QDs. Obviously, The position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Cu doped ZISe QDs gradually increases with the increasing amount of In, which is consistent with previous report [37]. By combining the calculated energy band structures (Fig. S5) with the measured HOMO values, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) positions can be derived (Table S5). The obtained band structure information is schematically illustrated in Fig. S5. Clearly, the LUMO potentials of Cu doped ZISe QDs become more negative by decreasing the Zn:In ratio from 1:2–1:6. In addition, on the basis of the band structure of TiO2 [1], the relative LUMO positions of QDs with the conduction band minimum (CBM) of TiO2 are displayed in Fig. S5. The potential of TiO2 CBM is more positive than that of QDs LUMO. Therefore, photo-excited electrons in the QDs will rapidly be injected into the TiO2 conduction band and thus realize spatial separation with the holes in the HOMO. This efficient separation of photo-induced charge carriers enhances the PEC cell performance. The synthesis prepration procedure for TiO2 photoanodes consists in depositing a compact blocking TiO2 layer on a clean FTO substrate, then sintering mesoporous TiO2 as the second layer (see Experimental Section). QDs sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were prepared by EPD, where colloidal QDs are deposited onto the mesoporous TiO2 film by applying a voltage of 200 V between two electrodes for 120 min [52,53]. The schematic diagram of the QDs sensitized TiO2 film is displayed in Fig. 3(a). An image of the as-realized TiO2/Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs photoanode is displayed in Fig. 3(b). The active area of 0.16 ± 0.5 cm2 was used for testing the PEC cells, while the other part of the photoanodes was covered with epoxy resin to passivate it from the aqueous electrolyte. The thickness of the TiO2 film was determined to be around ~21.2 µm by measuring the cross-section SEM image of the photoanode (Fig. 3c). The EDS elemental mapping of Cu doped ZISe QDs sensitized TiO2 mesoporous film is shown in Fig. 3(d)–(i). The homogeneous distribution of Cu, Zn, In, and Se in the TiO2 mesoporous film confirm the uniform distribution of Cu doped ZISe QDs in the TiO2 photoanode. In addition, the uniform brown color in the digital photo of QDs sensitized TiO2 mesoporous film (Fig. 3b) also indicates that Cu doped ZISe QDs are uniformly deposited in the mesoporous TiO2 film. Subsequently, we measured the PL decay curves of Cu doped ZISe QDs on different carrier scavengers to obtain the charge transfer rate between different components, including TiO2 and ZrO2 substrates, and the ZrO2 substrate with electrolyte solution. The electrolyte, composed of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH ≈ 13), serves as a hole scavenger. Due to the lower position of the TiO2 CBM than the QDs LUMO, TiO2 can act as an electron acceptor. Regarding ZrO2, its bandgap is as wide as ~5 eV and CBM potential is more negative than the LUMO of QDs [54]. Therefore, slow electron transfer kinetics is desired in composite QDs/ZrO2 compared to QDs/TiO2 and QDs/ZrO2-electrolyte and considered as a benchmark to investigate the carrier dynamics of QDs. The results of the measured transient PL spectra are consistent with the expected tendency in each case ( Fig. 4). The average charge carrier lifetimes were calculated according to Eq. (1) and are listed in Table 1. Other fitting parameters are fully listed in the Table S4. Due to the different interaction environment for QDs, the lifetime of electrons in the metal oxide film displays a notable change to the case of the toluene solution. For each kind of QDs, the slowest electron transfer kinetics is obtained when the QDs are supported on a ZrO2 substrate, since the electronic band structure of ZrO2 is not suitable for accepting electrons from QDs. After replacing the ZrO2 by TiO2, the fastest electron transfer kinetics would be achieved due to the immediate extraction of electrons by TiO2. Similarly, the charge transfer kinetics can also be accelerated by the consumption of photo-generated holes after adding the electrolyte. In addition, we exclude the possibility of energy transfer from QDs to the metal oxide film because the PL emission spectrum of QDs does not overlap with the absorption spectrum of the metal oxide film [24]. Thus, we infer that the outline of the PL decay curve sensitively depends on the transfer rates of electrons or holes from QDs to the carrier scavenger. And the QDs/ZrO2 system is considered as reference to calculate the charge carrier lifetime and transfer rates. According to these calculated lifetimes, the electron (hole) transfer rate, k et (k ht ), can be calculated via the following equation [55,56]: (2) k et or ht = 1 < τ > QDs / e ( or h ) scaverger − 1 < τ > QDs / Zr O 2 where < τ > QDs / e ( or h ) scavenger and < τ > QDs / ZrO 2 represents the average lifetime of QDs/TiO2 (or QDs/ZrO2-electrolyte) and QDs/ZrO2, respectively. Among these inspected samples, Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs shows the highest electron (2.19 ×107 s−1) and hole transfer rate (0.39 ×107 s−1) to TiO2 and the electrolyte, respectively. According to the relative position of QDs LUMO and TiO2 CBM (Fig. S5), with the increased In contents, the photo-induced electrons in QDs have a stronger reduction ability, which can improve the charge carrier injection rate to TiO2. On the other hand, the valence band maximum (VBM) concurrently becomes more negative with the incremental In component. Inevitably, the oxidative ability of photo-generated holes is gradually diminished causing the holes migration rate to be the rate-determining step, thus, in turn decreases the electron transfer rate. Consequently, the electron and hole transfer abilities depending on the Zn:In ratio and Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs achieve better charge dynamic properties compared to Cu(5%):ZISe-1:2 or Cu(5%):ZISe-1:6 QDs. As proof of concept, PEC devices were fabricated using as synthesized Cu-doped ZISe QDs. Before the PEC measurements, two successive ZnS layers were coated on the prepared photoanode after completing the EPD process to improve resistance to photo-corrosion. Subsequently, PEC performance measurements were conducted in dark, continuous and chopped illumination conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW·cm−2) using a standard three electrodes system. The schematic diagram of the PEC cell is illustrated in Fig. 5(a), for a simple display where the reference electrode is not shown. The current density curves over applied potential (vs. RHE) of the fabricated Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2 photoanodes are displayed in Fig. 5(b)–(d). In particular, the effect of Cu ions doping and tailoring of In:Se ratio in Cu doped ZISe QDs on the photocurrent density of QDs based PEC cell is shown in Fig. 5(b). Under dark, no evident current density is detected from any PEC cell. Without Cu dopant, the ZISe-1:2 QDs sensitized TiO2 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 1.66 mA cm−2 for an applied potential of 0.8 V vs. RHE. Compared with a pure TiO2 photoanode (0.8 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE, Fig. S6), it already shows 100% improvement after sensitization with undoped ZISe QDs. The incorporation of Cu ions, (nominal molar percentage as 2%) in ZISe-1:2 QDs, significantly enhances the saturated photocurrent density to 2.55 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE. The optimal Cu ions atomic percentage is 5%, corresponding to a saturated photocurrent density of 6.22 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE, which is 375% higher than that of the PEC device based on ZISe-1:2 QDs/TiO2. Further Cu ions doping leads to a significant decrease of photocurrent density, which may be ascribed to higher Cu ion dopant (10–15%) leading to increases the non-radiative charge recombination, thus shortening the lifetime of photo-induced electrons and overall degrading the performance [57]. In addition, by optimizing and fixing the Cu ions molar percentage as 5% and altering the Zn:In ratio, the highest saturated photocurrent density increases up to 11.23 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE for the Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs/TiO2 photoanode, which is 677% and 181% higher than that of PEC devices based on ZISe-1:2 QDs/TiO2 and Cu(5%):ZISe-1:2 QDs/TiO2, respectively. This excellent performance is attributed to the higher electrons transfer rate from the optimized QDs (Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4) to TiO2, and holes transfer rate to the electrolyte compared to electron-hole transfer rate of ZISe QDs with TiO2 and electrolyte. Photo-induced electrons of Cu(5%):ZISe-1:6 QDs in toluene solution have the longest lifetime (Table S3). However, after these QDs are deposited onto a mesoporous TiO2 film, the charge carriers’ lifetime was drastically shortened (Table 1). This can be attributed to the changed environment of QDs in photoanode and toluene. In the former, photo-generated electrons would be immediately extracted out from QDs due to the tight contact and suitable band alignment between QDs and TiO2. However, the QDs were capped and stabilized by the DDT molecules in toluene, inhibiting efficient transfer of photo-generated electrons, thus leading to a long lifetime. On the other hand, as discussed before, the decreased oxidative ability of photo-generated holes for Cu(5%):ZISe-1:6 QDs also in turn slow charge carrier transfer rate. Consequently, further promoting the In proportion gives rise to a drastic decrease in current density (Fig. 5c). From the foregoing, Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs can be screened out as the most efficient solar light harvesters for PEC cell based H2 production. To the best of our knowledge, the Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2 photoanode possesses the highest saturated photocurrent density among eco-friendly QDs based PEC H2 production cells compared to previous reports (Table S6), for instance, Ag2S (0.6 mA cm−2) [58], CuInS2 (2 mA cm−2) [59], CuInSeS (0.3 mA cm−2) [60], Zn-treated spherical CuInSe2/CuInS2 (3.1 mA cm−2) [27], Mn-alloyed CuInS2 (~5.7 mA cm−2) [61], AgInS2 (~5.7 mA cm−2) [62], etc. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) tests of Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2 and bare TiO2 photoanodes are displayed in Fig. S7. The bare TiO2 photoanode has obvious IPCE values below 420 nm. After depositing Cu doped ZISe QDs on the TiO2 photoanode, evident IPCE results are recorded up to 700 nm due to the wide-spectrum light absorption capacity (Fig. 2b). In particular, the IPCE at 400 nm is 4.6% for the bare TiO2 photoanode. It improves significantly to 16.2% after depositing Cu:ZISe-1:4 QDs, demonstrating the excellent potential of Cu doped ZISe QDs as light harvesters. The improved IPCE values should be ascribed to the higher density of photo-induced charge carriers and faster charge charier separation/transfer by forming the heterojunction. Further, the absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) curves of Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2 and bare TiO2 photoanodes (Fig. S9) were calculated according to the obtained IPCE results and the measured optical properties of the respective photoanodes (Fig. S8). The photoanode of Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2 exhibits a significantly larger APCE value at each wavelength than that of bare TiO2 photoanode. For instance, at 400 nm, the APCE for TiO2 photoanode and Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2 photoanode is 14.7% and 26.9%, respectively. This result represents a more efficient conversion of absorbed photons to chemical fuels, further indicative of faster charge carrier separation/transfer in the QDs sensitized photoanode. As a result, the Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2 photoanode yields an excellent PEC performance. In terms of PEC stability, as shown in Fig. 5(e), the photocurrent density maintains ~60% of its initial value after 6000 s successive PEC H2 production measurements. After the long-term reaction, according to the cross-section image, the main structure of tested TiO2 mesoporous support (Fig. S10) is kept similar to the fresh one (Fig. 3), indicating that the TiO2 is retained. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the ~40% performance loss can be mainly attributed to the photo-corrosion of chalcogenide QDs [27,28,63]. A promising approach to resolve this issue is to deposit stable passivating layers such as ZnS or ZnSe [28], h-BN flakes or amorphous TiO2, on the surface of Cu doped ZISe QDs/TiO2. In addition to its use for PEC H2 production, the newly designed photoanode may also be used for generating added-value products, such as oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), benzylic alcohols, etc. [64], which we plan to explore in future studies."
2,Conclusions and perspectives,"In summary, environmentally friendly Cu doped ZISe QDs were synthesized and employed as solar energy harvesters to improve the H2 production performance of TiO2 mesoporous photoanode based PEC devices. By optimizing the Cu ions percentage, as well as the Zn:In atomic ratio in the synthesis procedure, the optical properties and electronic structure of the QDs, charge carriers’ lifetime and charge transport can be fine-tuned. Subsequently, energy band structure analysis reveals efficient charge carrier separation at QDs/TiO2 and electrolyte/QDs/TiO2 interfaces. The Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs have a longer charge carrier lifetime and faster charge carrier injection rates than ZISe QDs. This improved carrier dynamics in Cu(5%):ZISe-1:4 QDs leads to the efficient separation of electron/hole pairs and offers sufficient time to the charge carriers to participate in the water-splitting reactions. Under one sun irradiation and in the presence of Na2S/Na2SO3 electrolyte (pH ≈ 13) used as scavenger, we obtained an unprecedented saturated photocurrent density of 11.23 mA·cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE, the highest photocurrent density among eco-friendly QDs sensitized PEC cells reported so far. This highlights the possibility to explore the promising optoelectronic properties of optimized Cu-doped ZISe QDs to develop more efficient and stable optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic devices and photodectors. Future research directions may focus on enhancing the long-term operational stability of eco-friendly QDs based PEC system by developing the in situ growth of passivating shell layers of ZnS or ZnSe on Cu doped ZISe QDs (i.e. constructing core/shell heterostructure) and engineering the interface of QDs/TiO2 or electrolyte/QDs by incorporating h-BN nanoflakes and amorphous TiO2 interfacial layers."
