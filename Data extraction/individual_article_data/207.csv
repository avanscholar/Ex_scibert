0,Introduction,"Non-renewable fossil fuels are the primary source of energy production worldwide. On the other hand, the extraction process and transport of fossil fuels cause air and water pollution, and their combustion results in the emissions of toxins and global warming [1]. Understanding these impacts underscores the real cost and risks of fossil fuels to public health and the environment, which necessitates the supply of alternative clean and renewable energy sources. Bio-oil, a liquid fuel obtained from the fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, is a noteworthy renewable energy source and an environmentally friendly solution to overcome the challenges of greenhouse gases emissions and global warming derived from fossil fuels utilization [2–5]. However, such destructive properties as high oxygen/water content, high corrosiveness, high viscosity, and low heating value, limit the use of crude bio-oil as a fuel in the current fuel infrastructure. Therefore, the crude bio-oil needs to be upgraded to eliminate those critical defects and enhance its quality [4,5]. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation/hydrocracking is one of the most influential techniques for bio-oil upgrading [6–10], and it is usually operated at H2 gas pressure of 50–350 bar (supplied from an external source) and temperatures of 150–450 °C [11–13]. The severe operating conditions of bio-oil upgrading using hydrogen gas makes the entire process difficult to control because of the safety issues derived from high flammability of hydrogen gas in contact with air. Therefore, several studies have focused on removing the need for H2 gas by identifying another method that is as effective as hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen, but employing mild and safe operating conditions. Transfer hydrogenation or in-situ hydrogenation, in which hydrogen species (atom/ion) are generated from a hydrogen donor (H-donor) agent and transferred to an acceptor molecule [14], is a possible alternative technique for catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen gas in bio-oil upgrading in terms of safety and easy control. Mechanistically, chemicals with high reducing activity, such as alcohols [15–19], can be appropriate candidates for H-donors in the in-situ hydrogenation process. In addition, the use of a proper catalyst might improve the efficiency of the reaction, and it is advantageous to design catalysts that facilitate the activation of reactants (H-donor and acceptor molecules), hydrogen liberation, and hydrogen exchange simultaneously. Practically, materials with high redox properties and oxygen storage capacity (oxygen vacancy sites), such as cerium oxide (ceria), can potentially activate the reactants and prepare them for further dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions in the in-situ hydrogenation process [20–22]. Because hydrogen-related reactions are usually catalyzed over a metallic site (noble or transition metals), the presence of a suitable metal catalyst with a strong interaction with oxygen vacancies in the catalytic system is vital to enhance the overall performance of the catalyst. Despite the unique catalytic character of ceria, it has rarely been used in in-situ hydrogenation reactions [21–25]. For instance, Shimura and Shimizu [25] examined the catalytic in-situ hydrogenation of aliphatic and aromatic ketones with 2-PrOH over Ni/CeO2, in which ceria promoted the reactivity of nickel species. Nelson et al. investigated the activity of Pd supported on CeO2 [22] and Na-modified CeO2 [21] for the in-situ hydrogenation of phenol using 2-PrOH. Pd/Na-CeO2 led to a higher efficiency of phenol transformation because sodium modification of CeO2 supplied more oxygen-deficient sites for the adsorption/activation of reactants. Recently, there have been several studies on the in-situ hydrogenation of different model compounds of bio-oil [22,26–34], while far fewer studies have examined the in-situ hydrogenation of crude bio-oil [26–28,34]. Phenolic compounds can be an interesting selection among the different bio-oil components for a model reaction study because of the high reactivity of the phenolic fraction of bio-oil causing its instability, and their conversion into stable chemicals is valued. Ying et al. [26] reported that the in-situ hydrogenation of phenol with methanol on Raney Ni resulted in the production of saturated cyclic compounds, cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which are chemically more stable than phenol. In addition, hydrogen generated from acetic acid and formic acid via a reforming reaction over a carbon-supported palladium (Pd/C) catalyst was used for the hydrogenation of phenol to mainly cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol [30]. Over Ni-Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, p-cresol was transformed into 4-methylcyclohexanone, 4-methylcyclohexanol (main product), methylcyclohexane, and toluene by means of 2-PrOH H-donor [27]. Feng et al. [29] reported that Raney Ni led to the formation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanol-derivatives in the in-situ hydrogenation of guaiacol employing methanol as the hydrogen generator. In the present study, the focus was to design an effective catalytic system for the in-situ hydrogenation of both bio-oil and its phenolic model compound of m-cresol. Hence, mesoporous ceria was synthesized and used as a support material of Ni, Cu, and Co catalysts for the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol with the secondary alcohols of 2-BuOH and 2-PrOH, whereas no hydrogen gas was utilized. The Ni/CeO2 was used as a catalyst for further experiments to examine the effects of the reaction time (4–6 h) and Ni loading (3–9 wt%) on m-cresol transformation into saturated cyclic compounds, such as 3-methylcyclohexanol. Methylcyclohexanol is chemically valuable that can be utilized commercially as the building block of nylon materials. The feasibility of hydrogen production from 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH over Ni/CeO2 was examined by exploring the compositions of gas and liquid products of the reactions. Furthermore, the potential of 2-BuOH and 2-PrOH as H-source for the transformation of m-cresol to saturated cyclic compounds was compared with that of H2 gas. The in-situ hydrogenation of phenol, anisole, and guaiacol, as other phenolic compounds of bio-oil, were also conducted over Ni/CeO2 using 2-PrOH as the H-donor. The reusability of the synthesized Ni/CeO2 was tested by recycling the spent catalyst. A crude bio-oil was also upgraded through in-situ hydrogenation reactions with 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH over a Ni/CeO2 catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials m-Cresol (99%, SIGMA-ALDRICH), phenol (99%, SAMCHUN CHEMICALS), anisole (99.7%, anhydrous, SIGMA-ALDRICH), guaiacol (98%, Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI)), and raw bio-oil (from pyrolysis of woody biomass) were treated as the feedstock. The secondary alcohols, 2-propanol (2-PrOH, 99.5%) and 2-butanol (2-BuOH, 99%) purchased from SAMCHUN, were employed as the hydrogen sources (H-donors). Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate, and copper(II) nitrate trihydrate were purchased from SIGMA-ALDRICH and used as the metal precursors. Cerium(IV) oxide (99.9% trace metal basis, SIGMA-ALDRICH) was used as a commercial catalyst support (Com. CeO2)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The thermally stable mesoporous cerium oxide (ceria) was synthesized under supercritical conditions according to the method described by Kim et al. [35,36]. The synthesized (CeO2) and commercial (Com. CeO2) ceria samples were calcined at 550 °C (heating rate 3 °C/min) for 9 h before being used as a catalyst support. Ni-, Cu-, and Co-loaded CeO2 were prepared by the wetness impregnation method using aqueous solutions of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate, copper(II) nitrate trihydrate, and cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate, respectively. The metal impregnated CeO2 (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt% for Ni, and 5 wt% for Cu and Co) was dried at 110 °C for 24 h, and calcined in air at 550 °C (heating rate 3 °C/min) for 9 h. The synthesized catalysts were called as xM/CeO2, in which x is the metal loading and M is the metal name. For instance, 5 wt% Ni loaded on CeO2 is called 5Ni/CeO2. Before the experiments, the catalysts were reduced (at 300 °C for 3 h) under a 100 ml/min flow of 10 mol% H2/90 mol% N2."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The adsorption/desorption isotherms of N2 at −196 °C were measured with Micromeritics 3Flex 3.02 for all the catalyst samples (CeO2 and metal impregnated CeO2). The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated from the linear form of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. The pore volume distribution of the catalyst was determined at P/P0 = 0.99. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) technique was used to evaluate the density and strength of the acid sites of CeO2 and metal impregnated CeO2 samples. In a BEL CAT B (BEL JAPAN Inc.), a 50 ml/min flow of He was passed through the sample for 1 h at 550 °C. The adsorption step was accomplished by passing a 50 ml/min flow of 95% He/5% NH3 at 100 °C, allowing sufficient time (30 min) for saturation. The adsorption step was followed by purging a 50 ml/min flow of He for 30 min at 100 °C, and the desorption curve of ammonia was then recorded by increasing the sample temperature to 900 °C (10 °C/min) under a He flow. The reduction behavior of the metal impregnated CeO2 samples was analyzed by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) method employing the same apparatus as NH3-TPD. Initially, a 50 ml/min flow of He was passed through the sample for 1 h at 550 °C. After cooling the sample to room temperature, the hydrogen adsorption on the catalysts was recorded by increasing the sample temperature to 900 °C (10 °C/min) under a 30 ml/min flow of 90% He/10% H2. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the crystallinity and identify the metal oxide phases of the catalysts. The XRD patterns were recorded over the range of 10–90° 2θ at a scan rate of 0.05°/s. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector was used to examine the morphology and elemental composition of the CeO2 and metal-impregnated CeO2 samples."
5,General procedure for in-situ hydrogenation experiments,"2.4 General procedure for in-situ hydrogenation experiments A 30.5 g mixture of phenolics/H-donor (0.5/30 g/g phenolics/H-donor) or a 30.0 g mixture of bio-oil/H-donor (7.5/22.5 g/g bio-oil/H-donor) was added to a 100 ml batch reactor (Parr Instrument Company, Series 4598, USA) containing a water cooling solenoid and magnetic drive stirrer. A certain amount of catalyst (1 g) was put into the reactor under a nitrogen flow in a glovebox. The loaded reactor was sealed and the oxygen inside the reaction vessel was evacuated by the nitrogen flow. Subsequently, the reactor was pressurized with 10 bar of nitrogen gas and then heated. The in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil/bio-oil model compounds was conducted at 230 °C with 500 rpm stirring rate. After 4–6 h, when the reaction was complete, the reactor was cooled immediately to the surrounding air temperature and the liquid product was collected separately from the mixture of liquid and solid catalyst via vacuum filtration. The mass balance of the liquid (mixture of H-donor, feedstock, and produced compounds) and solid (coke and char) products was determined by measuring the weights of the collected solid and liquid phases. The mass balance of gas products was estimated by difference. A GC-MS/FID (7890A Agilent Technologies) was used for quantitative and qualitative (through external standard method) analysis of the liquid products. The distribution of the gaseous products was determined by GC-TCD/FID. After the in-situ hydrogenation of raw bio-oil, the H-donor was separated from the upgraded bio-oil via vacuum distillation at 40 °C. The elemental composition (CHNS) and water content of the H-donor-free bio-oil were measured using an elemental analyzer (Flash EA 2000, Thermo Fisher) and Karl Fischer Titration (870 KF Titrino plus, Metrohm), respectively. The catalytic efficiency of 5Ni/CeO2 for the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol with the H-donors was compared with that for the hydrogenation of m-cresol with hydrogen gas, in which m-cresol (0.5 g) was mixed with distilled water (30 g), and 1 g 5Ni/CeO2 was then introduced into the reactant mixture under a nitrogen flow in a glovebox. Subsequently, the reactor was sealed, deoxygenated, pressurized (40 bar H2 in ambient temperature), and heated. After a 4 h reaction at 230 °C and 500 rpm, the products were sampled and analyzed as noted previously for the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol. Some of the experiments were repeated for two or three times to confirm the reproducibility of the data."
6,Catalyst regeneration,"2.5 Catalyst regeneration After the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol at 230 °C for 4 h, the spent 5Ni/CeO2 catalyst was washed with acetone to eliminate the organic species from the catalyst surface, and then dried at 110 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the dried sample was calcined in air at 550 °C (heating rate 3 °C/min) for 9 h to remove the carbonaceous deposits. Before the reusability test, the regenerated catalyst was reduced (at 300 °C for 3 h) using a 100 ml/min flow of 10 mol% H2/90 mol% N2."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst properties,"3.1 Catalyst properties The structural properties of the Com. CeO2, CeO2, and metal (Ni, Cu, and Co) impregnated ceria catalysts were characterized by XRD (Fig. S1). XRD results of Com. CeO2 and CeO2 revealed CeO2 to have broad peaks with low intensity compared to the Com. CeO2, showing smaller crystallites of ceria in the synthesized sample than the commercial one. Although the 3Ni/CeO2 and 5Ni/CeO2 catalysts showed no XRD peaks for nickel oxide, the 7Ni/CeO2 and 9Ni/CeO2 samples exhibited three X-ray reflections at 37.3°, 43.4°, and 63.0° 2θ, which were assigned to the NiO phase [37]. Indeed, at low Ni loadings (3 and 5 wt%), a very good dispersion of metal oxide sites on the supports resulted in no change in the XRD patterns of the CeO2. In contrast to the XRD result of 5Ni/CeO2, in which the presence of nickel oxide was not detected, the 5Cu/CeO2 and 5Co/CeO2 samples illustrated diffraction peaks at 35.5°/38.7° and 36.8° 2θ, assigning to the CuO [38] and CoO [39,40] phases, respectively. The technique of N2 adsorption on catalyst at boiling temperature (−196 °C) was used to determine the textural properties (pore volume and surface area) of the Com. CeO2, CeO2, and metal-impregnated ceria samples (Table 1 ). The pore volume and surface area of the synthesized ceria, which were remarkably higher than those of the Com. CeO2, showed a decreasing trend with metal impregnation. The lowest decrease in surface area (3.2%) and pore volume (10.6%) was obtained by the incorporation of copper in ceria. The loading of CeO2 with 3 wt% Ni resulted in a 8.2 and 22.9% decrease in surface area and pore volume, respectively. Further increases in the Ni loading to 9 wt% changed the surface area and pore volume of the catalyst only slightly. The density and strength of the acid sites of Com. CeO2, CeO2, and metal-impregnated ceria samples were determined by NH3-TPD. Generally, the ammonia desorption peak area and temperature are considered to be representative of the density and strength of acid sites, respectively [41]. The Com. CeO2 and 5Ni/Com. CeO2 did not show any ammonia desorption peak due to the lack of acidity (data are not shown here). In contrast, the synthesized ceria revealed ammonia desorption peaks at temperature regions below and above 400 °C, which were assigned to the weak and strong acid sites, respectively (Table 2 ). Although the proportion of strong to weak acid sites of the synthesized CeO2 is high, the overall acidity of this support is low/mild (up to 0.197 mmol/g). By loading Ni, Cu, and Co on the synthesized ceria, the density of acid sites was increased, indicating that new acid sites were generated by metal incorporation. The density of weak and strong acid sites of catalysts was decreased in the orders of 5Cu/CeO2 > 5Ni/CeO2 > 5Co/CeO2 and 5Cu/CeO2 > 5Co/CeO2 > 5Ni/CeO2, respectively. Increasing the Ni loading from 3 to 9 wt% led to an enhanced density of acid sites, as shown in Table 2. Fig. 1 a presents the results of H2-TPR analysis of 5Ni/Com. CeO2, 5Ni/CeO2, 5Cu/CeO2, and 5Co/CeO2 catalysts. The reduction peaks of 5Ni/Com. CeO2 were observed at 340 and 800 °C, whereas those for the 5Ni/CeO2 sample were observed at 215, 310, and 780 °C. The reduction of nickel oxide sites (NiO) loaded on the CeO2 occurred at lower temperatures compared to the Com. CeO2 possibly due to the better interaction between NiO and CeO2 than NiO and Com. CeO2. Doping the synthesized ceria with 5 wt% Cu and Co resulted in the reduction peaks at 160, and 780 °C and 260, 320, and 780 °C, respectively. Because the reduction behavior of the all CeO2-supported catalysts at high temperatures was mutually similar, it can be inferred that the peak at 780 °C belongs to the reduction of bulk ceria [35,36]. The remaining peaks at the low temperature region (<340 °C) were attributed to the reduction of metal oxides supported on ceria. According to the H2-TPR results, the reducibility of all catalysts of 5Ni/CeO2, 5Cu/CeO2, and 5Co/CeO2 was sufficient at the temperature of 300 °C, which was used for catalyst reduction before each experiment. The H2-TPR profiles of the Ni/CeO2 sample with different Ni loadings did not reveal any differences in the reduction peak temperature (Fig. 1b). The surface morphology and structural properties of Com. CeO2, CeO2, and metal-impregnated CeO2 samples were examined by TEM. Compared to the Com. CeO2, which had large particles (Fig. 2 a), the synthesized CeO2 had notably small particles (Fig. 2b). TEM images illustrated that the particles of the synthesized CeO2 were more homogenous than those of the Com. CeO2. The very low surface area of Com. CeO2 than CeO2 (refer to Table 1) is evidently supported by TEM photographs. Doping CeO2 with 5–9 wt% Ni, 5 wt% Cu, and 5 wt% Co did not alter the morphology of the synthesized ceria (Fig. S2a-e) due to the good distribution of metal sites. EDS maps showing the qualitative chemical analysis of the bulk naked ceria and ceria-supported Ni, Cu, and Co samples are presented in Figs. 2a, 3 b and S2a-e. In addition, the composition (wt.% and at.%) of each element (O, Ce, Co, Cu, and Ni) of the samples are listed in the table near the EDS maps."
9,"Transformation of m-cresol using H2 gas, 2-PrOH, and 2-BuOH as hydrogen sources","3.2 Transformation of m-cresol using H2 gas, 2-PrOH, and 2-BuOH as hydrogen sources To examine the effects of different hydrogen sources on the products of m-cresol transformation over 5Ni/CeO2, m-cresol hydrogenation was first carried out under a H2 gas atmosphere at 230 °C for 4 h using water as a solvent. With the total conversion of m-cresol, the formation of gaseous product was negligible and the yields (based on mass balance of reaction) of liquid (solvent/products) and solid (char/coke) products were 98.13 and 1.87 wt%, respectively (Table 3 ). Compared to the open chain compounds, such as 1,3-pentadiene, butanoic acid ethyl ester, and pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol, which were the dominant products with a total yield of 87.16 wt%, 3-methylcyclohexanol was the only cyclic product formed with a yield of 11.73 wt%. Next, the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol was performed in the absence of H2 gas using 2-BuOH and 2-PrOH as the hydrogen sources. The hydrogen required for m-cresol hydrogenation was produced in-situ by 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH dehydrogenation reactions. In our previous study [34], it was shown that the primary alcohols of methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol were not capable of producing hydrogen and proceeding the in-situ hydrogenation reaction due to the formation of alkoxy group through the alcohols decomposition, preventing the reaction by blocking the active sites on the catalyst surface. However, in in-situ hydrogenation using secondary alcohols like 2-PrOH, acetone (generated from the dehydrogenation reaction) easily left the catalyst surface without blocking the active sites. In the present work, in stark contrast to the H2 gas, which did not produce any cyclic O-free component, the use of the H-donors led to the formation of methylcyclohexane and 3-methylcyclohexene as O-free products, while no open chain compounds were detected in the product samples (Table 3). In addition, the variety of product compounds by the use of H2 gas was more compared to the H-donors, making it difficult to selectively control the reaction pathways towards a desirable product. 3-Methylcyclohexanol with the yields of 90.22 and 91.80 wt% was the dominant product using 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH, respectively. We proposed reaction mechanisms of m-cresol hydrogenation and performed reaction energy calculation when H2 or 2-PrOH are used as a hydrogen source over Ni/CeO2, as shown in Figs. S3 and S4. The complete description of the computational methods can be found in Supplementary Information. The adsorption energy of H2 on Ni/CeO2 (−6.2 kcal/mol) is lower than that of 2-PrOH (−44.2 kcal/mol). Also, a stable isopropoxide intermediate is formed after the transfer of hydroxyl proton from 2-PrOH to m-cresol, with relative energy of −48.9 kcal/mol. However, NiH intermediate formation is less favorable in terms of its stability (−19.4 kcal/mol) when H2 is used as a hydrogen donor. These results demonstrate that 2-PrOH is more advantageous than H2 for hydrogenation due to its higher adsorption affinity and stabilization of the isopropoxide intermediate. Compared to m-cresol hydrogenation using H2 gas, use of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH resulted in smaller amounts of solid products, which are usually formed by the polymerization of reactant/intermediates. The H-donors can prevent the polymerization of reactant/intermediates to solid products by dissolving them and facilitating their further reaction to the target products of saturated cyclic compounds. The products distribution after the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol over 5Ni/CeO2 (Table 3 and Fig. S5) reveals the following reaction pathways: hydrogenation of the benzene ring of m-cresol to 3-methylcyclohexanol, followed by dehydration and further hydrogenation reactions to 3-methylcyclohexene and methylcyclohexane, respectively. Hydrogenation of the benzene ring is proposed to be faster than its sequential dehydration reaction on 5Ni/CeO2, which is in agreement with the higher yield of 3-methylcyclohexanol compared to that of 3-methylcyclohexene and methylcyclohexane. The low dehydration activity of 5Ni/CeO2 could be due to its mild acidity. Although the total yield of O-free products (3-methylcyclohexene and methylcyclohexane) in the case of using 2-PrOH was slightly higher than that of 2-BuOH, the yield of methylcyclohexane was 1.82 times higher when 2-BuOH was served as a H-source. Table 3 lists the distribution of gaseous products achieved from the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol over 5Ni/CeO2 using H-donors; propane and butane were produced by the dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH, respectively. The products of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH dehydrogenation are discussed further in the following section. The effect of the reaction time on the performance of 5Ni/CeO2 for the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol with 2-PrOH was investigated and the results are listed in Table 4 . Total conversion of m-cresol was observed at the tested reaction times (4–6 h). By raising the reaction time from 4 to 6 h, the yield of liquid product was decreased, whereas the yields of gas and solid products were increased. 3-Methylcyclohexanol was the predominant product even after prolonging the reaction to 5 and 6 h. Although the yield of methylcyclohexane was increased from 2.40 wt% at 4 h to 4.14 wt% at 5 h, a further increase in the reaction duration to 6 h had a reverse effect on the yield of this product, suggesting that the optimal reaction time for the maximum production of methylcyclohexane was 5 h. In addition, the yield of 3-methylcyclohexene was decreased by prolonging the reaction duration from 4 to 6 h. Therefore, the metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of an unsaturated ring over 5Ni/CeO2 was faster than the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 3-methylcyclohexanol. As listed in Table 4, CO2, methane, and propane were the dominant gaseous products and increasing the time of reaction from 4 to 6 h increased the formation of methane and propane and decreased the generation of CO2. The enhanced formation of propane is due to the higher dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH at a longer reaction time."
10,Hydrogen generation from 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH over 5Ni/CeO2,"3.3 Hydrogen generation from 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH over 5Ni/CeO2 The feasibility of hydrogen production from 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH over a 5Ni/CeO2 catalyst was investigated by identifying the liquid and gaseous products obtained from the 2-PrOH/2-BuOH transformation at 230 °C for 4 h. Generally, in a proper catalytic system, the secondary alcohols of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH can undergo the following reactions: (i) dehydrogenation to the corresponding ketones (acetone/2-butanone); (ii) hydrogenolysis to the corresponding alkanes (propane/butane); and (iii) dehydration to the corresponding olefins (propene/butene) [34,42,43]. From pathway (i), acetone and 2-butanone might undergo further sequential reactions of aldol condensation and hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 3 [34,44,45]. The hydrogen species (atom/ion) produced from the reaction route (i) can be utilized further in 2-PrOH/2-BuOH hydrogenolysis (self-hydrogenation) [43]. Mechanism (iii), which is an acid-catalyzed reaction, usually proceeds over highly acidic catalysts. Acetone/methyl isobutyl ketone/2-hexanol/1-hepten-4-ol-4-methyl/2-pentanol-4-methyl and hydrogen/propane were the liquid and gaseous products of 2-PrOH transformation, respectively. In addition, 2-butanone/2-hexanone-4-methyl/2-hexanone-3,4-dimethyl/3-heptanone-6-methyl/2-hexanol/2-hexanol-5-methyl/2-heptanol/2-heptanol-6-methyl and hydrogen/butane were the liquid and gaseous products of 2-BuOH conversion, respectively. The products distribution shows that both the dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH occurred over 5Ni/CeO2. The compounds of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH dehydrogenation were transformed further through the condensation pathway mentioned above to produce branched ketones and alcohols. No dehydration of 2-PrOH/2-BuOH occurred because no propene/butene was detected in the gaseous products, which can be due to the mild acidity of the 5Ni/CeO2 catalyst. The detection of H2 molecules in the gas products (Fig. 4 ) shows that the in-situ hydrogenation reaction of m-cresol over 5Ni/CeO2 using the two H-donors of 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH might have proceeded through the mechanisms of (i) 2-PrOH/2-BuOH decomposition to H2 molecules, which are activated on nickel catalytic sites for further hydrogenation reactions and (ii) transfer of a hydrogen atom from 2-PrOH/2-BuOH to m-cresol on the nickel catalytic sites [46]. In summary, the high potential of 5Ni/CeO2 for 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH conversion through dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis mechanisms compared to the dehydration pathway makes it a suitable catalyst for in-situ hydrogenation reactions using H-donors."
11,Effects of the metal catalyst type on the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol,"3.4 Effects of the metal catalyst type on the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol Under the same reaction conditions as the 5Ni/CeO2 catalyst, m-cresol showed no reactivity over 5Ni/Com. CeO2. In addition to the oxophilic character of the synthesized CeO2, which causes a tendency for m-cresol adsorption, the high surface area, high pore volume, as well as the homogenous and small particle size of CeO2 make it a more suitable support for nickel sites compared to Com. CeO2. Owing to the proper surface properties, CeO2 favorably stabilized the dispersed Ni, enhancing 2-PrOH dehydrogenation and m-cresol hydrogenation simultaneously. In addition to 5Ni/CeO2, the 5Cu/CeO2 and 5Co/CeO2 catalysts had also the potential to catalyze the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol employing 2-PrOH as a H-donor (Table 5 ). The conversion of m-cresol was decreased in the order of 5Ni/CeO2 > 5Co/CeO2 ≫ 5Cu/CeO2. The enhanced activity of 5Ni/CeO2 and 5Co/CeO2 compared to 5Cu/CeO2 can be attributed to the higher deposition of Ni and Co in the pores of ceria (refer to the pore volume analysis results in Table 1), providing catalytic sites, even in the catalyst pores for reactant/intermediates conversion. It is noteworthy to mention that in contrast to 5Ni/CeO2, the high conversion of m-cresol over 5Co/CeO2 was accompanied by a larger amount of solid and gas production caused by the high acidity of the ceria-supported Co catalyst (refer to acid properties of catalysts in Table 2). Although hydrogenation of the benzene ring occurred over the all Ni-, Cu-, and Co-impregnated CeO2 catalysts, the O-free compounds of 3-methylcyclohexene and methylcyclohexane were obtained only over 5Ni/CeO2, indicating that the dehydration capacity of this catalyst is caused by the synergistic interactions between Ni and CeO2. As Ni was replaced with Cu and Co on the ceria framework, the decrease in gas yield and the increase in solid yield of the entire process were clear; the high tendency of 5Cu/CeO2 and 5Co/CeO2 for solid formation can be attributed to the formation of strong acid sites on the catalyst by the incorporation of Cu and Co. The almost double formation of propane over 5Co/CeO2 confirmed the higher activity of this catalyst for 2-PrOH dehydrogenation compared to 5Ni/CeO2 and 5Cu/CeO2. As discussed previously, the higher 2-PrOH hydrogenolysis leading to propane formation is indeed possible by utilizing the hydrogen species released from 2-PrOH dehydrogenation on the catalytic sites. In another point of view, the tendency of 5Co/CeO2 for 2-PrOH dehydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reduces the likelihood of m-cresol molecules from being converted on this catalyst because all the reactions related to 2-PrOH and m-cresol transformations proceed competitively on the available active sites. In summary, Co and Cu metals improved the adsorption affinity of 2-PrOH to the catalyst active sites compared to m-cresol, whereas Ni effectively caused the adsorption of both 2-PrOH and m-cresol for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation, respectively. In addition, the data revealed that the higher ratio of strong to weak acid sites of a catalyst destroy the synergy between metal sites and ceria support for the in-situ hydrogenation reaction. In comparison to 5Ni/CeO2, the 5Cu/CeO2 and 5Co/CeO2 with higher amounts of strong acid sites decreased the conversion of m-cresol and could not induce the dehydration reaction because of their high tendency for side reactions to solid formation. A very small amount of propene (0.01 wt%), which was produced from 2-PrOH dehydration, in the gaseous products of the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol over 5Cu/CeO2 and 5Co/CeO2 illustrates the low tendency of these catalysts for the dehydration reaction. The optimized cluster structures of Ni/CeO2, Co/CeO2, and Cu/CeO2 are shown in Fig. S3. To gain atomistic insights for the formation of 3-methylcyclohexanol, reaction energies of hydrogen transfer steps were compared for the three metal centers using computational methods, as shown in Fig. S4. The relative stability of the isopropoxide intermediate formed by hydrogen transfer from hydroxyl group of 2-PrOH to m-cresol, followed the order of Ni/CeO2 (−48.9 kcal/mol) < Co/CeO2 (−37.6 kcal/mol) < Cu/CeO2 (−34.5 kcal/mol). The lowest energy was shown in Ni/CeO2, which is consistent with the highest experimental yield of 3-methylcyclohexanol product (90.22% in Table 5). In addition, the isopropoxide formation is exothermic by −4.7 kcal/mol only in Ni/CeO2, whereas that in Co/CeO2 and Cu/CeO2 are endothermic. The Co/CeO2 showed second-lowest energy by 11.3 kcal/mol higher than Ni/CeO2, which reflects less product yield (36.70%) than Ni/CeO2. The Cu/CeO2 produced the lowest yield (16.85%), and this is in a good agreement with the highest energy of the isopropoxide intermediate on the Cu/CeO2."
12,Effect of the Ni loading on the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol,"3.5 Effect of the Ni loading on the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol The catalytic performance of ceria-supported nickel catalysts with various Ni loadings (3–9 wt%) was investigated during the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol. A total conversion of m-cresol was obtained at 230 °C after 4 h with Ni loadings in the range of 3 to 9 wt%. On the other hand, the experimental results listed in Table 6 show that the yield of products attained from the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol on Ni/CeO2 was dependent on the nickel loading. The yield of solid products increased gradually with increasing nickel loading due to higher acidity of the catalyst provided by the nickel phases (refer to acid properties of catalysts in Table 2). In addition, the alteration in the yields of liquid and gaseous products affected by the Ni content was as follows: from 3 to 5 wt%, the yields of liquid and gaseous products were relatively constant; from 5 to 7 wt%, a decrease in the liquid yield and an increase in the gas yield was observed; and from 7 to 9 wt%, an increase in the liquid yield and a decrease in the gas yield was obtained. Moreover, the yield of methylcyclohexane increased with increasing nickel loading from 3 to 7 wt%, whereas a further Ni content of 9 wt% led to an opposite result. The overall deoxygenation activity of Ni/CeO2 improved gradually with increasing Ni loading in the range 3–9 wt%, particularly at 7 wt%. The higher density of acid sites of the catalysts caused by the increasing Ni content could improve the dehydration of 3-methylcyclohexanol to O-free products of 3-methylcyclohexene and methylcyclohexane. Interestingly, the total yield of liquid products of m-cresol transformation over 5Ni/CeO2 and 7Ni/CeO2 was similar and higher than those of 3Ni/CeO2 and 9Ni/CeO2."
13,In-situ hydrogenation of phenolic model compounds of bio-oil,"3.6 In-situ hydrogenation of phenolic model compounds of bio-oil The 5Ni/CeO2 catalyst was used for the in-situ hydrogenation of phenol, m-cresol, anisole, and guaiacol (the common phenolic compounds of bio-oil) employing 2-PrOH as a H-donor. Under the reaction conditions mentioned in Table 7 , the conversion of anisole failed to reach 11.43 wt%, whereas m-cresol, phenol, and guaiacol achieved full conversion. Although the conversion of guaiacol was 100 wt%, it was converted mostly into gaseous and solid products. The proportion of gaseous and solid products obtained from in-situ hydrogenation of anisole was also higher than that of liquid products. Compared to m-cresol, phenol, and anisole, guaiacol resulted in a higher solid formation showing the potential of guaiacol type compounds for solid generation, which is considered the main reason for catalyst deactivation in the bio-oil hydrogenation process. Generally, the yield of liquid products of phenolics transformation was reduced in the order of m-cresol (94.73 wt%) > phenol (81.89 wt%) ≫ guaiacol (30.79 wt%) ≫ anisole (5.28 wt%), suggesting that the presence of a methoxy group in anisole and guaiacol molecules suppressed the reaction towards favorable liquid products. As evidently shown by the liquid product distribution in Table 7, methoxycyclohexane (4.45 wt%) and benzene (0.83 wt%) were the only products of the anisole transformation, highlighting the insignificant cleavage of its methoxy (–OCH3) group during the reaction. In contrast, no methoxylated-compounds were detected in the product sample of guaiacol conversion, probably due to the presence of hydroxyl (–OH) group, affecting the electron charge between –OCH3 and the aromatic ring, and facilitating its dissociation. Mechanistic analysis of the distribution of compounds in the liquid product samples collected from the in-situ hydrogenation of phenol, m-cresol, anisole, and guaiacol reveals that aromatic ring hydrogenation was the main reaction pathway. The phenolics were adsorbed dissociatively on the oxygen vacancies of ceria (coordinatively unsaturated Ce cations), forming phenoxy species [19,20,47]. The high oxygen storage capacity of ceria due to the redox cycling of Ce4+ and Ce3+ sites facilitates the adsorption of anionic oxygen in the phenolics to cationic cerium through a covalent bond. The chemisorbed phenoxy intermediate on the Ce cations results in electron withdrawal from the aromatic ring (electrophilic activation), thereby promoting hydrogenation of the aromatic ring by the hydrogen generated from 2-PrOH distortion (producing ketones/alcohols). 2-PrOH can be adsorbed competitively on the oxygen-deficient sites of ceria to produce isopropoxide, which can be dissociated further to acetone and hydrogen [21]. The impregnation of transition metals, such as Ni, on CeO2 might increase the number of oxygen-deficient sites, which enhances the redox property of ceria [19]. In addition, the reducible nature of ceria as a support can improve the activation of hydrogen on the metal dopant sites. The electron transfer to the Ni phases occurred because of the adsorption of Ni sites on the oxygen vacancies of CeO2 enhances the hydrogen activation on the nickel phases. This effective interaction between the ceria and nickel sites makes the Ni/CeO2 an appropriate catalyst for the in-situ hydrogenation reaction."
14,Catalyst reusability,"3.7 Catalyst reusability To examine the reusability of 5Ni/CeO2 in the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol, stability tests were performed in two cycles. Interestingly, the activity of 5Ni/CeO2 for m-cresol transformation was still significantly high after the first regeneration through the oxidation/reduction process (Table 8 ). Although the conversion of m-cresol decreased slightly after the second recycling of 5Ni/CeO2, the catalytic performance for m-cresol hydrodeoxygenation was reduced remarkably; no O-free compound was detected in the product sample obtained after the second regeneration. The yield of 3-methylcyclohexanol, the sole product of the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol over the twice regenerated 5Ni/CeO2, decreased for 75.55% and 73.82% relative to those obtained using the fresh and one-time regenerated catalysts, respectively. After regeneration, the initial activity of 5Ni/CeO2 for m-cresol deoxygenation was not restored, possibly due to the irreversible restructuring of the catalyst [22]. De Souza et al. [48] reported that in the hydrogenation of phenol over Pd/CeO2, the catalytic sites used once for phenoxy compounds generation could not be regenerated by oxidation/reduction process since the phenoxy intermediates remained adsorbed on the oxygen-deficient sites of the catalyst, blocking them and preventing the further adsorption of reactants. A similar performance can be considered for isopropoxide intermediate formed from 2-PrOH transformation. As shown in Table 8, compared to the fresh catalyst, the formation of solid products over the recycled catalysts increased seemingly due to deactivation/blockage of the catalytic sites, suppressing the reaction towards the formation of favorable non-solid products."
15,In-situ hydrogenation of crude bio-oil,"3.8 In-situ hydrogenation of crude bio-oil The catalytic activity of synthesized ceria-supported nickel in the in-situ hydrogenation of crude bio-oil with 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH was evaluated at 230 °C for 5 h. Table 9 lists the properties of the crude and upgraded bio-oils for comparison. The crude bio-oil before upgrading consisted of 54.74 wt% oxygen, while after upgrading, the oxygen content decreased for 38.90 and 37.54% using 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH, respectively. Furthermore, a considerable increase in the high heating value (HHV) of bio-oil from 13.21 MJ/kg to approximately 25 MJ/kg was observed using the H-donors. In our previous study [34], the in-situ hydrogenation of raw bio-oil was performed over the Pd/C catalyst and the quality of the refined bio-oil employing 2-PrOH as a H-donor was significantly lower than that using 2-BuOH. In contrast, in the present study using the Ni/CeO2 catalyst, both 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH could effectively upgrade the bio-oil. As illustrated in Table 9, the water content of the refined bio-oil was decreased significantly by in-situ hydrogenation. The yields of gaseous and solid products when using 2-BuOH as a H-donor were highly lower than those using 2-PrOH, meaning that the mass loss of the process through non-condensable gases and solid formation with 2-PrOH was higher than that with 2-BuOH. The yields of liquid, gaseous, and solid products after upgrading using 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH were 87.03, 7.63, and 5.34 wt% and 94.43, 3.03, and 2.54 wt%, respectively. Carbon oxides were the main gaseous products of the in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil with H-donors (Fig. 5 ). According to GC–MS analysis results of the crude and refined bio-oils presented in Fig. 6 , the distribution of bio-oil components changed significantly after the in-situ hydrogenation treatments. In 2-PrOH, methoxyphenols and sugars were partially converted, whereas in 2-BuOH, both the methoxyphenols and sugars were totally transformed, meaning that 2-BuOH could improve the hydrogenation of the bio-oil components significantly compared to 2-PrOH. Although the in-situ hydrogenation of bio-oil in the presence of 2-PrOH resulted mainly in esters as refined products, the main composition of bio-oil after upgrading using 2-BuOH was alcohols, indicating the high potential of 2-BuOH for bio-oil hydrogenation into alcohols, which are a chemically valuable compounds. Mechanistically, the esters produced from esterification between the bio-oil acids and alcoholic H-donors can be hydrogenated further to their analogous alcohols under suitable reaction conditions, as was observed in the present study in the presence of 2-BuOH. Indeed, the reduction in acid content of bio-oil through esterification and hydrogenation reactions favorably decreases its corrosiveness and improves its stability."
16,Conclusions,"The in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol, a representative compound of bio-oil, with the secondary alcohols of 2-BuOH and 2-PrOH was carried out successfully using a synthesized ceria-supported nickel catalyst. The synthesized mesoporous ceria was an effective support for the Ni catalyst, leading to the enhanced in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol with H-donors under a H2-free atmosphere. In contrast to the results obtained using H2 gas, which did not produce any cyclic O-free product, the use of H-donors led to the formation of methylcyclohexane and 3-methylcyclohexene as the deoxygenated products. In addition to the oxophilic character of CeO2, causing a tendency for m-cresol adsorption, the high surface area, high pore volume, and homogenous-small particle size make the synthesized ceria suitable support for nickel sites. In addition to Ni, the catalytic activity of Cu and Co for the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol was investigated. The results showed that although hydrogenation of the benzene ring happened over the all Ni-, Cu-, and Co-impregnated CeO2 catalysts, O-free compounds were only obtained over Ni/CeO2. The Ni/CeO2 catalyst was also effective in the in-situ hydrogenation of phenol and guaiacol, but it was relatively inactive for anisole conversion, indicating that the sole methoxy group of anisole molecule could suppress the interaction between anisole and the catalytic active sites, preventing the reaction towards favorable hydrogenated products. The reusability of Ni/CeO2 catalyst was examined during the in-situ hydrogenation of m-cresol with 2-PrOH, showing that catalyst regeneration by successive oxidation and reduction did not restore the spent catalytic sites. This was attributed to the irreversible restructuring of the catalyst. Moreover, in-situ hydrogenation of crude bio-oil with 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH was performed over a Ni/CeO2 catalyst, resulting in an upgraded bio-oil with a 37.5–38.9% lower oxygen content and a HHV value of up to 25 MJ/kg."
