0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels as it is pollution free, has high energy content and can be produced from renewable sources [1]. However, the main drawback of hydrogen as transportation fuel is lack of proper storage method, which is yet to achieve the required specifications set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) for on-board application [2]. Hence development of cost effective and feasible hydrogen storage materials satisfying the on-board application specifications is a major challenge [1–3]. The conventional hydrogen storage methods such as compressed gas storage and cryogenic storage have significant safety hazards for on-board applications due to its high pressure and low temperature operations [4]. Efforts are onto develop new hydrogen storage systems, including metal, chemical or complex hydrides and nanoporous materials to meet the target storage specifications for onboard applications. Hydrogen storage using carbon based materials such as activated carbons (AC), graphite, carbon nanofibers (CNF) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been subjected to intensive research [5–17]. Easy availability, fast adsorption desorption kinetics and low weight are advantages of the carbon based materials. The reported results show the hydrogen storage capacity on carbon nanomaterials is scattered over several orders of magnitude in between 0.2 and 10wt.% depending on the storage parameters [18,19]. Activated carbon, with high surface area and large pore volume, is one of the most promising materials for hydrogen storage application. But wide pore size distribution of activated carbon is the major disadvantage for its interaction with hydrogen molecules [11]. To increase the hydrogen uptake capacity on these materials under moderate conditions, the interaction between the hydrogen and carbon surface must be improved or modified. Recently templated synthesis method has attracted considerable attention for preparation of novel porous carbon with high surface area and controlled pore structure for hydrogen storage application. Carbonization is a simple method for production of templated carbon. In this method appropriate carbon precursor is deposited on an ordered inorganic porous template followed by carbonization at elevated temperature. The removal of the template is expected to result in formation of microporous carbon having pore size comparable to the wall thickness of the template framework. However the final structure is affected by shrinkage during carbonization process. The structure of templated carbons can be controlled via the selection of template and carbon precursors as well as the carbonization conditions [20,21]. Various studies have been reported for ordered porous carbon materials prepared from different carbon precursors such as acrylonitrile, furfuryl alcohol, pyrene, vinyl acetate etc. using different silica gel and zeolite based templates in few recent studies for H2 storage application [22–33] Webley and co-workers [25] synthesized templated microporous carbon using different cation exchanged (Ca, K, H and Na) form of Y zeolite as the templates and propylene and butylene as carbon sources using a single step vapor phase deposition process. They reported H2 adsorption capacity of 2wt.% at −196°C and 1atm. Armandi et al. [26] reported a linear dependency between hydrogen adsorption capacity and microporosity of prepared carbons. They reported highest hydrogen uptake of 2.0wt.% at −196°C and 1atm for carbon synthesized using SBA-15 silica template and sucrose. At high pressure of 20bars and −196°C temperature, hydrogen uptake up to 6.9wt.% has been reported for templated carbon by Yang et al. [27]. Kyotani and co-workers [31] and Youn et al. [33] reported that a two step process consisting of filling of zeolite pores by furfuryl alcohol followed by chemical vapor deposition of hydrocarbons such as propylene or butylene resulted in highly ordered pore structure with surface area more than 3000m2/g. The objective of this study is to explore the effects of synthesis parameters on development of porous structure in templated carbon for hydrogen storage application. To best of our knowledge no studies have been reported on the detailed effects of synthesis parameters on development of porous structure of templated carbon by carbonization method. The nanoporous carbons were synthesized using ammonium form of Y zeolite as the template and furfuryl alcohol as the carbon precursor. The effects of synthesis parameters, such as carbonization temperature, dwelling time of carbonization, heating ramp profile and flow rate of N2, on the structural development of the carbon materials were investigated in details. This is essential to understand how the synthesis parameters regulate the pore structure development and to determine the optimum synthesis conditions for development of higher surface area carbon with desired pore sizes. The properties of the prepared templated carbons were studied by TGA, surface area and pore analysis, XRD, SEM and FESEM and were tested for hydrogen storage ability at atmospheric pressure at different temperatures."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Preparation of materials,"2.1 Preparation of materials The templated carbons were synthesized by carbonization method using NH4Y zeolite template and furfuryl alcohol as the carbon precursor. All the chemicals, NH4Y zeolite (Aldrich), furfuryl alcohol (Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd.), toluene (Merck) and HF (Merck) were used in as received condition without any further treatment. The schematic of preparation procedure of templated carbon from zeolite and furfuryl alcohol is shown in Fig. 1 . The furfuryl alcohol was added to dried NH4Y zeolite (pretreated at 200°C for 4h) and stirred at room temperature for 72h. After the NH4Y zeolite was filled with furfuryl alcohol, the sample was filtered and washed with toluene to remove excess FA on particle surfaces. The sample was dried at room temperature for 12h and is referred as NH4Y–FA in text. Carbonization of NH4Y–FA was done in a stainless steel down flow fixed bed reactor under N2 flow (100ml/min). The carbonization of the dried samples was carried out at different temperatures (650,750 and 850°C) and dwelling time (1, 2, 3 and 4h). Two different heating profiles were maintained. In first continuous method, heating was done at constant rate of 10°C/min up to desired carbonization temperature. In the second stepwise method temperature was increased at same rate of 10°C/min with 30min dwelling time for each 100°C interval. The templated carbons were synthesized at different N2 flow (100 and 50ml/min) to see any effect of inert gas flow rate on development of porous structure. After carbonization, the zeolite–carbon composite were cooled down to room temperature under same N2 environment. The zeolite–carbon composite after carbonization was collected and treated in excess amount of 48% aqueous HF solution at room temperature for 24h for removal of zeolite. The black templated carbon was filtered and washed with deionised water for several times for complete removal of HF/zeolite from the sample. The sample was dried at 150°C for overnight. The removal of zeolite was confirmed by EDX and XRD analysis. In the text the zeolite–carbon composite are represented as ZCT-t and final templated carbon samples are referred as CT-t, where ‘T’ is the carbonization temperature and ‘t’ is the dwelling time in hour."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization The BET surface area and pore size analysis of the zeolite and templated carbons were determined by N2 adsorption desorption isotherm at −196°C by using a surface area analyzer (Beckman-Coulter; Model: SA3100). Prior to measurement, the samples were degassed at 200°C in vacuum for 60min. The thermo gravimetric analysis of the powder sample was carried out by Mettler Toledo (TGA/SDTA851e) thermal analyzer. The TGA was carried out in nitrogen flow with heating rate of 10°C/min in ceramic crucible up to 800°C. Powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded by a Bucker X-ray D8 advance diffractrometer with a Cu-Kα radiation (λ =0.154nm) at 45kV and 40mA respectively with scan rate of 0.5s/step with increment 0.05. The X-ray diffractograms were collected in the range of 10–80°. Phase analyses of the diffraction profiles were done using ICDD–JCPDS database. The scanning electron microscopy analysis of samples was done using ZEOL JSM 6390LV and field emission scanning electron microscopic analysis was done using instrument of ZEISS make and model 1430VP. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) technique was used to determine the presence of residue zeolite in the synthesized materials. Before mounting on a sample holder for SEM analysis the samples were deposited on a carbon tape then coated with gold in order to make the sample conducting for microstructures analyses. For FESEM analysis the samples were dispersed in a solvent and deposited in an aluminum foil which was mounted on a sample holder for gold coat."
4,Hydrogen uptake measurements,"2.3 Hydrogen uptake measurements The hydrogen uptake at atmospheric pressure and different temperatures was measured using the temperature programmed desorption method (H2–TPD) (Model: Chemisorb 2720, Make: Micromeritics). In this method hydrogen was allowed to adsorb on high surface area templated carbon samples at atmospheric pressure at −100°C and −50°C. The pre-adsorbed hydrogen was examined by the TPD method in an inert gas environment. For hydrogen uptake measurement the sample was initially outgassed with an inert gas at 150°C for 30min. Then the sample was cooled to adsorption temperature and the H2/Ar gas mixture was passed through the sample until complete saturation occurred. After flushing the sample with Argon at same adsorption temperature the sample was subjected to increased temperature in Argon. The desorbed hydrogen was recorded as function of temperature and time. The total area under the peak corresponds to the hydrogen uptake of the sample at analysis temperature. The TPD spectrum of the C650_3h sample is given in Supplementary information. For accuracy of the TPD experiment the system was initially calibrated. The calibration was done by using Argon as the carrier gas and same flow rate was maintained both for calibration and analysis. For calibration, known amount of H2/Ar mixture gas was injected into Argon carrier gas and corresponding peak area was recorded. The injection was repeated for different known volume of H2/Ar mixture gas and peak area was plotted as function of hydrogen volume giving the calibration graph. Each data point was repeated for 3–4 times to minimize the errors. Using calibration graph amount of hydrogen desorbed was calculated."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of zeolite and zeolite–carbon composites,"3.1 Characterization of zeolite and zeolite–carbon composites The as-received zeolite and zeolite–carbon composites at different stages of carbonization were characterized by different techniques for better understanding of the templated carbonization process. The TGA profiles of NH4Y-zeolite and NH4Y–FA and corresponding dm dT curves are shown in Fig. 2 . A weight loss of ∼10% was observed for both the samples at 100°C, which can be attributed to the evaporation of trapped water present in the samples. At higher temperature another weight loss of ∼20% can be attributed to the decomposition of ammonium ions of NH4Y zeolite. This corresponds to the peaks at 240°C for NH4Y–FA and at 260°C for NH4Y zeolite as observed from the respective dm dT curves. Finally, at temperature of 675°C, about 3–5% weight loss was observed for both the samples which can be attributed to loss of constitutive (chemical) water due to dehydration of zeolite structure [16]. No more weight loss was observed up to 800°C. The peak intensities of NH4Y–FA was less than that of NH4Y zeolite may be due to the fact that before treating with furfural alcohol, the zeolite was pretreated at 200°C for 4h. Hence apart from the minor weight loss of ∼3–5% at 675°C, the NH4Y-zeolite was thermally stable up to 800°C without any major structural collapse and can be used as a potential template. The effect of temperature on the structure of zeolite template was studied by calcining the zeolite at different temperature (650, 750 and 800°C) for 4h. The XRD profiles of the samples are shown in Fig. 3 (a). The XRD pattern of NH4Y-zeolite (NH4Y) was characterized by several sharp peaks due to well ordered crystalline framework, with a strong peak at 2θ =6.31°, corresponding to [111] planes [16,21]. It was observed that with increasing calcination temperature the intensity of the peaks reduced indicating structural changes in NH4Y-zeolite with temperature. The effect was maximum at 850°C with no distinct XRD peaks visible. The XRD profiles of zeolites at each stage of carbonization process are shown in Fig. 3(b). For NH4Y-zeolite, pretreated at 200°C for 4h, the peak intensities were reduced slightly. However addition of furfuryl alcohol did not have much effect on the zeolite structure. A prominent reduction in peak intensities was observed in the XRD pattern of zeolite/carbon composite carbonized at 650°C with 4h dwelling time. It suggested that during the carbonization process, the framework of zeolite template was affected undergoing partial collapse. However, reduced peak intensities may be also due to the coverage of zeolite crystals by carbon layer. This is because when only pure zeolite was heated at 650°C for 4h, structure of zeolite was much less affected as can be seen from Fig. 3(a). Fig. 4 (a) and (b) shows the SEM images of as received NH4Y-zeolite and NH4Y–FA respectively. It was observed that as received NH4Y-zeolite and NH4Y–FA possess the same uniformity in morphology of particles indicating that NH4Y-zeolite structure remained unchanged by deposition of furfuryl alcohol as also observed in XRD analysis. However; the particle size seems to be larger which may be due to higher agglomeration in presence of FA. Fig. 4(c) shows the SEM image of zeolite–carbon composite after carbonization at 650°C with 4h dwelling time. This sample also possessed the same uniformity in microstructure of particles."
7,Effect of carbonization temperature and dwelling time,"3.2 Effect of carbonization temperature and dwelling time The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the templated carbons synthesized at different carbonization temperatures and dwelling time are shown in Fig. 5 (a)–(c). The nature of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms was same for templated carbons synthesized at different carbonization temperatures and dwelling times. All the isotherms were of type II according to the IUPAC classification [34]. The hysteresis loops of H4 type was observed for all the isotherms indicating the presence of narrow slit-shaped pores [34]. The volume of nitrogen adsorption/desorption increased with increase in dwelling time up to 3h thereafter decreased at all carbonization temperature. Nitrogen adsorption also decreased with increase in carbonization temperature. Fig. 6 depicts the BET surface area and micropore area of templated carbon samples as a function of carbonization temperature at different dwelling time. It was observed that at all carbonization temperature, with increasing dwelling time the BET and micropore area increased up to 3h dwelling time and then decreased at higher dwelling time of 4h. The highest BET surface area of 1000m2/g was achieved for templated carbon synthesized at 750°C for 3h dwelling time. For 2h dwelling time there was not much effect on micropore surface areas as temperature increased from 650 to 750°C. For 3h dwelling time, slight decrease in micropore area was observed with increase in temperature. A micropore surface area of 519m2/g was observed at 650°C which decreased to 500m2/g at 750°C for 3h dwelling time. For 4h dwelling time micropore area decreased significantly with increase in temperature. Hence for maximum micropore area 3h dwelling time and carbonization temperature of 650–750°C was observed to be optimum. The pore size distributions of templated carbon samples calculated using the BJH method are shown in Fig. 7 (a)–(c). The line figures for pore size distribution are included in Supplementary informations. The volume percentage of pores having pore diameter less than 6nm was maximum for templated carbon synthesized at 650°C with 3h dwelling time. The generation of pores having pore diameter less than 6nm was quite good for templated carbon samples synthesized at 750°C with 2 and 3h dwelling time. All the samples consisted of pores mainly in the range of less than 6nm and 20–80nm. At all dwelling times larger pores (20–80nm) decreased and pores less than 6nm increased as temperature increased from 650 to 750°C. However at higher temperature of 850°C larger pores again increased and less than 6nm pores decreased. The effect was more severe at higher dwelling time of 4h. This observation can be attributed to the partial collapse of template structure at higher temperature and dwelling time thereby increasing larger pores. Pores in the mesoporous range of 6–20nm were not affected by temperature or dwelling time and similar in all samples. Hence in terms of maximizing pores of lower size carbonization temperature of 650°C is desirable. The total pore volume and micropore volumes of the templated carbon samples as shown in Table 1 increased up to 3h dwelling time and then decreased at higher dwelling time of 4h at all carbonization temperature. The effects of carbonization temperature on total pore volume and micro pore volume was observed to depend on dwelling time. For lower dwelling time of 1h total pore volume increased with temperature and micropore volume showed a maxima at 750°C. However at higher dwelling time total and micropore volume decreased with temperature. At 3h dwelling time a maxima was observed at 750°C for total pore volume. From these observations it can be concluded that at all carbonization temperature, at least 3h dwelling time is needed for pore formation. At lower dwelling time pore formation is incomplete and at higher dwelling time sintering results in collapse of pore structure decreasing total and micropore volume. Though, the effect was more severe for micropores. Similarly at low carbonization temperature, higher dwelling time was needed for pore formation. However, for higher dwelling time (4h), higher temperature of 850°C promotes severe sintering and hence large decreases in micropore volume. The XRD patterns of templated carbon samples prepared at various temperature with 4h dwelling time exhibited a broad XRD peak at around 2θ =25.4 which corresponds to the (002) diffraction of graphitic carbon. The XRD profile is included in Supplementary informations. The intensity of the graphitic carbon peaks was slightly higher at 750°C carbonization temperature. Absence of any peak due to zeolite suggests complete removal of zeolite template during HF treatment. This was also confirmed by EDX analysis (not shown here). The FESEM images of templated carbons synthesized at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 8 (a)–(c). A flowery kind of structure was observed for all samples. Fine pores can be observed on the surface of carbons."
8,Effect of heating profiles,"3.3 Effect of heating profiles To study the effect of heating profiles, samples were subjected to two conditions (1) continuously heating at rate of 10°C/min and (2) step wise heating in which temperature was increased at a rate of 10°C/min with 30min dwelling time at each 100°C interval up to the predefined carbonization temperature. Fig. 9 (a) shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of templated carbons synthesized at 750°C with 3h dwelling time with and without stepwise rise in temperature. The nature of the isotherms was same for both samples and of type II as discussed earlier. The H4 type hysteresis loop corresponding to narrow slit-shaped pores was observed. For stepwise heated samples nitrogen adsorption was higher. Fig. 10 (a) depicts the corresponding BET surface area and micropore surface area. The maximum BET surface area of 1886m2/g and micropore area of 1136m2/g observed for templated carbon obtained with stepwise heating ramp. In stepwise heating, the initiation of carbonization process is expected to be slower than continuous heating process and seemed to have favored formation of pore structure that resulted in higher surface area and micropore area. However as the final temperature approached, higher residence time in higher temperature may also have resulted in some additional sintering compared to continuous heating. This can be observed from the pore size distributions in Fig. 11 (a) showing that stepwise heating increased pores in 20–80nm range. The XRD patterns of templated carbon samples synthesized with and without stepwise heating ramp exhibited a broad XRD peak at around 2θ =25.4 corresponding to the (002) diffractions of graphitic carbon (Fig. not shown). The intensity of the graphitic carbon peak significantly increased with stepwise heating profile implying that greater proportion of graphitic carbon was formed."
9,Effect of N2 flow rate,"3.4 Effect of N2 flow rate The effect of N2 flow rate on properties of templated carbon was studied at N2 flow rate of 100ml/min and 50ml/min at carbonization temperature of 750°C with 3h dwelling. Fig. 9(b) shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of templated carbons synthesized under two mentioned flow rates of N2. The nature of the isotherms was type II with H4 type hysteresis loops as discussed earlier. Low nitrogen adsorption was observed at lower N2 flow rate. Fig. 10(b) depicts the BET surface area and corresponding micropore surface area. The BET surface area of 1000m2/g decreased to 632m2/g whereas the micropore surface area of 500m2/g decreased to 306m2/g when nitrogen flow decreased from 100 to 50ml/min. The results may be explained as follows. The flow of inert gas helps to remove the product gases of the carbonization and also avoid development of any hotspots. At low flow of nitrogen, slower removal of product gases may have affected the forward reactions thereby resulting in incomplete pore structure formation giving lower surface area and pore volume. Increased probability of formation of hotspots at lower flow rate may have also resulted in higher sintering and formation of large pores as can be seen in the pore size distribution in Fig. 11(b). At lower flow rates pores in 20–80nm range increased. For both the carbon samples synthesized at different N2 flow a broad peak at 2θ =25.4 was observed (figures are not shown) as earlier. The peak intensity significantly increased for templated carbon sample synthesized with 50ml/min N2 flow."
10,H2 sorption experiments,"3.5 H2 sorption experiments The templated carbon samples synthesized at 650, 750, and 850°C carbonization temperatures at 3h dwelling time having higher BET surface area and micropore area were studied for hydrogen storage measurement. Fig. 12 depicts the hydrogen uptake of the samples measured at −100°C and −50°C and atmospheric pressure. Highest hydrogen uptake was observed for C650_3h sample with 0.15wt.% storage at −100°C and atmospheric pressure. The C650_3h sample having higher hydrogen uptake showed lower BET surface area compared to C750_3h sample but higher amount of micropores and mesopores less than 6nm. This agrees with the general observation that in narrower pores the interaction between pore walls and hydrogen molecule is higher and thereby adsorption is favored. No hydrogen adsorption was observed at room temperature. The hydrogen uptake at −100°C and atmospheric pressure of samples heated in two different profiles is compared in Fig. 13 and shows that the uptake capacity increased to 0.29wt.% for stepwise heated samples. The increased hydrogen uptake for stepwise heated sample may be attributed to significant enhancement in micropores (Fig. 10a). The study shows that lower carbonization temperature with 3h dwelling time and stepwise heating profile result in higher surface and micropore area for templated carbon. The presence of large mesopores and macropores of the templated carbon samples may be due to the shrinkage of zeolite–carbon during carbonization processes and/or due to the incomplete filling of zeolite channels and cavities by furfuryl alcohol. The degree of the shrinkage and collapse of zeolite framework was observed to be dependent on the carbonization temperature and dwelling time of carbonization. Higher carbonization temperature and dwelling time resulted in greater the shrinkage and collapse of zeolite framework. Lower flow of nitrogen also enhanced formation of larger pores."
11,Conclusions,"The nanoporous templated carbons with high surface areas and large pore volumes were prepared via carbonization process using NH4Y-zeolite as template and furfuryl alcohol as the carbon precursor. Depending on the synthesis parameters, templated carbons with wide range of BET surface areas (163–1886m2/g), micropore areas (26–1136m2/g), total pore volumes (0.303–1.314ml/g) and micropore volumes (0.0106–0.513ml/g) were obtained. The BET surface area and pore volume of the templated carbons were found to be highest at carbonization temperature of 750°C with 3h dwelling time for continuous heating profile. The surface area and the pore volume of the templated carbon decreased at higher carbonization temperature and dwelling time due to collapses of pore structure. The XRD patterns of the zeolite template at different stages of carbonization shows that shrinkage and collapse of structure of zeolite at higher temperature may also contribute to low microporosity and disordered porous structure of templated carbon synthesized at higher temperature. Lower nitrogen flow rate resulted in lower surface area and pore volume. The XRD patterns of the all carbon samples exhibited a broad XRD peak at around 2θ =25.4 which corresponded to the (002) diffractions of graphitic carbon. The maximum storage at temperature of −100°C and atmospheric pressure was found to be 0.15wt.% for templated carbon synthesized at 650°C with 3h dwelling time. The hydrogen uptake increased to 0.29wt.% at the same condition for the templated carbon synthesized at 750°C with 3h dwelling time with stepwise heating ramp having BET surface area 1886m2/g and micropore surface area 1136m2/g. The storage capacity was observed to be higher for samples having higher amount of micropores and mesopores less than 6nm."
