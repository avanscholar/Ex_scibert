0,Introduction,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) is produced commercially primarily by water electrolysis [1], methanol or ammonia decomposition [2], and natural-gas steam reformation [3]. However, the cost of production in terms of actual environmental impacts can be quite high. Photocatalytic (PC), electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) production of H2 has been the focus of much research over the past 30 years [4–6]. The major challenge remains the search for low-cost, earth-abundant semiconducting materials that are stable under a broad range of pH conditions (e.g., 1 M H2SO4 to 1 M NaOH) and are photo-active through-out the prime regions of the incident solar spectrum. In 1921, Baur and Rebmann [7] reported that semiconductor composites of thalium chloride (Eg = 3.8 eV) and AgCl (Eg = 3.3 eV) could be used for the stoichiometric splitting of water upon absorption of wavelengths of UV light < 370 nm. Baur and Rebmann showed that an illuminated mixture of TlCl/AgCl semiconductors suspended in water could achieve stoichiometric photochemical water splitting in a 2:1 mol ratio of H2 to O2. Fifty years later, Fujishima and Honda [8] used a single-crystal of rutile (TiO2) photoanode (Eg = 3.0 eV) coupled with a platinum black cathode to demonstrate PEC water splitting at pH 4.7 in an acetic acid/acetate buffer system mixed into a 0.5 M KCl/KI background electrolyte. The anodic and cathodic chambers were separated by sintered glass diagram or glass frit. During the intervening 46 years much research has been undertaken to advance our understanding of both pure homogeneous and heterogeneous water splitting (i.e., no sacrificial electron donors) and facilitated water splitting involving the oxidation of sacrificial chemical reagents. However, we are still collectively looking for a practical solution without the use of platinum group metals for PC or PEC water splitting to produce a viable non-nuclear energy source for the long-term future (e.g., according to the Web of Science more than 3000 scientific papers have been published based on the use of three key words: solar, semiconductor, and H2). These limited sub-set of papers have accumulated more than 142,000 total citations since 1976. Key challenges that must still be overcome include: 1) utilization of earth-abundant but low-cost semiconductor photocatalysts, 2) increase solar light capture efficiency over the wavelength range of 500–800 nm, 3) reduce direct and indirect electron-hole recombination, 4) enhance interfacial electron transfer efficiency, and 5) increase overall quantum efficiencies of H2 and O2 production. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), because of its catalytic activity, high stability, and low cost, is often used as a photocatalyst or in PEC cells. However, the band gap of TiO2 is 3.2 eV, which limits light absorption to the ultraviolet and limits its overall photocatalytic efficiency in terms of the solar spectrum [9]. After more than 40 years of systematic investigation of the catalytic properties of TiO2, a variety of experimental methods have been developed in order to synthesize an array of different morphologies of TiO2 such as nanotubes, nanorods, nanoplates, and nanoflowers in order to increase photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activity [10–12]. However, the various synthetic modifications have not done much to extend visible light absorption of TiO2 above 450 nm. Thus, additional modifications methods have utilized metal doping, nonmetal doping, multiple dopants in an attempt to push light absorption and catalytic activity higher into the visible portion of the spectrum [13–15]. Recently, there are considerable efforts are devoted to enhance device performance in PEC generation of H2 by the incorporation of carbonaceous materials, such as multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene oxide and so on. Navarro-Pardo et al. [16] prepared graphene oxide/cobalt-based nanohybrid, which possessed stable PEC performance for H2 generation. Selopal et al. [17] combined MWCNTs with TiO2 and incorporated with CdSe/(CdSexS1-x)5/(CdS)2 colloidal quantum dots (QDs) for solar energy conversion to H2 technology. Tong et al. [18] synthesized ZnS–CISeS QDs-based TiO2 photoanode with high stable, used for device in H2 production. Among the above researches, substance including TiO2 and carbonaceous materials showed superior H2 generation. The metal or nonmetal materials doping can extend light absorption into the visible light and near-infrared region of the spectrum, but trapping states and carrier recombination after doping often limit photocatalytic activity. One of the options is to utilize the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metal combined with TiO2 to extend light absorption range, in which Au, Pt, Ag all has the plamonic effect for collective oscillation of surface electrons transferred to TiO2 under visible light [19–21]. Combinations of wide and narrow band gap heterojunction semiconductor composites have been used to enhance charge transfer and to reduce the electron-hole recombination coupled with improved light absorption in visible region. Cadmium sulfide (CdS), an n-type semiconductor, with a band gap of 2.4 eV has been used in various forms and composites as a H2 evolution catalyst. CdS can be combined with TiO2 to form a heterojunction that has been often used as a photocatalyst for solar H2 production [22]. Although combining CdS with TiO2 has been shown to retard photocorrosion and to improve the overall lifetime of the composite catalyst. In addition, the composite catalysts have been shown to visible light photocatalytic activity and enhance PEC performance of TiO2 nanotube electrodes [23–25]. Although the ternary heterostructures composed of CdS, mental and TiO2 semiconductor were investigated for PEC activity, the utilization of them as photoanode for H2 production with pollutant as holes sacrificial agent remains poorly explored. In this study, TiO2 nanorods (TiO2-NRs) are combined with Ag nanoparticles and CdS to form CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs photo-electrodes. The characteristics and electrochemical properties of composite photo-electrodes were analyzed and their PEC activity with respect to H2 evolution with visible light irradiation was studied. The effects of nanorods length and role of nitrobenzene (NB) as a sacrificial reagent for H2 production were also investigated."
1,Experimental methods,
2,Preparation of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs,"2.1 Preparation of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs TiO2-NRs were prepared by hydrothermal method [11]. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode substrates with dimensions of 2 cm × 5 cm were cleaned first by ultrasonic irradiation in acetone, ethyl alcohol, and deionized water each for 15 min and then dried in the air. 50 mL of 50% HCl solution was mixed in 10 min, and then 0.6 mL tetrabutyl titanate was added with stirring for 5 min. The pretreated FTO was placed in an autoclave along with 25 mL of the prepared solution and calcined at 170 °C for 4 h to form the TiO2-NRs. CdS/TiO2-NRs were prepared by deposition of CdS on the surface of TiO2-NRs in suspension. The solution suspension was composed adding 1.0 M aqueous ammonia in to 40 mL of distilled water along with 1.0 mM cadmium sulfate, 5 mM sulfocarbamide, and TiO2-NRs. This suspension was heated at 60 °C for 10 min. The filtered suspension of CdS on TiO2-NRs was calcined at 400 °C in N2 for 2 h to produce the final product CdS/TiO2-NRs. Ag/TiO2-NRs was prepared by UV reduction of 40 g L−1 AgNO3 in the presence of TiO2-NRs. The mixed suspension was stirred in dark for 1 h and then illuminated for 0.5 h using a 500 W Xenon photolysis lamp in order to produce Ag nanoparticles loaded on to TiO2-NRs. The hybrid CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR catalyst was prepared by deposition of CdS on to the surface of Ag/TiO2-NRs in an aqueous suspension. After deposition of CdS, the mixture was calcined at 400 °C under N2 for 2 h resulting in the formation of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs. The experimental procedure is depicted in Scheme 1 ."
3,Characterization of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrode,"2.2 Characterization of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrode The crystalline phase was determined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), while the crystal lattice and fringe phases were determined by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The modified electrode surface was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology structure of the modified electrode surface was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and EDS map. The surface spectral properties of photocatalytic electrode material were analyzed by UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV–Vis)."
4,Photoelectrochemical properties (PEC),"2.3 Photoelectrochemical properties (PEC) All of the PEC tests were carried out in a three-electrode configuration where the prepared electrode was working electrode, Pt was counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was reference electrode. Under the illumination, Xenon lamp produced visible light at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Photocurrent density (J-V) of the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode was determined by linear sweep voltammetry of a 0.1 M electrolyte containing Na2S and Na2SO3 in solution (pH 13.03) in the absence of NB with a sweep range from −1.0 V to 0.6 V. The current density is reproducible and stable, within an acceptable range error of 5%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Mott-Schottky (M − S) curves, light conversion efficiencies, and monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were determined using the same electrolyte at a bias voltage of 0.4 V and EIS frequency of 10−2-106. M − S curves were obtained by the impedance-potential technique at a voltage range of −1.0 V–0.4 V and scan frequencies of 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz under dark conditions."
5,H2 production and oxidation of nitrobenzene (NB),"2.4 H2 production and oxidation of nitrobenzene (NB) The formation of H2 and degradation of NB were tested to analyze the PEC activity of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs. NB was selected as the electron donor (i.e., a sacrificial reagent) to promote the separation of electron-hole pairs, so that photo-induced electron could be transferred to the cathode to H2. The CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode was used as the anode with an effective geometric electrode surface area of 4 cm2. And foam nickel was pure and no electrocatalyst was deposited on it, which was used as cathode with the electrode distance of 2 cm. All of the PEC tests were carried under visible light irradiation at λ > 420 nm and bias voltage of 0.5 V. The PEC tests were carried out using online detection of H2 production under a slight vacuum. H2 was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with N2 as the carrier gas at a gas pressure of 0.1 MPa and detector temperature of 110 °C. The electrolyte solution consisted of 30 mg L−1 of NB in 0.5 M Na2S and Na2SO3 solution (pH 13.64). The concentration of NB was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Diamonsil C18 reverse column and detection wavelength of 262 nm. The ratio of mobile phase of methanol: deionized water: glacial acetic acid is 49: 50: 1 with the flow rate of 1 mL min−1."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Electrode materials characterization,"3.1 Electrode materials characterization 3.1.1 Elements analyses Figure S1 shows the XRD patterns of TiO2-NRs, Ag/TiO2-NRs, CdS/TiO2-NRs and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes. It can be seen that an adsorption peak at 2θ = 26.5° corresponding as CdS (002) [26,27] is present on CdS/TiO2-NRs and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes. Ag presents at 2θ = 44.7° as the crystal face (200) of Ag on Ag/TiO2-NRs and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes indicating that metallic Ag was stable on composite electrodes whether CdS was loaded or not. Since the (200) Ag was low, XPS analysis was carried out for intensive study. The XPS spectra of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs with Ag, Cd and S elements are shown in Fig. 1 . The CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrode contains Ti, O, Ag, Cd and S with the main peak of C at 284.8 eV corresponding to calibration peak of C1s. The binding energy peaks of Ag is 373.88 eV and 367.87 eV correspond to Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2, respectively. This is consistent with metallic silver on the surface [28,29]. The binding energy peaks of Cd and S at 412.29 eV, 405.53 eV, 163.04 eV and 161.82 eV correspond to Cd 3d3/2, Cd 3d5/2, and S 2p, respectively [30–33]. These results confirm that CdS and Ag are loaded on the surface of the TiO2-NRs. 3.1.2 Microstructures Fig. 2 shows the SEM imagines of TiO2-NRs, Ag/TiO2-NRs, CdS/TiO2-NRs, and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs. As shown in longitudinal section imagines of the electrodes in Fig. 2, TiO2 deposited first on the base of FTO. After the growing the thickness of the TiO2 film to greater than 450 nm, the TiO2-NRs started to grow vertically and the length of TiO2-NRs was about 1.2 μm with diameters close to 100 nm. Fig. 2a and b depict the growth of TiO2-NRs uniformly on FTO. Fig. 2c and d shows the Ag particles uniformly uploaded on the surface and interval of TiO2-NRs. The pattern of CdS/TiO2-NRs was similar with that of TiO2-NRs as shown in Fig. 2e and f. This indicates that CdS was synthesized as film covering the surface of the TiO2-NRs. There is a co-loading of CdS and Ag on the surface of TiO2-NRs (Fig. 2g and h). In these cases, the Ag nanoparticles were observed and the CdS film covered both Ag and TiO2-NRs. In addition, EDS mapping of section SEM image for CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs also confirmed the evenly distribution of Ag and CdS inside the TiO2-NRs (Fig. S2). In addition, the effect of the reaction time for TiO2-NRs growth was investigated as the growth length of TiO2-NRs was higher with longer reaction times. Fig. S3 shows the SEM images of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs at different growth times of the TiO2-NRs. All of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes were loaded with Ag nanoparticles as shown both on top and on the vertical profile of the TiO2-NRs. At a growth time for the TiO2-NRs of 3 h, the nanorods were slender and skewed as shown in Fig. S3 a and b. When the growth time of TiO2-NRs was 4 h, the nanorods grew regularly with high surface area and Ag nanoparticles uniformly loaded on the surface of nanoroads shown in Fig. S3 c and d. As shown in Fig. S3 e-h, when the growth time of TiO2-NRs was longer than 4 h, the diameters and lengths of nanorods increased and the gaps among the nanoroads decreased. In this case, the Ag nanoparticles were mainly loaded on the top of the TiO2-NRs and the intervening gaps were filled with CdS. The further understand the composite structure and morphology, TEM images of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs were obtained and summarized in Fig. 3 a and b. These figures show the overall morphology of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs as a function of the magnifications level is consistent with the loading of Ag CdS film on the surface the TiO2-NRs. Fig. 3c shows the partial enlargement of TEM image of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs in which a CdS film appears to cover the TiO2-NRs and also the Ag nanoparticles. Using DigitalMicrograph software, the spacing of the lattice fringes are determined to be 0.325 nm, 0.237 nm, and 0.341 nm corresponding to TiO2 (110) [34], Ag (200) [35], and CdS (002) [36] crystalline facets, respectively. These results are consistent with XRD and XPS observations. 3.1.3 Optical absorption Fig. 4 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2-NRs, Ag/TiO2-NRs, CdS/TiO2-NRs, and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs over the wavelength range of 250–850 nm. The inset plot provides the Kubelka−Munk transformed reflectance spectra for the different electrodes. Bare TiO2-NRs absorb light mainly in the ultraviolet region with a band gap energy of 3.02 eV. The absorption spectrum of Ag/TiO2-NRs was red shifted toward 500 nm with a corresponding band gap energy of 2.32 eV, which may be due in part to the SPR effect of noble metal element Ag combined with n-type semiconductor TiO2 with the SPR peak at approximately 470 nm. In addition, the band energy gap of CdS is 2.4 eV. The cumulative effect is a shifting of absorption spectrum λ < 500 nm [37, 38]. For the comparison, the band gap energy of CdS/TiO2 was determined to be 2.25 eV. When Ag and CdS are combined with TiO2-NRs, the adsorption spectrum of composite or hybrid material CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs shifted even further to 700 nm with an energy gap of 1.57 eV. The strong absorption peak near 600 nm is attributed to the SPR effects of the Ag nanoparticles. The red shifted of peak due to the CdS layer enveloping the Ag nanoparticles has a large refractive index. Thus, the addition Ag results in a hetero-junction catalyst when combined with CdS/TiO2-NRs that is enhanced in due to the impact of SPR excitation and improved electron transfer rates due to the lowering of the Shottky barrier lowing effect of Ag to the base support. Figure S4 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs versus time of composite growth over the wavelength range of 220–850 nm. The CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR composite has its highest absorption over the range of 500–700 nm that takes place at a time less than 4 h of sintering. This effect is most likely due to several factors. At growth time less than 4 h, the diameter and length of the nanorods quite small as shown in Fig. S3 a and b with a corresponding high surface area and loading capacity. However, if the growth time is greater than 4 h, a lateral overgrowth of the nanorods occurs with an increase in diameter and a decrease in the gap distance between the nanorods (also shown in Fig. S3 e-h). As a consequence, the specific surface area is less and the loading capacity decreases. Thus, the optimal nanorod structures are found near 4 h of net reaction time to form uniform TiO2-NRs."
8,PEC properties of the electrodes,"3.2 PEC properties of the electrodes 3.2.1 Photocurrent responses The LSV of the CdS/TiO2-NRs and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes under visible or UV–Vis irradiation are shown in Fig. 5 a. The photocurrent density of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs was almost double that of the CdS/TiO2-NRs under both visible and UV–Vis irradiation. The photocurrent densities of TiO2-NRs and Ag/TiO2-NRs were barely detected under visible light irradiation. The photocurrent density of the composite CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes under the visible light irradiation ∼12 mA cm−2 at a bias voltage of +0.6 V vs SCE, which is approximately 85% of photocurrent density under UV–Vis light irradiation (nearly 14 mA cm−2 at bias voltage of 0.6 V vs SCE). This result clearly shows that the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrode has a significant visible light response capacity that allows for the PEC production of H2 under visible light irradiation. CdS, CdSe and their composites combined with TiO2 (such as TiO2/CdSe/(CdSexS1-x)5/(CdS)2 QD-MWCNT [17], CdS/CdSe/TiO2 [39], CdSe/TiO2 [40], PdS@CdS/ZnS/TiO2 [41]) could yield higher than 10 mA cm−2 photocurrent density for H2 formation by PEC process, so CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs prepared in our study (nearly 14 mA cm−2 at bias voltage of 0.6 V vs SCE) is similar with the references. Li et al. [27] had prepared a CdS/Au/TiO2-NT composite electrode with a high photocurrent response. We also prepared a CdS/Au/TiO2-NTs electrode for comparison and measured the photocurrent as shown in Fig. 5a. The photocurrent density of the CdS/Au/TiO2-NTs electrode is lower than that of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs but higher than that of CdS/TiO2-NRs electrode. The Ag deposited between the TiO2-NRs and overcoated CdS film results in more photo-generated electrons produced by the SPR effect of Ag and the improved electron transfer rates between CdS and TiO2-NRs. Fig. 5b shows LSV of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs with different growth time at bias voltage of 0.4 V vs SCE. With the growth time increased to 4 h, the photocurrent density increased twice than that of 3 h and had little electron-hole recombination. Under a long time irradiation, the photocurrent density of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs with growth time of 4 h maintained stable at about 9 mA cm−2. At growth times greater than 4 h, the resulting photocurrent density of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes decreased. It was probably due to the morphology change of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs. At a growth time for the TiO2-NRs of 3 h, the nanorods were short, thin and skewed, which limited the load of silver and CdS on the surface of TiO2-NRs. When the growth time reached to 5 h, the crystal growth rate starts to decrease as the system approaches equilibrium resulting in TiO2 film formation [11]. While, at the growth time of 4 h, TiO2-NR were shape integrity with Ag and CdS distributed uniformly. In addition, the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR composite for 4 h sintering has the highest absorption over the range of 500–700 nm resulting in highest photocurrent density. 3.2.2 Electrochemical properties Impedance and charge transfer characteristics of the composite electrodes where measured using EIS as shown in Fig. S5. The results show that the ternary composite electrode has the smallest impedance radius compared to the binary electrodes, and the naked TiO2-NRs electrode under both dark and light conditions. The low impedance of the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode bodes well for charge separation and subsequent electron and hole transfer with an applied bias potential [42–44]. The M − S curves obtained for the TiO2-NRs (a), Ag/TiO2-NRs (b), CdS/TiO2-NRs (c) and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs (d) electrodes are shown in Fig. 6 . The flat band potential, E fb, of the bare TiO2-NRs electrode is −0.34 V. Modification with Ag to form Ag/TiO2-NRs shifts the E fb to −0.74 V, which indicates that modified electrodes formed a Schottky barrier and that the Fermi level energies of Ag and TiO2 were equal. Since the conduction band of CdS is more negative than TiO2, the E fb of CdS/TiO2-NRs shifts negative to −0.59 V. Addition of Ag to CdS/TiO2-NRs shifts the E fb of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs −0.78 V. The slightly more negative E fb for CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs implies a stronger driving force for PEC H2 generation. 3.2.3 Solar energy conversion efficiency The photoconversion efficiency of the Ag/TiO2-NRs, CdS/TiO2-NRs and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrodes was determined by the photocurrent as a function of the applied bias voltage [45–47], as shown in Eq. (1): (1) η ( % ) = j p [ E r e v 0 − | E a p p | ] × 100 / I 0 where, j p is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) under bias voltage, E 0 rev is the standard reversible potential (1.23 V vs. NHE), E app is the applied potential (vs. SCE) calculated by the electrode work potential E meas (vs. SCE) subtracting open circuit voltage E aoc (vs. SCE), and I 0 is the instantaneous incident light intensity (100 mA cm−2). As shown in Fig. 7 a and b, the photoconversion efficiency of the Ag/TiO2-NR electrode virtually no photocurrent response under visible light irradiation. At the bias voltage of 0.4 V vs. SCE, the photoconversion efficiency of the CdS/TiO2-NR electrode reached a maximum of 2% while the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode achieved a maximum efficiency of 4.4%. The CdS/Au/TiO2-NT electrode as prepared by Li et al. [27] had a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 2.8%, while the photoconversion efficiency of our CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode was 1.5 times higher than the Au based electrode. This result shows that the intervening Ag nanoparticles between CdS and TiO2-NRs improved the relative photoconversion efficiency. Fig. 7c shows the IPCE of TiO2-NRs, Ag/TiO2-NRs, CdS/TiO2-NRs and CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs based electrodes. Naked TiO2-NRs electrodes had very little absorption above 450 nm, but the IPCE of modified TiO2-NRs electrodes were enhanced at 420–650 nm. In this case, CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs has a maximum IPCE = 43% at 470 nm. Fig. 7d shows the IPCE enhancement factor of the various electrode formulations. The CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrode had the maximum enhancement factor of 112 times compared to the naked TiO2-NRs electrode. For comparison, and the CdS/TiO2-NRs electrode had a more than 60 times higher IPCE compared to the naked TiO2-NRs electrode at λ < 500 nm. These results shown Ag nanoparticles not only extend the visible light response of the base TiO2-NRs, but also enhance the IPCE of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs composite electrode."
9,Production of H2,"3.3 Production of H2 In Fig. 8 a the PEC production of H2 on the different electrode formulations is compared. The production H2 on CdS/TiO2-NRs is higher than that on Ag/TiO2-NRs. The observed surface area normalized rate of H2 production was 0.09 mmol h−1 cm−2 in 1 h. However, as the photolytic reaction time increased, the production rate of H2 decreased. This may be due to photo-corrosion. The addition of Ag nanoparticles to CdS/TiO2-NRs resulted in a H2 production rate that was slower than on CdS/TiO2-NRs over the first 2 h, but at longer irradiation times the three component hybrid electrode obtained a d [H2]/dt = 0.09 mmol h−1 cm−2. As shown in Fig. 8b, the production of H2 increased to maximum level on the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode as the nano-rod growth time increased to 4 h. Beyond 4 h the production rate of H2 decreased with further increases in growth time. The SEM images of the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs as shown in Fig. S3 grow uniformly up to 4 h and also have a relatively high specific surface area leading to a higher deposited level of Ag nanoparticles and a greater degree of coverage of the TiO2-NRs by the deposited CdS films that in turn leads to an enhanced PEC production of H2. The production of H2 on the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode under EC, PC and PEC excitation is shown in Fig. 8c. H2 production is very low under PC and EC activation. However, under the PEC activation, H2 production is substantial and a function of the external applied potential. In Fig. 8d the degradation of NB is 96% after 50 min of photo-electrochemical activation. In comparison, activation by photons or an applied potential alone achieves a degradation percentage for NB of approximately 20% and 10%, respectively, after 50 min of excitation. In the absence of catalytic surface, NB was degraded 6% in 50 min in the electrolyte solution alone. The sacrificial reagents, HS− and HSO3 −/SO3 2− are frequently used reducing agents. For example, nitrobenzene (NB=ArNO2) has a reported 6-electron reduction potential of +0.83 V, while H2S going to elemental sulfur has an oxidation potential of −0.14 V. Thus, the reduction of ArNO2 with H2S should result in ArNH2 (i.e., aniline) as follows: ArNO2 + 3H2S ⇌ ArNH2 + 3So + 2H2O. (Eo r = +0.69 V). Alternative reduction products of ArNO2 reacting with H2S would be ArNO (nitrosobenzene) and ArNHOH (phenyl hydroxyl amine) on the way to ArNH2 [48,49]. The impact of NB addition on the observed H2 production rate is shown in Fig. S6. However, the addition of NB did not appreciably affect H2 production rate, although the amount of H2 produced with additional NB was more than in the absence of NB. The photocurrent density obtained in the presence or in the absence of NB was shown in Fig. S7 also shows that the presence of NB has no significant effect on the current density, only a small higher than the absence of NB, which was similar with the effect of H2 production. In addition, NB appears to impede the photo-corrosion of CdS. The stability of the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode in terms of H2 production over five cycles carried out in mixture of 0.5 M Na2S and Na2SO3 in the presence of 30 mg L−1 of NB was determined. As shown in Fig. S8, the composite CdS/Ag/TiO2-NR electrode is stable for more than 30 h of total reaction. The Faradaic efficiency η of H2 was calculated and depicted in Fig. S9 reached 65.83% after 6 h and the picture of production of H2 on the foam nickel was shown in Fig. S10. Since the current is displayed directly at the power supply with two-electrode system but not a three electrode cell configuration, the Faradaic efficiency is calculated slightly low."
10,Proposed PEC mechanism of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs for H2 production,"3.4 Proposed PEC mechanism of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs for H2 production CdS is a narrow gap semiconductor, which is susceptible to photo-corrosion especially under high light intensities. This problem can be overcome by using sacrificial electron donors such as Na2S and Na2SO3 for trapping the valence-band hole and preventing the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate within the solid phase. In our study, NB serves as an electron donor (i.e., a sacrificial reagent) instead of S2−/SO3 2− that reacts with a surface trapped hole and transfers an electron to the high redox potential hole. On the one hand, electron-hole pairs were separated and photo-induced electron was transferred to the cathode for H2 production. At the same time, NB is oxidized further due to a diffusion controlled reaction with oxygen. A plausible mechanism for the electro-catalytic reactions taking place on photo-activated CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs is shown in Scheme 2 . Under the visible light irradiation condition, CdS absorbs over a broad range to produce conduction band electrons within CdS that can be further captured by Ag. In addition, the SPR phenomenon formed by a combination of Ag and an n-type semiconductor (e.g., TiO2) generates additional electrons for water or proton reduction. Photo-activation of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs results in little H2 production. However, under an applied potential bias, photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of CdS are transferred to first to Ag and then subsequently to TiO2, and then to the cathode resulting in the generations of H2. An additional driving force is provided by the impact of SPR taking place on Ag, which leads to facilitated transfer to TiO2 and then to the cathode surface. Surface bound Ag+∙ formed because of the SPR effect can be reduced back to Ag0 as mediated by CdS. The most likely sequence of reaction steps are as follows: (2) CdS + hv → CdS (h+) + CdS (e−) (3) CdS (e−) + Ag → Ag (e−) + CdS (4) Ag (e−) + TiO2 →TiO2 (e−) + Ag (5) Ag + hv → Ag* (6) Ag*+ TiO2 → Ag+∙+ TiO2 (e−) (7) Ag+∙+ CdS → Ag + CdS (h+) (8) TiO2 (e−) → external circuit → cathode (e−) (9) e− + H+ → ½H2 ↑ (10) h+ + NB → … … → small molecular byproducts → … … → CO2 + H2O"
11,Summary,"A composite electrode composed of CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs was synthesized and characterized. Based on TiO2-NRs at a growth time of 4 h, ternary composite electrode showed the best PEC performance. The production of H2 reached 2.24 mmol under 6 h visible light irradiation with the production rate of 0.09 mmol h−1 cm−2. Its PEC activity was quantified and shown to be effective for H2 production combined with the degradation of NB. The enhanced electrochemical activity is attributed to: 1) the formation of Schottky bridge between silver and the n-type semiconductor, titanium dioxide, which resulted in a SPR effect that extended the visible light absorption range up to 700 nm for the semiconductor electrode; and 2) the improved charge-transfer rate due to the low Schottky barrier of the Ag-composite that effectively inhibited the electron-hole recombination. Since the CdS/Ag/TiO2-NRs electrode could produce H2 accompanied by degradation of NB under visible light irradiation, it would be probably using other contaminants as sacrificial reagent rather than sodium sulfide and sodium sulfite for H2 production in the future. It is a prospective material for solar H2 production combined with pollutants degradation in order to greatly reduce the energy consumption and eliminate environmental pollutants."
