0,Introduction,"Hypothesis. This study was focused on the extraction of chicken fats from the slaughterhouse wastewater and harnessing of the obtaining by-products as additive in starch/ poly(vinyl alcohol)-based composite films. In a consumer society with huge problems related to environmental pollution and limited non-renewable resources, bio-based macromolecules and derivatives are more and more considered to be used in polymeric and composite materials with different destination (Deepak, Johnson, Arumuga Prabu, Amuthakkannan, & Arun Prasath, 2017; Mhatre, Raja, Saxena, & Patil, 2019; Vaisanen, Das, & Tomppo, 2017). Starch (St) represents a natural resource extensively used in biodegradable polymeric materials synthesis, due to its low cost, abundant availability and also good compatibility with other small and macro eco-friendly molecules, used to achieve desired performances (Soykeabkaew, Thanomsilp, & Suwantong, 2015; Sudharsan et al., 2016; Tian, Yan, Varada Rajulu, Xiang, & Luo, 2017). Blending St with other polymers represents a good way to overcome the shortcomings regarding dificult processability as well as poor mechanical and thermal performances or low water resistance (Akrami, Ghasemi, Azizi, Karrabi, & Seyedabadi, 2016; Ortega-Toro, Munoz, Talens, & Chiralt, 2016; Tian et al., 2017). Regarding this aspect, combining St with the biodegradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) represents a good method to compensate the poor properties of the St as well as the higher cost of the PVA, reaching a good film-forming capacity, mechanical performance, chemical resistance, water solubility etc (Domene-López, Guillén, Martin-Gullon, García-Quesada, & Montalbán, 2018; Tian et al., 2017). On the other hand, problems related to uncontrolled discharge of food processing effluents into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems represent major environmental issues asking for major concern worldwide (Noukeu et al., 2016). The wastewater resulted from specific processes in the slaughterhouses has a very high content of organic matter in solution and suspension. To be sent to local sewage treatment plants, wastewater requires a series of specific treatments to reduce the continuous growth of world pollution (Bustillo-Lecompte, Mehrvar, & Quiñones-Bolaños, 2016; Bustillo-Lecompte & Mehrvar, 2017). Processing coarse solids, resulted wastewater still contains pollutants as organic and eutrophicants compounds and also certain amounts of fat that must be removed before the discharging of the effluents into the water receivers (Husain et al., 2014). The treatment of wastewater with lipidic content isn’t a new technology, over time being developed alternative processes to breaking down the oils and fats in wastewater before their disposal. Enzymatic treatment or microwave radiation techniques have gained more attention during the time, due to their ecofriendly behavior but, the high costs related to these procedures may represent an important disadvantage. Physical and mechanical methods to remove the fats and greases from the wastewater, before their disposal, (as skimming, gravity separation) are also simple and rather efficient conventional methods (Chipasa & Medrzycka, 2006; Jung, Cammarota, & Freire, 2002; Saifuddin & Chua, 2006). Irrespective of the applied procedure to separate the lipids form the wastewater, residual fat traces represent a real problem in the subsequent purification processes as well as the processing capacity of the sewage treatment plants (Ankyu & Noguchi, 2014). It is therefore necessary to find alternative methods to recover the fat traces from wastewater and also an efficient conversion of these residues into valuable products. Also, the national and international environmental policies request to reuse the lipid residues collected through standard wastewater purifying procedures. The usual way to give value for these residues is the biogas production (Husain et al., 2014; Li, Champagne & Anderson, 2011). Turning the wasteful by-products together with raw materials into useful products or intermediates for new processes and technologies is associated to environmental protection vision since the waste range show a considerable diversity. The current work proposes a new method to remove the fat traces from the slaughterhouse’s wastewater using vegetable oil-based photo-reactive monomers and visible radiation. The recovered product was then used as additive in St/PVA-based composite materials. The main scope of the study was to evaluate the effect of the recovered polymeric fraction (PFrec) containing fat traces from the wastewater on structural, mechanical and thermal properties of St/PVA-based materials. Thus, total methacrylated linseed oil (MLO) was used to recover the grease from the wastewater, using a simple well-mixing of the oil-based monomer and wastewater, followed by photo-polymerization of the reactor with visible radiation. Due to the chemical affinity, the grease from the wastewater and the vegetable oil-derived monomer form a common phase and through the photo-irradiation of MLO, the grease molecules are entrapped into the polymeric network. Collected PFrec was subsequently used to obtain composites through a simple casting method. Some of the advantages related to irradiation strategy to “extract” the fatty traces from the wastewater are: absence of any surfactant or reaction solvent, execution at ambient temperature as well as the short reaction times."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Acquisition and preparation of material,"2.1 Acquisition and preparation of material The used potato starch, poly(vinyl alcohol) (87–90 % hydrolysed, Mw 30,000–70,000), glycerol and chemicals for polymer initiation (camphorquinone and ethyl (dimethylamino) benzoate) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received, without any further purification. The raw material employed to obtain the reactive monomer was an assortment of linseed oil (LO) extracted by cold pressing, kindly supplied by Vandeputte Oleochemicals, Mouscron, Belgium. The LO-based monomer (Fig. 1 ) was synthesized following the functionalization strategy previously reported and the chemical modification of the oil was monitored through 1H‐NMR and FTIR spectroscopy (Balanuca, Stan, Hanganu, & Iovu, 2014; Balanuca, Stan, Hanganu, Lungu, & Iovu, 2015; Balanuca, Lungu et al., 2015). The completely methacrylated LO (MLO) was used as reactive monomer, compatible with the lipidic traces from the waste water that should be treated."
3,Preparation of simulated wastewater samples,"2.2 Preparation of simulated wastewater samples The samples used in this study simulate the wastewater from the chicken slaughterhouses (resulted through the specific wastewater plant treatments, prior to discharge, characterized by a low but unwanted lipid content). Real chicken fat was used for the preparation of the simulated wastewater sample. Fatty acid composition of the used fat is: 2 %, di-unsaturated: 10 %, mono-unsaturated: 59 %, saturated: 29 %, determined from 1H-NMR spectrum employing chemometric equations described in the literature [Hanganu, Todasca, Chira, Maganu, & Rosca, 2012]. Several concentrations of chicken fat in water have been tested, in order to reach a value as close as possible to the wastewater sent to sewage treatment plants. The validation of this fat concentration was set through Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) determinations, according to ASTM D1252 – 06 (2012) e1. Thus, a 0.5 ppm lipid content in water was adopted, corresponding to a COD of 740 mg O2/ L, a value at the lower end of fat content in slaughterhouse wastewater [Bustillo-Lecompte & Mehrvar, 2017]."
4,Lipid traces recovery,"2.3 Lipid traces recovery The idealized representation of the procedure to recover the lipid traces contained by the wastewater is depicted in Figure S1 (Idealized representation and the experimental setup of the procedure employed to recover the chicken fat traces from the wastewater - supplementary information). Preliminary photopolymerization tests have been performed in order to identify the optimal MLO concentration required to “trap” and retain the fat traces. Mixture of MLO and a specific photo-initiating system consisting of camphorquinone (CQ, 0.2 %wt) and ethyl (dimethylamino) benzoate (EDMAB, 0.8 %wt) was brought to the wastewater in the established amount, under continuously stirring, in order to favour the association of the lipidic molecules (MLO and fat traces, respectively). After 10 min., the stirring was stopped and the water-lipid mixture was kept 10 min. to set. Then, the glass beaker was irradiated on the top (2 min.) and all around (2 min.), for a complete reaction of the methacrylates grafted on the MLO structure. Monomer to polymer conversion was performed with a visible‐radiation LED source (450–500 nm and output light intensity: 1640 mW/ cm2 – radiometer measurement), maintaining a constant distance from the light source to water surface (mediated by a glass microscope slide, for the top irradiation, or by the beaker walls). The polymeric fraction (PFrec), resulted through the visible light polymerization was physically collected from the water surface and glass beaker walls, dried and milled, the obtained powder being subsequently characterized and used in the following research step. Also, the treated water has been subjected to quality indicator-determination through COD method, performed with an automatic reflux and volumetric titration system."
5,Synthesis of starch/poly(vinyl alcohol)-based composites,"2.4 Synthesis of starch/poly(vinyl alcohol)-based composites The obtained PFrec was added to St/PVA-based blends, in order to enhance the overall properties of synthesized composites. Glycerol (Gly) was also employed as plasticizer for the St-phase. Thus, St/PVA-based films were fabricated through a solution mixing and evaporative casting method (Domene-López et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2017), using a constant weight ratio for PVA and St, the composition of the formulated mixtures being summarized in Table 1 . Phase A and phase B were kept at 90°C, 30 min. under magnetic stirring. Then, PVA solution was gradually poured over St solution and the magnetic stirring was maintained for another 30 min., at 90°C. For P2, P3 and P4, Gly and respectively PFrec have been added into PVA solution from the zero-point of the experiment, in order to obtain a good dispersion of the additives (especially for PFrec). The obtained final solutions were slowly poured in the Teflon moulds and maintained 24 h at 40°C, aiming the film formation. The so obtained composites were characterized by different techniques in order to establish their performances and the role that PFrec can play in St/PVA-based formulations."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization 2.5.1 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III Ultrashield Plus 500 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm, using the TMS as internal standard. 2.5.2 Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) Structural analysis of St/PVA-based materials was carried out on Vertex 70 Brucker Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory with Ge crystal. The FTIR spectra were recorded at room temperature (25°C), using 32 scans in 600−4000 cm−1 wave number region, with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Fourier self-deconvolution of the registered spectra was performed using Omnic software, applied to enhance the resolution in the spectral region of 3000−2700 cm−1. 2.5.3 Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) A thermogravimetric analyser (Q500 TA) was used to determine the thermal behaviour of the St/PVA-based materials. Samples (about 2.5 mg) were heated from 20 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/ min, under constant nitrogen flow rate. 2.5.4 Mechanical assays The mechanical properties were measured on a Universal Mechanical Tester (Instron, Model 3382, USA), using a speed of 2 mm/ min and a load cell of 100 kN. A minimum of four specimens were weighted and measured using an LCD electronic digital caliper micrometer. Thus, films with approximate 0.5 mm thickness and 80 mm height were mounted in the film-extension grip and stress-strain curves were obtained at room temperature (25 ⁰C). Then, tensile strength at break (MPa), percentage of elongation at break (%) and Young modulus were calculated. Grammage of the film was calculated as weight/ m2, samples being weighted using an analytical balance (precision up to 0.001 g). 2.5.5 Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) Thermo-mechanical properties of St/PVA-based composites were measured on Tritec 2000 (Triton Technology) instrument, operated in single cantilever bending mode. Rectangular sample with approximate dimension of 10 mm wide, 0.5 mm thick, 40 mm long were tested at 1 Hz while ramping the temperature from −40 °C to 150 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min. 2.5.6 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) DSC measurement were performed using Netzsch DSC 204F1 Phoenix equipment and were carried out under nitrogen flow and heating rate of 5 °C/ min., in the temperature range -25 to 250 °C. DSC thermograms were recorded using two-cycles heating and cooling runs, in order to eliminate all thermal history of the materials. The crystallization temperatures (Tc) and corresponding enthalpy (ΔHc) values were obtained from the cooling thermograms (heat flux/ temperature). Likewise, melting temperatures (Tm) and corresponding enthalpy (ΔHm) values were obtained from the second heating step. The crystallinity degree of PVA-phase was calculated using Eq (1) (Cano et al., 2015): (1) X = 1 X P V A Δ H Δ H 0 x 100 where ΔH, is the melting enthalpy of the sample, ΔH0, the melting enthalpy of a 100 % crystalline PVA sample (161.6 J/ g) (Roohani et al., 2008) and XPVA, the mass fraction of PVA in the sample. 2.5.7 Solubility properties The potential of PFrec to stabilize the degradation rate in water for the synthesized St/PVA-based materials was determined for 1 cm2 samples. Thus, the solubility tests were performed by individually immersion of the materials (five specimens from each sample) in 15 mL tubes containing 10 mL water, capped and maintained at room temperature (25°C). At predefined periods, the samples were removed from water, dried in oven at 50 °C (24 h) and weighed, in order to determine the final mass of dry matter (mf). The water immersion – drying – weighing protocol is repeated until the specimen’s structure are macroscopically damaged. The solubility profile was determined using the following equation (Domene-López et al., 2018): (2) S ( % ) = ( m i - m f ) m i x 100 where mi and mf represent the weight of the sample before and after soaking in water 2.5.8 Contact angle measurements Static contact angle (CA) values were determined for the initial films at room temperature (25°C) using a DSA100E (KRUSS GMBH) equipment. Ultrapure water droplets were used with a drop volume of approximately 2 μL. The measurement of each CA was done within 10 s of the drop contacts with the surface. The contact angles reported represent the mean of three determinations for each synthesized St/PVA-based films. 2.5.9 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Scanning electron microscopy was used to explore the morphology of the new composites based on starch and poly(vinyl alcohol), both on the surface and also on the cross-section, samples being manually broken in liquid nitrogen for the cross‐sectional analysis. Also, PFrec particles size was determined. All the samples were sputtered with a thin layer of gold to enhance the surface conductivity and then were scanned using a Quanta Inspect F SEM device equipped with a field emission gun with a resolution of 1.2 nm.”"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and characterization of methacrylated linseed oil,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of methacrylated linseed oil Methacrylated linseed oil (MLO) was synthesized via a two-step strategy, using a protocol previously established for LO and also other vegetable oil (Balanuca et al., 2014; Balanuca, Stan et al., 2015; Balanuca, Lungu et al., 2015). Fig. 2 presents the 1H-NMR spectra of crude LO, epoxidized and methacrylated LO. In ELO spectrum can be observed the specific signals of the protons from the epoxy rings at 1.7 ppm, 3.1-2.8 ppm and also is noted the disappearance of the signal assigned to HCCH from the fatty acids (5.4 ppm). The NMR spectrum registered for MLO monomer reveals new signals assigned to the protons from methacrylic radicals: 2H (CH 2) at 6.2 and 5.6 ppm and 3H (CH 3) around 1.8 ppm. Based on the NMR spectral data, using the previously reported calculation method (Balanuca, Stan et al., 2015; Balanuca, Lungu et al., 2015), a methacrylation degree of ≈ 96 % was obtained. FTIR spectrometry confirms the 1H-NMR findings for both ELO and MLO compounds and in Fig. 3 can be observed specific signals assigned to ν COC from the epoxy rings and also the specific signals attributed to ν CC and δ C–H from the methacrylic groups at 1638 and 944 cm−1 respectively."
9,Lipid traces recovery from the wastewater and characterization of the obtained product,"3.2 Lipid traces recovery from the wastewater and characterization of the obtained product Once introduced into the wastewater, under continuous shaking, MLO monomer embedded the fat traces, due to their chemical nature, favouring non-covalent hydrophobic bonds between monomer chains and chicken fat molecules. Based on the density differences, the lipidic phase tends to stay on the water surface. This way, by photo-polymerization of the methacrylate groups, the residual fats have been easily entrapped into the MLO network, in mild conditions. The decomposition processes of the organic fractions contained by the wastewater which start above 30−40 °C has been avoided along with other advantages like low energy consumption. The polymeric lipid film (PFrec) was physically removed from water surface and glass beaker walls, dried and grounded. PFrec powder was characterized through FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. In the FTIR spectrum of PFrec (Fig. 3), the specific signals assigned to the ν CC and δ =C–H (1638 and 944 cm−1) significantly decrease. In this case, there can be noted that the presence of the fat traces, trapped from the wastewater does not affect the reactivity of the methacrylic groups in the polymerization process under the established conditions. Wastewater quality assessment can be done by calculating the amount of oxygen that can be consumed by the contained organic impurities translated by COD values, thus the efficiency of MLO treatment method can be validated. Comparing the COD value of 740 mg O2/ L corresponding to wastewater the one obtained for MLO treated water showed a significant decrease until 200 mg O2/ L, explained by the formation of MLO-fat traces structures. The proposed strategy can be considered a successful one, representing a real, cheap and readily solution for a major problem faced by the food industry (Bustillo-Lecompte & Mehrvar, 2017)."
10,Synthesis and characterization of starch/poly(vinyl alcohol)-based materials,"3.3 Synthesis and characterization of starch/poly(vinyl alcohol)-based materials The strategy to harness the resulted PFrec reside in the incorporation of this by-product in the synthesis of St/PVA-based composite materials, with potential applications in agro-industrial area. 3.3.1 FTIR spectrometry By association of hydrophobic structure of PFrec with water soluble St and PVA, component miscibility represents a criterion necessary to follow. By means of FTIR spectrometry qualitative informations can be obtained (Dimonie et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2014). The FTIR spectra of St/PVA-based composites with Gly and PFrec content are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The broad band at 3000–3600 cm−1 was assigned to the OH stretching from St, PVA, Gly and also PFrec and indicates strong molecular hydrogen bonding, especially when Gly is used in the formulation, denoting good compatibility of the components (Cano et al., 2015). For a better understanding of the component’s compatibility, deconvolution procedure was applied for the FTIR registered spectra (Fig. 4-detail). The peaks around 2944 and 2918 cm−1 in P1 and P2 FTIR spectra are assigned to CH stretching vibration form PVA and St respectively. Some vibrational displacements are registered for P3 where 2 peaks are observed at 2930 and 2830 cm−1, indicating a very good compatibility of the components, ν CH being shifted in only two broad absorption bands, possibly due to inter/ intra-molecular bonding between the components (Akhavan, Khoylou, & Ataeivarjovi, 2017). This behaviour can be associated with the role played by the Gly molecules upon PFrec within the continuous phase, improving the compatibility of the final mixture. The shape of the deconvoluted peaks at 2922 and 2853 cm−1 (P4) may indicate better compatibility than basic components without the addition of the ""additives"" (P1). 3.3.2 Thermo-gravimetric analysis For all the synthesized materials, the thermograms indicate three main weight loss stages: 50−200 °C, 200−400 °C and 400−500 °C (Table 2 ). The initial weight loss, below 200 °C for P1 and P4, the one at 231 °C for P2 and respectively the shoulder at 244 °C for P3 is assigned to the water and Gly evaporation (Leblanc et al., 2008). The behaviour of the samples within this degradation stage can be corelated with the tendency observed during the first steps of solubility measurements showing that the content of water and Gly are correctly associated for TGA findings in Figure S2 (A) DTG and B) TGA curves for St/PVA-based composites). The maximum degradation temperature (Tmax) around 301−303 °C is attributed to the first degradation step of the St/PVA network following the second degradation step which is influenced by the added components (Gly and PFrec). PFrec did not affected the thermal stability of the St/PVA in the main degradation stage, even if the thermal degradation behaviour exhibited by the neat PFrec is different (Figure S2). On the other hand, both Gly and PFrec added in P3 formulation decrease the temperature values for the ultimate degradation stage. There is also observed that DTG peak is sharp and narrow for P1 and P4 blends, while for P2 and P3 are broader, due to low molecular weight Gly, leading to changes in macromolecular domains rearrangement by the cleavage of multiple H bonds from host networks. Regarding the thermal stability of St/PVA-based blends, the influence of PFrec loading is clearly noticed (Figure S2(B) and Table 2). Td3 % value significantly increased for P4 as compared with the other formulated systems, the degradation process following the same trend on the whole used temperature range. Thus, it may be concluded that through the pre-established formulation conditions, the addition of PFrec by-product can improve the general thermal stability of the St/PVA-based materials, through a good dispersion of this polymeric fine powder into the water-based blends. 3.3.3 Mechanical assays The addition of PFrec into the formulation of St/PVA blends indicates some changes in the calculated Young modulus values (Table 3 ). It is well known that the addition of Gly aims to improve the flexibility and thus to reduce the brittleness of St host network and PVA (Karaogul, Altuntas, Salan, & Alm, 2019; Mao, Imam, Gordon, Cinelli, & Chiellini, 2000). When additives are used, the grammage values are slightly modified, both Gly and PFrec increasing (individually) the films weight/ unit area. When both additives are used in P3, there is not a major influence, in comparison with sample P2, probably due to a good compatibility along with efficient dispersion of Gly molecules at the interface between the PFrec and St/PVA. Significant influence in tensile strength and Young modulus for P2 (St/PVA + Gly) were obtained comparing with those for P1 (St/PVA). The elongation at break was also significantly influenced, confirming the plasticization effect of Gly when is added into St/PVA mixture, increasing the free volume by improving the movement of the polymeric chains (Abdullah & Dong, 2017). When PFrec is used, all the items regarding mechanical properties are strongly influenced (Figure S3 - Stress–strain curves registered for St/PVA-based composite films). PFrec increase the tensile strength value (4.4 MPa for P3 and 10.4 MPa for P4) when compared with P2 (1.8 MPa) and decrease when compared with P1 (27.6 MPa). When PFrec is replacing Gly, due to its 3D network, an increase in the rigidity of the final materials is translated as higher value of tensile strength compared with P2 and P3. This fact can be explained by the supramolecular structure of PFrec, which will impede the formation of H bonds that confer the rigidity in the PVA based samples. In the same time, the large PFrec structure will not reach the plasticizing capacity of small molecules of Gly. Elongation at break registered for P3 (27.8 %) is higher compared to P1 (11.3 %) and for P4 (3.3 %), but is lower than P2. This finding is associated to characteristics of rigid plastic material for P4. A look of the whole data regarding elongation at break indicated that the presence of Gly could improve the interface between FPrec and St/PVA blends, leading to a better dispersion. Young modulus increases with the addition of PFrec (91.3 MPa for P3 and 436.2 MPa for P4) as compared to P2 (5.3 MPa) which are the most elastic material, as it is expected. PVA based materials have a large number of inter and intramolecular H bonds which are leading to increased rigidity. In case of adding a “disturbing” component these structures can be tailored for specific performances. Thus, the addition of PFrec will give intermediate mechanical characteristics between highly plasticized Gly based formulations and so rigid St/PVA blends. The performed mechanical tests led to the general conclusion that PFrec may not play a plasticizer role due to its supramolecular structure but can be used in St/PVA blends as reinforcing component. Mixed with Gly, FPrec exert a synergistic effect on the final materials when they are considered for agro-industrial applications. 3.3.4 Dynamic mechanical analysis When DMA is performed, valuable informations could be obtained regarding the structure arrangement of the composite networks (Domene-López et al., 2018). Thus, DMA data (Table 4 , Figure S4 - Tan delta versus temperature registered for P1-P4 samples) indicate the smallest Tg values for Gly-plasticized materials. Comparing the second Tg value of P3 sample with that obtained for P4 it can be noticed a shifting to higher temperatures, these phenomena being associated to reinforcing capacity of PFrec content which brings resistance during the dynamically-mechanical experiment. The first transition registered for P3 is comparable and middle-placed within the two extreme values registered for P1 (St/PVA) and P2 (St/PVA + Gly). The Tg value around −3°C was observed only for P2, being probably due to the molecular α transitions of the PVA and plasticized St phase (Sreekumar, Al-Harthi, & De, 2012). Thus, the first transition for P3 can be attributed to plasticized-like phase given by the presence of Gly at the interface between St and PVA host molecules and PFrec. 3.3.5 DSC study DSC characterization on the St/PVA blends is a procedure to obtain information about phase transitions and interactions between the components. Materials crystallinity depends on the components capacity to form ordered crystalline structures as well as on the mobility of the chains (Sugiarto, Sunarti, Indriyani, & Lisdayana, 2017). Thus, a look on the values of calculated crystallinity (Table 4; Figure S5 - DSC curves of P1-P4 samples: A – melting and B – crystalization) will highlight the ability of Gly and PFrec to reduce the ordered assembly of St/PVA blends and consequently the effects which come along with it, specifically brittleness. Even if P3 had intermediary values for thermal and mechanical properties, when crystallinity degree for PVA-phase was calculated for the formulated blends, it can be noticed the lowest value, indicating the synergistic effect of the two components, Gly and PFrec respectively. Due to the PFrec and low-molecular Gly compatibility, a new microstructure arrangement is probably achieved, with Gly at the PFrec and St/PVA blend interface. This fact was also observed through the deconvolution of C–H characteristic vibrations from the host network. In this case, the crystalline PVA domains could be more easily penetrated by the PFrec-microphases formed in the presence of Gly molecules. Once introduced in the blends of the host molecules, PFrec hinder the formation of H bonds between the functional groups of the polymers and thus, the crystalline, orderly structure is disturbed, for both high-crystalline PVA but also for St regions where interconnecting amylopectin clusters confer alternative orderly arrangements (Bertoft, 2017). The diminished crystalline degree for P3 is in accordance with the hypothesis underlined by the elongation at break results. 3.3.6 Solubility test Taking into account that water molecules in St/PVA-based materials can influence their physical properties (Domene-López et al., 2018; Lawton, 1996), water solubility measurements are adequate for this samples. Corroborated with their potential applications as agricultural biodegradable films or slow-release capsules for fertilizers, materials response to the environmental conditions is a limiting factor for the overall performances for end use. Samples containing PFrec (P4 specimens) exhibit lowest solubility degree values while Gly-loaded materials (P2) reveal the higher solubility degree along with their disintegration after 120 h. When PVA is blended with St (P1), due to their superior hydroxyl content, water penetration is favoured, but lower when compared with the Gly-plasticized P2. In this case, there are some differences in the phase distribution as it was observed in the calculated crystallinity degree which can diminish the molecular mobility and the water diffusion (Cano et al., 2015). Using hydrophobic PFrec, the formation of H-bonds is impeded, resulting not only the stiffening effect, as established from the tensile strength, but also an improved solubility resistance for the St/PVA-based samples. This can be considered an advantage gained by St/PVA blends with the addition of PFrec, due to its hydrophobic behaviour hindering the diffusion of water molecules. Certainly, there is necessary to maintain an equilibrium between materials insolubility and their biodegradability, these two characteristics being closely related (Domene-López et al., 2018). In this regard, biodegradable and environmentally-friendly hydrophobic bio-based PFrec can be a great solution for the water sensitive blends, based on the water-soluble PVA and water-sensitive starch. 3.3.7 Contact angle The surface properties of the St/PVA-based composite films were investigated by contact-angle measurements (Table 5 ). These results followed the expectation that the hydrophilicity would increase with the addition of Gly. No major differences on the material hydrophobicity were observed for P4 where PFrec is loaded into the host blend as compared with pure St/PVA film. This behaviour provided the indication that hydrophobic PFrec is well dispersed in the bulk of materials. There is also an evidence of the synergistic effect in the CA value observed for Gly + PFrec formulation (P3). The presence of plasticizer molecules at the interface between PFrec and St/PVA network is depleting the P3 surface of hydrophilic Gly molecules leading to a higher value of CA compared with P2. 3.3.8 Scanning electron microscopy (composites morphology and PFrec particle size) Granulometric analysis was employed in order to determine average particle size of PFrec. Thus, SEM image was recorded for PFrec powder and then particle size distribution was established to be 0.25 μm (Figure S6 - SEM micrograph and size distribution graph for PFrec). Fig. 5 presents the macroscopic view of the synthesized St/PVA-based composite materials (Fig. 5 – A) and their corresponding surface (Fig. 5 – B) and respectively cross-sectional (Fig. 5 – C and D) micrographs. Analysing the photos of the films (A) and the surface SEM images (B) there can be clearly notice that the presence of Gly in P2 led to the smooth surface while, the other compositions exhibit a similar morphological profile indicating bubble-like appearance, probably due to the starch granular shape. Uniform cross‐sections can be observed for all the cryogenic fracture surfaces (D). For P3 containing PFrec and Gly, no phase segregation was observed but uniform dispersion of these polymeric particles within aqueous starch and PVA medium. When higher hydrophobic PFrec content is loaded with no addition of Gly (P4), uniform but more rough cross-sectional morphology can be observed. This behaviour could be explained by the absence of small Gly molecules as a mediator between the aqueous phase of the St/PVA blend and the hydrophobic additive."
11,Conclusions,"Herein it was developed a new rational process to recover the fat traces from the food industry-resulted wastewater and a harnessing strategy for the resulted by-products in starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) (St-PVA)-based composite materials. The recovering of lipid traces from the wastewater was successfully achieved using visible radiation and methacrylated linseed oil as photo-reactive monomer to entrap the grease molecules. The obtained polymeric fraction (PFrec) was evaluated as an additive, together with or in the absence of glycerol (Gly) as plasticizer. The final properties of composites are strongly influenced by the PFrec content. By means of FTIR the phases compatibility was found to be improved when Gly and PFrec are used together, hypothesis confirmed also by DSC analysis which revealed higher Tg for the composite system containing both additives. Through the mechanical tests it was highlighted the synergistic effect of the two components upon the host molecules. Also, tensile strength at break and Young modulus were increased when PFrec was loaded. When solubility tests were joined, the hydrophobic polymeric fraction impede the formation of hydrogen bonds between the host-networks, increasing their water resistance. SEM images revealed uniform morphology for these composites, with no phase segregation. Taking into account the biodegradability and its environmentally-friendly behaviour, the methacrylated linseed oil and visible radiation could be considered a good way to remove the lipid traces from the wastewater and also wasteful PFrec could bring a new harnessing vision in St/PVA-based composite synthesis."
