0,Introduction,"Biomass-derived furan compounds are among the most attractive platform molecules that link renewable biomass resources and chemicals/fuels [1–5]. Catalytic conversion of these furan compounds via selective hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis in the presence of low cost and facile available hydrogen (H2) provides an effective pathway towards a large family of valuable fine chemicals and fuel components [6,7]. Generally, the conversion above involves multiple tandem reactions including hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bond of furan group, hydrogenolysis, ring open, ring hydrolysis, decarbonylation [8–10], etc. Thereby, the development of highly active heterogeneous catalysts becomes essential towards target products but remains challenging because of the activity-selectivity trade-off, i.e., high activity of the active sites frequently associates with a high risk of over-hydrogenation [11–13]. Supported noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) are widely applied active sites for hydrogenation but usually suffer from low atom efficiency and instability due to metal sintering and leaching [14–18]. From these regards, the heterogeneous noble metal catalysts equipped with high yield, turnover number (TON), and favorable stability are highly requirable for the selective hydrogenation of bio-furans with H2. Zeolites, crystalline aluminosilicates, have a large surface area, uniform microchannel, and high thermal/hydrothermal stability [19–21]. Thanks to these advantageous properties, zeolites have been extensively applied as catalysts and supports for numerous industrial processes. Nonetheless, the traditional impregnation method usually leads to a high risk of pore blockage during the catalyst preparation and potential metal aggregation/leaching in the reaction [19,22,23]. Alternatively, the encapsulation of noble metal NPs within the zeolite crystals behaves as an efficient strategy to alleviate these issues above [24,25]. More importantly, the synergy of the stable active sites and confinement effect of zeolites' regular microchannel allows the opportunity to enhance the activity and modulate the selectivity via sterically controlling the mass transfer in the space-confined pore systems [26,27]. For example, the confined Pd and Pt NPs within the BEA framework boosted the atom efficiency in the conversion of aromatic alcohols into aromatic aldehydes and the pure silica TON zeolite encapsulated Pt NPs offered high activity in the selective hydrogenation [28–30]. The chemical composition (SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio, heteroatom substitution, type and dispersion of counter cations) and topology of target zeolite contribute significantly to the mass transfer process of substrate, intermediates, and products in appointed catalysis [14,31,32]. Therefore, the integration of noble metal NPs and zeolite matrix becomes extremely important. The direct synthesis method favors to enable homogeneous metal dispersion and simplify the preparation process, but the example is still limited, attributable to the easy precipitation of metal oxide or hydroxide under the strong basic environment during the crystallization process of zeolite. ZSM-22 is a type of industrial important zeolite with TON topology featuring one-dimensional ten-membered ring straight microchannel [33–35]. However, the synthesis of pure silica TON zeolite is difficult, let alone the noble metal encapsulated ones. Up to now, only one example of Pt containing silicate TON zeolite was reported for the phenylacetylene hydrogenation into styrene [29]. Impregnation and ion exchange are the two traditional methods to immobilize Pd NPs on zeolites, but easily caused the particle migration at high temperature or during the reaction process and thus a corresponding loss of catalytic activity [44,50]. With much effort devoted to resolving this problem, direct encapsulation of the noble metal in zeolite through the one-pot hydrothermal method is being an important goal of research programs [51]. Previously, the strategy of seed-assisted transformations was widely used for the synthesis of Pd containing MFI and BEA zeolites [24,52,53]. In the crystallization process of drygelconversion method, the steam and pressure generated by high temperature have a beneficial effect on the crystallization of the amorphous precursor dry gel, which could prevent direct contact with water or a mixed liquid containing a volatile structure directing agent [54,55]. This strategy is beneficial to inhibit the potential phase separation and promote nucleation to produce a pure phase as the gel is a high-density homogeneous silicon precursor. By the advantage of the solid conversion process, the metal aggregation will be inhibited under high pH conditions [56]. Besides, the drygelconversion method can crystallize under solvent-free conditions, avoiding the precipitation of precious metal components during packaging, thereby obtaining smaller NPs [57]. Nonetheless, encapsulation of Pd NPs inside TON zeolite through dry-gel-conversion method has not been reported yet. In this work, pure silica ZSM-22 encapsulated Pd NPs was generally synthesized by one-pot dry gel conversion method. An ionic liquid was used as the structure-directing agent and an organosilane reagent was used as the ligand to stabilize the metal species during the synthesis. Various synthetic parameters were explored to reach highly crystalline Pd–Si-ZSM-22 zeolites with large surface area and highly dispersive Pd NPs. The hydrogenation performance of established Pd–Si-ZSM-22 was evaluated in the conversion of furfuryl alcohol (FA), important biodiversity coming from the hydrogenation of facile available hemicellulose derived furfural [36,37]. The selective hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, or etherification of FA produce various valuable chemicals like tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 1,5-pentanediols, 1,2-pentanediols, 2-methylfuran (2-MF), and alkyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether (ATE) [38,39]. Among them, THFA is interested as a cheap biodegradable solvent with versatile applications in agriculture and industry [40]. Despite certain efforts, fabrication of effective heterogeneous catalysts for FA hydrogenation into THFA remains one challenge because of the easy formation of byproducts due to over-hydrogenation and even ring-opening [40–43]. Herein, Pd–Si-ZSM-22 catalysts effectively catalyzed the synthesis of THFA from FA with high yield/selectivity, unprecedented large TON, and stable recyclability. The confinement effect responsive to this catalytic behavior was discussed through the comparison with task-specially designed control catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Characterizations,2.1 Characterizations The crystal structure of synthesized zeolites was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer (Cu source) from 5° to 50°. The morphological information was explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM) on a Hitachi S-4800 instrument. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were collected using a JEM-2100 (JEOL) electron microscope at 200 kV. An FEI Talos F200S microscope was applied for the measurement of high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and elemental mapping images at 200 kV. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were collected on a BEL SORP-MAX analyzer. Thermogravimetric (TG) profiles were recorded by using an STA 409 instrument. Jarrell-Ash 1100 inductively coupling plasma (ICP) spectrometer was performed to detect the metal contents. The analysis of the surface chemical state was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) performed on PHI 5000 Versa Probe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3 -TPD) curve was performed by CO chemisorption (pulse titration) on a Catalyst Analyzer BELCAT-B. The products were tested by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (Agilent 7920A/5975 Bruker Scion 436 GC-MS system).
3,Materials synthesis,"2.2 Materials synthesis Pd–Si-ZSM-22 zeolites were synthesized via dry gel conversion method. Typically, 7.4 g tetraethyl orthosilicate, 20 mg (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane, and 10 mg ammonium tetrachloropalladate (NH4)2PdCl4 were added in an aqueous H2SO4 solution (25.3 g, pH = 1.0). The resulting mixture was stirred (400 rpm) at room temperature for 24 h, with the subsequent inclusion of 2.73 g 1-Butyl-3methylimidazolium bromide ([BMIm]Br, >99 wt%) and an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (12.5 mol L−1, 1.50 g). The above mixture (molar composition: SiO2: [BMIm]Br: Na2O: Pd: MPTS: H2O = 1 : 0.35 : 0.2 : 0.001 : 0.0085 : 40) was continuously stirred (400 rpm) for 24 h at room temperature. Then the dry gel was prepared by additionally drying the mixture at 100 °C and then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave containing a raised Teflon holder with certain water in the bottom. After the crystallization at 170 °C for 3 d, the isolated solid was washed with water and dried to offer the as-synthesized sample. Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) was obtained after calcination at 500 °C in air for 5 h and reduction at 300 °C under a 10% H2–N2 flow [40 cm3(STP).min−1] for 4 h. Si-ZSM-22, a Pd-free counterpart, was synthesized following a similar procedure with the gel composition of 1 SiO2: 0.35 [BMIm]Br: 0.2 Na2O: 40 H2O and the temperature removal via calcination. Two control catalysts of Pd/ZSM-22 and Pd/SiO2 were synthesized through wetness impregnation by using Si-ZSM-22 and amorphous SiO2 as the support, respectively."
4,Hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol,"2.3 Hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol Typically, catalyst, FA, and isopropanol were added in a 25 mL stainless-steel autoclave in sequence. After that, the autoclave was purged with N2 and then H2, finally charged with 3 MPa H2. The reaction proceeded at 150 °C for the pre-set time. After the reaction, toluene was added into the liquid phase as the internal standard and the isolated solution containing the product was quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B) using flame ionization detector and equipped with a capillary column (HP-5, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). CFA = Mreacted/Minitial (C; Conversion, M: mmol). The stability of the catalyst was measured by a five-run recycling experiment. The used catalyst was collected after each run and put into the next cycle without any treatment."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Fabrication and structural information of Pd–Si-ZSM-22,"3.1 Fabrication and structural information of Pd–Si-ZSM-22 Scheme 1 displays the synthetic process of Pd–Si-ZSM-22. At the beginning, the influence of several basic synthesis parameters, including the pH value, temperature, and time in the crystallization step, were investigated by using a gel composition of 1 SiO2: 0.35 [BMIm]Br: 0.2 Na2O: 0.001 Pd: 0.0085 MPTS: 40 H2O. Fig. S1 plots the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized with varied pH values during the crystallization process. The strong diffraction peaks for TON topology were found at pH = 11.2, suggesting the formation of high crystalline ZSM-22 zeolite. By contrast, lower peak intensity and the existence of the quartz phase were observed in the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized via crystallization at either lower or higher pH values. This result indicates that the present synthesis was sensitive to the crystallization pH value. In the process of ZSM-22 synthesis, the Na2O–SiO2–H2O system is used to fabricate a basic crystallization environment, where the H2O/Na2O or OH−/Si molar ratio plays an important role. In general, higher alkalinity could promote higher solubility of Si source, along with the lower degree of silicate anion polymerization, and accelerates the polymerization of the polysilicate. According to this, the reasonable adjust of pH value is particularly important in the crystallization step, which could shorten the induction and nucleation periods and speed up the crystallization process [58,59]. It can be seen in Fig. S1 that when the crystallization pH value was adjusted from 10.9 to 11.2, the crystallinity of Pd–Si-ZSM-22 increased, indicating the alkalinity of the system effectively guides the transformation of the amorphous silica gel into an ordered crystal structure. Furthermore, when the pH value was increased to 11.3 or 11.4, the crystallinity slightly decreased, attributable to that the excess alkali metal ions in the reaction system inhibited the polycondensation reaction between silicates [60–62]. The crystallization kinetics was explored from 1 d to 5 d by setting the crystallization at 170 °C and a pH value of 11.2. The XRD patterns in Fig. S2 showed a gradual increase in the peak intensity within the initial three days, reflecting the enhanced crystallinity. Longer crystallization time caused the decline of the peak intensity, but still giving the pure TON topology. The reason is assignable to that TON zeolite is a metastable crystal, and thus too long crystallization time will cause some crystals to dissolve in an alkaline environment, leading to the decrease of the peak intensity [61,63] indicating that the crystallization time of 3 d was favorable for high crystallinity. The crystallization temperature was surveyed from 130 °C to 210 °C by using a crystallization time of 3 d (Fig. S3). TON topology appeared in all the temperature range, exhibiting the highest XRD peak intensity at 170 °C. Higher or lower crystallization temperature resulted in worse crystallinity or impurity of the quartz phase. By fixing the crystallization at pH = 11.2 and 170 °C for 3 d, we synthesized three Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(n) samples (n = 0, 8.5 and 17, indicative of the initial MPTS/Pd molar ratio in the gel), with the initial gel composition of 1 SiO2: 0.35 [BMIm]Br: 0.2 Na2O: 0.001 Pd: x MPTS: 40 H2O (x = 0, 0.0085 and 0.0170). The addition of MTPS, which contains two functional groups, ensures a bridge between the metal species and the process of zeolite crystallization, further promoting the formation of small particles encapsulated in the zeolite [64–67]. Otherwise, insufficient stabilization could be reached in the presence of low concentrated MTPS, while excess MPTS would hamper the crystallization process. Therefore, a moderate amount MPTS affords a balance to allow the encapsulation of Pd NPs into TON framework. For comparison, the synthesis of Pd-free sample Si-ZSM-22 was performed similarly with the gel composition of 1 SiO2: 0.35 [BMIm]Br: 0.2 Na2O: 40 H2O.The content of Pd among the Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(n) series was identical to the one in the gel, indicating the full integration of the Pd species into the TON topological matrix. Fig. 1 a–d presents the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images. The primary particles of Si-ZSM-22 are micron-size prisms with a smooth surface and closely packed to form secondary particles in tens of micrometers. Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) has almost the same morphology as that of Si-ZSM-22. Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(0) also exhibited similar morphology but with less regular primary particles, while Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(17) exhibited the morphology of highly fused primary particles with a spheroid shape that was not so angular as those of Si-ZSM-22, indicating that the presence of excessive MPTS hampered the crystallization of TON crystals. Fig. 1e–h displays the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and the elemental mapping images of the typical sample Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5), visualizing the high dispersion of Pd species throughout the ZSM-22 crystal. The formation and dispersion of Pd NPs of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(n) were reflected by the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and corresponding size dispersion diagrams (Fig. 1i–k). The average particle sizes were 8.7 nm, 3.1 nm, and 4.7 nm for Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(0), Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5), and Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(17), respectively. This result indicates that the presence of a moderate amount of MPTS favors the formation of small particles. Moreover, the particle size dispersion of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) is more uniform than those of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(0) and Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(17), further reflecting the stabilization effect of MPTS. The combination of SEM and TEM images proves that MPTS is advantageous for the formation of highly dispersive small Pd NPs, but excessive MPTS is harmful for the zeolite crystallization and dispersion of Pd species. Notably, there is no typical Pd diffraction pattern in the XRD patterns due to the relatively low Pd loading, in line with previous reports [68,69]. Fig. 2 a demonstrates the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Pd–Si-ZSM-22(n) series and Si-ZSM-22. Typical peaks for TON topology was observed in these XRD patterns and no impurity was found, indicating the formation of highly crystalline ZSM-22 zeolites after the inclusion of Pd species [28,44]. Besides, the synthesis by feeding more Pd precursor in the initial gel was carried out to offer two samples with Pd content of 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Both of them are pure TON topological zeolites with similar uniform Pd NPs dispersion and average size (3.3 nm and 3.5 nm for 0.3% and 0.5% Pd content, respectively) as that of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) (Fig. S4 and S5). Thereby, the Pd content of the Pd–Si-ZSM-22(n) series can be facilely adjusted by simply modulating the Pd content in the gel while keeping high crystallinity and homogeneous dispersion of relatively small Pd NPs. Fig. 2b shows the N2 sorption isotherms of these zeolites. High uptakes were as observed at the relative pressure (P/P0) below 0.1, reflecting a typical type I isotherms for microporous materials [45]. The property of micropores was analyzed by t-plot method (Table 1 ), showing that except for Pd/SiO2, the other samples exhibited microporous structure with a high proportion of micropores. The related textual properties listed in Table 1 show the surface area of 217–247 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.081–0.086 cm3 g−1, respectively. Notably, the Pd containing ZSM-22 zeolites have almost similar pore information to that of Si-ZSM-22. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Pd–Si-ZSM-22(n) series were recorded to analyze the surface chemical state of the Pd–Si-ZSM-22(n) series. As shown in Fig. S6, the survey scan XPS spectra showed strong peaks at 103.8 eV and 531.5 eV for Si 2p and O 1s, respectively [46,47], as well as showed weak signal for Pd 3d at 337.1 eV. The high-resolution Pd 3d XPS spectra in Fig. 2c were fitted with two sets of doublet peaks. The peaks at lower binding energies of 335.22 eV and 340.48 eV are assignable to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 of metallic Pd (0) species, while the small ones at higher binding energies of 337.09 eV and 342.35 eV are Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 of Pd (II) species, suggesting the formation of slight oxidative Pd species. Fig. S7 is the NH3-TPD analysis diagram. The peak at 123 °C is attributable to the weak acid sites derived from the surface silanol groups. Fig. 2d displays TG curves of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-as and Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5). The initial weight loss below 200 °C comes from the physically adsorbed water and Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-as exhibited lower weight loss in this temperature range due to the filling of organic template in the as-made sample that resists the water adsorption. The weight loss of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) in the temperature region of 200–420 °C is assignable to the desorption of water in the internal pores [29]. The apparent weight loss above 420 °C of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-as was the decomposition of organic template, while negligible weight loss was observed over Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) in this temperate range, reflecting the high thermal stability of TON skeleton. Moreover, the sample Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-550 was prepared by calcining the as-made sample at 550 °C to remove the template and then reduced at 300 °C. Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-550 demonstrated the identical XRD pattern plus similar dispersion and average particle size of Pd NPs to those of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) (Fig. S8 and S9). Generally, the Pd nanoparticles on the surface of zeolite is easy to migrate at high temperature [51], while the existence of Pd inside the zeolite crystals is difficult to aggregate into larger metal particles due to the unique confining effect of the zeolite framework, indicating the thermally stable structure. Therefore, the sintering resistance test was carried out and the stability of Pd NPs proved indirectly the existence of Pd inside the zeolite crystals. The average Pd particle size is around 3–4 nm, which has exceeded the size of the TON α-cage, indicating that the metal is fixed in the rigid zeolite framework. Meanwhile, the XRD patterns show that the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the TON topological structure has not changed, indicating that the amount and degree of this damage are extremely small. Based on this, this phenomenon also could indirectly prove that the particles are encapsulated inside the zeolite and protected by the zeolite cage and the outer crystal surface, which prevent the migration of the small Pd particles [70]."
7,Hydrogenation of FA into THFA,"3.2 Hydrogenation of FA into THFA The catalytic performance of the above Pd–Si-ZSM-22 series was evaluated in the hydrogenation of FA into THFA [43]. For comparison, two control samples of Pd supported catalysts were synthesized by post-immobilization of Pd NPs on ZSM-22 and SiO2, respectively and Fig. S10−S14 presents the corresponding structure information. The average particle sizes of Pd NPs for Pd/ZSM-22 and Pd/SiO2 are 5.1 nm and 5.4 nm, respectively, which are measured by high-resolution TEM (Fig. S13). Notably, Pd/SiO2 was applied as a traditional counterpart of Pd/ZSM-22 and Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5), with the same elemental composition but different porosity and Pd NPs. In order to realize the selective hydrogenation of FA, a series of prepared Pd catalysts were screened, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 a. For a typical experiment, 0.5 mmol of FA (0.17 M in isopropyl) was reacted in the presence of 0.1 g of each catalyst with 3 MPa H2 at 150 °C for 24 h. The performance of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(0) gave us only a 5% yield of THFA with 23% conversion of FA, which is probably due to the relatively large Pd particle size (8.7 nm), further resulting in poor exposure of the active sites. On the contrary, with the addition of MPTS during the catalyst preparation, especially when the initial MPTS/Pd molar ratio was 8.5, the catalyst of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) could effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of FA into THFA, affording a favorable yield of 98% that greatly exceeds those over Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(17) (18%). In the case of the supported Pd/ZSM-22 and Pd/SiO2, the conversion of FA reached almost 100% but the yield of THFA was formed with only 38% and 16%, respectively. Also, the turnover number (TON) of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) could reach 521 based on the total Pd species, higher than twice or six times of Pd/ZSM-22 (202) and Pd/SiO2 (85), respectively (Table S1). Compared with Pd/ZSM-22 and Pd/SiO2, Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) has smaller Pd NPs, so its metal dispersion is up to 43%. In general, small Pd NPs possess abundant surface coordination unsaturated Pd species with high surface energy, benefiting the activation of the FA. Further, the existence of abundant negative charge over small Pd NPs could lead to changes in adsorption properties for the molecules sensitive to the electronic density of the metal, making them less favorable for adsorption of the electron-rich THFA and accelerates the desorption to enhance the corresponding selectivity [71–73]. From this viewpoint, we rationally speculate that the design of zeolite encapsulated Pd NPs with highly dispersive small particles is advantageous to further enhance the activity [9,41]. To prove the existence of Pd inside the zeolite crystals, the sample was treated with 1 wt% sodium hydroxide solution to obtain Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-NaOH. The characterization of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-NaOH is shown in Fig. S15 and Fig. S16. It can be seen from SEM images that there are amorphous dry gel fragments in the sample, indicating that the zeolite crystals have been partially destroyed. The XRD pattern shows a typical diffraction peak of the TON topology. Compared with Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5), Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-NaOH has a relatively large specific surface area and pore volume, indicating that after NaOH solution treatment, there is a small amount of mesoporous generate. The Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5)-NaOH gives 45% selectivity of THFA in FA hydrogenation reaction, compared with 99% selectivity of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) (Table S2). This result proves that the selectivity of FA hydrogenation reaction is controlled by the limitation of zeolite micropores, also, the existence of Pd inside the zeolite crystals [74]. Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) catalyzed conversion of 2-methylfuran gave 98.5% yield of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. Considering that 2-methylfuran has a smaller molecular size than 2-methylfuran, it is reasonably believed that it can access all Pd NPs. The above comparison provides certain indirect evidence that all Pd NPs were accessible in the conversion of FA into THFA. Multiple reaction parameters, including the reaction time, temperature, and H2 pressure, were then screened in the Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) catalyzed hydrogenation of FA into THFA (Fig. 3b–d). Fig. 3b shows the conversion of FA and the yield of THFA as a function of reaction time. The FA conversion was 30% after 1 h and gradually increased with elongating reaction time, holding a yield above 98% at 24 h. Further elongating of the reaction time caused the formation of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran-2-ol as a by-product that led to the decrease of the yield of THFA. When the reaction time was fixed at 24 h, the influence of the reaction temperature was explored from 100 °C to 170 °C (Fig. 3c). The yield was only 52% at 110 °C and continuously increased to >98% at 150 °C, and then gradually decreased at the higher temperature. Similarly, inferior activity was found at low H2 pressure (Fig. 3d). The increase of H2 pressure from 2 to 3 MPa led to a linear increase of THFA yield, revealing the first-order regulation. The excessive amount of H2 did not have any influence on the maximum yield of THFA and kept an almost constant 99% yield. Therefore, a suitable reaction condition for Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) catalyzed hydrogenation of FA into THFA was 150 °C, 24 h, 3 MPa H2. Feeding a double amount of FA (1 mmol) and slightly increasing the reaction time to 30 h gave a THFA yield of 91% and a much larger TON of 968 based on the total Pd atoms. Reducing the catalyst dosage along with increasing the FA feeding to 2 mmol led to an unprecedented TON value of 1447 under a considerable yield of 34% in 50 h (Table S3, entries 2 and 5). The recycling performance was also investigated in a five-run test (Fig. 4 a). After each cycle, the catalyst Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) can be facilely recovered by filtration. The yield over the spent Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) in the 5th run was almost the same as the fresh catalyst, exhibiting excellent recyclability. By contrast, an apparent decline of the yield was observed over the spent Pd/ZSM-22 in the 2nd run, as demonstrated in Fig. S17. This comparison highlights the stability of encapsulated Pd species within the TON crystals. The structure of spent Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) was systematically characterized. After five-run, the particle size of Pd NPs is 3.6 nm, which has exceeded the size of the TON α-cage, indicating that the zeolite framework is locally damaged. But compared to the fresh one, the spent Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) demonstrated almost identical XRD pattern, morphology, textural properties, surface chemical stage, dispersion, and average particle size of Pd NPs (Fig. 4b–f), indicating that the amount and degree of this damage are extremely small. Based on this, this phenomenon could indirectly prove that the particles are encapsulated inside the zeolite and protected by the zeolite cage and the outer crystal surface, which prevent the migration of the small Pd particles [70]. After the reaction, the filtrate was analyzed by ICP, showing that the potential leached Pd species is below the detection limit. Hot filtration experiment was performed and no further formation of THFA was observed, excluding the potential leaching of Pd species that contributes to the activity. All of these preserved structure information is responsive to the satisfied recyclability of Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5). Table S4 lists the activity and reusability of previous efficient heterogeneous catalysts in the hydrogenation of FA into THFA with H2 and the corresponding reaction conditions [36,41,48,49]. Though directly comparing present Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) with those catalysts is difficult because of the varied reaction conditions (e.g., catalyst dosage, substrate amount, solvent, pressure, temperature, etc.), a reasonable comparison is attempted by comprehensively considering the yield, selectivity, TON, TOF, and stability under similar reaction conditions. Compared with previous heterogeneous catalysts, Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) represented a higher or at least comparable yield and selectivity, and afforded greatly higher TON, (e.g., 968 at a high yield of 91% and 1447 with a considerable yield of 34% at large FA/Pd ratio). Turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated and added into Table S3 and S4. The results indicated that Pd–Si-ZSM-22(8.5) still exhibited high TOF relative to previous catalysts (Table S4). Apparent deactivation during the recycling test was normally found in many previous heterogeneous catalytic systems, while the spent Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) after recycling several times still demonstrated almost the same activity as that of the fresh one. The comparison in terms of yield, TON, TOF, and recycling performance above indicates that Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) in this work serves as the effective and stable heterogeneous catalyst for the hydrogenation of FA into THFA. Catalytic conversion of FA into THFA usually involves multiple tandem reactions including hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bond of furan group, hydrogenolysis, ring open, ring hydrolysis, decarbonylation [3,4,8], etc. Thereby, the selective production of THFA requires an effective catalyst to seek for activity-selectivity trade-off. Generally, the Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(n) series contains the combined advantages of stabilized noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), regular microporous channels, and internal properties of zeolite including high thermal/hydrothermal stability, variable structures, and chemical compositions. In this work, the construction of ZSM-22 encapsulated Pd NPs expressed not only the constant stability but also the enhancement of the activity and selectivity. In detail, the encapsulated Pd nanoparticles in the ZSM-22 crystals, which are larger than the micropores, exhibit improved metal sinter resistance compared with the supported species by the electrostatic interaction and rigid zeolite framework. For the Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(8.5) catalyzed FA into THFA, the catalyst can still maintain more than 95% selectivity after five-run. In the catalytic process, the Pd NPs size and dispersion usually play a dominant role in the selective synthesis of THFA. From this viewpoint, three typical samples with average particle size 3.1 nm, 4,7 nm, and 8.7 nm were constructed through the addition of a different amount of bifunctional organic ligand (MPTS). For the Pd–Si-ZSM-22-(n) series, the well dispersive small Pd particles (3.7 nm) showed the highly active sites, as demonstrated by the activity comparison in Table 1 and Fig. 3. Moreover, because of the location of Pd active species crossing several microchannels of zeolite crystals, the diffusion, adsorption, and desorption of the reactant, intermediates, and product is closely related to the zeolite pore configuration and thus significantly affect the selectivity and activity of a large degree in many cases. This consideration is verified by the comparisons that supported Pd catalysts (Pd/ZSM-22, Pd/SiO2) exhibit pretty poor performance with only 38% and 16% yield of THFA. Based on the previous report [74], it can be explained that FA trends to be localized on the Pd sites by adsorption in zeolite micropores, thus leading to effective hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds until to form THFA to diffuse outside the pores."
8,Conclusions,"Highly dispersive Pd NPs were directly encapsulated into the pure silica TON type zeolite via a dry gel conversion route. Thiol tethered silylating agent was utilized as the ligand to stabilize the Pd species and its feeding dosage was found to significantly affect the particle size and dispersion. High dispersion of small Pd NPs was reached with the moderate concentration of thiol ligand. The constructed Pd–Si-ZSM-22 catalyst has high crystallinity and large surface area, and their Pd loading was facilely adjusted by changing the starting Pd content. The catalyst was highly effective in the hydrogenation of FA to THFA, providing a high yield associating with a record-high TON plus stable recycling performance. The confinement of small Pd NPs within the TON matrix is responsive to this stably high catalytic performance."
