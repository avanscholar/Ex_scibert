0,Introduction,"The use of hydrogen gas (H2) as an energy storage solution is an interesting and important option since, its direct combustion does not generate pollutants or greenhouse gases [1]. So far, the most common approach for hydrogen production is steam reforming using fossil fuels, mainly methane. However, this process requires high temperatures and pressures. Alternative energy-efficient technologies are required to ensure that the energy consumption demanded by an industrialized country can be met without harmful effects to the environment. Much work and effort is being invested in the development of technologies capable of producing hydrogen from renewable sources (principally wind and solar) [2,3]. Another option that is being investigated is heterogeneous photocatalysis [4], one of the so-called Advanced Oxidation Processes. While heterogeneous photocatalysis has mainly been studied and developed for use in liquid and gaseous effluent purification [5,6], its practical application in hydrogen production is a challenge that remains in the research and development stage [7]. The main obstacle lies in the low efficiency of the photosplitting of pure water into H2 and O2 gases components. One way of increasing efficiency is through the addition of sacrificial agents that are organic compounds that are easily oxidized photocatalytically and so they act as hole (h+) scavengers in the photocatalysis process. These sacrificial agents favor the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, increasing charge lifetimes and enabling the migration of electrons to the photocatalyst surface for the reduction of water to hydrogen gas. Many of these sacrificial agents constitute a significant proportion of the chemical composition of industrial waste, or are by-products of the agrochemical and agro-food industries. Consequently, this technology could be used for the controlled transformation of otherwise potential environmentally harmful waste into an energy carrier. An extensive number of organic compounds have been tested, with the best results apparently being obtained with C1C3 alcohols in water–alcohol mixtures [8–15]. Among these, methanol has provided the highest rates of H2 gas and it is considered a model molecule in hydrogen production [16–21]. In addition to its chemical stability, low cost and low toxicity, the high photoreactivity of TiO2 makes it an ideal photocatalyst for this purpose [22]. The deposition of metal particles, particularly platinum (Pt), considerably enhances its photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production [17,23]. In this case, separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs is favored as the metal particles deposited on the photocatalyst surface act as efficient traps for the photogenerated electrons. A detailed study is undertaken in the present work of the photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production of Kronos vlp7000 (henceforth, KR) photocatalyst with a photodeposited surface Pt-loading of 2.1wt% (henceforth, Pt-KR). This photocatalyst was chosen in view of results obtained in previous studies [24,25] in which it was compared with other commercial and non-commercial photocatalysts and showed one of the highest activities both in its bare and Pt-modified state. The aim of the present study is to consider its photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production in greater detail through an analysis and optimization of different variables including photocatalyst loading, initial suspension pH value and the nature and concentration of the sacrificial agent used. Not only methanol is used, but also other sacrificial agents such as ethanol that can be produced from biomass [26], and ethylene glycol and glycerol that are present in difficult-to-treat waste materials including vehicle coolants and biodiesel production by-products [27]. The reuse capacity of the photocatalyst is also tested as well as its activity under solar radiation."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and materials,"2.1 Reagents and materials The commercial photocatalysts used in this study were Kronos vlp7000 (Patent US2005/0226761A1) supplied by Kronos Worldwide, Inc. and TiO2 Aeroxide P25 (47.2±0.1m2 g−1, 79%/21% anatase/rutile) supplied by Evonik. The reagents methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol with 99, 99.5 and 99% purity, respectively, were supplied by Panreac and the glycerol reagent by Sigma–Aldrich (99.5% purity). The pH was adjusted using NaOH (≥97%, Sigma–Aldrich) and H2SO4 (96%, Panreac). All the solutions were made using ultrapure Milli-Q water (Millipore Corporation)."
3,Photodeposition of Pt metal particles,"2.2 Photodeposition of Pt metal particles The Kronos vlp7000 photocatalyst was subjected to a photodeposition process of Pt metal particles from hexachloroplatinic acid (IV) (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Merck 40% Pt), following a modified method from the literature [28]. 2g of catalyst were introduced in 400mL of a 0.3M solution of isopropanol, together with H2PtCl6·6H2O, in order to obtain a Pt loading of 2.1wt% on the catalyst surface. This metal loading was established as the appropriate amount for the optimum performance of the Kronos sample [25]. The photodeposition was carried out in a commercial photoreactor (Photochemical Reactors Ltd.), equipped with a medium-pressure mercury lamp (400W). The lamp was inserted into a quartz immersion well. The system was kept at constant temperature (25°C) in a thermostatic bath. The illumination was maintained for 6h under continuous N2 gas flow and strong stirring conditions. The recovery of the sample was performed by filtration and it was washed and dried overnight in an oven at 110°C."
4,Photocatalytic test,"2.3 Photocatalytic test The method employed for H2 gas generation comprised the introduction into a borosilicate reactor of 75mL photocatalyst suspension with a predetermined concentration of a sacrificial agent, pH adjustment and continuous stirring at 500rpm. Three Philips HB175 lamps were used as illumination source, each with four 15W CLEO fluorescent tubes (9mWcm−2; λ =300–400nm, λ max =365nm), placed 15cm from the reactor. Spectra and irradiance measurements were recorded using an Ocean Optics HR2000+spectrometer. The system was operated at ambient temperature and pressure (approx. 25°C and 1atm). A reactor of larger capacity with 180mL of the catalyst suspension (1gL−1) was used for the solar radiation tests and was placed on the roof of the university building where the research group of the present study is based (28° 04′ 49.13″N; 15° 27′ 9.04″W). The suspension was continuously recirculated at 1200mLmin−1 using a Selecta Percom N-M peristaltic pump. The photoreactor was inclined at a tilt angle equivalent to the latitude angle of the location (28°) so that the direction of radiation incidence would be as perpendicular as possible and was oriented south. A dihedral mirror reflector was used to maximize solar radiation exploitation. Instantaneous and accumulated solar energy was measured with an Acadus 85-PLS (Ecosystem S.A.) radiometer with a response range between 290 and 370nm. In both, outdoor and indoor experiments, the monitoring of H2 gas and gaseous intermediates was performed using a 490Agilent MicroGC gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with injection valve, a Molsieve 5A column and TCD detector. The Molsieve 5A column also allowed analysis of carbon monoxide. The device also includes a PoraPlot Q column enabling monitoring of carbon dioxide, methane and ethane. A constant flow of He (10mLmin−1) was maintained using a mass flow controller (EL-FLOW Bronkhorst HI-TECH) through the reactor headspace, which directed the generated H2 gas into the chromatograph. The chromatogram areas were converted to hydrogen flow using a calibration performed beforehand under the same test conditions. Formaldehyde concentration in liquid phase was quantified by a spectrophotometric method [29] using a Heλios spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Formic acid and acetic acid were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Varian Prostar system with a diode array UV–vis detector (Supelcogel column C-610H, H3PO4 1vol.% of phosphoric acid in water, 1mLmin−1, 25°C). Acetaldehyde was analyzed using a Shimadzu GC2010 Plus chromatograph fitted with a CP-WAX 52CB column (0.25mm×30m) and an FID detector. The pH was measured and adjusted with a Crison Basic20 pH-meter."
5,Characterization techniques,"2.4 Characterization techniques XRD patterns were recorded on a Siemens D-501 diffractometer equipped with a Ni filter and graphite monochromator using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5418Å) to determine phase composition of the samples. Crystal sizes were estimated from line broadening of the corresponding X-ray diffraction peaks by using the Scherrer equation. Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded for all samples on a Varian Cary 5 and the Kubelka–Munk function, F(R∞), was applied to obtain band-gap energies following the method proposed by Tandon and Gupta [30]. BET surface area, pore volume and pore size measurements were carried out by N2 adsorption at 77K using a Micromeritics 2010 instrument. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 microscope. The morphology of the samples was studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) using a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope combined with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the kronos TiO2-based materials,"3.1 Characterization of the kronos TiO2-based materials The Kronos vlp7000 (KR) is a pure anatase TiO2 catalyst with a large surface area (258.60m2 g−1), as inferred from the small particle size observed from microscopy analysis (Fig. 1 ). As discussed in previous studies [25], the photodeposition of Pt metal particles (Pt-KR) had an impact on the catalyst surface, resulting in a slight increase in particle size and pore volume and even, in large-size aggregates in aqueous suspension which do not appear in pure TiO2 photocatalyst. The size of these platinum particles has been estimated from HR-TEM images obtaining values around 3.5–4nm, although Pt aggregates of larger size were clearly observed. The relevant characteristics of both KR and Pt-KR (2.1wt% Pt) samples are compared in Table 1 [24,25]. According to the diffuse reflectance spectrum (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1), the presence of Pt particles also resulted in increased catalyst radiation absorption in the visible range. Nonetheless, no modification can be observed of the crystalline structure (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S2) or of the energy threshold for photoactivity."
8,Hydrogen production,"3.2 Hydrogen production The photogeneration of H2 gas was carried out using a range of hole (h+) scavengers and the efficiency of the systems is discussed in the following subsections. 3.2.1 Methanol as sacrificial agent Hydrogen production in this study is considered for a wide range of methanol concentrations, including at 100% v/v (24.47M). Fig. 2 A represents the mean values of H2 flow (μmolh−1) after a steady production rate has been obtained. As reported by other authors, hydrogen flow rises to a maximum rate at which it remains stable until beginning to fall upon depletion of the sacrificial agent or deactivation of the catalyst [31] (Fig. 2B). Maximum production was attained after approximately 60min of the 3.5h duration of the test and remained more or less stable for the remaining time, even for the 100% v/v methanol concentration. It can be seen that hydrogen production increased with methanol concentration up to 7.34M where the rate was 1665μmolh−1. With a 100% v/v concentration of sacrificial agent it can be seen that hydrogen flow is even lower than for the lowest tested initial methanol concentration of 1.22M. The main by-products of methanol photoreforming are formaldehyde, formic acid and CO2. Other intermediates, such as methane, methyl formate, acetaldehyde and dimethyl ether as well as traces of ethane, have been found in methanol photoreforming reactions, [17] however these were found insignificant in the overall process. The amounts of both formaldehyde and formic acid increased with methanol concentration up to 6.12 and 9.79M, respectively (Fig. 2A). Beyond these concentrations, the formation of formaldehyde remained constant whilst the concentration of formic acid suddenly decreased. However, this trend was not maintained for 100% v/v methanol concentration (24.47M) and the concentration of both intermediates increased markedly. The build-up of formaldehyde at 100% v/v is due to the fact that its subsequent oxidation into formic acid is strongly inhibited in the absence of water [32]. Fig. 3 A shows how the CO2 flow rates increased over time for all methanol concentrations except for the 100% v/v, where it reached a steady rate of production. It can also be seen how CO2 flow rates fall as initial methanol concentration rises. The mineralization rate for 100% v/v methanol is very low, as inferred from the accumulation of formaldehyde observed in Fig. 2A. Furthermore, traces of methane were also detected (Fig. 3B), the formation of which is competitive and detrimental to hydrogen production as all the hydrogen atoms available in the initial methanol will not result in the formation of hydrogen. The influence of pH and catalyst loading was studied while maintaining a constant methanol concentration of 25% (v/v). As it can be seen in Fig. 4 A, an optimum production of H2 gas was found under slightly acidic and neutral pH conditions, whilst the H2 rates decreased significantly at strongly acidic or alkaline pH values. This is in agreement with previous literature reports and it is a common observation for a range of alcohols, including ethanol and ethylene glycol [33–35]. This behavior is expected for all the alcohols considered in this work since their acidity constants are very similar (pKa methanol =15.5, pKa ethanol =15.9, pKa ethyleneglycol =14.22 and pKa glycerol =14.2). The concentration of formaldehyde ranged between 65 and 80mM, following the same trend as the H2 rates. However, the concentrations of formic acid were much lower (<1.50mM) and the trend increased with increasing pH, as expected, since its formation is inhibited in acid conditions [35]. The CO2 flow rates (results not shown) for 3.5h had the following order for the different pH values: pH 5 (17.35μmolh−1) >pH 7 (6.37μmolh−1) >pH 3 (5.00μmolh−1) >pH 9 (2.44μmolh−1) with higher initial induction periods for pH 9 and pH 3 of 135min. This is in accordance with hydrogen flow rates and reported formaldehyde and formic acid concentrations. Specifically at pH 9 it was expected that the formic acid accumulation (in formate form) resulted in low mineralization and at pH 3 the low CO2 flow is well related to the lower hydrogen production rate and to the inhibition of the formation of formic acid in acidic conditions. Little variation in hydrogen production was observed for different catalyst loadings (0.5–2.0gL−1) (Fig. 4B), ranging between 1396 and 1558μmolh−1. A slight increase in hydrogen production can be observed up to a catalyst loading of 1.5gL−1. At higher loading, the rate decreased likely due to catalyst particle aggregation, with reduction of active surface area, and to radiation scattering, which impedes transmission of the radiation throughout the photoreactor and therefore impedes the radiation from reaching the active centers of the catalyst particles [36–38]. Formic acid and formaldehyde concentrations also decreased with an increase in catalyst loading above 1gL−1. The effect of catalyst loading on the activity is in agreement with that reported in the literature and the optimum loading is found within the range considered in the present study [39,40]. 3.2.2 Ethanol as sacrificial agent Fig. 5 A represents hydrogen flow as a function of initial ethanol concentration and the concentrations of the main intermediates of ethanol photoreforming, acetaldehyde and acetic acid. It can be seen how the hydrogen production increased to an initial ethanol concentration of 4.89M where it reached a flow rate of 1378μmolh−1. This flow rate is comparable to that obtained when using similar concentrations of methanol (<4.89M) (Fig. 2A). The H2 rates from ethanol at low concentrations can be relatively high compared to those from methanol solutions [18,32]. An indirect oxidation mechanism via hydroxyl radicals prevails at low concentrations of alcohol [41], reducing the difference in H2 production between methanol and ethanol solutions. However, high alcohol concentrations involve direct oxidation mechanisms and methanol is a better hole scavenger [42], which explains why the H2 rates increased upon increasing concentrations of methanol whilst it remained constant for ethanol concentrations between 4.89 and 7.34M (Fig. 5A). At higher concentrations (>7.34M), the H2 rate dropped drastically for methanol and a surprisingly high rate was found in saturated ethanol solution (1252μmolh−1) compared to the equivalent methanol system (822μmolh−1). The high efficiency of Pt-KR with saturated ethanol solutions will need further investigation, however, so far, preliminary tests up to 24h (not shown) have confirmed these result whilst other catalysts undergo important deactivation within 3.5h in this study [32]. The concentration of acetaldehyde in the suspension was between 24M and 61mM, varying with the same tendency as hydrogen flow, while the concentration of acetic acid generally decreased (from 3mM to 0.5mM) as the initial ethanol concentration increased. At the same time, as it happened in the case of methanol, in general the CO2 levels drop upon increasing concentration of alcohol (Fig. 5B). However, in this case, there is significant mineralization with 100% v/v ethanol, which is in accordance with the high rate of hydrogen production observed for this concentration and the low concentrations of intermediates when compared with the initial ethanol concentration of 1.22M. It is important to note that, whereas neither methane nor ethane were found for the corresponding pure alcohol solutions (100% v/v), they were detected in the diluted systems (Fig. 6 ). The formation of these two sub-products would appear to be related to the presence of water. In the case of the ethanol-containing solutions, the production of methane was favored at low initial ethanol concentrations whereas the ethane levels were high at high ethanol concentrations. The flows of these by-products are rather significant when using ethanol as sacrificial agent, and in the case of methane they are even higher than those of CO2 gas. These two gaseous intermediates, methane and ethane, are not commonly investigated in the literature, with the exception of Bamwenda et al. [33]. These authors detected methane, although not quantified, and explained its formation based on the decarboxylation of acetic acid or hydrogenation of CO2. Both methane and ethane were detected and quantified in a previous publication in our group [32] and they have been confirmed here. Ethane could be formed from the combination of two methyl radicals generated as a result of acetic acid decarboxylation [43]. As a result of the presence of these by-products the mineralization rates observed for ethanol are much lower than for methanol. Ethanol appears to lose efficiency in hydrogen production due to the formation of these intermediates. Higher hydrogen production rates have accordingly always been reported in the literature for methanol [18,19], though only justified as a consequence of the size of the alcohol chain and so to steric problems hindering approach to the catalyst surface and not to the generation of photoreduction by-products as it is evidenced here. Furthermore, these alkanes seem to form significantly from those alcohols where not all carbon atoms are linked to hydroxyl groups [44]. 3.2.3 Ethylene glycol as sacrificial agent Contrary to the observations described for methanol and ethanol solutions (vide supra), no steady rate of hydrogen flow was reached when using ethylene glycol as sacrificial agent, with the flow rate beginning to slowly descend after reaching a maximum value (Fig. 2B). Fig. 7 A represents maximum flow rates as a function of initial concentration of ethylene glycol and absolute hydrogen production and formaldehyde and formic acid concentrations after 3.5h. It can be seen how hydrogen production falls as ethylene glycol concentration rises, with the same trend observed for the intermediates. Unfortunately, photoreforming studies using ethylene glycol are lacking in the literature. Bamwenda et al. [34] quantified CO2 and detected traces of methane from ethylene glycol solutions. In the current work, the presence of both formaldehyde and formic acid could be confirmed and quantified, in agreement with our previous publication [32]. It was interesting to observe that the maximum flow rate (1347μmolh−1) was higher than the flow rates recorded from methanol and ethanol for the same concentration. When comparing ethylene glycol with ethanol, both of which are two-carbon alcohols, it appears that the effect descripted by Fu et al. [44] about the enhancement of the efficiency of the process due to the presence of more OH groups is only decisive for low concentrations. Of the gaseous intermediates, CO2 flow rates dropped drastically upon increasing alcohol concentration (Fig. 7B) and traces of methane were only found for the lowest concentrations of ethylene glycol. This is again evidence of the fundamental role of water in the formation of alkanes (vide supra). 3.2.4 Glycerol as sacrificial agent The maximum H2 flow rate in glycerol-containing solutions (Fig. 8 A) was almost as high (1300μmolh−1) as that recorded from ethylene glycol systems. However, contrary to the latter, a steady rate of hydrogen flow was reached when using glycerol as sacrificial agent. Hydrogen flow rate remained stable in a wide range of glycerol concentrations (up to 8.53M), after which it decreases. The 100% v/v concentration was not tested in the case of glycerol given the extremely high viscosity of this substance. As glycerol is a more complex alcohol, a large number of intermediates can be formed, among these acetic acid, methanol, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, acetol, acetaldehyde, ethanol, glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, acetone and acrolein have been reported in the literature [45]. Using the methodologies employed in the present study, formaldehyde and formic acid were detected in the liquid phase. These intermediates decreased upon increasing concentrations of glycerol (Fig. 8A) and they would originate from methanol, following the mechanism reported by Panagiotopoulou et al. [45]. As for the gaseous intermediates, traces of methane could be detected in all the solutions and the CO2 flow rates were as high as those observed from methanol and ethylene glycol systems (Fig. 8B). 3.2.5 Catalyst reuse The Pt-KR catalyst was subjected to various reuse cycles in order to evaluate its ability to maintain its photocatalytic performance in continuous use (Fig. 9 ). A low sacrificial agent load (0.011M), either methanol, ethylene glycol or glycerol, was used in the cycles so that the H2 flow rate would reach a zero value within reasonable time periods. For such small concentrations, the production patterns reached a maximum value and dropped immediately without maintaining a steady flow rate. A stable production (around 2200–2300μmol.) from one cycle to the next can be seen in the case of methanol, with a cycle time of 15h. These results were comparable to those obtained for another reference commercial photocatalyst, AeroxideTiO2 P25, modified with photodeposited platinum particles (2.1wt% Pt, Pt-P25) under the same conditions [32]. However, if we compare the Pt-KR results using ethylene glycol and glycerol with those for the Pt-P25 catalyst (Fig. 10 ), the Pt-KR clearly performs better. Using ethylene glycol as sacrificial agent the cycles with the Pt-KR photocatalyst are 20h long whereas with the Pt-P25 some 45h or more of illumination are required for the flow rate to fall below 5μmolh−1. Of the three sacrificial agents, glycerol required the most time for its complete elimination. This concurs with the observations of Panagiotopoulou et al. [45] who reported that more than 300 h were required to eliminate the glycerol contained in 60mL of a 20mM glycerol solution. The activity of the Pt-P25 photocatalyst decreased from one cycle to the next as it required longer time periods in each successive cycle to reach the same absolute production (from 62h in the first cycle to more than 140h in the third). In contrast, the cycles using the Pt-KR photocatalyst displayed more reproducibility in terms of activity with cycle times of around 30h. This has been explained in terms of specific surface area, which is 5 times larger in Pt-KR (280m2 g−1) compared to Pt-P25 (49.2m2 g−1), and thus the former would be less affected by active center blockage from the adsorption of organic intermediates during degradation mechanism of the more complex alcohols. Likewise, a catalyst with small surface area studied in a previous publication [32], SG750-2.1wt% Pt (18m2 g−1), showed rather poor efficiency compared to Pt-P25 using these sacrificial agents. The hydrogen production rates reported from the degradation of organic compounds in the literature are typically explained based on the photoreforming of the sacrificial agent only [17,46–48], which give us the following equations: (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → 3 H 2 + CO 2 (2) C 2 H 6 O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 5 H 2 + 2 CO 2 (3) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 7 H 2 + 3 CO 2 The amounts of hydrogen and carbon dioxide obtained from methanol and ethylene glycol solutions containing the Pt-KR photocatalyst, were those expected from a stoichiometric basis. However, glycerol did not reach full mineralization, despite de long reaction times used, and the H2 rates obtained represented the 85% of the total balance. 3.2.6 Solar photoactivity Preliminary tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of the Pt-KR catalyst for hydrogen production under solar irradiation conditions. These tests were carried out using a concentration of 1gL−1 of Pt-KR catalyst, pH natural conditions and a concentration of 7.34M of the corresponding sacrificial agent. The H2 flow rates were represented as a function of accumulated energy (Fig. 11 A) and as a function of time (Fig. 11B) until a total accumulated energy of 44.7W hm−2 was reached. In the solar tests, the highest absolute production was determined for glycerol-containing dispersions (4183.87μmol), closely followed by those containing methanol (3428.7μmol) and those with ethanol lagging some way behind (1029.4μmol). These absolute rates were estimated from the areas under the curves in Fig. 11B and did not follow the trends observed in the laboratory experiments using artificial light (vide supra). This difference was attributed to the variable nature of solar irradiance. The solar tests were carried out on different days over the same week with considerable variation in instantaneous energy, which was clearly a critical factor in the hydrogen production rates (Supplementary Information Fig. S3). During the experiments using methanol, the instantaneous energy values remained generally high and only 4.5h were required to reach the 44.7Whm−2 value. However, there was only one period of intense solar radiation for the experiments with ethanol and 7.3h were required to reach the same accumulated energy. While glycerol was not the best sacrificial agent according to the results of the laboratory tests, the hydrogen production under solar radiation was almost the same as that obtained in the lab tests though requiring a longer time period (6h as opposed to 3.5h). The values were also low since only 3–5% of the total solar emission is within the UV range. In terms of irradiance, this means that even under optimum solar radiation conditions, the outside irradiance levels were 6 times below those provided by the lamps in the laboratory. Based on tests using solar simulators, Chowdhury et al. [36] reported that the hydrogen production dependency with irradiance was linear in the range 30–100mWcm−2. These energies however would have to be obtained with concentrators since 100mWcm−2 is the maximum irradiance of solar radiation that reaches the surface of the planet [49]. Studies by Bowker et al. [50] reported mean production rates of 0.3mLh−1 at latitude N 51° 35′ over a 6h period of a sunny day in June whereas the rates reported in the present study ranged between 5.5–18mLh−1, in Gran Canaria (N 28° 4′). The results obtained with solar radiation are encouraging and optimization of the reaction variables (pH, photocatalyst loading…), reactor design and radiation collection would further improve the results, especially if efficient catalysts were available to capture a wider solar radiation spectrum."
9,Conclusions,"The H2 production was notably influenced by the pH conditions, with the best results obtained for slightly acidic and neutral pH values. Optimum catalyst loading for the system under study was determined as 1.5gL−1, though its influence was less important than that of pH conditions. From the maximum rates obtained, it could be concluded that methanol was the most convenient sacrificial agent (1665μmolh−1 at 7.34M), followed by ethanol (1378μmolh−1 at 4.89M), ethylene glycol (1347μmolh−1 at 1.22M) and glycerol (1300μmolh−1 a 1.22M-8.51M) with similar H2 rates. The total H2 production obtained from photoreforming of methanol and ethylene glycol at low concentration (0.011M) are those expected from reaction stoichoimetry, resulting in full mineralization within 15 and 20h, respectively for methanol and ethylene glycol. In the case of glycerol, the H2 rates were 85% that of the theoretical value within 30h. The activity and reusability of the Pt-KR catalyst exceeded those of the platinized standard, Pt-P25, particularly in the case of ethylene glycol and glycerol. This has been explained in terms of the high surface area of the former. Traces of methane were observed from methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol whilst both methane and ethane were detected in significant quantities in ethanol solutions. The presence of these by-products in ethanol hindered the efficiency of the system. These intermediates seem to form abundantly in alcohols containing a limited number of carbon–hydroxyl groups. In addition, water seems to play a crucial role in the formation of these intermediates. Encouraging results were obtained in preliminary tests carried out using solar radiation. However, an increase in the amount of useful photoactive energy not only implies enhancement of reactor design but also of the materials used as catalysts. Such an improved design could enable the system to be used for household supply."
