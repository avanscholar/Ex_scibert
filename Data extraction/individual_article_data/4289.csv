0,Introduction,"Unsaturated alcohols play an important role as intermediates in pharmaceutical and fine-chemical production. The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes can proceed either to the unsaturated alcohols via attack of the carbonyl bond, or to the saturated aldehydes via hydrogenation of the CC bond. Much research has been devoted to identify the factors governing selectivity in the above class of reactions [1–6]. Among the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, acrolein is the most difficult one to be hydrogenated selectively towards the unsaturated alcohol. Commonly used catalysts like Pt, Pd, Ni, Ru, supported on a non-reducible support mainly lead to the production of propanal. This has been mainly attributed to the lack of sterical screening of the CC double bond in the acrolein molecule, making it more prone to the attack by adsorbed hydrogen atoms [7–9]. At low acrolein coverage, a flat adsorption geometry is favoured on Pt(111), allowing for the interaction of both the CC and the CO bonds with the surface [7,10]. At higher coverage, acrolein coordinates to the surface mainly through the CC bond [10]. DFT calculations predict that the attack of the carbonyl function (not directly bonded to the surface) would be favoured over the attack at the CC bond, being in contrast to empirical observations of high reactivity of the CC bond. The desorption of the partially hydrogenated product plays a key role in controlling the selectivity in acrolein hydrogenation over Pt(111) [11]. As the desorption of the unsaturated alcohol exhibits a high energy barrier, the generation of free allyl alcohol is inhibited by its desorption step. Recent results showed that acrolein can be hydrogenated to allyl alcohol with selectivities up to 44% when using supported silver as a catalyst [6,12,13]. The reason for this different behaviour as opposed to the above-mentioned metals has not yet been clarified in details. Calculations using a bond-order conservation Morse potential model also indicate that the desorption step may play an important role in governing the selectivity of the acrolein hydrogenation over Ag(111) [14]. On the other hand, recent results by Lim et al. using DFT calculations indicate that acrolein is very weakly bound to Ag surfaces [15] and should not be activated for hydrogenation. Our recent research has concerned the factors governing the selectivity of acrolein hydrogenation over silver [6,13], with a strong focus on pressure and material dependence. We were able to show that increasing the pressure (with a fixed H2/acrolein ratio of 20:1) from 100mbar to 20bar leads to an increase in selectivity to allyl alcohol from 0 to ca. 44% when using Ag/SiO2 as catalyst. Below 100mbar, no allyl alcohol is formed at all. Additionally, the amount of allyl alcohol formed depends on the structural features of the Ag/SiO2 catalysts, with active sites for allyl alcohol formation most abundant on smaller particles. The degree of reduction of the silver has also a profound influence on the activity and selectivity in acrolein hydrogenation. Different oxygen species interacting with silver surfaces attracted a great deal of attention over the last decades mainly from the point of view of epoxidation research. It is well established now that various oxygen species can form on the surface depending on the experimental conditions [16–19], moreover dissociated oxygen tends to diffuse into subsurface sites [20,21], where it can reside even in reductive ambient. Regenerative oxygen pre-treatment on a deactivated Ag/SiO2 catalyst not only restored the initial conversion level in acrolein hydrogenation, but significantly increased activity and improved selectivity especially at lower reaction pressures. The aim of this publication is to present the results obtained during this study and to correlate the enhanced performance with the physical properties of silver materials."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation and catalysis,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and catalysis Details of the preparation have been published previously [12]. Briefly, the Ag/SiO2 catalysts with a metal loading of 5 and 7.5% have been prepared by incipient wetness (IW) and then reduced at 325°C for 2h. This latter reduction step has been performed with every catalyst sample independent of further additional pre-treatment (see below). Catalytic experiments were performed in the pressure region of 266mbar to 10bar. Experiments between 266 and 800mbar were performed in a closed-loop reactor system (reactor volume: 70ml) [22], using 6mg of 7.5% Ag/SiO2. The catalyst was subjected to different pre-treatments prior to acrolein hydrogenation: in H2 (800mbar for 2h), H2/Air (additional treatment with 40mbar air for 5min) and H2/Air/H2 (additional treatment with 133mbar H2 for 5min). All treatments were carried out at 250°C. These pre-treatments have been carried out in order to investigate the influence of oxygen species or oxygen-induced modifications of silver. Reaction products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID (flame ionization detector) and a 30m WAX glass capillary column. The reaction temperature was 250°C and the H2/acrolein ratio was 20:1. Experiments without Ag/SiO2 (i.e. only with quartz fixing material in the reactor) were also carried out, in order to subtract the blank activity. In the range of 10bar, experiments were carried out in a continuous gas flow reaction systems equipped with a gas chromatograph. Mass-flow controllers were used for gas dosing; acrolein was dosed by a liquid-flow controller. The hydrogen:acrolein ratio and the temperature were identical to those in the closed-loop apparatus, with a H2 flow rate of 6.7l/h (STP). Typically 232mg of freshly prepared 5% Ag/SiO2 have been used. In analogy to the low pressure experiments, pre-treatment of the catalysts with air has been carried out at ambient pressure ex situ at 250°C (denoted “Air-250” in the catalyst labels), sometimes followed by in situ reduction with hydrogen at 250°C (“H2-250”) or 325°C (“H2-325”), as detailed in the results section. For comparison, experiments were performed with commercial Ag2O (Alfa Aesar), too, in the as received state and after in situ reduction either at 250°C or 325°C for 2h. The sample has been diluted with quartz powder in order to avoid extensive agglomeration occurring in the absence of quartz powder."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The electronic state of the catalysts has been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A Leybold LHS 12 MCD instrument was used, and the measurements were performed with a pass energy of 48eV. The binding energy (BE) was calibrated to the Au 4f 7/2 line (BE=84.0eV). The sample was pre-treated in 800mbar H2 and in 800mbar O2 at 250°C in the preparation chamber of the XPS set-up, and then transferred to the analysis chamber without further contact to air. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to monitor the influence of the various pre-treatment steps and the reaction on the average particle size. The measurements have been performed using a JEM-3010 electron microscope from JEOL. The catalyst sample has been ultrasonically dispersed in methanol and dropped onto a carbon coated copper grid. At least 300 particles have been evaluated for particle size determination. Additionally, X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on the catalysts after different pre-treatments; however they revealed no modification of the bulk structure of silver particles within the sensitivity of the technique."
4,Results,"Recently we have shown that the selectivity to allyl alcohol during acrolein hydrogenation over silver based catalysts depends on the partial pressures of acrolein and hydrogen in a pressure range over four order of magnitudes (∼2mbar to 20bar) [12]. A strong positive dependence of the selectivity towards allyl alcohol on the reaction pressure has been found above 100mbar reaction pressure; below this pressure using a hydrogen:acrolein reaction mixture of 20:1, no allyl alcohol (AA) was produced. This latter indicated that the hydrogenation of the CO bond of acrolein does not proceed until a certain coverage level of the silver surface is reached. It is also possible that some restructuring of the catalyst – especially the silver particles – must occur that cannot take place below ∼100mbar (5mbar of acrolein). The catalytic performance of 7.5% Ag/SiO2 in the closed-loop reactor is summarized in Fig. 1 , where conversion of acrolein and AA selectivity are plotted vs. time. The unusual depiction of selectivity vs. time (and not vs. conversion) has been chosen, since there is a strong time-dependence of the selectivity. The level of conversion of the fresh sample (denoted as “H2-250”) at the higher reaction pressure (800mbar) was approximately half of that at 266mbar pressure. Considering the higher amount of acrolein introduced in the feed at 800mbar the fresh catalyst achieved 1.5-times higher turnover at that pressure. Regarding the selectivity, the fresh catalyst had a certain induction period for producing allyl alcohol. At the beginning, AA is not preferred and only after 9min on stream its production stabilizes. After running ten's of catalytic cycles (with evacuation and hydrogen treatment at 250°C between them) the Ag/SiO2 strongly deactivated (only investigated at 266mbar). Furthermore, the AA selectivity decreased by a factor of ∼5. Air treatment of this deactivated sample (“Air-250”) not only restored the original activity, but significantly increased the conversion level compared to the fresh sample, indicating that besides a possible removal of carbonaceous deposits an additional mechanism of activity enhancement is at work. This was much more pronounced in the 800mbar experiment than at 266mbar. Interestingly, very similar conversion curves were observed at both reaction conditions after air treatment. In addition to the activity enhancement, selectivity improved at both pressures and the induction period in the AA production at 800mbar was not observed anymore. The small decay in selectivity at 15 and 21min originates partly from the further hydrogenation of AA to propanol at higher conversion levels. After the run with air pre-treatment, the catalyst was pre-treated with air and then H2 (“Air-250 H2-250”). In the subsequent catalytic experiment, a similar, but slightly lower activity level and AA selectivity could be reached. Small amounts of air (∼4mbar) introduced to the reaction mixture slightly improved the performance. Experiments have also been performed at high pressure (p =10bar). As detailed in the experimental section, these have been done in a continuous gas flow system; therefore the selectivity values reported in the following are steady state values. A catalyst with slightly different Ag loading has been used for the high pressure measurements, showing, however a very similar catalytic pattern. Table 1 compares the selectivity to the main products allyl alcohol (AA), propanal (PA) and propanol (POH) and the conversion for the 5Ag/SiO2 catalyst after various pre-treatments, as indicated in the table, using identical experimental conditions including space velocity for each experiment. The higher selectivity in the high pressure experiments is most likely due to a pressure dependent change in adsorption geometry [5,12,13]. It has to be pointed out, that for each pre-treatment in this case fresh catalyst samples have been used. Thus, the observed increase in activity (see below) is due to this special treatment and not to effects which might have occurred during catalysis/pre-treatment cycles. After oxidizing the catalyst at 250°C (Air-250), activity is strongly enhanced. Selectivities to allyl alcohol and propanal are decreased and the consecutive reaction to propanol is strongly enhanced, indicating a very active catalyst. The picture does not change much with the catalyst reduced at 250°C after oxidation (Air-250 H2-250), which is not surprising since the reaction is carried out at the same temperature. However, when reducing the catalyst at 325°C after oxidation (Air-250 H2-325), the activity drops nearly to the value without oxidation, but an increase in AA selectivity compared to the initial one is observed. In the hydrogenation of allyl alcohol over silver, it has been shown that for conversions below 60%, the selectivity to allyl alcohol is nearly independent from conversion [12]. However, in the above experiments conversions >90% have been achieved. In order to clarify whether the observed changes in selectivity are due to high conversions, beside the effect of oxygen on the allyl alcohol selectivity the effect of further hydrogenation at high conversion has to be considered. This is shown in the case of the oxygen pre-treated sample in Fig. 2 (squares), for comparison data for the freshly reduced catalyst is also included (circles). In a broad conversion region S(AA) is slowly decreasing while above 80% conversion secondary reactions starts to dominate. Nevertheless, propanol formation seems to be slightly more favoured from propionaldehyde as its selectivity is more reduced (see Table 1). From Fig. 2, it is important to note that the S(AA) values indicate practically no selectivity increase due to the oxygen pre-treatment compared to the non-oxygen pre-treated catalyst. On the other hand, additional reduction at 325°C after oxygen pre-treatment improved selectivity above 50% as shown in Table 1. In order to ensure, that the observed influence on the activity and selectivity is not due to a change in particle size (since it is known that the selectivity in acrolein hydrogenation is influenced by particle size [6,12,13]), TEM experiments have been performed before and after using 5% Ag/SiO2 in catalytic tests. Table 2 summarizes the results of the TEM measurements. It can be seen, that there are significant differences in the particle sizes of the reduced and the oxidized catalyst. However, after use in the catalytic reaction, the average particle sizes are nearly the same, with the exception of the Air-250 H2-325 catalyst. The reason for the discrepancy in the latter case is currently not known, however, the difference in particle size is too small to account for the observed differences in activity and selectivity. In order to get more insight into the influence of oxygen in the hydrogenation over silver, experiments have been carried out in which commercial Ag2O was used as a catalyst. This material has been used as received or has been subjected to an in situ reduction step either at 250°C or 325°C for 2h. After both reduction temperatures, the catalytic behaviour of the sample is comparable: at 10bar the conversion was about 22%, and the selectivity to allyl alcohol was 32%. n-Propanol formation was insignificant on these catalysts. When the catalyst was not pre-reduced, activity and allyl alcohol selectivity were somewhat lower (X =15%, S(AA)=26%) (results not shown). XPS experiments were carried out on 7.5% Ag/SiO2 after different pre-treatments. The sample is charged by several (5–6)eV, which was corrected as the binding energy of Si 2p was set at 103.4eV, characteristic for SiO2. However, as the characteristic states of oxidized and metallic silver 3d are closely together (within 0.5eV) [23], the binding energy positions of Ag 3d after charging correction do not identify unambiguously the oxidation state of the silver particles. Instead, the modified Auger parameter (α′) [24] has been used to characterize the chemical state of Ag nanoparticles (Fig. 3 ). (The modified Auger parameter is the sum of the kinetic energy of the Auger electron (Ag M4N45N45) and the binding energy of the core level (Ag 3d5/2) peak.) This parameter is independent of charging, but still sensitive to chemical shifts. (Auger parameters are for Ag(0) 726.1eV and for Ag2O 724.4eV [25].) The modified Auger parameter demonstrates that Ag in the pre-reduced samples was the closest to the form of Ag(0). After reduction and oxidation treatment silver had an intermediate Auger parameter, being neither clean metal nor Ag2O. Subsequent hydrogen treatment increased the α′ value, however still not reaching that of Ag(0). The Ag 3d peaks (not shown separately) could have been fitted with only one however broad symmetric Gauss–Lorenz function with almost the same width (∼2eV). Such resolution does not allow to discriminate any oxidic component from the metallic main peak; however the constant half-width indicates rather the absence of oxide (Ag2O) even after oxidative treatment."
5,Discussion,"Silver as main component in hydrogenation catalysis can be regarded as non-typical. Even more surprising, oxygen pre-treatment enhances the activity of silver and furthermore, governs the reaction toward the desired allyl alcohol formation. This latter effect was more pronounced at sub-atmospheric pressure. The higher activity increased the possibility for further hydrogenation to propanol, which however was slightly more pronounced from the aldehyde. (Note that this reaction requires also the activation of the same carbonyl bond.) Recent DFT calculations [15] revealed that the adsorption of acrolein even on relatively open Ag(110) and on the monatomic steps of Ag(221) is so week that neither CC nor CO bond is weakened enough to be hydrogenated. It was suggested that defect sites containing O atoms or an oxidic layer could enable the silver surface to catalyze the hydrogenation of acrolein, and in particular the carbonyl function. This latter is in good accordance with the infrared reflection absorption results of Fujii et al. [26] showing one type of adsorption mode of acrolein coordinating with the carbonyl group to positively charged sites of silver. Our XPS data indicated clearly that such sites are present in oxygen treated Ag/SiO2 even after subsequent reduction. As the Ag 3d peaks could be fitted with one component, it is likely that no surface oxide [17,27] and Oγ [19], which might form under the applied conditions, could survive the hydrogen treatment. The catalytic behaviour of Ag2O supports the suggestion that Ag2O itself is not relevant for the high activity and selectivity obtained after air/oxygen treatment of Ag/SiO2. (It should be noted that the Ag2O sample is covered with carbonates in the as received state. However, IR experiments indicated that these carbonates decompose when applying the reduction treatments as detailed above.) As opposed to any oxide-like species, dissolved oxygen, which is readily formed under the applied oxygen treatment [19], could be responsible for the low Auger parameter observed in the XPS experiment. The proof of oxygen being able to stay in the bulk of silver in reducing environment comes from the early observation of hydrogen embrittlement of silver [28,29]. In this process water vapour bubbles form and grow in solid silver as oxygen saturated silver is annealed at high temperature in hydrogen. At 800°C hydrogen diffuses into the silver and reacts with the dissolved oxygen to form water vapour which precipitates in form of bubbles. Therefore, we assume that the subsurface oxygen introduced by the oxygen pre-treatment induces partial charge on above silver atoms at the surface, those being able to participate in and alter the hydrogenation reaction. In our recent publication [5] a flat-lying adsorption of acrolein was suggested and the in situ XAS experiments indicated a partly hydrogenated propionaldehyde-like species under 7.5mbar conditions. The flat coordination of acrolein is in line with calculations on Pt(111) [7] and on Pt80Fe20 [30] at lower coverage. At high coverage, the adsorption geometry on Pt(111) changes in that way that carbonyl decoordinates from the surface and hydrogen on the nearby top position attacks at the CO group [11]. Therefore, a pressure dependent modification of adsorption modes can induce changes in the selectivity of acrolein hydrogenation. Our recent result on the existence of a minimum critical pressure for allyl alcohol formation on Ag/SiO2 strengthens this model [5]. Similar to the changes in adsorption geometry induced by pressure, it is assumed that differently charged silver atoms on the surface/different kinds of active sites influence adsorption geometry. As in the mentioned paper by Fuiji et al. [26], positively charged silver atoms are able to coordinate the carbonyl group of acrolein. On the other hand, it has been shown that the binding of a CC double bond may be enhanced as well on kinks and edges [31], and that subsurface oxygen in silver may strengthen the binding of adsorbed ethylene, too [32,33]. A similar effect indeed could lead to enhanced CC bond hydrogenation of acrolein over positively charged sites. It is possible that an optimum charging for high allyl alcohol selectivity exists, with to positively charged silver also enhancing propionaldehyde formation. It can however not be excluded, that desorption also plays an important role in determining the selectivity in acrolein hydrogenation, however, on the basis of our results no final conclusion can be done. IR spectroscopic measurements have been carried out in order to clarify the adsorption geometry of acrolein on Ag/SiO2 catalysts, however, due to the strong interaction of acrolein with the silica support a discrimination of bands arising from acrolein adsorbed on silver from those of acrolein adsorbed on the support appeared to be difficult. Besides the changes in selectivity, an even more pronounced increase in activity has been found due to oxygen treatment. Also this process can be understood by the generation of electropositive silver sites enhancing dissociative adsorption of H2. Indeed it has been found in recent calorimetric experiments, that the oxygen pre-treatment of Ag/SiO2 catalysts used in this study leads to an enhanced H2 adsorption peak, which can be understood by assuming a higher number of adsorbed molecules or by more strongly bound hydrogen [34]. Support for this theory comes from DFT calculations which indicate that dissociation of hydrogen on Ag(111) is drastically enhanced when subsurface oxygen is present due to the up-shift of the d-band centre [32]. The difference in activity between the samples reduced at 250°C vs. 325°C after air treatment may be explained by a higher mobility of the dissolved oxygen in the latter case, leading to a stronger depletion of oxygen from the outer silver layers, and, thus, changing catalytic properties. Indeed, an oxygen desorption peak at 322°C from polycrystalline silver has been attributed to dissolved oxygen [35]. In early publications on silver single crystals, the desorption of “subsurface” oxygen has been attributed to peaks occurring even at lower temperatures (∼270°C), indicating that this temperature range is crucial in terms of stability of oxygen species [36,37]. The question now arises, why silver is active and selective even without an oxygen treatment. It is likely that oxygen species are present in the catalyst from the preparation process, albeit to a less extend. These oxygen species are stable during the initial hydrogen treatment, as can be seen by the Auger parameter, which is slightly shifted from that of the metallic state. Furthermore, a modification of the silver surface during the initial period of reaction can be suggested from the induction of S(AA) (see Fig. 1) at lower pressure and from the formation of few percent C2 and C3 alkanes leaving oxygen back on the catalyst. For testing the extent of oxygen activation, a part of the freshly prepared and reduced 5% Ag/SiO2 was stored in air (in dark) for approx. 5 month. Surprisingly, after storage in air the catalytic behaviour of the samples changed drastically (Fig. 4 ), as activity as well as consecutive hydrogenation towards propanol is strongly enhanced. Hence, slow but lengthy oxygen dissolution at RT seems to produce similar effect as a short 250°C air treatment. During all the above discussion, it has to be kept in mind that morphological changes or surface restructuring of the nanoparticles might occur during air pre-treatment, which might also modify the catalytic properties of the nanoparticles. Such changes, however, are very unlikely during storage at room temperature. Additionally, from the change in particle size during catalysis it is clear that the nanoparticles are restructuring also under the reducing conditions of the catalytic experiments, these, however, have been the same during all experiments and should lead to similar surface morphologies. It can still be imagined that subsurface oxygen stabilizes defects at the nanoparticle surface which also might alter the catalytic properties of the Ag/SiO2 system. Thus, while an explanation based on electronic modification of the Ag is favoured, morphological effects cannot be ruled out completely."
6,Conclusions,"A beneficial effect of oxygen pre-treatment of Ag/SiO2 catalysts in the acrolein hydrogenation has been demonstrated from sub-atmospheric (266mbar) to 10bar total pressure (hydrogen:acrolein ratio being constant at 20:1). The overall hydrogenation activity increased two- to three-fold after oxidative pre-treatment and also in the presence of small amounts of oxygen. At high conversion levels (over 90%) consecutive hydrogenation towards propanol predominated. Beside the activation, oxygen pre-treatment also increased the selectivity toward the desired product allyl alcohol, its selectivity exceeding 50%. It was demonstrated by a TEM study that the observed catalytic effect is not due to any change in the silver particles size, which was independent of the kind of pre-treatment applied. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that oxygen did not remain on the surface, if reductive pre-conditioning followed the oxidative pre-treatment. It, however, dissolved in silver and creates electropositive sites on the surface. These sites are highly active for the hydrogenation, resulting in overall activity increase. They may also affect acrolein adsorption geometry: enhancing the interaction between carbonyl group and electropositive silver surface, and thus resulting in increasing selectivity towards ally alcohol formation. Possibly an optimum charge exists, with to positively charged silver atoms leading to improved activity, but not selectivity."
