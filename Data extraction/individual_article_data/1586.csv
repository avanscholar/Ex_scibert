0,Introduction,"Within the context of future biorefineries, furanic compounds, such as furfural (C5) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (C6), are expected to play an essential role as bio-platform molecules for the production of chemicals and fuels. These compounds can be obtained by acid-catalysed hydrolysis and dehydration of C5-C6 carbohydrates, which constitute the main building blocks of lignocellulosic biomass [1, 2]. To obtain larger organic molecules, more suitable for the upgrading to biofuels, furan derivatives can be transformed by aldol condensation with other carbonyl-containing molecules forming CC bonds [3–5]. This approach has been successfully applied for the condensation of furfural with acetone, yielding as main product: 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one (FAc) [6, 7]. The subsequent hydrogenation and CO hydrogenolysis of this over-functionalized adduct leads to the production of versatile C8 linear diols suitable for the synthesis of both biofuels and bio-derived polyesters (Fig. 1 ) [8]. This challenging transformation involves several chemical reactions, which require the use of high temperatures (170–300 °C), hydrogen pressures (20–80 bar) and the participation of heterogeneous catalysts capable of reducing the number of separate catalytic steps by allowing transformation of a wide variety of functionalities; i.e. furan rings, olefins and carbonyl groups [9]. Porous materials with easy accessibility of bulky reactants to surface acid and supported metal sites have attracted much attention in the conversion of furfural-acetone adducts. The presence of reduced metal phase(s) is required to promote the hydrogenation steps, whereas acid sites have been proved to be necessary for CO hydrogenolysis reactions. Hence, Pd has shown a significant performance over supports such as: NbOPO4 [10], cobalt aluminate [11], HZSM-5 [12], MgO-ZrO2 [13] and Beta zeolite [14]. Equally, Pt has been extensively studied using as carriers: CoAl2O4 and NbOPO4 [15], SiO2-Al2O3, zeolites, MgZr mixed oxide and activated carbons [16]. Likewise, promising results were obtained using Ru/C and Ru nanoparticles supported onto an ionic liquid phase [17]. Opposed to the use of noble-metal-based catalysts, the catalytic conversion of furfural-acetone adducts with readily available 3d transition metals has been scarcely studied. Likewise, to the best of our knowledge, the use of SBA-15 based catalysts has not been reported in the literature yet. This ordered mesoporous material exhibits excellent support properties advantageous for the aimed transformation, e.g.; high (hydro)thermal stability, large specific surface area (>700 m2 g−1) and a well-defined mesoporous system (4–30 nm) [18]. Furthermore, the variable framework composition allows the incorporation of species such as Al or Zr [19], which provide the required surface acidity for further conversion towards the targeted alcohols. In this work, we address further catalyst development in the conversion of furfural-acetone adducts using SBA-15 supported Ni and Cu catalysts. The obtained product distributions were correlated with physico-chemical properties of the catalysts. This study aims to establish a rational design of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the production of C8+ linear alcohols from lignocellulose-derived furanic compounds."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalysts synthesis and preparation,"2.1 Catalysts synthesis and preparation Mesoporous all-silica SBA-15 and Al-containing (Si/Al = 30) SBA-15 materials were synthesised according to the method reported by Zukal et al. [20]. The incorporation of metal phases was carried out by incipient wetness impregnation. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h. Further details related to the synthesis and preparation methods are given in the ESI."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The prepared catalysts were characterized for their chemical composition (ICP-OES, FESEM-EDX), BET area and pore size distribution (N2 physisorption isotherms), surface acidity (NH3-TPD) and morphology (HAADF-STEM), as described in the ESI."
4,Catalytic experiments,"2.3 Catalytic experiments All reactions were performed in a high-pressure autoclave reactor system. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in a flow of H2. Afterwards, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and loaded with a solution of FAc (1 g) in acetone or 2-propanol (150 ml). Subsequently, the reactor was heated to 200 °C and the reaction started by pressuring the autoclave to 50 bar of hydrogen. The identification and quantification of the products were done using standard reference compounds and chromatographic methods (see ESI)."
5,Results and discussion,"Table 1 shows the product distributions obtained from the conversion of FAc over different SBA-15 supported metal catalysts using acetone as solvent. The reaction conditions (T = 200 °C, PH2 = 50 bar and 1000 rpm) were based on our previous findings regarding the conversion of FAc with different supported Pt catalysts [9]. In addition to the products listed in Table 1, other compounds, like 2-methyl-1,6-dioxaspiro[4,4]nonane and 2-propyl-tetrahydropyran were also identified with yields <3%. The Cu/SBA-15 sample showed an incomplete conversion of the FAc reactant after 8 h (59%) forming 4-(2-furyl)-butan-2-one (A) as the only product. The hydrogenation of the furan ring and the ketone group was completely impeded, in accordance with the poor catalytic performance of similar Cu-containing catalysts in hydrogenation of furfural [21, 22] and ketone-containing reactants [23, 24]. On the other hand, the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited a remarkable hydrogenation of FAc, affording a significant yield of the fully hydrogenated 4-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-butan-2-ol (D = 25%). These differences can be attributed to the different in structure and nature preferential adsorption sites over Cu and Ni. Thus, while Cu metal surfaces have very weak affinity for the CC bonds of the furan ring, the stronger adsorption of these bonds over Ni metal surfaces promotes the hydrogenation of the furan ring and the CO group, which is in the same plane [22]. These results highlight the good performance of the Ni loaded catalyst showing a higher hydrogenation activity than SBA-15 supported Pt and Pd catalysts (D = 1–5%). On the other hand, the Ru/SBA-15 catalyst showed a higher production of D (57%), consistent with the reported high selectivity of this metal for furan ring hydrogenation [25]. Likewise, a noticeable production of 2-butyl-furan and 2-butyl-tetrahydrofuran (E = 6–9%) was observed when using supported Ni and Ru catalysts, indicating that COH hydrogenolysis reactions occurred to some extent on these supported metals. The NiCu/SBA-15 bimetallic catalyst exhibited a significantly different catalytic activity compared to Ni and Cu monometallic catalysts. Particularly, the NiCu/SBA-15 sample showed the highest yield of D (63%) and E (16%) among the tested materials. Similar synergetic catalytic effects from the combination of Ni and Cu were previously proven in ethanol steam reforming [26, 27], glycerol hydrogenolysis [28] and hydrogenation of furfural and aromatics [29, 30]. According to these studies, the improved performance was due to an active NiCu binary phase exhibiting electronic properties different from the monometallic counterparts [31]. Because of the fewer d-band holes in the NiCu bimetallic phase compared to Ni, the adsorption strength of active hydrogen is weakened, enhancing its diffusion on the catalyst surface and facilitating hydrogenation reactions [32]. Hence, the NiCu bimetallic catalyst enhanced the hydrogenation rate of FAc, along with a higher promotion of C-OH hydrogenolysis reactions. Despite the superior hydrogenation activity shown by the NiCu/SBA-15 catalyst, no linear compounds were detected in the product mixture, suggesting the inhibition of ring-opening steps over this material. This behaviour can be related to the absence of surface acid sites, since those are usually required to promote the CO hydrogenolysis of furanic rings [9]. Thus, the purely siliceous SBA-15 support was modified by incorporating Al during the synthesis procedure to introduce mild surface acidity (Al-SBA-15, Si/Al = 30). The subsequent impregnation with Ni and Cu metal phases resulted in a bifunctional NiCu/Al-SBA-15 catalyst, which combined surface acid sites and the hydrogenating metal phase (see characterization of this catalyst by N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD and electron microscopy in Figs. 1–3 of the ESI). The obtained product distribution using NiCu/Al-SBA-15 showed a significant yield of 2,5-octanediol and 1,7-octanediol (C8 diols = 17%), together with a low yield of D (7%). The formation of further deoxygenated octanols was not observed, suggesting that CO hydrogenolysis/dehydration of the produced diols are limited under the reaction conditions. However, the main fraction of products corresponded to longer carbon chain compounds C8+ ≈ 44% (not listed in Table 1). The formation of these heavier by-products is likely due to the aldol condensation between ketone-containing compounds (mostly A) and acetone (Fig. 5 of the ESI). This reaction has been reported to prevail in the presence of acid sites and at moderate temperatures [9, 33]. Accordingly, despite yielding linear compounds through CO hydrogenolysis, the extent of aldol condensation as side reaction over the NiCu/Al-SBA-15 catalyst reduced the selectivity towards the targeted C8 diols. In order to prevent the formation of the heavier by-products, we tested the performance of the NiCu/Al-SBA-15 catalyst using 2-propanol instead of acetone as a solvent to limit condensation reactions. In this sense, 2-propanol has been revealed as an excellent solvent in the conversion of FAc due to its protic nature, intermediate polarity (εr = 18.3) and secondary alcohol character [34]. Fig. 2 depicts the reaction progress profiles over NiCu/Al-SBA-15 in acetone (Fig. 2a) and 2-propanol (Fig. 2b). In both experiments, A was the first intermediate due to the favoured hydrogenation of the CC aliphatic bond, reaching a maximum at short reaction times (30–120 min). The following hydrogenation of A formed products like B, C and D. The yield of the latter was considerably different in acetone (7%) and 2-propanol (53%) after 480 min of reaction. This fact could be related with the formation of condensate products when using acetone and with the promotion of catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions (based on the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction) in 2-propanol (Fig. 2a). On the contrary, aldol condensation reactions did not take place in 2-propanol (C8+ compounds were not detected), showing a higher selectivity towards the fully hydrogenated product D. Both C8+ condensates (in Fig. 2a) and D (in Fig. 2b) exhibited a similar yield over time behaviour, showing a continuous increase in the interval 60–240 min and no significant change at reaction times >240 min. The latter trend is likely associated with the total consumption of their main precursors after 240 min, i.e. FAc, A and B. On the other hand, the lack of further conversion of D suggests that the CO hydrogenolysis of this compound is not favoured under the reaction conditions applied. Thus, the noticeable production of C8diols reached in 2-propanol (28%) likely occurs via ring opening of other intermediates like A or C. This observation agrees with previous studies which report that CO hydrogenolysis of furanic compounds preferentially takes place through non-saturated rings (such as hydrofuranic) due to the higher activation energy required for tetrahydrofuran intermediates [35–37]."
6,Conclusions,"A direct catalytic process for the partial defunctionalisation of furfural-acetone adducts using non-noble metal-based catalysts under mild reaction conditions has been reported. A bimetallic NiCu phase supported on Al-SBA-15 has been demonstrated as an effective catalyst to produce C8 linear diols. The combination of a highly redox-active metal phase and acid sites promotes the required hydrogenation and CO hydrogenolysis reactions. Likewise, the noticeable differences between acetone and 2-propanol reveal the great impact of the solvent on the obtained product distribution, affecting both activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, more studies of the non-precious NiCu/Al-SBA-15 catalysts are required for deeper understanding, mainly of the catalytic chemistry and stability. Equally, the use of alternative solvents with lower H2 solubility and slower hydrogenation kinetics could be explored in order to promote acid-ring opening over furan hydrogenation reactions. This work improves the understanding of the conversion of furfural-acetone adducts, and may enable the design of 3d transition metals-based catalysts for the transformation of furanic compounds to fuels and commodity chemicals."
