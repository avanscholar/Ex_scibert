0,Introduction,"With the developments of industrialization, the large-scale exploitation of fossil resources has promoted the rapid development of human society but has also led to environmental pollution and energy crises. Water pollution (Maximova and Dahl, 2007), the greenhouse effect (Schwartz, 2008), energy shortages, and reduced biodiversity (Myers et al., 2000) have become huge problems for humanity (Abbasi and Abbasi, 2011; Ansell and Cayzer, 2018). To alleviate the current environmental pollution situation and the global energy crisis, researchers have continued to explore and develop new green renewable resources (Oubraham and Zaccour, 2018; Chuayboon et al., 2019) such as wind, solar, biomass power, etc. (Lund, 2007). Among these options, using biomass energy as a clean renewable energy has the advantages of having widespread sources, abundant reserves and low prices (Kim and Dale, 2004). Biomass waste can be used as a raw material for the production of high value-added fuels and chemicals (Dhillon and von Wuehlisch, 2013), and it has great potential to replace traditional fossil energy (Himmel et al., 2007). Including the EU, the United States, China, India, etc., most countries in the world have made the development of renewable bioenergy as a policy (Holladay et al., 2007; Haixing et al., 2008; Jingquan, 2012; Scarlat et al., 2015; Shiwei and Chunxiu, 2016; Ramcilovic-Suominen and Pülzl, 2018; Maes and Van Passel, 2019; Singh and Singh, 2019). The exploration of more effective methods of using biomass resources is attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Biomass comes from a variety of organisms, and it is produced by photosynthesis in nature. These organisms primarily include plants, animals and microorganisms, which are primarily made up of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose is a linear crystalline polymer made of glucose, hemicellulose is an amorphous polymer made of five carbon sugars and six carbon sugars, and lignin is a biopolymer with three-dimensional network structure formed by the connection of three phenylpropane units using ether bonds and carbon-carbon bonds (Lapierre et al., 1995). In lignocellulosic biomass, the percentage of cellulose components is 30–50 %, hemicellulose is 20–35 %, and lignin is 15–20 % (Wyman et al., 2005). To make full use of biomass resources, biomass feedstocks can be converted to biomass-based platform compounds to synthesize high value-added chemicals (Geilen et al., 2010; Isikgor and Becer, 2015). Following the conversion of cellulose, the products primarily include sugars (Li et al., 2017a), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (Thapa et al., 2017), lactic acid (Wright and Palkovits, 2012), levulinic acid (LA) (Khan et al., 2018), 1,2-ethylene glycol (Zheng et al., 2010), sorbitol (Almeida et al., 2017), 2,5-dihydroxyfuran (Zhu et al., 2015), formic acid (Niu et al., 2015), gluconic acid (An et al., 2012) and glycolic acid (Pullanikat et al., 2010). When hemicellulose is used as the raw material, its products primarily include xylose (Lavarack et al., 2002), furfural (FAL) (Luo et al., 2019), levulinate (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2018) and γ-valerolactone (GVL) (Tang et al., 2014). Among these platform compounds, GVL has characteristic physical properties such as a high boiling point (207 °C), high flash point (96.1 °C), low melting point (-31 °C) and low toxicity (LD50 = 8800 mg/kg) (Yan et al., 2015b). In addition, it has high chemical stability and can be used as a green organic solvent for a variety of reactions with broad application prospects in the food industry, organic synthesis, and the biorefinery and petrochemical industries (Luterbacher et al., 2014; Mellmer et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Santoro et al., 2017) for uses such as fuel additives, pharmaceutical intermediates, advanced olefin fuels, green regenerating solvents, nylon intermediates, etc.(Kumar et al., 2017; Pongrácz et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018). Fig. 1 summarized the reaction of lignocellulose to produce GVL, which can be performed through two paths. For the raw material in the first path, cellulose is hydrolysed to glucose and then isomerized to produce fructose, followed by further dehydration to form 5-HMF, which would be decarboxylated to form LA or levulinate. Finally, a hydrogenation-cyclization cascade reaction transforms both LA and levulinate into GVL. In summary, preparing GVL from cellulose requires one hydrolysis and one hydrogenation reaction. Another conversion pathway is based on hemicellulose, which is hydrolysed to form xylose and then further converted to FAL; subsequently, FAL is converted to furfuryl alcohol (FA) by transfer hydrogenation and levulinate is formed. Finally, a hydrogenation-cyclization series reaction helps to transform levulinate into GVL. Unlike the first path, one more hydrogenation reaction is necessary. The last important component, which is lignin, can be used as the biochar carrier to catalyse biomass for the preparation of platform compounds (Han et al., 2019). From the perspective of the raw material, including cellulose (Khan et al., 2018) and its degradation products glucose (Kim et al., 2018), fructose (Thapa et al., 2017), and hemicellulose (Leal Silva et al., 2018) and the degradation products FAL (Chen et al., 2016) and FA (Neves et al., 2013), previous studies on GVL synthesis have indicated that LA and levulinate are essential intermediates for producing GVL (Kuwahara et al., 2015; Putrakumar et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018). The catalytic system is divided into a homogeneous catalytic system and a heterogeneous catalytic system. The advantage of the homogeneous catalytic system is its high catalytic performance (Chalid et al., 2011; Oklu and Makhubela, 2018). However, the substrate and the catalyst are difficult to separate and thus the homogeneous catalysts are difficult to recycle and reuse (Agirrezabal-Telleria et al., 2013; Han et al., 2019). Therefore, more researchers have focused on studying multifunctional solid acid catalysts. From an economic point of view, the metals used in the catalyst can be divided into precious metals and non-precious metals. To reduce costs, it is necessary to develop efficient and inexpensive non-precious metals (Xiao et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2017) to replace the use of the traditional precious metals. From the standpoint of hydrogen donors, due to the danger and costliness of high-pressure H2 (Sun et al., 2017, 2018a), more attention is being paid to the use of the by-product formic acid (He and Horváth, 2017; Feng et al., 2018) or alcohols as the hydrogen source for the GVL production process (Li et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2019a). At present, the classification of different catalytic systems and the hydrogen supply mode of GVL prepared from specific raw materials has been summarized in reviews on GVL synthesis (Wright and Palkovits, 2012; Tang et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2015a; Omoruyi et al., 2016; Osatiashtiani et al., 2017). This paper introduces the synthesis of GVL from the perspective of full biomass waste utilization, especially the biomass sources cellulose and hemicellulose. From the various reaction stages, the research progress on GVL and the application of lignin in GVL synthesis are reviewed comprehensively and systematically. According to the requirements of a continuous multi-step reaction, using cellulose and hemicellulose as raw materials, with lignin or biochar as carrier to load non-precious metals, a one-pot multi-step series reaction without high hydrogen pressure is proposed."
1,Cellulose degradation based on GVL production,"Cellulose is a major component of plant cell walls, and it is a chemically stable linear polymer compound formed by several d-glucosyl groups through 1,4 glycosidic bonds. Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals bonds in plants combine cellulose polymers to form fibre bundles, which have high mechanical strength (Lu et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2009). Due to the presence of hydrogen bonds, the hydrolysis of cellulose is significantly more difficult than the hydrolysis of hemicellulose. The cellulose-based biomass contains crystalline cellulose and amorphous cellulose, and crystalline cellulose is more difficult to hydrolyse. Therefore, the hydrolysis rate of the crystalline cellulose directly determines the overall hydrolysis rate of the cellulose. Finding a method for hydrolysing cellulose efficiently and thoroughly is a difficult problem in cellulose research. At present, the commonly used catalysts for hydrolysing cellulose include alkali, acid, cellulase and metal ions (Vega et al., 1988; Garrote et al., 1999; Saha et al., 2005). Under strong acidity and high reaction temperature conditions, cellulose can be hydrolysed into glucose."
2,Reaction pathway and mechanism,"2.1 Reaction pathway and mechanism The process of preparing GVL from cellulose can be divided into two steps and the specific reaction pathway is shown in Fig. 2 ; the first step is to hydrolyse cellulose to form formic acid and LA under the action of a bimetallic catalyst and the second step is to reduce LA to prepare GVL using formic acid as a hydrogen source (Sen et al., 2012), which can reduce organic substances (Fellay et al., 2008; Loges et al., 2008). Under the catalysis of acid, cellulose is theoretically hydrolysed to produce equimolar amounts of formic acid and LA, and thus, a sufficient amount of formic acid can be used to reduce LA to synthesize GVL without the need for an external hydrogenation source. In the current research on preparing GVL from LA, the use of formic acid has become a research hotspot."
3,Production of LA from cellulose,"2.2 Production of LA from cellulose In the existing research, cellulose is used as a raw material that is hydrolysed to produce glucose, and glucose is dehydrated to form 5-HMF. Theoretically, 5-HMF is hydrolysed to form equimolar amounts of LA and formic acid (Fig. 3 ). The key step in the hydrolysis of cellulose to form LA is the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose (Jundong and Linhuo, 2016). 2.2.1 Liquid catalyst Cellulose is depolymerized into monomers, which are selectively converted into important platform compounds by chemical catalysis or biocatalysis (Corma et al., 2007; Zakzeski et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2011). The depolymerization methods primarily include acid-catalysed hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis. Due to the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces inside the cellulose, it is difficult to degrade this material. Strong inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid are often used to promote the hydrolysis of cellulose into sugars, and the yield is generally 30 %–70 %. The cellulose is hydrolysed to obtain 63 % LA, and 0.55 M sulfuric acid is used as a catalyst at 150 °C (Girisuta et al., 2013). Straw is hydrolysed in a mixture of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, which can increase the sugar yield by 10 %–20 %, and the effect of pre-treating with sulfuric acid is better than pre-treating with phosphoric acid (Um et al., 2003). Many kinetic studies have been used to reduce side reactions during cellulose hydrolysis to increase the selectivity of LA. LA and formic acid are prepared from cellulose under hydrothermal conditions, using HCL as a catalyst. The kinetic parameters have indicated that the rates of formation for LA and 5-HMF played a decisive role in the pre- and post-reaction speeds (Shen and Wyman, 2012). The results of the kinetic parameters for glucose conversion to LA using H2SO4 as a catalyst showed that low temperature and long-term experimental conditions (140−160 °C, 100 min) were beneficial for improving the selectivity of the LA (Weingarten et al., 2012a). Endoglucanase, exo-glycan cellobiohydrolase and cellulase are synergistically combined to convert cellulose to glucose rapidly and efficiently. Changing the chemical structure of cellulose can improve the hydrolysis effect of the enzyme, and the hydrolysis yield of the treated 2,3-dialdehyde-based cellulose can exceed 50 % (Shaikh et al., 2011). The cost of enzymatic hydrolysis is high, so its large-scale applications are restricted within the actual production process (Ebaid et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019). Studies have shown that higher LA yields can be obtained during a two-phase solvent system incorporating an organic solvent in which GVL exhibits excellent properties. A mixed solution with equal volumes of GVL and water as the solvent and HCl as the catalyst with LA in the product was extracted into an organic solvent to prevent its degradation, and a 70 % LA yield was obtained (Wettstein et al., 2012). In addition, ionic liquids have attracted attention because of their good solubility, recyclability and easy separation from other substances (Liyang et al., 2013). However, because of the high cost and toxic nature of ionic liquids, further research is needed for their development and application (Tao et al., 2013). Moreover, some researchers have applied supercritical treatments to the cellulose hydrolysis process (Sasaki et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2006). 2.2.2 Solid catalysts Although inorganic acid catalysts can effectively catalyse the preparation of LA from cellulose, there are still many problems with homogeneous catalysts, namely (1) Inorganic acid causes potential corrosion to equipment; (2) catalysts and substrates are difficult to separate and the purification process is complicated; and (3) homogeneous catalysts are difficult to reuse (Agirrezabal-Telleria et al., 2013; Han et al., 2019). Scientists have turned their attention to developing a highly efficient, multi-functional solid acid catalyst and Table 1 shows the levulinic acid production process using solid acid catalysts in recent years. With ZrO2 as the catalyst, cellulose was successfully hydrolysed into LA (53.9 %) at 180 °C for 3 h. FT-IR and NMR characterizations showed that carbon deposition on the catalyst surface resulted in a decrease in catalyst activity, which can be restored by calcination (Joshi et al., 2014). ZrO2 was used as a catalyst for the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose under an oxygen atmosphere. It was found that applying 2.8 % oxygen increased the yield of LA. The difference in this process compared with the conventional catalytic mechanism is that peroxy radicals play a key role in the reaction, and they oxidize glucose to gluconic acid, which is then converted to LA (Lin et al., 2012). Recently, an interesting experimental result on the hydrolysis of cellulose was found. Lignin was used as a carrier to support FeS to prepare a novel solid acid catalyst, and GVL was used as a solvent to obtain a catalytic yield of LA (35.64 %) close to the commercial catalyst CMHT (Han et al., 2019). This approach provides new ideas for the full utilization of biomass components."
4,Production of GVL from LA,"2.3 Production of GVL from LA LA is one of the 12 most valuable platform compounds identified by the US Department of Energy, and it is a bridge for the conversion of biomass into fuels and chemicals (Weingarten et al., 2012b; Guzmán et al., 2016; Han et al., 2019). At present, LA is widely used in fields relating to medicine, dyes, coatings, pesticides, plastic additives, resins and lubricant additives, and it can be upgraded to liquid fuel under catalytic conditions (Gürbüz et al., 2011; Joshi et al., 2011). LA is a special molecular structure containing carbonyl and carboxyl groups. It can produce a series of chemical reactions such as esterification, hydrogenation, halogenation and oxidation (Fig. 4 ). It is one of the most promising green platform compounds. 2.3.1 Catalytic system LA is an important intermediate in the preparation of GVL from biomass and the two reaction pathways for GVL production from LA are shown in Fig. 5 . The hydrogenation of a carbon-oxygen double bond involves the carbonyl group of LA in forming γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, followed by intramolecular dehydration and lactonization to form GVL (Starodubtseva et al., 2005). In addition, when the temperature is high, the carbonyl group is enolized, and the α-angelica lactone and β-angelica lactone are formed by intramolecular dehydration. Finally, the double bond in the α-angelica and β-angelica lactone form GVL by hydrogenation (Putrakumar et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016). Theoretically, the hydrolysis of cellulose to LA is accompanied by the equimolar formation of formic acid. Under certain conditions, hydrogen produced by the decomposition of formic acid can be used as a hydrogen source for the hydrogenation of LA. The use of formic acid as a hydrogen source to replace traditional hydrogen has become a research hotspot for the preparation of GVL from LA. 2.3.1.1 Homogeneous catalyst Many studies have shown that the use of homogeneous catalysts can provide high yields of GVL under relatively mild and controllable reaction conditions (Chalid et al., 2011; Yi et al., 2018). An active precious metal (Ru or Ir) can significantly promote the catalytic effect in combination with different ligands. Tukacs et al. (2014) studied the preparation of GVL by LA by using a water-soluble rhodium-binding phosphine ligand as a catalyst. When the ligand is present, the reaction can proceed. The Bu-DPPS monophosphine ligand was added at 140 °C under hydrogen pressure of 100 bar, and the GVL yield was 99.9 %. Through the addition of different types of the bisphosphine ligand, DPPB, the GVL can reach the same yield only under 50 bar hydrogen pressure when the other conditions are the same. Further studies have shown that the number of methylene groups connecting the two phosphorus atoms has a significant effect on the reaction. Having the proper amount of ligand is beneficial to the reduction of the carbonyl groups. When the DPPB/Ru ratio is 10:1, the highest catalytic activity is achieved, and the catalyst remains highly catalytically active after 10 cycles. In addition, [RuCl2(PPh3)3] exhibits high catalytic performance for the LA preparation of GVL (Osakada et al., 1982), and [Ru(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate) and the ligand TPPT can also be used as high-efficiency homogeneous catalysts (Horváth et al., 2008). Gao et al. studied the preparation of GVL using a PNP-Ir clamp complex, and the dearomatization/rearomatization was summarized in four stages by density functional theory (DFT) calculation as follows: hydride transfer, methylene proton transfer in PNP ligand, the coordination and splitting of H2, and the cyclization of γ-hydroxyvaleric acid to GVL, which fully explains the hydrogenation mechanism of the metal complexes (Gao and Chen, 2015). 2.3.1.2 Heterogeneous catalyst A homogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of GVL from LA facilitates the sufficient contact of the substrate with the catalyst to achieve a higher catalytic efficiency (Chalid et al., 2011; Oklu and Makhubela, 2018). However, the use of precious metals and ligands has led to complex catalyst synthesis processes and high catalyst manufacturing costs, and the catalysts cannot be recycled. The cyclability of heterogeneous catalysts and the low cost following the introduction of non-noble metals will cause the gradual replacement of homogeneous catalysts by heterogeneous catalysts for industrial production (Al-Naji et al., 2016). To satisfy the conditions for hydrogenation and acid catalysis, a metal that promotes hydrogenation is generally combined with various carriers to provide an acidic site needed to form a solid acid catalyst. Molecular sieves (Mohan et al., 2014a), carbon materials (Schuette and Thomas, 1930b), and metal oxides (Tan et al., 2015) are often used as carriers for providing acidic sites. The metal acts as an active centre, and the external hydrogenation source is added through the synergistic action of the carrier and the metal to perform a catalytic reaction. 2.3.1.2.1 Precious metal catalyst Schuette and Thomas (1930b) first synthesized GVL by LA with a heterogeneous platinum oxide catalyst, with 0.23-0.30 MPa hydrogen and diethyl ether as catalysts. After 44 h, 87 % of GVL yield was obtained, in the 1930s. Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Au, and Re are commonly used to prepare GVL from LA and levulinate, in which the noble metal Ru exhibits high selectivity. Organic mesoporous carbon was used as the carrier, and different ratios of RuxNi1-x were used to convert LA catalytically to prepare the GVL. Without solvent, the GVL yield increased with the increasing Ru content. The catalytic activity of RuxNi1-x/OMC is similar to that of Ru/OMC. The RuxNi1-x/OMC turnover number (TON) is significantly higher than the latter. The characterization results show that the surface of the carbon material is uniformly distributed with Ru and Ni metal ions. The strong interaction between the support and the metal ion allows the catalyst to exhibit good catalytic activity and cycle performance (Yang et al., 2014b). Manzer (2004) supported a 5 wt% of the noble metals Ru, Ir, Rh, Re, Pd and Pt on activated carbon as catalysts, wherein a 5 wt% Ru/C catalyst had the highest catalytic selectivity. Abdelrahman et al. (2014) studied the kinetic analysis of Ru/C catalysts during the hydrogenation of LA. The effect of the temperature on the reaction path is attributed to the fact that the key steps that determine the overall rate of the reaction are different at different temperatures, resulting in different side reactions. In terms of the catalyst, the sintering of Ru particles is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. To form a strong interaction between Ru and the support, the active metal on the catalyst support acts sufficiently to increase the stability of the Ru. The use of different catalyst supports affects the dispersion and particle size of the metal in the catalyst and may result in varying degrees of interaction (Cao et al., 2015). Scholars have also explored the effect of different supported Ru catalysts on the catalyst activity. Tan et al. (2015) used TiO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2 as carriers to support Ru to test the performance of the catalyst, and Ru can be uniformly dispersed on the carrier TiO2. In addition, hydroxyapatite (HAP) (Sudhakar et al., 2014) and sulfonated polyethersulfone (SPES) (Yao et al., 2014) were used as a carrier to support Ru and prepare a novel solid acid, and it was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst for the preparation of GVL from LA. 2.3.1.2.2 Non-precious metal catalyst The expensive price of precious metals limits their applications to industrial development. Therefore, the development of inexpensive and efficient non-precious metal catalysts is the current trend. For example, Ni, Cu, and Co have all been shown to exhibit great catalytic activity and high product selectivity during the preparation of GVL from LA. The non-noble metal Ni has attracted extensive attention due to its high catalytic activity. Related studies have shown that the choice of carrier can promote the activity of Ni-based catalysts. Mohan et al. (2014b) tested the performance of catalysts during the catalysed formation of GVL by LA when using Ni with Al2O3, SiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, TiO2 and MgO. The 30 % Ni/SiO2 solid acid catalyst showed excellent performance. The GVL yield is nearly 90 %, and the catalyst has stability. The reason the catalyst has excellent catalytic activity is attributed to the high dispersion of Ni on the Al2O3, SiO2, and MgO supports. Jiang et al. (2016) loaded Ni onto MgO and Al2O3 to prepare catalysts with different Mg/Al ratios. The GVL selectivity was found to be as high as 99.7 % and had good circulation with Ni/MgAlO2.5 at 160 °C, 3 MPa H2 pressure for 1 h. It has been noted that the bimetallic composite catalyst composed of Cu and other metals also exhibits excellent catalytic performance. Hengne and Rode (2012) studied the catalytic properties of Cu/ZrO2, Cu/BaO, Cu/Al2O3, and Cu/Cr2O3 during the reduction of LA to GVL. The LA was completely converted by Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/Al2O3 under 500 psi of H2, and the selectivity of GVL in aqueous solution was 100 % for 5 h at 200 °C. In addition to studying a single non-noble metal, scholars have turned their attention to multi-metal combination catalysts, using the synergy between metals to achieve higher catalytic efficiency and catalytic selectivity. Zhang et al. (2015) prepared a series of metal oxide mixtures composed of Ni/Cu/Al/Fe. By adjusting the composition of the catalyst and the calcination conditions, it was found that Ni2.78Cu1Al1.08Fe0.44 under 425 K, 2.0 MPa hydrogen pressure had the highest catalytic activity, with a GVL yield of 94.8 %. 2.3.2 Selection of hydrogen source During the process of preparing GVL from LA, in addition to using H2 as a hydrogen source, formic acid (Ortiz-Cervantes et al., 2015) and alcohol (Kuwahara et al., 2014) were also used as hydrogen donors for the reaction. According to the different hydrogen sources, the process is primarily divided into direct hydrogenation (H2) and transfer hydrogenation (hydrogen donor). 2.3.2.1 Direct hydrogenation The noble metal catalyst can effectively achieve the reduction of the carbonyl group in a hydrogen atmosphere. Hengne et al. (2013) catalysed the preparation of GVL from FAL with a mixed catalyst composed of an acidic ionic liquid and the noble metal Ru. In combination with a Ru/C catalyst with a hydrogenation function under a hydrogen atmosphere of 500 psi, the selectivity of GVL was 68 %. In addition to precious metals, Rong et al. (2014) investigated the catalytic activity of their homemade catalyst RQ-Ni and a series of Raney metal catalysts to catalyse the preparation of GVL from LA under a hydrogen atmosphere of 393 K and 2.0 MPa. The specific surface area of the homemade catalyst was higher. This catalyst has more active sites and is superior to the Raney metal that Mai et al. (2014) used, Mo2C/AC, and Mo2C/CNT was used to catalyse LA to prepare GVL under 473 K, 30 bar hydrogen. It is found that carbon nanoducts have electron confinement effects, which can effectively prevent the loss and oxidation of active sites during the reaction, making the Mo2C/CNT catalysts stable and highly efficient. Under the catalyst conditions, the reaction pathway is attributed to LA to form angelica lactone, which is then hydrogenated to form GVL. Alternatively, LA is directly hydrogenated to form 4-hydroxyvaleric acid, which is then esterified to form a GVL (Fig. 6 ). 2.3.2.2 Transfer hydrogenation During the traditional preparation of GVL from LA, H2 is often used as a hydrogen source, and the use of H2 leads to high costs and unsafe conditions. In recent years, indirect hydrogenation has received extensive attention, and both alcohol (Kuwahara et al., 2014) and formic acid (Ortiz-Cervantes et al., 2015) have been shown to be useful as external hydrogenation sources. The production of GVL, which is based on cellulose, theoretically produces equimolar amounts of LA and formic acid when cellulose is hydrolysed. Therefore, the direct use of formic acid as the hydrogen source of GVL for LA has become the focus of the current research. Zhang et al. (2016) used isopropanol (IPA) as a hydrogen source and Au/TiO2 as a photocatalytic catalyst to convert LA to prepare GVL. When using IPA as the hydrogen donor, the GVL selectivity is 85 %, the hydrogen atom transfer efficiency is 74 %, and the TiO2 carrier with an anatase and rutile structure is found to have good catalytic performance according to the different free radical scavengers, which explained the reaction mechanism (Fig. 7 ). Combining with the actual production of lignocellulose biorefinery, Gabriel Morales reported the study of GVL preparation from a mixture of FAL and LA by a one-pot method, using IPA as the hydrogen source and Zr-Al-Beta as the catalyst. The results show that LA is beneficial to avoid the deposition of humus on the catalyst to achieve the efficient conversion of FAL and LA, as well as the high yield and productivity of GVL, while improving the reusability of the catalyst (Morales et al., 2019). Chia and Dumesic (2011) used 2-butanol as a hydrogen donor to catalyse the conversion of butyl levulinate (BL) to prepare GVL. ZrO2 exhibited strong catalytic activity in a series of solid base catalysts. At 423 K for 16 h, the yield of GVL reached 84.7 %. In the early reports, formic acid was used as a hydrogen donor to participate in the reduction of aldehydes and ketone compounds (Upare et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2018). At present, the catalysts for formic acid are mostly focused on precious metals. Ortiz-Cervantes et al. (2015) used a (dtpbe)PdCl2 complex as a precursor in the preparation of GVL from LA, formic acid as a hydrogen donor, and triethylamine as an auxiliary, and the GVL yield reached 100 % at 373 K, 5.0 h. Feng et al. (2018) used a Ru/C catalyst to convert LA to GVL and triethylamine as an auxiliary at 160 °C, 180 min; the conversion of LA was 87.26 % and the maximum yield of GVL was 80.75 % (Fig. 7). We summarized the researches on the conversion of LA to GVL with non-hydrogen as the hydrogen source in recent years and the results are shown in Table 2 ."
5,Hemicellulose degradation based on GVL production,"Hemicellulose is an amorphous polymer with a branched structure that generally consists of five different sugar groups, namely d-xylose, d-galactose, d-glucose, d-mannose and l-arabinose. The xylose content accounts for the largest proportion (Lynd et al., 1991). Since hemicellulose has a branched structure and a short molecular chain, the conditions required for hemicellulose hydrolysis are milder than those for cellulose. Due to the branched structure of hemicellulose and the short molecular chain, the conditions required for hemicellulose hydrolysis are milder than those for cellulose, and the hydrolysate xylose can be used to produce ethanol and FAL (Zaldivar et al., 2001)."
6,Reaction pathway and mechanism,"3.1 Reaction pathway and mechanism As shown in Fig. 8 , hemicellulose can produce GVL using 2-butanol as a hydrogen donor. Hemicellulose is hydrolysed by a Brønsted acid to form a five-carbon sugar and xylose can form FAL through a three-step continuous dehydration reaction. The FAL is reduced to FA by a transfer hydrogenation reaction. In the presence of a solid acid catalyst and 2-butanol, a portion of the FA is etherified to form furfuryl ether (FE), and the Brønsted acid converts FA and FE into a mixture of LA and BL by a hydrolysis ring-opening reaction. Finally, LA and BL undergo a second hydrogenation process to produce 4-hydroxyvalerate (4-HPs) and form a GVL by lactonization (Bui et al., 2013)."
7,Production of FAL from hemicellulose,"3.2 Production of FAL from hemicellulose Hemicellulose is hydrolysed to form xylose, and the hydroxyl group in xylose can be dehydrated by a hydrogen ion to form a carbon-carbon double bond and a carbon-oxygen double bond; it is then dehydrated to form FAL (Fig. 9 ) (Gravitis et al., 2001). The FAL preparation method has been reported in many articles, and developing a preparation process using xylose, xylan and hemicellulose as raw materials is the primary research direction. 3.2.1 Liquid catalyst The reaction conditions required for the hydrolysis of hemicellulose are mild, but the condensation and esterification of xylose with other by-products leads to a decrease in the FAL yield (Root, 1956). A study has shown that when the conversion rate of xylose is low, the selectivity of FAL is as high as 96 %. The traditional FAL production process used sulfuric acid as the catalyst, which had a low product yield and high energy consumption (Gürbüz et al., 2013). While corn cobs were used as raw materials and H2SO4 was used as a catalyst at a concentration of 5 %, 95 % of the hemicellulose was decomposed into pentose sugar after 4 h of reaction. The pentose solution was then concentrated and extracted with p-nitrotoluene to obtain a 70 % FAL yield (Sproull et al., 1986). The catalytic performance comparison results for hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, formic acid and phosphoric acid used to convert xylan and xylose into FAL showed that the catalytic activity of hydrochloric acid was the highest (Yemiş and Mazza, 2011). In addition, some scholars have considered the use of organic acid catalysts. FAL was prepared by a two-step method of hydrolysing corn stover with methacrylic acid under microwave heating, and the selectivity of the FAL was 67 % (Kim et al., 2012). Formic acid and acetic acid also exhibit excellent catalytic effects within this reaction system (Sun and Cheng, 2002; Mosier et al., 2005; Mamman et al., 2008). In recent years, new environmentally friendly solvents have been developed to replace the pure water solvent used in FAL production, which can reduce the high energy consumption needed for separating FAL from water. The reaction system for producing FAL primarily has a single-phase system and a two-phase system. In the study of single-phase systems, DMSO (Dias et al., 2005), ionic liquid (Lima et al., 2009), supercritical CO2 (Pernak et al., 2003), etc. have shown good effects in the preparation of FAL from carbohydrates. Among them, ionic liquids are one of the current research hotspots. The two-phase system mostly consists of an aqueous phase and an organic phase, which can extract the product in time, effectively inhibit the formation of by-products, and increase the selectivity and yield of FAL (Wang et al., 2015). The conversion of xylose and arabinose to FAL has been studied in a single aqueous phase solvent and a two-phase solvent of p-xylene and water. The results show that the FAL yields are 18 % and 56 % in the aqueous and two-phase systems, respectively (Sahu and Dhepe, 2012). In the two-phase system containing GVL and water, 0.10 % sulfuric acid was used to hydrolyses the corn cobs to prepare the FAL. The reaction was performed at 190 °C for 20 min, and the FAL yield was as high as 99.5 %. A detailed kinetic analysis of the degradation process further confirms the superiority of the two-phase system (Li et al., 2017b). 3.2.2 Solid catalyst The difficulty of separating catalysts from products and environmental pollution problems has limited the research and development of liquid acid catalysts. Researchers have actively explored solid acid catalysts, including carbon-based catalysts, molecular sieves and macroporous resins. Under the action of a sulfonated carbon-based catalyst, cassava (5 % hemicellulose content) can be used to prepare FAL and HMF, and a clear biomass hydrolysis and dehydration is obtained. When the catalyst-to-cassava mass ratio is 0.005:1 and the solvent is a two-phase system (the mass ratio of organic matter to water is 1:9), the reaction obtain a 2.1 % FAL yield when performed at 250 °C for 1 min (Daengprasert et al., 2011). Molecular sieves are often used as catalysts to promote xylose to FAL, including HZSM-5, H-mordenite, HY, H-Beta, and SAPO molecular sieves. When the solvent is water, DMSO or a two-phase system and the molecular sieve is used as the catalyst, the FAL yield is 24–47 % (Lima et al., 2008; O’Neill et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011). While using ion exchange resins such as Nafion SAC-13, Nafion 117, Amberlyst-15 and Amberlyst-70 as catalysts, a moderate yield of FAL can be obtained, of approximately 40–70 % (Agirrezabal-Telleria et al., 2011; Lam et al., 2011). One research result shows that the mixed metal oxide catalyst (SO4 2−/ZrO2-TiO2) exhibits a better catalytic effect than the zeolite catalyst during the preparation of FAL (Zhang et al., 2012). The type of acidic sites (Brønsted acid and Lewis acid) and the amount in the solid acid catalyst are important factors for determining the reaction pathway. Using GVL as a solvent, HZSM-5 catalysed the preparation of FAL from corn cobs for a 71.68 % FAL yield. The Brønsted acidic sites in HZSM-5 zeolite play a vital role in the xylose dehydration process (Li et al., 2018). In a study on using SAPO molecular sieves as catalysts, higher FAL yields were obtained due to the presence of strong acidic sites (Bhaumik and Dhepe, 2013b). Using catalyst acidity as the focus of development, the novel solid acid catalyst PTSA-POM (Xu et al., 2015) (the copolymerization of p-toluenesulfonic acid and paraformaldehyde) was prepared, which is used to catalyse the production of FAL by using raw corn stalks. At 190 °C for 100 min, the yields of FAL and HMF are 83.5 % and 19.5 % respectively, and the catalyst cycle performance is better. This approach provides a new way to develop solid acid catalysts. Most of the catalysts reported in published articles have both strong and weak acidic sites. Table 3 shows the development of FAL synthesis from biomass waste in recent years."
8,Production of GVL from FAL,"3.3 Production of GVL from FAL FAL is a furan derivative. Converting FAL into high value-added energy chemicals is an important way to engage in the deep development and utilization of biomass resources (Chen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017; Shao et al., 2018). FAL and its derivatives can be used to produce diesel-based alkanes (Xing et al., 2010; Corma et al., 2011a, b; Alonso‐Fagúndez et al., 2012) and are also raw materials for preparing diesel, gasoline and aviation kerosene (Huber et al., 2005; Xing et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). FAL can be used to synthesize FA, which can be used to produce resins and as solvents. The above high-value long-chain alkane can be synthesized using a FA condensation reaction (Huber et al., 2005; Chareonlimkun et al., 2010). In addition, FAL can be methylolated to form HMF in the presence of formic acid (Lecomte et al., 1999). 3.3.1 Catalytic system In recent years, researchers have designed many different catalytic systems based on different raw materials. The reaction process for preparing GVL from FAL is as follows: the FAL is first hydrogenated to FA, which is then converted to levulinate ester, and finally the GVL is formed by a hydrogenation-cyclization series reaction. The entire reaction process is more complicated than the one using LA, and its ester is used as a raw material to prepare GVL and it has more stringent requirements for multifunctional catalysts (Antunes et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). The selection of a safe and effective hydrogen source and the preparation of multifunctional catalysts using non-precious metals are current research hotspots. 3.3.1.1 Precious metal catalyst Using FA as a raw material and sulfonic acid-functionalized ionic liquids as the solvent, GVL was prepared using a Ru/C catalyst for a yield of 94 %, and the catalyst could be recycled 5 times (Hengne et al., 2013). Some researchers have noted that combining the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction with the acid-catalysed hydrolysis step provides a feasible approach to producing GVL from FAL (Bui et al., 2013; Winoto et al., 2016). The MPV reaction indicates that the hydrogen donor reduces the FAL to FA through a transfer hydrogenation process, using the alcohol as the hydrogen source without the external hydrogen, and using the organometallic oxide/transition metal/acid or alkali-based oxide as a catalyst can contribute to how the reaction proceeds. Zhu et al. investigated the catalytic performance of a series of supported catalysts for the conversion of FAL to furfuryl alcohol. Using IPA as the hydrogen donor, Au/ZrO2 showed excellent catalytic activity, and the conversion of FAL and the yield of FA reached 100 % under 120 °C for 3.0 h. The multifunctional solid acid catalysts formed by the combination of Au/ZrO2 and HZSM-5 have an efficient synergistic effect for providing strong interfacial interactions and a large number of medium-strength Brønsted acidic sites, respectively. The yield of GVL prepared by FAL can reach 80.4 % through a plurality of reaction steps and a reaction time of 36 h. The related characterization confirmed that the uniform dispersion of Au particles on the surface of the ZrO2 carrier is the primary reason for the high hydrogen transfer ability of the catalyst (Zhu et al., 2016). The use of a solid acid catalyst facilitates the separation of the catalyst from the product while improving the cyclability of the catalyst, and it is more economical. Using alcohol instead of hydrogen as a hydrogen source enhances the economics of the reaction while improving its safety. 3.3.1.2 Non-precious metal catalyst Bui et al. (2013) compared the catalytic properties of a series of different β zeolite-containing metal atoms for the conversion of methyl levulinate in 2-butanol to prepare GVL (Fig. 10 ). The preferred Zr-β zeolite combines with a large pore-size Al-MFI-ns molecular sieve for the efficient catalytic conversion of FAL to GVL. In addition, it has been found that adding water within 5 wt% to the alcohol solvent is beneficial for increasing the GVL yield. The reaction pathways in this catalytic system can be summarized as follows: Under the influence of a Lewis acid, FAL is reduced to FA by MPV reaction and subsequently converted to FE. A Brønsted acid promotes the hydrolysis of the FE to form alkyl levulinate. In addition, a portion of the FE is converted to α-angelica lactone or β-angelica lactone, which is then hydrolysed to form alkyl levulinate. Finally, due to the presence of a Lewis acid, the alkyl levulinate undergoes an MPV reaction and a lactonization reaction to form GVL. The kinetic analysis of the reaction of methyl levulinate catalysed by H-Beta, Zr-Beta, Sn-Beta and Ti-Beta showed that the apparent activation energy of the reaction in the secondary alcohol was significantly lower than that of the corresponding primary alcohol, and during the catalytic cycle, the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups are simultaneously adsorbed on a single Lewis acid site (Luo et al., 2014). In recent studies using FAL to prepare GVL, Winoto et al. (2016) prepared a series of multifunctional Sn-Al-Beta zeolites with both Lewis acid and Brønsted acidic sites by adjusting the degree of dealumination and the tin content of the catalyst. With 2-butanol as the hydrogen donor, a nearly 60 % GVL yield was obtained. The team's latest research shows that Zr-Beta zeolite loaded with heteropolyacids effectively promotes transfer hydrogenation and ring opening reactions, resulting in high yields of GVL (70 %) (Winoto et al., 2019). Using IPA as the solvent, B. Srinivasa Rao et al. used β zeolite loaded with 5 % tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) and 20 % ZrO2 for FAL to prepare GVL at a yield of 85 % (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2019). In addition to the use of β zeolite, J. Iglesias et al. promoted the MPV reaction by adjusting the thickness of the ZrO2 on the SBA-15 and obtained a GVL yield of 37 % (Iglesias et al., 2018). Song et al. (2017) prepared meso-Zr-Al-β single zeolite mesoporous catalysts with multifunctional sites by dealumination, desiliconization and metal incorporation. In addition to the Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites, the classified mesopores were added to the catalysts, which enhanced the transfer and diffusion of intermediates and promoted the FAL cascade reaction to prepare GVL. A 95 % GVL yield was obtained at 393 K for 24 h. These researchers proposed a new perspective: A single zeolite catalyst containing multifunctional sites is better than combination catalyst systems. Recent studies have shown that different types of alcohols act as hydrogen donors with an effect on the GVL yield. Srinivasa Rao et al. (2019) prepared a solid acid catalyst supported on β zeolite with zirconia containing heteropolytungstate and compared the effect of different alcohols as hydrogen donors on the GVL yield. The results show that when IPA was used as hydrogen source, the researchers obtained a GVL yield of 85 % (IPA > 2-butanol > ethanol > methanol > n-propanol > n-butanol). We carried out a summary of the researches on GVL production from FAL, as shown in Table 4 ."
9,Application of lignin as a carrier in biomass degradation reactions,"Lignin is an amorphous polymer derived from the methoxypropanol structure and is the skeleton structure of the cell wall in plants. Lignification affects the dehydration of plant cell walls. The lignification intensity affects the compressive strength of the stems. In plant, lignin is related to water and nutrient transport (Gunnarsson et al., 2008). Lignin is present around the cellulose and affects the decomposition of cellulose. Cellulosic biomass limits its resource utilization progress due to its complex structure. At present, the degradation of lignin and the destruction of the cellulose crystal structure have become two major problems in the process of biomass energy utilization. Lignin contains a variety of functional groups that are capable of multiple reactions (Dafeng et al., 2005). Through modifications of lignin by physical blending or chemical reactions such as sulfonation, methylolation, phenolation, hydrogenolysis, propoxylation, esterification, amination, and graft copolymerization, the modified lignin is widely used in industry and agriculture, construction, mining and other fields. Lignin has the advantages of being renewable, degradable, and non-toxic. In recent years, a large number of studies have documented the application of lignin to the synthesis of epoxy resin (Cazacu et al., 2004; Khalil et al., 2011), adsorbents (Cazacu et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Sabino, 2010; Khalil et al., 2011), membrane materials (Baumberger et al., 1998; Lepifre et al., 2004; Ban et al., 2007), and agricultural fertilizers (Garrido-Herrera et al., 2009; Fernández-Pérez et al., 2010, 2011). Researches show that lignin can be an effective carrier for biomass conversion reactions. Jundong et al. applied a lignin-based solid acid catalyst to the hydrolysis of cellulose to obtain a reducing sugar yield of 44.2 % (Jundong and Linhuo, 2016). Hu et al. (2015) prepared lignin-based activated carbon fibres that were sulfonated and hydrothermally treated into a 1D solid acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of highly crystalline straw cellulose. The glucose selectivity reached 64 % while generating high value cellulose nanofibrils, at 150 °C and 5 atm and the catalyst showed good cyclability. Studies have shown that sulfur has marginal voids and exhibits extremely high activity when catalysing the reduction and oxidation of lignin. Han et al. used lignin as a carrier-loaded FeS to prepare a novel solid acid catalyst for the hydrolysis of cellulose to LA, and using GVL as a solvent, a 35.64 % LA yield was obtained at 185 °C for 120 min (Han et al., 2019). These findings provide a new approach to the full utilization of biomass based on GVL production."
10,Summary and prospects,"At present, many studies are based on the production of GVL from cellulose, hemicellulose and their derivatives. Many scholars continue to explore various multifunctional and stable high-efficiency catalysts, and they are constantly innovating catalytic systems to achieve high efficiency, safety, energy savings and environmental protection. In terms of catalysts, solid acid catalysts with hydrogenation and acid hydrolysis will gradually replace liquid catalysts in mainstream GVL production (Winoto et al., 2016; Srinivasa Rao et al., 2019). The use of non-precious metals and transition metals effectively reduces the dependence on precious metals (Yang et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015). The synergy between metals exerts surprisingly excellent effects. In recent years, bimetallic catalysts and multi-metal composite catalysts have emerged to improve the catalytic efficiency and catalyst stability (O’Neill et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). The Brønsted acid and Lewis acid in the catalyst were confirmed to alternate in the reaction series of the synthesized GVL, which has a synergistic catalytic effect (Kumar et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017a). The particle size of the catalyst and the metal dispersion on the surface of the carrier are also directions explored by scholars, and nanoscale particle size catalysts are attracting attention due to their high catalytic activity (Bui et al., 2013; Park et al., 2015). In addition, atomic-scale catalysts ensure that the metal will be sufficiently dispersed on the surface of the support (Sun et al., 2018b), which may create new possibilities within existing catalyst production. In addition, the following potential development opportunities for catalysts in GVL production are noted: (1) Selection of a template for complex catalysts for easy synthesis. (2) The use of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enhances the catalyst stability and carbon deposition resistance to improve cyclability. (3) Nanomaterials can be modified by nanoscale rods or nanosheets, which can artificially control the catalyst performance, catalyst-acid ratio of L/B and hydrophobic properties. (4) Synergistic acid-base bifunctional catalysts can be developed to explore new catalytic systems. (5) Photocatalytic or electrochemical catalysis can be used to achieve full selectivity and high efficiency in GVL production. In terms of the hydrogen supply, to avoid the high pressure and high cost associated with traditional direct hydrogenation (H2), scholars are constantly exploring new methods of indirect hydrogenation (hydrogen supply). At present, alcohols (Kuwahara et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2016) and formic acid (Deng et al., 2009; Son et al., 2014) are considered to be better hydrogen donors for the production of GVL by biomass derivatives, and hydrocarbons and ammonia are also possibilities. We hope that in addition to an efficient hydrogen supply, the hydrogen donor is stable in its given oxidation state, easy to separate from the product, non-toxic and harmless. For the multi-step conversion of biomass cellulose and hemicellulose based on GVL production, proper pretreatment is essential. The catalyst is preferably a solid acid catalyst with a high-efficiency acid hydrolysis and hydrogenation function, and it will be is easy to separate from the product. It is necessary to improve the orientation selectivity of the product, reduce the formation of unnecessary by-products, and use the external hydrogenation donor as a solvent to supply hydrogen while facilitating the separation and extraction of the product. In particular, the formation of formic acid during the hydrolysis of cellulose may become an important breakthrough point in the conversion of cellulose into a GVL during a one-pot process without external hydrogenation sources. Considering the full utilization of biomass components in GVL production, the development of lignin as a biomass carbon-based solid acid scarrier combined with a non-precious metal to form a small particle-size composite catalyst may become a new research direction."
