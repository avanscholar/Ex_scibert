0,Introduction,"As a novel and clean method to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution, photocatalysis has been widely used in many ways, which includes photocatalytic hydrogen/oxygen production [1–5], degradation of organic pollutants [6], CO2 reduction [7,8], and selective organic synthesis [9]. The species responsible for these photocatalytic reactions are electrons and holes separated from the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Excitons, i.e., bound electron-hole pairs, play a critical role in light emitting devices [10,11], optoelectronic detectors [12], and solar cell devices [13,14], but have long been neglected in photocatalysis [15–20]. It was reported that there are two pathways for the subsequent reaction of charge carriers [21]. The first process is electron transfer (type I), which gives rise to reactive species like OH, O2 −, etc. This process is widely accepted as the mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of organic molecules [22,23]. The second one is energy transfer process (type II) from triplet excitons to ground state oxygen (3O2) with singlet oxygen 1O2 as the product. As can be seen, the formation of triplet excitons is a prerequisite for the 1O2 production. Therefore, some organic dyes exhibiting large magnitude of triplet excitons were recognized as effective sensitizers for singlet oxygen 1O2, such as porphyrins [24], phthalocyanines [25], polypyrrole macrocycles [26], chlorin [27] and their derivatives etc. The formation of triplet excitons in turn needs the intersystem crossing from excited singlet state to the triplet state. Heavy atom effect (HAE) was reported to promote the intersystem crossing due to the enhanced spin-orbital coupling [28]. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of heavy metal cations and multidentate organic ligands are ideal structures in which organic molecules are maximally exposed to the heavy-atom effect. There are some reports about the energy transfer process of triplet excitons on MOFs [29–31], and some of them were applied to photodynamic therapy, which is a potential approach to cancer therapy. However, the choice of organic ligands is still concentrated on traditional porphyrins and the metals are limited to Zr [32–34], Hf [35,36], Gd [37] and some lanthanide metal [38]. It is of great significance to exploit other nonporphyrin based materials and enrich the MOFs systems as singlet oxygen 1O2 sensitizers. With that in mind, we choose the popular triazine and common phenyl carboxylic compound as the organic ligands and Bi as metal node. Bi-based inorganic compounds are widely used in photocatalysis and our group has demonstrated that some bismuth based MOFs possess photocatalytic properties [5,39]. In addition, the heavy atom effect of Bi has not been studied as far as we know. In this work, Bi3+ cations and tridentate ligands such as H3TATB (4,4′,4′'-s-triazine-2,4,6-triyl-tribenzoic acid) and H3BTC (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) (Fig. 1 ) form Bi-MOFs, Bi-TATB [40] and Bi-BTC [39], respectively. Upon excitation, the tridentate ligands in these Bi-MOFs are expected to reach their triplet excited states due to the heavy atom effect of the Bi3+ cations and hence induce the 3O2 → 1O2 intersystem crossing. The generated singlet oxygen is used to oxidize alcohol to aldehydes which displays excellent selectivity. It is the first time to solve photocatalytic problems in MOFs with the conception of excitons and we also provide alternative materials to generate singlet oxygen without traditional porphyrins MOFs."
1,Experiment section,
2,Synthesis of Bi-TATB,"2.1 Synthesis of Bi-TATB H3TATB (60.0 mg, 136.0 μmol) and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (57.4 mg, 118.4 μmol) were mixed in a mixture of DMF (6 mL) and MeOH (6 mL). After stirred for 30 min, the mixture was sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, kept at 130℃ for 44 h and then cooled down to room temperature at normal speed. The solid product was filtered off and washed with DMF (20 mL) and MeOH (20 mL). A white powder was obtained and then dried in air at 60℃."
3,Synthesis of Bi-BTC,"2.2 Synthesis of Bi-BTC Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.2360 g, 0.49 mmol) and H3BTC (0.1930 g, 0.92 mmol) were mixed in a mixture of DMF/MeOH (5 mL, 1:3). The solution was then sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated to 120℃ for 45 h, kept at this temperature for 12 h and then cooled down slowly at the rate of 2℃/min to room temperature. Colorless crystals were washed by DMF, methanol and then dried in air at 60℃."
4,Molecular oxygen activation measurements,"2.3 Molecular oxygen activation measurements In a typical test, 4 mg catalyst was dispersed into 1 mL aqueous solution by ultrasonic process, then 200 μL catalyst solution was added into 20 mL TMB solution. TMB solution was prepared by using HAc/NaAc buffer solution (pH = 4.00) as solvent and the concentration of TMB was 500 μM. The mixture was illuminated with O2 bubbling by using a xenon lamp (300 W) without cutoff filter as light source. The samples were taken at different time intervals for UV–vis measurements. The oxidation of TMB molecules was evaluated by monitoring the absorbance around 370 nm with a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The measurements were also performed under other gas environments (Ar and air). To verify the type of active oxygen species, different scavenger molecules were added into the solution prior to the UV–vis measurements: (1) carotene (20 mg); (2) mannite (50 mM, 1 mL); (3) catalase (4000 unit/mL, 1 mL); (4) superoxide dismutase (SOD, 5000 unit/mL, 1 mL)."
5,Electron spin resonance trapping measurements,"2.4 Electron spin resonance trapping measurements 12 mg samples was dispersed into 3 mL acetone. Then 500 μL suspension of samples was mixed with 5 mL of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP, 50 mM) solution. The O2 − and H2O2 trapping-ESR tests were performed in methanol and double-distilled water, using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO, 20 mM) as the spin-trapping agent. After being illuminated for 1.5 min (H3TATB, Bi-TATB) or being illuminated for 7 min (H3BTC, Bi-BTC), the mixture was characterized using a Bruker EMX plus model spectrometer operating at the X-band frequency (9.4 GHz) at room temperature. A xenon lamp (300 W) without cutoff filter was used as light source."
6,Alcohol photo-oxidation reactions,"2.5 Alcohol photo-oxidation reactions 20 mg of Bi-TATB or Bi-BTC, 20 μmol of alcohol compounds, and 20 mL n-hexane were placed in a two-neck quartz reactors. The catalytic oxidation reaction was kept at constant temperature (˜15 °C) with O2 bubbling under irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., LTD, China) without filter. The yield and type of the product was analyzed by GC–MS chromatography (GC-MS-QP2010, SH-Rtx-Wax column)."
7,Characterizations methods,"2.6 Characterizations methods X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations were carried out on a Bruker AXS D8 with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54178 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB MKII spectrometer. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photograph was measured by Hitachi S-4800. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were performed on a Shimadzu UV-2550 recording spectrophotometer, which was equipped with an integrating sphere and BaSO4 was used as a reference. A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer was applied to measure the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples at liquid nitrogen temperature, and the activation process was carried out at 150 ℃ for 5 h in vacuum. The steady-state fluorescence spectra and phosphorescence spectra were collected on Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer."
8,Results and discussion,"Bi-BTC was synthesized according to previous literature [39]. Bi-TATB was obtained via a solvothermal reaction at 130 °C, which is slightly different from the preparation method reported in the literature [40]. The XRD profiles of the as-synthesized Bi-BTC and Bi-TATB are given in Figure S1 and Fig. 2 a, which suggest that both of them were synthesized successfully. In Fig. 2a, the main peaks at 2θ = 6.6°, 8.6°and 11.3°, well match with the simulated results, and are in good accordance with the (210), (220) and (230) planes of Bi-TATB. The SEM images show Bi-BTC has an irregular bulk morphology (Figure S2), while Bi-TATB has a thick sheet morphology (Figure S3a). The corresponding elemental mapping further suggests that all elements (C, O, N and Bi) are uniformly distributed in Bi-TATB (Figure S3b-e). The XPS spectra of Bi-TATB displayed in Figure S3f show that it consists of C, O, N and Bi. Furthermore, no difference is observed between H3TATB and Bi-TATB with respect to the N 1s XPS spectra, suggesting that Bi does not coordinate with the N in the triazine ring. (Figure S4a). In contrast, the fitting curves of the O 1s XPS spectra (Figure S4b) show two peaks for H3TATB corresponding to the two different O atoms of a carboxyl group, -C(=O)OH, however, only one peak for Bi-TATB can be fitted, which indicates the coordination of Bi3+ with a carboxylate oxygen of TATB3− in Bi-TATB. The UV–vis absorption spectra measured for powder samples of H3TATB and Bi-TATB are compared in Fig. 2b with those of H3TATB molecules dissolved in aqueous NaOH solution in which H3TATB exists as individual monomers. The absorption of H3TATB powder has a broad shoulder at above ˜412 nm and is red shifted from that of H3TATB in solution (Fig. 2b). Such phenomenon is found for many planar molecules that aggregate by forming stacks of molecules in solid state [41]. The absorption edge of Bi-TATB, located at ˜380 nm, is blue-shifted with respect to the broad shoulder in the absorption spectrum of H3TATB powder. This indicates the absence of molecular stacking in Bi-TATB, as expected from the coordination of TATB3− with Bi3+ to form the MOF structure. Such absorption shifts have been observed in the NU and MIL series (e.g., NU-901, NU-1000, NH2-MIL-125) of MOFs [42,43]. Compared with the absorption spectrum of Bi-BTC with an absorption edge at ˜313 nm (Figure S5), Bi-TATB has a stronger absorption intensity and a wider range of visible light absorption. Photoluminescence behaviors of H3TATB, Bi-TATB, H3BTC and Bi-BTC were compared in Fig. 3 . The steady-state fluorescence spectra of H3TATB and Bi-TATB recorded at 293 K are shown in Fig. 3a, which reveals that both of them have a similar emission peak (˜467 nm). However, Bi-TATB displays a much lower intensity than does H3TATB. As the fluorescence arises from a radiative decay of singlet excitons [44], the lower intensity for Bi-TATB indicates that the population of the singlet excitons is lower. The time-resolved fluorescence spectra monitored at 467 nm (Fig. 3b) show that the average lifetime is slightly longer for H3TATB than for Bi-TATB (˜2.20 vs. ˜2.05 ns). Fig. 3c compares the phosphorescence spectra of H3TATB and Bi-TATB recorded at 77 K. Bi-TATB shows a strong phosphorescence emission peak at ˜500 nm, exhibiting a red-shift with respect to the fluorescence peak at 467 nm. This red-shift clearly indicates the existence of long-lived triplet excitons. The long lifetime 4.77 ms of Bi-TATB (Fig. 3d) further confirms that the emission is due to the triplet excitons. In contrast, H3TATB powder displays a very low emission in the visible light region of 500˜600 nm and a small peak-like feature at 629 nm, which may be ascribed to an instrument noise due to its poor emission. The dramatic difference in the phosphorescence intensities between Bi-TATB and H3TATB suggests that Bi-TATB produces much more triplet excitons than does H3TATB. The lifetime 14.83 μs of H3TATB further confirms the absence of triplet excitons in pure H3TATB. Considering the aggregation of H3TATB molecules in powder samples, similar experiments were carried out using H3TATB monomers dissolved in NaOH solution. As shown in Figure S6a, the maximum emission of H3TATB monomer is located at 429 nm with a shoulder at 313 nm. When the solvent is replaced with DMF, the emission peaks locate at 429 nm and 346 nm so that the peak at 429 nm should be ascribed to intrinsic emission of H3TATB. The average lifetime for the H3TATB monomer is determined to be ˜4.59 ns (Figure S6b). The phosphorescence spectra of the H3TATB monomer recorded at 77 K (Figure S6c) show that, at low temperature, the intrinsic emission is red-shifted to 465 nm with very low intensity. Combined with the short lifetime of 8.52 μs (Figure S6d), it is concluded that there is a small amount of triplet excitons in the H3TATB monomer. The above results show that the production of triplet excitons in H3TATB is really low regardless of H3TATB molecules are aggregated or not. In Bi-TATB, the TATB3− ligand produces a large quantity of triplet excitons compared with H3TATB, due most likely to the heavy-atom effect of the Bi3+ cations. To test if this result is also applicable to other Bi-MOFs, we carried out similar experiments for H3BTC and Bi-BTC. The steady-state fluorescence spectra of H3BTC and Bi-BTC at room temperature have already been reported in the literature [39]. H3BTC exhibits an intense emission at 410 nm, and Bi-BTC displays a red shift emission at 429 nm. The average lifetimes of H3BTC and Bi-BTC monitored at their emission peaks at room temperature (Figure S7) are slightly different (˜1.17 and ˜1.16 ns, respectively). The phosphorescence spectra recorded at 77 K (Fig. 3e) reveal that Bi-BTC exhibits a strong phosphorescence emission peak at ˜443 nm, which is red-shifted with respect to the fluorescence peak at 429 nm. In contrast, the phosphorescence intensity for H3BTC is so weak that its emission peak overlaps the instrument noise completely. Similarly, its lifetime cannot be measured indicating that it has a really short lifetime. The long phosphorescence lifetime of Bi-BTC (2.87 ms) further confirms the existence of long-lived triplet excitons (Fig. 3f). Note that the lifetime of Bi-BTC is shorter than that of Bi-TATB (2.87 vs. 4.77 ms). This may have an important consequence on the oxidation experiments (see below). Either for the H3TATB aggregation powder, H3TATB monomer or H3BTC, the production of triplet excitons is negligible. While with the presence of Bi atom, triplet excitons are generated substantially. From above results, we can get the conclusion that for these Bi-MOFs, it is easier to reach their triplet excited states due to the heavy atom effect of the Bi3+ cations. Singlet oxygen 1O2, a mild yet efficient oxidant [45], has proven to be a versatile reactive oxidizing species with applications in various organic transformations [46], fluorescent probe [47,48] and photodynamic therapy [49]. On the basis of the photoluminescence results discussed above, we expect that both Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC can induce the 3O2→1O2 conversion (hereafter referred to as the activation of molecular oxygen). To investigate the nature of this activation of molecular oxygen, we first examine the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) under UV-vis irradiation in the presence of Bi-TATB or Bi-BTC. As shown in Figure S8, the partially oxidized product of TMB can be monitored by studying its optical absorption at around 370 and 652 nm. As illustrated in Fig. 4 a, the continuous increase in the absorption at 370 and 652 nm clearly indicates the photocatalytic oxidation of TMB molecules induced by Bi-TATB under UV–vis irradiation. To probe what species are needed for the TMB oxidation, we carried out experiments with Bi-TATB under different gases and monitored the oxidation results by examining the absorption peak at 370 nm. Fig. 4b shows that the amount of oxidation products under Ar is far less than those under air and O2. This suggests that the active species for the TMB oxidation arises from the activation of molecular oxygen. We obtain similar results using Bi-BTC, namely, Bi-BTC can oxidize TMB molecules by the activation of oxygen molecules (Fig. 4c-d). According to the absorbance values, the amount of the oxidation products induced by Bi-BTC is smaller than that by Bi-TATB. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the activation of molecular oxygen can be superoxide radical (O2 −), hydroxyl radical ( OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and singlet oxygen (1O2). To identify which one of these species is involved, we carried out the TMB oxidation experiments in the presence of various scavengers, namely, superoxide dismutase (SOD) for superoxide radical (O2 −), mannitol for hydroxyl radical ( OH), catalase for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and carotene for singlet oxygen (1O2). Fig. 4e shows that carotene suppresses the TMB oxidation by Bi-TATB (˜29.25%), while other scavengers have negligible effects. This suggests that 1O2 is the major photogenerated reactive oxygen species. For Bi-BTC (Fig. 4f), the inhibiting effect of carotene is much higher (˜68.31%) showing that 1O2 is the dominant photogenerated species. The TMB oxidation experiments were also carried out in the presence of H3TATB and H3BTC powders using different scavengers (Fig. 4g, h). In the case of H3TATB powder, both carotene and catalase suppress the TMB oxidation more effectively than the other scavengers, showing that both 1O2 and H2O2 are the major oxidizing species (Fig. 4g). In the case of H3BTC powder, all scavengers have a similar effect, showing that all oxidizing species are involved in the TMB oxidation (Fig. 4h). In addition, the TMB oxidation in the presence of H3TATB monomers shows that all reactive oxygen species play a role in the oxidation (Figure S9). To further verify that the presence of a heavy-atom such as Bi in MOFs can induce the 3O2 → 1O2 conversion, we replace the Bi atom by Co atom to form a Co4O(TATB)8/3 MOFs [50], in which the organic ligand is still TATB3−. The XRD patterns in Figure S10a confirm that it is synthesized successfully. The experiments to find reactive oxygen species (Figure S10b) in Co4O(TATB)8/3 MOFs were performed under the same conditions as described above, showing that both carotene and catalase can suppress the TMB oxidation. This result is similar to that for the H3TATB powder samples. Namely, in the absence of the heavy-atom effect, 1O2 is not a dominant reactive oxygen species. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were carried out to gain more direct proofs for the photogenerated reactive oxygen species. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) is employed as the trapping agents for 1O2, the oxidation process of which is shown in Figure S11. As illustrated in Fig. 5 a, a 1:1:1 triplet signal with g-value of 2.0056 occurs in the presence of Bi-TATB, which can be indexed to the generation of 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO). In the presence of carotene, this signal is greatly suppressed, further indicating that the reactive oxygen species is 1O2. For Bi-BTC, similar results are obtained (Fig. 5b). The other possible oxidant such as O2 −, OH and H2O2 that may be formed during the photocatalytic process were further investigated using ESR spectra. As can be seen in Figure S12, the characteristic signal of O2 − and H2O2 can be found in the presence of organic ligand, i.e. H3TATB and H3BTC. In contrast, no obvious signal can be detected under the same conditions when H3TATB and H3BTC are replaced by Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC. These results excludes the formation of O2 −, OH and H2O2. The presence of Bi suppresses the generation of O2 − and H2O2 and singlet oxygen 1O2 is the only active oxygen product over Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC. In view of the high selectivity and efficiency for 1O2 generation, Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC are expected to be a promising photocatalyst for selective oxidation reactions involving 1O2. We employ the selective alcohol oxidation reaction to aldehyde, to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC, which has been widely studied due to the crucial role in the synthesis of fine chemicals and intermediates [51], to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC. There are two issues to consider, i.e., selectivity and activity. The selectivity is measured by the ratio of the yield of aldehyde to the overall conversion of alcohol to all possible oxidized products. The activity of 1O2 is the amount of aldehyde generated. Table 1 summarizes the conversion rate and selectivity for the oxidation of a series of alcohols. (The yields and identities of the oxidized products of alcohols were determined by gas chromatography as discussed in the supporting information). For Bi-TATB, benzyl alcohol was partly oxidized with a conversion of 37.59% in 5 h, but the selectivity for aldehyde is close to 100%, namely, no other oxidized product such as carboxylic acid is found. The GC patterns of specific oxidation process are shown in Figure S13. The effect of substitutions on the aromatic ring was further studied. The selectivity is much higher for the electron withdrawing substituent (-NO2 and -Cl) compared with the electron donating substituent (−CH3). In contrast, the conversion efficiency increases with increasing the electron donating ability of the substituent. Under an inert atmosphere or in the absence of Bi-TATB, only a trace amount of products is obtained, suggesting that the presence of oxygen molecules and catalysts are both needed. In contrast, the selectivity of Bi-BTC is almost 100% regardless of the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring. However, Bi-BTC leads to a very poor conversion rate even after a much longer reaction time. This means that, for Bi-BTC, the amount of 1O2 produced in the photocatalytic process is much smaller than that for Bi-TATB. It is of interest to consider why Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC are different in their selectivity and activity. Our ROS measurements (Fig. 4e-f) show that 1O2 is a dominating species for Bi-BTC compared with other reactive species. A poor activity of Bi-BTC compared with that of Bi-TATB means that the quantity of 1O2 generated by Bi-BTC is far smaller than that by Bi-TATB, only about a tenth. Why is there a large difference on the quantities of 1O2 generated by the two Bi-MOFs? The probable reason can be as follows. First, compared with Bi-TATB, Bi-BTC has much smaller surface area (7.27 m2 g−1) than that of Bi-TATB (151.73 m2 g−1) as shown in Figure S14. Therefore, less active site for Bi-BTC are exposed to 3O2 resulting in decreased generation of 1O2. Second, Bi-TATB absorbs more photons than does Bi-BTC (Figure S5), so there are more excitons in the excited state of Bi-TATB. Last, the triplet excitons have a longer lifetime in Bi-TATB than in Bi-BTC (4.77 vs.2.87 ms), which means triplet excitons exist for a longer period of time in Bi-TATB and hence can convert more 3O2 into 1O2. To check the stability of Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC, four cycles of photocatalytic oxidation were carried out using benzyl alcohol as a representative. As shown in Table 2 , both Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC display a decrease in selectivity since the third cycle, however, the selectivity still remains at a high level, larger than 85%. Meanwhile, the conversion efficiency gradually increases from the third cycle, which means by-products start to be produced. The reason is due to the partial collapse of the MOFs framework structure, as indicated by the XRD patterns after the fourth cycle. (Figure S15) The main peaks of Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC are preserved, however, the peak intensity decreases to some extent. This result implies that part of the framework structure collapses under mechanical stirring. This further emphasize the significant role of Bi in promoting the formation of singlet oxygen and the resulting high selectivity of photo-oxidation of benzyl alcohol to aldehyde."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, we examined the heavy-atom effect of the Bi3+ cations in Bi-TATB and Bi-BTC on the singlet → triplet intersystem crossing of the excited states of their organic ligands TATB3− and BTC3−. This intersystem crossing induces the 3O2 → 1O2 conversion, and the resulting singlet oxygen 1O2 oxidizes benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with high selectivity and activity under UV–vis light irradiation in the presence of Bi-TATB. Compared with Bi-TATB, Bi-BTC has a poor activity because the amount of 1O2 produced is much smaller for Bi-BTC than for Bi-TATB. Our work provides an alternative approach toward selective organic synthesis."
