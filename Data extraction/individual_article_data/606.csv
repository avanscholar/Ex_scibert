0,Introduction,"Conventional fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum have fulfilled the world’s energy requirements for decades. Researchers have explored the various renewable biomasses in the world owing to reduce the use of conventional fuels (Dhyani & Bhaskar, 2018). Depletion of fossil fuels in past decades have resulted in the release of greenhouse gases to the environment. Bio-energy have emerged as a promising way to full fill the energy requirements of the world in the present and in near future (Çolak et al., 2018). Various techniques are been explored by the researchers across the globe for production of valuable gas, bio-oil and solid residue from different biomasses. Microalgae was the eco-friendly and economical biomass which in turn reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions when converted to biofuels. Microalgae requires small land and it grows by consuming organic pollutants from wastewater (Chiaramonti et al., 2017). Microalgae captures CO2 from environment and converts into valuable bio-energy products. Bio-ethanol, biodiesel and bio-oil are the preferred biofuels produced from microalgae biomass. Bio-oil has a promising advantage that it can be used in existing engines without any modifications (Demirbas, 2007). Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), pyrolysis and gasification are the common thermo-chemical conversion processes used for biofuel production from various biomasses (Durak & Genel, 2018). Pyrolysis and gasification processes need high energy input but HTL needs less input energy. HTL can process both dried and moisture biomass but pyrolysis can process only dried biomass (Arun et al., 2019a; Durak & Aysu, 2014). HTL process converts wet biomass into valuable products like liquid hydrocarbons, bio-char and gaseous products. Also, the bio-oil needs to be upgraded into enriched hydrocarbons in order to be used in transportation vehicles (Koike et al., 2016). HTL needs less input energy and it can convert wet biomass into biofuels. HTL experiments can be completed within one hour and recent study with human feces resulted in 34.44% of bio-oil yield with calorific value of 40.29 MJ/kg (Lu et al., 2017). Catalyst usage in liquefaction process increases the bio-oil yield with less solid residue formation (Muppaneni et al., 2017). Another study with usage of heterogeneous catalyst for liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass results in enhanced bio-oil and gaseous products formation (Durak & Genel, 2020a). Recent studies reveal that researchers have turned their interest towards usage of novel for waste to energy conversion process. Bio-gas composition and yield can be increased from wet biomass in presence of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts (Si et al., 2019). Expensive catalysts have negative impact on biofuel production hence catalysts are derived from renewable wastes. The water gas shift reaction was enhanced by alkali catalysts resulting in increased hydrogen yield (Gökkaya et al., 2019). Alkali catalysts like potassium hydroxide (KOH) (Wu et al., 2019) and Al2O3 (Durak & Genel, 2020b) increased the bio-oil yield. Gasification was the clean way to convert biomass in to syngas containing mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane gas. In presence of alkali catalyst the wet biomass gasification results in enhanced hydrogen gas yield (Veraa & Bell, 1978). Gasification of biomass was performed at higher temperatures in presence of metal catalysts to meet energy demand (Watson et al., 2018). Bio-char obtained from catalytic liquefaction process can be used for syngas production. To best our knowledge there has been no study on catalytic liquefaction of biomass with economical, eco-friendly and cheapest catalyst derived from waste (clam shells). The novelty of this study was to use the catalyst derived from clam shells for enriched hydrocarbon (bio-oil) production and use the solid residue obtained from HTL for synthesis of hydrogen through gasification process. HTL was performed at varying temperature range from 240 to 320 °C for catalyst load of (1–5 wt%) with reaction time of 60 min. The bio-oil and aqueous wastewater of HTL process was analysed through Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrophotometry (GCMS). Researchers have explored the application of solid residue as adsorbent in wastewater treatment and as catalyst in various process. The main purpose of this study was to perform hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae biomass in presence of catalyst derived from waste clamshells. The solid residue obtained as by-product from HTL process was used as catalyst for hydrogen production through gasification process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biomass cultivation and characterization,"2.1 Biomass cultivation and characterization Scenedesmus obliquus used in this study was obtained from National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India. The microalgae biomass was cultivated in mixotrophic mode using wastewater (80% v/v) and BG-11 medium (20% v/v) in photo bio-reactor (PBR) for a period of 15 days. Microalgae biomass growth was measured through UV spectrophotometer at 680 nm. After the cultivation period the biomass was harvested and characterized. The moisture content (ASTM, 2006) and ash content (ASTM, 1995) were analysed as per ASTM standards. The elemental analysis was estimated using elemental analyser (Perkin-Elmer 2400 series CHNS analyser). Thermo-gravimetric analyser (TGA) was performed to depict the pyrolytic behaviour of the biomass under nitrogen environment. The biomass (10 mg) was heated at varying heating rates (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 °C/min) from 25 to 800 °C (Chong et al., 2017)."
3,Clam shells (Ca(OH2) as economical catalyst,"2.2 Clam shells (Ca(OH2) as economical catalyst Economical and eco-friendly catalyst was synthesised using Clam shells collected near sea shore temple at Mahabalipuram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. After cleaning using running tap water the shells were dried using hot air oven at a temperature of 200 °C for a time period of 11 h to increase its brittleness (Kao et al., 2018). The dried clam shells were powdered using ball mill and sieved to fine size. The calcination of clam shells were performed at 800 °C for 2 h (El Haddad et al., 2014). After calcination process about 37 g of calcined powder was added to 650 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl). To this mixture 650 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added and mixed vigorously under room conditions for 30 min (Narayan et al., 2018). The solution gets turbid and the calcium hydroxide (Ca (OH)2) gets precipitated in it. The calcium hydroxide was washed using distilled water and dried using hot air oven at a temperature of 110 °C for a time period of 4 h. The obtained calcium hydroxide was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and used as catalyst in hydrothermal liquefaction process."
4,Hydrothermal liquefaction process,"2.3 Hydrothermal liquefaction process The Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass was performed in a high pressure autoclave reactor (4598, Parr reactor) with 250 mL capacity equipped with temperature and auto cooling controller. The residues in the reactor were removed with water at 400 °C for 4 h before performing the experiments. Biomass of 15 g was liquefied with 200 mL of water at a temperature range of 240 °C–320 °C for reaction time of 60 min. The HTL reactor was mixed at 720 rpm under nitrogen environment (5 MPa). The effect of synthesized catalyst (Ca(OH)2) on bio-oil production at varying load (0.2–1 wt%) was studied. After the experiments the heating unit was switched off and cooling was initiated in order to recover the products. Before reactor dismantling the gaseous products were collected and analysed. The dark slurry bio-crude oil was recovered from the HTL reactor and subjected to bio-oil extraction."
5,Bio-oil extraction and solid residue recovery,"2.4 Bio-oil extraction and solid residue recovery The bio-crude oil obtained from the catalytic liquefaction process was subjected to bio-oil extraction and solid residue recovery. Dichloromethane (DCM) was used as solvent for extraction of bio-oil rich in hydrocarbons from the bio-crude. The excess DCM in the bio-oil was removed using rotary evaporator. The bio-oil was the organic phase consists of enriched hydrocarbons whereas the aqueous wastewater comprises of acid components and low molecular weight compounds (Arun et al., 2019b). The bio-oil yield and higher heating value (HHV) were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) Bio - oil yield (wt\%) = Mass of bio - oil yield (g) Mass of algae biomass (g) × 100 (2) HHV MJ/Kg = 0.338 ∗ C + 1.428 ∗ H - O/8 Bio-oil was analysed using gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 GC) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID). Helium gas was used as carrier gas with flow rate of 1 mL/min. The initial temperature of column was 40 °C and increased to 250 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and held at final temperature for 5 min. The mass detection was performed at scanning range of 12–550 m/z with electron energy 70 eV (Rajan et al., 2019). The left over solid residue was collected and used for further studies."
6,Hydrothermal gasification using solid residue as catalyst,"2.5 Hydrothermal gasification using solid residue as catalyst The solid residue recovered after bio-oil extraction was rich in carbon and it comprises of the left over catalyst (Ca(OH)2). The novelty of this study was to use this solid residue as catalyst in hydrothermal gasification process for bio-hydrogen energy production. Hydrothermal gasification (HTG) process was performed in a stainless steel reactor (4575, Parr) equipped with auto stirrer and temperature controller system. Microalgae biomass (15 g) was gasified with varying load of solid residue (1–5 wt%) under varying temperature range (280–420 °C) for a reaction time of 60 min. The reactor was subjected to continuous mixing at 1000 rpm under nitrogen environment (5 MPa). After gasification process the heating unit was switched off and allowed to cool down using running tap water. The gaseous products were collected and characterized using GC (Gas Chromatography) equipped with two Thermal Conductivity Detectors (TCD) detectors. Helium gas was used as carrier gas and oven temperature was held at 60 °C isothermally for 60sec, then raised to 80 °C with a rate of 20 °C/min and then raised to 120 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min and held at final temperature for 3 min (Gökkaya et al., 2019). The DCM was added to extract bio-oil from the slurry obtained from gasification process."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Biomass characterization,"3.1 Biomass characterization Microalgae (S. obliquus) was cultivated from wastewater and used for hydrothermal liquefaction and gasification experiments (Arun et al., 2017). From Fig. 1 increase in wastewater ratio (upto 80%) increased the biomass growth. About 3.7 g/L of microalgae was harvested from wastewater (80%) and BG-11 medium (20%) during the photo period of 15 days. The organic nutrients in wastewater were effectively consumed by microalgae during growth period. The COD, PO4 and NH3 in the wastewater were reduced to a greater extent (85.32%, 84.26% and 89.14%) during the cultivation period. The quality of desired product depends upon the composition of biomass. The carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen content of biomass were 54.12 wt%, 7.82 wt%, 6.94 wt%, 0.46 wt% and 30.66 wt% respectively. The moisture, ash content and HHV value of biomass were 9.53 wt%, 6.12 wt% and 23.98 MJ/Kg respectively. HHV value of biomass depends upon the biomass composition (Kaur et al., 2020). The H/C and O/C ratios of biomass were found to be 1.73 and 0.42 respectively. The thermal stability of biomass was analysed through thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), in accordance with existing literature (Rout et al., 2016). TGA was carried out at a broad temperature range of (25 °C–800 °C) in order to determine the pyrolytic temperature for the experiments and shown in Fig. 2 . The moisture content were removed below 200 °C and the degradation of organic components occurred between 200 °C and 600 °C. The weight at 600 °C after TGA was 26.3, 24.8, 23.9, 23.1 and 23.4% for heating rates of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 °C/min respectively. Similarly, SundarRajan et al. (2020) also reported Scenedesmus abundans had a maximum weight loss after 600 °C of 22.1% at a heating rates of 50 °C/min."
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization The clam shells were used as catalyst for biomass liquefaction. The surface and morphology of the synthesized Ca(OH)2) particles were analysed using SEM images. From the images it was seen that the synthesized catalyst exhibits the agglomerating tendency and therefore can be used for liquefaction experiments. The particle size was found to be 40 nm with surface area of 42 m2/g respectively. These clam shells based catalyst are eco-friendly, economically cheaper and non-toxic in nature. These novel catalysts provides a pathway for waste resource utilization towards valuable products synthesis process."
10,Hydrothermal liquefaction,"3.3 Hydrothermal liquefaction 3.3.1 Effect of temperature on bio-oil yield This part deals with the composition and yield of bio-oil from liquefied microalgae biomass. Four major products are obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction process: bio-oil, solid residue, gaseous product and aqueous wastewater. Effect of temperature on bio-oil yield was studied at varying temperatures from 240 to 320 °C for 60 min reaction time. From Fig. 3 it was seen that the maximum bio-oil yield was 28.56 wt% at a temperature of 300 °C for a reaction time of 60 min. The gas phase yield was 25.23 wt% with wide range of gaseous products like carbon dioxide (31.2), carbon monoxide (26.1) and hydrogen (18.6) respectively. Incomplete degradation or solvent deficiency during the liquefaction process leads to solid residue formation. The aqueous wastewater obtained can be used in bio-gas production (Chen et al., 2016) and as a solvent in HTL processes (Hu et al., 2018). From the results it can be suggested that HTL was the promising technique to convert any type of feedstock into hydrocarbon rich bio-oil. Similar studies have been reported recently such as SundarRajan et al. (2020) reported that liquefaction of Scenedesmus abundans resulted in 35.5 wt% of bio-oil yield at a reaction temperature of 350 °C. Nannochloropsis liquefaction resulted in 31.4 wt% of bio-oil and 5.3 wt% of bio-char yield at a reaction temperature of 250 °C (Tang et al., 2020). HTL of Chlorella vulgaris biomass produced bio-oil of 41.1 wt% and 5.2 wt% of bio-char at reaction temperature of 350 °C and pressure of 17 MPa (Palomino et al., 2020). The exact mechanism of the HTL process is difficult to depict but it comprises of major reactions like oxidation, substitution, addition, etc. HTL at subcritical temperature conditions lead the breakdown of higher molecular weight compounds into low molecular weight compounds. At moderate operating conditions (temperature <300 °C) hydrogenation reaction occurs and increase in temperature beyond 300 °C triggers the deoxygenation reaction (Mukundan et al., 2020). 3.3.2 Effect of catalyst on bio-oil yield The ability of synthesized catalyst on bio-oil yield was studied at varying catalyst load (0.2–1 wt%) for 15 g of biomass at a temperature of 300 °C. From Fig. 4 it was depicted that the catalyst load had a significant effect on bio-oil yield at 300 °C. The bio-oil yield increased to 39.6 wt% at a catalyst load of 0.6 wt% and further increase in catalyst load (1 wt%) reduced the bio-oil yield to 37.1 wt% respectively. Bio-oil at catalyst load of 0.6 wt% possessed calorific value of 35.01 MJ/kg. The gas phase yield was 32.47 wt% with wide range of gaseous products like carbon dioxide (31.2 wt%), carbon monoxide (26.1 wt%), hydrogen (18.6 wt%) and ammonia (22.5 wt%), respectively. The solid residue yield was 13.2 wt% with 71.42 wt% of carbon content in it. The reduction in solid residue recovery at higher temperatures would have been due to loss of some portion in the walls of the reactor. Increase in temperature above 300 °C, the gaseous products formation increased and hence the bio-oil yield gets decreased (Jayakishan et al., 2019)."
11,HTL products characterization,"3.4 HTL products characterization The composition of bio-oil was characterized through GCMS to reveal its wide range of compounds. The results indicate that presence of catalyst would have reduced the aqueous wastewater formation due to the reactions like deamination and decarboxylation. Major compounds like phenolics, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, etc were detected in bio-oil. The GC–MS of bio-oil obtained from catalyst load of 0.6 wt% consists of hydrocarbons (72%), esters (4%) and oxyacids (25%) respectively. Few nitrogen and sulphur containing compounds were also detected in the bio-oil. The DCM peak in the GC–MS graph was negligible suggesting it was efficiently removed from bio-oil. Majority of compounds (hexadecanoic acid, octadecane, heptadecane, etc) detected would have originated from lipids in the biomass. The compounds like 4-methyl-, phenol in the bio-oil would have come from protein or carbohydrate molecule in biomass (Torri et al., 2012). Decrease in hydrocarbons and increase in oxyacids were seen at higher catalyst load (5 wt%). This may be due to the decomposition of low molecular weight hydrocarbons into gaseous molecules. The intermediate products (phenols, acids, etc) of biomass liquefaction promotes the decomposition of protein molecules. Temperature and catalyst are the key factors favouring the reactions like condensation, aromatization and cyclization. A large amount of aliphatic hydrocarbons within the range of C11- C18 was seen in bio-oil. The nitrogen containing alkanes like hexadecanamide and octadecanamide were also detected in smaller proportions. GC–MS analysis of bio-oil obtained from non-cataytic reactions revealed the presence of octadecanenitrile and hexadecanenitrile. This would have been due to the improper hydro-denitrogenation of biomass. The HTL aqueous wastewater comprised of low molecular weight acid compounds (polyols, organic acids, etc). The aqueous wastewater comprised chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 102.6 mg/L and pH of 5.9 respectively. The degradation of biomass and sugar molecules resulted in formation of these compounds. The HTL aqueous wastewater was used as HTL reaction medium and also for biomass pre-treatment due to their acidic nature (Cen et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2018). The solid residue yield was 13.3 wt% and it composed carbon (86.7 wt%), hydrogen (7.2 wt%), nitrogen (0.8 wt%) and oxygen (4.8 wt%) respectively. The surface area, pore size of bio-char was measured using Brunauer- Emmett- Teller (BET) analysis. The surface area and pore volume of bio-char was found to be 0.58 m2/g and 0.13 respectively. From the results it was depicted that the presence of porous structures in the surface makes them as a potential candidate for adsorption and catalyst studies (Norouzi et al., 2016; Pirbazari et al., 2019)."
12,Catalyst reusability,"3.5 Catalyst reusability 3.5.1 Hydrothermal gasification Recycling and reuse of catalyst plays an economical role in the liquefaction process. In general solid residue was activated and used as adsorbent for wastewater treatment. The solid residue with left over catalyst obtained from the HTL process was used in gasification process for bio-hydrogen production. Gasification of microalgae biomass (15 g) was carried out under varying temperature range (280–420 °C) for a time of 60 min. From the results it was seen that the gaseous products yield increased to 41.8 wt% at a temperature of 400 °C from 29.4 wt% at a temperature of 200 °C respectively. Increase in gas phase formation would have been attributed due to decomposition of low molecular weight hydrocarbons in bio-oil. Increase in gas products formation would have also been due to steam reforming reactions and water gas shift reactions. Effect of varying catalyst load (1–5 wt%) on bio-hydrogen yield at 400 °C was studied and shown in Fig. 5 . From fig 0.5 it was seen increased in catalyst load to 3 wt% resulted in maximum hydrogen gas yield of 37 wt% and it gets reduced to 34.2 wt% for catalyst load of 5 wt% respectively. Presence of catalyst increases the hydrogen gas yield with less solid residue formation. Hydrogen gas production from biomass was the most feasible and promising technique (Monir et al., 2020). Similarly, gasification of poplar wood with Ru/AC as catalyst increased the hydrogen sag yield to 20.2 mol/kg C at a reaction temperature of 600 °C. Another study was reported with hydrogen yield of 89.13% when alkaline-bio-char was used as catalyst (Ma et al., 2017). Multiple reactions like pyrolysis, hydrolysis, methanation, water gas shift and steam reforming are involved in gasification process (Vo et al., 2020). The overall biomass gasification process was elaborated in Eq. (3). (3) C H a O b + 2 - b H 2 O → C O 2 + 2 - b + a 2 H 2 where, a and b corresponds to the molar ratios of H/C and O/C, respectively. The other intermediate reactions responsible for gasification process apart from Eq. (3) are as follows. Water gas shift reaction was depicted in Eq. (4). (4) CO + H 2 O ↔ C O 2 + H 2 ( Δ H = - 41 K J / m o l ) Methanation reaction was depicted in Eq. (5). (5) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 4 + H 2 O Steam reforming reaction was depicted in Eq. (6). (6) C H x O y + 1 - y H 2 O → C O + 1 - y + x 2 H 2 The exact reaction mechanism pathway for gasification process was quite difficult to depict since interaction of components within the biomass during the gasification process was complex in nature."
13,Conclusion,"The use of novel catalyst derived from clam shells in catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae (Scenedesmus obliquus) resulted in hydrocarbon rich bio-oil yield. The maximum bio-oil yield was 39.6 wt% at a temperature of 300 °C for catalyst load of 0.6 wt% at a reaction time of 60 min with HHV value of 35.01 MJ/kg. Solid residue obtained from HTL was used as catalyst in gasification process for hydrogen production. Water-gas shift, methanation and steam reforming reactions resulted in maximum hydrogen gas production of 37 wt% at a reaction temperature of 400 °C with solid residue of 3 wt%."
