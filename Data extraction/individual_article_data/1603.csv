0,Introduction,"Liquid bio-fuels, such as bioethanol and biodiesel, have gotten a lot of attention because of the global need for fuel efficiency, environmental quality, and energy security. Brazil and the United States are the world's most powerful industrial players, accounting for 87 percent of worldwide biofuel output and relying heavily on government assistance (Welfle, 2017). Bioethanol production is one of the most important industries in the present environment, and it will continue to grow in significance in the next years, owing to the high demand for ethanol in both the local and worldwide markets. Bioethanol substitution for at least a portion of petroleum-based fuels, which is especially important for growing countries like India and in the future where current petroleum-based fuels are depleted. Ethanol is a less polluting fuel that also provides comparable efficiency at a lower cost than gasoline. The roadmap for ethanol blending was recently released in India, and according to it, a successful 20% ethanol blending (E20) programme can save the country's economy up to $ 4 B/a (Sarwal et al., 2021). Sugarcane molasses is the primary source of bioethanol in India; however, it is insufficient to meet the 20% blending objective (Konde et al., 2021). Diversifying feedstocks, particularly the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass and other low-cost sources such as livestock farm waste-based technologies for domestic ethanol production in the blending sectors, is necessary in this respect. Many agricultural waste-based residues such as wheat straw (Lantz et al., 2018); banana stem (Gupta et al., 2019); sugarcane bagasse (Janke et al., 2019); sweet sorghum (Mathur et al., 2017); jackfruit (Nurianaa and Wuryantoro, 2015) and weeds such as Saccharum spontaneum (Scordia et al., 2010), Typha latifolia (Kim et al., 2008), Eicchornia crassipes (Manivannan and Narendhirakannan, 2015), Prosopis juliflora (Sivarathnakumar et al., 2019), Lantana camara (Kuhad et al., 2010) etc. are utilized to produce bioethanol. In addition, producing bioethanol from animal waste at the same time is a cost-effective alternative to petroleum-based chemicals that should be promoted. It has the potential to lead to a multi-layered, complete use of biological waste from animal farms in the future, therefore increasing the value of biological resources in India today. Excreta from livestock has been found to be a viable source of bioethanol in various studies. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can efficiently ferment crude hydrolysates in 6 h, Vancob et al. (2015) were able to produce 7.3 g/L ethanol from feedlot cow dung. Yan et al. (2018) found that utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, they could generate ethanol from pre-treatment and anaerobically digested cow dung with yields of 0.19 and 0.13 g/g-raw biomass, respectively. Woldesenbet et al. (2013) looked at the possibilities of utilizing poultry manure in an anerobic fermentation method to make bioethanol. Pigs (Sus scrofa) are monogastric livestock with a wide range of feeding preferences, since they may consume a variety of traditional foods that are high in carbohydrate, protein, lipid, and fibre. However, as compared to the feed provided, the carbohydrate digestibility, absorption, and assimilation in pigs is lower (Knudsen et al., 2016). As a result, the majority of the carbohydrates in the pig feed were wasted in the faeces. This carbohydrate produced in pig excreta may simply be used as a pre-treatment to get the highest concentration of fermentable sugars when employing anaerobic yeast. The goal of this study is to evaluate and validate anaerobic digestion utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce bioethanol from pig excreta. We also wanted to analyze the bioethanol in terms of purity and retention periods using gas chromatography (GC); chemical structure using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR); and also, to study their antibacterial property. The current work used piggery excreta as an alternative source of bioethanol synthesis, similar to other domestic animals' excreta (Vancob et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2018; Cheong et al., 2019). As a result, this research along with further assessment of different scientific parameters might pave the way for large-scale use of piggery excreta to produce pure bioethanol, which could be used in a variety of applications such as alternative biofuels, blending mixes, antiseptic/antimicrobial agents, and so on. In addition, utilizing piggery excreta to create bioethanol might be a useful waste management strategy for decreasing pollution and global warming caused by improper piggery waste management."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Fresh Pig (Sus scrofa) excreta samples were collected from the Institutional Livestock Farm Complex, Piggery shed, Veterinary College Hassan, Karnataka, India. The pig excreta obtained in the current study was collected from the pigs fed with the ration of concentrates like 45% maize, 30% wheat bran, 23% soyabean meal, 2% mineral mixture and 0.5% common salt as well as allowed to drink water albidum. Collected samples were subjected for filtering of all impurities like mud, stone particles etc. followed by examination of pH. Samples were processed same day without preservation. All the chemicals used in the current study are of Analytical grade and are obtained from NICE Chemicals Pvt Ltd., India. The samples were analyzed for GC and 1H NMR by Robust Materials Technology Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India."
3,Direct Benedict's test of pig excreta,"2.2 Direct Benedict's test of pig excreta In order to find out the presence of the fermentable carbohydrates, raw excreta were subjected for qualitative test for the carbohydrate using Benedict's reagent. 5 mL of Benedict's reagent and pinch of raw pig excreta was added in a sterilized glass test tube, boiled in Bunsen burner flame."
4,Pre-treatment process of pig excreta,"2.3 Pre-treatment process of pig excreta One liter glass container was taken as fermentation vessel in the current study. Approximately 200 gm of raw excreta was weighed and transferred into the glass beaker, added 200 mL of distilled water, mixed with a glass rod in order to avoid the clumps of excreta followed by admixing with 4% H2SO4. The mixed content was incubated at 85–90 °C for about 4 h kept in a water bath. The entire content was taken out and mixed properly, slowly poured into the 1ltr fermentation vessel and allow it for the 20 d at room temperature. Intermittently the entire content in the fermentation vessel was mixed and stirred properly for two to three times in two days interval. Until the formation of the clear brown colored liquid formed which contains more amounts of the fermentable carbohydrates. The brown supernatant liquid containing the fermentable carbohydrates was extracted separately of about 200 mL into a conical flask. pH was adjusted between 6 and 7 using NaOH. Further, in order to determine the presence of the fermentable carbohydrates, brown supernatant was subjected to Benedict's test as described earlier."
5,Fermentation process,"2.4 Fermentation process The brown supernatant solution (adjusted pH of about 6–7) was subjected for the fermentation process under anaerobic condition by adding 5% final concentration of the commercially available baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for about 3–5 d at room temperature. During the entire fermentation process the mouth of the glass flask was tightly covered by using rubber balloon to ensure maximum anaerobicity. In addition, the fermentation process was confirmed by the formation of small, tiny air bubbles from the bottom of the fermentation bottle resulting in the inflation of the balloon. Completion of the entire fermentation process was noticed by changing in the color of the fermentation liquid and also reduction in the formation of air bubbles from the bottom of the fermentation flask. Specific gravity plays a major role in the process of fermentation (Suleiman et al., 2016). The brown liquid obtained after the proper pre-treatment of the pig excreta was measured using densitometer."
6,Distillation process,2.5 Distillation process Single distillation was performed by boiling the fermented liquid at 80 °C and the vapors generated were condensed at 4 °C using ice packs. The collected distilled colorless liquids were packed appropriately and subjected for GC and 1H NMR Analysis.
7,GC analysis,"2.6 GC analysis GC analysis of fermented, distilled colorless liquid from pig excreta was carried out by Robust Materials Technology Pvt, Ltd., Bangalore, India with a flame ionization detector using an HP- DB-wax column (30 m × 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm) was used to analyze components of single distilled product. While the injection ports were kept at 200 °C, 0.2 μL of the sample was injected by an apparatus which used nitrogen carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and the detector temperature of 250 °C. The combustion gas was a mixture of hydrogen and air. Standard 99.622% absolute ethanol was used as the internal standard. Scanning was carried out to produce a chromatogram signal which showed peak areas of ethanol as volumetric percentages, were analyzed."
8,1H NMR analysis,"2.7 1H NMR analysis 1H NMR analysis was performed using 500 MHz liquid state NMR spectrometer, Robust Materials Technology Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India. Preceding to the NMR measurement, the condensed solution was transferred into NMR sample tubes of 5 mm. Insert tube contained the D2O solvent was positioned in the sample tube. To attain 1H NMR spectra of the solvent, the data point was acquired using the spectral width of 8802.8 Hz, acquisition time of 3.722 s, pulse sequence relaxation delay period of 1.000 s, pulses at 45°, 32 repetitions using D2O at ambient temperature with data processing as line broadening of 1.0 Hz."
9,Evaluation of antimicrobial property of the bioethanol,"2.8 Evaluation of antimicrobial property of the bioethanol Antibacterial sensitivity testing of the confirmed bioethanol extracted from piggery excreta was evaluated for the different gram positive and negative organisms using the standard antibiotic discs. Further, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracted bioethanol was evaluated against the sensitive microorganisms as per the protocol described by Valle et al. (2016). The MIC of the bioethanol was determined by using broth culture microdilution method (Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute M07-A8, 2009)."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Traceability of carbohydrates in pig excreta,"3.1 Traceability of carbohydrates in pig excreta Direct Benedict's test of pig excreta revealed a change in color from blue to green as depicts in Fig. 1 , suggesting the presence of traceable reducing carbohydrates in the range of 0.5–1%. However, the concentration of the carbohydrates present in the pig excreta could be low in order to proceed for the fermentation process. Earlier studies revealed that in order to enhance the fermentable sugar concentration it is subjected to the pre-treatment process which will further enhances the fermentable sugar concentration (Hessami et al., 2019). Pig excreta was exposed to a pre-treatment method in the current investigation with the goal of increasing bioethanol."
12,Pre-treatment process,"3.2 Pre-treatment process In the present experiment, pig excreta were treated with 4% H2SO4 and observed the formation of clear brown colored supernatant solutions upon pre-treatment (Fig. 1). In addition, Benedict's test of the pretreated brown supernatant showed the color changes to reddish orange, suggesting that there was about 1.5–2% fermentable reducing carbohydrate concentration. Acidic pre-treatment will result in the release of easily fermentable carbohydrates from the cellulose as well as starch materials which are predominantly present in the piggery excreta. The pre-treatment of the pig excreta with 4% H2SO4 indicates the acid hydrolysis of the excreta to produce fermentable carbohydrates. During the acid hydrolysis the complex carbohydrates will be cleaved in to smaller disaccharides or monosaccharide which can be easily fermented to produce ethanol by the yeast (Braide et al., 2016). However, several studies conducted on production of ethanol from agro-waste evident that the acid pre-treatment can also eliminate the lignocelluloses components which are not suitable for the fermentation by yeast (Hessami et al., 2019). In addition, few studies suggesting that alkali treatment can also be employed in order to bioethanol production from agro -waste, however the yield of the fermentable sugars was found to be more appropriate upon acid treatment (Kaar and Holtzapple, 2000; Hamelinck et al., 2005)."
13,Adjusting specific gravity,"3.3 Adjusting specific gravity Specific gravity is considered to be desired criteria for the optimum fermentation in the bioethanol production (Suleiman et al., 2016). In the current study the specific gravity before the pre-treatment of the pig excreta was 1.020 and once after the pre-treatment it has been increased up to 1.160. Increased specific gravity of the post treated samples is mainly attributed to the enhanced release of the easily fermentable carbohydrates from the complex polysaccharides existing in the pig excreta. Further, the elevated specific gravity of 1.140 upon post pre-treatment pig excreta was adjusted to the 1.090 by using water in order to enhance the optimum production of the bioethanol. Optimum specific gravity is one of the critical points to be consider in bioethanol production. Tao et al. (2012) stated that, if the specific gravity is not adjusted, it may reduce the availability of the fermentable sugars to the yeast. In addition, limited availability of the fermentable sugars will lower the survivability of the yeast (Kubota et al., 2004)."
14,Fermentation process,"3.4 Fermentation process The brown supernatant solutions obtained upon pre-treatment were separated and subjected for the adjusted pH of about 6–7. The Anaerobic fermentation was confirmed by the presence of CO2 air bubbles formed during the fermentation process. Fermentation process was carried out for 3–5 d to notice the yield of bioethanol formation. Completion of the fermentation was confirmed by the stoppage of the formation of the air bubbles coming out of the fermentation vessel. The Single distillation was performed by boiling the fermented liquid followed by collection of around 50 mL of colorless condensed liquid. Fermentation process carried out in the current study revealed that there is sufficient conversion of fermentable sugars into ethanol; this conversion is also attributed to the concentration of the fermentable sugars after pre-treatment (Hessami et al., 2019). However, the fermentation was achieved using baker's yeast which is also getting inhibited once the alcohol content in the fermentation vessel goes up (Kubota et al., 2004). The fermentation process carried out in the current study for 3–5 d is also considered to be the important factor that decides the yield of the bioethanol (Braide et al., 2016). In addition, during the fermentation once the ethanol production increases there will be a negative effect on the growth of the yeast cells which is evident on completion of the fermentation process. It was noted that, in the current study during the progress of fermentation process there was formation of white precipitate indicating the existence of sodium sulphate, one of the ethanol insoluble primary byproduct during fermentation. Further to confirm the byproduct, white precipitate was separated from the fermented liquid, treated with barium chloride in order to obtain the barium sulphate and sodium chloride as secondary byproducts out of the fermentation study."
15,Comparative ethanol yield,"3.5 Comparative ethanol yield The ethanol yield is determined by the concentration of fermentable sugars produced after adequate pre-treatment. The potential yield of the bioethanol produced in this study was estimated assuming that the pig excreta supplied glucose as a fermentable sugar after adequate pre-treatment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is without a doubt the most well-studied and frequently employed eukaryote in a range of industrial activities, including wine, food, as well as ethanol production. Despite the efficient adaptation of the various Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in those processes, there is still a lot of room for improving existing strains or utilizing the vast natural reservoir of environmental isolates (Parapouli et al., 2020). Previous research using Saccharomyces cerevisiae on glucose fermentation trials indicated that the predicted yield of ethanol was 0.51 gm/gm (Lee et al., 2001). However, we were able to reach a concentration of fermentable sugars of 1.5–2 percent in the current investigation. As a result, in 200 mL of fermented culture, the predicted production of bioethanol from pig excreta was about 0.765–1.02 g."
16,GC analysis,"3.6 GC analysis The condensed liquid obtained after distillation was safely injected into GC. Retention time plays key role in GC for the identification of the analyte in comparison with the known standard compounds (Kotarska et al., 2019). GC chromatogram obtained for the condensed liquid sample is illustrates in Fig. 2 . Retention time for absolute ethanol detected after 4.203 min, while for the distilled condensed liquid from pig excreta was after 4.104 min. As a result, both the reference standard absolute ethanol and bioethanol from pig excreta had similar retention durations. The percentage of purity of ethanol produced from pig excreta in the current study was also compared with the absolute ethanol (Fig. 2). Percent of purity in the current study for absolute ethanol was 99.9% while for the bioethanol from the pig excreta was about 89.59%. Similar kinds of studies are also conducted in order to find the bioethanol extraction from agarophyte red seaweed, Gelidium elegans (Hessami et al., 2019). Moreover, the purity of bioethanol obtained from pig excreta in this experiment can be enhanced by subjecting the single distilled bioethanol fractions into double or triple distillation which can further enhance the percent purity of the bioethanol by reducing the impurities which can also be treated as contaminants."
17,1H NMR analysis,"3.7 1H NMR analysis The content of bioethanol produced from pig excreta was further evaluated through 1H NMR analysis. 1H NMR has been previously employed for quantification of biodiesel in petroleum diesel (Portela et al., 2016), determining the conversion of biodiesel obtained from different alcohols (Faraguna et al., 2017), characterization of biodiesel from mango seeds (Dutra et al., 2018) and determination of water content in bioethanol (Yoon et al., 2019). Fig. 3 illustrates the different signal peaks obtained through 1H NMR for the subjected bioethanol extracted from pig excreta. CH3 group, the first signal peaks depicted starting from 0 ppm, suggesting that there are three Hydrogen atoms connected to each other into a single carbon atom but adjacent to this group, CH2 which having two hydrogen atoms also connected to it. Further, in a high-resolution spectrum, the signal peaks for hydrogen with regard to CH3 are triplet, which implies that at 1.0 ppm, it divides into three peaks according to Pascal's triangle 1:2:1. Similarly, 1H NMR analysis of CH2 revealed two hydrogen atoms are connected to a single carbon atom. However, the same carbon atom is also connected to the adjacent carbon with three hydrogen atoms of CH3 and also to an OH. Additionally, the signal peaks for the hydrogen of CH2 in high-resolution spectra are quartet where it splits into four peaks, according to pascal's triangle as 1:3:3:1 at 3.5 ppm. Similarly, the 1H NMR study of the OH group revealed that instead of carbon, a hydrogen atom is linked to an oxygen atom, which serves as an insulator buffer, resulting in a signal peak for the OH according to Pascal's triangle that is not spitted at 1.9 ppm. In addition to the peaks and splits observed, the current investigation also indicated that the integrated area beneath the peaks for CH2 and CH3, respectively, is 2.0 and 2.9, indicating that the molecule has CH3 and CH2 groups (Fig. 3). The NMR results obtained in the current study are comparable with the standard 1H NMR spectra at Spectral Database for Organic Compounds SDBS like SDBS-1H NMRSDBS No. 1300HSP-01-876 (https://sdbs.db.aist.go.jp/sdbs/cgi-bin/direct_frame_disp.cgi?sdbsno=1300)."
18,Antimicrobial activity testing,"3.8 Antimicrobial activity testing The antibacterial activity of bioethanol derived from pig excreta was also identified against gram positive and negative bacteria such as Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, and Klebsiella species. The extracted bioethanol has MIC values ranging from 11 to 25 g/mL (data not provided here)."
19,Significance of the findings in relation with cleaner production,"3.9 Significance of the findings in relation with cleaner production Due to their profitability concerns, intensive pig farming has been progressively increasing to fulfil the demand for global pork production, and as a consequence the piggery waste management problem may pose a number of hazards to the human health as well as surrounding environment (FAO, 2003). Piggery farm waste/excreta are a major source of different zoonotic infections (Bilotta and Kunz, 2013; Klous et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2019; Woonwong et al., 2020), environmental pollution with heavy toxic metals (Kaur et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020, 2021; Luan et al., 2021) as well as transmission of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria to the surroundings (Ström et al., 2018; Ström Hallenberg et al., 2019; He et al., 2020). Aside from these annoyances, piggery manures can also contribute to ground water contamination, either by seepage or waste spray into the surrounding area (Fridrih et al., 2014). The piggery waste spray has been observed to create many quirks such as nasty smell, respiratory difficulties, mucosal irritations, increasing blood pressures, and increased stress among the residents in the surrounding areas (Ironkwe and Amefule, 2008). Industrial pig farmers have attempted to devise methods of controlling these wastes, however small-scale pig farmers have no choice except to place their farms in rural regions distant from metropolitan areas in order to limit the waste's perceived impacts on the environment. This current research methodology described here will provide a solution to the piggery farm waste disposal by industrial utilization of the piggery excreta to alleviate the environmental pollution as well as production of bioethanol as an alternative source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission free biofuels with reduced capital and operating costs. Various factors might directly or indirectly interfere with the generation of biogas or methene production from piggery waste materials, according to studies (Yin et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Miroshnichenko et al., 2020). Although the approach presented here is for small-scale piggery manure-based bioethanol production, further study is needed in areas such as large-scale piggery excreta processing, fermentation technology development, and so on to make bioethanol production more economically viable. As a result, using massively collected piggery excreta on a big scale in limited resource locations to produce bioethanol is a viable option for sustainable piggery waste management."
20,Conclusions,"Agricultural waste products can be an appealing and cost-effective alternative for producing biofuels. Despite the fact that animal excreta have been proved to be a viable supply of raw materials for the manufacture of bioethanol, pig excreta have not yet been employed as a source of raw materials for production of bioethanol in any commercial operation. The current study demonstrates that producing bioethanol from pig excreta with minimal chemical needs is the most cost-effective method. It is anticipated that the diet may have a significant impact on the generation of bioethanol from monogastric animals such as pig excreta. As evidenced by the fact that pig excreta acquired from well-maintained commercial farms where the animals are fed a good balanced diet as well as kitchen/restaurant waste is sufficient for bioethanol production. The pig excreta had a specific gravity of 1.020 before pre-treatment and 1.160 after treatment. The extracted bioethanol had a retention period of 4.104 min, which was closer to absolute ethanol values. We were able to effectively manufacture 0.765–1.02 gm/200 mL of 89.59 percent pure bioethanol from piggery excreta in this experiment. In the current scenario, emerging countries like as India, who have limited fossil fuel resources, have a large demand for alternative energy sources on a worldwide scale. In this context, bioethanol derived from pig excreta might open the way for new, high-value options for environmental protection, rural economic development, and fuel security. Animal waste is a serious problem in urban and peri-urban intensive animal husbandry methods because it pollutes the environment. Undigested organic debris, pathogenic organisms, and inorganic waste, such as heavy metals, are the three primary components of animal waste. This study's methodology might serve as a user guide for using piggery excreta to create economically viable bioethanol. In addition, production of bioethanol from the piggery excreta is a ‘wealth from waste’ which needs to be the least or no cost of raw materials for their commercial production and this could generate huge employment by boosting of the rural India to the next level of biofuel development. Bioethanol produced from piggery excreta can be implemented for development of low-cost biofuel blending mixture as well as an innovative approach for piggery waste disposal management policy in pork loving states or countries. In any intensive animal husbandry practices the disposal of animal waste is a major concern. It limits the intensive animal rearing impossible in urban and peri-urban areas in spite of the heavy demand to meet the animal protein to the human population. This work is a solution to the problem of piggery waste/excreta disposal. This effort focuses on the breakdown of undigested organic matter, and as a result, it will address piggery waste use in a scientific manner. Policymakers may also plan ahead to adopt this approach for effective piggery farm waste disposal. Additionally, if enough pig manure is gathered in one location, it is possible to produce bioethanol on a commercial scale using readily accessible raw materials at no cost. As a consequence, commercial bioethanol production from undigested leftover piggery waste materials may begin at a low input cost. Although the experiment presented here was aimed at manufacturing bioethanol from piggery excreta on a small scale, further research is needed to examine many aspects in order to create commercially viable bioethanol production on a big scale for its commercial exploration."
