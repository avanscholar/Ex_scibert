0,Introduction,"Global warming and exhaustible fossil fuels are environmentally and economically important issues confronting humanity [1,2]. Some of the energy currently provided by fossil fuels is expected to be replaced by renewable energy sources as a countermeasure for global warming and exhaustion of fossil fuels. Such renewable energy sources include biohydrogen, which is produced from renewable biomass materials [3]. One novel method to produce biohydrogen is hydrogen fermentation using hydrogen-producing bacteria such as anaerobic and/or photosynthetic bacteria [4,5]. Anaerobic bacteria can perform different metabolic pathways with different efficiency and by-products in hydrogen fermentation [3,6,7] according to the following processes and others. (1) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 4H2 + 2CO2 + 2CH3COOH (2) C6H12O6 → 2H2 + 2CO2 + C3H7COOH The maximum production ratio the maximum hydrogen yield (possible H2 yield from 1 mol-hexose) in a typical dark fermentation process is theoretically 4 mol-H2/mol-hexose from the reaction presented in Eq. (1). In this case, the by-product is acetic acid. For Eq. (2), the production ratio is 2 mol-H2/mol-hexose and the main aqueous product is butyric acid. Moreover, by-product volatile fatty acids (VFAs) such as acetic acid and butyric acid are useful as substrates for methane production. Consequently, a two-step anaerobic system combining hydrogen and methane fermentation can utilize organic wastes effectively to produce the two bio-energy gases [8,9]. Practically, however, various chemical reactions occur in the anaerobic fermentation, some of which decline the productivity of hydrogen, and source biomass often contains substrates hard to decompose [3]. The hydrogen-producing bacteria exist in a broad range of soil and water environments [10,11]. Obtaining efficient microflora of bacteria for fermentation of a target biomass material is a key to success in hydrogen production. We have specifically addressed microflora derived from the rice rhizosphere [9,12]. Plant roots, especially their tip including the root cap, secrete mucilaginous substances [13], which mainly includes polysaccharides with amino and organic acids [14,15]. These substances provide carbohydrates to soil microorganisms [16]. Soil in paddy fields is anaerobic during the rice-growing period because of flooding. Therefore, bacteria in the rice rhizosphere must decompose organic materials originated from rice roots through anaerobic fermentation. Hydrogen fermentation for biohydrogen production is thought to occur in a similar anaerobic environment; for that reason, we have tried to inoculate rice rhizosphere bacteria for hydrogen production from waste biomass. In fact, we performed hydrogen fermentation from waste bread using microflora derived from the rice rhizosphere at a plant scale, and confirmed hydrogen and VFA production [9]. Aside from the mucigel secreted from roots, paddy soil often contains organic fertilizer such as rice straw compost, which can be consumed by soil and rhizosphere bacteria. This fact suggests that some rice rhizosphere bacteria may digest plant-origin waste materials under anaerobic conditions. Apple pomace is plant material waste from apple juice factories. It is mostly incinerated for disposal in Japan. At best, it is used for livestock feed and compost [17], but feeding livestock with apple pomace requires complicated processes and sanitary care for processed products. Similar wastefulness of apple pomace occurs in China [18]. Nevertheless, apple pomace contains high percentage contents of sugar and organic acids (e.g. malic and citric acids) compared to other agro-industrial wastes [18,19] as well as plant fibers (e.g. pectin or cellulose). Therefore, apple pomace can be a suitable substrate of hydrogen fermentation. Only a few studies or trials, however, have investigated hydrogen fermentation using apple pomace [18]. In this study, we conducted both vial-scale and batch-scale hydrogen fermentation experiments to examine apple pomace using microflora derived from the rice rhizosphere. First, hydrogen production was confirmed in the vial test; then the reaction factors (pH, reactor temperature and organic loading) were examined to determine the optimal hydrogen fermentation conditions. In the batch experiment, we evaluated the hydrogen production and analyzed the bacterial microflora in the fermenting material using molecular biological method."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Collection and enrichment culture of the rhizosphere microflora,"2.1 Collection and enrichment culture of the rhizosphere microflora Seed soil microflora used for this research were collected from the rice rhizosphere. Rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) were conventionally cultivated in flooded paddy fields of the university farm in Nishitokyo, Japan (35°43′N, 139°32′E) during April–October of 2002 [12]. At the rice ripening stage, the top 200 mm soil of Andosol [20] was taken with rice roots using a shovel within approximately 150 mm from a rice hill as rhizosphere soil. It was kept in a refrigerator (ca. 5 °C). One day before the inoculation to apple pomace, approximately 1 g of the soil sample was put into a vial tube with 10 mL sterile water to produce a suspended solution of living microflora. The suspended solution of the natural microflora was kept at 30 °C for one night [9]."
3,Fermentation materials (apple pomace),"2.2 Fermentation materials (apple pomace) To produce the fermentation material, compressed apple pomace (moisture 80.2%; protein 0.6%; fat 1.8%; ash 0.4%) discarded from an apple juice factory (JA Minami Shinshu, Nagano, Japan) was unstiffened manually and agitated into a slurry state using a food cutter and mixer. Some pomace slurry was used to analyze carbohydrate contents and chemical oxygen demand using the chrome method (CODCr). Carbohydrates were measured using the anthrone–sulfuric acid method [21]. As the pretreatment of anthrone–sulfuric acid method, 100 mL slurry mixed with 10 mL cold trichloroacetic acid was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 min). The supernatant fluid was diluted with distilled water to measure water-soluble carbohydrate using the anthrone–sulfuric acid method. Some insoluble carbohydrate remaining in the residue was extracted. Namely, the residue obtained through the centrifugation was suspended with 10 mL distilled water and 20 mL 1 N HCl to heat for 2.5 h (boiling at ca. 100 °C) in a water bath. After cooling, the suspension was neutralized using 0.5 N NaOH, diluted with distilled water, and centrifuged again (3000 rpm, 10 min). The supernatant fluid was analyzed as insoluble carbohydrate using the anthrone–sulfuric acid method. Methods used to measure CODCr and dissoluble CODCr (D-CODCr) conformed to Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) K0102. Namely, slurry sample doped with potassium dichromate was boiled for 2 h in Liebig reflux condenser; cooled sample was titrated with iron sulfate (II) ammonium to calculate CODCr."
4,Vial test,"2.3 Vial test 2.3.1 Culture method and conditions for fermentation In the vial test, three levels of organic loading were examined: 73.4, 146.8 and 220.2 g apple pomace per liter medium. After adding nitrogen (polypeptone), phosphoric acid, mineral (magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and yeast extract), and reducing agent (l-cysteine) for omitting oxygen to the slurry in a vial (ca. 130 mL), the slurry was diluted to 60 mL with water. The concentration of the additives in the slurry was; polypeptone: 20 g/L, potassium dihydrogen phosphate 4.0 g/L, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate: 1.0 g/L, yeast extract 1.0 g/L, l-cysteine hydrochloride salt: 2.0 g/L. The initial pH of the slurry was adjusted to 6.0 or 6.5, which were similar to soil pH in the paddy field (pH 6.1–6.5). The gas in the vial was replaced with nitrogen gas using a gas jet to create an anaerobic environment. Then sterilization treatment (121 °C for 30 min) was applied using an autoclave. To the pretreated fermentation material, 1 mL suspended solution of the microflora was added using a syringe under anaerobic conditions, with subsequent liquid shaking culture. The temperature was maintained at 30, 35, or 40 °C during fermentation. 2.3.2 Evaluation of hydrogen production The volume of biogas produced in the vial was measured using a syringe when the gas pressure in the vial and syringe reached a state of equilibrium with the atmospheric pressure. A gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detector (GC-8A; Shimadzu Corp.) was used to measure the concentration of hydrogen (H2) in the biogas. The hydrogen production amount was calculated from the hydrogen concentration and the volume of biogas production (converted to the volume in standard condition); that value was then converted into the number of moles. Thereafter, the hydrogen yield was computed as the number of moles of hydrogen produced from 1 mol of hexose."
5,Batch examination,"2.4 Batch examination 2.4.1 Conditions of batch fermentation An automatic controlling jar fermenter (TSA-2; Takasugi Seisakusho Co. Ltd.) was used for the batch test. The fermentation tank was made of glass with a total volume of 1.0 L and effective volume of 0.6 L. Apple pomace slurry of 0.55 L was made in the tank: it comprised apple pomace (136.4 g/L), corn steep liquor (CSL; Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd.) (9.0 g/L) as the nitrogen source and l-cysteine (1.0 g per tank) as the reducing agent. The chemical composition of CSL was 7.0–8.5% nitrogen source, 1.5–3.5% amino acid, 2.4–3.2% polypeptone, and 14–20% lactic acid. The slurry in the fermentation tank was sterilized using an autoclave (121 °C for 30 min). After sterilization, the tank was chilled to room temperature and mounted on the jar fermenter. Microflora inoculation was done by putting the suspended solution (5.0 mL) into the slurry. The air in the tank was purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min. The culture was kept at pH level of 6.0. It was constantly controlled by the jar fermenter using 5 N NaOH and 1 N HCl. The incubation temperature was kept at 35 ± 0.1 °C during fermentation with an agitation speed of 200 rpm. 2.4.2 Gas analysis The amount of biogas generation during fermentation was measured using a wet gas meter (W-NK-1; Shinagawa Corp.) until the gas generation terminated. The concentrations of hydrogen over time was measured using a gas chromatograph (GC-8A; Shimadzu Corp.) from the recovered biogas in the gas sampling bag 3 L. Measuring conditions for gas chromatography were column: SHINCARBON ST (Shinwa Chemical Industries LTD.); mesh 50/80; stainless steel tube: 3.0 mm × 4.0 m; column temperature 150 °C; carrier gas: Ar 40 mL min−1. Similarly, in the vial test, the amount of hydrogen production and the hydrogen yield were calculated from the hydrogen concentration and the amount of biogas production. 2.4.3 Componential analysis Carbohydrates were measured using the anthrone–sulfuric acid method as described above (see Fermentation materials (apple pomace)) at the beginning and end of fermentation. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs: acetic acid, propionic acid, i-butyric acid, n-butyric acid, i-valeric acid and n-valeric acid) in the slurry were measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector (GC-14 A; Shimadzu Corp.) at the end of the fermentation. Measuring conditions of gas chromatography were column: Unisole F-200 (GL Sciences Inc.); mesh: 30/60; glass tube: 3.0 mm × 4.0 m; column temperature: 150 °C; carrier gas: N2 30 mL min−1. 2.4.4 PCR-DGGE analysis Fresh samples of slurry were taken from the fermentation tanks for analysis of the bacterial community in the slurry at the end of the fermentation. First, DNA was extracted from each sample using bead-beating for PCR-DGGE; then 0.5 g of slurry was added to a 2 mL tube and disrupted at 5500 rpm for 30 s using a bead shocker (Micro Smash; Tomy Seiko Co. Ltd.). The suspension of the extracted DNA was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 3 min. The washed DNA samples contained some humus and protein. They were purified further using a spin column (GFX TM kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) [22]. For PCR, this purified DNA was used as the PCR template for analysis of bacterial community structure. Two primers were applied to the PCR template to encode the V3 region of the 16S ribosome DNA [23]. One is the forward primer 357F-GC, 5′-cct acg gga ggc agc ag -3′ (Escherichia coli positions 341–357), which was attached to an oligonucleotide GC clamp (cgc ccg ccg cgc gcg gcg ggg gcg ggg gca cgg ggg g) at the 5′-terminus. The other is the reverse primer 518R, 5′-att acc gcg gct gct gg -3′ (E. coli positions 518–534). PCR was conducted with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min and annealing at 53 °C for 1 min and primer extension at 72 °C for 2 min [24]. The PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel to verify that the 16S rDNA had been amplified. The PCR products were analyzed using DGGE (D-Code system; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) on a polyacrylamide gel with a 30–60% denaturation gradient of urea-formamide [24] under a 120 V field for 60 °C 4 h [25]. The polyacrylamide gel was stained (SYBER Green I; Molecular Probes Inc.) in a dark room for 20 min; the 16S rDNA profile was verified and photographed. After intensely stained DGGE bands were excised from the gels, the 16S rDNAs were purified and amplified using a kit (QIAquick PCR Purification; Qiagen Inc. Hilden, Germany). The purified PCR 16S rDNAs were sequenced using a kit (Big Dye terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction; Applied Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 3100; Applied Biosystems). Detected bacteria were identified using data from the DNA data bank of Japan (DDBJ) and a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) [26]. The sequences obtained from the DGGE bands were sent to the DNA database for a homology search using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)."
6,Results,
7,Vial test,"3.1 Vial test The carbohydrates which were soluble in water and 1 N HCl measured using the anthrone–sulfuric acid method (see 2.2 Fermentation materials (apple pomace)) occupied 14.4% of fresh weight of the compressed pomace. Assuming that those carbohydrates were the available substrates for hydrogen production, the organic loadings of the three treatments (73.4, 146.8 and 220.2 g apple pomace per liter medium) were respectively equivalent to 10, 20, and 30 g-hexose/L. The amounts of hydrogen produced under different conditions for the 96 h after commencement of the experiment are shown in Table 1 . The biogas production was low with the lowest organic loading (10 g-hexose/L) at all temperatures and pH treatments. The hydrogen production was mostly larger for initial pH of 6.0 than it was for pH 6.5. Hydrogen production was greatest when the fermentation temperature was, respectively, 30 °C or 35 °C with initial pH 6.0 and 30 °C with initial pH 6.5. Furthermore, under these optimal temperatures, the larger the organic loading, the greater the amount of hydrogen production. By the end of the vial test, initial pH 6.0 and 6.5 had become pH 4.2 and 5.4, respectively. The maximum hydrogen yield was 1.31 (mol-H2/mol-hexose) under conditions of initial pH 6.0, fermentation temperature 35 °C and organic loading of 10 g-hexose/L. At initial pH 6.0 hydrogen yield was higher than initial pH 6.5, excluding the combination of initial pH 6.5, fermentation temperature 30 °C and organic loading 10 g-hexose/L (Table 2 ). Analysis of variance (Table 2) showed that the organic loading and initial pH (p < 0.01) significantly affected the hydrogen yield. The larger the organic loading ratio, the smaller the hydrogen yield (Table 2), which is an opposite tendency to that of the volume of hydrogen gas (Table 1)."
8,Batch examination,"3.2 Batch examination 3.2.1 Biogas production The contents of solid materials in the slurry are presented in Table 3 . During fermentation, the water-soluble carbohydrates and carbohydrates extracted by 1 N HCl solution were decreased by 96% and 84%, respectively. The total decrease of carbohydrates (7.38 + 1.03 = 8.41 g/L-slurry) occupied most of the decrease of total solids in slurry (from 2.8% to 2.1% in Table 3), suggesting that they were major substrates for the anaerobic fermentation. In terms of the temporal changes of biogas production, biogas increased rapidly from 3 h after the start of the experiment. Then the biogas production rate showed a maximum value of 0.83 L/h per L-slurry at 10.5 h after the start of the experiment. Subsequently, it decreased rapidly to a stable level at ca. 1.5 L/h (12–24 h after the start of the experiment), and attained a quiescent state at 24 h after the start of the experiment (Fig. 1a). As a result, the accumulation of biogas increased rapidly during the first 12 h, and gradually during the second 12 h (Fig. 1b). The total biogas production in 24 h was 6.1 L/L-slurry. Nearly 50% of the biogas was hydrogen (H2), and the total production of hydrogen in 24 h was 2.52 L/L-slurry (Table 4 ). Assuming that the soluble carbohydrates and carbohydrates extracted by 1 N HCl solution (8.41 g/L-slurry in total) were the source of hydrogen (Table 3), the hydrogen yield was 2.28 mol-H2/mol-hexose. Table 5 presents contents of VFAs in the slurry at the end of the fermentation. The contents of the VFAs were negligibly low before the fermentation; most (acetic and n-butyric acids were the major) were by-products from the anaerobic fermentation. 3.2.2 PCR-DGGE The PCR-DGGE profile of 16S rDNA obtained at the end of the fermentation is presented in Fig. 2 . The four major DNA bands indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2 were applied to sequencing analysis to obtain accession numbers of reported bacteria in BLAST with high sequence similarity: two bands were identified, respectively, as Clostridium butyricum EIB3-3 (AY458856) and Clostridium sp. 44a-T5zd (AY08248); the other two DNA bands showed homology to unknown species, uncultured bacterium AY376696, and uncultured bacterium AF371696. C. butyricum and Clostridium sp. 44a-T5zd belonged to cluster Ia and Ib in Clostridiaceae, respectively [27]."
9,Discussion,
10,"Influence of pH, temperature, and organic loading on hydrogen production in vial tests","4.1 Influence of pH, temperature, and organic loading on hydrogen production in vial tests In the vial test, the organic loading and initial pH affected the hydrogen yield. The hydrogen yield was higher with initial pH 6.0, reflecting the high hydrogen concentration of the biogas, than that with initial pH 6.5 (Tables 1 and 2). The final pH values (4.2 and 5.4) were much lower than the initial ones, which suggest the accumulation of organic acids produced in the process of hydrogen fermentation. Some hydrogen-producing Clostridium spp. can change the metabolic pathways producing VFAs and solvents (e.g. alcohol) alternatively depending on the environmental factors including pH [28]. In addition, the proportion of metabolic reactions to produce hydrogen and VFAs (see Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) in the Introduction) might be affected by the environmental conditions of fermentation. The initial pH might affect such metabolic pathways of the anaerobic fermentation by the microflora dominated by Clostridium spp. Although the hydrogen yield was not significantly affected by the incubation temperature (Table 2), hydrogen production tended to be lowered at 40 °C (Table 1). The optimum temperature depends on the sorts of substrates and microflora [29]. It must be considered that the microflora sample used for hydrogen production in this study was collected from a rice paddy field at the end of summer, when the soil temperature was 25–35 °C. Probably for this reason, hydrogen production was suppressed at high temperatures (i.e. 40 °C). Although the gross production of hydrogen was higher with larger organic loading (Table 1), large organic loading decreased the hydrogen yield (Table 2). In terms of practical applications, it is expected to maintain high conversion efficiency with large organic loading. In this vial experiment, slurry was not agitated during fermentation. The hydrogen yield under large organic loading might be improved by agitation of slurry and inoculation of adequate amounts of seed bacteria."
11,Possible contribution of paddy-soil-originated bacteria to hydrogen and VFAs production in the batch examination,"4.2 Possible contribution of paddy-soil-originated bacteria to hydrogen and VFAs production in the batch examination The hydrogen yield obtained in this study (2.28) was higher than those in many previous studies using other substrates (Table 6 ). This fact suggests that soluble carbohydrates of apple pomace can be a valuable resource for biohydrogen production. Moreover, utilization of apple pomace for two-step fermentation (i.e. combination of hydrogen and methane fermentations) can be more effective because the VFAs, as by-products of hydrogen production (Table 5), are suitable sources for methane fermentation [9,30]. The major VFAs detected as the end product were acetic acid and butyric acid, which coincide with results of apple pomace fermentation using river sludge microflora reported by Feng et al. [18]. Biogas production rapidly increased during the first 12 h of the experiment and decreased to reach a low steady state during the subsequent period (12–24 h after the start of fermentation). Water-soluble carbohydrates such as fructose, sucrose, and glucose in apple pomace [19,31] should have been decomposed as the major substrate for fermentation quickly in the first 12 h. Furthermore, the non-water-soluble but decomposable carbohydrates might have been decomposed during the subsequent 12 h. Indeed, the carbohydrates that were insoluble but extractable using 1 N HCl decreased during the fermentation (Table 3). Apple pomace contains insoluble carbohydrate originated from cell walls, such as cellulose, pectin, hemicellulose, and lignin [19,31]. Although these cell wall components are difficult to decompose, some species of soil bacteria in paddy fields can feed on part of the cell wall components. Clostridium spp. exist in paddy soil [12,32], and some of them can produce hydrogen, although those species have not been identified [32]. In general, some Clostridium species produce hydrogen from glucose and organic acids [33]. Moreover, some Clostridium spp. produce hydrogen during decomposition of cellulose [34]. The Clostridium species detected in this study (C. butyricum EIB3-3 and Clostridium sp. 44a-T5zd) and perhaps the source bacteria of the unidentified DNA bands (Fig. 2) derived from the rhizosphere soil might contribute to the production of hydrogen and VFAs as decomposition products of some parts of insoluble carbohydrates as well as soluble carbohydrates. The AP81 strain, which is an extremely close relative of C. aerotolerans, was isolated from the apple pomace sludge inoculated with paddy soil bacteria for methane fermentation [31]. The AP81 strain decomposes pectin and glucose, thereby producing acetic acid and hydrogen [31]. Feng et al. [18] examined anaerobic hydrogen fermentation with river sludge from pretreated apple pomace. The maximum cumulative hydrogen production per 1 g total solids (TS) was ca. 40 mL without pretreatment, 70 mL with H2SO4 pretreatment and 100 mL with ammonia pretreatment [18], whereas we obtained 90 mL H2/g TS by the fermentation using rhizosphere microflora to apple pomace (batch test) without H2SO4 or ammonia pretreatment. The pretreatment, in particular with ammonia, is an effective way to enhance the decomposition of plant fibers, but often needs secure facility and additional system to recycle the ammonia [35–37]. Use of microflora from rice rhizosphere may provide an option to build a compact system of hydrogen production from apple pomace without the pretreatment."
12,Conclusions,"The results of this study demonstrated that paddy fields are not only the site for rice production but can be valuable mine of industrial microbe for their biodiversity. A high hydrogen yield was obtained in a batch experiment from apple pomace using microflora that had originated from an anaerobic rice rhizosphere. Higher efficiency of hydrogen production can be expected using microflora that actively decompose plant fibers (e.g. pectin, cellulose) as well as soluble carbohydrates in the apple pomace. In organic farming of rice, substantial amounts of fibrous organic materials such as rice straw compost are incorporated into soil and are digested in anaerobic conditions. Further exploration of paddy fields for effective microorganisms might contribute greatly to biological production of hydrogen and methane from biomass waste materials."
