0,Introduction,"Approximately 20,000 food processing industries in the US annually produce 1.4 billion liters of wastewater (Elitzak, 2000; Johnson, 1998). These wastewaters can be characterized as nontoxic because they contain few hazardous compounds, have high BODs compared to many other industrial wastewaters, and much of the organic matter in them consists of simple sugars and starch (Speece, 1996). Due to increased enforcement of discharge regulations and escalating surcharges by public owned treatment works (POTW), many food processing industries are taking steps to reduce, recycle, or treat their wastewater before discharge (McIlvaine, 2003). Aerobic wastewater treatment costs can be very high for these wastewaters, and therefore there is great interest in new methods to either reduce treatment costs or to provide other products from the wastewater. One new promising technology is to link wastewater treatment with hydrogen production (Oh et al., 2003; Khanal et al., 2004; Hussy et al., 2005). Most hydrogen is currently produced from nonrenewable sources using natural gas (50%), petroleum-derived napthenes and distillates (30%), coal (18%), or electricity produced from a variety of fuels (2%) (US DOE, 2003). Hydrogen can also be made from renewable substrates, including wheat grains (Kalia et al., 1993), municipal solid waste (Lay et al., 1999; Okamoto et al., 2000), and food processing wastewaters (Van Ginkel et al., 2005). Hydrogen production from simple sugars is more efficient than from other materials (Logan et al., 2002), but yields can be low and much of the organic matter remains as soluble fermentation products. A maximum of 4mol of hydrogen can be produced per mol of glucose (mol/mol), and only if acetate is the sole byproduct. Even under this optimal condition 67% of the original organic matter will remain in solution (chemical oxygen demand (COD) basis). Typical hydrogen yields range from 1 to 2mol/mol, and result in 80–90% of the initial COD remaining in the wastewater in the form of various volatile organic acids and solvents, such as acetic, propionic, butyric acids and ethanol. One way to recover the remaining organic matter in a useable form for energy production is to produce methane. Two-stage processes are already well developed, and they could conceivably be adapted for both hydrogen and methane production, although these combined gas processes have not yet been demonstrated at full scale (Logan, 2004). Electricity production using a microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a new alternative to methane production for recovering energy from a wastewater (Logan, 2004). MFCs consist of two electrodes (anode and cathode), with bacteria growing on dissolved organic matter at the anode under anaerobic conditions. These bacteria oxidize and transfer electrons to the anode that then pass through an external circuit to the cathode producing current. Protons migrate through the solution to the cathode where they combine with oxygen and electrons to form water. Some bacteria can directly transfer electrons from respiratory enzymes (i.e., cytochromes) to the electrodes without mediators (Kim et al., 1999; Chaudhuri and Lovley, 2003). These mediatorless MFCs show significant potential for the harvesting of energy from waste organic matter (Bond and Lovley, 2003; Logan, 2004). Electricity can be generated using pure compounds, such as glucose or acetate (Bond and Lovley, 2003; Oh et al., 2004; Min and Logan, 2004; Chaudhuri and Lovley, 2003), or from domestic wastewater (Liu et al., 2004; Min and Logan, 2004) and organic matter in marine sediments (Bond et al., 2002). There has been little research on biological hydrogen production using actual food processing wastewaters, and on electricity generation using MFCs for these types of wastewaters (Kim et al., 2004). It has been speculated that linking hydrogen production with electricity production in MFCs could provide a greater value of products produced from wastewater treatment than either of these processes alone or either one linked to methane production (Logan, 2004). It is known that electricity can be generated in MFCs from typical fermentation end products such as acetate, butyrate, and lactate (Bond and Lovley, 2003; Oh et al., 2004; Min and Logan, 2004; Liu and Logan, 2004; Kim et al., 1999), but actual waste streams containing mixtures of fermentation end products have not been previously examined. In addition, there are other hydrogen fermentation end products that have not been examined for electricity production in a MFC. Propionic acid, for example, is a common intermediate in the metabolism of simple or complex organics (Speece, 1996) but it has not previously been tested for electricity generation in an MFC. In this study, we therefore investigated the potential of producing hydrogen from food processing wastewaters and also producing electricity from this wastewater using an MFC. Propionic acid was a major end product of hydrogen fermentation, and therefore we also examined electricity production from this compound."
1,Methods,
2,Samples,"2.1 Samples Wastewater samples were collected from several locations at a food processing plant, and from the same location at two different times of the day, in order to obtain a range of sample types present at the facility. A wastewater sample was taken from a Cereal-processing unit that is known to be high in COD (Cereal). Water used in the preparation of this and other food products at several other locations in the plant is collected at this site into a central line. This line was sampled during one of two normal production shifts (Effluent 1) as well as during a late-night shift primarily oriented around cleaning operations (Effluent 2). A fourth sample (Lagoon) was obtained from the equalization basin that collects from the effluent line and therefore this sample represents a daily-averaged wastewater sample. All samples were collected in duplicate, stored on ice, sent by overnight courier to Penn State, and then were stored at 4°C prior to use. Samples were analyzed within 2 days for their general characteristics (COD and sugars). Analysis of the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was performed to verify that samples had not undergone substantial anaerobic degradation prior to their use in tests."
3,Hydrogen production,"2.2 Hydrogen production Samples were analyzed (in duplicate) for hydrogen production in a constant room temperature (30°C) under three different conditions: with nutrients and sludge prepared by a heat treatment (HT) process; no nutrients and a HT inoculum; and no nutrients and no inoculum. Dewatered sludge (85% water content) was obtained from the Penn State wastewater treatment plant in State College, PA, USA. The HT inoculum was prepared by baking sludge at 104°C for 2h to select for heat resistant, spore-forming bacteria (Van Ginkel et al., 2001). This material was then broken up and sieved (#20 mesh, 850μm), and stored in a sealed container at ambient temperature (24°C). Bottles (150mL) were filled with a wastewater sample (125mL) and, if needed, 0.5g of the HT sludge and a nutrient solution (0.6mL). The nutrient solution containing N, P and metals, was added from a concentrated (200× concentrated) stock solution as previously described (Oh et al., 2004). The wastewater sample was buffered by adding 0.05M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid monohydrate (MES) (J.T. Baker), with the pH adjusted to 6.0 using NaOH (2M). All bottles were sparged with nitrogen gas for 10min to remove oxygen, and then capped with a rubber stopper and aluminum seals. Biogas production was measured using a continuous gas production technique using a respirometric system (Challenge Environmental Systems AER-200 Respirometer, Fayetteville, AR) as described previously (Logan et al., 2002). Once biogas production had stopped, the lines connecting the bottles to the gas flow system were disconnected in order to avoid potential gas intake due to hydrogen consumption in the bottles."
4,Electricity production using a MFC,"2.3 Electricity production using a MFC Electricity generation was measured using two different MFC systems: a two chambered aqueous cathode system, and a one-chambered direct air cathode system. The two-chambered system was constructed by joining two media bottles (310mL capacity, Corning Inc., NY) with a glass tube containing a proton exchange membrane (PEM; Nafion™ 117, Dupont Co., DE) clamped between the flattened ends of the glass tubes fitted with two rubber gaskets (6.2cm2 cross section) as described previously (Oh et al., 2004). The surface area of PEM was A PEM=6.2cm2, and the anode and cathode had equal projected surface areas of A Anode = A Cathode = 22.5 cm 2 . A one-chambered MFC (28mL capacity) was constructed and operated as previously reported (Liu et al., 2004), and did not contain a PEM (117Ω external resistance; A PEM=A Anode=A Cathode=7.1cm2). For both systems, the anode electrode was made of Toray carbon paper (without wet proofing; E-Tek) and the cathode electrode was coated with a Pt catalyst (0.5mg/cm2, 10% Pt; De Nora North America, Inc.) on one side. For the two chambered MFC, both anode and cathode chambers were filled to 250mL, with nutrient, mineral, and buffer (NMB) medium whose composition was reported by Oh et al. (2004). The anode chamber was inoculated with sludge (1g; 85% water content) and initially operated with 0.1M acetate in NMB medium until a stable power output cycle was achieved. Power output was monitored by measuring the voltage across a resistor of 480Ω connecting the electrodes. The system was then switched to the wastewater diluted (10×) with medium (NMB) to reduce the time needed to conduct an experiment that demonstrated power generation with this wastewater. In order to test the feasibility of coupling electricity production to biological hydrogen production, we transferred the solution remaining from the hydrogen production tests with the Cereal wastewater into a single chambered MFC. The pH of the fermented wastewater was adjusted to pH=7.0 using 2M NaOH. The reactor was inoculated with the anode supernatant (2mL) of the MFC system initially operated as described above for the two-chambered MFC. Propionate was also tested for electricity production using the two-chambered MFC as described above except the anode was first acclimated to wastewater containing acetate (5mM). The anode was then transferred into a new two-chambered system containing NMB medium and acetate (1mM). Propionate (0.26 or 0.53mM) or acetate (1mM) was spiked to the anode chamber, using concentrated propionate or acetate solutions (0.5M), after the voltage was reduced to <28mV."
5,Calculations,"2.4 Calculations Hydrogen gas production was calculated from headspace measurements of gas composition and the total volume of biogas produced, at each time interval, using the mass balance equation: (1) V H , i = V H , i - 1 + C H , i ( V G , i - V G , i - 1 ) + V H ( C H , i - C H , i - 1 ) , where V H, i and V H, i −1 are cumulative hydrogen gas volumes at the current (i) and previous (i−1) time intervals, V G ,i and V G ,i −1 the total biogas volumes in the current and previous time intervals, C H ,i and C H ,i −1 the fraction of hydrogen gas in the current and previous intervals, respectively, and V H the total volume of headspace in the reactor. The hydrogen gas composition between sampling times was calculated assuming a linear change in concentration over the sampling interval (Oh et al., 2003). Voltage in the system was monitored and recorded every 30min using a precision multimeter and a data acquisition system (2700, Keithly, OH, USA). In some tests, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (0.195V corrected to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) was placed in the anode or cathode compartments to determine individual electrode potentials. Power density was calculated according to P = IV / A ( I = V / R ) , where I (A) is the current, V (V) the voltage, R(Ω) resistance, and surface area of the anode (A). The Coulombic efficiency, E (%), was calculated as E = ( C Ex / C Th ) × 100 , where C Ex, is the total coulombs calculated by integrating the current measured at each time interval (i) over time as C Ex = ( ∑ i = 1 T V i t i ) / R . C Th, the theoretical amount of coulombs that is available from COD ( i = c ) or propionate ( i = p ) oxidation, was calculated as (2) C Th = F b i S i v M i , where F is Faraday's constant (96,485C/mol-e−), b the number of moles of electrons produced per mol of substrate ( b c = 4 , b p = 14 ), S the acetate concentration, M the molecular weight of the substrate ( M c = 32 , COD basis; M p = 74.08 ), and v the liquid volume (L)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Hydrogen in headspace of vessels was periodically measured using a gas-tight syringe (0.1mL injection volume) and a gas chromatograph (GC; Model 310, SRI Instruments, Torrence, CA, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve column (Alltech Molesieve 5A 80/100) with nitrogen as the carrier gas. Carbon dioxide and methane were similarly analyzed except that a molecular sieve column (Alltech Porapak Q 80/100) was used with helium as the carrier gas. The concentrations of several solvents (acetone, ethanol, propanol, and butanol) and organic acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) were analyzed using a GC (Agilent, 6890) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP 30m×0.32mm×0.5μm). Samples were filtered through a 0.2μm pore-diameter membrane and acidified using formic acid (0.65M) before analysis. The temperature of the GC column was started at 60°C, increased at 20°C/min to 120°C, and then 30°C/min to a final temperature of 240°C for another 3min. The temperatures of injector and detector were both 250°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 103kPa. Total carbohydrate content was determined using the phenol–sulfuric acid method (Dubois et al., 1956). Alkalinity, COD, total suspended solids (TSS), and ammonia were determined according to Standard Methods (APHA, AWA, WPCF, 1992). The concentration of dissolved COD and sugars was measured by sample filtration through membrane filters (0.2μm pore-diameter, Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Solution pH was measured using a pH probe and meter (Fisher Scientific accumet® model 10 and VWR SympHony). Conductivity was measured using a conductivity cell (Thermo Orion 011010) and meter (Thermo Orion, Model 115)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characteristics of the food processing wastewaters,"3.1 Characteristics of the food processing wastewaters COD concentrations of the wastewaters varied over a wide range (Table 1 ). The effluent during a normal production cycle (Effluent 1) had a COD of 3250±90mg/L, but decreased to 735±15mg/L during a late cleaning shift (Effluent 2). The in-plant stream obtained from the Cereal processing wastewater (Cereal) had a COD of 8920±152mg/L. The accumulated sample from all plant discharges during the day, measured in the equalization tank, had an intermediate value of 1672±50mg-COD/L (Lagoon). There were large differences between COD concentrations and total and dissolved sugar concentrations. The Cereal wastewater contained 30% dissolved sugar (COD basis), and the Effluent 1 sample contained 61% dissolved sugars. Samples collected throughout the day that were held in the collection basin (Lagoon) had a low sugar content of 6%. In general, the two Effluent samples and the Cereal wastewater samples contained low concentrations of acetate, suggesting that the samples had undergone little anaerobic fermentation prior to testing. The Lagoon sample had the highest relative concentration of acetate (19%, mass basis), however, suggesting that fermentation may have occurred in the Lagoon during storage. This decrease in sugar content would be expected to affect hydrogen production as hydrogen production is associated with sugar fermentation. TSS concentrations generally varied in proportion to COD concentrations. Ammonia concentrations were very low in all wastewaters. The initial pH of the sample, measured before the samples were buffered to a pH=6.0 for the hydrogen tests, also varied widely from 4.5 (Effluent 1) to 11.7 (Effluent 2), with the higher pH likely a result of the use of caustic cleaning products."
9,Hydrogen production from food processing wastewaters,"3.2 Hydrogen production from food processing wastewaters The addition of nutrients, and heat treatment, was not always needed to maximize hydrogen production from the four different samples (Table 2 ). For example, adding a HT inoculum and nutrients to the Cereal wastewater slightly reduced the lag time needed to reach the maximum amount of biogas production (Fig. 1A ). However, the overall hydrogen production was much larger without HT sludge and nutrients (275mL of hydrogen per liter of wastewater; mL/L) than with these additions (184mL/L) for the Cereal wastewater (Table 2). Results with the other samples varied, as sometimes hydrogen production was larger with nutrients and the HT sludge (Lagoon), while for other samples it was lower (Effluent 1 and 2). Hydrogen reached a maximum concentration of 32–39% in the headspace after 35h (Fig. 1B) for the Cereal wastewater, with lower values measured for the other samples (0–17%). However, this measured hydrogen concentration does not represent the maximum concentration of hydrogen possible as the gas that is produced (71–80mL) was diluted by the nitrogen in the headspace (31mL). Based on the observed gas production rate and dilution in the headspace using a mass balance (see Logan et al., 2002), we estimate from our mass balance calculations that hydrogen was being produced at a maximum concentration of 60–64%, with the balance as CO2. No methane gas was detected in any of the headspace measurements. One interesting result is that in the absence of both a HT inoculum and nutrients, hydrogen gas was not reconsumed following a production phase for the Cereal wastewater (Fig. 1B). In addition, there appeared to be a second phase of hydrogen production occurring after 70h. The reasons for these different results are not known, but are likely a result of the different microbial communities and conditions that developed in the different bottles. The absence of a clear trend with respect to the use of a HT inoculum and hydrogen production suggests that it might be possible to achieve continuous hydrogen production from these wastewaters in the presence of bacteria already in the wastewater, and without the need for constant nutrient addition. This need for nutrients and a HT inoculum, however, will need to be more fully investigated in future continuous reactor tests. The largest amount of hydrogen was produced using the Cereal wastewater, primarily as a result of the much higher COD of this wastewater compared to the other samples. The maximum value of 275mL of hydrogen per liter of wastewater (mL/L) was obtained for the Cereal wastewater (no nutrients or HT inoculum), which had a total COD of 8920mg/L (Table 2). The maximum hydrogen production per liter of wastewater for the other samples generally followed the same order expected on the basis of COD, with maximum values of 84mL/L for the Effluent 1 sample containing 3250mg-COD/L, with less than 33mL/L for the other two samples containing less than 1672mg-COD/L. Hydrogen yields could not be consistently predicted on the basis of sugar concentrations as the yields varied widely for the different samples and conditions, but the magnitude of the yields observed here based on sugar concentrations appear reasonable. When hydrogen production was normalized to dissolved total sugar concentrations in the different samples, hydrogen yields varied from 0 to 2.52mol of hydrogen per mol of glucose (mol-H2/mol) (Table 2). This yield is less than the theoretical maximum of 4mol-H2/mol, indicating that hydrogen production did not exceed that possible from the sugar content of these wastewaters. The hydrogen yields from the Cereal wastewater varied over a relatively small range of 0.61–0.79mol-H2/mol based on dissolved sugar concentration. The Cereal wastewater sample that did not have a HT inoculum or nutrients added to the bottles produced highest yield 0.79mol-H2/mol. Yields based on total sugars were much lower, ranging from 0 to 0.76mol-H2/mol for all of the samples tested. The average yield for the 12 tests listed in Table 2 on the basis of dissolved sugars was 1.4±0.8mol-H2/mol, slightly larger than that of 0.98mol-H2/mol obtained using glucose and a HT inoculum in batch tests (Oh et al., 2003). The fermentation of the wastewater results in a reduction of the wastewater COD due to the loss of COD as hydrogen gas. Therefore we can compare COD changes to that predicted on the basis of hydrogen production using 7.5g-glucose/g-H2 (COD basis). For the wastewater samples tested here, the overall COD removals calculated from hydrogen production ranged up to 23% (77% of the COD remaining). Specific COD removal ranges for the different samples were 5.3–7.3% (Cereal), 15–23% (Effluent 1), 16–21% (Lagoon) and 0–11% (Effluent 2). These COD losses are comparable to those of 9–17% measured using pure carbohydrates (glucose and sucrose) (Van Ginkel et al., 2001; Logan et al., 2002). The high hydrogen production results for the Cereal wastewater can therefore be attributed to the high strength of the Cereal wastewater (8920mg-COD/L) versus those of the other wastewaters (735–3250mg/L), and not a substantially different hydrogen yield. Two observations can be made based on the above results. First, total hydrogen gas production (gas volume per volume of wastewater) was the largest for the wastewater containing the highest COD. This suggests that segregation of wastewater into high- and low-strength waste streams could maximize hydrogen gas recovery based on treating a smaller (but high COD) waste stream. Second, hydrogen yields measured here in batch tests could likely be improved by using a continuous flow reactor system. For example, hydrogen yields of 1.7–2.8mol-H2/mol-glucose were measured using a HT soil inoculum in continuous culture tests (Van Ginkel and Logan, 2005) but the same inoculum hydrogen yield of only 1–1.2mol-H2/mol-glucose in batch tests (Logan et al., 2002). Similarly, Ueno et al. (1996) obtained 2.52mol-H2/mol-glucose (sugar factory wastewater), and Lay (2000) achieved 2.14mol-H2/mol-hexose (mixed culture with 0.75% soluble starch) in continuous flow tests. Based on this information, hydrogen production measured here could likely be doubled by the use of a continuous treatment system, although continuous flow tests are needed to test this prediction."
10,Electricity generation using a raw wastewater sample,"3.3 Electricity generation using a raw wastewater sample Hydrogen production was shown to be greatest for the Cereal wastewater, and therefore this wastewater was used in additional tests on electricity generation with two different MFCs. The diluted Cereal wastewater (10×) was used to demonstrate electricity generation in a two-chambered MFC. Following inoculation and start up, the reactor was switched to the diluted Cereal wastewater (TCOD=892mg/L; SCOD=595mg/L). The voltage increased rapidly to 0.29V within 5h, and voltage was gradually decreased over the next 400h as the organic matter in the reactor was degraded (Fig. 2A ). The maximum power density was 81±7mW/m2 of electricity (power normalized to the surface area of the anode carbon paper electrode) (25±2mA per liter of wastewater) during the first 200h. This power density is close to the maximum believed to be possible with this system. For example, with acetate as the substrate, the maximum power with this system was found to be 88mW/m2 (Oh et al., 2004). Coulombic efficiencies were 27.1% and 40.5% based on TCOD and SCOD, respectively. The open circuit potential (OCP) was 776mV, and the individual electrode potentials (Ag/AgCl reference electrode) were 298 and −478mV for cathode and anode, respectively. An analysis of the reactor contents produced during electricity generation tests demonstrated that sugars were rapidly reduced, resulting in the formation and release into solution of many volatile acids and alcohols typical of fermentation processes. Sugars were reduced within 50h from 230 to <30mg/L (Fig. 2B). The main volatile acid was acetate, which reached a concentration of 166mg/L followed by propionate. After 50h of reaction, the concentrations of these two volatile acids slowly decreased over the next 400h to <20mg/L. When the current generation was demonstrated to be stable (0.27V), a maximum power of 0.18mW (80mW/m2) was obtained at a current of 0.6mA by varying the resistance between the electrodes from 70 to 10,000Ω (Fig. 3 ). The treated wastewater had a final COD of 30mg/L (95% removal; initial SCOD=595mg/L). The observation that this COD is less than the BOD needed for treatment of a wastewater (<30mg-BOD/L) suggests that a process based on this MFC technology could meet conventional treatment discharge limitations if treated using this technology. However, further research is needed to better evaluate the potential for electricity generation from this wastewater."
11,Electricity generation using the biohydrogen reactor effluent,"3.4 Electricity generation using the biohydrogen reactor effluent Additional tests were conducted using the fermented effluent from the biohydrogen reactor in a single chamber MFC. This single chamber design has been shown to produce greater power densities than that achieved with the two-chamber system (Oh et al., 2004; Liu and Logan, 2004). When the biohydrogen reactor effluent was added to the reactor the voltage began to increase after 30h, and then it stabilized at 0.16mV over the next 50h (Fig. 4A ). A power density curve taken following stable power generation indicated a maximum power density of 371±10mW/m2 (53.5±1.4mA per liter of wastewater) (150Ω resistor). Thus, it was demonstrated that biohydrogen production can be successfully linked with electricity generation in a MFC. The maximum power density produced here with the biohydrogen reactor effluent is less than that obtained using glucose (494±21mW/m2, Liu et al., 2004) or acetate (506mW/m2, Liu et al., 2005) in the same system. However, this maximum power density was much larger than the power achieved using domestic wastewater in this system without the PEM (146±8mW/m2, Liu and Logan, 2004). These different power densities demonstrate that the type of organic matter can affect the maximum achievable power density achievable in this system. The physical construction of the MFC and the concentration of the organic matter are also important factors in the power generated in a MFC. The power generated using the effluent from the biohydrogen reactor in the single-chamber system was 3.5 times higher than that achieved in the two-chamber system (Fig. 3 and 4B). Part of the reason for the reduced power output is the higher internal resistance of the two-chambered system. The internal resistance of a two-chambered MFC can be lowered by increasing the surface area of the PEM (Oh and Logan, 2005) or changing the relative size of the cathode to that of the anode (Oh et al., 2004). In one chambered MFCs, this resistance can be lowered by increasing the solution conductivity or reducing the distance between the electrodes (Liu et al., 2005). The concentration of the wastewater is also important (Min and Logan, 2004; Liu et al., 2004). Due to the high concentration of the COD in the wastewater, only the maximum power generated by the wastewater was examined here, not the time needed for complete wastewater degradation. The rate of COD removal in a fixed film bioreactor is a function of the total biofilm surface area (Logan et al., 1987). In this system, the surface area in the one-chambered MFC was 0.25m2/m3, which is low compared to values of 100m2/m3 typically used in biofilm systems such as plastic media trickling filters (Logan et al., 1987). If desired, in future studies the rate of wastewater degradation could be accelerated by increasing the surface area of the electrodes per volume of wastewater."
12,Electricity generation from propionate,"3.5 Electricity generation from propionate Propionic acid was a major product of biohydrogen production, but electricity generation from propionate had not been previously studied in a MFC. To further investigate propionate removal and effect of propionate on power generation, propionate was provided as the sole electron donor to the anode chamber which containing bacteria acclimated to acetate. The reactor was acclimated to acetate and then switched to propionate. The voltage rapidly increased to ca. 0.26V (within 30min) after propionate was added demonstrating that bacteria in the reactor were immediately able to use propionate as an energy source (Fig. 5 ). The maximum power produced with propionate was 67mW/m2 (at 0.7mA), which was 25% less than that achieved with acetate (0.2mW at 0.5mA) in this system (Fig. 6 ). The Coulombic efficiencies with propionate averaged 14.5% lower than those produced using acetate. Coulombic efficiencies over four feeding cycles were 61% (1mM acetate), 50% (0.26mM propionate), 50% (0.53mM propionate), and 56% (1mM acetate). It is possible that power was produced from propionate via an acetate intermediate. Power was immediately generated when propionate was fed to the MFC, and propionate was also generated as an intermediate in MFC tests with Cereal wastewater along with acetate (see Fig. 2). However, this reaction would require rapid utilization of any hydrogen produced in the system. The conversion of propionate to acetate can occur via (3) CH 3 CH 2 COO - + 3 H 2 O → CH 3 COO - + H + + HCO 3 - + 3 H 2 . Under standard conditions, this reaction is not thermodynamically feasible ( Δ G ° ′ = 76.1 kJ ). Conversion of propionate to acetate and hydrogen is only thermodynamically possible at hydrogen concentrations <10−4 atmospheres (100ppm). However, hydrogen could have remained low in the system due to hydrogen utilization by bacteria present in our system, making conversion of propionate to acetate possible."
13,Conclusions,"Based on the experiments conducted here, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hydrogen was generated from a food processing wastewater from the bacterial fermentation of sugar in the wastewater. Assuming a theoretical maximum yield of 4mol of hydrogen per mol of glucose (mol/mol), hydrogen yields were 0.61–0.79mol/mol for the Cereal wastewater, ranged from 1 to 2.52mol/mol for the other samples. (2) Electricity generation was shown to be possible from a food processing wastewater (Cereal) and from propionate in two- or one-chambered MFC systems. A maximum power density of 81±7mW/m2 (normalized to the anode surface area) was produced using the two-chambered MFC and the Cereal wastewater (diluted 10× to 595mg-COD/L), while at the same time the final COD was reduced to <30mg/L (95% removal). Using a one-chambered MFC and the biohydrogen reactor effluent, the maximum power was 371±10mW/m2. (3) Although more studies are needed to improve hydrogen yields, these results suggest that it is possible to link a MFC to biohydrogen to recover energy from food processing wastewaters, providing a new method to offset wastewater treatment plant operating costs."
