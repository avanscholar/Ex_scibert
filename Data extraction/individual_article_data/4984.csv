0,Introduction,"The conversion of alcohols has recently gained much attention from both academia and industry, since it provides a direct chemical route to the “green” production of chemicals and energy [1]. For years, industry has intensively exploited various characteristics of zeolites, such as well-defined microporous structure, acidity and shape selectivity, for a number of alcohol conversion processes, e.g. methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) based on H-ZSM-5 by Mobil Oil [2,3] and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) based on H-SAPO-34 by Norsk Hydro/UOP [4,5], ethanol to ethylene [6] and alcohol to jet fuel [7]. However, a mechanistic understanding of the influence of the zeolite topology and acidity as well as alcohol structure on the conversion kinetics and product selectivity remains rather limited, and the elucidation of the reaction mechanism from experimental data only is extremely difficult [8–24]. One of the main topics of debate is centered on the nature and stability of alcohol–zeolite adsorption complexes that are initially formed over the Brønsted acid sites in alcohol conversion processes [16–24]. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , physisorbed (1-HB, 2-HB) and chemisorbed (oxonium) complexes are both stabilized by hydrogen bonding (HB) interactions and differ in the extent to which the zeolite acid proton is transferred to the alcohol [25,26]. In our previous dispersion-corrected periodic density functional theory studies, we have investigated the adsorption energies of the primary C1–C3 and the isomeric C4 alcohols in H-ZSM-5 [25,26]. A variety of possible geometries, including hydrogen-bonded (physisorbed) and protonated (chemisorbed) complexes, were located as stable minima, indicating that the potential energy surface connecting them is broad and very shallow [22,25,26]. The three much debated observed infrared (IR) bands at 2800–2900, 2400–2600, and 1610–1750cm−1 of C1–C4 alcohols adsorbed in zeolites [11–20] were interpreted based on harmonic frequency calculations for the most stable physisorbed and chemisorbed complexes [25,26]. The first region, 2800–2900cm−1, corresponds to the C–H stretches of both the physisorbed and chemisorbed complexes. The second region, 2400–2600cm−1, can be assigned to the H1–O1–H a symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of the chemisorbed complex. The third region, centered around 1600cm−1, may be attributed to the chemisorbed H1–O1–H a and physisorbed O a –H a bending modes [25,26]. It was found that the alcohol proton affinity, as well as dispersive van der Waals (vdW) interactions and steric constraints exerted by the H-ZSM-5 framework, governs the adsorption energies of alcohols. We argued that the reported linearity between chemisorption enthalpy and proton affinity for alcohols [27] and amines [28] is limited to the short-chain bases only. Also, the channel preference for the adsorption of C1–C4 alcohols in H-ZSM-5 was predicted based on the calculated electronic energies [23,24]. However, the entropy factor, which plays a significant role in governing the Gibbs free energy stability of the adsorbed complexes in zeolites [29–31] has not been investigated before. From the solid-state 2H NMR spectra of t-butanol and i-butanol adsorbed in H-ZSM-5, Stepanov et al. [32–34] deduced that the t-butanol molecule is unperturbed when bound to the active site. Since the critical dimension of t-butanol (680pm) significantly exceeds that of the channels (ca. 550pm), this molecule should be accommodated at the channel intersections (ca. 900pm) [30,31]. i-Butanol, however, can be located both inside the zeolite channels and at the channel intersections although the latter allow the methyl group to experience a larger rotation rate about the CH3–CH axis [34]. Mallon et al. [35] determined liquid phase adsorption isotherms for C2–C6 diols and triols in small-pore (H-FER), medium-pore (H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA), and large-pore (H-MOR and H-FAU) zeolites as well as in other ordered mesoporous materials using gravimetry. Henry constants for diol and triol adsorption increase exponentially with carbon number demonstrating that confinement of the adsorbate in the zeolite pores is the driving force for adsorption. This conclusion is supported by the decrease of the propylene glycol adsorption in the Henry regime with increasing adsorbent pore size. Moreover, Oudshoorn et al. [36] studied adsorption of n-butanol and n-butanol–water mixtures in H-FAU and H-ZSM-5 zeolites. The smaller pore zeolite, H-ZSM-5, exhibits stronger adsorption to gas-phase n-butanol. Also, for liquid phase competitive adsorption of n-butanol and water, the preference of n-butanol over water is more pronounced in H-ZSM-5. In this work, combined periodic DFT-D – statistical thermodynamic calculations [26,29,37] have been performed to quantify the adsorption thermodynamics of C1–C4 alcohols in large-pore (H-FAU and H-MOR) and medium-pore (H-ZSM-22) zeolites, next to H-ZSM-5 [25,26]. These zeolite frameworks are ideally suited to examine the framework effect since they provide different pore sizes and geometries (Fig. 2 ). This work provides predictive guidance for the influence of alcohol structure and zeolite characteristics on the adsorption equilibrium coefficients of alcohols in zeolites. Also, accounting for both entropy and enthalpy contributions leads to a more accurate prediction on the channel preference for the adsorption of the butanol isomers in H-ZSM-5."
1,Computational details,
2,Zeolite models,"2.1 Zeolite models 2-HB physisorption and chemisorption modes [25,26] together with the 1-HB physisorption mode (Fig. 1), in its proper orientation for the further dehydration step [8–10], of C1–C4 primary alcohols have been sampled in H-FAU, H-MOR, H-ZSM-5 [25], and H-ZSM-22. The geometry of all zeolite structures has been taken from the database of the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (IZA) [38,39]. H-FAU is a large-pore zeolite, characterized by supercages with diameter 1300pm that are interconnected by 12 membered rings (12-MR) with dimensions 740pm×740pm. The acid site is located at the Al1O1 position [29,40] and the primitive cell composition is Si47AlO96H (Si/Al=47). H-MOR is a large-pore zeolite characterized by 12-MR channels (670pm×790pm) in the c direction and 8-MR side-pockets (260pm×570pm) in the b direction. The unit cell is doubled in the c direction and the acid site is located at the Al4O2 position [29,41] resulting in a cell composition of Si95AlO192H (Si/Al=95). H-ZSM-5 is a medium-pore zeolite with intersecting straight (540pm×560pm) and sinusoidal or zigzag (510pm×540pm) 10-MR channels. The acid site is located at the Al12O24 intersecting position [25,26,29,41] leading to a unit cell composition of Si95AlO192H (Si/Al=95). H-ZSM-22 is a medium-pore zeolite with straight channels in the c direction with dimensions 460pm×570pm. The small primitive cell is tripled in the c direction to ensure sufficient separation of the hydrocarbon images. The acid site is located at the Al3O3 position, and the resulting unit cell composition is Si35AlO72H (Si/Al=35) [29]. All the considered zeolite unit cells have been optimized using periodic DFT-D calculations. The resultant optimized unit cell parameters (Table S1, Supporting Information) have been kept constant in all other subsequent optimizations."
3,Periodic DFT-D calculations,"2.2 Periodic DFT-D calculations 2.2.1 Electronic energy calculations Periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [42] with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [43,44]. The total energy was calculated solving the Kohn–Sham equations using the gradient-corrected Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional [45]. Brillouin zone sampling was restricted to the Γ point, and convergence criteria on the maximum force and on the electronic self-consistency loop were set at 0.02eVÅ−1 and 10−6 eV, respectively. The Bader charge analysis [46] was utilized to calculate formal charges of adsorbed alcohol fragments. In this work, the semi-empirical dispersion-corrected DFT-D approach proposed by Grimme [47] and extended to periodic calculations by Kerber et al. [48] to account for dispersive vdW interactions in the zeolite is used. The total dispersion-corrected energy of a system is thus defined as follows: (1) E DFT - D = E DFT + E D where EDFT is the self-consistent Kohn–Sham electronic energy and ED is an empirical dispersion correction given by: (2) E D = - s 6 ∑ i = 1 N - 1 ∑ j = i + 1 N C 6 i C 6 j R ij 6 f damp R ij in which N is the number of atoms in the system, f damp R ij a damping function, C 6 i the atomic coefficients and Rij the interatomic distances. The global scaling factor s 6 depends on the DFT functional used (0.75 for the PBE functional) [47,48]. 2.2.2 Frequency calculations For all structures optimized using the periodic DFT-D method, a normal mode analysis has been performed using a Partial Hessian Vibrational Analysis (PHVA). In the PHVA method, only a T5 cluster, HAl(SiO4)4, together with the adsorbate, is considered “free” for the numerical Hessian calculation. Recent studies have shown that PHVA physisorption and chemisorption entropies are practically equal to the Full Hessian Vibration Analysis (i.e. the whole zeolite unit cell and the adsorbate are relaxed) results as differences of at most 10Jmol−1 K−1 are observed [29,37]. In case spurious imaginary frequencies appeared using the standard optimization settings, a more stringent self-consistent field loop criterion (10−8 eV) was applied for re-optimization of the system and subsequent numerical Hessian calculation. Various low frequencies (<50cm−1) are obtained for adsorbed alcohols, indicating frustrated motions, including both translation and rotation of the alcohol inside the zeolite pores. Since these low frequencies have significant contributions to the entropy of the adsorbed alcohol, substitution of these low frequencies by normal modes of 50cm−1, as suggested by De Moor et al. [49], was carried out to obtain consistent results."
4,Statistical thermodynamics,"2.3 Statistical thermodynamics Standard enthalpies (ΔH0 ads ), entropies (ΔS0 ads ), and Gibbs free energies (ΔG0 ads ) are calculated from the total partition functions by statistical thermodynamic calculations [50]. The standard adsorption enthalpies consist of three contributions: the DFT-D energy, the zero-point vibrational energy, and the thermal contribution to the enthalpy. For the gas-phase molecules, the total partition function consists of translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions. For the adsorbed complexes in the various zeolites on the other hand, the immobile adsorbate method [29,37] has been applied based on the vibrational analysis [51–54]. Neither translational nor rotational motions have been observed for alcohols strongly bound to the Brønsted acid site. Previous 2H NMR studies on the dynamics of t-butanol [32,33] and i-butanol [34] adsorbed in H-ZSM-5 also indicate that the mobility of alcohol molecules is significantly reduced when hydrogen bonded to the Brønsted acid site. Hence, for the adsorbed species, the total partition function consists of vibrational contributions only."
5,Results and discussion,"Geometrical parameters and harmonic vibrational frequencies of all alcohol adsorption modes in H-FAU, H-MOR, H-ZSM-5, and H-ZSM-22 are detailed in Tables S2–S6 and Fig. S1 of the Supporting Information. The calculated vibrational frequencies agree well with observed infrared spectra [11–20] of a range of C1–C4 alcohols in H-FAU, H-MOR, H-ZSM-5, verifying the accuracy of geometry optimization in this work. Significantly higher charges are allocated on the oxonium (+0.75 to +0.78) than on the 1-HB and 2-HB (+0.10 to +0.12) mode, indicating the complete proton transfer from the zeolite to the alcohol molecule in the former mode [25,26,55,56]. Moreover, largely similar geometrical parameters and charges are observed for the oxonium complexes in the four zeolites. Upon protonation of the alcohol, H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-22 experience larger changes of the SiOAl angles than H-FAU and H-MOR. Table 1 shows minor differences between adsorption energies at 0K and adsorption enthalpies at 300K. In the temperature range of 300–800K for all zeolites, variations of adsorption enthalpies and entropies are less than 6kJmol−1 and 8Jmol−1 K−1, respectively. These small variations are practically independent of the carbon number and the zeolite framework. Therefore, adsorption enthalpies and entropies can be considered independent of temperature, in agreement with earlier work [29,37,55,56] on adsorption of alkanes and alkenes in zeolites. For brevity, total DFT-D adsorption energies at 0K as well as adsorption enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs free energies at 300K are used for further discussion (Table 1) while detailed information on DFT and D contributions to the total DFT-D adsorption energies is given in Table S7 of the Supporting Information. Generally, the dispersion term contributes 20–54% to the total DFT-D adsorption energies of the alcohol in the four zeolites. Significantly, lower dispersion contributions are obtained in H-FAU (20–26%) than in the other zeolites (25–54%). Table 1 shows that, as expected, adsorption enthalpies and entropies increase with the carbon number. For a given alcohol, the 2-HB and oxonium modes in H-FAU, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-5 are some 10–20kJmol−1 more stable than the 1-HB mode while in H-ZSM-22 all three adsorption modes have practically the same adsorption enthalpies. Clearly, in all zeolites, the potential energy surface connecting the various adsorption modes is very flat. For a given alcohol, similar adsorption entropies are calculated in all the four zeolites. In what follows, the discussion is focused on the influence of the zeolite framework, the adsorption mode and the alcohol molecular structure on adsorption energies/enthalpy, entropy and equilibrium coefficients. To evaluate the influence of the carbon number (CN) on the adsorption enthalpies and entropies, linear regression has been performed for the different adsorption modes of the C1–C4 primary alcohols: (3) Δ H ads 0 = α CN + β (4) Δ S ads 0 = γ CN + δ Based on the data reported in Table 1, the following assumptions were made for regression of adsorption enthalpies in a given zeolite: (i) identical α value for all the three different adsorption modes, (ii) identical β value for the 2-HB and oxonium modes, and (iii) identical β for all three adsorption modes in H-ZSM-22. For regression of adsorption entropies in a given zeolite, the same γ and δ are assumed for all three adsorption modes. These assumptions are acceptable in view of the high R 2 values (see Table 2 ). Note also that in the 8-MR pocket of H-MOR, adsorption has been sampled for only methanol and ethanol and therefore fitting is not considered."
6,Adsorption enthalpies,"3.1 Adsorption enthalpies 3.1.1 Influence of the carbon number Clearly, Table 2 illustrates an increase of alcohol adsorption enthalpy with increasing carbon number in all the considered zeolites. This results from the contribution of the well-known dispersive vdW interactions due to the zeolite framework [25–29,57–63], which can also be seen from the dispersion term of the total DFT-D adsorption energies (Table S7, Supporting Information). For comparison, linear regression results reported in literature for the adsorption enthalpy of alkanes, alkenes, alkoxides, and alcohols in zeolites are listed in Table 3 . Apparently, our simulated values agree well with simulated [29,57–59] and experimental [57,60,61] data for alkenes [58] and alkanes [57–63] adsorbed in H-FAU [57,58] and in H-MOR [57–63]. For H-ZSM-5, our simulated α values of −12.0 and −15.5kJmol−1 and Lee’s experimental value [27] of −15.0kJmol−1 are somewhat larger than those of physisorbed/chemisorbed alkenes (−8.2kJmol−1) [58] and physisorbed alkanes (−10.1 to −13.9kJmol−1) [57,61–63]. 3.1.2 Influence of adsorption modes The β values in Table 2 indicate a preference of some 10–20kJmol−1 for the 2-HB/oxonium modes over the 1-HB adsorption mode owing to stronger hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions in the two former modes. In H-ZSM-22, however, all three adsorption modes have similar adsorption enthalpies. As discussed above, in a given zeolite, adsorption enthalpies of alcohols, alkanes, and alkenes do not experience significantly different dispersive vdW interactions (largely similar α values). Given the similar α values for the various adsorbates in H-FAU [57,58] and in H-MOR [57–63], a comparison of the β values allows to rank the strength of the different types of adsorbate–acid site interactions. It follows that the strength of the adsorbate–acid site interaction increases in the order: 2-HB≈oxonium alcohol complexes>1-HB alcohol complexes≈ σ C–O primary alkoxides> π physisorbed alkenes>physisorbed alkanes. In H-FAU, for instance, β values decrease in the order: 2-HB/oxonium (−99kJmol−1) > 1-HB (−85kJmol−1)≈ σ C–O bond primary alkoxide complexes (−83kJmol−1)> π physisorbed alkenes (−30kJmol−1)>physisorbed alkanes (−6kJmol−1). In H-ZSM-5, however, linear fits for different types of adsorbates have significantly different α values. A direct comparison of the adsorption enthalpies shows that the adsorbate–zeolite interaction strength follows the same order as the one observed in H-FAU and H-MOR with the exception that the interactions corresponding to the 2-HB/oxonium alcohol complexes and σ C–O for primary alkoxides [58] are of the same strength. 3.1.3 Influence of zeolite frameworks Fig. 3 illustrates the influence of the zeolite framework on the adsorption enthalpies of C1–C4 primary alcohols in H-FAU, H-MOR (12-MR), H-ZSM-5, and H-ZSM-22. For the 2-HB and oxonium complexes, the adsorption enthalpy increases in the order: H-FAU≈H-MOR (12-MR)<H-ZSM-5 (straight)≈H-ZSM-22<H-ZSM-5 (zigzag). Note also that for H-MOR, higher adsorption enthalpies of methanol and ethanol are obtained in the 8-MR pocket than in the 12-MR channel due to the higher dispersive vdW interactions in the former one (Table 1). Analysis of the α and β values from Table 2 reveals that an interplay between dispersive and non-dispersive factors governs the variation of C1–C4 alcohol adsorption enthalpies with zeolite framework. As expected, α values (dispersive interactions) increase with decreasing zeolite pore dimension from the supercage of H-FAU to the zigzag channel of H-ZSM-5 [57,58]. For H-ZSM-5, the α value is larger for the zigzag channel (−15.5kJmol−1) than for the straight channel (−12.0kJmol−1), in agreement with the experimental value of −15.0kJmol−1 [27]. This result indicates a preference of the zigzag channel for C1–C4 primary alcohol adsorption [25]. In contrast to the α values, the β values do not vary monotonically with the pore size, indicating their dependence on non-dispersive interactions such as alcohol–zeolite interactions, zeolite acid strength, framework deformation/flexibility together with steric constraints imposed by the zeolite framework on the alcohol molecule. In comparison with H-MOR, H-FAU exerts lower dispersive but higher non-dispersive interactions on the 2-HB/oxonium complexes. A compromise between these factors renders alcohol adsorption enthalpies similar in H-FAU and H-MOR. Analogously, H-ZSM-5 (straight) and H-ZSM-22 have largely similar adsorption enthalpies. The largest dispersive and non-dispersive interactions account for the largest adsorption enthalpies in the zigzag channel of H-ZSM-5. For the 1-HB complexes, the adsorption enthalpy increases in the order: H-FAU≈H-MOR (12-MR)<H-ZSM-5 (straight)<H-ZSM-5 (zigzag)<H-ZSM-22. The higher adsorption enthalpies for the 1-HB mode in H-ZSM-22 result from the high β value in this zeolite, as discussed above. 3.1.4 Factors governing the oxonium–zeolite interactions In this section, the various factors governing the oxonium–zeolite interactions of C1–C4 primary alcohols in H-FAU, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-22 are discussed and compared with previously calculated data in H-ZSM-5 [25]. Fig. 4 shows that the adsorption energy, ΔEads,DFT-D , of the oxonium ion depends not only on the deprotonation energy of the zeolite (DPE) [29] but also on the intrinsic basicity of the alcohol, measured by its gas-phase proton affinity (PA) [64], and on the ion pair interaction (IPtotal ) between the positively charged oxonium ion and the negatively charged zeolite framework: (5) Δ E ads , DFT - D = DPE + PA + IP total It is noted that all the zeolite unit cells investigated have Si/Al ratios much larger than 10. According to the observations of Freude et al. [65], the influence of the Si/Al ratio on the acid strength of the hydroxyl bridging group can hence be expected to be rather limited. These authors reported that after a sharp increase, the acid strength of various zeolite samples (H-FAU, H-MOR, H-ZSM-5) becomes constant for Si/Al ratios greater than 10. Our calculations [29] show that among the four zeolites, H-FAU is the strongest acid (lowest DPE, Table 4 ) in contrast to the experimentally observed acid strength ordering H-FAU<H-MOR and H-ZSM-5 [65]. This can be attributed to the fact that the Si/Al ratio of 2.6 in the H-FAU sample used for the acid strength measurement in [65] is much smaller than the one in the H-MOR (Si/Al=7) and H-ZSM5 (Si/Al=15–40) samples. The total ion pair interaction energy, IPtotal, is composed of dispersive (IPD ) and non-dispersive (IPDFT ) contributions. The latter term includes hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interaction, deformation of the zeolite framework, and steric constraints, if any. IP interactions can be calculated as follows: (6) IP total = Δ E ads , DFT - D - DPE - PA (7) IP D = Δ E ads , D (8) IP DFT = IP total - IP D where ΔEads,DFT-D and ΔEads,D are taken from Table S7 of the Supporting Information. Values for all IP terms for the C1–C4 oxonium ions in the four zeolites are listed in Table 4. In all zeolites, the IPtotal strength decreases in going from methanol to ethanol/1-propanol and then increases from ethanol/1-propanol to 1-butanol. This order is apparently governed by an interplay between dispersive vdW (IPD ) and non-dispersive (IPDFT ) contributions. In going from methanol to 1-butanol, the IPD steadily increases while the IPDFT decreases. The lower IPDFT values for the higher alcohols seem to indicate that steric constraints imposed on the alcohol molecule increase with increasing carbon number, since, for a given zeolite, all the oxonium ions have largely similar charges and hydrogen bonding interactions. This order is analogous to that of C1–C4 amines in H-ZSM-5 [25,28]. 3.1.4.1 Influence of alcohol proton affinity Fig. 4 presents the nonlinear variation of the chemisorption energies with the experimentally measured proton affinities [64] of the C1–C4 primary alcohols in H-FAU, H-MOR, H-ZSM-5, and H-ZSM-22. In going from methanol to 1-propanol, the adsorption enthalpy increases in increments that are largely identical to the gas-phase PA differences. However, in going from 1-propanol to n-butanol, the difference in gas-phase PA is only 2kJmol−1 (see PA, Table 4) while the difference in adsorption enthalpy amounts to 5–15kJmol−1 (Table 1). This is because the adsorption energy of the alcohols is governed not only by the gas-phase PA but also by the ion pair interaction, IPtotal . These two factors do not vary to the same extent in going from methanol to n-butanol (Table 4). Analogous to our calculations, Parrillo et al. [28] also observed from a calorimetric study of simple bases in H-ZSM-5 that n-butylamine significantly deviates from the linear ΔH0 ads -PA correlation line for ammonia, methylamine, ethylamine, and isopropylamine. 3.1.4.2 Influence of deprotonation energy, electrostatic interaction, framework flexibility, and steric constraints To point out the influence of the non-dispersive factors, H-FAU is taken as the reference, and the difference in adsorption enthalpy between one zeolite and H-FAU can be expressed as: (9) Δ ( Δ H ads 0 ) = Δ H ads 0 ( H - ZeO ) - Δ H ads 0 ( H - FAU ) Combining Eqs. (3) and (9) leads to: (10) Δ ( Δ H ads 0 ) = Δ ( α ) CN + Δ ( β ) Analogously, combining Eqs. (5) and (9) allows to express Δ(ΔEads,DFT-D ) as: (11) Δ ( Δ E ads , DFT - D ) = Δ ( IP D ) + Δ ( DPE ) + Δ ( IP DFT ) Values of Δ(α)CN, Δ(β), Δ(IPD ), and Δ(DPE)+Δ(IPDFT ) are listed in Table 5 . Clearly, a compensation between the DPE and the IPDFT leads to the small variations of β with the zeolite framework. In comparison with H-FAU, the other zeolites have lower acid strength (higher DPE) but higher IPDFT (Table 5). The latter increases in the order: H-FAU<H-MOR≈H-ZMS-22<H-ZSM-5 (straight)≈H-ZSM-5 (zigzag) (Table 5). Since the oxonium ions have similar charges and most likely experience similar hydrogen bonding with the zeolite, the other terms contributing to the IPDFT , i.e. the long-range electrostatic interactions with the zeolite framework, framework deformation/flexibility, and steric constraints, can be expected to govern the ordering of IPDFT among the different zeolites. To tentatively evaluate the contribution of the long-range electrostatic interactions to IPDFT in the various zeolites, the charge distribution in the vicinity of the oxonium ion–acid site complex was probed using local potential (LOCPOT) calculations within the VASP code [42]. In this method, the electrostatic potential is evaluated from the interaction between a negative unit charge and the local charge density. The maximum electrostatic potential values computed for all chemisorbed complexes are listed in Table S8 of the Supporting Information. Fig. 5 presents the electrostatic potential mapped on the OaO1Ob surface of the n-butoxonium ion while that of the other C1–C3 oxonium ions are given in Figs. S2–S4 of the Supporting Information. The O a O1O b surface was chosen since it crosses the HaO1H1 group of the oxonium ion and most atoms in the hosting ring of the acid site. More positive values (red) indicate regions in the O a O1O b surface with a more pronounced negative charge. Apparently, the electrostatic interactions between the positively charged oxonium ion and the zeolite frame can be expected to increase in the order H-FAU<H-ZSM-5≈H-MOR<H-ZSM-22, in consistence with the computed maximum electrostatic potential values (Table S8, Supporting Information). In H-FAU, the weakest electrostatic interactions well explain the lowest IPDFT value as mentioned above. Though sensing stronger electrostatic interactions in H-ZSM-22 than in H-MOR (Fig. 5), the n-butoxonium ion experiences largely similar IPDFT in the two zeolites (see Tables 4 and 5). Possibly, the smaller 10-MR channel of the former zeolite imposes larger steric constraints on the oxonium ion than the 12-MR channel of the latter zeolite and consequently destabilizes the oxonium ion to a greater extent. Since H-ZSM-5 is not expected to exert the strongest electrostatic interactions (Fig. 5), the highest IPDFT in H-ZSM-5 most likely results from the high flexibility of this zeolite framework in the vicinity of the acid site as illustrated by the aforementioned large changes of the SiOAl angles upon protonation of the alcohols. The high framework flexibility of H-ZSM-5 is also reported to allow this zeolite to outperform H-FAU, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-22 in stabilizing the chemisorbed alkenes (alkoxides) [29,58]. With the obtained insight into the non-dispersive factors, the ordering of β as seen before can be well explained. Clearly, the high β value in H-FAU results from the high acid strength (low DPE) of this zeolite (see Eqs. (10) and (11) and Table 5), while in H-ZSM-5 it can be attributed to the high flexibility of this framework. An interplay between steric constraints and electrostatic interactions render H-MOR and H-ZSM-22 equally effective in stabilizing the oxonium cations."
7,Adsorption entropies,"3.2 Adsorption entropies 3.2.1 Influence of the carbon number As expected, Table 2 indicates an increase in adsorption entropy losses with increasing carbon number, in agreement with earlier theoretical [57,59–63] and experimental [57,60–62] work on the adsorption of alkanes [57,59–63] and alkenes [58] in zeolites. The γ values for adsorption of the alcohols reasonably agree with experimental and simulated γ values for alkenes and alkanes adsorbed in H-FAU, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-5 [57,58,60,61]. Note also that existing literature, to our knowledge, reveals a large shortage of alcohol adsorption entropy data. Pope [66] measured the adsorption entropy of methanol in H-ZSM-5 and silicalite at 323K to be about −140 and −80Jmol−1 K−1, respectively. Our calculated values for methanol in H-ZSM-5 are in the range of −153 to −163Jmol−1 K−1. 3.2.2 Influence of adsorption modes As for the β values for adsorption enthalpies, the δ values for different adsorbate–zeolite interactions vary in the same manner except for a large similarity between the 2-HB/oxonium alcohol complexes and σ C–O primary alkoxides [56] in H-FAU (−155 vs. −163Jmol−1 K−1), H-MOR (−155 vs. −149Jmol−1 K−1), and H-ZSM-5 (−147 and −149 vs. −150Jmol−1 K−1). These results seem to indicate that the hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions and the covalent σ C–O primary bond render the corresponding adsorbed complexes immobile to the same extent. 3.2.3 Influence of zeolite frameworks Fig. 6 illustrates that chemisorption entropy losses do not vary monotonically in going from H-FAU to H-ZSM-22. While γ values increase with decreasing pore size of the zeolites, δ values vary in a different manner (Table 2). Generally, adsorption entropy losses in the four zeolites are largely of the same order (Tables 1 and 2). Analogous results are also observed for chemisorption entropies of linear alkenes to primary alkoxides in H-FAU, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-5 [56]. Clearly, many other factors next to the zeolite pore dimension may govern the adsorption entropies upon formation of strongly hydrogen-bonded alcohol complexes. Evaluation of the various translational, rotational, and vibrational entropy contributions to the total entropy loss is much less straightforward than the evaluation of the various enthalpy contributions [29,58]. Regarding channel preference for methanol and ethanol in H-MOR, the smaller 8-MR pocket causes somewhat larger entropy losses than the 12-MR channel. For C1–C4 primary alcohols in H-ZSM-5, no appreciable difference in adsorption entropy losses is observed between the straight and zigzag channels. 3.2.4 Entropy losses corresponding to ion–pair interactions Analogous to Eq. (6) and (12) allows calculation of the entropy loss (ΔSIP ) corresponding to the IPtotal from the ΔS0 ads , the deprotonation entropy (DPS) of the zeolite [29] and the protonation entropy (PS) of the alcohol in gas phase [64]. Values of ΔSIP , DPS and PS are all listed in Table 6 . (12) Δ S IP = Δ S ads 0 - DPS – PS Due to a cancelation between the DPS (84–95Jmol−1 K−1) and the –PS (98–103Jmol−1 K−1) (Table 6), the ΔSIP values are equal to those of ΔS0 ads (Table 1). Also, Table 6 shows that the entropy loss (ΔSIP ) increases with increasing carbon number and is largely similar among the four different zeolites, in agreement with the observation for the ΔS0 ads ."
8,Enthalpy–entropy compensation effects,"3.3 Enthalpy–entropy compensation effects With increasing carbon number, the adsorption entropy and enthalpy have an inverse effect on the adsorption Gibbs free energy. This well-known compensation effect has been observed experimentally [57,60–62] as well as theoretically [57–59,63] for the physisorption of alkanes [57,59–63] and alkenes [58] in various zeolites. In this study, an analogous interplay between adsorption enthalpy and entropy is also observed for C1–C4 primary alcohols in all zeolites as shown in Fig. 7 . For a given adsorption enthalpy, entropy losses are larger in H-FAU and H-MOR than in H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-22. This compensation effect can also be expressed as: (13) - Δ S ads 0 = ε - Δ H ads 0 + ζ Values of the parameters ε and ζ can be found in Table 7 . For comparison, the values of ε and ζ for 2/3/4-alkenes chemisorption leading to secondary alkoxides in H-FAU, H-MOR (12-MR), and H-ZSM-5 (intersection of the straight and zigzag channel) [58] are also presented. Both for the oxonium ions and the secondary alkoxides [58], the largest values of ε and the lowest values of ζ are observed in H-FAU."
9,Adsorption equilibrium coefficients,"3.4 Adsorption equilibrium coefficients Adsorption equilibrium coefficients, Kads , are important thermodynamic quantities as they determine the amount of alcohol adsorbed in the zeolite pores at a given partial pressure of the gas-phase alcohol. Adsorption equilibrium coefficients have been calculated for all the primary alcohols in the range of 300–800K in H-FAU, H-BEA, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-5 using Eq. (14). (14) ln K ads = - 1 T Δ H ads 0 R + Δ S ads 0 R where adsorption enthalpies and entropies are calculated using α, β, γ, and δ parameters in Table 2. Adsorption equilibrium coefficient values for all the adsorption modes of C1–C4 alcohols at different temperatures are detailed in Table S9 of the Supporting Information. The 2-HB/oxonium adsorption modes have much larger ln Kads values than the 1-HB mode in H-FAU, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-5. In H-ZSM-22, however, all the three modes have largely similar ln Kads values. These results are consistent with the aforementioned discussion on adsorption entropy and enthalpy in the four zeolites. Hereafter, we discuss the influence of the carbon number, zeolite framework, and temperatures on the adsorption equilibrium coefficients corresponding to the 2-HB/oxonium modes (Figs. 8 and 9 ). Similar conclusion can be deduced for the 1-HB mode. 3.4.1 Influence of the carbon number In all zeolites, ln(Kads ) values increase in going from methanol to n-butanol (Fig. 8), in agreement with experimental observations on the liquid phase adsorption of C2–C6 diols and C3–C6 triols in different zeolites [35]. Also, the adsorption preference for the higher alcohols is more pronounced in H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-22 than in H-FAU and H-MOR (Fig. 8). These results demonstrate the crucial role of the vdW interactions as the driving force for alcohol adsorption in zeolites [35] and agrees with previous experimental [57] and theoretical [58] findings for adsorption of alkanes and alkenes in zeolites. At higher temperatures, the influence of entropy losses becomes more prominent and results in a decreased preference for adsorption of the higher alcohols (Table S9, Supporting Information). 3.4.2 Influence of zeolite frameworks The influence of the zeolite framework on ln(Kads ) can be observed in Fig. 9. At 300K, adsorption is significantly less favored in the 12-MR (H-FAU and H-MOR) than in the 10-MR (H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-22) zeolites, in agreement with the experimental observations of liquid phase adsorption of propylene glycol in different zeolites [35]. This results from the stronger adsorption enthalpy in the latter zeolites. Note that adsorption entropy losses for a given alcohol are of the same order in H-FAU, H-MOR (12-MR), H-ZSM-5, and H-ZSM-22 (straight and zigzag channel) and that they increase with carbon number. Hence, the preference for adsorption of the higher alcohols in the 10-MR zeolites becomes less pronounced with increasing temperature as expected (Eq. (14)). In H-MOR, neither the 8-MR pocket nor the 12-MR channel exhibits an appreciable preference for methanol or ethanol adsorption (Table S9, Supporting Information), owing to a compensation between adsorption enthalpy and adsorption entropy: adsorption enthalpies are more exothermic in the 8-MR pocket but entropy losses are smaller in the 12-MR channel. In H-ZSM-5, methanol equally adsorbs in the straight and zigzag channel, however, the C2–C4 alcohols prefer the latter channel to maximize the enthalpy contribution. Moreover, this preference for the zigzag channel increases with the CN, indicating the important role of dispersive vdW interactions."
10,Adsorption thermodynamics of the butanol isomers in H-ZSM-5,"3.5 Adsorption thermodynamics of the butanol isomers in H-ZSM-5 As extension to our DFT-D calculations on adsorption of butanol isomers in H-ZSM-5 [26], this present work explores the influence of entropy next to energy/enthalpy on the preference of butanol isomers to adsorb either at the straight or zigzag channel of H-ZSM-5 (Table 8 and Fig. 10 ). In agreement with the DFT-D calculations [26], at the straight channel, all butanol isomers have similar adsorption enthalpies (−143 to −148kJmol−1), while at the zigzag channel, the highest adsorption enthalpy for n-butanol (−162kJmol−1) and the lowest adsorption enthalpy for t-butanol (−139kJmol−1) are observed. At both the channels, t-butanol experiences higher entropy losses than the other isomers (−189 to −205 vs. −183 to −198Jmol−1 K−1). On comparison between the two channels, somewhat higher entropy losses are obtained at the zigzag channel for i-butanol, 2-butanol, and t-butanol (−179 to −189 vs. −190 to −205Jmol−1 K−1). Fig. 10 compares adsorption Gibbs free energies of butanol isomers between the straight and zigzag channel in the temperature range of 300–800K. Apparently, adsorption of n-butanol is more preferred at the zigzag channel at all temperatures. In agreement with previous DFT-D calculations [26], the preference of the zigzag channel for 2-butanol is observed at low temperatures but becomes insignificant at higher temperatures. For i-butanol, neither the straight nor the zigzag channel exhibits a preference for i-butanol at 300K, in agreement with observed 2H NMR study by Stepanov et al. [34]. With increasing temperature, i-butanol selectively adsorbs at the straight channel to minimize entropy losses. t-Butanol, however, prefers the straight channel in the whole temperature range. This trend becomes more prominent with increasing temperature, corresponding to the dominant role of entropy at higher temperatures. Previous 2H NMR studies [32] also observed the favorable adsorption of t-butanol at the intersection to avoid the steric constraints in the zigzag channel. Our previous work confirmed that the destabilizing steric constraints are well compensated by vdW interactions in the zigzag channel [26], leading to largely similar adsorption enthalpy between the straight and zigzag channel (Table 8). Probably, the enhanced entropy loss disfavors t-butanol to chemisorb in the latter channel. To illustrate the significance of channel preference in H-ZSM-5, adsorption equilibrium coefficients at 300K are calculated (Table 8). Kads at 300K of n-butanol is about 2 orders of magnitude larger in the zigzag than in the straight channel (2.8×1018 bar−1 >1.1×1016 bar−1). Also, a preference by about a factor of 10 is observed for 2-butanol in the former channel (3.3–5.1×1016 >2.1–3.6×1015 bar−1). For i-butanol, Kads is of the same order in the two channels. For t-butanol, however, the straight channel prevails over the zigzag channel by about two orders of magnitude. On comparison of the most stable adsorbed species of each alcohol, the adsorption equilibrium coefficients at 300K decrease in the order: n-Butanol (zigzag channel, 2.8×1018 bar−1)>2-butanol (zigzag channel, 5.1×1016 ×bar−1),> i-butanol (straight channel, 4.7×1015 bar−1)≈ t-butanol (straight channel, 3.9×1015 bar−1)."
11,Conclusions,"The combined periodic DFT-D – statistical thermodynamic approach allows quantification of adsorption enthalpies, entropies and equilibrium coefficients for C1–C4 primary alcohols in all four zeolites and for the butanol isomers in H-ZSM-5. Regression of adsorption enthalpies against the carbon number enables analyzing the various dispersive and non-dispersive interactions that govern the adsorption strength of C1–C4 primary alcohols in zeolites. In agreement with experimental data, adsorption equilibrium coefficients of C1–C4 primary alcohols increase with increasing carbon number, indicating the significant role of dispersive vdW interactions. This conclusion is also corroborated by the increase of adsorption equilibrium coefficients with decreasing pore size of the zeolites. The interplay between various other factors, such as hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions, zeolite acid strength, framework deformation/flexibility, and steric constraints, renders non-dispersive interactions largely similar among the four zeolites. Of the non-dispersive factors, the electrostatic interactions exerted by the zeolite framework are shown to be a decisive factor to stabilize positively charged oxonium ions formed in the zeolite pore. Among the four zeolites, the supercage of H-FAU exerts very weak electrostatic interactions and therefore is not favorable for stabilization of cationic ions. The shape selectivity as experimentally observed in the adsorption of the four butanol isomers at the straight and zigzag channels of H-ZSM-5 is well rationalized based on a compensation between entropy and enthalpy. The adsorption of linear chain (n-butyl and 2-butyl) alcohols is preferred inside the zigzag channel to maximize the enthalpy contribution. Plausibly, the linear chains of these alcohols allow to minimize steric constraints, if any, imposed by the narrower zigzag channel. On the other hand, bulky (t-butyl) alcohols are selectively adsorbed at the extended straight channel, hence minimizing adsorption entropy losses. Adsorption of i-butanol, however, is equally favored by the straight and zigzag channel. This work demonstrates that the dispersive vdW interactions are crucial in governing the experimentally observed adsorption strength ordering of alcohols in the zeolite. Among the non-dispersive factors, the long-range electrostatic interactions exerted by the zeolite framework, which have not been frequently discussed in literature, are shown to be a decisive factor to stabilize positively charged oxonium ions and carbocations formed in the zeolite pore in various industrial catalytic processes such as alcohol conversion, hydrocracking, and isomerization. Also, results reported here clearly indicate the necessity for inclusion of entropy next to enthalpy in the study of shape selectivity of the zeolite framework."
