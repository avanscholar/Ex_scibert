0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a clean oxidant and an efficient energy carrier. The demand of H2O2 in chemical industry and environment cleanup is facing rapid growth. Photocatalytic H2O2 production (PHOP) on semiconductor materials is a promising and sustainable alternative for the commercialized anthraquinone method [1–8]. In the process, H2O2 is produced by oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to utilize photogenerated electrons through a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process [9–12]. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, GCN) is a broad type of metal-free polymeric photocatalyst consisting of triazine or tri-s-triazine units [13–18]. Compared with metal oxide-based photocatalysts (like TiO2 or BiVO4), GCN is more promising for PHOP because of the advantages including a selective 2e-ORR pathway through forming 1,4-endoperoxide intermediates, and the suppressed H2O2 decomposition due to the moderate oxidative ability of holes and poor adsorption of H2O2 [13,16,19–23]. However, the performance of GCN is limited by the insufficient surface area and lack of diversity in the types of active sites. Moreover, sacrificial alcohols such as ethanol (EtOH) and isopropanol (IPA) are frequently employed as the source of electrons and protons because of the sluggish water oxidation [11,12,24,25]. Aldehyde or ketone was found as the main oxidation products [5,19]. However, the adsorption and oxidation of the alcohol over GCN are retarded due to the naturally lack of Lewis acidic sites in this material [26,27]. This results in relative high concentrations (mostly ≥5 vol%) of alcohols are required to realize observable H2O2 production. It is significant to facilitate alcohol oxidation according to the coupling mechanism of the selective ORR in PHOP. Several strategies were developed to improve PHOP over the carbon nitride (CN) based materials, such as creation of nanopores or carbon/nitrogen vacancies [28–30], modification with anthraquinone [31] or black phosphorus [32], development of water-soluble materials with high surface areas [33], incorporation of the diimide units to improve oxidation power of holes [20], and incorporation of heteroatoms like K, P and O [3–5]. Among them, K doped CN displays enhanced performance in diverse photocatalytic reactions [5,34–41]. These materials were generally synthesized by molten salt methods with various CN precursors, K sources and calcination conditions, and showed either triazine or tri-s-triazine structures. Their better performance was previously attributed to improved crystallinity [36], suppressed recombination [37,41], the enhanced basicity [34], or introduction of more defects [40]. However, there are very few discussions on the role of the heteroatom K, which can intercalate into the CN scaffold and directly act as the active sites in the photocatalysis. The consideration of the critical role of the intercalated K would favor the understanding of the photocatalytic processes like alcohol oxidation and ORR at a molecular level. Herein, we realized dramatically enhanced PHOP on K intercalated CN materials at a relatively low concentration of IPA, found a positive correlation between the intercalated potassium contents and the performance in PHOP of these materials, and accordingly, unveiled the critical role of K in the creation of synergistic active sites for efficient PHOP."

4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Rigaku D/max-2200/PC diffractometer with a Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Electron). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a TECNA1 G2F20 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The chemical compositions and elemental contents were determined by using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD, Shimadu-kratos) and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF, XRF-1800, Shimadzu), respectively. The optical properties of samples were investigated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/vis system.

After removing physical-adsorption O2 (CO2, NH3) through 30-min He sweep (30 cm3/min), the samples were heated to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The gas signals were recorded by a TCD detector."
5,Photocatalytic H2O2 production,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2O2 production In a typical test, 30 mg of catalyst was dispersing in a 30 ml isopropanol (IPA, 0.5 vol%) solution in a quartz cuvette. The suspension was continuously purged with O2 (0.5 l/min) and irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight) with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). The initial solution pH was adjusted by 1 M HClO4 or NaOH. The samples were taken at a predetermined time interval, and then filtered through 0.22 μm filter membranes for H2O2 measurements. H2O2 concentration was determined by a modified DPD-POD method [9,42]. The apparent quantum yields (AQY) for H2O2 production were measured under monochromatic light produced from a 500 W Xe lamp with band-pass filters (Text S1). In order to track the produced acetone in photocatalytic IPA oxidation, the PHOP experiments were carried out without continuous O2 purge, and the produced acetone was detected by GC-FID (Shimadzu, GC-2010) analyses."

8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The high crystallized structures of KTCN and KTTCN are confirmed by XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. 1 A, KTTCN features two pronounced diffraction peaks at 8.0° and 28.2°, corresponding to the (100) and (002) facts of tri-s-triazine carbon nitride [36]. While various diffraction peaks at 12.0°, 20.8°, 24.0°, 26.4°, 29.2° and 32.1° are observed for KTCN, which is consistent with the reported CN materials consisting of triazine basic units [38,43]. This can also be indicated by their FTIR spectra (Fig. 1B), in which the band at 802 cm−1 are attributed to the out-of-plane bending mode of triazine or tri-s-triazine rings. The stretching modes of ν (-NH2) and ν (-NH-) at 3000−3500 cm−1 are significantly declined, accompanying with the emerging peak at 2150 cm−1 for terminal cyano groups [28], which indicates the improved crystalline of KTCN and KTTCN by the sufficient condensation. The morphologies of as-prepared catalysts are observed by TEM. KTCN shows a hollow tube assembly of hexagonal units (Fig. 1C-D), which is similar with the reported triazine-based CN materials [38,43]. KTTCN exhibits a strip-like structure with clear lattice fringes corresponding to 0.998 nm (Fig. 1E-F), which is assigned to the in-plane repeated units. As for MCN, the coexistence of the diffraction peaks of KTCN and KTTCN in XRD patterns indicate the formation of a heterojunction (Fig. 1A). Moreover, MCN exhibits a structure consisting of both the tube and strip-like morphologies in the TEM images (Fig. 1G-H)."
10,Photocatalytic H2O2 production,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2O2 production Fig. 2 A shows PHOP over the four catalysts under visible light (λ > 420 nm) at neutral pH ( = 7.0) in the presence of only 0.5 vol% IPA. The performance of GCN is very poor, with only 56 μM H2O2 production during 150 min irradiation. However, the catalysts prepared with the salt melts display greatly enhanced performance. H2O2 production over KTCN, MCN and KTTCN reaches 650, 1200 and 1800 μM, respectively. In addition, MCN (1:1) and MCN (5:1) can produce 580 and 920 μM of H2O2, respectively. This suggests that the optimal ratio of melamine and pre-heated melamine for MCN is 1:5 (Fig. S1). In the absence of IPA, only 50 μM of H2O2 can be detected in the suspensions (Fig. 2B), suggesting that H2O oxidation by the photoexcited holes scarcely contributes to PHOP. Moreover, the increase of IPA concentrations can promote H2O2 production. In the presence of 20 vol% IPA, more than 5.6 mM H2O2 is produced in the first 60 min. Upon a prolonged irradiation at this condition, H2O2 concentration continuously increases to 30 mM at the 10th hour and then maintains stable (Fig. S2A), which is a relatively high value for the CN-based materials (Table S1). The curves of H2O2 production fits well with the kinetic equation (Text S5), and the formation rate constant (kf ) is as large as 103 μM min−1. The performance can be further improved by using aromatic alcohols like furfural alcohol or benzyl alcohol [24], which can result in more than 4 mM H2O2 production in 150 min (Fig. S2B). The IPA oxidation product, acetone, increases with the increase of illumination time (Fig. S3). The stoichiometric ratio for acetone and H2O2 is almost 1:1 within the first 60 min, which suggests the coupling processes of IPA oxidation and H2O2 production [19]. Different from metal oxide catalysts, KTTCN is less sensitive to pH values for H2O2 production (Fig. 2C). The produced H2O2 does not change obviously with pH from 5 to 9, but shows a slight decrease at pH 3. This suggests that the contribution of protons in water is low, and PHOP on KTTCN may not be a one-electron dominated ORR pathway [44,45]. The source of protons in the produced H2O2 was further evaluated by using the aprotic solvents including n-Hexane, CH2Cl2 and CH3CN to substitute water in an airtight reactor. As shown in Fig. S4, negligible H2O2 production was observed in absence of IPA, while in the presence of IPA, 230, 400 and 3000 μM H2O2 can be produced within 60 min in n-Hexane, CH2Cl2 and CH3CN, respectively. This indicates that IPA is the main proton source of H2O2 in the PHOP. The apparent quantum yields (AQY) value at 400 nm on KTTCN is 20 % in the presence of only 0.5 vol% IPA. The dependence of AQY with the incident wavelength can fit well with the DRS spectrum of KTTCN (Fig. 2D), suggesting that PHOP strongly depends on the optical absorption of this material."
11,Mechanism discussion,"3.3 Mechanism discussion The origin of the excellent performance of KTTCN in photocatalytic H2O2 production were explored. The BET surface areas (Table S2) are 24.3, 33.6, 45.6 and 57.7 m2/g for GCN, KTCN, MCN and KTTCN, respectively. Although the surface area of KTTCN is about 2.4 times that of GCN, PHOP on the former is 32 times of that on the latter one. This indicates that the improved performance of KTTCN cannot be completely explained by the increased surface area. The optical absorption spectra of the catalysts show the same tendency as their BET surface areas (Fig. 3 A), which can be understood by the enhanced light harvest of catalysts with higher surface areas and larger pore volumes [15,46,47]. However, the changes of band gaps obtained from Tauc plots are negligible (Fig. 3B). The energy levels of catalysts are investigated by the Mott-Schottky measurements (Fig. S5). The conduction band and valance band positions (ECB and EVB) for KTCN and GCN are comparable, while these positions for KTTCN negatively shift. This is consistent with the previous reports [43]. However, H2O2 production for the three materials cannot be explained by their changed band positions, because compared to GCN, KTCN shows significant improved H2O2 production but negligible changes in band positions. The electron-transfer numbers (n) for ORR on the catalyst-coated rotating disc electrodes (RDE) were determined from the linear fitted Koutecky-Levich plots [48,49] (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6). They are 2.1, 2.2, 2.2 and 2.5 for GCN, KTCN, KTTCN and MCN, respectively. This indicates that ORR over all the catalysts are dominated by the 2e pathway. The relatively higher n value for MCN may be attributed to the fact that the enhanced charge transfer can simultaneously accelerate H2O2 reduction on this material. As shown in Fig. 3D, the high crystallized samples have better performance in charger carriers transfer, as proved by their weaker PL intensities than GCN [36]. MCN displays the lowest PL intensity, corresponding to the accelerated interfacial electron-hole separation across the junctions, which is consistent with its highest activity in water splitting [38,43]. However, MCN is much inferior to KTTCN in PHOP. Therefore, the promoted charge separation cannot explain the origin of the enhanced performance of KTTCN in PHOP According to XRF (Table S3) and XPS analyses (Fig. S7), there are significant contents of K but negligible Li and Cl in the crystallized CN materials. We can observe a significant linear correlation between K contents and H2O2 production (at 150 min) or kf values (Fig. 4 A and Table S3). Furthermore, we tuned the K content by soaking KTTCN in boiling water for 4 h (KTTCN4h) and 8 h (KTTCN8h) to partially remove intercalated K. The XRD patterns demonstrate their crystallized tri-s-triazine-based structures do not change after treatment (Fig. S8A). However, H2O2 production within 150 min gradually reduces from 1800 μM to 1350 μM, accompanying with the K contents decrease from original 6.7 wt% to 2.5 wt% in KTTCN8h (Fig. S8B). NaCN was synthesized by using the mixture of NaCl and LiCl as the molten salt according to the same procedure as that for KTTCN. The XRD pattern (Fig. S9A) of NaCN exhibits a heterojunction structure (like MCN) containing both triazine and tri-s-triazine units. The H2O2 production (Fig. S9B) for NaCN is only 390 μM in 60 min, much lower than that for MCN (800 μM) and KTTCN (1260 μM). This suggests that the intercalated K play a significant role in the formation of tri-s-triazine units and photocatalytic production of H2O2. DFT calculation shows that K intercalation can induce reduction of total energies, which are 48.9 and 19.5 kcal/mol for tri-s-triazine and triazine units, respectively. This verifies that K intercalation favors to stabilize the CN materials and form crystalline products with less defects and vacancies [36]. KTTCN has more stable structure with much larger negative energy, which can be attributed to the fact that the space of the cavity in the three-neighboring tri-s-triazine rings is smaller and more proper for the sizes of K cations. Remarkably, the intercalated K introduces redistributed charge density (Fig. 4B and Fig. S10). For the tri-s-triazine units, after K introduction, the negative charge densities on N2 (pyridine nitrogen in the rings) increase to a certain extent. The nitrogen sites act as both Brönsted and Lewis basic sites, which are conducive to deprotonation of IPA and activation of O2 [16,50,51]. The increased electron density at these sites indicated the strengthened basicity, which can be supported by the TPD of CO2 (Fig. 5 A and S11). The CO2-TPD demonstrates that KTCN, MCN and KTTCN exhibit 2.0, 4.4 and 6.7-fold CO2 adsorption on GCN. Besides, KTTCN has the highest CO2 desorption peak at a temperature of approximately 129 °C, corresponding to the strongest Lewis base strength and density on this K intercalated material [34,52]. Simultaneously, the intercalated K atoms possesses the highest positive charged density in KTTCN, indicating that they can act as Lewis acidic sites and participate in IPA adsorption. This is well demonstrated by the NH3-TPD results and DFT calculation (Fig. 5B and 5C). GCN has negligible NH3 adsorption owing to the naturally lack of acidic sites, while the adsorbed NH3 quantity on KTCN, MCN and KTTCN increases to 0.05, 0.09 and 0.24 mmol/g, respectively. The uplifted desorption peak suggests NH3 adsorption was strengthened. Accordingly, the emerged acidic sites by K intercalation can facilitate IPA adsorption through the formation bond with oxygen in IPA. This was further proved by the changes in IPA adsorption energies ( E a d ) based on DFT calculation. The IPA adsorption energies on GCN and KTTCN are -0.91 and -2.79 eV, respectively. The more negative value for IPA adsorption on KTTCN indicates that the conformation of IPA exothermal adsorption on KTTCN is much more stable. Moreover, the top views of the optimized geometries are shown in the inset Fig. 5C. The bond length of CO for IPA adsorption on KTTCN increases to 1.451 Å, about 0.02 Å longer than that on GCN; the distance between O and K in IPA/KTTCN is also about 0.01 Å shorter than the smallest distance between O and N in IPA/GCN. This suggests that K intercalation favors IPA adsorption and CO bond weakening. The facilitated photocatalytic oxidation of IPA over KTTCN can be indicated by the photocurrent decay of the catalyst film electrodes [53–56]. In the blank NaClO4 solution, the steady state photocurrent density of KTTCN and GCN are 0.23 and 0.06 μA/cm2 (Fig. S12), respectively. The presence of IPA result in 3.0 and 2.7-fold current multiplication (Fig. 5D), which cause from the additive consumption of holes and the current double effect of IPA [57]. The photocurrent decay with the addition of IPA represent the capture of surface photogenerated holes by the adsorbed IPA. According to the well fitted double-exponential model (Equation S2), the decay rate constants k1 (fast surface related reaction) and k2 (slow interfacial-related reaction) for GCN were 0.098 and 0.007 s−1, respectively; while for KTTCN they increase by 4.8 and 6.8 times, respectively. Therefore, K intercalation can facilitate adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation of IPA by synergistically creating acidic and strengthening basic sites in the CN materials. O2 adsorption on the catalysts is prerequisite for its conversion in PHOP [58–60]. According to the O2-TPD shown in Fig. 6 A, GCN exhibits an O2 desorption peak at around 105 °C with 0.35 cm3/g STP of adsorption quantity. KTTCN demonstrates 5.1 times of O2 adsorption capacity, and the desorption peak ascends to around 207 °C. The sample KTTCN8h with reduced K contents shows less O2 adsorption (0.958 cm3/g STP) and a downward shift of the desorption peak (195 °C). This suggests that the introduction of K can enhance the chemisorption ability and capability of O2. This is consistent with the changes of adsorption energies of O2, whose optimized geometries obtained by DFT calculation are shown in Fig. 6B and 6C. The adsorption energy on KTTCN is -2.64 eV, more than double of that on GCN (-1.01 eV). According to above discussion, the efficient PHOP on KTTCN can be understood by Scheme 1 . K intercalation modulates Lewis acidic-basic sites on the CN framework. IPA adsorption is enhanced by the Lewis acidic sites, and the chemically adsorbed IPA molecule (i) releases a proton, which tends to bind the Lewis basic site (N2). The C2 neighboring with the two N2 atoms naturally exists in an oxidized form with positive charge density. Upon illumination, they can be reduced by photogenerated electrons, followed by reoxidation to their preferred state upon O2 chemically adsorption [61] (ii). Then, the α-H of IPA can be abstracted and followed by IPA oxidation, and the released proton tends to bind another adjacent basic site (iii). The Lewis acid-base sites synergistically facilitate IPA adsorption and hydrogen abstraction, both of which are the possible rate-determining steps in IPA oxidation and H2O2 production. The formed peroxides can finally capture two protons to produce H2O2, and KTTCN is recovered for next photocatalytic cycles (iv)."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we synthesized a series of K intercalated triazine or tri-s-triazine CN for PHOP, which can produce the highest 1800 μM of H2O2 in 150 min by using a low concentration of IPA (only 0.5 vol%) as the sacrificial agent. The highly enhanced PHOP performance is attributed to the modulated surface active sites on the CN framework by K intercalation. The emerged Lewis acidic sites facilitate alcohol adsorption and the strengthened basic sites accelerate hydrogen abstraction, which synergistically promotes alcohol oxidation and H2O2 production. The results realize a high H2O2 production at a low dose of alcohols, which is promising to develop a process to utilize low concentrations of waste alcohols or other organic pollutants in wastewater as electron donors. Simultaneously, this new discovery is benefit for better understanding of the synergistic active sites in PHOP and favors the design of novel CN materials with desirable performance in energy conversion and environmental applications."
