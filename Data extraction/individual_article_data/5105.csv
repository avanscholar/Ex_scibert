0,Introduction,"In recent years, efforts have been made to find eco-friendly and renewable alternatives for fuel due to the depletion of fossil resources and increases in the crude oil price. Biodiesel is an eco‐friendly and a sustainable biofuel with fossil fuel–like properties. Therefore, it has been accepted as an alternative to conventional diesel and is now used in blends with petrodiesel by several countries [1]. Between 2000 and 2017, biofuel production increased 10-fold from 16 billion to 143 billion liters [2]. By 2016, the worldwide biodiesel production was over 32.6 million tons. Moreover, the global biofuel market is estimated to grow at an annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2017 to 2024, and the worldwide capacity of biodiesel production is anticipated to reach 12 billion gallons by 2020 [3,4]. Brazil, the USA, Malaysia, Argentina, Netherlands, Spain, Philippines, Belgium, Indonesia, and Germany are among the 10 countries that fulfill more than 80% of the global biodiesel demand [5,6]. The second and third generation of biodiesel is produced from non-edible crops (vegetable and algal oil) and oil waste (waste animal oil and WCO), respectively. Also, the feasibility of using a wide range of feedstocks, process optimization, and cost reduction for biodiesel production has been challenging for over 20 years. This has led to the search for low-cost alternatives, such as non-edible resources and animal-based feedstocks [7]. Hence, the use of oil waste sources (WCO and animal fats) is increasing for industrial-scale biodiesel production, which makes the entire production process more sustainable [8]. As reported by Atabani et al. [9], more than 350 oil-bearing crops identified worldwide as potential sources for biodiesel production. Various feedstocks, such as vegetable oil, waste animal fats, WCO, and algal oil, has been evaluated for biodiesel production [10]. Additionally, biodiesel can be produced from terrestrial plants that have limited availability. The food-based crops such as vegetable oils are presumed to be the dominant source for biodiesel production. Vegetable oils are categorized into edible oils (e.g. canola oil and sunflower oil) and non-edible oils (e.g. Jatropha and Karanja oil). The Palm, soybean and rapeseed oil are the most important feedstock sources for biodiesel production. In 2017, the global biodiesel production was attributed to palm oil (31%), soybean oil (27%), rapeseed oil (20%), which followed by WCO (10%), waste animal fats (7%) and other (5%) [11]. As reported by Gui et al. [12], the potential of different edible, non-edible and waste for biodiesel production since many years ago have been investigated. Therefore, the main sources for biodiesel production are dividing into two different categories (edible and non-edible) as shown in Fig. 1 . Besides, the advantages and disadvantages of non-edible oils are shown in Table 1 . The biodiesel production from animal fats and WCO is increasing in the USA and Europe [21]. As reported by Atabani et al. [22], the cost of produced biodiesel from edible oil is higher than that of petroleum fuels. According to Gebremariam and Marchetti [23], the cost of biodiesel production can be decreased by reducing capital investment, increasing biodiesel yield by improving technology, and reducing the cost of raw materials. To achieve this goal, the economic aspects of biodiesel production should be evaluated by finding alternatives to available technologies, catalyst, and feedstock."
1,Biodiesel production methods,"In general, there are four common methods for biodiesel production as follows: 1. Blending or dilution is defined as the simplest and oldest used method with a blend of preheated vegetable/animal oils and petrodiesel in the ratio of 10–40% (w/w) [24]. 2. Microemulsification is solubilization of vegetable or animal oils in an alcoholic solvent and surfactants. It is work based on the formation of micro-emulsions by using various alcoholic solvents with colloidal microstructures to reach the required viscosity for commercially diesel production [25]. 3. Pyrolysis or thermal cracking is preheating of vegetable or animal oils at high temperatures ranging from 300 to 1300 °C in the absence or presence of a catalyst. During this method, a substantial change occurs in the chemical structure of the compound like breaking down of chemical bonds to small molecules [26]. 4. Transesterification considered as the reaction of vegetable or animal oils with alcohol (ethanol or methanol) in the presence of an acidic or alkaline catalyst [27] The transesterification is the most convenient process due to its low cost and simplicity while the selection of feedstock is critical as it accounts about 70% of the total production cost from edible and non-edible sources [28]. Several reviews have been recently published regarding biodiesel production from different sources such as palm oil [29], waste chicken fat [30], used cooking oil [31], microalgae [32], municipal waste [33], different sources [4], waste frying oil [34] and waste animal fat [35,36]. In addition, other reviews regarding the use of waste materials as potential catalysts [37], oil extraction and conversion technologies [26], fuel quality of biodiesel blends [38], economic aspects [23], compositions, properties, and standards of biodiesel [39] and environmental impacts of diesel/biodiesel additives [40] have also been published. Therefore, this review focuses on the transesterification of non-edible sources, such as WCO, algal oil, non-edible vegetable oil, and waste animal fat for biodiesel production. In addition, the economic aspects, fuel properties and by-product application were evaluated, and future suggestions have been provided."
2,Biodiesel production by transesterification,"2.1 Biodiesel production by transesterification First-generation biodiesel is produced by transesterification of triglycerides (TGs) using vegetable oils, while second-generation biodiesel is produced using feedstocks, such as lignocellulose and non-edible TGs [27]. The production process involves catalytic hydroprocessing of TGs and thermal conversion of lignocellulose using pyrolysis and gasification [41]. The transesterification process involves the chemical conversion of different types of oils into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). In the presence of a catalyst, the oil is reacted with short-chain alcohol. The schematic diagram of biodiesel production via transesterification process is shown in Fig. 2 . Biodiesel or mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids, such as FAME, are produced by a transesterification reaction with TGs and alcohol [42,43]. The major FFA presented in biodiesel production are shown in Table 2 . In this process, alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol (acyl acceptor), can be catalyzed by the alkoxy group of an ester to convert TGs to FAME and glycerol. Then, a lipid reacts with a mono-alcohol in the presence of alkaline, acidic, or enzymatic catalysts to produce FAME and glycerol [45]. Fig. 3 shows the chemical reaction of the transesterification process for biodiesel production. Several factors, such as catalyst type, reactor type, raw material characteristics, agitation speed, temperature, reaction time, solvent type, and solvent-to-oil ratio, have been shown to be important to obtain the optimum yield of biodiesel via the transesterification process [47–50]. As reported by Encinar et al. [51], co-solvent (both polar and non-polar) could enhance the transesterification reaction and lead to an increase in biodiesel yield. According to Baskar and Aiswarya [43], the type of catalyst and feedstock are the most important parameters for effective biodiesel production as these factors can influence the cost of biodiesel production. Catalysts are divided into two main categories 1) homogeneous catalysts, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) and (2) heterogeneous catalysts (like solid acid/base, polymer, and zeolites) [52]. Table 3 shows the detail of different types of catalysts. In homogeneous transesterification, alkaline catalysts are mostly preferred due to their better conversion efficiency than acidic catalysts [57–59]. Heterogeneous transesterification involves the use of solid catalysts as an effective replacement for homogenous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts are derived from renewable materials such as biomass after calcination under high temperatures in the range of 500–900 °C [60]. Solid heterogeneous catalysts like heteropoly acids are capable to overcome the deficiencies of homogenous catalysts [61,54,62]. FAME content of biodiesel produced through heterogeneous catalysis yielded <96.5%; hence, the process needs to be modified to enhance the reaction [63]. Recently, enzymatic transesterification has gained interest as a novel production and purification method for biodiesel production in terms of obtaining higher conversion rate and reusability, high-value products, and higher yield than the conventional chemical-catalyzed transesterification process [64,65]. This process involves enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis and esterification reactions to produce fatty acid alkyl esters from TGs [66]. Several microorganisms, including Pseudomonas ntarcti (PS30), Mucor miehei (Lipozyme IM60), Geotrichum candidum, and Candida Antarctica (SP435) have been used for biodiesel production. The three major components of the enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel production process are oil, lipase, and acyl acceptor. Lipase is a hydrolase enzyme that converts TGs to fatty acids and glycerol by hydrolysis [67]. Lipase possesses unique characteristics exhibits a high conversion rate and acts as the main catalyst for enzymatic transesterification [64]. Besides, the enzymatic method enables the use of different sources with a high content of FFAs to produce biodiesel more economically [65]. It should be noted that some types of lipase such as Novozym 435 and R. oryzae are effective catalysts for biodiesel production once they were immobilized [68]. Besides, the high potential of reusability of immobilized lipases Novozym 435 (only 16% loss after 10 cycles) was obtained in the transesterification of waste fish oil to produce biodiesel [69]."
3,Non-edible sources for biodiesel production,"Based on the surveyed literature, WCO, waste animal oil, non-edible vegetable oil, and algae were considered as an alternative for edible sources, which are explained in details in the following sections."
4,Waste cooking oil,"3.1 Waste cooking oil WCO is widely used to produce biodiesel due to its low cost and high availability [70,71]. WCO is composed of TGs or glycerides that might contain animal fat or vegetable oil. Font de Mora et al. [72] have categorized WCO into yellow and brown grease which is obtained from palm, canola, corn, sunflower, and other oils that are used in food preparation. WCO can also be classified based on the source from where it is collected, such as restaurants, fast food outlets, and households. Alkali- and acid-based catalysts can be used to produce biodiesel from WCO [73,74]. Researchers have recently focused on the optimization of biodiesel production from WCO based on effecting parameters and the use of new catalysts. For instance, Hamze et al. [75] evaluated the effects of catalyst loading, reaction temperature, and catalyst concentration to oil molar ratio on the yield of produced biodiesel from WCO. They obtained a maximum yield of biodiesel (99.38 wt%) under optimum conditions at 1.4 wt% of the catalyst loading, 65 °C reaction temperature, and 7.5:1 of catalyst concentration to oil molar ratio while the most important parameter was catalyst concentration. In a study by Gurunathan and Ravi [76], biodiesel production from WCO was evaluated using a heterogeneous catalyst like calcinated copper doped zinc oxide nanocomposite. The maximum biodiesel yield was 97.71% (w/w) under optimum conditions at 12% (w/w) of the nanocatalyst concentration, oil to methanol ratio of 1:8 (v:v), 55 °C reaction temperature, and 50 min reaction time. Besides, biomass or animal waste can be used as a catalyst to reduce the cost of the catalyst and disposal problems of biomass waste generated from agricultural and human activities [77]. In this regard, Maneerung et al. [78] used calcined chicken manure as a CaO catalyst with high catalytic activity to produce biodiesel through the transesterification of WCO. The FAME yield was 90% under optimum conditions at 7.5 wt% of the catalyst, methanol to oil molar ratio of 1:15, and 65 °C reaction temperature. Recently, Jung et al. [79] used chicken manure biochar as a catalyst for transesterification of WCO to FAME. They obtained (95%) FAME yield at the reaction temperature of 350 °C. In another study by Farooq et al. [80], calcinated waste chicken bones showed good catalytic activity in the transesterification of WCO and yielded 89.33% biodiesel. Table 4 shows recent findings on biodiesel production from WCO as a non-edible source."
5,Algal oil,"3.2 Algal oil Micro- and macro-algae are grown in both artificial and natural environments, as they need light, carbon dioxide, and other inorganic nutrients to grow [93]. An improvement in algal biomass production has been achieved by open and closed system cultivation of microalgae in wastewater treatment [94]. After harvesting, algae can be used as a non-edible source for biodiesel production [95]. Their lipid content (40–80% in dry weight) is 15–300 times higher than other traditional crops [96,97]. In overall, The most significant advantages of producing biodiesel from microalgae than the other plants are higher productivity, less land usage, and high TGs accumulation up to 20–50% [98]. Fig. 4 shows the steps of biodiesel production from algae. The transesterification process is the predominant method to commercially produce biodiesel from algae, and this biodiesel can be blended with petroleum diesel [99]. Moreover, algal biodiesel production via transesterification method is more cost-effective than biodiesel produced from vegetable oils and animal fats [100]. It is well documented that a wide range of microalgae species such as Chlorella minutissima, Chlorella vulgaris have been used for biodiesel production [101–103]. In addition, transesterification can reduce the viscosity of FAME for biodiesel production from algae [104]. Fig. 5 illustrates the steps of transesterification of microalgae for biodiesel production which are cultivation, harvesting, lipid extraction, and transesterification. [105]. Pretreatment is one of the crucial steps to accelerate the process of lipid extraction, which improves the lipid yield from algae. The pretreatment methods include enzymatic hydrolysis, ultra-sonication, high-pressure homogenization, microwaves, bead-beating, and chemical methods such as microwave [106]. The pretreatment step involves cell disruption, drying, particle size reduction, followed by lipid extraction by different methods and removal of cellular debris and solvents. Drying step is performed to reduce the water content of algae, which can be done by different methods such as solar, or steam [107]. The most important step in biodiesel production from algae is the lipid extraction process. Wang et al. [108] studied the effects of the ratio of liquid to solid, mixed acid dosage, and reaction temperature on the lipid extraction. The results showed the optimum condition at a formic acid dose of 5.57 g/g weight of dried algae, HCl dose of 0.1 g/g, liquid to solid ratio of 10:1, and reaction temperature of 100 °C. The total lipid yield was 45.6% while FAME yield of Chlorella protothecoides was 85.8%. Table 5 shows recent findings on biodiesel production from different species of microalgae."
6,Vegetable oil,"3.3 Vegetable oil The different types of edible vegetable and non-edible vegetable oils are used for biodiesel production in various countries. The United States exports edible oil that uses soybeans for biodiesel production, whereas the European countries use rapeseed oil as the raw material for biodiesel production. Tropical countries, such as Malaysia, use palm oil or coconut oil, while India uses non-edible vegetable oils, such as Jatropha, Simarouba, and Karanja [113–115]. In Australia, papaya seed oil and stone fruit kernel oil are the popular non-edible vegetable oils for biodiesel production [59]. Due to the economic issues and pressure on food security, the use of non-edible oils is preferred over edible vegetable oils [116]. Jatropha as a non-edible vegetable oil has been considered as a commercially viable alternative to edible oil for biodiesel production because of its physicochemical characteristics [117,118]. Its seed has approximately 35% oil content, while the extracted oil contains 24.6% crude protein and 47.2% crude lipids [119]. Different methods such as traditional methods (use of the simple machine by hand) and more advanced methods such as oil presses (a simple traditional press method with 1-liter biodiesel yield from each 4 kg of the seed) have been used for the extraction of Jatropha oil [120,121]. Salar-García et al. [122] have used Jatropha oil to produce biodiesel and achieved the maximum yield of FAME (99.5 mol%) and conversion of (100 wt%) TGs at 325 °C at a reaction time of 90 min. Jatropha curcas is a member of the Euphorbiaceous family and is found in Central and South America, South-East Asia, India, and Africa [123–125]. Recently, Kamel et al, [126] obtained 94% biodiesel production yield using Jatropha curcas in transesterification process at the condition as 1 wt% catalyst loading, 60 min reaction time and 6:1 methanol to oil molar ratio at 60 °C. At the same condition, WCO had an 81% biodiesel production yield which shows the efficiency of non-edible vegetable oil as a suitable source. Another potential non-edible source for biodiesel production is macaw oil (Acrocomia aculeata) with a high productive potential (4–6 ton oil/ha) which is abundant and native of tropical America especially Brazil [14]. By using this plant and heterogeneous catalysts (γ-alumina with 5 cycles reusability), 52.49 wt% of FAME with 85.21 wt% of conversion efficiency obtained as reported by dos Santos Ribeiro et al. [127]. In another study, 48.96% of FAME obtained in the condition (1):20 oil to molar ratio at 300 °C, with 2% (m/m) of catalyst concentration and 60 min of reaction resulted in 82.46% of conversion efficiency to biodiesel using Acrocomia aculeate [128]. Karanja possesses the potential to be used as a promising non-edible vegetable oil source for biodiesel production. These trees can grow in various places, such as beside roads, canals, and boundaries of agricultural lands. Its seeds contain 27–39% oil and yields 97% biodiesel via the transesterification process at a reaction temperature of 65 °C using 1 wt% KOH at methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 in a reaction time of 2 h [129]. Calophyllum inophyllum is another potential vegetable oil that can be used for biodiesel production. The transesterification of Calophyllum inophyllum by the catalytic method produces high yield biodiesel (95%), making it an economical feedstock [130]. Table 6 shows recent studies on biodiesel production from different non-edible vegetable oils."
7,Waste animal oil,"3.4 Waste animal oil The use of animal fat/oil waste as a cost-effective feedstock for biodiesel production has received considerable attention while the research in this field still is in the early stages of development [140]. Waste animal fats usually originate from animal slaughterhouses or factories, processing of animal mortalities, rendering processes, and large food processing [141]. Like WCO and vegetable oil, transesterification is the most used method for biodiesel production from animal fats and can be achieved using homogeneous, heterogeneous, and enzymatic catalysts, or without using any catalyst [36]. Based on the literature, the different types of animal waste were used as feedstocks for biodiesel production such as chicken fat, grease, tallow (mutton tallow from sheep and beef tallow from domestic cattle), and pork lard (rendered pork fat) [142]. Among the most commonly used animal fat waste, pork lard and tallow consist of more than 40% saturated fatty acids [143]. Adewale et al. [144] have used waste lard for biodiesel production. Under optimum conditions of 1:4 oil to methanol molar ratio and 6% catalyst concentration, the biodiesel yield was 96.8%. Later, Tavares et al. [145] reported that the percentage of enzyme loading and reaction time reduced significantly using ultrasound, in comparison to the conventional method. In Brazil, beef tallow considered as the second leading raw material after soybean oil for biodiesel production [146]. Moreover, the tallow-derived biodiesel produces between 17% and 35% impact of the low-sulfur diesel, which can be considered as an environmental advantage of using mutton tallow for biodiesel production [147]. Chavarria‐Hernandez et al. [148] found that the FFA from beef cattle and poultry can be used as a potential low-cost source for biodiesel production in Mexico. Recently, insects such as black soldier fly larvae, have been used as a potential source for biodiesel production due to their high-fat content, low cost, and high reproduction rates [149,150]. Considering that animal fat can serve as a viable raw material for biodiesel production and is available in international markets at a low price, they can be used to make biodiesel competitive with petro-diesel [151,152]. As reported by Sander et al. [153], biodiesel produced from all sources of animal fats fulfilled the standard specifications for biodiesel fuel in terms of free glycerine content. As suggested by Bolonio et al. [154], biodiesel from animal fat can be produced through a two-step process: 1) hydrolysis of raw animal fats into free fatty acids 2) reaction of free fatty acids with ethanol. Suwannapa and Tippayawong [155] used a two-step process for biodiesel production from beef tallow. The optimum conditions were as microwave irradiation time of 30 min, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:12, H2SO4 loading at 1.35% in the first step, followed by microwave irradiation time of 25 min, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:9, and NaOH loading at 0.62%, which resulted in 99% yield of biodiesel. Punsuvon et al. [156] used two-step biodiesel production by acid and alkali esterifications and obtained 86.10% FAME yield under optimum conditions at a reaction temperature of 60 °C using 2.40% sulfuric acid at methanol to an animal fat molar ratio of 6:1 in a reaction time of 1.5 h. Waste chicken fat (WCF) has been used in the one-step transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. Under optimum conditions at methanol to FFA molar ratio of 30:1, solid catalyst amount of 25%, reaction temperature of 90 °C, and reaction time of 3 h, the biodiesel yield was 93.7% [157]. In a recent study by Abid et al. [158], a 97.5% yield was obtained in a two-step extraction of lipids from chicken’s skin under optimum conditions at a reaction temperature of 65 °C, reaction time of 30 min, at a 1:3 M ratio of methanol to oil, and 1% H2SO4. Waste fish oil is another potential non-edible source for biodiesel production. For instance, a biodiesel yield (96%) was obtained from transesterification of Silurus triostegus Heckel fish oil under the optimized condition of the (6:1 methanol to oil, KOH 0.50% w/w, at 32 °C for 60 min) [159]. Interestingly, the mixture of two non-edible sources (castor and waste fish oil) was used for biodiesel production [160]. They obtained biodiesel with a yield of 95.20% in an optimum condition of 8:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 0.50 wt% KOH, 30 min of reaction at 32 °C while 50:50% blend of two sources were used. Table 7 shows recent findings on biodiesel production from waste animal oil."
8,Economic aspects,"Some parameters such as the cost of feedstock and the selling price of produced biodiesel and their by-products (glycerol) have a direct effect on the economic feasibility of biodiesel production. As reported by Atabani et al. [9], the average cost of producing biodiesel and diesel fuel is $0.50 and $0.35 per liter, respectively. The biodiesel production price can be calculated using the Eq. (1): (1) Biodiesel p r o d u c t i o n p r i c e = o p e r a t i n g c o s t s ( $ / y e a r ) - b y p r o d u c t c r e d i t ( $ / y e a r ) p r o d u c t y e a r ( k g / y e a r ) The operating costs include direct manufacturing cost (raw material, labor and utilities), fixed charges (tax) and general costs such as research, development and finance [167]. The analysis of the capital cost process revealed that biodiesel production using vegetable oil through the alkali-catalyzed process had a lowest fixed capital cost, while CaO-catalyzed transesterification of WCO had a lower total manufacturing cost [168]. Gaeta-Bernardi and Parente [169] assumed a total capacity of biodiesel production from algal oil at 50 million gallons per year, using economic feasibility analysis. In China, the predicted cost of biodiesel production from algal oil from 2019 to 2022 is 2.29 USD/kg, which is significantly higher than commercial diesel (1.08 USD/kg). This comparison verifies the lack of economic feasibility, which can be attributed to operating days per year, product benefits, and microalgae productivity [170]. The selection of suitable algae species with maximum lipid productivity would be a good option to develop an economical process for biodiesel production [107]. However, several parameters such as energy consumption cost, the extraction process, the cost of distillation associated with the separation of lipids, and the drying biomass cost are influencing the total cost of biodiesel production from algae biomass. It should be noted that the cost of biodiesel production from algae can be reduced by using wet concentrated algal biomass for oil extraction to avoid further drying [171]. Salam et al. [172] have suggested that a suitable and effective pretreatment method can reduce the cost of biodiesel production from algae. Hence, cell wall disruption of algae is necessary to enhance lipid productivity, which requires an extra cost for solvents. Fig. 6 shows the schematic diagram of influencing parameters in the cost of biodiesel production. The feedstock type is one of the most important parameters in biodiesel production which covers about 80% total production cost [173,174]. For example, the price of WCO is 2.5–3.5 times less than vegetable oils which can reduce the total biodiesel manufacturing cost [175]. Besides, the other parameters such as the molar ratio of oil/alcohol and catalyst percentage directly have an effect on the process cost [176]. Additionally, the selection of a proper catalyst can influence the total production cost. Low-cost materials, such as eggshell, biochar from coconut shells, kraft lignin, and scallop waste shells, can be used as catalysts. Thus, the biomass waste-derived as a heterogeneous catalyst is a suitable option for reducing the cost of biodiesel production [177]. For example, biodiesel with a yield of 93% achieved using a heterogeneous alkaline catalyst derived from low-cost chicken eggshell waste from soybean oil. Besides, the total cost of transesterification was reduced with the use of this catalyst [178]. In the case of algal biodiesel, harvesting is the most costly process with 20%–30% of the total production cost [179]. Another major cost-effective parameter is the conversion process by 10% in large facilities, and 25–40% in small size facilities [180]. In the last decade, several studies evaluated the cost of biodiesel production from different sources. For example, the estimated process cost of biodiesel from palm oil was 0.82 USD/per liter while the highest cost referred to feedstock cost by 0.73 USD. Moreover, the lowest production cost using tallow fat was 0.6 USD/liter including the feedstock cost of 0.4 USD/liter [181]. In 2011, the estimated cost of biodiesel production from palm oil was 0.7 USD/liter [173]. According to the cost analysis by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the cost of algal biodiesel was in the range of $0.53–0.85/L. In addition, the final costs of biodiesel were in the range of $0.42–0.97/L as calculated by different sectors such as government databases, sellers and other sources [182]. Therefore, the trend shows that there is no much difference between the price of biodiesel production since the last decade. The high cost of labor for harvesting is an important issue that should be considered for biodiesel production from non-edible vegetable in countries such as Malaysia and Brazil. For instance, in Tanzania, the low labor cost for harvesting Jatropha is due to manual harvesting and traditional methods [183]. The production cost of biodiesel from seed oils depends on parameters such as raw material and by-product price, operation cost, plant capacity, and location. For instance, the required costs to produce biodiesel from castor is about 9% lower than produce diesel including the tax rate. Consequently, it considers as a low-cost vegetable for biodiesel production [167]. As recently reported by Joshi et al. [184], the biodiesel production cost can be reduced by 60–70% using WCO as raw material with the cost of 0.4 USD/per liter biodiesel. Table 8 shows the cost of biodiesel production from different non-edible sources."
9,Fuel properties of produced biodiesel from non-edible sources,"To ensure engine performance without any difficulties, biodiesel quality should meet worldwide standards because it is produced from different sources. A wide range of sources, such as edible and non-edible vegetable oils and waste animal fats, can be used as potential fuel for complete replacement of diesel in Compression Ignition (CI) engines [190]. The properties and qualities of biodiesel must be in accordance with the internationally recognized specification for biodiesel standard, which are American Standards for Testing Materials (ASTM 6751-3) and the European (EN 14214) Standards for biodiesel fuel. Usually, blend fuel improves acceleration at the same horsepower as diesel fuel while it is produced at a lower price [5]. In addition, to produce high-quality biodiesel fuel (based on ASTM and EN standards), the entire process including pretreatment, product separation, and purification should be optimized [140,191]. The petro-diesel properties are shown in Table 9 . It should be noted that the presence of FFA in the fuel blend influenced the biodiesel quality and fuel properties [192]. According to Niculescu et al. [41], the most important physicochemical properties of biodiesel include cetane number, flash point, viscosity, cloud point, and iodine value of biodiesel, are affected by the compositional profile of FAME. The viscosity of the fuel is an important feature which plays a significant role in the mixture formation fuel spray, and the combustion process. Lower viscosity is preferable as the high viscosity of the fuel prevents the injection process and results in inadequate fuel atomization [193]. Another important feature for fuel is the flashpoint which the fuel ignites if exposed to the flame. A minimum flash point for diesel fuel is 130 °C based on ASTM D93 that is typically much higher than for petrodiesel that is in the range of 130–170 °C according to ASTM D6751 [194]. Cloud point is implying on the temperature when the biodiesel starts forming cloudy suspensions and visible crystals. Cetane number is introduced as combustion speed of diesel fuel and needed compression for ignition as the higher cetane number resulted in reducing ignition delay and improving performance of engine [195]. As reviewed recently by Suresh et al., [38], different types of non-edible oils, such as WCO and vegetable oils (Jatropha curcas, Madhuca indica, and Pongamia pinnata), have been used in blending or complete substitution for standard diesel fuel. However, the blend of vegetable oil (sunflower) with petroleum fuel exhibits low viscosity and is more suitable for engine performance [196]. Besides, the produced biodiesel-fuel from palm oil also was according to the ASTM and EN 14214 standards [133]. Jatropha oil is highly viscous and therefore unsuitable for use as an engine fuel. Therefore, to reduce the viscosity and make the blend suitable for engine application, different methods including ultrasonically assisted methanol transesterification, preheating, blending, and supercritical methanol transesterification have been used [197]. Keera et al. [134] have evaluated the performance of castor oil to petroleum diesel. Based on their results, the blend B5 (biodiesel, 5%, and petrodiesel, 95%) increased the cetane number from 43.7 to 50.7, which is close to the cetane number of petrodiesel 51. Animal fats, such as fish oil and chicken fat are suitable replacements for biodiesel blends as they are easily available and the properties of produced fuel would meet the ASTM D 6751 biodiesel standards [30]. As reported by Behçet et al. [198], biodiesel produced by the transesterification using a 20% blend of fish oil (FOB) and WCF exhibited low viscosity and density. Therefore, the characteristics of FOB20 and CFB20 blend fuels were meet the biodiesel standards ASTM and EN. Table 10 shows the physicochemical fuel properties of different non-edible sources based on diesel standards. It can be concluded that produced biodiesel from different non-edible sources was met the physicochemical properties of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards and are comparable with diesel fuel properties."
10,By-product applications,"The biodiesel production would be economically affordable by the conversion of by-products to value-added products [206]. Crude glycerol is the main by-product of biodiesel production since the large amounts (8% to 10%) can be produced in the transesterification process. As reported by Rastegari et al. [207], the global inventory of glycerol is predicted to reach approximately 41.9 billion liters by 2020. Oil cake/meal (solid residues obtained after oil extraction from the seeds), salt and methanol are other types of by-products, which gained after the washing crude methyl esters. According to Monteiro et al. [208], the market price for crude glycerol (80% purity) and pure glycerol is between 0.09 and 0.20 and 0.60 and 0.91 USD/kg, respectively. The limited usage of crude glycerol from the biodiesel industry is due to its composition, which includes, heavy metals, residual methanol, spent catalysts and free fatty acids. Its disposal is also difficult as the methanol is a hazardous waste [209,210]. Co-gasification of glycerol and other feedstock is a good alternative for glycerol disposal and increases the profitability of biodiesel production [211]. It should be considered that use of homogeneous catalysts for glycerol valorization to Glycerol Carbonate (GC) poses difficulty in its disposal besides creating other problems such as increasing the process cost, and non-reusability of the leftover [212]. Therefore, the use of heterogeneous catalysts is an appropriate alternative to obtain a better quality of glycerol by catalytic conversion to energy and value-added chemicals [213]. Another solution for the disposal of glycerol can be the co-valorization of crude glycerol with renewable resources through pyrolysis and gasification processes. Then, the extracted oil can be used for biodiesel production while the remaining residual biomass for power generation [214]. Monteiro et al. [208] have recently reviewed the different applications of crude glycerol derived from biodiesel. Crude glycerol can be used as a feedstock for the production of biopolymers, such as 1,3-propanediol, lactic acid (bi-functional molecule for industrial applications), 1,3-dihydroxyacetone (important precursor in the synthesis of fine chemicals), ethanol, hydrogen as a fuel additive and n-butanol production [215]. However, this process is not economically viable due to the presence of impurities and the refining costs, both of which have a negative impact on biodiesel production [211]. Also, pure glycerol can be used as value-added products in different industries such as cosmetics (as raw materials) food, textile, pharmaceuticals, medicine, fuel additives, and solvents. Utilizing this by-product makes biodiesel production more economically reasonable [213,216]. Consequently, the conversion of crude glycerol to other value-added products through biological routes with the aid of microbes is a viable alternative process [217]. Cornejo et al. [206] found under mild conditions, the glycerol valorization via transformation in oxygenated fuel additives is viable due to its high conversion. However, to ensure their behavior in different fuel blends, the oxygenated fuel additives needs to be tested. In addition, glycerol can be converted to (GC) through valorization. GC has been used in a wide range of applications, such as solvent, surfactants, detergents, and production of polymers. In this regard, Shikhaliyev et al. [218] have used oversupplied glycerol to synthesize GC via transesterification with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) at 650 °C to produce biochar. They used this biochar under optimized conditions of 2 wt% catalyst dosage at 85 °C, and 2 DMC/glycerol molar ratio which resulted in 99.5% GC yield. Some researchers try to produce biodiesel with minimum glycerol production. Farobie and Matsumura [219] have used supercritical methyl acetate and DMC for biodiesel production without producing glycerol as a byproduct. However, this method requires an excessive amount of reactants for the complete conversion of oil to biodiesel. Besides, an integration process of reactant recovery is needed to make the process more efficient. To minimize the production of glycerol, Tian et al. [220] used a novel process by introducing DMC into lipase-mediated methanolysis. In this process, DMC reacted with glycerol and resulted in the release of methanol. This method produced a high biodiesel yield of 95.3% under optimized conditions with only 0.049% glycerol concentration."
11,Future prospects based on recent studies,"The most important parameters for effective biodiesel production are the type of catalyst and feedstock. In fact, raw material selection and catalyst type play significant roles in the economic viability of biodiesel production. The challenges for feedstock selection include storage and transport, oil extraction and conversion process, fuel characterization and property analysis, optimization and production processes [59]. Due to several limitations of traditional homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production, the potential of using new catalysts with a higher yield and lower cost needs to be investigated. Ullah et al. [221] introduced an ionic liquid (IL) as a highly recyclable catalyst that can be easily used by different feedstocks via transesterification. The most significant advantage of ILs is their easy separation from the reaction mixture by decantation and removal from the biodiesel product. The use of microwave heating can accelerate the conversion of animal waste to biodiesel on a large scale. This process can reduce the reaction time for FFA reduction and increase FAME yields [222]. Based on the recent study by Tabatabaei et al. [223], the use of advanced transesterification reactors for biodiesel production have received attentions by the researchers due to the need for reducing the energy and water consumption, waste streams, capital cost, required space, and environmental effects with a focus in biodiesel quality and conversion efficiency. As recent research studies have focused on the novel production technologies for biodiesel production, enzymatic transesterification (immobilized lipase-mediated transesterification) can provide advantages regarding the conversion, yield, and reusability of various feedstocks for biodiesel production [224]. Akubude et al. [225] demonstrated that biodiesel production via nano-catalyzed transesterification as a promising strategy over the use of conventional catalysts. Nano-catalysts play an important role in product quality improvement and obtaining optimal operating conditions for biodiesel production. They possess high specific surface area, high resistance to saponification, high catalytic activity, and good rigidity. According to Sivaramakrishnan and Incharoensakdi [226], ultrasound lipid extraction is another efficient method in transesterification of algae for biodiesel production, which increases the reaction rate and subsequently results in a reduction of total production cost. Tan et al. [227] have revealed that the application of ultrasound-assisted transesterification improves the biodiesel yield to 28% and reduces the required amount of the catalyst (20%−25%), reaction time (25%−95.8%), alcohol to oil ratio (16.67%−25%) and reaction temperature and energy consumption (33%−50%). The use of non-edible oils as feedstocks to produce biodiesel at high yields, new applications for glycerol in terms of economic and environmental aspects, and technological improvement leading to the reduction of production cost for the development of new processes and use of low-cost heterogeneous catalysts are some of the advantages [228]. Although the presence of impurities such as high concentrations of glycerol and glycerides has significant effects on the quality of biodiesel, the modification of operating conditions and/or use of a solvent is the effective approach to reduce the effect of high concentrations of glycerol and glycerides [153]. For sustainable biodiesel production from microalgae, the key factors are microalgae cultivation, harvesting, cell disruption, lipid accumulation, and lipid extraction method. Hence, the major challenges and future prospects of microalgae biodiesel production are the cultivation conditions for biomass growth, improvement in lipid productivity, and the available harvesting and lipid extraction technologies [229]. As suggested by Chen et al. [188], biodiesel production from microalgae in rural areas could reduce the cost due to land utilization. Besides, the government can reduce the cost and energy consumption in algal biodiesel production by developing new and modern technologies."
12,Conclusion,"In this review, we focused on the recent findings on biodiesel production from non-edible sources and the economic aspects, properties of produced fuel and the application of glycerol as the main by-product. The following points can be concluded from this review: • WCO, a non-edible source, produced high yields of biodiesel (greater than90%) using different heterogeneous catalysts, whereas reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading had minimal effect on the production yield. • The algal biodiesel production yield is directly related to the pretreatment type, lipid extraction method, and catalyst type. • Jatropha, castor, and Karanja were the most used non-edible vegetable oils that yielded over 80% biodiesel and the reaction temperature and alcohol type were the important factors. • Alkaline-catalysis resulted in high biodiesel yields from animal oils. The high reaction temperature and less reaction time improve biodiesel production using this process. • The algal biodiesel had the highest production cost due to the cost of harvesting, pretreatment, and process. In contrast, the non-edible vegetable had the lowest biodiesel production cost because of the high availability and easier conversion process. • The selection of suitable feedstock and catalyst type can reduce the cost of biodiesel production from non-edible sources. In this regard, the reusability of the catalyst with no effect on the environment is recommended. • The produced biodiesel from non-edible sources had almost similar fuel properties with ASTM 6751 and EN 14214 standards. However, the use of additional pretreatment and product separation is necessary for the production of high-quality biodiesel fuel which makes it suitable for engine performance. • Producing low-cost biodiesel using by-product requires formulating novel strategies."
