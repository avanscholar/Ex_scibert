0,Introduction,"Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis, which produces hydrocarbons (HCs) from syngas (a mixture of CO and H2), has been long studied and has received renewed attention in recent years for environmental reasons, because the hydrocarbon products can be regarded as clean fuels, i.e., as alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuels. Several transition metals such as Ru, Ni, Mo, Fe, and Co have been studied as catalysts for FT synthesis [1]. Among these catalysts, Co catalysts appear to be one of the most promising candidates for FT synthesis owing to the fact that Co is economically feasible, shows high selectivity toward saturated linear paraffin, exhibits low water-gas shift activity, and has a long catalytic life-time [1]. However, the synthesis of alcohols under FT conditions is also an attractive research target, because alcohols can also be used as fuels, fuel additives for octane or cetane enhancement, and as intermediates for high-value chemicals [2]. Alcohols are obtained as by-products in FT synthesis, although the amount is small. Several catalytic systems have been reported with the aim to synthesize alcohols under FT conditions [2,3]. Rhodium-based catalysts [4], Fe/C [5], Ru-based catalysts [6,7], Mo catalysts [8,9], and ZnO-based catalysts [10,11] have also been reported. Multicomponent catalysts containing Cu and Co catalysts [12–15] have also been studied: these catalysts exploit the characteristic features of Cu, which efficiently catalyzes methanol synthesis from syngas. Although some catalysts can produce alcohols with high selectivity, lower alcohols (C1–C4 alcohols) are typically obtained. Higher-molecular-weight alcohols are used as intermediates in the synthesis of plasticizers, detergents, and lubricants. Thus, the synthesis of higher alcohols from syngas is more beneficial than the synthesis of lower alcohols. Modified Co-based catalysts have been examined for higher alcohol synthesis under FT conditions, including Co nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed in ionic liquids [16], Co-Fe/SBA [17], Co/CoAl2O4 [18], Pt-Co/CeO2 [19], and La-doped Co/C [20] catalysts. Several reports on the effect of alkali metals for the production of higher alcohols using fixed-bed flow reactors have appeared in the literature [2,11,14,15]. The addition of alkali metals is believed to increase the rate of CO insertion and decreasing the rate of hydrogenation, which favors the production of oxygenated compounds [2]. However, generally, the addition of alkali metals also leads to a decrease in CO conversion. Lanthanum-doped Co/C catalysts have been reported to be selective for the production of C1–C18 linear alcohols [20]. Although 34wt% alcohol selectivity was obtained with 0.1wt% La doping, the distribution of higher alcohols (C6-C18) among total alcohols was only 14wt%, which means that the yield of higher alcohols in the total products is low. Thus, the production of appreciable amounts of higher alcohols under FT conditions is still a challenging research target. In this study, we have examined the effect of alkali metals for unsupported Co and Co/SiO2 on alcohol formation from syngas using a batch slurry-phase reactor. We found that Na-promoted Co catalysts efficiently produced higher alcohols in high yield. The size and chemical state of Co particles were characterized using X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements, and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD), which revealed that Na affected the size of Co NPs, the reducibility of Co species, and the basicity of the catalyst surface. The relationships between alcohol selectivities and the characteristic features of Na-modified Co catalysts are discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Reagent-grade Co(NO3)2·6H2O, CoO, and Co3O4 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Silica (Q-15) was purchased from Fuji Silysia Chemical. Decane, Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, and Cs2CO3 were purchased and used as received."
3,Instrumentation,"2.2 Instrumentation X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku MultiFlex at a scanning rate of 2°/min and a sampling angle interval of 0.02° in 2θ that ranged from 10 to 80°: the instrument was equipped with a high-intensity Cu Kα radiation source (λ =0.151478nm). The operating voltage and current were 40kV and 40mA, respectively. The phases of components were identified by matching diffraction patterns to JCPDS powder diffraction files. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed on a SHIMADZU ESCA-3400. The XPS spectra of Co3O4-w and Co3O4-Na were obtained as oxidized states. The samples adhered on carbon tapes were placed into the evacuated sample chamber (2.6–5.0×10−6 Pa). The XPS spectra were obtained using Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6eV) operated at 200W (10kV, 20mA). The pass energy was set to 75eV. The Na 1s and Co 2p spectra were collected with the energy step of 0.1eV step and the data acquisition time of 300ms/point. All the spectra were internally corrected on the basis of the C1s peak at 284.6eV. The Shirley function was used to correct the background of all spectra. After the corrections, the spectra were fitted using the XPSPEAK 4.1 software package. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) observations were performed at the research laboratory for high vacuum electron microscopy (HVEM) at Kyushu University using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) apparatus at an acceleration voltage of 200kV. The TEM samples were prepared by the solvent casting method on a Cu grid with a carbon support membrane in air. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were performed at BL14B2 beamline of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) [21,22] and at BL06 beamline of SAGA-LS (Saga, Japan) [23]. The XAFS samples were ground with boron nitride in an agate mortar and were compacted into pellets. Silica supported Co3O4 catalysts (Co/SiO2 and NaCo/SiO2) were reduced with H2 to obtain Co/SiO2-H2 and NaCo/SiO2-H2 as described in Section 2.3. For ex situ XAFS measurements, the Co/SiO2-H2 and NaCo/SiO2-H2 catalysts were compacted into pellets and sealed in plastic bags under N2 to measure the samples as the reduced states. Co K-edge (7715eV) XAFS spectra were measured using a Si(1-1-1) double crystal monochromator in transmission mode. Ionization chambers were used, and the Quick scan technique (QXAFS) was used in these measurements. The spectral analysis was performed using the XAFS analysis software, Athena [24]. The extraction of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillation from the spectra, normalization by edge-jump, and Fourier transformation were performed using the Athena software. Basic sites of the catalysts were evaluated on the basis of temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) profiles using a BEL Japan Inc., BEL-CAT CAT-66. Samples were pretreated at 400°C under a flow of 5vol% H2 in Ar (40mL/min) for 140min to reduce Co(II, III) to Co(0), then 5vol% CO2 in Ar was introduced at a flow rate of 40mL/min at 30°C for 1h. Unbound CO2 was removed under vacuum at 30°C for 30min. The CO2-TPD profiles were obtained by heating at a rate of 10°C/min in a flow of He (40mL/min). The desorbed CO2 was detected by Q-MASS. In the FT synthesis reactions, the CO conversion and the yields of CO2 and CH4 were measured by gas chromatography (GC) using a GL Sciences GC-3200 equipped with a TCD and a packed column (activated carbon 60/80, 2.2mm I.D.×1m). Gaseous products (C1–C5 HCs) were analyzed using a GL Sciences GC-4000 equipped with an InertCap Wax capillary column (0.25μm thickness, 0.25mm I.D.×30m). The liquid phase products were analyzed with an Agilent GC 6850 series II equipped with a FID and a J&W HP-1 column (0.25μm thickness, 0.32mm I.D.×30m) using 1-dodecene as an internal standard, which was added after the reactions. The product selectivity was calculated on the CO2-free base."
4,Catalyst preparation,"2.3 Catalyst preparation Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) was prepared using a neutralization method. In brief, an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.09M, 200mL) was rapidly added to an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (0.11M, 200mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3h. The precipitate was carefully washed with water by decantation to remove as much of the Na content as possible, and was subsequently filtered, dried in air at 100°C overnight, and then calcined in air at 400°C for 4h to obtain Co3O4-w. Another Co3O4 catalyst was prepared in a similar manner but without washing in order to prepare Co3O4, on which Na remained: this catalyst is abbreviated as Co3O4-Na. Cobalt oxide supported on SiO2 was prepared using an impregnation method. Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (1.65g, 5.7mmol) was dissolved in a small portion of water (5.4mL). To the aqueous solution was added SiO2 (3.0g), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2h. Water was removed under reduced pressure at 70°C. The solid was dried at 100°C overnight and calcined in air at 400°C for 3h to obtain 10wt% Co/SiO2. Alkali metal-modified Co/SiO2 was prepared using an impregnation method. For example, 10wt% Co/SiO2 was added to an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (7mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2h. Water was removed under reduced pressure at 70°C. The solid was dried in air at 100°C overnight and calcined in air at 400°C for 3h to obtain xNaCo/SiO2 (x=Na content (wt%)). Another preparation method for 7NaCo/SiO2 is as follows. To an aqueous solution (6.8mL) of Na2CO3 (120mg) was added SiO2 (3.0g) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2h. The solid was dried in air at 100°C overnight to give Na/SiO2. To an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1.65g, 5.7mmol) dissolved in water (5.4mL) was added Na/SiO2, and the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 1h. The solid was dried in air at 100°C overnight. The dried solid was added to an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (0.59M, 6.8mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2h. The solid was dried at 100°C overnight and calcined in air at 400°C for 3h to give 7NaCo/SiO2. For XAFS measurements, Co/SiO2 and 4NaCo/SiO2 were pretreated in a flow of H2 (20mL/min) at 120°C for 1h and then at 400°C for 3h to obtain Co/SiO2-H2 and 4NaCo/SiO2-H2, respectively."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests A batch slurry-phase reactor was used for FT synthesis. Catalysts (200mg for unsupported Co3O4 or 1g for Co/SiO2) were pretreated in a flow of H2 (20mL/min) at 120°C for 1h and then at 400°C for 3h. A batch slurry-phase reactor was charged with the pretreated catalysts and decane (14.6g) as a solvent. The reactor was purged with syngas (Ar/CO/H2 =6/47/47) and then charged with the syngas at a flow rate of 20mL/min until the pressure reached 6MPa (initial pressure). The mixture was mechanically stirred (1000rpm) and heated. The reaction was performed until the pressure decreased to 3MPa (final pressure). After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and analyzed using GC."
6,Results,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Unsupported Co3O4 was prepared via precipitation from Co(NO3)2·6H2O using Na2CO3 as a neutralizing agent. The precipitate was washed with water several times to remove as much Na as possible and was then calcined in air to obtain Co3O4, which is abbreviated as Co3O4-w. To examine the effect of the Na that remained on the catalyst surface, the precipitate was simply filtered without washing, followed by calcination in air to obtain non-washed Co3O4,which is abbreviated as Co3O4-Na. To examine the effect of alkali metals, Co/SiO2 and alkali metal-promoted Co/SiO2 (xMCo/SiO2, M=alkali metal, x=alkali metal content (wt%)) were prepared using an impregnation method. As shown in Fig. 1 , the XRD patterns for all of the Co3O4 and Co/SiO2 catalysts showed reflections at 19.0, 31.4, 36.9, 37.9, 45.0, 55.9, 59.4, and 65.4°, which were in agreement with the XRD patterns for Co3O4 (spinel structure, JCPDS No. 01-1152) [25]. A broad peak at approximately 21° was ascribed to amorphous SiO2. A new peak at 29° was observed in the pattern of 4NaCo/SiO2 (Fig. 1a). This peak was probably due to the partly formation of sodium silicates (Na2SiO3, JCPDS No. 01-0836), although it could not be fully characterized owing to the presence of the Co3O4 peaks. The size of the Co3O4 NPs was estimated on the basis of HAADF-STEM observations. The sizes of Co3O4-w and Co3O4-Na were both approximately 20nm (see Supporting Information, Fig. S1). In contrast, the size of Co NPs decreased as the amount of Na increased (Figs. 2 and S2). Specifically, the sizes of the Co3O4 NPs ranged from 50 to 100nm for Co/SiO2 (Fig. 2a) and approximately 30nm for 4NaCo/SiO2 (Fig. 2b). After the reduction of Co3O4 to Co(0) with H2 at 400°C, small Co NPs with a diameter of approximately 2nm were observed for Co/SiO2, which suggests that a re-dispersion of Co NPs occurred during the reduction (Fig. 2c). For 4NaCo/SiO2-H2, much smaller Co clusters were dispersed on SiO2 together with relatively large Co NPs (Fig. 2d). These results prove that the aggregation of Co NPs did not occur during the reduction with H2. To examine the presence of Na on the unsupported Co3O4 surface, XPS characterization was performed (Fig. 3 ). While Na was not detected for Co3O4-w (Fig. 3a), a Na 1s peak was observed for Co3O4-Na (Fig. 3b). It suggests that Na ions derived from Na2CO3 remained on the Co3O4 surface probably by the substitution with H+ of the surface hydroxy groups of Co3O4. For NaCo/SiO2, EDS analyses were performed to check the location of sodium, and the EDS mapping images of 1NaCo/SiO2 was shown in Fig. S3. Sodium did not exist only near the Co particles but also on catalyst surfaces including SiO2. This was in good agreement with the XRD results, which proved the formation of sodium silicate. To elucidate the chemical state of Co, XPS of Co 2p spectra were also obtained, because XPS can analyze the surface chemical state (Fig. 4 ). The Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of Co3O4-w appeared at 780.8 and 796.3eV, respectively (Fig. 4b), which were in accordance with the peaks observed for the Co3O4 reference sample (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of Co3O4-Na shifted toward higher binding energy to 782.5 and 797.7eV, respectively (Fig. 4c). According to previous reports related to the XPS peaks of CoO and Co3O4, higher binding energy shifts indicate that a greater amount of Co(II) species exists on the Co3O4-Na surface than that on the Co3O4-w surface [26,27]. Since the difference in binding energies of CoO and Co3O4 is small, an estimation of the Co(II)/Co(III) ratio could not be performed. Since XPS measurements were impossible for the Co/SiO2 catalysts owing to the charge-up, XAFS measurements were performed to elucidate the chemical state of the Co particles supported on SiO2. Fig. 5 shows the Co K-edge XANES spectra. White lines were observed at 7726eV and 7723eV for the reference Co3O4 sample (Fig. 5a) and for CoO (Fig. 5d), respectively. A shoulder peak was observed at 7720eV in the spectra of both Co3O4 and CoO, although the peak in the spectrum of CoO was more intense than that in the spectrum of Co3O4. In the spectrum of Co/SiO2, a white line was observed at 7726eV (Fig. 5c), and the peak shape presumably resembled that of Co3O4 (Fig. 5a). With respect to 4NaCo/SiO2, a white line was observed at 7726eV combined with a shoulder peak at 7720eV with an intensity greater than those of Co3O4 and Co/SiO2 (Fig. 5b). These results suggested that 4NaCo/SiO2 contained a greater amount of Co(II) species than did Co/SiO2. The existence of a greater amount of Co(II) was also observed in unsupported Co3O4 catalysts using XPS measurements (Fig. 4). For 4NaCo/SiO2, the amplitude of the EXAFS oscillations (Fig. S4) and the magnitude of RSF (Fig. S5) were lower than those of Co3O4 foil and Co/SiO2. Decreases in EXAFS oscillation and magnitudes of RSF are caused by an increase in the Debye-Waller factor, which accounts for a disorder in the crystal structure of Co3O4, and a decrease in the coordination numbers, i.e., the size of Co3O4. Because XRD patterns of Co/SiO2 and 4NaCo/SiO2 were almost similar, these changes in the EXAFS oscillations and RSFs can be attributed to a decrease in the size of the Co3O4 particles. This decreased size of the Co3O4 particles was also supported by HAADF-STEM observations. After Co/SiO2 was treated with H2 at 400°C, the shape of the XANES spectra of Co/SiO2-H2 (Fig. 5f) resembled that of the Co foil (Fig. 5g). Specifically, the intensity of the white line at 7723eV decreased, and the intensity of the pre-edge XANES peaks at 7710eV increased. However, the white line was still observed, which indicated the presence of unreduced Co(II) species and/or small Co particles. In the latter case, the shapes of XANES spectra have been reported to strongly depend on the size of metal nanoparticles [28]. On the basis of theoretical XANES spectra, the near edge structure apparently changed, and a white line was observed when the size of Co NPs decreased to less than 2nm [29]. The EXAFS oscillation of Co/SiO2-H2 resembles that of the Co foil (Fig. S6). Moreover, in the RSF of Co/SiO2-H2, although a CoCo bond was observed at 2.1Å, a CoO bond was not observed at 1.7Å (Fig. 6c). Given these results, the white line at 7723eV was attributed to the small size of Co particles, and it can be concluded that Co3O4 on SiO2 was fully reduced to Co(0). The magnitude of the RSF that corresponds to the CoCo bond for Co/SiO2-H2 became smaller than that for Co foil. Because HAADF-STEM observations revealed that Co clusters (ca. 2nm) were dispersed on SiO2 after the H2 treatment, the decrease in the RSF magnitude was attributed to the decrease in the size of Co particles by their re-dispersion on SiO2. In the XANES spectra of 4NaCo/SiO2-H2 (Fig. 5e) the white line at 7723eV was more pronounced, and the shoulder peak at 7710eV was smaller than that of Co/SiO2-H2 (Fig. 5f). In the RSF of 4NaCo/SiO2-H2 (Fig. 6d), the peak that corresponds to the CoO bond was clearly observed at 1.4Å together with the CoCo bond at 2.1Å, which suggests that unreduced Co(II) species were contained in 4NaCo/SiO2-H2. Thus, Na ions inhibited the reduction of Co(II) to Co(0). A similar effect of alkali metals on the reduction of Co catalysts has been previously reported [30,31]. The linear combination fitting of XANES spectra was attempted to allow an estimation of the ratio of CoO and Co(0) in 4NaCo/SiO2-H2; however, the fitting failed owing to the absence of isosbestic points between 4NaCo/SiO2-H2, CoO, and Co foil. The lack of isosbestic points was probably due to the fact that the Co(II) species did not present as CoO but instead some other Co(II) species, such as cobalt silicate. On the basis of the XRD patterns of 4NaCo/SiO2, sodium silicate was formed (Fig. 1a). The change in the XANES spectra, caused by the decrease in the size of the Co particles, also complicated the fitting of the XANES spectra. The magnitude of RSF that corresponds to the CoCo bond for 4NaCo/SiO2-H2 (Fig. 6d) became much smaller than those for Co foil and Co/SiO2-H2 (Fig. 6c). This decrease in the magnitude can be rationalized by the disorder in the crystal structure of Co NPs induced by the presence of Co(II) and by the decrease in the size of Co NPs, which was also supported by HAADF-STEM observations. The basicity of the xNaCo/SiO2 surfaces was examined using CO2–TPD measurements (Fig. 7 ). The CO2 desorption peak at lower temperatures between 100°C and 150°C was attributed to the interaction of CO2 with weak basic sites [32,33]. The CO2 desorption peaks for 4NaCo/SiO2 and 7NaCo/SiO2 were more intense compared with that for Co/SiO2 in the range of 100°C to 200°C. In addition, a new shoulder peak at a higher temperature at around 200°C was observed. These results suggested that the addition of Na enhanced the basicity of the catalyst surface."
8,Characterization of catalysts after Fischer–Tropsch syntheses,"3.2 Characterization of catalysts after Fischer–Tropsch syntheses The catalysts after FT syntheses were characterized by HAADF-STEM and XAFS. Co NPs smaller than 5nm were observed together with 20nm-sized Co NPs in HAADF-STEM images for Co3O4-w and Co3O4-Na (Fig. S7a and b). Small Co NPs were presumably produced during the H2 treatment as observed in Co/SiO2-H2 (Fig. 2c). Although some aggregates of Co particles were observed for Co/SiO2 (Fig. S7c), Co NPs were highly dispersed on SiO2 without aggregation for 4NaCo/SiO2 (Fig. S7d). EDS analyses proved the presence of Na on both Co3O4-Na and 4NaCo/SiO2 after the reactions (Fig. S8). XANES spectra revealed that the chemical states of Co in the catalysts after the FT reactions (Fig. S9). Co3O4-w contained Co(0) and Co3O4, probably due to the air exposure during a catalyst separation after the FT reactions. Co/SiO2 also consisted of Co3O4 as a major species. Interestingly, the white lines of Co3O4-Na and 4NaCo/SiO2 were positioned at 7724eV, as observed in CoO, suggesting that Na inhibit the oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III). The existence of Co(II) as major species in Co3O4-Na and 4NaCo/SiO2 were also ascribed to the re-oxidation by air exposure."
9,Catalytic activity for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis,"3.3 Catalytic activity for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis 3.3.1 Unsupported cobalt catalysts Table 1 shows the results for FT synthesis catalyzed by unsupported Co3O4 catalysts and Fig. 8 shows the product selectivities with regard to the number of carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons were obtained as a major product over Co3O4-w (entry 1, Fig. 8a). This behavior was typical for Co-catalyzed FT synthesis. However, the alcohol selectivity remarkably increased to 41% for Co3O4-Na, whereas CO conversions remained greater than 50% (entry 3, Fig. 8b). Most of the produced alcohols were linear primary alcohols. In addition, higher alcohols (C5+ alcohols) were obtained with high alcohol distributions such as 74%. When the reaction was performed at a lower temperature (230°C), the CO conversion and the selectivity toward alcohols decreased (entry 2), probably because both the CO dissociation rate and the CO insertion rate for alcohol production decreased at lower temperatures. A higher reaction temperature (260°C) did not improve the CO conversions (entry 4). Moreover, the selectivity to alcohols decreased, which indicates that the CO hydrogenation rate was relatively enhanced compared to the CO dissociation rate. 3.3.2 Silica-supported cobalt catalysts Table 2 shows the results for FT synthesis catalyzed by Co/SiO2 and xNaCo/SiO2, and Fig. 9 shows the product selectivities with regard to the number of carbon atoms. Fischer–Tropsch synthesis proceeded over Co/SiO2 to afford hydrocarbons with a selectivity of 98% (entry 1, Fig. 9a). Although the alcohols formed represented a small portion of the products, methanol was the major alcohol product. In contrast to the unsupported Co catalysts, the addition of Na improved the CO conversion of the Co/SiO2 catalysts except for 0.5NaCo/SiO2, although the chain growth probability (α) slightly decreased. Given the addition of Na resulted in highly dispersed Co particles on SiO2, small Co NPs would compensate the deactivation by alkali metals, and thereby maintain the high CO conversion, by increasing the surface active sites, although the size of the Co particles did not affect the alcohol selectivities [34]. The addition of 0.5wt% of Na to Co/SiO2 slightly improved for the production of ethanol and propanol together with that of methanol (entry 2). An increase in the amount of Na increased both the alcohol selectivities in the total products and the higher alcohol distributions. The obtained alcohols were mostly linear primary alcohols as well as in the case of Co3O4-Na. Higher alcohols could be obtained as major alcohol products with 4NaCo/SiO2 (entry 4 and Fig. 9b) and 7NaCo/SiO2 (entry 5) catalysts. Although the addition of Na up to 7wt% gave the greatest distributions of higher alcohols, the effect of Na was almost constant in terms of alcohol selectivity when the loading of Na exceeded 4wt%."
10,Effect of alkali metals for Co/SiO2 on the alcohol formation,"3.4 Effect of alkali metals for Co/SiO2 on the alcohol formation To investigate the effect of alkali metal ions, we prepared Li, K, and Cs-modified Co/SiO2 using an impregnation method and compared their catalytic activities with that of 4NaCo/SiO2. As shown in Table 3 , the selectivities toward alcohols varied by the kind of alkali metal. The catalyst with Li added showed the lowest selectivity toward alcohols and produced methanol as a major product (entry 1). Potassium-modified Co catalysts exhibited the greatest selectivity toward higher alcohols, although the selectivity toward alcohols in the total products was very low (entry 3). The addition of Cs resulted in a positive effect similar to that of Na (entry 4). However, a longer reaction time was required for the catalyst with Cs (130h) compared to that for the catalyst with Na (22h), which indicates that Cs decreased the catalytic activity of Co. Among the alkali metals, Na appeared to be the most suitable modifier for alcohol formation in terms of the yields of higher alcohols (entry 2)."
11,Discussion,
12,Effect of alkali metals on alcohol formation,"4.1 Effect of alkali metals on alcohol formation Several reaction mechanisms have been proposed for FT synthesis [34] and one of the most acceptable mechanisms for the production of HCs is shown in Scheme 1A. In the initial step, CO adsorbed onto a metal(0) surface undergoes dissociative hydrogenation of CO to form metal-carbides. The carbene intermediates work as active species for chain propagation. Alkyl species formed by chain propagation on the metal surfaces is converted into alkenes by β-H elimination or to alkanes through hydrogenation. For alcohol formation, the CO insertion mechanism is widely accepted (Scheme 1B) [35]. After CO is inserted into a metal-carbon bond, acyl and hydroxyalkyl species are formed. Acyl species are hydrogenated to produce aldehydes and aldehydes can be further hydrogenated to form alcohols. Hydroxyalkyl species can also be converted to alcohols through hydrogenation. One of the other possible reaction pathways is the OH addition mechanism (Scheme 1C) [36]. The addition of alkali metals increases the surface basicity, which leads to a greater amount of basic hydroxy groups on the catalyst surface. The addition reaction of surface hydroxy groups into the metal-carbon bonds of alkyl species is facilitated to give alcohols. A hydroformylation pathway of alkenes can also produce linear and branched alcohols (Scheme 1D). The promotional effects of alkali metals on FT synthesis catalysts for the alcohol production have mainly been explained by three factors: (i) the suppression of dissociative CO hydrogenation to form methylene carbene and methane by covering surface active Co(0) sites or by electronic effects, thereby resulting in long chain HCs and low CO conversions [2,30,32], (ii) the decrease in the reducibility of Co(II) species which act as non-dissociative CO adsorption sites, i.e., CO insertion sites [15,30], and (iii) the enhancement of surface basicity, which inhibits side reactions such as isomerization, dehydration, and coke deposition [2,33]. As shown in Fig. 8, for unsupported Co catalysts, the selectivity toward methane dramatically decreased and the selectivities toward light HCs relatively increased while CO conversions were simultaneously decreased by the addition of Na. These results were probably due to the first factor. However, SiO2-supported Co catalysts showed the opposite tendency. Accordingly, CO conversions slightly increased with a decrease in high-molecular-weight HCs after the addition of Na (Fig. 9). Smaller Co NPs would presumably exhibit high catalytic activity for NaCo/SiO2-H2. In addition, the selectivities toward olefins decreased after the addition of Na. Because a certain amount of water is formed as a by-product of FT synthesis and is therefore contained in a batch slurry-phase reactor, the dehydration of hydroxyalkyl species in Scheme 1B would not be a major pathway in the production of olefins. CO insertion and/or OH addition into alkyl species are likely facilitated in the formation of alcohols compared to the β-H elimination and the hydrogenation of alkyl species. Taking into account that methanol was obtained only in a small portion over 4NaCo/SiO2-H2, the OH addition into carbene species (Scheme 1C) would not be a major pathway, although it cannot be ruled out. Hydroformylation generally takes place at much lower temperature than FT synthesis. In addition, taking into account that branched primary alcohols were not observed, Scheme 1D is not likely as a major pathway. Therefore, the CO insertion mechanism (Scheme 1B) can be considered as the most plausible reaction route for alcohol formation."
13,Conclusions,"We have demonstrated the synthesis of higher alcohols by FT synthesis over Na-modified Co catalysts. The selectivity toward higher alcohols with more than four carbon atoms (C5+ alcohols) was as high as 77% with high catalytic activities. The addition of Na led to (i) a decrease in the size of Co NPs, which resulted in a high catalytic activity, (ii) a greater abundance of Co(II) species resulted from the decreased reducibility of Co3O4, and (iii) an increase in surface basicity. The most pronounced effect of Na is its ability to supply Co(II) species, which act as CO insertion sites into alkyl species to give alcohols."
