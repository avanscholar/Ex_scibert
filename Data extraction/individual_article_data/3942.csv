0,Introduction,"In recent decades, researches on finding energy sources have received increasing attentions as global energy demand continues to grow [1–3]. Hydrogen energy has been widely regarded as an ideal non-polluting green energy source, due to its advantages such as high efficiency, storability, and transportation [4–8]. In 1972, Fujishima and Honda [9] first reported the phenomenon that photocatalytic decomposition of water by TiO2 single crystal electrode to generate hydrogen, thus revealing the possibility of water splitting into hydrogen driven by solar energy. Subsequently, a large amount of ultraviolet light-responsive metal oxide photocatalysts are researched for solar-driven H2 evolution from water splitting, mainly including transition metal oxides with d0 electronic structure (such as ZrO2, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 et al) [10–12] and metal oxides with d10 conﬁguration (such as Ga2O3, In2O3, and SnO2 et al) [13–16]. However, only 3%–4% of the solar spectrum absorbed by these metal oxide photocatalysts limits their efficiency. In order to extend the light-harvesting range, numerous visible light-responsive photocatalysts such as WO3, BiVO4, and Fe2O3 et al. [17,18] are also explored. Among these visible light-responded photocatalysts, CdS is one of promising semiconductors for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, because its narrow bandgap of 2.4 eV allows it to effectively make use of solar light below 520 nm [19–23]. Compared to the metal oxide photocatalysts, the more negative conduction band potential of CdS also makes it to be more suitable for water splitting into hydrogen [24,25]. Unfortunately, the hydrogen production efficiency over CdS is still relatively low due to the fast recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers [26]. A lot of strategies are employed to reduce the recombination rate of charge carriers. One of the widely used methods is morphology control that exploring various morphologies of CdS from 0-dimensional to 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional nanostructures [27–35]. With the surface volume ratio increases, the shortening of path of carrier transport could reduce the recombination rate. In addition, the development of surface/interface heterojunction between CdS and co-catalysts is also one of potential solutions to enhance interfacial charge carrier separation and transfer [36]. Up to now, various co-catalysts (such as Pt [37], Ni [38], Ni2O3 [39], Ni2P [40], NiS2 [41], Co(OH)2 [42], CoOx [43], MoS2 [44], MoP [45], Cd(OH)2 [46], Cd [47,48], graphene [49–51], et al.) have been explored to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of CdS. However, the insufficient contact between CdS and these co-catalysts also restricts the charge carrier transfer and the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. Here, we construct one CdS/Cd Schottky junction photocatalyst using the novel and ultrafast pulsed laser technique to improve visible light-driven hydrogen evolution from water splitting, during which the laser bombardment could destroy Cd-S bonds on CdS surface to form metallic Cd clusters on CdS surface. The 40-times enhancement of photocatalytic activity of CdS/Cd in first hour compared to pure CdS results from: 1) metallic Cd clusters serve as electron sinks to accept the excited electrons from CdS via Schottky junction to minimize electron-hole recombination; 2) the post-treated CdS shows stronger adsorption capacity of the sacrificial agents such as S2− and SO3 2− to promote the consumption of photogenerated holes; 3) the bandgap narrow of post-treated CdS also benefits the stronger light absorption. This work may provide a new approach to develop heterojunction-based photocatalysts for eﬃcient solar-to-chemical conversion."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of CdS photocatalyst,"2.1 Preparation of CdS photocatalyst The preparation of CdS photocatalyst was similar with the previous work [25]. An equimolar ratio of Cd(CH3CO2)2 (99.99%) was mixed with an aqueous solution of Na2S (99.99%). After the mixing solution was stirred for 24 h, the resulting yellow precipitate was collected. Then, the precipitate was dispersed in 72 mL of deionized water and sealed in a reaction kettle for 72 h at 200 °C. The precipitate was washed twice with alcohol and then dried for 24 h to obtain the yellow CdS powder."
3,Pulsed laser treatment of CdS photocatalyst,"2.2 Pulsed laser treatment of CdS photocatalyst The laser irradiation of CdS sample was performed using a Nd:YAG pulsed laser with the wavelength of 1064 nm (Continuum PRII-8000) [52]. The CdS powder was uniformly coated on a silica glass substrate with the size of 1 cm × 1 cm, which was vertically illuminated by a pulsed laser (the pulse duration is 8 ns and the frequency is 10 Hz) with scan mode in 1 W. The total duration of light irradiation is 1 min. The laser irradiated sample was named L-CdS."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterization was conducted on a Philips X’pert Pro diffractometer with radiation wavelength of 1.54 Å. The annular-bright-field (ABF) imaging was measured on a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) coupled with a spherical aberration corrector. The SEM was characterized on a S-4800. The fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were characterized by a Nicolet-6700 spectrometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was characterized on a ESCALAB Mk II spectrometer with Al Kα X-rays, and the binding energy was corrected by the C1s signal. The UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra were obtained by an instrument UV-2550 (Shimadzu) using BaSO4 as the reflection standard. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed using a Bruker Elexsys E-500 spectrometer at room temperature. The setting parameters of EPR are as following: modulation frequency: 100.00 KHz, modulation amplitude: 2.00 G, sweep width: 100.00 G, time constant: 40.960 ms, conversion: 40.000 ms, sweep time: 80.720 s."
5,Photocatalytic experiment,"2.4 Photocatalytic experiment Photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen was carried out in one Labsolar II system (Beijing perfectlight technology co. LTD). 20 mg of the photocatalyst was placed in 100 mL of solution containing 0.1 mol/L of Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents. The light source is 300 W Xe lamp via the filter with cut-off wavelength of 420 nm. Before irradiation, the system was vacuumed for 10 min via the vacuum pump to completely remove the dissolved oxygen. The generated gas was analysed by the gas chromatograph (GC7890II, Techcomp) using nitrogen gas as a carrier gas and a molecular sieve with a pore diameter of 5 Å. The stability performed in condition that the photocatalyst was used, re-collected and re-used for multiple times. The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under the same condition with excitation wavelength of 420 nm."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurement,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurement Five milligrams of photocatalysts and 10 μL of Naﬁon solution (5 wt %) were dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol and then ultrasonically dispersed to prepare a homogeneous catalyst ink. Next, 40 μ L of the catalyst ink was deposited onto an area of 0.196 cm2 on ITO conductive glass and then was dried in air. Photoelectrochemical characterization was performed in the three-electrode cell. CdS and L-CdS film, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl solution, and Pt foil were used as working electrode, the reference electrode, and the counter electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was the aqueous solution of 0.1 mol/L of Na2S and 0.1 mol/L of Na2SO3. The photocurrent was observed for each switch-on/-oﬀ ; event by using AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight plus filter with cutoff wavelength of 420 nm, and the applied potential of working electrode against the counter electrode was set to 0 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out by CHI-760E potentiostat (Shanghai Chenhua). The amplitude of the alternating voltage is 10 mV, and the frequency range is from 1 Hz to 100 kHz."
7,Results and discussion,"The atomic surface structure of CdS after laser irradiation treatment was directly characterized by aberration-corrected STEM analyses. The particle morphology of CdS was confirmed by SEM (Fig. 1 a, b). Fig. 1c shows the atomic-resolution ABF images of L-CdS with laser irradiation treatment viewed from the [100] crystallographic direction. The continuous atomic arrangement matches well with the CdS lattices viewed from the [100] direction, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The d spacing of 0.326 nm in region 2 is corresponded to the (002) plane of CdS with hexagonal crystal structure [53,54]. Furtherly, the atomic positions of Cd and S atoms were clearly distinguished in the Fig. 1e (Zone 2), in which the dark atoms are assigned to Cd atoms surrounded by slightly bright S atoms. Fig. 1d shows the enlarged region (Zone 1) on the surface of CdS. Only dark Cd atoms within the thin shell of ˜ 1 nm were observed with reduced brightness around Cd atoms, during which the structures are consistent with the simulation of the blue Cd atoms with the hexagonal crystal structure. The formation of metallic Cd clusters on CdS surface may be caused by the localized thermal eﬀ ;ect of the pulsed laser, which rapidly breaks Cd-S bonds on CdS to subsequently reduce Cd2+ into metallic state Cd. The measured d spacing distance is slightly different with that in the literature [55]. It is possible that the surface Cd is slightly distorted due to that the stress is not completely released. The above results indicate that the metallic Cd clusters on CdS surface are in-situ formed after laser irradiation treatment. In addition to electron microscopy, various spectral analyses were conducted for characterizing the samples. The XRD patterns of CdS and L-CdS are shown in Fig. 2 a. The identiﬁed peaks of XRD patterns could be perfectly indexed to CdS with hexagonal structure (ICDD-PDF No. 41-1049). No new diffraction peak appears in the spectrum after laser irradiation treatment of CdS, probably due to the low Cd content. To characterize the surface chemical states of L-CdS, the XPS spectra of the sample were measured. As shown in Fig. 2b, the peaks of Cd and S elements were observed. Fig. 2c shows the 3d electron spectrum of Cd, and the peaks located at 405.20 eV and 411.94 eV are corresponded to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively, indicating that the Cd2+ state of CdS. Compared with the pure CdS, the peaks of L-CdS shift toward lower binding energy, confirming the presence of metallic state Cd atoms from the reduction of Cd2+ by the laser irradiation treatment. As shown in Fig. 2d, the 2p electron spectrum of S can be fitted with two diffraction peaks located at 161.48 eV corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2− in pure CdS, respectively. The atomic ratio of S on the surface of CdS and L-CdS is 31.48% and 28.96%, respectively, revealing that the localized thermal eﬀ ;ect of the pulsed laser cause the evaporation loss of S atoms on the surface. Compared with the pure CdS, the peaks of S 2p in the L-CdS shift to higher energy, probably due to the loss of the S atoms on the surface and the build-in field formed in the energy alignment of Schottky junction. To evaluate photocatalytic activity of CdS and L-CdS, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting under visible light excitation (>420 nm) were conducted. It should be emphasized that no noble-metal co-catalysts such as Pt and Au and RuO2 were added in the photocatalytic system. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the total amount of hydrogen evolution over pure CdS is about 19.1 μmol g−1 under first hour of visible light irradiation. L-CdS shows 765.5 μmol g−1 of hydrogen evolution under the same test condition. And, the rate of hydrogen evolution over L-CdS in first hour is 40-time than that of pure CdS. It is revealed that the pulsed laser irradiation treatment of CdS can contribute to the enhancement of hydrogen evolution, probably owing to the in-situ formation of metallic Cd clusters on CdS surface. Fig. 3b shows the recycle runs of hydrogen evolution of L-CdS. After four runs, the hydrogen evolution rate has no obvious decrease, indicating the excellent stability of L-CdS under visible light irradiation. In addition, the QE of L-CdS is 0.82% under the excitation wavelength of 420 nm. In order to explore the mechanism of the enhancement of hydrogen evolution, several analyses were conducted. The photocatalytic efficiency is usually determined by the balance of thermody-namics and kinetics of light-harvesting processes, charge transport and separation processes, and catalytic reaction. Fig. 4 a shows the UV–vis spectra of CdS and L-CdS. Compared with the pure CdS, the absorption edge of CdS in L-CdS obviously shows a red-shift, and the intensity of the light absorption in the full spectrum range is also significantly enhanced, revealing that more charge carriers could be generated for the enhancement of hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Fig. 5 shows the photograph of the sample before and after laser treatment. After laser treatment, the sample color is deepened, which is consistent with the results of UV–vis absorptions spectra. In addition, the direct band gap of the samples can be obtained by fitting the linear portion of the Tauc curves ((Ahʋ)2 vs hʋ) (Fig. 4b) [56]. The band gap value of pure CdS is calculated to be 2.25 eV, which is in agreement with the literature value (2.25 eV) [22]. While the band gap value of CdS after laser treatment narrows to be 2.19 eV, probably because the evaporation loss of S atoms on the surface, and then destroys the original state of CdS surface to increase the opportunity of the formation of dangling bond on CdS surface, which may cause the narrow of the bandgap of CdS. The enhanced visible light absorption may be derived from the electronic interaction between the Cd and CdS at the interface. In order to characterize the valence band of CdS and L-CdS, valence-band XPS spectra were obtained. As shown in Fig. 4c, the valence band maximum is 1.6 eV for both samples, which is consistent with that in the literature [56]. The FT-IR measurement of CdS and L-CdS after photocatalytic test was conducted. As shown in Fig. 4d, the absorption peaks at 1119, 1023, and 665 cm−1 are assigned to the vibration of Cd-S bonds [57,58]. In addition, the broad band around 3432 cm-1 is corresponded to the stretch and bending vibration of −OH or H2O.22 The peak at 1409 cm−1 results from the adsorbed S2- and SO3 2- ions, which could quickly capture photogenerated holes to enhance hydrogen evolution activity on CdS surface [59]. It is clearly observed that the adsorption of S2- and SO3 2- ions over L-CdS is enhanced compared to pure CdS. So L-CdS shows stronger adsorption capacity of the sacrificial agents such as S2- and SO3 2- to promote the consumption of photogenerated holes, enhancing the separation of electron-hole pairs and thus the hydrogen evolution activity of L-CdS. To further characterize the separation and transportation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, the photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance were measured. Fig. 6 a shows the reproducible photocurrent responses for each switch-off and switch-on light cycles for CdS and L-CdS electrodes under visible light excitation (>420 nm). The photocurrent density of L-CdS is almost 2-times than that of pure CdS, indicating the higher separation efﬁciency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in L-CdS, because the metallic Cd clusters on surface of CdS can accept photogenerated electrons from CdS through the formation of Schottky junction between Cd clusters and CdS. In addition, L-CdS shows a smaller arc radius than CdS in the electrochemical impedance Nyquist plots (Fig. 6b), indicating that a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) results in the higher carrier separation efficiency of L-CdS. As shown in Fig. 6c, the stronger DMPO-•O2 − signal can be observed over L-CdS than that of CdS, indicating the accumulation of photogenerated electrons in L-CdS. Thus, the formation of CdS/Cd Schottky junction can accelerate the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in L-CdS to surface for photocatalytic hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 7 , the pulsed laser irradiation induces the in-situ formation of metallic Cd clusters on CdS surface to construct the Schottky junction between Cd clusters and CdS. The mechanisms for the improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance are illustrated in Fig. 7b. Firstly, the pulsed laser irradiation causes the band gap narrow of CdS, resulting in the enhancement of visible light absorption and the excitation of more electron–hole pairs. Secondly, the metallic Cd clusters on the CdS surface could capture the photogenerated electrons to improve the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs, thus participating in the hydrogen production reaction. Finally, CdS/Cd has a stronger adsorption capacity of the sacrificial agents such as S2− and SO3 2− to promote the consumption of photogenerated holes and also enhance the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Fig. 7c also shows the band structure illustration of the charge transfer process of CdS/Cd Schottky junction. The work function of CdS and metallic Cd clusters are 5.18 eV [60] and 4.08 eV [61] respectively. After contact, electrons in Cd will transfer to CdS until the Fermi level of the two materials are aligned, because the Fermi level of CdS is lower than that of metallic Cd. When CdS is excited by light irradiation, the photo-generated electrons on the surface of CdS will be driven by the build-in field and transferred to the surface of Cd. Therefore, all above factors favorably lead to the remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity of visible light-driven hydrogen evolution from water splitting. We also compare the photocatalytic H2-production activity of L-CdS with other state-of-the-art CdS-based photocatalysts reported in the literatures, as shown in Table 1 . It can be determined that the as-prepared L-CdS has higher activity that the prepared CdS by other methods without Pt as co-catalysts."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, the CdS/Cd Schottky junction induced from the pulsed laser irradiation is successfully developed as photocatalyst for efficient visible light-driven hydrogen evolution from water splitting, owing to that the in-situ formation of metallic Cd clusters on CdS surface can accept excited electrons through the Schottky junction to efﬁciently accelerate the separation of electron-hole pairs and endow more electrons for photocatalytic reduction reaction. Moreover, CdS/Cd has a stronger adsorption capacity of the sacrificial agents such as S2− and SO3 2− to promote the consumption of photogenerated holes, and the bandgap narrow of CdS also benefits the stronger light absorption, thus contributing to hydrogen evolution. This work may provide a new approach to develop heterojunction-based photocatalysts for eﬃcient solar-to-chemical conversion."
