0,Introduction,"Coal, oil and natural gas have been the primary sources of world energy during the 20th- and 21st-century; these fuels could be depleted within a few decades, so that, it is required to find alternative renewable energy resources and avoid a possible massive economic disruption that could cause a future global energy crisis. New energy sources, as hydrogen, will play an important role. Hydrogen can be produced efficiently and inexpensively by several techniques, as steam reforming [1–3], electrolysis [4,5] or hydrolysis [6–10]; however, photocatalytic water splitting is the most promising candidate [11–14]. It is known that, if you desired broke a water molecule to obtain H2 and O2, you need an energy close 237.7 kJ/mol [15]. So that, photocatalytic processes are considered to be a key technology since it involves absorption and conversion of solar energy to split water by irradiating oxide semiconductors, being the band gap of the semiconductor the main factor, i.e., the band gaps should be larger than 1.23 eV, corresponding to the water splitting potential [16]. During the latest decade, a lot of photocatalysts, with suitable band gaps and high efficiency, have been designed and synthesized [17,18]. However, most of them only use UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which constitutes a small amount of the solar energy and, only few are stable against photocorrosion reactions. Some nanomaterials, as polyoxometalate-based metal-organic frameworks [19], have been showed an important absorption in visible region but high solubility in the reaction mixture. So that, more stable samples that can absorb visible light must be developed, more important with high photo-activity to fully utilize solar energy. TiO2 is generally accepted as one of the most effective photocatalysts and is frequently used to oxidize organic and inorganic compounds and generate hydrogen from water or biofuel because its favorable electronic properties, low-cost, non-toxicity, strong redox potential and long-term photo-stability [20–26]. However, commercial TiO2 (P25) has exhibited a low photocatalytic activity in the hydrogen generation via water splitting using water-alcohol solution under UV light [27]. Significant efforts have been made to improve the characteristics of some semiconductors, such as TiO2. The preparation of mixed oxides [28–30], ion doping [31–33], surface sensitization [34–36] and noble metal loading [37–48] are considered the main methods to improve the photocatalytic activity because it produces an efficient charge separation or creates traps for electrons and/or holes that subsequently immobilize the charge carriers and thus reduce the recombination rate. The article aim is to propose a new surface modification of the conventional support (Aeroxide® P25), combining the hydrolysis and sol-gel processes. The nanoparticles (NPs) nature effect (Pd, Pt, Ag and Au) supported on modified TiO2 was also studied because it has been reported to be very effective for their enhancement. It have been reported that Fermi levels of these NPs are lower than that of TiO2, photo-excited electrons can be transferred from the conduction band to metal particles deposited on the surface of TiO2, while photo-generated valence band holes remain on the TiO2. These processes could reduce the possibility of electron-hole recombination, resulting in efficient separation and stronger photocatalytic reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of the modified titanium oxide,"2.1 Synthesis of the modified titanium oxide The modified TiO2 was synthesized combining a hydrolysis process of titanium(IV) butoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 97% purum grade) with sol-gel on the surface of the Aeroxide® P25 (Evonik Industries, ≥ 99.5% trace metals basic). In a typical experiment, 2 g of Aeroxide® P25, previously dried at 100 °C for at least overnight, was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring at a constant temperature of 90 °C for 2 h. After that, 6 mL of titanium(IV) butoxide was added dropwise maintaining the same conditions of temperature and stirring speed, until the translucent Ti-precursor sol has formed. After alkoxide precursor addition, the obtained solution was kept at 90 °C in an open vessel with continuous stirring for another 10 h and the resulting mixture was covered and aged for 1 week. The xerogel was stirred at room temperature for 2 h more and the solvent was evaporated at 90 °C. The obtained solid was dried at 100 °C for 12 h, crushed into a fine powder and calcined under static air at 300 °C, increasing at a linear rate of 5 °C/min from room temperature and keeping it for 3 h."
3,Preparation of TiO2-supported photocatalysts,"2.2 Preparation of TiO2-supported photocatalysts The photocatalysts were obtained using a well-known method as deposition-precipitation with urea. Palladium(II) nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.99% trace metals basis), chloroplatinic acid hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.995% trace metals basis), silver nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99% ACS reagent) and gold (III) chloride hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995% trace metals basis) were used as precursors of the Pd, Pt, Ag and Au NPs, respectively. In a typical procedure, 1 g of the modified support was firstly dispersed at 80 °C using 30 mL of an aqueous solution of 0.42 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 98% bioreagent grade). The obtained dispersion was stirred vigorously and the parent solution, with a molar concentration about 1.6 × 10−3 M, was added dropwise to obtain samples with 0.5 wt%, in the case of a complete deposition. The suspension was aged at 60 °C for 24 h under mild stirring. The resulting dispersion was recovered by centrifugation and washed several times with deionized water. The obtained solid was dried at 80 °C for 2 h, and calcined in static air, increasing at a linear rate of 5 °C/min from room temperature to 400 °C and keeping it for 3 h."
4,Support and photocatalysts characterization,"2.3 Support and photocatalysts characterization 2.3.1 X-ray diffraction XRD patterns were obtained using a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5456 Å). The diffractograms were obtained at 2θ = 20–60° (resolution = 0.021°/38.4 s) and 2θ = 35–50° (resolution = 0.019°/379.7 s) for the support and photocatalysts, respectively. Crystalline phases were identified with the help of the JCPDS-ICDD library using PDF card number [49]. 2.3.2 Transmission electron microscopy Conventional and high resolution TEM micrographs were obtained using a JEOL JEM 2010 microscope operated at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The average particle diameter and standard deviation (σ) were calculated from [∑nidi/∑ni] and [∑(di - d̄)2/∑ni]1/2, respectively, where ni is the number of particles of diameter di. 2.3.3 Field emission scanning electron microscopy The metal composition and elemental mapping were obtained using AZtec 2.1 software in an OXFORD INSTRUMENT X-MAX EDS spectrometer coupled to FE-SEM microscope JEOL JSM-7800F with a base pressure of 1.9 × 10−4 Pa. The mapping times were typically 30 min and the analysis were distributed over a scale of the order of a few micrometers. 2.3.4 Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy UV-vis DRS spectra were obtained at room temperature using a PERKIN ELMER LAMBDA-900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a LABSPHERE® PELA-1020 integrated sphere (2 nm slit widths) and spectralon as reference. The energy band gap (Eg) values were estimated from a plot of the modified Kubelka-Munk function versus the energy of absorbed light for the indirect allowed transitions."
5,Hydrogen production test,"2.4 Hydrogen production test The hydrogen production tests were carried out in homemade cylindrical batch photoreactor (Quartz®, 140 mm in length and 50 mm in internal diameter) equipped with two external-irradiation sources at a distance as close as possible (see Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI), Fig. S1). Before tests, the samples were reduced ex situ under a 30 mL/min flow of H2 in a vertical fixed-bed reactor (Pyrex® tube, 400 mm in length and 15 mm in internal diameter) increasing at a linear rate of 5 °C/min from room temperature to a final temperature of 300 °C, which was held for 1 h. After that, 50 mg of sample was dispersed in 100 mL of the reactant mixture (50 vol% methanol in water). The suspension was maintained at 600 or 800 rpm under a 100 mL/min flow of N2 in the dark for 30 min and an initial sample was taken to confirm that H2 was not formed during adsorption process. The reaction was started by irradiating the suspension at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The hydrogen evolution was analyzed by withdrawing aliquots each hour during 6 h using a double diaphragm pump coupled both photoreactor and PERKIN ELMER CLARUS® 480 gas chromatograph with TCD and ShinCarbon ST RESTEK packed column (2 m length and 1 mm internal diameter). TotalCrom Workstation software version 6.3.2 was used for the integration of the chromatographic signal. The produced H2 was quantified against a calibration curve of peak area versus amount of H2, previously obtained."
6,Results and discussion,"The structural characteristics of the modified TiO2 are presented in Fig. 1 . The diffractogram (Fig. 1a) shows a dominant body-centered tetragonal anatase TiO2 structure with space group symmetry I41/amd (PDF card 84–1286) [49] with semispherical shape and an estimated particles size up to 40 nm (Fig. 1b). The anatase phase identification can also be confirm with the HRTEM images (insets Fig. 1a), whose interplanar spacing at 0.352 and 0.191 nm can be assigned to the d101 and d200 crystallographic planes, respectively. A low contribution of a primitive tetragonal rutile TiO2 structure with space group symmetry P42/mnm (PDF card 82–0514) [49] was also identified (Fig. 1a); however, their crystallographic planes could not be seen in the HRTEM images. The conventional and high-resolution TEM images are shown in Fig. 2 . All reduced TiO2-supported active component revealed many small crystallites and also some amorphous clusters, as dark contrasts. It can also see that these reduced NPs are homogeneously distributed. The lattice fringe spacing for reduced TiO2-supported NPs are between 0.22 and 0.24 nm (insets Fig. 2) for Pd (PDF card 46–1043), Pt (PDF card 04–0802), Ag (PDF card 04–0783) and Au (PDF card 04–0784) [49]. They are consistent with the (111) crystallographic plane spacing of the NPs with structure face-centered cubic and Fm3m space group symmetry. The particle size distributions obtained by TEM images are show in Fig. 3 , while average particle sizes (defines as APS) are summarized in Table 1 . The APS values of the Pd and Pt NPs were 10.6 and 14.6 nm and exhibited relatively broad particle size distributions, while Ag and Au NPs presented lower sizes of 6.7 and 7.4 nm and narrow particle size distributions. The diffraction peaks of the modified support remain without noticeable changes in the diffractograms of the photocatalysts (Fig. 4 ), indicating that the structural integrity of TiO2 has been retained. The lattice fringe spacing obtained by HRTEM (insets Fig. 2) for Pd- and Pd-based photocatalysts are in agreement with their respective XRD results (Fig. 4). An overlap between the (112) diffraction peak of the anatase phase and the (111) crystallographic signals of the Ag- and Au-based photocatalysts at about 38.2°/2θ cannot be discarded. Another crystallographic signals at about 44.1°/2θ were also observed in all diffractograms and it is assigned to the (200) crystallographic plane of the reduced NPs (Fig. 4). FE-SEM-EDS results (Fig. 5 ) also show the presence of Pd, Pt, Ag and Au in their respective mapping, confirming that the clusters observed by TEM are metal NPs. The elemental mapping also demonstrated that active components are homogeneously distributed on the surface of the modified support. Furthermore, elemental loading results (defined as ML) suggest that the estimated metal contents are close to the theoretical values (see Table 1). A deviation less 16 wt% could be due to soluble complexes formation that would be eliminated during the wash step, producing an incomplete deposition. The optical properties, obtained by UV-vis DRS technique, are shown in Fig. 6 . As it is shown in Fig. 6a, modified TiO2 exhibited an intense absorption band at about 400 nm corresponding to an Eg = 3.15 eV and, it was attributed to intrinsic band gap of anatase TiO2, in agreement with XRD and HRTEM results (Fig. 1a and their insets); all metal photocatalysts presented the similar absorption band. It can also be seen that metal NPs incorporation produced an absorption increase in the visible region and an Eg decrease compared to the modified support, as TiO2 > Au/TiO2 > Ag/TiO2 > Pt/TiO2 > Pd/TiO2 (see Eg values in Table 1), that can be associated to the light absorption due to the excitation of electrons in the NPs. TiO2-supported Au- and Ag-based photocatalysts (inset Fig. 6, lines b and c) exhibited a defined signal at about 593 and 579 nm that are associated to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect; LSPS signals are caused by a damping effect of the d-d interband transitions in response to optical excitation [50]. Ag/TiO2 exhibited a LSPR peak at lower wavelength than Au/TiO2 that could be attributed to their particle sizes, because it is know that the width and position of the LSPR band increases with particle size [51]; in agreement with the APS values observed in Table 1. On the contrary side, TiO2-supported Pt- and Pd-based photocatalysts (inset Fig. 6, lines d and e) showed an undefined broad section in the visible region, indicating that these NPs do not exhibited any LSPR effect, as have been previously reported by Chen et al. [52]. Rahulan et al. have also been reported that LSPR signal in Pt NPs cannot observe because it appears in a short-wavelength region, where TiO2 completely absorbs all incidents light [53]. The hydrogen production via photocataeslytic water splitting using modified TiO2 and TiO2-supported metal photocatalysts with different reduced NPs were tested under purple irradiation of 13 W simultaneously emitting UV and vis light (see lamps characteristics in ESI, Fig. S1). The photogenerated hydrogen evolutions during 6 h with a stirring speed of 800 rpm are shown in Fig. 7 a, while the hydrogen production rate values for both stirring speeds (600 and 800 rpm) are presented in Fig. 7b. The photocatalytic reaction was also investigated without photocatalyst (photolysis reaction) and did not observe any evidence of hydrogen generation from water-methanol mixture. All photocatalysts, measured at 600 rpm (ESI, Fig. S2) and 800 rpm (Fig. 7a), showed a pseudo-linear increase in the produced hydrogen during continuous 6 h. As expected, modified TiO2 showed a very negligible hydrogen production rate (378 μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 at 800 rpm) and it has been associated to fast recombination of electron-hole pairs when a radiation is applied [27,54]. The metal NPs incorporation resulted in a significant improvement in both amount and production rate of hydrogen when compared with the modified TiO2 because the transfer of the photogenerated electrons from support to metal particles, resulting in a decrease in electron-hole recombination, as well as in efficient charge separation. As it can be seen in Fig. 7, Au/TiO2 (2336 μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 at 800 rpm) and Pt/TiO2 (2940 μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 at 800 rpm) photocatalysts exhibited better both amount and production rate of hydrogen, being almost 6.3 and 7.8 times higher that modified TiO2 one. On the other hand, Pd/TiO2 (1663 μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 at 800 rpm) photocatalyst was 4.4 times more active, while Ag/TiO2 (716 μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 at 800 rpm) only exhibited 1.9 times, indicating that NPs nature had a significant influence on the generated hydrogen. The lower amount and production rate of hydrogen may be due to relative weak electron trapping capability of Ag and Pd NPs when compared to Pt or Au ones. The reduction capacity at 25 °C from Pt2+ to Pt (ε° = 1.18 eV) and Au3+ to Au (ε° = 1.498 eV) are more favored that Pd2+ to Pd (ε° = 0.951 eV) and Ag+ to Ag (ε° = 0.7996 V) [55], for this reason is possible that a large fraction of Ag and Pd NPs could not be reduced during activation. It is know that the oxide/metal ratio could affect the photoreduction capacities. In fact, unreduced NPs adversely work as electrons recombination centers when overloaded, as have been reported by Yang et al. when Ag NPs are used [56]. On the other hand, the physicochemical characterizations also indicated a relationship between the APS values with the hydrogen production capacities, i.e., smaller APS, as showed Ag/TiO2, do not favor the hydrogen production. On the other hand, both amount and production rate of hydrogen also depend on the stirring speed. As shown, the amount (comparison between Fig. 7a and Fig. S2) and production rate (Fig. 7b) of hydrogen decrease between 1.2 and 1.3 times with decrease of the stirring speed from 800 to 600 rpm because it is necessary to have turbulence in the reactor and not a cyclonic movement of the liquid-solid system. A relation between absorption edge energy values and hydrogen production did not observe. The comparison with previous reports are very complex because the metal loading, preparation method, radiation conditions, sacrificial reagent and water-hole scavenger ratio are carried out in different ways by different research groups, making the evaluation very difficult (see Table 2 ). Because this, it is set out two suitable measures for comparison of photocatalytic performances between different research groups. In the first one, the photogenerated hydrogen should be represented as amount of produced hydrogen per used amount of catalyst (such as μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ) as a reaction time function and, in the second one, the hydrogen production rate ( r H 2 ) values must be determined from the slope of the linear part of the generation curves (such as μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 ). Considering it, it has been observed that our photocatalysts possess higher r H 2 compared to similar ones reported in the literature (see Table 2). Lalitha et al. have been published that Ag/TiO2 photocatalyst is not active for the hydrogen production, when water-methanol mixture and solar irradiation were used [42], but another authors have been demonstrated that can be obtained better r H 2 values [41,44,47]. Our Ag-based photocatalyst presented a better r H 2 , which is between 2 and 4.8 times more active, despite that metal loading was smaller than the reported one. Similarly, our TiO2-supported Pt-, Au- and Pd-based photocatalysts showed r H 2 up to 10.7, 35.4 and 39.6 time more active than the similar formulations previously reported. Only a Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst presented higher r H 2 , however, the increase is insignificant; it is just 5.8% more active than ours [48]."
7,Conclusions,"In summary, we have successfully synthesized some NPs/TiO2 photocatalysts (NPs = Pd, Pt, Ag and Au) that have been showed a structure face-centered cubic highly dispersed on a dominant body-centered tetragonal anatase phase. The photocatalysts were evaluated in the hydrogen production via splitting reaction. The results showed that the surface modification of the support allowed obtaining highest hydrogen production rate that similar samples already reported. Au- and Pt-based photocatalysts presented highest both amount and production rate of hydrogen, unlike Ag- and Pd-based photocatalysts that exhibited lower generation capacity. The photocatalytic performance could be associated to highest electron trapping capability of Au and Pt NPs when compared to Ag or Pd ones. The physicochemical characterizations also indicated a relationship between average particle size (APS) with the hydrogen production capacities, i.e., smaller APS, as Ag/TiO2 (APS = 6.7 nm), did not favor the hydrogen production rate ( r H 2 = 716 μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 ), on contrary, higher APS, as Pt/TiO2 (APS = 14.6 nm), favor it ( r H 2 = 2940 μ m o l ⋅ g c a t − 1 ⋅ h − 1 ). It was also observed that the hydrogen production capacities were strongly dependent on the stirring speed, resulting 800 rpm the most convenient stirring rate."
