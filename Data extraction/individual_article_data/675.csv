0,Introduction,"Increasing concerns about accessibility of fossil fuels and the motivation to protect the environment from global warming effects have led to many efforts to develop inexpensive and sustainable technologies for treating renewable resources to replace conventional petro-based industry [1–3]. Indeed, the production of energy and chemicals from sustainable feedstocks, such as biomass, has emerged as an economically valid and environmental-friendly alternative to current petroleum-based fuels [4,5]. Biomass-derived carbohydrates have been recognized as an abundant, green and alternative source to produce sustainable biofuels [6,7]. As a biomass-derived platform molecule, Levulinic acid (LA) can be employed for the preparation of resins, solvents, polymers and chemical intermediates, which are utilized for cosmetic, pharmaceutical, pesticide, and fungicide production [8–12]. In particular, among other derivatives of levulinic acid, γ-Valerolactone (GVL) has received a great deal of attention from both academia and industry. It has been widely used as an additive for biofuels, green solvent, and suitable precursor for valuable chemicals like olefins, polymers and 5-nanonone [13,14]. Valorization of levulinic acid has been investigated via reduction processes in the presence of high-pressure of molecular hydrogen or through catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reactions [15–17]. Myriad studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CTH processes with both technological and economic advantages (without external H2) for the selective hydrogenation of levulinic acid towards GVL by employing inexpensive H-donors of the alcohols or formic acid, like hydrogen source leading to safer operation environment [16,18,19]. Levulinic acid conversion into GVL by employing various zirconium-based catalysts such as ZrO2 [19,20], UiO-66 (Zr) [21], sulfonic acid functionalized Zr-UiO-66 [15], Al–Zr mixed oxides [22] and Cu/ZrO2 [23], Zr-SBA-15 [24], among others has been reported [25,26]. According to reported research, the design of functionalized mesoporous materials as sustainable heterogeneous catalysts is essential to develop their versatile roles towards viable biomass valorization [27–30]. Advances to synthesize the efficient catalytic system for transformations of biomass into biofuels and related chemicals, profound understanding to introduce active sites of functionalized catalysts properties have provided like Brønsted-Lewis acidic, acidic–basic and metal nanoparticles-acidic or basic ones [31]. In this study, the first time we have demonstrated the formation of sulfonamide functionalized groups on Zr(20%)-SBA-15 mesoporous materials with uniform mesoporous structure via simple synthesis for the versatile application. A large number of studies have been carried out to synthesize the silica surface functionalization with organic groups for the modification of mesostructured silicates surface [32–34]. Organically functionalized mesoporous materials are with properties such as large and uniform pores, high surface area, and a large number of active sites represent an attractive alternative to the homogeneous and other heterogeneous catalytic systems. The number and nature of the surface of traditional heterogeneous catalysts have been limited and catalytic activity can only be studied in their scope reactions. Whereas, soluble organic catalysts have been used in a variety of reaction types but cannot be recycled. Researchers have synthesized organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts by the immobilization of organic groups onto solids catalysts to be designed efficient catalyst with special properties. Therefore, the organic moiety is successfully used as the active site and the solid catalyst is utilized to develop to recovery and recyclability the organic active site [35–39]. The use of the anchored organic functionalities to the surface of the SBA-15 mesoporous supports has been attention paid to employees for a wide range of catalytic reactions [40]. Functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous as an excellent candidate has been applied in sustainable catalysts such as scavenging of heavy metal cations [41], for capturing CO2 molecules [42], Knoevenagel, Michael and Henry reactions, Claisene Schmidt condensation with one-pot reactions of several components [43–45]. The interesting research comparing functionalized mesoporous catalysts and organic counterparts carried out show these catalysts have due to their numerous advantages including high catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions, high selectivity, short reaction times, easy recovery and reuse in several cycles have reported as efficient heterogeneous catalysts [37,46]. Moreover, functionalized SBA-15 and ZrO2-SBA-15 have also been reported as efficient catalysts in CTH processes for biomass conversion [47,48]. In particular, sulfaguanidine (SGD) [49], sulfadiazine (SDZ) [50], and sulfathiazole (STZ) [51] as sulfonamide (SFA) derivatives [52] have been employed in previous reports for the preparation of silica functionalized materials, for alkylation, oxidation and multicomponent coupling reactions [53,54]. Upgrading of biomass-derived platform molecules could also be carried out by oxidative transformations [55–57]. For instance, oxidation reactions of alcohols towards aldehydes and ketones have received notable consideration by the scientific community since they are part of numerous industrial processes [58,59]. Due to the strong acidic nature of Zr/SBA-15, applied in many industrial reactions such as hydrocarbon isomerization, alkylation, oxidation, and etherification, the high content of zirconium species frequently provided excellent catalytic properties in benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde conversion [60,61]. This work provided good design versatile catalysts by incorporating Zr4+ cation into the original material on robust mesoporous support that led to the release of their catalytic activity and stabilization of these active metal sites. Subsequently, functional groups of sulfonamide (SFA) derivatives, were grafted onto the surface of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 mesoporous material, aiming at producing far more effective catalysts than the Zr(20%)-SBA-15 catalyst, led to a modification of surface and improvement of catalytic performance. Functionalized SBA-15 porous materials with outstanding stability are ideal supports for constructing highly exposed acid sites with well-dispersed nanoflake morphology for versatile organic reactions. Hence, the design of porous nanomaterials for researchers has been interesting with catalytically activated centers at the surface of porous materials [62]. The synthesized sulfonamide functionalized Zr(20%)-SBA-15 catalysts, for both oxidation and reduction reactions for biomass valorization, have been reported. Production of γ-valerolactone from levulinic acid through CTH processes and conversion of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde by employing hydrogen peroxide as green oxidant have been herein investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Triblock copolymer Pluronic P123, hydrochloric acid (HCl), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, purity 98%), zirconyl chloride octahydrate (ZrOCl2.8H2O), sulfoguanidine, sulfathiazole, sulfadiazine, isopropanol, levulinic acid, ethanol and toluene were provided by Sigma–Aldrich."
3,Synthesis of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA mesoporous silica,"2.2 Synthesis of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA mesoporous silica 2.2.1 Synthesis of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 mesoporous silica Zr(20%)-SBA-15 (Si/Zr = 20 ratio) materials were synthesized according to a previously reported protocol (Scheme 1 ) [63,64]. P123 (8.1 g) was dissolved in 300 mL of HCl solution (1.5 M). Upon complete dissolution, the required amount of ZrOCl2.8H2O (1.3 g, 0.004 mol) was added and kept under stirring for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 16.8 g (0.08 mol) of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was dropwise added and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 35 °C. Afterwards, the sample mixture was transferred into an oven-drier for 24 h at 100 °C. The product was then filtered, washed, and dried at room temperature. The sample was calcined at 600 °C in air atmosphere for 6 h in order to obtain the desired catalyst, denoted as Zr(20%)-SBA-15 (where 20% refers to the Si/Zr ratio). 2.2.2 Synthesis of chloro-functionalized material (Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl) The preparation of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl was carried out by sonicating 4g of the previously obtained Zr(20%)-SBA-15 in dry toluene (100 mL) for 45 min (Scheme 1). 3-Chloropropyl trimethoxysilane (10 mL) was added to the dispersed Zr(20%)-SBA-15 and it was slowly heated to 105 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at the aforementioned temperature. The resulting chloro-functionalized Zr(20%)-SBA-15 was filtered, washed three times with diethyl ether and dichloromethane, and finally dried under vacuum. 2.2.3 Preparation of sulfonamide functionalized samples (Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA) The synthesized Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl (1 g) was mixed with ethanol (40 mL), followed by sonication during 45 min to produce a homogenously mixed solution (Scheme 1). Sulfonamides (1 g); namely, sulfaguanidine (SGD), sulfathiazole (STZ), and sulfadiazine (SDZ), were added under mechanical stirring, and the mixtures were heated at 80 °C for 24 h. Afterwards, the obtained solids were filtered, washed with diethyl ether (3 × 20 mL) and dichloromethane (3 × 20 ml), and finally dried at room temperature for 24 h, giving rise to Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ."
4,Characterization of materials,"2.3 Characterization of materials XRD measurements were carried out in the Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer with the LynxEye detector. Low angle XRD analysis was performed in a 2θ scan range from 0° to 6°. Bruker Diffrac-plus Eva software, supported by Power Diffraction File database, was used for phase identification. N2 physisorption measurements were accomplished in the Micromeritics ASAP 2000 equipment. Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed under vacuum (p < 10−2 Pa) for 24 h. TEM images were acquired using a FEI Tecnai G2 instrument, equipped with a CCD (“charge coupling device”) camera. The materials were previously dispersed in ethanol and deposited on a copper grid. Furthermore, SEM-EDX micrographs were acquired in the JEOL-SEM JSM-7800 LV and SEM FEI Quanta 200 LV scanning microscope. FTIR spectra were obtained on an infrared spectrophotometer (ABB MB3000 with Horizon MBTM software) equipped with an ATR PIKE MIRacleTM sampler and a window of ZnSe by performing 256 scans at a resolution of 8 cm−1. Along the analysis, the sample was purged with a dehydrated and deoxygenated nitrogen flow. TGA was performed on a PerkinElmer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 800 °C under dynamic air atmosphere (10 mL/min). Pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine chromatographic titration experiments were carried out at 300 °C. The catalytic materials were fixed inside a tubular stainless steel microreactor (4 mm internal diameter). Cyclohexane solutions of titrant (0.989 M in PY and 0.686 M in DMPY, respectively) were injected through the microreactor and analysed by gas chromatography."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests 2.4.1 Catalytic activity in reduction reactions In a typical experiment, a reaction mixture containing 0.2 g of the synthesized catalyst, (1 mmol) Levulinic acid in (5 mL) isopropanol as hydrogen donor solvent was carried out in a stainless-steel autoclave with efficient stirring at 160 °C and it was pressurized with 10 bar of Ar. Reaction conditions were optimized by using varying reaction parameters, including temperature, pressure, solvent effect, and catalyst amount. The liquid products collected from the reaction mixture were analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu GC-14B) with a flame ionization detector equipped with a capillary column (Zebron ZB-FFAP; 0.32 mm × 50 m; Phenomenex) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Conversion of substrate and yields of products were quantified using n-dodecane as internal standard. The conversion, selectivity and yield were determined from the chromatograms by applying the following formulas: Conversion ( % ) = [ C LA . initial − C LA . final C LA . initial ] × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = C GVL [ C LA . initial − C LA . final ] × 100 Yield ( % ) = [ C GVL C LA . initial ] × 100 CLA. Initial: Concentration of the reactant (levulinic acid) before the reaction CLA. Final: Concentration of the reactant (levulinic acid) after the reaction CGVL: Concentration of the product (γ-Valerolactone) To assess the catalyst reusability, the spent catalysts were recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration, washed with ethanol, dried at 100 °C, and then subjected to multiple catalytic runs. 2.4.2 Catalytic activity in oxidation reactions Benzyl alcohol (1 mmol), acetonitrile (4 mL), and the desired catalyst (25 mg) were added into a necked flask and then H2O2 (50 wt%, 0.2 mL) was slowly added under stirring and refluxing conditions. The reaction mixture was kept at 80 °C and the progress of the reaction was checked every 20 min for 2 h by Gas Chromatography (GC) with FID detector (AgilentTechnologies, GC6890N). The best conversion and selectivity were achieved after 80 min. The conversion and selectivity values were calculated as follows: Conversion ( % ) = [ C BA . initial − C BA . final C BA . initial ] × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = C BZ [ C BA . initial − C BA . final ] × 100 Where CBA.initial and C BA.final refer to the concentrations of benzyl alcohol before and after the reaction, respectively, and CBZ is the concentration of benzaldehyde."
6,Results and discussion,"Due to the increasing demand for reactions of biomass conversion by heterogeneous acid-catalyzed, the stability and catalytic efficiency of present functionalized porous materials should be improved as a versatile catalyst. The design and construction of specific activity centers around acid sites is an efficient tool for achieving these targets. Functionalized porous materials have attracted much attention as activated centers of catalyst to utilize in versatile catalyses [27–30]. An efficient strategy is introduced to design functionalized mesoporous materials as sustainable heterogeneous catalysts for developing functionalization Zr(20%)-SBA-15 with sulfonamide derivatives as their versatile roles towards viable biomass valorization. The numerous active sites with Zr(20%)-SBA-SFA porous frameworks were synthesized by the efficient method: (1) SBA-zirconia porous frameworks with both Lewis acid sites and basic sites (Zr4+O2− pairs) that uniformly embedded in the Zr(20%)-SBA-15 mesoporous materials for facilitating transfer hydrogenation reactions through MPV mechanism, and (2) grafting with functionalized-sulfonamide derivatives are composed of (3-Chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane cross-linked by Zr(20%)-SBA-15 porous nanomaterials, and these sulfonamide groups can act as Brønsted acid sites in the mesoporous catalysts of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA, led to producing high yields of γ-valerolactone. Importantly, these materials combine the good and well-known textural properties of SBA-15, with the typical acidity of zirconium-based materials [65,66] and the presence of functional groups, which could certainly have a positive influence in the selectivity of a chemical reaction. The samples were fully characterized by a multi-technique approach and the results will be commented in the following paragraphs. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Type IV isotherm) of all samples exhibited the typical shape of mesoporous materials (Fig. S1) [67,68]. The textural properties of SBA-15, Zr(20%)-SBA-15 mesoporous structure and sulfonamide grafted samples are summarized as specific surface area, and both mean pore size diameter, and total pore-volume calculated by the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) equation in Table 1 . According to the obtained results, after grafting of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 samples with chloro-functionalization groups and sulfonamide derivatives, the value of adsorbed nitrogen is decreased, which is related to the presence of functionalized molecules within the pores of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 samples [69]. N2 physisorption analysis of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 revealed a remarkable surface area of 562 m2 g−1. As observed in Table 1, after chloro-functionalization, SGD, STZ and SDZ groups, the surface area is drastically decreased to 107, 103, 99 and 57 m2 g−1, respectively. Moreover, surface area of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl did not experience a considerable change by further incorporation of sulfaguanidine and sulfathiazole, while, in turn, modification with sulfadiazine implied a decrease of 47% of this textural feature. The pore volume of the modified samples decreased in comparison to the parent Zr(20%)-SBA-15. The mean pore diameter of modified mesoporous Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ decreased from 5.27 to 3.54, 3.53, 3.53 and 3.52 nm after functionalization of chloro and sulfonamide derivatives. The results of pore size distribution calculated by the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) equation method applied to the desorption branches of the isotherms, and a diminution of pore diameter values after grafting of chloro-functionalization groups and sulfonamide derivatives are also observed (insets in Fig. S1). The mesoporous materials have been shown uniform, narrow pore size distributions are centered at about 3.52–3.54 nm, and the modification of mesoporous Zr(20%)-SBA-15 with functionalization of chloro and sulfonamide derivatives has not damaged the hexagonal structure of this material. As reported in previous research, generally, the mesoporous SBA-15 materials have a negligible external surface area [70]. Therefore, it is expected that functionalization of chloro and sulfonamide derivatives are mostly grafted inside the mesoporous materials. As the results have shown, decrease in surface areas, pore-volume, and pore diameters in the sulfonamide grafted Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl compared to Zr(20%)-SBA-15 mesoporous material is attributed to the presence of chloro-silane groups within the pores after the grafting process. Low angle XRD analysis of the prepared materials was carried out in order to investigate their porous structure (Fig. 1 ). XRD results of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 showed a typical diffraction pattern, related to SBA-15-like hexagonal structure, exhibiting a high intensity peak located at 0.95° and an additional band at 1.76°, which could be assigned to (100) and (110) crystallographic planes, respectively [71]. XRD patterns of the functionalized samples certainly differ from the expected SBA-15-based materials. The observed shifts of the (100) and (110) peaks suggested a disordering around the pore architecture, maintaining the hexagonal structure upon functionalization [72]. The BET results indicate more detailed characteristics of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA with the decrease in surface areas, pore-volume, and pore diameters, proving that the order of the mesopore structure of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA become weaker after modification by chloro and sulfonamide derivatives, which are well consistent with the results of XRD. For the pore Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD sample, these peaks could not be identified, suggesting a more disordered pore structure. A similar case was reported with Luminogen-functionalized mesoporous SBA-15, which has a relatively poor ordered mesophase due to the loading of aminopropyl groups inside the channel [73]. With regard to the samples reported from XRD patterns of functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous, several authors have established that the structural disordering around the pore architecture of functionalized groups on SBA-15 mesoporous materials is increased but has been maintained the hexagonal structure [74–77]. The morphology of the prepared samples was investigated by TEM and SEM, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 and S2. TEM analysis of a representative sample; namely, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA, displays the characteristic porous structure, typical of SBA-15 [78,79]. Such results are in accordance with XRD data and support the idea that the samples retain the hexagonal structure after the functionalization steps. Furthermore, elemental composition and morphology of the samples were also investigated by acquiring SEM micrographs (Figs. 3 and S2) and Electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. S3, Table S1) of samples, Zr(20%)-SBA-15 and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD/STZ/SDZ, revealing in all cases a porous architecture and the presence of silicon, oxygen and zirconium, homogeneously distributed over the materials surface. More importantly, for Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD/STZ/SDZ samples, the presence of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur was also detected, confirming the successful functionalization of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 with sulfaguanidine, sulfathiazole, and sulfadiazine which additionally seems to be homogeneously distributed on the sample. The acidic features of the prepared samples were determined by the chromatographic method of pulses employing pyridine and dimethylpyridine. The obtained results are summarized in Table S2. Brønsted acid centers were evaluated by titration with dimethylpyridine due to the steric hindrance of methyl groups in this basic probe molecule. In addition, analyses employing pyridine were also carried out to quantify the total acidity of the samples since pyridine could be adsorbed nonspecifically in both types of Lewis and Brønsted centers. All samples displayed a major presence of Lewis acid sites in comparison to Brønsted acidity. Remarkably, acidity greatly increased after the functionalization step by using the three investigated sulfonamides. Especially, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ exhibited the highest total acidity, while Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD showed the highest percentage of Brønsted acidity (37%). FT-IR spectroscopic analysis was carried out in order to confirm the incorporation of the organic moieties on the surface of the SBA-15-based sample. Similar FT-IR spectra were obtained for SBA-15, Zr(20%)-SBA-15 and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl materials (Fig. S4 A). In all cases, a distinctive, highly intense and broad band appeared in the 1070-1100 cm−1 range, together with an additional peak around 800 cm−1, which could be attributed to the Si–O–Si asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations, respectively [80]. Moreover, broad bands around 3500 cm−1 were found for all the samples associated with the presence Si–OH groups [81]. Moreover, the presence of a signal around 1600 cm−1, related to carboxyl group stretching vibration, could be observed [82]. For comparison, the three employed sulfonamides were also investigated by FT-IR measurements. As observed in Fig. S4 B, C and D, additional bands were found in the spectra after functionalization (clearly visualized for Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ) which appears at the same wavenumber as those visualized for each sulfonamide, respectively. In particular, the sulfonyl group, which is present in the three samples, was clearly observed around 1328 cm−1 for Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ, while for the other two samples, it appears overlapped with Si–O–Si asymmetric signal [83]. Furthermore, FT-IR spectra of sulfaguanidine and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD sample displayed the presence of a characteristic band at 1556 cm−1 to attribute the (NH2) bending frequencies peaks, indicating the successful functionalization of the Zr(20%)-SBA-15 surface [84]. The incorporation of sulfathiazole was also confirmed by the appearance of a signal at 1639 cm−1, most likely associated with the stretching frequencies of the ν(CHN) band, in addition, N–H bending vibration has appeared at 1582 cm−1 [85,86]. The thermogravimetric analysis has corroborated the presence of functionalized sulfonamide on Zr(20%)-SBA-15 catalyst in Fig. S5 A. As shown, a one-step weight loss was been reported for three samples of Zr(20%)-SBA-SFA while the combustion proceeded more gradually in the Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD sample. The mesoporous Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD samples also showed a weight loss of 15% at 200 °C which extends up to 700 °C. The investigation of the obtained results of the thermograms reveals that Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ nanoparticles undergo degradation with a weight loss of 26.5% that was observed at 210–720 °C (Fig. S5 B). Subsequently, the thermograms curve of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ sample is observed with a weight loss of 45.71% that was displayed at 215–710 °C (Fig. S5 C). The DTA curves of both samples (Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ) show two exothermic peaks at 244 °C and 390 °C that confirm the decomposition of functionalized sulfonamide and 3-chloro-propylmethoxysilane, respectively. Therefore, the functionalized sulfadiazine content in Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ is more than the sulfathiazole and sulfaguanidine content in Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD samples which are consistent with the result found in the EDX analysis. The catalytic activity of the designed materials was examined in the transfer hydrogenation of levulinic acid towards GVL, employing isopropanol as hydrogen donor solvent. LA into GVL can be converted through a cascade reaction involving sequential transfer hydrogenation and ring-closing steps [87]. Looking forward to a complete optimization of the key reaction conditions (Fig. 4 ), the experiments were carried out 1) varying the reaction temperature to 120 °C, 140 °C and 160 °C, 2) with the effect of reaction pressure with variation from 0.5 to 10 bar, 3) employing methanol, 2-butanol, instead of i-propanol, and 4) using 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 g of catalyst. According to the previous literature, the higher reaction temperature in the CTH has favoured the conversion of levulinic acid to GVL [15,88]. Therefore, LA conversion was improved by investigating different temperatures. By accomplishing the reaction at 120 °C, 160 °C, and 160 °C (Fig. 4A), comparable improved results were obtained, achieving the highest conversion at 160 °C. Such results could be related to the stability and reactivity of the active centers of the designed catalyst, in this case based on sulfaguanidine, at different temperatures. Fig. 4B indicates the effect of reaction pressure with variation from 0.5 to 10 bars in the back-pressure regulator with the optimized temperature. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation of levulinic acid has rarely proceeded without system pressure, while process progress has improved in the presence of pressure. This improvement of CHT performance could be attributed to the enhancement of reagents’ adsorption on the surface of the material pores, facilitating the contact between reagents and the catalytic sites. As can be seen in the obtained results, with an increase in 5 bar system pressure, the levulinic acid conversion is increased from 37% to 75%, subsequently, an increase in pressure to 10 bars has an obvious effect on the levulinic acid conversion and the GVL selectivity from 75% to 99% and from 77% to 90%, respectively. In comparison to i-propanol, 2-butanol and methanol proved to be a less efficient hydrogen donor solvent, as could be inferred from the drastic decrease in selectivity, and the lower conversion and yield values (Fig. 4C). In addition, by increasing the catalyst amount from 0.1 to 0.2 gr, conversion, selectivity and yield values increased (Fig. 4D). When increasing the amount catalyst to 0.3gr, LA conversion did not change. Finally, optimized reaction conditions in the conversion of LA to GVL are as follows: 0.2 g Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA, 1 mmol LA in isopropanol, 160 °C , 10 bars, which were applied to test the stability of functionalized mesoporous materials. Blank experiments were carried out under the investigated conditions in order to confirm the role of the catalytic systems. No conversion of levulinic acid was observed by performing the reaction in the absence of catalyst (Table 2 , entry 1). Similar results under the same conditions were obtained in the presence of SBA-15 without the conversion of levulinic acid that demonstrated the role of Zr in supporting materials (Table 2, entry 2). In turn, by using Zr(20%)-SBA-15 and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl, conversion values of 42% and 45% were achieved, respectively (Table 2, entry 3 and 4). The highly dispersed Zr4+−cation with the aid of Lewis acid sites in Zr-SBA-15 is the dominant active species, and it converted LA to GVL by increasing the hydrogenation rate [89]. Remarkably, functionalization with sulfaguanidine resulted in a great enhancement of the catalytic results, obtaining conversion values higher than 99%, with selectivity and yield towards GVL of 90% and 89%, respectively (Table 2, entry 5). Compared to the obtained results of Zr-SBA-15 and Zr-SBA-SFA nanocatalysts, the enhancement of the catalytic activity of Zr-SBA-SFA materials in CHT has been observed, which is due to the presence of sulfonamide in the catalyst structure, which has led to an increase in modifying the surface affinity for the substrates/reaction products. Reaction Conditions: LA (1 mmol), Zr/SBA-SFA (0.2 g), 160 °C, 6 h, i-propanol (5 mL), 10 bar. LA conversion and GVL yield were calculated based on GC analysis after 6 h of reaction. Under the optimized conditions, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ (Table 2, entry 6 and 7) displayed a good catalytic performance, but in any case, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD showed the best results for the conversion of levulinic acid into GVL. Such results could be most likely associated with the highest percentage of Brønsted acid sites in Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD sample. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5 , catalytic performance of the samples kept rising until 6 h of reaction. Afterwards, conversion, selectivity and yield remained stable with no further improvement. Therefore, 6 h was considered optimum reaction time in this case. Outstandingly, the results herein obtained are comparable and competitive with those reported in the literature for other zirconium-based materials with regard to reaction conditions (Table S3). Reusability analysis of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ was performed over 4 reaction cycles (Fig. 6 A, B, and C). Remarkably, the designed materials proved to be highly stable, therefore, allowing their reutilization without need for a regeneration treatment. Selectivity to γ-Valerolactone stayed practically unaffected after the fourth use, for the three investigated samples. In turn, conversion values decreased in a 7%, 10% and 9%, in comparison to the obtained values after the first use, for Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD, Zr(20%)-SBA-15-STZ and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SDZ materials, respectively. In addition, GVL yield decreased in around 9–10%, in comparison to the initial results, for the three samples. These results are highly promising, since the prepared catalysts are active, selective and stable for the synthesis of GVL, and therefore this work could contribute to the establishment of sustainable industrial processes for the production of environmentally friendly solvents and biofuel additives following the green chemistry principles. The surface morphology has been used by SEM image for comparison of the fresh and reused catalyst (Fig. S6) to demonstrate whether the recovery of the catalyst could lead to the collapse of porous architecture. The SEM images were almost similar indicating the stability of the catalyst structure that has preserved its porous structure. Finally, a hot-filtration test was performed by filtering the solution mixture after 1h [90], and before the substrate is consumed. The conversion reaction of levulinic acid was carried out under the same reported conditions in the presence of all three nanocatalysts, which separated the nanocatalyst by hot filtration. After filtration, the solution was transferred to another flask to allow a total reaction time of 24 h. The conversion reaction in all three samples determined that was no significant increase in the conversion (Fig. 6D, E, and F). Functionalized organocatalysts supported on mesoporous are known as active sites for many catalytic reactions. To alter the performance of the catalytic activity, some efforts have been made to design the structure of porous materials. A series of zirconium-SBA-15 mesoporous materials has exhibited excellent transfer hydrogenation activity in LA conversion to GVL using inexpensive alcohols as an H-donor. The primary focus of this study is to investigate the nature of Lewis acidity of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 catalyst and the effect of the functionalized-sulfonamide derivatives on SBA-15 mesoporous structures that have been taken into consideration due to the presence of large amounts of Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. According to the proposed mechanism (Fig. S7), we expect that the nature of Lewis acidity of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 catalyst leads to the hydrogenation of keto CO group, and hydroxyl groups in alcohol are activated by acid-basic sites (Zr4+, O2), while the functionalized-sulfonamide derivatives as high chemoselectivity have an auxiliary role in CTH promoted reactions. Both acidic and basic sites of Zr(20%)-SBA-15 mesoporous play a key role via the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction mechanism as transfer hydrogenation catalysts [91–93]. The first step is the interaction between the isopropanol molecule and the Lewis acid and basic sites in the catalyst pore surface that are dissociated with isopropanol to form the corresponding alkoxide. Meanwhile, the carbonyl group in levulinic acid molecules is adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst pore surface. During the two steps next, the presence of the sulfonamide functionalized groups as the Brønsted acid sites of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SFA catalyst is led to the esterification reaction of LA molecules to produce an intermediate of isopropyl levulinate. By forming an intermediate of protonated LA, the electrophilicity properties of the carbonyl carbon are increased that led to the proton transfer for releasing of water. Subsequently, at the fourth step, the transfer hydrogenation reaction is carried out via the catalyst promotes by 2-propanol dissociation to release active H∗ to convert into unstable isopropyl 4-hydroxypentate, which has inclined to carry out the intramolecular lactonization reaction to produce GVL. According to the proposed mechanism, in the first step the acid sites catalyzed the esterification of levulinic acid to its esters, which then underwent the CTH reaction to obtain GVL. The conversion of LA to GVL are process the tandem steps of (I) the esterification reaction of the COOH group in LA molecules with C–OH alcohol to produce an intermediate of isopropyl levulinate, (II) the transfer hydrogenation reaction to convert into unstable isopropyl 4-hydroxypentate, and cyclization to yield GVL. In order to clear understanding of the role of the acidic sulfonamide functionalized in LA to GVL reaction and investigation the sequence of progressive steps of reactions, we compared the rate of the esterification and the hydrogenation reactions by Zr(20%)-SBA-15 and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD mesoporous catalyst. On the basis of the proposed reaction process, by using an alternative acid substrate such as pentanoic acid and 2-pentanone under the same conditions and at the beginning of the reactions were examined the esterification reaction rate and the hydrogenation reaction rate of each individual step (Scheme 2 , Table 3 ). Generally, the reaction rates are more sensitive to the activities of the catalysts at the beginning of the reactions at low conversion [94]. The rate of esterification (reaction A, Scheme 2), hydrogen transfer (reaction B, Scheme 2), and the conversion of LA to GVL (reaction C, Scheme 2) by Zr(20%)-SBA-15 sample is obtained <0.2, 2.19, and 1.05 mmol g−1 h−1 in 1h, respectively. Subsequently, the obtained results of esterification (reaction A, Scheme 2), hydrogen transfer (reaction B, Scheme 2), and the conversion of LA to GVL (reaction C, Scheme 2) by Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD catalyst are shown high activity, giving reaction rate at 5.92, 3.97 and 2.09 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Comparing the rate of esterification reaction in the presence of both Zr(20%)-SBA15 and Zr(20%)-SBA15-SGD samples, the rate of esterification reaction for Zr(20%)-SBA15-SGD sample is shown higher than Zr(20%)-SBA15 sample. It is worth emphasizing that the functionalized sulfonamide group on Zr(20%)-SBA15-SGD mesoporous catalyst is led to catalyze the esterification reaction and increasing reaction rate. The functionalized sulfonamide derivatives on Zr(20%)-SBA15-SFa catalysts which has strong Lewis acid-basic and Brønsted acid sites, could faster catalyze the esterification reaction. As well, the high activity of functionalized mesoporous catalyst in the all steps in proposed mechanism might also confirmed to the good catalytic performances as functionalized heterogeneous catalyst for biomass valorization of renewable feedstock. Versatility of the herein reported catalytic systems was investigated by testing the samples in oxidative processes, in particular, for oxidation of benzyl alcohol towards benzaldehyde (Table 4 ). Blank measurements were carried out by performing the reaction in the absence of catalyst, displaying conversion values lower than 10% (Table 4, entry 1). Furthermore, Zr(20%)-SBA-15 and Zr(20%)-SBA-15-Cl samples showed improved conversions of 43% and 47%, with selectivities to benzaldehyde of 61% and 72%, respectively (Table 4, entry 2 and 3). In any case, a clear enhancement of conversion and selectivity values was achieved by employing the sulfonamide functionalized materials (Table 4, entry 4–6). Remarkable conversions over 90% and selectivities over 95% were obtained for the three samples. Therefore, functionalized sulfonamide support on Zr-SBA-15-SFA mesoporous catalyst with high surface area and accessible pore structure is an attractive option to oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and catalytic activity has found to be directly correlated to its acid site density. Accordingly, ordered structures of Zr-SBA-15-SFA mesoporous catalysts with enhanced acidic and morphological properties, offer a unique opportunity as a high-performance catalyst to tune these properties to produce benzaldehyde. Reaction optimization, considering catalyst amount and H2O2 volume was carried out for the catalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol towards benzaldehyde, employing Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD catalyst (Fig. S8). Various catalysts quantities and oxidant volumes were tested, obtaining the highest conversion by using 25 mg of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD and 0.2 mL of H2O2. Moreover, selectivity results displayed a similar trend regarding catalyst amount, but resulted in slightly lower values by increasing the H2O2 volume, most likely due to the formation of overoxidized products. Reusability analysis of Zr(20%)-SBA-15-SGD was studied over 4 reaction uses, as displayed in Fig. 7 . The employed catalytic system retained a good catalytic activity, with conversion and selectivity values of 88% and 89%, after the fourth use. The herein obtained results demonstrated the suitability of sulfonamide functionalized mesoporous catalysts for both oxidation and reduction reactions, with great potentialities for upgrading biomass-derived platform molecules towards high-added value products."
7,Conclusions,"This work has reported a strategy to modify the heterogeneous catalyst of acid sites by conjugating functionalized sulfonamide and Zr/SBA-15 mesoporous silica with activated centers and dispersed morphology. In summary, sulfonamide functionalized mesoporous catalysts have been successfully synthesized without critical modification of the typical hexagonal structure of the parent SBA-15 material. The synthesized catalysts have proved to be active and highly selective in the production of GVL by levulinic acid transfer hydrogenation. Importantly, these materials also displayed outstanding catalytic results in the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol towards benzaldehyde, therefore, revealing a promising versatility for both oxidation and reduction reactions. On grafting sulfonamide derivatives on the surface of Zr-SBA-15 mesoporous (Zr-SBA-15-SFA), the conversion of levulinic acid to GVL and the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde significantly increased compared to the Zr-SBA-15 mesoporous materials. High-performance (Zr-SBA-15-SFA) catalysts have led to produce GVL with above 80% yield and 90% selectivity, and the benzaldehyde produce with >99% selectivity that are correlated with the overall activity of the acid site density of functionalized sulfonamide supported on Zr-SBA-15 mesoporous samples. Consequently, the designed catalyst with the Lewis acidity nature and acid strength of the functionalized group influenced by factors such as its structure, texture, porosity, surface area, accessibility of its acidic sites has led to enhanced acidic and morphological properties to produce higher GVL yield. As one of the most important parameters considered for heterogeneous catalysis, reusability of the materials displayed remarkable results over fourth reaction uses in the two investigated reactions. The obtained observations of recycling results have justified the good recyclability of the catalyst. For this purpose, the functionalized-species of Zr(20%)-SBA-SFA catalysts were studied via hot filtration. The results did not show any active species of the catalyst leaching out into the reaction mixture and establishing a truly heterogeneous catalyst. Highlighting their versatility and reusability, the synthesized materials could represent a valuable alternative for biomass conversion reactions that functionalized Zr-SBA-15-SFA mesoporous catalysts can be introduced as the environmentally-friendly catalysts."
