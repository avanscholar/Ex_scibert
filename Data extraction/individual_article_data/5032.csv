0,Introduction,"Alcohols with more than two carbons, described as C2+ alcohols or mixed alcohols, are extensively utilized as chemical intermediates, such as plastics, solvents, paint, and aromatics, as well as alternative fuel. The demands for C2+ alcohols are increasing year by year. Currently, C2+ alcohols are synthesized by hydration or hydroformylation of olefins, which are derived from fossil resources [1]. Recently, it has become necessary to manufacture C2+ alcohols from sources other than fossil resources. Because the biomass wastes or residues can be used as feedstock for the production of C2+ alcohols via gasification to syngas, which is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the manufacture of C2+ alcohols does not need to rely solely on fossil resources. Therefore, considerable attention has been focused on the process of transforming syngas to mixed alcohols [2,3]. Noble metals, such as rhodium, exhibit good catalyst performance with their selectivity for C2+ alcohols [4,5]. However, these catalysts are sensitive to sulfur poisoning [6]. Thus, from a cost perspective, it is essential to explore non-noble metal catalysts for alcohol synthesis applications. Molybdenum-based catalysts are considered a promising candidate for the synthesis of mixed alcohols [2,3,7–9]. It is well known that the addition of transition metals, such as cobalt, as promoters to sulfided Mo/Al2O3 or MoS2 drastically improves hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity, and that WS2 or Cr2S3-based catalysts have similar activity to those of MoS2-based catalysts [10–13]. The addition of a transition metal to catalysts based on group VI metals also has the potential to promote the synthesis of mixed alcohols, e.g., by improving the propagation of carbon chains. This potential comes from the fact that transition metals, such as Fe, Co, and Ni, are also used as catalysts for F–T synthesis. The addition of group VIII metals, especially cobalt, on unsupported alkali–MoS2 catalysts was reported to shift the selectivity for methanol toward C2+ alcohols and to decrease the selectivity for hydrocarbons [14]. Similar effects of adding cobalt were also shown in our previous study [7]. Therefore, alkali and Co-doped catalysts based on group VI metals could be expected to produce more C2+ alcohols. In our previous study, we investigated the effects of acidity on catalysts during the synthesis of mixed alcohols [7]. Lower amounts of acid and an appropriate loading of K on the catalysts promoted the formation of C2+ alcohols. Ceria, which is a basic oxide, is available as a catalyst support for the exhaust-gas treatment of diesel engines and the steam reforming reaction, and it is known as a reducing agent [15,16]. It was also reported that ceria supports possessed reducibility and a redox equilibrium with Cu (Ce4+ +Cu0 ⇔Ce3+ +Cu+) in the synthesis of C2+ alcohols over CsCuCeO2 catalysts [17]. Because MoS2-based catalysts possess the relatively high activity necessary for water–gas-shift reactions, they can readily form CO2 [3,9]. It was proposed that CO2 is formed via the surface catalytic reaction of the non-dissociatively adsorbed CO species, or CO molecule, with O* species derived from dissociatively adsorbed C–O species [3,7,18]. Therefore, it is likely that a ceria support could accept the dissociated oxygen species, and the formation of CO2 might be suppressed on ceria-supported catalysts. The influence of group VI metals on catalysts with a ceria support has not been elucidated with regard to the synthesis of C2+ alcohols. Thus, to elucidate those effects in the present study, we focused on evaluating the abilities of various K–Co-group-VI–metal–ceria catalysts to synthesize C2+ alcohols. A series of catalysts with ceria supports were prepared by impregnation, and the roles of ceria and the catalyst activation methods were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Ceria in power form (Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co., Japan) and SiO2 (Japan Oil Co.) were purchased and used as supports. For preparation, commercial GR grade hexaammonium heptamolybdate 4-hydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24 ·4H2O), chromium nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3 ·9H2O), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2 ·6H2O), and potassium precursors: potassium nitrate (KNO3) or potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan, respectively), were used, and commercial 1 grade ammonium tungstate para pentahydrate ((NH4)10W12O41 ·5H2O (88.0%)) was used. The feed gas was a mixture of a standard mix of H2/CO/N2 (45/45/10 vol.%) and hydrogen (purity: 99.999 vol.%)."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts All catalysts were prepared by the conventional and sequential impregnation procedure according to our previous study [7]. Ceria or SiO2 support was impregnated with aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24 ·4H2O, Cr(NO3)3 ·9H2O, or (NH4)10W12O41 ·5H2O as group VI metal precursors firstly, and was evaporated to dryness. Next, the aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 ·6H2O was introduced successively. The impregnated samples were pressurized for shaping under 60MPa for 5min and then pulverized to 20–80mesh. After calcining in air at 450°C for 12h, the Co–group VI metal oxide precursor was impregnated with a solution of K2CO3 or KNO3, being evaporated to dryness, and calcined in air at 450°C for 12h in the same way. The loading amounts of K2O (or K2CO3), CoO, and group VI metal oxides are listed in Table 1 . For investigation of the effects of group VI metals, the ratio of group VI metal to ceria support was constant at 0.23 (mol/mol). The prepared samples were denoted as K x Co yzMCe (x: molar ratio of K/M; y: molar ratio of Co/M; z: weight of group VI metal (wt.%); M: group VI metal (Cr, Mo, or W), abbreviation to parenthetic C in the case of K2CO3, and only “K” in the case of KNO3). All catalysts were pretreated according to one of three procedures. In the sulfidation procedure, all samples were sulfided in situ with a mixed gas of 5vol.% H2S and 95vol.% H2 at a flow rate of 30ml/min at 400°C at temperature ramp rate of 5°C/min and atmospheric pressure for 3h. For reduction of the K005Co0620MoCe sample, hydrogen (purity of 99.999vol.%) was substituted for a mixed gas of H2S/H2 at the same flow rate, pretreatment temperature and temperature rate, and time as those used for sulfidation. The K005Co0620MoCe sample was also pre-sulfided at 400°C for 3h and was then reduced at 320°C for 3h to investigate the effects of the catalyst activation methods."
4,Characterization of catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts The specific surface area and pore size of all samples were determined using N2 adsorption with an automatic specific surface area and pore volume measurement device (BELSORP-mini II, BEL Japan) [19]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (RAD-IIC, Rigaku Co.) with Cu Kα radiation. A continuous scan mode was used to collect 2θ data from 5° to 80° at the rate of 1.5°/min. The voltage and current were 40kV and 30mA, respectively. The reducibility of the sulfided catalysts was measured with the temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) using a ChemBET Pulsar TPR/TPD instrument (Quantachrome Instruments). Before H2-TPR measurements, several samples (0.1g) were pretreated as described above in Section 2.2. H2-TPR analyses were performed by a previously published method [7]. H2S molecules, which were adsorbed from sulfided samples, were trapped with grained Fe2O3 as adsorbent. Prior to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, all samples were pretreated in a quartz reactor. The XPS measurements of the catalysts were taken using a Shimadzu ESCA 3200 photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a magnesium source (Mg Kα=1253.6eV) that was operated at 8kV and 30mA under previously published conditions [20]. The envelopes of Mo 3d, Co 2p, S 2p, K 2p, O 1s, C 1s, and Ce 3d were measured and those spectra were deconvoluted with a curve-fitting based on a Gaussian function."
5,CO hydrogenation and analysis,"2.4 CO hydrogenation and analysis Prior to activity tests, all catalysts were pretreated as described above in Section 2.2. The tests for alcohol synthesis from syngas were performed using a fixed-bed pressurized flow reaction system with a micro-reactor of conventional design. The detailed experimental procedures and sampling methods followed those of a previously published source [7]. The reaction conditions were 260–300°C, 5.0MPa, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 5000h−1, and H2/CO ratio of 1.0 or 2.0. An online gas chromatograph was equipped with FID (Model GC-14B, Shimadzu; CP-Sill 5CB, 0.25mm×60m length) to analyze any oxygenated compounds produced, such as alcohols and hydrocarbons. The oxygenated compounds as esters were not detected regarding all samples under the detectable analysis condition. Another online GC–TCD (Unibeads C, 1/8in.×2.0m length, GC-323, GL Science Inc.) was equipped to analyze CO as the reactant and the CO2 and C1–4 light hydrocarbons that were produced. The catalytic performance was also evaluated by CO conversion (%), the selectivity based on carbon for a product (%-C based), space–time–yield (the yield per a weight of catalyst [mol/h/kg-cat.]) of alcohols, and the probability of carbon chain growth in hydrocarbons and alcohols [7]."
6,Results,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The textural properties of the prepared catalysts and ceria support are listed in Table 1. The surface area of K005Co0610MoSi was larger than that of K005Co0610MoCe. As the Mo loading amount increased, the surface area decreased from 71.6 to 48.3m2/g. The decline in surface area, when the loading amount was increased from 15 to 20%, was larger than that which increased from 10 to 15%. The addition of a large amount of metal led to a decrease in specific surface area, indicating that the dispersion of metal for the 20% Mo loading might be lower than that for Mo loads of less than 15% on the corresponding catalysts. XRD patterns of the oxidized, reduced, and sulfided catalysts and the ceria supports were measured and are shown in Fig. 1 . In each sample, several peaks occurred with strong intensities on all catalysts and were similar to those of the ceria supports. The peaks at 21.9°, 25.0°, 30.0°, 40.0°, 45.0°, 47.8°, 54.3°, and 57.0° appeared in all sample patterns. No other peaks corresponding to the lattice of active metals were observed. These results indicate the high dispersion of metals on all samples. To investigate the effects of Mo loadings, the supports, and the activation methods, H2-TPR profiles were performed and are shown in Fig. 2 . A dominant peak appeared when the Mo loading was changed from 10% to 20%, as shown in Fig. 2A (a)–(c). The peak at the range of 530–634°C was ascribed to the partial reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ of amorphous, highly defective, multilayered Mo oxides or heteropolymolybdates and octahedral Mo species [21–23]. With increasing the Mo loading, the main peak shifted to the high temperature from 530 to 634°C, and the peak area increased, indicating an increase in H2 consumption and the formation of metal species, i.e. bulk MoO3, which was difficult to reduce on the catalysts. The profiles for the different supports are given in Fig. 2A (d)–(f). Two peaks appeared: one at low temperatures ranging from 509–620°C and another at the high temperature of 864°C. The low-temperature peak was assigned to the partial reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ on the catalysts. The peak at 864°C was generally related to the deep reduction of Mo4+ to Mo, including the highly dispersed tetrahedral Mo species strongly bound to the support [24,25]. The high-temperature peak at 864°C for the ceria-supported sample was smaller than that for the SiO2 or Al2O3 supported samples. This finding means that the ceria support had weak interaction with the metals compared to the SiO2 and Al2O3 supports. The effects of the activation method on a K005Co0620MoCe catalyst are shown in Fig. 2B. In Fig. 2B (g), three main peaks appeared on the sulfided catalysts. The first peak resulted from the reduction of a thiol group at 200–400°C. The second peak resulted from the decomposition of the CoMoS phase at 700–900°C (CoxMoySz →Co9S8 +MoS2), and the remaining peak resulted from the reduction of MoS2 at 900–1000°C [26]. There were three main peaks at 329, 831, and 993°C for the sulfided samples. The three peaks were attributed to reduction of the -SH group, the decomposition of the so-called CoMoS phase, and reduction of MoS2, respectively. In Fig. 2B (h), the same peaks as those for the sulfided samples were detected for presulfided plus reduced K005Co0620MoCe except for a peak at 506°C, but these peaks were smaller than those observed for sulfided samples, indicating that the reduction of presulfided catalysts naturally decreased the amount of active sites on the -SH group, the CoMoS phase, and the MoS2 phase. The profile of the reduced catalyst had no specific peaks below approximately 400°C, and broad peaks appeared above its temperature, as shown in Fig. 2B (i), indicating that the reduced catalyst was not reduced again below 400°C, and the metal species resistant to reduction, such as bulk MoO3, were reduced as the oxidized catalysts. XPS measurements were performed on the samples that were pretreated by different methods. The binding energies and ratios of active metal species with different atomic valences are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 . The XPS spectrum of Mo 3d was decomposed into five peaks by curve fitting based on Gaussian function: Mo4+ 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2, Mo5+ 3d, Mo6+ 3d5/2, and Mo6+ 3d3/2. As shown in Table 2, the doublet peaks of Mo4+ 3d for all samples showed two strong peaks for Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 at binding energies of 228.6eV and 231.9eV, respectively, which indicated the formation of MoS2 species [27–30]. The weak doublet peaks at 232.6eV and 235.7eV were assigned to Mo6+ 3d5/2, and Mo6+ 3d3/2, respectively, ascribed to a part of the oxidic form that was still present after sulfidation. The peak for the Mo5+ species flattened and was subtle; it was characteristic of the oxysulfide MoOxSy phase with peaks at 230.0eV [29,31]. The peak at 225.8eV was assigned to S 2s [32]. The Co 2p spectrum contained at least three chemically shifted Co 2p3/2 peaks at 777.8eV, 778.9eV, 781.4eV, which were assigned to the Co9S8 species, the Co–Mo–S phase, and Co2+ respectively, and the peak at approximately 785.0eV was attributed to one shakeup peak [32,33]. Usually, the full sulfidation of Co2+ species is difficult and represents an interaction of Co with the support [32,34–36]. The shakeup peak for Co 2p was excluded from the composition of Co species. The S 2p spectrum was decomposed into two components at 161.5eV and 162.8eV, which were attributed to S2− 2p and S2 2− 2p, respectively. The binding energies were estimated with an accuracy of ±0.1eV. Table 3 shows that the S/Mo ratio, which represents the sulfidation degree, for the sulfided sample prior to reduction was smaller than that for the sample that was only sulfided. Simultaneously, the ratios of CoMoS/Co and Co9S8/Co for the presulfided+reduced sample were also lower than those for the sulfided sample. The degree of sulfidation for the presulfided+reduced sample was smaller than that for the sulfided sample. The ratio of Mo4+/Mo was in the following order: sulfided sample≧presulfided+reduced sample>reduced sample, and the ratio of (Mo5+ +Mo6+)/Mo was in the inverse order. When the sulfided sample was reduced, the ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ was also increased. This finding indicates that the structure of the ceria support transformed from CeO2 to C2O3."
8,CO hydrogenation,"3.2 CO hydrogenation 3.2.1 Ceria supported catalyst To investigate the effects of the supports, C2+ alcohol syntheses were performed over two catalysts supported on ceria and silica, i.e., K02Co0610MoSi and K02Co0610MoCe, under the following conditions: 260°C, H2/CO ratio of 1.0, 5.0MPa, and GHSV of 5000h−1. The results are shown in Table 4 . The results from an Al-supported catalyst are also shown for comparison [7]. In CO hydrogenation, the main reaction products were methanol, C2+ alcohols, C1–4 hydrocarbons, and CO2. The formation of alcohols competed with F–T synthesis and a water–gas shift reaction during the CO hydrogenation reaction [2,37]. Among the three supports, CO conversion for the silica support was 0.9%, and the lowest. The selectivities for hydrocarbons, CO2, and C2+ alcohols were 37%, 30%, and 22%, respectively. With the ceria support, the selectivities for both hydrocarbons and CO2 were suppressed to ca. 19% and the selectivity for C2+ alcohols and CO conversion were 47% and 3.2%, respectively, which were higher than those for silica. Ceria showed the best performance of the three supports with regard to C2+ alcohol synthesis. 3.2.2 Comparison of group VI metal–ceria catalysts To compare the group VI metals as active metals on the ceria support, activity tests on three catalysts, K(C)005Co06MCe (M=8.6Cr, 15Mo, 22W) at the constant M/Ce ratio of 0.23, were performed under the following conditions: 280°C, H2/CO ratio of 2.0, 5.0MPa, and GHSV of 5000h−1. The CO conversion and selectivity for reaction products with catalysts based on different group VI metals are shown in Fig. 3 . The space time yields (STYs) of C2+ alcohols for the group VI metal-based catalysts are listed in Table 5 . On the Cr-based catalyst, the CO conversion (8.9%) was approximately equal to that on the Mo-based catalyst and the order of conversion among the group VI metals was Cr=Mo>W. However, the selectivity for alcohols was the lowest for the Cr-based catalyst among the three catalysts. The selectivities for methanol and C2+ alcohols were in the following order: Mo>W>Cr. Hydrocarbons were the dominant product on the Cr-based catalyst, and the selectivity for hydrocarbons was 78%. The order of selectivity for hydrocarbons was in the reverse order of the selectivity for alcohols: Cr>W>Mo. There was little difference among the group VI metals with regard to the selectivity for CO2, which was approximately 10%. Therefore, the selectivity for C2+ alcohols, the CO conversion, and the STY of C2+ alcohols on the Mo-based catalyst were higher than those on the W-based catalysts and reached 25%, 8.5%, and 0.61mol/g-cat./h, respectively. The STY of C2+ alcohols was in the following order, as shown in Table 5: Mo>W>Cr. Among the group VI metal-based catalysts, the Mo-based catalyst most favored the formation of C2+ alcohols. To investigate the stability in activity of the prepared catalysts, the activity test with sulfided K005Co0620MoCe catalyst was carried out under the condition of H2/CO ratio of 2.0, 5.0MPa, and 5000h−1. The reaction temperature was set at 260, 280, and 300°C, and then returned at 260°C again. The changes in the space–time yields of products with time on stream are shown in Fig. 4 . At the first temperature of 260°C, the space–time yields of methanol, C2+ alcohols, hydrocarbons, and CO2 were 0.23, 0.08, 0.21, and 0.03mol/h/kg-cat., respectively. At the final temperature of 260°C, those were 0.24, 0.07, 0.19, and 0.02mol/h/kg-cat., respectively. It was observed that the activity for alcohol synthesis was almost constant, comparing at both temperatures of 260°C. This means that no significant deactivation was observed during the period of at least 10.5h. 3.2.3 Effects of Mo loading The effects of Mo loading on catalytic activity were investigated on sulfided K005Co06MoCe catalysts at an H2/CO ratio of 2.0, 5.0MPa, and GHSV of 5000h−1, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . At 260°C, when the Mo load increased from 11 to 15%, CO conversion and selectivity for C2+ alcohols increased to 11% and 37%, respectively, and CO2 selectivity also increased slightly, while the selectivities for methanol and hydrocarbons were decreased. At more than 15% Mo loadings, C2+ alcohol selectivity became almost constant at 38% whereas the CO conversion was dropped to 7.7%. The optimum Mo load was 15%. The conversion and all selectivities at 280°C resembled those at 260°C in the curve of the graph. At 300°C, the CO conversion and the selectivities for methanol, C2+ alcohols, and CO2 were similar to those at the other temperatures. The gradient for the selectivity curve for hydrocarbons decreased with temperature increased from 260°C to 280°C, and thus, at the even higher temperature of 300°C, the formation of hydrocarbons was more favorable. Therefore, at 300°C, this trend was different from the other temperatures. 3.2.4 Effect of activation methods The effects of the activation methods on a K005Co0620MoCe catalyst were investigated under the following conditions: H2/CO ratio of 2.0, 5.0MPa, and GHSV of 5000h−1. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . The ordering trends for conversion and for almost all the selectivities were similar to the respective temperatures within a range of 260–300°C. Of the three activating methods, the CO conversion and selectivity for C2+ alcohols were the highest and the selectivity for hydrocarbons was the lowest for the sulfided sample. In contrast, the CO conversion and selectivity for C2+ alcohols were the lowest and the selectivity for hydrocarbons was the highest for the reduced samples. The selectivities for C2+ alcohols and hydrocarbons were moderate for the presulfided and reduced samples. Among the three activation methods, the selectivity for C2+ alcohols and CO conversion decreased in the following order: sulfided>presulfided+reduced>reduced, whereas the selectivity for hydrocarbons decreased in the reverse order. The methanol selectivity decreased in the following order: reduce=presulfided+reduced>sulfided catalyst, except for at 260°C. There was little difference among the activation methods with regard to the selectivity for methanol at 260°C. The CO2 selectivity decreased in the following order: sulfided>reduced≧presulfided+reduced catalyst. Therefore, the formation of C2+ alcohols over the sulfided catalyst was more favorable than that over the reduced or presulfided+reduced catalyst."
9,Discussion,"Among the silica, ceria, and alumina supports, ceria supports showed the most favorable results, and they suppressed the formation of CO2 (Table 5). It has been suggested that ceria can suppress CO2 through storing a large amount of oxygen (high oxygen-storage capacity (OSC). Ceria can also serve as a support for catalysts in exhaust-gas treatment and steam reforming reactions, and it is known as a strong reducing agent [15,16]. A mechanism of adsorbed CO species on active sites on a ceria-supported catalyst is shown in Scheme 1 . It has been proposed that CO2 is formed via the reaction of the non-dissociatively adsorbed CO* species (or CO into feed gas) with O* species derived from dissociatively adsorbed C–O species [7,18,38]. However, the ceria support could accept and store oxygen molecules or dissociated oxygen species derived from dissociative C–O adsorption via transformation from the Ce2O3 (Ce3+) phase to the CeO2 (Ce4+) phase. Thus, it is possible that the ceria support suppressed the formation of CO2 in CO hydrogenation, as shown in Scheme 1. This idea is consistent with the fact that the ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ decreased when the sulfided sample was reduced, as shown in Table 3, indicating that the ceria readily transformed from CeO2 to Ce2O3. Ce2O3 was recovered to CeO2 through the reaction of easily and dissociatively adsorbed H* species with Ce2O3. Among group VI metals, the Mo-based catalyst favored the formation of C2+ alcohols, as noted in Section 3.2.1, and the order of STY for C2+ alcohols was Mo>W>Cr. The mixed metal sulfide phase, such as the so-called Co–Mo–S phase, was reported to be formed over sulfided Co–Mo catalysts, and it significantly improved the catalytic performances for hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation reactions [12]. The Cr-based catalyst resists forming mixed metal sulfide phases, namely Co–Mo–S and Co–W–S phases, compared to the Mo or W-based catalysts [39]. The sulfidation of the W-based catalysts is more difficult than that for the Mo-based catalysts because the tungstensulfur bond strength was slightly weaker than the molybdenumsulfur bond strength [12,40]. It was also reported that a considerable amount of W was present in the oxidic form after sulfidation at 673K [41,42]. In that case, the formation of active sites on mixed-metal phases such as the Co–W–S phase on Co-doped WS2 catalysts was more difficult than that on Co-doped MoS2 catalysts. Therefore, the easiness of forming mixed-metal sulfide phases among group VI metals decreased in the following order: Mo>W>Cr. This sequence was identical to that of the selectivity for C2+ alcohols. The Co–Mo–S or Co–W–S phase played an important role in the formation of C2+ alcohols. In the present study, as shown in Table 4, the reaction products of the Mo-based catalysts prepared were mainly composed of linear hydrocarbons and linear C1–4 alcohols. However, a small amount of non-linear alcohols such as 2-propanol and 2-butanol were also produced. Fujimoto et al. reported that the reaction products using the MoS2-based catalysts, which were classified into the catalysts for F–T synthesis, were mainly composed of linear C1–4 alcohols. They proposed the synthesis in branched alcohols, i.e., alcohol condensation reaction, as well as the synthesis in linear alcohols, may occur over the Mo-based catalysts simultaneously [43,44]. Thereby, alcohol condensation as well as F–T synthesis may also happen during the alcohol synthesis over the Mo-based catalysts prepared in this study. While the optimum loading amount of Mo was 15%, as shown in Fig. 5, CO conversion was depressed at a Mo load of 20%. Increases in the loading amount of metal generally lead to a large number of active sites. However, the BET surface area decreased from 73m2/g to 48m2/g, when the Mo load was increased from 15% to 20%, as shown in Table 1. It was thought that the dispersion and number of active sites of supported metals on the catalyst would be lower at a 20% load than at a 15% load. As also mentioned for the H2-TPR analyses, the reduction peak for Mo6+ to Mo4+ species was shifted to high temperature with increasing Mo load, as shown in Fig. 2, indicating the formation of a bulk MoO3 phase that was difficult to reduce on the catalysts. Regarding the activation methods, the sulfided K005Co0620MoCe catalyst showed superior performance for the synthesis of C2+ alcohols to that of the presulfided+reduced catalyst. The H2-TPR measurements on the presulfided+reduced catalyst indicated that the amounts of thiol groups, the MoS phase, and the CoMoS phases were decreased, compared to the sulfided catalyst. Moreover, as noted above, XPS analysis showed that the outer CoMoS phase on the sulfided catalyst was larger than that on the presulfided+reduced catalyst. Consequently, the thiol groups, the MoS phase, and the CoMoS phase would produce a catalyst selective for C2+ alcohols."
10,Conclusions,"The effects of ceria, group VI metals, loading amount of Mo, and activation methods on C2+ alcohol synthesis were investigated in this study. The selectivity for C2+ alcohols and the CO conversion with a ceria-supported catalyst were 47% and 3.2%, respectively. Ceria supports showed the best performance among silica, ceria, and alumina supports. The formation of CO2 was suppressed using ceria, which is capable of storing oxygen species. Among the group VI metals investigated, the Mo-based catalyst favored the formation of C2+ alcohols, and the order of STY for C2+ alcohols was Mo>W>Cr. This trend was consistent with the easiness of forming mixed-metal sulfide phases among group VI metals. Moreover, for group VI metals, the Co–Mo–S phase played an important role in the formation of C2+ alcohols. With Mo loads ranging from 11 to 20%, at Mo loads of more than 15%, C2+ alcohol selectivity stayed almost constant at 38%, whereas the CO conversion at Mo loads of 20% dropped to 7.7% at 260°C. Decreasing BET surface area and the formation of bulk MoO3 on the catalysts indicated that dispersion and sites of the active metals were decreased. Regarding the activation methods, the sulfided K005Co0620MoCe catalyst favored the selectivity for C2+ alcohols. H2-TPR and XPS analyses showed that the MoS phase, thiol groups, and the Co–Mo–S phase would enhance catalyst selectivity for C2+ alcohols."
