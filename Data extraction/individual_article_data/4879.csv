0,Introduction,"Environmentally friendly, sustainable future energy systems can be supported by Power-to-X approaches. By efficient conversion and storage of electrical energy into chemical energy, the intermittent generation of renewable energy and the mismatch with energy demand can be overcome [1]. One promising approach is electrochemical synthesis, i.e. the formation of chemical compounds by electrolysis [2–4]. The field of electrochemical synthesis is currently growing rapidly because renewable electricity can be harvested to produce highly efficient fuels or fine, added-value chemicals. Apart from classical organic electrosynthesis in non-aqueous media, aqueous hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions become increasingly important [5–7]. Electrochemical reactions can form a variety of products in both liquid and gas phase [8]. The distribution of products, related to the partial rates of their formation, is highly dependent on the electrode material and potential. Determining the impact of these parameters on the product distribution is necessary to understand the mechanism of the reaction and highlight the pathways towards desired products. The traditional techniques to acquire such relationships involve periodic sample fractionation, collection, and determination during long-term electrolysis (galvanostatic or potentiostatic). Liquid products are typically determined with chromatographic or spectrometric methods, nuclear magnetic resonance etc, whereas gaseous products are often determined with online gas chromatography [8–12]. These approaches are ideal for the quantitative determination of production rates, selectivities, or faradaic efficiencies (FEs). However, they are time-consuming, which impedes the investigation of many materials at different conditions (e.g. potentials, electrolytes). Automation of such techniques can reduce the workload, however temporal resolution is still limited so that transient processes occurring under dynamic conditions cannot be captured, and short-lived or very volatile products may be neglected. To address the above, time- and potential-resolved product analysis is needed to accelerate the determination of selectivity as a function of the potential or the electrode material and to capture transient events at dynamic interfaces. The immediate determination of products at solid-liquid interfaces after formation has been a long-standing challenge for electrochemists [13]. The characterization of gaseous products in real time was enabled previously with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and its further variations [13–17], which is a modified version of membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) [18,19]. In such techniques, the membrane is permeable to ambient gases whereas in the case of liquid products, the diffusion across the membrane is highly dependent on the vapor pressure of the analyte. The hard ionization (Electron impact (EI)) used in DEMS and the associated fragmentation leads to intricate spectra when various products are formed [16]. In that case, the interpretation of spectra is challenging and assigning a mass signal to a compound requires the previous knowledge of the products formed and their contribution to certain fragments. The determination of low volatile liquid compounds that were formed during a potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement was enabled by sample collection near the electrode and offline analysis with chromatographic methods, with a time resolution of 1 min [20,21]. To monitor the formation of such products directly during an electrochemical reaction, Ager and co-workers used selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) [22,23]. Despite the advantages of detecting the products without the need of periodic collection, the restrictions with using SIFT-MS are related to the limited mass resolution of the quadrupole mass analyzer and the low temporal resolution in case of non-targeted analysis. We recently developed a new method for the determination of gaseous and liquid products of electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical real-time mass spectrometry (EC-RTMS). In a first publication, we characterized a wide range of products of the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide on metallic and anodized copper, in real time [24]. Here, we study the electrochemical oxidation of the three primary C1-C3 alcohols, which can be used as the anode reactions in direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) [25]. In particular, using EC-RTMS, we track the reaction products for the oxidation of methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) and 1-propanol (1-PrOH) on platinum during potential sweep measurements. Details on the interpretation of mass signals with EC-RTMS and the assignment to compounds are discussed."
1,Methodology and material,
2,Electrochemical measurements,"2.1 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical measurements were performed with a scanning flow cell (SFC) (Scheme 1 A) [26]. The deaerated electrolyte was supplied to the SFC by the inlet channel (3 mm diameter) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1. The SFC was modified for continuous electrolyte collection (flow rate: 0.4 mL min−1) using a glass capillary (ID 530 μm, OD 680 μm) positioned at the bottom of the cell, i.e. on top of the working electrode. A silicon sealing with a thickness of 200 μm was used in between the cell and the working electrode to prevent electrolyte leakage. The working electrode was pressed against the cell, and the applied force (controlled by a force sensor) determined the effective thickness of the sealing, which was then lower than the nominal thickness of 200 μm. The effective sealing thickness is decisive for the distance between the collection point and the working electrode, and therefore it can affect the mass transport and the collection efficiency. The counter electrode (Pt wire, Mateck, Jülich, Germany), was positioned at the waste channel (flow rate: 0.1 mL min−1) to avoid any interference on product determination from reactions occurring at the counter electrode. The reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl (BASi®, Indiana, USA), side-inserted close to the working electrode. The reference was calibrated versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) beforehand, by measuring the open circuit potential in the alcohol-free, H2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. All potentials throughout the manuscript are expressed versus the RHE. All electrochemical experiments were carried out with a Gamry Reference 600 (Gamry, Pennsylvania, USA) potentiostat-galvanostat. The electrolytes were prepared with ultrapure water (Elga PureLab Plus, 18.2 MΩ cm, TOC < 3 ppb, Celle, Germany), HClO4 (Merck, Suprapur®), and the appropriate alcohol (Merck, EMSURE®). Before each experiment, the electrolyte was degassed with Argon for 10 min and the gas flow was maintained in the electrolyte reservoir during the measurement. The ohmic resistance was determined prior to the experiment with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and compensated (90%) with positive feedback."
3,EC- RTMS,"2.2 EC- RTMS EC-RTMS is depicted in Scheme 1. The methodology is based on the integration of two independent mass spectrometry techniques for the analysis of gas and liquid products. After collection of the electrolyte near the electrode surface, the electrolyte enters a homemade degasser equipped with a hydrophobic Teflon membrane where the gaseous products are extracted from the liquid phase due to a pressure difference, and determined via Electron impact quadrupole mass spectrometry (EI-QMS) (see 2.2.1 for more details). The remaining electrolyte is directed further to a direct analysis in real time - time of flight mass spectrometer (DART-TOF-MS) with a modified inlet as described previously [24], which allows the characterization of liquid products independent of their vapor pressure (see 2.2.2. for more details). The assignment of detected masses to certain products in the gaseous or liquid phase is described in Table S1. 2.2.1 Gas analysis The gaseous products were determined by a MAX 300 LG membrane inlet mass spectrometer (Extrel, Pennsylvania, USA). The original inlet membrane of the instrument was replaced by a degasser, home-constructed using Teflon® AF 2400 non-porous membrane tubing (Biogeneral, California, USA) with 0.024″ ID and 0.032” OD [27]. The gaseous products were extracted and transferred via a stainless steel line by vacuum to the inlet of the instrument, where the molecules were ionized with an EI ion source with energy of 70 eV. Further, the generated ions were separated with a quadrupole mass analyzer and determined by a secondary electron multiplier (SEM) detector and Faraday cup. All gaseous products were analyzed by using the SEM detector except for the experiments of MeOH oxidation where the Faraday cup detector was used for the determination of CO2 due to the large amount of CO2 formed. The operating pressure in all cases was around 1 × 10−6 Torr. 2.2.2 Liquid analysis The analysis of liquids was based on DART-TOF-MS [28]. Whereas in conventional DART-TOF-MS the ionization occurs at the open space between the ion source and the inlet of the mass spectrometer, here the inlet was modified to better control the ionization conditions and thereby enable the analysis of liquids semi-quantitatively, in a continuous fashion. The degassed electrolyte with a flowrate of 0.4 mL min−1 was nebulized in a concentric PTFE nebulizer (PFA-ST, PerkinElmer) using argon as the nebulizing gas (flow rate 0.3 L min−1) to form a spray. A cyclonic spray chamber (for NexION 300/350, PerkinElmer) was used to remove large condensed electrolyte droplets to waste, while a portion of fine mist was pushed by a positive pressure to the inlet of the mass spectrometer. The stream of the sample vapor was then directed in the zone between the DART-SVP ionization source (IonSense, Saugus, MA) and the inlet of the JMS-T100LP AccuTOF LC-plus 4G mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with a time-of-flight mass analyzer with resolving power of ≥10,000 (measured at nominal m/z = 609 according to FWHM definition). The ion source was operated with helium (Air Liquide, Grade 4.7) with flow rate of 4.0 L min−1. The DART internal heater was set at 300 °C. The voltage of the orifice 1 was set to 50, 60, 30 V for the experiments with MeOH, EtOH and 1-PrOH, respectively. The recording interval frequency was one spectrum per second."
4,Preparation and characterization of nanoporous platinum electrodes,"2.3 Preparation and characterization of nanoporous platinum electrodes Chemicals for the material preparation were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, ABCR, Strem or VWR and used as received. Nanoporous Pt electrodes were prepared with atomic layer deposition (ALD), according to previously published work on nanoporous thin film electrodes [29,30]. A highly ordered array of anodic Al2O3 pores (diameter D ≈ 380 nm and length L ≈ 18 μm) served as the template. One side of the pore extremities was closed with a several micrometer thick electrical nickel contact. The other side of the template was coated with platinum using ALD (thickness: 13 nm) in a commercial Gemstar-6 XT ALD reactor from Arradiance. ALD was carried out at 220 °C with trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum(IV) (MeCpPtMe3, kept at 50 °C) and ozone. In a final step, the nanoporous Pt samples were laser-cut with a GCC LaserPro Spirit LS Laser into circular pieces and glued with the nickel contact on small copper plates using double-sided conductive copper foil. The sample area exposed to the electrolyte was defined by a chemically resistant and electrically insulating polyamide (Kapton) adhesive tape featuring a laser-cut circular window of 2.0 mm diameter (macroscopically defined sample area A = 0.031 cm2). Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were taken using a Zeiss GeminiSEM 500 mounted with an in-lens detector and a field emission cathode. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed with a JEOL JSM 6400 PC instrument equipped with a LaB6 cathode and a silicon drift detector. The crystal structure was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer in reflection mode with CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) and a LynxEye XE-T detector."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the nanoporous platinum electrode,"3.1 Characterization of the nanoporous platinum electrode Nanoporous platinum prepared by ALD (Pt-ALD) was preferred in this study to enhance the surface area and thus the signal in EC-RTMS. The morphology of the Pt-ALD was characterized with SEM (Figure S1a and b). EDX analysis proves the presence of Pt besides the expected elements Al, O and Ni of the template and electrical contact (Figure S1c). The chemical identity of the layer is provided XRD, which reveals prominent peaks at 39.6°, 46.2° and 67.4°, attributable to crystalline and metallic platinum (Figure S1d, Crystallographic Open Database COD 1011107)."
7,Choice of the experimental protocol,"3.2 Choice of the experimental protocol The electrochemical oxidation of C1-C3 alcohols on platinum is known to be accompanied with the adsorption of reaction intermediates, leading to surface deactivation [31–34]. To obtain reproducible measurements during a slow potential scan, ten cycles from 0 to +1.05 VRHE with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 preceded the slow scan (from 0 to +1.2 VRHE with 1 mV s−1). In between the two potentiodynamic measurements, a constant potential of 0 VRHE was applied for 3 min to make sure that the background signal is recorded for all masses. The effectiveness of this protocol is demonstrated in Figure S2 for the oxidation of EtOH as an example. The recorded mass spectrometric cyclic voltammograms (MSCV) were reproducible for three consecutive slow scans for all determined products (full interpretation of the recorded signals is provided below)."
8,MeOH oxidation,"3.3 MeOH oxidation Fig. 1 shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) on Pt-ALD in a 0.1 M HClO4 + 0.2 MeOH solution, with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 and the corresponding MSCVs for the compounds that were detected, i.e. CO2 (m/z = 44) and methyl formate (m/z = 61.0–61.1). These are known products from previous steady-state electrolysis studies of MeOH oxidation on platinum in acidic solutions, together with formaldehyde and formic acid, which will be discussed further below [35,36]. During the positive-going scan, the onset of the oxidation current is observed at +0.55 VRHE, where the mass signals for CO2 and methyl formate also increase. The maximum reaction rate is observed at ca. +0.9 VRHE and then the current as well as the formation rate of carbon dioxide and methyl formate decrease as a result of platinum oxide formation. During the negative-going scan, the reduction of the platinum oxide below +1.0 VRHE allows the reaction to occur again and the same behavior is observed for either the current or the mass signals as for the positive-going scan. The mechanism of ionization with DART in positive mode is the proton transfer reaction, described in the general case as follows: (1) ( H 2 O ) n H + + R ⇄ RH + + ( H 2 O ) n Where R is the analyte to be detected (in that case, the liquid product of the electrochemical reaction) and (H2O)n is the water cluster. Protonated water (n = 1) or water clusters (n > 1) are the products of the Penning ionization reaction of helium in the triplet state (He(23 S)) with water molecules near the ion source region [28]. During aqueous electrochemical experiments in the EC-RTMS configuration, water is supplied to the ionization zone from the electrolyte vapor that has been formed at the nebulizer. The proton transfer reaction is favored if the proton affinity (PA) of the analyte R is higher than that of the proton donor. The PA for a single water molecule is 690 ± 4 kJ mol−1 whereas for the water dimer it is 808 ± 6 kJ mol−1 [37]; therefore, the proton transfer reaction will be thermodynamically favored when protonated water (n = 1) is in excess instead of the water dimer (n = 2). The prevalence of protonated water or water dimers, H3O+ or (H2O)2H+, depends on the sample introduction and ionization conditions. If the PA of the educt is higher than that of the dominant water species (water or water dimer), the educt will be in the protonated form in the ionization region and will in turn protonate the reaction products. Since the probability for ionization of an analyte depends on the difference of its PA from the PA of the proton donor, the ionization of a product will be less probable when ionization is educt-mediated. This will eventually lead to higher detection limits (depending on the concentration and the PA of the educt). For example, MeOH has higher PA than water (754.3 kJ mol−1 versus 690 ± 4 kJ mol−1) [38] and together with its concentration in our experiments (0.2 M), there will be an abundance of protonated MeOH in the ionization region. This will increase the detection limit for formaldehyde, because of the lower PA of the latter compared to MeOH (711 ± 0.4 kJ mol−1 [39]). This is the reason why formaldehyde, which has been reported previously as a product of MeOH oxidation from bulk electrolysis [36], cannot be detected under our conditions. Similarly, the direct detection of formic acid in the protonated form (m/z = 47.0–47.1) is difficult in this electrolyte, because of the lower PA of formic acid (742.0 kJ mol−1) compared to the educt MeOH (754.3 kJ mol−1) [38] which eventually results in a high detection limit. Indeed, in our measurements we did not observe any increase in the signal for m/z = 47.0–47.1. The formation of formic acid, however, is evidenced indirectly by the increase in the signal for m/z = 61.0–61.1, which corresponds to methyl formate. The latter is produced by the homogeneous esterification reaction that takes place between formic acid and the excess of MeOH. To prove this statement, in a control experiment we fed the modified inlet of the DART-TOF-MS with the same solution (0.2 M MeOH in 0.1 M HClO4) to record the background signal, and then the solution was spiked with formic acid which resulted in an increase of the m/z = 61.0–61.1. Therefore, we conclude that the original product of MeOH is formic acid, detected indirectly as methyl formate, while the remaining formic acid that did not react to methyl formate cannot be observed at m/z = 47.0–47.1 due to its high detection limit in the MeOH-containing solution. Due to the matrix-dependent competition between species for ionization as described above, also the quantification of the recorded signals under identical instrument conditions depends strongly on the electrolyte matrix. In addition, the collection efficiency near the electrode also affects quantitatively the recorded intensities. The above make the construction of calibration curves and thereby the quantification rather time-consuming and relevant only for a given electrolyte matrix and experimental conditions. Therefore, even though it is feasible, the quantification with EC-RTMS is currently beyond our scope. These results are in agreement with previous investigations with DEMS, where CO2 and methyl formate were detected in the same potential region as in Fig. 1b and c, while formic acid and formaldehyde could not be detected directly due to the limited membrane permeability to low vapor pressure liquid products [40–42]. Apart from steady-state electrolysis measurements, the detection of formic acid and formaldehyde during a potential scan was previously achieved only by intermittently injecting online-derivatized electrolyte into the inlet of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) [43]."
9,EtOH oxidation,"3.4 EtOH oxidation The oxidation of EtOH on Pt-ALD was studied with a scan of 1 mV s−1 in a 0.1 M HClO4 + 0.2 M EtOH solution. Fig. 2 shows the recorded CV and the corresponding MSCVs for the detected compounds, CO2 (m/z = 22 and 44) and methane (m/z = 15) as gaseous products, and acetaldehyde (m/z = 45.0–45.1), acetic acid (m/z = 61.0–61.1) and ethyl acetate (m/z = 89.0–89.1) as liquid products. The oxidation current increases at ca. +0.5 VRHE, and the products detected are CO2 (m/z = 22 and 44), acetaldehyde (m/z = 45.0–45.1), acetic acid (m/z = 61.0–61.1) and ethyl acetate (m/z = 89.0–89.1). The product characterization here matches with former DEMS investigations, which reported the detection of CO2, acetaldehyde and methane during the ethanol electrooxidation on Pt at the same potentials as in Fig. 2 [44,45]. Comparing the formation rates of each product in the positive- and negative-scan, the rate for CO2 was higher in the positive direction, while the formation of the other products was favored in the reverse sweep. Iwasita and Pastor showed that the oxidative stripping of EtOH in this potential region leads to the formation of CO2 as the only bulk product so they concluded that CO2 is produced by ethanol-derived adsorbates that have been adsorbed at lower potentials [46]. The exact nature of the ethanol-derived adsorbates has been a subject of previous thorough studies [46–48]. The oxidative removal of these adsorbed species releases surface sites that carry out the continuous (bulk) oxidation of EtOH to acetaldehyde and acetic acid. Similar to methyl formate, we attribute the formation of ethyl acetate here to the homogeneous reaction between EtOH and the produced acetic acid, also indicated by the identical shapes for m/z = 61.0–61.1 and 89.0–89.1. However, contrary to formic acid, the detection of acetic acid is possible in the alcohol-containing solution because its PA is higher than any of the potential proton donors (783.7 kJ mol−1 for acetic acid, versus 691.0 kJ mol−1 for water and 776.4 kJ mol−1 for EtOH [38]). The formation rate of all products is maximized at +0.8 VRHE and nearly stops at more positive potentials, except for acetaldehyde that still increases until +0.9 VRHE. Despite a decrease at higher potentials, where competition with the platinum oxide formation occurs, the rate of acetaldehyde formation remains significant up to +1.2 VRHE. Moreover, the formation rate of acetic acid (and ethyl acetate) increases again at potentials higher than +1.0 VRHE. By reversing the direction of the potential sweep, the rate for acetaldehyde formation increases at +1.0 VRHE, while acetic acid/ethyl acetate also form. The reaction yields again CO2 at ca. +0.9 VRHE though with overall lower rates compared to the forward scan. This may imply that some ethanol-derived adsorbates did not react in the positive-going scan. Interestingly, a sharp increase in the formation rate of acetic acid and ethyl acetate is observed (maximum at +0.6 VRHE). This indicates that the oxidation of EtOH to acetic acid is favored at this potential range, but it is strongly inhibited in the positive-going scan due to the presence of ethanol-derived adsorbates that need to be oxidized to CO2 and then open the pathway to acetic acid. By decreasing the potential further, the formation rate of all products decreases until ca. +0.4 VRHE where the reaction stops. The detection of ethyl acetate in Fig. 2g is much more pronounced in the negative direction of the scan compared to the positive direction. Previously, ethyl acetate was detected by DEMS in solutions of high ethanol concentration but only in the negative direction of the scan [45]. This is related to the higher production rate of ethyl acetate in the negative scan, which is then sufficient to overcome the detection limit in DEMS. Apart from the above-mentioned products, methane formation (m/z = 15) was detected in both directions of the scan. Methane was previously reported in this potential region in both sweep directions, in stripping experiments where the platinum electrode was previously modified with ethanol-derived adsorbates at +0.35 V [32,46,49]. The formation of methane was interpreted as the result of the reduction of adsorbed *CH3 or *CH3-containing (e.g. acetyl, *CH3CO) species [46]. The fact that methane is detected in both directions is attributed to the slow kinetics of the reaction, which does not lead to complete removal of the adsorbed educt during the negative-going scan, as also suggested by Iwasita and Pastor [46]. Note that the voltammogram shown in Fig. 2 was recorded after fast cycles in the same potential region, according to the protocol in section 3.2. From the reference spectrum of acetaldehyde, it is known that hard ionization with EI results in fragments with m/z = 44, 29 and 15 [50]. Therefore, if the membrane used for the gas-liquid separation is permeable to acetaldehyde, the latter may contribute to these mass signals, as it has been already reported in previous DEMS studies that utilize a porous Teflon membrane [51]. The high permeability of the Teflon AF membrane used in EC-RTMS for permanent gases and the low permeability for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), makes the interpretation of EI-QMS spectra simpler, as fragments of VOCs have here little contribution to the recorded masses. This is evident by the comparison of the acetaldehyde signal as determined by DART-TOF-MS at m/z = 45.0–45.1, with the signals for m/z = 15, 29 and 44 at the EI-QMS (see Figure S3). In particular, the shape of the rate of acetaldehyde formation is not similar with that of m/z = 15 and 44, which should be the case if these were fragments of acetaldehyde, while the m/z = 29 changes marginally during the potential scan. The above are additionally supported by the characteristic similarity between the signals for m/z = 22 and 44 in Fig. 2, indicating that the m/z = 22 originates from the fragmentation of the parent ion at m/z = 44 and the latter is assigned to CO2 +·. Similarly, ethyl acetate could contribute to the m/z = 15 [45], however again the comparison between the m/z = 89.0–89.1 in DART-TOF-MS and m/z = 15 in EI-QMS indicates that the membrane is not permeable to ethyl acetate either. Therefore, the m/z = 15 and 44 were attributed to methane and carbon dioxide respectively."
10,1-PrOH oxidation,"3.5 1-PrOH oxidation The CVs and corresponding MSCVs for the oxidation of 1-PrOH on Pt-ALD are shown in Fig. 3 . In particular, the MSCVs are shown for carbon dioxide (m/z = 44 and 22), methane (m/z = 15), ethane (m/z = 30) as gaseous products, and propionaldehyde (m/z = 59.0–59.1), propionic acid (m/z = 75.0–75.1) and propyl propionate (m/z = 117.0–117.2) as liquid products. 1-PrOH oxidation occurs at potentials above +0.5 VRHE. The rate of carbon dioxide formation is maximized at ca. +0.8 VRHE in both directions of the scan. The similarity in the shape of m/z = 44 with the m/z = 22, which is a unique CO2 fragment, indicates that the assignment of m/z = 44 to CO2 is correct. The formation of CO2 has been attributed to the oxidation of surface-adsorbed 1-PrOH-derived species, adsorbed already at a lower potential (ca. +0.35 VRHE) [52,53]. The shape of m/z = 59.0–59.1 (propionaldehyde) is similar with that of acetaldehyde during 1-PrOH oxidation, even thought the formation rate slightly increases in the negative-going scan (maximum at +0.75 VRHE) probably related to a stronger inhibition from propanol-compared to ethanol-derived adsorbates in the aldehyde formation in the positive-going scan. Propionic acid and propyl propionate also form, with a significant increase of the rate at ca. +0.55 VRHE during the negative-going scan. The fact that the formation of propionaldehyde and propionic acid is enhanced in the reverse scan, is likely related to the increased surface availability after the oxidative removal of 1-PrOH-derived adsorbates in the positive-going scan [52,53], which then favors the formation of bulk oxidation products. Similar to MeOH and EtOH oxidation, the propyl propionate during 1-PrOH oxidation results from the reaction between the reactant and the formed propionic acid, as additionally indicated by the characteristic similarity between the m/z = 75.0–75.1 and 117.0–117.2. The above described products match with previous works on the 1-PrOH oxidation on platinum [54]. Moreover, an increase in m/z = 30, attributable to ethane, is observed at potentials below +0.4 VRHE in both directions of the scan. Ethane formation in this region has been previously attributed to the hydrogenation of 1-PrOH-derived species [53]. The 1-PrOH-derived adsorbates are already present at the surface in the positive-going scan, because of the fast cycles that precede the sweep shown in Fig. 3 (see the protocol description in section 3.2). Ethane can contribute to m/z = 15 due to fragmentation; for example, the signal for the latter slightly increases at ca. +0.3 VRHE in the forward scan, which is explained by the abundance ethane at this m/z value [50]. However, the more significant increase of m/z = 15 in the backward scan at ca. +0.1 VRHE exceeds the abundance of the ethane fragment. This increase is attributed to the formation of methane, as described already previously [53]. Our results here corroborate with previous DEMS investigations, where propionaldehyde, CO2, ethane and methane were reported as products of the electrooxidation of 1-PrOH on platinum, at the same potentials as shown in Fig. 3 [53,54]."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, we characterize the products of the electrochemical oxidation of methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol on platinum in real time with EC-RTMS and in turn we showcase some important characteristics of this new method. The oxidation of any of the three alcohols forms carbon dioxide, as well as the corresponding organic acid (formic, acetic or propionic) and aldehyde (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, or propionaldehyde). Among these products, the formation of formaldehyde was not observed, likely due to its high detection limit when methanol is present. Formic acid was not detected directly for the same reason, but its formation is evidenced by the detection of methyl formate. For all three alcohols, the formed organic acid reacts in solution with the alcohol educt, yielding the corresponding ester. Moreover, the formation of CO2 occurs via the oxidation of pre-adsorbed alcohol species; their oxidative stripping is necessary in order to facilitate the formation of the organic acids and aldehydes. Overall, the article highlights the simple assignment of mass signals to compounds with EC-RTMS compared to traditional mass spectrometry methods. This is achieved for two reasons: (i) the ionization used for liquid analysis is rather soft, and (ii) the permeability of the membrane used for gas-liquid separation towards volatile organic compounds is low, thus fragmentation of volatiles due to hard electron ionization is minimal. Quantification of the detected products is in principle possible, but it is currently out of our scope as the calibration factors are matrix-dependent which renders quantification a tedious task. EC-RTMS is expected to push the boundaries of electrochemical synthesis by enabling the quick and real-time characterization of electrochemical reaction products."
