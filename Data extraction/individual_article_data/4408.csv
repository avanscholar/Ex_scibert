0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production from biomass-derived sources has attracted much attention due its high energy efficiency, pollutants-free emission and diverse applications. Moreover, the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier could contribute to sustainable energy production to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel energy sources, which caused serious environmental pollution. Transformation of renewable biomass to H2 rich gas is a promising route for the production of hydrogen. Among the biomass-derived oxygenates, bio-ethanol (i.e. fermented broth) is most attractive for large-scale production of H2, due to its high hydrogen content, non-toxicity, growing availability, renewability and low production cost. Several catalytic processes for hydrogen production from ethanol, i.e. steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX), and oxidative steam reforming (OSR), have been investigated and reported in the literature. Among these, steam reforming is one of the most convenient route for hydrogen production from bio-ethanol, as it gives highest hydrogen yield. On the other hand, oxidative steam reforming of ethanol (OSRE), being a combination of the endothermic steam reforming and the exothermic partial oxidation reactions, possesses a reasonable balance between the energy requirement and hydrogen yield. Moreover, the presence of oxygen in the feed also facilitates the removal of carbon deposits, which is one of the major causes of catalysts deactivation during reforming process [1–5]. Bio-ethanol, which contains ∼20vol% of ethanol with water as major components, can be obtained from biomass by fermentation process. Mainly two types of bio-ethanol exist: 1st generation bio-ethanol, which is produced from fermentation of sugar cane, corn and sugar beets while 2nd generation bio-ethanol is obtained from wood, household waste and wheat straw [2]. Both of them contain different types of organic impurities, which play an essential role in the catalyst deactivation. Therefore, it is utmost important to remove these impurities from bio-ethanol to reduce the catalyst deactivation. However, the purification process consumes almost 3/4 of energy used in bio-ethanol preparation process [2,3,6]. Therefore, use of crude bio-ethanol as feedstock in steam reforming will minimize the heat requirement for the energy intensive distillation process. Only few literatures are available on the reforming of crude bio-ethanol. Application of steam reforming processes to industrial scale still needs to overcome some challenges associated during the conversion process. Deactivation of catalysts is the main challenge for steam reforming reaction [7]. One reason leading to deactivation is the carbon deposition caused by the decomposition and dehydration of ethanol, the decomposition of methane, and the Boudouard reaction of CO. The other reason is the result from sintering of catalyst particles, as these processes are being endothermic which proceed generally at high temperature [8,9]. Therefore, it is essential to overcome the above-mentioned challenges for the development of economical and stable commercial catalysts, which are able to demonstrate higher H2 yield at maximum possible conversion with better selectivity of the products. Selection of the appropriate metal and support influence the deactivation behavior of the catalyst, as nature of the support is essential for product selectivity and life of the catalyst. Acidic supports, such as Al2O3 are known to deactivate catalyst by favoring ethanol dehydration which leads to coke formation [10], while basic supports such as MgO, ZnO can inhibit carbon deposition by favoring ethanol dehydrogenation reaction [11]. Reducible oxides such as CeO2, ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide possesses potential applications as catalyst support due to their high oxygen storage-release capacity and thermal and mechanical stability [12–16]. The steam reforming of ethanol has been investigated over a wide variety of supported noble and transition metal catalysts in the literature. Transition metals like Ni, Co, Cu, etc., have been reported to exhibit excellent performance on steam reforming of ethanol due to their high activity towards C–C bond cleavage, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reaction activity, and low cost, while fast deactivation is the main drawback of these metals [17–24]. Noble metals such as, Rh, Ir, Pt, Ru, Pd have been investigated to have high activity in steam reforming process due to their strong C–C cleavage capability, but high cost limits their application on large scale [25–33]. However, the main challenge in steam reforming reaction is the formation of carbonaceous species. It is also reported that supported monometallic catalysts can be improved by adding another metal to overcome the deactivation [34–37]. Fierro et al. [19] and Kugai et al. [38] modified Ni/Al2O3 catalyst by doping metals such as Fe, Cu, Zn or Rh. These bimetallic catalysts exhibited higher activity compared to monometallic catalyst during SRE with minimizing carbon formation due to the synergetic effects of both the metal [36,39]. Several studies have also been carried out for OSRE over supported Ni, Cu, Ir, Rh and Ru catalysts. Akdim et al. [40] studied ethanol OSR over Ni-Cu/SiO2, Rh/Al2O3 and Ir/CeO2 catalysts and revealed that the catalytic activity is in the order of Ni<Rh<Ir. Srisiriwat et al. [12] observed that addition of promoters (CeO2, ZrO2 and CeO2-ZrO2) improved the dispersion of Ni by promoting interaction between support and promoters. Kugai et al. [38,41] revealed that OSRE reaction is more efficient over Ni-Rh/CeO2 catalysts for producing H2 with low selectivity undesired by-products at relatively lower temperature than that of SRE. Lima et al. [26] compared SR and OSR of ethanol using Pt/CeZrO2 and concluded that in presence of oxygen, deactivation rate was greatly reduced but product selectivity's were also reduced. Compared to SRE, both activity and selectivity in the OSRE process is lower, but it reduced the carbon formation on the catalyst [42,43]. In the present study, the catalytic oxidative and non-oxidative steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol for hydrogen production was investigated in a tubular fixed bed reaction system over 30wt.%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1wt.%Rh-30wt.%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. 1wt.%Rh was doped as a promoter on Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst with the aim to improve the catalytic performance and suppress carbonaceous deposition on catalyst. The catalysts were characterized by various characterization techniques viz. N2 adsorption desorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, thermo gravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Ethanol conversion, hydrogen yield and product distribution were investigated for the steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol with or without oxygen at 600°C and space time of 9.17kgcat h/kgmol[EtOH]) at atmospheric pressure. The used catalysts were also analysed by various techniques to identify the nature of carbonaceous species deposited, which causes catalyst deactivation during the steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol. Limited data are available in the literature on these studies."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Materials Nickel nitrate hexahydrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O] supplied by Merck Specialities Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India and Rhodium (III) trichloride [RhCl3·xH2O] supplied by Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India were used as nickel and Rh precursors respectively. Cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate [Ce(NO3)3·6H2O], and Zirconyl nitrate hydrate [ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O] supplied by Central Drug House Pvt. Ltd., were used as precursors for ceria and zirconium, respectively. Crude bio-ethanol (i.e. fermented broth) used for this work was obtained from Spectrum Technologies Limited, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. 2.1.2 Methods The CeO2-ZrO2 support (1:1 (w/w) CeO2/ZrO2) was prepared by using co-precipitation method. For the preparation of Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, 30wt% Ni was impregnated on CeO2-ZrO2 using wetness impregnation method. The noble metal (Rh-1wt%) was added subsequently by using wetness incipient method. The details catalysts preparation methods are described elsewhere [44]."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization The catalysts were characterized by standard methods of surface area analysis using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at 77K after degassing samples below 10−3 torr at 473K for 4h. The pore volume was estimated from the amount adsorbed at a relative pressure of about 0.95. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained with Shimadzu diffractometer using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å) with a scanning angle (2θ) of 10–90°, scanning speed of 1°/min operated at 40kV voltage and 15mA current. The average crystallite sizes (D, nm) of NiO for each catalyst were determined using the Scherrer equation. The crystalline phases were identified by comparing with standard JCPDS data. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) or temperature programmed hydrogenation (TPH) was performed on a Chemisorb 2720 (Micromeritics) instrument using 50–100mg of calcined sample. The hydrogen consumption during the reduction/hydrogenation process was continuously monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed with TGA-Q600 instrument (supplied by TA instruments Waters-LLC, US) with an air flow of 100ml/min from 25 to 900°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. The carbonaceous deposit formed during the steam reforming of ethanol was analysed by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) method. About 50–100mg of used catalyst sample was heated up from room temperature to 800°C at 10°Cmin−1 in a 5% O2 flow diluted in helium. The amount of oxygen consumption during the oxidation process was continuously monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed using RE04 Renishaw Raman Invia Reflex Microscope (at Saskatchewan Structural Science Centre, University of Saskatchewan, Canada) equipped with monochromator coupled to a charge-couple device (CCD) detector. An argon ion laser with 514.5nm wavelength was used as the excitation source. The power was kept at 10mW and the spectra were recorded with 20× objective and 10% laser power to avoid over exposure of the beam on the sample. The instrument was calibrated against the static Raman signal of silicon at 520cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra measurements were obtained using a plane grating monochromator (PGM) beamline having photoemission electron radiation at 160eV and an electron takeoff angle at 90°C at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) in Saskatoon, Canada. Powder samples were mounted on sample stubs with double sided conductive carbon tapes. All the data were collected in transmission mode in the kinetic energy scale of 20–160eV (equivalent binding energy scale of 0–140eV) with a step size of 0.1eV. The obtained peaks were analysed using CasaXPS software package. The morphology of fresh and used catalysts were analysed using a Zeiss EVO 50 scanning electron micrographs (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyser (Bruker-AXS Model-QuanTax200), and SEM images were obtained. The surface morphology and crystallite sizes of fresh and used catalysts were analysed using a TECNAI G2-STWIN high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) operated at 200kV and the images were recorded. Powder samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication and then putting one drop of prepared solution onto 3mm copper grids coated with amorphous carbon film followed by drying in air at room temperature. 2.2.1 X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) The XAS measurements were carried out in fluorescence mode at the hard X-ray micro-analysis (HXMA) (energy range 5–40keV) and spherical grating monochromator (SGM) (energy range 250–2000eV) beamline at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) in Saskatoon, SK, Canada using a high-energy resolution X-ray emission spectrometer and a single photon-counting Lytle detector. The spectra of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at the Ni K edge were obtained in fluorescence mode using a Lytle diode and data were analysed using the IFEFFIT software package. All the XANES spectra were recorded in the transmission mode using a Si (111) monochromator. Samples were loaded on a sample holder by pressing onto a double coated tape uniformly. The sample holder was then placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber maintained at a pressure lower than 1e−3 Torr. All the data were collected in the energy range of 840–890eV with 0.1eV steps and 1s/point acquisition time. The beam was focused vertically using a mirror, and the entrance and exit slits were used to achieve the desired beam spot size of 1000μm×100μm (HxV). All the measurements were done using vertical exit slit of 10mm placed before the monochromator. Spectrum of Ni and Rh foil were also collected as reference for energy alignment. EXAFS analysis was measured at the Ni K-edge using a double crystal Si (111) monochromator. The powder samples were loaded on a sample holder by pressing onto a double coated tape uniformly. The amount of sample used was chosen to get an absorption edge jump (Δμx ≈1). Then the sample holder was placed between the first and the second ionization chambers in the hutch and metal foil (Ni or Rh) was used between the second and the third chambers for energy calibration. All spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode on a 13-element solid-state Ge fluorescence detector. The data acquisition system comprised three ionization detectors (incident I 0, transmitted I t, and reference I r). The reference channel was used to calibrate the edge positions against a pure metal foil. EXAFS data were collected in 10eV steps in the pre-edge region (8250–8310eV), 0.25eV steps in the edge region (8310–8350eV), 0.5eV steps in the near edge region (8350–8630eV) and 5.0eV steps in the far-edge region (8631eV–15.5keV). All the EXAFS data were analysed using following software programs: athena to remove background and normalize the curve, IFEFF to fit and model the EXAFS data, and ARTEMIS to fit the EXAFS function. The EXAFS coordination parameters, e.g. coordination geometry, number and identity of neighboring atoms, etc., were obtained by a least square fit in q- and r-space of the isolated nearest neighbor, k 2-weighted Fourier transform data using a Hanning-type window in the interval k =1−10Å−1."
4,Thermodynamics analysis for carbon deposition,"2.3 Thermodynamics analysis for carbon deposition Thermodynamics analysis of oxidative and non-oxidative steam reforming of ethanol was investigated by Gibbs free energy minimization method as a function of temperature, steam to ethanol (S/E), and oxygen to ethanol (O/E) molar ratios. This helped to determine the optimum operating conditions where carbon formation could be minimized."
5,Catalytic test,"2.4 Catalytic test Ethanol steam reforming tests with or without oxygen were carried out in a fixed-bed stainless steel tubular reactor (i.d.=8mm) at 600°C and space time of 9.17kgcat h/kgmol[EtOH]) under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the reactions, catalysts were reduced using a 50% H2 in N2 at 550°C for 6h. Then the feed was passed through the reactor with 1g of catalyst (0.5±0.1mm of pellets) diluted with SiC (same particle size range) at a volume ratio of 1:1. Reaction products were passed through a condenser (∼5°C) and then separated in a gas liquid separator. Gaseous products were analysed using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and using HayeSep Q and molecular sieve (13×) columns in series. The liquid products were analysed using a gas chromatograph (GC) containing HP-5 capillary column with a flammable ignition detector (FID). The details on experimental set-up and procedure are given elsewhere [44]. Ethanol conversion (X ethanol), products selectivity (S i), and hydrogen yield (Y H) were calculated according to following equations. (1) X ethanol ( % ) = ( n ethanol ) fed − ( n ethanol ) out ( n ethanol ) fed × 100 (2) S i ( % ) = ( n i ) produced ( n total ) produced × 100 (3) Y H 2 = ( n H 2 ) produced ν i × ( n ethanol ) fed where (n i )produced is the moles of i produced (i =H2, CO, CH4, and CO2), (n total)produced the moles of (H2 +CO+CH4 +CO2) produced, and v i is stoichiometric coefficient (6 and 5 for SRE and OSRE, respectively)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of fresh catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of fresh catalysts The BET surface area, and pore volume of Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and Rh-Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts before (fresh catalyst) and after reaction (used catalyst) are given in Table 1 . The Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements revealed the mesoporous nature of fresh 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst with a BET surface area of 20.6m2/g and pore volume of 0.048cm3/g., whereas after 1%Rh impregnation these values decreased slightly due to partial pore blockage. Textural properties of fresh and used catalysts The XRD patterns of Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst (not shown) demonstrated the characteristic peaks of NiO corresponding to (222), (400), (440), (622) and (444) crystal planes, while the XRD patterns of Rh promoted Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 exhibited similar phases corresponding to NiO with lesser intensity. This indicates the better dispersion of NiO crystallite in Rh promoted catalyst. No separate phase of rhodium was found from XRD analysis, due to either its lower amount in the catalyst or due to high Rh dispersion [45]. The crystallite size of NiO for each catalyst was obtained as the average between the values calculated for the peaks corresponding to (222), (400), and (440) diffraction planes respectively. In Table 1, an average NiO crystallite size of about 35nm was found for Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, whereas, smaller crystal (28.5nm) was formed in Rh promoted catalyst due to better dispersion of NiO. The XRD patterns of reduced catalysts, both fresh and used, exhibit sharp peaks corresponding to the planes (111), (200) and (222) of cubic Ni° at 2θ =44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4°, respectively, as well as very small peaks corresponding to unreduced NiO. All the peaks corresponding to support material remains unchanged. These results indicate that most of the NiO species reduced to metallic Ni after H2-treatment. The crystallite size of 57 and 48nm corresponding to metallic Ni was found after H2-treatment over fresh 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and Rh promoted catalyst, respectively, indicating promotional effect of Rh on formation of smaller Ni° crystallites. In addition, a very small peak was found at 2θ =69.8° corresponding to the (220) crystal plane of metallic Rh with an average crystallite size of 12nm. The TPR profiles of 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst depicted two distinct reduction peaks at 420 and 540°C, respectively, which were attributed to the reduction of bulk NiO particles as well as the reduction of support promoted by the formation of metal particles and the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. Rh promoted Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst also demonstrated two reduction peaks at 190 and 390°C, which were assigned to reduction of Rh2O3 to Rh° and the reduction of NiO as well as the support, respectively. The theoretical hydrogen required to reduce NiO present in the 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst was calculated as 51 mmol g cat − 1 , whereas, the hydrogen uptake obtained in TPR experiment due to reduction of NiO to Ni° was found as 5.8 ± 0.2 mmol g cat − 1 , which confirms the reduction of all the NiO as well as the support materials. For the Rh promoted Ni catalyst, the actual hydrogen uptake was higher ( 7.0 ± 0.4 mmol g cat − 1 ) compared to theoretical value. On this catalyst, once the hydrogen dissociated on metallic Rh, was able to spill over to the nearest NiO species as well as the support materials (CeO2-ZrO2) and helps to reduce them at lower temperature. The results revealed that addition of Rh enhances the reducibility of Ni and the support by hydrogen spill over phenomenon as the second reduction peak shifted towards lower temperature than that of Ni impregnated catalyst [38]. The XPS studies were performed over Ni based catalysts in order to investigate the nature of species present (Fig. 1 ). In case of CeO2-ZrO2 sample, three peaks appear at 28.5, 46.2 and 100.5eV corresponding to 4s and 4p electron transfer from Zr atoms and 4d electron from Ce atoms, which indicates that binding energies for Zr 4s, 4p and Ce 4d3/2 core-level shifted toward lower energy. This shift of peaks position at lower energy indicates strong interaction between Ce and Zr due to the formation of solid solution. Zr 4p shows peak at 28.5eV, which is in correspondence with pure element (Zr 4p) peak. Upon Ni impregnation on support, this peak shifted at lower energy (26.5eV) and the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the peak (Table 2 ) increased from 5.6 to 6.2eV indicating enlargement of Zr-O bond leading to increase in metal-support interaction. Ni loaded catalyst samples show peaks around 6.7, 72 and 105.4eV. The peak corresponding to low binding energy is due to the transition of d electrons and the peak at 72 and 105.4eV corresponds to NiO (Ni 3p,sat∼72.8eV and 3s∼111eV) species, respectively. The FWHM of Ni 3p peak for the metal loaded catalysts increased from 4.8 to 5.6eV with Rh impregnation indicating the creation of more elongated Ni-O bond in NiO present in the sample. The Raman spectra of CeO2-ZrO2 support, Ni impregnated catalyst, and Rh promoted Ni catalyst are shown in Fig. 2A. A board Raman band at 500cm−1 found in standard NiO sample, which is assigned as NiO band. 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts also have the same peak which confirms the presence of NiO in both the samples. The Raman spectrum of CeO2-ZrO2 sample is dominated by a strong band at ∼470cm−1 which can be attributed to the F2g vibration of the fluorite type lattice of the mixed oxide [46]. The intensity of this band decreased in Ni impregnated catalysts due the predominant NiO band. 3.1.1 XAS (XANES and EXAFS) The normalized XANES signal of Ni K-edge for all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3A along with those of NiO and Ni foil. The presence of (i) small pre-edge at around 8333eV; (ii) higher intensity of main absorption; and (iii) significant oscillation at 8375–8450eV (lower region of EXAFS), signifies that NiO with 6-fold local co-ordination is present in all the samples. In Fig. 3A, a weak pre-edge peak (α) at around 8333eV is seen for NiO, which is attributed to the 1s–3d transition [47]. In the XANES spectra, the pre-edge region appeared due to the local electronic structure of Ni atoms in the presence of the core–hole. The Ni K-edge absorption is mainly caused by the transition of a 1s electron (core atomic state) to 3d (final unoccupied state) of absorbing Ni atom. The final state is a relaxed excited state due to the presence of a 1s core–hole screened by the other electrons of Ni [48]. The catalyst samples 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 both display weak pre-edge peak, same as the reference compound NiO, indicating the presence of NiO or Ni in oxidized state in these samples. Moreover, both the samples exhibit strong main edge (white line, β) similar to NiO, indicating that they have the dominant +2 oxidation state of Ni. Moreover, the peak intensity at 8365eV increased with metal loading (not shown) suggesting lesser Ni–Ni interaction, which leads to form a larger cluster of NiO. The intensity of such peak at 8365eV after main edge in case of reference compound NiO, increased with Ni-Ni interaction leading to the increase in cluster size. In the XANES spectra of the Rh promoted catalyst, the weak and broad peak at this position implies less Ni–Ni interaction, indicating better dispersion of metal on the support as compared to 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The Ni K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Ni catalyst and Rh promoted Ni catalyst supported on CeO2-ZrO2 are shown in Fig. 3B and k 3 weighted Ni K-edge EXAFS signals and its Fourier transforms (FT) in r, q and k-space are shown in Fig. 4 . For the reference compound in Fig. 4A, two peaks appear at 1.60 and 2.52Å, with the first peak corresponding to the nearest neighbor (NN) Ni–O (2.08Å) coordination shell and the second peak due to second coordination shell Ni–Ni (2.95Å). For NiO, the second peak is much stronger than the first one due to strong Ni–Ni coordination. From both the peak positions and the FT magnitudes, the FTs of 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts are comparable to reference NiO, which is in agreement with the finding from XANES spectra. The contribution of the first two co-ordination shells, i.e. Ni–O1 and Ni–Ni2 to the total EXAFS signal was first isolated by the Fourier filtering procedure in the r-space range of 1–3Å. The obtained signal is then fitted in the k-space range of 1–15Å−1 using the two-component Gaussian model. As can be seen from Fig. 4, that the fitting provides a good agreement between experimental and fitted EXAFS signals and the best fit was obtained in the r-space range of 1–3Å and k-space range of 2–12Å, respectively. The obtained structural parameters, e.g. coordination numbers (N), interatomic distances (R), and mean-squared relative displacements (MSRDs), also known as EXAFS Debye–Waller factors (σ 2) are reported in Table 3 . From the table, it can be observed that the average co-ordination numbers N in the 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst decreased by 0.1Å in the first shell and increased by 0.4Å in second shell with respect to reference NiO. The interatomic distance for the first shell decreased by 0.01Å, whereas it increased by same distance for the second shell. For Rh promoted catalyst, the interatomic distance for Ni–O1 reduced and Ni–Ni2 distance increased further, indicating better metal dispersion as compared to unpromoted one. Thus, it can be concluded that the local structure of NiO in the catalyst samples relaxes leading to an increase of disorder. The observed difference between the EXAFS signals of the two samples (e.g. reference NiO and catalyst samples) is mainly due to the amplitude damping and a difference in the frequency of oscillations at higher k-values. The Fourier transforms of the EXAFS signal shows the progressive lowering of peak amplitude at larger R-value, due to the reduction of coordination number, which causes the increase of the disorder due to the structure relaxation."
8,Thermodynamics analysis for carbon deposition,"3.2 Thermodynamics analysis for carbon deposition Fig. 5 shows the thermodynamic analysis of carbon formation (mol of C formed/mol of ethanol fed) as a function of temperature and steam to ethanol molar ratio. Negligible amount of carbon formation is observed at temperature >300°C for H2O/EtOH ratios above 3. In case of SRE, for H2O/EtOH ratios equal to 1 and 2, there is some carbon formation, which is maximized around 500–600°C. This suggests that the endothermic methane decomposition reaction is favored with in this temperature range, whereas addition of oxygen in oxidative steam reforming (OSRE), carbon formation is higher at lower temperature, which decreases with increasing temperature for same H2O/EtOH ratio. This is may be due to carbon gasification reaction in presence of oxygen, which facilitates at higher temperatures. Therefore, it can be concluded from thermodynamics analysis of steam reforming of ethanol that the graphitic carbon formation is unfavorable at higher steam to ethanol molar ratios and temperature higher than 300°C. The formation of carbon on catalysts surface is the main cause of catalysts’ deactivation during SRE and OSRE. Therefore, it is important to find out the region or the range of operating conditions where carbon formation can be minimized. The transition conditions from carbon formation region to no carbon formation region are plotted in Fig. 5c as a function of temperature and S/E ratios at different O/E ratios, which indicates formation of almost negligible carbon for S/E ratio higher than 3 and temperature above 300°C. Carbon formation is favored at lower S/E ratios (<3) and O/E ratios (0, 0.1) even at higher temperatures [49]. The possible ways for carbon formation are as follows: (1) ethanol dehydration to ethylene, which further convert to coke by polymerization reaction; (2) ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde, which then convert to coke; (3) the Boudouard reaction; (4) the reverse of carbon steam gasification and (5) methane decomposition [9,49–51]. (1) 2 CO ⇌ CO 2 + C , Δ H 298 0 = − 171.5 kJ/mol The most commonly reported reason for carbon formation can be expressed by these reactions. (2) CO + H 2 ⇌ C + H 2 O , Δ H 298 0 = − 131.4 kJ/mol (3) CH 4 ⇌ C + 2 H 2 , Δ H 298 0 = 74.9 kJ/mol At low temperature coke formation favors through Boudouard (Rxn-1) and the reverse of steam gasification reactions (Rxn-2) as these are endothermic reactions. While at higher temperature, carbon formation mainly occurs through methane decomposition reactions (Rxn-3) [50]. Carbon formation is thermodynamically unfavorable at steam to ethanol molar ratios >3 and temperatures higher than 300°C. However, experimental results revealed carbon formed in significant amount. It is also reported in the literature, that the experimental observation deviates from thermodynamic predictions since the composition along the reactor stays far from equilibrium. Thus, it is believed that carbon formation causes probably due to hindered carbon gasification which leads to a competition between reactions generating and removal of carbon from catalysts’ surface [9]."
9,Catalytic performance test,"3.3 Catalytic performance test 3.3.1 Crude bio-ethanol composition To identify and quantify the components present in the crude ethanol, GCMS analysis was performed. The results of this analysis interprets that crude bio-ethanol is mainly consists of ethanol and water and traces of 2,3-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, butandioic acid, acetic acid, and glycerol (Table 4 ). This was used as feed material after removal of particulate matter by filtration. 3.3.2 Conversion and product selectivity by steam reforming and oxidative steam reforming of crude ethanol Table 5 depicts the ethanol conversion, product selectivity and hydrogen yield obtained for 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. For the SRE, ethanol conversion (81–86%) and hydrogen yield (2.4–3.4mol/mol) increased due to addition of 1wt.% Rh on 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The promotional effect of Rh on ethanol conversion can be related to its ability for breaking the C–C bonds. The compositions of the outlet stream improved significantly on Rh promoted catalyst as hydrogen selectivity increased to 72.8% as compared to 58.9% on 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst and selectivity to CO and CH4 reduced to approximately 3.0% and 3.2%, respectively. The increased hydrogen yield can be attributed to the ability of Rh to promote steam reforming and water gas shift reaction and suppress coke formation reactions. This result was further verified by calculating the change in mass action ratios of water gas shift (MARWGS) and methane steam reforming (MARMSR) reactions from the experimental data using Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively. The MAR values for SRE over 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst (at 600°C and 9.17kgcat h/kgmol[EtOH] of space time), were 0.13 (dimensionless) and 0.0006 (atm2) for water gas shift and methane steam reforming reaction, respectively. These values increased to 1.34 (dimensionless) and 0.0033 (atm2) over Rh promoted catalysts under identical experimental conditions. The results revealed that Rh incorporation on the catalysts improved hydrogen yield by promoting both water gas shift and methane steam reforming reactions. The obtained results are in good agreement with the values reported in the literature [52]. It is noticed that WGS reaction reached half of the equilibrium value ( K WGS @ 600 ∘ C Eqm = 2.59 ) , whereas, MSR reaction still remained far from equilibrium ( K MSR @ 600 ∘ C Eqm = 0.52 atm 2 ) . (4) CO + H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + H 2 , MAR WGS = p CO 2 p H 2 p CO p H 2 O (5) CH 4 + H 2 O ⇌ 3 H 2 + CO , MAR MSR = p H 2 3 p CO p CH 4 p H 2 O In OSRE, both ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield increased from 85% to 90% and 2.0 to 2.3mol/mol, respectively after the addition of 1wt.% Rh on 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The selectivity of hydrogen increased from 54% to 61%, whereas, the selectivity of CO and CH4 reduced from 14.7% to 7.7% and from 7% to 5.2%, respectively, for Rh promoted catalyst. The mass action ratios for OSRE increased from 0.06 to 0.30 (dimensionless) and from 0.0001 to 0.0005 (atm2), respectively for water–gas shift and methane steam reforming reactions over Rh promoted catalyst as compared to 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst under identical experimental conditions. The results indicate that lower hydrogen yield and selectivity was obtained during oxidative steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol, due to the partial oxidation of oxygenate compounds present in the feed. 3.3.3 Effect of run time on ethanol conversion and product selectivity To study the stability of the catalyst, experiments were carried out at 600°C and constant space time of 9.17kgcat h/kgmol[EtOH] for a period of 48h with crude ethanol as feed. Ethanol conversion and product distribution with time on stream (TOS) on both the 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 6 . At the start of the reaction 91% ethanol conversion achieved on Rh promoted catalyst, which decreased to 86% after 12h operation, and remained stable up to 48h. Compared to this, conversion dropped down from 85% to 81% on 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The observed deactivation of the catalyst is mainly due to coke formation on the surface of the catalyst, which is favored by the presence of the impurities (higher alcohols) in the feed. The selectivity to hydrogen also decreased marginally and became constant at 73%. The composition of other gaseous products, viz. CO, CH4 and CO2 in the outlet stream were found 3%, 3% and 21%, respectively. No significant change was observed with time on stream, indicating that catalyst deactivation did not affect the selectivity of these products."
10,Characterization of used catalyst,"3.4 Characterization of used catalyst The used catalysts after steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol were characterized by various techniques, i.e. BET, XRD, TPR, TPO, TGA, SEM, and TEM to determine the possible causes of the catalyst deactivation. BET analysis show (Table 1) that compared to fresh catalysts, the surface area and pore volume of used catalysts reduced significantly, which indicates that the surface area and pore volume of the spent catalysts decreased due to the partial blockage of pore surface and external surface of the catalysts by carbon particles deposition [53]. The change in surface area and pore volume of used 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst was slightly lesser as compared to the unpromoted catalyst because of lesser carbon deposition. This result clearly indicates that Rh-promoted catalyst shows less deactivation. To investigate the changes occurred in the catalysts after steam reforming reaction, the XRD analysis of the used catalysts was carried out. The intensity of peaks corresponding to CeO2-ZrO2 (Fig. 7A) increased in spent catalysts as compared to fresh one, because the dominant NiO peaks diminished in the used catalysts due to the reduction of NiO to Ni°. Although CeO2-ZrO2 peak position was unaffected after reaction. The crystallite size of Ni species (NiO and Ni) on both fresh and used catalysts were calculated from X-ray diffraction patterns using Scherrer equation and reported in Table 1. The results indicate that the crystallite sizes did not increase significantly, which therefore, ensures that active metal sintering did not take part in catalyst deactivation process. In Fig. 7B, XRD patterns of crystalline graphite (used as a reference) shows sharp peaks at 2θ value of 26.53, 44.53 and 54.62 which are corresponding to (002), (101) and (004) phases of hexagonal graphite. Whereas, XRD analysis of carbon deposited on catalyst shows two board lesser intense peaks at 2θ value of 25.86 and 44.36 which can be assigned to (002) and (101) phases of hexagonal carbon material. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of deposited carbonaceous species during steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol was investigated by temperature programmed hydrogenation (TPH) analysis of spent catalysts. The TPH profiles of 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst show peaks at three different temperatures zone (Fig. 8a). The low temperature peak at ∼300°C (Peak 1), is assigned to monoatomic coke hydrogenation and the peak at 400°C (Peak 2), corresponds to fraction of polymeric coke deposition. Moreover, it shows a major peak at 400–600°C (Peak 3) corresponding to the hydrogenation of filamentous carbon (graphitic structure) [8]. Both types of non-structured cokes, i.e. monoatomic and polymeric, are well known for blocking the metal sites on the catalyst, while the filamentous coke has less encapsulating capability than the non-structured coke. As can be seen, that significant amount of both amorphous ( ∼ 12 mg g cat − 1 corresponding to (Peak 1+Peak 2)) and filamentous ( ∼ 29 mg g cat − 1 corresponding to Peak 3) carbon was deposited on 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The results revealed that the loss of catalytic activity for 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst is due to the partial blockage of metallic sites by both amorphous and filamentous carbon deposition, thereby hindering the adsorption of ethanol and water molecules on the catalysts. On the other hand, the TPH profiles of Rh promoted catalyst (Fig. 8b) shows three relatively lesser intense peaks at 160, 220 and 310°C, respectively. The first two low temperature peaks (Peak 1, Peak 2) are attributed to the hydrogenation of monoatomic amorphous carbon and the third one (Peak 3) corresponds to the filamentous coke with different degree of graphitization. The presence of lesser encapsulating amorphous coke ( ∼ 8 mg g cat − 1 corresponding to (Peak 1+Peak 2)) and filamentous ( ∼ 8 mg g cat − 1 corresponding to Peak 3) coke as compared to 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst explains lower deactivation rate and higher stability of 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. These results evidence the role of different types of coke (amorphous and filamentous) in the catalysts’ deactivation during steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol. The amount and nature of the carbon deposits formed were investigated by TPO analysis of used catalysts after steam reforming reaction. The TPO profiles of both catalysts (Fig. 9 ) show two different oxidation zones: one at low temperature range (300–400°C) and the other is at high temperature range (550–650°C) which is generally assigned to gasification/oxidation of carbon deposited on the catalysts. The TPO profile of 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst shows two peaks at 350 (Peak 1) and 600°C (Peak 2), respectively in significant intensity with a shoulder peak at 630°C (Peak 3). The shoulder peak appears due to oxidation of carbonaceous species having different degree of graphitization, whereas, the Rh promoted catalyst shows a wide, lesser intense peak at 340°C (Peak 1) and an intense peak at 580°C (Peak 2) with a shoulder peak at 600°C (Peak 3). The two peaks observed are attributed to the presence of two different type of carbon deposition on the surface of the catalysts. The peak at low temperature was assigned to the oxidation of amorphous carbon deposit on metal surface, whereas the peak at higher temperature was due to the oxidation of filamentous carbon. Quantitative analysis (from deconvolution of peaks) also shows lesser amount of amorphous carbon ( ( ∼ 1 mg g cat − 1 ) and filamentous carbon ( ∼ 24 mg g cat − 1 corresponding to (Peak 2+Peak 3)) deposition on Rh-promoted catalyst as compared to ∼9 and 37 mg g cat − 1 of C, respectively on 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, which indicates deactivation occurs mainly by encapsulating amorphous carbon deposition. Lima et al. [54] observed two peaks: low temperature peak at around 500–550°C and high temperature peak at 600°C. They reported that these two peaks appear due to the presence of filamentous carbon and graphitic carbon during SRE and OSRE. Similarly, Galetti et al. [55,56] also observed two peaks during TPO analysis of different Ni/ZnAl2O4 catalysts after steam reforming of ethanol. It has been reported in the literature that the catalyst deactivation during steam reforming of ethanol, occurs mainly through carbon formation by ethanol dehydration to produce ethylene, which further polymerizes to form carbonaceous species. The first oxidation peak can be ascribed to carbonaceous species which are formed due to acetaldehyde decomposition and the high temperature oxidation peak is ascribed due to ethylene polymerization to coke [11]. Our results revealed that catalysts deactivation occurred due to formation of both amorphous and filamentous carbon on the catalysts and Rh inclusion prevents carbon formation by favoring ethanol dehydrogenation, which leads to acetaldehyde production over ethanol dehydration. The nature of carbonaceous species deposited during the catalytic steam reforming tests was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The spectra obtained for used catalysts are shown in Fig. 2B. Both 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts showed two major peaks at 1350 and 1596cm−1, which are characteristic bands of graphitic carbon. The band occurred at 1350cm−1, is ascribed to the vibration of the sp3 hybridized carbon atom of disordered carbonaceous species and usually designated as the “D” band, while the band observed at 1596cm−1, which is designated as the “G” band, is assigned to the in-plane sp2 C–C stretching vibrations of well structured carbon deposits [57]. The Raman spectra of crystalline graphite typically shows a G band centered around 1550cm−1 and a D band centered at 1350cm−1. The D band is characteristic of poorly structured carbonaceous deposits, while the G band is assigned to the in-plane sp2 C–C stretching vibrations of well structured carbon deposits. The ratios of the intensity of these two bands (I D/I G) were used to measure the disorder of graphitic carbon. The higher the value of I D/I G ratio means the presence of less structured carbon deposits. The I D/I G ratio for 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 is 2.55 and for 1%Rh-30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 is 1.57. This indicates that the deactivation occurred mainly due to deposition of less structured graphitic carbon. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after steam reforming was measured by TGA method. Based on TGA results, it was observed that the weight loss of the catalyst occurred at around 650°C, corresponding to the CO2 formation in the gas phase confirming the presence of carbonaceous species. In SRE, the carbon deposition rate was 99mgC(gcatalyst)−1 h−1 on 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, whereas, on Rh promoted catalyst, the rate decreased to 53mgC(gcatalyst)−1 h−1. The results revealed that the amount of carbon deposition over Rh promoted catalyst was significantly lesser compared to unpromoted Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. To study the post-reaction catalyst morphology, the spent catalysts were further analysed by SEM and TEM. SEM images (Fig. 10 ) show that the presence of both amorphous and rod-shaped filamentous carbon on the catalysts surface. TEM images of used catalyst (Fig. 11 ) show agglomerated carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. Catalyst sintering was insignificant as no significant difference in NiO crystallite size was observed in the TEM images of fresh and used catalysts, indicating that the catalyst deactivation occurred mainly due to deposition of carbonaceous species. Moreover, amorphous and filamentous carbon nanotubes were found in the TEM micrograms of deposited carbon on the catalysts surface."
11,Kinetics of carbon gasification,"3.5 Kinetics of carbon gasification The effect of heating rate (β) during carbon gasification process of deposited carbon on the catalysts after steam reforming was investigated at three different heating rates, i.e. 5, 10, 15°Cmin−1 under oxidizing atmosphere. Heating rate affects TGA curve position, maximum decomposition rate and maximum decomposition temperature (T m). When heating rate increases, maximum point of TGA and DTG curve are shifted towards higher temperature. At low heating rate, a larger instantaneous thermal energy is provided in the system and time required for the purge gas to reach equilibrium with the temperature of the sample increases, while a short reaction time is required at higher heating rate, which causes the decomposition temperature to shift to the right. The results obtained from TGA-DTG curve were fitted by Kissinger method to calculate the kinetic parameters for carbon gasification/oxidation process. The activation energy (E a) for this process was derived from the slope of the plot ln ( β T m − 2 ) versus 1/T m (K−1) for a series of experiments at different heating rates (β). The value of activation energy obtained for coke gasification from Kissinger methods is70.56kJmol−1."
12,Conclusion,"The catalytic oxidative and non-oxidative steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol for hydrogen production were studied over 30wt.%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1wt.%Rh-30wt.%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. Incorporation of small amount of Rh on 30wt.%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst promoted reducibility as well as dispersion of NiO. The formation of smaller NiO crystallite was also observed with Rh incorporated catalyst. From catalysts characterization results, it is believed that the facile reduction and smaller crystallite size of Ni on Rh promoted Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, improved the catalytic activity compare to the unpromoted one. 81% ethanol conversion achieved with 59% hydrogen selectivity on Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst in steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol, whereas, higher ethanol conversion (86%) with 73% hydrogen selectivity achieved using Rh-Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. In oxidative steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol, lower hydrogen yield and selectivity obtained due to the partial oxidation of oxygenate compounds present in the feed. Moreover, product composition improved significantly by suppressing by-product formation in both SRE and OSRE over Rh promoted catalyst as compared to 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 due to the ability of Rh to promote steam reforming and water gas shift reactions. The characterization results of used catalyst revealed that the loss of catalytic activity for 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst is due to the partial blockage of metallic sites by both amorphous and filamentous carbon deposition, thereby hindering the adsorption of ethanol and water molecules on the catalysts. Rh promoted catalyst exhibited lower deactivation rate and higher stability as compared to 30%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst due to the deposition of less encapsulating amorphous coke."
