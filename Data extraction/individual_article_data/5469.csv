0,Introduction,"Space activities continue to be pursued with considerable excitement for reasons such as exploration for life, resources, and for the more prosaic motivation of the establishment of satellite constellations. For effective acceleration and movement, the development of high-performance propulsion systems is essential. For chemical propulsion systems, storable liquids are required to provide a high impulse for long-term missions, and one of the key issues is to find an economical and environmentally-friendly way to develop these into an advanced propulsion system. The desire is to seek green energetic liquid propellants to replace existing liquid propellants [1–3]. Hydrazine, hydrazine-derivatives, dinitrogen tetroxide, and nitric acid are the conventional storable liquid propellants, which are highly toxic and corrosive; their properties also raise technical issues relating to their fueling, handling, and production. Newly developed green propellants should not only have comparable performance with the conventional propellants, but also be less hazardous and more economical. Many studies related to green energetic liquids have been launched since the early 2000s, and some practical applications have been successfully demonstrated [4,5]. Green propulsion technologies with storable propellants can be classified depending on the broad type of the propellant: monopropellant or bipropellant. Monopropellants consist of only one liquid, whereas bipropellants are a combination of a liquid fuel and oxidizer; bipropellant thrusters can normally produce relatively large propulsive forces compared with monopropellant thrusters. Especially, bipropellants and their combustion are more energetic than the decomposition of monopropellants. Conventional storable bipropellants are hypergolic; hypergolicity is regarded as a precondition that new bipropellants should have. Hypergolicity is an ignition characteristic of the fuel and oxidizer, which is a chemically-promoted auto-ignition process by physical contact of the propellants without any extra ignition source. In many cases, green or nontoxic combinations of hypergolic bipropellants use hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizer and a variety of novel fuels. Regarding monopropellants, various new types have been reported in recent decades as green alternatives to hydrazine, which is extremely toxic and carcinogenic. An ammonium dinitramide (ADN)-based monopropellant was developed and demonstrated its applicability through the Prototype Research Instruments and Space Mission technology Advancement (PRISMA) project [4]. In addition, a hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN)-based monopropellant has been actively researched [5]. Hydrogen peroxide was assessed as a green monopropellant from an early stage in rocket development, but its application was considerably limited due to its inferior performance to hydrazine. However, high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide have once again come into the spotlight because of its environmentally-friendly nature. In particular, research has been conducted to enhance the performance of hydrogen peroxide monopropellant by blending with a small amount of hydrocarbon fuel such as ethanol [6,7]. The hydrogen peroxide-based monopropellant blended with alcohol was successfully demonstrated in a series of ground hot-firing tests, but limitations were discovered in some technical applications. The limitations were related to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the mixing ratio with alcohol. According to previous results, the various mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and hydrocarbons were classified as highly explosive materials [8,9]. As either the concentration of hydrogen peroxide or the mixing ratio of the hydrocarbon fuel was increased, the sensitivity of the explosive mixture was significantly enhanced. This was the reason that the previous studies utilized 70 wt.% hydrogen peroxide for the blended monopropellant due to safety considerations. In other words, the performance of the hydrogen peroxide-based mixture was restricted due to the limitations. Efforts were made in the present study to seek a promising candidate for a green energetic monopropellant consisting of a hydrogen peroxide-based mixture. Theoretically, there is an infinite range of mixture combinations of hydrogen peroxide and hydrocarbon fuels which have superior performance to conventional monopropellants. If the applicability of just one of the mixtures is practically and stably demonstrated through hot-firing tests, a new dawn in the field of green energetic monopropellant technologies could arrive. Among the numerous hydrocarbon fuels, in this work, tetraglyme was selected. The fuel was blended with rocket grade hydrogen peroxide (90 wt.%). The mixture was given the name of hydrogen-peroxide-based energetic monopropellant, which was abbreviated as HPM-##. The mixing ratio of the fuel was varied, and the numbering assigned to the name of “HPM-##” indicates the weight percentage of the fuel blended into the total mixture. The theoretical performance of HPMs was estimated by the NASA CEA code [10]. The thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to examine the pyrolysis characteristics of the mixture. Before implementing ground hot-firing testing, a small-scale packed-bed catalytic reactor was designed to assess the feasibility of the catalytic ignition of the mixtures. The ground hot-firing test was performed with an engineering model thruster on a 10 N scale. During a hot-firing test, the thruster and propellant feed system were severely damaged by the explosion of the mixture. In this study, great exertion has been made to resolve the technical issues based on the experimental data and relevant previous research."
1,Experimental approach,
2,Theoretical performance of HPM,"2.1 Theoretical performance of HPM HPM is a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and hydrocarbon fuel. 90 wt.% hydrogen peroxide was prepared as the main solvent of HPM, and tetraglyme (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, C10H22O5) was utilized as the fuel substance of the mixture. Tetraglyme is a polar aprotic solvent with excellent thermal stability, resulting from its high boiling point and low vapor pressure. Especially, the auto-ignition temperature of tetraglyme (200 °C) is very close to the temperature where hydrogen peroxide started to be thermally decomposed (approximately 150 °C). In addition, the fuel is miscible with water [11]. Table 1 summarizes the properties of tetraglyme. In this study, the numbering of HPM-08, HPM-12, and HPM-20 indicates the different weight percent of the fuel blended into the mixture: 8, 12, and 20 weight percent of the fuel, respectively. The density of the mixtures was measured with an ISO 649 standard hydrometer, ranging from 1.25 g/cm3 to 1.28 g/cm3; the density of 90 wt.% H2O2 and tetraglyme under standard ambient conditions was approximately 1.39 g/cm3 and 1.01 g/cm3, respectively As shown in Fig. 1 , the theoretical performance of the HPM mixtures was estimated by NASA CEA. The performance was calculated based on vacuum and freezing conditions (the freezing point was at the nozzle throat) with a chamber pressure of 10 bar. The pressure ratio between the chamber pressure (Pi) and the exit pressure of the nozzle (Pe) was set to 1000 (Pi/Pe = 1000) so that the expansion ratio of the nozzle was estimated to be approximately 67.1. The adiabatic temperature indicates the combustion temperature in an adiabatic condition. The O/F ratio refers to the oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio, and in terms of the weight percent of the fuel in the mixture 18.45 was the stoichiometry condition. As the content of tetraglyme in the mixture increased, the specific impulse and adiabatic temperature rose. In this calculation, it was estimated that the combination of HPM-08 theoretically had similar performance to certain newly developed monopropellants (LP1846 and LPM-103S); the performance of the propellants was reported as a specific impulse of approximately 253 s [7]. Thermogravimetric analysis of HPM mixtures was conducted to investigate their thermal stability in air (see Fig. 2). Assuming that a 10% reduction of mass from the initial mass was the criterion for thermal stability, all of the mixtures were more stable than 90 wt.% H2O2 in air. The rapid mass consumption of the mixtures occurred after the criterion condition because of the possible acceleration of the pyrolysis process due to the exothermic decomposition of the oxidizer. The calorific values of the HPM mixtures were measured by Parr-1261, and the results of HPM-08, 12, and 20 were approximately 1 103 kJ/mol, 1 305 kJ/mol, and 1 761 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, the reaction enthalpy of H2O2 decomposition was reported as approximately 99.0 ± 1.9 kJ/mol [12]."
3,Catalytic combustion testing in a small-scale packed-bed reactor,"2.2 Catalytic combustion testing in a small-scale packed-bed reactor A small-scale packed-bed reactor was designed to assess the feasibility of the catalytic ignition of HPM. Herein, the catalytic ignition was defined that the gaseous mixture between the fuel and oxidizer substances was automatically ignited, resulting from the initial ignition of the fuel substance by the exothermic catalytic decomposition of H2O2. HPM-08 was selected for the test because it had the lowest the weight percent of blended fuel. It was expected that it would be more difficult to achieve catalytic ignition as the fuel content became lower. Fig. 3 shows the configuration of the small-scale reactor. As the catalyst, lanthanum-doped manganese oxide (MnOx) was the active material and gamma-phase alumina was the support material. The size of the catalyst pellets was roughly 16—18 mesh size (1.0—1.18 mm). The manufacturing process of the catalyst is briefly explained in this work, and more detailed information has been described in previous research [13]. Commercial γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3 supplied by Alfa-Aesar) was used for the catalyst support. The precursors of the active materials were sodium permanganate solution (NaMnO4) and lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3). Wet-impregnation and thermal calcination were utilized for the manufacturing process. It was already confirmed that this type of catalyst efficiently decomposes high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (90 wt.% H2O2), and that lanthanum doping could enhance the thermal durability of the manganese oxide catalyst [13]. The designated mass flow rate of HPM-08 was approximately 1 g/s. The diameter of the catalyst bed was 10 mm, and the length was 30 mm. Three K-type thermocouples were placed at equidistant intervals along the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature. The quartz window was utilized for the visual observation of the inside of the catalyst bed. The test procedure began with a cold start injection, without preheating of the catalyst bed, and was first performed for 10 s; the second injection test was repeated under the same conditions when the temperatures were below 50 °C after finishing the cold start test. The data were collected by a SCXI module from National Instruments, with a sampling rate of 100 Hz."
4,Hot-firing tests of 10 N experimental thruster,"2.3 Hot-firing tests of 10 N experimental thruster Figure 4 describes the hot-firing test apparatus. The HPM mixture was pressurized in the propellant tank by high purity nitrogen gas. The components of the feed system were made of stainless steel. 1/4-inch commercial pipe lines were used to supply the propellant from the tank to the thruster module. Pneumatic valves were used to control the injection sequences of the propellant, and a programmable logic controller provided electric signals to the valves. The feeding system was not passivated. This is because most of the components in the system were made by stainless steel. The material is satisfactory for repeated, relatively short term contact with hydrogen peroxide solutions. In the present study, the contact time between the mixture and the components was limited because the test duration was very short. After finishing individual tests, we quickly drained the remaining propellant out and fully dried up the system by nitrogen gas. In practice, there was no problem during the pressurizing process and firing tests. An engineering model thruster on a 10 N scale was designed. The thruster was modularized with three different components: a showerhead-type injector; a catalyst bed; and a combustion chamber. The injector had four holes and the diameter of each hole was 0.33 mm. It should be noticed that the design of the injector herein was not optimized to quench the combustion reactions. Further research should be performed to select an appropriate design for the injector. A distributor was placed between the catalyst bed and combustion chamber to prevent the pellets being swept out. The size of the pellet was identical to that of the pellet used in the reactor test, but a non-lanthanum-doped catalyst was prepared for the firing test. Because the feasibility of the catalytic ignition of HPM-08 was confirmed with the lanthanum-doped manganese oxide catalyst, it was expected that the non-lanthanum-doped catalyst may provide a higher reaction rate, because the BET surface area of the latter was higher than that of the former [13]. It was also noticed that this approach would be worthwhile to confirm an opportunity for replacing the conventional noble metal catalysts such platinum. The pellets in the catalyst bed were changed after finishing individual firing tests for HPM-08, HPM-12, and HPM-20. In order words, the same catalyst pellets were used during the cold start and restart tests for each mixture. The design value of the chamber pressure was 10 bar. In this study, the designated mass flow rate of the HPM mixtures was approximately 8 g/s, and the actual mass flow rate was estimated based on the differential pressure of the injector. K-type thermocouples were used for the temperature sensors. Piezoresistive pressure transmitters (the PSHD0030BDPA model made by Sensys) measured the pressure data, with an accuracy of ±0.037% of the maximum operating pressure (30 bar). All measured data were collected by a SCXI module from National Instruments with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and a 40 Hz low pass filtering condition."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic ignition testing in the small-scale reactor,"3.1 Catalytic ignition testing in the small-scale reactor Figure 5 shows the test results of the small-scale packed-bed reactor with the HPM-08 mixture. The timescales of the results indicate the cumulative time from the moment when the data acquisition began. After confirming if all the signals were normal, the valve was opened. The moment when the valve was initially opened was marked at the figure as ‘Injection’. After opening the valve, the propellant was immediately injected into the catalyst bed. On the basis of that the reaction temperatures began to decline immediately after approaching the maximum values, the valve was manually closed. In the case of the cold start condition, without preheating of the catalyst bed, the HPM-08 was automatically ignited through the catalytic reactions with the lanthanum-doped manganese oxide. Through the quartz window, the flame was clearly observed. When the temperatures inside the catalyst bed approached 50 °C after finishing the cold start test, the test was repeated under the same conditions. During the restart test, the catalytic ignition was visually confirmed again and the reaction temperatures increased more rapidly from 10 to 20 s. The rapid increase of the reaction temperatures was likely to result from the existence of combustible residues inside the catalyst bed. The difference in the initial temperatures between the cold start (20 °C) and the restart (50 °C) also seemed to accelerate the catalytic reactions. Considering that the difference among the initial temperatures was relatively marginal, it was presumed that the combustible residues had a more dominant effect on the overall reactions. The thermocouple T2, located in the middle of the catalyst, showed the highest value. Although the catalytic ignition of HPM-08 occurred, the value of the highest temperature was similar to the adiabatic decomposition temperature of 90 wt.% H2O2. It seems that the rate of heat loss through the small-scale reactor was relatively high under the designated mass flow rate. The feasibility of the catalytic ignition of HPM-08 was conclusively verified."
7,HPM-08 firing test,"3.2 HPM-08 firing test Based on the small-scale reactor tests, static hot-firing tests of HPM-08 were performed with the 10 N scale thruster. Non-lanthanum-doped manganese oxide was prepared as the catalyst. At first, the cold start firing test (without preheating the catalyst bed) was conducted for 10 s. After the cold start test, the test was repeated for 5 s under the same conditions when the temperatures inside the catalyst bed were below 100 °C. Figure 6 provides images captured during the cold start test. When the HPM-08 was injected into the catalyst bed, transparent gas was generated due to the catalytic decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide contained in the mixture (see (1) in Fig. 6(a)). Once the temperature inside the catalyst bed approached the auto-ignition temperature of tetraglyme (200 °C), catalytic ignition occurred. The moment could be confirmed when the flame was initially captured at the exit of the nozzle (see (2) in Fig. 6(a)). Because the combustion temperature was extremely high, the stainless-steel mesh-type distributor was damaged at some point (see (3) in Fig. 6(a)). Despite this structural issue, steady-state operation was continuously maintained even in the restart test (see (4) in Fig. 6(a)). Figure 6(b) describes the data of the static hot-firing tests. The timescales of the data indicate the cumulative time from the moment when the data acquisition began. Again, after confirming if all the signals were normal, the valve was opened. The moment when the propellant was initially injected was marked as ‘Injection’ on the basis of the response of P1. Considering the pressure rise from 0 to 90% of the chamber pressure in the steady state, the rise of the chamber pressure in the cold start test (1.3 s) was much slower than that of the restart test (47 ms). Compared with the results of the small-scale reactor, the combustible residues remaining in the catalyst bed may enhance the initiation of the catalytic ignition by supplying additional heat energy during the decomposition process. In addition, the pressure oscillations in the restart test were relatively intense compared to those of the cold firing test. The pressure instability may have been triggered due to the structural damage of the distributor. The combustion efficiency of the restart condition was approximately 35% in terms of the characteristic velocity (C*) efficiency; the C* efficiency represents the degree of completion of the energy release. The combustion efficiency was significantly low because the actual chamber length seemed too short to complete the combustion reactions. For reference, the characteristic chamber length (L*) of the experimental thruster was 15 cm; the characteristic chamber length is defined as the ratio of the chamber volume to the nozzle throat area. Consequently, the optimum design of the thruster for premixed monopropellant should be different from the conventional design of monopropellant thrusters. Most of the volume of the conventional monopropellant thrusters is assigned to the catalyst bed because the efficiency of the catalytic decomposition is the dominant factor in determining the performance of the thrusters. However, for premixed monopropellants, the volume of the catalyst bed should be reduced not only to avoid thermal damage of the catalyst pellets, but also to secure the volume of the combustion chamber. After the initiation of the catalytic ignition in the catalyst bed, it is important to optimize the volume of the combustion chamber to increase combustion efficiency. Additionally, the spray characteristics of the propellant could be a technical issue for the low performance. The maximum temperatures experienced by T1 and T3 were beyond the maximum measuring range (up to 1260 °C) of the k-type thermocouples. The temperature measured by T2 might be underestimated because of the severe structural damage of the downstream portion of the catalyst bed, which may cause unreliable values to be provided. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was performed based on the catalyst pellets located at the bottom of the catalyst bed in order to quantitatively investigate the variation in the catalyst performance. Before the hot-firing tests, the BET results of the non-lanthanum-doped manganese oxide catalyst was approximately 49.6 m2/g, but the active surface area of the catalyst considerably decreased to 12.6 m2/g after the tests. As a result, the surface area of the catalyst was remarkably reduced because the catalyst pellets were exposed to an excessive heat environment due to the combustion process inside the catalyst bed. The surface area of the alumina (Al2O3)-based catalyst support can be significantly decreased by the phase change of the alumina as the environmental temperature is increased [13]. Therefore, the thermal durability of the catalyst should be included as an important design element for premixed monopropellant thrusters."
8,Firing test of HPM-12 and detonation hazard of HPM-20,"3.3 Firing test of HPM-12 and detonation hazard of HPM-20 To endure the structural damage inflicted on the mesh-type distributor, an Inconel perforated plate was prepared and assembled with a stainless-steel mesh. Figure 7 shows images of the cold start test with HPM-12. During the firing test, it was found that the structure of the distributor was thermally damaged again (see (1) in Fig. 7). Despite the efforts of the researchers, severe damage on the distributor was unavoidable with this engineering model. Therefore, in the case of both HPM-12 and HPM-20, the restart test was not implemented. Each cold start test was performed for 10 s. Nevertheless, the steady-state operation of the thruster was clearly confirmed (see (2) in Fig. 7). Figure 8 denotes the changes in the downstream portion of the catalyst bed and the structure of the distributor before and after the test. The catalyst pellets were partially melted due to the extremely high temperature environment associated with the combustion between hydrogen peroxide and tetraglyme. The color change of the pellets may be due to coke formation. Figure 9 presents the firing data of both HPM-12 and HPM-20. There could be two factors for the time lag between the P1 data and the other data (approximately for 0.4∼0.5 s) at the beginning of the operation. Firstly, there was the dribble volume in between the pressure sensor (P1) and the upper part of the catalyst bed. Secondly, additional time delay could be caused due to the ignition delay of the catalytic reactions. Considering the cold start data with HPM-08 (see Fig. 6(b)), the overall time delays for the individual tests seem to be similar regardless of the compositions of the propellants. From that point of view, it was reasonably presumed that the dribble volume was likely to be the main influence on the time lag, otherwise there might be some differences on the ignition delays depending on the compositions of the propellants. In the case of HPM-12, the temperatures at the downstream portion of the catalyst bed and the chamber reached the maximum value of the thermocouples. After 2 s from the beginning, the pressure oscillations intensified. The pressure instabilities could be attributed to both the performance degradation of the catalyst pellets and the structural damage of the distributor. In the case of HPM-20, an explosion was caused after approximately 0.5 s on the basis of an initial temperature rise. The pressure spikes implied that strong shock waves occurred inside the thruster. After the explosion, the propellant feed system was totally destroyed. For reference, the maximum pressure of the propellant tank used in this study (Swagelok 304L-HDF4-300) was approximately 124 bar, and the structure totally disintegrated and fell apart (see Fig. 10 ). In addition, the check valve in the feed line, the maximum pressure of which was 3000 psi (approximately 207 bar), was also fatally damaged. Conversely, the thruster was apparently damaged on the injector face only (see Fig. 9). There were various and complex causes of the explosion. Diverse flashback mechanisms could be suspected to be the reasons. For instance, strong pressure waves could be generated by hard ignition of the mixture in the catalyst bed. Herein, the hard ignition means that the flammable fuel substances vaporized by the exothermic reactions of H2O2 decomposition would violently ignited with the decomposition gasses of the oxidizer within an extremely short time. Due to the pressure waves, the flow in the injector head stagnated or was reduced for a moment, which could allow a flame to enter the upstream injector part and ignite the premixed propellant in the feeding line. In that case, the rapid increase of the pressure in the thruster module may be the major reason, but it is still ambiguous how the hard ignition exactly occurred and what the mechanism of the upstream propagation of the flame was. In the present study, we suggest a technical speculation based on both the experimental data captured in the explosion site and on relevant previous research [9,13–19]. The speculation presents the possibility that the explosion was related to detonation phenomena associated with the inherent structure of the packed-bed type catalyst bed. Based on the structural failures, it was presumed that the phenomenon of deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) was initially triggered between the injector face and the catalyst bed and then the detonation wave propagated upstream where the premixed propellant was present in the feed line. In other words, we focused the speculation that the deflagration-to-detonation transition could be caused by physical interactions between the flow path and the catalyst pellets. Detail descriptions are included in the following discussion. In the present research, a serious endeavor had been made to analyze the reasons for the occurrence of the detonation phenomena. Firstly, it was reported that detonation could be caused with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and hydrocarbon fuels [14]. According to the blasting cap tests in previous research [14], the mixture of 90 wt.% hydrogen peroxide and ethanol severely destroyed the experimental pipe due to the propagation of strong pressure waves. However, the pure hydrogen peroxide caused the local structural failure of the pipe, which had a similar effect to water vapor expansion in the pipe. The test results imply that the explosion of pure hydrogen peroxide itself could not supply enough energy to maintain the propagation of the pressure waves. Secondly, it should be noted that pre-mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and hydrocarbon fuels would not cause detonation in all situations [9]. The most important factor was the oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio in a specific pre-mixture. In previous research [9], the detonability ranges of alcohol/H2O2 pre-mixtures were described. The ranges were experimentally investigated with thermal explosion vessel tests. As a secondary alcohol, 2-propanol was used. 2-methyl-2-propanol (TBA), 2-methyl-2-butanol (TAA), and 2-methyl-2-pentanol (THA) were utilized as tertiary alcohols. According to the data presented [9], the detonability varied with specific mixture ratios depending on the type of chemicals. Compared to the secondary alcohol, the detonability ranges of the tertiary alcohols became larger. In this study, the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio of HPM-20 was close to the value of the stoichiometry (see Fig. 1). As the mixture ratio becomes closer to the stoichiometry, detonation occurs more easily, caused by a higher rate of chemical energy release. Moreover, one thing that requires further attention is that the detonability range of a given pre-mixture can be sensitively varied depending on both test conditions and measurement setups. For instance, it was found that the detonability range of the pre-mixture of hydrogen peroxide and 2-propanol was significantly changed depending on the measurement conditions such as the type of test vessel used and the heating rates of the samples [9]. In short, it could be difficult to specifically define the detonability range of the HPM-20 mixture because the range would change significantly depending on the test conditions, especially for the actual hot-firing tests. Lastly, the chemical and physical interactions between HPM-20 and the catalyst may be one of the principal causes of the initiation of the detonation phenomena. To the best of our knowledge, few researchers have addressed the technical issue. For the chemical interactions, previous research has reported that a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and acetone could be detonated by chemical interactions with an acid catalyst [15]. It is claimed that the intermediate products, triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and diacetone diperoxide (DADP), of the catalytic reactions were notably sensitive to explosion. As for manganese oxides, MnOx was a type of base catalyst and Mn2O7 was a type of strong acid catalyst [16]. In the present study, the major active material of the catalyst was MnOx [13], and it was difficult to find any obvious evidence of the intermediate explosive products of the catalytic reactions. The physical interactions between the flow path and the catalyst pellets, rather than the chemical interactions, were focused on in this study. There were two possibilities related to the physical interactions. The first was that the molten catalyst pellets placed in the catalyst bed may clog the flow path so that very high pressure immediately built up between the injector face and the catalyst bed. However, the simple phenomenon of the pressure rise is unlikely to be the main reason, because the measured temperatures just before the explosion were not high enough to melt the catalyst pellets. A further possibility is related to the inherent structure of the packed-bed type catalyst bed containing numerous millimeter-scale pellets. The configuration of the catalyst pellets was able to enhance the DDT by accelerating the superposition of subsonic pressure waves generated by the catalytic reactions. When the flammable gas mixtures were generated by the exothermic catalytic reactions in the catalyst bed, the gas mixtures started to be rapidly expanded. Once the catalytic ignition occurred, the flammable gas mixtures simultaneously burnt and the flame violently propagated into the narrow gaps between the pellets. Subsequently, the process of the compressive heating of the pressure waves could be accelerated. DDT can be triggered by a complex interaction of pressure waves, turbulence, pockets of unburned mixture, interactions with obstacles, etc. In this respect, the configuration of the catalyst pellets can play a similar role as the Schelkin spiral in the pulse detonation engine (PDE). By inserting the spiral structure into the PDE, the DDT was deliberately accelerated due to the superposition of the subsonic combustion waves [17]. It was also reported that porous media could accelerate the DDT and detonation propagation [18,19]. According to the results in the previous research [19], porous media can promote explosion escalation unless the flame is not quenched (the phenomenon in obstacle-laden channels). Herein, the flame inside the catalyst bed would not be quenched due to the exothermic reactions of the catalyst. As a result, we can speculate that the configuration of the packed-bed catalytic reactor could enhance the DDT in the catalyst bed. During operation with HPM-20, the DDT may occur at the location between the injector face and the upper stream of the catalyst bed. The local temperature and pressure were sharply increased by the rapid compressive heating process based on the superposition of the pressure waves. The response time of the sensors used in this study was not sufficient to accurately capture the phenomenon of DDT. In contrast with previous studies related to porous media [19], in this study, the vapor of HPM-20 was not likely to fully spread out in the downstream portion of the catalyst bed at the moment the explosion was triggered. Even though the leading shock wave was initially generated in the upstream portion of the catalyst bed by the superposition of the pressure waves, the leading shock wave seems to be insufficiently strong to directly initiate detonation. By interacting through the injector face and the upper part of the catalyst bed, strong reflected shock waves may be generated instantly leading to the detonation phenomena being propagated upstream. In conclusion, the design of the catalyst bed and combustion chamber should be carefully determined when HPM mixtures are utilized as green energetic monopropellants. Moreover, a new ignition technology may be applied for the application of such a premixed energetic monopropellant."
9,Conclusions,"Efforts were made in the present study to seek a promising candidate for a green energetic monopropellant consisting of hydrogen peroxide-based mixture. 90 wt.% H2O2 was used as the main solvent and tetraglyme, as a fuel, was blended into the solvent. Different mixture ratios were prepared by varying the weight percent of the fuel in the mixture, and the mixtures were named as HPM-08 (8 wt.% of fuel), HPM-12 (12 wt.% of fuel), and HPM-20 (20 wt.% of fuel). The theoretical performance of the HPMs was estimated, and their thermostability in air was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. The feasibility test of the catalytic ignition of HPM-08 was performed by a small-scale packed-bed catalytic reactor with a lanthanum-doped manganese oxide catalyst. The catalytic ignition of HPM-08 was successfully demonstrated. Ground hot-firing tests of HPMs were conducted with an engineering model monopropellant thruster on the scale of 10 N. Non-lanthanum-doped manganese oxide was utilized for the firing tests. Despite the active surface area of the catalyst being considerably decreased during the tests due to an excessively high temperature environment resulting from the combustion reaction inside the catalyst bed, the steady-state operation of the thruster was confirmed with HPM-08 and HPM-12 without preheating of the catalyst bed. However, in the case of HPM-20, an explosion was caused during the hot-firing test. The detonation may have been caused by the phenomenon of DDT between the injector and the catalyst bed. Herein, it was speculated that the configuration of the catalyst bed could be regarded as the principal cause of the explosion in the thruster module. The packed-bed type catalyst bed containing numerous millimeter-scale pellets may have accelerated the phenomenon of DDT, resulting from the rapid compressive heating process based on the superposition of the pressure waves. The results should be taken into account when designing catalyst beds for utilizing this type of green energetic monopropellant. In addition, a new ignition technique may be required to prevent the explosion."
