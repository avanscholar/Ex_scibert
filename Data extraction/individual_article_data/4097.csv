0,Introduction,"Nitrate and nitrite (NOX -) are Class 2A carcinogens (October 27, 2017, World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer), which were annually emitted in a huge amount from the fields of industry, agriculture, food and fuel, causing serious NOX - water pollution worldwide (Yang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). Compared with nitrate, nitrite exhibits higher biotoxicity and carcinogenicity, a low environmental concentration (10 mg L-1) will cause severe damage to organisms (Ma et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018). The World Health Organization (WHO) standard for drinking water is 50 mg L− 1-NO3 - and 3 mg L− 1-NO2 -, respectively. Notably, studies have confirmed that nitrate entering the body through diet can be converted to nitrite or nitrosamine by microbes, thereby endangering human health (such as methemoglobinemia) (Ashok et al., 2015; Stayner et al., 2017). Therefore, green and effective approaches capable of completely removing NOX - or reducing them below the toxic threshold is urgently needed to safely improve the water quality. Removal techniques of NOX - include physical transfer, biological denitrification and chemical reduction. Physical transfer (e.g., adsorption, ion exchange, reverse osmosis and electrodialysis) and anaerobic microbial reaction are efficient in NOX - removal and convert. Unfortunately, the secondary concentrate sewage streams and slow denitrification decrease their application effectiveness (Barroso-Solares et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020). In contrast, chemical reduction is always preferred when addressing sudden pollution and point source pollution due to its short operating cycle and wide application range (Cheng et al., 2020; Shih et al., 2020). Thus, the researches represented by photocatalytic reduction, zero-valent iron reduction, electrochemical reduction and catalytic hydrogenation have received increasing attention. While photocatalytic reduction has high NOX - removal efficiency and N2 selectivity, the water quality (transparency, turbidity, etc.) requirements and low light energy utilization should be concerned (Wang et al., 2021; Zazo et al., 2020). Zero-valent iron reduction is considered as promising approach because of the low equipment requirements and simple operation (Ji et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2010). Nanoscale, doped and vulcanized zero-valent iron catalysts have been synthesized to improve the catalyst activity and stability (Hamid et al., 2015; Liu and Wang, 2019). Notably, applying of the toxic reducing agent (i.e., NaBH4) and operating in a weak acidic environment hampered the industrial application of this technique (Diao et al., 2019). Electrochemical reduction can efficiently eliminate NOX - from water via electron transfer, over-potential or the generated atomic hydrogen (H∗), which strongly depends on the physical properties of cathode materials (Lan et al., 2015). Thus, delicately modified cathode containing noble metals or transition metals are widely studied (Liu et al., 2019). Currently, the high process and stability of cathode materials are still the open issues (Jonoush et al., 2020; Mattarozzi et al., 2020). For catalytic hydrogenation, the hydrogen molecules adsorbed on the catalyst can be activated into high-energy hydrogen adatoms (Hads∗) (Guo et al., 2017), thereby accelerating the hydrogenation reaction. Noble metal catalysts applied frequently owning to the good affinity with hydrogen (Tokazhanov et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the cost and abundance of noble metals remain a realistic issue that must be considered. R–Ni is a hydrogenation catalyst with foam porous structure (Ma et al., 2015), and can be readily obtained by immersing Ni–Al (1:1) alloy in concentrated sodium hydroxide (Devred et al., 2009). However, the application of R–Ni catalyst in the field of water pollution control is limited to hydrodehalogenation, and studies on NOX - reduction have not been reported till now (Ma et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020b). In addition, hydrogen, as a commonly used hydrogen source in catalytic hydrogenation, still has the problems of large consumption and low atomic economic efficiency (Tokazhanov et al., 2020). Previous studies showed that the hydrogenation of R–Ni can be carried out efficiently in an alkaline environment with continuous supply of Com-H2 (Ma et al., 2010). Inspired by electrochemical reduction, the cathode electrolysis of water will produce tiny Nas-H2 bubbles and a strong alkaline environment simultaneously (Liu et al., 2020). Whether hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can drive R–Ni to realize efficient NOX - reduction, and how Nas-H2 will produce different catalytic effects from Com-H2 is a research topic worthy of study. This work aimed at designing a promising NOX − reduction system that can efficiently utilize hydrogen sources in the absence of noble metals. In particular, divided-cell reactor was designed to perform NOX − reduction under the action of R–Ni and Nas-H2. To explore the optimal reduction conditions, the effects of current density and catalyst dosage on the reduction of NOX − were investigated. At selected conditions, the interferences of initial NOX − concentration, humic acid concentration and water hardness were studied and the performance of Nas-H2 driven catalytic hydrogenation system was evaluated through comparison with Com-H2. Furthermore, the migration and transformation of nitrogenous substances were determined by ion chromatography and total nitrogen analyzer, and the possible reduction pathway of NOX − was proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All the commercially available regents used in our experiments were analytical grade without further purification. Raney nickel catalyst (90% Ni) was obtained from Shanghai Shaoyuan reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Sodium nitrate (99%) was bought from Shandong XIYA chemical Co., Ltd (Shandong, China). Sodium nitrite (99%), potassium sulfate anhydrous (99%), and methanesulfonic acid (99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, ammonia chloride and sodium hydroxide were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Humic acid (98%) was purchased from Bailingwei Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). High purity commercial hydrogen gas was purchased from Dongguan Teqi Gas Co., Ltd (Dongguan, China)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization R–Ni has highly reactive and ignites spontaneously when dried, thus it is usually stored in water or ethanol solution. To investigate the morphology and composition of the catalyst, the following characterization analysis was performed on the air-passivated R–Ni. The micromorphology of purchased catalyst was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Sigma 500, Jena, Germany). A lower electron energy (EHT = 5.00 kV) was selected to avoid damaging the surface morphology of the R–Ni catalyst, and the working distance (WD) was 8.5 mm. To grasp the morphological information of the catalyst more comprehensively, FESEM images with magnifications of 1.00 KX, 10.00 KX and 30.00 KX were taken. The specific surface area and average pore size of the R–Ni catalyst were determined by nitrogen elution adsorption curve with brunauer-emmett-teller (BET, ASAP 2460, Atlanta, America). Before analysis, the samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature for 16 h. R–Ni crystallographic structure was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, BRUKER D8 Advance, Madison, USA). Samples were mounted on a zero-background sample holder. Diffraction patterns were collected in the 2θ range of 5–90° using a step size of 5° min−1, and the obtained catalyst diffraction pattern was compared with element standard comparison card. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha, Massachusetts, USA) experiments were performed on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe with an Al Kα X-ray source. The core electrons of Ni 2p, Ni 3p, Ni 2s and Al 2p, Al 2s were detected. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, BRUKER OPTICS LUMOS, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to analyze the adsorption behavior of humic acid on R–Ni catalyst. The powder samples were dried in a vacuum at 60 °C and placed directly on the sample table. Liquid nitrogen was used as the detector coolant during scanning."
4,Device and operation,"2.3 Device and operation A proton-exchange membrane (N211, DuPont, USA) electrolyzer was applied. The electrolyte was 20 mM potassium sulfate. As presented in Fig. 1 , Ti plate was used as cathode and was parallel to the Ti/RuO2–IrO2 anode. The effective working area was 30 × 30 mm2, and the distance between the two electrodes was 2.0 cm. Electric energy was supplied by regulated DC power (DH1718G, Beijing, China), and uniform mass transfer was ensured by magnetic stirring (IKA RCT basic, Staufen, Germany). Batch hydrogenation experiments were performed by adding an electrolyte (90 mL) containing 3.0 mM of NOX - into the cathode chamber, and an equal amount of electrolyte in the anode chamber. In detail, to obtain the optimal reaction conditions, the effects of current value (0.00–0.16 A) and catalyst concentration (0.0–1.5 g L-1) on NOX - reduction were investigated via single factor analysis. The impacts of interfering factors, i.e. initial NOX - concentration (1.0–5.0 mM), humic acid concentration (0–50 mg L-1), and water hardness (Ca2+ + Mg2+: 0–40 mM) were discussed under selected current value and R–Ni dosage. The humic acid stock solution (500 mg L-1) was prepared with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution, and water hardness was adjusted by Ca2+ (CaCl2) and Mg2+ (MgCl2) concentration. Furthermore, the improved hydrogenation system was assessed by studying the hydrogenation activity and reaction mechanism. Throughout the NOX -removal experiments, the rotor speed was fixed at 900 r min-1. At given time intervals, 1.0 mL of aqueous sample was collected through a 0.22 μm PES filter. All samples were measured within 24 h. The concentrations of NO3 -, NO2 - and NH4 + were monitored by ion chromatography (ICS-5000+, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA); TN was identified by total organic carbon analyzer (TOC, Elementar vario TOC, Hanau, Germany); Catalyst dissolution were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; ICAP RQ, Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, USA). The specific instrument parameters and operating conditions are presented in Table S1, and the ion chromatograms and standard curves are shown in Fig. S1."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of R–Ni catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of R–Ni catalyst As shown in Fig. 2 A, R–Ni exhibits an irregular block structure with rough surface. The FESEM images with higher magnification present that the inside of the particles was a loose sponge structure (Fig. 2B–C). These are attributed to the dissolution of the aluminum phase during R–Ni preparation, which provides a large surface area and a sufficient number of active sites (Devred et al., 2009). Furthermore, the specific surface area measured by BET was 10.02 m2 g−1, and the average pore size was 8.53 nm. In the XRD pattern diagram, 44.35°, 52.10°, 76.76° could be indexed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of Ni crystal (04–0850) (Solmaz et al., 2016), and no other diffraction peaks were detected. The good crystal form of Ni gives R–Ni excellent magnetic properties. To verify the composition and surface elemental state of R–Ni, XPS analysis was carried out (Fig. 2E). The obvious O1s peak (531.5 eV) in the binding energy spectrum indicates that the catalyst surface has been fully oxidized and passivated. The 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 energy spectra of Ni were obtained by high resolution scanning, and three fitting peaks were constructed respectively for the two atomic states in the Ni 2p orbital. The lower binding energy peaks located at 852.2 eV and 869.3 eV were assigned to elemental Ni. In contrast, the binding energy peaks at 855.8 eV and 873.5 eV were attributed to Ni–O, 861.1 eV and 879.8 eV were allocated to Ni–OH (Sakamoto et al., 2020). The high proportion of Ni–O and Ni–OH indicates the strong affinity between R–Ni and oxygen, which indirectly reflects that: 1) R–Ni exhibits high surface energy and activity; 2) The oxidation inactivation should be avoided during the application of R–Ni. Furthermore, Ni 3p (68.8 eV), Al 2p (74.3 eV), Ni 3s (114.0eV) and Al 2s (119.1 eV) were also detected, they were ascribed to the unreacted Ni–Al phase during the preparation of R–Ni (Rong et al., 2014)."
7,Reduction of NOx-,"3.2 Reduction of NOx- 3.2.1 Effects of current value and R–Ni dosage on NOx-reduction The effects of current values on hydrogenation reduction of NOx - were recorded at 1.0 g L−1 of R–Ni addition. As shown in Fig. 3 A–B, the decreases in the concentrations of NO3 - (26.1%) and NO2 - (30.2%) could be observed in the first 20 min when current value is 0.00 A. It reveals that R–Ni itself exhibits certain catalytic activity because the adsorbed hydrogen in the pore structure during the preparation process (Devred et al., 2009). After 20 min, the concentrations of NO3 - and NO2 - barely changed as the adsorbed hydrogen in R–Ni was exhausted. The removal rates of NO3 - and NO2 - increase obviously (from around 30%–100%) as increasing current values from 0.00 A to 0.12 A. It can be explained that abundant Nas-H2 produced by high current value can form more reactive species at sufficient R–Ni active sites. Notably, the conversion rates of NO3 - and NO2 - change slightly when the current is higher than 0.12 A, implying that Nas-H2 production has been basically saturated with R–Ni hydrogenation activity. Based on the above experimental results, the current value was set at 0.12 A for studying the effects of R–Ni dosages on NOX - reduction. As shown in Fig. 3C–D, 17.5% of NO3 - and 20.1% of NO2 - were reduced by Nas-H2 within 90 min in the absence of R–Ni catalyst. The results show that Nas-H2 owns the potential to hydrogenate NOX −, but Nas-H2 alone cannot effectively remove NO3 - and NO2 - in a short time. Furthermore, the reduction rates of NO3 - and NO2 - increase significantly (>30%) with addition of R–Ni (0.2 g L-1), and the hydrogenation rates of NOX − are proportional to the catalyst dosages. This can be attributed to the increasing active sites when adding more R–Ni, leading to high activation efficiency of Nas-H2, which promotes the production of Hads∗. Compared with NO3 -, NO2 - is more easily hydrogenated and has a higher reduction efficiency under the corresponding reaction conditions. This is primarily because the valence determines the number of electrons required for reduction (Zhang et al., 2018). To achieve the same reduction effect, NO2 - obviously needs less e− than NO3 - (as Eqs: 1–2), thereby NO2 - is more readily to be reduced under the same catalytic hydrogenation conditions. (1) 3NO3 − + 18e−→ N2 + NH4 + (2) 3NO2 − + 12e−→ N2 + NH4 + For the kinetics analysis, NOX − hydrogenation reduction follows the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics due to the good linear relationship between ln(C 0/C t) and t. The related data are recorded in Table 1 and the curves of ln(C 0/C t) on t are shown in Fig.S2. The reaction rate constants(k) of NO2 - was always greater than that of NO3 - under the corresponding reaction conditions, indicating that NO2 - was easier to hydrogenate than NO3 -. In addition, when the current reached 0.12 A, the k value no longer increased significantly with increasing current value. Correspondingly, the k value increased continuously as the increasing dosage of catalyst, implying that the activation efficiency of Nas-H2 was further improved as the increasing catalyst dosage. For the identification of active species, the quenching experiments of tert-butanol on Nas-H2 and R–Ni/Nas-H2 systems were performed (Fig. S3). As previously reported, hydrogen atoms (H∗) can be quenched by tert-butanol (Mao et al., 2019). In Fig. S3, the reduction rates of NO3 - and NO2 - did not change significantly as 100 mM tert-butanol was added to the reaction systems, indicating that H∗ were not the main active species in these two systems. According to the catalytic hydrogenation reaction mechanism (Guo et al., 2017; Munoz et al., 2017), the Hads∗ were considered to be the active species in the system. Hads∗ exists in the form of metal-hydride, so it will not be affected significantly by alcohol quenchers (Ma et al., 2015; Rahamim et al., 2019). In addition, previous experiments proved that the removal of halogen atoms in organic halogen compounds cannot be achieved under the action of Nas-H2, suggesting that Nas-H2 generated on Ti cathode is essentially highly dispersed hydrogen molecules and does not contain active hydrogen species (Wang et al., 2020b). In summary, the effective hydrogenation can only be achieved when R–Ni and Nas-H2 coexist, and any factor that can promote the formation of Hads∗ can accelerate the occurrence of NOX − reduction. Specifically, the demand concentration of hydrogen sources has a saturation value at fixed catalyst dosage. The amount of Nas-H2 is the rate-controlling step of the reaction as the current is lower than the saturation value (0.12 A), conversely, the catalyst activity becomes a rate limiting step when the current is higher than the saturation value. The optimal Nas-H2 supply can be determined by adjusting the current value, thereby achieving the quantitative consumption of hydrogen source. The complete removal of NOX - was detected within 90 min at 1.0 g L−1 of R–Ni dosage, thus the reaction conditions of I = 0.12 A and C(R–Ni) = 1.0 g L−1 were selected for the following experiments. 3.2.2 Performance evaluation of R–Ni/Nas-H2 hydrogenation system The effects of NOX − initial concentration are presented in Fig. S4, NOX - was completely reduced at the initial concentration range 1.0–3.0 mM. The residual NOX - was detected with the increasing initial concentration from 3.0 mM to 5.0 mM, implying that efficient NOX-removal requires a suitable ratio of Hads∗ to NOX -. In addition, R–Ni could maintain 94.6% catalytic activity in the fifth cycle after magnetic recovery experiments, showing a high stability and good application potential (Fig. S4). Considering the complex composition of the actual water environment, the effects of humic acid concentration and water hardness on NO3 − hydrogenation were specially studied (Fig. S5). As a result, humic acid concentration (0–50 mg L−1) hardly effected the reduction rates of NO3 -. Additionally, no obvious adsorption of humic acid on the R–Ni surface was observed by FTIR analyses (Fig. S5C). The above results show that the reduction system has excellent resistance to dissolved humic acid. In contrast, the hydrogenation reduction ratio of NO3 - decrease to 60.8% as the increasing content of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the cathode solution. XRD characterization shows that Ca2+ and Mg2+ precipitated out and covered the characteristic crystal plane of R–Ni as the increasing alkalinity of the catholyte (Fig. S5D). Compared with traditional catalytic hydrogenation, the improved system can be operated at ambient temperature without adding extra alkali into the reaction system (Cobo et al., 2015; Weidlich et al., 2012). Herein, the differences in catalytic activity of Nas-H2 and Com-H2 as reducing agents were compared at initial NO3 - concentration of 3.0 mM. The theoretical Nas-H2 production rate is about 0.8 mL min−1 at current of 0.12 A (Eqs: 3–8). For comparison, Com-H2 was introduced at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. (3) Q = I × t = 0.12 A × 60 s = 7.2 C (4) N e = Q / e − = 4.5 × 10 19 e − = 1.6 × 10 − 19 C (5) 2H+ + 2e− = H2 (6) N ( H 2 ) = N e / 2 = 2.25 × 10 19 (7) M ( H 2 ) = N ( H 2 ) / ( 6.02 × 10 23 ) ∼ 0.37375 × 10 − 4 mol (8) V H 2 = M H 2 × 22 . 4 ∼ 0 . 84 mL min - 1 In Fig. 4 A, the final conversion ratios of NO3 − were 0.0%, 3.2% and 17.5% in blank, Com-H2 and Nas-H2 experimental systems without R–Ni catalyst, respectively. The result indicates that Nas-H2 has higher activity than Com-H2. To explain the phenomenon, the existence form of hydrogen in the reaction solution was studied by the Tyndall effect. In Fig. 4A, the Tyndall effect is hardly observed in the blank experiment, and a weak Tyndall effect can be observed under the continuous introduction of a large amount of Com-H2. In particular, an obvious pathway is clearly observed in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) solution, indicating that HER generated more micro/nano-sized Nas-H2 bubbles in the solution. The micro/nano-sized Nas-H2 bubbles exhibits a larger contact area and surface energy than the Com-H2 (Hu et al., 2018), which will efficiently improve the activity of hydrogen source. Correspondingly, the final conversion ratios of NO3 − were 26.1%, 43.6% and 100% in the blank, Com-H2 and Nas-H2 experimental systems at 1.0 g L−1 of R–Ni dosage. This work suggests that the refined Nas-H2 bubbles present higher activation efficiency, leading the formation of more reactive radicals (Hads∗). In the context of research on the preparation of highly active catalysts (Liang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2019), this work provides a new insight (refine the hydrogen source) into improving the catalytic hydrogenation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4B, the pH of the catholyte rapidly rise to around 12.0 within 10 min, and eventually stabilizes at around 12.5. It can be considered that the entire hydrogenation reaction occurred under alkaline conditions. After the reaction, the solution was filtered and directly analyzed by ICP-MS. Both Al ions (3537 μg L−1) and Mo ions (137 μg L−1) were detected, but no Ni ions were detected in the filtrate due to the strong alkaline environment. As reported, Al is derived from the unreacted aluminum phase during the preparation of R–Ni catalyst from nickel-aluminum alloy, and Mo is an artificially added promoter metal (Gryglewicz et al., 2011; Wolf et al., 2016). It implies that the skeleton structure of Ni in R–Ni catalyst is maintained during the alkaline environment. This is consistent with previous research (Ma et al., 2020). Meanwhile, according to the Al phase dissolution reaction: 2Al + 2H2O + 2OH− → 2 AlO2 − + 3H2, it can be found that the dissolution of Al phase will destroy the inherent framework of R–Ni. In addition, this may also generate new active sites and hydrogen sources (see Fig. 4B). Both of them are beneficial to the maintenance of R–Ni activity. The above results and discussion correspond well to the researches that R–Ni exhibits higher catalytic activity in alkaline environment (Ma et al., 2015). Overall, the HER-supported R–Ni catalytic hydrogenation system shows excellent application potential in reducing NOX -. First, the refined Nas-H2 improves the activation efficiency of hydrogen source; Second, the alkaline environment ensures the stability and activity of R–Ni catalyst. This study compensates for the shortcomings of poor activity of zero-valent iron catalysts under alkaline conditions, and exhibits certain research value for expanding the pH range to repair water environment by reduction technology. Moreover, Al ions and Mo ions are nontoxic while Ni ions are toxic (Dai et al., 2018). Thus, this work avoids the secondary pollution caused by the dissolution of catalyst during the reaction. 3.2.3 Hydrogenation pathway of NOX - In Fig. 5 A, NH4+ was detected in the cathode solution after the reaction started, and its concentration increased as the decreasing of NOX − concentration. Finally, NO3 - and NO2 - with an initial concentration of 3.0 mM produced 1.88 and 1.74 mM NH4 +, respectively. Taking into account the measurement error caused by precipitation of NH4 + in the alkaline reaction solution, the NH4 + (3 mM) equilibrium experiment was carried out (Fig. 5B). Owning to HER, the pH of the cathode solution eventually stabilizes at around 12.5. Fortunately, no decrease in NH4 + concentration was observed during the experiment. This result shows that in the R–Ni/Nas-H2 catalytic hydrogenation system, NO3 - and NO2 - can be rapidly hydrogenated to produce a considerable amount of NH4 +. The conversion pathways of NOx-during the reduction process were analyzed by ion chromatography and TOC analyzer, the specific data is shown in Fig. 5C–D. The concentrations of NOX − decrease significantly during the first 30 min. Subsequently, the reduction rate starts to slow down, by 90 min, NOX − is almost fully hydrogenated. Correspondingly, NH4 + concentrations increase obviously during the first 30 min, and then slowly increase within 30–90 min. It is generally believed that the transformation from NO3 − to NO2 − is the rate-limiting step of NO3 − reduction (Duca et al., 2012; Shih et al., 2020). However, the concentration accumulation of NO2 − is hardly observed in the NO3 − reduction system, which may be attributed to the good hydrogenation performance of Hads∗ on NO2 −. In addition, TN content in the reaction solution is lower than the initial TN concentration during the reduction reaction, which indicates that partial reduction products of NOX − leaked from the reaction liquid in the form of gaseous nitrogen (G-N). After the reaction, the G-N selectivity in the reduction process of NO3 - and NO2 - were 37.3% and 42.0%, respectively. Summarizing the above discussion, the possible hydrogenation pathways of NOX − are as follow (Eqs: 9–16): (9) H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH− (10) H2 + R–Ni → R–Ni(Hads∗) (11) NOX − + R–Ni → R–Ni(NOX - ads) (12) R–Ni(NOX -ads) + H2 → R–Ni(G-Nads) + R–Ni(NH4 + ads) (13) R–Ni(NOX - ads) + R–Ni(Hads∗) → R–Ni(G-Nads) + R–Ni(NH4 + ads) (14) NOX − + H2 → G-N + NH4 + (15) R–Ni(G-Nads) → R–Ni + G-N (16) R–Ni(NH4 + ads) → R–Ni + NH4 + For the reduction of NOX −, G-N are the most ideal reduction products to achieve effective removal of TN in the water environment. Hydrogenation selectivity toward a specific product is sensitive to the applied approaches. In Table 2 , the different chemical reduction techniques for nitrate reduction are compared. Photo-reduction generally exhibits the highest G-N selectivity, followed by Catal-hydrogenation and Elec-reduction. Zero-valent iron reduction (Fe0-reduction) has the lowest G-N selectivity, and the reaction rates are directly affected by the size of the catalyst. For Catal-hydrogenation, the support types have a significant impact on the selectivity of G-N, and a large amount of Com-H2 (hundreds of times higher than Nas-H2) was require to ensure catalytic hydrogenation activity. Table 2 reflects that this work has similar reaction parameters to Elec-reduction technique. The difference is that this work does not require delicate modification of the cathode and R–Ni catalyst is more suitable for industrial applications. Notably, despite this work had achieved efficient reduction of NOX −, the NH4 + generated during the reaction could still seriously harm the environment and needs further treatment to remove it (Yao et al., 2020). Furthermore, the cathode solution was filtered to remove R–Ni catalyst, and then transferred into the anode chamber. At the same current value (0.12 A), the enhanced oxidative removal of NH4 + was studied by adding Cl− (Fig. S6). The generated NH4 + can be completely removed within 90 min when the Cl− addition amount was 4 mM. The oxidation removal of NH4 + follows zero-order kinetics during 0–60 min, k = 2.5 × 10−2 min−1, and the R 2 values is 0.99. As a result, about 90% of the TN could be removed from NOX − reaction solution after the sequential reduction-oxidation process. In summary, according to the above research results, the conversion of NOX - to NH4 + through the R–Ni/Nas-H2 system can effectively avoid the accumulation of high carcinogen NO2 - in the solution. For massively generated NH4 +, electrochemical studies have shown that NH4 + is easier to be removed from the water environment by converting to N2 than NOX -. This research has certain application value for processing the concentrated NOX - wastewater after physical migration (reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, etc.) or oxidized NOX - wastewater that is difficult to biologically treat."
8,Conclusions,"This study showed that NOX - can be efficiently reduced in R–Ni/Nas-H2 hydrogenation system, much favorable than that in R–Ni/Com-H2 system. Specifically, the introduction of HER composed the following practical significance: (i) achieved the quantitative and efficient supply of available hydrogen source; (ii) ensured the stability of R–Ni while avoided secondary pollution by catalyst dissolution; (iii) improved the activation efficiency of the hydrogen source under alkaline conditions. No large accumulation of highly toxic NO2 − was observed during the reduction of NO3 −. R–Ni coupled Nas-H2 catalytic hydrogenation system provided a new and green approach for the efficient reduction of NOX −, especially in the absence of noble metal catalysts."
