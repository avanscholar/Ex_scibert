0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted much attention for its high conversion efficiency and environmentally friendly. In the traditional methods, hydrogen is mainly generated from fossil fuels, such as natural gas reforming and coal gasification etc [1,2]. In order to improve the renewability and economy of hydrogen production, biomass and its derivatives are widely exploited to produce hydrogen in the catalytic reforming process, among which bio-ethanol and bio-tar are two of most promising renewable resources [3,4]. Bio-ethanol is the most abundant and widely used biofuel by far. The annual yield of ethanol in the world reaches 20–25billions of gallons [5]. Reforming of bio-ethanol is an important method for hydrogen production from renewable resources. Bio-tar, as a by-production or an unavoidable waste during thermal conversion of biomass depending on different processes (up to 70wt% for pyrolysis [6] and up to 20wt% for gasification [7]), is a complicated mixture of hundreds of organic compounds, mainly composing of alcohols, phenols, one-ring aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzene, toluene etc), two-ring aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and 1-methylnaphthalene etc) and so on [8,9]. In addition, the current defects of bio-tar derived from biomass pyrolysis such as high water content, instability of chemical property are particularly suitable for steam reforming technology to product hydrogen. The biomass-derived organics (bio-ethanol and bio-tar) are the promising candidates for hydrogen production in the reforming reaction. The organics contain complex compounds, and the influences of different organics on hydrogen production need further investigation. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as new carbon materials with special physical and chemical characteristic, have numerous potential applications in the areas of biosensors, carbon electronics, hydrogen storage and catalysis etc [10,11]. In recent years, the product capability of CNTs has significantly increased to meet the needs of the above applications. The hydrocarbons (such as methane, ethylene, acetylene, benzene etc) are widely used to produce CNTs by the method of catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) [12]. In our previously published study [13], CNTs yielded remarkably during steam reforming of toluene for hydrogen production. More than 80% of carbon deposition was CNTs at steam/carbon ratio of 2. Furthermore, our results and other published work [14] also proved that the self-growth of CNTs could promote the catalytic activity of Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst and increase the proportion of hydrogen during the reforming process, which means the formation of CNTs could increase the system economic and promote the hydrogen production. Thus, it’s an available innovative pathway to co-production hydrogen and carbon nanotubes through steam reforming of biomass-derived organics. Several kinds of biomass-derived organics (ethanol [15,16] and toluene [17]) were investigated for the production of hydrogen and CNTs in the decomposition or reforming reaction. The organics possess different molecular structure (aromatic ring and oxygen-containing functional group), which may greatly influence the hydrogen production and coke formation in the reforming process [8,18]. From the literatures reported [19], some light hydrocarbons (including methane, acetylene, ethylene and propylene) were used to synthesize carbon nanotubes, and the yield and quality of carbon nanomaterials was significantly affected by the different kinds of hydrocarbons. The different types of organics perform different behavior, influencing not only the catalytic performance for hydrogen production, but also the formation of CNTs. The biomass-derived organics (bio-ethanol and bio-tar) contains various types of organic compounds. However, the effect of different organic compounds on co-production of hydrogen and CNTs has been rarely investigated. Deeply understanding of the influence mechanism of different organics is significant for the application of this innovative method. In this study, toluene, 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN), phenol and ethanol were used as the typical component of biomass-derived organics, representing one-ring, two-ring aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds and C2 specie with oxygen functional group. These four organic compounds were catalytically decomposed (without steam) and steam reformed over Ni/α-Al2O3 in a fixed-bed reactor. A series of analysis methods such as temperature-programmed oxidation coupled with mass spectrum (TPO-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy etc were used to characterize the catalyst and carbon materials. According to the above tests, the influences of organic structure (including hydrocarbons of C2, one aromatic ring and two aromatic rings), oxygen-containing functional group and steam addition on co-production of hydrogen and CNTs were investigated."
1,Experiments,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The support material of α-Al2O3 was obtained by calcining γ-Al2O3 (Aladdin Industrial Corporation, grain size of 0.425–0.85mm) at 1150°C for 2h. Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst with 10wt% Ni loading was prepared by wet impregnation method in a rotary evaporator. The support or prepared catalyst was characterized by N2 isothermal adsorption–desorption method, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The detail preparation method and the analysis of XRD and H2-TPR were showed in our previous work [13]. Based on the above characterizations, the physicochemical parameters of Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst are summarized in Table 1 ."
3,Catalytic activity tests,"2.2 Catalytic activity tests The catalytic decomposition/reforming of several biomass-derived organic compounds were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. 6mm) under atmospheric pressure. Before the reactions, 50±0.5mg of catalyst was reduced in a 100ml/min of 50% H2/N2 gas flow at 700°C for 1h. Then the reactor was purged with high purity Ar, and the reaction temperature was held at 700°C. In the reforming reaction, one of organic compounds (including toluene, 1-MN, phenol and ethanol) and deionized water were fed into a preheater by an injection pump and a HPLC pump, respectively. Then they were evaporated at 300°C and carried by 100ml/min Ar to the catalyst bed. Since the phenol is solid at room temperature, 8wt% of water could be miscible with 92wt% phenol into a liquid, which facilitates the injection of phenol. To make sure the constant of carbon molar flow rate (nc =0.993mmol/min), the flow rates of toluene, 1-MN, 92%phenol/8%water and ethanol were 12.5μL/min, 15μL/min, 15.8μL/min and 28.9μL/min, respectively. The flow rate of water kept at 0.036ml/min, and the ratio of steam-to-carbon was 2 for each reforming experiment. In the decomposition reaction, except for no steam injection and 145ml/min Ar gas flow, other experimental conditions were same to these in reforming reaction. A small amount of product gas was detected by an on-line quadrupole mass spectrum (HPR20, Hiden Analytical Inc.). And a majority of product gas passed through the condense system to remove the unreacted water and organic compounds. The gas was collected by a gas sampling bag and quantified by a micro-GC system (3000A, America Agilent). After 60min experiment, the liquid product and spent catalyst were collected. The liquid products from the toluene/phenol/1-MN were analyzed by a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Agilent 7890A-5975C) with a HP-5MS capillary column. The contents of organic compounds were quantified by internal standard method, which reported in the previously published paper [13]. The liquid product after the reaction of ethanol was analyzed by a gas chromatograph-flame ionization detector (GC-FID, FULI 9790), and isopropyl alcohol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, analytical reagent) was used as the standard substance. The TPO-MS experiments (temperature-programmed oxidation coupled with mass spectrum) of spent catalysts and graphite (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, analytical reagent) were conducted to quantify the content of solid carbon. Based on the quantification of carbon in the gas/liquid/solid phase, carbon balance was calculated. To evaluate the catalytic performance of Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst, the following formulas were used to calculate the carbon balance and carbon conversion. Carbon balance ( % ) = m ( CO ) + m ( CO 2 ) + m ( CH 4 ) + m ( solid ) + m ( liquid ) m ( organic compound ) × 100 Carbon conversion ( % ) = m ( CO ) + m ( CO 2 ) + m ( CH 4 ) + m ( solid ) m ( organic compound ) × 100 where m(x, i) represents the total molar of carbon in x component. For example, m(solid) represents the total molar of carbon in carbon deposition, m(organic compound) represents the total molar of carbon in the feedstock."
4,Characterizations of carbon materials,"2.3 Characterizations of carbon materials Temperature-programmed oxidation coupled with mass spectrometer (TPO-MS) was used to catalyze the different types of carbon deposition on the surface of spent catalyst. 20±0.2mg of spent catalyst was first pretreated on a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2720 instrument at 300°C in high purity helium flow for 30min. After cooling to 100°C, the sample was heated to 900°C at the heating rate of 10°C/min in a 30mL/min flow of 3% O2/He. The curve of CO2 emission as a function of time was recorded by a quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPR20, Hiden Analytical Inc.). The morphology of carbon nanotubes was characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, HITACHI) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Titan G2 60-300). Raman spectra of CNTs were measured by a Horiba JobinYvon LabRAM HR800 spectrometer equipped with an Nd-YAG laser (λ0 =532nm) and a highly sensitive Peltier-cooled CCD-detector. More than three particles were randomly chosen and analyzed for each sample to ensure accuracy of the results."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Gas and hydrogen production,"3.1 Gas and hydrogen production The data of product gas is listed in Table 2 . In the decomposition reaction of toluene and 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN), a small amount of H2 and almost no carbonaceous gas were generated, while the yield of CO/CO2/H2 gas was sharply increased in the decomposition of phenol and ethanol. The H2 yield and H2 percentage reached 491.2mmol/(g-cata∗h) and 65.8% in the decomposition of ethanol. The carbon conversion to gas and H2 yield increased in the order of toluene≈1-MN≪phenol<ethanol. The possible reactions of decomposition were listed in Table S1. With respect to toluene and 1-MN, the reactants were cracked to hydrogen and carbon material (R1 and R2, Table S1) [20]. The carbon deposited on the surface of active sites and deactivated the catalyst [21]. Owing to the oxygen functional group in phenol and ethanol, the gas of CO or H2O was produced in the decomposition process (R3, R4 and R5) [16]. A small amount of CO2 was generated by the water gas shift reaction (R12). The production of H2O and CO2 can react with the deposited carbon (R13 and R15) to suppress the deactivation of catalyst. In comparison with aromatic organics, the highest carbon conversion and hydrogen production for the decomposition of ethanol were mainly attributed to the highest oxygen content and the lowest degree of unsaturation. The organics with low degree of unsaturation (Ω) performed the low C–C average breaking bond energy, which indicated them to be cracked easily. The saturated C–C bond energy in ethanol (Ω=0) was obviously lower than the unsaturated C–C bond energy in toluene (Ω=4), phenol (Ω=4) or 1-MN (Ω=7). In the reforming reaction, the yields of CO/CO2/H2 were sharply increased (see Table 2). The H2 yield and carbon conversion to gas for the steam reforming of toluene reached more than 2000mmol/(g-cata∗h) and 70%, respectively. The carbon conversion to gas and H2 yields increased in the order of 1-MN≈phenol<toluene<ethanol, which was almost agreed with the order of the degree of unsaturation and molecular weight. The organics with high degree of unsaturation (such as 1-MN and phenol) had the high average C–C breaking bond energy, which represented these were difficult to be reformed for hydrogen production. Furthermore, the different kinds of organics influenced the distribution of product gas. The “full” reactions of steam reforming (R8–R11) were desired for the highest hydrogen production [18]. The ideal H2 percentage increased in the order of phenol (70%) <1-MN (71%) <toluene (72%) <ethanol (75%), which was associated with the order of H2 concentration in the experiment results, as listed in Table 2. Generally, besides CO2, a part of carbon in organic compounds was converted to CO, CH4 and C2H4 gases in the experimental process. The yields of CH4 and C2H4 in the reaction of ethanol (R4 and R5) were higher than those for aromatic organics. The addition of steam decreased the proportion of CO, CH4 and C2H4 due to water gas shift reaction (R12), steam reforming of methane (R14) etc."
7,CNTs production,"3.2 CNTs production 3.2.1 Yield of carbon deposition In the decomposition and reforming reactions, the solid carbon from the decomposition of organic compounds (such as R1, R2, R3, R8 and R9) and the disproportion of CO (reverse reaction of R11) was deposited on the surface of Ni/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The amounts of carbon deposition of four organics are shown in Fig. 1 . The largest amount of carbon deposition was formed in the decomposition of ethanol. Due to the high carbon conversion of ethanol, the more intermediate products were generated and decomposed to carbon on the surface of catalyst. The lowest coke deposition of toluene was attributed to the lowest carbon conversion in the decomposition reaction. However, the amount of carbon deposition of 1-MN was more than that of phenol or toluene though the low carbon conversion in the decomposition of 1-MN. Among the four organics, 1-MN behaved the largest molecular weight and highest degree of unsaturation, which promoted the formation of carbon deposition [8]. In the reforming reaction, the amount of carbon deposition decreased in the order of ethanol> toluene >phenol>1-MN, in accordance with the order of carbon conversion for the four organic compounds. The amounts of carbon deposition after the reforming of ethanol and toluene were five times more than that of 1-MN. The high carbon conversion supplied more carbon species to increase the amount of carbon deposition. Compared with that in decomposition reaction, the amount of carbon deposition decreased after the steam reforming of 1-MN, phenol and ethanol, especially an 80% reduction for 1-MN. However, the carbon amount increased from 192 to 330mg/(g-cata∗h) in the toluene reaction after the addition of steam. It may be attributed to the duel effects of steam on the formation of carbon deposition. On the one hand, the addition of steam significantly promoted the carbon conversion of organics to generate the more precursors for the formation of carbon deposition. On the other hand, the steam could react with the precursor and carbon deposition on the surface of catalyst. The amount of carbon deposition was determined by the competitive rate of formation and consumption. Compared with that in decomposition reaction, the carbon conversion of toluene sharply increased to 70%, and the more carbon species increased the formation of carbon deposition in the reforming reaction. 3.2.2 Types of carbon deposition To analyze the different types of carbon deposition, the TPO-MS profiles of spent catalysts are showed in Fig. 2 A. The curves of CO2 emission can be divided into three regions. The low temperature region (T<500°C) corresponded to the oxidization of nascent coke which is generated by the condensation and adsorption of organic compounds [22]. The middle temperature region (500°C<T<650°C) corresponded to the oxidization of amorphous carbons, and the high temperature region (T>650°C) corresponded to the oxidization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) [23,24]. Based on the calculation by peaks fitting, the proportions of different types of coke deposition are showed in Fig. 2B. In the decomposition reaction of toluene/phenol/1-MN, amorphous carbon and nascent coke were the main types of carbon deposition, and the proportion of CNTs was less than 20%. The highest proportion of amorphous carbon reached almost 70% after the decomposition of 1-MN. The organics of high molecular weight and no oxygen functional group (such as 1-MN) promoted the formation of amorphous carbon. However, in the decomposition of ethanol, carbon nanotubes were the main type of carbon deposition. The proportions of amorphous carbons and nascent coke were significantly lower than those of other three organics. The high carbon conversion of ethanol on the surface of metal Ni conduced to the growth of CNTs [25]. Besides, the more amounts of CO2 and H2O were generated in the ethanol decomposition process. Compared with CNTs, the amorphous carbons could be easily reformed by CO2 and H2O due to their more reactive nature [23,26]. In the reforming reaction, the nascent coke was easily reformed by steam. The TPO-MS profiles were usually divided into the oxidization of amorphous carbons and CNTs. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of steam significantly increased the yield of CNTs and reduced the formation of amorphous carbons. The proportions of CNTs were almost 60% after the reforming of phenol and 1-MN, especially 80% for toluene and ethanol. The growth of CNTs needed to complete with the formation of amorphous carbon during the decomposition/reforming reaction [27,28]. The consumption of amorphous carbon promoted the growth of CNTs. Among the four organics, the CNTs yields of toluene and ethanol were larger than those of phenol and 1-MN. The yields of CNTs reached more than 260mg/(g-cata∗h) after the reforming of toluene and ethanol. 3.2.3 Morphology of carbon materials Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of spent Ni/α-Al2O3 from the decomposition/reforming reaction. A mass of carbon nanotubes with several micrometers length were clearly observed on the surface of catalysts after the decomposition of phenol and ethanol. With respect to the decomposition of toluene and 1-MN, CNTs were rarely generated, and a few flaky grains (amorphous carbon) covered on the surface of catalyst. After the reforming reaction, the amount of CNTs sharply increased. The long and dense CNTs were observed on the catalyst after the reforming of toluene and ethanol. With respect to 1-MN, the amorphous carbon was the main type of carbon deposition in decomposition reaction, which covered on the surface of active sites to deactivate the catalyst. However, in reforming reaction, the carbon conversion sharply increased. Large amount of C-containing intermediates were formed on the surface of Ni particle, and the steam was easily to react with the amorphous carbon, which promoted the growth of CNTs. Among the four organics, the yields of CNTs and the carbon conversion after the reforming of ethanol and toluene were larger than those of phenol and 1-MN. The higher carbon conversion could supply more carbon species and promote the growth of CNTs. Thus the carbon species for the growth of CNTs were mainly from the cracking of organic compounds, rather than the polymerization of aromatic rings. The organics with low molecular weight and low unsaturation degree (such as ethanol) were easily to be cracked to carbon species and conduced to the formation of CNTs, while the organics of high molecular weight and high unsaturation degree (such as 1-MN) increased the deposition of amorphous carbon. Besides, the more tortuosity of CNTs after the reforming of toluene and ethanol were observed in Fig. 3. The tortuosity of CNTs was related to the defects on the surface of CNTs [29]. The defects of CNTs would be discussed in the following part. 3.2.4 CNTs quality To characterize the graphitization and surface defect of CNTs, the Raman spectra of carbon materials were performed, as shown in Fig. S1. The G-band peak at approximately 1578cm−1 is assigned to the graphitic carbon structure, and the D-band peak at around 1342cm−1 is attributed to disordered carbon structure (such as amorphous carbon or defects within graphitic lattice) [30]. The two distinct peaks were fitted by the method of Lorentzian line shape and the ratio of ID/IG was calculated [31,32], and the results were shown in Fig. 4 . The ID/IG is used to evaluate the quality of CNTs, where the lower value of ID/IG indicates the higher quality of CNTs with less defects and high graphitic degree. In the decomposition reaction, the value of ID/IG decreased in the order of 1-MN>toluene>phenol>ethanol. The formation of amorphous carbon decreased the quality of CNTs. In the reforming reaction, the addition of steam consumed the amorphous carbon and improved the CNTs quality. The values of ID/IG had little difference among four organics, which represented the different kind of organics did not significantly influence the quality of CNTs in the reforming condition. 3.2.5 Diameter distribution and growth mechanism of CNTs Fig. 5 shows the TEM images of spent catalysts. The support material, Ni particles and CNTs were observed. Mass productions of CNTs were multi-walled carbon nanotubes with the diameter from 10nm to 45nm and the spacing between parallel graphene layers of about 0.31nm. The growth of CNTs is usually explained by a vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. The mechanism comprises three successive steps. Firstly, the hydrocarbon source adsorbs and undergoes the dehydrogenation/decomposition reaction to form C atoms on the surface of Ni particles. Then the C atoms dissolve in the bulk of Ni particles to form liquid carbide and diffuse into the particles. Finally, when at the saturation of metal carbide, the graphite layer with hexagonal mesh structure dissolves out from the tip/base of Ni particles to realize the growth of CNTs. According to the location of Ni particles, the growth mechanism contains the tip-growth and base-growth mechanism [33–35]. As clearly showed in Fig. 5(I), the Ni particles located at the tip of CNTs after the reforming of ethanol. The size of Ni particle (26.78nm) was a little smaller than the diameter of carbon nanotube (31.67nm). The Ni particles were also observed at the tip of CNTs after the decomposition/reforming of other organics. Thus the growth of CNTs on Ni/α-Al2O3 mainly follows the tip-growth mechanism, and the diameter of CNTs is related to the particle size of Ni on the catalyst. From the analysis of TEM, the distributions of Ni particle size and CNTs diameter are illustrated in Figs. S2 and 6 , respectively. The size distribution of Ni particle was mainly in the range of 15–30nm. From the above discussion, the particle size of Ni dictates the diameter of CNTs [12]. The diameter of CNTs concentrated on the range of 20–40nm after the reforming of ethanol. However, the diameters of CNTs were in the range of 15–20nm and 10–20nm after the reforming of toluene and the decomposition of ethanol, which was lower than the average Ni particle size (23.70nm). The CNTs mainly formed on the small Ni particles during the reforming of aromatic organics and the decomposition of ethanol. The Ni particles with different size behave the different catalytic activity. Generally, the small Ni particle performs the high catalytic activity [36,37]. Compared to ethanol, the toluene was difficult to be reformed. In the decomposition of ethanol, only a small amount of ethanol was converted. In these reactions, the small Ni particles on Ni/α-Al2O3 may play important catalytic impacts. The organics cracked on the surface of small Ni particles and realized the growth of CNTs with small diameter. Thus besides the particle size of Ni, the diameter of CNTs was also influenced by the different organics and steam addition."
8,Conclusions,"Four kinds of biomass-derived organics were catalytic decomposed and reformed for the co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes in this study. In the decomposition reaction, the compounds with oxygen-containing functional group (ethanol and phenol) benefited the co-production of hydrogen and CNTs, while a small amount of H2 and amorphous carbon were generated for toluene and 1-methylnaphthalene. The organics of high molecular weight and no oxygen-containing functional group promoted the formation of amorphous carbon. In the reforming reaction, the yield of H2 and the proportion of CNTs significantly increased. The consumption of amorphous carbon by steam promoted the growth of CNTs. More than 2000mmol/(g-cata∗h) of H2 and 260mg/(g-cata∗h) of CNTs were produced after steam reforming of toluene and ethanol, while 1-methylnaphthalene was difficult to crack and small amount of CNTs were formed. The organics with low molecular weight and low unsaturation degree (such as ethanol and toluene) were easily to be reformed to hydrogen and carbon species for the growth of CNTs. The growth of CNTs for these four organics on Ni/α-Al2O3 mainly follows the tip-growth mechanism. Besides Ni particle size, the different organics and steam addition influenced the diameter of CNTs. The diameters of CNTs after the reforming of aromatic organics and decomposition of ethanol were lower than that after the reforming of ethanol."
