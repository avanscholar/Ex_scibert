0,Introduction,"As defined by Quigley EMM, the microbiota refers to the assemblage of microorganisms (including also others than bacteria) present in a defined environment, while the microbiome comprises the full complement of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, together with their genes and genomes in a given locus [1]. The gastrointestinal microbiome is a complex echosystem of 10–100 trillion microorganisms, of which the majority are bacteria in the gut, but also including virus and fungal species, that develops immediately after birth depending on multiple factors among whom diet and the host genotype seem the most important ones [2]. The interaction between the microbiome and the host is a symbiotic, mutually beneficial one. Data from the Human Microbiome Project Consortium [3] helped characterizing the microbiome composition and function in terms of genomics, trascriptomics and metabolomics. In adults the microbiome tends to become rather stable in health, but is affected by a number of factors such as age, drugs (especially antibiotics), diet, alcohol, and smoking [4]. The most common of the bacterial groups are the gram-negative Bacteroidetes and the gram-positive Firmicutes, the largest phylum, that includes several Lactobacillus strains used as probiotics. In the past decades, it has become clear that the microbiome is not a passive victim in many pathological processes, but its modification often play a contributive or causative role in pathophysiological processes [5]. The present review will present the available evidence regarding the interaction between smoking, alcohol and the gut microbiome. The effects of alcohol and smoking on the microbiome of either the upper or the lower gastrointestinal tract will be presented separately, highlighting key points and area for further research."
1,What do we know about the gastric microbiome?,"1.1 What do we know about the gastric microbiome? From a physiological point of view, the stomach may be considered a defensive barrier against orally ingested microorganisms, as it functions to inactivate ingested microorganisms to prevent them from reaching the intestine [6]. The observation that reduced gastric acid secretion increases the susceptibility toward infection [6,7] supports this concept. The gastric environment is hostile and difficult to colonize, mainly due to its acidic pH and proteolytic enzymes, and the stomach has therefore been considered to be a nearly sterile organ. The stomach displays a much lower microbial load (102-104 colony-forming units [CFU]/ml of bacteria) than the intestine (104–1012 CFU/ml) [8,9]. Some bacteria adapt to these unfriendly conditions, i.e. obligate or facultative acidophiles able to live at pH < 4.0 [10]. In 1983, the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (Hp), a Gram-negative bacterium responsible of gastric inflammation eventually leading to peptic ulcer, MALToma or adenocarcinoma, drastically changed this view. Meanwhile, Hp is certainly the most thoroughly investigated component of the gastric microbiota [11]. Compared to other gastrointestinal districts, knowledge on gastric microbiota and its role in human health and disease is limited. The development of new high-throughput sequencing methods and technologies as microbiomics and metagenomics made feasible the investigation of non-cultured microorganisms [12]. Parallel to this, the wide diffusion of gastrointestinal endoscopy made easier the accessibility of the stomach to obtain bioptic mucosal or gastric juice samples for molecular analysis. How to investigate the gastric microbiota: from culture to culture-independent molecular methods. The presence of gastric microorganisms other than Hp was at first investigated by using conventional methods, such as histology of gastric mucosal biopsies and the culture of gastric juice or gastric mucosa [13]. In contrast to animal studies usually using the entire, aseptically removed stomach, the sample collection in humans is more complex. Gastric mucosal samples are generally obtained by biopsies during gastroscopy, but the contamination of the biopsy channel with oral or throat microorganisms cannot be excluded, potentially leading to distortion of microbial composition results given the low gastric bacterial load [11]. Moreover, data are lacking about microbial differences between different mucosal layers in humans; microbiota analyses from gastric biopsies represent a bacteria mix in the luminal fluid, upper mucus layer (non-Hp), and juxtaepithelial mucus (mainly Hp) [11]. Instead, gastric juice may be sampled in a sterile manner by using a bull-nosed capsule, double or triple nastrogastric tube systems, or flexibile silicone sampling probes [14,15]. By culture, the most represented bacteria in the stomach of healthy subjects were found to be Clostridium sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Veillonella sp [14]. The main advantage of the culture-based approach toward culture-independent methods is the selective detection of viable bacteria. Unfortunately, the vast majority (∼80%) of microbial species are not cultivable [16]. The more recent culture-independent, molecular approaches allowed to give new insights in the gastric microbiota composition and depend on DNA-based approaches, either relying on whole-genome information or focusing on the 16S rRNA gene as standard phylogenetic marker [11,17]. First, the bacterial diversity of the gastric microbial ecosystem was evidenced by more traditional DNA fingerprinting techniques, such as denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temporal gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) or terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rDNA fragments [18]; more recently, methods like Sanger-sequencing 16S rRNA libraries, microarrays targeting the 16S rRNA gene and high-throughput sequencing methods (454, Illumina, and Ion Torrent) have been developed [11,12]. These latter methods allow a considerably higher sequencing coverage than Sanger sequencing of 16S clone libraries and a much better phylogenetic resolution than fingerprinting methods, permitting the identification of unexpected or previously unknown bacteria, not detectable by microarray approaches [11,19]. A complete view of the overall microbial composition of a definite ecosystem may thus be provided by these innovative molecular approaches, but with the limit that they are unable to differentiate living and dead microorganisms [20]. The acquisition of functional microbiota data requires the sequencing of the complete microbial community DNA by shotgun metagenomics methods and subsequent matching of the obtained sequences to the known functional genes available on datasets [9]. Due to the low bacterial load in the stomach, the application of these methods may result technically difficult. The techniques used to analyze the human microbiota are thoroughly reviewed amongst others by Schulz C et al. [21]."
2,Who are the bugs in the stomach? what is the composition of the gastric microbiota?,"1.2 Who are the bugs in the stomach? what is the composition of the gastric microbiota? The major component of the gastric microbiota in more than half of the world population is Hp, a spiral-shaped member of the Gram-negative Epsilonproteobacteria [22]. Hp has been classified as a definitive (class I) carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO). The mucus layer of the stomach is the natural habitat of Hp; the majority of Hp organisms swim within the mucus layer propelled by a bundle of rotating flagella [23]. Hp infection profoundly affects gastric physiologic functions, which in turn may affect the properties of gastric mucosa to be colonized by other bacteria [24]. Whether Hp infection in humans is able to influence the composition of the gastric microbiota in not fully understood. Hp infection leads to changes of the intragastric microenvironment possibly creating novel niches for bacterial species. Rodents' gastric microbiota may be influenced by Hp infection [25], while the gastric microbiota in mice seems not to be affected [26]. Similarly, in humans no significant differences between phylotype distribution of gastric microbiota or gastric pH levels by using 16S rDNA sequencing analysis were observed between Hp-positive and –negative subjects [27]. A 2008 European study [28] reported a higher gastric microbiota diversity in Hp–negative compared to Hp-positive subjects. Maldonado-Contreras et al. [29] observed a positive correlation between Hp and Spirochaetae and a negative correlation between Hp and Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cianobacteria, Fusobacteria, Plactomycetes, Beta- and Gamaproteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, further showing that 28% of the microbiota composition variation was explained by Hp status, but 44% was explained by patients' origin. Geographical differences may play a role in the diversity of the human gastric microbiota and in interactions variations between Hp and other gastric microbiota components [13]. In a very recent study Hp eradication increased bacterial diversity and restored the relative abundance of other bacteria to levels similar to Hp-negative subjects suggesting that Hp colonization results in alterations of gastric microbiota, reversible by antibiotic treatment [30]. Thus, to date, whether Hp acts as key player or house keeper for other gastric microbes by modulating the gastric acidity or by other mechanisms stills remains to be clarified [21]. In the recent years, culture-independent studies provided evidence on the microbial diversity in the human stomach [8,27,28,31–33]. Some authors reported the gastric microbiota in healthy, Hp-free gastric mucosa: Zilberstein et al. [14] isolated 18 different bacterial taxa by culture of gastric mucus aspirate; the most frequent species were Lactobacillus sp., Veillonella sp., Clostridium sp., and Corynebacterium sp. A study based on 454-pyrosequencing technology (short rRNA gene sequence reads) [28] was performed on three Hp-negatives and three Hp-positives): 33 phylotypes were found in all three Hp-negative samples, and most of the prominent phylotypes (e.g. Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Prevotella and Gemella), were also abundant in the throat suggesting that they were swallowed microorganisms from upstream microbiota; the majority of the 177 phylotypes found in the stomach but not in throat belonged to Proteobacteria; in contrast, the three Hp-positive samples were totally dominated by this bacterium (93–97% of reads), corroborating the finding that the stomach displays a diverse microbiota when Hp is absent [27]. Li et al. [31] investigated the gastric microbiota composition of Hp negative NSAIDs-off individuals by 16S rRNA gene-libraries from antral and corporal biopsies and identified as dominant genera Streptococcus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Porphyromonas, accounting together for 70.5% of all sequences, Streptococcus and Prevotella alone accounted for 41% of all sequences. With regard to gastric topography, the genus Prevotella was more abundant in the antrum compared to the corpus. Similarly to previous studies with different methodological approaches [27,28] Stearns and colleagues [32] by using Illumina sequencing reported Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria as the most abundant phyla of the human stomach. Albeit the microbial research in the human stomach has been defined to be still in the early stages, current data show that the stomach microbiota displays a microbial diversity beyond Hp and seems to be distinguishable from oral, throat, nose, and distal gut microbiota [8,13], supporting the idea that in healthy subjects harbor a “core gastric microbiota”. Table 1 gives an overview on the reported composition of the gastric microbiota other than Hp."
3,Potential modulators of the gastric microbiota: alcohol and smoking,"1.3 Potential modulators of the gastric microbiota: alcohol and smoking Microbiota diversity or composition may be shaped by the host physiology as well as by environmental factors. Many factors have been postulated to potentially exert an influence on the gut microbiota by causing significant shifts of its composition, such as diet, antibiotics, other drugs, Hp-related inflammation, intra-gastric pH, as well as smoking and alcohol [33]. For example, the mucus layer in the stomach is a protective barrier preventing microbial epithelial colonization and diffusion of gastric acid to the epithelial surface. The capability to get across the mucus layer highly depends on bacterial factors (motility, shape and mucus-degrading-ability) [34], but also on host factors: an increased pH results in lower viscosity making the mucus layer easier to penetrate for microorganisms [35], thus potentially modulating gastric microbiota. Hp infection is linked to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage [36], potentially influencing the gastric microbiota composition. An elegant study in wild-type C57BL/6 mice reported that the entity of Hp-associated inflammation was directly related to the pre-infection microbiota [37], suggesting that gastric microbiota variations may have an effect of Hp-associated disease. An impaired gastric microbiota (dysbiosis) has been identified as a possible trigger of different gastric conditions as atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia, and even gastric cancer (GC) [33,38–40]. The gastric microbiota has long been considered an essential factor contributing to GC development [41]: The impaired gastric acid secretion in gastric atrophy results in gastric bacterial overgrowth, increased production of N-nitroso-compounds leading to DNA damage and epithelial cells methylation, potentially promoting gastric carcinogenesis [42]. This is supported by data showing increased gastric bacterial counts and enhanced nitrites production in the stomach during antisecretory treatment [43]. 1.3.1 Gastric microbiota modulation and gastric cancer Yu G et al. [38] showed that lower microbial richness was significantly associated with lower pepsinogen I/II ratio, a serological marker of gastric atrophy predisposing to GC, supporting the potential role of the gastric microbiota in GC risk. In GC patients, the gastric microbiota was dominated by different species of the genera Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Veillonella, Prevotella, and Haemophilus [44]. Veillonella and Haemophilus parainfluenzae had a higher capacity in nitrate than nitrite reduction, thus increasing nitrite accumulation in the gastric juice [45]. A recent Korean study analyzed the gastric microbiota of Hp-positive and -negative GC patients compared to controls by bar-coded 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and showed a higher composition of Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, S. parasanguinis, and S. oralis in the Hp-negative cancer group [46], suggesting a possible role of non-Hp bacteria in the gastric carcinogenesis. However, a very recent Swedish study investigated the composition of the transcriptionally active microbial community and the Hp gene expression by using metatranscriptomic RNA sequencing of stomach biopsies from individuals with different Hp infection status and pre-malignant tissue changes observing that Hp completely dominates the microbiota not only in infected individuals, but also in most individuals classified as Hp-uninfected using conventional methods, and that Hp abundance is positively correlated with presence of Campylobacter, Deinococcus, and Sulfurospirillum [47]. This study clearly strengthens how functional analysis of the gastric microbiota may provide new insights into how bacteria respond in vivo to variations in the stomach microenvironment and how much we have still to learn about its interactions and modulators. 1.3.2 Gastric microbiota modulation and alcohol Alcohol may be considered a further modulator of gastric microenvironment. Attention has been paid to the harmful consequences of alcohol in the stomach. Both acute and chronic alcohol consumption produce harmful effects in the stomach by multiple, complex mechanisms related to direct contact of ethanol or its metabolite acetaldehyde as well as by non-alcoholic components of alcoholic beverages: (i) gastric motility impairment; (ii) alteration of gastric acid output, and (iii) direct mucosal damaging [48,49]. Ethanol solutions exert an inhibitory, not dose-dependent effect on gastric emptying, and alcoholic beverages produced by fermentation (beer and wine) are emptied even more slowly than their corresponding ethanol concentrations, presumably due to additional inhibitory factors in the non-alcoholic ingredients [50]. Fermented alcoholic drinks are potent stimulators of gastric acid output, and succinic acid and maleic acid have been reported as the responsible substances [51]. In contrast, highly concentrated alcoholic beverages produced by distillation (whiskey and cognac) do not stimulate gastric acid secretion; interestingly, alcoholic beverages produced by fermentation followed by distillation (i.e. aperitifs and hard liquors) do not stimulate acid secretion as well [52]. Alcohol has been associated with a breakdown of gastric barrier thus contributing to the toxic damage of alcohol to gastric mucosa and alterations in mucosal defense [53]. Ethanol may directly and dose-dependently impair the gastric mucosal barrier; the acidification of the mucosal cells and ethanol itself induce release of inflammatory and vasoactive substances, leading to ischemia and mucosal damage [52]. Therefore, analogously to tobacco smoking, acute or chronic use/abuse of alcohol may be postulated to significantly alter the gastric microenvironment in turn affecting the gastric microbiota composition. With regard to Hp, an alcohol intake lower than 75 g weekly has been reported to protect against active infection [54]. Another study reported a lower risk of Hp infection in subjects consuming between 3 and 6 units of wine or beer weekly compared to those not drinking (OR 0.89, 95% 0.90–0.99; OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.75 to 0.91) [55]. A recent dose-response meta-analysis showed an inverse relationship between alcohol intake and Hp infection (OR 0.78,95% CI 0.69 to 0.89), regardless of gender, age, geographic areas, detection methods or beverage [56], thus confirming the results from former studies. Alcohol consumption has been reported to be positively associated with successful eradication treatment: treatment failure was significantly more frequent in non-consumers (29.9%) than in consumers (12.2%) (OR 3.24) [57]. To date it is not understood whether alcohol-related alterations of the gastric microenvironment and possible subsequent changes of the gastric microbiota may be linked to this observation. In contrast to the observed protective effects of alcohol on Hp infection, alcohol intake was reported being a risk factor for GC [58–60]: Low alcohol intake was negatively associated with GC risk (HR 0.74) [61]. This association was stronger only in heavy alcohol consumers (≥4 drinks daily) (RR 1.20) [62]. A more recent huge Japanese study reported a significant association with GC risk and different levels of alcohol intake (HR 1.39) [63]. Similarly to smoking, alcohol intake has been reported as being associated with Hp eradication failure [64]. Ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), catalase or cytochrome P450 2E1 to acetaldehyde which is then further oxidized to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) [65]. Acetaldehyde induces DNA damage in the gastrointestinal mucosa [65], classified as class 1 carcinogen to humans by the WHO [66]. Several mechanisms have been suggested to delineate alcohol consumption and cancer development. Ethanol itself is not carcinogenic, but data suggest that acetaldehyde and ROS have genotoxic or tumor promoting effects. In AG, a predisposing condition for GC characterized by impaired gastric acid secretion and alterations of the gastric microbiota [40,67], ethanol metabolism by the gastric microbiota may lead to high intragastric acetaldehyde production [68]: the acetaldehyde production from gastric juice samples from AG patients incubated with 1% ethanol has been reported to be 7.6-times higher compared to control samples [69]. Thus, alcohol consumption may exert effects on the gastric microenvironment and this may, in turn, lead to potential alterations of the gastric microbiota composition, including Hp. The magnitude and the modalities with which alcohol intake may modulate Hp infection and the gastric microbiota remain a subject open for investigation, as specific studies on the gastric microbiota beyond Hp are lacking."
4,Gastric microbiota modulation and smoking,"1.4 Gastric microbiota modulation and smoking N-nitroso compounds, consisting of N-nitroamines and N-nitroamides, are potent carcinogens to which humans are exposed from diet and smoking. Increased exposure to these exogenous N-nitroso compounds has been linked to an increased incidence of GC, albeit an important role has been ascribed to the endogenous N-nitroso compounds [70]. A 2008 systematic review provided summary RR estimates of 1.62 in males and 1.20 in females for GC in current smokers compared to never smokers, classifying smoking as one the most important behavioral risk factor for GC [71]. More recently, data from the Stomach Cancer Pooling (StoP) Project confirmed the detrimental effect of cigarette smoking on the risk of GC reporting a RR 1.25 for current cigarette smokers compared to never smokers [72]. Another proposed mechanism by which smoking may lead to negative effects on health, as cancer and periodontitis, may be through microbiome alterations [73]. Vogtman E et al. showed by a 16S rRNA microarray that current smokers had an increased within-participant-diversity for a 10 species increase, the OR for current smoking was 1.29; Dialister invisus and Megasphaera micronuciformis were more commonly detected in current smokers compared to never smokers [74]. Among host-related factors, smoking has been studied as a possible risk factor for Hp eradication failure: a meta-analysis reported an OR of 1.95 for eradication failure in smokers compared to non-smokers [75]. A very recent Israeli study on >48,000 subjects confirmed that eradication failure (first-line treatment for Hp infection) was positively associated with current smoking (OR 1.15), together with female gender (OR 1.20) and low socioeconomic status (OR 1.24) [76]. Whether the significant association between the likelihood of unsuccessful first-line treatment for Hp infection and smoking status may be linked to an altered gastric microbiome remains to be investigated. Table 2 summarizes the supposed mechanisms and the described modulating effects of alcohol and smoking on the gastric microbiota."
5,Effects of alcohol on the microbiome of the lower gastrointestinal tract,"1.5 Effects of alcohol on the microbiome of the lower gastrointestinal tract The association between alcohol consumption and changes in intestinal microbiome has been investigated extensively in the past decade and there is sufficient evidence suggesting that both acute and chronic exposure to alcohol determine specific modifications of the microbiome composition, bacterial overgrowth, and disruption of the mucosal barrier function [77] (see Table 3 ). Many of these studies were conducted in animal models with liver disease, as it has become clear that alcohol-induced intestinal dysbiosis alters the homeostasis between the gut and the liver and plays a central role in the development of alcoholic liver disease. In this view, the microbiome plays the role of an important mediator of a number of negative effects of alcohol. However, it has also been demonstrated that bacterial phyla are able to produce alcohol themselves, such as Proteobacteria, are increased in subjects with metabolic alterations and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), possibly supporting the hypothesis of a direct role of the microbiome in determining NASH. At any rate, manipulation of the microbiome is an intriguing therapeutic possibility for alcohol-related disorders. 1.5.1 Studies in animal models There are a number of studies in animal models in which exposition to alcohol causes ‘leaky gut’ with decreased levels of bacteria with “anti-inflammatory activity” such as Firmicutes (Lactococcus, Pediococcus, Lactobacillus and the Leuconostoc genera) and increased levels of Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes [78] in the cecum. These changes seem to occur after 3 weeks of exposure to alcohol. In another study, rats fed with alcohol for 10 weeks showed modifications of the microbiome in the colonic but not in the ileal mucosa, and pre-treatment with either a probiotic (Lactobacillus GG, LGG) or a prebiotic (oats) prevented these changes [79]. Similar results have been confirmed by others, with data suggesting that alcohol causes an increase of Proteobacteria and Actinobaceria phyla, and a decrease of Firmicutes with these changes being restored by treatment with LGG [80]. Germ-free animals are an interesting model to investigate the role of alcohol on intestinal microbiota. When germ-free rats are fed with alcohol for seven days the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the liver inflammation are less pronounced compared to those seen in control animals with normal microbiome. Furthermore, when germ-free animals are transplanted with faeces of control animals fed with alcohol, intestinal and hepatic inflammation increases, suggesting that the pro-inflammatory effect of alcohol is mediated by the intestinal microbiome [81]. Chronic exposure to alcohol also modifies the composition of intestinal mucus. Interestingly, MUC2 knock out animals are less prone to develop bacterial overgrowth, bacterial translocation and intestinal inflammation in response to exposure to alcohol, suggesting that the interaction between alcohol, the mucosal layer and microbiome are complex [82]. An interesting bacterial species in this setting is Akkermansia muciniphila, a member of the phyla Verrucomicrobia, with growing data supporting potential anti-inflammatory properties [83]. A muciniphila exerts an anti-inflammatory action, and its depletion is an early event in alcohol-fed animals [84]. In mice treated with alcohol, when A muciniphila is administered in a preventive setting, all markers of intestinal (gut barrier function and mucus thickness) and liver damage are reduced [85]. Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that alcohol causes significant changes in the composition of the colonic microbiome in animal models, which in turn causes pro-inflammatory changes, leaky gut and bacterial translocation associated with liver disease [86]. The liver is not the only organ distant from the gut that has been associated with deleterious effects of intestinal dysbiosis due to alcohol. As alcohol is a risk factor for pulmonary infections, Samuelson and colleagues investigated the effect of alcohol-induced dysbiosis on the susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in an animal model [87]. When alcohol-naïve rats were recolonized with microbiota from alcohol-fed animals, there was an increased risk of K. pneumoniae infection and related damage, associated with impaired immunological defense. These findings point out toward a wider role of alcohol-related intestinal dysbiosis with potential effects on the immunological response and consequences that are not limited to the digestive system. 1.5.2 Studies in human There is also a growing body of evidence form studies in humans supporting the association between alcohol consumption, dysbiosis and eventually intestinal and hepatic inflammation. Chronic alcohol consumption leads to an increase in Proteobacteria and a decrease in Bacteroidetes and increased intestinal permeability [88] resulting in traslocation of LPS and endotoxins in the bloodstream which eventually contributes to hepatic damage [89]. Indeed, the microbiome of cirrhotic patients differs from that of controls, and a “cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio” (CDR) has been proposed [90]. This index, defined by the ratio between Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae which can exert a protective effect and Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroidaceae that are potentially pathogens is typically lower in cirrhotics, especially in those with an alcoholic etiology [89,91]. The causal effect of these alteration is unclear. However, intriguingly, administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to cirrhotic patients in a randomized-controlled trial, determines an increase of Lachnospiraceae and a decrease of Enterobacteriaceae with consequent reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [92]. Although all these data clearly show that alcohol favours dysbiosis, some alcoholic beverages might exert a positive effect on the microbiome. This is the case of red wine. In a cross-over study performed in healthy subjects, gin caused an increase in the Bacteroides and Clostridium frequencies while both red wine and de-alcoholized red wine consumption led to an increase of the amount of a number of bacterial group including Enterococcus, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium [93]. Red wine induced changes were associated with a parallel reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglyceride, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein. The results suggest that the effect is mediated by polyphenols contained in red wine. A decrease of faecal A. muciniphila when compared with healthy controls has also been reported in patients with alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) which seems associated the severity of the liver damage [85]. A. muciniphila is a key health-promoting bacteria related with active and healthy lifestyle, as regular physical activity increases its abundance together with that of Bifidobacterium spp, R. hominis, and F. prausnitzii [94]. Taken collectively these data demonstrate that specific modifications of the microbiome occur in association with alcohol intake in humans, causing intestinal damage and increase in inflammatory changes, eventually linked with increased hepatic damage. With this in mind, Llopis et al. designed a study in which germ-free and conventional mice received microbiome transplants from alcoholic patients with or without alcoholic hepatitis and investigated possible different effects of feeding the animals with alcohol related with this “humanized” microbiome [95]. They found that mice who received the microbiome of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis developed a worse intestinal, damage with increased intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, and more prominent inflammatory changes in the liver. This result strongly supports the case of an active role of the microbiome, independently from alcohol and the host. Another intriguing aspect regards the existence of a gut-brain axis that could be modulated by microbiome imbalance due to alcohol. In an interesting study, Leclercq et al. [96] investigated the composition of gut microbiome and intestinal permeability and their association with psychological symptoms of alcohol dependence in 75 subjects with alcohol dependence. They found that subjects with increased intestinal permeability had higher scores of depression and anxiety and alcohol craving after 3 weeks of abstinence, possibly suggesting that the microbiome might be a potential target to reduce the risk of alcohol use relapse in alcoholics. An interesting issue regards the cause-effect relation between alcohol and microbiome. Indeed, while the above mentioned studies suggest that alcohol assumption modifies the microbiome and that their interaction determines a number of pathophysiological changes related with intestinal and liver damage, dysbiosis itself can lead to ethanol production even in the absence of alcohol assumption, thus possibly resulting in secondary liver damage. It has been demonstrated that some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli can produce up to 0.8 g of ethanol per hour in anaerobic conditions [97]. Interestingly, the presence of Enterobacteriaceae which under certain circumstances can produce alcohol, is increased in patients with NASH [98]. In another study ethanol was measured by gas chromatography in 21 with NASH and in 10 controls [99]. While NASH patients did not produce more ethanol compared to controls, its levels were higher in obese women. One might therefore speculate that a certain type of dysbiosis, typical of obesity and metabolic syndrome, favours increased ethanol production in the gut, contributing to liver injury in a vicious circle in which increased ethanol production would in turn cause “leaky gut” and bacterial translocation eventually causing increased liver damage."
6,Smoking and the microbiome in the lower GI tract,"1.6 Smoking and the microbiome in the lower GI tract Cigarettes produce as much as 4000 individual chemical compounds such as hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, methane, aniline, aldehyde, phenols, nicotine and nar containing in turn simple phenols, cresols, naphthols, pyrene, benzopyrene and hydrocarbons and heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, nickel, polonius, strontium [100]. All these compounds have some kind of deleterious effects on different human organs and some of them exert an effect on the intestinal health and on the microbiome (see Table 4 ). 1.6.1 Studies in animal models Animal models offer a good opportunity to analyze the affects of different compounds derived from cigarette smoking on the intestine [101]. However, there is a relative paucity of these kind of data in the literature. Thomas et al. investigated the effect on colorectal mucosa of subcutaneous nicotine at different doses as compared to saline, in ferrets. They did not report significant changes but for the nicotine and cotinine serum levels [102]. Van Dijk et al. reported the potential anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, as upon its administration the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha was completely abolished [103]. The effects of smoking on the large and small bowel mucosa seem to diverge. It has been demonstrated that both nicotine and carbone-monoxide do not cause macroscopic or microscopic damage and decrease inflammation in the colon, while nicotine worsens jejunitis in experimental models, decreasing PGE2 generation and increasing NOS activity [104–106]. These data support the clinical observation of opposite effects of smoking on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, there are data in opposition with this view, as others found that cigarette smoke (CS) exposure in a rat model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis worsened the inflammatory damage [107]. Zijlstra and colleagues investigated the effect of different concentration of subcutaneous nicotine on the colonic mucosa of rabbits [108]. The thickness of adherent mucus on rectal mucosa was significantly reduced by low dose nicotine, but increased by high doses. Prostaglandins (PG) were reduced with an inverse dose dependence, as lower doses caused a more significant reduction. This heterogeneity might be due to the different models, the different substances (either nicotine or cigarette smoking) and their dosage and way of administration employed in the above mentioned studies. In this context, it is worth reminding that the intestinal microbiota is an important scavenger of potentially toxic compounds, with a number of enzymatic families (azoreductases, nitroreductases, β-glucuronidases, sulfatases and β-lyases) affecting the metabolism of over 30 environmental pollutants. On the other hand, environmental contaminants alter the composition of the microbiome [109,110]. It is therefore not surprising that exposure to smoking causes modifications of the gut microbiome. A decrease of Bifidobacteria and of proprionic and butirric acid in the cecum has been reported by Tomoda et al. in rats exposed to smoking [111]. In a similar animal model, even passive smoking increases Clostridium sp and reduces Firmicutes phylum (Lactococcus and Ruminococcus sp.) and Enterobacteriaceae [112] In a more recent study, the effect of chronic exposure to smoking compared to normal air was evaluated on the mucosa and on the microbiome composition of rats at different levels of the GI tract (ileum, cecum, colon) employing the Illumina high throughput sequencing [113]. Microbial clusters in the cecum and colon differed significantly in animals exposed to smoking with an important increase of Lachnospiraceae sp. The mRNA expression of mucins was also modified by smoking, as Muc2 and Muc3 increased in the ileum, whereas Muc4 increased in the distal colon of smoke-exposed mice, while the expression of tight junction genes remained unchanged. 1.6.2 Studies in humans The reported increase of Clostridia induced by smoking in rats seems also indirectly confirmed in humans by an epidemiological study on 16781 elderly subjects. The authors reported an increased rate of C. difficile infection in smokers, with odds 33% greater in former smokers and 80% greater in current smokers when compared to never smokers [114]. Smoking withdrawal in humans determines profound changes in the microbiome with increased microbial diversity [115], an increase of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and a decrease of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Of course, the observed results might be due to other uninvestigated factors related with smoking habit or with its cessation, such as modification of the diet and increase in body weight. Interestingly, similar changes have been reported in obese men with increased levels of Firmicutes and reduced levels of Bacteroidetes [116]. As stated above, the heterogeneous effects of smoking on the human microbiome at different sites might partially explain the reduced risk of ulcerative colitis [117] and the increased risk of Crohn's disease (CD) [118] associated with this habit. Indeed, in Crohn's disease patients who smoke, the microbial population and diversity is decreased with reduction in particular of Collinsella, Enterorhabdus and Gordonibacter [119]. In another study the decreased levels of Faecalibacterium and smoking are associated independently with CD recurrence [120]."
7,Conclusion remarks,"In conclusion, microbiome research has enormously developed in the last years tempting to move its first steps from the laboratory into clinical practice. New nucleotide sequencing techniques and new biocomputational tools techniques have allowed to better characterize the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract. Among many factors that contribute to the modulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome, the intake of alcohol and smoking seem relevant. The interactions between alcohol and smoking, the gastric microbiome and the host remain enigmatic. This holds true also for the role of H. pylori which might act as a key player or house keeper for other GI microbes by modulating gastric acidity. As stated by Quigley EMM [1], for the real clinical applicability of gut microbiome research at least three essential conditions need to be fulfilled: (i) we need to know what the normal microbiota is like, (ii) we need to accurately and reliably define an altered/abnormal microbiota, and (iii) we need to establish a biologically plausible and clinically meaningful relationship between a certain microbiome profile and a certain disease [1]. This holds true especially for the gastric microbiota, as to date the composition of the normal “core” gastric microbiota is still not completely defined. The precise role of potential modulators of gastric microbiota, such as smoking and alcohol, still needs to be clarified, but current available data suggest a key role in gastric diseases, in particular as risk modulator for gastric cancer. As far as regards the interaction between alcohol and smoking and the intestinal microbiome, there is sufficient evidence suggesting that alcohol causes depletion of certain microbes and increase of others, and that the resulting dysbiosis, coupled with leaky gut causes increased inflammatory changes in the intestine and liver. These alterations seem particularly relevant for the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. Specific bacteria such as Lactobacilli and A. muciniphila that are depleted by alcohol seem able to exert a significant anti-inflammatory effect in this setting. Interestingly, dysbiosis itself in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis increase alcohol production in a potential vicious circle. Alcohol-induced modifications of the gut microbiome also seem associated with other non-gastrointestinal disorders, including pneumonia and behavioral patterns. The role of smoking in determining modifications of the gut microbiome has been investigated specifically in the context of inflammatory bowel disease, and links with the long-standing clinical observation of smoking being protective toward ulcerative colitis and deleterious for Crohn's disease. In the next few years the puzzle of knowledge on this topic will certainly become more complete. However, in this complex research field, many confounders come into play. Not least because the microbiota-gut-brain axis is bidirectional, as shown by the effects of stress on gut physiology, immune function and gut microbiota composition [121]. This may be particular true for life style habits as smoking and alcohol consumption related with psychological and social factors, which might in turn influence the gastric microbiota."
