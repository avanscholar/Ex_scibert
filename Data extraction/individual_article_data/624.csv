0,Introduction,"The worldwide energy consumption is on the rise as a result of rising population, an alarming pace of vehicle population expansion, and a high living standard, resulting in the depletion of energy supplies. The pollution of the environment is caused by the combustion of energy resources such as crude oil, coal, and fossil fuels. The energy we get from solar and wind farms fluctuates; larger-scale energy storage will be a key role in determining the success of the hydrogen economy in particular. Hydrogen is an essential energy source in the twenty-first century, thanks to the hydrogen-electrical interchange. Due to increased global pressure to address climate change and global warming concerns, a steady increase in the number of hydrogen applications, and the need to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, hydrogen energy has captivated the entire world with its vast potential for commercial applications, electricity generation, and vehicle powering. According to the International Energy Agency, gas produced 76% of the world's hydrogen in 2019, while coal produced 22%. As a result, fossil fuels produce nearly all of the hydrogen produced today [1]. The development of a feasible and eco-friendly technology that can reduce dependence on depleting fossil fuels and prevent local and global environmental impacts is the pressing priority. A hydrogen engine possesses capabilities of high thermal efficiency as in diesel engine [2] and commendable performance as in petrol engine [3]. Cold hydrogen combustion in fuel cells generates electrical power, while hot hydrogen combustion in internal combustion engines generates power and produces water in the same way that fossil fuels do [4]. Hydrogen's energy density is higher than that of petroleum. Hydrogen is extremely important to India. India has only 0.9 per cent of the world's oil reserves and may never be able to meet its energy needs if it relies solely on oil [4], Global warming and Climate Change are considered to be main reasons for this, as depicted in Fig. 1 . Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEVs) now operate on compressed, 700 bar, gaseous hydrogen stored in carbon fibre storage containers to carry the 5 kg of hydrogen required for a 500 km driving range [5]. Fuel cells are being employed as backup power in some cell towers, and hydrogen storage is gaining popularity as a way to improve the grid's resiliency. For hydrogen storage, new materials are being researched and produced [5]. Since September 2018, the world's first hydrogen-powered train has been running in Lower Saxony, Germany [5]. The number of refuelling stations on the road is continuously increasing. Hype taxi began operations in Paris in 2015 and presently has over 100 Toyota Mirai FCEV taxis [1]. Named as the 'Hydrogen Olympics', the Tokyo 2020 Olympics showcased Japan's advanced hydrogen technologies comprising first hydrogen powered Olympic Flame, a fleet ofhydrogen-powered buses and cars, dozens of hydrogen refuelling stations across the city, and hydrogen-based electricity at the athlete’s village. In this way, India can take learning from global leaders and invite international collaborations in R&D to harness hydrogen energy at minimal cost and develop its hydrogen economy."
1,Sources of production,"Hydrogen energy is the only fuel which can provide key solutions for the growing energy demands of 21st century and resolve the issues of global warming and climate change. There are several ways to manufacture hydrogen at the moment, but each one has its own set of challenges or environmental consequences, such as the impact on coal mining, the placement of enormous solar arrays, the growth of biomass on plantations, and so on. When we talk about manufacturing hydrogen from coal without carbon sequestration, we're talking about releasing twice as much carbon into the environment as when we talk about gasoline. The thermochemical reforming of conventional energy sources contributed more than 96% of the world's principal hydrogen production materials (48% derived from natural gas reforming, 30 % derived from alcohol reforming, 18 % derived from coke oven gas and 4 % derived from electrolysis) [6]. In India, the main raw resources for hydrogen generation are natural gas and coal [6]. Solar hydrogen production appears to be a promising method for future energy generation, but there are still obstacles to overcome, such as conversion efficiency and cost, thus large-scale production will not be viable until 2030 [7]. However, owing to its capacity to successfully absorb wind power, solar power generation, peak and valley power, hydrogen from electrolyzed water will always remain a major source of production, and as technology evolves, production costs will fall down [8]. Theauthorshaveaddressedvariousstrategiesfor producinghydrogenin the nest sections."
2,Natural gas steam methane reforming,"2.1 Natural gas steam methane reforming Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the most prevalent and least expensive technique of creating hydrogen (it produces 48 % of the world's hydrogen) [9]. It consists of two essential steps. The first phase entails combining methane and steam to form a gaseous mixture including hydrogen (the majority), 12 % CO, and 10% CO2.It occurs at a temperature of around 800 °C [9]. The water gas shift reaction is the second phase, which includes mixing carbon monoxide with water to generate H2 gas and CO2. The shift conversion can be done in one or two stages, with three temperature levels to choose from. An iron-based catalyst is used in the high temperature (350 °C) shift, while a copper-based catalyst is used in the medium and low temperature (205 °C) shifts [9]. Along with H2 and CO2, smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, methane, water, and other gases are generated. Absorption or membrane separation are used to remove CO. PSA is used to separate hydrogen from carbon dioxide and other gases. CO2 emissions are extensively contributed by hydrogen synthesis from traditional resources."
3,Methane dissociation processes,"2.2 Methane dissociation processes When methane is thermally homogenous pyrolyzed in a rapid pyrolysis reactor, hydrogen, carbon, and a wide spectrum of useful C2 + hydrocarbons are produced, and when methane is photoactivated by near-UV light in the presence of polyoxocompounds of tungsten, hydrogen and C2-C4 olefins are produced [10]. This method could be used to construct solar-powered green technologies for converting natural gas to hydrogen without emitting greenhouse gases. It was discovered that in the thermo catalytic breakdown of methane (at 850C) over metal (Fe and Ni) and carbon-based catalysts, carbon catalysts do not require regeneration and the process can be run continuously [10]. It was also discovered that the thermo catalytic breakdown of natural gas is the only non-renewable fuel-based, CO2-free hydrogen production technology."
4,Coal gasification,"2.3 Coal gasification The first stage is to gasify coal by mixing it with steam and oxygen to create a raw gas mixture [6,9]. After removing the ash, the raw gas is de-sulfurized to produce synthetic gas, which consists primarily of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Through a water gas shift reaction, carbon monoxide is transformed to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and the hydrogen is separated from the carbon dioxide using PSA. The cost of CO2 abatement is a key disadvantage of this approach. Gasification reduces char formation and ash [11]."
5,Biomass gasification,"2.4 Biomass gasification The process starts with the biomass being heated to produce a synthetic gas made up of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. After cleaning the gas, steam is added, causing a water gas shift reaction, which converts the energy in carbon monoxide to hydrogen. PSA is used to separate hydrogen from carbon dioxide [9]. Biomass is a better hydrogen source than coal since it is less expensive. Biomass, on the other hand, has a lower energy density per volume and is more expensive to transport [9]. As a result, the price of feedstock and the cost of transportation are the deciding variables in biomass gasification."
6,Biomass pyrolysis,"2.5 Biomass pyrolysis In an inert atmosphere, biomass is thermally degraded at a high temperature (450–550 °C). This results in bio-oil that is 85 % oxygenated organics and 15 % water [9,11,12]. Ethyl acetate is used to extract the phenolic components of the bio-oil, resulting in an adhesive/phenolic resin by-product. Concentrated Solar Radiation can also be used to manufacture hydrogen from biomass, making it a renewable energy combination [11,12]. However, there are problems with electrolysers (alkaline nature and low operating pressure) using this technology that must be addressed."
7,Electrolysis of water,"2.6 Electrolysis of water Electrolysis of water produces only a small percentage of the world's hydrogen, about 4% [9]. Electricity is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen atoms in this process. An electrolyte is added to the medium to make it more conductive. Hydrogen bubbles up at the negative electrode and oxygen bubbles up at the positive electrode when direct current is supplied. The most prevalent technology utilised in bigger production capacity (0.2 kg/day) units is alkaline water electrolysis [9]. At 100 per cent efficiency, the power consumption per kilogram of hydrogen is around 40 kWh [9]. In actuality, the figure is closer to 50 kWh/kg. The main benefit of this technique is that it produces no greenhouse gases; however, combining it with renewable energy sources can reduce production costs. 2.6.1 Solar powered electrolysis Solar energy can be used to make hydrogen in two ways i.e Water electrolysis using photovoltaic and Water electrolysis by photo electrochemical (PEC). The former is a two-step process that begins with PV electricity generation and ends with electrolysis. Even if the procedure is practical, its efficiencies are low. Under testing conditions of 1000 W/m2 solar irradiation, ambient temperature of 250 °C, and cell area of 156.25 cm2, the efficiencies of single-crystalline silicon PV cells at maximum power point were determined to be 15.4 %. The dissociation of H2O by electrons and holes produced in the semiconducting photo electrode when illuminated with solar light is a single stage process in PEC electrolysis [4]. The most promising approach for hydrogen synthesis is photo electrochemical water breakdown utilising solar energy [13,14]. A heterogeneous photo catalyst is placed to one electrode of a PV electrolytic cell that is exposed to solar light in photo electrolysis. The cell's anode absorbs sunlight, causing the semiconductor to create electrons. The electrons generated at the anode are subsequently transported to the cathode through external current, resulting in hydrogen creation at the cathode. However, even if we employ semiconductor materials with good characteristics, such as double-interface Ga and as electrodes, we can only get about 13% [8]. 2.6.2 Wind energy-based electrolysis and off shore production India's coastline stretches 7516.6 km from Gujarat to West Bengal, making parallel models a viable option for stabilising renewable energy generation, addressing electricity storage issues, and efficiently reducing GHG emissions. This may also serve as a source of employment. We can use power provided by offshore wind projects to electrolyze seawater to manufacture hydrogen. Hydrogen may be transferred and stored through pipelines to generate additional electricity when renewable energy production declines, as well as used in industrial heating and transportation."
8,Biological methods,"2.7 Biological methods Photosynthetic and fermentative methods for producing hydrogen are more environmentally benign and energy efficient. Photo-fermentative bio-hydrogen production with Rhodobacter sphaeroides [15], non-sulphur and non-oxygenic bacteria, is a very promising green technology. The yield and rate of production can be considerably boosted by using co-cultures and genetic modification methods."
9,Hydrogen storage,"Hydrogen storage can be classified into four types: low-temperature liquid storage, high-pressure hydrogen filling, solid hydrogen storage and organic hydrogen compounds storage. But the hydrogen delivery condition is in gas, liquid and solid state. Hydrogen storage methods can be identified by different hydrogen concentrations. From Fig. 2 , it can be seen that the gaseous type of hydrogen gas is much smaller than the other, after which we see that the liquid and the solid hydrogen storage is a successor to the hydrogen gas state while the storage size is much larger in the hydride metal form [6]. The amount of liquid hydrogen is estimated at 70.8 kg/m3 and the solids are measured at 70.6 kg/m3 [16]."
10,Gaseous hydrogen,"3.1 Gaseous hydrogen A great volume of energy is required in the process of liquefication. The hydrogen vehicle model uses carbon fiber-reinforced polymerized tanks for 350 and 700 bar of compressed hydrogen [17]. Honda Motor Company is working on this and is given the concept of a compressed hydrogen tank of a fuel cell car, with storage capacity of 3.75 kg of hydrogen in it with a pressure of 34.5 MPa [18]. The hydrogen gas form is converted to a hydrogen liquid at a pressure of 80 MPa at a certain energy. Hydrogen is stored at a pressure of 700–800 bar. To improve the structure of the tanks, when it is attached to a stainless-steel lining the efficiency is increased [19]."
11,Liquefied hydrogen,"3.2 Liquefied hydrogen Currently we are observing that the liquid hydrogen is also being used in the refinery industries. We obtain 5 times greater density of liquid hydrogen than the gaseous one at a pressure of 20 MPA and a temperature of 293 K [20]. We see some safety issues found with highly concentrated hydrogen in the storage tanks, as the hydrogen is a quantum liquid and its density is 70.85 kg m−3. The volumetric magnitude of the hydrogen in liquid phase is greater than that of the gas phase. Liquid hydrogen needs high-quality adiabatic devices to insulate them and protect them from boiling off [21]. Also, hydrogen in a frozen state will not increase its density too much [19]. In India, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has made progress with the process of dissolving hydrogen to be used in 1980 space shipping projects [23]. They found two major hydrogen extraction strategies in Mahendragiri, developed in 1992 with a capacity of 0.3 TPD and Saggonda, developed in 2004 with a potential of 1.2 TPD, developed by the Indian Space Research Organization [23]."
12,Metal hydrides,"3.3 Metal hydrides Metal Hydrides allows to store hydrogen in a chemical bond with metal. Hydrides are metals that have a tendency to absorb hydrogen at the room temperature and pressure [9]. By providing thermal energy to the metal hydride bond, we can regenerate hydrogen for metal hydride metal. When Zirconium (Zr), Lanthanum (La), Magnesium (Mg) or Titanium (Ti) combine with other metals, hydrogen storage compounds are formed. A study conducted at IIT; Kanpur found that when we increase the aluminum content the hydrogen limit decreases while we obtain greater hydride stability [24]. For the past 20 years the University of Rajasthan has been researching the field of metal hydrides with small films and mass structures. It is evident that when polypyrrole is doped with paratacamite then 59.1 mAhG−1 hydrogen storage is obtained [25]. Other substances such as alloys, nanotubes, organic compounds, or carbon substances such as nanofibers and graphene are also used for hydrogen storage [26]."
13,Hydrogen transportation,"Hydrogen is usually transported from the production plant in the form of liquid or gas. Soluble hydrogen gives us some advantages over the gaseous hydrogen as we can achieve low pressure and low volume in it, but we face some difficulties due to the cryogenic nature of the liquefied gas. The hydrogen condenses at the temperature of 21 K, pressure of 1 bar and the vaporization enthalpy in boiling area is 452 per kJ/kg, the critical temperature of hydrogen is 32 K i.e., after this the hydrogen is in a gas state, as compression is dangerous so liquid hydrogen is preferred to prevent excessive solid pressure. Transmission of heat from the walls of vessels leads to loss of hydrogen [27]. The amount of hydrogen absorbs up to pressure of 35 MPa at room temperature is less than 0.01 % by mass for several types of carbons compounds such as fibres and nanotubes [28,29]. Initially we can use the the compressed gas trailer as the demand for the hydrogen will be small and can be efficiently completed. As we advance in future, growing requirements of hydrogen can be completed with cryogenic liquid tanks. Pipeline can be laid to fulfil the high demand of hydrogen in the market [30]. Transporting hydrogen through pre-laid natural gas pipelines is a good option as the pre-laid pipelines can be repurposed to transport the hydrogen [31,32]. But we see a limitation in this process as the hydrogen on reaction with air can cause explosion, so it is advised to blend hydrogen into natural gas about 5–10% in volume ratio."
14,Environmental impact,"Hydrogen is a clean and convenient fuel [12]. Hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources could eventually replace fossil fuels, alleviating environmental, political, and resource issues [12]. Hydrogen energy is a renewable resource that is obtained in an environmentally responsible manner. It's a good source of alternative energy because it's made from hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The outstanding part of the arrangement is that there is no pollution. The burning of fossil fuels emits a lot of CO2, CO, and other harmful greenhouse gases, and also puts us in danger of running out of petroleum and other fossil fuels in the future. The optimal fuel for fuel cell vehicles is hydrogen. Where hydrogen is used, it has little impact on the environment, but there may be consequences linked with its manufacturing. The production of hydrogen from fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases and depletes natural resources. Carbon dioxide emissions may be captured and stored in geological or biological sinks, such as forests or underground reservoirs [12]."
15,Challenges for green hydrogen economy in India,"The manufacture of chars and tars is the most pressing technological concern. Corrosion is a limiting factor in high-pressure reactors. The financial viability of green hydrogen extraction is one of the most major barriers to commercial use of hydrogen. The majority of low-cost renewable energy resources are scattered around the country, distant from potential demand centers. The economics of transporting hydrogen would be significantly damaged. Carbon Capture & Storage, a technology used in the production and usage of hydrogen is still in its early stages and is costly, raising the cost of hydrogen generation. The technical difficulty is to produce hydrogen in real time, store it safely and easily, and burn it efficiently. The issues of liquid hydrogen storage are the energy-efficient liquefaction process and the cryogenic storage tank's thermal insulation. India's transition to a green hydrogen economy (GHE) would only be possible once a number of important concerns are resolved. GHE is dependent on the development of a supply chain that begins with the fabrication of electrolysers and ends with the production of green hydrogen utilizing renewable energy sources and transmission to end-users. A hydrogen plant, for example, may be worthless unless it is linked to a renewable energy plant that can provide electricity for performing electrolysis and an offtaker to whom green hydrogen can be delivered for transmission to end consumers. New materials for storing hydrogen are being researched and developed (whether chemically bonded in metal or complex hydrides or in liquid carriers, or physically adsorbed on porous surfaces). Because of the fledgling nature of the sector and the amount of interdependence in the supply chain, banks and lending institutions may be hesitant to fund such projects."
16,Measures required to be undertaken,"The biomass pyrolysis and gasification have been recognised as viable techniques for generating renewable hydrogen [12]. Catalysis should be employed to boost hydrogen yields. Biomass, such as municipal solid waste, can be converted to hydrogen using supercritical water. Decentralized hydrogen generation must be encouraged by allowing renewable energy to flow freely into an electrolyser. Fuel cells can offer a constant supply of hydrogen, reducing the intermittency associated with renewable energy. In this context, measures such as incorporating green hydrogen into existing processes, particularly in the industrial sector, can be beneficial. India should draw from the National Solar Mission's experience and concentrate on domestic manufacturing. Chemical hydrides with a high hydrogen content, such as LiBH4, NaBH4, LiAlH4, and KBH4, are classified as high hydrogen materials. Because of its stability and ease of conversion to H2, the hydrolysis of a chemical hydride, particularly LiBH4, should be given special attention. According to a study of The International Energy Agency, the cost of manufacturing hydrogen from renewable electricity might drop by roughly 30% by 2030. India should devote public funds to R&D and technological development in order to compete on the world stage in every aspect of the green hydrogen value chain, with the goal of lowering prices and expanding deployment. This will necessitate a coordinated supply-side push, with increased government and industry investment and R&D commitments, as well as demand-side support in the form of assured markets, enabled by government procurement, subsidy programmes, or regulations/standards on fossil fuel alternatives. In terms of investment, if India wants to use green hydrogen as a sustainable energy option in important areas like transportation, manufacturing, and power by 2050, it will need to spend heavily in electrolysers."
17,India’s plans to achieve its ambitious target,"The state-run NTPC intends to manufacture green hydrogen on a commercial scale from the electricity generated by solar panels that will be installed in its future 4750 MW renewable energy park in Khavada, Gujarat. Researchers from IIT, Bombay has recently employed a novel catalyst to extract hydrogen from water, demonstrating how a magnetized. catalyst can increase hydrogen production while reducing energy expenditures. They showed that by using their chosen catalyst, they were able to increase the rate of hydrogen production while minimizing the amount of energy required. India is attempting to minimize the cost of transporting hydrogen by using existing compressed natural gas (CNG) pipeline grid and infrastructure. With solar becoming cheaper than coal and hydrogen nearing cost parity with diesel, there are substantial economic and energy security reasons to expect India to move to clean energy. Reliance Industries would invest Rs 60,000 crore in four “giga factories” that will manufacture integrated solar PV modules, electrolysers, fuel cells, and batteries to store energy from the grid. These facilities will be located at the projected 5000-acre Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat. A further Rs 15,000 crore will be spent on new energy firm value chain, technology, and partnership efforts."
18,Conclusions,"• Hydrogen is unquestionably a cross-cutting solution that will play a critical role in India's future by reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, reducing GHG emissions, pollution, and global warming and assisting it in making the transition from coal and fossil fuels to clean energy modes. • India must ensure that hydrogen projects are strategically positioned in such a way that electricity from renewable sources of energy is relatively easy to obtain and hence maximize its renewable energy capacity addition and utilize renewable energy produced during its generation hours in best possible ways. • Given India's long coastline, it's a solid bet to invest in off-shore production and solar energy-based hydrogen projects and make use of resources that are not being exploited or are inappropriate for human consumption. • The Global Hydrogen Council has recently classified India as a net exporter of green hydrogen from 2030 and hence India needs to pull up its socks and work aggressively in order to achieve its ambitious targets. • Also, we need to make sure that vehicles produced are competent in terms of cost with fossil fuel equivalents which can be achieved through a dedicated combination of policies, transportation plans, international collaboration in a mutually beneficial arrangement to exploit its potential and harness the hydrogen economy, subsidies and government support. It will also result in job creation and cost savings in production. • In addition, we require a complete map of the storage possibilities available with us, as well as research on novel ways and materials for storing hydrogen generated. • In a word, the hydrogen economy will present some interesting opportunities for India and the rest of the world."
