0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as an energy vector, has an important role in the current and future renewable energy economy. Due to its high gravimetric energy density [1,2] (120 MJ/kg) and carbon-free combustion products, hydrogen production is increasingly being integrated with surplus renewable electricity. The primary hindrance for large scale hydrogen utilization as an energy storage medium lies in its unfavorable elemental properties. Elemental hydrogen under 25 °C and 1 atm has a low density of 0.08375 kg/m3 (8.38e−5 kg/L) [2,3] and thus the lowest volumetric energy density of about 0.01 MJ/L compared to most of the commonly utilized fuels. This in turn reduces the energy efficiency of classical hydrogen storage (pressurized to 200–700 bar [4] or liquified at −253 °C [5]). Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) or chemical compounds to which hydrogen is bound to and stored at ambient conditions, present a promising alternative to overcome the problems related to classical hydrogen storage. To date great strides have been made in the field of LOHCs through both experimental and large-scale design studies. For instance, a classical and popular example of reversible LOHCs would be dibenzyltoluene investigated by many researchers such as Brückner, Obesser, Bösmann, Teichmann, Arlt, Dungs et al. [6], Peters, Deja, Fang, Nguyen, Preuster, Blum et al. [7], Preuster, Fang, Peters, Deja, Nguyen, Blum et al. [8] and many others [9,10]. Specifically, Fikrt, Brehmer, Milella, Müller, Bösmann, Preuster et al. [11] evaluated performance of dynamic H2 releasing of perhydro-dibenzyltoluene and suggested that increase of temperature and catalyst are needed to avoid lowered conversion when flow rate is increased. Other notable H2 storage materials which are comparable to LOHCs in their reversibility, but solid in nature are various metal hydrides materials. For instance, Ouyang, Zhong, Li, Cao, Wang, Liu et al. [12] has demonstrated a low cost method for NaBH4 regeneration and showed a 50% maximum energy efficiency in H2 generation process using this material. This research was expanded and NaBH4 regeneration method was improved In this process method, heat-wasting process in dehydrogenation was removed and significantly higher regeneration yields of NaBH4 of 68.55% and 64.06% for reactions with NaBO2-2H2O and NaBO2-4H2O, respectively [13]. Moreover, Zhu, Ouyang, Zhong, Liu, Wang, Shao et al. [14] developed cost-competitive and technically-enhanced NaBH4 regeneration method which forms Na2B4O7-10H2O and Na2CO3 from reaction of NaBO2 and CO2 showing high NaBH4 yield of about 80%. Chen, Ouyang, Zhong, Liu, Wang, Shao et al. [15] investigated the LiBH4 regeneration process that was conducted by ball milling LiBO2-2H2O and Mg at ambient conditions. In this process, higher LiBH4 yield of 40% and enhanced hydrolysis performance with hydrogen yield of 4124 mL g−1 were reported. Regarding the other candidate for LOHC: dimethylamine borane (DMAB), various catalysts have been studied and developed. Sen, Kuzu, Demir, Onal Okyay, and Sen [16] reported fabricated graphene oxide (GO) supported nano-scale monodispersed ruthenium-platinum-nickel (RuPtNi) prepared by co-reducing Ru3+, Pt2+, and Ni2+ cations showing high turnover frequency (TOF) of 727 h−1 and low activation energy of 49.43 ± 2 kJ mol−1 for dehydrogenation of DMAB. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene (PEDOT) supported palladium-nickel (Pd-Ni) nanomaterials reported by Sen, Kuzu, Demir, Yıldırır, and Sen [17] can also act as effective catalysts for dehydrogenation of DMAB showing TOF of 451.2 h−1 and activation energy of 50.78 ± 2 kJ mol−1. In addition, Sen, Aygün, Okyay, Şavk, Kartop, and Şen [18] developed 3.89 nm palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) supported GO prepared by ultrasonic reduction method exhibited a TOF of 38.02 h−1 and activation enthalpy, activation entropy, and activation energy of 16.5 kJ mol−1, −179 J mol−1 K−1, and −18.6 kJ mol−1. Metallic nanocomposites of 3.78 ± 0.43 nm GO supported monodispersed Pd, Ru, and Ni reported by Sen, Demirkan, Şavk, Karahan Gülbay, and Sen [19] show very enhanced performances of TOF of 737.05 h−1 and activation energy of 55.47 kJ mol−1. Other candidate for reversible LOHC was experimentally investigated by Li, Yang, Dong, Mei, and Cheong [20] where hydrogenation reaction for 2-methylindole over 5 wt% Ru/Al2O3, temperature of 120–170 °C, and pressure of 7 MP was conducted followed by a dehydrogenation reaction for 8H-2-methylindole over Pd/Al2O3 and temperature of 160–200 °C. It was reported that dehydrogenation of 100% with no side reaction can be obtained after 4 h at 190 °C. Formic acid is a typical example of an irreversible or (“one-way”) LOHC as it was shown by Zhong, Iguchi, Chatterjee, Himeda, Xu, and Kawanami [21] who reviewed various heterogenous catalysts for dehydrogenation of formic acid (FA) to produce H2 and reported that dilution of FA concentration contributes lower H2 capacity and stability of catalysts should be enhanced. A type of non-carbon LOHC was experimentally demonstrated by Cha, Jo, Jeong, Han, Nam, and Song et al. [22] who evaluated H2 production system using liquid ammonia (NH3) and Ru catalyst supported on La-doped alumina (Ru/La(x)-Al2O3) and reported that Ru(1.06 wt%)/La(20)-Al2O3 can enhance conversion efficiency above 99.7% at 500 °C under 5000 mL gcat −1 h−1. These and many other LOHC experimental studies provided the basis for large-scale economic and simulation studies, necessary for objective renewable energy route assessment. For instance, Eypasch, Schimpe, Kanwar, Hartmann, Herzog, and Frank [23] have modeled and performed economical evaluation of an industrial scale LOHC system based on dibenzyltoluene (DBT) and have concluded that an energy self-sufficient system (at this time) has a 47% higher cost per electricity produced than the average grid price. In a study encompassing a group of different LOHC systems, Niermann, Drünert, Kaltschmitt, and Bonhoff [24] technically and economically compared them in process chain composed of storage, conversion, release, production, etc. and reported that methanol is an economically-competitive material showing system cost of 12.2 € kgH2 −1. Furthermore, Runge, Sölch, Albert, Wassercheid, Zöttl, and Grimm [25] compared economic feasibility of a Fischer-Tropsch diesel, MeOH, and LOHCs with electricity prices calculated from the 2035 electricity market model, investment price for electrolysis system. The authors concluded that CO2 purchase cost and concluded that dehydrogenated H2 from LOHC can be viable alternative fuels for electric vehicles based on expense per 100 km of 0.02 € km−1. In addition, even though H2 supply chain with LOHCs has many technical advantages, several drawbacks have been suggested: (a) Reactions (especially dehydrogenation) require high temperature heat sources; (b) The successful implementation of the system is dependent on the location of energy demand; (c) catalyst for hydrogenation/de-hydrogenation is required and poses considerable capital and operating costs [8,26]. So, for successful development of this new-design H2 supply system, comprehensive techno-economic study of this system is needed. This study examines the design, performance, and market viability of five large-scale systems for virtually carbon-free hydrogen production through dehydrogenation of LOHCs through process simulation, techno-economic analysis, and market uncertainty assessment. Four chemicals were chosen based on previously published experimental studies on their suitability as LOHCs, out of which three have not been previously assessed in large-scale hydrogen delivery systems. Furthermore, a temperature cascade process, which utilizes all four LOHCs is designed and comprehensively evaluated as a process intensification strategy. The strategy is also examined and compared to single LOHC systems based on operational and market performance. All the cases evaluated recyclable LOHC candidates, or LOHCs which can be cyclically hydrogenated and dehydrogenated without significant decomposition. Besides the essential equipment cost and typical operating cost two major items were included in the techno-economic analysis, the cost of 1-month supply of LOHC chemical (in capital cost) and the cost of annual shipping of hydrogenated LOHC (in operating cost). It was shown that through the cost of LOHC chemicals these items have the most significant impact on the economic performance of industrial LOHC dehydrogenation systems. Therefore, the study further examines the LOHC price variation impact on the minimum hydrogen selling price of each system through market uncertainty (Monte Carlo) analysis. Finally, the increased efficiency and market robustness of the temperature cascade process design is demonstrated, and the exact market conditions are defined where this design has the most impact on hydrogen minimum selling price compared to single LOHC systems."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Scope of analysis,"2.1 Scope of analysis Primary focus of this study were large-scale, LOHC based, carbon-free, hydrogen generation systems. All five systems were scaled for a net output of H2 of 1000 m3/h (at 25 °C and 1 atm) or 82 kg/h. From the main energy input perspective, the systems were considered as stand-alone, which entailed the combustion of the fraction of the produced hydrogen to sustain continuous dehydrogenation. This eliminated the need for an external heat source from, typically, a fossil fuel combustion [27] or integration with other industrial systems which utilize high temperature process streams (i.e. metal refining, thermal power plants), thus minimizing the carbon footprint of the dehydrogenation process. The net output hydrogen as the final product, was compressed to 51 bar and considered for supply to a pipeline system. From the supply side, the scope of analysis took into consideration the annual shipping costs of LOHC chemicals by a tanker vessel which supplies hydrogenated LOHC chemical on a monthly basis from a distance of 5000 km. This is approximately the shipping distance from Jakarta, Indonesia to Ulsan, South Korea and was taken as a representative example of a theoretical LOHC-based hydrogen supply chain with minimal carbon footprint as a goal. Jakarta in this case was the hydrogen supply site, and Ulsan was the site of hydrogen demand. Finally, a monthly storage capacity for hydrogenated and dehydrogenated LOHC was also considered, as well as the one-time capital cost for a one-month supply. After the one-time investment in the LOHC supply, an average annual replenish rate due to various losses was considered. Essentially, the scope of analysis was designed to entirely cover the expected capital and operating expenses of the demand side of the LOHC-based hydrogen supply chain. This in turn provided an objective basis for the comparison economic performance of four LOHC chemicals in five case studies."
3,Selection of LOHC systems,"2.2 Selection of LOHC systems Selection of the LOHC systems for this analysis was carried out based on four key performance indicators (KPI). Primarily, the validity of every chemical system as a promising LOHC candidate had to be confirmed in, preferably, an experimental or at least in a thermodynamic/computational peer-reviewed study. This in turn ensured validation data for the simulation models of large-scale systems. Secondly, all the systems chosen were “recyclable” LOHC systems as opposed to “one-way” LOHC systems. Specifically, by “recyclable (or reversible)” systems it is meant those which chemically bind and release hydrogen with minimum degradation of the carrier chemical (i.e. methylcyclohexane [2], dibenzyltoluene [11], octahydrophenazine [28], etc.) as opposed to “one-way” systems which are synthesized on the supply side and decomposed on the demand side either thermally (i.e. ammonia [22]) or through steam reforming (i.e. alcohols [29], carboxylic acids [30], etc.). Within the third KPI the selection also focused that the candidates chosen were not previously analyzed and economically assessed in a large-scale simulation study. To that end, three out of four LOHC chemicals chosen were not, to the best of our knowledge, previously assessed in this type of analysis. Finally, since the process design for the fifth case entailed process intensification through a temperature cascade and heat integration, the temperature gradient between the prospective LOHC’s dehydrogenation reaction temperatures was also a prominent feature considered in their selection. The first LOHC system is an eutectic mixture of biphenyl and diphenylmethane with mass fractions of 35 wt% and 65 wt% respectively (Table 1 , denoted in purple under EUT). With its hydrogen storage capacity of 6.89 wt% and a reaction temperature of 300–340 °C it is similar in properties to the somewhat popular DBT-H18 (dibenzyltoluene-pentahydrate) [31]. As the name suggests this mixture has a lower melting point than both of its constituents allowing it to be liquid at ambient conditions. The experimental parameters of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation for this system and a demonstration of high stability during cyclic hydrogen charging and discharging were presented in studies of Jang, Jo, Lee, Shin, Sohn, and Jeong et al. [32]; and Jang, Shin, Jo, Kang, Kwak, and Yoon et al. [33]. Second LOHC system is pyridine-based with a hydrogen storage capacity of 6.15 wt% and a dehydrogenation temperature of 250–270 °C (Table 1, denoted in green under MBP). The basis for its selection was the experimental study of Oh, Jeong, Kim, Kwon, Han, and Park et al. [32] where it was determined that the pair in question satisfies the requirements of LOHC candidate as it has good chemical reversibility without decomposition, chemical and thermal stability, and good handling properties due to its below 0 °C melting points and low corrosion rates even after numerous hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles. Third LOHC system was N-phenyl carbazole (Table 1, denoted in cyan under PHC) and it demonstrates the highest hydrogen storage capacity of 6.92 wt% compared to all other candidates in this study. It was selected on the basis of two independent studies, a computational one by Shin, Yoon, Kwak, and Kang [33] where the data for average dehydrogenation enthalpy between three structural isomers was obtained, and an experimental one by Emel’yanenko, Zaitsau, Pimerzin, and Verevkin [34] who besides the reaction enthalpy also determined its ability to form a supercool liquid at room temperature. Final LOHC system, N-ethylcarbazole (Table 1 denoted in red under NEC) is a well-studied nitrogenous LOHC. Specific experimental study, on which the simulation in this work is based on, was performed by Wang, Chang, Jiang, Wei, Zhang, and Yang et al. [35] where full dehydrogenation was demonstrated at 180 °C. This candidate was the only one among the selected four that has been extensively analyzed in techno-economic studies, most recently by Niermann, Drünert, Kaltschmitt, and Bonhoff [36]. Even though it was described within a well-defined process chain, the process design and some key cost assumption differ in this study, as well as the introduction of temperature cascade integration with other LOHC systems."
4,Process design and simulation approach,"2.3 Process design and simulation approach Process design of the LOHC dehydrogenation systems for all cases consisted of the following areas: preheating, reactor, product cooling, H2 separation, pumping section, compressor section, cooling tower, and LOHC storage. The processes were simulated in steady state using Aspen Plus (V.11) flowsheet simulation software. The pure component properties from the default Aspen Plus PURE database were only available for the first LOHC system EUT and for both reactant and product pair. Since components for other LOHC systems are currently not in the PURE database their properties were obtained using a combination of Aspen Plus in-built properties estimator where molecular mass and normal boiling point (at minimum) have to be input by the user, and the Dortmund modified UNIFAC group contribution method (UNIF-DMD). Although this method is predictive, its results (i.e. phase transition enthalpies, vapor pressure models, etc.) will not be as precise as those obtained from experimental properties. Therefore, this uncertainty in property results is addressed in the property parameter sensitivity analysis. The primary physical property method (thermodynamic property model) which was used for all process areas (except the cooling tower) was the SRK which utilizes the Soave-Redlich-Kwong cubic equation-of-state [37,38]. This was chosen as the systems in question contain almost exclusively non-polar mixtures of liquid hydrocarbons and hydrogen. The method is consistent in high temperature regions and is usually utilized in hydrocarbon processing applications. The cooling tower section was modeled using the standard activity-coefficient based NRTL (non random two liquid) property method. The dehydrogenation reaction for all cases was modeled with a stoichiometric reactor model operating at 1.5 bar and a specified reaction temperature specific to each LOHC system. Stoichiometry conversion for the systems EUT and MBP were set to almost complete of 0.998, whereas the conversions for N-PH-C and N-ET-C were set to a lower 0.98. This was chosen to account for the energy efficiency loss due to high melting points of the two systems in order to avoid the simulation of solids (further discussed in the process description section). The energy needed for the reaction (due to an endothermic process) for each system was externally modeled with a Fortran calculator block as a function of the molar hydrogen yield and a specific reaction enthalpy at a given temperature. The heat exchange during preheating (reactor products and reactants), the reaction (main heat source and reaction mixture), and cooling were modeled using rigorous HeatX models and an Aspen Exchanger Design and Rating (EDR) program. This was chosen due to the vast selection and variability of heat exchanger materials and internal geometry which in turn provided a more rigorous assessments of heat losses and equipment pricing. Hydrogen compression to the pressure of 1.5 bar after separation from discharged LOHC was modeled using a single stage isentropic compressor (72% efficiency), while the net output hydrogen compression to 51 bar was modeled with a 2 stage multi-stage compressor (MCompr model) with an intercooling to 30 °C from the last stage. Finally, the cooling water tower was modeled with a vapor/liuid separator model at the set temperature of 35 °C (upper temperature of the cooling water), pressure slightly reduced under atmospheric and a fixed liquid entrainment in the upcoming vapor (air)."
5,Single LOHC dehydrogenation system description and optimization,"2.4 Single LOHC dehydrogenation system description and optimization Process flow diagram (PFD) for single LOHC dehydrogenation (first four cases) is depicted in Fig. 1 . The process starts with pumping the charged LOHC chemical (LOHC+) to 1.5 bar and transporting it to the preheating section (HXmt). Here the LOHC+ is heated up close to reaction temperature in a multitube heat exchanger by hot reactor products. Only in the case of PHC and NEC the LOHCs are firstly liquified in an additional heat exchanger (HXpr) by a stream of hot flue gas. The dehydrogenation reaction occurs in a tube-bundle plug flow reactor situated inside a reformer furnace (Rfh). Hot flue gases flow counter-currently and provide the required heat energy for the reaction. Rector products, a mixture of hydrogen and discharged LOHC chemical (LOHC−) are gradually cooled, first by a LOHC+ preheater, then by an air-cooled heat exchanger (HXac) and finally by a water-cooled heat exchanger (HXwc). Due to sufficient cooling LOHC− is completely separated from H2 at atmospheric pressure in a flash drum, from where it is pumped to LOHC− storage. Pure hydrogen is first compressed to 1.5 bar after which it is split to net output H2 and combustion H2. Fixed amount of net output H2 (1000 Nm3/h) is compressed to a pipeline pressure of 51 bar by a two stage, water cooled reciprocal compressor. Combustion H2 is mixed with preheated air and combusted in the reformer furnace. In the case of carbazole LOHCs, when hot flue gas exits the reformer furnace it goes into the preheater to provide the energy needed for melting so that the carbazole based LOHCs could be pumped to the reactor. At this point it should be noted that in the simulation model all LOHCs are cooled to 30 °C in the water-cooled heat exchanger. This would, in reality, solidify the two carbazole based LOHCs as their melting points at atmospheric pressure are above 50 °C. However, to simplify the simulation models (and to avoid modelling with solid components) this was purposely left as is and they were treated as liquids at 30 °C. To account for this in terms of energy balance, their conversion yields were slightly lower compared to EUT and MBP. In order to minimize the hydrogen required for combustion and consequently maximize the energy efficiency, the flowrate of LOHC+ and air-to-H2 ratio were optimized. For a given LOHC system with a defined reaction temperature, air-to-H2 ratio was set so that the flue gas temperature (Tfg) entering the reformer furnace was at a defined gradient compared to the reaction temperature (Tr). The flowrate of the incoming LOHC+ was then maximized to the point where the flue gas exits the reformer furnace at the reaction temperature which is the thermodynamic limit."
6,Temperature cascade LOHC dehydrogenation integrated system description,"2.5 Temperature cascade LOHC dehydrogenation integrated system description The main premise for the temperature-cascade (TC) process design (Fig. 2 ) was the fact that the flue gas will exit the LOHC system at the temperature close to, but not lower than the reaction temperature of that system. This entails that it is conceivable to utilize a reactor system with a combination of LOHC chemicals which have reasonably high enough reaction temperature gradients so that the flue gas exiting one system will still have high enough temperature for the dehydrogenation of the next system. This also allows for heat integration to be applied to the preheating section where carbazole LOHCs (on the lower end of reaction temperature) were partly preheated by reactor products from EUT and MBP LOHCs. Other than the TC reactor system and preheating heat integration, the TC system operation is essentially the same as described in the previous chapter for single LOHC dehydrogenation. Furthermore the optimization strategy also works in the same way, the LOHC+ flows of all systems are maximized to satisfy the thermodynamic constraint, and the flue gas temperature gradient is set with respect to the reaction temperature of the first LOHC system in the cascade, which in this case was EUT."
7,LOHC system performance and property parameter sensitivity analysis,"2.6 LOHC system performance and property parameter sensitivity analysis When evaluating LOHC systems based on their energy performance under varying process parameters, the simulation model optimization was set differently compared to that set for the TEA assessments. The primary difference is that the hydrogen for combustion (dehydrogenation energy requirement) was set to constant 10 kmol/h, while the net output hydrogen was the variable. Under this setup the energy performance of all LOHC systems was compared based on the net efficiency defined as: (1) η net = ( ( H 2 gr - H 2 comb ) × 120 MJ / kg ) - PPR × 3.6 MJ / h H 2 gr × 120 MJ / kg × 100 % where H2gr is the gross hydrogen generated in kg/h H2 comb is the hydrogen used combustion with a fixed constant flow of 20 kg/h, 120 MJ/kg is the lower heating value of hydrogen, and PPR stands for process power requirement or the total electricity consumed by process equipment in kW. Second parameter of comparison was the LOHC gravimetric efficiency or simply put the ratio of charged LOHC chemical per 1 Nm3 of net H2 produced. As such this parameter illustrates the impact on the operating expenses due to shipping costs. As mentioned before, the uncertainty of the group contribution method parameter results had to be accounted for. This was done by performing a sensitivity analysis of two key properties, reaction temperature and enthalpy, which ultimately affected the energy required for the dehydrogenation and consequently the hydrogen yield. Both parameters were varied in the ranges of 10% and 15% for reaction temperature and enthalpy respectively of each LOHC system."
8,Cost estimation and economic assessment,"2.7 Cost estimation and economic assessment Itemized cost estimation of the process equipment was obtained on the basis of simulation model’s heat and mass balances and two major sources, Aspen Plus in-built capital cost estimator and chemical engineering cost estimation heuristics by Peters, Timmerhaus, and West [39] utilizing the 2019 chemical engineering plant cost index (CEPCI) of 619. All the process equipment excluding the reactor (storage tanks, pumps, pipes, etc.) have comparably standard costing heuristics and will not be mentioned in the main text. Since, to our knowledge, there does not currently exist a continuous, fire heated, LOHC dehydrogenation reactor of the scale used in this study the following assumptions were made in the assessment of its cost. First, the central part of the reactor is conceptualized as a tube bundle with a Pd/C catalyst bed on the inside of the tubes. The tube material is assumed to be high temperature and corrosion resistant Cr-Mo steel. Using the Aspen Plus EDR program the central part of the reactor was modeled as a multitube heat exchanger specifically sized for each LOHC system and cost was estimated by Aspen Plus capital cost estimator based on the EDR results. Secondly, the total cost of the catalyst bed was added. The catalyst price was obtained by taking into account the bulk reduction price trend of Pd/C pellets from the webpages of the MilliporeSigma company (HQ.-Burlington, Massachusetts, United States) [40] and then extrapolating for the required quantity. The required catalyst quantity was calculated from the Pd-to-reactant ratio from [32] for the 98.7% conversion of LOHC and was assumed the same for all LOHC cases, since this exact information was lacking in those experimental references. Finally, the cost of tubing material and catalyst was then combined with the cost of a reformer furnace which was conceptualized around the central reactor part. The cost for reformer furnace was calculated from heuristics by Peters, Timmerhaus, and West [39] and using the total energy amount contained in the hydrogen for combustion as a scaling factor. Based on itemized cost estimation the total capital investment (TCI) was determined for each case utilizing some standard assumptions for additional costs (the full list of assumed additional costs is summarized in Tables S6 and S7). Combined with estimated prices of materials and operating costs, future earnings (cash flow trends) were predicted using the following equation: (2) NC F n = - r n × T CI + a n × W C + ( Rev - T COM ) × ( 1 - tax ) + D × tax where NCFn is the non-discounted cash flow for the year n, rn is the total capital investment ratio consumed during year n, TCI is the sum of fixed capital investment and land cost, TCOM is the cost of manufacturing, D is depreciation, Rev is revenue, tax is the assumed tax rate and Wc is working capital. an is a parameter equal to −1 during year 3, 1 during the last year of the project, and zero for all other years. For each value of NCF, the net present value (NPV) is calculated using the following equation: (3) NPV = ∑ n = 0 30 NC F n ( 1 + r) n Finally, the minimum hydrogen selling price (MHSP) can be determined for a given market price of LOHC chemical (raw material) by varying the hydrogen selling price until the NPV in the last year of the project reaches zero value."
9,Operating costs assumptions and economic sensitivity analysis,"2.8 Operating costs assumptions and economic sensitivity analysis Average shipping costs (freight rates) were estimated based on the total metric tonnage for each LOHC case and the distance of approximately 5000 km using an online freight rate calculator resource [41]. The cost trend for the bulk shipment of chemicals was determined for a weight range of 1000–2000 metric tons (Fig. 3 ), from which the annual shipping cost were then calculated. The cost of LOHC chemicals required were estimated in a similar fashion to that of the catalyst cost estimation. For each LOHC chemical, the pricing data from three different commercial sources American [40], Chinese [42], and Japanese [43] were combined and prices in USD/kg extrapolated to bulk purchase quantities (supplementary Figs. 1–5). Depending on the LOHC chemical and the extrapolated purchase quantity the price range variation was in the wide range of 1 USD/kg to 95 USD/kg. Obviously, the extrapolated prices cannot be taken as absolute values for it is virtually impossible to predict the price trend when the global supply of one or more chemicals jumps exponentially if the LOHC based hydrogen economy becomes widely accepted. Therefore, for the base case comparison fixed prices of LOHC chemicals were assumed. After the economic assessment for the base cases, one-point sensitivity analysis was performed in order to determine the level of market robustness with variable economic parameters. The parameters which were taken onto account were the LOHC price, shipping cost, fixed operating cost, annual electricity cost, and total capital investment. The impact on the MHSP was measured for each case in relation to ±25% sensitivity parameter variation from the base value."
10,Market uncertainty analysis,"2.9 Market uncertainty analysis To address the uncertainty of the bulk prices of LOHC chemicals in this study a market uncertainty analysis was performed. For each LOHC chemical 1000 random prices in the range of 5–80 USD/kg were generated and MHSP were determined for each. Furthermore, as the TC system incorporates all four LOHC chemicals, three extra analyses were performed with ranges of 5–30 USD/kg, 30–55 USD/kg, and 55–80 USD/kg in order to analyze in which market conditions the TC system performs better or worse than single LOHC systems and to establish the boundaries of the performance difference."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Single and TC LOHC system performance,"3.1 Single and TC LOHC system performance Firstly, for a constant dehydrogenation energy input for all cases (10 kmol/h H2) the flue gas-to-reaction temperature gradient (Tfg − Tr) was varied in the range of 200–1200 °C in order to determine the effect to net efficiency and the LOHC gravimetric efficiency (Fig. 4 ). As it can be observed from Fig. 4A and B, considering four single LOHC cases, both values vary much more significantly as the (Tfg − Tr) approaches lower temperature region. Compared to NEC and PHC the EUT and MBP LOHCs perform significantly less efficient in the (Tfg − Tr) region from 200 °C −600 °C. On the other hand, the performance of all cases improves and starts to stabilize from (Tfg − Tr) of 600 °C upwards. This effect follows common sense thermodynamically speaking, since greater system efficiency is achieved when the fuel is combusted closer to the stoichiometric ratio with the oxidizer. In both comparison parameters the TC systems exhibits relative stability or robustness to wide variation of the heat source temperature. This is explained by the varying optimum LOHC distribution with respect to the heat source temperature (Fig. 4A sub-figure). The results of reaction temperature and enthalpy variation (by ±10% and 15% respectively) can be observed in Fig. 4C and D. The results indicate that the EUT and MBP LOHCs are much more sensitive to reaction temperature and enthalpy variation compared to other LOHC cases at (Tgf − Tr) of 300 °C. TC on the other hand again exhibited the most robust response compared to all other LOHC systems as the results have the smallest variation from the base values. Results of the parameter sensitivity analysis further confirmed that the EUT and MBP LOHCs tend to perform better in higher temperature regions of the heat source. In reality though, the maximum allowable flue gas temperature will depend on the characteristics of the reactor material. Therefore under the assumption that the material can withstand it all four single LOHC systems require heat source temperatures in the (Tfg − Tr) region higher than 600 °C for their LOHC gravimetric and net efficiencies to maximize and reach a plateau, whereas the TC system showed much more stable (robust) LOHC gravimetric and net efficiency even in lower temperature regions."
13,Process simulation and TEA results for LOHC base cases,"3.2 Process simulation and TEA results for LOHC base cases The base cases for TEA were compared based on same net hydrogen output of 1000 Nm3, the (Tfg − Tr) of 300 °C and assumed fixed LOHC chemical purchase prices of 15 USD/kg, 12.5 USD/kg, 30 USD/kg, and 30 USD/kg for EUT, MBT, PHC, and NEC respectively. The process simulation results (stream tables) for cases EUT, MBT, PHC, NEC, and TC can are summarized in supplementary materials Tables S1–S5 and they correspond to the stream numbering in Figs. 1 and 2. Based on the process simulation results process equipment was sized and capital and operating costs estimated. The summary of capital and operating costs can be seen in Table 2 , whereas the complete costing for both cost categories as well as TEA assumptions list is summarized in supplementary materials Tables S6 and S7. Total installed cost (TIC) of single LOHCs follows the same trend of LOHC gravimetric efficiency (Fig. 4A) that can be observed at the (Tfg − Tr) of 300 °C. This is reasonable since for the same hydrogen output larger reactor system is needed. The TC shows the highest TIC, which is not surprising due to the necessary multiplication of equipment. On the other hand, when total capital investment (TCI) is considered the LOHC prices have the largest effect on the total system cost. The TIC for every system considered is a fraction compared to the TCI, or more specifically 10.3%, 10.2%, 4.83%, 4.43%, and 9.8% for EUT, MBP, PHC, NEC, and TC respectively. The effect of LOHC gravimetric efficiency is directly apparent on annual operating costs as it corresponds to the results from Fig. 4A from which it can be observed that a difference of 0.6 kg LOHC/net Nm3 H2 can be translated into an average 6.2% reduction in annual operating costs. The breakdowns of capital and operating costs Fig. 5 A and B further illustrate the differences between single and TC LOHC systems. Although the TC system has significantly lower reactor cost compared to all four single systems the cost of pumping section, cooling and H2 separation seem to tip the scale in favor of the highest capital investment. This does seem reasonable as TC has good LOHC gravimetric efficiency which translates into smaller reactor units. On the other hand, all the pumps, separation flash drums, as well as storage tanks have had to be quadrupled which was the primary reason for the different capital cost breakdown. On the operating cost side due to the sheer greater quantity of equipment needed the TC system has higher fixed operating costs. This is balanced by the lowest shipping cost due to the lowest LOHC material needed for the same amount of produced hydrogen. For the assumed LOHC purchase prices non-discounted cumulative cash flows (CCF) were calculated for all the LOHC cases (Fig. 5C). As it can be seen from the CCF chart in this particular case of LOHC prices the MBP single system performed the best followed by TC, EUT, PHC, and NEC which corresponded to the MHSPs of 7.25 USD/kg, 8.48 USD/kg, 9.23 USD/kg, 10.23 USD/kg, and 10.74 USD/kg respectively."
14,Sensitivity analysis results,"3.3 Sensitivity analysis results Results from the one-point sensitivity analyses for all five cases can be observed in Fig. 6 . Predictably the cost of the LOHC chemical had the greatest effect on the MHSP as it directly affects both capital investment and operating costs. Furthermore, the shipping cost affect EUT and MBP systems more than they do NEC and PHC, most likely due to lower LOHC gravimetric efficiency. The TC system has shown robustness towards the shipping cost compared to EUT and MBP which was to be expected. Generally, in terms of market sensitivity all processes exhibited sensitivity towards the LOHC purchase price and some higher sensitivity towards shipping costs. Other parameters for all cases have comparatively minor effects on the MHSP."
15,Market uncertainty analysis results,"3.4 Market uncertainty analysis results As the bulk prices of LOHC chemicals used in this study are not yet stable in the market, Monte Carlo analysis was performed in the price range of 5–80 USD/kg for each case with 5000 data points generated. From these data sets linear models for all cases were derived correlating the MHSP with the LOHC chemical purchase price (under the assumption that all other cost effecting factors remain constant). (4) MHS P EUT = 0.3296 × EU T price + 4.2907 (5) MHS P MBP = 0.2801 × MB P price + 3.7544 (6) MHS P PHC = 0.2348 × PH C price + 3.1864 (7) MHS P NEC = 0.2497 × NE C price + 3.2476 (8) MHS P TC = 3.84 + 0.108 EU T price + 0.0327 MB P price + 0.0284 PH C price + 0.0588NE C price Using these price models, the prices of LOHC chemicals were optimized with gradually increasing price ranges with a goal to find the absolute lower limit of hydrogen selling price for the TC system. Fig. 7 D shows the results of such price optimization. Each data point on the horizontal axis represents the upper limit of the price range in question with the constant lower limit of 0.1 USD/kg (i.e. 0.1–5, 0.1–10, 0.1–20). For each of those ranges an optimum LOHC price distribution was found where the TC system exhibited maximum decrease in hydrogen selling prices (or maximum improvement in economic performance) compared to all single LOHC systems combined. This optimum is illustrated in CCF diagrams of three price ranges 0.1–20 USD/kg, 0.1–40 USD/kg, and 0.1–80 USD/kg in Fig. 7A–C respectively. It can be observed both graphically and numerically that the maximum possible MHSP decrease for the TC system increases as the price ranges become wider. Essentially the efficiency advantage of the TC system at optimum price point multiplies as the possibility of a higher LOHC prices increases. This is the theoretical maximum that the TC system can achieve in terms of more efficient process compared to all single LOHC systems. The theoretical maximum ranges from 0.6% to 16% when the maximum LOHC price possibility range widens from 0.1–5 USD/kg to 0.1–80 USD/kg. The final question would be, how likely is it or how often will the prices of all four LOHCs approach this ideal distribution so that the TC system has maximum performance advantage? To answer this, 1000 random values of LOHC prices for TC system and all single LOHC systems generated 1000 values of MHSP for each case. This was done for four different price ranges as it can be observed from the legend of Fig. 7E. For each random case (consisting of four MHSP from single LOHC systems and one MHSP from TC) it was counted how many single LOHC systems were outperformed by the TC system (generated higher MHPS than the TC system). Therefore in the LOHC price range of 5–80 USD/kg, by random variation, TC system outperformed only one single LOHC system (which means other 3 outperformed the TC) 7.9% of the times, outperformed two 48.9% of the times, outperformed three 38.3% of the times and outperformed all four 4.9% of the times. When considering entire width of the price range the outcomes are normally distributed, with the mean in between two and three. As more expensive price ranges such as 55–80 USD/kg were considered the mean shifted to about three, and vice-versa. This implies that the higher the average LOHC purchase price and the greater the skewness towards higher prices in general, there is a greater probability of the TC system outperforming single LOHC systems."
16,Conclusions,"In this work four reversible LOHC systems, eutectic biphenyl/diphenylmethane mixture (EUT), 2-(N-Methylbenzyl)pyridine (MBP), N-phenylcarbazole (NPC), and N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) were evaluated in a detailed process simulation, techno-economic and market uncertainty analysis for a 1000 Nm3/h hydrogen production, of which EUT, MBP, and NPC were previously not assessed. Previously unreported design for reversible LOHC dehydrogenation process intensification which utilizes all four candidates in a temperature-cascade (TC) dehydrogenation was demonstrated and compared with four single LOHC cases on the same hydrogen output scale. Total installed costs for five cases were assessed to range from 2 to 3 million USD, while total capital investments (including a monthly supply of the LOHC chemical) were assessed to range from 24 to 44 million USD. Furthermore, it was determined that the largest percentages of total installed costs and operating costs for all cases were the reactor section and annual LOHC shipping respectively. EUT and MBP systems were determined to be the most sensitive to the variation of the dehydrogenation process parameters and generally more unreliable when the temperature of the heat source approached their reaction temperature. On the other hand, the TC system was proven to be notably more robust both in terms of process parameters as well as variable market conditions. Through extensive market uncertainty analysis (pertaining to LOHC purchase prices) and in combination with the TEA results and simulation models, linear relationships were derived for each of the five cases to predict hydrogen selling prices under varying LOHC prices. For the hydrogen minimum selling price to be 3.5 USD/kg the purchase prices of LOHC chemicals would have to be 5.44, 4.74, 4.01, 4.12 USD/kg for EUT, MBP, NPC and NEC respectively. Finally, the economic viability of the TC system was quantified, and it was concluded that it would be a justifiable investment if: • A significant variability of the heat source quality (temperature) is to be expected and/or • The volatility of the LOHC chemical market prices is expected to be prolonged Based on these findings the future work will firstly include equally detailed process design and assessment of the hydrogenation (LOHC) charging process using these candidates and comparison with similar studies from literature. Secondly, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of “recyclable” and “one-way” LOHCs in a TEA and supply chain comparison study. And finally, selecting the most viable candidate and designing a system for LOHC based clean propulsion for tanker shipping."
