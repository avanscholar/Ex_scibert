0,Introduction,"Nowadays, approximately 85% of the global energy needs are met by fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the depletion of their natural reserves, together with CO2 emissions are forcing the development of new technologies for energy production. In this context, H2 is presented as an alternative to diesel and gasoline to be utilized in fuel cells for energy production, e.g. in the transport sector. However, H2 is scarce in the atmosphere (~0.01% in volume in pure air). Therefore, this fuel must be obtained from raw materials with H-content such as water, hydrocarbons or alcohols that can be derived from biomass. Besides steam reforming of hydrocarbons (mainly methane) and electrolytic decomposition of water, which are typically used at an industrial/commercial level [1], non-thermal plasma technology is emerging as an alternative to those methods being researched due to its multiple advantages such as the possibility of producing hydrogen from a source different to water as through an eco-friendly process as compared to water electrolysis and steam reforming, respectively [1,2]. Plasmas are matter at highly energetic states, containing electrons, ions and free radicals, among other active species. As a result, such a reactive media can effectively provide the energy required for endothermic decomposition of H2 precursor molecules. The use of plasmas for organic H2-enriched decomposition is emerging due to their higher energy efficiency, lower energy consumption or easier maintenance than other techniques [3]. Particularly, due to plasma non-equilibrium properties, non-thermal plasmas are of special interest since they offer the possibility of working with comparatively low gas temperatures, which can be as low as room temperature, while the electrons reach much higher temperatures [3], thus avoiding unnecessary gas heating (and undesired related reactions e.g. combustion) while ensuring that electrons, responsible for breaking the molecular bonds of H2 precursors, have enough energy to that end. Currently, plasma-based H2 production has been achieved by non-thermal plasma decomposition of methane by nanosecond pulsed plasma [4,5], rotating gliding arc [6] or plasma torches [7]; by the decomposition of ethanol [8–10] or even by the cracking of naphtha in a pulsed dielectric barrier discharge reactor [11]. Among different non-thermal plasma sources, microwave discharges (MIPs) stand out because of their exceptional properties for the process development at industrial scale thanks to their high stability and reproducibility within a wide range of operational conditions, as well as the possibility of working in atmospheric pressure operational regime. For H2 production, electrodeless microwave plasmas have shown higher precursor (hydrocarbon/alcohols) conversion rates (>90%), in contrast to other non-thermal plasma sources (DBD, gliding arc or corona) [3]. In this sense, a waveguided-based cylindrical nozzles microwave power source (MPS) was satisfactorily utilized to convert methane [12–15], ethanol [16–19], isopropanol [18], kerosene [20] or synthetic biogas [21] into concentrated mixtures of H2 and carbon monoxide, together with other light hydrocarbons. Furthermore, in most of the cases, solid carbon formation was also noticed. Surface-wave discharges (SWDs), a special type of MIP, have been also utilized for the reforming of methanol and ethanol into H2, CO and solid carbon by achieving an almost complete (close to 100%) conversion [22]. Interestingly, the solid carbon obtained through the decomposition process was identified as graphene sheets [23]. Moreover, higher energetic H2 mass yield can be achieved using a ‘vortex’-type gas flow [24]. These types of discharges have also been researched for H2 production from the decomposition of methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol into H2, among other by-products [25]. Furthermore, in [26] a prominent H2 production (close to 2.5 mol per mole of ethanol fed to the discharge) together with CO and C2H2 using a SWD was reported. Again, solid carbon formation was noticed and resulted to be a mixture of nanostructured carbon species (multiwall carbon nanotubes and graphene) [27]. MIP torches are devices of special interest thanks to their higher tolerance to sample injection and their facility to withstand larger amounts of power delivered to the discharge, which is of special interest for H2 production. In [28], methane and ethane were introduced into an argon microwave plasma torch producing mainly H2 and light hydrocarbons. A MIP torch researched for this purpose is the Torche à Injection Axiale sur Guide d’Ondes (TIAGO) [29]. With this microwave plasma source, ethanol was also utilized as H2 precursor, resulting in a great capability of the discharge to withstand ethanol introduction [30–31], together with high H2 selectivity as compared to other gaseous by-products at the plasma exit, such as C2H2 [30]. In addition, the existence of two different ethanol decomposition routes depending on the plasma gas temperature [32] was found: for temperatures higher than 4500 K gaseous and carbon powder (graphene [33]) were obtained as by-products, but for temperatures lower than 4500 K only gaseous by-products were found. However, many studies based on H2 production using plasma technology lack of a complete evaluation of the practical and energetic aspects of this promising technology. Keeping in mind the outstanding qualities of non-thermal microwave plasmas for H2 production together with its practical versatility, the aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of two different microwave-induced plasma sources for the generation of H2 from ethanol decomposition, emphasizing an energetic evaluation and other practical aspects having an impact on its potential industrial escalation. Ethanol was chosen because it can be derived from cereals or sugar cane, which is very attractive from an environmental point of view. Real-time Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis of the gaseous by-products at the plasma exit has been performed to study both the ethanol decomposition degree and H2 production yields. The performance of both a torch-like (TIAGO torch) plasma created open to the surrounding atmosphere and a SWD generated by surfatron structure inside a quartz tube have been studied in depth, assessing both devices in terms of their capability to withstand ethanol introduction and to decompose it, the formation of by-products during the plasma process, as well as H2 production rates (g h−1) and selectivity (%). Moreover, a complete energetic characterization of the process in both devices has been performed for a wide range of experimental conditions through the analysis of the specific energy input for ethanol decomposition (SEI) and the specific energy for H2 production (SEPH2)."
1,Experimental setup,"Fig. 1 shows a schematic drawing of the experimental setups used to assess the performance of both surfatron [34] and TIAGO as plasma sources [35] for hydrogen production. The surfatron-based discharge is generated inside a quartz tube of 1.5 and 4.0 mm inner and outer radii, respectively, whereas the discharge sustained using the waveguide-based structure TIAGO torch is formed at the tip of a cylindrical hollow metallic rod and expands into air. In this last case, a glass reactor was used to isolate the plasma from the open air atmosphere and to reduce the impact of instabilities such as air currents. The surfatron device was supplied with microwave (2.45 GHz) power with a SAIREM GMP 03 k/SM generator of 250 W maximum power by means of a coaxial cable that limits the power fed to the discharge. For the TIAGO torch, a SAIREM GMP KG/D generator of 2000 W maximum power fed the microwave energy at one end of a surfaguide. In both cases, power generators worked in continuous mode and a triple stub was used to minimize the power reflected back to the generator. In the present study, the power supplied to the surfatron was 200 W, while it ranged between 200 and 500 W for the TIAGO torch, depending on the amount of ethanol introduced. High purity (>99.999%, Linde) Ar gas was used to feed the discharge with different gas mass-flow controllers (HI-TEC, Bronkhorst) having minimum and maximum flow limits of 0.1 and 5.0 L min−1, respectively, depending on the requirements of the experiments. Ethanol (99.5%, Panreac) input was controlled using a gas phase liquid delivery system (CEM, Bronkhorst) with 0.20 – 10.00 ethanol g h−1 lower and upper limits, respectively. Once the ethanol was vaporized, it was led to the plasma within a steel tube heated at 110 °C to prevent ethanol condensation, which could result in plasma extinction. This system allows for a better time response, accuracy and long-term stability as compared to the bubbling system used in other studies [22,24–25]. The capability of both discharges to break the molecular bonds of ethanol had already been determined in previous studies by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) [30–31], which provides insightful information concerning the processes taking place inside the plasma. The composition of the gas exiting the discharge was analyzed using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS; Prisma, Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology) operated at a pressure of ca. 4.5·10-6 mbar and previously calibrated for H2 quantification. The uncertainty of the obtained results was lower than 2%. A filter to prevent solid carbon by-products from entering the mass spectrometer was placed between the plasma exit and the spectrometer probe [26]. With the purpose of making a complete comparison of the performance of both discharges, different Ar flows and ethanol inputs were tested. In the case of TIAGO torch, ethanol flows ranged from 0.22 to 7.60 g h−1 with Ar flows varying from 0.15 to 1.00 L min−1. For surfatron discharges, ethanol flows ranged from 0.22 to 1.20 g h−1, while Ar flows varied from 0.50 to 1.50 L min−1. These conditions were chosen in agreement with the operational limits studied in the following section."
2,Operational limits of the microwave plasma sources for the introduction of ethanol,"While parameters such as the efficiency and/or selectivity of the processes are very important for its energetic evaluation, industrial escalation requires also knowing how much H2 can be produced per unit time, which is mainly limited by the rate at which the precursor (ethanol) can be processed. Indeed, as previously stated, introducing a large ethanol amount into the gas-stream on which the discharge is sustained, could result in plasma extinction [30]. Thus, besides understanding the effects of introducing ethanol into the plasma, it is crucial to know if there is any limit to the amount of ethanol that can be introduced in the discharge, depending on other experimental conditions. When ethanol is introduced into an argon discharge, its appearance undergoes several changes as it can be observed in Fig. 2 . In the TIAGO torch, when ethanol is added, the most energetic part of the plasma (dart) reduces its length while its broader shell (plume) expands into the reactor (for details concerning the dart and plume region see ref. 29). For the surfatron discharge, the length reduction of the plasma column is also observed. In both cases, the shortening observed in the plasmas after the ethanol introduction is due to the collisions of electrons belonging to the bulk of the electron energy distribution function, not only with Ar atoms but also with alcohol molecules. Therefore, the stepwise formation of free electrons in the plasma from Ar atoms decreases and the plasma region exhibits lower length than in the case of pure Ar plasma [26,31]. Other macroscopic dissimilarity between the appearance of an Ar and Ar-ethanol discharges is the change in plasma colour, which reflects modifications in the optical emission spectra and, subsequently, in the internal kinetics of the plasma [36,37]. These changes in the internal kinetics include processes leading to break the molecular bonds and/or the excitation of molecular fragments that require part of the energy that, otherwise, would be utilized to sustain the discharge, as it has been mentioned. Therefore, for a given power, there is a maximum amount of ethanol that can be fed to the discharge before it extinguishes. To evaluate the capability of both devices to withstand ethanol introduction, different experimental conditions were tested. The procedure consisted in igniting an Ar discharge with a given Ar flow rate and input power applied. From these initial conditions, an ethanol flow is added and systematically increased until a quantity (maximum ethanol inlet, E t O H max ) resulted in plasma extinction or reflected powers larger than 5%. In this last case, for larger reflected power values, optimal energy coupling conditions between the transmission line and the plasma impedance is not ensured [29]. For the TIAGO torch, this procedure was repeated for several powers and argon gas flows in the 200 – 500 W and 0.15 – 1.00 L min−1 ranges, respectively. As for the surfatron, only 200 W was considered because lower power values resulted in unstable plasma operation, while the use of larger powers is limited due to potential damages on the coaxial cable that feeds the antenna and couples the energy to the plasma when reaching the upper limit (250 W) of the power supply. Regarding the gas flow rate in this last device, it ranged between 0.50 and 1.50 L min−1. Fig. 3a. shows the operational limits of both the TIAGO torch and surfatron devices in terms of maximum ethanol inlet versus the total gas flow for the considered set of applied powers. As it can be observed, the TIAGO torch allows working with larger ethanol flow rates even in the case of relatively low powers. This is related to the fact that the power supplied to the TIAGO torch discharge is dissipated in a much smaller volume [29] as compared to the case of the surfatron [38], which is translated into values of power densities around 600 and 1.3 kW cm−3, respectively [38,39]. This ensures enough energy availability to completely break the molecular bonds and to sustain the TIAGO torch discharge. Thus, a higher robustness is found for the TIAGO discharge, capable of withstanding larger ethanol flow rates, as compared to the surfatron plasma. These results match with the superior tolerance to organic compound introduction found in other torch-like MIP devices as compared to plasmas sustained in cavities or SWDs [39]. On the other hand, representing the maximum ethanol inlet concentration withstood by the discharge (Fig. 3b.)shows that, for a given power, this limit is almost constant regardless of the argon flow rate (although an exception is found at 500 W). From Fig. 3b., a limit of 0.7% ethanol percentage over the total gas flow can be set for the surfatron working at 200 W, while the TIAGO torch is able to work with ethanol concentrations ~ 1.8% for the same power. Besides, for the TIAGO torch device, increasing the power supplied to the discharge results on an increase of the maximum ethanol flow withstood by the discharge up to values near to 12.0% for powers of 500 W. Furthermore, Fig. 3 . shows that the TIAGO can stably operate with gas flow rates lower than 0.50 L min−1, an advantage over the Torche à Injection Axiale (TIA) device, which needs gas flow rates>3.00 L min−1 to operate correctly [40], as well as compared to other high-power microwave torches requiring working flows of 25–65 L min−1 for decomposing ethanol [16,17,19]. This is an interesting fact, since the decomposition of ethanol takes place mainly in the most active part of the discharge, which has a very small volume. Thus, using lower total gas flows implies an increase in the residence time of the introduced molecules within the discharge, a favorable factor for the decomposition of ethanol molecules [41]. Furthermore, results from Fig. 3. are valuable for establishing a first comparison in term of robustness between TIAGO torch and surfatron discharges. Nevertheless, it is also important to determine whether ethanol introduced in the discharges is efficiently decomposed or not, and the resulting by-products obtained after ethanol decomposition, which are deeply discussed in the following sections as a necessary preliminary step before its energy evaluation."
3,Ethanol conversion degree and gaseous by-products formation,"To study molecular H2 formation and the main gaseous by-products obtained at the discharge exit after ethanol decomposition by both discharges, the previously described mass spectrometer was utilized. From the reactor, a 2 ml min−1 flow of the gas exhaust stream was sampled directly for online and real time gas analysis, recording fragments peaks from m/z = 1 to 85 a.m.u. (atomic mass unity). As it was previously described in [26], the different gaseous by-products can be identified by the comparison of the relative intensities of mass fragments, according to the NIST Chemistry Webbook Mass Spectrometry database [42]. In addition, changes on the intensity of the associated mass fragments produced by different gaseous substances provide valuable information concerning the concentration of the by-products in the total gas exhaust."
4,Ethanol conversion degree,"4.1 Ethanol conversion degree To compare the capability of both discharges for ethanol decomposition, Ethanol conversion ( C EtOH ) was calculated as (1). To that end, the mass fragment at 31 a.m.u., which is the base peak of ethanol corresponding to hydroxymethyl cation (+CH2OH), was monitored. The monitored mass fragment is not shared with any of the by-products generated in both devices (surfatron and TIAGO), as verified in the mass spectra database [42]. In (1), EtOH fed is the ethanol amount introduced into the discharge and EtOH con is the amount of ethanol consumed into the plasma. It is worth mentioning that EtOH con is obtained by subtracting the intensity of the 31 a.m.u. mass signal when the plasma is on (i.e. ethanol not decomposed) from the signal corresponding to the plasma off ( EtOH fed ). (1) C EtOH = EtOH con EtOH fed ∙ 100 % To deeply identify the limits of both microwave sources in terms of the maximum amount of ethanol that can be decomposed, ethanol conversion degree is reported in Tables 1 and 2 for the maximum ethanol amounts withstood at 200 W and the same conditions shown in Fig. 3. As it can be observed in Fig. 3, not only TIAGO torch did show its superiority to withstand the introduction of higher ethanol concentrations, but also to completely decompose it, i.e. conversion rates were higher than 99% for all experimental conditions of Ar and Ethanol flow rates (Table 1) in contrast to values related to surfatron device performance (Table 2). However, it must be also noted that the surfatron is limited to work with powers lower than the TIAGO torch, thus restricting the amount of energy supplied to the plasma and consequently limiting the decomposition of larger ethanol amounts [29]. Additional information about the ethanol decomposition capability of both plasma sources can be extracted from Fig. 4 ., where it can be observed that, for the same experimental conditions, ethanol introduced into the TIAGO torch plasma is almost completely decomposed regardless of the main argon flow as compared to surfatron-based discharges. The better performance of TIAGO torch for the conversion of ethanol molecules is probably owing to the higher number of electrons available in the discharge [43] as compared to surfatron [44]. In plasmas, electrons take the energy from the electromagnetic field and distribute it among the rest of plasma particles (atoms, ions and radicals) by collisions. Consequently, higher efficiency for ethanol decomposition and conversion is expected from the plasma exhibiting the highest electron density and energy [41]. However, in microwave plasmas, electron density is closely related to the power density value, i.e. the higher the density power, the higher the electron density value [38]. As it has been mentioned in Section 3, the power density for TIAGO torch (600 kW cm−3) is much higher than that generated by surfatron device (1.3 kW cm−3). Thus, the electron density in the TIAGO torch is one order greater (1015 cm−3) [29,43] than in the surfatron discharge (1014 cm−3) [38,44], favouring ethanol decomposition and allowing for conversion values close to 100%. Besides, the use of higher Ar flow rates reduce the residence time of the ethanol molecules into the discharge, together with the number of collisions with plasma electrons. For a fixed microwave power, this fact has a larger influence in the surfatron plasma owing to its lower electron and power densities as compared to TIAGO torch. As a result, the values of ethanol conversion ( C EtOH ) decrease with the utilized Ar flow rate for surfatron discharges, while remaining constant in the TIAGO discharges."
5,H2 and by-products production,"4.2 H2 and by-products production Concerning the formation of by-products from ethanol decomposition, both microwave-based plasma sources were tested under different experimental conditions of ethanol and argon flows. Mass fragments ascribed to H2, CH4, H2O, C2H2, CO and CO2 are monitored under the experimental conditions previously described. According to previous research works [26,32], H2 and CO are the main gaseous by-products obtained by ethanol decomposition by both microwave devices. In the case of the surfatron, C2H2 is also obtained as well as solid carbon and CH4 traces [26,31]. Nevertheless, TIAGO torch discharges form other by-products depending on the influence of the residual air surrounding the discharge; C2H2 traces as well as solid carbon are obtained when the air entrance into the plasma is negligible, whereas the formation of CO2 and H2O is favoured as significant quantities of air enters into the discharge [30–32]. The influence of ethanol input flow on gaseous by-products formation and their concentrations appears depicted in Fig. 5 for both microwave discharges sustained at 200 W and Ar flows of 0.50 and 1.00 L min−1. On the other hand, Fig. 6 depicts the dependence of by-products formation and their concentrations in the Ar gas flow for a constant ethanol percentage fed to the discharge (4% in TIAGO torch and 0.5% in surfatron discharges). It is worth mentioning that in both figures (Figs. 5 and 6), Irel is the ratio between the intensity of the mass fragment m/z and the Ar signal, being the latter the major component in the gas mixture. Since the mass fragment intensity represents the partial pressure of the gaseous compound in the Ar-Ethanol mixture, Irel can be considered proportional to the percentage of each compound in the total gas mixture. 4.2.1 Influence of the ethanol flow Fig. 5 shows the intensity of the mass peaks ascribed to H2 (Fig. 5a), CH4 (Fig. 5b), H2O (Fig. 5c), C2H2 (Fig. 5d), CO (Fig. 5e) and CO2 (Fig. 5f). Eventually, the formation of molecular O2 is not considered in any condition nor microwave plasma source because of the negligible signal of its associated mass fragments (16 and 32 a.m.u.). According to Fig. 5, exhaust gases produced at the exit of TIAGO torch discharges strongly depend on both Ar and Ethanol flows. For either low Ar or Ethanol flows (i.e. greater influence of air into the discharge), the main gases are H2, CO, H2O and CO2. Whereas, if any of them increases, the chemistry of TIAGO torch discharge is altered and the production of CO is favoured respect to CO2, together with the formation of C2H2 and solid carbon. In addition, negligible amounts of CH4, HCN or C2H4 (neither HCN nor C2H4 are shown in Fig. 5) are formed at trace level for all the experimental conditions. Focusing on the composition of the gas exhaust obtained at the exit of surfatron Ar/ethanol discharges, when the ethanol flow rate increases, the plasma kinetics is not significantly modified due to the limited interaction between the discharge and the external atmosphere outside the quartz tube that would otherwise introduce certain amounts of N2 and O2 into the discharge reactor. In this sense, H2, CO, C2H2 and CH4 production is favoured. However, increasing ethanol concentration by reducing Ar flow also results in larger concentrations of H2, CO and C2H2 but with a lower concentration of CH4 in the gaseous mixture, as it was reported in [26]. As for the generation of H2O and CO2, both gaseous by-products are formed in very small amounts (around 10-3 of relative intensity or below) regardless of the experimental conditions considered. It is important to remark that, independently of the ethanol amount, no difference is observed in the nature of the by-products in the gas exhaust stream, since no changes in the mass spectra are observed. Moving to H2 production performance, Fig. 5a shows that an increase in the argon flow rate used in surfatron discharges results in a slight reduction of H2 concentration in the final gas mixture which can be attributed to shorter residence times at those conditions. Such a dependence is not observed in TIAGO torch discharges since changes in argon flow not only impacts on residence time, but also on the air isolation of the discharge and thus in changes in ethanol decomposition reaction [32]. For lower concentrations of ethanol, surfatron-based discharges produce higher concentration of H2 than TIAGO torch plasmas. This difference can be due to the fact that water is formed in TIAGO torch discharges under those conditions, especially, considering the smallest Ar flow. As ethanol concentration increases, the capability of surfatron device to produce H2 does not change significantly, though favouring the formation of C2H2 and CH4. In contrast, for TIAGO torch plasmas, increasing the ethanol flow rate results in different plasma kinetics and water production tends to decrease, resulting in an increase of H2 and acetylene. From the analysis of the exhaust gas at the plasma exit (Fig. 5), together with the results of previous Optical Emission Spectrometry studies [30–32], plasma species can be identified as precursors for the formation of different gaseous by-products. On the one hand, C2H2 is likely to be formed from C2 plasma species, as pointed out in [32]. Furthermore, as reported in previous investigations [26,32,45,46], the production of carbon powders takes place together with the formation of C2H2. According to [32,47], C2H2 production is favoured in discharges exhibiting large gas temperatures (>3000 K), being the gas temperature of the two Ar/Ethanol plasmas generated by surfatron [26] and TIAGO [32] around 3800 K under the same experimental conditions of Ar and ethanol flows. This result shows that acetylene production, mainly depends on the gas temperature rather than the specific device utilized to generate the plasma. As for HCN, it may be formed via CN plasma species coming from N2 residues from the content-air in the reactor and carbon from ethanol decomposition, reacting with H [32,48]. 4.2.2 Influence of the total gas flow To infer the importance of the Ar gas flow in the exhaust gaseous by-products formation, mass fragments ascribed to H2, CH4, H2O, C2H2, CO and CO2 were monitored (Fig. 6) for constant ethanol concentration conditions in both TIAGO torch and surfatron discharges. In the case of the plasmas sustained with the plasma torch, the applied power was equal to 400 W and Ar and ethanol amounts were modified while keeping an ethanol percentage in the mixture close to 4% (Fig. 6a); meanwhile, for plasmas generated with the surfatron device at 200 W, a 0.5% ethanol concentration was tested (Fig. 6b). Observing Fig. 6a, molecular H2 is always produced independently of Ar gas flow employed, but different by-products are found for larger argon gas flows. When a small Ar flow is used to generate the TIAGO discharge, air components such as O2 and N2 can penetrate inside the quartz chamber more easily, favoring reactions leading to H2O and CO2 formation [30,32]. However, when the Ar flow is increased, the penetration of air into the discharge is reduced and gaseous by-products including H2, CO, C2H2, as well as carbon flakes deposited on the glass reactor walls [32]. These results agree with the changes in the optical emission of plasma species when ethanol amounts are increased, found in other publications [30–32]. Such effect is translated into different gases produced at the plasma exit (Fig. 5), showing that Ar flow rates are important enough to affect plasma kinetics [29] in the Ar-ethanol TIAGO torch discharge. For surfatron Ar/ethanol discharges, as it can be seen in Fig. 6b, similar gaseous by-products, together with carbon solid material, are obtained when keeping a constant ethanol flow regardless of the total gas flow. Nevertheless, the organic compound is not completely decomposed, (see Table 2), which can be ascribed to lower residence time produced by higher flow rates, as it was discussed in Section 4.1. 4.2.3 H2 production The production of H2 ( H 2 exp ) and the selectivity of ethanol conversion to H2 ( H 2 sel ) as a function of both Ar and ethanol flows are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 , respectively. Both discharges were sustained under the same operational conditions of 200 W and 0.5 and 1.0 L min−1 Ar flows. H2 selectivity ( H 2 sel ) , given by (2), is calculated from the H2 quantity experimentally obtained ( H 2 exp ) and the maximum H2 production theoretically expected ( H 2 max - t h ). (2) H 2 sel = H 2 exp H 2 max - t h ∙ 100 % In (2), H 2 max - t h was calculated considering an optimal stoichiometry of reaction (3); that is, considering that molecular H2 is the only H2-based gaseous by-product obtained from the conversion of ethanol molecules. (3) C 2 H 5 O H → 3 H 2 + C O + C As it can be observed in Fig. 7, a higher amount of H2 is obtained when smaller ethanol flows are introduced into a 0.50 L min−1 of argon discharge sustained with the surfatron plasma source, compared to TIAGO torch discharges sustained under the same experimental conditions. Nevertheless, increasing the argon flow rate in surfatron discharges results in a decrease of H2 production, which is related to both a lower conversion degree of ethanol molecules (see Fig. 4), as well as a reduction in the residence time of those molecules, discussed in Section 4.1, and to the discharge volume reduction mentioned in [26]. As for H2 production from the decomposition of ethanol in the TIAGO torch device, increasing both ethanol and Ar flows results in higher amounts of H2 produced, which is again related to a lower influence of the external air into the discharge kinetics, as previously discussed. A difference in efficiency of both devices in terms of process selectivity (or H2 production selectivity) can be derived from Fig. 8. In the case of discharges generated at low argon and ethanol flows, the surfatron device shows a better performance than the TIAGO torch. However, increasing both ethanol and Ar flows results in a larger H2 selectivity when using the TIAGO torch plasmas as compared to the surfatron device. The increase in H2 selectivity is closely linked to a lesser influence of the air surrounding the plasmas in TIAGO torch discharges. As it was discussed in Section 4.2, N2 and O2 from the air surrounding the TIAGO torch discharges highly influence plasma kinetics and by-products formation. Considering low Ar and Ethanol flow rates, the decomposition of ethanol into H2 is produced by a non-ecologically friendly process since CO2 is also obtained. In this case, the process shows that the formation of H2O competes (Fig. 5c) with H2, therefore, reducing its selectivity. Although at larger Ar or Ethanol flows small amounts of C2H2 are also produced together with H2, the latter route for the decomposition of ethanol is more efficient since H2 selectivity is larger. In the case of Ar/Ethanol surfatron discharges, according to Fig. 5, increasing either the Ethanol or Ar flow results in the formation of larger amounts of CH4 together with a lower ethanol conversion degree, which explains the lower H2 selectivity values. The H2 yield (ethanol conversion × hydrogen selectivity) is worth to be considered for the evaluation of both plasma sources for hydrogen production. Their values appear in Table 3 and have been calculated for the conditions of plasmas used in Figs. 7 and 8. As it can be observed, for TIAGO torch the maximum values are obtained for higher ethanol and Ar flows. Under these conditions, air entrance into the plasma is reduced, favouring the formation of H2 as compared to H2O. Contrarily, both higher ethanol and Ar flows lead to lower yields for surfatron discharges due to the significant influence of residence time and limited power for this kind of discharge, as discussed along the manuscript."
6,Energetic evaluation of plasma generated by TIAGO and surfatron devices,"In previous sections, values of ethanol conversion, H2 selectivity and yield have been presented and discussed, concluding that a more efficient H2 production is obtained for larger ethanol flow rates using the TIAGO torch for the operational conditions considered in the current study. However, for a complete evaluation of both discharges, they should be also analyzed from an energetic point of view. The amount of H2 produced per unit energy supplied to the discharge (H2 (g kW-1h−1)) can be calculated (Fig. 9 ) from the data presented in Fig. 7 (hydrogen production) as well as the energy supplied to sustain the discharges, i.e. 200 W. In general, the discharges sustained using the surfatron show a lower mass production of H2 per energy unit, as compared to the TIAGO torch (except for the lower ethanol flow rates). In the TIAGO torch, the amount of H2 produced per unit energy increases with the ethanol input, as well as with Ar flow rate. This result is linked to a lower atmospheric air entrance into the plasma, favouring the formation of H2 against other products such as HCN and CxHy [32]. From Fig. 9, one also observes that the obtained H2 is independent of the Ar flow for ethanol flows above 0.6 g h−1, decreasing the energy employed for its production. Moreover, this increase in the H2 production per unit energy is almost linear in the case of the discharges sustained with an Ar flow of 1 L min−1 for all the ethanol flows considered in the present study, while for the Ar flow of 0.5 L min−1, this trend disappears in the 0.2 to 0.8 g h−1 ethanol flow range. This is an interesting fact for later escalation of this technology to the industry, since a linear behaviour could be desirable as it results in an easier predictability system performance in terms of H2 production. The results obtained here are slightly better than those obtained using other low-flow microwave plasma torches [22,24]. Compared to high-flow plasma torches [16], our results show a lower performance in terms of mass-H2 generation per unit energy. However, in our case, much lower carrier-gas flows are required for proper operation of the discharge, and larger selectivities (ca. 80%) are obtained. The energy efficiency of a plasmas can be also evaluated through other parameters as the specific energy supplied for the ethanol decomposition (SEI) and the specific energy employed for H2 production (SEPH2). Specific energy input (SEI) is typically used to compare the performance levels of different devices as well as different operational conditions of a precursor for H2 production [49,50], and can be calculated from the ratio between the microwave power supplied to sustain the discharge and the precursor (ethanol) flow. As for the SEPH2, it can be calculated as the inverse of the H2 production per unit energy presented in Fig. 9. Consequently, low SEI and SEPH2 values are desirable since they stand for a lower energy required to process a mass unit of H2 precursor, and low energy consumption per mass H2 generated, respectively. SEI and SEPH2 values for both TIAGO and surfatron discharges have been depicted as a function of the ethanol flow rate in the same figure (Fig. 10 ) for comparison purposes. Obviously, for both TIAGO torch and surfatron discharges, SEI values are equal because they were generated under the same experimental conditions of power, showing the lower values for larger ethanol flows. In addition, these low values are comparable to those obtained by Heijkers et al. [50] when using microwave plasma to produce H2 by CH4 decomposition. The surfatron shows lower SEPH2 values for the lower ethanol flows, thus having a higher efficiency for H2 production under these conditions. However, in TIAGO torch, SEPH2 decreases with increasing ethanol flows up to 0.6 g h−1. From this ethanol amount, SEPH2 tends to be almost constant (1.6 kWh/g) regardless of the Ar gas-flow. These results, together with the conversion of ethanol in this discharge (Fig. 4) and the H2 production rates (Fig. 9), clearly show the superiority of the TIAGO torch towards its implementation at and industrial level in terms of both capacity and efficiency for ethanol processing and H2 production as compared to plasmas created by the surfatron. It is worth mentioning that the technology presented in this research is at an early stage of development and, despite the promising results derived in terms of hydrogen production, selectivity and energetic performance, still requires a thorough optimization. Therefore, drawing a comparison between plasma technology and other well-established techniques such as water electrolysis should be made cautiously. According to the bibliography, water electrolysis shows specific energy employed for H2 production values ranging from 0.050 [2] to 0.080 [51] kWh g−1, which is ~ 20 times the values obtained by the TIAGO torch. Nevertheless, as mentioned before, performance of TIAGO torch needs to be optimized and hence the specific energy for H2 production can be minimized. Indeed, as it can be read in [35] “it is possible to arrange TIAGOs in arrays to form a compact torch system which can be supplied with equal distribution of power between plasma flames from a single waveguide, that is, the TIAGOs arrays can be operated at 2.45 GHz with powers of a few hundred watts up to 2–3 kW per nozzle. This unique feature makes this device particularly suitable to be implemented at industrial level”. In this sense, the optimization of the technology can be carried out in future researches approching the industrial development of this hydrogen production technique. Finally, the use of other precursors less expensive than pure ethanol, e.g. hydrated-ethanol, could be considered for further investigations to optimize this technology."
7,Conclusions,"In this research, the influence of the operation conditions on ethanol decomposition and H2 production using TIAGO torch and surfatron microwave sources has been evaluated. TIAGO torch shows higher tolerance to ethanol introduction, as compared to surfatron device. Furthermore, Mass Spectrometry confirmed that the air atmosphere surrounding TIAGO torch plasmas has a noteworthy relevance in the species generated in the discharge together with the by-products at the plasma exit. Despite several drawbacks in the use of surfatron source to produce H2, such as its limited capability to withstand ethanol introduction and the low powers that can be applied, keeping the discharge inside the quartz tube avoids the contact with the air, which is one of the most important strengths of this microwave source in comparison to TIAGO device. Ethanol reforming in surfatron discharges mainly produces syngas at the plasma exit in contrast to the CO2 produced in TIAGO torch plasmas. Nevertheless, as it has been demonstrated, the use of larger Ar and ethanol flows avoids CO2 formation, thus producing H2 by a green process in contrast to steam reforming technique. Finally, a larger H2 production and selectivity is reached by TIAGO torch plasma together with lower specific energies involved for the ethanol decomposition and specific energies employed for H2 production. These results point out its suitability in terms of robustness and production for scaling this technology to the industry for the H2 production, as well as to its better energetic performance.”"
