0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels, which are used as a major resource in the present era, have many problems. These include the problem of reserve depletion, environmental pollution, climate change, and international conflicts due to supply and demand instability (Abas et al., 2015). Given this with the advance in technologies, interests in alternative energy sources, including solar, geothermal, hydrogen, and biomass, are renewed and growing over time. Alternative energy is characterized by no pollutants and no depletion (Panwar et al., 2011). Among the alternative energy sources, biodiesel is a fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) made by reacting eco-friendly oils such as vegetable oil, algae oil, and animal fat with alcohol. Biodiesel contains oxygen, which is why it is completely burned and fewer pollutants are released (Canakci and Van Gerpen, 2001; Fukuda et al., 2001; Srivastava and Prasad, 2000). It also has a faster cycle of ecosystems, which has less impact on climate change than fossil fuels (Shirvani et al., 2011). The transesterification reaction of acid/alkali catalysts and triglycerides is key to the typical biodiesel manufacturing method presented in Fig. 1 . Besides, the conventional biodiesel production process has the catalytic neutralization, cleaning, and drying process (Van Gerpen, 2005a, b). The process of using supercritical fluids considered in this study is also attracting attention as a biodiesel production process. Since the methanol acts as both a medium and a reactant and the reaction proceeds without a catalyst, no process is needed for catalyst separation or cleaning. In addition, the reaction time is shorter than those of the acid/alkali catalyst processes (Demirbaş, 2003; Kusdiana and Saka, 2001; Warabi et al., 2004). However, due to the nature of supercritical fluids, processes involving supercritical fluids are deemed to be less economical in terms of facility and operation costs because they require high temperature and pressure compared to the commercialized biodiesel process (Demirbas, 2006; Haas et al., 2006). Most of the economic studies on biodiesel production processes have been conducted via process simulation. Zhang et al. (2003a, b) carried out the process design and economic analysis of four conventional biodiesel production processes using virgin vegetable oil or waste cooking oil under alkali- or acid-catalyzed process. West et al. (2008) analyzed four continuous biodiesel production processes using waste cooking oil; traditional homogeneous alkali and acid-catalyzed process; a heterogeneous acid-catalyzed process; and a supercritical process. They showed that the supercritical process was the second most profitable process next to the heterogeneous acidic catalyzed process. Lim et al. (2009) conducted an economic analysis of the supercritical processes of three different reaction conditions using rapeseed oil and compared them with the conventional alkali-catalyzed process. The results showed that the supercritical process was more profitable than the alkali-catalyzed process. Although the total capital cost of the supercritical process was higher than that of the alkali-catalyzed process, the lower manufacturing cost of the supercritical process resulted in a shorter payout time than the alkali-catalyzed process owing to the higher glycerol credit and the absence of catalyst and solvents. Lee et al. (2011) evaluated the costs of three biodiesel production processes: conventional alkali-catalyzed processes using fresh and waste vegetable oil; and a supercritical methanol process using waste vegetable oil (WVO) as the raw material. They used the Aspen In-Plant Cost Estimator to investigate the sensitivity of net present values (NPVs) to the changes of five parameters: the price of oil feed; glycerol credit; biodiesel selling price; interest rate; and the lifespan of a plant. The results showed that the oil feed cost accounted for 64–84% of the biodiesel manufacturing cost and the supercritical process using WVO was the most profitable process. Sakdasri et al. (2018) conducted a techno-economic analysis of producing 40,000 tonnes/yr biodiesel from palm oil for three processes: a homogeneous alkali-catalyzed process (Alkali-cat); a conventional supercritical methanol process (C-SCM); and a supercritical methanol process with low methanol to oil molar ratio (L-SCM). They showed that the L-SCM was the most financially promising option and C-SCM process was not profitable. The economic analysis results showed that the palm oil purchase price and biodiesel selling price were the most significant parameters affecting the NPVs. As mentioned earlier, in the biodiesel production process using supercritical fluids, reactions can proceed with supercritical methanol without a catalyst. Nevertheless, studies have been conducted on the use of several catalysts due to increased reaction rates and improved biodiesel quality. Shin et al. (2013) studied the reactions of transesterification and partial hydrogenation simultaneously using Cu catalysts, and Lee et al. (2020) have found that Pd/Al2O3 and Ni can also play the same role as Cu. In the case of Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogenation occurs well and the FAMEs conversion is maintained high over a wide range of the pressure. The Cu catalyst has a high value of the FAMEs conversion at low pressure and shows a high selectivity of C18:1 (methyl oleate). Ni catalyst has a low value of FAMEs conversion but has a high selectivity of C18:1 at low pressures. Using these catalysts increases the selectivity of C18:1 in biodiesel through hydrogenation reactions. The cold flow property and oxidation stability are some of the important characteristics of biodiesel, which are related to the length of the carbon chain and the number of double bonds. Unsaturation results in good cold flow property and low oxidation stability. Saturation results in good oxidation stability, while less desirable cold flow property. C18:1 is known as a good material for biodiesel because these two properties are balanced. Although studies have been conducted on various catalysts for biodiesel production using supercritical fluids, there exist few studies on which processes are most competitive when designing actual processes using these catalysts, especially the biodiesel production process through simultaneous supercritical transesterification and partial hydrogenation (SSTPH). In this study, we conducted a kinetic study for producing biodiesel from soybean oil, known to be inexpensive and unsaturated (Lee et al., 2020). Conversion and reaction conditions have a significant impact on economic feasibility in the biodiesel production process. In the case of Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, the conversion is high and the reaction speed is faster than other catalysts under the same conditions (Demirbas, 2005), which has the advantage of being able to select mild reaction conditions. Therefore, we used Pd/Al2O3 because of economic feasibility. The three biodiesel production processes, which are the conventional non-catalyst supercritical transesterification process (He et al., 2007), the SSTPH process with Cu catalyst (Acree and Chickos, 2020), and the SSTPH process with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst based on experimental data, were designed and economically compared. In Section 2, we present the experimental methods of a lab-scale SSTPH reactor. In Section 3, we describe the process simulation models for three biodiesel production processes. In Section 4, the economic assessments of three biodiesel production processes are analyzed and compared to each other. Finally, Section 5 provides concluding remarks."
1,Experimental,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials Baekseol soybean oil (CJ, South Korea) was used as the reactant. Additional reagents used were methanol (99.5%, Samchun, South Korea) as a reactant, n-heptane (99.0%, Samchun, South Korea) and methyl heptadecanoate (C17:0, Sigma-Aldrich, South Korea) for GC analysis, and Pd/Al2O3 (5% Palladium, Sigma-Aldrich, South Korea)."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup The conceptual design of the process was conducted using Aspen HYSYS commercial process flowsheet software, which requires the input of the reaction kinetics. To estimate the kinetic values at different temperatures, changes in the concentrations of each reactant and product with temperature and time were measured using a 22 mL column-type stainless steel batch reactor with the height of 12.5 cm and the diameter of 1.5 cm. Soybean oil was used as the raw material, supercritical methanol as the reaction medium and reactant, and the reaction was performed using the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The pressure was maintained at 100 bar, and the temperatures were set to 280, 300, and 320 °C. The reactions were conducted for 10, 20, 30, and 40 min. In total, 12 combinations were tested. The quantity of reactants was first determined by inversely calculating the amount of methanol, referring to the volume of the reactors and the methanol density data in the NIST Chemistry Webbook to meet the pressure conditions (Acree and Chickos, 2020). The feed ratio of soybean oil to methanol was 1:45. The catalyst-to-reactant ratio was 1 mg of catalyst per g of reactant. The reactants were injected into the reactor in the following order: soybean oil, methanol, and Pd/Al2O3. The reaction was performed at the specified time and temperature. When the room temperature reactor was placed in the salt bath, the reaction begins because of the phase change of methanol from liquid to supercritical. During the reaction, the salt bath maintained isothermal conditions. After the reaction, we opened the reactor to release the light gases through the hood. Then the glycerol and unreacted TG were removed by centrifugation, and the FAMEs and methanol were separated by rotary evaporation. GC-FID (Agilent, HP-6890) was performed using capillary columns (Agilent, HP-INNOWAX, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The helium carrier gas was set to a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The temperature was set to rise at 5 °C per minute, starting at 260 °C for the detector and 150–250 °C for the oven. The split ratio was set to 100:1, and methyl heptadecanoate, which is not present in the product, was used as a reference material to quantify the amount of FAMEs in the product. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the experiment for SSTPH biodiesel production."
4,Reaction kinetics,"2.3 Reaction kinetics Three assumptions were made for the process simulation using Aspen HYSYS. First, the transesterification reaction occurs in three steps, but the overall reaction, a simplified one step reaction (Kusdiana and Saka, 2001), was considered; that is, the intermediate reactions of diglyceride and monoglyceride were ignored. Second, triglycerides are composed of the same type of fatty acid and are assumed to have no difference in reactivity. Third, methanol is assumed to be a hydrogen source for the hydrogen addition reactions (Shin et al., 2013). The reaction mechanisms established through these three assumptions are as follows: (1) T G + 3 · M ⇌ k 1 k 2 G L + 3 · M E (2) M L n + H 2 ⇌ k 3 k 4 M L (3) M L + H 2 ⇌ k 5 k 6 M O (4) M O + H 2 ⇌ k 7 k 8 M S (5) M ⇌ k 9 k 10 2 · H 2 + C O where TG is triglyceride, MLn is methyl linolenate, ML is methyl linoleate, MO is methyl oleate, MS is methyl stearate, M is methanol, H2 is hydrogen, CO is carbon monoxide, GL is glycerol, and ME is methyl ester. The reaction mechanism consists of five reactions. The reaction rate constants (k1–k10), which follow the elementary reaction rate equations, corresponding to the forward and reverse of these five reactions, were numbered in order. The unit of the reaction rate constant is determined by the reaction order. We then derived differential reaction rate equations based on the aforementioned reaction mechanism and three assumptions to obtain the reaction rate constants and compared the results to experimental data. TG and GL can be expressed simply because they are produced and consumed only by reaction (1). The forward reaction can be expressed in terms of the reverse reaction, which allows the expression of TG and GL to be established by: (6) d T G d t = - k 1 T G M 3 + k 2 G L M E 3 (7) d G L d t = - k 2 G L M E 3 + k 1 T G M 3 The concentrations of the FAMEs MLn, ML, MO, and MS are affected by the transesterification of reaction (1) produced by TG and interconverted by hydrogenation in reactions (2)–(4). The differential rate equations for reactions (2)–(4) can be expressed relatively simply. (8) d M L n d t = - k 3 M L n H 2 + k 4 M L (9) d M L d t = - k 4 M L - k 5 M L H 2 + k 6 M O + k 3 M L n H 2 (10) d M O d t = - k 6 M O - k 7 M O H 2 + k 8 M S + k 5 M L H 2 (11) d M S d t = - k 8 M S + k 7 [ M O ] [ H 2 ] ME in reaction (1) includes MLn, ML, MO, MS, and methyl palmitate (MP). Considering the change in MLn concentration as an example, the rate of the reverse of reaction (1) decreases only when MLn among Me reacts with GL, and in the forward reaction, the proportion of MLn among ME in the TG state leads to an increase in MLn concentration. The ME present in the TG state can be represented as the difference between the initial and resultant ME, which is also the case with MLn. Hence, we can express the differential reaction rate as follows: (12) d M L n d t = - 3 k 2 G L M L n 3 + 3 k 1 T G M 3 M L n 0 - [ M L n ] M E 0 - [ M E ] When the expressions from reactions (2)–(4) are combined, the differential velocity expression for each chemical species is expressed by Eqs. (13)–(16). (13) d M L n d t = - k 3 M L n H 2 + k 4 M L - 3 k 2 G L M L n 3 + 3 k 1 T G M 3 M L n 0 - [ M L n ] M E 0 - [ M E ] (14) d M L d t = - k 4 M L - k 5 M L H 2 + k 6 M O + k 3 M L n H 2 - 3 k 2 G L M L 3 + 3 k 1 T G M 3 M L 0 - [ M L ] M E 0 - [ M E ] (15) d M O d t = - k 6 M O - k 7 M O H 2 + k 8 M S + k 5 M L H 2 - 3 k 2 G L M O 3 + 3 k 1 T G M 3 M O 0 - [ M O ] M E 0 - [ M E ] (16) d M S d t = - k 8 M S + k 7 [ M O ] [ H 2 ] - 3 k 2 G L M S 3 + 3 k 1 T G M 3 M S 0 - [ M S ] M E 0 - [ M E ] M is produced and consumed in reactions (1) and (5). H2 is produced and consumed in reactions (2)–(5), and CO is produced and consumed in reaction (5). As in Section 2.4.1, the differential reaction rate equation is established using stoichiometric coefficients and the net generation of each species. (17) d M d t = - 3 k 1 T G M 3 + 3 k 2 G L M E 3 - k 9 M + k 10 H 2 2 C O (18) d H 2 d t = - k 3 M L n H 2 - k 5 M L H 2 - k 7 M O H 2 - 2 k 10 H 2 2 C O + k 4 M L + k 6 M O + k 8 M S + 2 k 9 [ M ] (19) d C O d t = - k 10 H 2 2 C O + k 9 [ M ] As previously mentioned, the ME in reaction (1) includes MLn, ML, MO, MS, and MP. Because MP is not present in the reactions, there is no expression of concentration to simplify the differential equation. ME should be expressed using only four chemical species (MLn, ML, MO, and MS), excluding MP. We assumed that there is no difference in the reactivity or the concentration ratio of the four chemical species, and that MP will remain the same as the initial value. This can be expressed by: (20) M E = M L n + M L + M O + [ M S ] I n i t i a l r a t e o f M E e x c l u d i n g M P The procedure to obtain kinetic parameters involves comparing the concentration data of each chemical species over time with the predetermined reaction mechanism. Because it is impossible to obtain analytical solutions (Qing et al., 2011), we created groups of kinetic parameters with slight variations in their values within a certain range, solved the differential equations using MATLAB for each group, and found those with the lowest standard deviation. A set of differential and algebraic equations for mass balance with kinetic expressions is summarized in Section A in the Supplementary Information."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis Soybean oil and supercritical methanol were reacted with the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. Experiments were conducted on a total of 12 cases, with a pressure of 100 bar, temperatures of 280, 300, and 320 °C, and reaction times of 10, 20, 30, and 40 min. Experiments were repeated three times at each case and the results are presented in Fig. 3 . The following notations are used: C16:0 is methyl palmitate (MP), C18:0 is methyl stearate (MS), C18:1 is methyl oleate (MO), C18:2 is methyl linoleate (ML), and C18:3 is methyl linolenate (MLn). The reaction rate constants obtained by comparing the differential reaction rate equation and the experimental results are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Information. The temperature and reaction rate constants were substituted into the Arrhenius expression to obtain the activation energy (E) and the pre-exponential factor (A) for each reaction, which is listed in Table 1 . (21) ln k = ln A - E / ( R T ) As shown in Table 1, all forward partial hydrogenation reactions, reactions (2–4), were favored in that they have higher pre-exponential factors (A) and lower activation energies (E) than those of their reverse counterparts. In addition, the more double bonds exist in methyl esters, the faster the partial hydrogenation occurs. In reactions (1–5) at 300 °C, equilibrium constants, which were estimated by dividing the forward reaction constant by that of the reverse, were approximately 2.78, 12275, 10909, 3.01, and 0.00712, respectively. It showed that high methyl oleate content in FAMEs could be obtained in that the reactions (2–3) have a high equilibrium constant and the equilibrium constant of reaction (4) is quite low. Besides, the equilibrium constant of reaction (4) is low, but if it is large, methanol would be decomposed much and the molar ratio of methanol to oil would be reduced. Although the reduction of methanol occurs during the reaction, it seems to be negligible for the decrease of FAMEs yield because the ratio was reduced less than 5 and the results were similar to those available in the literature (Shin et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2020)."
6,Process simulation,"In this section, we describe the simulation of the three biodiesel production processes. First, a continuous transesterification process, using a plug flow reactor (PFR) with supercritical methanol, called SC PFR, was simulated. Second and third, two SSTPH processes using packed bed reactors (PBRs) were simulated, one using a Cu-based catalyst, called Cu-based PBR, and the other using Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, called Pd-based PBR. The plant capacity of the biodiesel production process was assumed to be at 5000 kg/h based on 8000 operating hours per year. The process simulation was conducted using Aspen HYSYS® V11. The biodiesel production process can be decomposed into five processing units: heating and pressurization of raw materials such as methanol and soybean oil, biodiesel production reactions, methanol recovery, glycerol separation, and biodiesel purification. The process design was adopted based on the work of Zhang et al. (2003a). The reaction rates and operating conditions for the SC PFR and Cu-based PBR were based on the studies by He et al. (2007) and Shin et al. (2013), respectively. The reaction kinetics and operating conditions for the Pd-based PBR were simulated based on the experimental data described in the previous section. A comparison of the reaction rates between the values from the literature or experiment and simulation was shown in Section C in the Supplementary Information. The scope of this study was to consider a general configuration of the supercritical biodiesel production process (Zhang et al., 2003a; West et al., 2008; Lim et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011); that is, further process integration to reduce the consumption of energy and materials, such as process integration via organic Rankine cycle (Aboelazayem et al., 2021), using a spiral reactor (Farobie and Matsumura, 2015), and the addition of co-solvent (Trentin et al., 2011; Muppaneni et al., 2012; Da Silva et al., 2010; Muppaneni et al., 2013), was not considered. In addition, the light gases, which exists as a mixture of CO and H2, produced by the methanol decomposition in SSTPH could be converted to valuable products such as methanol (by integrating reverse water gas shift reaction), and H2 (by integrating the steam reforming or water gas shift reaction). Nevertheless, because the main focus in this study was to compare the economic profitability for different degrees of unsaturation of biodiesel product given the same feed oil (soybean oil) and reaction material (supercritical methanol), we decided to choose the general configuration and to ignore the light gas handling for consistency in comparative study."
7,Materials and thermodynamic model,"3.1 Materials and thermodynamic model In this study, soybean oil was used as raw material shown in Table 2 . Non-random two liquid (NTRL) activity coefficient model was selected as the thermodynamic property package owing to the presence of polar components. To estimate the binary interaction parameters which were not available in the Aspen properties, UNIFAC LLE with phase handling to VLL was used for the separation of two liquid phases between glycerol and FAMEs in the decanter and biodiesel purification (West et al., 2008; Ziyai et al., 2019). Because activity coefficient model such as NRTL and UNIFAC is not recommended to be used for pressures greater than 10 bar, the Predictive Soave Redlich Kwong (PSRK) equation of state (EOS), which is known as one of the most recommended EOS for handling the sub- and supercritical components of the mixture simultaneously (Ortiz and Kruse, 2020), was used in the process unit operations and streams for pressures greater than 10 bar. In particular, the PSRK with phase handling to liquid only was used to prevent and ignore the phase change in the reactor. Figure S2 in the Supplementary Information shows the schematic diagram of thermodynamic property packages."
8,Assumptions,"3.2 Assumptions • The plant capacity of 5000 kg/h with 8000 operating hours per year. • The unknown component, which is called Other in Table 2, was ignored. • The overall conversion rate of triolein was the same as the yield in the literature (Shin et al., 2013; He et al., 2007). • Pressure drop per tray in the column was set to 0.7 kPa and the rest was set to 0 kPa. • The minimum temperature approach for heat exchanger was set to 10 °C. • In the change of thermodynamic property package, pressure and enthalpy between upstream and downstream were set to equal."
9,SC PFR,"3.3 SC PFR Fig. 4 shows the process flow diagram and stream table of the SC PFR. Methanol (MeOH) and soybean oil (Feed_Oil) were pressurized to reach the reaction pressure (250 bar) using P-100 and P-101, respectively, and preheated through heat exchangers (E-100, E-101, and E-102, respectively) so that the temperature of the reactor inlet reached the reaction temperature (280 °C). Subsequently, methanol and soybean oil streams were mixed in a mixer (MIX-101) and flowed into the supercritical transesterification reactor (PFR-100 and PFR-101). For preventing the diameter of the reactor from exceeding 3 m, the reactant flow was split into two streams and two PFR reactors were used. In the SC PFR, the reaction condition and yield were obtained from the study by He et al. (2007), where the reaction temperature of 280 °C and pressure of 250 bar. Table 3 represents the summary of the reactions in the SC PFR. After the reactions, the reactor effluent stream contained excess methanol, glycerol, unreacted soybean oil, and the biodiesel product. The purified biodiesel was obtained through three separation steps: methanol recovery, glycerol separation, and biodiesel purification. First, a flash evaporator (V-100) and a five theoretical stages distillation column (T-100) were used to recover the excess methanol. The valve (VLV-100) was used to depressurize the reactor effluent stream from 25,000 kPa to 103.4 kPa in order to separate a significant portion of the methanol through the flash evaporator. The remaining methanol was further separated using the five-stage distillation column. The methanol recovery column is operable at the atmospheric pressure, but needs to be operated below 150 °C in order to avoid the glycerol thermal decomposition (Goodrum, 2002). After determining the minimum number of stages using a shortcut design method and the final number of stages based on Gilliland correlation (Robinson and Gilliland, 1950), case studies were conducted by manipulating the reflux ratio, and the number of total stages and the feed stage location to minimize the energy consumption. Consequently, 99.24% of the methanol in the reactor effluent stream was recovered through this procedure and mixed with fresh make-up methanol (MeOH stream). A cooler (E-104) was used to liquify the methanol to nullify the presence of vapor in the pump. After the methanol recovery step, the bottom of the distillation column T-100, including glycerol, unreacted soybean oil, and the biodiesel product, was cooled to 35 °C. As a result, two liquid phases were formed: the glycerol-rich phase and the biodiesel phase. The glycerol was separated as a byproduct using a decanter (Decanter). Finally, the biodiesel was refined using another five-stage distillation column (T-101) to satisfy the requirement of the maximum free glycerol content ( ≤ 0.02 wt%) according to ASTM D6751. Because FAMEs are susceptible to thermal decomposition above 250 °C (Newman, 1968), the top pressure of T-101 was set to 1.5 kPa to keep the temperature at a suitably low value. After determining the number of minimum stages similar to the methanol recovery column, case studies for the biodiesel purification column were also conducted. From the case studies, useful correlations were identified: first, the amount of biodiesel product was increased as the number of stages was reduced; second, the content of biodiesel in the bottoms was increased with the increase of the bottom temperature. However, for preventing thermal decomposition of FAMEs, the temperature of the bottoms was set to 250 °C; finally, the lower location of the feed stage, except for the reboiler, gave the less content of FAMEs in the bottom stream. As a result, 99.97% purified biodiesel could be obtained through the five-stage distillation column, and the degree of unsaturation was similar to that of soybean oil."
10,Cu-based PBR,"3.4 Cu-based PBR Fig. 5 shows the process flow diagram and stream table of the Cu-based PBR. Methanol and soybean oil were also pressurized, preheated, and mixed in the same manner as in the SC-PFR. Then, a heater (E-102) was used to increase the temperature to 320 °C, and the reactant stream flowed into the SSTPH reactor (CRV-100 and CRV-101). In the Cu-based PBR, the reaction condition and conversion rates were obtained from the study by Shin et al. (2013) with a reaction yield of 90%. Table 4 represents the summary of the reactions in the Cu-based PBR, where TG is the triglyceride, ME is the methyl ester, GL is the glycerol and M is the methanol. To match the mass fraction and yield in the literature (Shin et al. (2013)), the conversion rate of the fourth reaction (18:2TG + M → GL + 3 · 18:2ME) was set to 100%; otherwise, some reaction conversion rate would not be between 0 and 1. As the hydrogenation reaction produced light gases such as H2 and CO, a flash drum (V-102) was added after the methanol recovery. In addition, because the loss of methanol in the light gases was reduced as the decrease of temperature, a cooler (E-104) was used to reduce the temperature to 35 °C. The light gases were separated from the excess methanol recycle stream to prevent the presence of the gas phase in the pump. As a result, the methanol recovery efficiency decreased to 96.93%. The other separation steps were identical to those of the SC PFR, and 99.97% purified biodiesel was obtained. Unlike the SC PFR, the degree of unsaturation decreased owing to the partial hydrogenation. As shown in the stream table of Fig. 5, the content of methyl oleate (18:1ME) in the product (FAME stream) was increased compared to that in the SC PFR."
11,Pd-based PBR,"3.5 Pd-based PBR Fig. 6 shows the process flow diagram and stream table of the Pd-based PBR. Methanol and soybean oil were pretreated in the same manner as in the Cu-based PBR. In the Pd-based PBR, the reaction condition and kinetics were simulated based on the experimental data described in the previous section. Table 5 summarizes the reactions in the Pd-based PBR, and the separation steps were the same as those of the Cu-based PBR. The methanol recovery efficiency was 94.88%, which was higher than that of the Cu-based PBR owing to the high partial hydrogenation. After the separation steps, 99.97% purified biodiesel was obtained. Similar to the Cu-based PBR, the content of methyl oleate (18:1ME) in the product (FAME stream) was higher than that of the SC PFR, but much higher than that of the Cu-based PBR. The heat and material balances for three biodiesel processes are summarized in Table 6 , where (+) and (−) denote the inward and outward directions from the viewpoint of the process, respectively. In each case, the errors in heat and material balances were less than 0.01 kg/h and 200 kJ/h over the entire process, respectively."
12,Economic analysis,"Previous studies on economic analysis, based on the Lang or Guthrie methods (Van Kasteren and Nisworo, 2007; You et al., 2008; Lim et al., 2009; Kelloway et al., 2013; Sakdasri et al., 2018), which provide approximate cost factors, have relatively poor accuracies of estimation for new processes, such as the SSTPH processes (Turton et al., 2008). Consequently, the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer V11, which provides investment parameters and economic data for capital and operating cost estimation, was used for a more accurate estimation (Seider et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011). The equipment type and size of each process unit were determined based on the Aspen HYSYS process model. Carbon steel was chosen as the base material of construction (MOC) owing to the absence of a strong acid material, and stainless steel was used for the pumps, heat exchangers, and reactor at high pressure and temperature. The amount of catalyst for the Cu-based PBR and the Pd-based PBR was fixed at 10 wt% of soybean oil considering the residence time of each process. Table 7 present the equipment summary for each process, where L-L means Liquid-Liquid separator and Hor. means the horizontal orientation. For the distillation columns, ""Duty (Con./Reb.)"" denotes the duty of the condenser and reboiler. The investment parameters are summarized in Table 8 . Table 9 lists the prices of the raw materials, products, and catalysts used in this study. The averages of the prices of soybean oil, methanol, and biodiesel product from November 2019 to October 2020 were used."
13,Total capital investment,"4.1 Total capital investment Table 10 shows the total capital cost for each biodiesel production process. The cost of methanol recovery and biodiesel purification in the column included the cost of the distillation column, condenser, distillate accumulator, reflux pump, and reboiler. Because the Pd-based PBR had the highest residence time in the reactor and the highest price of catalyst, the costs of the reactor and catalyst were the highest at $1.54 million and $2.00 million, respectively. The SC PFR had the highest cost for the pumps ($8.57 million) and heat exchangers ($9.84 million) owing to the high reaction pressure. Most of the cost categories in the SC PFR were the highest, excluding the costs of the reactor, catalyst, and flash evaporator. This is because the SSTPH processes had the additional vent systems for light gases compared to the SC PFR. In addition, the lower molar ratio of oil to methanol in SC PFR lowered the reactor size and cost. Comparing the SSTPH processes, most of the cost categories in the Cu-based PBR were higher than that of Pd-based PBR. This is because the reaction temperature and pressure in the Cu-based PBR were higher than those in the Pd-based PBR. Consequently, the total capital investment, which is the adjusted total project cost according to the report of the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer, of the Pd-based PBR was the lowest at $15.8 million and approximately half of that of the SC PFR ($29.4 million)."
14,Total manufacturing cost,"4.2 Total manufacturing cost Fig. 7 shows the total manufacturing cost for each biodiesel production process. Because the methanol was used as the hydrogen donor in the processes of the PBR, the total manufacturing cost in the SC PFR was $37.48 million/y, which was lower than that of the Cu-based PBR ($39.03 million/y) and the Pd-based PBR ($38.97 million/y). The costs of electricity, supervision, and maintenance in the SC PFR were highest at $0.18 million/y, $0.18 million/y, and $0.28 million/y, respectively, owing to the high operating pressure. However, the cost of methanol in the SC PFR was the lowest at $1.20 million/y because methanol was used as the hydrogen donor in the processes of the SSTPH. In addition, the ratio between methanol and soybean oil was the lowest at 42:1 in the SC PFR. Because the Pd-based PBR had the lowest yield and methanol recovery efficiency, the cost of raw materials was highest at $32.97 million/y. As shown in Fig. 7, the cost of soybean oil accounted for the major proportion of the total manufacturing cost; therefore, the total manufacturing cost of SC PFR ($37.48 million/y) was lower than that of the Cu-based PBR ($39.03 million/y) and Pd-based PBR ($38.97 million/y). The revenues from the biodiesel and glycerol for each process were $39.51 million/y, $39.44 million/y, and $39.55 million/y, respectively. Although the high content of methyl oleate in the biodiesel product is known to have good cold flow property and oxidation stability, the price of the biodiesel product (FAMEs) is determined only by the degree of blending, if qualified according to EN14214 and ASTM D6751. Therefore, although the cost of methanol increased due to the partial hydrogenation reaction in the cases of the PBR, the revenues from three biodiesel production processes were similar."
15,Sensitivity analysis,"4.3 Sensitivity analysis Fig. 8 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis. In order to investigate the sensitivity of the net present values (NPVs) for the three biodiesel production processes according to price variation, the prices of soybean oil, methanol, biodiesel product, and glycerol were varied by ±25%, ±50%, and ±75% from the original values shown in Table 9. In addition, the sensitivity analysis was conducted with the production capacity of 1 tonne/h according to the price variation of biodiesel product. Not all the biodiesel production processes could pay off the investment if the prices did not change. With the price decrease of soybean oil or increase of biodiesel product, three biodiesel production process made a profit within 10 years. The slopes of the biodiesel production processes, according to the price change of the biodiesel product, were 1.1496, 1.2006, and 1.2161, respectively. The slopes of the biodiesel production processes, according to the price change of soybean oil, were −1.1255, −1.1998, and −1.2205, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8 and the slopes of the biodiesel production processes according to the price change of the biodiesel product and soybean oil, the NPVs are the most sensitive to the price of the biodiesel product. If the price of high methyl oleate biodiesel increases, the NPVs of the SC PFR would be much lower than those of the others. This is because the SC PFR would have the highest total capital investment. In addition, if the slopes of the PBR cases increase, according to the price change of the biodiesel product, increase, the slope of the Pd-based PBR becomes the highest. Nevertheless, the economic profitability of Pd-based PBR was highest in that the break-even biodiesel prices of three biodiesel production processes were 1121 $/tonne, 1116 $/tonne, and 1099 $/tonne, respectively; that is, although the configuration of three biodiesel production processes was not integrated with advanced technologies to reduce the energy and material consumptions, the payout period would be within 10 years if the biodiesel price were increased by 27.16%, 26.48%, and 24.6%, respectively. The payout period for the 25% decrease of soybean oil price in each case was 9.26, 8.58, and 7.47 years, respectively. In Fig. 9 , NPVs were decreased over three biodiesel production processes and only had a positive value with a 75% increase in the price of biodiesel product. The break-even biodiesel prices of three biodiesel production processes were 1510 $/tonne, 1457 $/tonne, and 1366 $/tonne, respectively. The payout periods for each case with a 75% increase in biodiesel price were 9.3, 8.96, and 7.95 years, respectively. The results showed that the plant capacity of the biodiesel production process has a significant potential for economic profitability. This is because, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the economic profitability of the supercritical biodiesel production process was highly dependent on the cost for the raw material (especially feed oil) and biodiesel product. In other words, the difference between the cost of feed oil and the revenue of biodiesel would be increased along with the increase in plant capacity. In addition, another major key to increase economic profitability in the biodiesel production process is the reaction condition. As mentioned earlier, the total capital investments for three biodiesel production processes were highly dependent on the reaction temperature and pressure. Consequently, the economic analysis showed that Pd-based PBR had two advantages compared to SC PFR and Cu-based PBR: first, the highest content of methyl oleate in biodiesel product was obtained in SSTPH with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst with a high yield (approximately 88.36%). This could contribute to the increase of biodiesel revenue if the biodiesel price is determined by the degree of unsaturation; second, the mild reaction condition in SSTPH with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst reduces the total capital investment, which results in the decrease of payout period and break-even price of biodiesel."
16,Conclusion,"We conducted a kinetic study of the SSTPH process using soybean oil with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, process design and economic analysis were conducted to investigate the profitability of the process in comparison with the supercritical transesterification process, called the SC PFR, and the SSTPH process with a different catalyst, called Cu-based PBR. The process design and simulation models for the three types of biodiesel production processes were developed using Aspen HYSYS V11 and were generally similar, except for the additional vent system for light gases owing to the partial hydrogenation reactions in the Cu-based PBR and Pd-based PBR. The simulation results using Aspen HYSYS V11 for all the cases showed that the 99.97 wt% purity of biodiesel product was obtained. The economic analyses of the three biodiesel production processes were performed using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer V11 based on the process simulation models developed in Aspen HYSYS V11. It was found that the total capital investment for the Pd-based PBR was the lowest and approximately half of that of the SC PFR, despite the high costs of the reactor and catalyst. The total manufacturing cost for the Pd-based PBR was higher than that for the SC PFR and lower than that for the Cu-based PBR, but the revenues from the biodiesel product and glycerol for each process were similar. Not all the biodiesel production processes could pay off the investment. The results from the sensitivity analysis show that the NPVs for the three biodiesel production processes were most sensitive to the price of the biodiesel product. However, although the degree of unsaturation and methanol consumption were different for each biodiesel production process owing to the partial hydrogenation, the price of the biodiesel product was the same. Nevertheless, the SSTPH with Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was most profitable for two reasons: One is that the mild reaction condition under Pd/Al2O3 catalyst reduced total capital investment; another is that the high content of methyl oleate in the biodiesel product was obtained with a high reaction yield (approximately 88.36%). Finally, the SSTPH process could still be further intensified by heat integration, novel reactor or distillation column, and sustainability study (Bravo-García et al., 2021). Such intensification of biodiesel production process and its sustainability assessment could be one of our future studies. Nevertheless, we anticipate that the Pd-based PBR is much more profitable than the others if the price of the biodiesel product is determined by the degree of unsaturation. In addition, without the classification of the biodiesel price, the break-even price of biodiesel in Pd-based PBR was lower (1099 $/tonne) than those of the SC PFR (1121 $/tonne) and Cu-based PBR (1116 $/tonne)."
