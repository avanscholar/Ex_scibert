0,Introduction,"Over developed and consumption of fossil fuel has led to the gradually exhausting of its storage on the earth and caused serious environmental pollution. In response to these circumstances, more and more efforts have been contributed to explore sustainable and clean energy resource (Gu et al., 2016). Biogas is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy by far. However, the presence of CO2 (25–50%) in biogas reduces its combustion efficiency and limits its utilization (Tsapekos et al., 2019). By contrast, purified biogas with methane content higher than 95% can be used as vehicle fuel, injected in the natural gas grid or liquefied like natural gas. Therefore, the separation of CO2 by biogas upgrading technologies will be significantly benefical for creating added value to the biogas. (Kapoor et al., 2019). Lots of approaches have been proposed to fix CO2 from biogas to realize biogas upgrading, such as physical absorption by water and organic solvent scrubbing, chemical absorption (Vo et al., 2018), cryogenic separation (Muñoz et al., 2015), or membrane separation in combine with other physical or chemical technologies (He et al., 2018). Nevertheless, these approaches either request special operational conditions (e.g., high pressure and temperature) or can only be applied with the addition of chemicals (e.g., mono-, di- or tri-ethanolamine) or adversely decrease methane content during the separation of CO2 (Baccioli et al., 2018). Therefore, these approaches have drawbacks or are unsuitable for improving the overall biogas upgrading efficiency, thus an alternative approach is required. Microorganisms have the biological capacity to convert CO2 into other energy containing compounds and this has an enormous potential to address the limitations of the existing biogas upgrading technologies (Angelidaki et al., 2018). It has been reported that phototrophic organisms like algae could capture CO2 from biogas. Meanwhile, the produced biomass can be either used for carotenoids, long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and phycocolloids extraction, or as biogas production feedstock for circular economy (Bahr et al., 2014). However, the operational parameters especially dissolved oxygen concentration should be carefully controlled for biogas upgrading to meet with the specification of safety standards (Bose et al., 2019). Alternatively, biogas upgrading can be accomplished by removing CO2 with external hydrogen as energy source by hydrogenotrophic methanogen to produce methane (Luo et al., 2012). The upgraded biogas can be stored for later use, or further converted to methanol or dimethyl ether, and thus require lower levels of capital investment and energy input, making the operational process much easier to handle. Based on this finding, biological conversion of CO2 in biogas using H2 as the electron donor via the acetyl-CoA pathway to produce valuable liquid products (e.g. ethanol, acetate, and butyrate which are important precursor for high value biofuels) was proposed by researchers from the economic point of view (Angelidaki et al., 2018), and has attracted more and more attention recently. Omar et al. (2018) first reported that using chemical pretreated bacterial inoculum could facilitate methane content of 96% (v/v) and acetate production of 291 mg L−1 at a hydrogen to CO2 ratio of 2 during batch tests. Under the same cultivation conditions, the maximum biogas content of 77% (v/v) and acetate yield of 72% were achieved with thermophilic treated inocula (Omar et al., 2019). However, current simultaneous biogas upgrading and chemical production appoaches, as revealed by the above researches, all occurred under batch tests and focused on the selection of appropriate inoculum with desired functional microorganisms. No information has been reported so far on the continuous process by increasing gas to liquid mass transfer of insoluble hydrogen (0.69 mmol gas L−1 H2O at 30 °C). Additionally, microorganisms (mainly anaerobic acetogen) that could convert CO2 and hydrogen to liquid chemicals are sensitive to fermentative end products.For example, an acetate yield of 2 g L−1 could induce inhibitive effect to the bacteria and further resulting in low substrate conversion and less target products (Sun et al., 2019), nevertheless, no solution has been proposed to tackle this problem yet. The above issues enabled the authors to assume that the development of a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) for efficient hydrogen supply and biomass retention might be capable of enhancing gas to liquid mass transfer efficiency, as well as avoiding negative feedback resulted from end products by decreasing the reaction time between liquid and solid phases. To confirm the assumption, a proof concept experiment was conducted to assess the potential of methane and liquid chemicals production performance by MBfR at first. Continuous tests were then carried out to investigate the role of hydrogen partial pressure and hydraulic retention time (HRT) acted on the performance improving of MBfR. Finally, the economic and environmental potential of the MBfR based simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals generation approach were also discussed to shed light on the application perspective of the proposed technology."
1,Material and methods,
2,MBfR setup,"2.1 MBfR setup A bench scale MBfR with a working volume of 200 mL was established for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production. As shown in Fig. 1 , the reactor tube had one bundle of nonporous hollow fiber membranes with a height of 300 mm for gas diffuse. Each fiber has an inner diameter of 200 μm, and an outer diameter of 280 μm (manufactured by Mitsubishi, Ltd., composite material, Japan), and thus the total 320 fibers in the bundle gave a membrane surface area of 844 cm2. All fibers were connected to a gas cylinder with 99.99% hydrogen (Liming Gas, China) from one end, and the other end of the fibers were sealed with glue. The hydrogen pressure inside of hollow fibers was controlled through a gas-pressure regulator (GENTEC, China). Thus, hydrogen can penetrate into the liquid phase from the hollow fiber membrane without bubble formation. A 250 mL overflow bottle with a liquid volume of 150 mL was connected with the reactor tube by peristaltic pump tubing for biogas supply, liquid recirculation, gas and liquid sampling, and pH monitoring. Synthetic biogas (60% CH4 and 40% CO2, Liming Gas, China) was aerated into the MBfR through the gas diffuser at the bottom of the overflow bottle regulated by a gas flow meter (FLSW, Omega, USA). The bulk liquor in the MBfR system was mixed by recirculating the reactor tube and overflow bottle by a peristaltic pump (BT100-2 J, LONGER, China) at an initial flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. In addition, a water seal bottle was connected to the port of the overflow bottle to prevent air from entering the system, as well as to collect liquid effluent and residue gases."
3,Microorganism and culture conditions,"2.2 Microorganism and culture conditions The homoacetogen Clostridium ragsdalei P11 (ATCC® BAA-622™, USA) with high liquid chemicals production capacity was adopted in this study to evaluate the performance of MBfR. Seed culture medium was composed of 1.0 g L−1 NH4Cl, 0.1 g L−1 KCl, 0.2 g L−1 MgSO4·7H2O, 0.8 g L−1 NaCl, 0.1 g L−1 KH2PO4, 20.0 mg L−1 CaCl2·2H2O, 1.0 g L−1 yeast extract, 2.0 g L−1 NaHCO3, 5.0 g L−1 fructose. In addition, 10 mL L−1 trace elements, 10 mL L−1 Wolfe's vitamin solution, and 10 mL L−1 reducing agent were prepared according to the ATCC® Medium 1754 protocol and added into the medium as well. 100 mL serum bottles containing 50 mL prepared medium was degassed with nitrogen for 30 min and then sealed and sterilized at 121 °C for 20 min. With 2% (v/v) Clostridium ragsdalei P11 seed solution as inoculum, the culture was incubated at 30 °C and 150 rpm for 72 h for further use."
4,MBfR startup and operation,"2.3 MBfR startup and operation The MBfR was flushed with nitrogen gas for 30 min to keep anaerobic conditions and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. Then the reactor was inoculated with 5% (v/v) Clostridium ragsdalei P11 inoculum (mid exponential phase) from serum bottle cultures. The culture medium was prepared as aformentioned, the only change was the replacement of fructose with syngas as carbon source. Initially, the MBfR was operated under batch condition for 72 h to facilitate bacteria growth and biofilm attachment, and evaluate the availability of the MBfR. After that, the MBfR was operated as a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) based on the feeding and decanting (5 min for supplying mineral medium), reacting (started the recirculation pump), and settling (stopped the recirculation pump) steps. Each step was automatically controlled by the digital time controller (GND-1, Bull, China). The effect of hydrogen partial pressure and HRT on hydrogen and CO2 utilization efficiency, biogas upgrading, and liquid chemicals production was carried out sequentially. At each condition, the MBfR was operated over at least 10 cycles until steady-state (based on methane content in biogas and liquid chemicals production rates ranging from 5 to 10%) obtained. During the operational process, the temperature of the MBfR was kept stable at 30 °C, the pH was controlled between 7.0 and 7.5 by manual injection of 1 M HCl or 2 M NaOH solutions every day. Additionally, gas and liquid samples were taken every day for further analysis."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Liquid samples were filtered through disposable sterile Millipore filter units (Merck, Germany) with a pore size of 0.22 μm for the analysis of composition and amount of liquid chemicals via gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 A, Agilent Technologies, USA) (Zhang et al., 2013). The pH level in the reactor was measured using a digital pH meter (Leici, China) connected to the Gel pH electrode inserted into the overflow bottle immediately after the collection of samples to avoid the CO2 removal from the liquid phase (Omar et al., 2018). Gas samples of 1 mLwere taken by gas-tight glass syringe from headspace of the overflow bottle of the MBfR system. CO2 and methane content were detected by a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A, USA) (Luo et al., 2018). The hydrogen composition was determined with a gas chromatograph (4890D, Agilent Cooperation, USA) equipped with a stainless steel packed column (Agilent G3591-81000) and a thermal conductivity detector (Zhao et al., 2017). The gas to liquid mass transfer coefficient (KLa) of hydrogen and CO2 was measured by the method as described by Alfaro et al. (2019), and calculated following the Eq. (1): (1) dC dt = K L a C ∗ - C t where C* (mg L−1) is the aqueous phase gas concentration in equilibrium with the gas phase, C (mg L−1) is the measured dissolved gas concentration, KL (cm h−1) is the specific gas mass transfer coefficient; a (cm−1) is the gas–liquid interfacial area in the hollow fiber membrane bundle; L (cm) is the fiber length, t (h) is the sampling time. The conversion efficiency of the CO2 and hydrogen (%) were then calculated using Eq. (2): (2) % C O 2 o r H 2 c o n v e r s i o n e f f i c i e n c y = m o l e s o f C O 2 o r H 2 c o n s u m e d m o l e s o f C O 2 o r H 2 s u p p l i e d × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Proof concept of simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production by MBfR,"3.1 Proof concept of simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production by MBfR In this study, a MBfR was used for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production. Gas permeable membrane was employed in the MBfR to deliver hydrogen into the liquid phase and provide support for Clostridium ragsdalei P11, which is responsible for CO2 and hydrogen bioconversion, to grow in biofilm. To confirm its feasibility, the MBfR was firstly operated under batch condition by supplying hydrogen and CO2 at a volume ratio of 2:1 according to previous study (Omar et al., 2018), thus giving a H2: CO2: CH4 ratio of 2:1:1.5. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the final biogas composition reached to 79.4% methane and 11.0% CO2 respectively after 72 hours’ fermentation. Decreased CO2 was converted to acetate and ethanol correspondingly, acetate predominated the liquid products under tested condition. Initially, the acetate and ethanol concentrations elevated fast within the 12 h of inoculation (Fig. 2b) due to the rapid consumption of residue fructose in the inoculum. Then the values dropped to the lowest of 2.5 mmol L−1 and 0.2 mmol L−1, indicating the unfavorable environment for Clostridium ragsdalei P11. After 20 h acclimation, the microbial growth recovered, then a thin layer of biofilm gradually grew on and covered the surface of the hollow fiber membranes with increase in the acetate and ethanol concentration to the maximum of 45.6 mmol L−1 and 22.3 mmol L−1, respectively. The overall CO2 consumption during 72 hours’ cultivation was equal to 2.1 L. As a consequence, the acetate and ethanol yield derived from the hydrogen-mediated CO2 conversion represented a maximum value of 0.31 mol/mol CO2 and 0.16 mol/mol CO2, respectively. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first study reporting simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production by means of the novel MBfR."
8,Improving process performance by manipulating the hydrogen partial pressure,"3.2 Improving process performance by manipulating the hydrogen partial pressure The MBfR was operated continuously right after proof concept test to assess whether it is effective in enhancing biogas upgrading through hydrogen transfer coefficient improvement via increasing hydrogen partial pressure. To this end, the methane content in biogas, liquid chemicals production performance, and CO2 and hydrogen utilization efficiency under different hydrogen partial pressures were assessed and compared. As shown in Fig. 3 , with biogas flow rate of 2.0 mL min−1 and HRT of 2.5 d, the methane content in the effluent gas reached to 76.5% with an hydrogen partial pressure of 1.15 atm, which indicated high microbial activity of Clostridium ragsdalei P11 in the MBfR. Then an obvious increase of methane content in the biogas was observed on day 40 when hydrogen partial pressure increased from 1.15 atm to 1.35 atm. Further increase of hydrogen partial pressure to 1.55 atm gave rise to the even higher methane content (93.9%) owing to the increase of hydrogen diffusion from inside of the hollow fiber to the outside liquid phase (KLa value increased from 6.4 h−1 to 10.7 h−1). However, no further increase in hydrogen partial pressure was investigated, as 5.9% hydrogen was detected in the off gas of the MBfR. On account of the CO2 composition in gas phase is proportional to the soluble CO2 in the liquid, there is only 1.8% CO2 left in the MBfR. In terms of liquid chemicals production as observed in Fig. 4 a, the increment of hydrogen pressure positively affected the liquid chemicals generation. By contrast of the three experimental conditions, the maximal acetate and ethanol production rates were observed to be 32.5 mmol L−1 d−1 and 11.9 mmol L−1 d−1 at hydrogen partial pressure of 1.55 atm, which were 33.7% and 2 times higher compared to the lowest values obtained at 1.15 atm. In addition, Fig. 4b shows the highest CO2 and hydrogen conversion efficiency at 1.55 atm were 94.3% and 88.9% respectively, which represents the maximum increase of 54.3% and 15.6%. The above collectively indicated that the availability of hydrogen is favorably affecting biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production, which is consistent with the results reported before (Shen et al., 2017). Although the necessary hydrogen for creating added value from biogas can be potentially produced from renewable sources (Hosseini and Wahid, 2016; Omar et al., 2018), hydrogen itself is a transportation fuel although it owns low volumetric energy content and usually requires high transportation cost. By manipulating the hydrogen partial pressure of MBfR can not only be beneficial in simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production, but also conductive to enhance the hydrogen utilization efficiency, which reveals that more solubilized hydrogen and CO2 could be transformed into the end products by means of this approach."
9,MBfR performance at different HRTs,"3.3 MBfR performance at different HRTs The MBfR was further operated with a constant hydrogen partial pressure of 1.55 atm and biogas flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 to evaluate the impact of HRT on MBfR performance. Clostridium harboring traits of gas fermentation usually requires HRTs ranging from 1 d to 3 d depending on different bacteria and gases substrates (Martin et al., 2016). In the light of growth characteristic of Clostridium ragsdalei P11 (Gao et al., 2013; Kundiyana et al., 2011), the MBfR was operated at an initial HRT of 2.5 d in this part of the study. The correlations between HRTs and methane content together with liquid chemicals production profiles of the MBfR were given in Figs. 5 and 6 . Fig. 5 shows methane composition did not change much and remained the content of 92.1 ± 2.3% within 35 days in the effluent biogas at HRT of 2.5 d. When decreased HRT from 2.5 to 2.0 d, the methane content in biogas increased from 92.1% to 96.7%. Further shortening the HRT from 1.5 to 1.0 d resulted in methane content dramatically decreased to 82.6%, and residue CO2 and hydrogen increased to 8.7% and 7.8%, respectively. At HRT of 2.5 d and 1.0 d, the lowest methane content of 88.6% and 84.2% were obtained. Hence, the maximum methane content of 96.7% was obtained at an HRT of 2 d with an average 2.3% CO2 and 2.1% hydrogen left in the offgas, respectively. Acetate and ethanol were produced under all tested HRTs, acetate still dominated the metabolites (Fig. 6a). As a result of the rapid consumption of gaseous substrates, the acetate and ethanol produced rapidly during the first two days of variation for all HRTs. The maximal acetate and ethanol production rate (32.1 mmol L−1d−1 and 12.4 mmol L−1d−1) at 2.5 d HRT were obtained after 30 days’ cultivation. While the values were significantly increased (p < 0.05) to 37.8 mmol L−1d−1 and 13.5 mmol L−1d−−1 when shortening the HRT to 2.0 d. By contrast, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed between HRT of 2.0 d and 1.5 d. The lowest acetate and ethanol production rate of 23.7 mmol L−1d−1 and 6.5 mmol L−1d−1 were observed at 1.0 d HRT, which were 59.4% and 100% lower than the acetate and ethanol produced at HRT of 2.0 d. The profile of hydrogen and CO2 conversion efficiency in terms of HRT were consistent with the liquid chemicals producing tendency as shown in Fig. 6b. The maximum CO2 and hydrogen conversion efficiency of 93.8% and 98.1% were obtained at HRT of 2.0 d, further decreasing HRT to 1.0 d led to 37.4% CO2 and 17.3% hydrogen left. Above all, HRT plays an important role on MBfR operation as it determines the reaction time between bacteria, substrate, and liquid end products. The inhibition effect caused by acetate and ethanol could be relieved from retention of biomass on the hollow fiber by decreasing the HRT. While further shortening the HRT would result in inefficient bioreaction of solublized CO2 and hydrogen. Moreover, it should be noteworthy that longer HRT led to a lower acetate to ethanol ratio, which was consisted with the phenomenon that reported by Devarapalli et al., 2017, thus suggesting the appropriate manipulation of the HRT would be a potential way for reducing volatile fatty acids to the corresponding alcohols coupled to biogas upgrading."
10,Technology potentials for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production,"3.4 Technology potentials for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production In this study, the widely used bubbling aeration method was replaced with the membraneaeratedbiofilmbioreactor, in which efficient hydrogen supply and retention of bacteria could be achieved via the application of gas-permeable membranes. By employing this novel approach, 96.7% methane content and an acetate and ethanol production rate of 2.3 g L−1d−1 and 0.6 g L−1d−1 were achieved. This rate is the higest rate reported for hydrogen-mediated biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production processes. For example, the acetate production rate obtained in this study was an order of magnitude higher than that in serum bottles flushed with hydrogen and biogas, where chemical or trermal treated anaerobic digested sewage sludge was responsible for biogas upgrading (Table 1 ). Additionally, it is also comparable to the succinic production rate (13.4 g L−1d−)achieved in bubbling continuous stirred tank reactor which used glucose as supplemental carbon source (Gunnarsson et al., 2014). It should be noted that this is a preliminary study to confirm the feasibility of simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production by hydrogen assisted MBfR. Therefore, the operational of MBfR was not optimized in this research. Technology optimization such as biogas flow rate, packing density of hollow fibers together with different pH levels are definitely needs to be carried out to improve biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production effieciency in the future. In addition, the produced acetate is an important precursor for higher valuable biofuel (ethanol and butanol) and chemicals (butyrate and caproate, etc.) production (Agler et al., 2012; Angenent et al., 2016). Consequently, futher study in terms of chain elongation with acetate as the reduced feedstock for value added compounds recovery from biogas is needed. Also, the sensitivity of the MBfR performance to the presence of H2S, CO, and NH3 in biogas on biogas upgrading process should also be assessed in the future. Fig. 7 shows a basic concept based on the proposed biogas upgrading approach to enhance methane purification and liquid chemicals production from biogas. With an annual generation growth rate of 13.7% since 1990, biogas is a renewable but low-carbon source of methane produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic waste (Verbeeck et al., 2018). However, further expansion of anaerobic digestion is restricted by the lack of suitable valorization strategies. In general, the biogas is usually applied for heat or power generation at a relatively low overall energetic efficiency. Alternatively, the upgrading of biogas through MBfR proposed in this study can be considered as a promising initial step towards sustainable perspective. The purified biogas can be injected into the natural gas grid, applied in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, or converted to high energetic efficiency power and heat in the combined heat and power (CHP) unit. The residue CO2 in biogas is converted to acetate and ethanol by microbial cell factory to facilitate biofuel and biochemical industry. Taken China as an example, the annual biogas production was 15.5 billion m3 in 2014 (Fan et al., 2017), using the present MBfR approach could theoretically prevent 5.8 billion m3 CO2 from emission into the atmosphere per year (Zhou et al., 2020). Moreover, the amount of methane purified from the biogas was about 8.9 billion m3, the value of which (870 USD per cubic meter) is far higher than that of biogas (0.14 USD per cubic meter) (Zhou et al., 2020). Meanwhile, value-added acetate (385 USD per ton) and ethanol (500 USD per ton) (Reddy et al., 2018) could be produced from surplus hydrogen originated from renewable biomass by MBfR with lower input and negligible chemical/energy consumption. With easier to handle process and less methane loss, the MBfR approach exibits both environmental and economical benefits for further use. Such an approach enables a more widespread use of biogas and therefore benefits its upgrading by reaching out to new markets such as the biofuel and bio-chemical industry. The implementation of this concept from lab scale to a larger scale may facilitate its practical application and contributing to a worldwide bio-based economy as well."
11,Conclusions,"In this study, a MBfR was developed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production continuously. Increasing hydrogen partial pressure to 1.55 atm and shortening HRT to 2 d significantly improved the methane content to 96.7%, and acetate and ethanol production rate to 37.8 mmol L−1d−1 and 13.5 mmol L−1d−1, respectively, which were the highest values reported to date. Combined with environmental and economic analysis, the MBfR based simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production approach could potentially reduce the dependence on fossil fuel and carbon footprint by biosynthesis of value-added biofuels and biochemicals towards bio-economy perspective."
