0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production via the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction of water splitting processes through electrochemical pathways is considered as one of the most significant and promising technique in modern day [1–9]. The continuous consumption of fossil fuels in modern days motivates scientist community to develop and design alternate source of energy. The hydrogen is considered to be the alternate source of energy as it is renewable in nature and does not emit any toxic end products [10,11]. In present days there are various techniques available for fossil fuel resources conversion such as the steam reforming and the partial oxidation for hydrogen production, but major drawback is both the techniques cause’s harmful effects and pollution on environment [12,13]. However, to overcome these drawbacks, water splitting via electrochemical method has gained popularity, as it is more efficient and the end product show no toxic effects in environment [14,15]. The major drawback of the electrochemical water splitting is particularly the material utilized is made up of less abundant in nature and expensive noble metals [16,17]. The noble metal based platinum electrocatalyst needs to be replaced with cost effective and highly efficient electrocatalyst material [18,19]. The other transition metal based electrocatalyst designed and developed such as carbides [24], nitride [25], sulphides [22], selenides [23], phosphides [21] and oxides [20]. They can be utilized to catalyse water electrolysis reaction for hydrogen production. It can be utilized as better hydrogen evolution reactions during water electrolysis processes as compared to other carbon based electrocatalyst. Albeit, these compound shows low electrical conductivity and behaves as semiconductor materials that results in less active sites. Several hetero atoms attached to carbon matrix could enhance and tune the electrocatalytic activity and electronic structure. These free metal electrocatalyst materials tends to show better HER activity i.e. may be due to the absence of the electrocatalytic active sites [26,27]. These days carbon doped transition metal electrocatalyst has gained tremendous attraction due to better performance of electro catalytically activity for hydrogen production [28,29]. In aqueous basic solutions due to its immense stability, the availability in nature and its cost effectiveness, from past few years the mixed valance transition metal-based sulphides like manganese sulphides [30], cobalt sulphides [31], and nickel sulphides [32] have been attracted as the most suitable candidate for electrochemical water splitting. The mixed valance transition metal-based sulphides show better redox chemistry and they also tend to show higher electrical conductivity than metal oxides [33]. When doped a transition metal into sulphides-based materials play an important role in increasing the active sites or optimized the 3d electronic configuration. Due to these the transition based ternary metal sulphides gives a better electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction [34]. The ternary metal sulphides have effects such as synergistic effects of the two metal bonded atoms and they have also redox reaction rich sites. The spinel structure materials have been considered and evaluated for many potential applications [35,36]. The normal spinel structure such as NiCo2S4 has many octahedral active sites, which show tremendously amazing electro catalytically activity [37]. The main feature to enhance their electrocatalytically activity and durability is considered to be the morphology and crystal structure of the compounds [38]. Various compounds of NiCo2S4 with distinguished morphologies such as nanowires [39], nanotubes [40], nanosheets [41], hollow spheres and many more were investigated to increase the electrocatalytic activity of the compounds [42]. Recently researchers have demonstrated that the transition metal sulphide show greater performance as compared to their corresponding oxides owing to higher electrical conductivity [43,44]. The applications of CuCo2S4, CoNi2S4 and NiCo2S4 ternary metal sulphides have been reported as active electrode materials for energy storage, however only few reports are available for HER and OER [45–47]. So far, our knowledge only few transition metal sulphide-based nanomaterials have been reported as electro/photocatalyst for HER [48–50]. Wang et al. [51] developed 3D pomegranate-like Fe-doped NiCo nanoassemblies (3D PG-NiCoFe NAs) through facile one-step bi-component cyanogel reduction with NaBH4 as the reducing agent. They concluded that its unique structure and enriched oxygen vacancies originated from well-modulated electronic structures, the 3D PG-NiCoFe-211 NAs shows outstanding OER performance in alkaline solution. Chen et al. [52] fabricated a trimetallic PtNiCo hollow alloyed multipods (HAMPs) via one pot solovo-thermal approach along with acid etching. Oleic acid, Oleyl amine and formaldehyde act as the structural directing agents and co-reducing agents respectively to attain a rough surface. HAMPs act as an electrocatalyst that gives excellent HER activity in alkaline medium with long-term durability. On the other hand Zhang et al. [53] synthesized a phosphorous – doped Co2MnO4 via hydrothermal method followed by oxidation and P-doping. They fabricated a unique nanoneedle type structure/array which attain tremendous HER activity along with the low overpotential in Alkaline, acidic and neutral medium. The hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysers from water is beneficial as it forms hydrogen without emission of CO2. The electrode material and membrane are very important for better performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolysers system. The structure of electrode materials and membrane are most important factors for efficiency of electrochemical reactions i.e., HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [54–58]. The electrocatalysts were synthesized by using ternary solution solvent for a template free method synthesis. This one pot synthesis method is considered as green method via single method using reflux condensation route. The method involved in synthesis of transition metal based ternary microsphere as electrocatalyst is a single step sequence ion exchange method which is highly efficient and environmentally friendly [59]. Thus, the main goal of this work is to design and developed highly efficient economically favourable transition metal-based ternary electrocatalyst to generate hydrogen and oxygen as fuel during electrolysis of water. In this direction, this paper demonstrates cost effective one-pot synthesis of transition metal based ternary CuCo2S4, CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4, and CuZn2S4 microsphere as electrocatalyst for water splitting application. The synthesized electrocatalyst were characterized with the help various analytical instruments. The result of electrochemical measurement suggests that CuCo2S4, show higher electrocatalytic activity in compare to CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4, and CuZn2S4 microsphere. Thus, this study might be helpful for the researcher to choosing the suitable efficient transition metal-based ternary electrocatalyst for HER and OER."

2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The essential chemical reagents N,N-dimethylformamide ((CH3)2NCHO), ethylene glycol(C2H6O2), Thiourea (CH₄N₂S), Copper sulphate (CuSO4.5H2O), Nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(OAc)2.4H2O), Manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(OAc)2.4H2O), Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc)2.4H2O) and Zinc acetate tetrahydrate (Zn(OAc)2.2H2O) were purchased from Merck, India private limited and kemphasol India respectively. All these chemicals are analytical grade and used without any further purification."
3,Preparation of ternary CoCu2S4 microspheres (MPs),"2.2 Preparation of ternary CoCu2S4 microspheres (MPs) The preparation of ternary CoCu2S4 MPs is a single step procedure. The synthesis processes were adopted from previous reported paper with slight modification [59]. In typical experiment, 16 ml of ethylene glycol(C2H6O2), and 64 ml N,N-dimethylformamide(C₃H₇NO), was kept under vigorous stirring with 4 mM of CuSO4.5H2O. The temperature was maintained at 145 °C under nitrogen atmospheric condition. 10 ml solvent containing 20 mM thiourea (CH₄N₂S), was added in above mixture vigorously by drop-wise with the help of a syringe. The above mixture was kept in order to keep reflux for 5 h. Then another 10 ml solvent containing 2 mM Co (OAc)2.4H2O was added drop-wise into the above mixture. Afterwards the temperature conditions were maintained at 170 °C for 5 h, then the reaction was quenched after black precipitate appeared. The black precipitate was collected at normal room temperature conditions by centrifugation. The precipitate was washed with de-ionized water and with ethanol 3–4 times repeatedly and further the precipitate was dried over 60 °C for the period of 12 h under vacuum condition. The detailed experimental pathways are represented in Fig. 1 . In similar fashion CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4 and CuZn2S4 microsphere electrocatalysts were synthesized by using their acetates salts like manganese, nickel and zinc acetate respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates the formation of ternary CuX2S4 (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) microspheres. Firstly, Cu-X (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) precursor directly grew after refluxing for 5 h. Then, the precursor transformed into the CuX2S4 (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) microspheres on the basis of an anion exchange reaction (O2− to S2−). The formation of CuX2S4 (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) ternary microspheres from Cu-X (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) precursors could be demonstrated by the dissolution and nucleation process. During this process, divalent sulphur ions (S2−) ions released from the decomposition of thiourea initially reacted with Cu-X (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) precursors on the surface to form CuX2S4 (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) ternary microspheres, then these particles aggregated along the microsphere’s direction. As the reaction went on, the amount of aggregated CuX2S4(X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) microparticles increased while the amount of precursor microspheres decreased and finally disappeared. As a result, the solid precursor microspheres turned into porous CuX2S4(X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) ternary microspheres. The anion exchange is an isotropic process, so the overall morphologies of the resultant CuX2S4 (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) microparticles is analogous to the precursor. Besides, the CuX2S4 (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) ternary microspheres were transformed from the Cu-X (X = Mn, Ni, Zn & Co) precursor through a direct calcination process."
4,Material characterizations,"2.3 Material characterizations The crystal compositions, shape and structure of the prepared samples were identified using powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD) from panalytical products at the 2θ range angle from 10° to 90°. Raman spectroscopic investigation of the samples was carried out using a Renishaw 2000 spectrometer in the back-scattering geometry, using He-Ne laser. The laser power was typically 1 mW and the laser spot size was ∼ 1 μm. The internal surface morphologies of the prepared samples were characterized by TEM and SEM respectively. Further, the elemental mapping of the samples was analysed by an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attached to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive spectroscopy used to perform elemental analysis available at Sophisticated Analytical Instrumentation Facility (SAIF) Department of Anatomy (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) New Delhi -110029, India."
5,Electrochemical characterization,"2.4 Electrochemical characterization The electrochemical characterization was done by using simple spraying technique as it is very simple and easy to manage the electrocatalyst deposition. The preparation of electrocatalyst ink starts with taking electrocatalyst powder, mixing it with the iso-propyl alcohol and water solvent mixture with the Nafion® solution (Aldrich, USA) this solution kept under sonication bath for time period of 20 min. The prepared electrocatalyst ink then casted on the Nafion-115 membrane by simply utilizing the spray gun, the amount of electrocatalyst utilized for loading was approximately 2 mg cm−2 and this has been considered as working electrode. The Nafion-115 membrane was pre-treated by the methodology mentioned by Srinivasan et al. in his previous work before the loading of the electrocatalyst on the Nafion-115 membrane [50]. On the other side of the membrane, 20 % Pt on Vulcan XC-72 (Sigma-Aldrich) was loaded using similar method as followed in the case of nanomaterials; 0.5 mg. cm−2 cathode electrocatalyst was loaded. After loading of electrocatalysts, the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) was hot pressed at 100 °C and 15 kg cm−2 for 5 min, followed by further treatment with boiling dilute HCl and DI water. Porous titanium sinters were then pressed against these electrocatalyst layers to provide the whole system the electrical contact. The electrochemical tests were carried out in a conventional three electrode electrochemical cell system by using BioLogic (SP 150) Potentiostat. The linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, polarization analysis were performed with all the nano-electrocatalysts. In all the experiments, the nano-electrocatalysts loaded MEA was used as working electrode. Pt plate of 1 cm2 sized was used as counter electrode and reference electrode was Ag/AgCl saturated in 3.5 M KCl solution. The PEM water electrolyzer set up for electrochemical characterization is shown in Fig. 2 [50,60,61]."
6,Results and discussions,"XRD was used to determine the composition and crystal structure of the synthesized transition metal based ternary microspheres. Fig. 3 represent the XRD spectra of ternary CuCO2S4, CuMn2S4, CuZn2S4 and CuNi2S4 microspheres respectively. XRD graph of ternary CuCo2S4 NPs is depicted in the Fig. 3a. The peaks at 2 θ values of 31.3°, 39.2°, 47.3°, 50, and 54.9° were formed due to formation of cubic thiospinal phase (JCPDS card no. 00-002-0787) and was found that the diffraction patterns are consistent with CuCo2S4 available in the literature [62,63]. In case of CuZn2S4 microsphere (Fig. 3b), the peaks at 2θ values of 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.4°, 56.3°, and 69.4° match perfectly with the A(111), A(200), A(220), A(311) and A(400) crystalline planes of the face centred cubic structure of ZnS (JCPDS card no.00-065-1691). Few other diffraction peaks appeared at 29.63 and 61.57 corresponding to B(110) and B(220) planes of cuprite, respectively, indicate the formation of cubic copper (I) oxide nanocrystals [60]. XRD peaks observed for cuprite was matched well with the standard powder diffraction card of bcc (body centred cubic) cuprite (JCPDS No. 05-667) [63]. Fig. 3c shows the XRD pattern of CuMn2S4 microsphere. The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.4° and 56.3° could be indexed to the A(111), A(110), A(200), and A(A220) cubic phase α-MnS (JCPDS No: 72-1534). The rest of the assigned peak at 2 θ value of 29.63 and 61.57 corresponding to B(110) and B(220) planes of cuprite, respectively, indicate the formation of cubic copper (I) oxide nanocrystals [64]. In case of XRD spectra of CuNi2S4 diffraction peaks can be ascribed to the simple cubic phase of CuNi2S4 (JCPDS No. 24-334) that are shown in Fig. 3d. The typical diffraction peaks of (311), (400), (511), and (440) diffraction planes can be clearly indexed at 31.4, 38.2, 50.1, and 55.1, respectively that clearly show CuS and NiS structure. It also represents the catalyst have high crystallinity and intense peaks indicates the crystal strength of the material. Raman spectroscopy has been used to probe the rotational mode, vibrational mode and other low frequency mode of the synthesized materials. The photons are incident on the electrocatalyst materials. They interact with the materials, which may cause energy exchange event between them. The energy exchange difference between the incident photon and scattered photon is measured, that provides the necessary fingerprints of the synthesized transition metal based ternary microsphere electrocatalysts [65]. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of ternary CuCO2S4, CuMn2S4, CuZn2S4 and CuNi2S4 microspheres respectively. There is one major sharp peak present at 472 cm−1 that indicates, the presences SS bond [66]. The ternary CuNi2S4, and CuCo2S4 microsphere also exhibit two other peaks which indicates synthesis of some phase transform material which is also present in ternary CuMn2S4 and CuZn2S4 microsphere however the intensity of the peaks is very low. The inner and outer morphological studies of the synthesized transition metal based ternary microsphere were analysed by TEM and SEM. The different TEM images were taken from the surface at different resolutions. The TEM images of ternary CuCO2S4, CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4 and CuZn2S4 microspheres are shown in Fig. 5 . The ternary CuCo2S4 microsphere shows (Fig. 5a) distinguished microsphere shaped structure having mesoporous type cavity that indicates that why transition metal based ternary microsphere electrocatalyst shows better electrochemical activity. The ternary CuMn2S4 microsphere (Fig. 5b) shows that the sphere-shaped materials with no other impurity are present at the copper grid surface. The ternary CuNi2S4 microsphere (Fig. 5c) also again confirms that there have been some mesoporous type cavity present on the surface and in case of ternary CuZn2S4 microsphere (Fig. 5d) also have similar sphere-shaped structure. Thus, from TEM images it can be concluded that the micro size spheres having mesoporous nature with larger surface area was formed [67]. The analysis of SEM images of synthesized ternary microsphere as electrocatalyst were done to better understand the morphological structure on the surface at 5 μm resolution. Fig. 6 revelled the SEM images of ternary CuCo2S4, CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4 and CuZn2S4 microspheres. The SEM image indicates presence of the micro sphere-shaped clumps of the synthesized transition metal based ternary microsphere electrocatalysts. The SEM images of ternary CuCo2S4 (Fig. 6a), CuMn2S4 (Fig. 6b) CuNi2S4 (Fig. 6c) and CuZn2S4 (Fig. 6d) microsphere indicates the presence of the spherical and rounded structure as well. From the TEM and SEM it is quite clear that some hierarchy contribution from several rough surfaces sheet-like structures coming together to form spheres. There are various nanopores on the outer surface of the microsphere. There is also possibility that these microspheres could be hollow too. But clear evidence is lacking from the SEM and TEM images as well. We plan to perform more rigorous structural analysis of the morphologies of these spheres later. Fig. 7 represent the particle size histogram of the synthesized ternary transition metal-based microspheres. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) values of synthesized electrocatalysts can be obtained by calculating the charges accumulated during the H desorption. ECSA = 100.Q/m.c Where, Q is the charge for H desorption, c is the electrical charges associated with monolayer adsorption of H (0.21 mC cm−2) and m is the weight of the corresponding electrocatalyst loaded. The calculated ECSA values have been revealed as 92.7, 89.4, 87.5 and 71.5 m2. g-1 for the electrocatalysts CuCo2S4, CuNi2S4, CuMn2S4 and CuZn2S4, respectively. The charge of the double layer was determined from the integration of the adsorption-desorption peak from CV curves, and further divided the value with the scan rate of 50 mV sec-1. The resultant value has been divided with the weight of each sample loaded during the experiment. The formation of more active sites in the CoCu2S4 and NiCu2S4 during their synthesis make them better electrocatalysts. The elemental mapping of the samples was measured by EDAX as shown in Figs. 8–11 . Fig. 8 represent the elemental mapping of ternary CuCo2S4 microsphere which confirms the presence of Cu, Co and S element. Similarly, Figs. 9–11 represent the EDAX spectra of ternary CuNi2S4, CuZn2S4 and CuMn2S4 microsphere. Fig. 9 confirmed the presence of Ni, Cu and S element. On the other hand, from Fig. 10 it can be confirmed the presence of Zn, Cu and S element however Fig. 11 confirmed the presence of Mn, Cu and S element respectively. The different peak indicates the presence of different elements, the intensity of different peaks is also different. The elemental analysis indicates the sulphur peaks of the highest intensity. Other peaks in the EDX spectrum (Figs. 8–11) correspond to either carbon from the substrate utilized during the EDX experiment for the sample characterization or from the oxygen present in the atmosphere."
7,Electrochemical performance in PEM water electrolyser,"3.1 Electrochemical performance in PEM water electrolyser 3.1.1 Cyclic voltammetry study The electrochemical measurements were done by Potentiostat/Galvanostat (BioLogic SP150). The electrochemical analysis was done by using Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry and Tafel slope studies, using 0.1 M H2SO4 in PEM water electrolyser. The non-noble based electrocatalyst seems to perform better in acidic medium. The cyclic voltammetry was analysed with scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in a narrow potential range of 0.5 v to 0.7 V. The four different transition metal based ternary microsphere electrocatalysts were synthesized and their comparative electrochemical activities were evaluated to better understand their electrocatalytic performance. Fig. 12 represents the cyclic voltammetry curve of transition metal based ternary CuCo2S4, CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4 and CuZn2S4 microspheres. Fig. 12 describe that the hydrogen evolution reaction during the electrolysis of water is highly effected by the electrocatalyst compositions. The bimetallic electrocatalyst is synthesized without any template. Hence the electrocatalyst activity is mainly dependent upon the different combination of transition metals presence in electrocatalyst materials. Fig. 12 represents the cyclic voltammetry analysis results for all the ternary microsphere structured electrocatalysts. The cyclic voltammograms are showing clear hydrogen desorption-adsorption peak in all the electrocatalyst sample. The typical cyclic voltammograms of CuCo2S4 and CuNi2S4 are much wider than those of other samples. The anodic and cathodic peak current density with over potential value of similar materials with non-spherical structure have been represented in Table 1 . It is clearly seen from comparative results of electrocatalytic performances that, the microspheres synthesized in the present work performed significantly better than the materials reported earlier [34,68–71]. Primarily the spherical shape and tuneable structure with higher surface area value and porous nature has increased their electrocatalytic activity in great extent. Additionally, the synergistic effect between the two metals used in individual electrocatalysts enhances the number of active sites, which results into the greater ECSA value. Their spherical shape has also enhanced the overall electrocatalytic activity during electrochemical experiments in acidic media. 3.1.2 Linear sweep voltammetry study The electrocatalytic activity of all the ternary hierarchical metal sulphide microspheres were investigated by linear sweep voltammetry in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with the potential scan rate of 5.0 mV.s−1. Fig. 13 shows one distinct wave in all the electrocatalysts. Onset potentials of OER and over potentials at a current density of 10 mA.cm-2 were numerically illustrated in Fig. 14 . This has clearly been seen from the figure that, CuCo2S4 has shown the lower onset and over-potential value of 1.45 V and 290 mV, respectively in OER among all other electrocatalysts. In this case, OER involved 4 proton-coupled electron transfer process and further there has been formation of OO bond taken place. This is the major rate limiting reaction in the overall water splitting reaction. In similar way, HER electrocatalytic performance of all the hierarchical ternary metal sulphides micro-spheres have been investigated in acid solution with 5.0 mV.s−1 scan rate. The onset potential has initially been investigated for all the electrocatalysts. In this case also, CuCo2S4 sample has been revealed as the most promising electrocatalyst due to its least onset and overpotential value at 10 mA.cm-2 of 61 mV and 79 mV, respectively. The comparative liner sweep voltammetry study for HER of ternary metal sulphide microspheres CuCo2S4, CuNi2S4, CuMn2S4 and CuZn2S4 are represented in Fig. 15 . Fig. 16 shows the numerical illustration onset and overpotential value (at 10 mA.cm-2) for all the electrocatalysts. According to the overall electrocatalytic performance of all the samples, CuCo2S4 micro-spheres have been revealed as the best electrocatalysts among all the others, which has been affirmed by their lowest onset and over-potential value both during HER and OER method. However, CuNi2S4 and CuMn2S4 have also performed well in LSV studies. During HER study, the Faradaic efficiency was determined through the comparison of the experimental and theoretical hydrogen yield for 1 h duration by using CuCo2S4 micro-spheres. In this duration, total 385 μmol of H2 has been produced, therefore the Faradaic efficiency has been calculated as 84.4 %. Similarly, 186 μmol of O2 has been evolved at the same Faradaic efficiency. 3.1.3 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy The A.C. impedance characterization of the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium acidic solution is presented in the Fig. 17 . In this case, a single step charge transfer reaction system is considered, where the electrode exhibits single and depressed semicircles at all studied potentials in the explored frequency range. Fig. 17 shows the Nyquist plots that indicates the dramatically reduced charge transfer resistance values of the synthesized electrocatalyst materials, CuZn2S4, CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4 and CuCo2S4. Among all the synthesized ternary microsphere CuCo2S4, microsphere indicates the better electron transfer procedure and the easy kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction. 3.1.4 Tafel plots Fig. 18 shows the Tafel plot of transition metal based ternary microsphere and Tafel value were calculated to better understand the kinetics of HER and OER respectively. The values of the Tafel slope can be easily determined from the Tafel equation. (1) E = a + blnI + IR By differentiating the Eq. (a), w.r.t. I, the Eq. (1) has been derived. (2) dE/dI = b/I + R The plotted graph of lnI vs. E will produce the straight-line having slope b and intercept R. In the present study, the average values of Tafel slope have been calculated as CuZn2S4:41 mV. dec−1, CuMn2S4:102 mV. dec−1, CuNi2S4:115 mV.dec−1, and CuCo2S4:121 mV.dec−1. In acidic media, water molecules are considered as the major reacting particles during oxygen evolution reaction. The following reaction is taken place at the first step: (3) H2O → OHad + H+ + e− The reaction order with chemical significance can be determined by the equation written below: (4) E+H+ = ƞγ H+ - Ɣ Here, ƞ is the reaction order at constant overpotential of γ and potential of E. Ɣ represents the transfer coefficient value during the electrochemical reaction. (5) Ɣ = (RT/F) (dln E/dln i) The reaction step written in Eq. (3) is followed by two chemical steps, which present in Eqs. (6) and (7): (6) H2O → OH*ad + H+ + e− (7) OH*ad → OHad The Eq. (4) can’t be considered as the rate determining step (r.d.s.) as in that case the reaction order would be zero with respect to the H+ concentration. The HER in an acidic media will proceed with the following steps: (i) Volmer reaction: In this step, a hydrogen atom is adsorbed by the combination of a proton and an electron on the electrode surface. (8) * + H+ + e− → *Had (ii) Heyrovsky reaction: In this step, the adsorbed hydrogen atom interacts with a proton and an electron resulting into an electrochemical desorption. (9) *Had + H+ + e− → H2 + * (iii) Tafel reaction: In the final step, two adsorbed hydrogen atoms leads to a dissociative desorption of hydrogen. (10) 2*Had → H2 + * In HER mechanism, the hydrogen adsorption initiates with Volmer reaction (8), which further proceeds via hydrogen desorption step of Heyrovsky reaction (9) or through the dissociative desorption pathway of Tafel reaction (10). In the present case, the Tafel slope value of 32 mV. dec−1supports the mechanism of Volmer-Tafel, whereas Tafel slope values of ternary CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4 and CuCo2S4 may arise from various reaction pathways depending on the surface coverage of adsorbed hydrogen. All transition metal based ternary microsphere electrocatalysts electrochemical activity were different the copper and sulphur part among the electrocatalyst remain the same. Hence, their electrochemical activity must be varied by the other transition metal used. The different transition metal utilized in combination with copper transition metal shows different electrochemical activity. Amongst them cobalt based ternary microsphere electrocatalysts shows best results and zinc based ternary microsphere electrocatalysts shows less efficiency. This may be due to the electronic structure of zinc transition metal [71]. 3.1.5 Determination of TOF (turn over frequency) and TON (turn over number) for water slitting reaction Electrocatalysts are specific form of catalysts, which can function ay electrode surface. Many-a-times, electrode surface itself can act as electrocatalyst. The role of an electrocatalyst is to assist in transferring electrons between the electrode catalytic active sites and reactants and/or facilitates an intermediate chemical transformation. One significant difference between the catalytic chemical reaction and electrochemical reaction is that the electrode potential of the electrocatalyst can also assist in the reaction. The performance of an electrocatalyst, which is directly attached with the electrode surface, can be enhanced, or reduced in significant amount by changing their potential value. Turnover frequency (TOF) and turnover number (TON) both are very important quantitative parameters for any catalytic reactions. TON can be defined as the ratio of the number of reactants to number of catalyst particles. Therefore, it provides a semi-quantitative information on the reaction. But TOF is a quantitative measure provides the number of reactants reacted per number of particles in unit time. In the present study, TOF has been calculated by using OER current at overvoltage and the TOF= i× NA / A × F × n × ᴦ Where, i = current, NA = Avogadro number, A = Geometrical surface area of the electrode, F = Faraday constant, n = Number of electrons, ᴦ = Surface concentration In this case, OER current of 10 mA/cm2 observed at 1.52 V (vs. RHE) and calculated the TOF as 5.25 s−1 for CuCo2S4 electrocatalyst. It is known that, TOF = TON/ unit time; therefore, the TON has been determined as 315 for CuCo2S4 micro-spherical electrocatalyst. 3.1.6 Electrochemical stability test All the micro-spheres were examined for 72 h of duration to evaluate their electrocatalytic stability at potentiometric condition. The anodic peak current density has been taken into account every after 1 h from cyclic voltammetry studies. The anodic peak current density values have been plotted against time in Fig. 19 . The potential scan rate was maintained at 50 mV. sec−1. The lower scan rate obviously has reduced the noise created during the experiments which lead to reduction of experimental error. The experiments have proved all the materials as stable electrocatalysts in water electrolysis process under acidic media. The stability of all the electrocatalyst samples was also evaluated by performing LSV after running the cell with 3000th cycle, which has been presented in Fig. 20 . The overpotential calculated at a current density of 10 mA.cm−2 has not been changes significantly after 3000 cycles, indicating better OER stability of the sample."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, we developed the cost-effective synthesis of low-cost transition metal based ternary microsphere via a simple facile approach. The morphology of transition metal based ternary metal sulphide microspheres with unique structural features is a promising electrocatalyst to generate hydrogen from water. The composition and crystal structure of synthesized transition metal based ternary metal sulphide microspheres were identified by using PXRD and Raman spectroscopy. The result of morphological characterization from SEM and TEM suggested that synthesized microsphere exhibit mostly spherical and hierarchical shape having porous surface. The presence of possible element in respective ternary microsphere was confirmed from EDAX measurement. The XRD data suggested the presence of mostly cubic phase on all transition metal based ternary microsphere. The result of electrochemical measurement in 0.5 M H2SO4 acidic medium, for ternary CuCo2S4 has shown lowest onset and overpotential value calculated at 10 mA.cm−2, which concluded into the remarkable performance in HER and OER. Based on the electrochemical measurement of the synthesized transition metal based ternary microspheres it was observed that CuCo2S4 microsphere show greater electrocatalytic activity than other synthesized microspheres. The improved electro-catalytic performance of ternary CuCo2S4 microsphere may be attributed due lower overpotential. Tafel slope value of 32 mV supports the mechanism of Volmer-Tafel, whereas higher Tafel slope values of ternary CuMn2S4, CuNi2S4 and CuCo2S4 may arise from various reaction pathways depending on the surface coverage of adsorbed hydrogen. The electrocatalytic stability has also been observed for the electrocatalysts by taking LSV after 3000 cycles. This study might give an insight depth understanding of important parameters to the researcher while selecting transition metal based novel catalyst for water splitting application."
