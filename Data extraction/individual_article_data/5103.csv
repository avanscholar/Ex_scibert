0,Introduction,"Nowadays, perfumes are inseparable parts of human life and personal care compositions like laundry powders (LP) (Pichersky and Gershenzon, 2002; Butler, 2013). The unpleasant smell of the components and the need for a pleasant scent for clothes are the two frequent causes of adding perfumes to LPs. Spraying on the surface of solid particles of LPs while running on a conveyor belt is the most dominant technique for adding perfumes to LP formulations includes (Behan et al., 1998) however, this method suffers from several shortcomings including evaporative wastage due to the high vapor pressure and physicochemical instabilities due to the isomerization, oxidation, polymerization, dehydrogenation, and thermal rearrangement reactions (Turek and Stintzing, 2013). It worth noting that perfumes are generally considered as one of the most expensive components used in personal care compositions and cannot be wasted simply during LP manufacturing or storage. The second problem after spraying the perfume on the solid particles is sticking particles together and accumulation on the conveyer belt and funnels throughout the production line. Spraying on the surface of LPs does not provide an appropriate bond between perfumes and LPs. The main problem arises again during the storage period due to the volatile nature of perfumes preventing the production of a competitively stable product. Some solutions are proposed to overcome the said problems including encapsulation of liquid perfumes which is an expensive and less effective choice due to the low yield of encapsulation (Jacquemond et al., 2009; Peña et al., 2012; Elia et al., 2015). The authors believe adsorption of perfumes on the zeolites may be an efficient method due to the high potential of adsorption onto zeolites. The perfume adsorbed on the surface of the zeolite benefits from a lower vapor pressure than the bulk perfume oil which means less volatility and waste of perfumes in the operating procedures due to reduced vapor pressure. On a microscopic scale, physicochemical compatibility between perfume components and zeolite structure is determinant to provide excellent and stable adsorption. Unmodified zeolites have enough adsorption sites on surfaces of their pores and galleries but they are different with perfumes in the term of chemical compatibility. Unmodified zeolites are highly hydrophilic (He et al., 2020), and perfumes are generally considered very hydrophobic, so modification of zeolite surface using polymers or chemicals with more hydrophobicity is highly recommended by (Armaǧan et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2007). Zeolite-containing xerogels have been synthesized abundantly and tried to remove dyes (Vimonses et al., 2009; Ribeiro et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015; Ptaszkowska-Koniarz et al., 2017), heavy metals (Deze et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2013; Samiey et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2015) and chemical environmental contaminants (Sava et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2016; Haryanto and Khan, 2018) but their application for carrying a multi-component perfume oil by adsorption has not been reported yet for highly-preserved perfume products. Thus, it is worthwhile to examine the ability of the zeolite-containing xerogels to adsorb and desorb a multi-component oil. Clinoptilolite (CP) is a natural and characteristic zeolite involving a mesoporous organization of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide tetrahedral units as shown in Fig. 1 (Auerbach et al., 2003; Top and Ülkü, 2004). CP is utilized in some applications such as a chemical sieve (Arcoya et al., 1996; Ghiaci et al., 2004), a gaseous state adsorbent (Faghihian et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) and as a water filter (Vujaković et al., 2000; Smičiklas et al., 2007) for municipal and residential drinking water and aquariums. Freezing-thawing is a cyclic process that heats a frozen solution and freezes it again. This process may be repeated in multiple steps. Semi-crystalline polymers like PVA are able to induce crystallization by freeze-thawing and gain higher properties especially in terms of mechanical properties (Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2020; Said et al., 2020). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a semi-crystalline, atactic, and water-soluble polymer that is slowly biodegradable. PVA benefits from high film-forming and adhesion capabilities. PVA films have high mechanical properties but water acts as a plasticizer hence, the mechanical properties are moisture dependent and decrease as moisture increases. Because water penetration in crystals is harder than the amorphous domains, so highly crystalline PVA specimens exhibit less moisture-related properties. Adsorption capacity is another aspect that one must consider. Adsorption capacity can be monolayer and homogeneous or multilayer and heterogeneous (Saadi et al., 2015; Dada et al., 2016, 2017). Adsorption and desorption are equilibrium phenomena (Machida et al., 2004; Dada et al., 2019). Where perfume oil adsorbed less than its monolayer capacity on a adsorbent, adsorption is predominant phenomena, and adsorbent tends to keep perfume oil, where perfume oil adsorbed is more than the multilayer capacity, perfume oil behavior is like bulk perfume oil and volatile. So, it is necessary to measure monolayer and multilayer capacity to design a suitable control release system. In the present work, golden flower oil (GFO) which is a synthetic perfume used in the detergent industry of Iran, is used as a multi-component model compound containing different chemical components with different molecular characteristics in term of size, molar volume and also the functionality. The adsorbed and desorbed amount of this complex mixture on a natural zeolite i.e., Clinoptilolite (CP) and xerogel particles of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and CP (PVA/CP) are investigated and fitted by adsorption isotherms i.e., Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin. The relationship between adsorption and desorption of GFO from CP and PVA/CP with molecular characteristics of GFO components has been investigated. Modification of CP surface with PVA chains may adjust the adsorption of organic molecules. CP does not have carbon and lack of carbon-carbon interaction (dispersion forces) but PVA can introduce carbon and adjust adsorption through polar and dispersion forces."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Golden flower synthetic essence (GFO) was received from Pakshoo Co., Tehran, Iran. GFO was stored at 4 °C in a sealed, light-resistant hermetically sealed glass container until further use after characterization. Clinoptilolite (CP) was received from Afrand Tooska Inc., Semnan, Iran and dried for 7 h at 110 °C before further use. PVA (Mw = 32000, degree of hydrolysis 99%), decane (GC grade), 1-propanol, and acetone (HPLC grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, USA."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Characterization of GFO GFO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique using an Agilent 6890 instrument. To this end, GFO (10 μL) was dissolved in 2 mL ethanol and injected (0.5μL) via injection port into the GC-Mass instrument equipped with a capillary column (30 m length; 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25μm film thickness) using helium as a carrier gas. Injection port temperature was adjusted to 280 °C. The column oven temperature was kept at 50 °C for 2 min after sample injection then raised to 180 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 for 26 min. The specimen then runs through an MS (quadrupoles) detector for analysis. 2.2.2 Characterization of CP Specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore radius of CP specimens (0.1 g) were measured by multipoint CP Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) technique using a High-Speed Gas Adsorption Analyzer (NOVA 2200, Quantachrome Corporation, USA) using N2 gas. CP particles were dispersed uniformly on the surface of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) stub. The sample was sputter-coated (SCDOOS, Baltec, Switzerland) using gold to prevent static charge accumulation. SEM micrographs were taken at different magnification ratios using a Vega II (TeScan, Czech Republic) SEM instrument operating at 20 kV and equipped by a secondary electron detector. 2.2.3 Preparation of PVA xerogel particles The PVA/CP xerogel particle was prepared according to a modified method adopted from Fathi et al (Fathi et al., 2011). Briefly, CP (3 g) was stirred in deionized water (225 mL) for 12 h at 600 rpm using magnetic stirrer heated to 32 °C. During this period, the suspension was ultrasonicated for 15 min at every one-hour interval to obtain a better dispersion and de-agglomeration. At the same time, PVA (9 g) was dissolved in deionized water (125 mL) at 80 °C for 2 h. CP suspension was then gradually added to PVA solution and stirred for 12 h at 800 rpm using an overhead mechanical stirrer (RW 20 digital, IKA, Germany) equipped with a 3 bladed propeller (R 1381 Propeller stirrer, IKA, Germany). The final suspension was poured into a petri dish and freeze-thawed for four consecutive cycles at −20 and 25 °C temperatures. Each freezing-thawing cycle took 48 h consisting of 24 h freezing and 24 h thawing. PVA/CP films were turned into a powder by freeze-fracture/milling in a mortar grinder (Pulverisette, Fritsch, Germany) at −196 °C using liquid nitrogen. PVA/CP xerogel particles were passed through a sieve (mesh # 175, DAMAVAND Co., Iran) and collected for further analysis. 2.2.4 PVA/CP xerogel characterization PVA/CP xerogel particles were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Maia-3-F-200, NETZSCH, Germany), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA-SF1, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland), BET, and SEM techniques. The development of crystallinity in PVA xerogels due to the freezing-thawing cycles was traced by following the melting signal of PVA microcrystals using DSC. Before any further test, the specimens were dried thoroughly at 50 °C till constant weight. A definite weight (approx. 10 mg) of the pre-dried sample was placed into an aluminum pan and crimped. DSC run was recorded over the range of −50 to 150 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using the empty aluminum pan as a reference. Weight loss of pre-dried PVA/CP particles was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. Sample (10–15 mg) was placed in the TGA furnace and the measurement was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25°C to 600 °C. Morphology and specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore radius of PVA/CP xerogel particles were studied according to the said methods under Section 2.2.2 for CP particles using SEM and BET techniques, respectively. 2.2.5 GFO adsorption study GFO (45 mg eq. to 50 μL) was added to 10 mL test tubes containing acetone (3 mL) and dissolved by shaking after sealing. CP or PVA/CP (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 g) particles were gradually added to the tubes. After mixing by sonication at room temperature for 2 min, the tubes were sealed again and located in a water bath equilibrated at 32 °C. Solid particles were separated from the mixture after 24 h by centrifugation at 5000 rpm (Sigma 2K15C refrigerated centrifuge, Sigma, England) for 5 min. GFO components, present in the supernatant samples were characterized and quantified according to the following method. Decane solution in acetone (234 ppm) was added as the internal standard to of the supernatant solution in 1:2 volume ratio. The mixture was passed through a syringe-head Teflon filter (Spartan 0.2 μm, Whatman, England) and injected to GC-MS equipment. The concentration of the GFO components was determined separately according to Eq. (1). (1) AUCIS AUCGFO ' s Component = CIS CGFO ' s Component where, AUC IS and AUC GFO’s Component are the signals area for decane solution (internal standard) and any specific component of the GFO, respectively. C IS and C GFO’s Component represents the concentration of decane and the specific GFO component, respectively. The amount of GFO adsorbed on CP or PVA/CP was calculated by subtracting the amount of each specific GFO components in the supernatant (mmol) considering the initial amount (mmol) of the same GFO component in the blank (Eq. (2)) which was converted from mmol to mg considering the molecular weight of the same component. (2) n adsorbed = n blank − n supernatant where, n adsorbed , n blank , and n supernatant represent adsorbed amount (mmol), initial amount (mmol), and amount in the supernatant (mmol) for each specific GFO component, respectively. The concentration of GFO in each GFO, CP, or PVA/CP mixture was compared to the concentration of GFO in GFO, CP, or PVA/CP mixture considering 0.1 g mass for CP and PVA/CP mass. The relative concentration of each component was calculated using Eq. (3). (3) Relative concentration = W Component V × 0.1 g W CP or PVA / CP where, W Component , V, and W CP or PVA/CP represent the weight of each GFO component (mg), the volume of GFO solution (mL), and weight of CP or PVA/CP as an adsorbent (g), respectively. The adsorbed amount per gram of adsorbent (mg g−1) was plotted vs. concentration (g. L−1). Adsorption of GFO components on CP or PVA/CP adsorbents can be normalized according to the relative molar concentration of each specific component especially considering the fact that measurements by chromatography are based on the mole fraction and in Eq. (1), moles were converted to mass by using the molar mass of each component. Selective adsorption index (SAI) for each specific component was defined as the amount (in mmol) of the component adsorbed per 100 g adsorbent (Eq. (4)) (See Appendix A). (4) SAI = S × R p × MW where, S is the slope of adsorbed amount (mL.g−1) vs. concentration (g.L−1) curve for each component, R is the higher limit of concentration subtracted by the lower limit of concentration(g. L−1) of the component in the adsorption curve, p is the component percentage in GFO, and M W is the molecular weight of the component. 2.2.6 Desorption study Pre-dried CP and PVA/CP (0.4 g) was gradually added into 1.44 g (1.6 mL) of GFO into the test tube, separately. Sealed test tubes were located in a water bath at 32oC for 24 h. Then the solid particles were settled down by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and separated from GFO. To remove the bulk GFO residue, the solid particles were located between two filter paper and gently pressed. In 10-mL test tubes; 1-propanol (3 mL) was added to the particles (0.3 g) and incubated in a water bath at 32 °C. After 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, and 24 h, the particles were settled down by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Decane solution (1 mL) was added to the supernatant (2 mL) and filtered using a 0.2 μm Teflon syringe-head filter. Upon sampling, the desorption medium (1-propanol) was completely replaced with an equal volume of fresh 1- propanol. The amount of desorbed GFO was determined by GC-Mass spectroscopy similar to the adsorption study using Eq. (1) as previously mentioned under Section 2.2.5."
4,Result and discussion,
5,GFO composition,"3.1 GFO composition Similar to any other natural or synthetic perfume oils, GFO contains different components having different chemical structures hence, different physicochemical properties. Gas chromatogram for GFO is shown in Fig. A of Appendix B to support the many chemical entities composing the GFO composition. As Fig. A shows the chemical structure of GFO components are very close to each other. Mass spectroscopy interpretation of GFO components that appeared in the gas chromatogram is tabulated in Table 1 . Table 1 just shows the top 12 components with the highest contribution in the GFO composition in terms of molar ratio. Chemical structures of the GFO components are shown in Table A of Appendix B. These 12 components constituting 69.44% of the GFO composition are well-known components widely used in the preparation of synthetic fragrances."
6,CP Surface characteristics,"3.2 CP Surface characteristics BET test is generally used to determine the surface characteristics of the adsorbent materials like specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore size. In this technique, the above-mentioned properties are calculated from the physical adsorption of small-molecule gases like nitrogen gas (N2). Adsorption and desorption isotherms of N2 on CP and PVA/CP particles at 77 K are shown in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2, by increasing the relative pressure of N2, adsorption of N2 on CP and PVA/CP particles was increased linearly until a relative pressure of 0.8 where N2 adsorption increased rapidly afterward. The linear part of the curve is considered as monolayer adsorption and is used to calculate specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pores size in BET test. In the BET test of CP in Fig. 2 (black lines), the desorption curve doesn’t match the adsorption curve showing a hysteresis loop. This phenomenon is due to the condensation of nitrogen at pressures below the saturated vapor pressure of N2 in porous media in which nitrogen condensation releases energy in the adsorption process and the desorption process, nitrogen molecules need more energy. This phenomenon is called capillary condensation and is a sign of supporting the mesoporous structure for an adsorbent (Neimark and Ravikovitch, 2001). Specific surface area, total pore volume, and average radius of pores for CP particles according to the findings obtained by multipoint BET technique were measured as 19.50 m2 g−1, 0.075 mL g−1, and 75.56 Å, respectively. According to the findings, the CP adsorbent surface must be rough and porous. Specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore size of PVA/CP xerogel particles were also eq. to 1.0679 m2 g−1, 4.6447E-3 mL g−1 and 73.88 Å, respectively. The specific surface area of the xerogel particles was decreased by approximately 20 times and reached the lowest possible level. The volume of pores also decreased sharply, but the size of the pores in the PVA/CP xerogel particles was almost unchanged compared to CP particles. For the easier comparison, the results of the BET test for CP and PVA/CP specimens are listed in Table 2 . PVA is a semi-crystalline polymer but lacks the pores as large as a mesoporous adsorbent. The pore size of PVA/CP is about the same as the pore size of the CP particles alone may be due to the presence of some of the CP particles on PVA/CP surface. CP particles on the surface are a fraction of all the CP particles present in the specimen. This fact may describe why the total pore volume in PVA/CP is much less than that in CP."
7,Morphology of the particles,"3.3 Morphology of the particles SEM micrographs of PVA/CP particles in different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3 compared to the CP particles. PVA/CP particles had a more uniform particle size distribution compared to the pristine clay particles, and the size of PVA/CP particles is almost the same. But the CP particle size is either very fine or very large and scabby. The appearance of PVA/CP particles is not spherical and is multifaceted. To evaluate CP zeolite particle distribution in the PVA matrix, microscopic images were obtained from surface and cross-section area of PVA/CP xerogel particles, and distribution of carbon and silicon elements was investigated in these particles by EDAX analysis. Fig. 4 a and b illustrate carbon and silicon elemental map of PVA/CP surface and the cross-section of PVA/CP particles, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, silicon element is distributed uniformly in the microscopic image of the carbon element, which reflects the fact that the particles of CP zeolite are distributed uniformly in PVA. The presence of silicon on the PVA/CP particle surface and the presence of carbon in the cross-section of the particles represents a uniform and consistent distribution of CP particles and PVA matrix."
8,Thermal analysis study,"3.4 Thermal analysis study Adsorption is a heterogeneous process and adsorbent should not be soluble in the adsorption media. CP is not soluble in 1-propanol and even though PVA is not soluble in 1-propanol, but in order to decrease PVA solubility in 1-propanol more and more, freezing-thawing cycles were applied to induce physical cross-linking by induction of crystallization in PVA. The use of freezing-thawing cycles to increase the degree of cross-linking through crystallization induction is a well-known method for some polymers e.g., PVA (Hassan and Peppas, 2000; Ricciardi et al., 2004), gelatin (Van Vlierberghe et al., 2010) and starch (Wang et al., 2013). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate the cross-links formed as PVA microcrystals after freezing-thawing cycles (Watase and Nishinari, 1985; Peppas and Scott, 1992; Ricciardi et al., 2004). Fig. 5 shows the DSC and TGA thermograms of PVA/CP xerogel after 4 cycles of freezing-thawing. As it is clear from Fig. 5, the DSC shows a well-formed peak of crystal melting at 221 °C (Liu et al., 2019). Comparing the DSC with TGA shows that the peak is related to crystallinity and the degradation peak of the PVA appears at higher temperature i.e., 283 °C (Liu et al., 2019). An increase in the peak area of the freeze-thawed specimen (−8.059 J/g) in comparison with PVA (−6.798 J/g) at 221 °C resulted from an increase in crystallization through the freeze-thawing cycles. It can be concluded from the DSC thermogram that crystallization induction and physical cross-linking through these crystals (Hu et al., 2019) have been successful."
9,Adsorption study,"3.5 Adsorption study Adsorption is the potential of all solids to bind molecules in different physical states to their surfaces. The solids are named adsorbents and the adsorbed molecules are usually mentioned as the adsorbate. Fig. 6 shows the adsorption curve for the first 12 components of the GFO (in terms of their contribution in the oil composition) on CP and PVA/CP particles as adsorbents at different concentrations. As it is evident from Fig. 6, by increasing the concentration of GFO, adsorption of the components on CP and PVA/CP increases linearly. Linear increase and the zero gradients of the adsorption with the increase in concentration can be attributed to the fact that adsorption experiments have been performed at lower concentrations of GFO at a level well below to saturate all the adsorption sites on the surface of the CP and PVA/CP particles. Adsorption on PVA/CP particles has been increased for all of the investigated components relative to adsorption on CP particles as adsorbent according to the adsorption findings depicted in Fig. 6. Among the GFO components, the 9th component had the highest adsorption onto the CP and PVA/CP. Except for the 9th which has the least increase by changing adsorbent from CP to PVA/CP, the rest of the GFO components have shown a higher adsorption slope and amount in PVA/CP particles as an adsorbent. That is, CP can be used as an adsorbent for selective adsorption of the 9th component from the mixture composing GFO composition in a competitive state. The selective adsorption index (SAI) shows a higher adsorption tendency in the mixture of components. SAI for adsorption of all GFO components on CP and PVA/CP are tabulated in Table 3 . The SAIs of adsorption of all the GFO components on PVA/CP particles are more than that on CP particles. That is, PVA/CP particles tend to adsorb the GFO components more than CP particles. This can be attributed to the polar and dispersive interactions occurring between functional groups and the CH2 , >CH units of PVA structure and functional groups and the carbon atoms of the GFO components. Although the SAI of the 9th component has been increased, its increase is very low. The 6th component showed the highest increase in terms of SAI among the GFO components investigated, and its amount has almost 7-fold increased when the adsorbent was changed from CP particles to PVA/CP particles. Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) of GFO components are tabulated in Table A in Appendix B. Dispersive, polar and hydrogen bonding parts of HSP solubility parameters indicate the bonding energies arising from dispersion forces, dipolar intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds occurring between molecules, respectively. A comparison of the SAI of GFO components on CP and PVA/CP with δP 2/Vm of each component is depicted in Fig. 7 . As Fig. 7 shows, SAI increases by increasing δP and decreasing the molar volume (Vm). δP is the polar part of HSP and represents the polarity of the molecule. Vm is the molar volume and represents the size of molecule. Fig. 7 shows both CP and PVA/CP as adsorbent tends to adsorb more polar components with smaller molar volume. The slope of the correlation for PVA/CP particles as adsorbent is more than that for CP particles as an adsorbent, which means SAI for PVA/CP particles is more sensible to δP 2/Vm. The SAI of GFO components and other components with known polarity and molar volume on CP and PVA/CP can be predicted by Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively. (5) SAI CP = − 5.4177 + 60.9432 × δ P 2 V m (6) SAI PVA / CP = − 4.0593 + 62.6214 × δ P 2 V m Adsorption isotherms of all 12 GFO components on CP and PVA/CP particles fitted by using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models. Table 4 shows the results of the fitting with these models. Langmuir isotherm represents a homogeneous adsorbent surface and monolayer adsorption, but Freundlich isotherm represents heterogeneous surface for adsorbent and multilayer adsorption. Temkin isotherm is usually used for heterogeneous surface energy systems (non-uniform distribution of sorption heat) (Keshavarz et al., 2020). As Table 4 shows all of the 12 components are well-fitted with Langmuir model so, except for Comp2 and Comp4, the value of R2 for the Langmuir model is higher than R2 in the Freundlich model. The value of R2 in the Freundlich model for Comp2 and Comp4 is just slightly more than the value of R2 in the Langmuir model. The regression coefficient of the fitted data using Freundlich isotherm was higher than that for Temkin isotherm. In Table 4, KL, KF, and bT are constants in Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin equations, respectively. AT and n are intensities of adsorption in Freundlich and Temkin models, respectively, and qmax is maximum monolayer adsorption. Langmuir isotherm relies on homogenous monolayer adsorption and Freundlich relies on heterogeneous multilayer adsorption. Temkin isotherm assumes that the heat of adsorption reduces linearly by increasing adsorption. According to the fitting data with Langmuir isotherm, it could be concluded that GFO adsorbed amount on CP and PVA/CP was homogenous and monolayer considering the low concentrations of adsorbate investigated. Maximum monolayer adsorption (qmax) for all of the 12 components of GFO are tabulated in Table 5 . Monolayer adsorbed amount for components with different chemical structure is different. The 9th component which is a small molecule with primary alcohol functionality possessed the highest maximum monolayer adsorption. On the other hand, 2th and 4th which are alcohols with lager molar volume have the smallest maximum monolayer adsorption. Except for the components: Comp3, Comp8, Comp11, and Comp12, the qmax value for other components has increased by changing the adsorbent from CP to PVA/CP. The Comp6 and Comp12 have the largest increase and decrease in qmax value, respectively. With regard to the composition percentage of each component and the average of maximum monolayer adsorption for 12 components was calculated as Eq. (7). (7) Q = ∑ q i × p i ∑ p i where q i is maximum monolayer adsorption for each component (mg g−1), Q is the maximum monolayer adsorption of all 12 components, and p i is the composition percentage of each component in GFO. The calculated Q parameter for CP and PVA/CP adsorbents was equal to 198.78 and 231.93 mg g−1, respectively, as listed in Table 5. PVA/CP particles can adsorb and solidify GFO more than the CP particles due to introducing extra carbon-carbon interaction (Dispersion forces), although the specific surface area of the CP particles is approximately 20 times more than the specific surface area of the PVA/CP particles."
10,Desorption study,"3.6 Desorption study GFO is a hydrophobic mixture of oily compounds and when is desorbed in water, separate in two-phases which is not appropriate for analysis due to the heterogeneous composition so, a surfactant or organic solvents may be necessary to resolve the phase separation issues for analytical purposes. Surfactants may interfere with the analysis of the GFO components and broaden the peaks in gas chromatogram hence, it was avoided. However, GFO desorption was done in the presence of 1-propanol as an organic solvent which forms a single-phase solution. Fig. 8 shows the amount of the GFO desorbed from CP and PVA/CP particles at different time intervals in 1-propanol as a solvent. The desorbed amount of GFO components from both adsorbents was reduced non-linearly as a function of time. After about 4 h from the desorption process, 60% of the GFO components were released from the particles but after 24 h, it reached the lowest value and the corresponding cumulative graphs were leveled off. The desorbed amounts for all of the GFO components from PVA/CP particles were less than the amount released from the CP particles, which indicates that PVA/CP adsorbent is less likely to release its adsorbed components in the release medium. Maximum monolayer capacity according to Langmuir isotherm reported under adsorption study (Section 3.5) and maximum desorbed amount observed as a level-off amount in the cumulative desorption in Fig. 8 for each component in 1-propanol are listed in Table 5. A comparison of the maximum amount of GFO components desorbed from CP and PVA/CP adsorbents are shown in Fig. 9 along with the Vm*p/δP values for each component. As Fig. 9 shows, the maximum amount of each component desorbed increases linearly by increasing the Vm and p and decreasing the polarity of each component (δP). p represents the percentage of each component in GFO chemical composition. According to Fig. 9, both CP and PVA/CP adsorbents tend to desorb less polar components with larger molar volume first. The slope of Fig. 9 for PVA/CP particles as adsorbent is less than that for CP particles, which means the maximum desorbed amount for PVA/CP particles is less sensible to Vm*p/δP parameter. The maximum amount of GFO components desorbed from CP and PVA/CP can be predicted by Eqs. (8) and (9), respectively. (8) Maximum amount desorbed CP = 13.8660 + 0.1470 × V m × p δ P (9) Maximum amount desorbed PVA / CP = 5.8990 + 0.1066 × V m × p δ P By comparing the results of adsorption and desorption studies, it can be concluded that PVA/CP particles can adsorb more of the GFO components as an adsorbent and desorb it over a longer period of time because their maximum amount adsorbed as a monolayer is more for PVA/CP specimens and maximum amount desorbed from PVA/CP is less than that from CP particles as an adsorbent."
11,Conclusion,"GFO amount adsorbed on CP particles increased with increasing in GFO concentration. The value was different for each GFO component but the percentage of each component in GFO was not correlated with the adsorbed amount. Adsorbed amount of GFO components on synthesized PVA/CP particles was higher than that on CP particles. The lack of correlation between adsorbed amount and percentage of each component in GFO indicates that these adsorbents can be used in selective adsorption and separation of GFO components from each other. The SAI of GFO components was linearly correlated with δP 2/Vm parameter. SAI increased by increasing in the polarity and decreasing in molar volume of each specific component. This indicates the significant role of polarity and molar volume on SAI. Curve fitting using adsorbed amount of GFO on CP and PVA/CP adsorbents to Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms, it was found that the adsorption of GFO on CP and PVA/CP is in agreement with the Langmuir isotherm indicating monolayer and homogeneous adsorption. Desorption of GFO from CP and PVA/CP adsorbents showed that the desorbed amount was decreased non-linearly over time and after approximately 4 h, the desorbed amount was almost constant. The desorbed amount of CP particles was higher than the PVA/CP adsorbents. Considering the higher adsorption of GFO on PVA/CP particles, it can be concluded that the PVA/CP adsorbent tends to adsorb GFO more but had less tendency to desorb the same. The maximum desorbed amount of each component of CP and PVA/CP adsorbents is a linear function of Vm*p/δP, parameter which means the smaller components in terms of dimension or the components with the higher percentage in terms of composition or having the less polarity were desorbed faster from CP and PVA/CP particles. Finally, it can be concluded that PVA/CP adsorbent can be used as an adsorbent with high adsorption potential and less tendency to desorb GFO components or other fragrance molecules with similar polarity and molar volume of GFO components."
