0,Introduction,"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an amphiphilic polymer with the general molecular structure of R-O-(CH2-CH2-O)n–OH, where R is the alkyl group and n is the average number of repeating units and it is used extensively in the industry as specialty nonionic surfactants as well as being used widely in household products, pharmacy, biotechnological application and food industries.[1] Breakthrough applications include usage as a skin permeability enhancer for skincare products [2] as well as in the production of hydrophilic pressure sensitive adhesives [2]. They are most commonly prepared via the addition of ethylene oxide onto aliphatic alcohols in the presence of appropriate catalysts, whereby various surfactant homologs can be synthesized by altering the length of the alkyl chain of the alcohols or the amount of ethylene oxide monomer duplicated in the macromolecule. PEG is cheap, relatively harmless chemically, possess low volatility and are biodegradable [3,4] but a unique characteristic which they retain is their ability to be solvated efficiently in water as well as most organic solvents for instance methyl chloride, [3] ethanol, toluene, acetone, and chloroform, [5] hence making them ideal to be used as an environmentally friendly green solvent. [6,7] This exceptional property arises due to the presence of hydroxyl terminal group at the end of the chain, which is not present in contemporary solvents such as dimethyl-ethylene oxide and polyethylene-oxide. In addition, the repeating unit of PEGs is structured as an open crown ring ether conformation as well as having the ability for manipulation of its active hydrogen atom (attached to hetero atom) to form a reactive anion to which other molecules or surface can be attached to, both of which gives rise to several unusual reaction with molecules and ions as described by Frensdorff et al. [8]. For specialized application, PEG based surfactants are usually mixed with other substances, but the most common additive are alcohols, which develop into micro-emulsions or alternative solubilized systems and thereby improving the performance of PEG. A case in point would be the usage of short to medium chain length alcohols concurrently with PEG in the tertiary oil recovery process so as to decrease the dynamic viscosity and increase the stability of the micellar system present, hence directly improving the efficiency and reducing associated costs of the process.[9] Another example would be the usage of PEG (surfactant)/alcohol mixture as an on-site flushing agent for the remediation of aquifer water sources contaminated with non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). [10] This specific use-cases are of distinct interest as the ternary system of alcohol-surfactant-water as well as the role of alcohols on both equilibrium and dynamic properties of aqueous micellar solutions have been studied and reported on comprehensively in literature, especially important properties such as critical micelle concentration (CMC), surface tension, counter-ion binding and aggregation number. [11] Nonetheless, specialized research of binary system consisting of surfactant namely PEG and alcohol alone are few and far between, with notable exceptions being the papers published by Zana, [12–14] Muller-Plathe [15] and Førland et al. [16] An issue in observing such systems is the inability to quantify parameters associated with micellar formation as well as other related properties for instance degree of hydrogen bonding and spatial density. Hence, this study is vital in establishing a solid basis for binary solution behavior in order to facilitate studies on more complex ternary systems and analysis can be performed via molecular dynamic simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a well-established technique and tool used in examining microscopic structures and properties of atomistic systems in general. It’s very beneficial in understanding the physical basis of the structure–function relationship of macromolecules at the atomistic level as well as providing essential information regarding the motions of particles as a function of time. Consequently, MD simulations can be used to model specific systems in much more reasonable manner than actual experiments on the system, thereby avoiding any potential hazards involved in addition to providing more accurate representations and data. In the previous work, [17] we have endeavored to observe and examine the solution behavior of polyethylene glycol monolaurate (PEGML), a PEG-based surfactant in alcohols via MD simulation. PEGML is widely used as emulsifier blends, thickener, wetting and dispersing agent, resin plasticizer, emollient, opacifier, spreading agent, and viscosity control agents [18] in addition to specialized application in metalworking, paper pulp production, textiles and as defoamers for latex paints. Hence a detailed investigation into the physicochemical and dynamic rheological behaviors of PEG/aqueous/alcohol mixtures is beneficial in improving their current performance and increase their potential application in numerous other fields. Nonetheless it must be noted that scarce information or data is available on the relation between the structure and the properties of these mixtures as mentioned earlier. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to observe and better comprehend the properties of PEGML in alcohol solvents in addition to uncovering specific features of their dynamic properties such as shear viscosities extracted from the MD atomistic simulations. The information of the rheological properties of PEGs with the addition of co-surfactants such as alcohols can provide useful information about the microstructure as well as stability of PEG-based emulsions. It is interesting to see how the aliphatic alcohols with polar OH group responsible for the shear viscosity of surfactant solutions. To that end, the simulations were performed by using the freely available GROMACS software package (version 4.6.5). [19]"
1,Simulation details,"NEMD simulation was carried out to calculate the shear viscosities based on the periodic perturbation method. According to the work of Hess, [20] the simulated system is subjected to an external shear-stress acceleration field which induces a velocity gradient of the liquid, and the shear viscosity can be determined from the resulting velocity. For these calculations, the equilibrated boxes from the equilibrium simulation were used and has been described previously. [17] Briefly, the automated topology builder MKTOP (Perl-based), pioneered by Ribeiro et al. [21] was used to create the initial topology for GROMACS following which it was examined and corrected for inconsistencies. Partial charges of PEGML were computed using the semi-empirical Austin Model I using bond charge correction (AM1-BCC) [19,22] which reproduces ab-initio electrostatic potentials, via the HyperChem [23] molecular modelling environment provided by Hypercube Inc. In this simulation, a binary mixture composed of 990 molecules of alcohol was solvated with 10 molecules of PEGML; this corresponded to oligomer’s mole fraction (x 1) of 0.01. Force field parameterization for PEGML as well as organic alcohols/water solvents were implemented from the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations – All Atom (OPLS-AA) [24] forcefield by Jorgensen, that of alcohols except 2-propanol were obtained from the Virtual Chemistry Database.[25] While the liquid simulation box for 2-propanol was formulated by applying Caleman et al. [25] Density Functional Theory (DFT) via the Gaussian 09 [26] electronic structure program, whereby DFT calculations were used to determine the atomic charges of 2-propanol, with the gradient–corrected energy Becke exchange and the three parameter Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) [27] as well as the 6-311G [28] (molecular orbital determination) as the basis functions. The molecular structure of solvents along with their partial charges are given in Fig. 1 . The PEGML-solvent mixtures were then energy minimized for 500,000 steps via a steepest-descent method and step size of 0.001 to remove unfavorable contacts due to initial random configuration of molecules. Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) [29] with 12th order expansion of the constraint coupling matrix was used to constraint bonds during minimization. Thereafter, equilibration of the system was carried out to stabilize the system before analysis. Firstly, the model box was simulated at 1 bar and 298.15 K for 100 ps under the NVT ensemble (constant number of particles, constant volume and constant temperature) followed by 5 ns of simulations under the isothermal-isobaric NPT ensemble (constant number of particles, constant pressure and constant temperature) with negligible velocity generation at 298.15 K and 1 bar. A 5 ns simulation time was selected as it was deemed adequate for proper equilibration of system as per Bedrov et al. [30] The equilibrated systems were further used to carry out NEMD simulations. Different values of shear-stress acceleration in the range of (0.005 to 0.08) nm.ps2 were used to perform an independent simulation in the length of 1.2 ns. For each of simulation, only the last 1 ns was used for analysis. The viscosity was calculated for each of shear-stress acceleration rate and then extrapolated to obtain the zero-shear rate viscosity."
2,Result and discussion,"The accuracy of trajectory and coordinate data obtained from simulated system is verified by carrying out experimental density measurements and comparing those results to that of the MD simulations. The comparison is presented in Table 1 and the results indicated that satisfactory agreement has been obtained. There are several established techniques to determine the viscosity from MD simulations, for example, the Green-Kubo and the Einstein methods. The viscosity obtained from these methods are calculated from the pressure or momentum fluctuations. It is found, however, the convergence of both methods is very slowly, because the heavy fluctuation of the pressure of the simulation box. [31] Hess [32] compared and tested various methods to determine the shear viscosity based on periodic perturbation (PP) originated from the work of Gosling et al. [33] According to the method of Hess, the external force, namely shear-stress acceleration, is applied to the system. The viscosity of the liquid is then computed from the response of the system to the applied function. According to the Navier-Stokes equation, the external force applied in the system will cause a velocity field u in the liquid: (1) ρ ∂ u ∂ t + ρ ( u. ∇ ) = ρ a - ∇ p + η ∇ 2 u where a is the external force per unit of mass and volume. The external force in Eq. (1) is chosen such that a y , a z , or a x is a function of z only. As a result, u y and u z equal to zero. It is found that the pressure gradient in the x-direction is negligible, hence, the Eq. (1) above reduces to: (2) ρ ∂ u x ( z ) ∂ t = ρ a x ( z ) + η ∂ 2 u x ( z ) ∂ z 2 By using the steady state principle for a Newtonian liquid, the velocity gradient due to the addition of a small force will follow the equation shown below: (3) a x ( z ) + η ρ ∂ 2 u x ( z ) ∂ z 2 = 0 In Eq. (3), an acceleration in the x-direction is applied to each of particles in the system. This acceleration is a function of the z-coordinate, or a x(z). To generate a smooth velocity profile with small local shear rates, the applied periodic function is sinusoidal (cosine function): (4) a x ( z ) = A cos ( k z ) here k refers to as the number for the wave-index; A is the applied acceleration; and z is the z-coordinate of the particle in the simulation box. The wave-index number is related to the height of the box (l z) as follows: (5) k = 2 π l z Here, the acceleration amplitude A reflects the strength of the perturbation. When u z = 0 at t = 0, the generated velocity profile when the system reaches steady state is: (6) u x ( z ) = V cos 2 π z l z where (7) V = A ρ η lz 2 π 2 Eq. (7) is further used to calculate the viscosity: (8) η = A V ρ lz 2 π 2 where V is defined as: (9) V = ∑ i = 1 N m i u i,x 2 cos 2 π z l z ∑ i = 1 N m i In order to avoid disturbance in the equilibrium of the simulated system, the shear rate should be set smaller than one over the longest correlation time in the system. For most liquids, it is around 10 ps. In this case, the value of A should be smaller than 0.1 nm.ps2. Finally, the zero shear rate viscosity from NEMD simulations is obtained by doing extrapolation from simulated data from a series of finite shear rates [33]. In the present work, the viscosity from NEMD simulation has been computed with the same simulation boxes as were used for the equilibrium. Eight amplitudes of the imposed acceleration A (0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.08) nm.ps2 with simulation time length of 1200 ps for each A was applied at each state point for six binary systems of PEGML with the aliphatic alcohols. In total, 30 NEMD simulations in total with an aggregate length of 36 ns have been performed to study the viscosities of binary systems composed of PEGML with alcohols. The viscosity was calculated for different shear-stress acceleration rates and then extrapolated to obtain the zero-shear rate viscosity as depicted in Fig. 2 . The simulated viscosities obtained in this work are shown in Table 2 . The results reveal that the shear viscosity follows the order of PEGML + tert-butanol > PEGML + 1-pentanol > PEGML + 2-butanol > PEGML + 2-propanol > PEGML + ethanol > PEGML + methanol. The results indicate the general trends of viscosities for the aliphatic alcohols [34–36]. This probably due to the lower concentration of the PEGML used in this simulation, i.e. x 1 = 0.01, hence the binary mixture behavior resembles to that of pure alcohols. Among all the alcohols studied in this work, however, tert-butanol showed the highest viscosity value at temperature of 298.15 K. Unfortunately, a sound conclusion cannot be made since there are no direct comparison with the experimental results or reference values. Therefore, further investigation is required to assess the accuracy of NEMD simulations."
3,Conclusion,"The NEMD simulations were performed to study the dynamic properties, i.e. viscosity, of binary systems composed of PEGML with six aliphatic alcohols: methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and 1-pentanol. The accuracy of the simulation was checked by computing the densities of all studies mixtures to those of literature values. The periodic perturbation method was employed by applying 8 different sets of acceleration amplitude by using freely GROMACS package. The results reveal that the highest shear viscosity is found for PEGML + tert-butanol while the lowest for PEGML + methanol."
