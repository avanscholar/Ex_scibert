0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a highly active, selective, versatile and environmentally friendly oxidizing agent with many practical uses in e.g. pulp and paper bleaching, chemical and detergent synthesis, wastewater treatment, metallurgy, and the textile and electronics industries. Currently, more than 95% of the world's H2O2 is produced using an indirect anthraquinone (AQ) process to produce concentrated H2O2 [1]. However, the conventional indirect process, while having the advantage of avoiding the direct mixing of H2 and O2, has a significant cost penalty, due to the high cost of the reductant (AQ) and the complex operating system needed for the separation and the removal of organic impurities from the reaction mixture [2]. Another potentially safer and more economic approach, which overcomes concerns related to the AQ process that has received wide attention is the direct synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst. The reaction H2 + O2 → H2O2 represents, in principle, the simplest method of forming hydrogen peroxide; however, capital investment, operating costs and safety issues need to be considered as H2/O2 mixtures are explosive over a wide concentration range, necessitating either close control of the hydrogen to oxygen ratio, or the use of diluents such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or argon. Also, the current H2O2 production process cannot be considered ‘green’ in terms of the organics used, while direct synthesis approaches present interesting possibilities for in situ H2O2 applications [3]. The utility of palladium as an efficient mono-catalyst for the direct synthesis of H2O2 was first noted in a patent application made by Hugo Henkel et al. in 1994 [4]. More recently, the direct synthesis of H2O2, in high yields, using Pd-based catalysts, has received attention in academia [5–8]. Pd-based catalysts have been developed on various supports e.g. silica, and high surface area carbon [9,10]. Cost-effective bimetallic Pd-M catalysts with improved catalytic selectivity have also been successfully developed for direct synthesis [11,12]. Lately, metallic gold has shown interesting results when alloyed with Pd, with the resulting composite showing enhanced activity to hydrogen, together with better catalytic performance and product selectivity [13–15]. Previous research has shown that converting the chemical structure from face-centered cubic (fcc) to face-centered tetragonal (fct) will increase ferromagnetic properties and enhance electrochemical catalytic ability in the oxygen reduction reaction pathway [16,17]. In this study we focused on the synthesis of mesoporous carbon supported PdNi bimetallic catalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2 in acid conditions. Meanwhile, an electrochemical method was developed for the in situ detection of H2O2 during the direct synthesis process. The results show that significant quantities of highly active fcc-Pd050Ni050 can be produced (compared to monometal Pd catalyst production). Interestingly, with controlled hydrogen-assisted heat treatment, the fcc PdNi (denoted as fcc-PdNi) structure can be converted to a fct PdNi (denoted as fct-PdNi) structure. Experimentally, the fct-Pd050Ni050 catalysts showed a much-enhanced catalytic efficiency for the direct synthesis of H2O2, with its specific activity being 4 times higher than that of the fcc-Pd050Ni050 catalyst."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The fcc-PdNi catalysts were prepared on mesoporous silica (SBA-15) using an impregnation method (as shown in Fig. S1 in supporting information). Firstly, a mixture, of Pd(acac)2 (acac = acetylacetonate) and Ni(acac)2 in 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene, furfuryl alcohol and oxalic acid, was stirred for 15 min to form a gel, which was then aged in an air flow at 80 °C and 150 °C (12 h each temperature). The resulting solid was thermally treated at 750 °C in a flow of N2 for 4 h. After this, it was placed in 1% HF (24 h) to remove the substrate's silica. The catalysts were filtered, washed with D.I. water and alcohol. Finally, fcc-PdNi catalysts were prepared by drying at 100 °C for 8 h. Three compositions, namely Pd025Ni075 (ratio 1:3), Pd050Ni050 (ratio 1:1), and Pd075Ni025 (ratio 3:1) were prepared in the preliminary study and fcc-Pd050Ni050 (ratio 1:1) was chosen due to better activity for subsequent investigation (see Fig. S2 and S3 in the supporting information). To achieve the structural transformation from face-centered cubic (fcc) to face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure, the catalysts were calcined in 5%H2/Ar at 750 °C for 4 h. In this study, 3 samples were prepared and denoted as fct-Pd050Ni050, fcc-Pd050Ni050 and Pd/C, respectively. These catalysts were assessed for their ability to produce hydrogen peroxide and examined to determine the effects of structure and alloying on heterogeneous catalytic activity."
3,Characterization of materials,"2.2 Characterization of materials All the catalysts were characterized by using XRD, TEM, XAS, EXAFS, and ICP-AES. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the fcc-Pd050Ni050 and fct-Pd050Ni050 catalysts were collected using a D2 phaser diffractometer (2θ range from 15° to 85°, scan rate 0.1 deg·s−1) to identify the presence of bimetallic alloys. The transmission electron micrometer (FEI Tecnai G2 FE-TEM) had an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray absorption spectra were recorded following a literature procedure [18,19] at the beamline station BL01C1 in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC), Taiwan. The electron storage ring was operated at 1.5 GeV with a current of 300 mA. Measurements were made at room temperature with solid samples. Pd foil, Ni foil were used as references for the Pd K- and Ni K-edges. Parameter control for extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurement, data collection modes, and calculation of errors were all implemented following the guidelines set by the International EXAFS Society Standard and Criteria Committee [20]. The EXAFS function, χ, was established by subtracting the post-edge background from the adsorption and normalized with the edge jump step. The normalized χ(E) was transformed from energy space to k-space. The k-space values ranging from 2.3 to 15.0 Å−1 for Ni K-edge and Pd K-edge were Fourier transformed (FT) to r-space values to separate the EXAFS contributions from the different coordination shells [21]. The total metal loadings in the materials were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES)."
4,In situ detection of H2O2 formation,"2.3 In situ detection of H2O2 formation An electrochemical method was developed to perform in situ detection of H2O2 during direct synthesis. A three-electrode cell consisting a bare working electrode (no surface catalyst immobilized on a GCE), a high surface area Au counter electrode, and a saturated reference calomel electrode (SCE) powered by a potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab pgstat302N). The potential window was set from 0 V to 1 V (vs. SCE) to ensure the quantitative detection of hydrogen peroxide on the working electrode. The experiment was carried out in two stages. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to detect in situ different concentrations of H2O2 to establish a calibration curve at a set potential. Following this, H2O2 production was detected using the powder catalyst (10 mg) in a continuously stirred cell reactor. All measurements were made by first purging the reactor with Ar, followed by feeding in 5% H2/Ar and O2 (ratio 1:1) at 25 °C. A solution of H2SO4 (0.5 M, 200 ml) was used as the supporting electrolyte for all experiments (Fig. 1 )."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic characterization,"3.1 Catalytic characterization 3.1.1 XRD The PdNi catalysts' diffraction peaks were measured at the 2θ position between 40.1° and 44.5° (Fig. 2 ). This result shows a significant shift of the (111) peak from that found in pure Pd (JCPDS file 05-0681), pure Ni (JCPDS file 04-0850) and Pd/C nanoparticles. This clearly indicates that alloyed Pd and Ni nanoparticles were successfully formed in the mesoporous template. It can be seen from the XRD patterns that there were no new peaks when comparing fcc-Pd050Ni050 and fct-Pd050Ni050, but it is important to note that the diffraction peaks increased after H2 treatment, suggesting that the crystallized phase was structurally changed – this is consistent with a previous study showing that bimetallic bonding can be ordered at high temperatures in the H2 environment [22]. To understand this phenomenon, HR-TEM and XAS studies were undertaken to confirm the structural change of the bimetallic nanocatalysts from fcc to fct. 3.1.2 XANES spectra of Ni and Pd K-edge XAS was conducted to confirm the structural change of the bimetallic nanocatalysts from fcc to fct after reductive annealing. A 1:1 atomic ratio sample of Ni to Pd was characterized after reductive treatment at 750 °C. Fig. 2(a) shows XANES spectra of the Ni K-edge for various samples. The absorption edge peak at ~8333 eV is assigned to the electronic transition from 1s to 3d level [23]. The peak positions for all the catalysts are similar to the position of Ni in metal foil. This result indicates that the valence states of Ni in all the catalysts represent the metallic state. While comparing the shape of the white line, the broad white line peak observed in the NiPd catalysts before treatment was separated into distinct and shifted peaks after annealing that is clearly shown – see centrally inserted image. This was not only characteristic of the conversion to an ordered structure, but also characterizes the fct structure [24,25]. These peaks are assigned to electronic transitions from 1s to the unoccupied final states that originate from the hybridized 4s, 4p, and 3d levels. The separated peaks depend strongly on the extent of alloying of Ni with Pd, and reflect a population rearrangement between the electronic levels associated with these two transitions. The normalized Pd K-edge XANES spectra of Pd050Ni050, before and after reductive treatment, are shown in Fig. 2(b). The absorption edge peak at around 24,350 eV is assigned to the electronic transition from the 1s to 4d level [26]. The pre-edge peak positions for all the catalysts, before and after reductive treatment, remained the same with respect to the position of the Pd metal foil. The spectra indicate that the valence state of Pd in all the catalysts subjected to XAS measurements were in the metallic state. The intensity of the peaks at the Pd K-edge is in the order Pd foil > fcc-Pd050Ni050 > fct-Pd050Ni050. However, the opposite trend i.e. Ni foil < fcc-Pd050Ni050 < fct-Pd050Ni050 was observed. This observation could be an indication that the electronic interactions between Ni and Pd lead to more filling in the Pd electronic level. It was also found that the electronic effect was stronger in fct-Pd050Ni050 compared to fcc-Pd050Ni050, due to a higher extent of alloying and/or heterometallic bonding. 3.1.3 EXAFS of Ni and Pd K-edge Analysis of the FT-EXAFS of the Ni K-edge and Pd K-edge are shown in Fig. 3 (a-b). EXAFS spectra indicate that the initially disordered Pd050Ni050 alloys underwent structural transformation after reductive thermal annealing. The Ni K-edge spectra show two peaks between 2 and 3 Å, the first at ~2.2 Å was assigned to NiNi homometallic bonding, while the second at ~2.7 Å was assigned to NiPd heterometallic bonding. Similar to PdPd homometallic bonding, a peak appears at ~3 Å, while another appears at ~2.7 Å attributed to PdNi heterometallic bonding. After reductive treatment, NiPd and PdNi heterometallic bonding became prominent with an obviously higher intensity. The additional contribution from NiPd heterometallic bonding indicates successful chemical rearrangement after hydrogen treatment. The peak intensity qualitatively indicates the coordination number, i.e. higher intensities indicate higher coordination numbers. In this case the increase in FT magnitude at the Ni K- and Pd K-edges after hydrogen treatment indicates an increase in the ordering of the PdNi in the catalyst. The extent of alloying in the samples can be estimated from J Pd and J Ni [18]. The extent of ordering in the alloyed samples is summarized in Table. 1 , while evidence for alloying extent (and therefore ordering) in Ni k-space and Pd k-space are shown in Fig. 4 . The lower frequency components dominate PdNi alloyed bonding in the second shell. As shown in Fig. 4, fct-Pd050Ni050 has a lower frequency than fcc-Pd050Ni050, suggesting the formation of more ordered alloying in the catalyst's core structure, or fct phase, by hydrogen treatment. (See Figs. S6 and S7 in the SI). 3.1.4 TEM Fig. 5 shows transmission electron microscopy images of the fct-Pd050Ni050 catalyst. Fig. 5(a) shows the dispersion of the catalyst to be uniform. The average diameter of the PdNi nanoparticles is ~20 nm. The average grain size of the catalysts (18.5 nm with a standard deviation of ±4.0 nm) was estimated using Ganta software, see Fig. 5(d). This is in good agreement with the grain size as determined by XRD. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 5(b) shows that the fct-Pd050Ni050 nanoparticles have multiple facets. The Bragg planes with lattice spacings of 2.1 Å, 1.9 Å and 1.3 Å correspond to (111), (200) and (220), respectively – see magnified image Fig. 5(c) taken from the area outlined by a red rectangle in Fig. 5(b). Slightly larger particles (5 nm), which also revealed the fct-Pd050Ni050 crystals' atomic arrangements, were identified in the superlattice structure as an ordered phase alloy. A Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) filter function was applied to show the atomic rearrangement in the alloying phase and the confirmatory presence of rings corresponding to (001), (110) ordered reflections in the fct structure (Fig. 5(e)). The results match well with the superlattice interplanar SAED pattern shown in Fig. 5(f). The fct-Pd050Ni050 catalyst's interplanar distances were also identified from selective area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. These results all provide evidence for the observed structural rearrangement into fct-Pd050Ni050 nanoparticles after annealing in a hydrogen environment at a high temperature."
7,In situ detection of hydrogen peroxide production,"3.2 In situ detection of hydrogen peroxide production Hydrogen peroxide is commonly detected by titration; however, the kinetics of such reactions are not easy to follow. In this work, the hydrogen peroxide produced from a two-electron pathway on the slurry catalysts was detected in situ on a glassy carbon working electrode in a three-electrode cell (Fig. S8). It was found that the electrochemical production of H2O2 was strongly correlated with the current and required potential in the two-electron pathway of the oxygen reduction reaction, thus the concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced in acid solution could be estimated from the measured current response, whose relationship to the concentration was initially established from the calibration curves shown in Fig. S9. The set potential, 0.8 V vs. SCE was chosen (within the range 0.75–0.85 V) to give the highest coefficient of determination (see Fig. S10 in the SI). As described in the experimental section, the calibration curve was made at the set potential and is in good agreement with the work of S. Siahrostami et al. (see Fig. S11 in the SI) [27,28]. A linear fitting curve showing the relationship between measured current and H2O2 concentration is shown in Fig. 6(a). From the regression equation, the hydrogen peroxide produced in acid solution under O2/Ar: 5% H2 (1:1) can be detected and quantified in situ from the LSV measured current. The performance of different catalysts can then be assessed, see Figs. S12 and S13 (SI). The production of H2O2 with various catalysts is compared in Fig. 6(b), which clearly shows an enhanced H2O2 production trend going from Pd/C to fcc-Pd050Ni050 to fct-Pd050Ni050. Most interestingly, the production rate of fcc-Pd050Ni050 was much lower than that of fct-Pd050Ni050, which was found to have a productivity of 862.64 mol kg−1 h−1, a value four times higher than the typical values reported in the literature, e.g. 212 mol kg−1 h−1 [14]. However, H2O2 production slightly decreased with increasing reaction times. The durability of used fct-Pd050Ni050 nanocatalyst was also tested, see the LSV scans in Fig. S13 which decrease slightly, possibly indicating the dissolution of surface Ni atoms during prolonged operation."
8,Conclusions,"We demonstrated a novel method to increase the activity (almost 4-fold) of fct-Pd050Ni050 nanocatalysts towards the direct production of hydrogen peroxide by converting the intrinsic face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to the face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure using a thermally reductive treatment. This approach, which synergistically alloys active Pd with Ni, leads to the enhancement of heterometallic bonding, resulting in a superior performance compared to monometallic Pd. The method offers an important new route towards the direct and green synthesis of H2O2. The preformed starting fcc-Pd050Ni050 alloys were prepared using a mesoporous SBA-15 template. As-prepared fcc-Pd050Ni050 was successfully turned into fct-Pd050Ni050 nanocatalysts, which showed the highest productivity for the direct formation of H2O2 among all reported values, both in this study and in the currently published literature."
