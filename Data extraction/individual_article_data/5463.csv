0,Introduction,"ALD is induced by the chronic and excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages, which has been considered to comprise three main stages, including steatosis, alcohol hepatitis and chronic hepatitis with progressive fibrosis or cirrhosis, and these stages may sometimes coexist in one individual (Masarone et al., 2016). Among all liver diseases, alcoholic liver cirrhosis and other ALDs represent the larger part, but it is difficult to exactly know the global burden of ALD (Masarone et al., 2016). According to the demonstration in 2010 Global Burden of Diseases Reports, in the worldwide, about 47.9% of all liver cirrhosis deaths were attributable to alcohol, and mortality from alcoholic liver cirrhosis was of 7.2 per 100.000 inhabitants (Lozano et al., 2013). In China, due to increased frequency of drinking and the increase of dietary fat intake, the incidence of ALD has increased, becoming another important risk factor in addition to viral hepatitis (Ramirez et al., 2017). Alcohol is primarily metabolized in the liver through three enzymatic pathways: ADH, ALDH and CYP2E1. Excessive alcohol consumption leads to the accumulation of the highly toxic acetaldehyde which may damage membrane lipids and alter enzyme activities (Salaspuro et al., 1981). Although the progression of liver injury induced by alcohol is a multifactorial event that involves genetic and environmental factors, the oxidative stress has been reported to play an essential role in ALD (Kono et al., 2000). The alcohol exposure may damage liver enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms which may protect cells from toxicity of reactive oxygen species (Wu and Cederbaum, 2003). Accumulating evidence has proposed that mitochondrial injury connected with cell apoptosis is responsible for the progression of ALD (Stewart et al., 2001; Yan et al., 2007), and both release of cytochrome c and caspase activation has been demonstrated to be involved in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Susin et al., 1998). FDP, a glycolytic intermediate, has been reported to attenuate tissue injury associated with ischemia and shock via promoting the anaerobic carbohydrate utilization and decreasing oxygen-free-radical generation in neutrophils (Didlake et al., 1989; Farias et al., 1990; Karaça et al., 2002). FDP also can activate the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for anaerobic ATP production (Kelleher et al., 1995). Since FDP was found to maintain cellular levels of glutathione and catalase in addition to upregulating the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of PPP, it is likely that FDP suppresses oxidative stress through PPP activation (Ahn et al., 2002). Recently, it has been reported that FDP can decrease oxidative stress by limiting free radical production and improving antioxidant systems (Alva et al., 2016). Here we showed protective effect of FDP on mice against alcohol-induced acute liver injury and probed the possible mechanism."

2,"Chemicals, assay kits and antibodies","2.1 Chemicals, assay kits and antibodies Commercial assay kits for activities of ALT, AST, SOD, GSH-PX, CAT, GR and ADH, and assay kits for MDA, GSH and TG level detection were purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Jiangsu, China). Ethyl alcohol was from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. (Guangdong, China). Polyclonal antibody against pro-caspase3 was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). PARP antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, USA). Monoclonal antibody to β-actin and all secondary antibodies were purchased from Bioworld Biotechnology (Jiangsu, China). FDP was purchased from Shanghai Hanhong Scientific Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China)."
3,Animals and experimental design,"2.2 Animals and experimental design Male ICR mice（6–7 weeks, 18–22g）were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. And all mice received human care in strict accordance with the requirements of Provisions and General Recommendation of Chinese Experimental Animals Administration Legislation and were approved by Science and Technology Department of Jiangsu Province. After 2–3 days acclimatization to standard laboratory conditions, mice were randomly divided into five groups (eight mice/group) as follows. Mice in Group Ⅰ (served as normal control) were orally administered with sterile distilled water only during the experimental period. Group Ⅱ was the model group, in which mice were given sterile distilled water orally and followed by administration of ethanol (50%, v/v, 12ml/kg) by gavage after 1h. Mice in groups Ⅲ, Ⅳ and Ⅴ were orally administered with FDP at 62.5, 125 and 250mg/kg respectively and then received alcohol (50%, v/v, 12ml/kg) challenge. The whole blood of mice was collected by retroorbital bleeding 6h after ethanol administration and sera were obtained by centrifugation (1750g, 15min, 4℃) for measuring the activities of ALT and AST, and level of TG. The livers were removed quickly for detecting hepatic level of MDA and GSH as well as activities of antioxidant enzymes. To observe the effect of FDP on alcohol-induced histological changes, mice were administrated with ethanol (50%, v/v, 12ml/kg/day) for seven days and FDP was given to mice 1h before alcohol treatment. During this process the mouse body weight was monitored，and at end of the treatment，the weight of organs were measured and the livers were collected for histological observation. Meanwhile, the content of alcohol in mouse blood was detected by gas chromatography 30, 90 and 180min after the last administration of ethanol."
4,"Measurement of serum activities of ALT and AST, and level of TG","2.3 Measurement of serum activities of ALT and AST, and level of TG Activities of ALT and AST and the level of TG in mouse sera were detected spectrophotometrically using the commercial assay kits in accordance with the manufacture's protocols. The absorbance values were determined at corresponding wavelength with an Elx 800 Universal Microplate Reader (BIO-TEK, INC)."
5,"Determination of the activities of antioxidant and alcohol metabolic enzymes, and lipid peroxidation","2.4 Determination of the activities of antioxidant and alcohol metabolic enzymes, and lipid peroxidation Liver tissues were homogenized in cold 0.9% NaCl solution and were centrifuged (1000g, 15min, 4℃). The supernatants were prepared for the further detection. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, CAT, GR, GSH-PX and ADH, and the level of GSH were determined spectrophotometrically by using the commercial assay kits according to the instructions supplied by manufacturer. Lipid peroxidation in liver was determined spectrophotometrically through measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) using the detection kits in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols, and expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. The level of ALDH in mouse liver homogenate was determined according to the standard procedures of the commercial ELISA kits (Threebio Technology, China)."
6,Cell culture and viability assay,"2.5 Cell culture and viability assay The human hepatic cell strain, L02 obtained from Key GEN Bio TECH Corp., Ltd (Jiangsu, China), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100U/ml penicillin and 100μg/ml streptomycin), in a 5% CO2 humidified environment at 37℃. For cell viability assay，L02 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5×103 cells / well 24h before treatment. The cell viability was determined using the MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl)−2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] commercial assay kit. Briefly, 10μl (5mg/ml）MTT working solution was added to each well, and after 4h, the supernatant was removed and 200μl of dimethylsulfoxide（DMSO）was added to dissolve the crystals. Absorbance of each well was detected at 570nm using an Elx 808 Universal Microplate Reader (BIO-TEK, INC)."
7,Flow cytometric analysis,"2.6 Flow cytometric analysis The apoptosis of L02 cells was evaluated through using the Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit (Vazyme Biotech, China). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifuge and washed with PBS, and then were resuspended in 100μl binding buffer followed by incubation with 5μl Annexin V-FITC and 5μl PI for 15min at room temperature in the dark. After adding 400μl binding buffer, the apoptotic cells were assessed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA)."
8,Western blot analyses,"2.7 Western blot analyses Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in the lysis buffer for 30min and then were centrifugated (15,000g, 4℃, 15min). Equal amounts of the soluble protein were denatured by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After being washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 5min and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS for 1h, the membrane was incubated with matched primary antibodies for 18h at 4℃ followed by incubating with the secondary antibodies. The antibody–antigen complexes were visualized by the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and the blot quantification was performed by using the LI-COR Odyssey analysis software."
9,Histological and immunohistochemical analysis,"2.8 Histological and immunohistochemical analysis The mouse livers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by embedding in paraffin. Sections of 3µm thickness were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) or oil red O according the regular staining protocol. The results were evaluated by observing every section under a microscope (OLYMPUS CKX41, Japan). The ethanol induced hepatic injury was graded according to the previous report (Zhao et al., 2017). Grade 0 (no pathological change), grade 1 (minimal hepatocyte necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate), grade 2 (mild), grade 3 (moderate), grade 4 (severe inflammatory cells infiltration). For immunohistochemistry, the paraffin embed liver sections were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in graded alcohol and water subsequently. After blocking with Bull Serum Albumin (BSA), sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against CYP2E1 (Boster Biotechnology, China) overnight at 4°C and were stained using a polymer HRP detection system. The sections were developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution and counterstained with hematoxylin. The protein level of CYP2E1 in livers were measured semi-quantitatively by detecting total CYP2E1 positive area under the Nikon E2000 microscope with Image-Pro Plus image analysis software."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis The experimental data were presented as mean ± S.D. from replicate experiments. The statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism5 software. Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance was defined as P < 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001."
11,Results,
12,Effect of FDP on alcohol-induced hepatic injury,"3.1 Effect of FDP on alcohol-induced hepatic injury The early acute hepatic injury was signified by increased serum activities of both ALT and AST and level of TG (Zhao et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 1A–C, ethanol remarkably elevated serum activities of both ALT and AST, and serum TG level. FDP administration dose-dependently inhibited ethanol-induced changes of serum activities of ALT and AST, as well as TG level. Histopathological observations also provided important evidences consisting with above results. As shown in Fig. 1D and ( Table 1), liver sections from the control group preserved the integrity of liver cell structure with neatly arranged hepatocytes. The architecture of the liver lobule and sinusoid were clear, and no obvious inflammatory cells and swelling cells existed. Whereas, alcohol stimulated mice expressed an apparent injury in livers, including the disorders of hepatic sinuses and lobules, hepatocyte necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltrate and hepatic steatosis. FDP pre-administered to mice markedly attenuated the alcohol-induced histopathological changes. Oil red O staining was performed to examine lipid droplets in the mouse liver. Fig. 1E showed that alcohol intake induced a significant lipid droplet accumulation, and FDP remarkably reduced the number of lipid droplets. All these results indicated that FDP protected mice against alcohol -induced hepatic injury. During seven days of the alcohol intake, the body weight gain of mice remarkably decreased, whereas FDP inhibited alcohol-induced reduce of body weight gain (Fig. 1F). In addition, the organ/body weight ratio did not been affected by alcohol and FDP beside the kidney (Fig. 1G)."
13,Effect of FDP on alcohol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis,"3.2 Effect of FDP on alcohol-induced hepatocyte apoptosis Since above in vivo study demonstrated the protective effect of FDP against alcohol-induced liver injury, we next performed in vitro experiments to evaluate the effects of FDP on alcohol-induced hepatocyte death. MTT detection showed that FDP alone, even at a concentration of 250μM, did not obviously alter L02 cell (human liver cell strand) viability ( Fig. 2A), whereas ethanol does-dependently decreased L02 cell viability (Fig. 2B). When cells were pre-treated with FDP and then exposed to ethanol, the decrease of cell viability induced by ethanol was suppressed, indicating that FDP protected L02 cells against alcohol-induced cell toxicity (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the protection of FDP to hepatocytes, we examined apoptosis of L02 cells by applying a flow cytometric analysis and found that ethanol induced an apparent increase of apoptotic cells, whereas FDP significantly inhibited alcohol-triggered L02 cell apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Caspase3, apoptosis-related cysteine protease, is involved in the cleavage of many apoptosis related proteins. The cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the early stage of apoptosis is one of the most utilized diagnostics for apoptosis determination (Koh et al., 2005). As shown in Fig. 2E-F, the protein of PARP were cleaved and pro-caspase3 was downregulated in L02 cells after 400mM ethanol treatment and 100μM FDP significantly inhibited ethanol-induced activation of both caspase3 and PARP. All these data suggested that FDP inhibited alcohol -induced apoptosis."
14,Effect of FDP on alcohol-induced oxidative stress,"3.3 Effect of FDP on alcohol-induced oxidative stress The oxidative stress is one of the important causes for alcohol-induced liver injury. MDA, a lipid peroxidation, was apparently higher in the liver tissue in alcohol-treated mice than that in the control group ( Fig. 3A). FDP, pretreated to mice, remarkably attenuated alcohol-induced increasing of MDA in mouse liver, indicating that FDP inhibited alcohol-induced increase of lipid peroxidation. Alcohol also impaired liver antioxidant system, which indicated as the decrease of activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems. GSH, a non-enzymatic antioxidant in normal livers, can alleviate oxidative stress by removing free radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation (Hsu et al., 2010; Blair, 2006). Compared with the control group, the ethanol treated group showed a significant reduction of GSH level in mouse livers. Administration of FDP to mice apparently suppressed alcohol-induced reduction of GSH level (Fig. 3B). It is well known that antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, and GR, play an important role in the cellular defense against oxidative stress. The hepatic SOD, CAT, GR and GSH-Px activities decreased significantly in alcohol-treated mice compared with control one, but when mice were pre-administrated with FDP and then were fed with ethanol, the decrease of activities of SOD, CAT, GR and GSH-Px induced by ethanol was prevented (Fig. 3C–F). To evaluate whether FDP can maintain the antioxidant status in ethanol-treated L02 cells, we detected GSH level and SOD activity in cells. As shown in (Fig. 3G–H), ethanol (400mM) decreased GSH level and SOD activity apparently, and FDP dose-dependently inhibited ethanol-induced reduction of both GSH level and SOD activity."
15,Effect of FDP on alcohol metabolic enzymes,"3.4 Effect of FDP on alcohol metabolic enzymes To evaluate the effect of FDP on alcohol metabolic rate in mice, we fed mice with ethanol (50%, v/v, 12ml/kg/day) by gavage for seven days and 250mg/kg FDP were administrated to mice 1h after ethanol intake. Blood ethanol concentration of mice was detected at 30, 90 and 180min after the last ethanol treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, the alcohol metabolic rate significantly increased in FDP treated mice suggesting FDP promoted alcohol metabolism. Alcohol is mainly metabolized in the liver through three major pathways including ADH, ALDH, and the microsomal alcohol oxidizing system. In the present study, mouse hepatic ADH activity and the level of ALDH reduced after ethanol treatment. Whereas, pre-treating mice with FDP (62.5, 125 and 250mg/kg) prevented this alteration (Fig. 4B and C). Immunohistochemistry staining analysis was performed to examine the expression of hepatic CYP2E1 protein. As shown in Fig. 4D, ethanol resulted in an induction of CYP2E1 protein and this increase of CYP2E1 was inhibited by FDP dose-dependently. These results indicated that FDP protected mice against the disorder of alcohol metabolism induced by excessive alcohol intake."
16,Discussion,"Excessive alcohol consumption is an important public health problem that contributes substantially to the global burden of mortality and morbidity. ALD can be induced by excessive consumption of alcohol, which is comprised a spectrum of clinical signs and morphological changes with 5.9% of deaths worldwide (Gonçalves et al., 2017; Mathurin et al., 2002; Purohit and Brenner, 2006). Up till now, only a few researches were conducted on ALD patients and the effective therapies for ALD are still limited (Milosevic et al., 2016). Some natural products have been studied for the treatment of ALD, and among them, silymarin, glycyrrhizin and garlic have shown the promising results in ALD patients while green tee, quercetin and curcumin have demonstrated beneficial effects on patients with ALD (Milosevic et al., 2016). FDP has displayed the hepatoprotective effects on galactosamine and acetaminophen-induced liver injury in animals (Markov et al., 1991; Mihas et al., 2002). In the present study, we showed that FDP possessed the hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced mouse liver injury. Different from those natural products from herbs, FDP is a physiological product in human bodies while exhibits pharmacological properties. FDP has been used as a clinical drug for treating myocardial ischemia, acute lung injury, hypoxic brain injury and ischemic acute renal failure for two decades (Ma et al., 2011). Furthermore, FDP presents good tolerance that would be an advantage for long-term use (Wang et al., 2009). The results of our study demonstrated that acute alcohol administration to mice injured hepatocytes seriously, which was evidenced by masses of intracellular enzymes, such as AST and ALT, leaking into blood. FDP inhibited the elevation of serum activities of ALT and AST in alcohol-intoxicated mice. Besides, our further histological observations demonstrated that continuous alcoholic intake for seven days induced the apparent pathological changes of hepatic structures, whereas, FDP suppressed these pathological changes. These results strongly indicated the protective effect of FDP against alcohol-induced liver injury. So far, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of ALD remain unclear. Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are well known as a major mechanism leading to hepatic injury induced by alcohol (Di Luzio and Hartman, 1967; Kannan et al., 2004). ALD starts with hepatic steatosis, which is characterized by an increase in intrahepatic TG (Mihas et al., 2002). We found that FDP significantly inhibited alcohol-induced increase of serum TG suggesting that FDP could promote lipo metabolism and decrease fat accumulation in liver. The advanced ALD is characterized histologically by evidence of hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis (Stewart et al., 2001), which has been reported as an important feature of human ALD encountered in most chronic alcoholics in clinical practices (Gao and Bataller, 2011). In alcohol-induced liver injury, both mitochondrial damage and ER stress are two most important apoptotic pathways (Canbay et al., 2004; Guicciardi and Gores, 2005; Wang et al., 2006). In current study, we found that FDP attenuated ethanol-induced L02 cell apoptosis and inhibited caspase3 activation and PARP cleavage suggesting FDP protected hepatocytes against mitochondrial-mediated and caspase-dependent apoptosis triggered by ethanol. It has been well documented that alcohol metabolism alters the intracellular redox state (Bae et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2007). At the cellular level, oxidative stress can result in severe metabolic dysfunction, including protein oxidation, membrane disruption, and DNA damage (Farshori et al., 2015). It has been reported that FDP could recover the cardio-vascular function of anesthetized rats exposed to oxidative stress through effectively limiting the extension of lipid peroxidation and increasing antioxidant activity (Gámez et al., 2008). MDA, the end-product of lipid peroxidation, has been widely used as a marker for the status of oxidative stress and a prominent manifestation of ROS and alcohol-induced liver injury is considered to be associated with increased lipid peroxidation and lipid radical (Del Rio et al., 2005; Tomofuji et al., 2008). Thus it is not surprised that FDP significantly inhibited alcohol-increased MDA level in the mouse liver. GSH acts as a non-enzymatic antioxidant by directly interacting with ROS through its sulfhydryl group or as a cofactor or coenzyme involved in the enzymatic detoxification of ROS (Townsend et al., 2003). Notably, our results demonstrated that FDP prevented alcohol-induced GSH depletion in mouse liver. In addition to GSH, the antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, GR, GSH-PX and CAT also take important roles in hepatic antioxidant systems. SOD scavenges ROS through catalyzing the conversion of the superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (You et al., 2014). GR，also known as GSH reductase, converts GSSG to reduced GSH. GSH-PX, existed both in cytosol and mitochondria of the hepatocytes, can reduce fatty acid hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide in presence of GSH (Imai et al., 1998). CAT mainly presents in the peroxisomes of mammalian cells, and catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen (Scibior and Czeczot, 2006). As similar as previous reports, our experiments showed that the acute alcohol exposure impaired the functions of SOD, GR, GSH-PX and CAT in mouse liver. FDP dramatically inhibited alcohol-induced reduction in activities of SOD, GR, GSH-PX and CAT. Consistently, FDP also suppressed ethanol-induced decrease of both GSH level and SOD activity in L02 cells. These findings strongly suggest that the hepatoprotective effect of FDP is related with its antioxidant activities. Two important enzymes are involved in alcohol metabolism. Alcohol is first metabolized to acetaldehyde by ADH, and then to acetic acid by ALDH. Acetaldehyde, a major metabolic product of alcohol, is a very reactive intermediate that has been considered as a pathogenic factor in ALD (Sung et al., 2012). Acetaldehyde induces the activation of hepatic stellate cells, which directly contributes to hepatic fibrosis independent of hepatocyte injury (Kaplowitz, 2006; Svegliati-Baroni et al., 2005). The ADH activity in livers changes dose and time dependently in respond to acute alcohol intoxication and governs the elimination rate of blood ethanol (Haseba et al., 2003). In our study, FDP treatment significantly inhibited ethanol-induced reduction of ADH activity and the reduction of ALDH level in the mouse liver. More important, FDP reduced serum alcohol level in mice administrated with alcohol. These data strongly suggest that FDP could promote alcohol metabolism through enhancing ADH activity and increasing ALDH protein level. On the other hand, alcohol intake increases the expression and activity of CYP2E1, which then accelerates the metabolism of excessive alcohol and results in the generation of ROS (Lu et al., 2008; Sheweita, 2000). Our study demonstrated that ethanol increased hepatic CYP2E1 level, and FDP significantly suppressed CYP2E1 expression induced by ethanol. In summary, both our in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that FDP protects mice against alcohol toxicity to mouse livers. In detail, FDP prevents alcohol-induced reduction of antioxidative capacity of mouse livers and promotes alcohol metabolism."
