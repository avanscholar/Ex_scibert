0,Introduction,"The search for alternative methods of producing petrol without using expensive and non-renewable crude oil or natural gas has become an intense topic of research. Catalyzed hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) offers such an alternative for the production of renewable fuels and other fine chemicals. Specifically, the LA hydrogenation intermediate product, GVL is stable and many useful products such as fuel components, polymers, plasticizers, food additives and other fine chemicals can be derived from it [1–4]. Additionally, GVL has been perceived as potential replacement for ethanol in gasoline-ethanol blends because of their better lubricity, higher boiling points and low solubility in water [5]. The GVL can also be hydrogenated further to give other useful products such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) through the formation of 1,4-pentanediol (PD) intermediate [3]. Because LA itself is obtained from lignocellulosic biomass [6,7] derived from grass and other wastes from the agricultural sector (e.g. corn stover, wheat straw) [8], it presents a very promising alternative for the production of renewable fuels. This satisfies one of the requirements by green chemistry becuase it reduces the CO2 emission to the environment as the carbon produced by biomass form CO2 upon reacting with oxygen, which is subsequently used by plants during photosynthesis. Studies on mono- and bimetallic catalyzed hydrogenation of LA to GVL have previously been reported [2,9–15]. Yang et al. recently reported the hydrogenation of LA to GVL over mesoporous carbon supported bimetallic Ru/Ni catalysts [14]. Additionally, metal-based catalyzed hydrogenation of LA to GVL, MTHF and other products has been reviewed [15,16]. The catalytic investigation of commercial TiO2 (P-25) supported Ru catalyst in the LA hydrogenation was recently reported in Weckhuysen’s laboratory [3]. However, their catalysts were prepared using wet-impregnation method which involves the use of acids and elevated temperature (100°C). In another related study, Ruppert et al. reported on the influence of support on Ru and Pt supported on mixed TiO2 phases catalysts [17]. The activity of Pt was found to increase as the surface area of anatase phase TiO2 was increased. In case of Ru, the activity was improved by avoiding the formation of RuO2 during catalyst preparation and using support that exhibit mesoporosity as opposed to microporosity. Transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been discovered to possess excellent catalytic activity for many industrial related reactions, such as CC coupling [18] oxidation of alcohols [19], epoxidation of alkenes [20] and hydrogenation reactions [21,22] as compared to their bulk counterparts. However, their catalytic application in the chemical industry as colloidal NPs has always been challenging due to a number of reasons. Often colloidal NPs tend to form inactive aggregates during the reaction, particularly at elevated temperatures. This is due to low thermal stability possessed by colloidal NPs. Moreover, it is also difficult to separate them from the reaction products and consequently, their recyclability is difficult and can involve processes that are costly. As a result, the application of unsupported colloidal NPs in the chemical industry is limited because of the costs involved. However, these drawbacks can be overcome by immobilization of colloidal NPs onto mesoporous solid supports to fabricate what is commonly referred to as heterogeneous catalysts. Although heterogeneous catalysts have been preferred over homogeneous in most industrial applications, mainly because of their ease of separation from reaction products, as well as their thermal stability, they too have their drawbacks such as catalyst leaching, sintering, deactivation and mass transport limitations. For heterogeneous catalysts to be more efficient, the interaction between the support and the nanoparticles must be good. This can be achieved by either using a stabilizer (used for NP synthesis) that strongly interacts with the potential support or subsequent immobilization of preformed NPs within mesoporous support materials of well-defined pores. This work will focus on the latter approach. First discovered by Tomalia [23] and Newkome [24] and their co-workers, dendrimers have since been used as templates/stabilizers for the synthesis metallo-dendrimer catalysts or TM nanoparticles with a good mono-dispersity and narrow size distribution [21,25,26]. In the case of metallo-dendrimer catalysts, the active metal is either coordinated to the core, branches or peripheral groups of the dendrimer [27]. Alternatively, the metal ions can be coordinated to the tertiary amine groups within the dendrimer and subsequently reduced to form nanoparticles within the cavities of the dendrimer, i.e. dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) or dendrimer-stabilized nanoparticles (DSNs). Additionally, it is possible to prepare nanoparticles of different sizes by simply varying the dendrimer to metal mole ratio. Advantages of using dendrimers as catalyst stabilizers as compared to other stabilizers such as polymers are discussed elsewhere [25]. However, among reported DENs, the synthesis and catalytic activity of Ru-DENs have not yet been extensively explored [28–32]. In this work, the prepared supported Pt- and Ru-DEN catalysts were evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of LA to produce GVL. Catalytic activity of dendrimer-derived supported Ru- and Pt catalysts has previously been investigated in different hydrogenation reactions [33,34]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the evaluation of dendrimer-derived supported Ru and Pt NPs in the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. Based on these previous reports on the hydrogenation of LA to GVL, we envisioned to employ stable mesoporous titania and silica supported catalysts derived from the dendrimer template. Other systems using noble and non-noble materials have been reported in the LA hydrogenation of LA to GVL [13,35–39]. However, the catalysts for these systems involves the use of high metal loading, broad size distribution catalysts (as opposed to the one reported here), which often lead to catalyst leaching during reaction. In some instances, higher temperature and pressure were used for these previously reported systems. Moreover, the synthesis of small-sized non-noble dendrimer encapsulated nanoparticles has proved to be challenging [25], hence Ru and Pt were chosen for this present study. Because NPs synthesized using dendrimers are normally small-sized (<5nm) and have high surface area, it would be easy for them to diffuse inside the mesoporous supports materials. In that way, the stability and activity of the catalysts can be enhanced."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Generation 4 hydroxyl-terminated dendrimers (G4-OH PAMAM) (9.93wt% in methanol, Dendritech), RuCl3·xH2O (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), K2PtCl4 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), NaBH4 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), deionized water (in house Milli-Q system) were all used for the synthesis of Ru- and Pt-DENs. Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (P123) (Sigma-Aldrich), 1-butanol (99.5%, Rochelle Chemicals), ethanol (95%, Sigma-Aldrich) and HNO3 (Rochelle Chemicals) were used as reagents for the synthesis of mesoporous materials (Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2). Titanium isopropoxide (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and were used as metal oxide precursors for the synthesis of Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2, respectively. Levulinic acid (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a model hydrogenation substrate. γ-Valerolactone (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1,4- pentanediol, were used as GC standards. 1,4-Dioxane (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a solvent for the hydrogenation reaction. Anisole (99.9%, Fluka) was used as an internal standard. pH measurements were performed using an ORION model520A and Schott pH electrode blueline 25. Nanoparticles were purified using a dialysis membrane (10000 MWCO) purchased from Thermo Scientific."
3,Synthesis of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs,"2.2 Synthesis of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs The synthesis of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs was performed as previously reported [29,31]. Specifically, G4-OH PAMAM dendrimer solution (9.93wt% in MeOH, 0.0283g, 0.200μmol) was transferred into a Schlenk tube (50mL). The in vacuo removal of methanol solvent was then performed. The dendrimer was diluted with de-ionized water (19.760mL) to obtain a final dendrimer concentration of 10μM. The deionized water used throughout the entire synthesis procedure was degassed by bubbling N2 gas for 30min prior to use. To this aqueous dendrimer solution, 40 molar excess of aqueous solution of RuCl3 or K2PtCl4 salt (80μL, 0.1M, 8μmol) was added with stirring under inert (nitrogen) atmosphere. The dendrimer/metal complex was allowed to stir for 72h under inert conditions. The lengthy stirring period was necessary to allow complexation between the dendrimer and the metal ions to occur [40]. The reduction of this metallo-dendrimer complex was carried out by addition 4×40μL of freshly prepared aqueous NaBH4 solution (0.5M, 0.86μmol) every 10min over a period of 40min. The molar excess of NaBH4 relative to the metal ions used for this synthesis was 10:1 for both Ru40- and Pt40-DENs. The reaction was left to stir for 24h under inert atmosphere to allow complete reduction to occur and subsequent formation of Ru40- or Pt40-DENs. It is noteworthy to mention that Ru40- and Pt40-DENs are used to denote the dendrimer to metal ion molar ratio (1:40) used during the synthesis and do not in any way imply the exact number of metal atoms of a single nanoparticle. The resulting DENs were purified by dialysis against deionized water (3×1L) for 6h prior to catalytic reactions or immobilization onto mesoporous supports."
4,Synthesis of mesoporous support materials,"2.3 Synthesis of mesoporous support materials The synthesis of mesoporous materials was carried out using a method previously reported in the literature [41]. Mesoporous titania and silica prepared will be denoted as Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2, respectively throughout. For synthesis of Meso-TiO2 : P123 (2g, 3.4×10−4 mol), HNO3 (2g, 3.2×10−2 mol) and 1-butanol (14g, 1.9×10−1 mol) were allowed to mix by magnetic stirring at room temperature in a beaker (400mL) until everything has dissolved. To this mixture, titanium isopropoxide (6.3g, 2.0×10−2 mol) was added and the mixture was allowed to stir until a gel formed. The beaker was then placed inside a furnace and heated at 120°C for 6h. The obtained yellow film was ground and subsequently washed with ethanol (3 portions of 10mL) followed by drying in a vacuum oven overnight at 90°C. The powder was subsequently calcined at different temperatures (150, 250, 350 and 450°C) for 4h at a heating rate of 1°C/min. For the synthesis of Meso-SiO2 : P123 (2.4g, 4.1×10−4 mol), HNO3 (2.3g, 3.7×10−2 mol) and 1-butanol (16g, 2.2×10−1 mol) were stirred (magnetic stirrer) at room temperature in a beaker (400mL) until everything has dissolved. To this mixture, TEOS (5g, 2.4×10−2 mol) was added and allowed to mix with the solution in the beaker. After the gel had formed, the beaker was placed inside a furnace and heated at 120°C for 6h. The resulting transparent yellow film was ground into a powder and washed with ethanol, and left drying in a vacuum oven overnight at 90°C. The powder was calcined at different temperatures (150, 250, 350 and 450°C) for 4h at a heating rate of 1°C/min."
5,Immobilization of Ru40- or Pt40-DENs catalysts onto mesoporous support materials,"2.4 Immobilization of Ru40- or Pt40-DENs catalysts onto mesoporous support materials Supported DEN catalysts were prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of DEN catalyst with Meso-TiO2 or Meso-SiO2 support followed by sonication of the resulting slurry at room temperature for 3h using a digital ultrasonic cleaner (Celsius scientific cc). These supported Ru40- and Pt40-DEN catalysts were separated from the solution by centrifugation (Hermle, Lasec) at 15000rpm for 10min. The supported catalysts were activated by the removal of dendrimer by calcination at 550°C for 3h in air at 1°C/min. Only Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2 calcined at 450°C were used for immobilization of DEN catalysts. The materials calcined at 450C were simply chosen based on their respective large average pore diameters as this would allow for small nanoparticles to easily diffuse within pores during immobilization process. Consequently, this would reduce or prevent metal nanoparticles from leaching during catalytic reaction. Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2 supported Ru40-DEN catalysts will be denoted as Ru40@Meso-TiO2 and Ru40@Meso-SiO2, respectively. Similarly, Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2 supported Pt40-DENs catalysts will be denoted as Pt40@Meso-TiO2 and Pt40@Meso-SiO2 respectively."
6,Catalyst characterization,"2.5 Catalyst characterization UV–vis absorption spectra for colloidal Ru40- and Pt40-DENs characterization were obtained using a 3mL quartz cuvette on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. High resolution transmission microscope (HRTEM) images for aqueous colloidal and supported nanoparticles were obtained and analyzed using a Philips JEOL-Jem 2100 HRTEM at an acceleration voltage of 200kV. Elemental analysis of the materials was carried out using a GatanGIF and an Oxford INCA energy dispersive X-ray analysis system (EDX). Samples for HRTEM were prepared by placing one drop of aqueous DEN solution on a formvar/carbon coated Cu grid (200mesh). Mesoporous supported Ru40- or Pt40-DENs samples were ultrasonically dispersed into ethanol and few drops were drawn from each sample and mounted on a Cu grid and allowed to dry for HRTEM analysis. Particle sizes and distributions were counted and calculated using ImageJ software [13]. Morphology of the materials was confirmed using JEOL-JMS-5600 scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with EDX. Samples were coated with carbon prior to SEM analysis in order to improve the imaging. FTIR analysis for the synthesized mesoporous materials (Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2), Ru40@Meso-TiO2-and Pt40@Meso-SiO2 catalysts were carried out using a Bruker Tensor 27. Samples for FTIR were prepared by mixing the solid support/catalyst sample with appropriate amount of KBr. The samples were then ground into a fine powder and compressed into KBr pellets. Surface area and porosity analyses were performed using a Micromeritics Tristar. Samples were degassed overnight at 90°C with flowing N2 gas prior to analysis. Specific surface area was determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method whereas pore size and pore size distributions were calculated using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method [42]. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were acquired using a Rigaku MiniFlex600 diffractometer (Cu-Kα 40kV, 30mA, λ=1.5406Å). PXRD patterns were collected in the range of 2θ=10–90° for wide angle and 2θ=0.5–10° for low angle and a scan step time of 10min at 25°C. Thermal stability and weight changes of the sample were determined using SDTQ600 (TA instruments) thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) under N2 at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Metal content for supported catalysts was estimated using inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Spectro Arcos ICP-OES FSH 12 instrument. All kinetic data was analyzed using Kinetic Studio software [43]. Figures were drawn using Origin Pro 8.5 [44]."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid,"2.6 Catalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid The hydrogenation of LA to GVL was performed in 1,4-dioxane or H2O as solvent using a 300cm3 Parr stainless steel autoclave fitted with overheard stirrer. Hydrogen pressure of 10bar, a stirring speed of 1500rpm, temperature of 150°C and reaction time of 5h were used unless otherwise stated. Generally, the reaction was performed using LA (0.232g, 2.0mmol), 1,4-dioxane (5g, 5.6×10−2 mol) and 0.1g of the solid catalyst or 0.5 mol% of the DEN catalysts. The reactor was purged 3 times with argon gas before the reaction was heated to the desired temperature and then charged with H2 to 10bar. The argon gas was flushed out of the reactor by purging with H2 three times before the desired amount of H2 is charged into the reactor. After the reaction, the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature followed by the release of H2 gas before the GC sample preparation for analysis. A sample (50μL) from the syringe filtered reaction mixture was diluted with 1.5mL of dichlomethane in a GC vial for GC analysis. Anisole, 2wt% (4×10−5 mol) was used as an internal standard. Separation of the solid catalyst was achieved through centrifugation and filtration. The recovered catalyst was washed with deionized water and ethanol and being dried at 70°C before being reused. Catalytic conversion of LA was monitored using a Shimadzu GC-2010 equipped with ionization detector (FID) using a TRx-5 capillary column (30m length, 0.25mm ID, 0.25μm film thickness). The FID and injection port temperatures were 300°C and 250°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas. Reaction products were confirmed using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC–MS) using an Rxi-5Sil MS capillary column (30m length, 0.25mm ID, 0.25μm film thickness) and injection temperature of 200°C. The interface and ion source temperatures were 300°C and 200°C, respectively. Eqs. (1) and (2) were used for the calculations of conversion and selectivity.

8,Results and discussion,
9,UV–vis characterization of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs,"3.1 UV–vis characterization of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs Prior to other characterization techniques, the synthesis of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs was monitored by UV–vis spectrophotometry. The spectra collected during the synthesis of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs are shown in Fig. 1 . Aqueous solution of G4 PAMAM-OH was observed to have an absorption band around λ 280nm which is attributed to the interior tertiary amine groups within the dendrimer structure [45]. The aqueous RuCl3 solution showed absortion bands at λ 315 and 530nm. When this Ru3+ was allowed to coordinate with the interior tertiary amines within the dendrimer framework for 3days, a new absorbance band around λ 290nm appeared. This is associated with the formation of dendrimer-metal complex. Upon the addition of the freshly prepared reducing agent, NaBH4, the band associated with dendrimer-metal complex dissapears, and a new band at λ 280nm was observed. This band is attributed to the reduction of Ru3+ ions and subsequent formation of Ru40-DENs. Similarly, the aqueous PtCl4 2− solution exhibited an absorption band around λ 218 and 232nm. After the coordination time of 3days between the Pt2+ ions and dendrimer under inert environment, a new band at λ 261nm associated with dendrimer-metal complex was observed. After the addition of the reducing agent, this dendrimer-metal complex band at λ 261nm dissapeared indicating a reduction of Pt2+ ions coordinated to the dendrimer to yield Pt40-DENs. However, it is noteworthy to mention that incomplete reduction of dendrimer-coordinated Pt2+ ions has been observed by other researchers [40,46]. Therefore, it is important to run ICP-OES analysis to determine the accurate Pt concentration after purification by dialysis. Some authors have achieved a complete reduction of dendrimer-Pt2+ precusor by either using multi-step galvanic exchange reaction [47] or by carrying out the coordination of Pt2+ ions to the dendrimer upon heating at 50°C [48]."
10,HRTEM analysis,"3.2 HRTEM analysis 3.2.1 HRTEM analysis of Ru40- and Pt40-DENs The as-prepared DEN catalysts (Ru40- and Pt40-DENs) were characterized and analyzed by HRTEM prior to the immobilization onto mesoporous supports. The average size obtained for Ru40-DENs and Pt40-DENs were 1.2±0.2nm and 1.7±0.3nm, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the HRTEM images as well as the corresponding size histograms for Ru40- and Pt40-DENs catalysts. TEM analysis revealed that both catalysts are well dispersed with a narrow size distribution. However, these average sizes were greater than the theoretical expected values, i.e. 1.0 and 1.1nm for Ru40-DENs and Pt40-DENs respectively. This is attributed to the fact that some ions coordinated on the outer tertiary amine groups of the dendrimer tend to escape from dendrimer cavities during the reduction process. As a consequence, agglomeration of those small particles may result in increased average particle size. 3.2.2 HRTEM analysis of Meso-TiO2, Meso-SiO2 and mesoporous supported nanoparticles (Ru40@Meso-TiO2, Pt40@Meso-TiO2, Ru40@Meso-SiO2 and Pt40@Meso-SiO2) The morphology and crystallinity of the synthesized mesoporous TiO2 and SiO2 were also investiged using TEM analysis. HRTEM images for mesoporous TiO2 and SiO2 are shown in Fig. 3 . After calcination at 450°C, the TiO2 material transformed from armophous to a crystalline phase consisting of both anatase and rutile phase (see Fig. 3A). This was very clear for images taken at higher magnification as shown in the inset of Fig. 3A. This observations were also confirmed by PXRD analysis (Fig. 5A) discussed in Section 3.5. Well-defined cystalline planes of TiO2 were observed after calcination at 450°C. However, in the case of mesoporous SiO2, only a continuous connection of particles was observed (Fig. 3B) and no well-ordered channels were observed as in the case of mesoposous silica (MCM-41 or SBA-15) prepared using a conventional method. Supported nanoparticles (Ru and Pt) were both observed to be well dispersed on the support without any agglomeration after calcination at temperature 550°C to remove the dendrimer template. However, a slight increase in average size from 1.7±0.3nm (prior to immobilization) to 2.0±0.3nm (after immobilization followed by calcination) was observed for Pt supported catalysts. The Ru supported catalyst retained their original size as compared to before immobilization. Fig. 3C–F shows HRTEM images of Ru40-Meso-TiO2, Pt40-TiO2, Ru40@Meso-SiO2 and Pt40@Meso-SiO2."
11,FTIR analysis,"3.3 FTIR analysis FTIR spectroscopy was used to confirm the formation and functional groups of mesoporous SiO2 and TiO2 materials. FTIR spectra of uncalcined and calcined samples for both mesoprous SiO2 and TiO2 are given in Fig. S1 (Supplementary information). Peaks at ν 633cm−1 (TiOTi vibrations) and 1412cm−1 and 1636cm−1 (HOH stretching) are characteristic bands associated with TiO2 [49], while the broad band between ν 3178–3464cm−1 is attributed to the OH stretching. This is attributed to the presence of moisture in the sample. A CO stretching viration arising from P123 surfacant was observed at ν 1088cm−1 prior to calcination. After calcination at 450°C, the peak initially positioned at ν 1088cm−1 completely dissapeared, indicating the removal of the template (P123) used during the synthesis. For Meso-SiO2, the existance of SiOSi and SiOH stretching were confirmed by vibration bands around ν 812cm−1, 1080cm−1 and 1386cm−1 [50,51]. The observed absorption bands around ν 1639 and 3419cm−1 are attributed to the vibrations of the OH groups on the silica surface or due to the presence of moisture absorbed in the sample. No change in the spectra was observed after immobilization of Ru and Pt DEN catalysts on mesoporous TiO2 and SiO2."
12,Thermogravimetric analysis,"3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis TGA analysis was used to determine the thermal stability of the synthesized mesoporous support materials as well as the temperature at which the P123 surfactant template is decomposed. TGA/DTA profiles of Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2 are shown in Fig. 4 . Meso-TiO2 was observed to undergo two decomposition steps. The first weight loss was due to the removal of moisture while the second weight loss was occurring as a result of decomposition of the P123 template and other volatiles such as 1-butanol and HNO3 used during the synthesis. About 6% in the first weight loss due to moisture in the sample was observed between 0 and 150°C and 44% weight loss arising from the decomposition of P123 surfactant occurred between 150 and 300°C for Meso-TiO2. However, three decomposition steps were observed for Meso-SiO2 material. For Meso-SiO2 material, the first weight loss (about 4%) occurred between 0 and 100°C and the second weight loss (about 13%) was observed between 100 and 300°C. The last weight loss (approximately 53%) occurred between 300 and 500°C. The first weight loss step was attributed to the presence of moisture while last two weight loss steps were due to the P123 template in case of Meso-SiO2. All supported catalysts were also analyzed prior to calcination to verify the immobilization of DEN catalysts on the mesoporous support materials. About 2% weight loss attributed to dendrimer decomposition was observed between 0 and 600°C for Ru supported catalysts (Fig. S2A,B in the Supplementary information). Pt supported catalysts were observed to have 2%wt loss steps. The first weight loss (1%) between 0 and 100°C was due to moisture whereas the second weight loss (about 3.5%) in the temperature range of 100–700°C was due to the decomposition of the dendrimer. The TGA/DTA profile for Pt supported catalysts are shown in Fig. S2C,D in the Supplementary information."
13,PXRD characterization,"3.5 PXRD characterization PXRD was also used for the characterization of the synthesized mesoporous materials prior and post nanoparticle (Ru40- and Pt40-DENs) immobilization. Wide angle PXRD diffraction patterns for Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2 are presented in Fig. 5(A and C). Additionally, it was also useful in determining the crystalline nature and phase transition that Meso-TiO2 went through at different heating temperatures. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, the crystalline anatase phase was more predominant for Meso-TiO2 samples heated from 150 to 450°C. However, the existence of a mixture of rutile phase and anatase phase was revealed by the XRD patterns and clearly observed for samples heated from 250 to 450°C. Peaks at 2θ=25.3°, 38.7°, 48.1°, 55.3°, 63.1°, 75.1° corresponds to (101), (200), (211), (204) and (215) planes of a anatase phase respectively (JCPD number, 78-2486). The peak corresponding to the rutile phase was observed at 2θ=44.6° (JCPD number, 23-0606). These well-defined crystalline planes of the Meso-TiO2 were also confirmed by HRTEM (see Fig. 3A inset). On the contrary, no change in the PXRD pattern was observed for Meso-SiO2 prior to and after calcination at 450°C for 6h. Wide-angle PXRD peak at around 2θ=22° is observed for Meso-SiO2. This is a characteristic peak for silica materials indicating the armophous nature of the pore walls [52]. The low angle peak for Meso-SiO2 was observed at 2θ=1.95° (110). This has been observed for other mesoporous silica materials with ordered channels [53]. The presence of low-angle PXRD peak on these materials serves as further evidence for the existence of mesopore stuctures formed by connection of inter-particle voids. The low-angle PXRD patterns for Meso-TiO2 at different heating temperature are shown in Fig. 5B. As can be observed, low-angle diffraction peak position moved to lower 2θ value as the heating temperature is increased. This has been attributed to the increase in particle sizes of the mesoporous materials as the heating temperature increases [54]. PXRD analysis was also carried out on the immobilized nanoparticle samples (Ru40@Meso-TiO2, Ru40@Meso-SiO2, Pt40@Meso-TiO2 and Pt40@Meso-SiO2) and PXRD patterns are shown in Fig. 5.5E. The PXRD analysis revealed that Meso-TiO2 support material was transformed into pure anatase after calcination at 550°C for 3h. The peak corresponding to Pt(111) (JCPD number 04-0802) was observed around 2θ=39° for Pt40@Meso-TiO2 and Pt40@Meso-SiO2 samples. It is noteworthy to mention that the peak corresponding to Pt on the Pt40@Meso-TiO2 sample was probably overshadowed by the anatase phase peak arising from Meso-TiO2 support. This anatase peak was also observed in the Meso-TiO2 support prior to immobilization of metal nanoparticles and is also prominent on the Ru@Meso-TiO2. This served as additional evidence that Pt catalysts were immobilized on the mesoporous materials. The peak signaling the presence of Ru was not observed for both samples, i.e, Ru40@Meso-TiO2 and Ru40@Meso-SiO2. This is due to the fact that the Ru nanoparticles were too small in terms of size (less than 3nm) and, in addition, were well dispersed on the support surface as observed by other authors [55]."
14,N2 adsorption-desorption analysis,"3.6 N2 adsorption-desorption analysis Fig. 6 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms as well as BJH desorption size distribution for both Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2 materials. Both materials displayed type IV isotherms accompanied by type I hysteresis loops for samples heated from 150 − 450°C. These features are associated with the existence of mesoporous materials. Although it should be noted that for Meso-TiO2 sample heated at 150°C, the hysteresis loops were not clear. This could have been due to a strong interaction between the titania and P123 at that temperature. The BJH size distribution profiles revealed that both materials possess a narrow pore size distribution of uniform size. Table 1 summarizes BET surface area, BJH pore size distribution and pore volume for Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2 at different heating temperatures. The BET surface area was observed to increase with heating temperature from 150 to 350°C. The surface area of Meso-TiO2 was 8.8m2/g after calcination at 150°C. When the Meso-TiO2 material was calcined at 250°C and 350°C, the surface area increased to 62.1m2/g and 88.1m2/g, respectively. Similarly, the surface area of Meso-SiO2 increased from 521.5m2/g (calcination at 150°C) to 854.9m2/g and 874.6m2/g when calcination temperature is increased to 250°C and 350°C, respectively. This could be attributed to the removal of P123 surfactant as the temperature increases. However, a significant decrease in surface area to 34.1m2/g and 729.4m2/g was observed for Meso-TiO2 and Meso-SiO2, respectively, when calcination temperature is increased to 450°C. This is attributed to the increase in crystallite size at this temperature or higher, which consequently lead to a decrease in the surface area. This trend for the decrease in surface area as the calcination temperature increases was also observed for other mesoporous materials reported in our laboratory [56]. No correlation was observed between calcination temperature and pore volume for both materials. It is noteworthy to mention that the Meso-SiO2 material had a very high surface area comparable to or even higher than other mesoporous materials synthesized by conventional synthesis methods [57,58]. The average BJH pore size increased with heating temperature from 250°C to 450°C for both mesoporous materials. This trend was also reported for other mesoporous materials prepared using a similar method [54]. The physicochemical properties of the mesoporous support materials were analyzed after immobilization of nanoparticles into their pores or surface. Mesoporous materials were observed to have retained their mesoporous structure even after immobilization of the DEN catalysts. Immobilization of DEN catalysts was performed on mesoporous materials calcined at 450°C followed by subsequent calcination at 550°C to remove the dendrimer template. This was confirmed by N2 adsorption-desorption type IV isotherms observed for all supported catalysts as well the BET results. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution profiles for all supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 6E and F. After immobilization of nanoparticles, the surface area and the average pore size of the mesoporous materials were observed to generally decrease after calcination at 550°C for all catalysts. For instance, the surface area of Ru40@Meso-TiO2 catalyst determined to be 30.2m2/g while the “naked” Meso-TiO2 (calcined at 450°C) had a surface area of 34.1m2/g prior to Ru40-DEN immobilization. This could be attributed to blocked pores and/or surface of the catalyst support by the immobilized nanoparticles. The physicochemical properties results for mesoporous material supported Ru and Pt catalysts are summarized in Table 1."
15,Catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL,"3.7 Catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL The catalytic performance of prepared dendrimer-derived mesoporous supported catalysts was investigated in the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. The catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL (Scheme 1 ) generally involves the hydrogenation step yielding the unstable 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid followed by dehydration step which lead to intra-molecular esterification to give GVL [13,59,60]. The proposed mechanism followed by the catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL is illustrated in Scheme 2 . The optimum reaction conditions were investigated over a range of temperatures and pressures. Fig. 7 shows the effect of temperature on the conversion of LA using different pressure. Preliminary experiments were performed in the absence of a catalyst or in the presence of “naked” catalysts supports as a baseline (see Table 2 ). No conversion of LA was observed under those conditions. This implies that both support materials did not participate in the catalytic hydrogenation of LA. 3.7.1 Effect of temperature and pressure on the conversion of LA during hydrogenation of LA to GVL The effect of temperature between 120 and 150°C on the conversion of LA was investigated in order to get the optimum reaction temperature. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the conversion of LA was observed to increase non-linearly with the increase in reaction temperature. Colloidal DEN catalysts were observed to give higher conversions for LA to GVL as compared to supported ones throughout all systems studied. This is attributed to the fact that colloidal DEN catalysts are well homogenized in the reaction and their active atom sites are easily accessed by reactant molecules as compared to supported catalysts. More than 80% LA conversion was achieved at 140°C for Ru40@Meso-TiO2, Ru- and Pt-DEN catalysts. At 150°C, almost complete conversion of LA was observed for the same catalysts. The effect of pressure was also investigated using 10, 20 and 30bar. Similar results were obtained for 3 different pressures investigated. These findings ruled out the effect of pressure on conversion of LA within the temperature range studied and hence the lowest pressure of 10bar was selected for further study. These results was comparable to what was reported for commercial TiO2 supported Ru catalyzed LA hydrogenation [3]. However, their catalytic system was performed at higher temperature (200°C) and pressure (40bar), the observed activity was comparable to what was by our dendrimer-derived TiO2 and SiO2 supported Ru catalysts using lower temperature (150°C) and pressure (10bar). 3.7.2 Influence of reaction time on the conversion of LA during catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL The effect of time on the conversion of LA to GVL was also investigated at optimum temperature (150°C) and H2 pressure (10bar). Fig. 8 A shows the effect of reaction time on the conversion of LA. 100% conversion of LA was observed for DEN catalysts at 4h. Ru40-DENs was shown to be more active as compared to the Pt40-DENs catalyst throughout the entire time interval studied. A 100% and 98% conversion of LA was also observed after 5h for the Ru40@Meso-SiO2 and Ru40@Meso-TiO2 catalyst, respectively. The mesoporous supported Pt catalysts exhibited less than 90% LA conversion even after a reaction time of 5h. More than 50% conversion of LA was achieved after 3h for all catalysts studied. It noteworthy to mention that, although the trend looks very clear from the graphs presented in Fig. 8 it would be inaccurate to make assumption as to which catalyst is more active than others. This is simply because the metal loading of these catalysts was determined to be different by ICP-OES. Therefore, although the same mass of catalyst was used, the actual numbers of atom active sites are not the same from one catalyst to the other. In order to make a sensible comparison of the catalytic performance, the turn-over frequency must be calculated for each catalyst. Calculated TOF values for all catalysts are graphically presented in Fig. 8B. The TOF values were estimated by using the surface area of the average particle size based on TEM results as has been reported by other authors recently [67]. Kinetic data for the hydrogenation of LA as well as the comparison with the literature data is given in Table 3 . 3.7.3 Effect of solvent in the catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL The effect of solvent was investigated by comparing the behavior of 1,4-dioxane and H2O in the catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL. 1,4-Dioxane has been used as a solvent for the hydrogenation of LA in most studies because of its considerably higher boiling point compared to GVL, making it easy for product separation by distillation process. Additionally, it is a polar aprotic, green solvent. However, excellent conversion of LA has been achieved using H2O as a green solvent [12,14,15,60,66]. Results obtained when using 1,4-dioxane and H2O as solvents during catalytic hydrogenation of LA to GVL for all catalysts are summarized in Table 2. Although the conversion of LA to yield GVL when using 1,4-dioxane were observed to be higher compared to when using H2O as a solvent, good conversions of LA were also achieved when H2O was used as a green solvent for all systems studied. 1,4-Dioxane, just like H2O, is an aprotic polar solvent and as such solubility of hydrogen is expected to be slightly higher in dioxane than in H2O in principle [69]. contrary to what we and others [69] have observed, other authors have observed an increased in activity when H2O is used as compared to 1,4-dioxane [70]. This enhanced in activity for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL when water is used as a solvent was explained elsewhere [61,62]. Hydrogen bond effect in H2O and the participation of H atom from H2O have been attributed to this enhanced activity when H2O is used as a solvent. The conversions and selectivity obtained when either 1,4-dioxane or H2O was used as a solvent were comparable to what others have reported for the catalytic hydrogenation of LA albeit using different catalysts (see Table 2). The observed good conversions by all catalysts can be attributed to the metal active sites on catalyst surface. Excellent selectivity for GVL was observed for all catalysts. This higher selectivity for GVL can be attributed to the presence of Lewis acid sites on the supports (TiO2 and SiO2 in our case) as previously suggested recently by other researchers [70,71]. Low selectivity for MTHF was observed for all Pt catalysts. The highest selectivity (3%) of MTHF was observed for Pt40@Meso-TiO2 catalyst. Similarly, very low selectivity for PD was also observed for some Pt catalysts. Irrespective of the metal loading, the Meso@SiO2 supported catalysts showed higher activity than their Meso-TiO2 supported counterparts for all system studied. The high surface area of Meso-SiO2 support material probably played a role in this enhanced activity for Meso-SiO2 supported catalysts. Similarly, Ru catalysts generally displayed higher activity as compared to Pt catalysts irrespective of the support. All Ru catalysts (DEN and supported) showed highest activities and TOF values compared to supported Pt catalyst for all systems studied. Similar trend has been reported by other authors when Ru/C, Pd/C and Pt/C catalyzed hydrogenation of LA to GVL [72]. This can be attributed to more active sites available on the small sized Ru nanoparticle surface catalysts as well as their good dispersion on the oxide solid support materials. Moreover, this enhance activity of the Ru catalyst in aqueous phase media has also been attributed to the hydrogen bond effect of liquid water [61]. Other possible mechanisms for the superiority of Ru catalysts as compared to other counterparts metals (Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh, etc) has been described by Michael and Gallezot [73]. Albeit different reaction conditions were used, the activity of all catalysts studied in our systems were comparable to or even better to other conventional TiO2/SiO2 supported Ru and Pt catalysts prepared using different methods as can be seen in Table 2 [2,13,61–64]. For instance, Pikun et al. reported only 26% conversion of LA and a selectivity of 54% towards GVL using Ru/SiO2 catalysts [64]. GC–MS spectra for products analysis are given in Fig. S4–S7 (Supplementary information). 3.7.4 Catalyst recycling study The stability of these supported catalysts was investigated by re-using them for 3 reaction cycles. To achieve this, reaction conditions (substrate amount, catalyst amount and reaction time) were adjusted or scaled up to make allow easy separation from the reaction mixture after each run. As shown in Fig. 9 , all catalysts retained their catalytic activity after 3 reaction cycles. This feature makes them good catalysts for industrial application or academic research. This is attributed to the strong interaction between the small nanoparticles and the mesoporous supports (Meso-TiO2 or Meso-SiO2). However, it should be mentioned that, although not lost entirely, the activity was observed to decrease as the number of reaction cycles increases for all catalysts. The conversion of LA only decreased by about 10% after the third recycling cycle for both Ru and Pt catalysts. This is attributed to some loss of catalyst that occurred during the separation process in between each reaction cycle. The selectivity for GVL was not affected by recycling of the catalysts. After separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture, the supernatant was analyzed by ICP-OES to investigate if the catalysts leached from the support during the recycling study. No metal was detected by ICP-OES in the reaction mixture for all catalysts. Post-characterization analysis by TEM (see Fig. S8 in the Supplementary information) showed that all catalysts retained their sizes after 3 reaction cycles. No structural change was revealed by PXRD analysis profiles for all used spent catalysts even after 3 reaction cycles (see Fig. S9 in the Supplementary information). Based on these observations, it can be assumed that the surface of the TiO2 surface did not get reduced under reaction conditions used. This served as evidence that there was no leaching of metal from the catalyst to the reaction solution and that the catalysts remain stable and robust during the recycling study."
16,Conclusions,"Non reducible, highly stable mesoporous materials such as TiO2 and SiO2 can be synthesized using a simple soft template method at mild temperature. This method allows for the synthesis of mesoporous materials with narrow pore size distribution. The physical properties of these mesoporous materials can easily be tuned by subjecting them to different heating temperatures. PAMAM dendrimers were used for the synthesis of small-sized Ru and Pt nanoparticles. These DEN catalysts can be immobilized onto preformed solid mesoporous support materials for the fabrication of stable heterogeneous catalysts. Mesoporous TiO2 and SiO2 supported Ru and Pt catalysts showed excellent activity in the selective hydrogenation of LA to GVL. The use of H2O as a green solvent was found to give good LA conversion to GVL. Catalyst recycling studies showed that these catalysts are robust and can potentially be used in industrial applications. Meso-SiO2 supported catalysts generally displayed higher activity than Meso-TiO2 supported catalysts for all systems studied. This is attributed to large surface area of Meso-SiO2 which promotes good dispersion of nanoparticles, and minimizes particles agglomeration during catalytic reaction. Based on the calculated TOF values, the supported and unsupported (DEN) Ru catalysts showed superior activity as compared to Pt catalysts for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL. This was agreement with findings by other authors. Based on TOF calculations, Ru@Meso-SiO2 catalyst was found to exhibit excellent activity among all catalysts studied."
