0,Introduction,"The design of the separation processes related to liquid mixtures containing alcohols and water are important in the chemical industry [1,2]. In chemical and biological processes, 1-propanol and 2-propanol are frequently used as extraction solvents [3,4]. In these processes, the above alcohols form a mixture of azeotrope with water. Therefore, separation of alcohol with simple distillation is not easy and usually useful; and instead the application of liquid-liquid extraction, which is one of the most important scientific and industrial options, is considered. In utilizing the liquid - liquid extraction, the use of ionic liquids instead of conventional solvents is preferred for their azeotropes breaking capacity [5–9]. The extensive use of dangerous, toxic, and fugacious solvents in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries leads to damage to the environment. Recently, ionic liquids which are salts with a melting point below 100 °C, consisting of organic or inorganic anions and an organic cation, are used as alternatives and green solvents [10]. These compounds have properties such as low vapor pressure, large liquid range, high thermal and chemical stability, and good versatility. Therefore, there is no chance of losing the solvent to the environment, which is often a frequent problem of ordinary solvents. Ionic liquids are known as green solvents; however, those based on imidazolium and pyridinium cations which are combined with fluorinated or other anions are highly toxic and poorly biodegradable [11–14]. Thus, in recent years, researchers have focused on using non-toxic and biodegradable ionic liquids that are made in simple and economical ways [15–19]. In this regard, choline bitartrate may be proposed which is obtained from the combination of choline with tartaric acid. This compound is non - toxic and has higher absorption ability relative to pure choline chloride that is used as essential nutrients of human [20]. In design of liquid-liquid equipment for extraction processes, the correct parameters of thermodynamic models are required. For this purpose binodal data are required. On the other hand, having tie-line information in ternary systems are essential to investigate the behavior of the phases. Recently many research workers focused their attention on using aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) containing alcohol and suitable salt for partitioning of proteins and drugs [21–25]. Our research group has previously studied the liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) for some ternary aqueous systems containing aliphatic alcohols and some organic salts (di-sodium hydrogen citrate [26], sodium tartrate [27] potassium or sodium citrate [28]). Previously we have studied the effect of choline chloride on the dehydration and phase behavior of aqueous 1-propanol and 2-propanol solutions [29]. Recently, the application of choline-based ATPSs for extraction and purification of organic molecules, proteins, and DNA have been reviewed [30]. In this work, the LLE of (1-propanol or 2-propanol + choline + water) systems and their performances in acetaminophen separation have been studied. For these systems no information is existed in the literature regarding phase behavior and drug partitioning. In partitioning studies the acetaminophen was selected because it is the most frequently used drug. We present the experimental binodal and tie-line data for (1-propanol or 2-propanol + choline bitartrate + water) systems at T = (298.15, 308.15 and 318.15) K and atmospheric pressure (≈85 kPa). Using these data the temperature influence on these parameters are discussed. Furthermore, the plait points of these systems have been calculated at each temperature using linear least squares regression method. The application of these systems for separation of acetaminophen was also studied. The effects of tie-line length and temperature were investigated on the acetaminophen separation. The experimental binodals were correlated with well-known Merchuk equation [31]. The equations Othmer-Tobias and Bancroft [32], Setschenow [33] and the non-random two-liquid (e-NRTL) [34] model were used for correlating of the tie-line compositions. Finally, the choline bitartrate and choline chloride ability in the presence of aqueous 1-propanol or 2-propanol for acetaminophen separation were evaluated by determining the distribution coefficients and selectivity. The effect of addition of choline bitartrate on the dehydration of these alcohols was studied considering the alcohol concentration in the alcohol rich-phase."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The used materials together with their physicochemical properties are given in Table 1 . The chemicals were used without further purification. In preparing solutions, double-distilled deionized water with a conductivity of 0.055 μS.cm-1 was used. Using a Karl Fischer titration the water content of choline bitartrate was measured which was about 0.1% (w/w); this water content was considered in all the calculations."
3,Apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Apparatus and procedure 2.2.1 Liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) We used the same apparatus and experimental procedure [26,27] as previously adopted for obtaining the LLE data. Briefly, a glass vessel with an external jacket in which the water was circulated at a constant temperature was selected. The temperature was controlled with an uncertainty of 0.05 K using a thermostat. The binodal curves were determined by cloud point titration method. In this method, the composition of the mixture for each point on the binodal curve was determined from the amount of titrant added until turbidity was observed. An analytical balance (Shimatzu, 321–34553, Shimatzu Co., Japan) with a precision of ±1.10−7 kg was used for weighing. By this method for the mass fraction of both alcohol and salt the maximum uncertainty was found to be ±0.002. Five feed samples (about 2∙10−5 m3) were prepared by mixing suitable amounts of components in the vessel to obtain two-phase systems the compositions of each phase have to be determined. Then, the prepared samples were placed in the thermostat (JULABO model MB, Germany) at each temperature with a precision of 0.02. The required time for separation of samples into two clear phases was at least 48 h. After separations of the two phases, we determined the concentrations of choline bitartrate in the top and bottom phases by conductometric method as adopted by Diniz et al. [35] for determination of sodium hydroxide in obtaining tie-lies for the (PEG + sodium hydroxide + water) system. Conductometric measurements were carried out in a digital conductivity meter (Metrohm model 712) with a sensitivity of 0.1%; and conductivity cell was a dipping-type with platinized electrode. From calibration of apparatus with aqueous KCl solutions the cell constant was obtained. All the conductometric measurements were made in a double-walled glass container at a certain temperature. The above circulating thermostat with a precision of 0.02 K was used to maintain the temperature. The uncertainty of mass fraction of choline bitartrate determined by conductometric method was estimated to be 0.001. To determine the concentration of alcohols in both phases, the refractive index method as presented by Cheluget et al. [36] was used. To measure the refractive index of solutions the refractometer (ATAGO DR-A1, Japan) with a precision of 0.0001 was used. The estimated uncertainty in refractive index measurement is 0.0002. According to this method [37], for dilute aqueous solutions containing an alcohol and the choline bitartrate, there is the following relation between the refractive index, n D, and the mass fractions of alcohol, w m, and choline bitartrate, w s: (1) n D = n 0 + a m w m + a s w s here, n 0 denotes the refractive index of pure water for which the value of 1.3325 at T = 298.15 K was obtained. The values of two constants a m and a s corresponding to alcohol and choline bitartrate respectively were obtained from the linear calibration plots of the refractive index of the solution. The values of these constants together with the correlation coefficient values, R 2, are reported in Table S1 in supporting information. However as described by Cheluget et al. [36], Eq. (1) is only valid for dilute solutions; so before refractive index measurements we diluted the samples to be at mass fraction C range as represented in Table S1 in supporting information. The uncertainty for the mass fraction of both alcohols using Eq. (1) was better than 0.002. 2.2.2 Partitioning of acetaminophen in ATPSs In order to evaluate drug extraction efficiencies of acetaminophen, feed samples with similar overall compositions used to obtain tie-lines were again prepared in 5 ml tubes and to each sample 0.001 g acetaminophen was added. The prepared samples agitated rigorously for 30 min and then were placed in a water bath at the desired temperature until phase separation was observed. For complete partitioning of the drug between the two phases and reach equilibrium the sample should be retained in water bath for 24 h. Finally, the samples were centrifuged at a speed of 2000 rpm for 10 min to ensure complete separation of the phases. Temperature was carefully controlled within ±0.02 K by the help of the thermostat mentioned above. After careful separation of phases in equilibrium, acetaminophen concentration in each phase was determined using UV spectrophotometer (Model: SPECORD 40-Series Analytik Jena AG-Germany) at 253 nm."
4,Results and discussion,
5,"Experimental binodal curves, and tie-line data","3.1 Experimental binodal curves, and tie-line data The binodal and tie-line data obtained experimentally for the ternary {1-propanol or 2-propanol (m) + choline bitartrate (s) + water (w)} systems at T = (298.15, 308.15 and 318.15) K and atmospheric pressure (≈85 kPa) are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. We attempted to obtain the relevant information regarding the recovery of other aliphatic alcohols (i.e. methanol, ethanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and tert-butanol) using the choline bitartrate; however, these systems do not form aqueous two-phase systems. In the case of butanol-family, the choline bitartrate was precipitated from the ternary aqueous solutions."
6,Phase separation ability of the different alcohols,"3.2 Phase separation ability of the different alcohols According to Fig. 3 , which shows a comparison between the binodal curves in the systems studied at 298.15, the two-phase region for 1-propanol is larger than 2-propanol. This phase forming ability (i.e. 1-propanol > 2-propanol) is also observed at other temperatures, T = (308.15 and 318.15) K. This behavior has also been found in the case of {choline chloride +1 or 2-propanol + water} systems [29], and can be discussed on the basis of kosmotropicity of choline bitartrate and the intermolecular interaction between the alcohol-water and alcohol-alcohol self-interactions (including Van Der Waals and hydrogen-bonding forces) which is given in some detail in our previous work [29] for {choline chloride +1 or 2-propanol + water} systems. Similar to ATPSs containing choline chloride [29], in the case of ATPSs containing choline bitartrate, the shift of the binodal curve to higher miscibility of 2-propanol may also be related to the higher polarity of 2-propanol compared to 1-propanol. Also, as commented previously [37,38], the alcohol-alcohol self-interactions are related to the boiling points of alcohols. 1-propanol having higher boiling point than 2-propanol indicates that there is more self-interaction forces between 1-propanol molecules and therefore it can be easily excluded from the rest of the solution as a separated phase."
7,"Effect of temperature on the binodal curve, tie-lines, and the drug partitioning","3.3 Effect of temperature on the binodal curve, tie-lines, and the drug partitioning As can be seen from Fig. 1 for the both studied systems, by increasing temperature, the binodal curves slightly shift closer to the coordinate axes, increasing the two-phase region and thus decreasing the single-phase region. The effect of temperature on slope of tie-lines is not significant as it is seen from Fig. 2; however, as the temperature increases, the alcohol concentration in the top phase increases. Thus, the lower phase being diluted and the salt concentration in the bottom phase decreases. This trend is similar to the previous reports regarding the effect of temperature on the tie-lines and binodals for the ATPSs composed of 1-propanol and 1-hexyl-3 methylimidazolium bis (tri-fluoro methyl sulfonyl) imide or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (tri-fluoro methyl sulfonyl) imide [39] and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis (tri-fluoro methyl sulfonyl) imide [40]. The effect of temperature on drug partitioning and extraction efficiency is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for the above systems containing 1-propanol and 2-propanol, respectively. As can be seen from these figures, for both the studied systems the extraction efficiency of acetaminophen increases with increasing temperature."
8,Estimation of the critical concentration of choline bitartratre (or plait point),"3.4 Estimation of the critical concentration of choline bitartratre (or plait point) The binodal curves of the studied systems were used together with the following linear equation to find the location of the plait point at any temperature [41]. (2) w m = f + g w s where, f and g are the fitting parameters. For the studied systems, the values for the plait points together with the fitting parameters for Eq. (2) and the corresponding correlation coefficients, R 2 , are given in Table 4 . Fig. 6 shows the estimated position of the plait point for systems (1-propanol or 2-propanol + choline bitartrate + water) with the method used as an example at T = 298.15 K."
9,Estimation of the slope and tie-lines length,"3.5 Estimation of the slope and tie-lines length In the design of the liquid-liquid extraction process the length of the tie-lines, TLL, and the slope of the tie-lines, STL, are important parameters, which have been calculated for each system using equations (3) and (4) respectively at different temperatures. (3) T L L = [ ( w m t o p − w m b o t ) 2 + ( w s t o p − w s b o t ) ] 0.5 (4) S T L = ( w m t o p − w m b o t ) / ( w s t o p − w s b o t ) Superscripts “top” and “bot” indicate top and bottom phases, respectively. The TLL and STL values calculated from the above relations are shown in Table 3 for the systems used. The effect of alcohol type on these parameters is shown in Fig. 3."
10,Study on the capability of choline bitartrate to extract 1- or 2- propanol from water,"3.6 Study on the capability of choline bitartrate to extract 1- or 2- propanol from water To evaluate the ability of separating 1-propanol or 2-propanol alcohols from the water mixture by the addition of choline bitartrate, the extraction efficiency (S m) and distribution coefficient (K m) should be calculated. The distribution coefficient is expressed as the ratio of the mass fraction of 1-propanol or 2-propanol in the upper and lower phases, after the addition of choline bitartrate to mixture containing water and alcohol. K m values were calculated by Eq. (5): (5) K m = w m t o p w m b o t As shown in Table 5 , the obtained K m values are greater than unity implying the effective separation of both alcohols. The effect of temperature on the K m for these systems is shown in Fig. S1 in supporting information and indicate that both the alcohols are easily separated from water at lower temperatures. The definition for the selectivity, S m, is given as equation (6). The value of S m indicates the ability of choline bitartrate to extract 1-propanol or 2-propanol from aqueous mixtures. Selectivity values are also the measure of ability of choline bitartrate to separate the azeotropic mixture of 1-propanol or 2-propanol (m) and water (w). (6) S m = w m t o p / w w t o p w m b o t / w w b o t The collected S m values in Table 5 are always higher than unity, meaning that extraction of 1-propanol or 2-propanol from the water mixture can be satisfactorily made using choline bitartrate as a suitable agent. Table 5 shows that the S m values increase when a large portion of choline bitartrate is used. In addition, the effect of temperature on the S m values is shown in Fig. S2 in supporting information indicating that temperature does not have a significant effect on the selectivity. To assess the ability of choline bitartrate in recovering 1-propanol or 2-propanol from water mixture, the corresponding S m and K m values were compared with those of the other ATPSs containing the same alcohol and different ILs [39,40,42–46]. The results are collected in Table S2 in supporting information. The results show that choline bitartrate can be used with much better selectivity than the other previously selected ILs to recover 2-propanol from the water mixture at the studied temperatures. Table S2 indicates that in the case of 1-propanol choline bitartrate with a maximum selectivity value of about 88.37 has a greater ability to recover 1-propanol from the water mixture compared to the other ILs used with the exception of trihexyl (tetradadical) phosphonium bis (2,2, 4-trimethylpentyl) phosphineate [45–47] and choline chloride [29]. However, the synthesis of this phosphineate ionic liquid is much more difficult and costly than choline bitartrate, which is a cheap material and produced in large scale production. Therefore, in practice the use of the mentioned phosphineate ionic liquid is not suitable for recovering of 1-propanol from water mixture. The selectivity with choline bitartrate for recovering 1-propanol from water mixture is only slightly less than choline chloride. Therefore, we conclude that choline bitartrate as a green and biocompatible compound, with greater availability and low cost can be considered as a good candidate for recovering of the investigated alcohols particularly 2-propanol from water at room temperature."
11,Partitioning of acetaminophen,"3.7 Partitioning of acetaminophen The partition coefficients and efficiency values for acetaminophen in two alcohol ATPS systems containing choline bitartrate are reported in Table 6 . For the purpose of comparison, the ability of corresponding alcohol ATPS containing choline chloride was also investigated at different temperatures choosing the same tie-line compositions employed in the case of ATPSs containing choline bitarate (as given in Table 4) with the results reported in Table 7 . Results of partition coefficients and efficiencies for acetaminophen in the investigated ATPSs containing choline bitartrate or choline chloride in Table 7 indicate that better partitioning is observed when the choline bitartrate is used."
12,Modeling,"3.8 Modeling 3.8.1 Binodal curve correlation The performance of the following Merchuk [31] equation was tested for regressing of binodal data at different temperatures: (7) w p = a exp (bw s 0.5 – cw s 3 ) In the above relation, subscripts p and s stand for polymer and salt, respectively. T is the absolute temperature; and a 0 , a 1 , b 0, b 1, c 0 and c 1 are the parameters of Eq. (7) which were determined by fitting experimental binodal data for {1- propanol or 2-propanol + choline bitartrate + water} systems at T = (298.15, 308.15 and 318.15) K by non-linear least-square regression method. Equation (7) has already been used successfully [34] for correlation of binodal data for some (polymer + salt + water) systems. The obtained fitting parameters of equation (7) together with the corresponding standard deviations are given in Table 8 . The obtained rather small standard deviations (sd) values show that equation (7) can be satisfactorily used to reproduce binodal data. 3.8.2 Tie-line correlation For representing experimental tie-line data for (alcohol + choline bitartrate + water), three different equations with different thermodynamic basis were used and their performances were compared. 3.8.2.1 Othmer-Tobias, Bancroft and Bachman equations The Othmer-Tobias (Eq. (8a)) and Bancroft (Eq. (8b)) [32] have been used to correlate the tie-lines composition: (8a) ( 1 − w m t o p w m t o p ) = k ( 1 − w s b o t w s b o t ) n (8b) ( w w b o t w s b o t ) = k 1 ( w w t o p w m t o p ) r where k, n, k 1, r represent the fit parameters. Table 9 presents the values of correlation coefficient R 2 which are close to unity, indicating a good consistency of the obtained tie-line data. 3.8.2.2 Setschenow equation The following model proposed by Hey et al. [33] as the Setschenow equation is also used to correlate the tie-line data of the systems studied: (9) ln ( m m t o p m m b o t ) = k m ( m m b o t − m m t o p ) + k s ( m s b o t − m s t o p ) In Eq. (9), the k s is the salting-out coefficient, k m is a constant, and m m and m s are the molality of alcohol and salt respectively. The two k s and k m parameters were determined from the fitting the LLE data obtained at the temperatures studied, and their values presented in Table 10 together with the deviations. In correlation the LLE data the following objective function (Eq. (10)) is used: (10) O f = ∑ T ∑ p ∑ l ∑ j ( w T , p , l , j c a l − w T , p , l , j exp ) 2 here, w T,p,l,j refers to the mass percent of the component j in the phase p for l the tie-line. The superscripts “cal” and “exp” are used for the calculated and experimental mass fraction values, respectively. Rather low standard deviations reported in Table 10 indicate that Setschenow type equation (Eq. (9)) with only two parameters has excellent performance in correlating tie-lines for the studied system at different temperatures. Close examination of k s values reported in Table 10, indicate that there is no specific relationship between them; and therefore these data are not useful for describing the salting-out effect of the investigated systems at different temperatures. This behavior has also been found in the previously studied systems (alcohol + sodium sulfite + water) [48] and (alcohol + di-sodium tartrate or di-sodium succinate + water) [49]. However, although the Setschenow equation does not provide any information on the salting-out ability in the studied systems but it has excellent ability to reproduce the experimental tie-line data. 3.8.2.3 e-NRTL model The extended NRTL model (e-NRTL) [26,34] is a local composition and comprehensive molecular thermodynamic model and developed for systems with molecular and ionic species. According to previous studies [26,28,34,47,50] on LLE modeling of aqueous two-phase systems, the e-NRTL model [26] usually has a good performance in tie-lines correlations. Recently, the e-NRTL model which has been developed to illustrate tie-lines in (polymer + salt + water) systems [34] has been modified to correlate the LLE data of (alcohol + salt + water) systems [26] by giving the unit value for the number of segment for alcohol. In the e-NRTL model [26], the excess Gibbs energy G E is defined as the sum of two contributions: Long-range electrostatic G E , L R , that represents the interaction between ions, and short-range G E , S R , which indicates the interaction between all species: (12) G E = G E , L R + G E , S R The activity coefficient of any component j is given as follows: (13) ln γ j = 1 R T ( ∂ G m e x ∂ n j ) T , P , n i ≠ n j hence, the activity coefficient of component j (alcohol, ions and water) is the sum of long range and short range contributions: (14) ln γ E = ln γ E , L R + ln γ E , S R For the long-range contribution, the Pitzer-Debye-Huckel [51] is usually used. In this work, the extended NRTL (e-NRTL) [26] model developed for (alcohol + salt + water) systems has been applied. Since the short range equation for e-NRTL model is lengthy, it is not given here. 3.8.2.4 Details of correlation For correlation of experimental tie-line data with the e-NRTL model [26], we used ρ = 14.9, which is often adopted for aqueous electrolyte solutions [52]. The required density values for water and alcohol at different temperatures were taken from Refs. [53,54]. The dielectric constant values for each alcohol at required temperature were obtained from the literature [55]. These physical properties for the alcohols are presented in Table 1. We need to determine the six interaction parameters ( τ m , c a , τ c a , m , τ w , c a , τ c a , w , τ m w , τ w m ) of the e-NRTL model. Also for the three non-randomness factors ( α w c a , α m w and α m c a ) fixed values should be selected. From the correlating the existing vapor-liquid data for binary aqueous alcohol and salt solutions and the experimental LLE data, we determined the suitable non-randomness factors values with better quality of fitting which are presented in Table 11 . The four interaction parameters ( τ w , c a , τ c a , w , τ m w , and τ w m ) corresponding to binary interaction parameters of aqueous choline bitartrate and aqueous 1-propanol or 2-propanol were obtained from the fitting of experimental water activity or osmotic coefficient data to the e-NRT model [26]. This can be done only at 298.15 K, since water activity or osmotic coefficients are available only at 298.15 K for the aqueous choline bitartrate and aqueous alcohol solutions. The two remaining ( τ c a , m τ m , c a ) parameters can be determined from the fitting of the LLE data at 298.15 K. At T = (308.15 and 318.15) K, we considered all the six parameters as adjustable parameters and determined their values from fitting of the LLE data at working temperature. The obtained parameters are reported in Table 11. The necessary activity coefficient data for binary choline bitartrate at T = 298.15 K were taken from Ref. [56]. The other remaining parameters are also obtained from the fitting of the LLE data. The standard deviations reported in Table 11 indicate that the previously developed e-NRTL [26] model for (alcohol + salt + water) systems perform well in correlating the LLE data for the two-phase systems investigated. According to the standard deviations values reported in Tables 9–11, final evaluation of the performances of the different models used in this work indicates that better quality of fitting the tie-line data is obtained with the Setschenow equation which has only two parameters."
13,Conclusions,"The liquid-liquid equilibrium of the systems {1-propanol or 2-propanol + cholinebitartrate + water} were studied at T = (298.15, 308.15 and 318.15) K and atmospheric pressure (≈85 kPa). Experimental results show that temperature has little effect on the phase separation ability of the systems. The obtained binodal data can be well regenerated by the Merchuk empirical equation. In addition, the performance of different equations (Othmer-Tobias, Bancraft and Setschenow) and the local composition based model (e-NRTL) were assessed in reproducing the experimental tie-lines and found that the Setschenow equation with only two parameters represents the tie-lines much better that the other used equations. By comparing the distribution coefficients and selectivity values of choline bitartrate with that of choline chloride and also with the other ionic liquids that have recently been investigated as alcohol separation factors, we concluded that the choline bitartrate is a much better candidate than the other used ILs in regard to the recovery of 2-propanol from the water mixtures at the studied temperatures. In regard with the recovering of 1-propanol, choline bitartrate with a selectivity of about 88.37 had slightly lower value than the choline chloride investigated before but its ability is much greater than the previously studied ILs; exception is the IL, trihexyl (tetradadical) phosphonium bis (2,2,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinate, for which higher selectivity was obtained. Therefore, it can be concluded that choline bitartrate as a green and biocompatible green material, with greater availability and low cost can be considered as a good candidate for 1 or 2-propanol recovery from aqueous solutions. In addition, the partitioning behavior of acetaminophen in aqueous alcohol two-phase systems containing choline bitartrate and also choline chloride was investigated at different temperatures; and it was found that much better partitioning was observed with choline bitartrate than the choline chloride. Also, for the both alcohol-based ATPSs containing choline bitartrate or choline chloride, the extraction efficiency of acetaminophen increase by increasing the temperature and the length of the tie-lines."
