0,Introduction,"With the gradually dwindling of oil reserves and soaring crude oil price, the catalytic conversion of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) derived from natural gas or shale gas, coal and biomass feedstock to variable liquid fuels and chemicals is currently considered as one of the promising but challenging topics in the field of C1 chemistry [1–3]. The catalytic synthesis of ethanol and higher alcohols (C2+ longer alcohols, HA) through CO hydrogenation has attracted extensive interest, owing to the relevance of these products as clean liquid fuels (fuel additives), hydrogen carriers for fuel cell and precursors for important chemicals and pharmaceuticals [4–6]. Generally, ethanol and higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) catalysts can be divided into four types: i.e., noble Rh-based catalysts, modified Mo/MoS2-based catalysts, modified Cu-based or ZnCr-based methanol synthesis (MS) catalysts and modified Co-based or Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts [7–9]. Rh-based catalyst, aiming at developing the atomically adjacent Rh0-Rh+ species, is a high-efficiency catalytic system to produce ethanol from syngas, however, it could not be utilized in large scale processes due to the exorbitant price and limited availability [5,10]. Modified Co-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for ethanol and higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from syngas since the Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP) firstly reported the CuCo catalyst in 1970s [11–14]. Researches from academic and industrial circles on Co-based catalysts were mostly concentrated on CuCo system owing to the low feedstock cost and high selectivity of higher alcohols [15–17]. The CuCo catalyst exhibits an efficient synergetic catalysis between copper and cobalt active sites with distinguished roles, in which metallic cobalt catalyzes CO dissociation to generate surface alkyl group (CH x ) while metallic copper enables adsorption and insertion of non-dissociation CO and subsequent step-wise hydrogenation to the ethanol and higher alcohols, as envisaged [18–20]. Accordingly, the intimate contact between highly dispersed Cu and Co active phases has been recognized as a crucial factor for the satisfactory ethanol or HA selectivity [20,21]. Prieto et al. have combined DFT calculations and microcosmic kinetics model with accurate preparation routes to design a CuCo/MoO x catalyst with a Cu/(Cu + Co) ratio of 0.3, which presents a higher HA selectivity (ca. 26%) and time yield of total alcohols. The superior nanoscale metal intimacy of CuCo NPs prevents the segregation of Cu phase and greatly enhances catalytic performance [20]. Furthermore, a uniform dispersion of metal Cu and Co elements in the Cu@(CuCo-alloy) structure is responsible for HAS according to Wei et al.’s research [15]. Apart from the necessity of homogeneous uniform of active sites in catalyst particles scale, the group of Kruse developed a CoCuMn catalyst with an atomic-scale mixing in nanoparticles of Cu and Co by the oxalate co-precipitation route, which presented excellent selectivity of long-chain terminal alcohols (C8-C14OH) through CO hydrogenation [22]. Currently, most of the investigations about the CuCo catalysts are aimed at further enhancing catalytic activity and higher alcohols selectivity. Nevertheless, a wide distribution of higher alcohols (C2-C6 terminal alcohols) is generally overlooked, which is uneconomical and inconvenient for the separation of production. Undoubtedly, this unfavorable influence limits the large-scale industrial production of ethanol or other single higher alcohol through CO hydrogenation. Therefore, the CuCo-based catalyst should be designed and optimized to narrow the distribution of alcohols and improve HA selectivity, especially ethanol selectivity in the CO hydrogenation reaction. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with the general formula [M 1−x 2+M x 3+(OH)2] x+ [An−] x/n ·mH2O, known as anionic clays or hydrotalcite-like compounds, a unique synthetic two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured materials with metal cations (M2+ and M3+) distributed in a uniform manner in brucite-like layer, are a class of individual catalyst precursors for supported metal catalysts with high density and homogeneous distribution of active sites [23–26]. Meanwhile, a topological transformation of LDH precursors can offer the benefits of synergistic catalysis between mixed metal oxides, and enhance catalytic activity and stability [25]. Besides, as an efficient promoter, Mn element has been widely employed to improve the selectivity of higher alcohols in alkali-metal-modified Cu-based and Co-based systems in the CO hydrogenation reaction [22,27–29]. With this background we developed a CuCoMn catalyst with a “spherical-platelike” nanosized particles structure derived from LDH precursor, which turned out to be an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of ethanol and higher alcohols during CO hydrogenation reaction. The SEM-EDX line spectra, HRTEM and HAADF-STEM results confirmed the unique “spherical-platelike” structure with a CuMn-rich sphere structure and a Co-dominated nanosheet. The resulting CuCoMn catalyst demonstrated a significant enhancement of selectivity to total alcohols of 46.2% and a narrow alcohol distribution of C1-C3 mixed terminal alcohols of 91.4%, in which ethanol accounted for 45.4%. In order to better cognize and design the highly active catalyst for heterogeneous CO hydrogenation to ethanol and HA, the unique catalyst structure and physicochemical properties were discussed in detail and associated with corresponding intrinsic catalytic performance. In addition, a synergistic effect between Cu+ and metallic Co active sites with different functionalities over CuCoMn catalyst was investigated by in situ XPS, NAP-XPS and in situ DRIFT characterizations."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Preparation of the structured CuCoMn x Al catalysts The CuCoMn x Al precursors with different chemical compositions ((Cu + Co + Mn)/Al = 3, Cu/Co = 2/1, x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5) were synthesized by co-precipitation (CP) method at constant pH. In a typical synthetic procedure, a mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (M2+ = 0.06 mol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (M3+ = 0.02 mol) was dissolved in 300 mL of deionized water. A second aqueous solution was acquired by dissolving 0.13 mol NaOH and 0.04 mol Na2CO3 in 300 mL of deionized water. Subsequently, the two solutions were added to the flask simultaneously under continuous magnetic stirring at 85 °C for 24 h. The resulting solid product was filtered, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h in the oven. Finally, the CuCoMn x Al mixed oxides were obtained by calcination of the CuCoMn x Al precursors at 400 °C for 5 h at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 in the muffle furnace. These prepared samples were denoted as CuCo, CuCoMn0.5, CuCoMn1, CuCoMn1.5, CuCoMn2 and CuCoMn2.5, respectively. 2.1.2 Preparation of the structured CuMnAl, CoMnAl, Mn/CuCoAl and CuCoMn/Al2O3 catalysts The CuMnAl and CoMnAl precursors (M2+/M3+ = 3/1, Mn2+ = 1.5, Al3+ = 1) were prepared by the same aforementioned CP method. Subsequently, CuMnAl and CoMnAl catalysts (denoted as CuMn and CoMn) were obtained by calcination of the CuMnAl or CoMnAl precursor at 400 °C for 5 h in the muffle furnace. For controls, the Mn/CuCoAl and CuCoMn/Al2O3 catalysts containing the identical Cu:Co:Mn molar ratio of 1:0.5:1.5 with above mentioned CuCoMn1.5Al sample were synthesized by different preparation routes. The as-synthesized CuCoAl hydrotalcite-like precursor was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Mn(NO3)2. The resulting sample was dried at 100 °C for 12 h after ultrasonic impregnation for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the Mn/CuCoAl precursor was calcined in still air at 400 °C for 5 h. The final catalyst was labelled as Mn/CuCo. In addition, the powdered CuCoMn/Al2O3 catalyst (denoted as CuCoMn-IM) was obtained by calcination of CuCoMn/Al precursor, which was prepared by a traditional co-impregnation protocol (commercial r-Al2O3 as the supported) at room temperature. 2.1.3 Preparation of the structured CuCoMn1.5Al-X catalysts The preparation routes of structured CuCoMn1.5Al-X catalysts (Cu + Co = 1.5, Mn = 1.5, Al = 1) with various Cu/Co ratios (X = 1 and 3) were the same with aforementioned CuCoMn1.5 (Cu/Co = 2, Mn = 1.5, Al = 1) catalyst. Herein, the preparation procedures of these CuCoMn1.5Al-X catalysts (X = 1, 2 and 3) were not depicted specifically and detailedly. These prepared catalysts were denoted as CuCoMn-1, CuCoMn-2 (namely CuCoMn1.5) and CuCoMn-3, respectively. It is worth noting that the chemical composition of the CuCoMn1.5, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM catalyst is the same, so the CuCoMn1.5 (or CuCoMn-2) is labelled as CuCoMn. Table S1 in the Supplementary Material provides an explanation of the codes of all prepared catalysts in relation to the synthesis route and nominal catalyst composition."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the samples were collected at room temperature using a Rigaku D/max 2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 0.1546 nm) source at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2 theta angle range from 5 to 85°. In situ XRD was performed to study the structural evolution of catalyst during reduction process (room temperature to 400 °C, 10% H2/N2). The in situ reduced sample refers to the reduction of calcined catalyst at 400 °C for 1 h in 10% H2/N2 atmosphere. Temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) was performed in a chemisorption instrument (TP-5080, Tianjin Xianquan Corporation). The calcined catalyst (0.03 g) was pre-treated at 200 °C for 1 h under N2 flow (30 mL min−1), and then cooled to room temperature. Afterwards, the reduction process was recorded with the temperature ramping up from room temperature to 800 °C at 5 °C min−1 under 10% H2/N2 flow of 30 mL min−1. Hydrogen chemisorption was performed on ASAP 2010C Micromeritics equipment and the hydrogen consumption was monitored by TCD. The sample (0.1 g) was pretreated in the flow of 10% H2/Ar at 400 °C for 1 h, cooled to 100 °C and maintained at 100 °C for 1 h under H2 atmosphere. Then, the profile was recorded from 100 °C to 500 °C in the flow of Ar. The dispersion of Co was calculated by total amount of adsorbed H2 by assuming H/Co = 1. DCo = 1.179X/W × 100%, where X = total H2 uptake in micromoles per gram of catalyst, W = the Co wt% determined by XRF. The Co surface area was calculated from site densities of 6.83 × 10−2 nm2 for Co atom. The multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements and pore structure of reduced catalysts were recorded at −196 °C on a Quantachrome SI series equipment. Prior to each measurement, the reduced catalyst was degassed in vacuum at 200 °C for 4 h. The metallic copper surface area (SCu 0) was calculated by N2O titration method. The catalyst was reduced in a 10% H2/Ar atmosphere from 30 °C to 400 °C and keeping for a certain time, and then the corresponding consumption of hydrogen amount (X) was recorded. Then it was cooled to 50 °C and followed by purging with N2O flow for 20 min for oxidation of surface Cu to Cu2O. Finally, the sample was reduced under 10% H2/Ar with the temperature increasing from 50 °C to 220 °C at 10 °C min−1, and H2 consumption amount (Y) was monitored. The dispersion of Cu (DCu 0) and exposed metallic Cu surface area (SCu 0) were calculated as follows: DCu 0 = (2Y/X) × 100%, SCu 0 = 2 × Y × Nav/(X × MCu × 1.4 × 1019) = 1353 × Y/X(m2/gCu), where Nav = Avogadro’s constant, MCu = Cu relative atomic mass, 1.4 × 1019 derived from that an identical abundance of an average Cu surface atom area of 0.0711 nm2. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) was performed using the E3 Tiger XRF spectrometer equipped with a Si drift detector to obtain the bulk composition of sample. The in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (in situ XPS) and Cu LMM Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) measurements were performed under ultrahigh vacuum (<10−6 Pa) using a SPECS Phoibos 150 instrument equipped with Al Kα (hv = 1486.6 eV). Prior to XPS profiles were recorded, the calcined catalysts were in situ reduced with 10% H2/N2 flow at 400 °C for 1 h in the pre-treatment chamber. Then, the reduced samples were put into the analytic cell, and all elemental photoelectron lines were collected. The binding energy (BE) values were calibrated using the adventitious C1s peak at 284.6 eV as the reference. The near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) measurement was performed at a SPECS Phoibos 150 setup. The XPS spectra were collected on the reaction conditions of 0.4 mbar syngas (H2/CO = 2) at 100 °C, 230 °C, 270 °C and 310 °C for 1 h. A detailed analysis of C 1s core level spectra was recorded in order to acquire a direct identification of the surface species. The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm−1 with 64 averaged scans using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. Prior to each measurement, about 20 mg calcined catalyst was loaded in an infrared cell with KBr windows. Firstly, the catalyst was reduced online at 400 °C for 1 h in a 10% H2/N2 flow (15 mL min−1), followed by purging with Ar flow (25 mL min−1) at 400 °C for 30 min, and then the temperature was cooled down to 270 °C in the Ar flow with a background spectrum recorded. Then, the gaseous CO was poured into the infrared cell at 270 °C for 30 min and removed for several minutes with Ar flow at the room temperature (RT) or 270 °C. Simultaneously, the corresponding spectra were recorded. In order to reveal a discrepancy of CO absorption on active sites at different temperature, the gaseous CO was introduced into the infrared cell range from RT to 350 °C. The catalyst sample was pretreated in the same means as previously mentioned. Subsequently, the CO adsorption spectra were collected as gaseous CO continued to pour into the reaction cell for 5 min at different temperature and referenced to the corresponding background spectra. The morphology of the sample was determined with a JSM-7001F scanning electron microscope (SEM) instrument with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) at an operating voltage of 10–15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, high-angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mappings were measured by the means of JEOL JEM-2100F with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Before the measurement, the sample powder was ultrasonically dispersed in anhydrous ethanol and supported on a carbon coated 200 mesh molybdenum grid."
4,Catalytic performance,"2.3 Catalytic performance Carbon monoxide hydrogenation catalytic test was performed in a stainless steel fixed-bed reactor (15 mm in diameter). The fresh catalyst (1.5 g, 30–40 mesh) was diluted with silica sand of 30–40 mesh before being transferred to the reactor tube. Prior to the catalytic test, each fresh catalyst was situ reduced in the flow of 10% hydrogen-in-nitrogen mixture (30 mL min−1) under atmospheric pressure at 400 °C for 5 h. After the reduction, the reactor was cooled down to 230–310 °C, and a synthesis gas feedstock mixture (H2/CO = 2) at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 7500 h−1 (GHSV without consisting of SiO2 inert) was poured into the reactor to pressurize to 2.5 MPa. The gas stream leaving the reactor were analyzed online by GC4000A (carbon molecular sieves column), equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD), employed to analyze H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. The organic gas products, e.g. C1-C5 hydrocarbons and methanol, were analyzed online in a GC4000A (GDX-403 column) connected to a flame ionization detector (FID). The water and methanol products were measured by a GC4000A (GDX-401 column) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Total alcohol products in the liquid phase were analyzed by a GC-7AG (Chromosorb 101) with a flame ionization detector (FID). Steady catalytic activities and products selectivities were obtained after stabilization for 12 h on stream. The calculated carbon balance values for catalytic tests are all in the range of 100 ± 3%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural and morphological characteristics of catalysts,"3.1 Structural and morphological characteristics of catalysts XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 a revealed the structure of CuMn-LDH, CoMn-LDH, CuCo-LDH and CuCoMn x -LDH (x = 0.5, 1.5, 2.5) hydrotalcite presursors, which were synthesized by co-precipitation (CP) method. Apart from CuCoMn2.5-LDH precursor, typical diffraction peaks were observed in all precursors at 2 theta = 11.7° and 23.7°, which were attributed to (0 0 3) and (0 0 6) basal crystal planes in the hydrotalcite structure with a rhombohedral symmetry (R3), respectively [25,30]. The lattice parameter c = 3d(0 0 3) values were calculated in the range of 2.25–2.27 nm, indicating that the interlayer anion was carbonate in each LDH structure. The structure of precursor was affected by the content of Mn in the CuCoMnx samples. In the case of CuCo and CuCoMn0.5 precursors, no other crystalline impurity phase was found, suggesting that no Mn or low Mn content exerted negligible effect on the main hydrotalcite crystalline phase. As for CuCoMn2.5 sample, only characteristic reflections of rhodochrosite phase (MnCO3) was detected, and no obvious hydrotalcite structure was observed. This result indicated that the higher Mn content disturbed the crystallization of the LDH structure. As we expected, the hydrotalcite structure and rhodochrosite phase coexisted in the CuCoMn1.5 precursor (moderate Mn content). Meanwhile, the obvious diffraction peaks of CuMnO2 phase were found at 2 theta values of 33.4°, 56.1° and 66.9°. It should be noticed that characteristic reflections of (1 1 0) and (1 1 3) basal planes of hydrotalcite structure were hard to recognize in the CuMn-LDH sample, resulting from the Jahn-Teller effect in Cu2+ (d9 configuration) ion, commonly observed in the Cu2+ LDH systems [31,32]. As shown in Fig. 1b, after calcination in still air at 400 °C, the hydrotalcite structure of these precursors transformed to the mixed metal oxides phase. For comparison, a Mn/CuCo catalyst with an identical element ratio of CuCoMn1.5 catalyst was prepared by a protocol of subsequent impregnation of as-synthesized CuCo nanosheets. As for CuCo catalyst, the strong diffraction peaks at 2 theta = 35.5° and 38.9° and weak reflection peaks at 2 theta values of 36.8°, 44.8°, 58.4° and 65.2° were observed, indicating the presence of CuO (JCPDS 65-2309) and Co3O4 spinel (JCPDS 65-3103), respectively. When the Mn element was introduced into the CuCo system (CuCoMn0.5 and Mn/CuCo), the diffraction peaks for Co3O4 became relatively broader and weaker and the reflection peaks of CuO disappeared, indicating a well-dispersed Co and Cu species. As for CuCoMn2.5 catalyst, the weak intensity of reflection peaks of CoMnCuO x spinel were detected, suggesting a higher content Mn may result in a strong interaction between CoCu and rhodochrosite (MnCO3) in the process of calcination. Notably, the strong diffraction peaks of CuMnO2 were still retained after its parent CuCoMn1.5 precursor calcined in the air. In the case of CuMn and CoMn catalysts, the relatively weak characteristic peaks of CuMnO2 and Co3O4 spinel were observed, respectively. The XRD patterns of the in situ reduced CuCo, CuCoMn and Mn/CuCo catalysts were displayed in Fig. 1c. As for in situ reduced CuCo sample, several strong reflection peaks at 2 theta = 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1° were indexed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) lattice planes of cubic metallic Cu phase (JCPDS 04-0836), respectively. Besides, no obvious diffraction peaks of Co species were observed in all reduced samples, indicating the Co species were too tiny to be detected after the reduction process. Compared with in situ reduced CuCo catalyst, the weaker diffraction peaks of metallic Cu were found in the in situ reduced Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn catalysts, suggesting a higher dispersion of metallic copper. The Cu crystallite sizes of all in situ reduced samples were calculated through Scherrer equation. The Cu particle size followed the trend CuCo (15.9 nm) > Mn/CuCo (10.7 nm) > CuCoMn (9.5 nm). In addition, as for the in situ reduced CuCoMn sample, the strong reflection peaks at 2 theta values of 34.9°, 40.5°, 58.7° and 70.2° were assigned to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) crystal planes of MnO (JCPDS 07-0230). This phenomenon indicated a well-dispersed Cu and large (aggregated) MnO particles were presented in the reduced CuCoMn sample, which will be discussed in the following sections. In order to further investigate structural transformation of calcined catalysts during the reduction process, the in situ XRD technique was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 , the mixed oxides structure of the calcined CuCo, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn samples remained stable below 100 °C in the 10% H2/N2 atmosphere. As for CuCo catalyst, only the characteristic peaks of metallic Cu phase were observed at 200 °C, and the intensity of Cu diffraction peaks increased slightly with the elevated temperature during the reduction process. The metallic Cu phase and MnO phase were obviously detected in Mn/CuCo sample at 200 °C. However, as for CuCoMn sample, the evident characteristic peaks of Cu and MnO were presented at a higher reduction temperature (300 °C), suggesting the existence of stronger interaction between Cu and Mn species. Up to 400 °C, the Cu phase and MnO phase in the three samples were stable within 1 h during reduction process. The morphologies of CuMn, CoMn, CuCo and CuCoMn x hydrotalcite precursors were revealed by SEM in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3a–d, large amounts of randomly oriented platelike microcrystals were clearly observed in the CuMn, CoMn, CuCo and CuCoMn0.5 hydrotalcite precursors. Numerous agglomerations of grain particles and a small amount of nanosheets on the surface were found in the CuCoMn2.5 precursor, accorded with the XRD result (only rhodochrosite structure). It is worth mentioning that a novel “spherical-platelike” nanosized particles structure of CuCoMn1.5 precursor was clearly observed in Fig. 3e. The platelike structure was a typical representative of hydrotalcite precursor, meanwhile the spherical nanoparticles were revealed by the corresponding EDX line spectra (Fig. 3h), which showed the primary element composition of Cu and Mn. Additionally, aggregations of granulum and no obvious nanosheets were detected in the Mn/CuCo precursor (Fig. 3g), indicating the protocol of subsequent impregnation of as-synthesized CuCo nanosheets was unfavorable for remaining a hydrotalcite structure. The morphologies of the calcined CuCo and CuCoMn catalysts were displayed in Fig. S1. The calcined catalysts all exhibited a similar appearance and size with their parent precursors. In order to further demonstrate the distinct microstructural information of the reduced CuCo, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn catalysts, the TEM and STEM-EDX characterizations were employed. As shown in Figs. 4 and S2, the different preparation strategies (the methods of Mn introduction) of the catalyst clearly influenced the architectural feature and size distribution of particles. Compared with reduced CuCo catalyst, a slightly smaller particle size (7–8 nm) was observed over the reduced Mn/CuCo catalyst. As shown in aforementioned SEM images (Figs. 3e and S1b), the unique “spherical-platelike” nanostructure of reduced CuCoMn catalyst (Fig. 4e) still remained after calcination and reduction processes. There was an intimate contact between the large spherical particles (a diameter of 110–160 nm), consisting of small nanoparticles (6–13 nm), and some nanosheets (Figs. 4e and S3a). The sole platelike nanosized particles structure (absence of spherical structure) of reduced CuCoMn catalyst is shown in Fig. 4f, and the particle size (Fig. S2c) was in the range from 4 to 10 nm (peaking at 7 nm). Furthermore, the elemental mappings of reduced CuCo, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn samples determined by HAADF-STEM and EDX analysis were depicted in Fig. 4b, d and g. As for reduced CuCo or Mn/CuCo catalysts, the homogeneous distribution of copper and cobalt or copper, cobalt and manganese was legibly detected (Fig. 4b and d). Quite strikingly, a different nanospatial distribution of Cu, Co, Mn and Al elements was obviously discovered over the spherical and platelike nanoparticles structure (Fig. 4g). Specifically, the reduced CuCoMn catalyst provided a “spherical-platelike” chemical structure: major amounts of Cu and MnO nanoparticles forming the sizeable sphere and Co-dominated nanosheet (including alumina support). Meanwhile, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the large sphere nanoparticles over reduced CuCoMn sample uncovered the presence of interlayer distance of 0.209 nm and 0.256 nm, which were attributed to the lattice planes of Cu (1 1 1) and MnO (1 1 1), respectively (Fig. S3b) [33,34]. The corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) also corroborated the crystal plane (1 1 1) of Cu and MnO (inset Fig. S3b). Based on systematic analysis of structural and morphological results, a “spherical-platelike” structure model of the reduced CuCoMn catalyst is clearly shown in Fig. 4h."
7,Evaluation of catalytic performance,"3.2 Evaluation of catalytic performance In order to gain the best catalytic performance, we developed the ternary systems (CuCoMn, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM) and started by comparing these with binary systems (CuMn, CoMn, and CuCo). As shown in Table 1 , these comparisons were exhibited in terms of activity and selectivity. As for CuMn and CoMn catalysts, the primary products were the alcohols (mostly methanol) with a selectivity of 62.9% and alkanes with a selectivity of 73.3%, respectively. Besides, an enhanced activity (36.2%) and higher alcohols (HA) selectivity (22.3%) were observed over CuCo catalyst, proving the advantage of synergistic catalysis of Cu and Co for HA synthesis other than CuMn or CoMn system. Subsequently, Mn element was incorporated into the selected CuCo system with identical content by distinct preparation routes to gain the CuCoMn, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM catalysts. Among these catalysts, the CuCoMn catalyst presented relatively high CO conversion (29.7%) and the highest total alcohols (ROH) selectivity (46.2%). Meanwhile the fraction of HA exceeded the 70% level, and the fraction of ethanol reached up to 45.4% among the total alcohols products. Fig. 5 a provided a comparison of CO conversion and selectivity to various product classes at P = 2.5 MPa, T = 270 °C and GHSV = 7500 h−1 for CuCoMn x catalysts. For the ternary CuCoMn x (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5) catalysts, the CO conversion decreased with the increasing Mn content from x = 0.5 to 2.5, indicating Mn element turned out to be a poor ability for CO conversion. While the ROH selectivity enhanced from 42.4% for CuCoMn0.5 to the maximum value of 46.2% for the optimal CuCoMn1.5 catalyst and then decreased to 16.9% for the CuCoMn2.5 catalyst. According to Fig. 5b, the CuCoMn1.5 catalyst also provided the optimum value of fractions of HA and ethanol. In the present case, the CO2 selectivity was extremely low (<5%) for all CuCoMn x catalysts. We further investigated the effect of reaction temperature from 230 °C to 310 °C on the catalytic performance of optimal CuCoMn catalyst (Fig. 5c). The CO conversion increased slightly at the relatively low temperature region (230–250 °C), and then enhanced dramatically from 250 °C to 310 °C, resulting from a more powerful ability of CO dissociation at elevated temperature [22,35]. It was also clearly observed from Fig. 5c that the decreased ROH selectivity entailed an enhancement of hydrocarbon for CuCoMn catalyst. However, the selectivity of ethanol or HA presented a distinguishable trend with ROH selectivity (Fig. S4a). Although a high ROH selectivity of 56.1% was observed at 230 °C, the poor ethanol fraction of 26.9% and C2+ alcohols fraction of 44.1% were found, respectively. An excellent ethanol or HA selectivity was obtained at medium temperature of 270 °C among all products (including gas and liquid). Besides, CO2 is an unwanted by-product but always reported to be untoward to control [36,37]. Under situation of enhancing CO conversion (Fig. 5c), an increased CO2 production was always related to the generation of the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O = CO2 + H2). Nevertheless, in the present case, an obvious enhancement of CO conversion above 250 °C exerted inconspicuous changes in the CO2 production. Therefore, changing product selectivity patterns at different temperature may attribute to an intrinsic kinetic effect of the CO hydrogenation reaction, rather than to the water-gas shift reaction mentioned above. Besides, the effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on catalytic performance was shown in Fig. S4b. As expected, the CO conversion decreased with increasing GHSV, and the distribution of ethanol exhibited a volcanic curve with maximum value of 45.4% at 7500 h−1. The catalytic activity and products selectivities as a function of time on stream over CuCoMn catalyst were tested at an optimal condition (Fig. 5d). No obvious reduction of catalytic activity and ROH selectivity was observed in the 96 h of the time on stream experiment. The catalytic performance of CuCoMn-X catalysts with various Cu/Co relative molar ratios (X = 1, 2 and 3) was depicted in Fig. S4c and d. Compared with CuCoMn-1 and CuCoMn-3 catalysts, the CuCoMn-2 catalyst (Cu/Co = 2/1) clearly exhibited an excellent catalytic performance for ethanol synthesis, and the similar Cu/Co ratio was also observed in our previous optimal CuCo system [21]. Table 2 compared the catalytic activity, total alcohols selectivity and ethanol selectivity of CuCoMn catalyst with other represented CuCo-based catalysts in the CO hydrogenation reaction. Notably, comparing with other catalysts, the CuCoMn catalyst exhibited a superior activity and selectivity to ethanol in the current study."
8,Analysis and discussion of structure-activity relationship,"3.3 Analysis and discussion of structure-activity relationship For the sake of revealing the underlying structure-activity relationship existing in the CuCoMn x , CuMn, CoMn, CuCo, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM catalysts, systematic characterization measurements containing of BET, H2-TPR, in situ XPS and in situ CO-DRIFT were performed. Fig. S5 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves of reduced CuCo, CuCoMn x , Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM catalysts. According to the IUPAC classification, these isotherms were the typical adsorption profile of type-IV [13,45]. Fig. S5b shows a distribution of pore size of these reduced catalysts. As for reduced CuCo and CuCoMn x catalysts, a wide pore size distribution was obviously observed, resulting from the stacking of LDH nanosheets. As shown in Table 3 , the reduced CuCoMn catalyst exhibited the largest BET specific surface of 70.2 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.32 cm3 g−1, which would be beneficial for the improvement of the catalytic performance. The measured bulk compositions of CuCo, CuCoMn and Mn/CuCo samples attained by XRF technique were approximate to the nominal values (Table 4 ). Compared with CuCo and Mn/CuCo catalysts, the CuCoMn catalysts presented the largest metallic Cu surface area (55.73 m2 g−1) and Co surface area (7.10 m2 g−1). These above mentioned phenomena indicated that the unique “spherical-platelike” structure may lead to the largest surface area of Cu and Co species, which was beneficial for the improvement of ethanol production [46]. Fig. 6 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the calcined CuCo, CuCoMn x and Mn/CuCo catalysts, which is applied to illuminate the redox information and the interaction between mixed metal oxides. As for CuCo catalyst, a broad H2 consumption peak accompanied by a shoulder peak in the temperature range of 180–300 °C was observed. This indicated that Cu species existed in diverse chemical environments, resulting in different reduction temperatures. The lower shoulder peak at 212 °C and the higher main peak centered at 262 °C were displayed, which was attributed to the reduction of high dispersion of surface CuO nanoparticle and bulk CuO phase, respectively [21,47]. A similar profile of reduction peaks was found over CuCoMn0.5 catalyst, but the main reduction peak shifted slightly toward a lower temperature (258 °C). However, the CuCoMn1.5 catalyst displayed an asymmetric broad reduction peak with a lower reduction temperature (212 °C) and a higher reduction temperature (277 °C), ascribed to the reduction of surface CuO phase and CuMnO2 species. This phenomenon indicated a strong interaction between Cu and Mn species, which resulted in a higher reduction temperature of Cu species. Besides, a higher main reduction peak centered at 342 °C, attributed to a dope of Mn and Co species into CuO phase (XRD showed the CoMnCuO x phase), was observed over the CuCoMn2.5 catalyst. Compared with CuCoMn catalyst, the Mn/CuCo sample displayed a lower and sharper reduction peak (269 °C), indicating a relatively weak interaction existed between Cu and Mn species, which was consistent with XRD results (no conspicuous CuMn mixed oxides phase). On a whole, H2-TPR characterization provided the straightforward information of the strong interaction existed between Cu and Mn species over CuCoMn catalyst, which was responsible for the CuMnO2 phase synthesis, and its role will be discussed in the following section. The in situ XRD, HHADF-STEM and H2-TPR characterizations have presented the occurrence of strong interaction between Cu and Mn elements in the CuCoMn catalyst, which results in a positive effect for ethanol synthesis. For the sake of further revealing the nature of the interaction and acquiring the compositions and oxidation states of surface active species of these catalysts, the XPS technique was performed. The Cu 2p XPS spectra with fitting curves (Fig. 7 ) of freshly calcined CuCo, CuCoMn and Mn/CuCo catalysts all showed a main peak at around 934.5 eV with the 2p → 3d satellite peak between 941 eV and 944 eV, which solely related to Cu species in the +2 oxidation state [28,48]. Besides, various studies [28,49–52] presented that the position of these peaks was linked to chemical composition of the sample, crystalline structure and coordination situation of Cu2+. Li and Lenglet et al. [49,53] have reported Cu 2p3/2 binding energy (BE) in relation with its tetrahedral environment of CuA 2+ at a higher BE value (934–936 eV) and octahedral environment of CuB 2+ at a lower BE value (around 933 eV). As a result, the quantitative analysis of Cu 2p3/2 signals for calcined CuCo, CuCoMn and Mn/CuCo catalyst are shown in Table 5 . As shown in the table, the content of tetrahedrally coordinated CuA 2+ cations was enhanced after introduction of Mn element into the CuCo system, resulting from a strong interaction between Cu species and Mn species, and thus forming the CuMn spinel structure in the mixed metal oxides [49]. Compared with calcined Mn/CuCo catalyst, the calcined CuCoMn catalyst exhibited a higher content of CuA 2+, which indicated an embodiment of CuMnO2 structure, in agreement with aforesaid XRD and H2-TPR results. As shown in Fig. S6, the Cu 2p3/2 BE value shifted down to a lower value around 932.5 eV and the shake-up satellite peak vanished of all in situ reduced catalysts, which were the characteristics of Cu species in lower oxidation states (Cu0 or Cu+) [45,54]. Furthermore, the discrimination of Cu0 and Cu+ was obtained via Cu LMM Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) spectra of in situ reduced samples in Fig. 8 . It was clearly observed that each Cu LMM spectrum included multiple components as inferred by the asymmetrical and broad peak, which was deconvoluted into two symmetrical peaks centered at around 918 eV and 916 eV, corresponding to Cu0 and Cu+ species, respectively [45,55,56]. Meanwhile, a modified Cu Auger parameters α′Cu, which stands for the summation of binding energy (BE) of Cu 2p3/2 photoelectron and kinetic energy (KE) of Cu LMM Auger electron, were calculated in Table 6 . In general, the value of α′Cu is ca. 1851.0 eV assigned for Cu0 and ca. 1849.0 eV for Cu+ [55]. From the deconvolution of Cu LMM peak results, introduction of Mn with distinct methods greatly influenced the surface distribution of Cu+ and Cu0, which a higher ratio (68.6%) of surface Cu+/(Cu0 + Cu+) was observed over reduced CuCoMn sample (Fig. 8 and Table 6). This phenomenon was speculated to be resulted from a strong interaction between Cu species and Mn species, which exerted a relatively high affinity for electrons. Herein, this caused a lower degree of reduction of surface Cu species with a partial positive charge for the reduced CuCoMn catalyst. Co 2p photoemission spectra for calcined and in situ reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 a and b, respectively. The calcined CuCo, CuCoMn and Mn/CuCo catalysts all showed the spin-orbit doublets of Co 2p1/2 at ca. 795.5 eV and Co 2p3/2 at ca. 780.0 eV, which was assigned to the presence of Co3O4 spinel [31,57]. After in situ reduction (Fig. 9b), the binding energy of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were all shifted to lower values at 793.1 eV and 778.1 eV, which were the characteristic of metallic cobalt [58,59]. Meanwhile, a high binding energy peak at 780.9 eV was observed over all reduced samples, which was assigned to the presence of CoO species [59]. The binding energy peak of CoO was more pronounced in the reduced CuCo samples, whereas the binding energy intensity of CoO for reduced CuCoMn or Mn/CuCo sample overtly decreased. This indicated that the content of Co0 was higher in Mn-modified CuCo catalysts, resulting from a relatively weak interaction between Cu species (or Mn species) and Co species. According to the XPS spectra of in situ reduced CuCo, CuCoMn and Mn/CuCo catalysts, the molar ratios between relevant elements on the catalysts surface after reduction were accessed by calculating the relative amount of Cu, Co and Mn elements. Seen from the data listed in Table S2, compared with CuCo sample, the ternary CuCoMn and Mn/CuCo samples all showed a pronounced increase of Cu/Co ratio, proving that some Cu atoms migrate from the bulk ternary CuCoMn system to the surface of catalysts. Furthermore, the reduced CuCoMn catalyst demonstrated a higher surface (Cu + Mn)/Al molar ratio than reduced Mn/CuCo catalyst, which further indicated the presence of CuMn spheres structure possibly stemmed from the simultaneous migration of Cu and Mn atoms. The aggregation of Cu species on the surface of reduced samples may provide more active sites for associative CO for the synthesis of alcohols. In addition, the reduced CuCoMn sample demonstrated a higher Co/Mn ratio, indicating a stronger ability of chain propagation. These results clearly revealed an excellent synergistic catalysis effect of Cu and Co species for ethanol synthesis based on a well-balanced of associative CO and chain propagation. Furthermore, in situ DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption is a surface-sensitive characterization method to obtain the surface active sites of heterogeneous catalysts. Fig. 10 showed the in situ DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption during CO flow at 270 °C for 30 min and then in the Ar at room temperature for several minutes over reduced CuCo, CuCoMn x (x = 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5), Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM catalysts. In the CO flow at 270 °C, the reduced catalysts all demonstrated the evident absorption at 2174 and 2115 cm−1 on the top of the doublet for gas phase CO [60,61]. Moreover, the absorption bands around 1981 and 1987 cm−1 over a series of CuCoMn x catalysts could be ascribed to CO bound in bridging geometries to neighboring low-coordinated metallic Co atoms at steps, edges and corners of the particles [62]. In order to eliminate the effect of gaseous CO on the surface of the catalysts, the bands were recorded after removing CO by Ar for several minutes. Under continuous evacuation of gas phase CO at room temperature, the CO absorption peak at a higher value of 2174 cm−1 progressively disappeared, whereas the peak centered at 2115 cm−1 decreased or enhanced in size but eventually became steady. Notably, all peaks centered at 2115 cm−1 shifted slightly toward lower frequencies (2107–2114 cm−1) under Ar flow, resulting from an effect of decreasing CO coverage. These peaks were generally assigned to the adsorbed CO on Cu species. As for intensity of CO adsorption, the reduced CuCo, CuCoMn0.5, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM catalysts all presented a weak CO adsorption on Cu species in the case of Ar flushing; however, a strong CO adsorption on Cu species was observed over the reduced CuCoMn1.5 sample. It has been reported that CO adsorption onto Cu0 and Cu2+ sites is usually weak and reversible at room temperature. Besides, the linear CO adsorption on Cu+ sites has a higher thermal stability than linear CO on Cu0 and Cu2+ species (Cu0-CO and Cu2+-CO complexes) [56,63,64]. According to these viewpoints, the intense band centered at 2107 cm−1 (Fig. 10c) in reduced CuCoMn1.5 catalyst was assigned to linear CO adsorbed on Cu+ sites, which exhibited a strong resistance to flushing. The intensity of CO adsorption on Cu species (Cu+-CO) over the reduced CuCoMn1.5 catalyst, as we said before, was higher than that of reduced CuCo, CuCoMn0.5, Mn/CuCo and CuCoMn-IM catalysts, in agreement with the in situ XPS result that a higher concentration of Cu+ species was found in the CuCoMn1.5 catalyst. Interestingly, although the reduced CuCoMn2.5 sample also presented a strong CO adsorption intensity on Cu+ species, the catalytic performance (ethanol selectivity) was not ideal, indicating the solitary Cu+ species could not provide the catalytically active sites for the selective synthesis of ethanol. In addition, the characteristic bridged adsorption bands of CO (1981–1995 cm−1) on adjacent metallic Co species were detected in Ar flushing after 9 min at room temperature in all catalysts. Compared with CO stretching frequency of reduced CuCoMn2.5 (1995 cm−1), Mn/CuCo (1987 cm−1) and CuCoMn-IM (1995 cm−1) samples, the lowest CO stretching frequency (1981 cm−1) was observed over reduced CuCoMn1.5 catalyst, indicating the weakest CO π bonds, which was ascribed to an enhanced electron back-donation from d orbitals of Co to the antibonding π*orbitals of CO [21,60,62]. Then, the weakest CO π bonds resulted in the easiest cleavage of CO bond, and thus facilitating the CO activation and CH x intermediates generation, which is an indispensable prerequisite for ethanol synthesis. Furthermore, the reduced CuCoMn1.5 catalyst also showed a stronger intensity of bridge adsorption for CO on metallic Co, suggesting that more CO adsorbed on the Co active sites, which may provide an increment of CH x intermediates concentration. Therefore, a synergetic effect between Cu+ and metallic Co active sites with different functionalities was proposed here, in which the incremental CO adsorption on Cu+ active sites promoted the CO insertion probability and enhancement of CO bridge adsorption on metallic Co species accelerated the chain growth probability and subsequent ethanol and high alcohols formation. To gain more insight into the behaviours of CO adsorption on Cu species and Co species at different reaction temperature, the in situ DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption were recorded over reduced CuCoMn catalyst during CO flow upon increasing temperature from room temperature to 350 °C (Fig. 11 a, A-I). The CO adsorption on Cu+ species at 2111 cm−1 obviously decreased in intensity with the increasing temperature and became relatively stable above 250 °C, indicating a low thermal stability of CO adsorption on Cu+ species below 250 °C. Remarkably, the DRIFT peak for linear CO adsorption on metallic Co appeared at 2056 cm−1 below 100 °C, and then disappeared at a higher temperature; however, the strength of bridge CO adsorption on metallic Co species slightly enhanced as the temperature increased. Meanwhile, a tiny red-shift of bridge CO adsorption band on metallic Co was detected with increasing temperature, resulting from an easier CO desorbing effect at a higher temperature [60]. As can be seen, when the reaction temperature exceeded 250 °C, the stable and relatively strong CO adsorptions on Cu+ and Co species were both observed, resulting in a pronounced enhancement of CO conversion, in agreement with the catalytic performance in Fig. 5c. Furthermore, the difference in products selectivity performance above 250 °C could be attributed to relative contribution of kinetic and thermodynamic effects. Therefore, the reaction temperature played a significant role in controlling the CO adsorption on Cu+ and metallic Co, which eventually affected the catalytic activity and products selectivity performance in the heterogeneous CO hydrogenation reaction process. In order to further confirm the definite roles of CO adsorbed on Cu+ and Co species, we presented the in situ CO-DRIFT spectra of CuCoMn catalyst during CO flow at 270 °C and then in Ar flushing at 270 °C for (B-K) 1–10 min (Fig. 11b). Obviously, the band at 2111 cm−1 of linear CO adsorption on Cu+ species decreased rapidly in size in the first five minutes and then disappeared in the Ar flow. However, no remarkable changes in intensity of bridge CO adsorption on metallic Co species were observed as time proceeded. Only a red-shifting behaviour of bridge CO adsorption band on Co species was observed, which was attributed to the reducing CO coverage. It must be concluded that the “spherical-platelike” CuCoMn catalyst provided a higher probability of CO adsorption on Cu+ species (Cu+-CO) and Co species (Co-CO), in which a relatively weak interaction of Cu+ sites with CO was related to non-dissociative CO insertion and a relatively strong bridge CO adsorption on Co resulted in the formation of CH x intermediates, and thus forming CH3CH2OH via CH x CO hydrogenation. Therefore, this synergistic effect of Cu+ and Co active sites species was beneficial to improve ethanol selectivity. The relationship between total Cu0 + Co (or Cu+ + Co) sites ratio and ethanol selectivity was depicted in Fig. S7. It was notable that the increasing trend of ethanol selectivity was consistent with the increasing number of total Cu+ and Co active sites, but contrary to the increasing number of total Cu0 and Co active sites. Accordingly, compared with combination of Cu0 and Co active sites, the combination of Cu+ and Co active sites was more beneficial to the synthesis of ethanol in CO hydrogenation reaction. In order to further obtain direct information about adsorbed species on CuCoMn catalyst surface during CO hydrogenation reaction, the near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) measurement was performed. The C 1s spectra were obtained on the conditions of 0.4 mbar syngas (H2/CO = 2) at selected temperature (Fig. 12 ). The broad C 1s peak can be deconvoluted into two symmetrical peaks centered at 286.1 eV and 285.2 eV, which was attributed to chemisorbed CO (non-dissociative CO) and C x H y species (referred as C0) stemmed from CO dissociation, respectively [65]. Therefore, the ratios of CO/C0 were calculated here to ponder the existence of two kinds of C atoms in CO hydrogenation reaction. Namely, the ratios represented the balanced interplay of non-dissociative CO molecules and dissociatively active CO. The ratio of CO/C0 was higher (above 1.0) at lower reaction temperature (100 °C and 230 °C), whereas the ratio decreased (0.6) at higher reaction temperature (310 °C), indicating progressive CO dissociation [66]. This phenomenon is consistent with adsorption behaviour of CO at different temperatures in situ CO DRIFT result (Fig. 11a). The ratio of CO/C0 was 1.0 at 270 °C, suggesting a well-balanced interplay of both CO non-dissociation and dissociation in CO hydrogenation reaction. Hence, the NAP-XPS result provided a direct information that a well-balanced interplay of both CO non-dissociation and dissociation (CO/C0 = 1) was responsible for ethanol synthesis. In recent years, the entire mechanism of HAS from CO hydrogenation to ethanol and higher alcohols (HA) has been extensively studied. A widely accepted general reaction mechanism incorporates four major steps: CO and H2 activation, surface CH x species formation, non-dissociative CO insertion and step-wise hydrogenation to the ethanol and HA [7,61]. As for CuCo system, Cu provides an active site for non-dissociative CO adsorption to produce methanol, and Co acts as an active site for the CO dissociation to form CH x , CH x coupling and hydrogenation to synthesize hydrocarbons [15,20,21]. Herein, non-dissociative CO (CO*) insertion into the CH x is thereafter the pivotal step leading to ethanol. In this work, a higher probability of CO* adsorption on Cu+ species, promoted by the presence of manganese species (MnO), was observed over the “spherical-platelike” CuCoMn system, which offers a favorable prerequisite for CO* insertion into the CH x to production of ethanol. On the basis of the catalytic performance and characterization investigations discussed above, a mechanism of CO hydrogenation to ethanol over the “spherical-platelike” CuCoMn system could be depicted in Fig. 13 . The ternary CuCoMn catalyst exhibits a noteworthy synergistic catalysis of Cu+ and Co active sites species for ethanol synthesis."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we have demonstrated here that ternary “CuCoMn” catalysts can be designed to produce ethanol and higher alcohols with high selectivity during CO hydrogenation. Quite different from the classical co-impregnation catalyst (CuCoMn-IM) and the subsequent impregnated as-synthesized CuCo nanosheets catalyst (Mn/CuCo) with a homogeneous distribution of Cu, Co and Mn species on alumina support, the optimized “CuCoMn” catalyst, which was prepared by introducing Cu, Co and Mn elements simultaneously into the LDH system, presented a specific “spherical-platelike” (CuMn-Co) nanosized particles structure with a CuMn-rich sphere structure and a Co-dominated nanosheet (inducing alumina support). With respect to the catalytic CO hydrogenation performance, the optimized “CuCoMn” catalyst presented a total alcohols (ROH) selectivity (including CO2) of 46.2%, with the fraction of higher alcohols (HA) and ethanol exceeding the 70% and 45% level among the total alcohols products, respectively. The combination of systematic characterizations and evaluated catalytic performance was implemented to illuminate the promoting effect of Mn species to active Cu and Co sites in the ternary CuCoMn system. In situ XRD, H2-TPR and in situ XPS techniques not only presented the strong interaction between Cu and Mn species over the optimum CuCoMn catalyst, but also uncovered a high proportion of Cu+/(Cu0 + Cu+) on catalyst surface. More importantly, in situ DRIFT spectra characterization confirmed a synergetic effect between Cu+ and metallic Co active sites with different functionalities, in which the incremental CO adsorption on Cu+ active sites promoted the CO insertion probability and enhancement of CO bridge adsorption on metallic Co species accelerated the chain growth probability and subsequent ethanol and high alcohols formation. Besides, the NAP-XPS result provided a direct information that a well-balanced interplay of both CO non-dissociation and dissociation (CO/C0 = 1) was responsible for ethanol synthesis. As we have investigated, the “spherical-platelike” CuCoMn catalyst shows a catalytic performance, though not yet perfect, that is obviously superior to reported CuCo catalysts at a benchtop level, and so seems to be considerable underlying for application to the spacious industrial production of ethanol via the CO hydrogenation."
