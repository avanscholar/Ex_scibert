0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the rapid global increase in the human population has resulted in the demand for fossil fuels increasing, especially the consumption of liquid fuels as the major fuels used in the transportation sector. Diesel fuel has been the major liquid fuel used. Global liquid fossil fuel production and consumption trends have been reported by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [1] indicating that the consumption of liquid fossil fuel has increased every year, leading to the depletion of fossil fuels. The depletion of fossil fuels has many global impacts, such as higher fuel prices, a decrease in population numbers, and threatening the sustainability of industrialized countries [2]. The use of fossil fuels is one of the main factors contributing to the emission of greenhouse gasses, such as CO2 that are causing global warming and climate change. To mitigate the climate change situation, three strategies can be considered: (1) conventional mitigation technologies, (2) negative emissions technologies (NETs), and (3) radiative forcing geoengineering (RFG) techniques. The conventional mitigation technologies along with negative emissions technologies offer higher potential pathways that can lead to the achievement of the Paris Agreement. The conventional mitigation technologies can be carried out by decarbonization bioenergy carbon capture and storage in relation to afforestation and reforestation. The use of renewable fuels derived from plants can mitigate global warming via decarbonization as well as bioenergy carbon capture because the plants can capture CO2 for photosynthesis [3]. Thus, the development of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel, has played an important role in the global economy and environmental protection in recent years. Diesel production from biomass can be classified into four generations depending on the source of the biomass feedstock [4,5]. Table 1 shows an overview of the biofuels in the different generations. First-generation biodiesel can be produced from edible oils, such as vegetable oils and fats, via transesterification. Biodiesel has been widely produced due to its simple production process as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In the biodiesel production process, water is a by-product from the reaction having a negative impact on the catalyst activity due to deactivation. For example, in a bio-diesel production process, the silica support catalyst in aqueous media causes Si-O-Si bond hydrolysis, and thereby, reaction activity is decreased. Using zeolites, the presence of water in the reaction causes dealumination drawback and then structural instability [6]. Consequently, the enhancement of hydrophobic properties in catalyst synthesis is necessary, to improve the catalytic activity in biodiesel production. Additionally, one of the issues of using biodiesel is that it cannot be a direct substitution for petroleum diesel due to its poor, cold-flow properties (high cloud point and pour point), high viscosity, low energy content, and high levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds [7-10]. Second-generation diesel or green diesel has been under development using as feedstock non-edible oils, such as energy crops, municipal waste, organic waste, and waste vegetable oil, to produce alternative diesel fuels for petroleum diesel substitution. The diesels produced from non-edible oil and petroleum have similar chemical structures and liquid fuel properties. Nowadays, the production of green diesel biofuel has gained more interest for many reasons, including: (i) high heating value, (ii) high cetane number, (iii) less corrosiveness, and (iv) high oxidative stability due to zero oxygen content [11,12]. Third and fourth generation biodiesel can be produced from algae, with fourth generation processes involving the metabolism of genetically modified algae to achieve a higher oil yield [13]. Normally, biodiesel production from algae has three major steps: harvesting, lipid extraction from the algae, and transesterification of algal lipids. Algal harvesting requires a high-cost photobioreactor to obtain a higher yield of algal lipids. The reactor generally consumes large amounts of energy for cultivation resulting in the higher production cost [14,15]. Hence, second generation green diesel is preferable to biodiesel produced from other generations. Green diesel or bio-hydrogenated diesel has a similar molecular structure to that of petroleum diesel. It can be produced from triglycerides, fatty acids, and their derivatives via deoxygenation to remove oxygen atoms from the oxygenated molecules in the reactant to obtain alkane hydrocarbons. There are several types of triglycerides that can be used for green diesel production, such as non-edible oils [16-22], triolein [23-25], waste cooking oils [26-29], and animal fats [30-33]. Green diesel production from fatty acids, such as stearic acid [34-38], palmitic acid [39-42], oleic acid [43-47], and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) [48-51], consumes less hydrogen compared to using triglyceride as a feedstock because the deoxygenation can directly occur in the initial step without hydrogenolysis [52]. Fatty acids are composed of long hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group (-COOH) and can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The former has single bonded molecules only (-C-C-), such as palmitic acid, whereas the latter have double bonded molecules (-C = C-), such as oleic acid. The molecular structures of some fatty acids are shown in Table 2 [53]. Deoxygenation using an unsaturated fatty acid as the reactant is more complicated than for a saturated fatty acid due to the electron-rich double bonds providing greater reactivity with side reactions occurring more easily (detailed in Section 2 .) [43,54]. Although the deoxygenation reaction can produce green diesel, it is well known that the catalyst is one of the important factors in obtaining high reaction conversion and high selectivity of the main products. The efficiency of green diesel production via deoxygenation depends on the metal active sites on the catalyst. The first group of metal catalysts commonly used is the noble metals, such as palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), and rhodium (Rh), which are favored for green diesel production due to their high reaction activity [67-69]. Although the noble metal catalysts have high activity for green diesel production both with and without hydrogen, there are economic limitations from the high costs flowing on high production costs. The second group of metal catalysts consists of bimetallic catalysts [26,30,34,70], which can be used to increase the activity and stability of the catalyst due to the existence of synergistic interaction between the two metals [58]. The third group is metal oxide compound catalysts, such as sulfide [49,61,71-73], carbide [73-79], phosphide [73,76,80-83], and nitride catalysts [76,78,84]. The fourth group of catalysts is the non-noble metal catalysts, such as Ni [21,47,85], Mo [21,43,74], Mn [25,51], Cu [25,86,87], W [88,89], Co [42,51,90], and Zn [25,91,92]. Although many researchers have reported on many types of suitable catalysts for green diesel production, from the point of view on commercial production, the cost of production is one of many important factors. Therefore, non-noble metal catalysts that can perform as well as noble metals catalysts will lead to cost-effectiveness in production. Among the various non-noble metal catalysts, Ni-based catalysts are the most frequently used due their low cost, good electrical properties, and high reaction performance [93,94]. In recent years, green diesel has become more attractive and many researchers have reported the development of Ni-based catalysts for deoxygenation to produce green diesel. Ni-based catalysts have produced better performance than many noble-metal catalysts. However, there has been no published review of Ni catalysts for green diesel production in recent years. A summary of the recent reviews is provided in Table 3 . The current review summarizes the reaction pathways of green diesel production with different reactants, metal catalysts, and types of catalyst support. The highlights of this work are the consolidation of possible reactions that can occur in green diesel production from many studies into one paper. Subsequently, the focus is on deoxygenation over Ni‐based catalysts in recent years (2019–2020). The parameters that can affect the activity of Ni‐based catalysts to produce green diesel (catalyst preparation method, reactant, support, and operating conditions) are also discussed. Finally, recent progress in deoxygenation over Ni‐based catalysts and future prospects are also provided."
1,Overview of green diesel production,
2,Reaction pathways of green diesel production using different reactants,"2.1 Reaction pathways of green diesel production using different reactants The reaction pathways for green diesel production in the liquid phase are slightly different depending on the feedstock, but deoxygenation will occur primarily. Feedstocks that are commonly used in green diesel production are vegetable oils, animal fats, and organic wastes from industry. These feedstocks consist of one or more of the following substances: triglyceride, fatty acid ester, and free fatty acid compounds. The main components in those feedstocks are summarized in Table 4 . Although green diesel production can use different types of reactants as described above, the reactions in the production process can be a sequence of reactions from the triglyceride reactant to n-alkane products. Possible reaction pathways for green diesel production based on different types of feedstocks from many studies can be demonstrated as shown in Fig. 2 [30,43,80,90,97-99]. For a gas phase reaction, a water-gas shift and a methanation reaction mainly occur because oxygen atoms in hydrocarbons feedstocks are removed from the molecules forming CO, CO2, and H2O. 2.1.1 Triglyceride-based feedstock The reactions involved in green diesel production from vegetable oil and animal fat are usually explained by using the largest amount of triglyceride type in feedstock as a model compound, such as triolein or tristearin [24,25,117-119]. To describe the reaction pathway using triolein as a model compound as shown in Fig. 2, the first step of reaction is the double bond (C = C) in triolein hydrogenated by H2 to form saturated triglyceride followed by hydrogenolysis ( β -elimination) to obtain three molecules of saturated fatty acid and propane, C3H8, (step (b) → (c)) [21,25,113,118,120]. Oxygen atoms in the carboxyl functional group can be removed by deoxygenation both with and without H2. Direct oxygen elimination without H2 is called decarboxylation and produces heptadecane (C17H36) and CO2 (step (m)). In another pathway, saturated fatty acid can be converted to aldehyde compounds using H2 (step (d)). Then the removal of oxygen atoms in aldehyde compounds can occur, which can follow two possible pathways of decarbonylation and/or hydrodeoxygenation. Decarbonylation removes oxygen atom in the carboxaldehyde functional group in the form of CO (step (e)). For hydrodeoxygenation, aldehyde compounds can be converted to alcohol compounds (step (f)), and after that, the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl functional group is removed with H2O (step (g)→(h)). As an example of green diesel production, Moreira et al. (2020) reported on the production of green diesel from Macauba pulp oil using Co metal supported on activated carbon catalysts at 30 bars H2, 350 °C, and 2 h reaction time. The major product was 88% saturated alkanes in the diesel range (C10–C20 hydrocarbons) with 96.25% Macauba pulp oil conversion via the abovementioned reaction pathway [90]. The initial step of the reaction can occur in other pathways. The decomposition of triglyceride in the initial step of the reaction does not only occur following β-elimination but can be in the reaction routes of γ -H migration and β- γ -scission as shown in step (a) in Fig. 2. The γ -H migration pathway occurs during thermal decomposition at high temperature to form alkene products. The β- γ -scission pathway is the scission of CC at the β and γ positions. The products from this route are also alkene compounds [23,33,80]. Scaldaferri et al. (2019) reported green diesel production from soybean oil over an NbOPO4 catalyst at 10 bars H2 and 350 °C, stating that hydrocarbons in the range C9–C17 were the major products composed of 62% bio-jet fuel, 40% green diesel, and 18% gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Furthermore, they found that the initial reaction of triglyceride in soybean oil deoxygenation was γ-H migration, β-γ-scission, and β-elimination in competitive reactions followed by cracking and deoxygenation to produce hydrocarbon products [33]. Another reaction pathway for cracking triglyceride to free fatty acid was proposed by Nasharuddin et al. (2020). The hydrolysis of triglyceride to produce fatty acid and glycerol can occur over Ni–Mg supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes catalysts at a reaction temperature of 350 °C for 2 h under nitrogen gas flow. The reaction route is shown in step (k) [31]. After the free fatty acid is obtained, deoxygenation to remove the oxygen atom will occur. The details are described in the following sections. 2.1.2 Fatty acids-based feedstock Several studies describe possible reaction pathways to remove oxygen atoms in fatty acid. The deoxygenation pathways of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are different. Palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) are commonly used as the model compounds for deoxygenation of saturated fatty acids [34,36,40,97]. The possible reactions of fatty acid are shown in Fig. 2. The initial reaction is hydrogenation of the carboxylic group in stearic acid to form aldehyde compounds (octadecanal) as an intermediate (step (d)). Then, an aldehyde intermediate can be converted via two pathways, decarbonylation (step (e)) and dehydration-hydrogenation (step (f) to (h)). The decarbonylation pathway can directly remove oxygen an atom in the form of carbon monoxide to obtain n-heptadecane. In the dehydration-hydrogenation pathway, octadecanal can be converted into alcohol compounds (octadecanol) followed by oxygen atom removal in the form of water and alkene compounds (octadecene). Then, octadecene can be hydrogenated into alkane compounds (n-octadecane). Liang et al. (2019) investigated the deoxygenation performance of carbon nanotubes supported by a CuCo catalyst to convert stearic acid to long-chain hydrocarbons. The process occurred via the reaction mentioned above and produced 94.82% selectivity of long-chain hydrocarbon products with the complete conversion of stearic acid [97]. However, an improper reaction time caused the cracking of n-alkane compounds resulting in lighter alkanes [37,51,121]. In addition, oleic acid is usually used as a reactant and a model compound for green diesel production because it is the main component in vegetable oil triglycerides, such as palm oil, sunflower oil, and jatropha oil [122,123]. The deoxygenation of unsaturated oleic acid is more complicated than that of saturated fatty acid due to the presence of double bonds. The general reaction pathway of oleic acid in the presence of external hydrogen is shown in Fig. 2. It has been reported by many researchers that the double bonds in unsaturated oleic acid can be hydrogenated to obtain saturated stearic acid, as shown in step (j), followed by decarboxylation, dehydrogenation, and cracking [86,124-127]. For hydrogen-free deoxygenation, direct decarboxylation or decarbonylation and dehydrogenation can occur to produce alkene hydrocarbons in step (l). There are many types of alkene products produced from oleic acid deoxygenation in the absence of hydrogen, such as 1,8-heptadecadiene, 8-heptadecane, and polyunsaturated heptadecene. The alkene products still require a hydrogen atom for hydrogenation to produce alkane [27,43,51]. The hydrogen atoms used in the reaction can come not only from external hydrogen gas but can also be from gas phase reaction, or a metal catalyst, solvent, or supports [24,33,128]. 2.1.3 Fatty acids ester-based feedstock In addition to triglycerides and fatty acids compounds, esters compounds, such as ethyl palmitate can also be used as reactants for green diesel production [87,88,129,130]. The initial reaction of ethyl palmitate can be converted via two pathways—hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation—as shown in steps (n) and (o), respectively. The ethyl palmitate hydrogenolysis using H2O to cleave the CO bond can produce free fatty acids followed by deoxygenation, which is similar to the fatty acids deoxygenation described above. Ethyl palmitate can be hydrogenated by cleavage of the CO bond in an ester to form alcohol and aldehyde compounds. These aldehyde compounds can be converted via two pathways. The first pathway is decarbonylation to obtain alkane hydrocarbons. The second pathway is hydrogenations via alcohol compounds as intermediates followed by alcohol dehydration. Alcohol dehydration can remove an oxygen atom in the form of H2O and alkene is obtained. After alcohol dehydration, the alkene compound can be hydrogenated to produce alkane hydrocarbons [98,131,132]. 2.1.4 Gas phase reaction A gas phase reaction can also occur during green diesel production because an oxygen atom in the feedstock is removed in the forms of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and H2O. The possible gas phase reactions are a water-gas shift reaction, methanation, and the Boudouard reaction [30,115,126,133,134]. The methanation reaction can take place from carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide reacting with hydrogen to produce methane (CH4) and H2O as the products. The gas phase reactions can be shown as Eqs. (1) and (2) [17,135]: (1) CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O (2) CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O Another reaction in the gas phase that usually occurs is a water-gas shift reaction. The water-gas shift reaction can reduce the amount of carbon monoxide in gaseous product because carbon monoxide and H2O can be converted to carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas. The reaction can be shown as Eq. (3) [136]: (3) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 Normally, hydrogen or a hydrogen donor produced in the gas-phase reaction, or hydrogen from catalysts or solvents that are used in the deoxygenation and hydrogenation in the liquid phase reaction are called in situ hydrogen [24,43,77,87,119,137,138]. Hossain et al. (2018) investigated the source of in situ hydrogen by using activated carbon as a catalyst for decarboxylation of oleic acid without external hydrogen gas at 400 °C. The results showed that the addition of water in the process provided another source of in situ hydrogen as shown in Eq. (4): (4) C + H2O → CO + H2 A small amount of activated carbon was lost as it was consumed as reactant; water reacted with C on the surface of the activated carbon to form CO and H2 [138]. In addition, carbon atoms on the surface of the activated carbon can also react with carbon dioxide to produce carbon monoxide. This reaction is called the Boudouard reaction, as shown in Eq. (5) [30,114,117,126]: (5) C + CO2 → 2CO The reaction yields in both liquid and gas phases are unpredictable, depending on several parameters, with the catalyst performance being a major factor affecting the conversion, selectivity, and side reactions. For example, green diesel production using an Ni catalyst is favorable in terms of reducing carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide by-products as only small amounts of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide were detected [16,17,126]."
3,Catalysts for green diesel production,"2.2 Catalysts for green diesel production Various metal-based catalysts have been investigated for deoxygenation to produce green diesel, especially Pd and Ni, which can provide better performance than other metal catalysts. This has been confirmed by several studies [25,139-141]. Table 5 summarizes the catalysts used in green diesel production and revels that Pd-, Pt-, Ru-, Co-, Ni-, and Mo-based catalysts have been commonly used in recent years. The performance of Pd-based catalysts can provide conversions higher than 90% and oxygen removal of more than 50% for a variety of reactants including fatty acids, triglycerides, and aromatic compounds [18,19,134]. Although Pd catalysts have high deoxygenation rates, Scaldaferri et al. (2019) found that in the presence of aromatic compound in the reactants, Pd-based mono catalysts could not open the aromatic ring and a large amount of hydrogen gas would be required. As a result, the main products were cycloalkane, which still has the cycloalkane ring in the products [18]. However, the product selectivity was consistent in many studies with alkanes being the main products with different chain length hydrocarbons depending on the number of carbon atoms in the reactants [19,134,142]. The Pt-based catalysts could have conversion rates as low as 23% at a reaction temperature of 220 °C and produce higher conversion as the reaction temperature increased [127,143]. However, if the reaction conditions are suitable for Pt metal catalysis, the conversion can be greater than 80% and the main products are alkane hydrocarbons [127,141,144]. Even though a Ru-based catalyst is not used as much as Pd and Pt catalysts, it can provide conversion greater than 80%. Nevertheless, the performance of oxygen removal was less than that from Pd and Pt, and the product remained oxygenated causing lower selectivity of alkane hydrocarbon products [45,145]. The Co, Ni, and Mo-based catalysts are inexpensive. Co-based catalysts provide conversion greater than 90% and high efficiency in removing oxygen atoms for both Macauba oil and oleic acid when the reaction occurs under hydrogen environment [90]. Under no external hydrogen gas conditions, the conversion was lower than 60% and the hydrocarbons yield was below 40% [25,48,124]. Unlike Co-based catalysts, Ni-based catalysts provide higher conversion (as much as higher than 90%) under conditions of either hydrogen rich or hydrogen free. The type of reactant has little effect on the activity of Ni-based catalysts. For this reason, Ni-based catalysts are considered as suitable for various reactants in green diesel production, such as triglyceride, waste cooking oil, and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). In addition to producing a high conversion rate, it was also found that the product distribution was composed of alkane hydrocarbons in the diesel range [18,28,36,146]. Mo-based catalysts can produce a high conversion rate, but the product distribution revealed selectivity of alkane hydrocarbons that was lower than that of Ni-based catalysts [21,49,58,124]. furthermore, metals in the form of M0 (Ni0, Mo0, Co0) had better performance for green diesel production than in the form of metal oxide (MOx: NiO, CoO, MoOx). Among the metal oxide catalysts, NiO also had the best performance for conversion and alkane selectivity [25,58]."
4,Metal supported for green diesel production,"2.3 Metal supported for green diesel production There are several factors in the selection of a suitable support for catalyst in reactions, such as spillover hydrogen performance, metal-support interaction, high surface area, an accessible porous structure with regular-shaped pores, pore size distribution, mechanical properties (including attrition resistance, hardness, and compressive strength), and stability under reaction and regeneration [147-149]. It is well known that the ability to remove oxygen from reactants depends on the type of metal-active sites and catalyst support. In general, catalyst support has four categories comprising solid acids (zeolites), reducible oxides (TiO2, CeO2, and ZrO2), refractory oxides (Al2O3 and SiO2), and carbon-based (activated carbon, graphene, and carbon nanotubes) [10,150]. Zeolite, zirconia, alumina, and activated carbon have been widely used for green diesel production [40,42,46,88,98]. Supports can help increase the activity of metal catalysts by improving the stability of the catalyst and reducing deactivation. For example, reducible oxide supports such as CeO2 or ZrO2 as a single support or CeO2-ZrO2 as a combined oxide support can reduce carbon coking deactivation, where the lattice oxygen within the oxide support oxidizes any carbon deposited on the surface of the catalyst to form CO or CO2 [151]. 2.3.1 Zeolite support Zeolites composed of SiO4 and AlO4 with an arranged framework structure are called aluminosilicates molecules. Differences in the silicon-to-aluminum ratio (Si/Al) affects the pore geometry and size properties, leading to different types of zeolite [150]. In general, zeolites exhibit acidic properties, having two acid sites being a Lewis acid and a Brønsted acid. A Lewis acid and a Brønsted acid site are an electron pair acceptor and a proton donator, respectively. Hence, the roles of Brønsted acid site in a reaction is reactant protonation, such as for alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and alcohol, while oxygen atom in reactants are coordinated by Lewis acid sites due to the facilitated absorption of oxygenated compounds [152,153]. Osman et al. (2017) studied the impact of the catalyst support acidity on the electrophilicity of metal active site. The results showed that the use of zeolite provided Brønsted acidity to improve the activity for reaction and increased the electrophilicity of metal active sites, which enhanced the reoxidation step at the end of the catalytic cycle [154]. There are several zeolites support types commonly used in deoxygenation, such as HZSM-5 [39, 40, 44,], SAPO-11 [36,137], and SBA-15 [32,48,115]. Hewer et al. (2018) investigated the influence of the acidity of 5% NiO-15% MoO3 on Al2O3 (NiMoAl), SAPO-11 (NiMoSAPO), and SBA-15 (NiMoSBA) as supports on anisole hydrodeoxygenation. The results showed that the activity for anisole hydrodeoxygenation of NiMoSBA was higher than for the NiMoSAPO and NiMoAl catalysts at all reaction temperatures. However, the results of the Lewis/ Brønsted ratio (L/B) decreased in the order NiMoAl (L/B = 50), NiMoSBA (L/B = 13.6), and NiMoSAPO (L/B = 5), which was interesting in that the hydrodeoxygenation performance of the catalysts was not in direct proportion to the values of the L/B ratio. These results also suggested that the optimal ratio for anisole hydrodeoxygenation was a moderate L/B ratio [155]. This was consistent with the experimental results from Xiang et al. (2019) who investigated the differences in SAPO-11 support acidity with variation of the Si/Al molar ratio (0.2, 0.4, 0.6). The experiment was carried out with hydrodeoxygenation of castor oil. As a result, an Ni-Mo/SAPO-11 (0.4) catalyst with moderate acidic strength produced the highest conversion (97.2%) and the selectivity of alkane products was in the jet-fuel range (81.6%) [153]. 2.3.2 Zirconia support Zirconia or zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) is a type of ceramic oxide having an oxygen anion lattice structure with zirconium cations located between an oxygen anion structure. Zirconia has three polymorphs depending on the synthesis temperature, which can be cubic phase, tetragonal phase, or monoclinic phase [156,157]. Zirconia support shows specific interactions with the metal-active phase. The catalytic mechanism of zirconia support can be explained by the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [136]. The oxygen vacancies on the zirconia surface are related to structural and dissociative adsorption, which affects the catalyst performance. Chen et al. (2017) described the mechanism of octanoic acid deoxygenation on the zirconia surface. The reaction involved an initial adsorption of the carboxylate group in octanoic acid on the oxygen vacancy surface of the zirconia support and then diffused to the Ni surface. The decarboxylation pathway occurred as octanoic acid decarboxylates to produce heptane. For the decarbonylation pathway, octanoic acid at first hydrogenates and then dehydrates to obtain octanal before it decarbonylates to produce heptane. In addition, the conversion can reach 98.3% with a heptane yield of 87.4% at 240 °C reaction temperature using an Ni/ZrO2 catalyst [158]. 2.3.3 Alumina support The most important type of alumina used as a catalyst support in the petroleum industries is γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3). The desirable properties in γ-alumina include its surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, thermal stability, and acidity characteristics [159]. A triglyceride or fatty acid molecule can be adsorbed on the surface of the alumina support, which is related to the activation energy of triglyceride or fatty acid decomposition causing a strong interaction with the alumina surface sites [160]. The surface of γ-alumina can be permeated with hydroxyl groups, which have been assumed to donate protons and can be called a Brønsted acid site that related the CC bond cleavage. For the Lewis acid site, γ-alumina can be generated by unsaturated aluminum ions, which facilitate CO cleavage reactions [132,161]. Janampelli et al. (2018) performed deoxygenation of fatty acids and their esters using Pt-WOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The results showed that a conversion of 100 percent of oleic acid was obtained in all the recycling tests with the selectivity of C-18 product increased from 67.1 to 80.8 percent and the selectivity of C-17 decreased from 31.6 to 18.5 percent. The mechanism on the surface of Al2O3 was the activation of oleic acid through C = O group on the Lewis acid sites, while the hydride ions on Pt surface was generated for easier deprotonation. The decarboxylation and formation of C17 occurred by cleaved CC bond. Thus, the hydrodeoxygenation to produce C-18 occurred on WOxH species, while the decarbonylation was activated on Lewis acid Al2O3 sites to produce C-17 [132]. 2.3.4 Activated carbon support Activated carbon is a carbonaceous material composing of a large number of various C atom and oxygen-containing hydrocarbon functional groups on the surface including acidity and basicity such as carboxyl, lactone, and carbonyl [162]. The number of functional groups of activated carbon affects the catalytic performance due to that it acts as anchoring sites for the metal active sites and ability to chemisorb the reactants [163]. Activated carbon from different synthesis method also provides microporous structure resulting in a high surface area [164-166]. In addition, C atom on activated carbon can react with H2O to produce H2 that can be used in deoxygenation, which was confirmed by the weight loss of activated carbon support after a complete reaction [138]. Jin et al. (2019) studied the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtRe supported on various carbon supports (carbon nanotubes and activated carbon) for triglyceride deoxygenation. The treatment of activated carbon with HNO3 can oxidize functional group on carbon surfaces. The amount of PtRe metals decreased with increasing oxygen content of the carbon support, which indicated that the size of metal became larger when the oxygen content of carbon support increased. The catalytic performance related to the oxygen content. Higher n-alkane yields were obtained with the catalyst supported on carbons with less oxygen content on the surface [167]."
5,Deoxygenation over Ni-based catalysts,
6,Ni-based catalysts synthesis,"3.1 Ni-based catalysts synthesis Catalysts preparation can be divided into two parts, synthesis of catalyst support material and deposition of metal active phase onto the support. There are many synthesis methods for catalyst deposition onto a support, such as precipitation, co-precipitation, complexation, gelation, and crystallization [168]. The selection of synthesis method depends on type of base materials, physical and chemical characteristics desired in the final catalyst. For the example, zeolite support is often synthesized by sol-gel method (as shown in Fig. 3 (a) [169-171]) by using metal salts (metal aluminate and metal silicate) as a starting material. The reasons are that Al and Si can be readily incorporated into the final catalyst, the formation of silicate sol is stable, and surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution can be fine-tuned [172-174]. Synthesis method for zirconia support is commonly precipitation and sol-gel (as shown in Fig. 3(b) [175,176]), however precipitation method provides the higher surface area and thermal resistance compared to that of sol-gel [177,178]. There are several method for metal deposition on a support consisting of impregnation, co-precipitation, and ion exchange [150]. Criteria for selection of the method to load metal to attain a high-performance catalyst comprises of narrow size distribution, high metal dispersion on support, and interaction between metal and support. Typically, the impregnation methods give metal distribution mainly on the surface of a support, whereas the precipitation methods give metals incorporation in the interstitial regions [179,180]. Taromi et al. (2018) studied the effect of different Ni/Al2O3 catalysts synthesis on hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides by comparison of one pot sol-gel via Evaporation-Induced Self-Assembly (EISA) and conventional incipient wetness impregnation methods. The results showed that acidity of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts by sol-gel method was lower than that from incipient wetness impregnation due to the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel phase. The higher acidity leads to the cracked products including C-9 to C-14 alkanes, which can be seen from the conversion and selectivity of alkane in diesel range for long reaction time. The stability of supported catalyst from sol-gel technique gives more stable properties than that from impregnation method [119]."
7,Ni‐based catalysts with different support,"3.2 Ni‐based catalysts with different support Although the metal active site is an important factor affecting the reaction and Ni metals provides the better performance among the metals used in the production of green diesel, it is undeniable that the desirable supports can improve their physical properties including stabilities, electronic properties, metal particle size, and metal dispersion [181] (as described in Section 2.3 .). In addition, the selection of a suitable support to metal will result in synergistic effect properties, which can enhance the catalytic performance [182,183]. Kong et al. (2018) reported the hydrogenation of stearic acid over Ni metal catalyst without support in a batch stainless steel autoclave using 1,4-dioxane as a solvent at 5 MPa H2, 250 °C, and 5 h of reaction time. The results showed that Ni catalyst without support provided a conversion of 12 percent and the main products were C36 compounds, consisting of octadecyl stearate and stearone from esterification and ketonization of stearic acid. The conversion and selectivity of the experiment had improved and approached 100 percent when using catalysts support [184]. Therefore, nickel metal catalyst performance on various supports for green diesel production are discussed in this section. 3.2.1 Ni on zeolites supported Ni metal on zeolites support is a bifunctional catalyst involving acid sites and Ni metallic sites working together to provide better performance [130,185]. The increase of the Ni active site/acid sites ratio on the catalyst surface advocates the decarboxylation or decarbonylation reactions leading to the C15 product improvement [130]. There are many types of zeolites supports, which are about 40 natural zeolites and over 150 synthesized zeolites [186]. In this section, some examples of zeolites commonly used in the works recently reported are discussed. Camargo et al. (2020) investigated nickel phosphide catalysts supported on different structures zeolites (USY, H-ZSM-5, and Al-SBA-15) with oleic acid deoxygenation to produce green diesel. The reaction was performed in a batch reactor at 300 °C and 50 bar of H2 for 6 h without solvent used. The acidity is related with the Si/Al ratio showing that the lower Si/Al ratio the higher amount of acid sites. The reason is that a higher amount of Al atoms provided less unbalanced in framework zeolites structure during the creation of the acid sites leading to the decrease of acid sites with the following order: USY > Al-SBA-15 > H-ZSM 5. Nickel phosphide creates weak acid sites by the P-OH group on Ni2P. The nickel phosphide has two phases on zeolites support—Ni2P (active phase) and Ni12P5. The results showed that Ni2P phase accumulated on the channels Al-SBA-15 due to mesoporous nature and small nickel phosphide particles size. For the Ni2P phase on H-ZSM 5 support, it showed strong acidity and small particle sizes, causing the total amount of hydrocarbons (C10 C18) and degree of deoxygenation in the following order: Ni2P/Al-SBA-15(42%) > Ni2P/H-ZSM-5 > Ni2P/USY [187]. One of the most important zeolites supports used for petroleum refinery industry is Y zeolites, which can act as a catalyst for cracking [188]. The acidity of Y zeolite revealed the high Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites ratio. Too high Brønsted acid sites causes the reactants to crack providing low amount of long chain hydrocarbons leading to obtaining lighter hydrocarbons [189]. Choo et al. (2020) studied the effect of NiO supported on Y zeolite catalysts for solventless and H2-free of triolein deoxygenation at 380 °C for 2 h. The results showed that the addition of NiO reduced the amount of Brønsted acid sites and increased the amount of Lewis acid sites due to Ni ions substitution for the (H +) in Y zeolite by ion-exchange. NiO on Y zeolite support for green diesel production provides the cracking reactions, while coking deactivation could be minimized, and 76.21 percent of triolein conversion, 84.28 percent of hydrocarbons selectivity with 92.61 percent of hydrocarbon products in the diesel range were obtained. In addition to the role of Brønsted acid sites, it was found that the synergistic effect between the reduced ratio of Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites and high performance of Ni metal for hydrogenolysis enhanced the decarboxylation reaction [25,85]. Thus, it can be seen that although many types of zeolites are used as a catalyst support for Ni metal, the main reactions for green diesel production are decarboxylation and decarbonylation that provide hydrocarbons with an odd number of carbons as the main products. 3.2.2 Ni on ZrO2 supports There have been several studies reporting that when Ni metal is on ZrO2 supports, the catalytic performance was improved, known as a synergistic effect [39,190-195]. Fig. 2 above shows the possible reactions that occur in green diesel production. Fatty acids can be transformed into aldehyde compounds as an intermediate followed by decarbonylation or decarboxylation for conversion into alkane products. Ni metal on a ZrO2 support catalyst provides two parallel routes for fatty acid transformation that can be catalyzed solely by the Ni metal or catalyzed synergistically by the Ni and ZrO2 [193,194,196]. Chen et al. (2017) studied the effect of oxygen vacancies on ZrO2 and the synergistic effect between Ni and the ZrO2 surface on octanoic acid deoxygenation using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to provide detailed information. The reaction was performed in a batch reactor at 3 MPa H2 for 12 h. The results from the DFT technique showed that the adsorption energies of R-COO on the oxygen vacancies of ZrO2 surface were lower than without oxygen vacancies. In addition, a higher number of oxygen vacancies on the ZrO2 surface provided lower energy of R-COO adsorption. The results indicated that oxygen vacancies conducive to the adsorption of R-COO on ZrO2 were followed by contacts with the active sites of Ni. Moreover, from the calculated results, the activation energy of the rate-determining step in decarboxylation was 1.36 eV, which was lower than that of decarbonylation (1.47 eV) and hydrodeoxygenation (2.03 eV), indicating that decarboxylation on the Ni surface was more favorable than decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation [158]. 3.2.3 Ni on Al2O3 supported Nikolopoulos et al. (2020) described the properties and characteristics of Ni on an Al2O3 support that affected green diesel production. The green diesel was produced from waste cooking oils under solvent free conditions at 310 °C and 40 bar H2 pressure in a semi-batch mode. Before evaluation of the reaction, the Ni on Al2O3 was characterized using several techniques. The Ni phases presented on the support were Ni (active phase), NiO, and NiAl2O4. The NiO was easily reduced to Ni due to weak metal-support interactions unlike NiAl2O4, which had strong metal-support interactions. The strong interaction in NiAl2O4 led to a high reaction temperature affecting the loss of Ni active sites by sintering. On the alumina support surface, there were weak, moderate, and strong acid sites. The weak acid sites were located on the Al2O3 surface, while the moderate and strong acid sites appeared on the Ni metal surface, which was related to the empty d orbitals of Ni interacting with the lone pair of electrons of substrates. The deleterious large, bulky compounds in waste cooking oils, not being able to diffuse through the porous structure, are decomposed by the strong acid sites of catalysts, providing a complete conversion. The major products were n-alkanes with odd numbered carbon atoms being more than that with the even numbered carbon atoms, indicating that the decarbonylation of the aldehydes was intermediate as the main reaction [29]. This was consistent with the results from many experiments with different types of reactant [21,34,87,197,198]. Although several studies did not prefer the spinel structure (NiAl2O4) as the desirable catalyst due to its low activity for green diesel production, Srifa et al. (2018) studied and developed the NiAl2O4 phase as a catalyst for palm oil deoxygenation compared to the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The NiAl2O4 phase was reduced under different reduction temperatures (773, 923, and 1073 K). The green diesel production was performed in a trickle bed reactor at 573 K and 5 MPa H2. The results showed that, the highest surface area of catalyst was obtained at a reduction temperature of 923 K because large spinel oxide particles decomposed into small particles via grain cracking, but the large sintering resulted in a wide particle size distribution with the reduction at 1073 K. The comparison of deoxygenation activity of the Ni between Ni/γ-Al2O3 and NiAl2O4 was reported in terms of product yield and revealed that the catalyst performance decreased in the order of NiAl2O4–923 K (94.3%) > Ni/γ-Al2O3–923 K (80.1%) > Ni/γ-Al2O3–773 K (82.9%) > NiAl2O4–1073 K (45.4%) > NiAl2O4–773 K (1.1%) due to the well-dispersed metallic Ni on the Al2O4 spinel structure [199]. From the results of the experiment, it was considered that the NiAl2O4 spinel-type catalyst at a 923 K reduction temperature was successfully prepared and suitable for using in green diesel production. 3.2.4 Ni on carbon support Carbon is one of the materials that is suitable as a catalyst support due to its specific properties, such as resistance to acidic and basic surroundings, and its textural and surface properties [200]. The carbon material surface is composed of several functional groups, which are the main factor affecting its role as a catalyst support [201,202]. The surface functional groups can be modified using several different treatment methods depending on the desired functional groups for adsorption of reactants species [203]. The desired functional groups for deoxygenation are oxygen-containing functional groups, such as carboxylic, phenolic, and carbonyl [203-207]. The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups causes the hydrophilicity properties of carbon surface as has been described by Ruangudomsakul et al. (2020) who investigated green diesel production from palm oil using nickel phosphides on activated carbon in a fixed-bed flow reactor at 350 °C. The results showed that the low oxygen content of carbon provided higher hydrophobicity properties causing less diffusion of nickel phosphide into carbon micropores. The nickel phosphide dispersed on the outside of micropores and enhanced catalytic performance in the deoxygenation of palm oil to green diesel. The enhanced performance was due to active sites being blocked by water product [207]. In addition, nickel phosphide on activated carbon has acidic properties. The Brønsted acid sites were attributed to the surface with P-OH and the carboxylic group, while the Lewis acid sites corresponded to the Niδδ+ in Ni2P. The dominant pathways for green diesel production were decarboxylation and decarbonylation due to the presence of the Ni2P phase as active species for these reactions [113,207,208]. On the other hand, Xin et al. (2019) prepared nickel phosphide on carbon supports with different surface oxygenated groups. The nickel phosphide species gave the Ni2P and Ni12P5 phases. A synergistic effect of Ni2P and Ni12P5 was observed and enhanced the deoxygenation giving an oil product yield from 46.8 to 56.0% with the complete conversion of palmitic acid [81,208]. Furthermore, in the development of carbon supports for deoxygenation has also used carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [126,209,210]. Carbon nanotubes are a tubular structure of graphite sheets (graphene) with extended π-conjugated structures, which have a higher surface area than activated carbon [211]. The higher the surface area, the more functional active groups that favor deoxygenation, resulting in improved green diesel production [126,210,212]."
8,Factors influencing green diesel production over ni-based catalysts,"3.3 Factors influencing green diesel production over ni-based catalysts 3.3.1 Reaction temperature Generally, the production of green diesel via deoxygenation using Ni-based catalysts is performed in a temperature range of 240–380 °C [47,88,187,198]. The reaction temperature has a significant effect on the alkane products. If the reaction temperature is too high, a hydrocracking reaction results, producing a lower alkane product ratio in the diesel range [198,213,214]. Deoxygenation carried out at a reaction temperature lower than 240 °C results in low conversion and a low alkane product yield because the dehydration of converting intermediate alcohol to an alkane product is preferable at low temperature [158]. Papageridis et al. (2020) investigated green diesel production via the deoxygenation of palm oil over Ni catalysts supported on Αl2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 at different reaction temperatures to determine the optimum temperature for each type of support. The results showed that the optimum reaction temperatures for Ni/Αl2O3, Ni/ZrO2, and Ni/SiO2 to obtain the highest conversion and molar fraction of alkane products were 375, 300, and 350 °C, respectively. However, Ni on all types of support produced similar results, showing that the conversion and the molar fraction of alkane products increased when the reaction temperature increased until reaching the optimum point after which it decreased when the temperature exceeded the optimum point. This effect was due to cracking, which provided a higher amount of lighter hydrocarbons, such as C8–C14 [198]. 3.3.2 Reaction pressure As explained in the possible reactions occurring in the production of green diesel in Fig. 2, the reaction requires a large amount of hydrogen for several steps of hydroprocessing. The high demand for hydrogen causes the system to operate under a high-pressure condition in the range 20–50 bar, which affects the production cost [28,82,187,215]. Normally, the level of hydrogen consumption can be ranked in the following order: hydrodeoxygenation > decarbonylation > decarboxylation, while unsaturated feedstocks also require a high amount of hydrogen to saturate the double bonds [73,215]. Phimsen et al. (2017) investigated the performance of NiS, NiP, and NiC to produce green diesel from coffee oil. The reaction was performed in a batch reactor at 400 °C for 2 h. The initial pressure was adjusted from 40 bar to 20 bar. The results showed that decreasing the H2 pressure affected the conversion and liquid product except for the NiS catalyst that resulted in quite constant production. The conversion of the reaction over NiP catalyst decreased from 77.4 to 72.5%, while that of NiC catalyst decreased from 78.9 to 65.4%. The results also indicated that with a low hydrogen pressure resulting a low hydrogen concentration at the surface of catalyst, there was low hydrogen consumption in the methanation reaction [73]. To reduce the use of hydrogen due to its high cost and the danger associated with it being highly combustible, the production of green diesel with no external hydrogen supply or under a nitrogen gas environment has been of interest [25,30,37,44,48,92,138,146]. Xing et al. (2018) studied the effect of the reaction environment on oleic acid deoxygenation at 360 °C using Ni/HZSM-5 as a catalyst. The results showed that the reaction under N2 and H2 provided complete conversion with the molar percentage of alkane products in the range of 80–90. Under the H2 environment reaction, increasing H2 from 2 MPa to 4 MPa caused the molar fraction of alkane to decrease as a result of more aromatic hydrocarbons being produced. Under the N2 environment reaction, decreasing N2 had no significant effect on the product as was evident from the molar fraction of alkane being nearly constant under an operating pressure from 1 MPa to 4 MPa. The minor products were olefins and aromatic compounds, while olefins were not found in the product when N2 gas was used, but instead there were more aromatic products when using H2 gas [44]. The results confirmed that green diesel production can occur under conditions with no external hydrogen supply. 3.3.3 Reaction time Several studies reported that the reaction time is one of the important factors in green diesel production. The optimum reaction time for deoxygenation using Ni-based catalysts was in the range 3 to 6 h [39,40,187] and conversion increased with increasing reaction time until complete conversion was achieved. On the other hand, a longer reaction time can also lead to a decrease in the diesel range of the hydrocarbons due to cracking allowing heavy hydrocarbon molecules to become lighter hydrocarbons. The effect of reaction time was similar to the effect of temperature in that the higher reaction temperature, the more light products formed [29,187,210,216]. 3.3.4 Promoter The most favorable metal for improvement in Ni catalyst performance on deoxygenation has been Mo metal. Mo can decrease the Ni catalyst particle size, restrain inactive nickel aluminate phase formation, and favor converting intermediate alcohols and aldehydes [16,26,49,217]. Krobkrong et al. (2018) investigated the deoxygenation of oleic acid at 330 °C with 3 h reaction time, and a pressure of 40 bars under an N2 environment. They found that the synergistic effect between Ni and MoO3 could improve the oleic acid conversion from 67 to 81% and increased the amounts of C17 hydrocarbon products. In addition, NiMo supported on Al2O3 had a higher stearic acid selectivity and provided lower intermediate selectivity, such as alcohols and aldehydes. These results suggested that NiMo supported on Al2O3 composed of MoO3 and NiMoO4 phases could promote dehydrogenation to produce hydrogen species under an inert environment. In situ hydrogen gas was formed and then was used in the hydrogenation of oleic acid to generate stearic acid. The reduced NiMo caused poor performance for dehydrogenation leading to low conversion and C17 hydrocarbons selectivity [43]. A noble metal that is highly active for green diesel production can also be used as a promoter to improve the performance of an Ni catalyst [45,218,219]. Jeon et al. (2019) studied the effect of different promoters (Pt, Pd, Pu) on Ni-supported Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 (CZO) for oleic acid deoxygenation in a batch reactor at 300 °C with 1 bar of 20 vol% of H2/N2 for 3 h. The results showed that all the promoters improved the performance of Ni–CZO, with the Pt promoter producing the highest improvement. These results had oleic acid conversion in the following order: Pt/Ni–CZO (98.7%) > Ni–CZO (98.3%) > Pd/Ni–CZO (90.8%) > Ru/Ni–CZO (88.3%). This was due to the strong influence of the surface defect oxygen fraction on catalytic performance. Although the Ru/Ni–CZO had a higher surface defect oxygen fraction than Pd/Ni–CZO, a higher oleic acid conversion was obtained due to the higher acidity of the catalyst. Thus, a Pt promoter was suitable for Ni–CZO, as it provided the highest oleic acid conversion of 54.2%, good C9–C17 product selectivity, and oxygen removal of 91.5% [45]. 3.3.5 Green diesel production with no external hydrogen supply Studies using no external hydrogen gas supply in green diesel production suggested that this could be realized by using a hydrogen donor solvent or hydrogen donor substance. Thongkumkoon et al. (2019) compared the ability of the hydrogen donor of substances such as formic acid, ethanol, or glycerol to external hydrogen supply under a pressure of 4 MPa. The criteria for substance selection were availability and low cost under similar reaction conditions. Oleic acid deoxygenation was performed over trimetallic ReNiMo catalysts supported on Al2O3 at 370 °C for 1 h in a batch reactor. The results showed that deoxygenation without a hydrogen donor substance and with external hydrogen supply provided lower oleic acid conversion (49.82%) and total product yield (35.12%). With oleic acid deoxygenation under 4 MPa of hydrogen gas supply, complete conversion was obtained and with a product yield of 79.59%. The use of formic acid, ethanol, and glycerol used as an in situ hydrogen sources for oleic acid deoxygenation showed that using a hydrogen donor significantly improved the reaction conversion, selectivity, and total product yield compared to without hydrogen donor from 35.12% to 71.16–77.23%. Finally, glycerol produced the best performance as a hydrogen donor with the highest yield of C13–C18 in green diesel production [49]. Several studies have focused on the use of nitrogen gas for green diesel production with the results showing that under a nitrogen gas environment, green diesel production can occur to a similar level to that with a hydrogen gas supply [92,124,146,212]. The reaction pathway of green diesel production with a nitrogen gas environment is decarboxylation and decarbonylation, where decarboxylation is the major reaction as hydrogen is not required in the reaction [48,50]. Kamaruzaman et al. (2019) produced green diesel from palm fatty acid distillate via a deoxygenation reaction in a semi-batch reactor at 350 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen gas atmosphere using Ni/SBA-15 as the catalyst. The results showed that Ni/SBA-15 had excellent catalytic performance providing a high hydrocarbons yield of 85.8% with 77% C13–C17 hydrocarbons selectivity. The main reaction was decarboxylation due to no hydrogen being required and the minor reaction was decarbonylation, which occurred with the hydrogen donor from the acid cite of the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst [48]. Other studies have also provided good results for green diesel production in a nitrogen gas atmosphere, confirming that green diesel production can be achieved through a reduction in the external hydrogen supply and this could lead to sustainable production in the future."
9,Recent progress and future perspective for deoxygenation in green diesel production,"Nowadays, diesel fuel plays an important role in the transportation and industrial sectors, both of which are necessary in everyday life around the world. Diesel fuel use tends to increase annually along with the increasing population. A significant effect of diesel consumption is the emission of carbon dioxide from the direct combustion of diesel derived from fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas, which has a direct effect on climate change and global warming [12,220-223]. Based on the reasons mentioned above, natural resource-based diesel fuel has been developed for diesel fossil fuel substitution. Diesel fuels that are produced from natural resources, such as palm oil, soybean oil, and algae can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by reabsorption of carbon dioxide used for photosynthesis. In the early days of diesel fuel production from renewable sources, the product was called 1st generation biofuel and was primarily biodiesel. However, biodiesel produced from transesterification or esterification was unsuitable as a direct substitution for B-100 due to its low flash point and low oxidation stability from the presence of oxygen atoms. The 2nd generation of biofuel was developed to provide for the complete replacement of diesel fossil fuel because the 2nd generation biofuel, known as green diesel, has paraffinic molecular structure like that of fossil diesel fuel. Early in the development of green diesel production, there were several issues preventing the technology from being implemented on an industrial scale or for large-scale production. An obvious issue was that the reaction requires a high H2 pressure of approximately 50–70 bars [224,225], requires solvent [194,226], and requires noble metal catalyst [227,228] leading to high production costs. Using sulfide catalysts also produced a high sulfur content in the product and caused catalyst poisoning [229]. Today, the limitations of green diesel production have been addressed and the technology has been developed continuously so that sustainable commercial production is possible. Present research on green diesel production via deoxygenation mainly focuses on improving the quality, oxygen removal, yield, and selectivity of the hydrocarbons in the diesel range, together with minimizing the production cost by using non-noble catalysts and no external H2. To avoid the use of noble metal catalysts, non-noble metals catalysts have been developed. Several studies have found that Ni metals catalysts can be as effective as noble metals for green diesel production for the several reasons described above. Subsequently, Ni metal has been developed due to its better properties and functionality for the following: (i) transforming Ni into a nickel phosphate form, (ii) selecting a suitable support that can provide high nickel metal catalyst dispersion that can result in a high number of active sites, and (iii) using as a promoter or support that produces a synergistic effect with Ni. The hydrogen pressure is an important factor that has been the focused of recent research to improve the development of green diesel production. To reduce the use of external hydrogen gas supply, alternative production methods have been developed by either generating hydrogen within the process itself (called in situ hydrogen) or by changing to another gas, such as nitrogen. The use of in situ hydrogen in deoxygenation to produce green diesel can occur by different factors including: (i) reacting water and carbon and followed by the Boudouard reaction to produce hydrogen gas, (ii) from consecutive gas phase reactions including water-gas shift and methanation to produce hydrogen, (iii) using a suitable acidic support [24,92], and (iv) using a hydrogen donor solvent/substance [37,49,230,231]. The future perspective for green diesel production is to reduce production costs to facilitate the technology to the level of industrial scale with economic viability. Production cost reductions can occur via two options. First, low-cost or industrial wastes can be used as the reactants, such as PFAD which can also reduce raw material competition between food, feed, and fuel. Second, the hydrogen consumption and operating pressure can be reduced by developing catalysts or using technology with no external hydrogen supply."
10,Conclusion,"This review has focused on deoxygenation for green diesel production based on recent studies. Green diesel has appeared as a promising alternative diesel fuel for the future because it can be produced from renewable sources, such as triglyceride in oils and fats, fatty acid, wastes oil, and their derivatives. The alkane hydrocarbons structure of green diesel is like diesel fossil fuel, and thus it provides similar properties to diesel fossil leading to its potential as a direct diesel substitute for fossil fuel. The deoxygenation reaction of green diesel production occurs in the liquid phase and gas phase. The liquid phase has three main pathways—decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation. Before deoxygenation can occur, the initial reaction is dependent on the type of feedstock. Possible gas phase reactions include methanation, water-gas shift reaction, and the Boudouard reaction. Ni metal is a non-noble metal catalyst that has been confirmed by many studies for application in green diesel production as well as being a noble metal with a lower cost. The support for a Ni metal catalyst is an important factor in performance improvement. Among the catalyst supports, zeolite, zirconia, alumina, and activated carbon, have been widely used as supports for Ni metal in green diesel production due to their high surface area, oxygen vacancy properties, acidity, and synergistic effect. In addition, to supports, deoxygenation in green diesel production is affected by the temperature, pressure, reaction time, and promoter, regarding the amounts of resulting product. Finally, recent progress and future trends have focused on sustainable green diesel production by consuming less external hydrogen. Several studies in recent years have confirmed that green diesel production can occur under inert gas conditions using a Ni-based catalyst, leading to future development for sustainable production in many industries."
