0,Introduction,"With the wide application of biological wastewater treatment, waste activated sludge (WAS), as the major by-product of above process, is generated in huge quantities worldwide (Wang et al., 2018b). For instance, in China, it's estimated that the yield of WAS can be up to 4.8 × 108 tons dry matter (DW, 80% water content) in 2020 (Li et al., 2018). The United States has an average annual sewage sludge production of 1.78 × 107 tons DW since 2008 (EPA, 2018). In terms of the typical developed countries in Asia-Pacific region, Australia and Japan generated 3.6 × 105 tons and 2.2 × 106 tons DW each year, respectively (AWA, 2018; JSWA, 2017). The European Union produced around 9.0 × 106 tons DW each year (Eurostat, 2018). Substantial disposal costs incurred by the continuously produced WAS has posed great economical challenge for the long-term operation of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (Wei et al., 2018). On the other hand, carbon-rich WAS contains substantial organic substances such as proteins and polysaccharides, which can be utilized and converted into value-added fuels and chemicals (e.g., methane and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)) (Liu et al., 2019; Rao et al., 2018). Therefore, the research and application of effective sludge treatment processes (e.g., anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation) have recently attracted growing attention, by which WAS reduction and recovery of valuable bioenergy and resource can be simultaneously achieved (Luo et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a). For example, Wei et al. (2020) reported that dosing biochar (1.82–3.06 g/g total solid (TS)) in digester enhanced methane production by 8.6–17.8% with 14% reduction in the volume of digestate for disposal. Li et al. (2016) found that the SCFA production was enhanced 3.7 times (195.7 mg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/g volatile suspended solid (VSS)) and VSS reduction was increased 123% at 1.8 mg free nitrous acid/L pretreatment. Anaerobic fermentation, during which WAS can be bio-utilized to produce valuable products (e.g., SCFAs, mainly C2-C5 carboxylic acids)), has been considered as a promising method to treat WAS (Yang et al., 2015). To promote bio-conversion of organic matters in sludge during anaerobic fermentation, obtaining more SCFAs output, considerable efforts such as sludge pretreatment methods and operation parameters optimization have been conducted (Li et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019; Rao et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2015). For example, Zhang et al. (2018) found that sludge pretreated by 176.5 mg free ammonia/L for 3 days could increase SCFAs concentration to 267.2 mg COD/g VSS by destroying the extracellular polymeric substances and cell envelope of sludge cells. Liu et al. (2019) applied the heat-CaO2 (67.4 °C and 0.12 g/g VSS) advanced thermal hydrolysis to pretreat sludge to increase proportion of biodegradable organic matters, resulting in a maximum SCFAs concentration of 336.5 mg COD/g VSS. However, SCFAs, featuring good hydrophility, are not easy to be separated and purified from fermentation broth (Wu et al., 2019a). Moreover importantly, given the relatively low energy density (873.7–2793.9 KJ/mol), SCFAs are unsuitable for direct use as fuel (Steinbusch et al., 2011). Those characteristics greatly limit the scope of utilization of SCFAs, thereby decreasing economic benefits and application potentiality of WAS anaerobic fermentation (Singhania et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2019b). In this sense, upgrading or transforming SCFAs to high-energy and easily separable products is urgently needed. Recently, a newly developed biotechnology i.e., chain elongation (CE) process, may provide an alternative solution for the bioconversion of SCFAs, during which anaerobic microbe uses acetyl-CoA provided by the oxidation of electron donor (ED) as the cyclic molecule to interact with SCFAs (as electron acceptor (EA)), extending its carbon chain length with two carbons at each cycle and producing medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), i.e., carboxylic acids with carbon atoms ranging from 6 to 12 (Angenent et al., 2016). Compared to SCFAs (O/C ratios range from 1:1 to 2:5), MCFAs, featuring higher energy density (3492.4–4798.7 KJ/mol) due to lower oxygen/carbon ratios (1:3–1:6), can be used as versatile precursors for the production of biofuels and various industrial products, such as fragrances (Kenealy et al., 1995), food additive (Xu et al., 2015), and antimicrobial agent (P. Desbois, 2012) etc. Besides, because MCFAs have long hydrophobic carbon chains, it is therefore easily separated from fermentation liquor with consuming less cost (Agler et al., 2012). Therefore, MCFAs are regarded as more profitable chemical (Ge et al., 2015). In the CE process, ethanol has been demonstrated to be one of the most ideal ED, because which not only could be produced from large amount of industrial and agricultural waste (e.g., brewing wastewater and lignocellulose) but also could lead to relatively high MCFA productivity (Kucek et al., 2016). In our recent study, we utilized synthetic WAS alkaline fermentation liquor (WASAFL) to enrich SCFAs, as a novel EA to produce MCFAs via CE process using ethanol as ED, demonstrating firstly the feasibility of upgrading SCFAs from WAS anaerobic fermentation into MCFAs. Different from other organic feedstocks, such as food waste and dried chicken manure, the compositions of SCFAs in WASAFL can be distinct from those that have been reported (Nzeteu et al., 2018; Lonkar et al., 2016). Besides, after alkaline fermentation, lots of acid-producing microorganisms are enriched in the WASAFL, which might be more favorable for CE process. More importantly, the use of WASAFL provides an alternative sludge fermentation technology to simultaneously reducing WAS amounts and recover high energy density, easy-separated MCFAs. Specifically, three different ethanol to WASAFL ratios (i.e., 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1) were performed to investigate the effect of ED to EA ratio on the production of MCFAs. The results showed that 72.9% of highest MCFA synthesis rate was achieved at the ED to EA ratio of 1:1 (Wu et al., 2019b). However, unexpectedly, in addition to MCFAs, it was also found that some amount of long-chain alcohols (LCAs, i.e., n-butanol and n-hexanol) were produced during the CE of WASAFL. Similar to MCFAs, synthesis of LCAs has received increasing interest because of energy and sustainability concerns (Dekishima et al., 2011). Furthermore, LCAs has the advantages of being less hygroscopic, being less volatile, being less corrosive, and being less explosive, was regard as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017). Consequently, LCAs was another more attractive product compared with SCFAs. However, it was worth noticing that LCAs were detected only at the tested highest ratio (i.e., 2:1) of ED to EA and its corresponding production only accounted for the 9.8% of the total organic carbon. This phenomenon leads us to raise a question: can further increase in the ratio of ED to EA enhance the yield of LCAs, achieving desired co-production of MCFAs and LCAs? Although the effect of the ED to EA ratio on the structure and production of MCFAs has been confirmed (Liu et al., 2016), its evaluation on the COD distribution and co-production of MCFAs and LCAs are still limited. Moreover, in our previous study, the inoculum, enriching microorganisms related with carboxylate acid production, was obtained from the anaerobic digested sludge (Wu et al., 2019b). Previous studies suggested that there were also potential carboxylic acid-producing microorganisms in the real WASAFL (Wan et al., 2016), such as genus Clostridium, which was considered potentially to produce MCFAs and LCAs (e.g., Clostridium kluyveri and Clostridium ljungdahlii). Consequently, another question has also caused our concern: can WASAFL be used directly to produce MCFAs and LCAs without inoculating exogenous microorganisms. If it can, which will make SCFAs upgrade via CE process more convenient, strengthening the feasibility of potential application. By answering questions proposed above, the objective of this study is therefore to investigate the feasibility of co-production of MCFAs and LCAs using real WASAFL simultaneously as EA and inoculum in a two-stage anaerobic fermentation system. Firstly, the co-production of MCFAs and LCAs was investigated and compared at high carbon-molar ratios of ED to EA (i.e., ethanol to WASAFL carbon molar ratios are 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1). Then, the modified Gompertz equation was applied to simulate the maximum production potential of MCFAs and LCAs. Moreover, microbial community comparison was conducted to elucidate the performance of co-production of MCFAs and LCAs under different CE conditions."
1,Material and methods,
2,WAS feedstock,"2.1 WAS feedstock The WAS used in this study was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank of Quyang municipal WWTP (Shanghai, China). The collected sludge was stored at 4 °C and concentrated by settling 1 day for later use. The main characteristics of the concentrated WAS were presented in Table 1 ."
3,Experiment settings of the whole reaction,"2.2 Experiment settings of the whole reaction As the direct ethanol addition could exert toxicity effect on acidogenic microorganism, inhibiting the hydrolysis of organic matter and SCFAs production (Grootscholten et al., 2014). More recently, a few researchers have demonstrated that MCFAs production from organic wastes using the two-stage fermentation strategy can avoid the toxicity effects of both high concentrations of ethanol and produced MCFAs on hydrolysis (Grootscholten et al., 2014; Reddy et al., 2018). Therefore, to obtain better products yield, SCFAs production from alkaline fermentation of WAS (i.e., the preparation of WASAFL) and chain elongation of WASAFL using ethanol as ED were divided into two stage. In brief, the WAS was first treated by alkaline condition (pH=10) to produce SCFAs during the stage one. After the maximum SCFAs yield was achieved during the stage one, the obtained WASFL, which was employed as inoculum and EA, was fed together with ethanol to perform CE process during the stage two. The technical roadmap of this work was shown in Fig. 1 . 2.2.1 WAS alkaline fermentation experiment for SCFAs production (Stage one) Alkaline condition not only improved SCFAs production through increased soluble COD, but also inhibited SCFAs consumption by methanogens, thus enhancing SCFAs accumulation (Rao et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2006). Therefore, alkaline fermentation (i.e., pH=10) of WAS was performed in this study to produce SCFAs. Each reactor with working volume of 800 mL received 500 mL WAS as aforementioned, the pH was adjusted to 10 ± 0.1 with 3 M NaOH solutions. Then, the reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove residual oxygen, sealed and placed in an air-bath shaker (35 ± 1 °C) at stirring speed of 120 rpm. Each reactor was controlled pH at 10 ± 0.1 during anaerobic fermentation. Liquid samples were regularly taken to measure the produced SCFAs. When the SCFAs production was no long increasing, the leachate (containing SCFAs) was collected and stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C as the WASAFL for the later use of CE reactor. 2.2.2 Chain elongation experiments for MCFAs and LCAs production from WASAFL (Stage two) At Stage two (Fig. 1), CE experiments were conducted to evaluate MCFAs and LCAs production with ethanol as the ED and WASAFL as both the EA and inoculum under three different carbon molar ratio conditions, i.e., 3:1 (R1), 4:1 (R2) and 5:1 (R3), which were carried out in 3 identical serum vials with a volume of 120 mL. For each serum vial, 62.5 mL of WASAFL obtained in Section 2.2.1 was firstly added, then three concentrations of ethanol (i.e., 226.63 ± 2.52, 298.95 ± 3.96 and 380.59 ± 5.09 mmol/L) were also respectively added to achieve the desired carbon molar ratios of ED to EA (i.e., 3:1, 4:1, 5:1). The detailed concentrations of substrates used for CE experiments were shown in Table S1 (Supporting information). Moreover, to inhibit methanogenesis, i.e., the conversion of SCFAs to methane, a certain amount of 2-bromoethanosulfonic acid (10.5 g/L) was respectively added into each serum vial (Liu et al., 2017). The pH was adjusted to 5.5 by using 2.0 M hydrochloric acid and 2.0 M sodium hydroxide (Duber et al., 2018). The headspace was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min. After then, each serum vial was closed with a rubber stopper retained with an aluminum crimp cap. Finally, the serum vials were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C in an air-bath shaker (170 rpm). The CE experiments lasted over 30 days until the concentrations of MCFAs and LCAs were no long increasing and ethanol was not further consumed. All tests were conducted in triplicate."
4,Kinetic analysis of the MCFAs and LCAs production,"2.3 Kinetic analysis of the MCFAs and LCAs production A kinetic analysis was used to evaluate the products production potential and rates of the CE processes with WASAFL as EA and inoculum simultaneously, which were conducted in accordance with method reported by Diender et al. (2016). Briefly, the output of MCFAs and LCAs production under three different ratios of ethanol to WASAFL (i.e., 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1) were fitted by a modified Gompertz model (Eq. (1)) (1) P ( t ) = A m × exp { − exp [ V m × e A m ( γ − t ) + 1 ] } where P(t) is the cumulative product production (g COD/L) at time t; Am indicates the maximal product potential (g COD/L) at the end of anaerobic fermentation; t is the fermentation time (day); Vm is the maximum product production rate (g COD/L/d); γ represents the lag phase (day); and e is 2.71828. Among all the above parameters, Am and γ were simulated according to the real experimental data by OriginPro 8.4 (Origin Lab Corporation, MA, US)."
5,Microbial community analysis,"2.4 Microbial community analysis After the CE experiments with three different ratios of ethanol to WASAFL reached stable performance for MCFAs and LCAs production, three sludge samples were collected from the CE reactors and conducted Illumina Miseq sequencing analysis to further understand the CE process with WASAFL as both EA and inoculum from the aspect of microbial community. The original leachate of WASAFL was also performed microbial analysis as comparison. Moreover, to figure out the variations of the community structures of all samples during the whole CE period, the sludge samples from day 5 and 10 were taken out together for community analysis. Briefly, 8 mL of sludge mixture was taken out and centrifuged (4 °C, 12,000 rpm) for 5 min (Dynamica, Velocity 14R, Australia). The sediment was then stored in the refrigerator at −80 °C for later use. According to the protocols of manufacturer, the microbial DNA of all sludge samples was extracted with the Fast DNA™ Spin Kit for Soil (MP bio, U.S.). The concentration and purification of DNA were detected by NanoDrop 2000 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA). The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16S rRNA gene were amplified with primers 338F (5′- ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT −3′). The resulted PCR products were extracted from a 2% agarose gel and further purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit. Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired-end sequenced (2 × 300) on an Illumina Miseq platform. Raw fastq files were demultiplexes, quality-filtered by Trimmomatic and merged by FLASH. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered with 97% similarity cutoff using UPARSE, and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME. The taxonomy of each 16S rRNA gene sequences was analyzed by RDP Classifier algorithm against the Silva 16S rRNA database using confidence threshold of 70%."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods TS, VS/TS, TCOD, SCOD, protein and carbohydrate were analyzed using standard methods based on previous publications (Wang et al., 2019, Wei et al., 2017). Alcohols, SCFAs, and MCFAs fraction in liquid samples were measured by a Gas Chromatography (SHIMADAU GC 2010 Plus, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Stabilwax-DA polyethylene glycol capillary column. The analysis method was determined according to the method reported previously (Zhang et al., 2013). The sum of measured alcohols, SCFAs and MCFAs were calculated based on specific COD conversion coefficients (i.e. 1 g of ethanol = 2.09 g COD, 1 g of butanol = 2.59 g COD, 1 g of hexanol = 2.78 g COD, 1 g of acetate = 1.07 g COD, 1 g of propionate = 1.51 g COD, 1 g of butyrate = 1.82 g COD, 1 g of valerate = 2.04 g COD, 1 g of caproate = 2.21 g COD, 1 g of heptanoate = 2.34 g COD, 1 g of caprylate = 2.44 g COD) (Liu and Chen 2018)."
7,Results,
8,SCFAs production from WAS alkaline fermentation,"3.1 SCFAs production from WAS alkaline fermentation In the process of two-stage fermentation, SCFAs were both the key products of stage one (i.e., WAS alkaline fermentation) and the main substrates of following stage two (i.e., CE process). Fig.S1 shows the production of SCFAs from WAS alkaline fermentation. It could be observed that the concentration of SCFAs production almost no long changed after 8 d of fermentation, which was in accordance with previous literature (Yuan et al., 2006). As a result, 2730 mg COD/L of SCFAs in the leachate were obtained in this stage. Moreover, the SCFAs mainly were carboxylic acids with 2∼5 carbon atoms i.e., acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate, and the corresponding concentrations were respectively 1278 ± 45, 456 ± 20, 531 ± 15 and 465 ± 24 mg COD/L."
9,MCFAs and LCAs co-production in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation,"3.2 MCFAs and LCAs co-production in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation After WAS alkaline fermentation, the leachate from stage one was collected as WASAFL, which was then used for CE experiment working as EA and inoculum. To perform CE process (i.e., stage two), different ethanol levels were added into WASAFL according to the designed ED to EA ratios, i.e., R1(3:1), R2(4:1) and R3(5:1). Under the three conditions of substrate combination, the variation of substrates utilization and products generation were shown in Fig. 2 . As expected, three types of MCFAs (i.e., n-caproate, n-heptanoate and n-caprylate) and two types of LCAs (i.e., n-butanol and n-hexanol) were produced and reached to a stationary level at the end of 33-days fermentation. It was clearly to see that a high ratio of ED to EA was beneficial to the production of MCFAs and LCAs. The total cumulative MCFAs concentration slightly rose by approximately 0.02 g COD/L with an increase of the ED: EA ratio from 3:1 to 4:1, and then notably increased by around 2.06 g COD/L with the increase of ED: EA ratio to 5:1. In comparison, the final LCAs concentration significantly increased by 1.45 g COD/L with ED: EA ratio increased from 3:1 to 4:1, and then further increased slightly only by 0.19 g COD/L at the ED: EA ratio of 5:1. Therefore, both the maximum cumulative MCFAs and LCAs concentration were obtained with respect to the ED: EA ratio of 5:1, with the values of 7.67 ± 0.48 and 4.21 ± 0.19 g COD/L, respectively. Besides, the products production yields of MCFAs and LCAs in terms of SCFAs from WASAFL and ethanol were calculated by formula according to Eq (2) (Lonkar et al., 2016) and listed in the Table S2. Although both the MCFAs and LCAs production were highest at the ratio of ED: EA of 5:1, the total products production yields (MCFAs and LCAs together) did not change significantly under different ratio of ED: EA, ranging between 56.32–59.77%. This indicated that the high ratio of ED to EA evidently promoted the MCFAs and LCAs co-production, but had no significant influence on their production yields. But meanwhile, it should be noted that both the production of MCFAs and LCAs were closely related to their corresponding longer chain acyl-CoA, thus the competition between MCFAs and LCAs was existed in this co-fermentation system, too much increase on one side would lead to an increment decrease in the other (Gomez and Cantero, 2007; Machado et al., 2012). (2) Production yield = Produced products ( g ) Total SCFAs ( g ) + Fed ethanol ( g ) × 100 % Where produced products refer to MCFAs or LCAs As shown in Fig. 2 (A, C, E), the concentration of ethanol under three fermenters decreased rapidly at the initial 2–10 days and then gradually further decreased. When the ethanol concentration no long decreased (i.e., 28∼33 days), the MCFAs and LCAs production also reached to a stationary level (Fig. 2B, 2D, 2F), indicating that ethanol was mainly consumed to produce MCFAs and LCAs during CE of WASAFL. However, ethanol was only depleted just at the ED: EA ratio of 3:1, and over 20% of ethanol was left at another two ED to EA ratios (i.e., 4:1 and 5:1), which suggested that the residual ethanol could not participate in CE process. This may be due to the large amount of undissociated MCFAs produced that has a toxic effect on CE microorganisms (Coma et al., al.,2016; Skrivanova et al., 2006). The inhibitory effect of MCFAs on CE process have been unveiled by previous study. Specifically, when the undissociated caproate exceeds 0.2 g/L, it can inhibit microbial activity and its own production (Liu et al., 2017). In this study, due to the high accumulated MCFAs concentration with a relatively low pH value (5.03 and 4.94, respectively), the concentration of undissociated caproate was speculated as 0.24 g/L and 0.44 g/L at the case with ED: EA ratio of 4:1 and 5:1, respectively. As for the EAs, it was worth noting that except for propionate, all the other SCFAs (i.e., acetate, butyrate and valerate) were more or less left in the three fermenters. The depletion of propionate in the first 7 days under all fermentation conditions is likely due to that propionate could only be consumed as the substrate, chain elongating to valerate and further to n-heptanoate, but not be generated during CE process. The butyrate and valerate had not been exhausted thoroughly, the concentration of butyrate even increased substantially. The constant concentration of valerate and the increase in butyrate implied that although they were continually consumed to produce MCFAs (i.e., n-caproate and n-heptanoate) and LCA (i.e., n-butanol), they could be produced via the CE of propionate and acetate. Interestingly, although acetate, as the main EA, cannot be generated by the CE process, its concentration slightly increased at the case with ED: EA ratio of 3:1 and 4:1. This suggested a certain amount of acetate was generated in the R1 and R2 fermenter. The generation of acetate may mainly come from the oxidation of ethanol and homoacetogenesis process. In the open culture system, it was inevitably that ethanol would be dispersed to take place excessive ethanol oxidation to generate acetate, competing with CE process (Spirito et al., 2018). In addition, H2 could be produced (Figure S2 in SI) during CE, which could serve as the ED for the formation of acetate through homoacetogenesis (Saady 2013; Spirito et al., 2014)."
10,MCFAs and LCAs selectivity and electron efficiency in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation,"3.3 MCFAs and LCAs selectivity and electron efficiency in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation The final products distribution based on the electron contained in all organic substances at three different ED to EA ratios were calculated and presented in Fig. 3 A. The highest cumulative MCFAs selectivity, accounting for 42.7% of the total organic carbon contents, was achieved at the highest ratio of ED to EA (i.e., 5:1), which was similar with the total MCFAs production. By comparison, the selectivity of MCFAs was occupied for 38.1% and 39.3% at the ED: EA ratios of 3:1 and 4:1, respectively. However, the obtained MCFAs selectivity in this study was much lower than that reported by our previous research with the similar fermentation system, which achieved the highest total proportion of MCFAs of 72.9% at the ED to EA ratio of 1:1 (Wu et al., 2019b). The decrease in the MCFAs selectivity in this system could be ascribed to the generation of LCAs, which can compete with MCFAs (see Section 3.2). Notably, although LCAs production was highest at the ratio of ED: EA of 5:1 (Fig. 2F), the highest total selectivity of LCAs was obtained at the ED: EA ratio of 4:1 and accounted for 28.7%. At another two conditions, the LCAs selectivity separately was 17.7% and 23.6% at the ED: EA ratio of 3:1 and 5:1. Calculating all products (i.e., MCFAs and LCAs) together, the highest total product selectivity (i.e., 68.0%) was also obtained at ED: EA ratio of 4:1 instead of 5:1. In fact, in addition to the products selectivity, the total products electron efficiency can also reflect the energy recovery from fermentation organics and the degree of electrons from substrates to products, which normally was calculated by metric according to Eq (3) (Liu et al., 2017). Since the total mass of gas products (mainly hydrogen) were only around 0.1∼0.3 mmol, the corresponding slight change in consumption substrates (∼ 0.2∼0.6 mmol electrons) was not considered in calculation. Fig. 3B demonstrates the total products (MCFA and LCA) electron efficiency during the whole CE reaction. The calculated total substance electrons were increased slighter within 9% than the sum electrons of SCFAs contained in WASAFL and consumed ethanol, which possibly obtained from the organics of inoculum and indicated the roughly balanced electrons in the WASAFL fermentation system. Under three ratios of ED to EA, the product equilibrium reached fastest (on day 14) at the highest ratio of ED to EA (i.e., 5:1). And after 28 days fermentation when ethanol was no long consumed (see Figs. 2 and 3B), all the product output efficiency basically reached a stable stage. The highest total proportion of products, i.e., 72.1%, was observed at ED: EA ratio of 5:1. Although, by the end of the CE, the electron efficiency was much same at ED: EA ratio of 4:1 and 5:1. (3) Electron efficiency = electron number in product electron number in WASAFL + electron number consumed in ethanol × 100 %"
11,Kinetic analysis of MCFAs and LCAs production in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation,"3.4 Kinetic analysis of MCFAs and LCAs production in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation In order to assess the total production potential and rates of MCFAs and LCAs during the CE experiments, a modified Gompertz equation was applied to fit the experimental data of total MCFAs and LCAs production under different ED to EA ratios. As n-caproate could act as substrate for both n-caprylate and n-hexanol formation, thus the estimated total production of n-caproate was calculated by the sum of the observed concentration of n-caproate plus n-caprylate and n-hexanol (Diender et al., 2016). Fig. 4 showed the simulated MCFAs and LCAs production profiles by the modified Gompertz equation, which well captured the experimental data in each case (R2 > 0.95). The specific values of three kinetic parameters, i.e., maximum product yield potential (Am), the maximum product production rate (Vm) and lag phase time (γ), were listed in Table S3. On the whole, high ratio of ED: EA was positively correlated with high Am and Vm. The highest Am of both MCFAs and LCAs was attained at the ratio of ED: EA of 5:1, which was increased respectively by approximately 29% (from 8.37 ± 0.18 g COD/L to 10.77 ± 0.41 g COD/L) and 55% (from 2.67 ± 0.05 g COD/L to 4.15 ± 0.18 g COD/L) in comparison to that at ED: EA ratio of 3:1. Similar trend was also clearly observed in the Vm. Except for n-caprylate, which maintained a constant production rate due to the toxicity effect of substrate (ethanol) and products counteracted the high substrate supply by the high ratio of ED: EA, the Vm of all the other products increased by 1.06–4.38 times when the ED to EA ratio was increased from 3:1 to 5:1. However, higher ratio of ED: EA extended the appearance time of products, resulting in long γ. The simulated γ of almost all products (MCFAs and LCAs) was extended by 1.03–4.47 times from ED: EA ratio of 3:1 to 5:1. These results indicate that high ratio of ED: EA did significantly enhance MCFAs and LCAs maximum yield potential and speed their production rate, but extend their appearance time."
12,Microbial community analysis for MCFAs and LCAs production in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation,"3.5 Microbial community analysis for MCFAs and LCAs production in the CE process of WASAFL fermentation To further clarify the mechanisms of WASAFL as EA and inoculum to produce MCFAs and LCAs via two-stage system, the microbial community structures under different ethanol to WASAFL ratios were detected and compared. Among all samples, R0 represented the original inoculum, R1, R2 and R3 were enriched from CE sludge with ED: EA ratios of 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1. All samples finally yield 42,360 reads and covered 732 OTUs on average. The rarefaction curves of all samples at 0.03 distance showed that all lines reached saturation and shared the same abscissa (Fig. S3 in SI), proving that the captured microbial OTUs were representative and reliable. The α diversity is a comprehensive indicator of microbial community richness and diversity, which can be reflected by Chao index and Simpson index, respectively. The corresponding specific values of four samples were presented in Table S4. It was found that the α diversity of the CE sludge samples with larger Chao and lower Simpson index were significantly higher (p< 0.05) than those of the original inoculum (i.e., R0), indicating that the diversity and richness of the microbial community was increased during the CE process. Fig. 5 A shows the phylum-level distribution of the microbial abundance of four samples. Among the top 9 phyla, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were thought to be able to isolate wild-type strain bacterial strains that produce MCFA (Angenent et al., 2016). However, the relative abundance of these two phyla was not completely consistent with the increase of ED: EA ratio. Proteobacteria decreased from 11.23% in the inoculum to 5.64∼7.45% of three CE sludge samples, but phylum Firmicutes increased from 6.41% to 11.8∼18.52%. Thus, further research and comparation on genus and species level were essential, which could provide more accurate information on microbial functions and metabolic capacities (Chen et al., 2016). Fig. 5B exhibits the final microbial compositions at genus level in different sludge samples. There was no detection of genus-level microorganisms from Proteobacteria related to CE process. Genera Clostridium sensus stricto, Caproiciproducens and Eubacterium affiliated to Firmicutes were responsible for CE process (Angenent et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015). Its abundances increased from 0.17%, 0, and 0 in original inoculum (i.e., R0) to 1.02∼2.59%, 0.38%∼1.58% and 1.73E-5∼4.9E-4 in CE sludge samples (i.e., R1, R2 and R3, respectively). Blasting the OTUs belonged to Clostridium sensus stricto, Caproiciproducens and Eubacterium on National Central for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database to figure out the species information and the corresponding results were presented in Table S5. It can be seen that these matched species all belonged to Clostridium sensus stricto, but no species belonging to Caproiciproducens and Eubacterium. Concretely, some of OTUs belong to Clostridium Kluyveri (Identity >99%), which was by far the best-known species to produce MCFAs (Angenent et al., 2016). It was reportedly that the C. Kluyveri could ferment ethanol and acetate into butanol and hexanol (Dekishima et al., 2011). The relative abundance of C. Kluyveri was enriched from 0 in R0 (initial inoculum) to 0.85% in R3 (ED: EA of 5:1). Moreover, some of the OTUs from Clostridium sensus stricto were identified to Clostridium ljungdahlii (Identity >94.85%) and Clostridium autoethanogenum (Identity >96.93%), which were reported to be capable of reducing carboxylates to their responding alcohols (Perez et al., 2013; Richter et al., 2016). C. ljungdahlii enriched from 0% to 0. 2% and C. autoethanogenum enriched from 0% to 0.53% from R1to R3. These results were accordance with the produced content of LCAs, which proved both C. ljungdahlii and C. autoethanogenum might positive correlated with the production of LCAs. This could reveal what happens in CE process and explain why MCFAs and LCAs could be co-produced from the aspect of microbial community. Several other genera such as Acinetobacter, Exilispira, Oscillibacter involved in anaerobic fermentation were also enriched during CE process. It was demonstrated that Oscillibacter and Acinetobacter were positively correlated with the production of MCFAs (Wu et al., 2018). Their abundances were found to be 0 and 0 in original inoculum (i.e., R0) while 1.69∼4.93% and 1.82E-4∼5.53E-4 in CE sludge samples (i.e., R1, R2 and R3, respectively). Till now, there is no research of directly performing CE process by these bacteria, however, the strong correlation between their abundance and CE products production demonstrated that they might be favorable for the CE process when utilizing WASAFL as substrate and ethanol as ED. In addition, the WASAFL obtained from stage one, containing lots of SCFAs as EA, also worked as the inoculum during stage two, its time-series shift of key microorganisms associated with SCFAs production and CE were presented in Fig. 6 . The key microorganisms involved in the SCFAs production in this system were mainly affiliated to the genera of Fonticella sp. and Proteiniclasticum sp. (Luo et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2018), etc. The continuing fermentation time changed the microbial community structures mainly by weakening these SCFAs producers, that their total relative abundance was 1.2% on day 0 (R0), then significantly decreased to 0.08–0.37% (R1-R3) during day 5–10 due to the rapid enhancement of CE, and finally reduced to 0.05–0.35% at the end of the CE experiment (33 day). In contrast, the extension of CE fermentation time enriched these CE related microbes (i.e., Clostridium sensus stricto, Oscillibacter, Acinetobacter), that the relative abundance significantly increased from 0.55% on day 0 (R0) to 15.93–19.4% on day 5 (R1-R3), then further increased to 18.24–25.49% on day 10 (R1-R3), but finally decreased to 5.42–7.87% on day 33. These results were consistent with the variation of CE performance (Fig. 2) and products production rate (Fig. 4), which clearly proved that the functional microorganisms were shifted in the direction from SCFAs production to CE process with rapid growth during 0–10 day and then decreased growth afterwards."
13,Discussion,"This study confirmed the practicability of using a real WASAFL as substrate and ethanol as ED via CE process to achieve the co-production of more valuable products i.e., MCFAs and LCAs. This was experimentally demonstrated in a two-stage system consisted of SCFAs production from alkaline fermentation (i.e., the preparation of real WASAFL) and CE experiment. The two-stage system separated the acidification of WAS and CE processes, avoiding the toxicity from both high concentrations of ethanol and generated MCFAs on WAS hydrolysis (Grootscholten et al., 2014). Both the SCFAs production and CE process were guaranteed to operate under their separate optimal conditions. As a result, abundant of SCFAs were generated in stage one, then the leachate of stage one reacted with ethanol to perform CE, obtaining high yield of MCFAs and LCAs. The beneficial of two-stage system over single-stage system have also been verified by other literatures. Grootscholten et al. separately conducted the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) hydrolysis and CE experiment in two consecutive reactors, and the yield of MCFAs achieved was almost 5 times that of one stage system with the same substrates (Grootscholten et al., 2014). Reddy et al. also obtained high caproate production (8.1 g/L) through the operation of a two-stage reactor with food waste as fermentation substrate (Reddy et al., 2018). In stage two, the CE results showed that higher ED to EA ratio boosted the co-production as well as electron efficiency of MCFAs and LCAs. The maximum MCFAs and LCAs production was respectively 7.67 ± 0.48 g COD/L and 4.21 ± 0.19 g COD/L, which was achieved at the highest ED to EA ratio of 5:1. Meanwhile, the total product electron efficiency increased from 59.9% at ED: EA ratio of 3:1 to 72.1% at ED: EA ratio of 5:1 (Fig. 4B). The high ratio of ED to EA was benefited to the production of MCFAs, which was consistent with previous reports. Yin et al. (2017) reported that within the appropriate concentration range, the yield of MCFAs (mainly caproate) increased with the increase of ethanol/acetate ratio, which possibly due to high ethanol concentration promoted microbial growth. Similarly, Lonkar et al. (2016) observed that higher alcohol to acid ratio enhanced the MCFAs production because of active CE microorganisms and high substrate availability when ethanol concentration was maintained within 5∼10 g/L. However, to our present knowledge, there is no research concerned on the co-production of MCFAs and LCAs with organic waste as substrate directly. Theoretically, the LCAs could be generated via the reduction of their corresponding carboxylic acids or directly through the CoA-dependent pathway (Machado et al., 2012; Richter et al., 2016). Namely, the n-butanol and n-hexanol could be produced from the reduction of n-butyrate and n-caproate or the catalyzation of butyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA. During CE process, n-butyrate was mainly produced via the combination of butyryl-CoA with acetate, likewise, n-caproate was produced via the combination of hexanoyl-CoA with n-butyrate (Spirito et al., 2014). Consequently, no matter which pathway was predominant, the production of LCAs was mainly related to the content of their corresponding CoA. Substantial acetyl-CoA could be generated from ethanol at the high ratio of ED to EA (Angenent et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016), which provided the sufficient substrate for CoA with long carbons, resulting in high concentration of LCAs. Surprisingly, with the increase of ED: EA ratio from 3:1 to 5:1, the proportion of remaining ethanol in the reactor increased from 0 to 25.53% (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, it can be observed that the concentration of ethanol decreased the slowest after the 10 d in the case of ED: EA ratio of 5:1, as compared with other two ED to EA ratios. This was likely attributed to the toxicity of the produced undissociated caproate affecting the activity of the CE microorganisms. Theoretically, the dissociation of carboxylic acids was calculated using the formula pH=pKa + lg (dissociated carboxylic acid/undissociated carboxylic acid). When the concentration of produced MCFA is very high and/or the environment is at rather acidic condition, it is likely to generate undissociated MCFAs. At the ED: EA ratio of 4:1 and 5:1, the concentration of produced MCFAs were rather high with a relatively low pH value (5.03 and 4.94, respectively), resulting in that the final concentration of undissociated caproate reached up to 0.24 g/L and 0.44 g/L, exceeding the toxicity threshold (∼0.2 g/L) on the microorganism (Liu et al., 2017). It could also be therefore understood that there is a large amount of ethanol and butyrate at higher ED: EA ratios (i.e., 4:1 and 5:1), but the concentrations of MCFAs and LCAs cannot continue to increase in the later period of the CE experiment, which resulted in the total product production yields (Table S2) and the maximum total product selectivity not increasing with the increase of ED: EA ratios (Fig. 3). Moreover, the toxic effect of undissociated caproate may also be the reason for the prolonged appearance of the product. When the ED: EA ratio increased from 3:1 to 5:1, the simulated lag phase time of MCFAs and LCAs was extended by 1.03–4.47 times (Fig. 4). For instance, the n-caprylate production time was delayed from the early period to the later period of the CE experiment with the increase of ED: EA ratio from 3:1 to 5:1. The co-production of MCFAs and LCAs could be supported by the variations of the decreased SCFAs producers and enriched functional CE microorganisms such as Clostridium Kluyveri, Clostridium ljungdahlii, Clostridium autoethanogenum, Oscillibacter and Acinetobacter. Concerned on previous studies with pure- or open-culture system, the above microorganisms were all affirmed as the beneficial microbes to MCFAs and LCAs production (Diender et al., 2016; Richter et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018). These microorganisms positively related to MCFAs and LCAs production were all observed the increased relative abundance after CE process, indicating that real WASAFL obtained in stage one can be utilized directly as EA and inoculum compared to the additional inoculum (i.e., digested sludge) used in our previous study. It should be noted that the abundance of CE related microbes was highest at 5–10 days due to the adequate substrate supply, and then decreased gradually because of the toxicity of produced MCFAs, which was consistent with the changes of CE performance (Fig. 2) and products production rate (Fig. 4). Large amount of previous studies has confirmed that WAS could be utilized as a recycle resource rather than a waste, for example resource recovery through the SCFA production of anaerobic fermentation (Yuan et al., 2016, Zhao et al., 2018). However, the low value and high solubility of SCFAs will inevitably limit the large-scale practical application of this method. In comparison, MCFAs and LCAs, which had higher caloric value and were easier to separate, could be processed into many commercial products (e.g. antimicrobial agent, animal food additive and fuel precursors etc.) for engineering application (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2017; Leng et al., 2017). In this study, the co-production of MCFAs and LCAs using real WASAFL simultaneously as EA and inoculum as well as ethanol as ED was fulfilled. The products performance and microbial analysis proved that WASAFL contained significant CE microbes and could be used directly to produce MCFAs and LCAs without inoculating exogenous microorganisms, meaning the ease of handing procedure and reduction of investment cost. A preliminary economic evaluation was conducted based on the results of lab-scale test in this study to estimate the potential economic feasibility of the proposed two-stage WAS fermentation technology. With increasing MCFAs (from 5.57–7.67 g COD/L) and LCAs (from 2.58–4.21 g COD/L) co-production from two-stage WAS anaerobic fermentation, the net economic benefit is estimated to be around 325.67 to 474.71 $/ton TS (Table S6). This net benefit arises from the enhanced MCFAs and LCAs production associated benefit overweighing the additional costs for ethanol and methane inhibitor. Therefore, this novel two stage WAS fermentation technology for MCFA and LCA co-production is economically favorable. While, for reasons concerning economic costs and eco-friendly considerations, the ethanol source should be obtained sustainably from some organic wastes (e.g., yeast-fermentation beer and syngas-fermentation effluent) or in-situ ethanol generation from wastewater in a bio-electrochemical system (Agler et al., 2012; Vasudevan et al., 2014), which might further facilitate the economic feasibility of the proposed technology. Considering the large amount of WAS daily generated worldwide, the two-stage method based on the combined anaerobic fermentation and CE biotechnology reported in this study therefore not only has potentially important significance for high-value energy recovery of sludge but also give great support to the long-term application of sludge anaerobic fermentation. However, it should be noted that the produced MCFA (i.e., undissociated caproate) could affect the microbial activity in CE system (Coma et al., 2016), affecting the production of MCFAs and LCAs at high ethanol to WASAFL ratio. Therefore, to improve ethanol utilization, MCFAs and LCAs production yields and selectivity as well as shorten lag phase time, the product extraction system should be applied in future study to weaken the toxic effect of CE products. In addition, one of the main purposes was to evaluate the feasibility of co-production of MCFAs and LCAs at high ratio of ED to EA. Only three ratios of ED to EA (i.e., 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1) were performed. Therefore, to obtain the optimal production of MCFAs and LCAs, more and comprehensive ratios of ED to EA should be conducted in the future."
14,Conclusions,"The feasibility of achieving the co-production of MCFAs and LCAs using real WASAFL simultaneously as EA and inoculum as well as ethanol as ED was comprehensively assessed by CE performance assays in this work. The co-production of MCFAs and LCAs was increased with the increase of the carbon molar ratio of ethanol to WASAFL, but the maximum total product selectivity was achieved at the ED: EA ratio of 4:1 due to the high accumulation of n-butyrate. The kinetic analysis showed the data were well fitted to the modified Gompertz equation, all the maximal MCFAs and LCAs production potential and rate as well as lag phase time increased with the increase of ED: EA ratio from 3:1 to 5:1. The functional microorganisms were shifted in the direction from SCFAs production to CE process in the early stage of WASAFL fermentation. The relative abundances of Clostridium Kluyveri, Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium autoethanogenum, which were positively related to MCFAs and LCAs production, enriched during the CE process, indicating that real WASAFL can be utilized directly as inoculum."
