0,Introduction,"Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have aroused the interest of the scientific and technical communities due to their wide range of applications, versatility, low cost, and minimal environmental impact. These compounds are formed by mixing a hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) and a hydrogen-bond donor (HBD). On the one hand, the role of the hydrogen-bond acceptor is taken usually by a halogenated quaternary salt with a high melting temperature. On the other hand, the donors are common compounds with the presence of hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. The number of DESs with the melting point near the ambient temperature resulting from different HDA and HBD combinations is immense and allows multiple employment [1,2]. The applications of DESs lie from solvent extraction and carbon dioxide capture [3–5] to biomass processing [6–8], metal processing [9–11], pharmaceutical formulations [12–14], and energy applications [15–17]. Among these compounds, the choline-based DESs are the most popular, and their applications are broad [18]. For this same reason, these solvent are also the most studied and characterised. Consequently, thermophysical properties such as density and melting points and some transport properties such as viscosity can be found in the literature [19–21]. Despite this, extensive DES data are still sparse. Moreover, the understanding and modelling of thermophysical properties of DESs are still a rough and unexplored terrain, mainly for the complexity of their hydrogen-bonding interactions [22–25]. These aforementioned bondings drive the behaviour of DESs, and their interaction with other compounds, mainly if other associative and polar compounds need to be considered. Molecular modelling techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo methods [26,27], and other computational methods, such as continuous media solvation models (e.g., COSMO-RS) [28], may contribute to macroscopic and microscopic insight aspects of the behaviour of fluids, particularly of new solvents. In DESs, the hydrogen bonds and their interactions have a high impact on the phase behaviour and the transport properties [22]. Besides, equations of state (EOSs) are tools linked with thermodynamics for more than a century since the model proposed by van der Waals acquired a usable form [29–31]. Despite this, in DESs, more sophisticated models are required due to their short range-strong interactions. SAFT-like family EOSs [32–36], which come from the Barker and Henderson perturbation theory [37,38] and Wertheim’s theory of association [39–41], solve the above problem, including a direct contribution of these interactions. Additionally, the combination of computational techniques and theoretical modelling tools fulfils another critical challenge in the DES modelling; the limited reliable experimental data, particularly of mixtures with water and organic solvents. Alkhatib et al. [42] set the guidelines for the modelling of DESs, the challenges, and the paths to follow in view of future developments. Perkins et al. [43] use simulation techniques to compute thermophysical properties and transport properties of choline-chloride based DESs (ethylene glycol, glycerol and malic acid). A good agreement with experimental data was found for thermophysical properties, but the prediction of transport properties was a more difficult labour. Salehi et al. [44] computed Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters by using molecular dynamics and mainly the OPLS force field. Wang et al. [22] experimentally analysed and apply quantum chemistry techniques to the hydrogen-bonding behaviour of choline chloride (ChCl) with polyols, showing that the stronger interaction in these mixtures is the association between the chlorine (Ch) cation and the hydroxy group. González de Castilla et al. [45] explore the possibilities of DESs modelling using excess models, EOS and molecular dynamics, emphasising equilibrium predictions. Shehata et al. [46] analyse the hydration effect in choline chloride plus urea DES by molecular dynamics and its influence on the DES performance as reaction media. In the same line, Abranches et al. [12] study the design of DESs for pharmaceutical applications by COSMO-RS. Atilhan et al. [47] use molecular dynamics to compute the surface interaction of DESs with nanomaterials, also demonstrating the critical role of hydrogen bonds in the behaviour of mixtures. Naik et al. [48] investigate the phase equilibrium of phosphonium and ammonium-based DESs. In the same study, an analysis of the coordination numbers (CN) and the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the aforementioned DESs is performed. Ashworth et al. [24] show complex association behaviours in choline chloride plus urea using ab initio quantum chemistry methods. A wide range of hydrogen-bond interactions is identified in the above system in contrast with traditional solvents, where homogeneous short-range interactions can be observed. Baz et al. [49] studied the aqueous choline chloride plus glycerol (1:2) mixtures from molecular dynamics and modelling. Radial distribution functions and the number of hydrogen bonds derived from molecular simulations confirmed an anticipated bonding network within the liquid, with significant ordering interactions. When water is added to the DESs, it can also become incorporated into this structure and becomes strongly bound. Water reduces the viscosity of the DESs, but the solvents retain their characteristics. In addition, the number of hydrogen atoms available for hydrogen bonding in the donor and acceptor groups influences the formation and stability of the DESs, along with the spatial positions of those groups. Triolo et al. [50] studied the choline chloride plus water natural DESs using molecular dynamics in a recent contribution. A structural and hydrogen bond analysis highlighted the importance of choline cations surrounding the aqueous environment. Moreover, in all the systems, strong hydrogen-bonding interactions also played an essential role between water molecules and between water and anions. This work aims to link the thermophysical properties from experimental data, molecular simulations, and theoretical modelling using SAFT EOS, emphasising the hydrogen-bonding interactions of choline chloride plus ethylene glycol in a 1:2 ratio (sometimes called ethaline) and choline chloride plus glycerol in a 1:2 ratio (sometimes called glyceline) plus methanol. The above labour is performed by all-atoms molecular dynamics simulations of thermodynamic and structural properties and contrasting the results with predictive modelling using the PC-SAFT EOS [35,34] together with the free volume theory (FVT) for viscosity. The rest of the work is organised in a section containing the simulation and modelling detail, a section containing the results and discussion, and finalising with the concluding remarks."
1,Theoretical background and simulation details,
2,Modelling,"2.1 Modelling The Statistical Association Fluid Theory (SAFT) EOS [32,33,51] is a well known molecular-based equation based on statistical mechanics principles. In this work, the perturbed-chain (PC) SAFT is applied as calculation tool [34,35]. The above version of SAFT is recognised by provide good results in representing the behaviour and thermophysical properties in a wide range of fluids of different complexity, including DESs [52–54]. Since PC-SAFT is a known structure, only a brief description is presented here. However, a detailed description is available in the original work [34,35]. PC-SAFT EOS is typically expressed as an addition of contributions to the Helmholtz energy function, where each term contains a different physical feature of the molecule, which contribute to the total energy of the system. In this case, an associative chain is represented by (1) a ̃ = a ̃ i + a ̃ hs + a ̃ ch + a ̃ disp + a ̃ a where a ̃ is the dimensionless Helmholtz energy function. In Eq. (1), the superscripts concern the ideal, hard-sphere (or repulsive), chain, dispersive and association contributions, respectively. In this structure, it is usual to join the repulsive and chain contribution in a reference contribution, i.e., a ̃ ref = a ̃ hs + a ̃ ch . Additionally, the associative contribution is given by the sum of the links among non-bonded sites over of different kinds and each compound, whereby (2) a ̃ a = ∑ i = 1 n x i ∑ Ω k , i ∈ S i S i ln X Ω k , i - 1 2 X Ω k , i + 1 2 where S i is a set with elements that are the sites of different kinds of the ith molecule. In the present contribution, choline chloride and methanol (MOH) are represented by the 2B scheme [35,55]. In contrast, to assess the association capability of hydrogen bond donors, ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol (G) are modelled with 2B and 4C schemes [55–57]. The association among compounds forming the DESs and methanol is represented in Fig. 1 , and the pure-compound parameters are summarised in Table 1 . The free volume theory (FVT) is used for viscosity calculations. The FVT theory expresses the dynamic viscosity as a sum of two contributions, whereby (3) η = η 0 + Δ η where η 0 is the viscosity of a diluted gas [58] based on the Chapman-Enskog theory [59] while Δ η is a dense fluid contribution. The aforementioned contribution is based on the relation between the viscosity and the microstructure of the fluid and, in its most common form, constrains three fitted parameters. Consequently, the dense-fluid contribution of the FVT is given by [60,61] (4) Δ η = L v α ρ 2 RT - a ̃ v M w RT 3 1 / 2 exp B α ρ M w RT - a ̃ v ρ 3 / 2 where M w is the molecular weight, ρ the number density, R the gas constant, T the thermodynamic temperature, and a ̃ v is the volume derivative of the dimensionless Helmholtz energy function. Furthermore, L v , α , and B are parameters for the model. Among these parameters, L v is an homogeneous parameter linked with the average quadratic length, α is a constant of proportionality for E 0 / ρ , being E 0 the barrier of energy that a molecule must cross to diffuse, whereas B is characteristic of the free-volume overlap. The FVT parameters are shown in Table 2 ."
3,Details of molecular dynamics,"2.2 Details of molecular dynamics Molecular dynamic simulations were performed using the GROMACS 5.1.4 program package [62] for simulating the homogeneous systems. Force field parameters for choline chloride, ethylene glycol, and glycerol were described using the all-atom optimised potential for liquid simulations (OPLS-AA) developed by Doherty and Acevedo [63], while OPLS-AA potential from Jorgensen et al. [64] was used for methanol. Cubic boxes were constructed using the Packmol package [65], containing choline chloride pairs with the ratio of ethylene glycol, glycerol and the proper concentration of MPH. Table 3 specifies the number of molecules and the corresponding box length of all systems studied in the present work. Periodic boundary conditions were employed with the short-range electrostatic cutoff set to 1.6 nm. Long-range electrostatics were treated with Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) summations [66,67] with a PME-order of four. Minimisation of each box was performed using a steepest-descent algorithm for at least 5000 steps. Temperature ranges were held constant using a velocity rescaling with a stochastic term (v-rescale) [68], and the pressure was maintained at 1.0 bar using the Berendsen coupling method [69] during an isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) for 10 ns of equilibration. Equations of motion were integrated with the leapfrog algorithm [70] using a time step of 1 fs. The LINCS method [71,72] constrained all covalently bound hydrogen atoms with an order of four. The number of iterations to correct for rotational lengthening in LINCS was set to two. Production runs were carried out for an additional 50 ns by using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [73,74] by isotropic coupling with a coupling constant of τ P = 2 ps. The trajectory of the last 25 ns was used for calculation of thermodynamic and structural properties, using the GROMACS analysis tools. Site-to-site RDF, CNs, and the average number of hydrogen bonds were considered in our analysis, whose interpretation is shown in Fig. 2 . Additional independent simulations were performed for another 10 ns to compute the viscosity at selected concentrations of methanol. The approach builds non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations using the perturbation method prosed by Hess [75]. The method is based on the generation of a velocity field, v x z , which is imposed along one direction of the simulation box. The field satisfies the Navier-Stokes equation using a cosine function A cos k z z , assuming it has only the x-component, and it is a function of z only. Here k z = 2 π / L z is the wave vector and L z is the box length in the z direction. The corresponding velocity is given by (5) v x z = V cos k z z with V = A ρ / k z 2 η . In MD, the maximum amplitude of the acceleration, A , can be added to each step, hence an average of A ρ / k z 2 η can be computed to give the value of η . It is important to remark that A must be small enough so that the perturbation does not disturb the system equilibrium but large enough to ensure proper sampling. Values for A were selected from the work of Doherty and Acevedo [63] in the ranges of 0.04 nm ps−2 to 0.24 nm ps−2."
4,Results,
5,Thermophysical and transport properties,"3.1 Thermophysical and transport properties Density, excess volume and viscosity were determined by computational methods, and theoretical prediction at 1.01325 bar and 308.15 K and the results are summarised in Table 4 . Following the idea of Zubeir et al. [55], to obtain a more accurate result, a linear temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter, k 12 , between choline chloride and HBDs was used. It is important to mention that they were not adjusted to experimental data obtained for the DESs plus methanol. Thus, PC-SAFT does not require any calibration for methanol mixtures and was applied in a fully predictive model. The interaction parameters optimised to the density data [19] for each associative scheme are listed in Table 5 . Figs. 3 and 4 show the density and the excess volume of both mixtures at 1.01325 bar and 308.15 K, compared with experimental results, molecular simulation and PC-SAFT calculations. For density, the average absolute deviations (AAD) with MD are 0.641% and 0.532% for the ChCl:EG plus methanol and the ChCl:G plus methanol mixtures, respectively. In contrast, the predictive PC-SAFT model, with both associative models for the HBDs, yields more minor deviation. It is interesting to note that 2B and 4C models for the HBDs are in close agreement. Fig. 4 shows that HBDs form non-ideal mixtures with methanol exhibiting negative excess volume over the entire concentration range. MD and PC-SAFT are in fair agreement with the reported experimental data [76]. The negative excess volume shows stronger interactions between DESs and methanol in the mixture resulting from the newly established hydrogen bonds. From a microscopical viewpoint, self-association between the species of the mixtures are weaker than those formed between the DES and the methanol. These results are equivalent to other volumetric data previously presented for ChCl:EG [77,78] and ChCl:G [79], where negative excess volumes are displayed. Experimental data suggest that the behaviour of the volumetric properties are similar. However, the volumetric reduction in the mixture is reduced when the chain length of the alcohol increases [80,78]. The viscosity was obtained applied an external force as described in SubSection 2.2. The viscosity values at 308.15 K for the ChCl:EG plus methanol and the ChCl:G plus methanol mixtures are shown in Fig. 5 . Despite the values having more discrepancy with the experimental data, their uncertainty is higher, and the approach also implies more dispersion. The accuracy of the method is compromised in the middle range of concentrations, despite the procedure having a good performance in the pure compound limit [20]. However, it is well-known that macroscopic viscosity is strongly linked with the behaviour of hydrogen bonds in the mixture due to the viscosity being an indicator of the resistance of the fluid to flow [81,82]. Therefore, the viscosity directly correlates with the strength of the hydrogen bonds [22]. The viscosities of DESs plus alcohols are reported in the literature at different molar ratios [82,83]. The aforementioned effect can be explained by changing of the association strength between DESs and methanol in the mixture. Molecular dynamic calculations yield AAD of 34.52% and 30.72% for ChCl:EG and ChCl:G, respectively. Further, both association schemes give similar AAD for both DESs, with values of 9.31% and 16.99% for ChCl:EG and ChCl:G plus methanol, respectively. Consequently, in the middle range of the mixture, the self-association of methanol gets weaker, and the cross-association between DESs and methanol is promoted. The above effect is challenging to render predictive and quantitatively. In the present case, the behaviour is found qualitatively and overestimated. The accurate prediction of viscosity and other properties is a solid reason to accurately model and understand in detail the influence of molecular behaviour and the hydrogen-bonding networks. The FVT, together with PC-SAFT EOS, which is proved to be a solid framework to predict viscosity [84], is applied to render the viscosity of the mixture. In both combinations of association schemes, the results can be considered satisfactory. However, the quality of the prediction of the FVT varies in the middle range of concentrations, given the convoluted behaviour of the molecules in the mixture. Alternatives to FVT coupled with different EOS are the friction theory [85] and the entropy scaling [86,87]. For the sake of ensuring predictability of the viscosity using the FVT, there are no additional parameters fitted. The parameters for choline chloride were taken from Crespo et al. [19], while the parameters for methanol and the HBDs were fitted using DIPPR data [88]. Accordingly, the water content in experimental measurements does not influence predicting the viscosity of the mixture, which given the hygroscopic nature of DESs, has a strong impact on the properties, particularly in transport properties [89,90]. An interesting test to measure the reliability of the associative models is the predictive calculation of the solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) according to (6) ln γ i l x i l = - Δ H ~ m , i RT 1 - T T m , i In Eq. 6 the mole-fraction solubility of component i in the liquid phase is determined using its activity coefficient γ i l in the liquid phase (calculated via PC-SAFT [34]) and its melting properties (melting temperature T m , i and melting enthalpy Δ H m , i taken from Ref. [91]). R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the melting temperature of the mixture. Fig. 6 shows the prediction of SLE for ChCl:EG and ChCl:G at all concentration range, compared with experimental results [91]. It is interesting to note that the use of density data does not capture the energetic contribution, which is taken into account in the cross-association terms. Nevertheless, the most accurate results are obtained using a most appropriate associative model (such as 4C) for ethylene-glycol and glycerol."
6,Structural behaviour,"3.2 Structural behaviour 3.2.1 Radial distribution functions Radial distribution functions (RDFs) were obtained at different methanol concentrations. In both studied mixtures, no significant RDF modifications were observed in the middle range of concentration. All the RDFs were computed over all the length of each simulation boxes shown in Table 3. However, the RDFs converge slightly above 1 nm. There is no evidence of long-range interaction in both mixtures in the liquid phase. The RDFs of the mixture ChCl:EG plus methanol are shown in Figs. 7 (a) to 7(c). It is important to note that the covalent distances of the hydroxyl groups, usually with a narrow peak around 0.1 nm, have been overlooked for clarity. Additionally, the non-hydroxyl hydrogens of ethylene glycol have a minor influence concerning the anion. The closer range interactions are often attributed to inter- or intramolecular interactions of the HBD precursors of the DESs. At longer distances, peaks around 0.2 nm appear. These peaks represent the association between hydroxyl groups of ethylene glycol and methanol, and such behaviour is linked with the positive excess properties of both mixtures. Also, in the 0.20 nm range, it is usual to find a peak representing the association between the hydroxyl group of choline chloride and ethylene glycol. The aforementioned link emerges in the same range but weak. Both facts suggest a strong influence of methanol in DESs and the strong structures formed in these mixtures. The coordination numbers obtained from RDFs are shown in Table 6 for pure DESs and their mixtures with methanol. The coordination numbers of these structures reveal a main solvation shell around choline and a minor solvation shell of choline cations of around five choline molecules; this is a reduction in the solvation shell of choline with respect to pure DES caused by the solvation of methanol. The self-association of ethylene glycol is displayed at longer distances than in pure DES. Two solvation shells between methanol and choline can be identified around 0.30 nm and 0.45 nm. The first one can be attributed to the association, while the second one could influence the anion in the mixture. Similar behaviour is found in the ChCl:G plus methanol. In this system, most interactions occur near 0.2 nm. Peaks displayed at distances greater than 0.3 nm are non-hydrogen bonded intramolecular interactions within the same molecule. The anion interactions also are displayed at 0.2 nm. A significant increment in the peak of methanol-anion interaction can be observed in the anion interactions, with a solvation shell of around four methanol molecules around the anion. Other structures in the mixture lose prominence for the above reason, such as the anion-choline and the anion-HBD interactions. Additionally, choline shows complex structures until 1.00 nm. These structures can be attributed to the long-range non-hydrogen bonded interaction of choline. The influence of methanol in both mixtures can be summarised as a competition of ethylene glycol and glycerol of the DESs and methanol for the place of the HDB of the system. In both mixtures, the addition of methanol does not affect the network of the hydrogen bonds of the mixtures. The only notorious exception of the above is the appearance of a long-range structure in OCh-OHBD RDF at 0.5 nm and 0.8 nm, which can be appreciated in Figs. 7(a) and Fig. 7(e). Similar structures emerge for the OCh-OHBD RDF in both mixtures. In DESs plus methanol mixtures, the basic characteristics of pure DESs are conserved. Despite this, adding methanol change the structure of solvation shells, where the interaction of HBD with methanol take centre stage. The complexity of the association behaviour of these mixtures shows why the modelling and prediction of this type of system continue to be a challenge. 3.2.2 Hydrogen bonds behaviour The number of hydrogen bonds is calculated at the simulated conditions by using a geometrical criterion to complete the structural description of the systems [92,93]. The above procedure considers determining the maximum distance and angle between donor-acceptor and hydrogen-donor-acceptor groups. Fig. 8 shows the distribution function used to correlate radial and angular distributions to elucidate the average orientation for each DES within the methanol concentration. The selection of hydrogen bond interactions was taken according to RDF’s results. It is interesting to note that while the methanol concentration increases, the first solvation shell related to the hydrogen bond formation exhibit a relatively simple dependence, at least for distances up to 0.35 nm and angles of 30 degrees in all interactions considered in this work. On the one hand, an analysis of the interaction between G (OH) - G (O) shows a strong and concentrated hydrogen bonding network, thus ensure that the mobility of the molecules is heavily restricted. When methanol is added to the system, the network is rearranged because methanol can penetrate the solvation layers, increasing the mobility of the glycerol molecule. This effect decreases viscosity and tends to be similar to EG (OH) - EG (O) interactions. From the selection of the geometrical criterium, some specific structural properties can be calculated. One of them is the fraction of molecules involved in self-association, defined as the ratio between the number of molecules involved in a hydrogen bond (at least once) with itself and the total number of the same molecules in bulk. It is worth noticing that this structural property can be compared independently from the calculation from Wertheim’s thermodynamic perturbation theory [94] into PC-SAFT EOS. The latter turns out to be a useful additional feature of the new theory in developing more realistic models of the hydrogen-bonding interaction in deep eutectic solvents. As can be seen from Fig. 9 choline chloride decreases monotonically, while methanol interaction increases. In both cases, the 2B associative model qualitatively reproduces the behaviour. An interesting case occurs for both hydrogen bond donors. While the 2B associative model shows that almost linearly ethylene glycol and glycerol decrease their interaction, MD results glimpse that the addition of methanol in the system is not affected by nearly 30% of methanol concentration. When the methanol content is higher than 30%, the methanol begins to create a network of hydrogen bonds with the components of the mixture. Therefore the networks among choline, chloride, ethylene glycol and glycerol are disrupted. It is important to remark that this effect is most evident in ethylene glycol, and also, the 4C associative model represents this behaviour qualitatively. An important piece of additional information can be collected by comparing the number of hydrogen bonds obtained through MD and PC-SAFT and the available experimental data. According to the results in Fig. 10 , the contribution of hydrogen bonds present a maximum of around 60% mole fraction of methanol; after this, the methanol-methanol hydrogen bonds begin to predominate over the HBD-HBD and HBD-methanol bonds. Our results are qualitative with those obtained in aqueous solutions using vibrational spectroscopy [95], in which interpret interactions of this type are addressed."
7,Concluding remarks,"This work has been devoted to studying the thermophysical and transport properties and the microstructure of the ChCl:EG plus methanol and ChCl:G plus methanol mixtures. For both mixtures, thermophysical properties, i.e., the density, excess volume and viscosity, were determined by molecular dynamics and predicted by PC-SAFT modelling using two different association schemes. On the one hand, good agreement is observed between molecular dynamics, SAFT prediction, and experimental data for thermophysical properties. On the other hand, the molecular dynamics calculations have a significant gap with the experimental data due to the complexity of the associative behaviour of both mixtures and the strong interaction between methanol and both DES in the mixture. Concerning structural behaviour, radial distribution functions and the characteristics of the hydrogen bonds were determined. The aforementioned analyses reveal consistent features in the short-range intermolecular forces. Choline chloride plus ethylene glycol and ChCl:G forms solvation shells with methanol different than which are formed in pure DES. Despite this, the main solvation shells present in DES are preserved. The incorporation of methanol in mixtures does not significantly affect the orientation of the original DES precursors but have a strong influence on the prominence of the HBD interactions with the HBA, where methanol causes changes in the bonds formed by the HBD acting like a second donors compound in the DES structure."
