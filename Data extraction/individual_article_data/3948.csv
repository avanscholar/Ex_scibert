0,Introduction,"Due to the increasing worldwide energy shortage and environmental concerns, the development of new environmentally friendly sustainable energy sources becomes urgent [1,2]. Hydrogen is a renewable and green energy. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation over the semiconductor-based photocatalyst under solar light irradiation is a good way to solve energy and environmental problems [3–6]. In it, active and stable photocatalysts are vital for highly efficient hydrogen evolution. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a new type of organic semiconductors with low cost, which has attracted great attention and extensive research in recent years due to its unique electronic structure and good stability [7–10]. Polymeric nature of g-C3N4 assures sufficient flexibility of the structure, which can serve as a promising candidate of outstanding compatibility to various materials, which opens up a new prospect to construct highly efficient and economical photocatalysis systems for hydrogen evolution. Nevertheless, due to insufficient light absorption, low charge mobility, and fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [11], its photocatalytic activity is still unsatisfactory, and needs to be much improved for applications. Therefore, the development of highly efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts has been one of the most important topics in photocatalysis. Generally, dye sensitization is a commonly used route in inorganic/inorganic and inorganic/organic semiconductors [12–14]. Porphyrin is regarded as an appealing dye because of its modified structure and high visible molar coefficient, which has been functional molecule for constructing various nanomaterials with excellent performances [15–18]. For example, by electrostatic interaction, π-π stacking or hydrogen bond, the porphyrin molecule is combined with g-C3N4, which exhibits enhanced photocatalytic performance in degradation [19] and hydrogen production [20]. However, g-C3N4 and porphyrin cannot be intimately combined because of the weaker interaction, which will reduce the photo-generated electron transfer efficiency. Moreover, the electrons easily recombine with the oxidized porphyrin molecules, which greatly decreases the activity and stability of photocatalysts. Therefore, it is important to accelerate electron transfer between g-C3N4 and porphyrin in order to obtain higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. Herein, with meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) as visible light absorption antennas, a novel g-C3N4-based nanocomposite is facilely fabricated by using Cu as the interfacial linker, and the assembly mechanism is explored. Compared with pure g-C3N4, the photocatalytic hydrogen production of the nanocomposite is significantly improved. In addition, the mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production and the possible mechanism of electron transfer in the nanocomposite are investigated in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials Meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd. CuCl2⋅2H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
3,Synthesis of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP nanocomposite,"2.2 Synthesis of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP nanocomposite g-C3N4 was synthesized from urea in a lidded alumina crucible by direct heating under ambient pressure [21]. Typically, 15 g of urea was placed into a crucible and heat-treated in a muffle furnace at 580 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1. After the muffle furnace was cooled to room temperature, yellow products (g-C3N4) were collected and ground into powder for further use. Then, g-C3N4 powder (50 mg) was completely dispersed into 45 mL of deionized water. 9 mL CuCl2⋅2H2O solution (9.1 × 10-3 mol L-1) was added into the above dispersion and stirred for 30 min. After that, 6 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) was added to the above mixed solution, and was continually stirred for 10 min, and the air in the system was removed by vacuum. This suspension was stirred and irradiated for 2 h with a 300 W Xe lamp. The solid (g-C3N4-Cu) was washed with ethanol and dried overnight at 60 °C. After that, 40 mL TCPP ethanol solution (6.3 × 10-5 mmol L-1) was injected into 50 mL g-C3N4-Cu ethanol dispersion (1 mg mL-1) under vigorous stirring, and reacted at 60 °C overnight. The target product was obtained after the solvent was evaporated. For comparison, g-C3N4-TCPP and g-C3N4-CuTCPP composites were prepared using the same procedure. The samples (g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP, g-C3N4-TCPP and g-C3N4-CuTCPP) were all not washed after the solvent was completely evaporated in order to keep same content of porphyrins in the composites. The content of Cu in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP nanocomposite was about 9.7 wt.% measured by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The contents of porphyrins in the samples were about 4 wt.%."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained with a UV-3900 spectrophotometer (Japan). The surface morphology of the sample was observed by a S-3400 N Hitachi ultrahigh resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV (Japan). The morphology of the composite was observed by a S-3400 N Hitachi High Technologies scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the element maps were taken using a JEOL JEM-2100 F microscope (Japan), and the accelerating voltage was 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic X-ray source (Al Kα hν =1486.6 eV) (USA). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Germany). The X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) was performed using a bench top energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (EDX4500H, Japan). Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were measured using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (USA). The fluorescence spectra of the solid samples were measured without pretreatment, and it was carried out at room temperature using a HITACHI F-4600 spectrophotometer (Japan). A nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was obtained at 77 K by using Quantachrome Instruments QUADRASORB SI volumetric adsorption analyzer (U.S.A.). The sample was pre-outgassed at 150 °C for 10 h under vacuum."
5,Electrochemical impedance measurement,"2.4 Electrochemical impedance measurement Electrochemical impedance experiments were performed on the CHI 660E electrochemical analyzer and recorded at room temperature in a standard three-electrode system with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, coated with sample) as the working electrode, Pt plate as the opposite electrode, and Ag/AgCl (with saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The preparation process of the working electrode was as follows: 2 mg of sample was added into 4 mL of alcohol, and then a certain amount of the obtained dispersion was dropped onto a FTO glass (1 cm × 2 cm). After the coated FTO dried naturally, a certain amount of the mixture was added again onto the FTO. The procedure was repeated several times. Finally, the FTO coated sample was placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the working electrode required for testing was obtained. 0.2 moL L -1 Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. Oxygen was removed by bubbling N2 for 15 min before measurement. The bias potential was -0.5 V. All tests were performed at room temperature."
6,Measurement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.5 Measurement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The H2 production experiments were carried out in a CEL-SP2N water splitting system (Zhongjiao Jinyuan Instruments, Beijing, China) with a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source. In a typical procedure, 10 mg of the sample was dispersed into 60 mL of 10 vol.% TEOA aqueous solution and completely removed oxygen before irradiation. In reaction process, the system was maintained at about 5.5 °C using flowing water (controlled by a pump). Before irradiation, it was evacuated by a vacuum pump in order to remove the air in the system. The amount of H2 produced was analyzed with an online TCD gas chromatography (AULTT Co., Beijing, the high-purity N2 (99.999 %) as a carrier gas)."
7,Results and discussion,"The morphology of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP nanocomposite is observed by SEM and TEM. The corresponding images are shown in Fig. 1 . Due to hydrogen bond interaction among the carboxyl groups in the TCPP and π-π interaction among TCPP macrocycles, an aggregated and curly sheet-like morphology is observed in the TEM image of the TCPP (Fig. 1a). The pure g-C3N4 shows thin lamellar-like morphology with some wrinkles and curling edges (Fig. 1b), which is slightly similar to that of the TCPP. After TCPP was introduced into the as-obtained g-C3N4, some amorphous aggregates on the g-C3N4 can be found, and the curling is partially reduced, as shown in Fig. 1c. It is deduced that π–π interaction between g-C3N4 and TCPP can partially reduce the curling of g-C3N4 to some extent. It is found that the random curling of the g-C3N4 is further decreased after introducing Cu in the interface of g-C3N4 and TCPP, and a layered nanostructure is observed (Fig. 1d and f). Compared with pure g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-TCPP, the thickness of the nanosheets increases, and accompanies by partially crimped nanosheets. Moreover, no particles are observed outside of the sheet-like nanostructure. Based on the morphological difference between g-C3N4-TCPP and g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP, it is deduced that a TCPP pillared g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP nanostructure could be formed by the coordination interaction between the carboxyl groups in the TCPP and the Cu implanted in the g-C3N4. In the visual field of high resolution transmission electron microscopy image of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite (Fig. 1e), no particles are observed, and the lattice fringe of the copper species is not observed either. It is indicated that the Cu in the composite is with small-size, good dispersion, and low crystalline, which will be confirmed by the followed results of TEM mapping and XRD. TCPP is difficult to be distinguished in the images of the composites due to its low content (only 4 wt. %) and the similar morphology as the g-C3N4. The existence of TCPP in the composite can be confirmed by the followed results of TEM mapping, XPS, and solid UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The presence of Cu in the composite is confirmed by TEM-assisted elemental mappings, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 a–e. C, N, O and Cu elements are all observed in the mappings, which coincide with the theoretical composition of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP. Especially, Fig. 2e shows the well-distributed Cu in the nanocomposite, which confirms the presence of Cu in the composite. Moreover, the main region of Cu distribution corresponds to those of the O and N. The above results indicate the formation of the nanocomposite and the intimate contact between g-C3N4-Cu and TCPP. The crystal structure of the samples was studied by XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . In the XRD pattern of the g-C3N4 (Fig. 3c), two distinct peaks at 12.7° and 27.5° are observed, which correspond to (100) and (002) crystal planes of the g-C3N4, respectively [22]. It is indicated that the g-C3N4 is with the interlayer stacking of aromatic systems and the in-plane repeat period. In the XRD pattern of the g-C3N4-TCPP (Fig. 3e), besides the peaks belonged to those of the g-C3N4, no other peaks are observed, indicating that the main phase of the g-C3N4 in the samples was not changed after introducing TCPP. As shown in Fig. 3f, a new diffraction peak at 2θ = 7.6° is observed, which is different from those of pure TCPP (Fig. 3a) and the g-C3N4-Cu (Fig. 3d). Compared with the peak at 2θ = 7.2° of the solid CuTCPP, it is right-shifted 0.4°. The result demonstrates that it is not the discrete CuTCPP piled up on the g-C3N4, and it is with a different layered nanostructure from the g-C3N4-CuTCPP. It could be attributed to the coordination of the Cu implanted in the g-C3N4 with the carboxyl groups in the TCPP (further evidenced by Figs. 4–6 followed). However, the diffraction peaks of the Cu (9.7 wt. %) are not noticeable in the XRD pattern of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP. It could be due to the Cu in the nanocomposite with small size and good dispersion. The result of XRD is consistent with those in Figs. 1 and 2. In order to confirm the valence state of copper in the nanocomposite, the interaction between Cu and g-C3N4-TCPP, and the composition of the target product, XPS of the samples are measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, XPS peaks of C, N, O and Cu can be observed. The C and N come from the g-C3N4 and TCPP. The O indicates the presence of TCPP in the nanocomposite. The XPS peak of Cu shows the presence of Cu in the nanocomposite though it was not observed in the TEM images and XRD. In Fig. 4B (a), the peaks corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 are observed at 932.3 and 952.1 eV, respectively. In addition, a weak peak observed at 934.4 eV belongs to Cu2+, which could come from partial oxidation of Cu. Furthermore, in the XPS of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite (Fig. 4B(b)), the peaks of Cu 2p3/2 (932.6 eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (952.4 eV) are shifted to higher binding energy, and the two satellite peaks attributed to Cu2+ are broadened, and the peaks corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 shift to 934.6 eV and 954.5 eV, respectively. It indicates a strong interaction between TCPP and Cu. The increased satellite peaks may be due to the further oxidation of Cu by the carboxyl groups at TCPP. In the high resolution XPS of C1s in the g-C3N4-Cu (Fig. 4C), three peaks at 284.6 eV, 286.1 eV and 288.1 eV are observed, which are attributed to the CC bond, the CNC bond and the NC N bond, respectively [23]. After introducing TCPP, only the peak attributed to CNC bond is shifted to a higher binding energy (shifted to 286.5 eV). In addition, four peaks exhibited at 398.6, 399.9, 401.2 and 404.4 eV are assigned to sp2-hybridized nitrogen (CNC), sp3-hybridized nitrogen tertiary nitrogen (N-(C)3) or H-N-(C)2, amino functional groups with one hydrogen atom (CNH), and π excitation (Fig. 4D), respectively [24]. Similarly, only the binding energy attributed to (N-(C)3)/H-N-(C)2 and π excitation is enhanced in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite. Moreover, in Fig. 4E, the peak of O1s in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP shifts towards lower binding energy, which may be the increase of electron density of O1s caused by the strong interaction and electron transfer between TCPP and g-C3N4-Cu [25]. It will be very profitable to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP. As shown in Fig. 5 , specific surface area and porous distribution of the samples are measured. Fig. 5A shows that the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the two samples are both type III, and the H3 hysteretic curve is steep, indicating that it is with mesopore structure caused by lamellar accumulation. The specific surface area of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite is 88.57 m2/g, while that of the g-C3N4-TCPP is 69.47 m2/g. In addition, it is found that the pore size distribution of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite is broad (2−50 nm), which indicates that the nanocomposite is with cross-linked porous structure (Fig. 5B). It could be due to the tensile effect caused by the strong interaction between TCPP and g-C3N4-Cu. Evidently, the Cu implanted in the g-C3N4 plays a key role in fabricating the cross-linked structure. The g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite with porous structure and increased surface will especially be attractive as heterogeneous photocatalysts for water reduction [26]. Generally, the change of the functional groups in materials can be characterized by FTIR spectra. However, in the target product (g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP), the total content of the TCPP is low (only 4 wt.%). In addition, many vibrations of the porphyrin coincide with those of the g-C3N4. Therefore, the FTIR spectra of g-C3N4-TCPP and g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP are both similar to that of the g-C3N4, and characteristic vibrations corresponding to porphyrins are not clearly distinguished by FTIR (not shown here) due to the lower sensitivity of FTIR and lower content of the porphyrins. UV-vis spectroscopy is one of the important means to investigate the interfacial interaction, surface composition and coordination geometry. Fig. 6 shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of samples. As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), pure g-C3N4 exhibits a fundamental absorption edge at 450 nm, corresponding to the band gap of 2.7 eV (calculated by Eg = 1240/λ, [27]). As shown in Fig. 6(b), the absorption spectrum of the g-C3N4-Cu shows a slightly increased absorption, indicating that the introduction of Cu plays a positive role in increasing the absorption of the g-C3N4. In the UV–vis spectrum of pure TCPP, the bands at 350 nm and 466 nm (Fig. 6(e)) assigned to Soret band of TCPP are due to H-aggregate and J-aggregate of TCPP [28], respectively, which indicates that TCPP molecules are in the form of aggregates. In the spectrum of g-C3N4-TCPP (Fig. 6(c)), it can be observed that the Soret band of TCPP is about 430 nm, and four Q bands are located at 524 nm, 560 nm, 598 nm and 656 nm, respectively. Compared with that of the TCPP, the change in the Soret band indicates that the aggregate of TCPP is suppressed due to the π-π interaction between g-C3N4 and TCPP. Differently, after introducing Cu in the interface of g-C3N4 and TCPP, the number of Q bands is reduced to three, the Soret band is split, and two bands at 410 nm and 430 nm are observed. According to the band at 410 nm, it is deduced that the coordination between some TCPP and metals could take place in the presence of g-C3N4-Cu [29]. In addition, the band at 430 nm indicates π-π interaction between TCPP and g-C3N4 (Fig. 6(d)). Differently, directly adding CuTCPP into C3N4, the spectrum (Fig. 6f) of the obtained composite (with a similar composition as that of the C3N4-Cu-TCPP but no copper-bridged) is different from that of the C3N4-Cu-TCPP, which is an evidence for the coordination interaction based on the TCPP and the Cu implanted into the C3N4. Combined with the results of high resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 4), and UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra (Fig. 6), it is concluded that it is mainly the coordination of the carboxyl groups of the TCPP with the Cu in the g-C3N4-Cu, and only a small amount of TCPP macrocycle coordinates with the Cu in the g-C3N4-Cu. Based on the results in Figs. 1–6, the formation process and structure of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite are suggested and shown in Scheme 1 . Obviously, the implanted Cu can efficiently improve the interaction between g-C3N4 and TCPP, which is very helpful for improving the photocatalytic activity. In order to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite, the photocatalytic H2 production using 10 vol. % TEOA as a scavenge agent was evaluated. According to UV–vis spectral characteristics of the samples: the stronger absorbance of the prepared g-C3N4 is mainly in the range of 250 nm–400 nm (Fig. 6(a)); for solid TCPP, there also exists UV absorbance due to the aggregation among TCPP molecules (Fig. 6(e)). Therefore, in the photocatalytic measurement, Xe lamp was used as light source in order to excite g-C3N4 and TCPP and obtain a higher photocatalytic activity. The as-prepared samples achieved steady H2 production without any cocatalysts (Fig. 7 ). It indicates that the g-C3N4 can function as a stable “metal-free” photocatalyst for visible-light-driven H2 production. Furthermore, it can be seen that the activity of the g-C3N4-Cu (Fig. 7c) is higher than that of the g-C3N4 (Fig. 7a), which may be the enhanced absorption and electron transfer in the g-C3N4 after being implanted Cu. As shown in Fig. 7b, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production over the g-C3N4-TCPP is not increased any more after 3 h. Differently, as shown in Fig. 7, H2 release rate of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP is 10.3 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4, and 9.6 times higher than that of g-C3N4-TCPP. Especially, the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite (Fig. 7e), exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity (6 times higher) as compared to that of the g-C3N4-CuTCPP (a composite prepared by directly adding CuTCPP into C3N4, with a similar composition as that of the C3N4-Cu-TCPP but no copper-bridged). It could mainly be attributed to the strong interaction and efficient electron transfer with the Cu as the special linker of g-C3N4 and TCPP. It is known that the interaction among constituents in the catalyst has an important influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP, the implanted Cu in the g-C3N4 can efficiently improve the interaction between g-C3N4 and TCPP by coordinating with TCPP (Figs. 4, 6), and leads to a different microstructure (Figs. 3, 5), which is very helpful for improving the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and electron transfer. However, this kind of interaction is not existed in the g-C3N4-CuTCPP (there only exists π-π interaction between g-C3N4 and TCPP). Therefore, it shows a lower photocatalytic activity (Fig. 7d). While the Cu-bridged g-C3N4/TCPP displays dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity. The reasons are further explored by the Figs. 8 and 9 followed. By compared with UV–vis diffuse reflection spectra of g-C3N4-TCPP and g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP before and after photocatalytic hydrogen production (Fig. 8), it can be seen that (Fig. 8A), with the g-C3N4-TCPP as the photocatalyst, characteristic bands corresponding to TCPP disappear after irradiated for 6 h. Subsequently, its activity for hydrogen production is not increased any more followed with irradiation time (Fig. 7b). It could be due to the photolysis of TCPP coming from the weak π-π interaction between g-C3N4 and TCPP. Differently, as shown in Fig. 8B, the characteristic bands of TCPP can still be observed in the spectrum of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP after hydrogen production. However, the number of Q bands is reduced, and the absorbance is decreased. Combined with the results in Fig. 8A, it is deduced that there exist two forms of TCPP in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP (shown in Scheme 1): one is the TCPP linked with g-C3N4 by π-π interaction, which is easy to be photolyzed, unstable, and with lower activity. The other is the TCPP coordinated with the Cu, which can improve the stability of the porphyrin, light absorption of the composite as well as the interaction between g-C3N4 and TCPP. These are essential for increasing electron transfer and photocatalytic activity of the materials. In order to explore the reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic activity in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite, it is important to investigate the separation of photoinduced carriers and the interfacial resistance in the composite. Fluorescence spectral analysis was used to study the transfer and recombination processes of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the photocatalysts. Fig. 9A shows the fluorescence spectra for various samples at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of the g-C3N4 exhibits a broad and intense emission peak at about 440 nm. Compared with the fluorescence spectrum of g-C3N4 (curve a), the fluorescence of g-C3N4-TCPP (curve b), g-C3N4-Cu (curve c) and g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP (curve d) are all significantly quenched. It strongly demonstrates that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes are inhibited by properly introducing TCPP or/and Cu in the g-C3N4, which was more conducive to the photoreduction of H+ to H2. In addition, the fluorescence peak for the g-C3N4-Cu is located at 440 nm, which is same as that of the g-C3N4. While the fluorescence peaks for g-C3N4-TCPP and g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP are located at 466 nm (with a higher intensity for the g-C3N4-TCPP, and no fluorescence for pure TCPP with λex =375 nm). The results indicate that no intermediate energy level is produced by implanting Cu in the g-C3N4. While there exists some intermediate energy level related with the TCPP in the g-C3N4-TCPP and the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP [30]. It could be the main reason for the different change trend of fluorescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. 9B) for g-C3N4-Cu and g-C3N4-TCPP. The emission intensity is the lowest for the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP in the four samples. It is further confirmed that both TCPP and Cu have strong interaction with g-C3N4. Especially, the Cu implanted in the g-C3N4 plays a key role in connecting g-C3N4 with TCPP, which is profitable for faster separation of photogenerated charges and enhancing photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4-TCPP. EIS is known to be an important means of characterizing charge transfer behavior. As shown in Fig. 9B, the arc radius of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP nanocomposite is the smallest compared to other samples, indicating that the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP possesses the lowest interfacial resistance, which is conducive to the transfer of photogenerated electrons and the improvement of hydrogen production. According to the literature reported [19], the photoinduced electrons from CuTCPP can be directly transferred to the conduction band (CB) of the g-C3N4 because the LUMO of the CuTCPP is lower than that of the g-C3N4. At the same time, the valence band (VB) of the g-C3N4 is lower than HOMO of CuTCPP, and the holes generated on the VB of the g-C3N4 can spontaneously migrate to the HOMO of the CuTCPP, which is a typical II-type heterojunction. However, the hydrogen production over the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite is 6 times higher than that of the g-C3N4-CuTCPP in the same conditions (Fig. 7), indicating that the mechanism of the electron transfer in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite is different from that of the g-C3N4-CuTCPP. In the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite, lower hole injection barriers are led to for the high work function of Cu at the metal-organic interface [31]. TCPP is a narrow band-gap semiconductor photosensitizer (2.32 eV) with a ground state oxidation potential value of +0.96 eV relative to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) [32], whereas the redox potentials of the CB and the VB of g-C3N4 are at -1.3 and +1.4 eV vs. NHE, respectively. The LUMO of TCPP is more negative than CB of g-C3N4. When g-C3N4 is coupled with TCPP, as shown in Scheme 2 , both g-C3N4 and TCPP can be excited under illumination. The electrons produced by TCPP will be transferred to react with H2O. Thus, a weak internal electric field was created in the interface of g-C3N4 and TCPP, which will facilitate the migration of the photogenerated electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 to the HOMO of TCPP with the help of Cu. The above discussion was further confirmed by XPS, one of the important methods to characterize the electron/hole migration mechanism through investigating the shift in binding energies, and a shift in the binding energy indicates a change of the electron density [33]. Compared with C1s HRXPS of the g-C3N4-Cu (Fig. 4C(a)) and that of the TCPP (Fig. 4C(c)), it is indicated that the binding energy at 286.1 eV (Fig. 4C (a)) is special for the g-C3N4, and the characteristic binding energy is shifted toward higher-energy region (shifted to 286.5 eV) after introducing TCPP (see C1s HRXPS of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP, Fig. 4C (b)). The C1s binding energies corresponding to TCPP cannot be clearly distinguished in the C1s HRXPS of the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP maybe due to the low content of the TCPP and the low sensitivity factor of the peak at 292.0 eV. The shift indicates that the electron density in the g-C3N4 decreases [33]. In addition, the binding energies at 536.9 eV and 535.3 eV corresponding to O1s of the TCPP (Fig. 4E (c)) are shifted toward lower-energy region (shifted to 532.8 eV and 531.5 eV, respectively) after being introduced into the g-C3N4-Cu, which demonstrated that the electron density of the TCPP in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP increases. Furthermore, in the HRXPS of Cu2p (Fig. 4B), the binding energies of Cu2p in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP are shifted toward higher-energy region compared with those in the g-C3N4-Cu. It is indicated that the electron density of the Cu in the composite decreases, which further confirms that the electrons produced by the TCPP are not transferred to the Cu. Moreover, in the g-C3N4-Cu, the original electrons (produced by the g-C3N4) accumulated in the Cu are transferred by the bridged Cu. Subsequently, the increased electron density in TCPP and the decreased electron density in C3N4 and Cu can be attributed to the migration of the electrons from the CB of the C3N4 to the HOMO of the TCPP by means of the Cu [34]. Based on the above results (the structure of the composite, comparative hydrogen evolution of C3N4-Cu-TCPP and C3N4-CuTCPP, the band structure, and HRXPS of the samples), this migration of the electrons in the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP system is attributed to the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism, which is similar to that reported by Yu et al. [34]. Namely, the photogenerated electrons on the LUMO of the TCPP are used to reduce H2O and produce H2, and the holes in the VB of the g-C3N4 are consumed by the sacrificial agent. The stability of the catalyst is a critical factor whether the catalyst can be practically used or not. Therefore, the cycle stability of hydrogen evolution over the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite was studied under the same conditions. The g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite was used in H2 production for five cycles, and the result is shown in Fig. 10 . It can be seen that in the second cycle, the amount of hydrogen production decreases. Combined with the results in Fig. 8, it can be inferred that those TCPP molecules linked with g-C3N4 by π-π interaction are photolysized. Though the activity over the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite is decreased in the second cycle to a certain extent, its activity is still 6.2 times higher than that of the g-C3N4-TCPP, and 3.8 times higher than that of the g-C3N4-CuTCPP. In the subsequent cycles, the photocatalytic hydrogen production over the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite is relatively stable, and no noticeable decrease of hydrogen generation was observed from the second recycle. It shows that the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP composite bridged with Cu is a highly active and relatively stable photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. Future work will focus on optimizing reaction conditions."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, a novel g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP photocatalyst for hydrogen production was prepared by using Cu as the interfacial linker. It was found that the introduction of Cu in the interface of g-C3N4 and TCPP had an important effect on the morphology and structure of the g-C3N4-TCPP nanocomposite. In addition, the interaction between TCPP and g-C3N4 was greatly strengthened because of the special Cu, which effectively promoted the electron transfer between g-C3N4 and TCPP. Moreover, it was shown that the g-C3N4-Cu-TCPP nanocomposite bridge-linked with Cu was a highly active and relatively stable photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. Its H2 release rate was 10.3 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4, 9.6 times higher than that of g-C3N4-TCPP, and 6 times higher than that of g-C3N4-CuTCPP. Therefore, the fabrication method based on the nanocomposite will be beneficial for producing new energies, using thermally and oxidation-stable organic semiconductor as functional materials that are cheap and commonly available."
