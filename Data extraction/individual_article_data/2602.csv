0,Introduction,"In recent years, the energy crisis has imposed the necessity to achieve a sustainable future built on alternative sources of energy and materials. Molecular hydrogen represents a storable form of energy [1]. Moreover, its combustion does not generate polluting products and it has high specific energy [2–4]. Hydrogen production can occur during the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. This process can be divided into two stages: dark fermentation (DF) and methanogenesis. The first stage involves the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), H2 and CO2, while the second one converts VFAs into CH4 and CO2 [5,6]. Simple operation conditions, low operating cost, low energy demand and fast reaction rate are some one-off advantages of dark fermentation [7]. Hydrogen generation using the DF process is possible with a wide range of waste materials such as sludge [8], food waste [9], cheese whey [10], algal biomass [11] and vinasse (V) [12]. Recently, numerous studies have found that co-digestion of two or more substrates can increase the load of biodegradable organic matter, improve the balance of nutrients, improve microbial diversity leading to enhance hydrogen production [13,14]. Although there are numerous studies on hydrogen production by co-digestion of sludge with different substrates such as perennial ryegrass [2], food waste [15] and glycerol [16], no prior studies have been published on the production of hydrogen via sludge-vinasse co-digestion. In Spain, around 1.2 million tons of sludge are generated every year in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Waste activated sludge (WAS) is the main by-product of these plants. WAS is an extremely complex and heterogeneous solid waste, composed mainly of biomass from cell growth and decay during activated sludge treatment process in the WWTPs [17]. On the other hand, vinasse is an effluent generated during the production of alcohol in the wine distillation process. This effluent can be highly damaging in the areas in which it is discarded due to its high organic load, low pH and high corrosivity. Instead of harmful, vinasse may be considered as a substrate for hydrogen generation through the dark fermentation process because of the surplus organic load. Biochemical hydrogen potential (BHP) corresponds to the maximum hydrogen production at dark fermentation infinite time and is a key parameter to evaluate the suitability of substrates to obtain biohydrogen. Batch methods have recently been applied to evaluate the BHP of numerous substrates, although the operating conditions (such as pH, temperature) have yet to be standardized. Moreover, there is no consensus regarding the nature of the inoculum to use in these tests or the type of pre-treatment they should receive (Table 1 ). One of the most widely used types of inoculum is the anaerobic sludge, though from different sources such as municipal sewage [18,19], wastewater [2], poultry slaughterhouse wastewater [20,21] and citrate-producing wastewater have also been used. Most research studies use inocula subjected to thermal pre-treatment in order to enrich the inoculum in terms of the hydrogen-producing bacteria. The pre-treatment is generally carried out at a temperature of 100 °C [2,18,19,22,23], although it has been carried out at 90 °C in other cases [20,21,24] or even at a temperature above 100 °C [25,26]. The exposure times of the inoculum to thermal shock vary greatly, ranging from 15 to 30 min in most cases [2,18,19]. However, in the studies by Giordano et al. [26] and Mohan et al. [23], the exposure time was longer (2–4 h). Other authors use a hydrogen-producing inoculum [3,12,27]. The results of these studies are inconclusive; hence the lack of consensus regarding the type of inoculum or the thermal pre-treatment conditions to be employed in BHP tests. In this study, BHP tests with different natural inocula and pre-treatment conditions were carried out to study their influence on BHP results. The main purpose of this research is to discern which type of inoculum to use for future BHP tests."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates,"2.1 Substrates Waste activated sludge and vinasse were used as substrates. The WAS was collected from Guadalete municipal wastewater treatment plant, Jerez de la Frontera, Cadiz, Spain. The V was provided by the González Byass winery located in Jerez de la Frontera, Cadiz, Spain, and kept frozen (−20 °C) until use. A mixture of both substrates in a 50:50 ratio was used as the feedstock in all the BHP tests."
3,Inocula,"2.2 Inocula Three types of inocula were used: Acidogenic Inoculum (AI), Sludge Inoculum (SI) and Thermal Sludge Inoculum (TSI). The AI was collected from a laboratory scale semi-continuous acidogenic thermophilic anaerobic digester treating waste activated sludge-vinasse (50:50) for hydrogen production. The reactor operated at pH 5.5, a temperature of 55 °C and a HRT of 4 days. The AI was thus already conditioned to treat the mixture of WAS-vinasse co-substrates and is, therefore, a hydrogen -producing inoculum. The SI and TSI were collected from a laboratory scale semi-continuous thermophilic anaerobic digester treating waste activated sludge operating at pH 7.0, a temperature of 55 °C and a HRT of 20 days. The TSI was heat-treated in a hot oven at 100 °C for 15 min. Three BHP tests were carried out, Tests 1, 2 and 3, with the aforementioned inocula, AI, SI and TSI, respectively. The physic-chemical characteristics of the inocula and substrates are summarized in Table 2 ."
4,Biochemical hydrogen potential,"2.3 Biochemical hydrogen potential Hydrogen fermentation was performed in 250 mL glass bottles with a 120 mL working volume and a 130 mL headspace volume. For each reactor, a mixing ratio of inoculum to feedstock of 1:1 (v/v) was used [2,3]. The initial pH of each bottle was set at 5.5, a value at which methanogenic Archaea are inhibited [18]. Nitrogen was fluxed for 5 min to displace any air present in the bottles and hence ensure an anaerobic environment. All the bottles were maintained at constant temperature under thermophilic conditions (55 °C) in an orbital shaker incubator. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate and inoculum control bottles were also prepared. Three bottles were used as control for each inoculum without any substrate. The hydrogen production from the control was subtracted from the hydrogen production obtained in the substrate assays prior to data analysis."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Both the volume and composition of the biogas were determined daily. The produced biogas was determined indirectly, by measuring the pressure inside the bottles via pressure transducers. The measured pressure is converted to volume of biogas according to the ideal gas law [28]. Gas volumes were converted to standard conditions and corrected by subtracting the production of the blank. The composition of the biogas was determined by gas chromatography separation (Shimadzu GC-2010 system). H2, CO2, CH4 and O2 were analysed by means of a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a Supelco Carboxen 1010 Plot column [29]. Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) were analysed according to the Standard Methods [30] at the beginning and end of each experiment. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) were determined by gas chromatography on a Shimadzu GC-2010 system equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column filled with Nukol [31]. The pH was measured at the beginning and end of the tests using a Crison 20 Basic pH meter [30]."
6,Microbial analyses,"2.5 Microbial analyses Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to count the microorganisms contained in the reactors. The main steps of FISH of whole cells using 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes are cell fixation followed by permeabilization and hybridization with the desired probe(s). Samples from batch reactors were collected in sterile universal bottles at the beginning and end of the BHP test. A 1:1 (v/v) ratio of absolute ethanol was added to the bottles. The samples were stored at −20 °C until they were fixed. Further details of this procedure are given in Montero et al. [32]. The technique used for fixing and permeabilizing cells was based on the method described by Amann et al. [33,34]. The 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes used in this study are shown in Table 3 : bacterial-universal probe EUB338 [33,34], and Archaea-universal probe ARC915 [35]. The cellular concentration and percentages of Eubacteria and Archaea were obtained by FISH. The total population was estimated as the sum of the populations of Eubacteria and Archaea for the reason that most anaerobic microorganisms in anaerobic reactors belong to these two groups [36]. Samples were examined visually and the cells were counted under an Axio Imager Upright epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 100 W mercury lamp and a 100 × oil objective lens. The filter employed depended on the identity of the labelled probe: a B-2A filter (DM 510, Excitation 450–490 and Barrer 520) was used for 6-FAM; while a G-2A filter (DM 580, Excitation 510–560 and Barrer 590) was used for Cy3. In addition, microbial activity was evaluated from biochemical activity according to the methods reported by Montero et al. [32] and Zahedi et al. [37]. The activity was calculated as the ratio of H2 generated and the number of microorganisms inside the reactor obtained by FISH staining."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physico-chemical analysis,"3.1 Physico-chemical analysis The physical-chemical characteristics of three tests at the beginning and end of the tests are summarized in Table 4 . The pH remained relatively stable during experimentation, varying from 5 to 5.5. There were no abrupt variations in pH, demonstrating that the systems were capable of self-regulating in order to favour microbial activity [36]. VS and TS removal rates ranged between 1.7 and 17.3%. The lowest rate was achieved with the acidogenic inoculum (Test 1). As for SCOD removal, this was lower than 23% in all tests. Yang and Wang [2] also found that the SCOD concentration decreased, with significant reductions in removal rates of 7.1–31.3%. These authors state that their results indicated that the hydrolysis amount of particular organics by hydrolytic bacteria was lower than the utilization amount of soluble organics by hydrogen producers. In terms of TCOD, the removal rate was greater, with percentages ranging between 50 and 60%. These results are in line with those obtained by Torquato et al. [22], in which the maximum removal rate of 41% was obtained in the digestion of vinasse to produce hydrogen. However, Silva et al. [18,19] reported that COD removal was lower than 20% when testing the co-digestion of food waste, sewage sludge and crude glycerol. As regards intermediate compounds, a large amount of VFAs was produced during the tests. At the end of the BHP tests, the dominant species were acetic, butyric and propionic acids, the concentrations for each inoculum being shown in Fig. 1 . Generally, hydrogen production via dark fermentation produces acetic and butyric acids as by-products [38]. Butyric acid was predominant in Test 2 (using SI), which presents a higher hydrogen yield. Luo et al. [39]and Chen et al. [40] also found that the highest hydrogen production was obtained when butyric acid predominated. Butyric acid-type fermentation is considered one of the most effective pathways for hydrogen production [18]. On the other hand, TSI showed the highest production of propionic acid, which is detrimental for hydrogen production [20]. Tyagi et al. [3] found that hydrogen yield decreases with increasing propionic acid concentration."
9,Biogas production,"3.2 Biogas production Fig. 2 shows the cumulative hydrogen production for sludge-vinasse co-digestion with different inocula. In all the BHP tests, hydrogen production commenced in the first hours, as the lag phase was short. Furthermore, the biogas generated in all three tests was composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, no methanogenic activity being observed (i.e. the biogas was methane free). All this is due to the fact that the pH values fell within the 5–6 range, which is optimal to enhance H2 generation and avoid methanogenesis [19]. The sludge inoculum led to the highest maximum accumulated H2 volume (391 mL H2) compared to the acidogenic inoculum (298 mL H2) and the thermally pre-treated inoculum (TSI) (243 mL H2). In terms of H2 yield (as per millilitres of hydrogen per gram of volatile solids of the substrate initially added to each reactor), the highest value was also achieved at the test using the SI (177 mL H2/g VSadded), corresponding to an increase of 21 and 36% in relation to that obtained in the Test 1 (146 mL H2/g VSadded) and the Test 3 (130 mL H2/g VSadded) (Fig. 3 ). According to these results, hydrogen production is inhibited rather than enhanced when the inoculum is submitted to a thermal pre-treatment with the purpose of inactivating H2-consuming Archaea and avoiding methane generation, as proposed by several authors [2,18–24,26]. These results are concordant and discrepant at the same time with those collected in the literature. Thus, Luo et al. [39] also observed this tendency, the best condition was without any inoculum treatment. However, Albanez et al. [41] observed a slight improvement was noticed when performing the inoculum heat shock pretreatment in the co-digestion of vinasse and molasses. In a recent study, Lovato et al. [20] subjected the inoculum used in the co-digestion of cheese whey and glycerin to a heat shock pre-treatment (90 °C for 10 min), obtaining significantly higher values for hydrogen productivities and yields than using untreated inoculum. In other studies using the same inoculum though treating glycerin-based wastewater, the thermally pre-treated inoculum was not found to be significantly different from the untreated sludge in terms of molar productivity and molar hydrogen yield [24]. It is important to emphasize that the last three studies were done in AnSBBR at mesophilic conditions."
10,Hydrogen production rate,"3.3 Hydrogen production rate In order to ease identification of differences between the inocula, the hydrogen production rate of the first ten days is shown in Fig. 4 . As for the SI and STI inocula behaved similarly with a significant lead of SI inoculum. This could be expected because both inocula have the same source. As for AI inoculum, a broader and lower peak than in the other inocula was detected. The maximum hydrogen production rate observed in the tests 1 and 2, with the AI and STI inocula, reached the peak after three days, and amounted to 11 mL H2/(gVSadded d) and 20 mL H2/(gVSadded d), respectively. On the other hand, the maximum hydrogen production rate observed in the Test 2 with the sludge inoculum reached the peak at about the second day of experimentation, amounting to 28 mL H2/(gVSadded d). As could be expected, the highest maximum hydrogen production rate was noticed in the experiment with higher hydrogen yield. Lavagnolo et al. [42] claim that generally, faster production rates are associated with higher production yields even though their results disagree with this assertion. Although there are studies that analyse the hydrogen production rate [18,19], no data was found in the literature concerning the effect of inoculum on hydrogen production rate."
11,Statistical analysis,"3.4 Statistical analysis Fig. 5 shows the average of hydrogen yield produce to each inoculum with their standard deviation. In order to evaluate differences between results of the three inocula, hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate results were analysed statistically by single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Table 5 shows the results of this analysis. A confidence level of 95% was selected for all comparisons. In the matter of hydrogen yield, for the comparison between inocula, the p value is smaller than 0.05 in all cases, therefore there is significant difference between the yields of hydrogen produced in SI inoculum and those of the other two. Conversely, for the hydrogen production rate there is no significant difference (p > 0.05) between all of the three tested inocula."
12,Microbial population dynamics,"3.5 Microbial population dynamics The concentrations of microorganisms in the samples before and after the different tests were studied. The amounts and relative percentages of the main microbial groups are shown in Table 4. In Test 2, in which the highest hydrogen yield (177 mL H2/g VSadded) was obtained, the population size increased during the time of experimentation. Instead, in Test 1 and Test 3, the population size remained stable at the end of the BHP tests in all cases; significantly, the amount of substrate for acidogenic phase was sufficient. Eubacteria was the major phylogenetic domain in all cases. It is possible that AI (Test 1), which was already producing hydrogen, during the experiment the microbial population is steady and there is no increase. On the other hand, SI (Test 2), which was previously producing methane, by inhibiting methanogenic Archaea, the bacteria that undergo a better adaptation to the new conditions are Eubacteria and microbial growth is favoured. In the case of TSI (Test 3), the thermal pretreatment may have removed part of the microorganisms present in the SI (Test 2) No significant variation was found in Eubacteria: Archaea ratios at the beginning and end of the experiments in Test 1 or Test 3: 41–46% and 59–54%, respectively. In Test 2, however, the percentages of Eubacteria increased from 59% to 92%. Thus, BHP test with sludge inoculum could increase the abundance of the specific bacteria in the reactor, which were beneficial for the hydrogen production. Although methane is not generated, the analyses showed the largest number of Archaea present. In terms of productivity, it may be stated that Archaea were inactive [28]."
13,Conclusions,"H2 generation from sludge vinasse co-digestion, using different inocula, was studied. The batch tests were successfully in all cases. Significant differences have been found in the production of hydrogen among the three inoculums. The highest hydrogen yield, 177 mL H2/g VSadded, was obtained with a sludge inoculum. This means that, in terms of hydrogen yield, a sludge inoculum is to be preferred in the BHP tests. Even though, Eubacteria was the major phylogenetic domain in all cases, sludge inoculum showed a greater growth of Eubacteria during the test, increasing the percentage of this population from 59.2 to 92.1. The rate of hydrogen production was comparable between the different inocula, that is, the duration of the test is independent of the type of inoculum used. Furthermore, hydrogen production was chiefly accompanied by the production of acetic and butyric acids."
