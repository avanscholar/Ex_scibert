0,Introduction,"C1 gas fermentation using gas-fermenting microorganisms has led to a novel route for resource utilization of carbon through the bioconversion of C1 gas into chemicals and biofuels, which is considered a green and sustainable process. Compared to thermochemical processes, its advantages include a higher tolerance for impurities in compositional gas substrates, a higher selectivity for products, more moderate operating conditions (including lower temperature and lower pressure) and a wider range of substrate sources (Daniell et al., 2012; Latif et al., 2014). Besides that, it eases the debate between biofuels production and food market owing to food-based feedstocks used in traditional biofuels production (Devarapalli and Atiyeh, 2015). A diverse range of C1 gases, including CO2 and CO, is derived from gas emissions of industries, e.g., steel manufacturing, oil refining and chemical production, and syngas generated from the gasification of carbonaceous materials such as agricultural residue and municipal solid waste (Devarapalli and Atiyeh, 2015; Liew et al., 2013). Gas-fermenting clostridia are employed for C1 gas fermentation in either or both of two patterns to utilize C1 gas: with CO2 as the sole carbon source and H2 as the energy source; or/and with CO as the sole carbon and energy source. These organisms have a variety of synthesis capabilities based on the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, producing diverse chemicals such as ethanol, butanol, 2,3-butanediol, acetate, butyrate and hexanol (Liew et al., 2013). Therefore, gas-fermenting clostridia have attracted much attention as host microorganisms to build a CO/CO2 biotransformation platform into valuable chemicals. As one of the minor autotrophic microbes that has synthetic abilities for medium-chain alcohols, C. carboxidivorans P7 also produces butanol and hexanol in addition to ethanol and acetate by the predominantly gas-fermenting clostridia (Liew et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2015). Consequently, an increasing number of studies have recently raised concerns about C. carboxidivorans P7 for its industrial potential. Nevertheless, one of the biggest challenges in the use of C. carboxidivorans P7 has been a lack of tools and technologies for genetic engineering. Most studies have focused on fermentation optimization. Several modification strategies have been explored to improve production in C. carboxidivorans P7, e.g., restriction of the carbon source (Phillips et al., 2015), changing temperature (Ramió-Pujol et al., 2015), pH regulation during the fermentation process (Fernández-Naveira et al., 2016) and enhancement of gas-liquid mass transfer (Shen et al., 2014a,b). The highest alcohol production (4.32g/L) by C. carboxidivorans P7 in bottle fermentation has been reported by Phillips et al. (2015) and involved both eliminating medium components and limiting uptake of CO with a fermentation time of 600h. However, the titre and productivities by C. carboxidivorans P7 are still far below commodity scale production and more studies have been expected to make breakthroughs for industrial feasibility. Medium development for gas-fermenting clostridia such as C. autoethanogenum and C. ragsdalei has been reported with significant results. Plackett-Burman and central composite designs were applied by Guo et al. (2010) to optimize the mineral elements, yeast extract and pH of the medium, resulting in a 4-fold increase in ethanol titre by C. autoethanogenum; Saxena and Tanner (2011) examined the effect of high and low levels of trace metals, finding significant differences in the activities of related enzymes and the growth and production of ethanol by C. ragsdalei. This study employed a Plackett-Burman design, path of steepest ascent, and Box-Behnken design to systematically optimize trace metals in the medium. We found that molybdenum/iron/copper had the most significant effects on solventogenesis in C. carboxidivorans P7. Based on the optimized medium, a variable-temperature cultivation was adopted to override bacterial flocculation and further improve alcohol production. A final alcohol titre of 6.97g/L was harvested; this level is a new peak for reported bottle fermentation. The results of this study provide a useful reference for the modification of fermentation profiles by gas-fermenting clostridia."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Strain, medium and growth condition","2.1 Strain, medium and growth condition C. carboxidivorans P7 (DSM-15243T) obtained from the DSMZ culture collection (www.dsmz.de) is a strict anaerobe previously isolated from an agricultural settling lagoon by Rossukon Laopaiboon (Liou et al., 2005) and was used in all experiments. Strain P7 stored in 10% glycerol was revived in Wilkins Chalgren anaerobe broth (Buck and Kelly, 1982) and incubated until the OD600 reached 0.8–1.0 under static culture conditions at 37°C. This strain culture was prepared to be the first-order seed. Wilkins Chalgren anaerobe broth contained the following (per litre): tryptone, 10g; peptone, 10g; yeast extract, 5g; glucose, 2g; NaCl, 5g; L-arginine, 1g; sodium pyruvate, 1g; hemin, 5mg; vitamin K1, 0.5mg; NaHCO3, 1mg; l-cysteine, 0.3g; and 0.1% resazurin, 0.5ml. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0 using 10N NaOH. Oxygen was removed in an anaerobic workstation (Whitley A35, Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, United Kingdom), and removal continued for 24h before inoculation."
3,Bottle fermentation experiment,"2.2 Bottle fermentation experiment Basic medium modified from standard ATCC medium 1754 was prepared for the second-order seed (Datar et al., 2004). For the second-order seed, 5% first-order seed culture at 0.8–1.0 OD600 was inoculated into a 125-ml serum bottle (Sigma Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 30ml basic medium. The bottle was sealed with a rubber septum, capped with an aluminium crimp cap and cultivated with shaking at 100rpm and 37°C until the OD600 reached 1.0. The carbon source to maintain live bacteria was derived from artificial steel mill off-gas (CO:CO2:H2:N2 =56:20:9:15) at 0.2MPa in bottle headspace. The basic media with varying trace metals were used in bottle fermentation experiments. The operational approach of the bottle fermentation experiments was similar to the preparation of the second-order seed, but the bottle fermentation experiments lasted for 72h (37°C) or 144h (37°C [0–24h]–25°C [24–144h]), and the artificial steel mill off-gas in the bottle headspace was replaced every 24h. All of the bottle fermentation experiments were carried out in triplicate and replicated in a timely manner. Basic medium contained the following (per litre): yeast extract, 0.5g; 2-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (2-MES), 5g; mineral stock solution, 10ml; vitamin stock solution, 1ml; trace metal stock solution, 2ml; and 0.1% resazurin, 0.5ml. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0 using 10N NaOH. Then, reducing agent was added to the medium, 5ml per litre, to remove oxygen in the anaerobic workstation after autoclaving (121°C, 20min) and cooling. The mineral stock solution contained the following (per litre): NaCl, 80g; NH4Cl, 100g; KCl, 10g; KH2PO4, 10g; MgSO4, 20g; and CaCl2, 4g. The vitamin stock solution contained the following (per litre): pyridoxine, 100mg; thiamine, 50mg; riboflavin, 50mg; calcium pantothenate, 50mg; thioctic acid, 50mg; paraamino benzoic acid, 50mg; nicotinic acid, 50mg; vitamin B12, 50mg; D-biotin, 20mg; and folic acid, 20mg. The trace metal stock solution contained the following (per litre): nitrilotriacetic acid, 10g; MnSO4·H2O, 5g; (NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O, 4g; CoCl2·6H2O, 1g; ZnSO4·7H2O, 1g; CuCl2·2H2O, 0.1g; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.1g; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.1g; Na2SeO4·10H2O, 0.1g; and Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.1g. The reducing agent contained the following (per 100ml): NaOH, 0.9g; l-Cysteine·HCl, 4g; and Na2S·9H2O, 4g. It was filtered with a 0.22-μm filter before use."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods 2.3.1 Growth measurement A daily sample of 1.5ml withdrawn from the culture bottle was monitored using optical density at 600nm with a UV spectrophotometer (DU 730, Beckman Coulter, IN, USA). 2.3.2 Measurement of fermentation products An internal standard method with isobutanol and isobutyric acid was used to measure concentrations of fermentation products, organic acids and alcohols using a gas chromatograph (7890 A, Agilent, Wilmington, DE, USA) equipped with a capillary column (Alltech EC-WAX 30m×0.32mm, Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, Illinois, USA) and a flame ionization detector. The oven temperature was programmed from 85°C to 150°C, and the injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 250°C and 300°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 20ml/min with hydrogen at 30ml/min and air at 400ml/min. In this study, “alcohols” refers to the total of ethanol, butanol and hexanol; “organic acids” refers to the total of acetate, butyrate and caproate; and “total products” refers to the sum of the former and the latter."
5,Design of experiments and statistical analysis,"2.4 Design of experiments and statistical analysis 2.4.1 Three-step statistical strategy 2.4.1.1 Plackett-Burman design This study used a Plackett-Burman design (PBD) to screen factors that could significantly influence alcohol titre from nine trace metallic components, including eight derived from basic medium—(NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, ZnSO4·7H2O, CuCl2·2H2O, NiCl2·6H2O, Na2MoO4·2H2O, Na2SeO4·10H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O—and an additional metal salt (FeCl3·6H2O). Each variable was tested at two levels—high (+1) and low (−1)—which were initially estimated in our preliminary experiments. The two levels of nine variables selected in this study are listed by their coded values and fold values in Table 1 . Overall, eleven independent variables (nine of the above-mentioned variables and two dummy variables) were screened in twelve trial runs organized according to the PBD with N=11. More details of the PBD matrix are shown in Table 2 . 2.4.1.2 Path of steepest ascent design The path of steepest ascent design was used to approach the optimum. The three most significant factors obtained from the results of PBD experiments were further optimized sequentially along the path of steepest ascent to determine their centre points, which were used in the response surface methodology. 2.4.1.3 Box-Behnken design In this study, a Box-Behnken design (BBD) was employed in the response surface methodology to evaluate the effects of three independent variables on alcohol titre. With the other factors fixed at significant levels according to the result of PBD experiments, these three significant variables were studied at three coded levels: high (+1), intermediate (0) and low levels (−1). To determine the optimum values of the selected three variables, 15 trial runs including three replicates at the centre point according to BBD were performed. The experimental matrix with experimental and predicted responses (alcohol production) is presented in Table 3 . The following second-order polynomial model fit the relationship between the response values and variables tested. The equation obtained using statistical methodology was as follows: (1) Y = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 3 β i X i + ∑ i = 1 3 β ii X i 2 + ∑ i = 1 2 ∑ j = i + 1 3 β ij X i X j where Y is the predicted response and β0 , βi , βii , and βij are the intercept term, linear coefficient, quadratic coefficient and interaction coefficient, respectively. Xi and Xj are the independent variables. 2.4.1.4 Validation of the fitting model The fermentation experiments were conducted using the optimum solution of the aforementioned second-order polynomial equation to validate the fitting model. The optimized medium, with basic medium as control, was performed to evaluate the availability of a three-step statistical strategy for alcohol titre by optimization of trace metals. 2.4.1.5 Method matrix and ANOVA The trial matrices for method design, including PBD and BBD, were organized, and the entire regression analysis of the experimental data was performed using Design Expert 8.0.6 (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, USA). The statistical significance of variables was evaluated by applying the analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Student’s t test. The adequacy of the model was verified using Fisher’s F-test. 2.4.2 Variable-temperature cultivation To further increase alcohol production, the bacteria were first incubated at 37°C for 24h and then transferred to 25°C for 120h to increase both the absolute value of alcohol titre and the ratio of medium-chain alcohols to products based on the optimized composition of trace metals."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Optimization of trace metals,"3.1 Optimization of trace metals 3.1.1 Screening of significant factors for alcohol titre by PBD The experimental responses of 12 trial runs are shown in the right column of Table 2. The ANOVA results calculated from experimental data are shown in Table 4 . The factor was considered significant when the P value was <0.05. The P value and F value of the regression model were <0.0126 and 78.64, respectively, which indicated that the model fit well for the entire regressing region. The multiple correlation coefficient R2 =0.9845, which determined the appropriateness of PBD, implied that 98.45% of the variability in the response could be explained by this model. Of the 12 variables tested, the six components ((NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, CuCl2·2H2O, NiCl2·6H2O, Na2MoO4·2H2O, FeCl3·6H2O) were significant, according to the alcohol production response. A positive or negative coefficient in one factor in the regression model indicated a positive or negative effect of this factor on the response. Therefore, CoCl2·6H2O, CuCl2·2H2O, NiCl2·6H2O and FeCl3·6H2O had a significant positive influence, and (NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O and Na2MoO4·2H2O had the opposite effect. On the basis of the magnitude of the significance, three trace minerals—Na2MoO4·2H2O, FeCl3·6H2O and CuCl2·2H2O—were selected as further optimized objects. 3.1.2 Path of steepest ascent experiment In accordance with the results of the PBD experiments, Fe3+ (FeCl3·6H2O) and Cu2+ (CuCl2·2H2O) positively affected alcohol titre, whereas MoO4 2+ (Na2MoO4·2H2O) had a negative effect. Thus, Fe3+ and Cu2+ moved along path of increasing concentration, whereas MoO4 2+ moved along path of decreasing concentration with other factors were found at corresponding levels attributable to their effects in PBD experiments, which included (NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O (0.5×), CoCl2·6H2O (5×), ZnSO4·7H2O (0.5×), NiCl2·6H2O (5×), Na2SeO4·10H2O (5×) and Na2WO4·2H2O (5×). Alcohol production reached the highest level when the fold values of MoO4 2+, Fe3+ and Cu2+ were 0.6, 6.0 and 3.5, respectively; these values were set as the centre points in the subsequent BBD experiments. 3.1.3 Response surface methodology experiment (Box-Behnken design) Based on the results of the PBD experiments and the path of steepest ascent experiments, BBD experiments were applied to evaluate the interaction among the significant factors and to determine the optimal levels of the three significant factors. The fold values of each factor at various levels (−1.0.1) were as follows: MoO4 2+, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6; Fe3+, 4, 6, and 8; and Cu2+, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5. The matrix of BBD and experimental and predicted responses is shown in Table 3. The variance analysis of the regression model (shown in Table 5 ) showed that the quadratic model was significant (F=9.03, P=0.0130<0.05); the analytical coefficient was R2 =0.9421, indicating that the correlation between measured and predicted values was good; and Adj R2 =0.8378 implied that 83.78% of the variance could be interpreted by the model. According to the term significance in the model (shown in Table 6 ), the linear effect of factors A, B and C and the interaction effect of AB, AC and BC on alcohol production were not significant, whereas the curved surface effect of factors A, B and C was significant. The interaction effects and optimal levels of variables were determined by plotting the response surface curves, represented in Fig. 1 (ABC). Obtaining the coefficient from regression analysis, the multivariate quadratic equation was as follows: (2) Y = 4.46 - 0.20 X 1 + 0.030 X 2 + 0.0075 X 3 - 0.86 X 1 2 - 0.86 X 2 2 - 0.62 X 3 2 + 0.36 X 1 X 2 + 0.30 X 1 X 3 - 0.22 X 2 X 3 where X1 , X2 , and X3 represent the coded values of the level of factor A, B, and C, respectively, −1 to 1. The fold value of A: a=0.6+0.4X1 ; the fold value of B: b=6+2X2 ; and the fold value of C: c=3.5+ X3 . 3.1.4 Experimental validation Three-dimensional analysis of the response surface showed that the model existed a maximum, shown in Fig. 1 (ABC). The predicted highest alcohol production of 4.47g/L could be obtained at a=0.55, b=5.99, and c=3.48. Alcohol titre of 4.40g/L (the total of 3.81g/L ethanol, 0.54g/L butanol, and 0.05g/L hexanol) and organic acid titre of 0.50g/L (the total of 0.44g/L acetate, 0.05g/L butyrate, and 0.01g/L caproate) were obtained in verified experiments with these optimum conditions. Compared to basic medium with alcohol production of 2.16g/L (the total of 1.85g/L ethanol, 0.28g/L butanol, and 0.03g/L hexanol) and organic acid production of 2.37g/L (the total of 2.09g/L acetate, 0.25g/L butyrate, and 0.03g/L caproate), the alcohol titre in the optimized medium improved by 103.7%, and organic acid titre decreased by 78.9%, which meant that the ratio of alcohol to total product increased from 47.7% to 89.9% (Fig. 1D). In this study, molybdate exhibited the most significant but negative effect (minimum P=0.0046 in PBD) on alcohol synthesis. This result was presumably attributable to the hypothesis that molybdenum exerted an inhibitory role for tungsten-containing enzymes in acetogens. To our knowledge, tungsten-containing enzymes are commonly found in anaerobes (Hagedoorn et al., 2005) and become active under anaerobic conditions, possibly because they are well-adapted to the extremely low redox potential present during anaerobic growth (Andreesen and Makdessi, 2008). However, molybdenum is an analogue of tungsten, and the former can replace the latter in the active site of enzymes (Phillips et al., 2015). Simultaneously, molybdenum inhibited the uptake of tungsten when available tungstate was 10−6 mol/L (Wagner and Andreesen, 1987). Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is a key enzyme that catalyses the reduction of CO2 into formate. The active centre of FDH in the reported acetogens is of the tungsten-selenium-iron type (Phillips et al., 2015; Yamamoto et al., 1983); its activity was notably lower as molybdenum concentration increased (Andreesen and Makdessi, 2008). Accordingly, the results of this study suggested that the FDH of strain P7 might also belong to the tungsten-selenium-iron type, as in other acetogens. Additionally, the predicted tungsten-containing aldehyde oxidoreductase gene (CLJU_c20110) was correlated with higher expression and higher ethanol titre in anaerobic fermentation when C. ljungdahlii used CO/CO2 as a carbon source (Xie et al., 2015). Whitham et al. (2015) has also reported a higher expression profile for CLJU_c20210, another predicted tungsten-containing aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) in anaerobic cells; these results all indicated that tungsten-containing aldehyde oxidoreductase played a dominant role in the reassimilation of acid in gas-fermenting clostridia under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the presence of excessive molybdenum negatively regulated the reassimilation of acid and the synthesis of alcohols in C. carboxidivorans P7. The optimal iron ion concentration was 54.52μM, 10.2μM of which was from (NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O and 44.32μM of which was from FeCl3·6H2O. Iron ions are present in almost all of the metalloenzymes/proteins involved in CO/CO2 fixation, synthesis pathways of alcohols or energy conservation in acetogens, such as bifunctional carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) (Doukov et al., 2002), corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CFeSP) (Bruant et al., 2010), Hydrogenase (H2ase) (Cammack, 1999), FDH (Wagner and Andreesen, 1987), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE)/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Reid and Fewson, 1994; Walter et al., 1992), AOR (Hagedoorn et al., 2005) and the electron transport complex protein (Rnf) (Köpke et al., 2010). Iron ion is also a component of ferredoxin, the main carrier protein for electron transportation in acetogens. Each enzyme required dozens of Fe atoms (Phillips et al., 2015; Ragsdale, 2008). This could explain why the final concentration of iron ions was an order of magnitude higher than that of the other metals except for Co (Se 5.30μM, Ni 4.02μM, Cu 4.07μM, Zn 3.48μM, W 3.05μM and Mo 0.46μM). Saxena and Tanner (2011) have also found that removing iron from the medium in the gas fermentation by C. ragsdalei led to significant reductions in the activities of CODH, FDH, and ADH; and alcohol production decreased from 35.87mM to 6.30mM, although cell growth barely changed. Therefore, sufficient iron ions ensured high-efficiency CO/CO2 assimilation and alcohol synthesis in this organism. The production of alcohols increased to 4.40g/L from 2.16g/L, whereas that of organic acids, mainly acetate, decreased to 0.50g/L from 2.37g/L, indicating that the optimized medium could effectively improve alcohol titre and reduce the accumulation of organic acid. This might attribute to the both of improved activities of key enzymes involved in CO/CO2 fixation, synthesis pathways of alcohols (CODH, FDH, and ADH) and more reducing equivalents produced in the optimized medium. As above described, the activities of CODH, FDH, and ADH were influenced heavily by the availability of trace metals (Saxena and Tanner, 2011). In other aspect, as more alcohol was produced, more reducing equivalents were needed. CO was the main source of reducing equivalents in this gas fermentation. CODH catalysed the oxidation of CO and transferred electrons to ferredoxin; some of the latter directly participated the reaction that reassimilation of acid to aldehyde with AOR (Liew et al., 2017; Whitham et al., 2015) and the oxidization of some other ferredoxin was coupled to the generation of NAD(P)H to provide reducing equivalents for the synthesis of alcohols (Ragsdale, 2008, 2004; Reid and Fewson, 1994). Proper collaboration of high-efficiency CODH with a nickel-iron-copper centre (Doukov et al., 2002), sufficient ferredoxin, active AOR with tungsten-selenium-iron centre and iron-activated ADH led to the significantly elevated alcohol titre."
8,Effect of variable-temperature cultivation,"3.2 Effect of variable-temperature cultivation Bacterial flocculation was generally observed during the run of fermentation at 37°C, usually occurring within 48h of incubation after OD600 reached approximately 2 (data not shown). The variable-temperature experiment was designed to evaluate temperature’s effect on the growth and alcohol production of gas fermentation based on the optimized medium. The experimental groups were tested at 37°C for the first 24h and then transferred to 25°C for another 120h cultivation, with the control group set at 37°C for 144h. When applying the variable-temperature cultivation technique, there was no bacterial agglomeration at any point during the fermentation process, and the OD600 at the terminal point was near 6 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the organic acids in the control group reached their peak at 24h; these levels declined once but eventually rose to nearly the highest level at 144h, whereas levels in the experimental group gradually increased in the log phase and significantly decreased in the late-log phase. This indicated that the reassimilation of acid to aldehyde was promoted to a certain extent by lower-temperature cultivation. Incubation at 25°C has been reported to be an efficient method to overcome the “acid crash” (fast accumulation of organic acids during growing results in small or null solvent titre) (Ramió-Pujol et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2011). However, in this study, even with fermenting at 37°C during the entire process in basic medium, the acid crash was not observed although the final acid concentration of 2.37g/L (39.5mM) and pH (4.0) at 72h met the criteria prescribed in the report (Ramió-Pujol et al., 2015). On the other hand, incubation at lower temperature substantially improved acid reassimilation for alcohol synthesis and enhanced alcohol production. A hypothesis was proposed to explain high alcohol production at sub-temperature that at lower temperature molecules of membrane bilayer could be tend to arranged closely to resist fluidization effects of alcohol which damaged cell structure, resulting in that bacterial cell was tolerant to higher concentrations of solvent (Baer et al., 1987; Zhang et al., 2016). Compared to the control group, the highest alcohol titre in the experimental group was 6.97g/L, obtained at 144h (Fig. 2A), indicating a further enhancement of alcohol production by 70.0%. The data showed that butanol and hexanol production within 144h were 1.67g/L (22.6mM) and 1.33g/L (13.0mM), respectively, compared to 0.45g/L and 0.02g/L, respectively, in the control group. This enhanced alcohol production was primarily attributable to the significant increase in the production of medium-chain alcohols such as butanol and hexanol. In this work, notably higher production and productivity of butanol and hexanol in gas fermentation was obtained for strain P7 compared to the range reported in the literature. Ramió-Pujol et al. (2015) conducted gas fermentation at 25°C to promote the production of butanol and hexanol at a maximum of 14.5mM and 8.21mM (300h); Phillips et al. (2015) reported their highest titre of butanol and hexanol at 14.7mM and 9.2mM, respectively, by utilizing minimal medium and limiting the supply of CO (360h). As shown above, elevated higher alcohol synthesis by incubation at 25°C suggested that a lower temperature is beneficial to the elongation of the carbon chain, as reported by other groups (Zhang et al., 2016). The synthesis of higher alcohols requires more reducing equivalents than that are consumed by ethanol (Ramachandriya et al., 2013; Ramió-Pujol et al., 2015). However, in this study, the synthesis of higher alcohols was not significantly enhanced after the optimization of medium. In the low-temperature culture, the increased synthesis of higher alcohols was obvious. According to the results of Phillips et al. (2015), low temperature did not seem to be a prerequisite for the synthesis of higher alcohols. More work is needed to research the higher alcohol synthesis mechanism of C. carboxidivorans P7. In addition, bacterial flocculation was usually observed during the fermentation process at constant 37°C, where less biomass was generated in 144h compared with that at 37–25°C. Bacterial flocculation led to less mass transfer of substrates into the cytomembrane, and the bacterial growth was easily blocked, hindering the sustainability of fermentation. In the results, low-temperature cultivation overrode bacterial flocculation and prolonged the effective fermentation period, with the maximum concentration harvested at 144h whereas maximum at 72h for 37°C. Moreover, the variable-temperature cultivation technique occupied more advantages in terms of either effective fermentation period or highest production of alcohols. Interestingly, there are no reports in the literature to indicate that flocculation occurring during the C. carboxidivorans P7 fermentation process at 37°C could be overcome by cultivation at a lower temperature. This change was crucial to maintain the vitality of fermenting bacteria and achieve stable fermentation. However, the molecular mechanism of flocculation has not been clarified and is worthy of further exploration."
9,Conclusions,"This study employed a three-step statistical methodology to optimize the concentration of trace metals and their combination with variable-temperature cultivation (37°C for 0–24h, 25°C for 24–120h) successfully enhanced the production of alcohols, especially higher alcohols and the alcohol-product ratio. These results showed the enormous effects of trace metals and culture temperature on the growth and solventogenesis of C. carboxidivorans P7."
