0,Introduction,"Methanol with chemical formulae of CH3OH is historically known “wood alcohol” and is the simplest alcohol (methyl alcohol) which is colorless, volatile, light, and flammable liquid. Energy density of methanol is 4.4 kW h/l (5.5 kW h/kg) and the volumetric density of methanol is almost 6 times higher than that of hydrogen. Noble Prize winner, George A. Olah, introduced the concept of methanol economy in 1994. The global methanol demand is currently about 70 million tonne per year with a growth rate of 6–8% per year and it is anticipated to reach over 90 million tonne per year in the coming years [1]. Methanol is an essential ingredient with a wide range of applications. More than 50 % of methanol demand is used as feedstock for production of propylene/poly-propylene, acrylic acid/acrylates, ethylene/propylene, hydrogen, acetic acid, formaldehyde, etc. Methanol can also be used in gasoline blending. Other applications include use of methanol in fuel cells and for power production. The global oil and gas dependence could be lessened by substituting these fuels with methanol. Fig. 1 presents the breakdown of methanol consumption by final application. The highest methanol demand is for the production formaldehyde (30 %) followed by MTBE (12 %), fuels (12 %), acetic acid (10 %). About 6% of the methanol is used to produce DME. The greenhouse gases (GHGs) accumulation in the atmosphere and its impact on global warming is a critical issue and we must deal with it. The most important gasses ranked by the direct contribution to the greenhouse effect are water vapor (36–70 %), CO2 (9–26 %), CH4 (4–9%) and ozone O3 (3–7%), [2]. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of each kilogram of CH4 is approximately 84 times higher than one kilogram of CO2 for a 20-year period. Currently, the total CO2 emissions are about 32.2 billion tonne per annum [3]. The electricity and heat production sector with a share of about 42.4 % has the highest contribution to the global CO2 release. Methanol is a long-term chemical energy storage option to store the intermittent energy from renewable sources. The excess energy and/or intermittent renewables can be used to produce hydrogen by electrolyzing water. The produced hydrogen then reacts with CO2 to produce methanol. There are numerous sources of CO2 to be used for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol e.g. flue gas incineration, biogas purification, ethanol fermentation, steel mills, lime and cement industry, air capture, coal- and gas-fired power plants, etc. Owing to the increasing awareness of the obligations to mitigate CO2 emissions and because of government politics (e.g., cap-and-trade programs and CO2 tax), the conversion of CO2 to methanol gains industrial relevance. The global CO2 conversion into value-added chemicals such as (urea, methanol, di-methyl-ether (DME), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), formaldehyde, biodiesel, etc.) is about 0.2 billion tonne per annum [2]. The global CO2 demand for methanol and DME synthesis is respectively 8 million tonne per year and nearly 3 million tonne per year [2]. A comprehensive review on physical and chemical CO2 valorization pathways can be found in Ref. [2]. Utilization of CO2 in methanol production can either be indirectly (in the reforming stage) or directly in the methanol reactor. For example, Fanavaran methanol plant with annual capacity of one million tonne receives natural gas (610 kilo tonne) and CO2 (268 kilo tonne) from two petrochemical complexes. The natural gas, CO2, and steam are fed to a steam methane reformer (SMR) and the produced synthesis gas (syngas) is then conveyed to a downstream methanol synthesis reactor. The literature is rich in CO2 utilization for methanol synthesis. For example, four different system configurations including 1) integrated coal-to-liquids (CTL) and natural gas-to-liquids (GTL) plants, 2) combined nuclear-derived energy with CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process or CTL, 3) use of dry methane reforming (DMR) for chemicals and fuels production, and 4) integrated solar energy with H2O−CO2 splitting for chemicals and fuels production was analyzed in Ref. [4]. The combination of the processes using fossil fuels feed with carbon-free energy source reduces the amount of the CO2 release to the environment. Machado et al. investigated CO2 hydrogenation and methanol production route from syngas [5]. The effect of process conditions was studied. The CO2 consumption was 665 kilo tonne per year and the CO2 emission was 19.02 t per hour in the CO2 hydrogenation route. The feasibility of offshore CO2 utilization by DMR in methanol synthesis was studied in Ref. [6] from a techno-economic and environmental viewpoint. CO2 valorization through methanol synthesis was studied in Refs. [7,8]. Six syngas production routes including DMR with CO removal, DMR with H2 addition, SMR, bi-reforming, tri-reforming, and a parallel arrangement of DMR and SMR were considered. The DMR route with H2 addition results in a lower CO2 emission per unit of mass of the methanol produced. In another work, Pisarenko and colleagues [9] developed a methanol production process where syngas was produced by DMR. The process encompasses four serial methanol reactors. The results suggest that CO2 recycling to the reforming section results in an increased methanol production. The power to methanol concept developed by Carbon Recycling International (CRI) company refers to the case that power is stored in methanol. The largest CO2 hydrogenation plant is located in Iceland [10]. This methanol plant uses 5.5 kilo tonne CO2 per annum. The energy requirements of the methanol plant are supplied by hydropower and geothermal energy. Hydrogen is provided by water electrolyzers. Chakrabortty et al. reviewed various routes for the anthropogenic CO2 capture and further conversion to methanol [11]. The membrane-integrated photocatalytic approach is a green route to have high methanol yield and very high methanol purity. Samimi and co-workers investigated the methanol synthesis from hydrogen and CO2 [12]. Syngas was first produced in a reverse water gas shift reactor and then the syngas was conveyed to a methanol reactor. The methanol reactor was equipped by water perm-selective membrane to remove water from the reactor. The methanol production rate of the process is nearly 21 % higher than the conventional methanol synthesis route. In another study, two pathways for indirect CO2 utilization for methanol production via reverse water gas shift reaction were studied in Ref. [13]. In the first route, CO2 was first converted to syngas in a reverse water gas shift reactor, was fed to a condenser, and then was conveyed to the methanol production reactor. In the second pathway, a water permselective membrane was used in the reverse water gas shift reactor. The results suggested the superiority of pathway 2 over pathway 1, owing to the following reasons: a higher CO yield and CO2 conversion, a more appropriate syngas composition, about 4.15 % higher methanol production rate, and ca. 17 % lower water production. Samimi et al. studied the phase stability of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in gas cooled, water cooled, and double (water + gas) cooled tubular reactors [14]. The results suggest that the gas cooled reactor layout has higher methanol production and CO2 conversion. In addition, liquid phase does not form in the gas cooled layout. Various CO2-based methanol production routes were analyzed by Gonzalez-Garay et al. [15]. The results show that production of green methanol is economically unattractive due to its higher cost compared to the conventional fossil-based route. In Ref. [16], Li et al. reviewed the recent activities for producing renewable H2 and CO2, in addition to the developments in the production of bimetallic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. In this study, possible design advances for the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol (as an energy storage option) through a fixed-bed reactor is investigated to maximize methanol production rate, CO2 conversion (CO2 utilization), and hydrogen conversion."
1,Methanol production process,
2,CO2 Hydrogenation to methanol process,"2.1 CO2 Hydrogenation to methanol process The conversion of CO2 and hydrogen to methanol process removes the costly syngas production section of the conventional methanol production pathway (from fossil fuels) if the hydrogen feed is produced from renewables [17]. Various types of reactor including adiabatic, continuous stirred-tank (CSTR), fluidized bed, gas-, or water-cooled fixed bed reactors can be used for methanol synthesis [18,19]. Adiabatic and gas-cooled reactors demonstrate fairly low and medium fixed capital costs. CSTR reactors have lower conversion and operating temperature. The methanol production rate of fluidized bed reactors are higher than the fixed bed reactors [20]. Methanol synthesis in fixed-bed tubular reactors is a common industrial practice. The pressure of the coolant medium flowing in the shell side facilitates the control of the methanol reactor temperature by the water phase change. The CO2 hydrogenation process to methanol includes water-cooled multi-tubular fixed bed reactors (Fig. 2 a). The CO2 can be imported over the fence from CO2 emitting industries. The hydrogen stream, on the other hand, can be produced by electrolyzing excess power to H2 and O2. Methanol synthesis is performed at pressure range of 50–80 bar and moderate temperature range of 200–300 °C enclosed by a shell. The recycling of unconverted syngas can be done in the methanol synthesis owing to the fact that reactions conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. The decision variables of the reactor system of Fig. 2a are the coolant medium temperature, heat transfer area, H2/CO2 molar ratio to the reactor, and level of catalyst dilution. For a given feed composition and flowrate, different objective functions can be considered, e.g. maximization of CO2 utilization, methanol production rate at the effluent of the reactor, hydrogen conversion, etc."
3,Conventional methanol production process,"2.2 Conventional methanol production process Conventional methanol production routes use a two-step catalytic chemical process i.e. syngas production from natural gas, syngas conversion to methanol, and then methanol purification. Various reforming technologies such as steam methane reforming (SMR), dry methane reforming (DMR), auto-thermal reforming (ATR), and the like can be used to convert fossil fuels e.g. natural gas to syngas [21]. Other feedstocks such as biomass, coal, and municipal waste could also be used to produce syngas. Currently, the estimated capital investment costs of most large-scale methanol production plants are $500–$700/tonne MeOH/year with an average value of about $530 /tonne MeOH/year [22]. In addition, the estimated capital investment costs of small-scale methanol production plants may vary from $700 to $1100/tonne MeOH/year. Fig. 2b represents conventional methanol production from natural gas. As evident from this figure, natural gas is preheated in the fired heater and then is mixed with steam and enters the auto-thermal reformer (ATR) at 675 °C [23–25]. Pure oxygen from the air separation unit (ASU) is heated up to 200 °C and is fed to the ATR [26–28]. In the ATR, natural gas is converted to syngas which mainly consists of hydrogen and CO [29,30]. The hot syngas leaving the ATR is cooled down to separate water from it, produce steam and then is compressed before entering the methanol reactor."
4,Mathematical modelling of methanol reactor,"The main assumptions used to develop the reaction path model are one-dimensional flow, steady-state mode of operation, gas phase reactions, no extra feed distribution, water-cooled reactor, plug flow model for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, the feed temperature is 220 °C, reactor pressure is fixed at 82 bar, reactor temperature is constrained by 270 °C, and the total volume ( V ) is 100 m3. The mass balance of components ( i : H2, CO2, CO, methanol, and H2O) over a differential control volume is represented by the following sets of ordinary differential equations [31]: (1) W d ω i d V = u A R ∼ i ( x ) It is presumed that W (total mass flow rate) does not vary with mole number change, reactor temperature, and pressure gradient along the path. In Eq. (1), the mass fractions ( ω i ) vary along the path due to reactions. u A is the catalyst activity and varies between 0 and unity. The methanol synthesis reactions from a mixture of hydrogen and CO2 are: the hydrogenation of CO2, Eq. (2), and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, Eq. (3). (2) CO2 + 3H2 ↔ CH3OH + H2O ΔH298=-49.5 kJ/mol (3) CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2 ΔH298 = 41 kJ/mol Reaction (2) is exothermic while Reaction (3) is endothermic. The reaction rate of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, Reactions (2) and (3), over copper-zinc oxide on alumina (CuZA) catalyst were taken from [32]. The reaction rates are functions of component mole fractions, and reactor pressure and temperature. (4) r 2 = k 2 K C O 2 ( P C O 2 P H 2 3 2 - P C H 3 O H P H 2 O K p 2 P H 2 3 2 ) ( 1 + K C O P C O + K C O 2 P C O 2 ) ( P H 2 1 2 + K H 2 O K H 2 1 2 P H 2 O ) (5) r 3 = k 3 K C O 2 ( P C O 2 P H 2 - P H 2 O P C O K p 3 ) ( 1 + K C O P C O + K C O 2 P C O 2 ) ( P H 2 1 2 + K H 2 O K H 2 1 2 P H 2 O ) Where: k 2 = 23.4 × exp ( - 52570 R T ) k 3 = 4.84 × 10 11 × exp ( - 140020 R T ) K p 2 = 1.959 × 10 - 11 × exp 59030 R T K p 3 = 117.52 × exp - 39652 R T K C O 2 = 7.05 × 10 - 7 × exp 61700 R T K C O = 2.16 × 10 - 5 × exp 46800 R T K H 2 O K H 2 1 2 = 6.37 × 10 - 9 × exp 84000 R T For each chemical component (H2, CO2, CO, methanol, and H2O) a net production rate (positive if it is produced and negative if it is consumed considering all the reactions in the system) is defined: (6) R H 2 = - 3 r 1 + r 2 (7) R CO 2 = - r 1 + r 2 (8) R CO = - r 2 (9) R MeOH = r 1 (10) R H 2 O = r 1 - r 2 The fluid model is on mass basis (kg/m3/s) so it is required that Eqs. (6)–(10) be multiplied by molecular weights ( M i ), i.e. R ∼ i = R i M i . At any point along the reactor, the sum of reaction rates on mass basis ( R ∼ i ) must be zero, i.e. ∑ i = 1 5 R ∼ i = 0 . The energy conservation law of the fluid is written as follows [31]: (11) W c p d T d V = ∑ j = 1 2 ( - Δ r H ) j r j - U a ( T - T w ) (12) c p = ∑ i = 1 5 c p , i ω i , a = A r e a V Where, c p is the heat capacity of the gas mixture (kJ/kg K), ( - Δ r H ) j is the reactions heat (kJ/kmol), U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, a is the area density (kW/m K), T is the reactor temperature (K), and T w is the coolant medium temperature (K). The optimal design functions and concentration of the key component i.e. methanol at the end of reactor path is found by solving the set of mass and energy ordinary differential equations Eq. (13). The objective function ( J ) is a function of state variables z = [ ω i T , T ] T at the end of reactor path. (13) max J s . t . d z d V = f z , D O F s ; z 0 = z 0 Where z = [ ω i T , T ] T The optimization problems consisting of ordinary or partial differential equations are called optimal control problems. In this paper, the collocation method on finite elements (direct method) was used to transform the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to nonlinear algebraic equations. Partial differential equations represented by Eqs. (1) and (13) were discretized on volume ( V ) and the resulting nonlinear equations were included in the optimization problem. The following objective functions were maximized to find the optimal decision variables: (14) J 1 = Methanol mass production rate at the end of path ( kg / s ) (15) J 2 = CO 2 conversion ( % ) (16) J 3 = H 2 conversion ( % ) Objective function (14), the mass production rate of methanol at the effluent of the reactor (reactor productivity), is the maximum attainable production rate of the key component at the end of path subject to the optimization constraints. The MATLAB optimization toolbox finds the optimal decision variables of the non-linear optimization problem. Objective function (21) is the maximum possible CO2 utilization (or the minimum CO2 release to the air) along the reactor path. CO2 is converted to CO and methanol. So, maximizing CO2 utilization does not necessarily lead to the maximum methanol production. Objective function (16) describes the maximum hydrogen conversion potential (or the maximum energy storage) of the methanol reactor."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Methanol production from CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 2a),"4.1 Methanol production from CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 2a) Table 1 shows the various cases with different syngas composition (H2 to CO2 ratio), and objective function criteria (Eqs. (14)–(16)). 4.1.1 Maximizing methanol mass production rate Case (1) The CO2 and hydrogen streams are fed to a single reactor with volume of 100 m3 [31]. The inlet mass flowrate is 34.7 kg/s. The optimization problem has 3 degrees of freedom. The methanol weight percentage at the reactor outlet is 7.02 %. The methanol production rate of this case is lower than that reported in Ref. [31] where methanol production from a CO-rich syngas stream was considered. This owes to the fact that the inlet mole fraction of CO to the reactor is 21 % in Ref. [31]. The conversion of hydrogen is 64.0 % and about 48.9 % of CO2 is converted to methanol and CO. The conversions of hydrogen and CO2 are higher than those reported in Refs. [12,13] because of impurity-free syngas feed, higher reactor pressure and temperature. The catalyst activity is unity and U a is 90.07 kW/m3K. The weight percentage of CO at the end of reactor is 8.85 %, and the maximum CO weight percentage is 11.92 % and takes place at the 21.1 % of the reactor volume. The change of mass fraction of components and reaction rates along the reactor are shown in Fig. 3 a. As evident from this figure, CO is first produced in the 0–21.12 % of the reactor volume and then consumed along the reactor. CO2 and H2 reaction rates are negative, and water and methanol reactions rates are always positive along the reactor. Fig. 3b represents the change of molar H2/CO2 and CO/CO2 ratios along the reactor. The molar H2/CO2 ratio increases from 1.68 (at the inlet) to about 1.70 and then declines to 1.53 at the end of reactor. The CO/CO2 increases from 0.15 to about 0.25 at 21 % of the reactor volume and then declines to 0.19. The carbon efficiency of the process is 47.37 % which is lower than that reported in Ref. [31] since the inlet mole fraction of CO to the CO2 hydrogenation reactor is zero. Case (2) In this case, the CO2 and hydrogen streams with a H2/CO2 molar ratio of 3 are fed to a single reactor. The inlet mass flowrate to the reactor is 36.1 kg/s. There are 3 degrees of freedom for optimization. The methanol mass production rate at the reactor outlet is 17.32 kg/s with weight percentage of 12.12 %. Increasing the inlet H2/CO2 molar ratio from 2, Case (1), to 3 increases the methanol production rate by 58.17 %. The conversion of hydrogen is 79.5 % and about 72.3 % of CO2 is converted to methanol and CO. The catalyst activity is unity and U a is 109.78 kW/m3K which is higher than Case (1). The weight percentage of CO at the end of reactor is 11.08 %, the maximum CO weight percentage is 16.00 % and takes place at the 21.12 % of the reactor volume. The profiles are shown in Fig. 4 a and b. The H2/CO2 increases from 4.6 at the beginning of the reactor to 5.28 and then goes down to 5.14 at the reactor outlet. The reactor CO/CO2 ratio hits the maximum value of 0.42 and drops to 0.31 at the reactor outlet. 4.1.2 Maximizing CO2 utilization (conversion) Case (3) This case is similar to Case (1) except that the objective function is maximization of CO2 utilization (conversion) at the end of reactor. The methanol mass fraction at the outlet of the reactor is 7.05 % that is higher than that of Case (1). The conversion of hydrogen is 64.1 % and about 49.0 % of CO2 is converted to methanol and CO. The catalyst activity is unity and U a is 135.10 kW/m3K which is higher than Case (1). The weight percentage of CO at the end of reactor is 8.9 %, and the maximum CO weight percentage is 12.2 %. The maximum H2/CO2 molar ratio is 1.71 and the maximum CO/CO2 ratio is 0.25. Case (4) Here, the hydrogen to CO2 molar ratio is 3 and is fed to a single reactor and the CO2 conversion was maximized. The inlet mass flowrate to the reactor is 36.1 kg/s. The mass flowrate of methanol at the outlet of the reactor is 17.41 kg/s with weight percentage of 12.29 %. Increasing the inlet H2/CO2 molar ratio from 2, Case (3), to 3 increases the methanol production rate by 58.71 %. The conversion of hydrogen is 79.8 % and about 72.6 % of CO2 is converted to methanol and CO. The CO2 conversion of this case is 48.16 % which is higher than Case (3). The catalyst activity is 1 and U a is 164.68 kW/m3K which is lower than Case (3). The weight percentage of CO at the end of reactor is 10.93. The maximum CO/CO2 ratio is 0.42 and the maximum H2/CO2 molar ratio is 5.28. 4.1.3 Maximizing H2 conversion Case (5) In this case, the CO2 and hydrogen with molar ratio of 2 are fed to a single reactor. The inlet mass flowrate to the reactor is 34.7 kg/s. The mass fraction of methanol at the outlet of the reactor, the H2 and CO2 conversions are very close to those of Case (1). In addition, the coolant temperature and maximum reactor temperature are close to those of Case (1) where the methanol concentration at the end of reactor was maximized. In this case, the catalyst activity is unity and the U a is 90.07 kW/m3K. The weight percentage of CO at the end of reactor is 8.90 %. The maximum H2/CO2 molar ratio is 1.70 and the maximum CO/CO2 ratio is 0.25. Case (6) This case is similar to Case (2) except that the objective function was set to maximize the H2 conversion. The optimization results of this case are very close of those of Case (2). In addition, the production rate of methanol is greater than Case (5) where the H2/CO2 molar ratio is 2. The catalyst activity is unity and U a is 109.78 kW/m3K. The maximum H2/CO2 molar ratio is 5.28 and the maximum CO/CO2 ratio is 0.42. A case study was conducted to investigate the effect of feed temperature on the optimal decision variables of the once-through reactor path. A feed containing CO2 and hydrogen with molar ratio of H2/CO2 of 2 (and inlet mass flowrate to the reactor of 34.7 kg/s) was considered. For a single-stage reactor and Eq. (14) as the objective function, increasing the feed temperature from 190 to 250 °C results in increasing the production rate of methanol by 0.55 %, and decreasing the coolant temperature from 240.1–236.7 °C. In addition, the catalyst activity is equal to unity for all cases and U a declines from 59.80 to 12.98 kW/m3K. Another case study was carried out to investigate the impact of staging of the methanol reactor on the methanol production rate. For a two-stage methanol reactor and the inlet H2/CO2 ratio of 2, the reactor productivity increases by 0.57 % compared to Case (1). The volume of the first reactor becomes 10.8 m3. In addition, the average U a of the system reduces to 25.84 kW/m3K. The conversions of CO2 and H2 of the two-stage reactor system are 49 % and 64.2 %, respectively. For a two-stage methanol reactor and the inlet H2/CO2 ratio of 3, the methanol production rate of the staged reactor is system is 0.7 % higher than the single-stage case, i.e. Case (2). The volume of the first reactor becomes 6.9 m3 and the average U a of the system is the same as the U a of Case (2). The conversions of CO2 and H2 of the staged reactor system are 61.2 %, and 66.6 %, respectively."
7,Conventional methanol production (Fig. 2b),"4.2 Conventional methanol production (Fig. 2b) The natural gas demand in the conventional methanol production route is 28.5 MMBTU/tonne methanol which is equivalent to 0.0343 MMSCFD/tonne methanol [33]. The required natural gas to the process side and to the fired heater (Fig. 2b) were calculated based on the methanol production rates of Case (1)- Case (6) and is shown in Fig. 5 . The steam to carbon ratio to the reformer was fixed at 1 in Aspen Hysys. The make-up natural gas to the fired heater supplies the required heat to preheat feed streams and to generate steam to drive compressors in the air separation unit. The required natural gas to the reformer (process side) of Fig. 2b is about 85 % of the total natural gas consumption of the process with methanol production rate of the cases represented in Table 1. For each objective function criteria, as evident from Fig. 5, the higher the H2/CO to the methanol reactor, the higher the required natural gas is. For instance, the natural gas consumption of Case (2)> Case (1), Case (4) > Case (3), and Case (6)> Case (5). In addition, for each case, the natural gas consumption in the process side is higher than the make-up natural gas. In the case that the hydrogen intake to the methanol reactor is supplied from electrolyzing water, a pure oxygen stream is available to be sold or to be used in other processes. At H2/CO2 molar ratio of 2, the produced oxygen is 722.35 mol/s while about 1083.50 mol/s pure oxygen is available at H2/CO2 molar ratio of 3. The required energy to produce 1 t oxygen via conventional air separation unit is 400 kW h power [24]. This means that producing 1 t of pure oxygen (Fig. 2b) requires ca. 0.08294 t natural gas. In terms of CO2 emissions, the process shown in Fig. 2a uses a pure CO2 stream from a CO2 capturing unit. In other words, no fossil fuel is used in this configuration and the pure oxygen stream from the electrolyzer saves 1.92 kg/s natural gas when the inlet H2/CO2 is 2 and ca. 2.88 kg/s natural gas in the cases with the inlet H2/CO2 of 3. The higher the natural gas savings, the lower the CO2 emissions. Thereby, the net CO2 emissions of configuration Fig. 2a is -5.27 kg/s in Case (1), Case (3), and Case (5) while it is -7.91 kg/s in Case (2), Case (4), and Case (6). However, Fig. 2b utilizes natural gas in the process side and in the fired heater which in turn emits CO2 to the environment. Fig. 6 compares the net CO2 emissions of conventional methanol production route when the same amount of methanol of Case (1)- Case (6) is produced. As evident from this figure, in the case that hydrogen is produced via water electrolysis, the CO2 emission of the process route shown in Fig. 2a is negative. Higher inlet molar H2/CO2 ratio to the methanol reactor translates to higher oxygen production via electrolyzer and higher natural gas saving compared to the conventional air separation route. In the conventional methanol production route, the higher the inlet H2/CO2 ratio, the higher the CO2 emission."
8,Conclusions,"The methanol production via conventional and CO2 hydrogenation routes are investigated. In the CO2 hydrogenation route, methanol production rate, CO2 conversion, and hydrogen conversion are maximized. Based on the optimization results, the methanol production rate of the cases with inlet H2/CO2 of 3 is higher than those with inlet H2/CO2 composition of 2. The impact of feed temperature on the optimal decision variables of the reactor path was investigated for the case that the H2/CO2 ratio of feed is 2. Altering the feed temperature between 190 and 250 °C increases the methanol mass fraction by 0.55 % and reduces the coolant temperature from 240.1–236.7 °C. In addition, the heat transfer area drops from 59.80 to 12.98 kW/m3K. Key performance indicators methanol production via conventional and CO2 hydrogenation routes are compared. For each objective function criteria, the higher the H2/CO to the methanol reactor, the higher the required natural gas is. For instance, the natural gas consumption of Case (2)> Case (1), Case (4) > Case (3), and Case (6)> Case (5). If hydrogen is produced via water electrolysis, the CO2 emission of the process route shown in Fig. 2a is negative. In the conventional methanol production route, for each objective function criteria, the higher the inlet H2/CO2 ratio the higher the CO2 emission."
