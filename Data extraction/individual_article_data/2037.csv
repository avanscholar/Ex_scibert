0,Introduction,"Epoxides are important intermediates in the chemical industry due to their reactivity. Generally epoxides can be synthesized by the addition of molecular or chemically bound oxygen such as: peroxy acids, hydrogen peroxide or halohydrins [1]. All these approaches are disadvantageous as unwanted side products such as hydroxy esters and diols are formed in addition to a surplus of acidic wastes [2,3]. Epoxides produced by the Prileschajew reaction involve the use of stoichiometric amounts of peroxy acid to the alkenes used and is generally carried out in organic solvents in the presence of a mineral acid, the general scheme of which is given in Scheme 1 . Different types of peroxy acids have been used to epoxidize alkenes, but most commonly: meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) [4]. m-CPBA is a strong electrophilic reagent and thus highly reactive in the oxidation of alkenes, sulfides, selenides and amines; but a major drawback is the shock sensitivity and a detonative nature [5]. Hence, the use of high amounts of peroxy acids as starting material for such reactions is avoided; however desensitized or in situ generated versions of peroxy acids can be used. Industrially, they are synthesized by reacting hydrogen peroxide with carboxylic acids or carboxylic anhydrides or carboxylic acid chlorides [6]. Nevertheless, these processes require the addition of excess amounts of mineral acids and severe reaction conditions, which is a major disadvantage [7]."
1,Lipase mediated epoxidation,"1.1 Lipase mediated epoxidation In 1990, Fredrik Björkling and his co-workers were able to reproduce the Prileschajew reaction using lipases (glycerol ester hydrolases E.C. 3.1.1.3). Carboxylic acids (C8–C16 aliphatic acids) when treated with hydrogen peroxide in organic solvents using lipases as catalysts formed the corresponding peroxy acids, which subsequently formed epoxides from their corresponding alkenes. This process is advantageous due to mild reaction conditions (temperature and pH) and avoidance of mineral acids [8]. Using this method, various alkenes including terpenes have successfully been epoxidized [8,9] and even Baeyer–Villiger oxidations on a range of ketones were achieved [10]. Hydrogen peroxide is needed in equimolar amounts for the epoxidation of alkenes and is consumed during the course of the reaction. On the other hand, adding large amounts of hydrogen peroxide at the start leads to potential inactivation of the lipase [8,9]. Moreover, in harsh environments, terpenes and its epoxides are rapidly rearranged to unwanted side products [11]. It has also been proven that with an excess of hydrogen peroxide, the tendency of the lipase mediated epoxidation system to produce secondary products other than the epoxide have already been documented for limonene [12] and for α-pinene [13]. This can partly be overcome by stepwise addition of hydrogen peroxide to the reaction over a stipulated point of time as has been done previously [8,9] or by in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide."
2,Hydrogen peroxide production process,"1.2 Hydrogen peroxide production process Out of the known processes to produce hydrogen peroxide, such as the traditional wet chemical process of L.J. Thenard (treatment of barium peroxide with nitric acid), the electrochemical process of Meidinger (1853) and Berthelot (1878) involving the electrolysis of sulphuric acid and the shell 2-propanol process (oxidation of secondary alcohols at 60°C), we considered the anthraquinone (AQ) process [14]. The anthraquinone process consists of hydrogenation, oxidation, extraction of hydrogen peroxide and working solution treatment steps. The working solution generally consists of a hydrophobic solvent to dissolve the AQ like xylene, mesitylene or benzene and a hydrophilic one to dissolve the produced anthrahydroquinone (AHQ) in the form of alkylcyclohexanol esters, nonyl alcohols or alkyl phosphates. The AQ used is generally a 2-alkyl anthraquinone, for e.g. 2-ethyl anthraquinone, 2-tert-butylanthraquinone, or a mixture of any 2-alkyl anthraquinones. The hydrogenation step is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, typically palladium or nickel at a temperature of 40–50°C, at the end of which, the catalyst has to be removed to prevent the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. The oxidation step is carried out at 25–60°C and involves the supply of air or oxygen to the hydrogenated working solution to form AQ and equimolar amounts of hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then extracted in a counter-current fashion to produce 30% by weight, further capable of concentration till 70%. The working solution devoid of impurities is then recycled to the hydrogenation tank for the repetition of the process [14,15]."
3,Combination of hydrogen peroxide production with lipase mediated epoxdiation,"1.3 Combination of hydrogen peroxide production with lipase mediated epoxdiation There have been previous successful attempts in combining the in situ hydrogen peroxide production by photo-catalytic [16] or electrolytic means with enzymatic processes involving chloroperoxidase [17] or horse radish peroxidase [18] or using cofactor analogs [19]. The present work however, focuses on the combination of the classical chemical method of hydrogen peroxide production, i.e. the anthraquinone process with the lipase mediated epoxidation system (Scheme 2 ). In an initial reaction step, AQ is reduced to AHQ in the presence of a palladium catalyst at 45°C for a time period of 6h. Then the palladium catalyst is filtered off from the reaction system followed by another step, the oxygenation of AHQ to AQ at 25–30°C which is then combined with the lipase mediated epoxidation system. In addition to checking the feasibility of such a process, a 323A variety of hydrophobic solvents (toluene, xylene and n-heptane), hydrophilic solvents (ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and 2-methyl 2-butanol), catalyst to substrate ratio (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10%) and a variety of monoterpenes such as limonene, alpha-pinene and 3-carene were also tested."
4,Materials and procedures,
5,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals 2-Ethyl anthraquinone (EAQ), palladium on carbon (10% loading, matrix activated carbon support (Pd/C)), 3-carene, α-pinene and 2-methyl-2-butanol were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co. LLC. Toluene was purchased from Chem Solute, Germany. Ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and n-heptane were purchased from Carl Roth, Germany. Hydrogen peroxide (35%) was purchased from Avantomaterials, Netherlands. Lipase enzyme (CALB, 7500TBU/g) was purchased from Chiral Vision, Netherlands."
6,Typical reaction condition,"2.2 Typical reaction condition For the final epoxidation system the following reaction conditions were used and all reactions were performed as duplicates. Hydrogenation of anthraquinone (AQ): 1.67mmol AQ, 10mol% (palladium on carbon), hydrophobic solvent: hydrophilic solvent (60:40, v/v) total volume of 10mL, hydrogen atmosphere, 45°C and 6h reaction time Filtration of the palladium catalyst: The reactants from the hydrogenation step were filtered twice using a Whatman filter paper of pore size 0.21μm. Combined oxygenation and epoxidation reaction: Carried out using an open system under reflux with 0.5mmol monoterpene (α-pinene, 3-carene or limonene), 50mg lipase, reaction time of 16h, reaction temperature of 25–30°C and 100μL of distilled water was added to the reaction system. Standard tests for lipase mediated epoxidation: 0.05mmol monoterpene, 0.15mmol hydrogen peroxide (35%), 30mg CALB, 0.025mmol carboxylic acid, reaction temperature – 60°C.tBAQ inhibition tests: Varying concentrations of tBAQ (50mM to 1M), CALB 30mg, 0.05mmol monoterpene, 0.15mmol hydrogen peroxide (35%), 0.025mmol carboxylic acid. Quantification of hydrogen peroxide concentration: The hydrogen peroxide concentration in the system was determined using peroxide quantification strips (Quantofix®). 5μL of sample was added to a pre wetted Quantofix® strip and the amount of peroxide in the system was calculated accordingly depending on the intensity of color produced (provided by the supplier as a chart)."
7,Analytics,"2.3 Analytics The analytics of monoterpenes, their corresponding epoxides, AQ and AHQ were carried out on a gas chromatograph (GC-QP 2010, Shimadzu) coupled with an autoinjector (AOC-5000 by Jain, compipal) fitted with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS-QP2010 Plus, Shimadzu). A 30m long BPX5 column with a diameter of 0.25mm and thickness of 0.25μm was used with helium as the carrier gas and a temperature profile as given below: 1. Gas chromatography: Start at 60°C (hold 1min), increase to 170°C with 10°C/min and then increase to 270°C with 70°C/min (hold 3min). 2. Mass spectrometer: Ion source temperature of 200°C, interface temperature of 250°C. The analysis was carried out using the software GC–MS Postrun Analysis provided by Shimadzu and the mass to charge ratio (m/Q) of all the compounds used in this study were compared to the database of National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) library; version 08. In order to avoid huge signals from the ethylacetate (solvent), a solvent cut of peak at 3.9min was implemented with the help of the software. The retention time for the different substrate and products are: 5.705min for limonene, 7.282min for limonene oxide, 4.392 for α-pinene, 6.735 for α-pinene oxide, 5.420min for 3-carene and 7.217min for 3-carene oxide. For the EAQ and tBAQ measurements on the GC the same method was followed with one alteration: the final holding time of 3min at 270°C was extended to 7min. The retention times of the quinones and their hydrogenated products are as follows: 16.551min for EAQ, 16.459min for 2-ethyl anthrahydroquinone (EAHQ), 16.938min for tBAQ and 16.861min for tert-butyl anthrahydroquinone (tBAHQ)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Optimization of the anthraquinone process,"3.1 Optimization of the anthraquinone process 3.1.1 Choice of solvents The first step in this reaction cascade was the hydrogenation of AQ in the presence of a palladium catalyst in a suitable reaction medium. The AQ/AHQ reaction medium should consist of a hydrophobic part to dissolve the AQ and a more hydrophilic part to dissolve the AHQ. Industrially, the use of benzene, methyl naphthalene or trimethyl benzene for the AQ system and alkyl phosphates, nonyl alcohols or tetra alkyl ureas for the AHQ system [14] would be recommended; however, in the interest of combining it with the lipase system, different solvent systems were investigated. The screening for the most suitable solvents were carried out with toluene, xylene and n-heptane as hydrophobic solvents and ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and 2-methyl 2-butanol as the hydrophobic solvents. The best solvent combination was selected based on the maximal amount of hydrogen peroxide produced at the end of the autooxidation process of AQ after 6h of hydrogenation at 60°C and 16h of oxygenation at 50°C. Results revealed that the initially targeted system containing ethyl acetate as acid donor for the lipase mediated peracid formation (see scheme 2), i.e. toluene:ethyl acetate (60:40, v/v) was the best combination for producing a surplus of hydrogen peroxide. 3.1.2 Choice of anthraquinone substrates Following the choice of the solvent system, the best substrate for the hydrogen peroxide production was to be chosen. 2-Ethyl anthraquinone (EAQ) and 2-tert-butyl anthraquinone (tBAQ) were selected [14,20] and their hydrogenation at three different operating temperatures (30, 45 and 60°C) was tested. These moderate temperatures were chosen because of the fact that at temperatures above 60°C, unselective hydrogenation of AQ substrates was expected [20], thereby affecting the yield of hydrogen peroxide. The conversion was quantified by GC–MS analysis and the ratio of substrate peak decrease and product peak increase. From Figs. 1 and 2 , it can be seen that at low temperatures, the conversion tends to be less than 60% and for 45°C and 60°C, 100% conversion is achieved within 4h in both cases. Considering the energy input and the reaction time needed for 100% conversion of EAQ and tBAQ, 45°C was chosen as the reaction temperature for hydrogenation and tBAQ was chosen as the suitable substrate. 3.1.3 Determination of best mol% of Pd-catalyst The hydrogenations of tBAQ were all performed in a hydrogen atmosphere in the working solution of toluene: ethyl acetate (60:40, v/v) in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Four ratios, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10mol% of Pd/C were tested at a reaction condition of 1.67mmol tBAQ, (60:40, v/v) toluene:ethyl acetate, reaction temperature of 45°C. The results were quantified based on the hydrogen peroxide produced at the end of oxygenation for 16h at a temperature of 30°C. Of the four ratios tested, 10mol% yielded the maximum amount of hydrogen peroxide (more than 200mg/L of peroxide) at the end of reaction time, while the other ratios yielded less hydrogen peroxide. 3.1.4 Oxidation step of the hydrogenated tBAQ Before the oxidation step could take place it was mandatory to completely remove the palladium catalyst via filtration because trace amounts of the catalyst lead to quick decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the oxygenation step [14]. This was evident from initial experiments where traces of palladium were still in the reaction solution upon oxygenation and hydrogen peroxide yields were very poor. The Pd/C was carefully filtered using Whatman filter papers of pore size of 0.21μm and when all of the palladium catalyst was filtered off, the solution was reddish orange to dark brown in color which was then subjected to a non-catalytic oxidation step. The oxygenation step is the penultimate step in the anthraquinone process where the hydrogenated tBAQ is converted to tBAQ and equimolar amounts of hydrogen peroxide. It was carried out in three different ways in the present work: by bubbling air through the system, maintaining the system under air atmosphere and by leaving the system open to air. Of all the three systems tested, the bubbling of air was the most successful way to produce surplus amounts of hydrogen peroxide. Leaving the system open to air was also successful, but with considerable loss of solvents as well. The air atmosphere (achieved by balloon filled with air) was considered unsuitable as solely trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide were produced and this was not feasible for the combination with the lipase system. Hence a combination of bubbling air through the system was chosen as the best possible way to carry out the oxygenation step of the AQ process. Of all the temperatures tested for the oxidation (25, 30, 45 and 60°C), best results were obtained with 25–30°C."
10,Combination of AQ process with lipase mediated epoxidation,"3.2 Combination of AQ process with lipase mediated epoxidation The combined system was setup as mentioned in Section 2.2. Three different monoterpenes, limonene, 3-carene and α-pinene were tested for possible integration into the new combined system. Of all the substrates tested, limonene yielded a maximum conversion of 83 (±9%), 3-carene 82 (±8%) and α-pinene, a maximum conversion of 76 (±8%) (Fig. 3 ). No side reactions such as rearrangement or oxirane ring opening were observed under these rather mild reaction conditions. Tests with these different monoterpenes and similar reaction conditions with commercial hydrogen peroxide (35%) yielded 100% conversion within 6h at 60°C (data not shown). In a previous work we showed that limonene was converted to diepoxides as well when using hydrogen peroxide in excess, with the ratio of monoepoxide to diepoxide in the range of 76.4:26.6%. However, in this work, no diepoxide formation was observed [12]. A possible inhibition of CALB by the tBAQ was suspected for the low conversion of the monoterpenes to their corresponding epoxides and hence, tests were done with varying amounts of tBAQ to check for inhibition and it was discovered that up to a concentration of 1M tBAQ, there was no inhibition. Reaction time of 16h was suspected to be too short since residual hydrogen peroxide was still present in the system (checked with hydrogen peroxide strips, Quantofix). However extended reaction times up to 40h, showed no higher conversion of the monoterpenes compared to 16h. Most likely, the H2O2-peroxide concentration was below the critical minimum needed to exhibit lipase activity for the peroxy acid generation. The effect of acetic acid and ethanol set free from the enzymatic cleavage of ethyl acetate and water by CALB could also be a contributing factor for the incomplete conversion of the monoterpenes."
11,Conclusions and developments to be implemented,"The industrial method of hydrogen peroxide production using the AQ process could be scaled down to be combined with the lipase mediated epoxidation system making this the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. Safe operating conditions in terms of temperature (45°C for hydrogenation and 25–30°C for oxygenation) and prevention of harmful chemicals such as strong mineral acids and explosive peroxy acids is considered a huge advantage of this process. Moreover, no side product formation of terpenes and corresponding epoxides were observed. The drawback of enzyme grinding poses a great threat to the reusability of the enzymes which can be overcome by the use of our in-house designed “tea-bag” to hold the enzymes and avoid grinding effects and also making the downstream operations simple. However, the major drawback that needs to be solved is the problem of the incomplete conversion of monoterpenes – most likely by further increasing the H2O2 concentration, which should be easily accomplished by further optimization."
