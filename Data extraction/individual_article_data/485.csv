0,Introduction,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of industrial wastewater containing biodegradable organics is considered a sustainable solution, especially in countries with limited conventional fuels resources. Anaerobes can be used to generate hydrogen, ethanol and methane from organic-containing wastewater. Hydrogen is a highly promising biofuel owing to its clean combustion properties and is presently utilized in electric vehicles and power generation. Fermentative hydrogen can be harvested separately through the two-phases AD process of organic wastes; this process consists of a dark fermentation (DF) phase producing hydrogen and acetic acid, followed by a methane-producing phase only from acetic acid biodegradation. Nonetheless, beneficial and affordable hydrogen production (HP) from DF is challenging owing to various limitations such as reactor designs, operational conditions, competitive bacterial consortia, substrate compositions, essential macro- and micronutrients, and low yields (Mota et al., 2018). Currently, several techniques have been developed to optimize HP; however, most techniques focus on its harvesting from common organic compounds such as starch, glucose, sucrose, and proteins. Presently, mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), a common industrial contaminant, is widely used in petrochemical industries to produce aircraft runway deicers, ethylene glycol/oxide, engine coolants, and poly-ethylene terephthalate (PET), and for natural gas extraction (Elreedy et al., 2017a; Mahmoud et al., 2017). MEG is globally classified as hazardous but is biodegradable and can be used for HP (Hassani et al., 2013). Several techniques have been employed for the treatment of MEG-containing wastewater, such as direct and catalytic oxidations, vacuum membrane distillation, nano-filtration, phytoremediation, biological aerobic treatment, and AD process (Elreedy et al., 2017b). However, maximizing the hydrogen yield (HY) from DF of MEG-containing wastewater, through applying the two-phases AD strategy, is crucial to become a significant competitor, from environmental and economic points of view, compared with the common one-phase AD producing solely methane. Recently, enhanced HP has been achieved by supplementing fermentative bacteria with metal nanoparticles (NPs) (Mudhoo et al., 2018). However, it is likely that HP and enhancement mechanism depend on NPs composition, dosage, substrate degradation pathway, and associated enzymes. NPs have unique physical and chemical characteristics. Firstly, metal nanoparticles such as hematite (α-Fe2O3), nickel oxide (NiO), and zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs can release bioavailable metal ions via dissolution in water, even under anaerobic biotic environments (Han et al., 2011; Mu and Chen, 2011; Xu et al., 2019). Further, Han et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2016) identified that NPs can gradually supply appropriate amounts of metal ions, while assessing the role of trace metals on microorganism growth and activity. Thus, the inhibitory effect of excess metal ions can be avoided. The potential toxicity associated with metal ions mainly relies on their speciation and concentration. Elevated doses of metals can: (a) disrupt the enzymes function and structure when binding with thiol group (RSH) or other functional groups, deforming as well as inactivating the protein, and/or replace the natural metals in prosthetic groups, which are coenzymes (Chen et al., 2008), and (b) increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) lowering the bacterial cell viability due to the oxidative stress (Mu and Chen, 2011). Former studies have also confirmed that iron NPs achieved higher HP compared to iron sulfate when tested at the same dosages (Han et al., 2011; Taherdanak et al., 2016). However, Wang et al. (2016) noted considerable increment in HP when 100 mg/gTSS of iron oxide NPs was used, although no release of Fe2+ was observed; this mechanism is based on the use of conductive mineral particles as conduits of electrons by microbes, which has been described as direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) (Tian et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016). This hypothesis was also proposed by Lin et al. (2016a), who found that iron oxide NPs maintained more aggregates of nanowire related proteins, which play a crucial role in electron transfer between cells. Accordingly, HP was enhanced using non-metallic and high electrical conductive supplements such as graphene (Tian et al., 2017), nickel-graphene nanocomposite (Elreedy et al., 2017b), magnetite/graphene oxide nanocomposite (Mostafa et al., 2016) and granular activated carbon (Liu et al., 2012). Thirdly, Lin et al. (2016a) and Yu et al. (2015) reported that small NPs such as ZnO and iron oxide were able to penetrate the microbial cell membrane without causing significant disruption, which was supported by transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM) images. Under such conditions, potential enhancement in intracellular enzyme synthesis, stability, and activity is expected owing to functional ion release from NPs as well as the physical (as attaching surface) and chemical (as electron conduits) uniqueness of NPs (Mcpherson and Vincent, 2014). Eventually, the inhibitory mechanism induced by certain doses of NPs during AD, due to either themselves or released ions, is mainly related to cell membrane penetration and disruption, as discussed by Yang et al. (2013). Iron NPs are widely used as supplements to promote HP as iron constitutes the metal component in active sites and FS clusters of [Fe], [FeFe], and [FeNi] hydrogenase enzymes, which facilitates the release of hydrogen gas (Han et al., 2011). Four common iron-based NPs, namely, Fe3O4 NPs (magnetite), α-Fe2O3 NPs, γ-Fe2O3 NPs (maghemite) and ZVI NPs (zero-valent iron) have been successfully applied for HP. Particularly, hematite NPs achieved higher enhancement and less toxicity compared to other forms (Han et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011). Elreedy et al. (2017b) reported that reactors exposed to iron-based NPs achieved 17–63% improvement in HP using glucose-based substrates. Nickel represents the core structure of [FeNi] hydrogenase, which is widely dispersed among bacteria (Mullai et al., 2013). Nickel NPs, used at lower doses compared to iron NPs, enhanced HP by 16, 23, 23, and 24% with substrates such as dairy and distillery wastewater (Gadhe et al., 2014, 2015a), MEG (Elreedy et al., 2017b), and glucose (Mullai et al., 2013), respectively. Similarly, cultures supplemented with Ni ions enhanced dehydrogenase enzyme activity, associated ethanol production, and growth of relevant bacterial species (Saxena and Tanner, 2011). In contrast to Fe and Ni-based NPs, existing research on the impact of ZnO NPs on biological treatment processes have focused mainly on its toxicity and its potential positive impact has been less investigated. Nonetheless, Chong et al. (2009) highlighted that zinc is as one of the most important elements for HP, besides magnesium, sodium, and iron. Srikanth and Mohan (2012) noted that HY increased by 98% when 12 mg/L of Zn2+ was used. Further, Sarris and Papanikolaou (2016) highlighted the role of zinc as a cofactor for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH); it acts as a catalyst during the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol by recycling NADH to NAD+, a process that occurs in the MEG metabolic pathway. Particularly, zinc-dependent ADHs are the most common enzymes when thermophilic ADHs are orderly classified (Radianingtyas and Wright, 2003). Saxena and Tanner (2011) highlighted that Zn2+ achieved the highest bacterial growth and ethanol production among the trace metal ions tested (Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Mo6+, Ni2+, Zn2+, SeO4−, and WO4−). While previous studies investigated the impact of NPs on fermentative HP, to our knowledge, impacts of individual and multiple amendment of NPs on the hydrogen generation for the treatment of MEG-contaminated wastewater have not been extensively studied. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism of NPs-induced HP enhancement. Therefore, this study assessed the use of α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs as supplements to promote HP from MEG-containing wastewater. The main objective of the research was to study the efficiency of mixed culture bacteria (MCB) incorporated with individual (α-Fe2O3, NiO and ZnO), dual (α-Fe2O3 + NiO, α-Fe2O3 + ZnO, NiO + ZnO), and multi-NPs (α-Fe2O3 + NiO + ZnO). The study emphasized on the influence of supplemented NPs on intermediate metabolites, activity of key enzymes, and microbial community structures. Furthermore, linear regression and principal components analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between relevant intermediates, enzyme activities, and HP."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Mixed culture and substrate compositions,"2.1 Mixed culture and substrate compositions Mixed culture was collected, as thickened sludge, from the gravity thickener in a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Kanto area, Japan. The pH, total solids (TS), and volatile solids (VS) of the collected sludge were 6.8 ± 0.060, 26 ± 0.33 gTS/L and 19 ± 0.42 gVS/L, respectively, resulting in an average VS/TS ratio of 0.73. The harvested sludge was initially acclimatized for four months under anaerobic conditions, and using MEG as the sole carbon source. Further, the sludge was pre-heated at a temperature of 105 °C for 30 min for three times, in this study (i.e., initial stage of acclimatization, one month prior to the experiment, and just before the experiment). This heat-pretreatment strategy, as well as acclimation temperature of 50 °C and pH 5.0–6.0, were recognized to suppress the methanogenesis and harvest spore forming bacteria responsible for HP (O-Thong et al., 2008; Wimonsong et al., 2014). The sludge acclimation was performed based on gradual changes of organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), and sludge retention time (SRT) from 4.0 to 8.0 gCOD/L/d, 24 to 12 h, and 14 to 7.0 d, respectively. The associated feed was a model substrate spiked with MEG (C2H6O2), essential nutrients, buffer and trace elements. The substrate composition was as follows: C2H6O2 (4000 mg/L), NH4Cl (340 mg/L), KH2PO4 (56 mg/L), NaHCO3 (330 mg/L), CoC12·6H2O (1.2 mg/L), FeC13 (5.0 mg/L); CuSO4·5H2O (5.0 mg/L), MgSO4·7H2O (39 mg/L), MnSO4·4H2O (14 mg/L), CaCl2·2H2O (37 mg/L), and ZnC12 (5.0 mg/L) (Gopala Krishna et al., 2008). Eventually, the acclimatized and pretreated MCB was used as the inoculum for subsequent batch experiments."
3,"α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs","2.2 α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs The characteristics of α-Fe2O3, NiO and ZnO NPs were determined. The surface morphology of the powders was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM: VE-9800, KEYENCE; and FE-SEM: JSM-7500F, JEOL). X-ray diffraction (X'Pert-MPD-OES, Philips) patterns were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed using an IR spectrometer (Vertex 70, Bruker Scientific Instruments Ltd.). The detailed characteristics of three nanomaterials used in this study were discussed in the supplementary information (Figs. S1–S3)."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design Two successive batch-mode experiments for fermentative HP from synthetic wastewater containing MEG were conducted (Table 1 ) to assess the efficiency of MCB incorporated with: (1) individual NPs (α-Fe2O3, NiO and ZnO) at different doses; (2) dual NPs namely, α-Fe2O3 + NiO, α-Fe2O3 + ZnO, NiO + ZnO; and (3) multi-NPs, which was α-Fe2O3 + NiO + ZnO. Stock suspensions of α-Fe2O3 NPs (0.80 g), NiO NPs (0.20 g) and ZnO NPs (0.10 g) were separately prepared in 50 mL Milli-Q water, and dispersed by ultrasonication for 1.0 h. Batch experiments were conducted using a series of 250 mL serum bottles with 200 mL working volume and 50 mL headspace. All batches were inoculated with MCB with average VS and MEG concentrations of 10.0 and 4.0 g/L, respectively, resulting in an average substrate-to-biomass ratio (S/X) of 0.50 gCOD/gVS. This mixture was attained by centrifugation (4000×g for 5.0 min) of 100 mL of concentrated MCB (20 gVS/L), and subsequent resuspension in substrate (4 gMEG/L) at a total volume of 200 mL. Initial pH values were adjusted to 5.5 ± 0.070, which is optimal for hydrogen production when using MEG as substrate and mixed culture as inoculum, as reported earlier by Elreedy et al. (2018, 2017a, 2017b). The headspaces of the batch reactors were initially purged with oxygen-free nitrogen (90% N2 and 10% CO2) and capped with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals to avoid air exchange (Wei et al., 2014). The serum bottles were placed in shakers and subsequently moved to an incubator operated at 50 °C. Duplicate tests were conducted to obtain values that represented mean ± standard deviation. The significance of results was assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a confidence level of 95%, which is represented by a probability value (p) < 0.050."
5,Data analysis,"2.4 Data analysis The modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)) (Taherdanak et al., 2016) was used to model the experimental results of biohydrogen production assisted by the addition of α-Fe2O3, NiO and ZnO NPs, individually and in combination. (1) H = P ⋅ exp { - exp [ R m e P ( λ - t ) + 1 ] } where H (mL) is the cumulative volumetric hydrogen production (VHP) at time t (h), P (mL/L) is the hydrogen potential, R m (mL/L/h) is the maximum hydrogen production rate, e = 2.7, and λ (h) is the lag phase period. Furthermore, linear regression analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) were used to describe the relationships between HP, intermediate products, and activities of key enzymes. Linear regression analysis and PCA were performed using SigmaPlot 10 and Minitab 18 software, respectively."
6,Enzymatic activity assays,"2.5 Enzymatic activity assays The activity of hydrogenase (hyd), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes were assessed for all batches including the control. The hyd activity was estimated based on the associated reduction of methylene blue (MB) (Lee et al., 2009). The activities of ADH and ALDH enzymes were colorimetrically measured at the wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate reader (Spectra Fluor, Tecan, UK). ADH and ALDH activity assay kits (Abnova Co.; Catalog Number: KA3713 and KA3742, respectively) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Abnova, 2018). Full description regarding the three enzyme activity assays is shown in the supplementary information."
7,Analytical techniques,"2.6 Analytical techniques Mixed liquor and supernatant samples of 1 mL each were collected from the incubated batches at different time intervals for analyses of biomass and metabolites (after filtration), respectively. The samples were withdrawn using needle syringes, after collecting the produced gas, and then the head space was adjusted to initial conditions using oxygen-free nitrogen. TS and VS in the sludge were analyzed according to APHA (2005). MEG, acetic acid, ethanol, and acetaldehyde were measured using gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with stabilwax column (Restek) and flame ionized detector (FID). The detector was supplied with helium, hydrogen, and air, and operated at flow rates of 4.0, 50, and 300 mL/min, respectively, as described by Carnegie and Ramsay (2009). The temperatures of the injection port and detector were 230 and 250 °C, respectively. The column oven temperature was set at 55 °C for 1.0 min. Subsequently, the temperature was increased at the rate of 20 °C/min with 1.0 min hold, until reaching 215 °C. The volume of hydrogen gas for all batches was measured using the displacement method wherein alkali water (3.0% NaOH, w/v) was used to absorb CO2 and H2S (Zhang et al., 2015). Besides, hydrogen gas content using a displacement method was validated using gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a ShinCarbon column (Restek) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Helium was used as the carrier gas, which was provided at a flow rate of 25 mL/min; the temperatures of the injection port, column oven, and detector were 100, 120, and 150 °C, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene region of bacteria and archaea was used for next generation sequencing analysis, and description of the procedures is shown in the supplementary information."

9,"Efficiency assessment of hydrogen production, metabolism and enzyme activity using MCB individually supplemented with α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs","3.1 Efficiency assessment of hydrogen production, metabolism and enzyme activity using MCB individually supplemented with α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs 3.1.1 α-Fe2O3 NPs addition Fig. 1 a depicts the efficiency of HP from DF of MEG rich wastewater using MCB incorporated with α-Fe2O3. The results revealed that MCB supplemented with 50 mg/L of α-Fe2O3 NPs promoted HP by 20%, compared to the control test. Furthermore, the cumulative volumetric hydrogen production (VHP) substantially increased to 150 ± 9.0 mL/L when α-Fe2O3 NPs dosage was increased to 200 mg/L, resulting in HP improvement of 41%. During the MEG decomposition pathway (Eqs. 2–4 (Trifunović et al., 2016)), higher HP is associated with higher availability of protons (H+), which is correlated to acetic acid production. Consistently, acetic acid substantially increased from 18 ± 1.6 to 26 ± 0.57 mmoL/L when α-Fe2O3 NPs was increased from 0 to 200 mg/L (Fig. S4b, supplementary). Moreover, low levels of ethanol (3.4 ± 0.19 mmoL/L) and acetaldehyde (2.6 ± 0.18 mmoL/L) were registered for MCB supplemented with 200 mg/L of α-Fe2O3, when maximum HP was achieved (Fig. S4, supplementary). Thus, consistent with Eqs. (3)–(5), this finding strongly indicates the sequential conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde to acetic acid and hydrogen. Similarly, Lin et al. (2016a) observed that the addition of 200 mg/L maghemite NPs (γ-Fe2O3) dominantly shifted the ethanol fermentation type to acetic acid production, which was coincided with enhanced HP during the DF of glucose. Comparable results were observed by Gadhe et al. (2015a), Han et al. (2011), and Lin et al. (2016b), wherein addition of 200 mg/L α-Fe2O3 achieved maximum HP from glucose, pretreated cassava starch, and sucrose and distillery wastewater. However, the optimum dose of α-Fe2O3 was 50 mg/L for HP from dairy wastewater, highlighting the impact of substrate composition and associated metabolism (Gadhe et al., 2015b). The main enzymes responsible for MEG metabolism and HP in Eqs. (2)–(5) are: (1) ALDH, which catalyzes the reduction of acetaldehyde to its corresponding carboxylic acid (e.g., acetic acid) (Eq. (3)) (Trifunović et al., 2016), (2) ADH, which catalyzes the reversible conversion between alcohols (e.g., ethanol) and aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde) (Eq. (4)) (Trifunović et al., 2016), and (3) hyd, which stimulates the potential overall redox reaction that gathers electrons derived from NADH and reduced ferredoxin (Fdred), in the presence of protons, to produce hydrogen gas (Eq. (5)) (Schut and Adams, 2009). (2) 2 HOCH2CH2OH (MEG) → 2 CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) + 2 H2O (3) CH3CHO + NAD+ + H2O → CH3COOH (acetic acid) + NADH + H+ (4) CH3CHO + NADH + H+ ↔ CH3CH2OH (ethanol) + NAD+ (5) NADH + 2Fdred + 3H+ ↔ 2H2 + NAD+ + 2Fdox The results shown in Fig. 2 a revealed that hyd activity substantially improved following the addition of α-Fe2O3 NPs (50–400 mg/L). Highest activity was achieved at the dosage of 200 mg/L (160 ± 3.0% compared to the control). This is indeed consistent with the increase in relative abundance of hydrogen-producing bacteria (Fig. 4), in the presence of 200 mg/L α-Fe2O3 NPs. Additionally, iron that is likely released from α-Fe2O3 NPs contributed to hyd enzyme synthesis and activity, as hyd is classified as [FeFe] and [FeNi] hydrogenase (based on enzyme active site) (Han et al., 2011). Zhang et al. (2015) observed that Fe2+ concentration of 300 mg/L enhanced hyd activity notably. Further, ALDH activity was enhanced; it peaked at α-Fe2O3 NPs dosage of 200 mg/L. Similarly, Srikanth and Mohan (2012) proved that dehydrogenase enzymes activity was boosted following the addition of 100 mg/L Fe2+. 3.1.2 NiO NPs addition Fig. 1b shows that MCB supplemented with NiO NPs exhibited better HP compared to non-supplemented cultures. However, HP fluctuated significantly at different doses of NiO NPs; maximum HP was obtained when the MCB was incorporated with 20 mg/L NiO NPs (130 ± 6.0 mL/L and 30% increment compared to the control). This enhancement in HP can be elaborated by the prevalence of acetic acid production pathway, resulting in higher residual value of 24 ± 1.1 mmoL/L, lower ethanol of 5.9 ± 0.74 mmoL/L, and lower acetaldehyde of 2.3 ± 0.13 mmoL/L in the reaction medium (Fig. S5, supplementary). Moreover, ADH, ALDH, and hyd activities improved when the MCB was amended with 10–100 mg/L NiO NPs (Fig. 2b). The highest increments in ADH and hyd activities were 150 ± 10% and 140 ± 9.0%, respectively, at NiO NPs concentration of 20 mg/L. These findings can be ascribed to the essential role of Ni2+ as an active center for several metalloenzymes including [FeNi] hydrogenase and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) (Boer et al., 2014). ACS catalyzes the intermediate conversion of acetyl-CoA (i.e., a crucial metabolite for microbial growth) to acetate, which is sequentially linked to the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetyl-CoA assisted by ALDH (Lian et al., 2012; Trifunović et al., 2016). Meanwhile, substantial increases in relative abundance of Clostridiales and Bacillales compared to the control were observed (Fig. 4), which were previously known to release ADH and ALDH (Radianingtyas and Wright, 2003; Saxena and Tanner, 2011). Moreover, Saxena and Tanner (2011) reported that excess concentration of Ni2+, when the optimum dose was increased by ten-fold, resulted in slight decrease in maximum ADH activity compared to Fe2+(based on standard trace element solution). However, optimum dose of zero-valent nickel NPs (60 mg/L) resulted in 23% improvement in HP (Elreedy et al., 2017b). 3.1.3 ZnO NPs addition HP was enhanced when MCB was supplemented with ZnO NPs; cumulative VHP peaked when 10 mg/L ZnO NPs was incorporated, resulting in 130 ± 12 mL/L and 29% improvement in HP, compared to the control (Fig. 1c). This was consistent with the maximum production of acetic acid (23 ± 1.8 mmoL/L), and minimum levels of residual ethanol (3.4 ± 0.19 mmoL/L) and acetaldehyde (2.6 ± 0.19 mmoL/L) (Fig. S6). This positive metabolic pathway is most likely assisted by the observed increase in ADH (120 ± 6.0%) and ALDH (170 ± 4.0%) compared to control cultures (Fig. 2c). The crucial role of Zn can be related to the involvement in Zn-dependent ADHs, which facilitate the synthesis of coenzyme NAD+ needed for the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde (Radianingtyas and Wright, 2003), resulting in higher proton (H+) availability in the medium. Moreover, the highest growth of hydrogen producers and maximum hyd activity (150 ± 7.0%, relative to the control) were registered when 10 mg/L ZnO NPs was used (Figs. 2c and 4). Comparable results were obtained by Srikanth and Mohan (2012), who found that HY increased significantly from 0.27 to 15 moL/kg CODremoved when Zn2+ was increased from 0 to 12 mg/L. However, Yang et al. (2013) reported that the AD process was inhibited by 18% when 30 mg/gTSS of ZnO NPs was used. Further increments of α-Fe2O3, NiO, or ZnO NPs dosages from 200 to 400, 20 to 100 and 10–50 mg/L, respectively, resulted in decrease s in the improved cumulative VHP compared to the control (27, 17, and 11% progression, respectively). This alleviation is likely due to the inhibitory effect of excess α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs and their released ions in the fermentation medium, which causes cell membrane penetration (Lin et al., 2016a). 3.1.4 Comparison of MCB individually supplemented with optimum doses of α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs Fig. 2 shows that HP from MCB incorporated with 10 mg/L of ZnO NPs was similar to HP from 20 mg/L NiO NPs and lower than HP from 200 mg/L α-Fe2O3 NPs. Meanwhile, Fig. 3 indicates that acetic acid fermentation type was the dominant pathway for MEG metabolism in all MCB incorporated with α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs. However, MEG was found to decrease with time in a similar manner among the tested batches including the control, suggesting that the conversion rate of MEG was not enhanced by NPs treatments. Note that the dehydration of MEG to acetaldehyde (Eq. (2)) is associated with activity of non-metal based enzyme, namely diol dehydratase (Trifunović et al., 2016). Diol hydratase was reported as coenzyme B12-dependent, and no any positive impacts were observed when was supplemented with metals such as K+, Na+, and Mg+ (Schramm and Schink, 1991). Further, MEG dehydration to acetaldehyde is a non-redox reaction, which is not likely affected when exposed to electron conduits such as metal NPs. The concurrent release of sequential metabolites along the MEG degradation period of 48 h, starting with acetaldehyde, also indicates its rate-limiting level. Afterwards, for the control, the higher residual acetaldehyde implies a slower conversion rate compared with the treatments with NPs where the high improvements were observed in ALDH activity (Fig. 2). The acetaldehyde concentration had a peak in the control, after 6.0 h (10 ± 1.1 mmoL/L) and 24 h incubation (7.5 ± 0.71 mmoL/L), and high MEG concentration still remained (Fig. 3). Maximum residual ethanol of 8.8 ± 0.30 mmoL/L was also observed in the control batch. In contrast, residual ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations, at optimum α-Fe2O3, NiO and ZnO NPs doses, peaked at fermentation time of 48 h and these concentrations were less than 5.9 ± 0.74 and 3.6 ± 0.21 mmoL/L, respectively, which were achieved at optimum α-Fe2O3 NPs. The results were corresponded with higher ADH and ALDH enzymes activities at optimum doses of NiO (20 mg/L) and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L) (Fig. 2). These findings indicated the higher production of acetic acid along with lower residual acetaldehyde and ethanol in the NPs-treated batches, particularly during the first 48 h incubation (Fig. 3). Figure S7 (supplementary) shows that maximum HPR was achieved at fermentation time of 6 h for MCB incorporated with α-Fe2O3 (200 mg/L), NiO (20 mg/L), and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L). However, α-Fe2O3 NPs achieved higher HPR of 13 ± 0.92 mL/L/h compared to NiO NPs (9.8 ± 0.50 mL/L/h), ZnO NPs (10 ± 1.3 mL/L/h), and control cultures (7.3 ± 0.59 mL/L/h). The maximum HPR using α-Fe2O3 NPs was highly correlated with the highest acetic acid/ethanol (HAc/EtOH) ratio (15), confirming higher conversion of ethanol. HAc/EtOH ratio gradually dropped until the 48 h incubation along with an increase in acetic acid/acetaldehyde (HAc/Acet) ratio, which indicates an increase in the conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol (Eq. (4)). The increase in HAc/EtOH and HAc/Acet ratios, after 48 h incubation corresponded to an increase in the VHP, while insignificant HP was observed for the control. These findings indicate that NPs had a continuous and positive impact on intermediate reactions. Similarly, Elreedy et al. (2017b) indicated that maximum HP, which coincided with the highest HAc/EtOH value of 10, was achieved when a supplement of zero-valent nickel NPs was used on MEG substrate. Overall, the optimum dose of supplemented NPs needed to maintain maximum HP depends on its composition. This observation can be attributed to the variation in their positive and negative impacts on hydrogen gas release, enzyme activity, and metabolic response, as aforementioned. For instance, Yang et al. (2013) reported that iron NPs recorded lower ion release rate especially at low pH values, as well as higher affinity to aggregate, compared to zinc and silver NPs, which can explain their lower inhibitory effect at higher doses. Furthermore, the potential role of NPs on DIET as electron conduits can be of interest. The electrical conductivity of elements used in this study are different; the superior conductor is zinc, followed by nickel, and iron. The electrical conductivity of metal NPs are also suggested by Wang et al. (2016), and they noted substantial improvement in biogas production when iron oxide NPs were used (though the release of Fe2+ ions was negligible). Hence, the outperformance of α-Fe2O3 NPs could be ascribed to the iron's superior role to enhance hyd activity as well as their role as electron conduits, particularly due to the maintained safe exposure to higher doses compared with NiO and ZnO NPs. 3.1.5 Impacts on microbial community structure The microbial community structures of the culture were investigated using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing for MCB supplied with α-Fe2O3 (200 mg/L), NiO (20 mg/L) and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L), and control MCB after fermentation time of 24 h. The relative abundance of dominant microbial order level is shown in Fig. 4a. The relative abundance of Clostridiales (class: Clostridia) for MCB incorporated with α-Fe2O3 (200 mg/L), NiO (20 mg/L) and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L) increased from 10% in the control to 16, 18, and 19%, respectively. Clostridia is known to be the main hydrogen producer in the fermentation process under both mesophilic (Fang et al., 2002; Gagliano et al., 2017) and thermophilic conditions (Akutsu et al., 2008). Among others, genus Clostridium (order: Clostridiales; family: Clostridiaceae) is a key hydrogen-producing bacteria; several studies have investigated its hydrogen productivity (Li and Liu, 2012). In the present study, 83–92% of Clostridiales belonged to Clostridiaceae in all tested batches (Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the addition of α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs, under thermophilic fermentation conditions improved the HY, possibly due to the acceleration of growth and metabolism of Clostridiaceae. Similarly, Hendriks et al. (2018) reported that trace elements significantly influence the growth and metabolism of Clostridium, particularly under thermophilic anaerobic conditions. Further, order OPB95 (belonging to candidate phylum OP8) was abundant in all tested cultures (Fig. 4a). OPB-related consortium is widespread under thermophilic conditions and plays a significant role in the acidification process (Ma et al., 2017). However, the relative abundance of Thermoanaerobacterales decreased from 9.0% in the control to 4.0, 4.0, and 5.0% when the MCB was supplied with α-Fe2O3 (200 mg/L), NiO (20 mg/L), and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L), respectively (Fig. 4a). Nonetheless, the evidence that Thermoanaerobacterales forms ethanol from acetaldehyde using ADH enzyme (Onyenwoke and Juergen, 2015) is consistent with the high ethanol production and acetaldehyde consumption after 24 h incubation in the control cultures resulting in lower HP, compared to other batches supplemented with α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs."
10,"Efficiency assessment of hydrogen production, metabolism, and enzyme activity using MCB supplemented with optimum doses of dual and multi-NPs","3.2 Efficiency assessment of hydrogen production, metabolism, and enzyme activity using MCB supplemented with optimum doses of dual and multi-NPs The results depicted in Fig. 5 indicate that MCB supplemented with dual (α-Fe2O3 + NiO), (α-Fe2O3 + ZnO), (NiO + ZnO) and multi-NPs significantly enhanced HP by 42, 41, 46, and 48%, respectively, compared to the control. These increments were higher than increments caused by individual addition of NPs. Maximum cumulative VHP of 150 ± 9.0 mL/L was achieved when multi-NPs were used. This can be attributed to higher production of acetic acid (26 ± 1.6 mmoL/L) in the medium (Fig. 5). Similarly, addition of the dual NPs (NiO + ZnO) promoted HP by 12% and 13% compared to individual NiO and ZnO NPs, respectively. Lower levels of residual ethanol (2.2–3.3 mmoL/L) and acetaldehyde (2.4–2.8 mmoL/L) were maintained when dual and multi-NPs were used, compared to individual NPs, suggesting the higher conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, and then to acetic acid with concurrent release of hydrogen (Eqs. (3) and (4)). Further, HPR obtained by the addition of dual and multi-NPs exhibited trends similar to individual NPs (Fig. S8, supplementary). Maximum HPR of 13 ± 0.80 mL/L/h was achieved when MCB incorporated with multi-NPs was used, which represented 1.8-fold increase compared to the control. Dual and multi-NPs exhibited higher HAc/EtOH and HAc/Acet ratios compared to individuals and control, which highlights their impact on the relevant enzymes, including enzymes that convert ethanol into acetaldehyde such as ADH, as shown in Fig. 6 . High conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde after fermentation time of 48 h was particularly evident when multi-NPs were used; this could be assisted by low pH values (∼4.5–5.0), which render the environment favourable for ethanol metabolism (Elreedy et al., 2017b; Eskicioglu et al., 2017). Moreover, a COD mass balance based on equivalent COD of MEG and associated metabolites as well as produced hydrogen, at different fermentation times, is shown in Table S1 (supplementary). A comparison of the effects of individual, dual, and multiple additions of α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs on HP and enzymes activity, is illustrated in Fig. 6. Significant improvements in ADH, ALDH, and hyd enzyme activities were achieved for dual and multi-NPs. Firstly, dual and multi-NPs mainly enhanced ADH activity that was seen in the single treatment with α-Fe2O3 NPs, emphasizing that NiO and ZnO NPs played a role in the enhancement of ADH activity. Moreover, the maximum increment in ADH activity of 140 ± 9.0% was achieved when using single treatment with NiO NPs. Secondly, MCB incorporated with individual, dual, and multi-NPs produced substantial increments in ALDH activity (ranging from 150 ± 8.0 to 180 ± 7.0%). This finding is consistent with the high residual acetaldehyde concentration in the control culture after 6.0 h fermentation time, when maximum HPR was attained. Thirdly, the results in Fig. 6d revealed that significant enhancement in hyd activity (ranging from 170 ± 6.0 to 170 ± 9.0%) was obtained when MCB supplied with dual and multi-NPs were used. Multi-NPs substantially promoted hyd activity by 17% and 10% compared to individual NiO and ZnO NPs, respectively; however, this promotion from multi-NPs was only by 4.0% compared to individual α-Fe2O3 NPs. This finding confirms the superior role of α-Fe2O3 NPs in the enhancement of hyd activity and corresponding HP. Moreover, Fig. 6 shows that MCB supplemented with NiO + ZnO dual NPs improved hyd activity by 16% and 10% compared to individual NiO and ZnO NPs, respectively. Meanwhile, comparable performance to α-Fe2O3 NPs (200 mg/L) treatment could be attained when combining lower doses of NiO and ZnO NPs (20 and 10 mg/L, respectively), which might be beneficial from economic point of view. The modified Gompertz model was successfully applied to the observed data profile of cumulative VHP, as depicted in Table 2 . The model was fitted to the experimental results with high correlation coefficients (R2 ranging from 0.96 to 0.99). The addition of NPs decreased the lag phase period (0.31–0.49 h) compared with the control (0.61 h), suggesting the positive effect on fermentation process. The positive impact of NPs on the relative abundance of hydrogen-producing bacteria (Fig. 4) may be relevant to the reduction of the lag phase period, as reported by Taherdanak et al. (2016). The Rm peaked at optimum α-Fe2O3, NiO and ZnO NPs dosages of 200, 20, and 10 mg/L achieving 14, 12, and 13 mL/L/h, respectively, compared to 8.0 mL/L/h for the control. Correspondingly, HY was maximized to 37 ± 2.5, 34 ± 2.5, and 33 ± 3.2 mL/g MEG (i.e., 47 ± 3.2, 43 ± 2.6, and 43 ± 4.1 mL/g COD, respectively) for MCB supplemented with α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs, respectively. However, the highest Rm of 14 mL/L/h was recorded when MCB incorporated with multi-NPs was used. Final pH values at the end of incubation dropped to a range of 4.3 ± 0.060 to 4.6 ± 0.040 without substantial difference between different supplements or dosage, most likely due to the accumulation of acetic acid. Consequently, promotion of fermentative HP using MCB incorporated with individual and multiple α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs was found to be dosage- and composition-dependent. α-Fe2O3 NPs was the best individual supplement; only slight improvements in HP were noted when α-Fe2O3 was used in dual or multiple combination with other NPs. Combination of α-Fe2O3 (200 mg/L) with NiO (20 mg/L) and/or ZnO NPs (10 mg/L) significantly enhanced HP compared to their individual use, mainly due to its high influence on hyd activity and relatively higher optimum dose. In addition, the dual addition of NiO (20 mg/L) and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L) substantially promoted HP and hyd enzyme activity compared to individual NiO and ZnO NPs."
11,Linear regression and principal components analyses,"3.3 Linear regression and principal components analyses Linear regression analysis was conducted and correlation coefficients were obtained at a confidence level of 95% (Figs. 7 and 8 , and Table S2, supplementary). PCA was also conducted to assess multiple variables considering all designed batch reactors. Fig. S9a (supplementary) shows that the first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) demonstrated nearly 94% variance in the data obtained. The results confirm that HP was significantly correlated with residual acetic acid (p < 0.00010) and ethanol (p = 0.00080) with the latter correlation being in a reverse manner. Strong positive correlation was obtained between ethanol and acetic acid (p = 0.00020). Acetaldehyde exhibited insignificant correlation with HP (p = 0.39), which can be attributed to its potential conversion to acetic acid or ethanol. Based on the effect of NPs dosages, α-Fe2O3 NPs registered maximum variations compared to the control. Maximum HPR and hyd activity were highly correlated (p = 0.0041), whereas insignificant associations of HPR with ADH and ALDH activities were noted due possibly to the involvement of reversible redox reaction towards ethanol formation (Fig. 8). Significant correlation between ADH and ALDH activity was observed (p = 0.0017), which can be explained by the potential exchange between two forms of the essential coenzyme (i.e., NAD+ and NADH) (Eqs. (3) and (4)). The PCA among the maximum HPR and corresponding ADH, ALDH, and hyd enzyme activities showed that both PC1 and PC2 achieved total variance of ∼87% (Fig. S9b, supplementary). Both regression analysis and PCA confirmed the positive impacts of individual, dual, and multi-NPs, and the proposed pathway of metabolite products and correlations between related enzyme activities."
12,Conclusions,"MCB incorporated with α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs, individually and in combination, substantially promoted HP from synthetic industrial wastewater containing MEG. Maximum HY values of 37 ± 2.5, 34 ± 2.0, and 33 ± 3.2 mL/g MEG were obtained for MCB supplemented with 200, 20, and 10 mg/L of α-Fe2O3, NiO, and ZnO NPs, respectively, compared to 26 ± 2.1 mL/g MEG for the control cultures. The results highlight the potential use of ZnO NPs in the anaerobic fermentation process. Moreover, higher and lower abundance of hydrogen-producing (Clostridiales) and ethanol-forming microbes (Thermoanaerobacterales), respectively, were ascribed to NPs addition. HP was further improved when MCB was incorporated with dual and multi-NPs, resulting in maximum improvements of 13% and 14% compared to individual NiO and ZnO NPs, respectively. ADH, ALDH, and hyd enzymes were significantly enhanced when MCB supplemented with NPs were used. Significant correlations (p < 0.050) were found between HP with metabolite products (i.e., acetic acid and ethanol), and hyd enzyme activity."
