0,Introduction,"Recently, biological routes of H2 production especially by dark-fermentative process utilizing wastewaters as renewable resource are gaining importance [1–5]. Utilization of cheaper sources like wastewater with a considerable amount of biodegradable organic fraction makes the H2 production process sustainable as wastewater is available in abundant quantity and its treatment is a prerequisite. This process permits dual benefits like renewable energy generation utilizing wastewater and wastewater treatment. Optimization of parameters which influence the process are to be evaluated prior to development of a sustainable fermentative H2 production process practically [6–8]. Among the process parameters, reactor configuration is one of the important aspects which influence the overall performance of H2 production process apart from wastewater treatment. Reactor configuration will have direct influence on the reactor microenvironment viz., microbial population, hydrodynamic behavior, substrate–consortia contact, etc [9,10]. Thus biofilm reactor and suspended growth reactor having their distinct advantages and disadvantages are evaluated for fermentative H2 production from anaerobic wastewater treatment using mixed anaerobic consortia. The experimental studies were performed in periodic discontinuous batch mode operation at organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.4Kg COD/m3-day employing anaerobic mixed consortia at acidophilic feeding pH."
1,Experimental,
2,Bioreactors configuration,"2.1 Bioreactors configuration Experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of biofilm (fixed film) and suspended growth reactor configuration on fermentative H2 production and wastewater treatment (Table 1 ). Bench scale anaerobic reactors made of ‘perplex’ material having working volume of 1.8l, liquid volume of 1.5l and gas holding capacity of 0.3l were fabricated in the laboratory (Fig. 1 ). The biofilm reactor was designed to operate in the upflow mode (L/D ratio∼9.7) with inert stone chips (0.02cm×0.05cm; void ratio∼0.54) used as packing material for fixed bed to support the growth of anaerobic mixed microflora. The bioreactors were fabricated using leak proof sealing along with proper inlet and outlet arrangements. The bioreactors were operated in fed-batch mode [periodic discontinuous fed-batch (PDBR)/sequencing fed-batch (SBR)] with a total cycle period (hydraulic retention time) of 24h. In PDBR mode operation single cycle period consists of 15min of FILL, 23h of REACT, 30min of SETTLE and 15min of DECANT phases. Liquid in the reactor was kept in suspension by circulating it in a closed loop to achieve a homogeneous distribution of the substrate and consortia along the reactor depth [specifically during REACT phase]. Peristaltic pumps integrated with preprogrammed electronic timer were used to regulate the FEED, recirculation and DECANT operations."
3,Operation,"2.2 Operation Anaerobic microflora used in this study was obtained from anaerobic suspended growth reactor treating domestic sewage. Prior to use, the seed inoculum was sieved to remove the stone, sand and other coarse matter. Parent inoculum was not pretreated to verify the natural capability of the anaerobic mixed culture towards fermentative H2 production. The initial pH of the sludge was 7.3 (1:10) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were found to be 27.82g/l. The bioreactors after inoculation with anaerobic culture were initially operated with designed synthetic wastewater [(mg/l) sucrose 3000; NH4Cl 500; K2HPO4 250; KH2PO4 250; CaCl2 5; MgCl2 300; FeCl3 25; CoCl2 25; MnCl2 15; NiSO4 16; CuCl2 10; ZnCl2 10] as feed at organic loading rate (OLR; 1.8kg COD/m3-day; 34 days) after adjusting pH to 7 to support the biofilm formation on the packing medium and to facilitate adaptation in suspended growth reactor. Constant COD removal and gas production (±5% variation) were considered as indicators for successful reactor operation. Subsequently reactors were shifted to higher OLR (3.4kg COD/m3-day) after adjusting pH to 6.0 till stable performance was attained in all the experimental variations studied. Molecular H2 production was evaluated with fed-batch operation at acidophilic condition [pH 6; 27 days (biofilm); 24 days (suspended growth)]. The influent pH was adjusted 6.0, before feeding the wastewater using orthophosphoric acid (88%) or 1M NaOH. After feeding wastewater, the reactor was sparged with oxygen free nitrogen gas for 2min to remove possible oxygen accumulated in the headspace of the reactors to ensure complete anaerobic conditions. All experiments were performed at mesophilic (room) temperature (28±2°C)."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis H2 gas generated during experiments was estimated using a microprocessor based pre-calibrated electrochemical H2 sensor (ATMI GmBH Inc., Germany). Volatile suspended solids (VSS), pH/Oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), volatile fatty acids (VFA) and COD (closed dichromate refluxing method) were determined according to the standard methods [11]. ORP and pH values were determined by a pH meter (Model 20, Denver instruments Ltd.). The separation and quantitative estimation of soluble metabolites (VFA) were carried out by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu LC10A) employing optimized conditions UV–vis detector; C18 column - reverse phase column - 250×4.6mm and 5μ particle size; flow rate - 0.5ml/h; wave length - 210nm; mobile phase - 40% of acetonitrile in 1mN H2SO4 (pH 2.5–3.0; sample injection - 20μl). The biofilm and virgin stone were subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-3000N) after fixing in glutaraldehyde [2.5% in 0.05M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2; 24h; 4°C] followed by dehydration in a series of graded alcohol. Post fixation was done using aqueous osmium tetroxide (2%) in same buffer for 2h and dried prior to scanning."
5,Results,
6,Biohydrogen production,"3.1 Biohydrogen production Fig. 2a illustrates H2 production profiles observed during the experimental variations studied. It is apparent from the experimental data that the adapted reactor configuration has shown significant influence on both H2 production and substrate removal. Initially H2 production was relatively low irrespective of the reactor configuration. A gradual improvement in H2 production was observed with time. In both the reactor configurations maximum H2 production was achieved in significantly less time (15 days). Marked reduction in the time taken for maximum production might be attributed to the function of prevailing acidophilic microenvironment which stimulated acidogenic bacterial activity. Interestingly these observations correlated well with the VFA variation observed during the experiment. In the case of biofilm configuration, H2 production rate was found to be 0.0292mmol/min after 1h of operation followed by steady increase till 0.0463mmol/min at 12h [0.0244mmol at 2h; 0.341mmol at 4h; 0.0439mmol/min 8h]. Almost zero production was observed at the end of cycle period. Cumulative H2 of 28.98mmol H2/day was observed with SHP of 6.97mmol H2/day-g CODL (19.32mmol H2/day-g CODR). In the case of suspended growth configuration, H2 production rate was found to be 0.0219mmol/min after 1h of operation followed by steady increase till 0.3416mmol/min at 8h [0.0244mmol/min at 2h; 0.292mmol/min at 4h] followed by a gradual decrease to 0.0268mmol/min at 12h. Cumulative H2 of 20.93mmol H2/day was observed with SHP of 5.03mmol H2/day-g CODL (16.10mmol H2/day-g CODR). Experimental data illustrated positive influence of biofilm configuration on H2 production compared to the suspended growth configuration (Fig. 2b). In the case of biofilm configuration H2 production decreased after 12h of operation while in case of suspended growth reactor configuration H2 production decreased after 8h of cycle operation. H2 production was almost zero at the end of the cycle period in both the reactors. Fed-batch system oscillates between feast and famine conditions during cycle operation thus substrate concentration reduces at the end of cycle period (famine) resulting in reduced metabolic activity leading to cessation in H2 production."
7,Wastewater treatment,3.2 Wastewater treatment The experimental data depicted an interesting correlation between H2 production and substrate removal (Table 2 ). Maximum COD removal efficiency of 36% and 31% was observed for biofilm and suspended growth reactor operations on 24th and 21st day (Fig. 2c) accounting for an SDR of 1.25Kg COD/m3-day and 1.08Kg COD/m3-day respectively. It is also interesting to note that biofilm and suspended growth experiments resulted in rapid attainment of substrate removal and H2 production within relatively less time (15 days). This could be attributed to soluble metabolic intermediates generated in acidogenic process resulting in sharp decrease in the system pH retarding the activity of a group of anaerobic bacteria. COD removal pattern with the function of single cycle operation is depicted in Fig. 2d. A steady increase in substrate removal was observed from first hour (2%) till the twenty-fourth hour (36%) in biofilm reactor while a decreased performance in substrate removal from first hour (4%) till the twenty-fourth hour (31.3%) was observed in suspended growth reactor. The increased efficiency of substrate removal in biofilm reactor when compared to the suspended growth reactor can be attributed to the effective mass transfer between the bacteria and the wastewater in biofilm configuration compared to the suspended growth configuration. Uniform distribution of substrate in biofilm when compared to the suspended growth reactor can be attributed to effective substrate removal. Non-production of H2 in the terminal hours in spite of substrate degradation can be reasoned for the non-availability of VFAs responsible for H2 production which has been substantiated in the results obtained by the VFA composition analysis during this experiment.
8,pH,"3.3 pH Optimum pH range for the functioning of acidogenic bacteria (AB) was reported well below 6.0, while the functioning of methanogenic bacteria (MB) was good in the range of 6.0–7.5 [4,12,13]. By maintaining the pH around 5.5–6.0 compared to a near neutral pH the conversion efficiency (of fermentative H2 production) can be increased [13,14]. VFA and pH are integral expressions of the acid–base conditions of any anaerobic process as well as intrinsic index of the balance between two of the most important microbial groups viz., AB and MB. Fig. 3a,b illustrate the pattern of outlet pH and VFA produced during the reactor operation. Outlet pH varied in a specific acidophilic pH range during the operation [biofilm (4.03–6.0), suspended growth (4.0–6.0)]. Rapid shift towards acidification [decrease in pH by 1.40 (3 day) and 2.02 (12 day)] was observed in the case of suspended growth operation. However, comparatively higher acidification [decrease in pH by 1.70 (3 day) and 2.10 (21 day)] was registered with biofilm configuration. Acidification in reactor microenvironment is generally considered as an index of VFA generation [15]. Accumulation of acids was significant in the experiments studied resulting in a sharp drop in the outlet pH. In terms of cycle operation (biofilm/suspended growth), system pH showed a marked decline with time. The observed pH drop during H2 production was considered to be favorable microenvironment for effective H2 production by inhibiting the MB. The initial pH values of ‘6.0–7.0’ and ‘5.5–7.5’ may represent the optimum and acceptable ranges of pH for H2 production, whereas the H2 yield dropped sharply at pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 7.5. However, pH below 6 had shown considerable negative influence on the substrate degradation efficiency due to the inhibition of MB in the acidogenic process. controlling pH could stimulate the microorganisms to achieve maximum H2 production because the activity of hydrogenase was inhibited by low or high pH [16]."
9,Soluble metabolites,"3.4 Soluble metabolites Fermentative process is generally associated with acid and solvent generation as metabolic intermediates due to the acidogenic metabolism. VFA production is associated with the conversion of organic fraction to acid intermediates in the acidogenic microenvironment with the help of specific group of anaerobic bacteria [17]. Marked variation in VFA concentration was observed during reactor operation with the function of experimental variation studied [biofilm - 4450±350mg/l; suspended growth (2365±315mg/l)] (Fig. 3c,d). VFA concentration was relatively higher in biofilm operation over the corresponding suspended growth operation and corroborates well with the H2 production data. Higher concentration of soluble metabolite production was observed during the initial hours of the cycle operation irrespective of the experimental variations studied (Table 3 ). VFA concentration showed a steady increase with time prior to stabilization at the end of the cycle period (Fig. 3d). Increase in VFA concentration during H2 production enumerated the effective functioning of the acidogenic metabolic process and is analogous with the corresponding H2 production data. The analysis of soluble metabolic products was carried out by chromatography for the determination of acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu) and propionic acid (HPr) as they play a vital role in fermentative H2 production. The distribution of soluble metabolites formed during fermentative H2 generation was often considered as a crucial signal in understanding the metabolic pathway [17]. In general, production of HAc and HBu favors the production of H2, while production of HPr consumes H2 [18]. Determination of the composition of VFA by chromatography revealed the presence of acetate, butyrate, and propionate (Table 3). Higher concentration of HAc and lower concentration of HBu and HPr were observed irrespective of the reactor configuration employed. Generation of higher concentration of acetate associated with lower concentrations of butyrate and propionate signifies favorable microenvironment for acidogenic activity [19]. The pattern of the distribution of metabolites indicated the dominance of acidogenic (formation of acetic acid) metabolic pathway which is considered as optimum microenvironment for effective H2 production. Decline in HAc concentration during final phase of cycle operation corroborated well with lower H2 production observed. Presence of HPr in the absence of HAc during end of the cycle period might be reasoned for the observed zero production of H2. In anaerobic process accumulation of HPr results in low efficiency of the methanogenic phase due to the low acetogenic rate of HPr, and hence low wastewater treatment efficiency [20]. Although HAc dominated in both biofilm and suspended growth operations, volumetrically the dominance of VFA was quite high in biofilm configuration (by 6.5 folds). This can be considered as a clear marker for effective H2 production observed in the biofilm configured system."
10,Discussions,"Reactor configuration, during H2 production, was considered as a process controlling factor in this study. It governs the performance of any open engineering system. Reactor configuration adapted in this study showed considerable influence on both the H2 production and substrate degradation. It is evident from the study that the attached growth/biofilm configuration resulted in enhanced H2 production over the corresponding suspended growth experiments. SEM images (×2.5K) of anaerobic consortia obtained from both the reactors (biofilm and suspended growth) apparently did not reveal much difference in the type of bacteria residing in the reactor. The comparable biomass can be reasoned for the common source of the anaerobic inoculum used during the start up of the reactors. Images of rod-shaped bacteria predominated the surface of the stone in biofilm (Fig. 4 a,b) and the suspended growth reactor (Fig. 4d). SEM image of the virgin stone used in biofilm reactor as support is also depicted in Fig. 4c and d. Self-immobilization of selectively enriched consortia (biocatalyst) generally improves the bioactivity. In this case acidogenic metabolic pathway is stimulated leading to enhanced process efficiency in terms of H2 production and substrate degradation especially at higher loading rates. Attached biofilm systems act as buffer to reduce the concentration of toxic chemicals during process operation thereby providing advantage for the treatment of low-biodegradable wastewater [21]. Further biofilm systems enhance the survival of microorganisms [22] and protect the cells from the environmental toxicity [23] and from predation of other organisms [24]. They are more resistant to change in the process parameters and are less energy intensive [25]. This is particularly useful where high hydraulic loading variations occur and where slowly growing organisms with special metabolic capacities are to be protected from washout [14,26–29]. Bacteria achieve maximum growth rates throughout the biofilm resulting in improved reaction potential leading to stable and robust system which are well suited for treating highly variable wastes and have greater potential for cell-to-cell contact due to the presence of high cell density and thus helping in transforming genetic information required for effective performance and H2 production [14,27,29]. Periodic discontinuous process coupled with biofilm configuration combines dual operational advantages and helps to maintain high biomass concentration, encourages the culture of slow growing organisms and can obtain homogeneous biomass distribution leading to improved reaction potential for a stable and robust system which is well suited for treating highly variable wastewater [30,31]. During fed-batch operation, reactor microenvironment periodically oscillates between feast and famine conditions once per cycle leading to instantaneous higher F/M ratios which result in modified growth of consortia [32]. Poor biomass retention/cell washout generally observed in suspended growth operation can be restrained in biofilm reactor configuration which facilitates effective retention of biomass from the reactor even under high organic loading and hydraulic pressure [33], making them more resistant to shock loads [25]. Further, selection of effective biomass is possible in biofilm which reacts more actively under stressful environment in comparison to suspension form [34–36]."
11,Conclusions,"Experimental data depicted marked influence of reactor configuration on both fermentative H2 production and substrate degradation (wastewater treatment). Experimental data documented that enhanced biohydrogen production is possible by attached growth of the mixed microflora. Biofilm configuration showed effective performance in terms of both H2 production and substrate degradation over the corresponding suspended growth configuration. Relatively, higher concentration of volatile fatty acids production was observed in biofilm reactor. Higher concentration of acetate was observed in both the configurations studied which may be attributed to the acid-forming metabolic microenvironment. Self-immobilization of mixed consortia leading to attached growth in biofilm reactor improved the bioactivity of acidogenic metabolic pathway leading to enhanced process efficiency."
