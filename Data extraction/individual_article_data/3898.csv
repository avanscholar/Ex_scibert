0,Introduction,"Supported metal catalysts, normally consisting of metal nanoparticles (NPs) supported on solids, are widely used in various industrial chemical reactions [1,2]. The employed supports and preparing methods of the catalysts have significant effects on the catalytic performances of the supported catalysts, which affected not only the characteristics of the supported metal NPs, such as size, crystal facet and electronic structure, but also the catalytic process via the interaction with metal NPs [3–6]. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of layered inorganic materials composed of positively charged two-dimensional (2D) layers with interlayer charge compensating anions and water molecules. Their unique properties, such as tunable acidity, basicity, chemical composition of inorganic layers and interlayer gallery anions, make LDHs a kind of promising support in preparation of supported catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis [7–9]. As a typical hydroxide support, metal active species can be supported on LDHs by traditional methods, such as impregnation [10], precipitation-deposition [11] or by utilizing electrostatic interaction to introduce metal complex into the interlayers of LDHs [12,13]. The different ways of introducing metals may result in the disparity of metal/LDHs interface structures and therefore the catalytic performances [14]. Wet impregnation method is the most commonly used method for preparing metal supported catalysts, but this method typically produces a broad range of particle sizes and is poor in control of metal dispersion and speciation. In contrast, sol-immobilization technique can facilitate the control of supported metal sizes and morphology [15]. Preparation of supported metal catalysts by sol-immobilization usually involves the following steps: the formation of colloidal metal NPs with a well-defined particle size by utilizing a stabilizing agent such as PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) or PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) to control the growth of the NPs; reducing the metal using a reducing agent such as NaBH4; immobilizing metal NPs on the support by adding the support into the colloidal [16,17]. In the process of catalyst preparation whether utilizing wet impregnation or sol-immobilization technique, the solvents used to dissolve metal precursors or to prepare metal colloidal significantly affect the dispersion of metal NPs on the support and the interaction between metal and support, resulting in the prepared catalysts with the different performances. Some works on the influence of impregnation solvents on supported metal catalysts have been reported. For instance, Zhang et al. investigated the promotional effects of solvent during the preparing FTS (Fischer-Tropsch synthesis) catalysts and found that impregnation solvent could modify the surface properties of silica support, resulting in the supported cobalt catalyst with a high Co dispersion and reduction degree and good activity and stability [18]. Lucredio et al. found Co/SiO2 catalysts prepared using methanol as the impregnation solvent had smaller metal crystallites and showed high CO, H2 CO2 selectivity in steam reforming of ethanol than those prepared using water [19]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the study on the effect of colloidal solvent on supported metal catalysts is rarely reported, especially for LDH supported metal catalysts. Aldehydes are crucial raw materials in the production of fine chemicals and valuable intermediates, and the selective oxidation of alcohol is one of the most important transformation routes for obtaining the corresponding aldehydes [20]. Compared with the traditional oxidation process, involving using toxic and expensive stoichiometric oxidants (eg. dichromate, permanganate), the oxidation process with O2 as the only oxidant in the presence of heterogeneous catalyst has received extensive interest due to its economic and environmental advantages [21,22]. A large number of heterogeneous catalysts based on noble metal (Au, Pt, Pd, etc) and transition metals (Ni, Mn, etc) have been developed for this process [22]. Among the various metal-based catalysts, Pd-based catalysts attract more attention due to their high activity and selectivity [23–30]. In this work, LDHs supported Pd samples were prepared by sol-immobilization in two green and eco-friendly solvents, water and ethanol, and for comparison, Pd/LDH samples were also prepared by impregnation. As expected, the solvents and the methods of loading Pd NPs on LDH support indeed influenced the catalytic performances of the prepared Pd/LDH samples in solvent-free selective oxidation of alcohol with O2. Specifically, in the case of ethanol as the colloidal solvent, the Pd/LDH sample prepared by sol-immobilization gave higher activity than the corresponding samples prepared in the case of water as the colloidal solvent. In addition, Pd/LDH samples prepared by sol-immobilization showed higher catalytic activity than those prepared by impregnation. This work provides an alternative and efficient route to improve the catalytic performances of the LDH supported catalysts via adjusting the solvents and methods of supporting metal NPs on LDHs."
1,Experimental,All the materials were A.R. grade and used without further purification.
2,Preparation of LDH,"2.1 Preparation of LDH LDH support was synthesized by co-precipitation following the procedures described in Ref. [29] with some modifications. Typically, 100 mL of aqueous solution of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (30 mmol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (10 mmol) was dropped into 100 mL of Na2CO3 solution under vigorous stirring. The pH of the mixture was maintained at 11 by 1.5 M NaOH solution. The resultant gel-like slurry was stirred at room temperature for 10 min and then aged at 120 °C for 24 h. After filtration, the obtained solid was washed with deionized decarbonated water (DD water) until neutral, and then the white slurry was washed by acetone several times and dried at 80 °C overnight. The obtained sample was denoted as LDH."
3,Preparation of Pd/LDH,"2.2 Preparation of Pd/LDH 2.2.1 Sol-immobilization method Sol-immobilization method was carried out according to the procedures described in the reference [29] with some modifications. First, a certain amount of PVP (K30, PVP/metal (wt/wt) = 1.2) was added to the ethanol solution of Na2PdCl4 (5 mL, 0.015 M). Second, a freshly prepared ethanol solution of NaBH4 (0.1 M, NaBH4/metal (mol/mol) = 5) was added to it, and a dark-brown sol was obtained after 30 min. Third, 1 g of LDH support was added to the above sol, and the slurry was vigorously stirred for 1 h. Finally, the slurry was filtered and the solid was washed thoroughly with ethanol and dried under vacuum. The obtained sample was denoted as Sol-Pd/LDH-Et. The corresponding Sol-Pd/LDH-Aq was prepared by following the same procedures just by using water instead of ethanol as the solvent. The Pd amounts in Sol-Pd/LDH-Et, and Sol-Pd/LDH-Aq were 0.55 and 0.58 wt%, respectively. 2.2.2 Impregnation method Impregnation was followed the procedures described in the reference [29] with some modifications. 0.02 g of Na2PdCl4 was dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol with addition of 1 g LDH support. After 14 h of vigorous stirring at room temperature, a freshly prepared ethanol solution of NaBH4 (0.1 M, NaBH4/metal (mol/mol) = 5) was added and the mixture was stirred until no bubbles produced. After filtration, washing, and drying under vacuum, IM-Pd/LDH-Et was obtained. The corresponding IM-Pd/LDH-Aq was obtained by using water instead of ethanol as the solvent in the above process. The Pd amounts in IM-Pd/LDH-Et and IM-Pd/LDH-Aq were 0.57 and 0.63 wt%, respectively."
4,Sample characterization,"2.3 Sample characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a Shimazu XRD-6000 diffractometer by using Cu Kα radiation over a 2θ range from 2 to 65°. Physisorption of N2 was performed at −196 °C using a Quantachrone Nova 1200e, and the surface area was calculated by the BET method. Before test, the sample was evacuated at 150 °C for 6 h. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) image was taken on a GG314-JEM-2100F instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250 xi with a monochromatic Mg Kα source. The binding energies were corrected utilizing the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement was used to detect the Pd content of the prepared Pd supported catalysts, and performed on an iCPA6300 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer."
5,Catalytic test,2.4 Catalytic test Aromatic alcohol oxidation was typically carried out according to the following procedure. 48.5 mmol of aromatic alcohol with 0.01 g catalyst was added into a two-necked glass at 140 °C with the oxygen flow rate of 20 mL/min and stirring speed of 600 rpm [27]. The reaction mixture was filtrated and the liquid phase was analyzed using a SHIMADZU GC-2014 equipped with a FID detector and a RTX-1 capillary column. The substrate conversion was monitored constantly with different time intervals.
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the prepared samples,"3.1 Characterization of the prepared samples Fig. 1 is the XRD patterns of the LDH support and the different Pd/LDH samples. As shown in Fig. 1, the LDH support prepared by co-precipitation exhibited typical characteristic Bragg reflections of LDH with the strong and sharp peaks, and all Pd/LDH samples still kept the original structure of the LDH support upon supporting Pd NPs. However, the intensities of (003) and (006) reflections of Sol-Pd/LDH (Sol-Pd/LDH-Et and Sol-Pd/LDH-Aq) two samples were much weaker than those of the LDH support. In contrast, IM-Pd/LDH (IM-Pd/LDH-Et and IM-Pd/LDH-Aq) two samples showed similar intensities of (003) and (006) peaks to the LDH support, even if IM-Pd/LDH-Et exhibited a slightly lower (003) reflection than IM-Pd/LDH-Aq. In the XRD patterns of LDHs, the (003) and (006) reflections can reflect the coherence along the layer stacking axis, while (110) and (113) reflections can reflect the layered framework [31]. The (110) and (113) reflections of Sol-Pd/LDH samples have the nearly same intensities to those of LDH support, demonstrating that the layered frameworks in the samples were intact. Gordijo et al. reported that MgAl LDH-CO3 could be exfoliated at ambient temperature in the mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-ethanol [32]. Because PVP and DMF contain amide group, we tentatively consider that the LDH support maybe also experienced the exfoliation-restack in the process of supporting Pd NPs, and the decreases in the intensities of (003) and (006) reflections of Sol-Pd/LDH samples maybe is due to the less order of the restacked LDH. Additionally, the 2θ values of the (003) reflections of all the samples remained the same to the LDH support, suggesting that the supported Pd NPs were located on the base platelet surfaces [14]. Pd phases were not observed in the prepared Pd/LDH samples due to the relatively low Pd loading (<0.7 wt%). The effects of the preparation methods and solvents on the textural properties of the prepared Pd/LDH samples were evaluated by N2 adsorption-desorption, and the results are shown in Table 1 . From Table 1, it can be seen that the preparation methods and solvents had great influences on the textural properties of the prepared Pd/LDH samples. Sol-Pd/LDH samples had larger BET surface areas and pore volumes than IM-Pd/LDH samples. The effects of the solvents are related to the preparation methods. The two Sol-Pd/LDH samples gave the similar BET surface areas and pore volumes (Entry1-2), irrespective of the used solvent, and their BET surface areas and pore volumes were much larger than the LDH support. For Sol-Pd/LDH samples, their higher surface areas and pore volumes than the LDH support might be due to the occurrence of exfoliation-restack of LDH in the process of supporting Pd NPs. This is in agreement with the XRD results. Different from Sol-Pd/LDH samples, IM-Pd/LDH-Et exhibited much higher BET surface area and pore volume than IM-Pd/LDH-Aq (Entry 3-4), and the impregnation solvents greatly affected the textural properties of the prepared IM-Pd/LDH samples. The distribution and mean size of Pd NPs on the different Pd/LDH samples were characterized by TEM measurement, and the TEM images are shown in Fig. 2 . For Sol-Pd/LDH-Et (a-b), the supported Pd NPs were uniformly dispersed and no obvious agglomeration was observed. The mean diameter of Pd NPs was found to be 2.6 nm with a narrow distribution range. In contrast, Pd NPs in Sol-Pd/LDH-Aq (c-d) were seriously agglomerated with a mean size of 5.9 nm. Similarly, IM-Pd/LDH-Et (e-f) had uniformly dispersed Pd NPs with a mean particle size of 3.2 nm and slightly wider size distribution (ca. 1.5–6.0 nm), while Pd NPs in IM-Pd/LDH-Aq (g-h) heavily aggregated with a larger particle size and broader distribution range. The above results showed that the colloidal/impregnation solvents and the methods of supporting Pd NPs on LDH greatly influenced the supported Pd dispersions. The different Pd dispersions in Sol-Pd/LDH samples prepared with ethanol/water colloidal solution mainly resulted from the stability of Pd NPs protected by stabilizer PVP in the different solvents. The dispersion of the particles in a solvent is dependent on the interaction between particles and solvent molecules, and stronger interaction between the particle and solvent can make the dispersed particles with lower energies [16,33]. For PVP coated Pd NPs, ethanol not only can form hydrogen bonds with the amide groups in PVP, but also can be adsorbed on either the hydrocarbon groups in the backbone chains or the pyrrolidone rings of PVP. Moreover, the -OH groups in the adsorbed ethanol can form hydrogen bonds with surrounding ethanol, and then further lowering the energy of PVP coated Pd NPs in ethanol. Therefore, both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic groups in PVP have strong interaction with ethanol, which made the isolated PVP coated Pd NPs more stable. Different from ethanol, water can only form hydrogen bonds with the amide groups in PVP, thus the interaction of PVP coated Pd NPs with water is weaker than that with ethanol, which causes the PVP coated Pd NPs in water are easy to aggregate [33]. For IM-Pd/LDH samples, as ethanol was used as the impregnating solvent, ethanol with less polarity might change the interaction force between LDH surface and Pd species, resulting in better dispersion of Pd NPs on LDH [34]. The oxidation states of the supported Pd NPs were characterized using XPS technique, and the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the different Pd/LDH samples are displayed in Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3, the binding energies of Pd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 in the XPS spectra of the four Pd/LDH samples, were found to be around 335.6 and 340.8 eV for the four Pd/LDH samples, corresponding to reported value for Pd0 [14,20,21]. These results indicated that the Pd NPs supported on the four samples mainly existed in the form of Pd0 and have the similar oxidation states."
8,Catalytic performances,"3.2 Catalytic performances 3.2.1 Effects of preparing methods and solvents The catalytic results of Sol-Pd/LDH and IM-Pd/LDH samples prepared in the different solvents are shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4A, benzyl alcohol conversions/selectivities to benzaldehyde obtained over all the samples increased/decreased with the reaction time, and Sol-Pd/LDH-Et gave higher activity/selectivity to benzaldehyde than Sol-Pd/LDH-Aq at the same reaction time. Similarly, IM-Pd/LDH-Et also exhibited higher activity than IM-Pd/LDH-Aq (Fig. 4B). The selectivity to benzaldehyde over IM-Pd/LDH-Et gradually decreased with the reaction time, while basically kept constant over IM-Pd/LDH-Aq. From the above catalytic reaction and characterization results, it can be inferred that the better catalytic results obtained over Sol-Pd/LDH-Et and IM-Pd/LDH-Et can be attributed to their higher dispersion of active Pd NPs. To reveal the influence of the methods of loading Pd NPs on catalytic performances of the prepared Pd/LDH samples, the catalytic performances of the Pd/LDH samples prepared by the different methods were compared. Because IM-Pd/LDH-Aq gave much lower activity than other samples, we focused on comparing the catalytic performances of IM-Pd/LDH-Et and Sol-Pd/LDH-Et. As shown in Fig. 5 , two samples followed the varying trends with reaction time, and gave the similar activities during the initial 3 h. After that, the reaction activity over Sol-Pd/LDH-Et continued to quickly increase in the investigated reaction time, while just slowly increased with reaction time over IM-Pd/LDH-Et. The conversion of benzyl alcohol reached 85% at 14 h over Sol-Pd/LDH-Et, however, only 50% at 14 h over IM-Pd/LDH-Et. The selectivities to benzaldehyde obtained over the two samples decreased with reaction time due to further oxidation benzaldehyde to benzoic acid. Although IM-Pd/LDH-Et had similar Pd amount to Sol-Pd/LDH-Et, it gave lower activity. Combined with TEM results, we considered that the boosting oxidation performance of Sol-Pd/LDH-Et can be ascribed the smaller size of Pd NPs and narrow particle distribution. This result is in agreement with the results reported by He [29]. They used HT (hydrotalcite) as the support and investigated the catalytic performances of the Pd/HT catalysts prepared by the different methods, and found the Pd/HTMDP-10 with a mean Pd particle of 2.3 nm exhibited much higher activity than Pd/HTIm with a mean Pd particle of 3.2 nm in oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In addition to this, the higher surface area maybe another factor for high activity obtained over Sol-Pd/LDH-Et. In oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the basicity of the supports plays an important role for the catalytic performance of Pd-based catalyst in oxidation of alcohol with O2 [21,22]. The basic sites in LDH supports not only can facilitate the activation of the alcohol substrate, but also can inhibit the formation of by-product toluene and benzoic acid and increase the selectivity to aldehydes or ketones in alcohol oxidation [29,35,36]. For Sol-Pd/LDH-Et, its large surface area could make more basic sites exposed and accessible to reactants. 3.2.2 Effects of various aromatic alcohols Sol-Pd/LDH-Et was selected to catalyze several aromatic alcohols and the results are listed in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2, Sol-Pd/LDH-Et exhibited high catalytic activity for aromatic alcohols without substituent group. In the oxidation reaction with benzyl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol as the substrate, the substrate conversions were 12.4/60.1% and 10.1/50.2% at 1 h/6 h, respectively. In the oxidation reaction with p-methoxybenzyl alcohol as the substrate, the p-methoxybenzyl conversion was only 7.7/18.9% at 1 h/6 h, much lower than benzyl alcohol/cinnamyl alcohol conversion. In addition, from Table 2, it still can be seen that Sol-Pd/LDH-Et was nearly inactive for the oxidation of p-nitrobenzyl alcohol and p-bromobenzyl alcohol (0.6% and 1.3% at 6 h, respectively). Hence, Sol-Pd/LDH-Et had higher catalytic abilities for substituted aromatic alcohols with an electron-donating group (e.g. -CH3O) than for that with an electrowithdrawing groups (such as -NO2 or -Br), which is consistent with the results reported previously [37,38]. In addition, the catalytic performance of Sol-Pd/LDH-Et was also compared with the other reported catalysts in solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol with O2 (Table 3 ). It can be seen that the prepared Sol-Pd/LDH-Et exhibited superior or comparable catalyst performance to other catalysts reported in the literatures. 3.2.3 Reusability The reusability of Sol-Pd/LDH-Et in solvent-free oxidation of benzyl alcohol with O2was tested. The catalyst was recovered after each reaction run by centrifugation, washing and drying, and then used for the next cycle under the identical reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 , the conversion of benzyl alcohol still maintained high in the fourth run while the selectivity towards benzaldehyde slightly decreased, confirming that Sol-Pd/LDH-Et was relatively stable. In addition, ICP measurement showed that the Pd content after four reaction cycles was almost the same as that of the fresh sample."
9,Conclusions,LDHs supported Pd catalysts were prepared by sol-immobilization and impregnation methods in the different solvents. The methods and the solvents in preparing process greatly influenced the dispersion of the supported Pd NPs on LDH support. Sol-Pd/LDH-Et or IM-Pd/LDH-Et prepared with ethanol as the colloidal or impregnation solvent gave higher Pd dispersion than the corresponding Sol-Pd/LDH-Aq and IM-Pd/LDH-Aq with water as the colloidal or impregnation solvent. The differences were ascribed to different interaction of solvent with stabilizer PVP and the LDH support. High dispersion and accessible basic sites resulting in that Sol-Pd/LDH-Et exhibited the better catalytic activity and selectivity in benzyl alcohol oxidation than Sol-Pd/LDH-Aq and IM-Pd/LDH samples. This work provides an alternative and efficient route to improve the catalytic performance of the LDH supported catalysts via adjusting the modes of supporting metal NPs on LDHs.
