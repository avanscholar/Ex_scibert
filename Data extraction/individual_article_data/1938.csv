0,Introduction,"Aniline production has always been an important issue, because it is used, as a raw material in many industrial processes such as the plastics industry to produce synthetic dyes, rubber chemicals, amino resins, polyurethane, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate [1,2]. Previously, phenol amination was employed as a route to produce aniline but is no longer used. In 2002, Sunoco Chemical closed its U.S. unit due to mechanical problems, and in 2009, Mitsui shut down its plant in Chiba, Japan due to poor economics. Currently, hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in the gas phase over copper or nickel catalysts is a commercially appropriate way for aniline production [3]. One of the main challenges in hydrogenation processes is to provide the hydrogen needed for the reaction. The reforming processes, including partial oxidation, steam, and autothermal, are common technologies to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels. In these processes, depending on the quality of the fossil fuels, the ratio of carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas to hydrogen produced is about 10:1 [4]. Fossil fuel depletion, global warming, and environmental problems are the main reasons for using bio-resource fuels as a suitable alternative to fossil fuels. One of the most important renewable fuels is biodiesel, whose annual worldwide production has been increasing recently; moreover, it is anticipated to expand its global use [5] continuously. Biodiesel decreases CO2 emissions by more than 52% [6]; however, it is not competitive from the price viewpoint than fossil fuels. Glycerol (nearly 10%), as the main byproduct, is produced by converting animal fat or vegetable oils into biodiesel through the catalytic trans-esterification process [7]. One cost-effective way to reduce biodiesel's price is to use glycerol for producing hydrogen [8]. Steam reforming of glycerol is the most well-known and preferable technique for H2 production [9] because it can theoretically make 7 mol of hydrogen per mole of glycerol as follows: (1) C 3 H 8 O 3 ( g ) + 3 H 2 O g ↔ 7 H 2 g + 3 C O 2 ( g ) Many researchers have focused on glycerol's potential to convert hydrogen from the mathematical modeling and simulation perspectives [10–14]. Saidi and Moradi [15], Wang et al. [16], Yang et al. [17], Ghasemzadeh et al. [18,19], and Macedo et al. [20] used a hydrogen perm-selective membrane reactor instead of a conventional glycerol steam reformer to improve the glycerol conversion and hydrogen yield. The same hydrogen yield can be attained at lower temperatures in the membrane separation technology, which prevents coke formation, catalyst sintering, and unwanted reactions. Another alternative to shifting this reaction towards higher hydrogen yield is the sorption-enhanced glycerol steam reforming process [21–26], which involves the CO2 sorption and the catalytic reaction. Although this system reduces CO2 emissions, the major disadvantage of this process is the regeneration of CO2 sorbents in another reactor. Therefore, the capital costs in the membrane reactor are decreased due to applying only one reactor instead of two reactors; moreover, it is possible to produce pure hydrogen. Since the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction is highly exothermic, another critical issue in this reactor is removing heat from the solid wall to prevent catalyst deactivation. One appropriate approach is to use multifunctional reactors, in which an exothermic reaction is integrated with an endothermic one. In these reactors, the exothermic reaction is a heat source to drive the endothermic reaction [27]. In recuperative coupling, as the most common method, heat is transferred through the walls, where the exothermic and endothermic sides are separated. In most cases, the co-current mode has led to higher conversion and lower hot spot temperature than the counter-current mode [28]. According to the advantages of the recuperative coupling reactor, many studies have been conducted theoretically on this topic [29–40]. In this regard, numerous researchers indicated that the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline could provide the necessary heat for various endothermic reactions such as dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene [41,42], isobutane dehydrogenation [43], naphtha reforming [44,45], and methane steam reforming [46] in a thermally coupled reactor. Although high nitrobenzene conversion (80–96%) was achieved by coupling hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with the above endothermic reactions, the hydrogen source of this hydrogenation reaction was provided by fossil fuels. Recently, Khazayialiabad et al. [47] conducted a conceptual evaluation of a thermally coupled reactor containing three concentric cylinders for co-production of aniline and pure hydrogen. The inner cylinder includes the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction, providing the heat required for glycerol steam reforming in the middle cylinder. In order to obtain pure hydrogen, a membrane was used to remove the hydrogen produced on the reforming side and direct it to the outer cylinder. Additionally, a portion of pure hydrogen was recycled to the hydrogenation side to supply all hydrogen required for the aniline production process. In this study, a different configuration to that presented by Khazayialiabad et al. [47] is suggested. Glycerol steam reforming as a potential source of bio-hydrogen, is coupled with hydrogenation of nitrobenzene reaction in a mass- and heat-integrated multi-tubular membrane reactor (MH-MMR). In this reactor, the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is used as a heat source to drive the glycerol steam reforming reaction. At the same time, the hydrogen produced by the glycerol steam reforming permeates through the membrane to be consumed in the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction. The differences between these two reactors are mainly in the configuration of the reactor system and the hydrogen-feeding strategy towards the hydrogenation side. In addition to aniline, MH-MMR produces syngas while the other one produces hydrogen in the respective reactor. In this regard, a one-dimensional heterogeneous model is developed to evaluate the system's operability and the effect of various parameters on the reactor performance, including glycerol and nitrobenzene conversion, as well as the H2/CO ratio. Finally, a comparison between MH-MMR and the structure proposed by Khazayialiabad et al. [47] is carried out with focusing on the hydrogen-feeding procedure, and the benefits and drawbacks of each configuration are highlighted."
1,Process description,
2,Conventional aniline production process,"2.1 Conventional aniline production process A flow diagram of the conventional aniline production process is shown in Fig. 1 a. Firstly, natural gas is desulfurized and then mixed with steam before entering the reformer. The carbon monoxide generated in the steam reformer is treated with water in a water–gas shift converter to produce additional hydrogen. The steam changes to the liquid phase in a condenser, and the discharged stream runs to the pressure swing adsorption (PSA). Pure hydrogen flows out of the PSA unit, and the waste gases as well as methane makeup gas are combusted with air to supply the heat required for the reformer. Finally, the hydrogen-rich gas stream reacts with nitrobenzene to produce aniline."
3,Mass- and Heat-integrated process,"2.2 Mass- and Heat-integrated process Fig. 1b indicates a flow diagram of the suggested loop for the aniline production process. Glycerol and water are first evaporated in a vaporizer and then entered an MH-MMR, as the leading equipment of this process. A conceptual diagram of this reactor is shown in Fig. 2 . This reactor consists of a bundle of tubes, placed in a shell. Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene occurs in the shell (also known as exothermic-side), and glycerol steam reforming takes place in the tubes (also known as endothermic-side). The heat required for the endothermic-side is continuously supplied from the exothermic-side. Hydrogen produced in glycerol steam reforming reaction is simultaneously transferred across the surface of membrane tubes, and consumed on the exothermic-side. The outlet stream of the exothermic-side is driven to a dehydration column, and water as the feedstock of the endothermic-side is recycled to the entrance of the vaporizer."
4,Methodology,
5,Mathematical model,"3.1 Mathematical model A 1D heterogeneous model has been established to specify the temperature and concentration of species along the reactor axis. A differential element is considered along the reactor to derive the mass and energy balance equations for endothermic- and exothermic-side. The governing equations are simplified by the following assumptions: • According to the compressibility factor calculation based on the Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera equation of state for glycerol steam reforming (i.e., 0.995) and nitrobenzene hydrogenation (i.e., 0.993), the behavior of the gas can be considered ideal. • Steady-state condition • The bed void fraction of both sides is constant in axial and radial directions. • Catalyst deactivation is ignored. • The mass and heat diffusion in the axial direction can be disregarded compared to the bulk flow according to the large enough Peclet number (Pe > 100) [48]. • The conduction resistance in the solid wall of tubes is ignored. • The effectiveness factor, which indicates intra-particle mass and heat transfer restriction, is calculated based on the dusty gas model for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, and assumed equal to one for glycerol steam reforming due to the small diameter of the catalyst (i.e., 115 µm) and Thiele modulus < 0.4. 3.1.1 Partial mass balances for component i (2) k c , i , k a k C k y i , k s - y i , k g = ρ b υ i r i i n e n d o t h e r m i c - s i d e ρ b ∑ j = 1 N η j υ i , j r j s i n e x o t h e r m i c - s i d e f o r s o l i d - p h a s e (3) d u s , k C k y i , k g dz + k c , i , k a k C k y i , k g - y i , k s + α γ π d t J H 2 A c , k = 0 f o r f l u i d p h a s e (4) at z = 0 y i , k g = y i , k g , 0 where υ i takes values of + 1 and −1, respectively, depending on whether component i is produced or consumed; and υ i , j stands for stoichiometric coefficient of component i in reaction j. 3.1.2 Total mass balance (5) d u s , k C k dz + a k C k ∑ i = 1 n k k c , i , k y i , k g - y i , k s + β γ π d t J H 2 A c , k = 0 (6) at z = 0 u s , k = u s , k 0 3.1.3 Energy balances (7) h k a k T k s - T k g = ρ b ∑ i = 1 n υ i - Δ H f , i r i i n e n d o t h e r m i c - s i d e ρ b ∑ j = 1 N η j - Δ H r j r j s i n e x o t h e r m i c - s i d e f o r s o l i d - p h a s e (8) d C k u s , k C p , k T k g dz + h k a k T k g - T k s - β γ π d t A c , k ∫ T 2 g T 1 g J i C p , k d T + β γ π d t A c , k U 1 - 2 T 2 g - T 1 g = 0 f o r f l u i d - p h a s e (9) at z = 0 T k g = T k g , 0 where the superscript k represents the side number (k = 1: endothermic-side; k = 2: exothermic-side).

The hydrogen permeation flux, J H 2 , through this membrane was determined by Morreale et al. [49] at conditions of simultaneously elevated temperature 623–1173 K and pressure 0.1 × 106-2.76 × 106 Pa as follows: (15) J H 2 = Φ 0 δ e x p - E p RT P H 2 endo 0.62 - P H 2 exo 0.62 where Φ 0 (=3.21 × 10−8 mol m−1 s−1 Pa−0.62) and E p (=13.41 kJ mol−1) are the pre-exponential factor and activation energy for the permeation phenomena, respectively. 3.1.6 Auxiliary correlations A set of auxiliary correlations, containing physical properties, heat and mass transfer coefficients, and diffusion coefficients are listed in Table 1 ."
6,Kinetics model,"3.2 Kinetics model 3.2.1 Hydrogenation of nitrobenzene Nitrobenzene is converted to aniline over Pd/Al2O3 catalyst at atmospheric pressure. (16) C 6 H 5 NO 2 + 3 H 2 → C 6 H 5 NH 2 + 2 H 2 O Δ H r 298 K = - 443 k J mol - 1 The rate of this reaction is reported by Amon et al. [59] as follows: (17) r = k K C 6 H 5 NO 2 K H 2 P C 6 H 5 NO 2 P H 2 1 + K C 6 H 5 NO 2 P C 6 H 5 NO 2 + K H 2 P H 2 2 (18) k = A e x p - E RT where A = 0.186 , E = 10 k J mol - 1 , K H 2 = 4.427 × 10 - 3 Pa - 0.5 , and K C 6 H 5 NO 2 = 1.51 × 10 - 5 Pa - 1 . 3.2.2 Glycerol steam reforming The overall reaction (1) is executed at atmospheric pressure and temperature of 723–823 K over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, which includes glycerol decomposition and water–gas shift reactions as shown in Eq. (19) and (20) [60,61]: (19) C 3 H 8 O 3 → 3 C O + 4 H 2 Δ H r 298 K = 251 k J mol - 1 (20) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H r 298 K = - 41.1 k J mol - 1 However, reactions (19) and (20) may also be accompanied by reactions (21)-(25) as the side reactions [60]: (21) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 5 H 2 ↔ 3 CH 4 + 3 H 2 O (22) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O (23) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O (24) CO 2 + CH 4 ↔ 2 C O + 2 H 2 (25) CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + C (26) C + H 2 O ↔ C O + H 2 (27) 2 C O ↔ C + CO 2 The formation of CH4, as a by-product, must be taken into account according to reactions (21)-(24). On the other hand, according to the findings of Wang et al. [62], carbon deposition can be prevented at high steam to glycerol ratios. Since the high steam to glycerol ratios are considered in this study, the carbon formation reactions including (25)-(27) have been neglected. Some of the research works reported that besides the gas products (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4) resulting from these reactions, small proportions of water-soluble compounds such as short-chain alcohols, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone, acrolein, and acetol could also be formed during glycerol decomposition from competing dehydration and dehydrogenation [63]; which can be ignored. The rate of glycerol steam reforming was presented by Cheng et al. [60] based on the power-law equation as follows: (28) r i = A i e x p - E i RT P C 3 H 8 O 3 a i P H 2 O b i A cs where A and E denote the pre-exponential factor and activation energy, respectively, and the reaction is also ath order concerning C3H8O3 and bth order concerning H2O. The kinetic parameters of glycerol steam reforming are tabulated in Table 2 ."
7,Base-scenario definition,"3.3 Base-scenario definition The main operating conditions to be set are weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), the molar ratio of the mixtures fed to the exothermic- and endothermic-side, and inlet temperatures and pressures. Different aspects should be considered when choosing the values of these parameters. Among these, the nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion, the resistance of catalysts and construction materials to high temperatures, safety, and the possibility of carbon formation reactions can be mentioned. The operating parameters have been chosen by studying a range of values in which glycerol steam reforming and nitrobenzene hydrogenation are usually carried out and choosing those that best satisfied the different requirements of the process. The investigated range and final values of the operating parameters and geometry conditions chosen are reported as a base scenario in Table 3 . Qualitative considerations are reported in the following paragraphs: • Feed temperature: an increase in this value leads to higher nitrobenzene and glycerol conversions but also a more carbon deposition in the reforming reaction and faster catalyst deactivation; • WHSV: the reason for choosing this value is explained in detail in Section 4.3; • Feed molar ratio: diluting the glycerol fed to the reactor allows temperatures to remain at moderate levels when using high inlet temperatures or feed flow rates. The overall efficiency of the process is however harmed by the need to heat a higher amount of gas to the desired inlet temperature. In addition, excess steam is provided in the feed line to prevent coke formation; • Feed pressure: both reactions are run at low pressures close to atmospheric pressure. To choose the operating parameters, an estimate of the minimum molar feed flow rate to the exothermic-side has been evaluated by considering that the amount of heat produced by hydrogenation reaction must be at least sufficient to compensate for the heat absorbed by the steam reforming. To determine this quantity, the conversion of nitrobenzene and glycerol must be known. In the present case, an 80% conversion and a syngas with H2/CO ratio ranging from 2.0 to 2.5, suitable for Fischer-Tropsch and methanol synthesis processes, have been set. Higher conversions are always desirable, but this comes at the expense of higher temperatures. However, the role of parameters affecting the performance of the reactor has been investigated. In this regard, the conversion of nitrobenzene and glycerol, as the assessment criteria, is defined by Eqs. (29) and (30). (29) Nitrobenzene c o n v e r s i o n = F C 6 H 5 NO 2 0 - F C 6 H 5 NO 2 exo F C 6 H 5 NO 2 0 (30) Glycerol c o n v e r s i o n = F C 3 H 8 O 3 0 - F C 3 H 8 O 3 endo F C 3 H 8 O 3 0"
8,Numerical solution,"3.4 Numerical solution The governing equations consist of algebraic and ordinary differential equations, in which the ordinary differential equations are discretized into non-linear algebraic equations using the backward finite difference method. In this regard, the length of the reactor is divided into 1200 equally-spaced points, and all linear and non-linear algebraic equations are solved by the “fsolve” function in MATLAB software (R2020a) based on the trust-region-dogleg method."
9,Results and discussion,"A carbon balance is performed around the endothermic-side of the reactor to compare the exiting carbon content with the amount of carbon entered by the glycerol. By doing this, it is possible to estimate the share of carbon in final products, including gas and liquid products. The results show that the entering carbon content is 333.36 kg/h, while the exiting one is 331.2 kg/h. The relative error of 0.64% expresses that the share of liquid products is tiny compared to gaseous products, which confirms the waiver of the liquid products during mathematical modeling."
10,Model reliability analysis,"4.1 Model reliability analysis Although no experimental or plant data was found in the literature to verify the kinetic model of the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction, numerous researchers [41–45,47] used the kinetic model reported by Amon et al. [59], which emphasizes the accuracy and precision of this model. To validate the mathematical and kinetic models assigned for glycerol steam reforming, the simulation results are compared with the experimental data provided by Cheng et al. [60] under the geometry and operating conditions reported by them. Table 4 shows that the developed model can provide a convincing approximation of the experimental data with maximum absolute error (AE) of 0.5 for hydrogen to glycerol ratio at 823 K. Since the consumption/generation rate of steam was not presented in the kinetics model (see Table 2 and its concentration is predicted through the atomic balance, so some notable error is observed in some cases. In addition, ignoring carbon formation and disregarding liquid products can differentiate between simulation and experimental data, which increases with temperature from 723 to 823 K. Therefore, the given model can also be applied to simulate this integrated process. However, to attain a highly confident model, it is necessary to validate the simulation results of this new process with experimental data."
11,Simulation results,"4.2 Simulation results 4.2.1 Comparison between mass- and heat-integrated reactor and adiabatic reactor A comparison between MH-MMR and adiabatic reactor (AR), as shown in Fig. 3 , is carried out in terms of nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion as well as gas temperature in exothermic- and endothermic-side. In the AR, no heat is transferred from the solid wall of the tubes into the endothermic-side. So, the heat required for glycerol steam reforming takes from sensible heat of the gas, and temperature profile reduces rapidly to reach 590 K (see Fig. 3b. This leads to a decrease in the reaction rate, resulting in a lower degree of glycerol conversion, i.e., 38% (see Fig. 3a. Instead, the heat required for glycerol steam reforming in the MH-MMR is supplied by the other side; the gas temperature remains at a higher level compared to the AR (see Fig. 3b, and consequently, the glycerol conversion reaches 80% (see Fig. 3a. At the first half of the MH-MMR and AR, the gas temperature in the exothermic-side rises, increasing the nitrobenzene conversion. In the AR, the gas temperature reaches 1250 K at the end of the reactor because of no heat transfer from the solid wall; but at the second half of the MH-MMR, the temperature decreases from 935 to 875 K. This leads to a higher nitrobenzene conversion in the MH-MMR (i.e., 80%) as a result of the Le Chatelier's principle, compared to that in the AR (i.e., 41%). The comparison between MH-MMR and AR indicates that the nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction can provide the heat required to drive the glycerol steam reforming, and coupling of these two reactions can be feasible and beneficial for the following reasons: (i) saving much energy by transferring heat from the exothermic- to endothermic-side to drive the glycerol steam reforming, (ii) achieving almost high conversion of nitrobenzene and glycerol (i.e., 80%), and (iii) keeping the temperature of nitrobenzene hydrogenation low to prevent catalyst deactivation. 4.2.2 Comparison between mass- and heat-integrated reactor and heat-integrated reactor with recycle stream As mentioned in Introduction Section, Khazayialiabad et al. [47] proposed a triple-pipe reactor consisting of hydrogenation-, reforming-, and permeation-side, in which a portion of pure hydrogen recovered in the permeation-side was recycled to the hydrogenation-side to provide all hydrogen required for the aniline production. Since the structure of this reactor is different from the MH-MMR and direct comparison of these two configurations is not possible, the performance of the MH-MMR is compared with a heat-integrated reactor with recycle stream (HR-RS), in which glycerol reforming is integrated with hydrogenation reaction in a multi-tubular reactor, and a portion (i.e., 88% [47]) of hydrogen produced in the endothermic-side is sent to the entrance of exothermic-side along with nitrobenzene. The results obtained from the simulation of the two reactors are reported in Fig. 3 and refer mainly to conversion and temperature profiles. In the HR-RS, the nitrobenzene and glycerol conversions reach 100%, exceeding considerably compared to that in MH-MMR (i.e., 80%) (see Fig. 3a. At a distance of 0.5 m from the entrance of the HR-RS, a hot spot temperature (i.e., 1270 K) is observed and then gradually decreases due to hydrogen depletion (see Fig. 3b. The main drawback of HR-RS is the presence of this temperature peak. A possible solution to this problem is to inject hydrogen along the axis of MH-MMR through a membrane to achieve a smooth temperature profile (i.e., nearly 900 K). Therefore, the MH-MMR is potentially able to reduce the temperature profile of the hydrogenation reaction significantly. On the other hand, although reducing the amount of hydrogen sent to the HR-RS will reduce the temperature peak, the nitrobenzene conversion will be limited, all hydrogen will be consumed rapidly, and the hydrogenation reaction will not provide the heat required for the steam reforming. These results show that with the configuration studied in the present work, it is possible to obtain performances similar to those of an HR-RS at the cost of a slightly greater reactor length. On the other hand, temperature peak is avoided, allowing for easier control of the process, a delay in catalyst deactivation, and reducing material resistance issues."
12,Effect of WHSV,"4.3 Effect of WHSV The effect of WHSV in the exothermic- and endothermic-side on nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion, is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Increasing WHSV in the endothermic-side leads to a reduction in residence time, thereby decreasing the glycerol conversion; but it has no significant effect on nitrobenzene conversion. So, the lowest WHSV, i.e., 35 1/h, is chosen as the base scenario for the endothermic-side (see Table 3. At this value, increasing WHSV in the exothermic-side results in reducing residence time, ultimately a decrease in nitrobenzene conversion. On the other hand, glycerol conversion increases with WHSV due to higher temperature in the endothermic-side, and finally approaching 100%. The intersection of the nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion profiles, i.e., WHSV = 0.15 1/h, represents the best WHSV for the exothermic-side, in which nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion is 80%. Therefore, as shown in Table 3, the base scenario for the exothermic-side is characterized by the value of WHSV equal to 0.15 1/h."
13,Effect of feed components molar ratio,"4.4 Effect of feed components molar ratio Fig. 5 shows the effect of H2O/nitrobenzene and H2O/glycerol ratio on the glycerol conversion, aniline production, and H2/CO ratio. At a given WHSV in the exothermic-side (i.e., 0.15 1/h), glycerol conversion decreases with H2O/nitrobenzene ratio because of lower temperature in the endothermic-side of the reactor (see Fig. 5a. Although excess steam in the feed stream of the exothermic-side can prevent coke formation on the catalyst, aniline production also decreases with H2O/nitrobenzene ratio due to lower nitrobenzene molar flow rate. Therefore, it seems that the proper value for steam to nitrobenzene ratio is in the range of 3–6, to prevent coke formation and further aniline production. In addition, a synthesis gas with H2/CO ratio = 2.0–2.5 is obtained under these operating conditions, which is proper for the Fischer-Tropsch and methanol synthesis processes. Although, at the constant WHSV in the endothermic-side (i.e., 35 1/h), glycerol conversion increases with steam/glycerol ratio due to lower glycerol molar flow rate, no significant change in aniline production is observed (see Fig. 5b. In addition, it has been reported in the literature [64] that a low amount of steam has a negative effect on the performance of the catalyst in glycerol steam reforming due to carbon deposition, and on the membrane efficiency in terms of hydrogen permeation flux. On the other hand, too much steam leads to high vaporization costs on an industrial scale. Therefore, choosing a moderate steam/glycerol ratio between 7 and 10 is one way to overcome these challenges, and generate a syngas with H2/CO ratio above 2.0 for Fischer-Tropsch and methanol synthesis. However, increasing the steam to glycerol ratio raises the H2/CO ratio due to more hydrogen production and more CO consumption through the water–gas shift reaction."
14,Effect of inlet gas temperature,"4.5 Effect of inlet gas temperature Fig. 6 indicates the variations of glycerol and nitrobenzene conversion, as well as H2/CO ratio versus inlet gas temperature on the endothermic- and exothermic-side. Cheng et al. [60] reported that coke is deposited on Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 823 K after four h, resulting in catalyst deactivation, even under excess steam/glycerol ratios. High temperatures also increase the cost of reactor construction, energy consumption, and operational costs. Therefore, to evaluate the effect of endothermic-side temperature on the reactor performance, 823 K is selected as the maximum allowable temperature to prevent coke deposition. Rising the inlet gas temperature in the endothermic-side from 723 to 823 K makes the rate of glycerol steam reforming reaction faster, which increases the glycerol conversion by 30%, and increases hydrogen partial pressure accordingly (see Fig. 6a. This leads to more hydrogen permeation, and consequently, a 32% increase in nitrobenzene conversion. Nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion is observed almost higher than 80% at the endothermic-side temperature of 800–823 K. The H2/CO ratio reduces with gas temperature due to an increase in the rate of reverse water–gas shift reaction, thereby resulting in hydrogen consumption and CO production. As shown in Fig. 6b, increasing the inlet gas temperature in the exothermic-side from 850 to 950 K increases the nitrobenzene conversion up to 10%, because of the rising rate of nitrobenzene hydrogenation. An increase of 10% in glycerol conversion can also be observed with gas temperature on the exothermic-side due to more heat transfer rate from the solid wall of the tubes. The comparison between Fig. 6a and 6b indicates that the inlet gas temperature interval of 100 K in glycerol steam reforming has a more significant effect on nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion than that in nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Nevertheless, increasing the gas temperature in the exothermic- and endothermic-side has no considerable impact on the H2/CO ratio."
15,Effect of inlet gas pressure,"4.6 Effect of inlet gas pressure The changes in nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion, as well as H2/CO ratio, with inlet gas pressure in exothermic- and endothermic-side are presented in Fig. 7 . It is found that higher gas pressure in the endothermic-side benefits the hydrogen permeation through the membrane, regarding an increase in the driving force, and leading to a rise in the nitrobenzene conversion (see Fig. 7a. Further hydrogen removal shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium of steam reforming towards higher glycerol conversion according to Le Chatelier's principle; furthermore, it is expected to inhibit other side reactions. Besides, this leads to a less amount of hydrogen on the endothermic-side, and so a lower H2/CO ratio. At pressures above 500 kPa, the glycerol conversion gets higher than 80% and H2/CO ratio reaches lower than 2.5. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing that an almost suitable degree of conversions and H2/CO ratio can be achieved at 500 kPa. On the other hand, further increasing the pressure leads to more energy consumption. As shown in Fig. 7b, no appreciable change in H2/CO ratio is found with inlet gas pressure on the exothermic-side. Increasing pressure leads to a higher conversion of nitrobenzene due to a higher hydrogenation reaction rate. So, more heat is transferred from the solid wall and a slight enhancement on the glycerol conversion is observed. An increase in gas pressure above 100 kPa has no significant effect on the conversions, so the atmospheric pressure (∼100 kPa) can be chosen as the appropriate pressure under the base-scenario conditions."
16,Effect of number of tubes,"4.7 Effect of number of tubes Fig. 8 illustrates the alterations of nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion in response to the number of tubes and WHSV. At a given WHSV, increasing the number of tubes leads to a decrease in heat transfer flux per tube due to an increase in the total heat transfer surface area, subsequently getting lower temperature levels and glycerol conversion on the endothermic-side. On the other hand, the nitrobenzene conversion increases due to higher hydrogen permeation rate through the membrane. At WHSV = 0.5 1/h in hydrogenation reaction and = 60 1/h in glycerol reforming, the intersection of the nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion profiles represents the best number of tubes (∼500), in which nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion is 65%. Besides, at WHSV = 0.15 1/h in hydrogenation reaction and = 35 1/h in glycerol reforming, the appropriate tube number to get the highest conversion of nitrobenzene and glycerol (i.e., 80%) is 200. Thus, WHSV and the number of tubes can simultaneously affect the conversion."
17,Conclusion,"This study was focused on a heat-integrated multi-tubular membrane reactor, containing nitrobenzene hydrogenation and glycerol steam reforming to produce aniline and syngas as valuable products. In this structure, nitrobenzene hydrogenation provided the heat required for glycerol reforming. At the same time, hydrogen was continuously permeated through the membrane from endothermic- to exothermic-side. Besides, the steam exiting from the exothermic-side was recycled to the entrance of the endothermic-side. This recuperative reactor was evaluated through a 1D heterogeneous plug flow model. The backward finite difference method was applied to discretize and solve the governing equations through the trust-region-dogleg approach. Based on detailed modeling and studying the impact of various parameters on reactor performance, the acceptable range of operating conditions for this process was found as follows: 3 < steam/nitrobenzene ratio < 6 to prevent coke formation and further aniline production, 7 < steam/glycerol ratio < 10 to avoid carbon deposition and reduce steam usage, 850 < inlet gas temperature in exothermic-side < 950 K to achieve adequate conversion, 800 < inlet gas temperature in endothermic-side < 823 K to prevent catalyst deactivation, decrease operational costs, and gain high nitrobenzene and glycerol conversion, inlet gas pressure in exothermic- and endothermic-side ≅ 100 and 500 kPa, respectively, to obtain glycerol and nitrobenzene conversion above 80% and reduce energy consumption in the compressor. Numerical results showed that more than 80% of nitrobenzene was converted to aniline, and synthesis gas with H2/CO ratio in the range of 2.0–2.5 was obtained, which is suitable for Fischer-Tropsch and methanol synthesis processes. In general, the advantages of this mass- and heat-integrated process compared to the conventional nitrobenzene hydrogenation are as follows: (1) simultaneous production of aniline and syngas in one reactor, (2) reducing the process capital cost due to the removal of desulfurizer, steam reformer (furnace), water–gas shift converter, and PSA unit, (3) conversion of glycerol, as the main by-product during biodiesel production, into a value-added product such as hydrogen for nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction, (4) providing the auto-thermality within the reactor by coupling glycerol steam reforming and hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, and (5) supplying the steam required for glycerol steam reforming from nitrobenzene hydrogenation, and (6) mitigation of the environmental pollution due to no flue gas emissions into the atmosphere. The authors are also looking to optimize and design this mass- and heat-integrated process in future works."
