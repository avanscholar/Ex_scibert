0,Introduction,"Recently, progressive exhaustion of traditional fossil fuels has intensified serious energy and environmental crisis [1], and thereby it is urgent to research renewable and/or alternative energy resources, energy conversion and storage [2]. Nowadays, electrochemical energy conversion is commonly regarded as one of renewable energy conversion and storage systems [3]. Ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are two significant electrochemical energy conversion processes, which are widely applied in water electrolysis and fuel cells, respectively [4]. Electrochemical water splitting is environmental-friendly and cost-effective for hydrogen generation [5]. Also, EGOR owns high energy density and less toxicity as an ideal system for direct alcohol fuel cells [6]. Hitherto, commercial applications of HER and EGOR are seriously impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions [7], although substantial efforts have been made to develop numerous nanocatalysts. Particularly, Pt catalysts still play crucial roles in energy production and conversion [8]. Unfortunately, poor durability and high cost of Pt itself seriously limit their practical applications in HER and EGOR [9]. Over the past few decades, massive efforts have been made to address these issues [10]. For example, oxophilic elements (e.g. Ag, Au, and Ru) were introduced into Pt-based catalysts for enhanced electro-catalytic features and CO tolerance in view of the hierarchical nanostructures, bifunctional mechanism and electronic effects [11]. The synthesized PtAu/Au nano-pentagrams exhibited good catalytic capability for ethanol oxidation [12]. Meanwhile, the octahedral PtCo nanocatalyst displayed high catalytic activity and durability towards HER [13]. Recently, AgPt hollow nanostructures have attracted substantial attention in catalysis, owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio and rich active sites for catalytic reactions [14]. Besides, Ag can simultaneously facilitate the intermediate oxidation and cleavage of C-C bonds, as well as boosting the activation of surface Pt active sites [1]. For example, Ag-Pt@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with hollow porous structures showed improved catalytic features towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [15]. In another example, Ag-Pt hollow nanospheres displayed enhanced catalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) [16]. Recently, many methods have been developed to synthesize PtAg hollow nanocatalysts, such as polyol synthesis templating [17], photoreduction [18], and microwave synthesis [19], yet most of them are complex and time-consuming. As it is known, 5-azacytosine (Fig. S1, Supporting Information, SI), contains amine- and carbonyl-groups [20], which can efficiently chelate with metal precursors to guide metallic crystal growth [21]. Hence, a 5-azacytosine-mediated method was developed to synthesize hollow AgPt nanotube bundles (H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs). The electrocatalytic characters of the products were researched with HER and EGOR as benchmarked models.

1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), silver nitrate, 5-azacytosine, ascorbic acid (AA), hydrazine hydrate (80 wt%), commercial Pt/C, and ethylene glycol (EG) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Other chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. All of aqueous solutions were prepared here with twice-distilled water throughout the whole experiments."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The morphology and structure of the samples were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) on a JEM-2100 HR transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, equipped with selective area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The elemental mappings were recorded on a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector (HITACHI S-5500). X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed on a Philips PW3040/60 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis was conducted on a K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (SCIENTIFIC ESCALAB 250) with Al Kα X-ray radiation (1486.6 eV) for excitation."
4,Preparation of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs,"2.3 Preparation of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs For detailed synthesis of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs, 28.02 mg of 5-azacytosine was put into 8.98 mL of a 0.02 mol/L HNO3 solution. Then, 518 μL of H2PtCl6 (38.6 mmol/L) and 1 mL of AgNO3 (20 mmol/L) were added to the mixture under stirring at 25 °C. After mixing for 5 min, 1 mL of AA solution (100 mmol/L) was dropwise injected into the mixture. After 30 min of reaction, 100 μL of hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) was put into the above system. Ultimately, the samples were collected by centrifugation, washed thoroughly, and dried at 60 °C. Controlled experiment was conducted by changing the mole ratios of the initial Ag/Pt precursors or the 5-azacytosine concentrations, while the other experimental conditions were kept constant."
5,Electrochemical experiments of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs modified electrodes,"2.4 Electrochemical experiments of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs modified electrodes Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Chenhua Co., Shanghai, China) with a conventional three-electrode system: A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) or glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, 3 mm in diameter) as the working electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. Besides, a graphite rod was used as the counter electrode for HER. For typical construction of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs modified electrodes, a well-dispersed suspension (1.0 mg/mL) of the sample was first prepared by ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, 6.0 μL of the suspension was dropped onto the freshly-polished electrode. After drying, 4 μL of Nafion (0.05 wt%) was then casted onto the electrode surface to tight the deposit. For comparison, home-made Ag34Pt66 NPs, Ag70Pt30 NPs, and commercial Pt/C catalysts modified electrodes were prepared similarly. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs was estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in N2-saturated 0.5 mmol/L H2SO4. Then, CV and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs for EGOR were performed in 0.5 mol/L KOH. Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic activity and stability towards HER were investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and CA in N2-saturated 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 solution at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm. All electrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature if not stated otherwise."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to characterize the morphology of the representative product (Fig. 1 A–C). There are abundant nanotubes clearly observed. Each nanotube owns dark edge and very gray center, reflecting the formation of hollow structures. This observation is further demonstrated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1B), in which the chain diameter is calculated to be roughly 5 nm, and the shell thickness is about 2.14 nm. Furthermore, the fringe lattice distances are roughly 0.228 nm and 0.230 nm in the HRTEM images, corresponding to the (1 1 1) crystal facets of the AgPt alloy [22]. In addition, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern identify their polycrystalline feature [23]. The hollow structure and composition distribution were further investigated by high angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (HAADF-STEM-EDS) mappings and line scanning profiles (Fig. 2 ). Obviously, Pt and Ag atoms are homogeneously dispersed throughout the entire nanotubes, in which hollow architecture is further proved by the elemental mappings (Fig. 2A–D). The intensity profiles (Fig. 2E) further reveal the homogeneous distribution of Ag and Pt atoms on the shells. Besides, the Ag/Pt atomic ratio is 44:56 by the EDS analysis (Fig. 2F), and the product is defined as H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs for simplicity. In addition, the Ag/Pt atomic ratios are about 34:66 and 70:30 for the two referenced AgPt products (Fig. S2, SI), denoted as Ag34Pt66 NPs and Ag70Pt30 NPs for clarity, respectively. These results verify the formation of the AgPt alloy [24].

These results verify the formation of the AgPt alloy [24]. The structural and phase information were further evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 3 shows that four representative diffraction peaks at 38.93°, 45.20°, 66.04°, and 78.98° correspond to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes of the AgPt structures, respectively, coincidently showing up between Pt (JCPDS 04-0802) and Ag (JCPDS 04-0783) [16]. The analysis proves the formation of the atomic-mixed AgPt alloy again [25]. The surface chemical composition and chemical valences were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4 A,B shows high-resolution Ag 3d and Pt 4f XPS regions of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs. The oxidation state of Ag is ignorable in the high-resolution Ag 3d XPS region (Fig. 4A), implying no impurity such as AgCl detected. As for the high-resolution Pt 4f XPS section (Fig. 4B), there are two intense peaks of Pt 4f detected at 71.14 and 74.54 eV, which are well indexed to metallic Pt0, while the other two weak ones at 72.06 and 75.48 eV are ascribed to Pt2+ species. By comparing the peak areas, Pt0 is the predominant, which would promote the electrocatalytic activity [23]. Briefly, metallic Ag and Pt are the main species in H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs. Similar phenomena are also noticed for Ag34Pt56 NPs and Ag70Pt30 NPs in the contrary experiments (Fig. S3, SI).

Similar phenomena are also noticed for Ag34Pt56 NPs and Ag70Pt30 NPs in the contrary experiments (Fig. S3, SI). Notably, the Pt 4f peaks (Fig. 4C) have the negative shifts as a function of the Pt contents in the AgPt products, because Ag donates electrons to Pt and thereby substantially increases electron density around the Pt sites [26]. However, an adverse trend is found in Ag 3d (Fig. 4D) because of the strong electronic interactions between the bimetals, which further confirm the formation of the AgPt alloy [27]."
8,Formation mechanism of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs,"3.2 Formation mechanism of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs First, the influences of the molar ratios of the Ag/Pt precursors to the final products were investigated to uncover the formation mechanism of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs (Fig. S4, SI). Evidently, the hollow tube-like bundles are hardly prepared with the feeding ratios of 1:3 and 3:1. It indicates the essential role of the appropriate ratio in the preparation of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs.

Evidently, the hollow tube-like bundles are hardly prepared with the feeding ratios of 1:3 and 3:1. It indicates the essential role of the appropriate ratio in the preparation of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs. Similarly, insufficient (e.g. 10 mmol/L, Fig. S5A. SI) or superfluous (e.g. 50 mmol/L, Fig. S5B. SI) 5-azacytosine hardly yields well-defined H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs in control experiments. These results verify the crucial role of proper 5-azacytosine concentration as a structure-directing agent. This assumption is confirmed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, Fig. S6, SI). Specifically, the reduction potentials of Ag+/Ag and PtCl6 2−/Pt are 0.716 V and 0.711 V in the absence of 5-azacytosine, which display the negative shifts to 0.511 V and 0.632 V in the presence of 5-azacytosine, respectively. It means the difficult reduction of the precursors in the complex forms. These results provide scientific evidences about the critical role of 5-azacytosine in the synthesis.

It means the difficult reduction of the precursors in the complex forms. These results provide scientific evidences about the critical role of 5-azacytosine in the synthesis. Fig. 5 describes the formation mechanism of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs in detail. First, mixing the AgNO3 and H2PtCl6 solutions with 5-azacytosine initiates the generation of AgCl precipitates, due to the existence of a lot of Cl− in the system. Then, the AgCl precipitation and/or 5-azacytosine-PtCl6 2− complexes would be reduced to Pt and/or Ag atoms after the introduction of AA. Subsequently, the newly-produced metal atoms are fast covered by the contiguous 5-azacytosine molecules to reduce the total surface free energy [28,29], which are simultaneously fused together to form AgPt nuclei. When hydrazine hydrate is further introduced to the reaction media, abundant Ag/Pt atoms are quickly generated and deposited on the initial AgPt nuclei under the guidance of 5-azacytosine. Eventually, H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs are generated via epitaxial growth, Ostwald ripening and overgrowth [30]."
9,Electrochemical performances,"3.3 Electrochemical performances To evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs, the ECSA were first estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, used Ag34Pt66 NPs, Pt/C and Ag70Pt30 NPs as the contrasts (Fig. 6 A). The loading of Pt was maintained at 4.0 μg, as calculated by using the Pt weight ratio within the catalyst based on the EDS analysis. The ECSA values were estimated by integrating the charges accumulated during hydrogen reduction/proton oxidation process after the double-layer correction [31]. Fig. 6B displays the ECSA values as the following order: H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs (70 m2 g−1 Pt) > Pt/C (64 m2 g−1 Pt) > Ag70Pt30 NPs (40 m2 g−1 Pt) > Ag34Pt66 NPs (32 m2 g−1 Pt). Notably, the H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs catalyst has the largest ECSA among the investigated catalysts, which is also higher than AgPt hollow nanospheres (18.70 m2 g−1) [11], owing to the unique structures of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs. The enlarged ECSA would enhance the catalytic activity of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs [32]. The electrocatalytic behaviors of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs, Pt/C, Ag34Pt66 NPs, and Ag70Pt30 NPs catalysts were investigated in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 for HER (Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7A exhibits the polarization curves acquired by LSV. It is found that the overpotential is only 29 mV for H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs at 10 mA cm−2, much smaller than the contrasts under the identical conditions. When the overpotential is 70 mV, the current densities are 42.94, 0.76, 19.09 and 27.26 mA cm−2 for H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs, Ag34Pt66 NPs, Ag70Pt30 NPs and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Clearly, the current density of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs is dramatically higher than the contrary catalysts. It indicates remarkable enhancement in HER activity of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs. Tafel slope is applied to evaluate the intrinsic activity of a catalyst toward HER [33]. Fig. 7B shows the Tafel plots. Clearly, the Tafel slope (42 mV dec−1) of the H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs catalyst is smaller than those of Ag70Pt30 NPs (48 mV dec−1), Ag34Pt66 NPs (70 mV dec−1) and PtAu nanostructured films/Si (56 mV dec−1) [34], albeit with its close to Pt/C (40 mV dec−1), further showing the greatly enhanced reaction kinetics [35]. Besides, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at –0.05 V (Fig. 7C) according to the previous work [33]. Compared with Ag34Pt66 NPs and Ag70Pt30 NPs, the synthesized H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs catalyst has the smallest charge-transfer resistance (Rct ), indicating the fastest HER kinetics in this context [36]. The long-term stability of the catalysts for HER is another important criterion for practical applications [37]. After 1000 cycles, the polarization curves of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs have no obvious change relative to the initial one (Fig. 7D), reflecting superior catalytic stability of the catalyst. Besides, the current densities have a negligible decline within 8000 s by CA at −0.11 V (Fig. S7, SI). These results again confirm greatly improved stability of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs after the long-term test. The long-term stability of the catalysts for HER is another important criterion for practical applications [37]. After 1000 cycles, the polarization curves of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs have no obvious change relative to the initial one (Fig. 7D), reflecting superior catalytic stability of the catalyst. Besides, the current densities have a negligible decline within 8000 s by CA at −0.11 V (Fig. S7, SI). These results again confirm greatly improved stability of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs after the long-term test. The electro-oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) was further explored as another model to examine the catalytic properties of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs in a KOH solution (0.5 mol/L), with Pt/C, Ag34Pt66 NPs, and Ag70Pt30 NPs catalysts as the contrasts. There are two peaks (Fig. 8 A), which are originated from electro-oxidation of EG on the catalysts at 0.96 V and removal of CO-like intermediates produced at 0.57 V [38], respectively. Remarkably, the peak current density in the forward scan (jf ) is dramatically higher than the one detected in the backward (jb ), suggesting improved toleration of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs. The onset potentials (Eonset ) are 0.37, 0.53, 0.46, and 0.49 V, with the jf values of 75.23, 2.49, 58.24 and 65.74 mA cm−2 for H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs, Ag34Pt66 NPs, Ag70Pt30 NPs and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. The fabricated H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs catalyst has the highest jf , which is 1.14, 1.37, and 30.21 times higher than those of Pt/C, Ag70Pt30 NPs and Ag34Pt66 NPs catalysts, respectively. Therefore, the highest jf and lowest Eonset of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs present distinguishable improvement in EGOR activity. Besides, the jf /jb ratio is utilized to measure the tolerance of catalysts to accumulated carbonaceous intermediated species blocking Pt catalysts and seriously affecting their activity [39]. The ratios are 9.09, 10.1, 11.24 and 4.46 for H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs, Ag34Pt66 NPs, Ag70Pt30 NPs and Pt/C catalysts, respectively, implying the strongest tolerance of unique H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs to CO-poisoning intermediates in this research [40]. Furthermore, mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) were assessed through normalization by the Pt mass and ECSA, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 8B and C, H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs have the highest MA and SA among the catalysts. Particularly, the MA of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs is 1377.38 mA mg−1 Pt, which is larger than Ag70Pt30 NPs (222.88 mA mg−1 Pt), Ag34Pt66 NPs (1164.89 mA mg−1 Pt), and Pt/C (1150.77 mA mg−1 Pt), as exhibited in Fig. 8B. Meanwhile, the SA of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs is 2.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8C), which is 1.1-, 3.4-, and 1.2-time larger than those of Ag70Pt30 NPs (1.9 mA cm−2), Ag34Pt66 NPs (0.62 mA cm−2), and Pt/C (1.8 mA cm−2). These results all manifest the enhanced EGOR activity of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs. The long-term durability is an important parameter of a catalyst for EGOR [41]. The durability of the afore-mentioned catalyst was carefully checked by CA at −0.25 V in 0.5 mol/L KOH (Fig. 8D). Observably, the peak current densities decay rapidly at the initial period, owing to the deactivation of the catalyst by poisoning CO-like intermediates generated during EGOR [42]. After 10,000 s, the current densities of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs, Ag70Pt30 NPs, Ag34Pt66 NPs, and Pt/C catalysts are 17.72, 13.78, 1.20, and 3.96 mA cm−2, respectively. Evidently, the H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs catalyst shows the highest current densities over the entire test, indicating its dramatic increase in EGOR durability. The outstanding catalytic performances of H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs are ascribed to electronic and structure factors. First, the hollow nanotube bundles provide more accessible specific surface area for small reactants, as confirmed by the greatly enlarged ECSA relative to the references. Second, XPS data reveal the electron migration between Pt and Ag during the formation process. The obvious change is found in the electronic states of Pt atoms thanks to the electron interactions between Ag and Pt. Furthermore, the incorporation of Ag would weaken the chemisorption energy of the adsorbed CO-like intermediates, facilitate their diffusion rate and oxidation during the reaction, and eventually improve the catalytic features [43,44]. In addition, the alloy character and specific hollow hierarchical frameworks effectively promote the efficient removal of the toxic intermediates to liberate more active sites available and thereby to enhance the catalytic activity, prevent the H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs catalyst from aggregation, and hence improve the stability [45,46]."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs were efficiently fabricated by a green one-pot co-reduction method, in which 5-azacytosine served as the structure-director. No other specific additives such as surfactant, polymer, seed and template were involved. Benefiting from the porous hollow structure and the synergetic effects between the bimetals [44,45], the as-constructed catalyst had high ECSA (62.38 m2 g−1 Pt), displaying dramatically improved catalytic activity and durability for HER and EGOR in comparison to the referenced catalysts. Therefore, H-Ag44Pt56 NTBs can be employed as a promising catalyst in electrochemical energy conversion and storage. This research provides an effective way to construct hollow structures, which would benefit to design and synthesis of novel nanocatalysts in fuel cells."
