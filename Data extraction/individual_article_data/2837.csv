0,Introduction,"High temperature proton-conducting ceramics based on ABO3 perovskite oxides of general formula (BaCeO3, SrCeO3, BaZrO3 etc.), have received increasing attention as ceramic conductors in the energy field [1,2]. Among the other oxides, BaCexZr1-xO3-d-based (BCZ) ceramics show a good compromise between the proton-conductivity and CO2 and H2O-stability. This family of perovskite is particularly employed as electrolytes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) [3–6] and as proton conductors in hydrogen separation membranes [7–10]. Hydrogen separation ceramic membranes are very attractive for their full H2 selectivity, high thermal stability, and intrinsic lower cost compared to the Pd–based counterparts. One of the most appealing features for all-ceramic H2 separation devices is their good chemical stability, especially in sulphur [11] and CO2 atmosphere with respect to the other systems [8,12]. These peculiar characteristics render these systems very promising candidates for process intensification with their direct integration into high temperature reforming or gasification plants [12,13]. The weakness of this technology lies into the low hydrogen permeation fluxes with respect to conventional Pd-based membranes that generally reach permeation rates of 100 mL/(cm² min) or higher. To be interesting for commercial uses these systems have to reach values higher than 1 mL cm−2 min-1 [7]. Among the others, BaCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ - Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-δ (BCZY-GDC) materials have recently received increasing attention for their exceptional hydrogen permeation performances reported by different authors [10,14,15]. Up to now, to the authors’ knowledge the best permeation obtained for these systems at medium operation temperature (750 °C) are in the order of 0.68 mL cm−2 min-1 in dry 50 % H2 and 0.47 mL cm−2 min-1 in wet 50 % H2 [15]. These values were obtained through the development of a porous-dense asymmetric structure [16,17] consisting of a dense active film supported onto a porous substrate. It is in fact demonstrated that the thinner is the dense membrane layer the lower would be its bulk diffusion resistance and, as a consequence, the higher would be the gas permeation performance [18]. However, other than thinning the active dense layer, the microstructure engineering of the porous support is a key-strategy to decrease its mass transfer resistance allowing the operation at high flow streams that would enable to reach industrial target [19,20]. Systems exhibiting hierarchically organized porosity, low pore tortuosity and acceptable mechanical properties have in fact received increasing attention for gas separation applications [19]. Dong et al. [20,21] reported higher oxygen fluxes (3.4 and 3.63 mL cm−2 min-1 at 1050 °C) in air-oxygen separation for microchannel La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-based structure produced by phase-inversion process compared to conventional dense and supported membranes. The increased permeability is demonstrated to be linked to the fast pathway for oxygen diffusion in the straight channels. Chen et al. [22] showed the obtaining of dual-phase LSM-YSZ composite membrane showing large finger-like pores with circular cross section that significantly improve the oxygen permeability with respect to a membrane prepared by a sequential two-step tape casting with pore former. Even in this case, the asymmetric membrane was developed using phase-inversion tape casting. Serra et al. [23] reported the obtaining of dual-phase oxygen-permeable asymmetric membranes prepared by the combination of freeze-casting and screen-printing. This system was constituted of ice-templated support with hierarchically oriented porosity and fully densified La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ and NiFe2O4/Ce0.8Tb0.2O2−δ layers on top. This membrane exhibited a promising oxygen permeation value of 6.8 mL min−1 cm−2 at 1000 °C, demonstrating the importance of minimizing the pressure drop of the porous support to enhance the membrane performances [24]. Among the different techniques, freeze-casting is an attractive shaping method for the development of highly porous and organized structures with aligned channels. Particularly, ice-templating allows the obtaining of samples with values of tortuosity close to the ideal case (τ = 1) and higher gas permeability [25]. For gas separation application the type and amount of porosity produced with this technique leads to a remarkably low pressure drop through the porous substrate offering low resistance to the diffusion of gases [26]. In this work, porous BCZY-GDC ceramics were developed, for the first time, using the ice-templating method to obtain membrane supports with well-organized and aligned porosity for hydrogen separation application. The slurry composition was optimized in terms of type and additives amount. The effect of different cooling rates on the microstructure, permeability and mechanical properties of the produced supports were investigated as well."
1,Material and methods,"BCZY (BaCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ, Marion Technology, France) and GDC powders (Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-δ, FuelCellMaterials, USA) in 1/1 vol% ratio were previously mixed with 1 wt% ZnO (Sigma Aldrich, Italy) as sintering aid and used as starting powder. The type and amount of deflocculants were firstly evaluated throughout viscosity analyses, using powder-water suspensions containing the same solid content of the freeze casting slurry. The deflocculants considered were: PVA (Sigma Aldrich, Italy), Darvan 811 (RT Vanderbilt Company, USA) and Darvan 821A (RT Vanderbilt Company, USA). For the preparation of the freeze casting slurries, distilled water was used as solvent, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Sigma Aldrich, Italy) as binder and Surfynol SE-F (Evonik Industries, Germany) as antifoaming agent. The powder/water ratio of the slurries was fixed at 20/80 vol% and the antifoaming amount set to 0.60 % in weight. The slurries were prepared at room temperature adding the deflocculant and the powder to the solvent. After 1 h of magnetic stirring, the surfactant and the binder were added to produce the final suspension. The as-prepared slurry was then poured into a circular crown silicon mould supported on metal plate and put in a freeze-drier (Lio 3000 PLT, 5 Pa, Italy) at the freezing temperature of −40 °C for 3 h to obtain samples with aligned porosity. The cast samples were demoulded and thermally treated at 1550 °C for 4 h to produce the final BCZY-GDC supports with 20 mm of height and 14 mm of diameter. Denser layers detected in the bottom part of samples have been mechanically polished before the further characterization."
2,Characterization methods,"2.1 Characterization methods Viscosity measurements were performed to determine the best type and amount of deflocculant using a controlled-stress rheometer (Bohlin CVOR 120, Malvern Instruments, Italy) with 25 mm diameter parallel-plate geometry, setting the gap at 500 μm. The measurements were carried out at shear stresses from 0.01–10 Pa. Sample phase purity was assessed through X-Ray diffractometer (D8 Discover X-Ray diffractometer, Bruker Cu Kα radiation, Germany). The sample microstructure was investigated using optical digital microscope (RH-2000, Hirox, France) and by scanning electron microscopy (Field Emission Gun - Scanning Electron Microscopy, FEG-SEM, ΣIGMA, Zeiss, Germany). The sample cross-section was firstly embedded in epoxy resin and then mechanically polished till 0.25 μm finishing. The dimension of the lamellar porosity was determined using ImageJ program where t and w are, respectively, the thickness and the width of the pore and d is the interlamellar spacing as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The open porosity of the produced samples was determined by mercury intrusion technique (Thermo Finningan Pascal 140) working at pressure from ambient to 400 kPa. The apparent porosity was derived from the density obtained by Archimede’s method [27]. The permeability test was performed in an in-house testing rig constituted by a mass flowmeter (Type GR-112, Baggi, Italy), a manometer (HD2124.1, Delta Ohm, Italy) with pressure probes (TP704/10BAI, Delta Ohm, Italy) using N2 as flowing gas and applying the Darcy’s Law. The N2 permeability value was calculated using the equation reported by Simwonis et al. [28–30]. The compressive strength of the sintered samples was investigated with a Universal Testing Machine (Zwick/Roell Z050, Germany) considering cylindrical samples with a high/diameter ratio of about 0.5 using a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min."
3,Results and discussion,"The slurry for the production of BCZY-GDC porous support was firstly optimized engineering the nature and amount of deflocculant needed for the production of a stable water-based suspension. The deflocculants considered must show good steric-electrostatic stabilization and water solubility. Thus, PVA, Darvan 811 and 821A were considered. The former is a hydrolysed polymer, commonly used as additive in ceramic water suspensions [31–33], while Darvan 811 and 821A [34,35] are anionic polyelectrolytes of sodium and ammonium respectively, selected on the basis of the positive values of ζ potential shown by the powder in water. As reported in the Experimental part, the best deflocculant type and concentration was evaluated through viscosity measurements [36,37] analysing suspensions of the same solid content of the freeze casting slurry (20 vol%). Different deflocculant amounts were tested in the range between 0.1 and 3 wt% with respect to the powder and compared to the suspension without deflocculant (TQ). The values of viscosity for the considered suspensions at 0.1 Pa of shear stress are reported in Fig. 2 . Darvan 811 and 821A showed similar ability in decreasing the viscosity values especially in the 0.1−0.3 wt% range of deflocculant concentration. On the other hand, PVA does not help the particles stabilization increasing the viscosity of the system due to its higher steric action in respect to the other deflocculants. Fig. 2c shows the viscosity/shear stress curves of the best performing deflocculants (i.e. Darvan 811 and 821A with a concentration of 0.3 and 0.1 wt% respectively), compared to the one of the BCZY-GDC/water system without additives. It is clear how the latter shows high viscosity values with a dilatant behaviour typical of instable suspensions. If the suspension is not stable the suspended particulate is inclined to separate from the liquid phase as a result of forces directly acting on the ceramic particles such as the gravitational force and the Hamaker attractive interaction. More in details the effect produced by these forces in separating the particulate phase from the suspension is strictly related to the particles dimension. For small particles, as in this case, particle-particle interactions are predominant and they are responsible for the shear thickening behaviour observed (i.e. dilatant nature). An effective stabilization was therefore achieved by means of the anionic polyelectrolytes employed (i.e. Darvan 811 and 821A) which introduced a repulsive interaction opposing to the attractive forces between particles. Among these, Darvan 811 with a concentration of 0.3 wt% with respect to the powder gave the best stabilization in the linear part of the viscosity/shear stress curves (Fig. 2 c)), i.e. the lowest viscosity value for the BCZY-GDC/water system. For this reason, the deflocculant concentration in the ceramic suspension was set to 0.3 wt %. The binder plays a pivotal role in the development of freeze-cast samples easy to handle and showing acceptable mechanical properties after thermal treatment. Based on the literature [19] PVA was selected as the binder for this water-based system, and amounts of 2 (slurry 1) and 3 wt% (slurry 2) with respect to the powder were considered. The slurries composition developed are reported in Table 1 . The samples produced considering the two slurries were thermally treated at 1550 °C for 4 h. The XRD analysis of the sintered system is reported in Fig. 3 . The result of this analysis shows the final obtaining of pure BCZY-GDC phases even using water as solvent. It is, in fact, well known [38,39] the tendency of Ba-based materials to hydration when they come in contact with water or atmosphere moisture. In this case, the XRD analysis confirms the possibility to apply water freeze-cast processes for the development of BCZY-based systems. The SEM images of the horizontal cross section of the samples produced with different amounts of binder are reported in Fig. 4 . The characteristic porosity dimensions t, w, d (Fig. 1) of the horizontal cross section of samples produced with slurry 1 and 2 (Fig. 4) were measured by image analysis and listed in Table 2 . The reported results indicate the similar characteristic dimensions of the lamellar porosity produced with the two slurries with slightly lower size tendency for higher PVA amount, in accordance with literature results [33,40,41]. The main differences between the two produced samples are visible in their vertical cross section reported in Fig. 5 . Whereas the slurry 1 (Fig. 5a,b) produces aligned vertically oriented porosity typically expected from the growth of hexagonal ice crystals, the increasing of binder amount leads to the formation of more equiaxed pore sections that surround lamellar-shaped pore regions. This is attributed to the secondary dendritic formations originated from the same primary dendrites as a result of the increased binder content [40,42]. The increasing of PVA leads to a finer primary ice dendrites microstructure and evident secondary dendrites growing. This behaviour is linked to the effect of supercooling produced by the addition of PVA to water that leads to a decrease in the local equilibrium liquidus temperature in respect to the one imposed by the external cooling conditions [40]. This promotes the formation of a secondary dendritic arms due to the longer period of time in contact with the liquid. Even the gas permeability of the samples (Table 2) resulted strongly influenced by the microstructure, lower values for supports produced with slurry 2 are ascribed to the secondary dendric formations. The amount of binder selected for the next tests was therefore 2 wt% with respect to the powder since the samples obtained showed vertical aligned porosity and higher gas permeability. The viscosity of the slurry 1 at shear rate of 1–100 s−1 (Fig. 2) is showing typical pseudoplastic behaviour of the suspension. Once optimized the slurry composition in terms of type and amount of organic additives, the cooling rate of the freezing process was changed to engineer the microstructure of the obtained porosity. As reported by Li et al. [43], the freezing rate is one of the significant factors affecting the ice crystal nucleation and growth and therefore the microstructures of produced samples. The cooling rate considered were 10, 30 and 50 °C/h which were applied to the samples until the maximum freezing temperature of −40 °C followed by a 3 h dwell. The optical digital microscope images and the SEM micrographs reported in Fig. 6 show how the selected cooling rates influence the types of obtained porosity. The increasing of cooling rate from 10 °C/h to 30 °C/h leads to the formation of lower size porosities and to the decreasing of the distance between lamellae [44–47] as estimated by the results coming from image analysis reported in Table 3 . The higher freezing speed reduces in fact the opportunity of growth for ice crystals producing finer and more frequent porosity with respect to the sample frozen with lower cooling rate. On the contrary, the sample produced using the higher cooling rate (50 °C/h) shows similar values of pore length, w, and distance between pores, d, compared to the sample frozen at 30 °C/h, but with higher values of pore width. This behavior can be explained considering the vertical cross section of the sample (Fig. 7 c)) in which it is clear the presence of an inhomogeneous microstructure constituted by mixed vertically oriented and equiaxed porosity, the latter mainly concentrated in the bottom, upper and lateral part of the samples. This morphology is attributed to the rapid solidification of suspension that hinders particles rearrangements [30] producing porosity not vertically oriented and large voids (Fig. 7 c) in the internal part of the sample. The presence of this equiaxed porosity leads to the increasing of the medium pore width, t, in the sample frozen at 50 °C/h with respect to the ones produced at lower cooling rates. Fig. 7 b) shows a homogeneous microstructure and vertically aligned porosity in the sample produced at 30 °C/h. On the other hand, the sample frozen at 10 °C/h (Fig. 7 a)) shows the presence of porosity related to the secondary dendritic growth localized in the upper and lateral parts of the cylinder. In these regions the temperature gradient probably decreases if compared to the one at the bottom parts producing a second dendritic growth that shows a not-aligned porosity with horizontal orientation. Moreover, by rising the cooling speed a slightly increase of the amount of porosity is obtained as reported in Table 4 . The values of open porosities follow the same trend of the total porosity. Table 5 highlights higher values of gas permeability for the porous supports produced at 30 and 50 °C/h. In particular, the first one shows the best values of permeability even with a lower porosity level with respect to the second one. This is attributed to the good alignment and homogeneity of the sample produced by using 30 °C/h as freezing rate (Fig. 7 b)). The lower permeability of the sample cooled at 10 °C/h is due to the presence of equiaxed porosity originated from the secondary dendritic growth that hinders the gas flow through the porous support. In general, the permeability results are in accordance with the values reported in literature [25,40] for others ice-templated ceramic substrates. In particular, it is worth mentioning that the permeability values shown by freeze cast supports are one order of magnitude higher respect to the ones registered for porous BCZY-GDC substrates (2.59 × 10−13 ± 3.5 × 10-14) conventionally produced by tape casting [12]. These results are therefore very promising to produce a support with enhanced gas permeability. The compression load-displacement curves and the compressive strength (σ) values of the produced BCZY-GDC samples are reported in Fig. 8 and Table 5, respectively. The higher σ is reached by the sample frozen at 30 °C/h thanks to its homogeneous microstructure and finer porosity (Table 3) with respect to the one cooled at 10 °C/h. The latter shows the lower strength probably due to the higher length and width of the porosity and to the presence of equiaxed pore that decreases the mechanical stability of the produced support. The sample cooled at 50 °C/h shows the lowest values of strengths due to the inhomogeneous microstructure and the presence of large internal voids as shown in Fig. 7c). In this regard, Bergstrom et al. [48] reported values of compressive strength of freeze cast zeolite changing with solid content of suspensions and cooling rate of the process. For solid loading similar to the one reported in our study they found lower values of compressive strength (around 450 kPa). Increasing cooling rate, the compressive strength tends to increase, similarly to what reported in this study for the samples frozen at 10 and 30 °C/h. The same authors [48] do not report evidence of microstructure inhomogeneity in the sample cooled at the higher freezing rate: on the contrary to what reported in this study, this sample showed the best compressive strength. Seuba et al. [49,50] studied the mechanical behaviour of freeze cast YSZ substrates in relation to the microstructures of the samples showing values of compressive strength of 22.9 ± 2.5–198.2 ± 16.9 MPa. Some of the samples presented in this work shows values of compressive strength comparable to the ones related to YSZ support [49] with higher level of total porosities (70−72 vol%) indicating lower mechanical properties of the substrates produced in this work. However, the stress-strain curves of [49] are very similar to the ones reported in this study (Fig. 8) showing simultaneously multiple fracture events caused by the high porosity. Also Wang et al. [51] produced freeze cast tubular porous mullite membrane supports for membrane application showing comparable mechanical properties for samples with same values of solid loading. For these reasons, the mechanical properties here reported are considered acceptable for this application. These results identify the sample frozen at 30 °C/h as the best compromise between permeability and mechanical stability for freeze-cast BCZY-GDC supports. For this reason, this freezing condition will be considered in the future for the development of the asymmetric membrane system."
4,Conclusions,"BCZY-GDC ceramic supports were successfully produced by ice-templating technique through an accurate optimization of both suspension and process parameters. Darvan 811 was selected as best deflocculant in amount equal to 0.3 wt% with respect to the powder. On the other hand, 2 wt% of PVA was considered as the best binder concentration to obtain aligned vertically oriented porosity. The cooling rate selected in the study were 10, 30 and 50 °C/h which were applied till the maximum freezing temperature of −40 °C was reached. The increasing in cooling rate leads to the formation of lower size porosities and decreasing of the distance between lamellae. Among the others, the sample frozen at 30 °C/h displayed homogeneous microstructure and good porosity alignment with respect to the other cooling rates. The samples produced showed open porosity around 40 vol% and N2 permeability of 6-8 10−12 m2, values which are one order of magnitude higher compared to the ones registered for tape cast BCZY-GDC substrates with isotropic porosity conventionally used for protonic applications. The best compromise between the porous support properties in terms of porosity alignment, permeability and mechanical properties was obtained by the sample frozen at 30 °C/h. This study confirms the possibility to obtain BCZY-GDC porous support with vertically aligned porosity suitable for hydrogen separation application. Further work will be necessary for the development of a porous/dense asymmetric membrane constituted by a freeze cast support, suitable for H2 separation. For doing so, an accurate study of the film deposition procedures, parameters and slurry compositions will be necessary to develop a stable, thin and dense membrane on top of freeze cast substrates."
