0,Introduction,"In recent years, food packaging materials based on petroleum-based polymers have caused serious environmental issues, such as natural resource depletion, waste production and energy crisis contribution [1]. In response to the demand of environmental sustainability and the market trends, a lot of research has been devoted to the development of novel packaging materials based on biopolymers that are biodegradable and eco-friendly [2–4]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is one of the most common types of synthetic biopolymers that has been widely used in the food packaging industry. PVA is non-toxic and biodegradable, it was approved in 2003 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and permitted to be used as food packaging material in the United States [1,5–8]. However, compared with conventional synthetic plastics, PVA has a relatively high price. Considerable efforts have been made to blend PVA with other renewable materials to fabricate composite materials with lower manufacturing cost [2,6]. Furthermore, novel PVA composites often possess superior performance and multiple functions to meet the new requirements of customers [9,10]. Starch is one of the most abundant polysaccharides on earth, and plays an important role in the food packaging industry because of its low cost, non-toxicity and biodegradability [1,7,11,12]. Moreover, gelatinized starch has good film-forming ability [13]. The cast starch films are usually tasteless, odorless and transparent, showing good oxygen barrier properties for food preservation [14]. Among starches from various botanical origins, cassava starch is suitable to prepare packaging films by its high paste clarity, high gel stability and low gelatinization temperature [15]. The primary deficiencies of starch-based films are their poor mechanical properties and inferior water barrier properties [16]. Blending starch with other biopolymers can form a new class of composite materials with enhanced physicochemical properties [6,17,18]. It has been known that blending PVA with starch can result in a high performance PVA/starch composite [6,7,19,20]. PVA and starch are compatible since both have adequate hydroxyl groups in their molecular chains to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the obtained PVA/starch composite films can achieve homogeneous structures and improved properties [21]. Cano et al. [6] prepared composite films by blending PVA with pea starch, in which the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the obtained films were 32.30 MPa and 689 MPa, respectively, showing better mechanical properties than both pure PVA and pure starch films. Negim et al. [7] blended PVA with corn starch to fabricate films, and the thermal stability and biodegradability of the obtained films were superior to those of pure PVA films. Antimicrobial packaging is an important part of active packaging systems. The incorporation of antimicrobial agents into the packaging films can reduce the microbial contamination, which helps to extend the shelf life, guarantee the safety and maintain the quality of packaging food products [22,23,24]. LAE is an antibacterial agent derived from natural compounds, including lauric acid, L-arginine and ethanol [25,26]. It can effectively inhibit the growth of a wide range of spoilage microorganisms and food pathogens [27]. It is a surfactant that is capable of damaging the cell membrane with a low dose, subsequently altering the cell permeability and inhibiting the growth of microorganisms [28,29]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified LAE as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in 2005, and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved its application as a food preservative in 2007 [28]. Moreover, LAE is flavorless, colorless, resistant to high temperature and stable at pH 3–7. These characteristics make it a promising candidate for the development of new antimicrobial packaging films. The physicochemical properties and antibacterial performances of active packaging films incorporated with LAE have been investigated in previous studies [26,30,31]. Theinsathid et al. [4] fabricated PLA films and coated them with LAE, and found that a small amount of LAE coating (0.07%, w/w) efficiently inhibited the growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. However, while increasing the amount of LAE coating could improve the antibacterial activity, it compromised the transparency of the films. Haghighi et al. [32] prepared chitosan/PVA/LAE films and found that the addition of LAE increased the water vapor permeability and water solubility of the films while decreasing their mechanical properties and transparency. All films containing different concentrations of LAE (1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10%) showed antibacterial ability to against Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. LAE has been previously introduced as the antimicrobial agent into various food packaging materials [33–37]. However, the effects of LAE on the properties of PVA/starch blend films are not fully understood. As both PVA and starch are not able to inhibit the growth of pathogens and microorganisms in food, in this research, we investigate the effects of incorporated LAE on mechanical and antimicrobial properties of PVA/starch blend films. In this work, a film based on PVA/starch blends enriched with different concentrations of LAE was fabricated by a solution casting process. This blend film is designed for fresh food packaging such as meat and seafood to prolong their shelf life. It is safer and has longer-lasting protective abilities than conventional packaging systems because the LAE content in the polymer matrix is progressively released to the surface of packaged foods rather than directly added to the food formulation. The microstructure of the obtained blend films was characterized and the mechanical, optical and water barrier properties were evaluated. Moreover, the antimicrobial performances of blend films against two major food pathogens, E. coli and S. aureus were assessed in vitro. This study aims to develop a novel blend film with effective antimicrobial properties and enhanced physical properties, which can be potentially used in active food packaging applications."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cassava starch (food grade, the amylose-amylopectin ratio was 19:81 determined by the iodine method) was obtained from Guangxi Hongfeng Starch Co., Ltd. (Nanning, China). PVA (polymerization degree 1750 ± 50) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). LAE was obtained from Shanghai Bide Pharmatech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Glycerol (≥99%) and Glacial acetic acid (AR) were purchased from Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). E. coli (CMCC(B)26003) and S. aureus (ATCC25922) were obtained from Shanghai Luwei Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Casein soya bean digest agar (TSA) and Casein soya bean digest broth (TSB) were purchased from Guangdong Huankai Microbial Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China)."
3,Preparation of blend films,"2.2 Preparation of blend films A starch solution (10%, w/w) was prepared by dissolving the cassava starch granules in distilled water. Then, the starch solution was gelatinized by continuous stirring at 80 °C for 60 min (430 rpm). Similarly, the PVA solution (10%, w/w) was prepared by adding PVA powder to distilled water, and continuously stirred at 80 °C for 90 min (430 rpm). Afterwards, gelatinized starch was mixed with PVA solution at a ratio of 3:7 (w/w). This ratio was pre-determined by a preliminary experiment, in which five different starch/PVA ratios (1:9, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3 and 9:1) were prepared. The sample with ratio 3:7 demonstrated better clarity and potential for further study. Glycerin (20% of starch and PVA, w/w) and glacial acetic acid (20% of starch and PVA, w/w) were then added to the mixture and stirred at 80 °C for 30 min (430 rpm) to obtain the film-forming solution (FFS). Subsequently, different contents of LAE (1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10% of starch and PVA, w/w) were added to the FFS and stirred at 80 °C for additional 30 min (430 rpm) to reach complete dissolution. After cooling and eliminating the bubbles in the solution at room temperature, 20 g FFS was cast on a polymethyl methacrylate plate (120 × 120 mm) and dried at 25 °C in an oven for 24 h to obtain the blend films. Control films were prepared following the same procedure without adding LAE. All the film samples were stored in a desiccator at room temperature for at least 2 days before the measurement, and the relative humidity (RH) of the desiccator was adjusted to 53% by using saturated Mg(NO3)2."
4,Morphology and structural characterizations,"2.3 Morphology and structural characterizations The morphology and microstructure of the obtained blend films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology of a cross-section of the blend film was observed by a scanning electron microscope (Supra 55, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) operated at an acceleration voltage of 2 kV and 2000× magnification. Fractured samples were collected from the tensile test, fixed with a double-sided adhesive and sputter-coated with gold for the observation. A Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Nicolette Magna 550II, GMI, Ramsey, MN, USA) was used to characterize the interactions between cassava starch, PVA and LAE in the blend films. Samples were ground and mixed with KBr powder, then the mixtures were compressed to form the testing disc. Spectra were recorded in the 4000–400 cm−1 wavenumber range, with a spectral resolution of 8 cm−1. The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by an X-ray diffractometer (MiniFlex 600, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Kα Cu radiation source operated at 45 kV and 15 mA. The films were cut into squares (20 × 20 mm) and fixed on a sample stage (glass plate). Samples were scanned between 2θ = 3° to 40° with a step size of 0.02°. The crystallinity index (CI) of blend films was calculated by Eq. (1) [38]. (1) CI % = A c / A c + A a × 100 % where A c represents the crystalline area, and A a represents the amorphous area."
5,Thickness and mechanical properties,"2.4 Thickness and mechanical properties The film thickness was measured using a spiral micrometer (211-101, Jingyou Mould Hardware Co., Ltd. Dongguan, China). Six random positions were selected and measured on the films, one at the center and the other five at the edges. The thickness values were obtained based on the means of these six positions [39]. The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) of blend films were conducted with reference to the method used by Liu [40] using a universal testing machine (JDL-1000N, Tianfa Instruments Co., Ltd. Yangzhou, China). Rectangular strips (20 × 60 mm) were cut out from the sample film. Initial grip separation and overhead speed were set as 50 mm and 10 mm/min, respectively. TS was expressed in MPa and calculated by dividing the maximum load by the cross-sectional area of the sample. EB was expressed in percentage (%) and calculated by dividing the film elongation at break by the initial distance of the grips. The calculations were undertaken by the built-in software. All tests were repeated at least five times for each sample."
6,UV barrier properties and opacity,"2.5 UV barrier properties and opacity UV barrier properties and the opacity of blend films were investigated by an UV-VIS spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The film samples were cut into strips (10 × 40 mm) for the measurement. Their optical properties were evaluated at the UV wavelength range from 200 to 400 nm, and the visible light wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm. The opacity values were calculated according to Eq. (2) [32]. (2) Opacity value = − log T 600 / H where T 600 is the fractional transmittance of the blend film at a wavelength of 600 nm, and H is the thickness of the blend film. All measurements of optical properties were performed in triplicate."
7,Moisture absorption (MA) and water vapor permeability (WVP),"2.6 Moisture absorption (MA) and water vapor permeability (WVP) MA of the blend films was measured by using Abral's method with some modifications [41]. The square film strips (20 × 20 mm) were cut from the film samples and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 24 h to eliminate moisture. Afterwards, the dried film strips were stored in an airtight desiccator with 75% RH (using saturated NaCl) for 24 h to reach equilibrium and taken out for weighting. MA values were calculated using Eq. (3) and averaged based on three replicates. (3) MA % = M f − M i / M i × 100 % where M f represents the final weight (g) and M i represents the initial weight (g) of film strips. All measurements of moisture absorption were performed in triplicate. WVP of the blend films was examined using the method in ASTM E96-00 with some modifications [41]. A plastic cup (50 mm diameter) containing distilled water (30 mL, 100% RH) was covered by the sample film (60 mm) and completely sealed with Vaseline for avoiding moisture leakage. Then, the initial weight of the cup was weighed and placed into an airtight desiccator containing 1000 g silica. An incubator was used to maintain the desiccator at 25 °C. The cup was weighed every 3 h until its weight stabilized. WVP was determined by the relation between the weight loss and storage time and calculated using Eq. (4). (4) WVP g · m − 1 · s − 1 · Pa − 1 = dW × H / dt × dP × S where dW represents the weight loss of the plastic cup system (g), H represents the mean film thickness (m), dt represents the time change (s) under the partial water vapor pressure gradient (dP = 2533 Pa), S represents the permeation area of the film sample (m2). Tests were repeated four times and averaged to obtain WVP values."
8,In vitro antimicrobial activity (agar diffusion assay),"2.7 In vitro antimicrobial activity (agar diffusion assay) In vitro antibacterial activity of the control films and active films with different concentrations of LAE against E. coli and S. aureus was assessed according to the agar diffusion method used by Theinsathid et al., with some modifications [4]. The films were cut into a disc shape with a diameter of 8 mm. Subsequently, the disc shape sample and the TSA plate were each sterilized with UV for 2 h. Then the TSA agar plates were streaked with 0.1 mL TSB inoculant containing 108 CFU/mL of the tested bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus). Finally, the sample was placed on the surface of the TSA agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the average diameter (mm) of the inhibition zone around the disc shape sample. All tests were repeated three times."
9,Statistical analysis,"2.8 Statistical analysis The experimental data were expressed as the mean ± SD (standard deviation). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using SPSS statistical analysis software (SPSS Statistics 26 for Windows, IBM, New York, USA). Differences between the mean values of the properties of blend films were detected by Tukey's multiple range test (p ≤ 0.05)."
10,Results and discussions,
11,Morphology,"3.1 Morphology The cross-section images of the control film (LAE-0%) and the active films with different concentrations of LAE are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the addition of LAE greatly affected the surface morphology of the blend films. The cross-section of the control film without LAE (Fig. 1A) is relatively smooth and homogeneous as compared with other LAE containing samples. It indicates that PVA and cassava starch have good compatibility in blending, which could be due to the formation of the hydrogen bonding between the PVA and cassava starch [21]. Small aggregations and rough surface were observed at the cross-section of active films incorporated with LAE (Fig. 1B–E), when the concentrations of LAE were 1% and 2.5%. It might be due to the aggregation of LAE in the film matrix, and the interaction between PVA and starch being disrupted by LAE, leading to the destruction of the compact structure of the polymer blends [30,32,42]. When the concentration of LAE was 5%, pores appeared on the film cross-section, and when the concentration of LAE was 10%, the number of pores clearly increased. This can be explained by the enhanced surfactant effect of LAE. Due to the high surface tension, small air bubbles were generated and sustained during the blending process in the film-forming solution, and the high viscosity of the mixture solution made it difficult to eliminate them, thereby causing the formation of pores in the film matrix [30]."
12,FTIR,"3.2 FTIR Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the control film and active films incorporated with different concentrations of LAE. The broad adsorption band between 3200 and 3600 cm−1 is attributed to the OH stretching vibrations, indicating the intermolecular hydrogen bonds form between PVA and cassava starch [7]. It is noted that there is a slightly peak shift of the OH stretching vibrations of different PVA/starch blends appeared at this band. With the increase of LAE content, the peak shifted to a lower wavenumber, which could be due to the hydrogen bond interaction between PVA and starch. The characteristics peaks at 2945 cm−1, 2830 cm−1 and 2989 cm−1 are related to the CH stretching, symmetric and antisymmetric -CH2 stretching, respectively [7,32]. The peak observed around 1615 cm−1 is associated to the starch with bound water molecules, and the peak at 1006 cm−1 is assigned to the CO stretching vibrations of C-O-C groups in the glucose ring of starch. The CO stretching of acetate groups of PVA is located at 1149 cm−1. The shapes of these five curves are very similar, suggesting the addition of LAE has no significant influence on the molecular structure and the intermolecular interactions of the blend films."
13,XRD,"3.3 XRD The XRD patterns of the starch, PVA, PVA/starch control film and active films incorporated with different concentrations of LAE are presented in Fig. 3 . The diffraction peaks of starch granules were located at 2θ = 15.3°, 17.5°, 18.2° and 23.3° [43], the diffraction peak of PVA were located at 19.9°. After blending starch with PVA, the peaks of the starch disappeared and only the main diffraction peak at 19.4° to 19.6° of PVA remained, indicating the addition of starch did not affect the crystalline structure of PVA. The reason might be that the starch was gelatinized and the crystalline structures were destroyed during the blending process, resulting in the diffraction patterns of the blends were being dominated by the crystalline structures of PVA. Furthermore, there were no major changes of the diffraction patterns of the blend films in the presence of LAE. The CI of the control film and blend films with different additions (1%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%) of LAE were 12.09%, 11.87%, 12.37%, 12.45% and 11.44%, respectively. The CI values were close, indicating the crystalline structure of the blends were not significantly affected by the addition of LAE contents."
14,Thickness and mechanical properties,"3.4 Thickness and mechanical properties Thickness is one of the crucial parameters to determine the mechanical, optical and barrier properties of blend films. Table 1 lists the thickness values of the control and active films. It was found that thickness values ranged from 0.131 mm to 0.141 mm, and the thickness of the blend films was not significantly affected by the inclusion of LAE. This was in agreement with the results of Rubilar et al. [25]. In their work, LAE had a high solubility in the PVA/starch film matrix. In contrast, Haghighi et al. [32] reported that LAE might loosen the microstructure in the chitosan/PVA films, leading to an increase in the film thickness when using high concentrations of LAE. This inconsistency in different studies suggests that the fabrication process might strongly affect the thickness of blend films, despite the type of film matrix. Mechanical properties are important for evaluating the applicability of blend films as packaging materials. In addition, adequate tensile strength and extensibility are necessary for most food packaging applications [39]. The TS and EB of blend films with different LAE contents are shown in Fig. 4 . It is evident that the inclusion of LAE strongly influences the mechanical properties of blend films, with an increase in the concentration of LAE, while the TS (p ≤ 0.05) of the film decreased while the EB (p ≤ 0.05) increased. The presence of LAE slightly weakened the tensile strength of the blend films. The control film had the highest TS value, and decreased from 23.34 MPa to 17.25 MPa when incorporating 10% of LAE. This tendency of the tensile properties was consistent with the SEM analysis. The integrity and continuity of film matrix were destroyed by the incorporation of LAE, and small aggregates and pores emerged within the structure, thereby resulting in a decrease in the tensile strength [44]. Rubilar et al. [25] also reported that the inclusion of LAE reduced the tensile performances of chitosan-PVA films. The introduction of LAE significantly improved the extensibility of blend films. The EB value increased from 208.45% to 586.08% when adding up to 10% LAE in this work. It might be ascribed to the synergistic effect of acetic acid, glycerol and LAE. The addition of acetic acid improved the film-forming abilities of suspensions. The solubility of starch was increased and the apparent viscosity of the suspension was reduced, which led to the formation of a more cohesive and transparent gel structure [45,46]. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonds generated among glycerol, LAE and polymers substituted the intermolecular bonds in the polymer matrix, which promoted the sliding of long polymer chains during extension, and thus led to better flexibility of blend films [47]. The elongation properties of our active films were superior to some previous studies with similar formulas. The highest EB value of chitosan/PVA/LAE films prepared by Haghighi et al. was 39% [32], and the highest EB value of starch/LAE films prepared by Motta et al. was 119.63% [47]. It was also noted that the mechanical properties of our active films with LAE were comparable with the high density polyethylene (HDPE, 22 MPa, 500%) films widely used in the market. In previous studies, Haghighi et al. [39] reported that low content of LAE (0.1%, v/v) did not influence the mechanical properties of chitosan–gelatin active films. Rubilar et al. [25] found that the inclusion of LAE clearly increased both the TS and EB values of chitosan films. Moreno et al. [44] observed that the addition of LAE decreased the TS values and notably reduced the EB values when preparing films by compress molding. These controversial results in the literature indicate that the mechanical properties of active films containing LAE are determined by multiple factors, including the type of polymer matrix, the amount and conditions of LAE and other additives, as well as the fabrication process."
15,UV barrier properties and opacity,"3.5 UV barrier properties and opacity The light transmittances of the control and active films with different concentrations of LAE in the wavelength range between 200 and 800 nm are presented in Fig. 5 . It was found that the active films possess lower UV light transmittances (200–400 nm) as compared to the control film. At a wavelength of 200 nm, the light transmittance of active films was close to 0%, which means that active films performed as effective UV barriers. In food packaging applications, the excellent UV barrier properties of active films can help to prolong the shelf life of food products, and can reduce UV-induced oxidations, and preserve the nutrition, flavors and colors of foods [48,49]. In the VIS region (400–800 nm), the light transmittances of active films were slightly lower than that of the control film. At a wavelength of 800 nm, the light transmittance of the control film was 77.84%, and the light transmittances of active films (containing 1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10% LAE) were 74.53%, 74.25%, 72.80% and 72.45%, respectively. At the wavelength of 600 nm, the opacity value of our active films was 0.99, 1.10, 1.19 and 1.21, respectively, similar to the values of chitosan/PVA/LAE films and chitosan/gelatin/LAE films reported in previous studies [32,39]. Packaging materials were often used for wrapping different colors of food products. To evaluate the transparency of active films on different colors, color charts were printed on a white paper, pictures were taken when the color charts were covered by an active film, no film and a control film, respectively. Fig. 6 shows that all three color charts were clear, the clarity was slightly decreased when the charts were covered by the films. There was no significant difference of color, and the difference between color charts covered by the active film (a) and the control film (c) in the picture could be seen by the naked eye. This phenomenon observed in the picture was in agreement with transmittance results shown in Fig. 5. In general, with an increase in the LAE concentration, light transmittances of active films slightly decrease [39], likely due to the aggregation of LAE. Larger aggregates formed by more LAE inhibit light transmission. Transparency also plays an important role in food packaging, showing the original appearance of food to the consumers. Since the maximum transmittance of all active films in the VIS are higher than 70%, and their opacity values of them at 600 nm are less than 5, as shown in Table 2 , all active films obtained in our study can be considered as transparent [32]."
16,Moisture adsorption (MA) and water vapor permeability (WVP),"3.6 Moisture adsorption (MA) and water vapor permeability (WVP) Moisture adsorption and water vapor permeability are two significant factors that affect the performances of food packaging materials [25,50], so it is crucial to investigate the water barrier property of active films. Table 3 presents the MA values of the control film and active films with different concentrations of LAE. The addition of LAE led to an increase in MA values. The MA value of the control film was 17.54%, and that of the active film with 10% LAE content reached to 25.46%. This might be due to the high water affinity of LAE. The oil-water equilibrium partition coefficient of LAE was low (less than 0.1), which made it easy to capture the water molecules [25,26] . Fig. 7 shows the WVP of control films and active films with different concentrations of LAE. The incorporation of LAE led to higher WVP values. After 24 h, the WVP value of the control film was 8.32 × 10−12 g·m−1·s−1·Pa−1, while that of the active film with 10% LAE content was 1.56 × 10−11 g·m−1·s−1·Pa−1. Besides the hydrophilic properties of LAE, the water absorbed by starch and PVA during the swelling might break the hydrogen bonding and affect the crystallinity of PVA and create a less compact crystalline structure of the PVA matrix, thereby accelerating the movement of the polymer chains, resulting in an increase in the passage of water molecules [25,32]. Moreover, porous structures emerging in the active films with high LAE content might also promote the transfer of water molecules. We have compared the LAE-10% sample with reported composite based packaging materials in the literature (Table 4 )."
17,In vitro antimicrobial activity,"3.7 In vitro antimicrobial activity The antimicrobial properties of the control and active films with different concentrations of LAE against E. coli and S. aureus were assessed by disc diffusion assay. As shown in Table 5 , the control film did not exhibit inhibitory effects against the tested bacteria. No inhibition zone appeared in the TSA plate of the control film overgrown with E. coli and S. aureus, indicating that starch and PVA are not able to inhibit the growth of bacteria, as has been reported previously [55,56]. All active films containing LAE show antimicrobial effects. Moreover, the inhibition zones of tested bacteria gradually expanded with an increase in the LAE concentration. When the LAE concentration increased from 1% to 10%, the diameter of the inhibition zone increased from 12.2 mm to 29.07 mm for E. coli, and from 19.23 mm to 43.37 mm for S. aureus, respectively. The high antimicrobial efficiency of LAE could be ascribed to its role as an effective cationic surfactant on the cell membrane. Even at a low concentration, LAE can change the membrane potential and prevent the microorganisms from growing. When the concentration of LAE increased, the membrane structures were seriously destroyed, resulting in rupturing the entire cellular structures [28,29]. It was also found that E. coli showed better resistance to LAE than S. aureus in our study, which can be explained by the structural differences between these two bacteria. E. coli is a gram-negative bacteria with a thick layer lipopolysaccharide membrane outside of the cell, while S. aureus is a gram-positive bacteria only possessing a single peptidoglycan layer cell structure. It was more difficult for LAE to damage the membrane of E. coli [57]. The antibacterial performances of the active films in this work were superior to those previous studies using a hydrophobic polymer matrix [4,32], since the hydrophilicity of our film matrix can promote the diffusion of LAE in TSA plates [58,59]."
18,Conclusions,"In this study, blend films based on PVA/starch enriched with different concentrations of LAE (1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10%, w/w) were prepared by a casting process. SEM results showed that PVA and cassava starch were compatible, the addition of LAE changed the film morphology, and high content of LAE (5% and 10%) led to the generation of pores on the cross-section due to the surfactant effects. The molecular interaction, crystalline structure and film thickness were not significantly affected by the introduction of LAE. Incorporating LAE slightly decreased TS but significantly increased EB of the blend films, which might be ascribed to the aggregation and synergistic plasticizing effects of acetic acid, glycerol and LAE, respectively. The light transmittance values of active films with LAE were lower than those of control films in both the UV and visible light regions, suggesting that the active films had better UV and light barrier properties, which could help to prevent food products from degradation and oxidation. The incorporation of LAE resulted in higher MA and WVP values because of its hydrophilic nature and the increasing mobility of polymer chains. The active films showed antibacterial activities against both E. coli and S. aureus when including only 1% LAE, and they became more effective when the concentrations of LAE increased. The PVA/starch films containing LAE demonstrated potential as an active packaging material to effectively maintain the food quality and extend the shelf life. They are a promising alternative to replace synthetic plastics in certain food applications."
