0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of the world-wide economy and industrialization, fossil fuels based on coal, oil, and natural gas, which are non-renewable, have been fast depleted [1,2]. This fact leads to the energy crisis in the near future [3,4]. Meanwhile, these fossil resources release greenhouse gases that have been regarded as the major cause for global climate changes [5,6]. The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and environmental concerns have stimulated the development of sustainable energy sources that can replace conventional fossil resources [7]. Hydrogen has been considered as one of the most promising substitutes for fossil fuels due to its renewability and environmental friendliness [8–12]. One of the ideal approaches to produce hydrogen is based on water splitting by solar energy via photocatalysts [13–19]. However, traditional photocatalysts (such as TiO2 [17,18], CdS [13,15], and g-C3N4 [19–21]) suffer narrow light absorption, low charge separation efficiency, and poor surface reaction due to their unsuitable band structures, leading to the low efficiency of hydrogen production [22–25]. Consequently, the design of photocatalysts with suitable band structures is one of the challenging issues towards efficient hydrogen evolution. One way to handle the issue is to prepare photocatalysts coupled with cocatalysts to modify the band structure of photocatalysts. In doing so, noble metals, such as Au, Pt, Pd, and Ru, are usually used as cocatalysts [26–28]. However, most of these cocatalysts are designed as clusters with small sizes, and attached onto photocatalysts that have relatively large sizes [29–31]. Unfortunately, photogenerated electron-hole pairs still suffer from the rapid recombination within the large-sized catalyst nanoparticles when charges migrate from the generated sites to the active sites of cocatalysts. To solve the above problem, reducing the particle size to shorten the charge transfer distance is necessary. Herein, we propose a game-changing design by loading ultra-small photocatalysts onto relatively large-sized cocatalysts. The design merit lies in efficient charge separation and abundant active sites for the surface reaction. TiO2 has been extensively employed as photocatalysts for organic molecules degradation [32], H2 production [33], CO2 reduction [34] and N2 fixation [35] due to its excellent chemical and physical properties and stability. On the other hand, NiO and NiS2 have been used as excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts [36], and they can be used as noble-metal-free cocatalysts to provide a large number of active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Accordingly, in this study, we design our cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites using extremely small TiO2 quantum dots (∼ 3 nm) loaded onto the large porous NiO nanosheets (lateral size up to 6 μm). It has been found that, under solar irradiation, photo-excited electrons from ultra-small TiO2 photocatalysts can be rapidly transferred onto micro-sized cocatalysts to greatly decrease the recombination probability of photogenerated charges. Thus our novel design strategy has the potential to extend to other photocatalyst/cocatalyst systems to achieve high efficiency for H2 production, CO2 reduction and N2 fixation."
1,Experimental,
2,"Preparation of micro-sized Ni(OH)2, porous NiO and NiS2 nanosheets","2.1 Preparation of micro-sized Ni(OH)2, porous NiO and NiS2 nanosheets Micro-sized Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method [37]. Briefly, nickel nitrate hexahydrate (2 mmol), urea (24 mmol), and ammonium fluoride (12 mmol) were mixed in an 80 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring. After completely dissolution, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL of a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then the autoclave was heated at 150 °C and maintained at the temperature for 6 h in an electric furnace. After the autocalve was cooled down to room temperature, precipitates were collected and washed with water and ethanol several times and then dried at 80 °C overnight. Afterward, micro-sized Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were annealed at 500 °C under vacuum for 3 h in an electric furnace (SK-G05163, Tianjin Zhonghuan Furnace Corp) with a heating rate of 2 °C/min. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, micro-sized porous NiO nanosheets were obtained. Porous NiS2 nanosheets were obtained by further vulcanizing porous NiO nanosheets in the vacuum furnace at 400 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min under the protection of high-purity argon gas. The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of NiS2 nanosheets was shown in Figure S1 to demonstrate the good crystallinity after vulcanization."
3,Preparation of TiO2 quantum dots,"2.2 Preparation of TiO2 quantum dots Ultra-small TiO2 quantum dots were also prepared by a simple hydrothermal method [38]. In brief, aqueous solutions of TiCl3 (15 %, 2 mL) and HCl (6 M, 2 mL) were mixed together in a beaker with magnetic stirring. 50 mL of anhydrous alcohol was added. After continuously stirring for 3 h, the solution was then transferred into a 100 mL of a Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 90 °C in an electric furnace and maintained at this temperature for 3 h. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, precipitates in the autoclave were centrifuged by absolute ethanol for 3 times, and then dried at 80 °C overnight. White TiO2 powers were obtained."
4,Loading TiO2 quantum dots onto micro-sized porous NiO nanosheets,"2.3 Loading TiO2 quantum dots onto micro-sized porous NiO nanosheets TiO2 quantum dots and micro-sized porous NiO nanosheets were mixed in a beaker with an 80 mL of ethanol under rigorously magnetic stirring for 5 h. The solution was then transferred into a 100 mL of a Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 90 °C in an electric furnace and maintained at the temperature for 3 h. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, precipitates in the autoclave were centrifuged by absolute ethanol for 3 times, and then dried at 80 °C overnight. By changing the ratio of TiO2 quantum dots and micro-sized porous NiO nanosheets, a series of composites with different proportions were obtained."
5,Preparation of TiO2 quantum dots coupled with micro-sized porous NiS2 nanosheets,"2.4 Preparation of TiO2 quantum dots coupled with micro-sized porous NiS2 nanosheets The composites, TiO2 Quantum Dots Coupled with Micro-sized Porous NiO Nanosheets, were used as precursors. They were placed into a crucible at the downstream of an electric furnace and sublimed sulphur powers in another crucible were placed at the upstream. The sample was then annealed at 400 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min under the protection of high-purity argon gas. After cooling down to room temperature, TiO2 quantum dots coupled with micro-sized porous NiS2 nanosheets were obtained."
6,Material characterizations,"2.5 Material characterizations The microstructure of prepared samples was examined by an FE-SEM (FEI, Quanta FEG 650) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The high-resolution images were recorded by a TEM (FEI, Titan-Themis) operated at 300 kV. The crystal structure was recorded by XRD (Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer) with the Cu Kα radiation under the accelerating voltage of 40 kV and the applied current of 40 mA. Chemical compositions were analysed by EDS attached to TEM (FEI, Titan Themis). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) was recorded by an Shimazu UV-2600 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reference. The PL spectra were recorded by a Hitachi F-7000 with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm. The ESR spectra were recorded by an electron paramagnetic resonance A300−10/12 spectrometer (Bruker AXS Company, Germany)."
7,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity test,"2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity test In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 10 mg of the prepared photocatalysts were dispersed into a 30 mL of ultrapure water with the ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Then N2 gas was used to purge the solution for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen. Afterword, the solution was transferred into a closed Pyrex glass reactor (Labsolar 6A, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.) with an addition of the triethanolamine (20 mL) as sacrificial agent. The reactor was vacuumized by a connected pump and cooled by a cooling water system maintained at 5 °C during the whole experimental process. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the light source. Hydrogen production was recorded by a gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector with the high-purity argon as carrier gas. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated based on the following equation: (1) A Q E = 2 × t h e a m o u n t o f H 2 m o l e c u l e s N u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 %"
8,Electrochemical measurements,"2.7 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed by an Autolab PGSTAT302 N workstation using the conventional three-electrode cell. Carbon electrode was used as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. Working electrode was prepared on a cleaned F-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) glass. Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 M) was used as the electrolyte. 10 mg of obtained samples were dispersed into a 2 mL of the ethanol solution with 90 μL napthol by the ultrasonic treatment to form slurry. Afterword, the slurry was coated onto a 1 cm × 2 cm FTO glass and the working electrode was calcined at 100 °C for 30 min in an electric oven. The transient photocurrent response curves were recorded using a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source. Mott-Schottky plots were recorded in a three-electrode system by the Alternating Current (AC) frequency of 1500 Hz and 3000 Hz."
9,Charge flow tracking,"2.8 Charge flow tracking The photo-deposition method was used to load Pt and PbO2 onto TiO2 quantum dots coupled with micro-sized NiO porous nanosheets. In a typical Pt deposition process, 10 mg of the composites was dissolved into an 80 mL of deionized water under stirring with an addition of 1 wt.% Pt. Methanol was used as sacrificial agent. The solution was evacuated in a Pyrex glass reaction cell, and then was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp at 5 °C for 2 h. The precipitates were washed several times with deionized water and dried overnight at 60 °C in an oven. In a typical PbO2 deposition process, the procedure is similar to that of the deposition of Pt nanoparticles excepting that Pb(NO3)2 was used as Pb sources and NaIO3 (0.1 M) was used as electron acceptors."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Microstructural characterization,"3.1 Microstructural characterization Fig. 1 shows the structures of our designed cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites: large-sized NiO cocatalysts and ultra-small TiO2 quantum dots. Fig. 1a shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a micrometer-sized (∼ 6 μm) Ni(OH)2 plate with a hexagonal morphology. Its thickness is estimated as ∼ 70 nm according to the atomic force microscopy image as shown in Fig. 1b, suggesting that micro-sized Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were successfully synthesized. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1c (black curve) confirms that the obtained Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are the hexagonal structured phase (PDF-#73−1520). After annealing at 500 °C for 2 h, these nanosheets become cubic structured NiO (PDF-#78−0429) (refer to the red pattern in Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d shows a TEM image taken from a typical annealed sheet, and shows the micro-sized porous feature. Further verification can be found in Figure S2–S4 (scanning transmission electron microscopy high-angle annular dark-field (STEM-HAADF) images and Figure S5 (a high-resolution TEM image). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area based on Figure S6 was evaluated to be 228.6 m2/g, which is higher than reported results: 88 m2/g [39], 58.3 m2/g [40], 156 m2/g [41], and 81.4 m2/g [42]. In principle, such a micro-sized porous structure can expose more active sites for hydrogen evolutions [43]. On the other hand, Fig. 1e is a TEM image taken from the dispersion of TiO2 quantum dots on a thin carbon membrane, and shows a high density of as-prepared nanoparticles with the lateral dimension of ∼ 3 nm. The XRD study of these nanoparticles (blue pattern in Fig. 1c) indicates that they are tetragonal structured anatase TiO2 (PDF-#73−1764). Fig. 1f shows a high-resolution TEM image of as-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles randomly orientated, some showing their {101} atomic planes. By comparison, the size of TiO2 quantum dots is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of micro-scale porous NiO nanosheets. To demonstrate TiO2@NiO cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites, Fig. 1g is a STEM-HAADF image taken from the designed nanocomposites, and shows a high density of TiO2 quantum dots (bright spots, and an example is marked by a red circle) uniformly distributed in a NiO nanosheet. Fig. 1h is a high-resolution TEM image and shows both TiO2 quantum dots and their underlying NiO nanosheet (marked by arrows). Overall, as indicated in Fig. 1, we have successfully fabricated cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites containing ultra-small TiO2 quantum dots photocatalysts loaded onto the cocatalysts of micro-sized porous NiO nanosheets."
12,Photocatalytic performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic performance To evaluate photocatalytic properties of our designed cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites, hydrogen production was systematically examined. Fig. 2 a shows the hydrogen evolution as a function of the reaction duration, in which all plots show an approximately linear relationship, and all our cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites have enhanced hydrogen productions than the pure TiO2 quantum dots. Fig. 2b summarizes the hydrogen productivities after a 4-hr reaction. For pure TiO2 quantum dots, the hydrogen productivity is ∼ 203 μmol/g, comparable to the reported results [44,45]. With an addition of 3 wt.% NiO nanosheets, it reaches to ∼ 1656 μmol/g, ∼ 8 times higher than that of pure TiO2 quantum dots. This indicates that the incorporation of micro-sized porous NiO nanosheets can remarkably improve the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 quantum dots. To further demonstrate the impact of large-scale cocatalysts on photocatalytic properties, micro-sized NiO nanosheets with TiO2 quantum dots were further vulcanized into micro-sized porous NiS2 nanosheets because NiS2 is more conductive to the fast transfer of photogenerated electrons, thus they can achieve higher carrier separation and photocatalytic hydrogen productions than porous NiO nanosheets [46,47]. Fig. 2c shows the comparison of hydrogen productivities for pure TiO2, TiO2@NiO and TiO2@NiS2. With the incorporation of porous NiS2 nanosheets, the hydrogen productivity of TiO2@NiS2 can increase up to ∼ 3181 μmol/g, ∼16 times higher than that of pure TiO2 quantum dots. This result clearly indicates that large-scale cocatalysts can significantly enhance photocatalytic properties. The AQE in Figure S7 is ∼ 1.9 % excited by the wavelength of 350 nm. Wavelengths in the range of visible light show negligible contribution to AQE, indicating that TiO2 is mainly excited by UV light. To estimate photocatalytic stability of our cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites, cycling tests were performed. Fig. 2d shows the cycling experiments, in which no obvious degeneration of hydrogen productivities is seen. Moreover, we also tested the sample left in ambient air for over six months. Fig. 2e shows the comparison between the last cycle (the fourth cycle) in Fig. 2d and the test from the old sample (blue cycle). The fact that two curves nearly overlap with each other indicates the excellent stability of our cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites despite long-term exposure to ambient air. Furthermore, Fig. 2f shows the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with an even longer duration from the old sample (blue cycle in Fig. 2e). After continuous reaction for 20 h, the hydrogen productivity still maintains an excellent linear relationship, revealing that our designed cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites are stable and have excellent resistance to solar irradiation. In addition, we also performed XRD (Figure S8), SEM/TEM (Figure S9), and XPS (Figure S10) measurements of the optimized composite after cycling tests. No obvious change of microstructures and morphologies can be observed. This further demonstrates the good stability of our designed composites. The following experimental results show that the remarkably improved photocatalytic properties of our cocatalyst hierarchical nanocomposites are caused by the high-efficient charge separation. To evaluate the charge separation, we employed electrochemical and spectroscopic methods [48,49]. Fig. 2g shows the transient photocurrent response of TiO2, TiO2@NiO, and TiO2@NiS2, respectively. Comparing with pure TiO2 quantum dots, incorporating micro-sized NiO nanosheets shows an obvious improvement of the photogenerated current, and it is further remarkably enhanced by incorporating NiS2 nanosheets. This clearly indicates that higher charge separation is achieved by incorporating micro-sized NiO and NiS2 nanosheets. To further clarify the efficient charge separation, Fig. 2h shows their photoluminescence (PL) spectra, in which the PL intensity of the pure TiO2 quantum dots is the highest, indicating the strong recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The recombination can be evidently decreased by the incorporation of NiO nanosheets, and further alleviated by NiS2 nanosheets [49]. Indeed, these results indicate that efficient charge separation is critical for enhancing the photocatalytic properties, and can be achieved by incorporating micro-sized NiO and/or NiS2 nanosheets."
13,Identification of charge transfer route,"3.3 Identification of charge transfer route 3.3.1 STEM-HAADF characterization To identify the carrier transfer route between TiO2 quantum dots and porous NiO nanosheets, we need to determine the active sites of photogenerated electrons and holes and where they transported to, respectively. Since Pt3+ ions can be reduced into Pt particles by photogenerated electrons, they can be used as the indicator to trace the transferred route of photogenerated electrons. Similarly, Pb2+ ions can be used as the indicator of photogenerated holes as they can be oxidized into PbO2 particles. By directly detecting the sites of Pt and PbO2 particles, we can determine the active sites of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively [50]. Thus, we can identify the transfer route of photogenerated electrons and holes between TiO2 quantum dots and NiO nanosheets. To detect Pt particles, we intentionally prepared agglomerated TiO2 on NiO nanosheets. Fig. 3 a shows uneven distribution of TiO2 quantum dots on a NiO nanosheet, in which two areas marked with red and blue squares contain agglomerated TiO2 quantum dots and no TiO2 quantum dots, respectively. Fig. 3b shows the enlarged area of the red square in Fig. 3a, and Figs. 3c-d are the corresponding EDS elemental maps of Ti and Pt of the enlarged area, respectively. Fig. 3c confirms the agglomerated TiO2 quantum dots. Pt particles were also observed on agglomerated TiO2 from Fig. 3d, indicating existence of active sites for photogenerated electrons on TiO2. In comparison, Figs. 3e-h show the details from the blue square of Fig. 3a. As indicated in Fig. 3g, no TiO2 was found, but Pt particles can be clearly identified from Fig. 3h. This reveals that there exist active sites for photogenerated electrons on porous NiO nanosheets. Moreover, there are more active sites for photogenerated electrons on NiO nanosheets than on TiO2 quantum dots according to the general distribution of reduced Pt particles in Figure S11. This verifies the fact that porous NiO nanosheets provide dominating active sites for photogenerated electrons to reduce H+ into H2. To detect PbO2 particles, we also prepared agglomerated TiO2 quantum dots on NiO nanosheets as shown in Fig. 3i. To clearly observe PbO2 particles, Fig. 3j (the enlarged area of Fig. 3i marked by red) shows an atomic-scale STEM-HAADF image of a PbO2 particle with a tetragonal structure. The corresponding EDS elemental maps in Figs. 3k-m further confirm that it is a PbO2 particle. Furthermore, the corresponding low magnification STEM-HAADF image in Fig. 3n indicates that no PbO2 particles can be detected on NiO nanosheets after we carefully checked each area in Fig. 3n at a high magnification. The red arrows in Fig. 3n show that the white area is composed of TiO2 and PbO2. To further confirm the Pb signal, additional evidence was shown in Figure S12. Indicated by the EDS maps in Figure S12, Pb signal can be clearly identified, and PbO2 particles are mainly located on agglomerated TiO2 quantum dots, not on NiO nanosheets. This indicates that active sites for photogenerated holes are only on TiO2. Thus we can identify the carrier transfer route based on STEM-HAADF data as follows: photogenerated electrons transferred from TiO2 quantum dots to porous NiO nanosheets and photogenerated holes shift onto the surface of TiO2 quantum dots. This corresponds to the typical Z-scheme mechanism [36], as schematically shown in Figure S13. 3.3.2 Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization To further confirm the Z-scheme mechanism, we performed electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements on collective samples to avoid the localized effect of TEM characterization. We firstly investigate band gap energy of TiO2, NiO, NiS2, TiO2@NiO, and TiO2@NiS2. Fig. 4 a shows their UV–vis spectra, in which adsorption edges can be identified. Based on the UV–vis spectra, Fig. 4b shows the corresponding Tauc plots calculated by ( α h v ) 1 / n = A ( h v - E g ) [46], in which α, v, A and Eg represents the adsorption coefficient, light frequency, proportionality constant and band gap, respectively, from which the energy band gaps of TiO2 and NiO can be estimated as ∼ 2.94 eV and ∼ 3.1 eV, respectively. Flat-band potentials of TiO2, NiO, and TiO2@NiO were then determined by the Mott-Schottky plots, as shown in Fig. 4c-e. They were estimated to ―1.04 eV and 1.2 eV vs. saturated calomel electrode, respectively, which is equal to ―0.44 eV and 1.8 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Combined with the band gap energy of TiO2 and NiO, the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2 and NiO can be estimated to 2.5 eV and ―1.3 eV, respectively. As can be seen, the CB edge of NiO nanosheets is higher than that of TiO2 quantum dots, while its VB edge is lower than that of TiO2 quantum dots, indicating that there are two possible routes for the transfer of photogenerated electrons: from NiO to TiO2 to form p-n junction, or from TiO2 to NiO to form Z-scheme. However, the slope of Mott-Schottky plots in Fig. 4g shows no typical V-shape for TiO2@NiO even through the applied voltage is intentionally extended to be more positive, indicating that it is not a p-n junction [51]. Therefore, we anticipate that the charge transfer route in our hierarchical nanocomposites is based on Z-scheme: photogenerated electrons were transferred from TiO2 quantum dots to micro-sized NiO/NiS2 nanosheets. To further prove our anticipated charge transfer route, we performed the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to capture hydroxyl radicals ( OH) and superoxide radicals ( O2 −) by using DMPO spin-trapping agent [52,53]. Under dark conditions (without light), ESR signals can be negligible as indicated in Fig. 4f and g, suggesting that these radicals were generated under illumination. Fig. 4f clearly shows the characteristic 1:2:2:1 quadruple of DMPO- OH signals in TiO2 [44]. In contrast, no signal can be captured in NiO nanosheets, indicating that the oxidation process was performed on TiO2 through the consumption of photogenerated holes. As shown in Fig. 4g, weak DMPO- O2 − signals were observed in TiO2, while clear DMPO- O2 − signals were detected in NiO. Moreover, the intensity of DMPO- O2 − in NiO is much stronger than that of DMPO- O2 − in TiO2, suggesting that the reduction process was mainly performed on NiO nanosheets to consume photogenerated electrons. DMPO- O2 − and DMPO- OH signals can be simultaneously observed in our TiO2@NiO hierarchical nanocomposites, indicating that oxidation and reduction process were parallelly conducted in the composites. The spectroscopy data clearly demonstrate that photogenerated electrons are transferred from TiO2 onto NiO nanosheets to consume the photogenerated holes in NiO nanosheets, leaving respective photogenerated electrons in NiO nanosheets for hydrogen evolution and photogenerated holes in TiO2 quantum dots for the oxidation of sacrificial agents. Furthermore, EIS spectra in Figure S14 indicate that our TiO2@NiO hierarchical nanocomposites have relatively lower resistance of interfacial charge transfer comparing with that of TiO2 and NiO. LSV spectra in Figure S15 also reveal that our composites have a lower overpotential for hydrogen evolution. This further demonstrates that photogenerated electrons can be rapidly separated and transferred for efficient hydrogen evolution."
14,Photocatalytic mechanism,"3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism Based on the band structure analysis, Mott-Schottky plots and ESR analysis outlined above, Fig. 4h schematically illustrated the Z-scheme mechanism. When our TiO2@NiO hierarchical nanocomposites are exposed to solar irradiation, both TiO2 and NiO are in an excited state, leading to photogenerated electrons jumping from their VB to CB to realize charge separation, leaving holes in the VB. Excited electrons in TiO2 are then transferred onto the VB of NiO nanosheets to recombine with the holes in the VB of NiO, leaving photogenerated electrons in the CB of NiO and photogenerated holes in the VB of TiO2 to form Z-scheme. Due to the extremely small size of TiO2 quantum dots and relatively large size of porous NiO nanosheets, photogenerated electrons can be rapidly transferred onto the active sites of micro-sized NiO nanosheets to achieve fast charge separation, thus realizing highly efficient hydrogen evolution."
15,Conclusion,"A game-changing strategy is developed to design high efficient photocatalytic hierarchical nanocomposites, in which extremely small photocatalysts of TiO2 quantum dots were prepared and anchored onto micro-sized cocatalysts of porous NiO nanosheets. The size difference between photocatalysts and cocatalysts is in three orders of magnitude, promoting the highly efficient separation of photogenerated electrons from small-sized photocatalysts to large-scale cocatalysts. Comparing with pure TiO2 photocatalysts, the hydrogen production of our hierarchical nanocomposites improves ∼ 16 times without any addition of noble metals, clearly demonstrating the important role of our designed porous cocatalysts in the highly efficient charge separation. Our strategy provides a distinctive approach to design new kinds of photocatalysts with fast charge separation and greatly improved hydrogen evolutions."
