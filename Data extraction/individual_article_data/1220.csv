0,Introduction,"From the past decade, the green-house emissions crisis, rising sea levels and climate issues around the globe have become top priority issues of concern because of the exorbitant usage of fossil fuels [1,2]. Many renewable energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines and hydro power already exist, however, none of them have the versatility of hydrogen (H2). H2 has been regarded as a superior alternative to replace the fossil fuels due to higher energy density and no greenhouse emissions released upon combustion [3,4]. Additionally, H2 as a propellant has high benefits of transport and storage capability compared to traditional renewable energies. However, the only challenge is producing the H2 sustainably, as traditional methods of H2 production generates a high carbon footprint. Among the various renewable technologies, the most promising method to produce H2 is photocatalysis of water, because H2 can be generated from water using photocatalyst and sunlight [5]. Hence, photocatalysis of water is an emerging technology and has gotten noticeable attention of researchers, leading to the development of effective, reliable and sustainable photocatalysts to improve H2 generation via photo-technology [6]. By the usage of photons, the production of H2 can be cost effective and sustainable and can succeed to the replacement of fossil fuels, leading to decreased emissions such as CO2 [7]. Based on numerous studies by many researchers, the rate of H2 generation via photocatalysis of water is comparatively low as the photo-activity and reusability of semiconductors is not appreciably efficient [8]. However, efficiency of H2 generation using photo-innovative technology can be enhanced by modifying semiconductors and introducing electron donors such as alcohol which act as sacrificial reagents [9,10]. Out of the many photocatalysts, the first photocatalyst to be discovered is TiO2 and has been examined numerously due to low cost, non-toxicity, robust redox reaction and high reliability [11–13]. Recently development of carbon based photocatalysts for H2 production has gained such importance due to cost effectiveness and easily availability. Among them, graphite carbon nitride is extremely renowned [14]. However, g-C3N4 in its unmodified form show very low photoactivity because of fast recoupling of photo-produced charge carriers and low quantum effectivity. To solve these problems, numerous techniques have been formulated such as fabrication of nano catalysts, transition metals doping, coupling with semiconductors and surface photoreductions [15–19]. The introduction of other materials as impurities into g-C3N4 has been used to modify the photocatalysts as the impurities can alter the electronic structure. The presence of other materials such as semi-conductors can beneficially regulate the band gap, effectively increasing the optical absorption of light irradiation. Moreover, materials such as metals combined with the photocatalyst can be used as trapping sites for charge carries, effectively decreasing the charge recombination rate of electron hole pairs, as reported in previous literature [20–26]. Although substantial researches have been accomplished for the modifications of g-C3N4, modified g-C3N4 with well-controlled morphologies are still rare. Zhao et al. reported that an effective strategy is to construct nanostructure, which is a hard template approach, whereby it can be controllable and flexible to synthesize g-C3N4 with various morphologies in an accurate manner [27–31]. Nevertheless, this approach is more expensive and complex. One facile and effective strategy is metal doping and as seen from previous literature has proven to be better to non-metals coupled with photocatalysts as they assist to decrease charge reunification by emergence of localized states between CB and VB [32,33]. In this context, Tasleem and Tahir reported using Co and La as co-modification of g-C3N4 which resulted in 2.5 times higher H2 generation than pristine g-C3N4. Among the metals, nickel has been used as a co-catalyst by many researchers due to its many capabilities. Moreover, nickel has shown to improve photocatalytic H2 production capability and the usage of Ni as a single and bimetallic catalyst has been discussed by Wen et al. [34]. Shi et al. reported using Ni as an effective co-catalyst for increasing the dye degradation capability of TiO2 photocatalyst [35]. Additionally, Diego reported the use of Ni over graphene to enhance photochemical properties to obtain 1.98% higher quantum yield of CH4 [36]. More importantly, Yao Et al reported using Ni modification on TiO2 to increase the photocatalytic performance which resulted in about 2 times more H2 produced [37]. Hence, due to the versatility, regeneration capability and non-toxicity Ni is a promising element [38]. Ag is another metal that has been widely used as an effective co-catalyst from previous studies [39]. Saravanan et al. reported using Ag as a co-catalyst with TiO2 to obtain almost 4.8 times more H2 production than bare TiO2 [40]. Additionally, Wang et al. reported using Ag modification on g-C3N4 to obtain approximately 7 times H2 generation than pure g-C3N4 [41]. Due to the synergistic and surface plasmonic capability of Ag, Ag has shown to be a promising co-catalyst for effective H2 production. Furthermore, energized nano-composite synthesis has been shown to be a significant approach to improve the photocatalytic capability of g-C3N4. For example, various novel nanostructure photocatalysts have been synthesized in accordance with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties of metal nanoparticles. To the best of our knowledge, ternary Ni–Ag co-modified g-C3N4 nanocomposite fabricated by a photo-reduction method has not been explored before. Taking all of these into consideration, we have fabricated a Ni–Ag co-modified g-C3N4 heterogenous ternary composite and discussed their synergetic effects under visible light. A distinct Ni–Ag co-modified g-C3N4 composite was synthesized by a facile method and investigated for H2 production. Moreover, the new composite was fabricated by photo-reduction under visible light illumination to investigate the effect of photo-reduction towards H2 production. The photocatalytic reaction process is profoundly examined to understand the combination of synergistic and photo-reduction effect towards H2 evolution. The photo-catalytic H2 generation was conducted in a slurry photo-reactor using methanol-water mixture under visible-light irradiations system. Additionally, the effect of various operating parameters such as Ag loading, Ni loading, irradiation time, catalyst loading and sacrificial reagents have been investigated. Furthermore, the lifetime and stability test, was conducted to investigate the reusability and the effect of catalyst on the H2 production rate."

3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts 2.2.1 Synthesis of g-C3N4 g-C3N4 was fabricated by thermal treatment of melamine [42]. Usually, 10 g of melamine was added in a crucible with a lid and put inside a muffle furnace and heated to 550 °C for 2 h [43]. After cooled to room temperature, the pale-yellow graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) product was ground to obtain fine powder and was named as graphitic carbon nitride (CN) as demonstrated in Fig. 1 (a). 2.2.2 Synthesis of Ni modified g-C3N4 composite The preparation of Ni modified g-C3N4 nano-catalyst was conducted by a direct physical mixing approach as shown in Fig. 1(b). Various Ni (1, 3, 5 wt %) loadings to g-C3N4 were prepared by single step mixing. Typically, 0.5 g of g-C3N4 is dispersed in 20 ml of methanol and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Consequently, Ni(NO3)2 with various Ni loading (1, 3, 5 wt %) is added and stirred for a further 2 h [42]. The samples are then dried at 100 °C for 24 h and named as xNi/CN, where x is the (1, 3, 5 wt%) loading. Here, xNi and CN are abbreviation for nickel loading (NiO) and g-C3N4, respectively. 2.2.3 Synthesis of Ag modified g-C3N4 composite The preparation of Ag modified g-C3N4 nano-catalyst was conducted by a direct physical mixing approach as mentioned before and as illustrated in Fig. 1(c).

Consequently, AgNO3 with various Ag loading (1, 3, 5 wt %) is added and stirred for a further 2 h. The samples are then dried at 100 °C for 24 h and named as yAg/CN where y is the (1, 3, 5 wt%) loading. Here, yAg and CN is abbreviation for silver loading and g-C3N4, respectively. 2.2.4 Synthesis of Ni and Ag modified g-C 3 N 4 composite The preparation of Ni and Ag modified g-C3N4 nanocomposite was conducted by a direct physical mixing approach as demonstrated in Fig. 1(d). After successful fabrication and optimization of xNi/CN composite, various Ag (1, 2, 3 wt %) loading to xNi/CN were prepared by single step mixing. Typically, 0.5 g of g-C3N4 is dispersed in 20 ml of methanol and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Consequently, Ni(NO3)2 with Ni loading (3 wt %) is added and stirred for a further 2 h. Consequently, AgNO3 with various Ag loading (0.5, 1, 2, 3 wt %) is added and stirred for a further 2 h. The samples are then dried at 100 °C for 24 h and named as xNi-yAg/CN, where x is (1, 3, 5 wt%) nickel loading, y is (0.5, 1, 2, 3 wt %) silver loading. Here, xNi, yAg and CN is abbreviation for nickel loading (NiO), silver loading (Ag) and g-C3N4, respectively. 2.2.5 Synthesis of Ni and Ag modified g-C 3 N 4 photo-reduced composite The preparation of Ni and Ag modified g-C3N4 nanocomposite was conducted by a photo reduction method as illustrated in Fig. 1(e). Typically, 0.5 g of g-C3N4 is dispersed in 20 ml of methanol and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Next, Ni(NO3)2 with Ni loading (3 wt %) is added and stirred for a further 2 h. Consequently, AgNO3 with Ag loading (1 wt %) is added and stirred for a further 2 h. Afterwards, the sample is stirred under constant visible light irradiation for 30 min. Afterwards, the sample is dried at 100 °C for 24 h and named as xNi-yAg/CN-R where x is (1, 3, 5 wt%) nickel loading, y is (0.5, 1, 2, 3 wt %) silver loading. Here, xNi, yAg and CN is abbreviation for nickel loading (NiO), silver loading (Ag) and g-C3N4, respectively. Additionally, the R denotes photo-reduced composite."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization For identification of phase structure and phase transformation and, Xray diffraction (XRD) was performed using Cu-Kα radiation with λ = 0.154 nm operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphology of the samples, was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with ZEISS Crossbeam 340 instrument. FTIR spectra were performed using a PerkinElmer Spectrum instrument to obtain the infrared spectrum peaks. Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) analysis were investigated using Raman Spectrometer (HORIBA instrument) using 600 nm grating and 532 nm excitation source, respectively. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy of the samples in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm, were recorded using Cary 100 Agilent UV–vis spectrophotometer. Measurement of the specific surface area and pore size of the as-prepared catalyst samples were performed by BET analysis with nitrogen adsorption at 196.15 °C and degassing at 250 °C for 4 h."
5,Photoactivity test,"2.4 Photoactivity test The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions have been conducted in a photoreactor made from Pyrex glass at room temperature. A 35 W Xe lamp has been used as visible light source. 0.1 g of catalyst has been dispersed in a 140 ml methanol-water mixture solution (5:95 %v/v) and has been continuously stirred on a magnetic stirrer. The photoreactor has been fully covered with aluminium foil to concentrate the light intensity and prevent light irradiation from the surroundings. Before turning on the light source, N2 has been passed through the system for 30min at 15 ml/min to remove any previously stored gases. The flow of N2 has been continuous throughout the entire duration of the experiment whereby the N2 acts as an inert carrier gas. The hydrogen gas produced has been collected by a sampling bag which has been connected to the outlet of the reactor. The amount of hydrogen produced has been analysed at every 1-h interval using a thermal conductivity hydrogen analyser. The photocatalytic test under irradiation has been carried out for at-least 4 h. Then the aqueous solution has been tested by different sacrificial agents including (5 vol% methanol, 5 vol % glycerol, 5 vol% ethanol, aqueous solution). Manipulation of the catalyst loading (0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 g) has also been investigated to check the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production. At the end, stability test has been carried out for 4 cycles with 4 h each using the same operating parameters as photocatalytic hydrogen production activities evaluation. N2 gas has been flown through the system for 1 h after and before each experiment. After each experiment, the spent catalyst was dried at 100 °C for 24 h before each experiment in the 4 cycles."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy The XRD analysis for CN, Ag/CN, Ni/CN and Ni–Ag/CN photocatalysts are illustrated in Fig. 2 (a) The peaks in the XRD spectrum for g-C3N4 at 13.0° and 27.5° can be assigned to the (100) and (002) plane. The (100) corresponds with the closely-packed lattice structure, whereas (002) is associated to the conjugated planar ring. Upon Ni and Ag loadings onto the g-C3N4, no visible peaks were seen for both the elements possibly because the photocatalysts were overshadowed by the crystalline phase. This is also because of the inferior wt% of Ni and Ag in the Ni–Ag/CN composite. All of the photocatalyst samples showed no other visible peaks other than the peaks of g-C3N4 at 13.0° and 27.5°, thus demonstrating that the structure of g-C3N4 remained unhindered after modification and this is similar to the findings that has been discussed in the previous literature [44,45]. Fig. 2(b) depicts the Raman spectrum for observing structural alterations between pristine CN, Ni/CN, Ag/CN and Ni–Ag/CN modified g-C3N4. From the spectra analysis, the Raman peaks at 476 cm−1 and 1233 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching of g-C3N4 aromatic heterocycles and the peak at 706 cm−1 corresponds to the s-triazine ring as similarly reported by other researchers [46]. The absence of peaks at 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 in all samples confirm the complete conversion of melamine to g-C3N4 and indicates successful fabrication. Furthermore, in the cases of Ni/CN, Ag/CN and Ni–Ag/CN modified composites, the Raman peaks in the samples were identical, sharper, broader and longer, which indicates the successful modification of g-C3N4. Similar results have reported by other researchers in previous studies as well and evidently denotes successful preservation of g-C3N4 structure upon modification [46–48]. 3.1.2 FESEM and TEM analysis Fig. 3 denotes the FE-SEM photographs for CN, Ni/CN, and Ni–Ag/CN for distinguishing the morphology of fabricated photocatalysts. The aromatic rings of g-C3N4 containing 2D nanosheets can be seen in Fig. 3 (a). Fig. 3 (b and c) shows Ni modified g-C3N4 composing of various crystals and stacked nanosheets. Fig. 3 (d) shows Ag modified g-C3N4 containing nanosized stacked sheets and small defects. Fig. 3 (e and f) demonstrates the ternary Ni–Ag/CN composite composing of nanosized grouped layers and defects. Nonetheless, there is no evident presence of Ni or Ag due to their lower wt. % loading. It is noticed, that the topography and texture of g-C3N4 is slightly altered after modification as it contains holes or empty gaps created by the splitting of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Similar findings for g-C3N4 has been discussed similarly by other researchers [48]. The morphology of Ni–Ag loaded CN was further investigated through TEM analysis and the results are presented in Fig. 3(g–h). Fig. 3 (g) presents obvious nanosheets of g-C3N4 which are stacked together. Fig. 3 (h) presents high resolution TEM image, however, distribution of Ni and Ag was not identified. Similarly, lattice fringes of g-C3N4 were not obvious due to its amorphous nature. However, the presence of Ni and Ag over the g-C3N4 was identified by EDX mapping and XPS analysis. 3.1.3 Energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX) EDX mapping analysis was done to further investigate the distribution and conversion of Ni and Ag over g-C3N4. Fig. 4 (a–f) depicts the EDX mapping analysis and the elements discovered in Ni and Ag co-modified CN, including the dispersion of carbon, nitrogen, nickel, silver and oxygen as shown by green, cyan, dark blue, red and yellow colours, respectively. Fig. 4 (g) shows EDX map of Ni–Ag/CN in detail. Evidently, this confirms the presence of metal oxides (NiO) and oxygen vacancies on g-C3N4 as confirmed by the high amount of oxygen present in the sample. All of the elements from CN and Ni and Ag were recognized in the EDX analysis, indicating good conversion and dispersion of Ni and Ag on g-C3N4 nanosheets. 3.1.4 FT-IR analysis Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectra as well as the structural information. For g-C3N4, the sharp peak positioned at 834 cm−1 is attributed to the out-of-plane bending vibrations mode of triazine rings. The peak located at 1274 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of C–N–C or bridging C–NH–C bonds. Furthermore, the peaks at 1503 cm−1 and 1594 cm−1 corresponds to the general stretching vibrations of g-C3N4 heterocycles. Similar observations have been reported by many researchers [46,49–51]. There was no shift detected which confirms the effective modification of Ni and Ag on CN and the absence of any new peaks evidently confirms the framework of g-C3N4 was retained. Additionally, for the photo-reduced Ni–Ag/CN-R, since there were no shift or formation of any new peaks, it confirms that the photo-reduction method did not hinder the structural integrity of g-C3N4. 3.1.5 BET analysis The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were further obtained to understand pore structure as shown in Fig. 6 . The BET surface areas of the as synthesized Ni–Ag/CN samples are expected to be different for various elements and are presented in Table 1 . The BET surface area of the Ni/CN was 13 m2/g, whereas pristine CN has 5 m2/g. This shows, the modification of CN with Ni resulted in defects in the g-C3N4 nanosheets causing the surface area to increase. However, for ternary Ni–Ag/CN composite, the surface area was 9 m2/g which is greater than pure CN but lower than Ni/CN. This is due to the Ag or metal oxides filling the empty spaces. Clearly, the modified photocatalysts possessed the largest BET surface area due to the Ni or Ag modification increasing the number of pores existed at different size on the surface or between the layers, which may be potentially helpful for the photocatalysis. Many works have put forward that the high BET surface areas are the main influencing factor for the catalysis [46,52–56]. 3.1.6 XPS analysis The elements composition and state were further investigated using X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 (a) shows XPS spectrum of N 1s with binding energies 397.6, 398.9 and 401.3 eV, ascribed to N–H, N-(C)3 and C–NC, respectively [57]. The C 1s XPS spectrum in Fig. 7 (b) shows two obvious peaks with binding energies 284.6 and 288.1 eV, corresponded to surface C–C and N–CN, respectively [58]. Fig. 7 (c) shows XPS spectrum of Ag 3 d with two peaks centred at 367.4 and 373.4 eV, which are characteristics of silver in metallic state (Ago) [59–61]. Similarly, Ni 2p spectrum in Fig. 7 (d) presents four peaks with binding energies 853.4, 856.3, 862.4 and 872.9 eV. The peak at 853.4 eV was ascribed to metallic state of nickel (Nio). The peak at 862.4 eV belongs to satellite peak. The two peaks at 856.3 and 872.9 eV are the characteristics of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, attributed to presence of Ni2+ or NiO [62,63]. 3.1.7 UV–vis analysis The UV–vis diffuse reflectance and absorbance of CN, Ni/CN, Ni–Ag/CN and Ni–Ag/CN-R samples were obtained and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 8 (a). Evidently, Ni and Ag loaded CN and the ternary Ni–Ag/CN composite showed higher light absorption compared to the pristine g-C3N4 absorption peaks. The light absorption in the visible region was obviously enhanced in the photo-reduced Ni–Ag/CN ternary composite. However, there were no new peaks detected in the UV–vis spectra of both the Ni–Ag/CN composite samples which evidently confirms plasmon resonance due to Ag was not detected. Furthermore, it can be seen from Fig. 8(a) that no new peaks were formed which confirms the chemical and structural integrity of the ternary composite remained intact and was not damaged by the photo-reduction fabrication method. Using Tauc plot, the calculated band gap energies were 2.87, 2.90 and 2.91 for Ni–Ag/CN-R, Ni–Ag/CN and CN, respectively. It is seen that the co-modification of Ni and Ag on g-C3N4 showed no significant change in the band gap of g-C3N4. Fig. 8(e–g) depicts the illuminated photographs of the photocatalysts when excited with a laser beam of wavelength 532 nm. Even though no new peaks were observed in the UV–visible spectra in Fig. 8(a), the illuminations due to resonant oscillation of conduction electrons on Ni–Ag/CN-R were observed when the samples were illuminated with the laser. Evidently, the emitting of light was due to photon absorbed by reduced Ag particles and the darker areas were because of NiO layered over g-C3N4 nanosheets. Similar observations were reported in literature [9]. This could indicate a slight plasmon resonance, however, it is important to note that plasmon resonance was not detected by other characterizations. 3.1.8 Photoluminescence (PL) analysis Fig. 9 demonstrates the photoluminescence spectra of pristine CN and Ni/Ag modified CN samples excited at a wavelength of 532 nm. The photoluminescence spectra were done to estimate the charge carrier recombination for CN, Ni/CN, Ni–Ag/CN, Ni–Ag/CN-R. Typically, the greater intense and less intense peaks of PL spectra denote higher charge carrier recoupling and lower charge carrier recoupling, respectively. The PL spectra of all samples showed three notable peaks, the first peak in between 446 and 460 nm, the second peak centred between 487 and 498 nm and the third peak at 892 nm. The first peak corresponds to the CB-to-VB transition. In this study, CN exhibited the greatest peak intensity, denoting extremely fast charge carrier recoupling. Furthermore, modification with Ni showed a reduction in the peak amplitude, which denotes slower charge recombination rate than CN. Subsequently, the ternary composite, Ni–Ag/CN, showed a drastic decreased in the peak intensity, indicating a substantial increase in the charge separation due to the combined synergistic effect of Ni–Ag and electron transfer throughout the ternary composite. Evidently, this denotes the stabilities of photoelectrons and photo holes are improved for effective charge separation and transfer. However, it is worth mentioning that photo-reduction on Ni–Ag/CN depicted a slightly higher peak than the non-photo-reduced Ni–Ag/CN. The second and third peaks for all samples are possibly due to imperfections in g-C3N4 originating during the fabrication process. As mentioned in previous studies [48], these imperfections are what causes the recoupling of localized electrons. For example, Kumarisan et al. reported photoluminescence peak at 460 nm for g-C3N4 enclosed ZNO arising from zinc inherent defects [64]. Similar observations were also reported by other researchers [65,66]."
8,Photoactivity test,"3.2 Photoactivity test 3.2.1 Effect of Ag loading on the photocatalytic reactivity of g-C3N4 The H2 production capability of the photocatalysts were investigated using 5 vol % methanol in water solution under visible light illumination. The effects of various Ag loading (1, 3 and 5 wt %) on the photoactivity of g-C3N4 nanosheets (NS) has been illustrated in Fig. 10 (a). Using bare g-C3N4, low amount of hydrogen was generated, which was greatly increased by the modification of Ag on g-C3N4. The performance of 3 wt% Ag/CN (1405 μmolg−1h−1) was 10.60 folds higher than bare CN (132.5 μmolg−1h−1). This indicates that there is enhancement in the effectiveness of charge separation and transfer across Ag/CN composite because of the excellent electron conducting capability of Ag/Ag2O. Additionally, another reason 3 wt% Ag is the best composite is due to the higher silver loading resulting in higher catalyst loading, allowing for higher surface area for more efficient H2 generation. However, the decreased in performance after optimum loading of 3 wt% Ag is because of emerging charge carrier recombination centres at excess catalyst loading. This also may be due to blockage of light irradiation needed for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Similar observations in previous studies regarding metals including La, Co, Ni and Ag has been reported to improve photocatalytic H2 production [41,48,67–70]. 3.2.2 Effect of Ni loading on the photocatalytic reactivity of g-C3N4 The effect of different Ni loading (1, 3 and 5 wt %) on the photoactivity of g-C3N4 were also observed and results have been demonstrated in Fig. 10(b). The performance of 3 wt% Ni/CN (1502.5 μmolg−1h−1) was 11.34 and 1.07 folds higher than bare CN (132.5 μmolg−1h−1) and of 3 wt% Ag/CN (1405 μmolg−1h−1), respectively. This shows that Ni modified g-C3N4 nanocomposite has more effective separation and transfer of electrons than Ag modified g-C3N4 nanocomposite. This also indicates a better formation of p-n junction in NiO/CN as similarly reported in literature [71]. Using higher amount of nickel, the heterogenous formation of NiO on the g-C3N4 NS would be greatly enhanced, leading to effective charge separation with greater exposed catalyst active sites available for photocatalysis reaction to occur. On the contrary, the decreased in performance after optimum loading of Ni is due to emerging charge carrier recombination centres at excess catalyst loading. Another reason why this is possible is due to blockage of light irradiation needed for photocatalytic hydrogen production [72]. Similar trends of metal oxide coupling with semiconductors have been reported by many researchers. For instance, Shi et al. reported NiO/Ni2P/g-C3N4 resulted in 126 times greater H2 production rate than pure g-C3N4 [71,73–75]. Therefore, by comparing the Ag and Ni loadings, the optimum loading of 3 wt% Ni onto CN is reported. 3.2.3 Effect of Ni and Ag loading on the photocatalytic reactivity of g-C3N4 To evaluate the synergistic effect of Ni and Ag on CN and the successful formation of the ternary composite, optimum Ni loading of 3 wt% was used with different Ag loading (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 wt %) and examined for H2 generation as displayed in Fig. 11 (a). Intriguingly, the H2 generation rate was increased outstandingly using Ni–Ag combined as opposed to only Ni or Ag loading during fabrication. This indicates that co-modification of Ni–Ag on g-C3N4 was indeed successful and synergistic effects of the compounds in the composite could be attributed to a lower electron-hole recombination rate which surely contribute in the generation of H2. Clearly, all of the Ag loaded with Ni/CN nanocomposite displayed superior performances for photocatalytic water splitting of water to H2. Among the four Ag loadings, 3 wt% Ni/1 wt% Ag/CN produced the highest amount of hydrogen (2137.5 μmolg−1h−1) followed by 3 wt% Ni/0.5 wt% Ag/CN (1835 μmolg−1h−1) and 3 wt% Ni/2 wt% Ag/CN (1660 μmolg−1h−1), while 3 wt% Ni/3 wt% Ag/CN generated the lowest amount of hydrogen (1302.5 μmolg−1h−1). The 3 wt% Ni/1 wt% Ag/CN composite showed remarkable enhancement in H2 production which is 16.13 folds higher than pure CN. This is because of the synergistic charge transfer promoted by Ag and Ni from g-C3N4 where both the metal loadings act as electron trap. Furthermore, increased loading of Ag leads to increased surface area available for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, after optimum performance is reached, the performance deteriorates which is due to a smaller number of g-C3N4 NS available for charge transfer. This could also be because of emerging charge carrier recombination centres at excess catalyst loading, charge recombination between Ag and Ni, a decrease in exposed surface area and blockage of light irradiation. Hence, a ternary heterogenous nanocomposite with a good p-n junction between g-C3N4 and Ni–Ag has been achieved, which enables superior separation and transfer of charge carriers with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. 3.2.4 Effect of preparation methods on the photocatalytic reactivity of g-C3N4 To investigate the effects of different fabrication methods, the optimized composite 3 wt% Ni/1 wt% Ag/CN was chosen. Evidently, the irradiated (photo-reduced) ternary nanocomposite produced significantly higher H2 production rate than the nanocomposite without light irradiation. The effects of visible light illumination on the photoactivity of photo-reduced 3 wt% Ni/1 wt% Ag/CN along with comparison is shown in Fig. 11 (b). It can be seen that the 3 wt% Ni/1 wt% Ag/CN (5740 μmol/g) prepared using light reduction method exhibits remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic performance for H2 yield which is 1.25 folds and 18.82 folds higher than non-photo-reduced 3 wt% Ni/1 wt% Ag/CN (4605 μmolg−1) and pure CN (305 μmolg−1) respectively. Moreover, the production of H2 as illustrated in Fig. 11 (b) is seen to increase till the 3rd hour, this is because of the of the light irradiation reducing Ag2O in the ternary composite to Ag during the fabrication method, which results in a higher charge separation and transfer. This indicates the reduced Ag act as electron sinks to promote electron separation and transfer from the g-C3N4 to NiO and Ag in the ternary composite, which conclusively increased the electron separation efficiency and hindered any charge recombination rates. Additionally, performance comparison of present work with literature such as metal doping and different fabrication methods has been further presented in Table 2 . 3.2.5 Effect of sacrificial agents The effects of charge separation enhancers such as methanol, ethanol and glycerol towards dynamic hydrogen evolution over the photo-reduced, Ni–Ag/CN-R photocatalyst using 0.1 g of catalyst and N2 flow rate of 15 ml/min for 4 h of light irradiation, is illustrated in Fig. 12 (a–b) Evidently, H2 generation was improved using sacrificial reagents, which follows the order, methanol 2350 (μmolg−1h−1)> ethanol (1475 μmolg−1h−1)> glycerol (1335 μmolg−1h−1)> pure water (122.5 μmolg−1h−1). Using methanol sacrificial agent 23.27 folds greater H2 production rate was achieved in contrast to using pure water without any sacrificial agent under the same reaction parameters. This was due to more production of electron hole pairs generated in the presence of methanol. The H2 production rate using methanol was 2.13 folds and 1.93 folds higher than using glycerol and ethanol respectively. 3.2.6 Effect of catalyst loading The photocatalytic capability of photo-reduced, Ni–Ag/CN-R photocatalyst was examined further in depth, using various catalyst loading and the results are illustrated in Fig. 13 . According to Fig. 13(a), as catalyst loading increases, the amount of H2 produced increases, evidently due to greater exposed surface area and active sites available for photocatalysis to occur. However, it is also seen that at 0.2 g of catalyst, the H2 yield decreases, this is due to catalyst sticking on the sides of the reactor vessel resulting in obstruction of light irradiation. This can also be caused by the darkening of the solution which resulted in obstruction of uniform light penetration. In addition to that, as illustrated in Fig. 13(b), H2 produced per gram of catalyst declined with further increase in catalyst loading. Considering hydrogen productivity per unit weight of catalyst, ideally the photocatalyst can be illuminated by infinite amount of light for photon-induced incitation of electrons. However, more photocatalyst dosage decreased the overall exposed surface area and active sites available to light illumination and obstructed consistent light penetration and distribution across the catalyst surface. Hence, the emerging charge carrier recoupling centres per unit weight, inhibited the separation of electron-hole pairs as opposed to lesser catalyst loading. Therefore, it is revealed that optimum amount of photocatalyst is important in attaining greater efficiency towards H2 generation rate under visible light illumination. 3.2.7 Stability analysis The consistency and reliability of Ni–Ag/CN-R photocatalyst was further examined to assess the stability and recyclability for industrial usage. Four successive cycles were performed using the same operating conditions and the outcomes are displayed in Fig. 14 (a) After each experiment, the mixture was collected from the reactor, centrifuged and the solids acquired were dried at 100 °C for 24 h prior to the next successive experiment. All of the experimental analysis were performed using the same reaction parameters, using fresh 5 vol % methanol as the sacrificial agent with re-used catalyst. Obviously, constant H2 generation rate using the Ni–Ag/CN-R composite in multiple cyclic runs was attained. This validates greater catalyst stability over the illumination time and in multiple successive cycles as similarly described in literature. For example, Yang et al. reported no obvious reduction in photocatalytic stability for ZnAgIn5S8/g-C3N4 composite after three photocatalytic hydrogen production cycles for 15 h. Additionally, Wang et al. reported no significant decrease in TiO2/CdS composite photo-stability for hydrogen production rate after 5 cycle tests [83,84]. After the four successive experiments, the spent catalyst of Ni–Ag/CN-R was filtered, dried and analysed using FT-IR and UV–vis spectroscopy. FT-IR examination of the fresh and used Ni–Ag/CN-R catalysts are presented in Fig. 14 (b). From examining the FTIR analysis, it is seen that the peaks at 834, 1274, 1503 and 1593 nm remain unhindered and consistent as our previous discussion. This indicates that the structural properties on g-C3N4 remained intact. However, there was formation of two new peaks located at 3680 and 593 nm. The first peak at 3680 is due to the O–H bond stretching in alcohol and the second peak at 593 nm is due to alcohol OH out of plane bend [85], which in this context is possibly due to residual methanol from the surface of the spent catalyst. Fig. 14 (c) depicts the UV–Vis analysis of the fresh and spent Ni–Ag/CN-R catalysts. For the spent catalyst, it is seen that there were no new peaks formed which confirms that the structural integrity of the ternary nanocomposite remained intact. Furthermore, the absence of any new peaks confirms the Uv–vis analysis did not detect any plasmon resonance and evidently the spent catalyst does not show plasmon resonance."
9,Schematic mechanism for hydrogen production,"3.3 Schematic mechanism for hydrogen production The representational mechanism of H2 generation from methanol-water solution over photo-reduced Ni–Ag/CN nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 15 . In general, for the ternary composite as seen in Fig. 15(a–b), visible light illumination activated g-C3N4 and the photo-induced electrons were transferred from CB of g-C3N4 to Ag and NiO, where the NiO act as electron trap and attract electrons due to excellent electron transfer capabilities as seen in Eqs. (1) and (2). Additionally, the Ag with their delocalised properties [86,87] acts as electron sink to boost electron separation and transfer from g-C3N4 as shown in Eq. (3). Then the electrons in the NiO and Ag are used for conversion of H+ to H2 as shown in Eq. (6), whereas methanol acts as the hole scavengers and assists in converting photo-generated holes to H+ as shown in Eqs. (5) and (6). This is in correlation to the experimental results and could explain the increased H2 evolution rate for the photo-reduced Ni–Ag/CN-R sample, however, it is important to note that plasmon resonance of Ag NPs was not detected by the characterizations. In conclusion, significant increase in photocatalytic activity can be accredited to the successful p-n junction between g-C3N4 and NiO and electron sink of Ag. (1) g-C3N4 + hv → g-C3N4 (e− CB) + g-C3N4 (h+ VB) (2) g-C3N4 (e− CB) + NiO → g-C3N4 + NiO(e−) (3) g-C3N4 (e− CB) + Ag → g-C3N4 + Ag (e−) (4) H2O + g-C3N4 (h+ VB) → OH• + H+ (5) CH3OH + 6h+ VB + H2O → CO2 + 6H+ (6) 2H+ + 2(e−) → H2"
10,Conclusions,"A heterogenous ternary Ni and Ag modified g-C3N4, nanocomposite has been successfully synthesized using direct mixing and light-reduction method. Visible light incited photocatalytic H2 production over Ni–Ag/CN nanocomposite were successfully carried out. The photoactivity of Ni/CN was greater than Ag/CN. The Ni–Ag co-loaded onto CN displayed incredibly enhanced visible light photoactivity for H2 generation as opposed to CN with only single metal coupling (Ag/CN or Ni/CN). H2 evolution rate of photo-reduced 3 wt%Ni/1 wt%Ag/CN-R was approximately 17.73, 1.54, 1.67 and 1.10 folds higher than bare CN, 3 wt%Ni/CN, 3 wt%Ag/CN and non-photo-reduced 3 wt%Ni/1 wt%Ag/CN composite, respectively. Plasmon resonance was not detected by the characterizations, however, these improved photoactivities are attributed to the synergistic effects in co-deposited Ni–Ag and electron sink of photo-reduced Ag. This leads to enhanced visible light absorption due to improved charge separation in the photo-reduced Ni–Ag/CN-R composite based on higher electron transfer promoted by the Ag electron sink from g-C3N4 to NiO. The photocatalytic activity based on operating parameters were observed and out of the sacrificial agents, greatest H2 production rate was achieved using methanol as the reducing agent which is 19.18 times greater than using pure water. Among the catalyst loading, the highest H2 yield was obtained using 0.1 g of catalyst. Conclusively, synergistic effect between charge carrier separation, electron trap of NiO and electron sink of Ag can significantly improve the photocatalytic capability of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Hence, co-deposition of photo-reduced Ni–Ag could present a better and efficient approach to obtain energy from the sun."
