0,Introduction,"As a sustainable energy source, hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. It is a clean and environmentally friendly fuel, which produces only water after combustion. Biologically, hydrogen can be produced by photosynthetic and fermentative routes [1]. Fermentative hydrogen can be generated by various types of microorganisms. Clostridium spp. is one of those organisms capable of converting sucrose to hydrogen and carbon dioxide [2,3]. Although the yield of hydrogen production by Clostridium spp. is considered high, it still requires further improvement for industrial application. Immobilization technique is a practical tool used to enhance the activity of microorganisms involved in the fermentation systems [4,5]. The advantages of immobilized cells over free cells include more tolerant to environment perturbation, reusable, process stability and higher biological activity since higher cell density can be applied [6]. Therefore, immobilization could lead to a high production rate and might be the best choice in terms of the feasibility of large scale and continuous processing [7]. Support materials for cell immobilization can be synthetic polymers, such as alginate and polyvinyl alcohol, or naturally available, such as lignocellulosic materials from agricultural residues. Synthetic support materials have the advantage of high stability. However, there are some disadvantages such as high cost, low substrate conversion efficiency and toxic to microorganisms [8]. Therefore, there is an interest toward the use of natural materials for cell immobilization in order to overcome these problems. In this study, sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was used to immobilize the seed inoculum for hydrogen fermentation in order to improve hydrogen production efficiency as well as to facilitate the reusability of the cells. SCB is an inexpensive local-available material possessing the advantages of being highly porous and having a good water retention capacity. The additional advantage of using cellulosic materials as support material for cell immobilization is that the spent materials can be sent back to the hydrolysis process for sugar production, hence minimizing waste generation [9,10]. Sugarcane is one of the most important industrial crops in Thailand. It can be cultivated in all parts of Thailand, except in the south, with a cultivation area of more than 960,000 ha. Approximately 48 million tons of sugarcane are produced per year [11]. Sugarcane juice is mainly used to produce sugar. However, based on a report of the Office of the Cane and Sugar Board (Thailand), sugar production from sugarcane is greater than sugar consumption [9]. Therefore, this research was designed to investigate an alternative way to add value to sugarcane by producing clean and renewable energy i.e., hydrogen. The main sugar found in sugarcane juice is sucrose at an approximate concentration of 200 g/L. Sucrose was reported as a substrate for producing hydrogen by various types of microorganisms such as Clostridium butyricum CGS5 [3] and Thermotoga elfii [12], with the yields ranging between 1.39 and 2.00 mol hydrogen/mol hexose. Therefore, sugarcane juice has the potential to be used as substrate for hydrogen production. In the present study, the immobilization method was used to improve the hydrogen production efficiency in a batch system with an attempt to optimize the environmental conditions for hydrogen production. The optimum conditions obtained from the batch system were further used in repeated batch hydrogen fermentation with a variable medium replacement ratio in order to continuously producing hydrogen and to examine the reusability of the immobilized cells."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sugarcane juice,"2.1 Sugarcane juice Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum Linn.) was harvested from the field in Lopburi Province, Thailand. Sugarcane juice was prepared by crushing the sugarcane stalks in a squeezer and filtering through the sheet cloth, then kept at −20 °C. Frozen sugarcane juice was thawed at room temperature before use. The sugarcane juice consists of (all in g/L): sucrose, 199; glucose, 3.4; fructose, 3.2; with the total sugar concentration of 210 g/L."
3,Inocula,"2.2 Inocula C. butyricum TISTR 1032 was pruchased from the Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR), Thailand. The cultivation protocol was conducted following the method of Pattra et al. [13]."
4,Support material preparation and immobilization of C. butyricum,"2.3 Support material preparation and immobilization of C. butyricum SCB was used as a support material for cell immobilization. It was cut using a knife into small pieces (approximately 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm) and passed through a 0.5–1 cm sieve. Delignification of SCB was conducted followed the previous report [14]. Immobilization was conducted by adding 7 g dry weight of delignified SCB to 63 mL of Tryptone Sucrose Yeast Extract (TSY) medium [15] in a serum bottle, capped with a rubber stopper and an aluminum cap and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min before inoculation with 10% (v/v) of C. butyricum (final cell density of 106 cell/mL). The bottle was flushed with argon to create anaerobic conditions and incubated at 37 °C for 10 h at 150 rpm on an orbital shaker. After incubation, the culture medium was drained and the immobilized cells were washed three times with sterile 0.85% NaCl. The final cell number in the support material was approximately 107 cells/g dry wt of the support material. The SCB and immobilized cells were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-5410LV, JEOL, Japan) [16]."
5,Experimental procedure,"2.4 Experimental procedure The batch experiments for hydrogen production by free and immobilized C. butyricum were conducted by varying the initial pH and sucrose concentration in the substrate. Each 100 mL serum bottle with a working volume of 70 mL contained 60 mL of sugarcane juice, 7 mL of C. butyricum (107 cells/mL) as free cells or 7 g dry wt of immobilized cells (107 cells/g dry wt of support materials), 1.5 mL of 3.75% (w/v) L-cysteine as a reducing agent and 1.5 mL of nutrient stock solution [17]. After the replacement of the gas phase with argon to create anaerobic conditions, the serum bottle was incubated at 37 °C and 150 rpm for 24 h on the orbital shaker. All treatments were carried out in triplicates. The effect of initial pH was determined at an initial sucrose concentration in the culture medium of 25 g COD/L by varying the initial pH in the range of 4.5–7.0 in order to obtain the optimum pH for hydrogen production. The effect of the initial concentration of sucrose as the substrate assessed in the range of 20–40 g COD/L was further investigated at the optimum pH."
6,Reusability of the immobilized cells,"2.5 Reusability of the immobilized cells At the end of the batch experiment, culture medium in the serum bottle was replaced by 63 mL of fresh medium (60 mL of sugarcane juice, 1.5 mL of 3.75% (w/v) L-cysteine as a reducing agent and 1.5 mL of nutrient stock solution) with the optimum initial pH and sucrose concentration, then incubated at 37 °C and shaken 150 rpm for 24 h. The volume and content of biogas and VFAs and the sucrose concentration in the culture medium were determined during incubation. This process was repeated five times to determine the reusability of the immobilized C. butyricum for hydrogen production."
7,Repeated batch operation,"2.6 Repeated batch operation The repeated batch experiment was conducted in a 2 L glass bioreactor (Biostat B, B. Braun Biotech International, Germany) with a working volume of 1.5 L at the optimum conditions obtained from the batch experiment. Immobilization was conducted by adding 150 g dry wt of delignified sugarcane bagasse into 1.5 L TSY medium in the reactor, which was then autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. After sterilization, the reactor was inoculated with 10% (v/v) of C. butyricum (106 cells/mL). The reactor was flushed with argon through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate air filter to create anaerobic conditions. The reactor was operated at 37 °C using a temperature controller and a stirring speed of 50 rpm. A pH of 6.5 was maintained using the pH controller and 1N NaOH or 1N HCl. After an incubation period of 24 h, the culture medium was drained and the immobilized cells were washed three times with sterile 0.85% NaCl. The final cell number in the support materials was approximately 107 cells/g dry wt of support materials. The immobilized cells were used as inocula. The repeated batch experiment was first operated in batch mode by adding 1.5 L of substrate (1440 mL of sugarcane juice, 30 mL of 3.75% (w/v) L-cysteine as a reducing agent and 30 mL of nutrient stock solution) into the bioreactor containing immobilized C. butyricum; the operating conditions were set as described above. The medium replacement ratios were varied at 25%, 50% and 75%. The repeated batch fermentation was conducted by replacement of the fermented broth in the bioreactor with substrate at the designated medium replacement ratio every 24 h of reactor operation. Biogas production and liquid samples were investigated every 6 h until the cumulative hydrogen production and substrate consumption were stable."
8,Analytical methods,"2.7 Analytical methods Number of free cells in the culture broth was counted using a hemacytometer at 400 magnifications. To determine the cell number on SCB, 3 g of wet immobilized cells were taken from culture media and washed with sterile 0.85% NaCl solution three times. The washed immobilized cells were blended to small particles using a blender and then added to 25 ml sterile 0.85% NaCl solution and shaken at 250 rpm for 5 min in order to dislodge cells from the support materials. The cell number in the liquid portion was then counted using a hemacytometer. The biomass concentration was defined as the dry weight of cells (g) per volume of fermentation broth (mL). The dry weight of immobilized cells on sugarcane bagasse was assessed by measuring the difference in dry weight between the biomass-associated matrix and the matrix alone [18]. Sugarcane juice was filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane and analyzed by HPLC for glucose, fructose and sucrose concentrations. The HPLC analysis was carried out using an LC-10AD (Shimadzu, Japan) with a Pinnacle II Amino column (oven temperature 40 °C) using 80% acetonitrile as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a refraction index detector. The total sugar concentration in the sugarcane juice was a summation of glucose, fructose and sucrose concentrations obtained from HPLC analyses. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohol in the culture medium were determined by GC followed the method described by Pattra et al. [13]. The volumetric fraction of biogas (v/v) was determined by GC [13] and expressed as biogas content (%). In the batch experiments, the volume of biogas produced was measured by the plunger displacement method [19] and calculated by a mass balance equation previously described by Zheng and Yu [20]. The cumulative hydrogen production followed the modified Gompert equation (Equation (1)) [21]. (1) H ( t ) = P exp { − exp ( R m e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ) } where H is the cumulative volume of hydrogen produced (L), P is the hydrogen production potential (L), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (L H2/h), λ is the lag phase time (h), t is the incubation time (h) and e is the exp(1) = 2.718. A specific hydrogen production rate (SHPR) (mmol H2/g cell·d) was obtained by dividing R m by the cell dry weight (g cell). Hydrogen production (HP, L H2/L substrate) and the hydrogen production rate (HPR, L H2/L substrate·d) were calculated by dividing the hydrogen production potential (P) and maximum hydrogen production rate (R m ), respectively, obtained from the modified Gompertz equation by the volume of substrate (0.07 L). For the repeated batch experiments, the volume of biogas was continuously measured by a gas counter connected to the reactor head space. The gas counter was calibrated by injecting a known volume of argon into the head space to determine the volume of gas per count which allows the calculation of the biogas production rate (BPR) (L biogas/L substrate·d). In order to calculate HPR, the BPR was multiplied by the volumetric fractions of hydrogen in the biogas."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effect of initial pH and sucrose concentration on hydrogen production by free cells of C. butyricum,"3.1 Effect of initial pH and sucrose concentration on hydrogen production by free cells of C. butyricum The HPR was fairly high between 2.33 and 3.0 L H2/L substrate·d at the initial pH of 7.0 and 6.5, respectively. The highest HPR and HY of 3.0 L H2/L substrate·d and 1.33 mol H2/mol hexose consumed, respectively, were obtained at an initial pH of 6.5 (Table 1 ). Our results are similar to the findings of Jo et al. [4] who found that a pH of 6.3 was optimal for hydrogen production from glucose by C lostridium tyrobutyricum JM1. In addition, the pH range of 5.5–6.5 was reported as the optimal pH range for hydrogen evolution of anaerobic fermentative bacteria without the solventogenic phase [22]. A low HPR of 1.41–1.68 L H2/L substrate·d was observed when the initial pH values were between 4.5 and 5.5. An adjustment of the initial pH in fermentative broth by adding an acid to obtain a pH of 4.5–5.5 in the substrate might result in the protonation of undissociated weak acids in the medium, which can pass through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm. This can result in a loss of glycolytic enzymes and structural damage to the cell membrane, DNA and proteins. Consequently, the growth of the microorganisms was inhibited [23]. The effect of initial sucrose concentration on hydrogen production by free cells of C. butyricum was studied at the optimum pH of 6.5. The HPR and HY increased with an increase in the sucrose concentration from 20 to 25 g-COD/L (Table 1). A further increase in sucrose concentration greater than 25 g-COD/L resulted in decreased HP and HY suggesting a substrate inhibition occurred. An inhibitory effect of high substrate concentration generally took place in the fermentation process depending on type of substrate and microorganisms. An increase in substrate concentration increased hydrogen production up to a certain level. However, an excessive substrate concentration can cause a build-up of VFAs in the system, leading to a decrease in pH in the reactor which could inhibit the growth of hydrogen producing microorganisms [24]."
11,Effect of initial pH and sucrose concentration on hydrogen production by immobilized C. butyricum,"3.2 Effect of initial pH and sucrose concentration on hydrogen production by immobilized C. butyricum Immobilized C. butyricum on SCB showed a better performance on hydrogen production in comparison to free cells. HPR and SHPR values obtained from the immobilized cells were greater than those obtained from the free cells experiments (Table 1). However, HY obtained from the treatments with immobilized cells was not markedly different from those with free cells. The results suggested that the immobilization technique could improve the hydrogen production efficiency of C. butyricum. An improvement was underlined at the unfavorable conditions i.e., low initial pH of 4.5–5.5 and high initial sucrose concentration of 30–40 g-COD/L. The fairly high HPR of greater than 2.0 L H2/L substrate·d was obtained from the immobilized cells while a decrease in HPR from 3.0 to less than 2.0 L H2/L substrate·d was observed with free cells. The results implied that the immobilized C. butyricum on SCB is more tolerant to the harsh condition and can produce hydrogen at the wider ranges of pH and sucrose concentrations than free cells. These results also suggested the advantage of using immobilized cells in the large scale for hydrogen production. Support material, SCB, might act as the protective agent against the adverse environmental conditions. Sorption of substrate to the support material might facilitate the mass transfer and accession of the cells inside the support material to the substrate, hence enhancing the rate of hydrogen production. Since the highest HPR and HY of 3.11 L H2/L substrate·d and 1.34 mol H2/mol hexose consumed, respectively, were achieved at an initial pH of 6.5 and initial sucrose concentration of 25 g-COD/L, the further investigations on the reusability of immobilized cells under these optimum conditions were conducted over five runs. The result indicated that the immobilized cells can be reused over five runs in batch fermentation without a reduction in HY and HPR (Fig. 1 ). On the fifth repeated run, C. butyricum could still survive and the cell density in SCB was increased (Fig. 2 c). The results indicate the potential of using immobilized cells of C. butyricum on SCB for long term hydrogen production processes."
12,Soluble metabolite products (SMPs),"3.3 Soluble metabolite products (SMPs) At the optimum initial pH of 6.5, the main metabolite in the fermentative broth was HBu with concentrations in the free and immobilized cell experiments of 83% and 86%, respectively (Table 2 ), suggesting butyrate type fermentation. Ethanol and butanol were observed in the fermented broth at the end of incubation indicating the occurrence of a solvent phase which took place when VFAs were accumulated in the hydrogen production system of Clostridia species [25]. A butyrate type of hydrogen fermentation was also found in all treatments. High HBu/HAc ratios of 3.21 and 3.99 were obtained from free and immobilized cells, respectively, at sucrose concentration of 25 g-COD/L (Table 2). At the high sucrose concentration of 30–40 g-COD/L, the higher concentrations of VFAs, especially HAc, were observed in the treatment with immobilized cells. This revealed that the immobilized cells are tolerant to the accumulation of HAc better than free cells. Thus, it suggested that the product inhibitory effect were lessened by the immobilization method. A low sucrose degradation efficiency of approximately 50% was found in all treatments (Table 2). The produced VFAs led to a decrease in pH of the fermentation broth to less than 4.5 (Table 1), which could inhibit the growth and metabolism of the cells as described above."
13,Repeated batch hydrogen production,"3.4 Repeated batch hydrogen production A maximum HY was obtained with a medium replacement ratio of 50% (Table 3 ). Increase or decreased medium replacement ratio resulted in a reduction in HY. Increased the medium replacement ratio meant that organic loading rate (OLR) was increased. The higher OLR leaded to higher VFAs production and accumulation. This can cause metabolic shift from acidogenesis to soventogenesis which is the route of microorganisms to prevent the obstructions in their metabolic flux. With this kind of metabolic shift, substrate and additional free electrons from NADH were consumed to produce neutral organic solvents such as alcohols which can cause the reduction in HY [26,27]. The possible reason that lower medium replacement ratio decreased HY is increased inhibition by products accumulation since less amount of fermented broth was removed from the reactor compared to higher medium replacement ratio. As described above, the accumulation of metabolite products i.e., VFAs could lead to a metabolic shift from acidogenesis to soventogenesis, hence decreasing HY. The maximum HPR of 3.50 L H2/L substrate·d was obtained with a medium replacement ratio of 75%. Decrease medium replacement ratio to 50 and 25% resulted in significant decrease of HPR. Lower substrate loading rate caused by decrease medium replacement ratio could bring the fermentation system to a substrate deficient state and lower the specific microbial activity [28]. This can cause a reduction in HPR. According to these results, if HY is considered as the most important parameter for hydrogen production, the optimum medium replacement ratio would be 50%. However, if HPR is considered, the optimum medium replacement ratios would be 75%. VFAs production in the repeated batch experiment was predominantly comprised of HAc and HBu (Table 3). HBu was observed as the main product in every medium replacement ratios in the repeated batch experiment. An HPR of 3.50 L H2/L substrate·d with a 75% medium replacement ratio and HY of 1.52 mol H2/mol hexose consumed at a 50% medium replacement ratio in the repeated batch fermentation compared very favorably to those reported in the literature (Table 4 ). It worths noting that most studies were conducted using sugar as the substrate."
14,Conclusion,"The efficiency of hydrogen production from sugarcane juice by C. butyricum, particularly the HPR, was enhanced by immobilization technique. The immobilized cells on SCB can tolerate the harsh environment and produce hydrogen at the wide ranges of pH and sucrose concentrations better than the free cells. Immobilized cells could be reused up to 5 runs without the reduction in HPR and HY. Considering that the SCB is a low cost and locally available, the use of immobilized C. butyricum on SCB might be practically and economically attractive for industrial scale hydrogen production."
