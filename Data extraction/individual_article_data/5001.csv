0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) are two main gaseous energy carriers and have been widely used in chemical and process industries because of their high calorific values of 143 kJ g−1 (H2) and 55 kJ g−1 (CH4) (Mishra et al., 2017). Mixing those two gases at a certain ratio, for example H2 (10–30%) and CH4 (75–90%), creates “Hythane” (Bolzonella et al., 2018). Hythane with addition of H2 into CH4 can reduce carbon emission, increase burning speed, extend flammability range, and enhance combustion efficiency to assist methane combustion (Huang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2013; Mohseni et al., 2012; Sen et al., 2016). The production of hythane can be accomplished by using electrochemical processes, steam-reforming systems, wind-generated electricity systems, etc. (De Falco et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2017; Menanteau et al., 2011). Different CH4/H2 ratios will have different applications. For example, 10% H2 addition was found to be most suitable for biogas fueled spark ignition engines (Porpatham et al., 2007), and 30% H2 adding to CH4 could achieve reduction of both particulate and NOx emissions in a diesel engine (Zhou et al., 2014). Therefore, adjustable CH4/H2 ratios during hythane production will offer more flexibility and control for its practical applications (Liu et al., 2013). Hythane can also be produced via biological processes, named “biohythane”. A typical production method is based on a two-stage anaerobic fermentation process: a dark fermentation step (for hydrogen production) followed by a second anaerobic step (for methane production) (Hans and Kumar, 2019). Biohythane is of great interest due to its advantages of waste conversion to energy and generally low cost (Liu et al., 2016). However, the two-step process faces challenges among which maintaining a flexible and controllable CH4/H2 ratio is difficult. Some parameters such as pH, retention time, and reflex ratio, may be employed to regulate the CH4/H2 ratio, but the accurate control regime is yet to achieve (Huang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2013) and some tested strategies were not effective. For example, when the recirculation rate of a methanogenic effluent increased from 15 to 50%, the H2 content was varied only in a small range of 9.07 ~ 13.36% (Sompong et al., 2016). Increasing the hydraulic retention time from 2 to 7 days has decreased the maximum H2 content in an anaerobic fermentation system 8.6 to 0% (Vo et al., 2019). Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) have been studied as an emerging approach to produce biohythane, in a system like microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) (Liu et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2017). An MEC profits from the activity of anode-respiring bacteria in anodic biofilms to break down organic matter and harvest electrons that are used at an abiotic cathode to produce H2, or at a biotic cathode to produce CH4 (Carmona-Martínez et al., 2015; Zhang and Angelidaki, 2014). Compared with traditional anaerobic digestion, MECs could achieve a biohythane production rate as high as 148 L m−3 d−1, 80% higher than that from anaerobic digestion (Liu et al., 2016). A variety of substances can be used in MECs to produce biohythane, such as waste sludge and waste aquatic weed Lemna, to achieve the recycling of resources and potentially reduce the economic cost (Kaur et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2016). Recently, a large-scale MEC of 19 L was demonstrated for biohythane production, and encouraged the further efforts of scaling up MEC-based biohythane production (Luo et al., 2017). MECs can be modified to be microbial electrosynthesis systems (MES) by using microbial biocatalysts to convert inorganic carbon into different chemical products, such as methane, acetate, butyrate, formate, different alcohols (Mayer et al., 2019). In a typical CH4-producing MES, electrochemically active microorganisms (mainly methanogens) accept electrons from a cathode electrode to reduce CO2 to CH4 (Li et al., 2019b). The reaction can be catalyzed via two different mechanisms, i.e., direct ( 8 H + + CO 2 + 8 e - → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O ) and indirect ( 4 H 2 + CO 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O ) extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathways (Li et al., 2019b). Theoretically, methane electrosynthesis from the reduction of CO2 can occur under standard conditions by direct EET at a potential of −0.244 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), or indirect EET at −0.410 V vs. SHE (Zhen et al., 2016). A previous study has demonstrated the control of biohythane composition by adjusting current generation in a two-chamber MEC (Luo et al., 2017). However, some serious limitations were also observed in that system including competition between an anode electrode and methanogens for electrons and impurity in methane gas. To address those issues, herein a dual-cathode BES was developed and capable of both methane production in a cathode containing methanogens and hydrogen production in a regular abiotic cathode, supported by electrons from the same anode. The specific objectives of this study were to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of biohythane production in the dual-cathode BES; and (2) manipulate the CH4/H2 ratio by adjusting the external resistance."
1,Materials and methods,
2,BES setup,"2.1 BES setup A flat plate BES reactor consisted of an anode chamber and two cathode chambers, physically separated by two pieces of cation exchange membrane (CEM) that had the same cross-sectional area of 125 cm2 (25 cm × 5 cm) (Membrane International Inc., Ring-wood, NJ, USA) (Fig. 1 ). Such a design of two cathodes has also been reported in microbial fuel cells (Pasupuleti et al., 2016). The liquid volume of the anode chamber was 150 mL, and each of the cathode chambers contained 80 mL of catholyte. The anode electrode was made of non-wet-proof carbon brush, which was pre-treated by being soaked overnight in acetone and then heated at 450 °C for 0.5 h. The wet-proof carbon cloth (25 cm × 5 cm, Zoltek Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as the cathode electrode, which contained 0.5 mg cm−2 Pt powder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)."
3,BES operation,"2.2 BES operation The BES was operated in a batch mode and at a room temperature of ~21 °C. The anode chamber was inoculated with 20 mL of anaerobic sludge (Peppers Ferry Regional Wastewater Treatment Authority, Radford, VA), and fed with a synthetic solution containing (per L of distilled water): sodium acetate, 1 g; NH4Cl, 0.15 g; NaCl, 0.5 g; MgSO4, 0.015 g; CaCl2, 0.02 g; NaHCO3, 0.1 g; K2HPO4, 5.3 g; KH2PO4, 2.6 g; and trace element, 1 mL (He et al., 2005). The anode hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set at 24 h throughout the entire experiment. The operation of cathodes went through three phases: (i) both cathodes were started to produce hydrogen gas; (ii) one of two cathodes was converted to methane-producing cathode by being inoculated with anaerobic sludge to introduce methanogens; and (iii) the external resistance of the H2-cathode was varied at 10, 22, 27, 120, 220, 270, and 330 Ω, while the external resistance of the CH4-cathode was fixed at 10 Ω. The H2-cathode used phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with a concentration of 50 mM as the catholyte, while the CH4-cathode was fed with a catholyte that contained (per L of distilled water): NaHCO3, 0.85 g; NH4Cl, 0.5 g; NaCl, 2.25 g; MgSO4, 0.244 g; CaCl2, 0.189 g; K2HPO4, 0.35 g; KH2PO4, 0.23 g and trace element (Silveira et al., 1991). The anolyte and H2-cathode catholyte were flushed with nitrogen gas for 10 min to remove oxygen before starting the BES operation. The CH4-cathode catholyte was flushed with a nitrogen and carbon dioxide mixture gas (N2/CO2, 80:20 v/v) for 20 min to supply the inorganic carbon for methane production before starting an operational cycle (Zeppilli et al., 2017). Two cathodes are connected to the anode separately by linking to a power supply that provided 0.80 V (3644 A, Circuit Specialists, Inc., Mesa, AZ, USA), and an external resistance was placed between the negative pole of power supply and the cathode electrode to control the current generation."
4,Measurements and calculations,"2.3 Measurements and calculations The voltage across external resistance was monitored and recorded every 2 min by a digital multimeter (2700, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). The pH was measured by using a pH meter (Oakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). The concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured by using a DR/890 colorimeter (HACH Co., Ltd., USA). The volume of gas production was measured by a water replacement method and the gas composition was analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (GC) (Focus GC, Thermo Scientific, USA). To remove CO2, the produced gases from the cathodes went through an absorption bottle that was filled with 150 mL 0.1-M KOH (Luo et al., 2017). Current density (Iv , A m−3) was calculated based on the liquid volume of the anode chamber (Call and Logan, 2008). The total coulombs (TC, coulombs) was calculated according to TC = ∫ 0 t U R ex d t , where U is the measured voltage across the external resistor (V), R ex ( R e x _ H 2 o r R e x _ C H 4 ) is the external resistance of either the H2-cathode or the CH4-cathode (Ω), and t is the operation time (s). The gas production rate ( Q gas , L m−3 d−1) was the gas production per anode liquid volume per time: Q gas = V gas V a × T , where V gas is the H2 or CH4 production volume (mL), V a is the anode liquid volume (m3), and T is the time period of one cycle (d) (Yang et al., 2017a). The yield of hydrogen gas ( Y H 2 , mol H2/mol acetate) was estimated based on the amount of H2 produced by the consumed acetate (Hou et al., 2014). Cathodic gas recovery ( R cat , %) was calculated based on the recovered electrons as energetic gases (H2 or CH4) compared to the current transferred: R cat = bF n gas ∫ 0 t I d t × 100 % , where b denotes the number of electrons transferred for the production of the mole of energetic biogases ( b H 2 = 2 , b CH 4 = 8 ), F is the Faradic constant (96485 C per mol e−1), n gas ( n H 2 or n CH 4 ) is the mole of the produced energetic biogases, I ( I H 2 o r I C H 4 ) is the current of either the H2-cathode or the CH4-cathode (A), and t is the time in seconds (Yang et al., 2017a). The energy efficiency relative to the electrical input ( η E , %) was the ratio of energy content of energetic biogases produced to the input electrical energy and calculated by η E = n gas Δ H gas ∫ 0 t ( I E ap - I 2 R ex ) d t × 100 % , where Δ H gas ( Δ H H 2 or Δ H CH 4 ) is the combustion heat of H2 and CH4 ( Δ H H 2 = 285.83 k J mol - 1 and Δ H CH 4 = 890.31 k J mol - 1 ), E ap ( E a p _ H 2 o r E a p _ C H 4 ) is the applied voltage of the H2-cathode or the CH4-cathode (V). The overall energy efficiency relative to the total electrical input (include H2-cathode and CH4-cathode) ( η E _ t o t a l , %) was calculated as η E _ t o t a l = n H 2 Δ H H 2 + n CH 4 Δ H CH 4 ∫ 0 t ( I H 2 E a p _ H 2 - I H 2 2 R e x _ H 2 ) d t + ∫ 0 t ( I CH 4 E a p _ CH 4 - I CH 4 2 R e x _ C H 4 ) d t × 100 % . The overall energy efficiency relative to the substrate (acetate) input ( η S , %) was calculated as η S = n H 2 Δ H H 2 + n CH 4 Δ H CH 4 n S Δ H S , where n S and Δ H S are the amount of acetate consumed (mol) and the combustion heat of acetate ( Δ H S = 870.28 k J mol - 1 ), respectively. The overall energy efficiency based on the inputs of both total electricity and substrate (acetate) ( η E _ t o t a l + S , %) was calculated as η E _ t o t a l + S = n H 2 Δ H H 2 + n CH 4 Δ H CH 4 ∫ 0 t ( I H 2 E a p _ H 2 - I H 2 2 R e x _ H 2 ) d t + ∫ 0 t ( I CH 4 E a p _ CH 4 - I CH 4 2 R e x _ C H 4 ) d t + n S Δ H S × 100 % (Logan et al., 2008)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Start-up of the dual-cathode BES,"3.1 Start-up of the dual-cathode BES The performance of the dual-cathode BES was established with hydrogen production in both cathodes. As shown in Fig. 2 , current generation gradually reached stable and exhibited repeated performance with both cathodes, although there was a difference in the level of current generation likely caused by the difference in cathode electrode preparation: the maximum reproducible current densities of the left cathode were 49 ± 3 A m−3, higher than 34 ± 4 A/m3 with the right cathode. Repeated and stable current generation indicated that the electrochemically active bacteria (EABs) in the anode biofilm have been initially developed and exhibited some activities (Li et al., 2019a). As expected, the catholyte pH increased from 7.06 ± 0.24 to 10.65 ± 1.36 (left cathode) or from 7.06 ± 0.24 to 10.31 ± 0.6 (right cathode) within a 24-h operation cycle. Both cathodes have successfully produced hydrogen gas and the H2 production rate of the left cathode was higher than that of the right cathode (1.5 ± 0.1 vs. 1.2 ± 0.1 mol H2 mol−1 acetate). The total amount of H2 production in the present BES was comparable to that in a two-chamber MEC using acetate as the substrate (Liu et al., 2005) (2.9 mol H2 mol−1 acetate). The cathodic hydrogen recovery of the left and right cathodes reached 74 ± 3 and 61 ± 3%, respectively (inset, Fig. 2). The energy efficiency relative to the electrical input of the left cathode was 144 ± 5%, which was 17% larger than that of the right cathode in the BES (inset, Fig. 2), and in general those energy efficiencies were comparable to that reported in literature (Lu and Ren, 2016). Over 100% energy efficiency indicated that the recovered H2 contained more energy than the energy input by the externally applied voltage (Lu and Ren, 2016). The above performance has demonstrated that the dual-cathode BES was functional to produce hydrogen gas."
7,Biohythane production,"3.2 Biohythane production The functional BES was then converted to produce biohythane by inoculating its right cathode with anaerobic sludge, which was to develop a methanogenic population (“CH4-cathode”). Meanwhile, the left cathode was still to produce hydrogen gas (“H2-cathode”) and used to adjust electron distribution (via external resistance). Current generation with the converted cathode was not obviously affected (Fig. 3 A); in fact, current generation with both cathodes became higher at 70 ± 11 A m−3 (H2-cathode) or 76 ± 7 A m−3 (CH4-cathode), compared to that of the BES before conversion (Fig. 2). That was likely due to the continuing development of the anode EABs that provided more electrons to both cathodes. This result also indicated that introducing microorganisms (via formation of biofilm on the surface of the cathode electrode) did not inhibit abiotic catalysis of proton reduction (Li et al., 2019a). The occurrence of biocatalysis with the CH4-cathode (e.g., enhanced current generation) was not observed, but such a process was not excluded either (warranting further investigation). The conversion phase was transited to the biohythane phase with a decrease of hydrogen production and an increase of methane production (Fig. 3B). During this transition, current generation remained relatively stable with peak current density of 76 ± 6 A m−3 (H2-cathode) or 77 ± 6 A m−3 (CH4-cathode). The results of gas production are shown in Fig. 3B. During the conversion phase, the H2 production from the CH4-cathode was 283 ± 34 L m−3 d−1, significantly higher than 180 ± 15 L m−3 d−1 in the H2-cathode; this enhancement was possibly related to dark fermentation H2 production from the inoculated sludge (Hans and Kumar, 2019; Liu et al., 2005). With the consumption of organic matters in the inoculated sludge and evolvement of methanogenic population, the H2 production in the CH4-cathode started to decrease to zero on the 12th day and the production of CH4 occurred after the 7th day since inoculation. Thereafter, CH4 gradually reached 33 L m−3 d−1 on the 12th day. During the initial biohythane phase, the biogas produced in the CH4-cathode contained close to 0 of H2 and 25 ± 3 L m−3 d−1 of CH4. Theoretically, 4 mol H2 or 8 mol protons (H+) can produce 1 mol CH4 (Villano et al., 2010). Assuming that the CH4-cathode, in the absence of a methanogenic population, could produce a similar amount of H2 to that of the H2-cathode, it was estimated that the theoretic production of CH4 in the CH4-cathode as 44 L m−3 d−1, higher than its actual production rate of 25 L m−3 d−1. This difference is likely related to that the right cathode, which was converted to the CH4-cathode, had a weaker performance of hydrogen production than the left cathode (H2-cathode) (Fig. 2). Meanwhile, in the H2-cathode, the H2 production rate remained stable at 176 ± 13 L m−3 d−1. Those results have demonstrated that the dual-cathode BES was able to successfully produce both hydrogen and methane gases to make biohythane."
8,Flexible control of biohythane composition,"3.3 Flexible control of biohythane composition The biohythane composition during the initial phase (Fig. 3B) was 13% CH4 and 87% H2. A high external resistance results in a high cell voltage, while the circuit current is low, thereby limiting the amount of electrons transferred to the cathode for the production of hydrogen (Sun et al., 2009). This principle was used to increase CH4 production by varying the external resistance of the H2-cathode at 10, 22, 27, 120, 220, 270, 330 Ω; in this way, more electrons could be diverted to the CH4-cathode that had a fixed external resistance of 10 Ω. The peak current density of the H2-cathode decreased from 77 ± 6 to 18 ± 1 A m−3 with the increase of external resistance from 10 to 330 Ω, while the current density of the CH4-cathode increased to from 76 ± 6 to 97 ± 6 A m−3 at the same time (Fig. 4 ). This indicates the redistribution of more electrons to the CH4-cathode. As a result, the TC accumulation of the H2-cathode decreased by188 C with increasing the external resistance from 10 to 330 Ω, and the TC of the CH4-cathode increased by 64C. In the present BES, two cathodes shared one anode and also competed for electrons from the same anode. The higher external resistance has weakened the ability of the H2-cathode to obtain electrons from the anode, thereby enhancing the possibility of the CH4-cathode to receive more electrons. However, the decreased TC of the H2-cathode was not fully used by the CH4-cathode and there was a loss of 124 C. It is likely that the driving force (electron demand by the H2-cathode) provided to the anode decreased while the other cathode could not consume the additional electrons, resulting in weaker activities of the anode (likely related to its community change) and leading to an overall loss of electrons. It is also possible that electron loss occurred during hydrogen conversion to methane in the CH4-cathode. The exact reasons warrant further investigation. Adjusting the external resistance of the H2-cathode has clearly affected the gas production and composition (Fig. 5 ). The hydrogen production rate of the H2-cathode decreased from 173 ± 11 to 8 ± 2 L m−3 d−1 with the increase of external resistance from 10 to 330 Ω, while the methane production rate of the CH4-cathode increased from 25 ± 3 to 90 ± 5 L m−3 d−1 at the same time (Fig. 5A). The overall biohythane production rate decreased from 197 ± 11 L m−3 d−1 (10 Ω) to 98 ± 2 L m−3 d−1 (330 Ω), because that the conversion of H2 to CH4 has decreased the gas volume (according to 4 mol of H2 to 1 mol of CH4). The proportion of H2 in biohythane decreased from 87 ± 1 to 9 ± 2%, while the methane contribution increased from 13 ± 1 to 91 ± 3% (Fig. 5B). With more electrons transferred to the CH4-cathode, more hydrogen gas would be produced and then converted by methane by methanogens (Chae et al., 2010). The biohythane production in the present dual-cathode BES is comparable to that of two-stage fermentation reported in the literature. For example, the present BES produced 462 L kg COD−1 at the external resistance of 47 Ω, comparable to 452 L kg COD−1 using glucose as substrate or 403 L kg COD−1 using lactose as substrate from a two-stage fermentation (Ghimire et al., 2017); however, the hydrogen content in the biohythane of the present BES was high and this could be adjusted by external resistance. Although the overall production rate of biohythane decreased (due to hydrogen conversion to methane), the obtained biohythane at high external resistance would be more applicable to the available natural gas engine technology. The optimal hydrogen ratio in biohythane for different engine systems are different, for example 10% for the turbocharged intercooler spark ignition engines, 20% for the single-cylinder engines, and 30% for the diesel engines (Porpatham et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2014). Although a low ratio of hydrogen content is usually preferred in biohythane (Zhou et al., 2014), there are some studies showing potential benefits of high hydrogen contents. For example, 55% hydrogen addition may significantly improve the engine lean burn ability in a turbocharged lean burn natural gas engine (Ma et al., 2010), and 70% hydrogen addition was useful to reduced CO emission in a direct injection diesel engine (Mansor et al., 2017). Therefore, it is important to control CH4/H2 ratio flexibly and accurately, and the proposed dual-cathode BES is capable of accomplishing this. Further analysis of conversion efficiency showed that the cathodic gas recovery of the H2-cathode decreased from 77 ± 6% to 13 ± 4% and the CH4-cathode exhibited increased gas recovery from 26 ± 3% to 84 ± 11% (although insignificant difference between 270 Ω and 330 Ω) (Fig. 6 A). The energy efficiency relative to electrical input of the H2-cathode with external resistance between 10 Ω and 220 Ω was more than 100%, but became 84 ± 12% (i.e.,16 % energy loss) and 54 ± 14% (i.e.,46 % energy loss) at 270 Ω and 330 Ω, respectively (Fig. 6B). The increase of external resistance also increased the ohmic loss of the circuit of the H2-cathode (Lee and Rittmann, 2010), which could reduce energy efficiency due to energy loss. The energy efficiency of the CH4-cathode with external resistance between 120 Ω and 330 Ω was more than 100%, but was lower at 42 ± 5% (i.e., 48% energy loss), 70 ± 4% (i.e., 30% energy loss) and 91 ± 3% (i.e.,9 % energy loss) at 10 Ω, 22 Ω and 47 Ω, respectively. The energy efficiency of the CH4-cathode could have two types of loss: first, it had a weaker performance of hydrogen production than the H2-cathode (Fig. 2), which made the CH4-cathode difficult to compete with the H2-cathode in accepting electrons and production gas; and second, the conversion of hydrogen to methane would have additional energy loss due to the limitation of biological activities. The overall energy efficiency was estimated based on total output (sum of hydrogen and methane gaseous energy) and three sets of inputs, electrical energy input, acetate input, and the sum of both electrical energy and acetate (Fig. 6C). The one relative to the total electrical input increased from 85 ± 5% (i.e., 15 % energy loss) at 10 Ω to 124 ± 13% at 330 Ω. The overall energy efficiency relative to the substrate input was relatively stable at 69 ± 4%. The overall energy efficiency based on both electrical and substrates inputs was in a range of 37%–47%. The increased energy production with the CH4-cathode likely compensated for the energy loss of the H2-cathode with the increase of its external resistance, resulting in minor variation in overall energy efficiency."
9,Perspectives,"3.4 Perspectives Although the present BES has demonstrated the capability for flexible control of CH4/H2 ratio through integrated bio/electrochemical and biological process, further development of this system must properly address several key issues/challenges. First, adjusting the external resistance of the H2-cathode is a “passive” approach to redistribute electrons by weakening the H2-cathode. This has resulted in loss of energy efficiency. Developing a stronger CH4-cathode for competing electrons and/or cultivating a more robust anode to provide more electrons may avoid the sacrifice of the H2-cathode performance. Second, another factor causing energy loss is the conversion of produced hydrogen gas to methane in the CH4-cathode. This conversion is a biological process and will inevitably have energy loss related to microbial activities. Direct methane production without the need for hydrogen production may eliminate such a loss. It has been demonstrated that some methanogens can perform direct extracellular electron transfer for methane production (Villano et al., 2010). Thus, it is of strong interest to convert the CH4-cathode to a methanogenic biocathode. Third, in the present study, CO2 was added externally to the CH4-cathode for methane production. It requires a precise control of CO2 input to minimize its residue in the produced CH4 and thus to reduce the post-removal of CO2 from CH4. Although the source of CO2 could be readily available, for example combustion flue gas, the anode of the present BES also produces CO2 as a result of organic oxidation. It has been demonstrated in an MFC that the anode – generated CO2 could be captured and used to support algal growth in its cathode (Wang et al., 2010). The similar concept may be applied to the CH4-cathode to achieve “zero CO2 emission” from the proposed BES. Fourth, the fluctuation of organic matter in the influent can affect the production of gaseous energy (a common issue for a biological conversion system using low-grade substrates such as wastewater). This may be addressed by the post steps such as storage and transportation that would involve volume adjustment and stabilization. Last but not least, controlling the composition of biohythane by adjusting the external resistance was performed manually and such a method would not be convenient for actual operation. In a previous study, it has been demonstrated that an automated control system could be applied to manage the periodic polarity reversal in a dual-cathode MEC (Yang et al., 2017b). Such an automated control system may be modified to control the resistance variation, depending on the anticipated CH4/H2 ratio through involving sensing technology and data-driven approaches."
10,Conclusions,"This study has demonstrated that a dual-cathode BES could successfully produce biohythane whose composition was controlled by adjusting the external resistance for electron re-distribution. This re-distribution has clearly affected the production of both hydrogen and methane gases and led to a higher percentage of methane in biohythane by weakening the hydrogen producing cathode. Although the overall biohythane production rate decreased with increasing the external resistance, the produced biohythane composition would be more applicable to the existing natural gas engines. This BES -based biohythane system may be advanced by addressing the issues such as energy loss, CO2 capture and automatic control."
