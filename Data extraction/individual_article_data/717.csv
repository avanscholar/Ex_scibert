0,Introduction,"Over the past few decades, adverse environmental has been impacted by the discharge of organic wastewater which is not fully mineralized are garnered increasing attention (Ganiyu et al., 2018; Miklos et al., 2018). These wastewater comprised endocrine disrupt compounds, antibiotics, pesticides, textile effluents, etc., which possessed the characteristic of highly resistant to conventional treatment and persistence in the environment (Lan et al., 2016; Ganiyu et al., 2018, 2021, 2021; Qamruzzaman and Nasar, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a). For instance, there only 5–10 mg L−1 dye dissolved in water can already cause evident color for long-standing. Even if these emerging contaminants (ECs) are relatively low in the water, nonetheless, they may still have adverse impacts on human health through the food chain enrichment (Gomes et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2021). Among all the degradation method of organic wastewater, Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are capable of mineralizing organic wastewater, which are irreplaceable through other treatment methods. Electro-Fenton (EF) advanced oxidation technology as a kind of AOPs, based on the electrochemistry method, can indirectly generate hydroxyl radicals (·OH) from the cathode in an electrolytic cell. More specifically, on the surface of cathode, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) situ production via two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2-electron ORR) (Eq. (1)); and in Fe2+ catalyst, producing powerful oxidant ·OH (Eq. (2)). ·OH can nonselectively degrade organic pollution into small organic molecules even salts and CO2 by addition, substitution, bond breaking and other reactions (Zhang et al., 2015, 2019a, 2019a; Lai et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021). This H2O2 situ production process can address the challenges of transportation and storage of unstable. In addition, Fe3+ can be regenerated on the cathode surface (Eq. (3)). (1) Ο 2 + 2 Η + + 2 e − → Η 2 Ο 2 (2) F e 2 + + H + + H 2 O 2 → F e 3 + + H 2 O + ⋅ O H (3) F e 3 + + e − → F e 2 + The yield of H2O2 usually depended on the cathode's surface property. Thus, in the process of EF technology, pollution mineralized kinetics mainly depended on the selection of cathode materials. Carbonaceous materials have the advantages of corrosion-resistant, environmentally friendly, and so on. Motivated by these outstanding advantages, carbonaceous materials such as carbon felt (Zhang et al., 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2020), graphite felt (Lai et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2021), normally used for cathode materials. However, the production of carbon fiber and graphite fiber originally employed for structure materials. Given this demand, high-temperature graphitization treatment become the necessary technology of carbon felt and graphite felt synthetic, which endowed the inert and hydrophobicity onto their surface. Obviously, this is a disadvantage for their employed for EF cathode, and thus, surface modified is of vital significance for these material. One of the methods of carbonaceous materials surface modification is doping with hetero-atoms (Li et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2021). Hetero-atoms doped in carbonaceous materials can adjust the electronic structure of their surface, led to π-orbital electrons delocalized in their graphitic domains, which may acted as reactive sites for 2-electron ORR (Lu et al., 2018). Recently, such as N, O, P, S, were introduced into the surface of carbon fiber and graphite fiber (Zhou et al., 2019a). Li et al. reported that introduced N/P atoms on activated carbon fibers by used high-temperature treatment, which demonstrated higher H2O2 production and higher methylene blue (MB) removal (Li et al., 2020). O doping is usually employed for carbon fiber and graphite fiber treatment also. On the cathode surface, oxygen-containing groups at the edge of sp2-hybridized of graphite were beneficial for end-on mode adsorption of O2 molecule, which promoted 2-electron-reduction path generated H2O2 (Zhang et al., 2015; 2019b; Miao et al., 2014). Hence, various of treatments such as electrochemical oxidation (Zhou et al., 2013a; Miao et al., 2014), air calcination (Zhang et al., 2019b), oxidation by concentrated strong oxidants (Lu et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), and introduced graphene oxide (GO) to the surface of cathode (Akerdi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020) etc. were extensively applied for carbonaceous materials modification. These modification methods mentioned above not only enhanced H2O2 electrochemical synthesis yield, but also improved the kinetics of contaminant degradation. In addition, most noteworthy, carbonaceous materials doped by O possessed a significant advantage that would not induce secondary contamination in electrochemical reactions. Wang et al. confirmed that the degradation of cathode performance due to decreased carboxyl groups on the surface of cathode (Wang et al., 2019), rather than the hazardous material infiltrated into the electrolyte. Electrochemical oxidation technology was widely employed for the surface modification of carbon fiber and graphite fiber, which could make for evidently physico-chemical property changed on the surface of fibers (Meng et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2013a; Sun et al., 2019; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019). In addition, previous literatures reported that the anodic oxidation of graphite fibers and graphite felt can realize commercial process (Fu et al., 2019; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019). Significantly, there was a different variation of anodic oxidation on fibers surface when used by the diverse electrolyte. In previous research, this was revealed by the study of carbon fiber/epoxy composites (CFRPs) (Liu et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2018). Although anodized graphite felt by Na2SO4 aqueous solution has been used for electrode material and fully investigated the degradation of p-nitrophenol successfully (Zhou et al., 2013a). Nevertheless, the influence of graphite felt cathode anodized by various electrolyte type used for EF reaction hasn't been investigated. Herein, we reported graphite felt anodized in NaOH, NH4HCO3, and H2SO4 aqueous solution to construct defects, employed for electrochemical in-situ synthesis H2O2 and enhanced water treatment. In this work, the degradation efficiency of system used rhodamine B (RhB) as the model pollutant were studied. The defects of graphite felt cathodes were characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The degradation of RhB evaluated by ultraviolet spectroscopy and Total organic carbon analysis (TOC). Moreover, the influences of various experimental conditions, such as current density, Fe2+ concentration, initial pH values were systematically investigated systematically."

Subsequently, rinsed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. We marked these materials GF-A, GF-B, and GF-C, respectively. The unmodified graphite felt marked as GF."
3,Electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 and degradation of RhB,"1.3 Electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 and degradation of RhB The electrochemical generation of H2O2 and degradation of RhB employed by elctrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai, China). The experiment adopted a three-electrode system in a 200 mL single-compartment cell, the reference electrode was saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and platinum wire electrode (length: 45 mm; diameter: 0.4 mm) was used for the counter electrode.

5,Results and discussion,
6,Electrogeneration of H2O2,"2.1 Electrogeneration of H2O2 The yield of H2O2 was of vital significance for the degradation of pollution. Fig. 1 a showed the concentration of H2O2 electrogeneration in the cell via graphite felt and modified graphite felt under 0.4 L min−1 O2 flow rate and −0.6 V (vs. SCE) at pH = 3. It was observed that the concentrations of H2O2 for GF, GF-A, GF-B, GF-C were 6.9, 44.1, 89.6 and 110.5 mg L−1, respectively. The increased production of H2O2 after treatment indicated that anodic oxidation of graphite felt enhanced the kinetics of 2-electron ORR for H2O2 generation. This was due to the oxygen-containing groups and defects generated from modification. Normally, these groups that existed on the surface of the cathode might act as the stems of catalysis (Liu et al., 2015). In addition, the concentration of accumulation of H2O2 showed a linear increase, which was the strong proof of the stability of electrosynthesis process. As shown in Fig. 1b, compared with the CE among four cathodes. GF-C owned the highest CE during the electrocatalysis reaction indicated the highest selectivity of H2O2 generation among these cathodes. The experiment process adopted chronoamperometry (dates recorded frequency: 0.1 s−1), and i-t curve as shown in Fig. S2. As can be seen clearly from Fig. S2, compared with the raw graphite felt, the response of current density of modified cathode enhanced during the electrolysis reaction, which was the major reason of H2O2 yield improved, also. Meanwhile, this phenomenon confirmed that the modification improved the electron transfer speed of the interface between the cathode surface and electrolyte. To further investigate the mechanism of modified graphite felt enhanced H2O2 production, Raman spectroscopy was employed for characterizing the structural defects. There are D band and G band located approximately 1350 and 1590 cm−1 (Fig. 1c), and the fitting result as shown in Table S1. The G band attributed to the Raman-active vibration of mode E2g belonged to the graphite unit cell, which was the evidence of the sp2 - hybridized carbon existed in graphite planes. The D band originated from the defects in the carbon fibers. Therefore, the ratio of ID/IG is extensively utilized to describe the degree of defects in carbon materials (Liu et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2019; Vatankhah et al., 2019). Through the modification, NaOH and NH4HCO3 solution turned brown, but H2SO4 solution color kept unchanged (Fig. S3). That's because the fragments fell off from the surface of the fiber and dispersed in electrolyte (Neffe, 1987; Sun et al., 2019). It is wildly believed that the carbon fiber formed by graphite crystals and amorphous carbon, and amorphous carbon are more easily stripped from the surface due to their instability compared with the graphite crystals. In NaOH and NH4HCO3 solution, OH− anion generated by electrolytic action could be stripping amorphous carbon due to the small anion size, however, this phenomenon couldn't appear in H2SO4 solution (OH− < 0.28 nm, SO4 2− diameter 0.60 nm). More specifically, OH− could intercalate the interlayer of the graphite crystals and amorphous carbon, where the OH− is reduced to oxygen (O2). The produced O2 molecule exerted force toward van der Waals bonding between the internal structure of amorphous carbon, resulted in the stripping phenomenon (Parvez et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019). Conversely, the oxidized effect of SO4 2− occurred on the structure surface, which further led to the degree of disorder enhanced. Hence, the stripping of amorphous carbon was disadvantageous to the improvement of catalytic performance. Evidently, the higher value ID/IG of cathode material correspond to the higher H2O2 production rate, which confirmed the positive influence of defects. Specifically, defect sites are made for the accumulation of ·HO2, the intermediate of electrosynthesis of H2O2 via 2-eletron ORR Eqs. (6) and (7) (Byers et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2020). (6) Ο 2 + Η + + e − + M → M - O O H (7) M - O O H + H + + e − → M + H 2 O 2"
7,Degradation of RhB utilized different cathodes,"2.2 Degradation of RhB utilized different cathodes RhB as a typical model pollutant were wildly employed for the degradation experiment of organic pollutants (Nidheesh et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Fig. 2 a demonstrated the absorbancy degradation of 60 mg L−1 RhB via different cathodes at −0.60 V (vs. SCE). Modified graphite felts significantly improved the degradation rate of RhB in EF system compared with the raw graphite felt. With the increase of the H2O2 production, the EF chain reactions increases. And thus, GF-C demonstrated the highest degradation rate of RhB, which attributed to the highest H2O2 production rate. Further fitting the curve of degradation of RhB indicated that they followed pseudo first-order kinetics at two stages. The kinetics rate constant using GF, GF-A, GF-B and GF-C was 0.045, 0.098, 0.111, 0.149 min−1 at the first stage, and 0.015, 0.016, 0.035, 0.032 min−1 at the second stage, respectively. In both stages, the kinetics rate constant increased with the increasing H2O2 generation rate of cathodes, and the reaction rate of the first stage was much larger than that in the second stage. Given GF-C cathode demonstrated the optimum performance of the H2O2 generation and the RhB degradation among these cathodes, and thus, utilizing GF-C cathode to study the influence of various conditions for RhB degradation in the following work."
8,Electrolysis parameters,"2.3 Electrolysis parameters 2.3.1 Effect of current density Compared with the potentiostatic method, constant current electrolysis is more suitable for practical application, that's because the constant current method no longer considers the use of reference electrodes. Therefore, we investigated the effect of applied current density on the degradation of RhB. As expected, with the increasing current density from 3 to 6 mA cm−2, the kinetics of RhB degradation enhanced (Fig. 2b). The increased current density not only increased the number of the electrons that participated in the ORR reaction, but also enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction of the system, resulting in a higher dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (Yu et al., 2015, 2020a, 2020a). In addition, exerted current can accelerate the reduction reaction of Fe3+ (eq. (3)). Therefore, more quantities of ·OH generated in cell via EF reaction, caused the higher rate of RhB degradation. Further improved the current density to 7 mA cm−2, the degradation rate has been decreased. This behavior can be explained by the excessive current result in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) intensified (Eq. (8)), thus reduced the H2O2 production. Finally, the optimum current density for RhB degradation using GF-C cathode was determined to be 6 mA cm−2. Fitting the reaction rate constant of pseudo first-order kinetics at two stages. There were 0.042, 0.068, 0.080, 0.155, 0.152 min−1 obtained from 3 to 7 mA cm−2 at the first stage, and 0.019, 0.029, 0.022, 0.009 min−1 obtained from 4 to 7 mA cm−2 at the second stage. (8) 2 Η + + 2 e − → H 2 2.3.2 Effect of Fe2+ concentration The dosage of Fe2+ ions is of vital significance for EF system. At lower Fe2+ ions concentration, the H2O2 generated in system exhibited the lower utilization, furthermore H2O2 can be directly consumed ·OH (Eq. (9)), result in the generation rate of ·OH cannot be maximized (Zhou et al., 2013). On the other hand, excessive Fe2+ ions could scavenge the produced ·OH (Eq. (10)) (Barhoumi et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2020a; Ganiyu et al., 2021). (9) H 2 O 2 + ⋅ O H → H 2 O + ⋅ H O 2 (10) F e 2 + + ⋅ O H → O H − + F e 3 + Hence, the optimization of Fe2+ ions dosage is essential. As shown in Fig. 2c, demonstrated the effect of Fe2+ ions dosage for RhB removal. There significant distinction of the efficiency of RhB removal when no Fe2+ ions and Fe2+ ions existed. when no Fe2+ ions used, even through the electrochemical reaction lasted to 100 min, the removal of RhB was only 87.5%. Nevertheless, this result was achieved in less than 10 min on 0.30 mM Fe2+ ions condition. Li et al. suggested that the H2O2 generated in cell didn't contribute to organic degradation (Li et al., 2020). So, the intermediate of H2O2 generative process played the major contribution for RhB removal in no Fe2+ ions condition (·HO2, Eq. (6)). Obviously, with the increase of Fe2+ ions from 0 to 0.30 mM, faster and higher RhB removal was achieved, however, further increase Fe2+ ions resulted in the reduction of RhB removal. For instance, the removal rate of RhB in 10 min of electrolysis at 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45 and 0.60 mM Fe2+ ions condition were 49.4%, 94.4%, 94.7%, 87.6% and 88.4% respectively. Meanwhile, the kinetics of the reaction rate constant appeared the similar regular also. The kinetics of the degradation process can be divided into two stages besides under the 0 Fe2+ ions condition. At the first stage, the kinetics reaction constant improved from 0.019 to 0.237 min−1 with the concentration of dosage Fe2+ ions increased from 0 to 0.30 mM, but decreased to 0.155 min−1 with the Fe2+ ions concentration further increased to 0.60 mM. 2.3.3 Effect of pH As seen in Fig. 2d, demonstrated the effect of initial pH for RhB removal. The RhB degradation efficiency decreased with the pH increased from 3 to 9, and the kinetics reaction constant were 0.237 (the first stage of pH 3), 0.028, 0.011, 0.011 min−1, respectively. In general, the removal of pollution in EF system due to the quantities of ·OH. In the case of high pH value, ferric species would transform into ferric hydroxides, results in more difficult to establish the cycle system of Fe2+/Fe3+ (Eq. (3)) (Zhou et al., 2013b; Kubo and Kawase, 2018). From Fig. S4, the phenomenon of iron ions precipitation can be seen cleanly. That was the principal reason of the RhB removal decreased. Furthermore, the influence of pH value for H2O2 production rate was investigated also. The experimental conditions adopted section 3.1. Compared with the pH 7 and pH 9, there negligible reduction of H2O2 generation when pH value was 5, but significant decline with further improved pH (Fig. S5a). This can be another cause for the efficiency of RhB removal decreased. Meanwhile, the CE decreased dramatically with the pH value rose (Fig. S5b). Continue 120 min electrolysis reaction, the CE were approximate 65%, 47%, 40% and 22% when pH = 3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. These characteristics are consistent with the literature (Babaei-Sati and Basiri Parsa, 2017; Kubo and Kawase, 2018; He et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019b). The phenomenon that the H2O2 production mentioned above can be attributed to the lack of H+ decelerated the 2-electron ORR kinetics (Zhou et al., 2019b). Furthermore, the decomposition of H2O2 in alkaline is faster than in acid (Eqs. (11)–(13)) (Hsiao and Nobe., 1993; Qiang et al., 2002), which can be a significant reason for the CE and H2O2 yield decreased also. (11) O 2 + e − → O 2 − (12) H 2 O + O 2 − + e − → H O 2 − + O H − (13) H O 2 − + H 2 O 2 → H 2 O + ⋅ O H + O 2"
9,Effect of iron ions species,"2.4 Effect of iron ions species Previously, in Zhou et al. work, adopted Fe3+ as the catalyst instead of Fe2+ in EF system, and they suggested that the source of the catalyst was caused by the stability of Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle (Eq. (3)) (Zhou et al., 2013a b; , 2014). Although the ∙HO2 generated by the catalysis of Fe3+ can lend to the removal of pollution also (Eq. (14)), however the cycle of Fe2+/Fe3+ is more important for contaminant removal (Sirés et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020b; Chu et al., 2021). (14) F e 3 + + H 2 O 2 → F e 2 + + ⋅ H O 2 + H + To investigate the Fe3+ ions catalysis in this reaction system, used 0.3 mM Fe(NO3)3·8H2O as the iron source and compared it with the Fe2+ ions catalyst (Fig. 3 ). As shown in Fig. 3, the degradation rate of RhB adopted Fe3+ ions catalyst lower than Fe2+, but significantly exceed than the system that no Fe ion, which indicated that the favourable reaction of Fe3+ reduction on the cathode surface. The results of the regeneration capacity of Fe2+ ions implied indirectly that the efficient Fe3+ reduction reaction was an important reason of the high efficiency of RhB degradation in Fe2+ ions catalysis system."
10,Reusability of the modified cathode,"2.5 Reusability of the modified cathode The stability of the cathode and its reusability were tested by continuous 5 cycles. It could be seen that after 5 consecutive use, GF-C cathode still maintained good performance for RhB removal (Fig. 4 a). For instance, there 99% removal rate of the absorbancy of RhB when 30 min of reaction. At the first stage, the kinetic rate constant of RhB degradation was 0.237, 0.151, 0.149, 0.119, 0.148 min−1, respectively (Fig. 4b). As depicted in Fig. 4c, the TOC removal achieved over 80% and kept almost stable for the 5 circles of 100 min reuse studied. A reason for the degradation of cathode performance can be attributed to its quality reduction during the process of use, particularly in the wash process after each cycle. It was worth mentioning that the wash of cathode done in ethanol. This is due to the intermediates generated by the degradation process could be covered on the actives site of cathode surface, and thus reduced cathode surface activity, while ethanol treatment could removal these degradation intermediates effectively (Saputra et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018; Jiao et al., 2020). In addition, in this work, the oxide/hydroxide that deposited on cathode surface from the reaction process might be disadvantageous to EF technology (Jiao et al., 2020; Ganiyu et al., 2021). Meanwhile, we investigated that the prepared cathode used for other model pollutant degradation. As shown in Fig. S6a, methylene blue (MB) and orange II can be efficiently removed within 100 min also, and the removal rate of TOC can be achieved 81.5% and 78.6% respectively (Fig. S6b). It was similar to the previous work in this paper, the removal process of absorbancy can be fitted as pseudo first-order kinetic equations under two stages. The degradation kinetic rate constant of MB and orange II were 0.117, 0.097 min−1 in the first stage, and 0.022, 0.044 min−1 in the second stage."
11,Conclusions,"Taken together, we reported that graphite felt modified by anodic oxidation as the EF cathode, used for in-situ H2O2 production and enhanced water treatment. The modification effect of cathode material via anodic oxidation in NaOH, NH4HCO3, H2SO4 electrolyte was studied. It was demonstrated that graphite felt anodized by H2SO4 improved the in-situ production of H2O2 by 15.85 times under the conditions of pH 3, 0.4 L min−1 O2 flux and 0.05 M Na2SO4. It was employed for 60 mg L−1 RhB degradation, significantly improved the degradation rate of RhB. In addition, different conditions of the electrolysis process were studied. The optimal electrolysis conditions were 6 mA cm−2 current density, pH 3 and 0.3 mM Fe2+ ions respectively, and it was shown that exceed 99% absorbancy removal within 30min, and the removal rate of TOC achieved 88.7% within 100 min. The experimental results of the catalyst adopted Fe3+ which instead of Fe2+ indicated that the Fe2+ can be efficiently regenerated on the surface of the prepared cathode via a reduction reaction. Finally, based on the excellent performance of 5-times continuous runs showed that the prepared cathode was suitable for application in dye wastewater treatment based on EF technology."
