0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as an alternative energy carrier to fossil energy and has attracted much attention for application in on-board proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) [1,2]. On-board hydrogen production, instead of hydrogen storage, from liquid alcohols shows potential for hydrogen supply for PEMFC with CO purification unit via processes of water-gas shift reaction and methanation. However, alcohols are commonly produced via fermentation of sugar/starch and energy efficiency for the whole alcohol fermentation and distillation process is still a concern, e.g., net energy balance (NEB) of bioethanol from corn ethanol plant in US and from cassava or molasses ethanol plant in Brazil and Thailand were evaluated and varied within low values of 0.6–1.2 [3–5]. Biomass, as a kind of abundant renewable raw materials, can be facilely converted into bio-oil via integrated fast-pyrolysis process with a high NEB, e.g., 1.67–7.01 for bio-oil from microalgae biomass [6]. Acetic acid (HAc) is a typical component (up to 30 mass %) of bio-oil and can be transformed to hydrogen via the endothermic steam reforming (SR, Eq. (1)); SR is a traditional hydrogen production process, which may produce a high hydrogen yield with theory value up to 4.0 mol-H2/mol-HAc (Eq. (1)) [7], but endothermicity of SR is still a concern for heat transfer of reactor, especially for heat management in dynamic on-board application [8–10]. Auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of HAc (Eq. (2)) is a heat-sustainable process for hydrogen production, which consists of SR and exothermic catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX), and can balance the reaction heat by adjusting the feeding gas ratio of O2/HAc [11,12]. Nevertheless, oxygen in the feedstock can alter the transformation route of HAc and relief carbon deposition by oxidation of coking precursors, e.g., carbonaceous species of CHx from carbon-containing reactants can react with O∗ from O2 and transform into gaseous products of CO/CO2, during the reforming process [12–15]. (1) C H 3 C O O H + 2 H 2 O → 2 C O 2 + 4 H 2 Δ H 0 = + 131.4 kJ ⋅ mol − 1 (2) C H 3 C O O H + 1.4 H 2 O + 0.28 O 2 → 2 C O 2 + 3.44 H 2 In the reforming process, transitional metal of nickel was found active to break of C-C bond and can be a promising candidate for ATR, and alumina supported Ni-based catalysts has long been used in reforming process [16,17]. However, within the ATR atmosphere, the Ni-based catalysts can be easily deactivated because of sintering and oxidation of metallic Ni in the up-stream of the fixed-bed, where oxidative atmosphere and high temperature (up to 1000 °C) can be found [18–20]. On the other hand, carbon formation is still an issue: as reported by Zhang et al., the role of Ni metal with acid sites of alumina in catalyst of Ni/Al2O3 was monitored by in-situ DRIFTS characterization, and dehydrogenation of acetic acid produced species of ketene with C=C functionality, while the -COO and –CHx (x = 1-3, Eq. (3)) functionalities were attributed to the dissociation of the C-C bond in acetic acid; as a result, the formation of the intermediates and coke species were found [21–23]. Therefore, catalysts with resistance to sintering, oxidation and coking are key factors for ATR of HAc [24,25]. (3) C H 3 C O O H ∗ → − H ∗ C H 3 C O O ∗ → − O ∗ C H 3 C O ∗ → − C O ∗ C H 3 ∗ → − H ∗ ∗ C H 2 → − H ∗ ∗ C H → − H ∗ ∗ C The Sm2O3 species, as a basic material with thermal stability, was found active to reduce acidity of supports and to enhance the adsorption/activation of reactants of CO2 and/or O2, and is also helpful to gasify carbon-containing species as oxidative agents during reforming process [26–28]; for example, with Sm in catalysts of Sm2O3-CeO2/Al2O3, Ni/Sm2O3-CaO, Rh-Sm2O3/CeO2-Al2O3, there were more surface oxygen vacancies and a catalytic cycle of Sm2O3-Sm2O2CO3 for gasification of carbon was found (Eqs. (4)-(5)) [29,30]. Meanwhile, within the reforming process, with basic additives of Sm2O3, water molecule in the feed can be activated and thus promotes water-gas shift reaction (WGSR, Eq. (6)) [31]; on the other hand, the basicity of Sm2O3 is found active for dissociation of CHx species in process of CH4 reforming (Eq. (7)), e.g., in a Pt/Sm2O3 catalyst, methane can be adsorbed on the basic Sm2O3 forming methyl radicals of *CHx and transformed into CO/CO2 with active metal of Pt [32]. (4) S m 2 O 3 + C O 2 → S m 2 O 2 C O 3 (5) S m 2 O 2 C O 3 + ∗ C → S m 2 O 3 + 2 C O ∗ (6) H 2 O + C O → H 2 + C O 2 (7) C H 4 + H 2 O s → 3 H 2 + C O Different preparation methods have also been employed to fabricate catalysts with highly dispersed nickel particles. The traditional impregnation route is a facile way to deposit nickel over supports, but Ni particles with weak interaction with supports was found easily sintered overtime [33,34]. Meanwhile, texture is another issue for preparation, e.g., ordered mesoporous structures is always expected in catalysts to tune the reaction route via “confinement effect” [35,36]. Accordingly, synthesis strategy is used to fabricate catalysts with ordered structures. Evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) is a facile way to synthesize ordered materials, e.g., Ni-based catalyst with ceria or magnesium via EISA [37,38] showed higher reactivity and better resistance to coking for dry reforming of methane (DRM). In the current work, to improve the catalytic performance, catalysts with promoter of Sm and mesoporous structures, Ni-xSm-Al-O, were synthesized by evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method, as shown in Scheme 1 , while the ordered mesoprous structure is expected to obtain fine Ni particles and to inhibit carbon deposition and sintering. These catalysts were tested in ATR of HAc for hydrogen production, while the relationship between structure and reactivity was studied via characterizations."
1,Material and methods,
2,Synthesis of Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts Improved evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method was used to synthesize the ordered mesoporous NiO-Sm2O3-Al2O3 catalysts containing 10 wt% of NiO. These catalysts were named as Ni-xSm-Al-O and x represented the weight percentages of Sm2O3/(Sm2O3+Al2O3) with x = 0%, 2% and 4%. Typically, 1.0 g of (EO)20(PO)70(EO)20 triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123, typical MN = 5800, Sigma-Aldrich) and certain amounts of Ni(NO3)3·6H2O (AR, Kelong Chemicals, China) were dissolved in 10.0 mL of anhydrous ethanol (Solution #1); Al(OPri)3 (AR, Kelong Chemicals, China) and/or Sm(NO3)3·6H2O (AR,Aladdin, Shanghai, China) were dissolved in 10.0 mL of anhydrous ethanol, followed by addition of 1.6 mL 67 wt% HNO3 (Solution #2) under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 5 h. Subsequently, the aforementioned Solution #2 was added into Solution #1, and vigorously stirred for another 3 h at room temperature. The mixed solution was then transferred to an oven and remained at 60 °C for 48 h; a gel was obtained and then calcined at 700 °C for 4 h. For comparison, another impregnated nickel-based catalyst was prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation method (IMP). γ-Al2O3 (AR, SinoPharm, China) was added into aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)3·6H2O, remained at room temperature for 24 h and dried at 105 °C, followed by calcination at 700 °C for 4 h. The obtained catalyst was named as Ni-Al-IMP."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations Wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) signals were recorded by DX-2700 X-ray diffractometer (Haoyuan Instrument, China) using Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA from 5° to 80°. The small angle XRD was measured by a Bruker D8 Advance diffractormeter from 0.5° to 6°. Nitrogen physisorption was performed on an automatic adsorption apparatus (JW-BK-112, JWGB, China) at −196 °C. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) methods were applied to analyze the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for pore size distribution, pore volume and specific surface areas (SBET). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded by an Ultra DLD spectrometer (Kratos, UK) using Al Kα radiation (1486.6eV). The binding energies were calibrated relative to the C1s peak from the carbon contamination at 284.6 eV. The reduced catalysts and spents catalysts were cooled down to room temperature in N2, and then collected and stored in vials with N2 before XPS analyses. For CO2 or pyridine temperature-programmed desorption (CO2/pyridine-TPD), the sample (100 mg at 10–20 mesh) was stabilized in a stream of helium at 300 °C, cooled to 50 °C, and then switched into a CO2 flow for CO2-TPD or into a pyridine-saturated helium flow for pyridine-TPD for 30 min; the sample was then purged with helium at 50 °C, and CO2-TPD or pyridine-TPD was performed at a heating rate of 15 °C in a helium flow. The composition of catalysts was measured by elemental analysis with an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (IRIS1000, Thermo Electron). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping were performed using a JEM-2100F microscope at an operating voltage of 200 kV. Thermogravimetry (TG) was conducted on STA409 PC (NETZSCH, Germany) in air from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Raman spectra were carried out using a Renishaw inVia Raman spectrometer equipped with a 532-nm Ar+ laser as an excitation."
4,Catalytic performance test,"2.3 Catalytic performance test The catalytic performance in ATR of HAc was tested in a continuous-flow fixed-bed tubular quartz reactor (inner diameter of 4 mm). Prior to the test, all catalysts (200 mg, grain size of 20–40 mesh) were reduced at 700 °C under a pure H2 (30 ml min−1) for an hour. The water-HAc solution (4:1) was feed by a high pressure liquid pump (P230p, Elite Instrument, China) into a evaporator at 250 °C, and then mixed with oxygen and nitrogen at HAc/H2O/O2/N2 = 1:4:0.28:3.90 (molar), which were controlled by mass flow meters (CS200, Sevenstar Electronics, China). The high ratio of water/HAc at 4/1, instead of stoichiometric 1.4/1, was set for promotion of conversion of HAc (the limiting reactant) and for a higher hydrogen yield via water-gas shift reaction and coking gasification via C + H2O→CO + H2. The catalysts were tested at 1 atm and SV of 30000 ml·gcat −1·h−1. A gas chromatography (SC-200G, Chuanyi, China), which was equipped with columns of Porapak-Q and carbon molecular sieves and with detectors of TCD and FID, was used to analyze permanent and organic gases. HAc conversion (X HAc ), selectivity of carbon-containing products (S i ) and H2-yield (Y H2 ) were calculated by the following equations: S i c a r b o n − c o n t a i n i n g p r o d u c t = F i c a r b o n − c o n t a i n i n g p r o d u c t n i ( F H A c i n − F H A c o u t ) X H A c = F H A c i n − F H A c o u t F H A c i n Y H 2 = F H 2 p r o d u c t F H A c i n In these equations, F i, in or out is the molar flow rate of i species at the inlet or outlet of the reactor, and n i is the carbon ratio between HAc and products. Mass balance on carbon is typically within a margin of error ±5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalytic performance of the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts,"3.1 Catalytic performance of the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts 3.1.1 Apparent activation energy In order to investigate the effect of Sm on ATR of HAc for hydrogen production, the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts with various Sm content were firstly tested at different temperatures, and the results were shown in Fig. 1 . A blank experiment over quartz sands was carried out at different temperature. As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, conversion of HAc was recorded from 0.1% to 13.9% at temperatures from 400 °C to 500 °C, respectively, and reached 74.6% at 800 °C. For the gas compositions, as shown in Fig. S1, the main gases at 400–550 °C were CO2 and CH4, the two products from decomposition of HAc. With increasing temperatures, acetone emerged and increased rapidly to about 62.8% at 650 °C, and then dropped at 700 °C or higher temperatures. The hydrogen yield remained at low values below 0.1 mol-H2/mol-HAc. For comparison, the conversion of HAc over the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts increased with increasing temperature and reached 100% near 700 °C. On the basis of conversion of HAc, Arrhenius plots were analyzed in Fig. S2. The apparent activation energy (Ea) for the blank test was found at Ea = 133.7 kJ mol−1 [39], while much lower Ea was obtained over catalysts in a sequence as follows: Ni-Al-IMP (42.2 kJ mol−1) > Ni-Al-O (39.8 kJ mol−1) > Ni-4Sm-Al-O (36.1 kJ mol−1) > Ni-2Sm-Al-O (18.3 kJ mol−1), suggesting that the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst with ordered mesoporous structure and Sm doping was more active to convert HAc in ATR. 3.1.2 Catalytic performance test for ATR of HAc The catalytic stability of the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts was examined for 30 h at GHSV of 30000 ml·gcat −1·h−1, 700 °C and 1 atm, as depicted in Fig. 2 . The Ni-Al-O catalyst presented a HAc conversion near 100% and a hydrogen yield near 2.7 mol-H2/mol-HAc (or 270% (mol-H2/mol-HAc) on imput acetic acid) in the beginning; however, both the HAc conversion and the hydrogen yield dropped overtime, indicating that there could be variation within the Ni-Al-O catalyst during the ATR of HAc. For the carbon-containing products, the main products were CO2 and CO with selectivity near 68.9% and 31.0%, respectively, while the selectivity to CH4 was recorded near 0.2%. By-product of acetone was not found, suggesting that the ketoniztion reaction route of CH3COCH3* via combination of CH3CO* and CH3* was inhibited [40]. For the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst, there was a stable catalytic activity: the H2 yield and conversion of HAc were stable near 2.6 mol-H2/mol-HAc (or 260% on imput acetic acid) and 100%, respectively, during the 30-hr test. With more Sm in Ni-4Sm-Al-O, the decline in reactivity was observed. For comparison, over the impregnated Ni-Al-IMP catalyst without mesoporous framework, a relatively low H2 yield and HAc conversion were also observed and decreased gradually during the ATR test. 3.1.3 Different O2/HAc in ATR of HAc The Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst showed a better reactivity in ATR, and thus the effect of O2/HAc in feed was further tested. As shown in Fig. 3 , with different ratio of O2/HAc up to 1.0, the HAc conversion remained stable near 100%, while the hydrogen yield was recorded near 2.74 mol-H2/mol-HAc at O2/HAc = 0; with higher O2/HAc, the hydrogen yield dropped slightly to 2.63 mol-H2/mol-HAc at O2/HAc = 0.28 and further to 2.14 mol-H2/mol-HAc when O2/HAc reached 1.0. Meanwhile, the selectivity of CO2 increased with higher ratio of O2/HAc. Considering the heat balance and hydrogen yield in ATR, the ratio of O2/HAc near 0.28 can be suitable for hydrogen production."
7,Characterizations,"3.2 Characterizations 3.2.1 Oxides of Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts were prepared by EISA and impregnation, and in order to explore structures of these Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts, wide-angle XRD patterns were firstly recorded, as displayed in Fig. 4 (A). Over the Ni-Al-IMP catalyst prepared by impregnation (Fig. 4(A4)), weak and broad diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 (PDF#: 10-0425) and spinel NiAl2O4 (PDF#: 10-0339) were found, while the peaks of NiAl2O4 emerged at slightly lower angles than those of γ-Al2O3 [41,42]. For the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts prepared by EISA, there were no apparent peaks of NiO or Sm2O3, and only very weak and broad peaks of NiAl2O4/γ-Al2O3 can be detected, suggesting that nickel species mainly existed in the NiAl2O4 structure and samarium species with low loading may exist in amorphous state and may have been incorporated into the skeleton of γ-Al2O3/NiAl2O4 and highly dispersed in these catalysts [43]. To find possible mesoporous structure, small-angle XRD patterns were recorded and depicted in Fig. 4(B). The Ni-Al-O catalyst prepared by EISA demonstrated a strong peak near 1.0° and a weak peak around 1.5°, which can be attributed to the (100) and (110) planes of the hexagonal crystals with unit-cell parameters of a0 near 13.1 nm [44], suggesting that the ordered hexagonally mesoporous structures (p6mm symmetry) had been successfully synthesized in Ni-Al-O. For the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst with doping of samarium, there is a strong peak of (100) plane, indicating that the introduction of Sm did not destroy the ordered structure. However, with more Sm in the Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalyst, the (100) diffraction peak becomes weaker, suggesting that the ordered structure had partially collapsed. As comparison, over the Ni-Al-IMP catalyst, no obvious diffraction peak was found, indicating that there could be no ordered structure. The mesoporous structure of Ni-xSm-Al-O oxides was further checked by the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions (PSD), as exhibited in Fig. 4(C). All the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts present type-IV isotherms with H1 hysteresis loop within relative pressure (P/P0) at 0.7–0.98, suggesting there were mesoporous structures with uniform channels. As shown in Fig. 4(D), the PSD curve of the Ni-Al-O catalyst centered near 6.6 nm, while the curve of Ni-2Sm-Al-O narrowed near 8.8 nm, confirming that there were more uniform pores in Ni-2Sm-Al-O. With more Sm species in Ni-4Sm-Al-O, the PSD curve became broaden and shifted to higher pore size around 12.6 nm, indicating that excess Sm species led to disorder of mesoporous structure and higher average pores size. Over the impregnated Ni-Al-IMP catalyst, there was weak type IV isotherm without obvious hysteresis loop. The SBET, pore volume and average pore size were analyzed and listed in Table 1 . Within these Sm-promoted catalysts, high SBET (243.2 m2/g) and pore volume (0.87 cm3/g) were obtained over the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst, while low SBET (164.9 m2/g) and pore volume (0.72 cm3/g) were observed over the Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalyst. The increase in pore size and surface area can be attributed to the incorporation of Sm into the skeleton of γ-Al2O3(NiAl2O4) of catalysts prepared by EISA with P123 termplae: the ionic radium of Sm3+ is 109.8 pm, which is much higher than either Ni2+ (83.0 pm) or Al3+ (67.5 pm). However, with more Sm in Ni-4Sm-Al-O, the (100) diffraction peak became weaker, suggesting that the ordered structure had partially collapsed, while the PSD curve became broaden and shifted to a even higher pore size around 12.6 nm with a lower surface area at 164.2 m2/g, suggesting that excess Sm species within the γ-Al2O3(NiAl2O4) resulted in disorder of mesoporous structure and higher average pore size. Similar results were found by Kim et al. [45]. For the composition of these catalysts, the ICP-AES results are listed in Table S1, and the data indicate that the actual compositions are close to the nominal ones. 3.2.2 Reduced Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts To find the crystal structure after reduction for ATR of HAc, the wide-angle XRD patterns were recorded over the catalysts reduced by H2 at 700 °C for 1 h, as shown in Fig. 5 (A). As compared to those of oxides, the peaks of spinel type of NiAl2O4 and/or γ-Al2O3 become weaker, but no obvious Ni0 diffraction peaks were found over the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts, which can be attributed to high dispersion of metal species and would be checked later by TEM and XPS. Meanwhile, for the Ni-Al-IMP catalyst, there were peaks of metallic Ni phase (PDF#: 04-0850) near 44.5°, 51.7° and 76.3° for crystal planes of (111), (200), and (220), respectively. To gain more insight on the morphological features, the reduced Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts were further screened by TEM. As shown in Fig. 6 (A) and (B), the Ni0 particles with an average particle size of ca. 10 nm were found embedded in these Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts. Meanwhile, there was typical p6mm hexagonal symmetry with ordered cylindrical pores along the (100) direction, and more ordered mesoporous structure was found in Ni-2Sm-Al-O. The results suggested that during the EISA process, the incorporation of Sm into the Al2O3 skeleton improved the uniform of mesopores, which is consistent with the SA-XRD and nitrogen physisorption results. However, with more Sm added in the Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalyst, the mesoporous structure became partly disordered, as shown in Fig. 6(C), suggesting that excess Sm species may have partly destroyed the mesoporous structure; meanwhile, the average Ni0 particle size increased slightly to 10.7 nm. For the Ni-Al-IMP catalyst (Fig. 6 (D)), bulk aggregated Ni0 particles over alumina skeleton were found and the average Ni0 particle size was ca. 18.8 nm. These results on porous structures in the Ni-based catalysts were consistent with the results of N2 physisorption and SA-XRD. In order to thoroughly check the state of the mesoporus Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst, HRTEM and STEM-EDX were further conducted. As shown in Fig. 7 (A) of Ni-2Sm-Al-O, the cylindrical pores were regularly aligned and the Ni0 particles were homogeneously embedded in the ordered mesoporous framework. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 7 (B)), the d-spacing of (100) plane of Sm2O3-Al2O3 was measured near 11.35 nm. A lattice spacing of 0.203 nm for the Ni (111) plane was also obtained. In the meantime, no lattice spacing corresponding to Sm2O3 was found, suggesting that Sm2O3 could be inserted into the mesoporous framework and cannot be detected because of high dispersion. To further confirm the channel structures, elements line-scanning of Al, Ni, Sm and O was carried out (Fig. 7 (C)). The results illustrated that the intensities of the Sm, Ni, O and Al signals were in agreement with their respective content and location, and the reduced Ni particles were mainly located in the mesoporous channels. The corresponding elemental mapping images of Ni, Sm, Al and O were also shown in Fig. 7(D)–(H), and the mapping results confirmed that the mesoporous structure was mainly consisted of Al2O3, while Sm species were homogeneously incorporated in the skeleton of Al2O3. XPS was used to evaluate the electronic state of the Ni species over the reduced catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5(B). For the reduced samples, the peaks in the Ni 2p3/2 spectra near 852.6 eV, 856.2 eV and 862.2 eV can be assigned to Ni0, Ni2+ and the shakeup peak, respectively [7], suggesting that these catalysts were partly reduced via reduction at 700 °C for 1 h. Meanwhile, the quantitative analysis on the ratio of Ni0/(Ni0+Ni2+) was shown in Table S2. For the reduced Ni-2Sm-Al-O and Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalysts, the Ni0 peak was intensified with Ni0/(Ni0+Ni2+) near 10.9% and 29.1%, respectively, suggesting that EISA process and Sm can promote the reduction of Ni species via electron-donating effect of Sm; similar phenomena were found in catalysts of Cu-K-Sm/γ-Al2O3, SmNbO4 and SmTaO4, as reported by Sun et al. [46], and Brunckova et al. [47]. 3.2.3 Characterization of the spent Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts During the 30-hr test for ATR of HAc, the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst produced a stable catalytic performance, while the activities of Ni-Al-O, Ni-4Sm-Al-O and Ni-Al-IMP dropped. To find the possible variation over these spent Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts, wide-angle XRD was employed. As shown in Fig. 5(C), the γ-Al2O3 and NiAl2O4 peaks remained stable, indicating the skeleton in these catalysts could be thermally stable during the ATR process. Meanwhile, the Ni0 diffraction peak became slightly stronger in spent Ni-Al-O and Ni-Al-IMP catalysts, indicating that the sintering may have happened overtime. To screen the Ni state, the Ni 2P3/2 spectra of spent catalysts were also recorded by XPS, as shown in Fig. 5(D) and Table S2. Over the spent Ni-Al-O catalyst, a weak peak of Ni0 species with an 8.6% of Ni0/(Ni0+Ni2+) was recorded, indicating that slight oxidation of Ni0 occurred in Ni-Al-O. With introduction of Sm in Ni-2Sm-Al-O, the Ni metal remained stable near 10.7%, and may explain the stable catalytic performance in ATR. Meanwhile, over the Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalyst, the percentage of Ni metal reached 13.6%. For the spent Ni-Al-IMP catalyst, the Ni0/(Ni0+Ni2+) ratio increased from 6.5% to 11.2%, suggesting that Ni in Ni-Al-IMP can be further reduced during the ATR process, and this increase of Ni0 in XPS is consistent with the increase of the Ni0 peak in XRD. Coking was usually found during reforming process, and to estimate carbon deposition by coking during ATR, TG/DTG was conducted over the spent catalysts, as shown in Fig. 8 . In the TG/DTG profiles, the weight loss below 200 °C can be attributed to the evaporation of water, while the weight loss at higher temperatures can be attributed to the gradually combustion of carbonous species. The weight loss at high temperatures varied in the following sequence: Ni-2Sm-Al-O (2.20%) < Ni-Al-O (2.62%) < Ni-4Sm-Al-O (4.64%) < Ni-Al-IMP (7.45%), suggesting that there were more carbon deposited over the Ni-4Sm-Al-O and Ni-Al-IMP with less ordered structure. Meanwhile, the weight gains by oxidation of Ni0 species during TG were estimated and varied within 0.23%–0.35%, which is much smaller than the weight loss of either water evaporation or coking combustion. Coke deposited on the catalyst surface is crucial for deactivation of reforming process, and the Raman spectra is more sensitive to analyze carbonous species over these catalysts. From the Raman spectra of the spent Ni-Al-IMP (Fig. 9 ), it can be observed that there were two strong peaks centered near 1337.2 cm−1 and 1592.4 cm−1, which were characteristic graphite peaks of deformation of D-band and G-band, respectively. D-band is associated to the disordered sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, while G-band is related to Eg vibration mode of graphite and sp2-bonded carbon material [48,49]. Meanwhile, two other weak peaks (D′-band and D″-band near 2653.1 cm−1 and 2911.3 cm−1, respectively) [50,51] were also observed, confirming the carbon species mainly existed as graphite carbon. For the Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalyst, similar peaks were found, suggesting that there was also graphite carbon deposited. Over the spent Ni-Al-O and Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalysts with ordered mesoporuous structures, no obvious peaks can be found, indicating there were less carbonous species formed during the ATR process. The spent catalysts were then further screened by TEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 10 . The mesoporous structures remained stable in Ni-Al-O and Ni-2Sm-Al-O, and the particle size of Ni metal in Ni-Al-O slightly increased to 13.3 nm, while Ni particle in Ni-2Sm-Al-O remained stable near 11.2 nm and the d-spacing of (100) plane was also remained near 11.8 nm, indicating that these catalysts were relatively stable in structure and are consistent with the XRD results, in which no obvious change was found in crystal phase and particle size. Similar results were observed over the Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalyst, but the Ni particle in Ni-Al-IMP increased to 21.8 nm. No obvious carbon species were found in Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst, while filament carbon species were observed over Ni-Al-IMP, which was consistent with the weight loss in TG and strong peaks in Raman. 3.2.4 Acidity and basicity of Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts Basicity is an important factor for coking in reforming process; CO2-TPD was then performed to analyze the basicity of these Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts. As shown in Fig. 11 (A), there is one main CO2 desorption peak at 124 °C with another weak peak near 410 °C over the Ni-Al-IMP. Similar CO2 desorption peaks were found in the Ni-Al-O catalyst, suggesting that there were two types of basic sites within these Ni/Al2O3 catalysts [52]. With Sm incorporation in Ni-2Sm-Al-O, the high-temperature CO2 desorption peak became stronger and one weak peak emerged near 612 °C; It was reported that the high-temperature peaks of CO2 desorption can be also helpful to adsorb and dissociate CO2 to oxidize intermediate carbons within the ordered structure in reforming process (Eq. (11)), thus to constrain coking [53]. According to quantitative analysis, there were about 0.92 mmol-CO2/g-catalyst desorbed over Ni-2Sm-Al-O, as compared with 0.52–0.68 mmol-CO2/g-catalyst over the Ni-Al-O catalyst without Sm (data are shown in Table S3), suggesting that within the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst, there were more strong basic sites formed with Sm incorporation and the overall basicity was improved within the mesoporous framework [54]. This high-temperature peak can be attributed to Sm2O3 adsorbed CO2 and formed into species of Sm2O2CO3 (Eq. (4)). For the Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalyst with more Sm, there are still strong desorption peaks near 124 °C and 412 °C. The acidity is also important for activation of HAc, especially for the HAc dehydrogenation reaction with derivatives of intermediate carbonous (CHx, x = 1–3) and *C, which always results in coke deposition [55]. The TPD of pyridine experiments were then conducted to investigate the acid sites of the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts, as shown in Fig. 11(B) and Table S4. The strong peak in Ni-Al-IMP suggests that there were more acid sites with about 0.098 mmol/g of pyridine desorbed. For the Ni-Al-O catalyst prepared by EISA, acid sites increased to about 0.126 mmol/g, which can be attributed to higher surface area with more acid sites. With addition of Sm in the Ni-2Sm-Al-O/Ni-4Sm-Al-O catalysts, the peak became weaker and dropped to 0.087 and 0.082 mmol/g, suggesting that the acidity decreased gradually with basic Sm oxides."
8,Discussion,"3.3 Discussion The characterization results indicate that the ordered mesoporous structure can be formed within the Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts via EISA. It was reported that there was “confinement effect” within ordered mesoporous structure during reforming process [56], and this effect can restrain formation of coking from intermediate carbons and aggregation of Ni0 nanoparticles. For the Ni-Al-IMP prepared by impregnation, the SBET was 135.8 m2/g with no obvious ordered structure, as indicated by nitrogen physisorption (Fig. 4(C)). After reduction, there was lower reducibility of Ni species (6.5%) from the spinel NiAl2O4 precursors, and a large Ni0 average particle size was measured at 18.2 nm. Therefore, an initial reactivity with low H2 yield near 2.4 mol-H2/mol-HAc was recorded. During the ATR process, because of its relatively high acidity and low basicity, as suggested by pyridine/CO2-TPD, the carbon species formed via polymerization of carbonous species, e.g., CHx, CH2CO, etc., and obvious filament carbon species were observed, as suggested by HRTEM, TG and Raman. Meanwhile, sintering was also found as the average Ni0 particle size increased to 21.8 nm. As a result, the reactivity dropped overtime. For the Ni-Al-O prepared by the EISA method, the ordered structure formed with a high SBET at 193.3 m2/g and an average pore size at 9.3 nm. Meanwhile, after reduction, there was about 10.1% of nickel species reduced into Ni0 with an average particle size of 10.1 nm, which resulted in a high initial activity in the ATR. During reforming process, the ordered structures in Ni-Al-O were stable, as suggested by HRTEM and SA-XRD, and because of the “confinement effect” by the mesoporous structure, the coking via polymerization of carbonous species was significantly inhibited (Fig. 8(A)). However, partly oxidation of Ni metal, as suggested by XPS (Fig. 5(D) and Table S2), was found over the spent Ni-Al-O, and the hydrogen yield then dropped slightly to 2.3 mol-H2/mol-HAc during ATR of HAc (Fig. 2). For the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst, a more ordered mesoporous structure was formed with high SBET (Table 1), strong basicity and weak acidity (Fig. 11). After reduction, a higher dispersion with an average Ni0 particle size at 9.9 nm was obtained. In addition, these Ni0 species remains relatively stable both in particle size and in valence, which was attributed to the “confinement effect” of stable ordered mesoporous framework and Sm promotion. Thus, the Ni-2Sm-Al-O presented relatively low reaction barrier (18.3 kJ mol−1) and the H2-yield was stable at 2.6 mol-H2/mol-HAc during the 30-hr ATR test, which shows application potential for hydrogen production via ATR of HAc. The transformation route of HAc over the Ni-2Sm-Al-O was proposed and shown in Scheme 2 . Over the Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst, HAc was absorbed and activated on surface of the catalyst, and further transformed into CH3COO* via dehydrogenation. Then, it transformed into carbonous species (*CHx, x = 0–3) via successive decomposition (Eq. (3)). Meanwhile, Sm2O3 species in Ni-2Sm-Al-O facilitated to oxidize/dissociate intermediate carbon species and transform them to CO and/or CO2 via a Sm2O3-Sm2O2CO3 cycle (Eqs. (4)-5)), and Sm2O3 can also promote WGSR (Eq. (6)) and CH4 reforming (Eq. (7)). As a result, the *CHx spices were transformed into CO/CO2 with H2O and O2 in feed (Eq. 8-13) by species of Ni/Sm2O2CO3/Al2O3 via catalytic cycle. Therefore, coking resistance was improved with both mesoporous structures and Sm promoters, and a stable reactivity for ATR of HAc was obtained in Ni-2Sm-Al-O. Meanwhile, thermal decomposition of HAc at the input section of catalyst bed cannot be ignored, and the thermal decomposition products of CH4, acetone, etc. can be converted when passing through the catalyst bed and transformed into CO/CO2, as shown in Scheme 2.

Meanwhile, with more Sm, relatively low acidity and more Ni0 species (29.1%) were also observed, and a high initial H2 yield near 2.6 mol-H2/mol-HAc was then obtained. However, because of the collapsed mesoporous structure and without confinement effect, graphite carbon species was formed, as suggested by HR-TEM, Raman and TG; slight sintering of Ni metal (Fig. 10(C)) also occurred during the ATR test, as indicated by XPS and TEM, resulting in decrease of hydrogen yield over time (Fig. 2(C))."
9,Conclusions,"The ordered mesoporous Ni-xSm-Al-O catalysts with various Sm contents were synthesized via EISA method and tested in ATR of HAc at 30000 ml·gcat −1·h−1, 700 °C and 1 atm. The Ni-2Sm-Al-O catalyst with ordered mesoporous structure exhibited a better performance: the conversions of HAc reached 100.0% and the hydrogen yield remained stable at 2.6 mol-H2/mol-HAc in a 30-h test. The improved reactivity can be attributed to synergic effect of the basic Sm oxides and ordered mesoporous framework with confinement effect: the basic sites were beneficial to adsorption and activation of HAc, and the ordered mesoporous framework constrained the thermal agglutination of Ni metal and formation of coking, while intermediate carbonous species of *CHx (x = 0–3) can be gasified to CO via a Sm2O3-Sm2O2CO3 cycle. These Sm-promoted Ni-based catalysts were also tested with different temperatures and O/C, and show potentials in ATR of HAc for hydrogen production."
