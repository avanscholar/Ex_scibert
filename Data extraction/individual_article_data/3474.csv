0,Introduction,"Biomass is an abundant and carbon-neutral renewable energy resource for the production of alternative liquid fuels and a variety of chemicals. By fast pyrolysis, biomass can easily be converted to liquid to give yields as high as 70–80 wt% [1,2]. The pyrolysis oil, also called as bio-oil, is considered to be a promising source for second-generation energy carriers and chemical raw materials [3]. It consists of more than 100 oxygenated compounds, including acids, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, phenolic derivatives, and sugars. Bio-oil typically has low pH (2–3), high viscosity, high oxygen content (up to 60 wt%), and high water content. The water in bio-oil varies from 15 to 50 wt%, depending on the type of pyrolyzed biomass [4,5]. Because of these characteristics, the direct utilization of bio-oil as transportation fuel is limited; as a result, its indirect utilization via upgraded catalytic technologies is widely studied. These upgraded techniques are focused on catalytic hydrogenation for deoxygenation, catalytic cracking for production of fuels with high calorific value, catalytic esterification for reducing the acidity, catalytic steam reforming for hydrogen production, or a combination of these technologies. Zeolite-based catalysts are widely used in hydrodeoxygenation, cracking, esterification, and a combination of these reactions. Their widespread use is due to their well-ordered porous structure and high activity per acid/active site of the catalysts. Wang et al. reported that catalysts with a strong acidity (e.g. ZSM-5) had a high activity in bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation reaction, and the mesoporous structure of the support can further improve the catalytic performance of ZSM-5 [6]. Yuan et al. found that the oxygenated compounds went through deoxygenation, cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions and formed light olefins over the zeolite acid sites during the catalytic conversion of bio-oil [7]. Zhao et al. carried out the hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil over 20 wt% Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst by cascade reactions at 523 K and 5 MPa [4]. Zheng et al. carried out a series of studies on the one-step hydrogenation–esterification of bio-oil on Pd-, Pt-, and Pd/Pt-based bifunctional catalysts. They selected zeolite-based mesoporous materials, as well as Al/SBA-15 and SBA15-PrSO3H for use as supports [8–10]. Huber et al. developed a two-step procedure for bio-oil upgrading: hydroprocessing of bio-oil over noble-based catalysts, followed by cracking conversion over ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts [5]. Qu et al. carried out two-stage hydrotreating/cracking experiments to improve heavy bio-oil’s properties in an autoclave reactor with a combination of Ru-based catalyst with zeolite (ZSM-5) [11]. Bi et al. proposed an efficient route of current-enhanced catalytic conversion for converting bio-oil tar to xylenes over the zeolite catalysts [12]. Wang et al. selected some ketones and acids as bio-oil model compounds to carry out the catalytic cracking studies over the HZSM-5 catalyst [13–15]. However, mesoporous materials typically become unstable after long periods of exposure to hot water or steam environments. This phenomenon is due to the hydrolysis of the Si–O–Si bond or the Si–O–Al bond in the skeleton of the mesoporous structure; this reaction leads to decreased order within the material and thereby induces further collapse of the skeleton [16]. As a result, the activity and stability of the catalyst decreases sharply. On the other hand, catalytic steam reforming reactions have been proposed for use in reforming the oxygenated, thermally unstable bio-oil. The crude bio-oil, aqueous fraction of bio-oil, and the bio-oil model compounds were widely used as the feedstocks for the screening of high performance catalysts, such as Ni-based catalysts and noble-based catalysts [17]. These reforming reactions involve conditions that resemble high-moisture environments. Published reports, however, indicate that rapid and serious coking is the key challenge in bio-oil catalytic steam reforming [18–21]. High partial pressure of steam is required for the reaction to enhance rapid conversion of the coke to CO and induce the reaction to follow the water–gas shift reactions, which reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. Therefore, if we can divide the bio-oil into two fractions, namely, a water-rich fraction suited for the reforming for hydrogen production; and a waterless fraction suited for hydro-treatment on the zeolite-based catalysts, then we can have a combined process wherein reforming and hydro-treatment complement each other. This will make the high quality utilization of bio-oil possible. The water-rich fraction contains low-molecular-weight organics (e.g., acids, ketones, and aldehydes) which are suited for reforming, as all the water required may be derived from the crude bio-oil. The waterless fraction, on the other hand, contains high-molecular-weight organics (e.g., phenolic derivatives and sugars), which are suited for hydro-treatment. Previously, we reported an efficient separation technology, molecular distillation, for the separation of the thermally sensitive bio-oil [22]. The separation is determined by the molecular mean free path rather than the boiling point of the constituents of the bio-oil. We found that water and low-molecular-weight organics such as acids, aldehydes and ketones, are more easily distilled than heavy organics such as phenolic derivatives and sugars [23,24]. After the separation, the water and low-molecular-weight organics were enriched in the cold trap to form the molecular distillation fraction (MDF), and the heavy organics were enriched in the high-temperature condenser trap to form the residue fraction (MRF). In our previous studies, almost all of the water and major light organics (acids, aldehydes, and ketones) were collected in the MDF, and almost all of the heavy organics were collected in the MRF. As reported, acids are preferred for steam reforming for hydrogen production, whereas phenolic derivatives are typically hydrodeoxygenated for alkane fuel production [3,4,25]. Therefore, the water-rich MDF is suited for catalytic steam reforming and the MRF, which is rich in phenolics, is suited for hydro-treatment. The hydrogen produced can be widely used as clean resource in fuel cells and internal combustion engines. Combined with the ease of transporting bio-oil, the use of power sources based on hydrogen fuel is very amenable to mobile applications [26]. Therefore, we focused on catalytic steam reforming of the MDF in the present work. We examined not only its hydrogen yield but also the detailed catalytic reaction mechanisms on the Ni(111) surface. First, we analyzed the composition of the MDF obtained from the bio-oil from rice husk pyrolysis. Catalytic steam reforming of the MDF without steam addition was done for hydrogen production on a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is a high-activity catalyst that is widely used in the reforming of a variety oxygenated organics [27–29]. Afterward, we performed detailed calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We examined four typical organic compounds in MDF (acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, furfural, and phenol) as regards their adsorption, decomposition pathway, and mechanism of steam reforming on the Ni(111) surface. The four model compounds are typically used not only in bio-oil catalytic steam reforming, but also in hydrogenation and other catalytic treatments [30,31]."
1,Experimental and computational methods,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with 30 wt% nickel loading was prepared by wetness impregnation. 10 g Al2O3 was added to 100 ml aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 with the concentration of 0.5 M. The suspension was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, followed by evaporation at 80 °C with vigorous stirring. After evaporation, the sample was dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined for 4 h at 700 °C. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas, pore volumes, and pore size distributions of the prepared catalysts were determined by examining the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The isotherms were obtained using a Quadrasorb SI apparatus. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a Philips Tecnai G2F30 transmission electron microscope. The carbon deposition on the catalyst after the stability test was determined by thermogravimetry (TG) in air using a temperature ramp of 30 °C min−1. The TG measurements were performed on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/SDTA851e apparatus. The composition of crude bio-oil and fresh MDF were analyzed in a Trace DSQ-II GC/MS apparatus."
3,Feedstock,"2.2 Feedstock The crude bio-oil (CBO) used for this work is a black liquid derived from pyrolysis of rice husk. The separation of its fractions was conducted on a molecular distillation apparatus (UIC Corporation, Germany) at 90 °C and 1600 Pa. The CBO was separated into two fractions: distillate fraction (MDF) and residue fraction (MRF). The distillation yield for MDF and MRF was 41.7% and 58.3%, respectively. The water content in MDF and MRF was 72.2% and 6.4%, respectively. MDF was used for the follow-up catalytic reforming study. The main organic composition of CBO and MDF are listed in Table 1 . It is shown that the content of ketones, acids and aldehydes increased significantly after distillation, while the content of phenols decreased largely. Besides that, no sugars were detected in the MDF. Four major types of molecules comprised the MDF: ketones, acids, aldehydes, and phenols, which were present at proportions of 42.78%, 30.03%, 14.76%, and 10.36%, respectively. The most abundant compounds in each type were hydroxyacetone (22.92%), acetic acid (HOAc, 26.48%), furfural (12.17%), and methoxyphenol (4.79%)."
4,Catalytic activity test,"2.3 Catalytic activity test The reactions were carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. In each experiment, 0.3 g of catalyst was sandwiched between layers of quartz sand and then packed in a quartz tube reactor. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was activated for 3 h by exposure to hydrogen at 700 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Afterward, it was cooled to the reaction temperature. The liquid MDF was directly fed into the reactor and no additional water was fed. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was set to 4 h−1, the corresponding methane-equivalent gas hourly space velocity (GC1HSV) was 1020 h−1, the steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C) was 3.2, and the reaction pressure was kept at 1 atm."
5,Computational methods,"2.4 Computational methods In the present work, total energy calculations using the spin-polarized periodic DFT-slab approach with the GGA-PBE functional were performed by the use of the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [32–34]. Ionic cores were described by the PAW pseudopotential, and the cutoff energy was set at 400 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh. A Fermi smearing of 0.1 eV was used. The electronic self-consistent field was converged to 1 × 10−4 eV and the force on all atoms were converged to less than 0.05 eV/Å. Ni(111) slab models, which consisted of three metal layers, were constructed based on a 3 × 3 unit. The atoms of the top layer of the slab were allowed to relax to their lowest-energy configurations, while those at the second and bottom layers were fixed in the bulk positions. The bulk lattice constant was initially calculated to test the method employed. The lattice constants for Ni derived from our bulk calculations (3.517 Å) were in good agreement with the experimental values (3.524 Å), thereby validating the employed methods and models for the Ni system. The adsorption energy E ads is defined as E ads = E slab/ads – E slab – E gas, where E slab/ads is the total energy of the slab with adsorbates, E slab is the energy of the slab, and E gas is the energy of the adsorbates in the gas phase. The transition state and the energy barrier were determined by means of the nudged elastic-band (NEB) method."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Activity and stability test,"3.1 Activity and stability test The catalytic reforming reactions were performed on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 500 °C–700 °C. The overall results (Table 2 ) indicate that the conversion of MDF increased from 52.5% to 95% when the reaction temperature was increased from 500 °C to 700 °C. The total yields of H2 and carbon-containing gases also increased with increasing temperature. The highest H2 yield reached 135 mg g−1 organics at 700 °C. After reforming at 700 °C, almost all of the organics in the MDF were converted, with small amounts of HOAc and phenol remaining in the fraction. The MDF turned into a clear, colorless liquid as its water content increased to 97.5%. Table 3 shows the comparison of our present work with some well-reported works on the bio-oil aqueous fraction reforming. Although the S/C in the MDF was lower than that in other bio-oil aqueous fractions, the H2 yield was comparable with that obtained from the aqueous fraction reforming over the Ni-based catalysts. The superior performance may be ascribed to the fact that most organics in the MDF had high reactivity in catalytic reforming. The resistance of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst to deactivation was examined by subjecting it to a stability test at 700 °C for 13 h. The variation in the composition of outlet gas products with time on stream is shown in Fig. 1 . The trend shows that the catalyst remained stable during the 11 h test. A slow decrease in H2 content and an increase in CO and CH4 contents in the outlet gas were observed after 11 h on stream, indicating a gradual loss of catalytic activity. This loss is probably caused by coke deposits on the catalyst surface. Despite the decline, the catalyst is more stable than the catalysts used in bio-oil aqueous fraction reforming in fixed-bed reactors (Table 3)."
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.2 Catalyst characterization A typical TEM image of the fresh Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is presented in Fig. 2 . The nickel oxide particles are well dispersed, and have an average size of 20 nm. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the fresh and spent Ni/Al2O3 catalysts and their pore size distribution are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The BET surface area decreased from 140.3 to 59.6 m2 g−1 after 13 h on stream. The pore volume decreased from 0.334 to 0.242 cm3 g−1, indicating slight pore blockage caused by coke deposition. The pore size distribution of the fresh catalyst in Fig. 3B reveals a bimodal pore structure with pore sizes centered at 3.5 and 6 nm. In contrast, the larger pores disappeared in the spent catalyst, confirming the blockage by coke deposition. The TG measurement also indicate that the deposited coke reached 14 wt%."
9,DFT calculation,
10,Adsorptions of reactants,"4.1 Adsorptions of reactants By gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we found four classes of abundant organic compounds in the MDF, namely, hydroxyacetone, acetic acid, furfural, and phenol. These compounds were selected to represent ketones, acids, aldehydes, and phenols, respectively. They were used as models in the DFT calculations performed in studying the reaction mechanism. Adsorption of the reactants on the Ni(111) surface was first considered. The corresponding adsorption energies are listed in Table 4 , and the plausible adsorption geometries are depicted in Fig. 4 . Two possible points for adsorption in HOAc and hydroxyacetone molecules are the carbonyl oxygen atom and the hydroxyl oxygen atom. The optimized geometries show that the carbonyl O is closer to the Ni(111) surface compared with the hydroxyl O, indicating that the interaction between the carbonyl O and the Ni(111) surface is the main contributor to the adsorption. Thus, adsorption through the carbonyl O atom is preferred to through the hydroxyl O atom. The bond length between carbonyl O and Ni is about 2.0 Å. As a result of the d–π interactions, the ring compounds phenol and furfural preferentially form planar configurations on the Ni(111) surface; these changes have strongly negative binding energies (−0.64 and −0.70 eV, respectively). The planar configurations also have the highest binding energies in our studies, indicating that ring compounds such as phenol and furfural, which are in competition with non-ring compounds during the initial adsorption of reactants, preferentially adsorb on the Ni(111) surface. The ring compounds are also more stable upon binding to the surface."
11,Reaction mechanisms,"4.2 Reaction mechanisms The route of catalytic steam reforming mainly involves the decomposition of the reactant and the subsequent steam reforming of the carbon precursor by its interaction with OH∗ or O∗ intermediates that formed from H2O decomposition [39,40]. 4.2.1 HOAc decomposition According to our previous DFT calculation of HOAc decomposition on the Co(111) surface [41], as well as reports in the literature [42,43], two crucial elementary reaction steps for HOAc decomposition on the transition-metal surface are the formation of acetate and acyl species: CH3COOH∗ → CH3COO∗ + H∗ CH3COOH∗ → CH3CO∗ + OH∗ The decomposition pathway is shown in Fig. 5 . We found that the barrier for acetate formation (0.47 eV) is much lower than that for acyl formation (1.06 eV). That is, HOAc dehydrogenation, which forms CH3COO∗, probably starts on the Ni(111) surface. The acetate species CH3COO∗ adsorbs on the surface to form a bridge configuration via two O atoms, which link to the catalyst surface on the top site. The CH3COO∗ undergoes deoxidation to form CH3CO∗ and O∗ or decarboxylation to form CH3∗ and CO2∗. The energy barriers for these steps are 1.15 and 1.96 eV, respectively. With its lower reaction barrier, the deoxidation is preferred to the decarboxylation. As a result, CH3CO∗ is enriched on the surface, forming a bridge geometry through C and O atoms in the CO group. There are two possibilities for the further decomposition of the CH3CO∗ intermediate: one is C–C bond cleavage to form CH3∗ and CO∗; the other is C–O bond dissociation into CH3C∗ and O∗. As shown in Fig. 5A, the barriers for C–C bond cleavage and C–O bond cleavage are similar, differing only by 0.12 eV. This similarity suggests the coexistence of CH3∗ and CH3C∗ intermediates from CH3CO∗ decomposition. Decomposition of both CH3∗ and CH3C∗ was further represented in Fig. 5B. As shown, the energy barrier of CH3∗ dehydrogenation to CH2∗ and the energy barrier of CH2∗ dehydrogenation to CH∗ are 0.70 and 0.30 eV, respectively, which are much lower than the barrier of CH∗ dehydrogenation to C∗ (1.34 eV). This large difference suggests that CH∗ is easily produced from CH3∗, while is hard to dissociate, and it becomes a crucial intermediate for carbon deposition. Green et al. also concluded that CH∗ is the most abundant decomposition product of methane on the Ni(111) surface [44]. They also found that CH∗ is more stable than C∗, and it could therefore be a key species in carbon formation mechanisms on the surface. Furthermore, C–C and C–H bond cleavages in CH3C∗ decomposition has high energy barriers (2.06 and 2.05 eV, respectively). These high barriers indicate stability of CH3C∗ on the surface. Therefore, CH∗ and CH3C∗ are two key precursors of carbon species in HOAc decomposition. Based on the reaction barriers, the most plausible reaction pathway for HOAc decomposition on the Ni(111) surface is CH3COOH∗ → CH3COO∗ → CH3CO∗ → CH3C∗ + CH3∗ → CH2∗ → CH∗. It should be noted that the oxygen atoms formed in the decomposition reactions would partially oxidize the surface Ni to NiO. The phenomenon of partially oxidation has been found in HOAc decomposition on the Co(111) surface [41]. 4.2.2 Hydroxyacetone decomposition The decomposition network of hydroxyacetone is shown in Fig. 6 . Similar to HOAc, hydroxyacetone (CH3COCH2OH) has two possibilities for the first step decomposition: the first is dehydrogenation of hydroxyl group to form the bridge adsorption of CH3COCH2O∗ on the surface; the other is dehydroxylation to form the vertical adsorption of CH3COCH2∗. The corresponding energy barriers for the dehydrogenation and the dehydroxylation are 0.50 and 0.86 eV, respectively, suggesting that the dehydrogenation is preferred in the first step. The CH3COCH2O∗ undergoes two successive dehydrogenation steps involving the CH2 group to form CH3COCO∗, the latter step of which has a higher energy barrier (1.08 eV, first-step barrier is 0.50 eV). The terminal acyl CO bonds of CH3COCO∗ form a bridge geometry on the surface through η 2(C)–η 1(O) during adsorption. Further decomposition of CH3COCO∗ also proceeds through two possible reactions: one is the formation of co-adsorbed CH3CO∗ and CO∗ via C–C bond cleavage in the two acyl groups; the other is the formation of co-adsorbed CH3COC∗ and O∗ via terminal acyl C–O bond cleavage. The corresponding barriers are 0.48 and 1.52 eV, respectively. The lower barrier of the former reaction implies that C–C bond cleavage between two acyl groups is more likely than C–O bond cleavage in the terminal acyl group. Furthermore, CH3COCH2∗ also forms because of the low energy barrier of CH3COCH2OH∗ dehydroxylation (0.86 eV, which is only 0.36 eV higher than the barrier for dehydrogenation). CH3COCH2∗ may undergo two compatible reactions: the first is dehydrogenation to form CH3COCH∗, and the other is demethylenation to form CH3CO∗. Their energy barriers are 0.51 and 0.86 eV, respectively. Therefore, dehydrogenation is preferred to demethylenation. CH3COCH∗ further decomposes to CH3COC∗ via dehydrogenation (0.72 eV barrier) and to co-adsorbed CH3CO∗ and CH∗ via loss of methine (0.78 eV barrier). The next dissociation, CH3COC∗ to CH3CO∗, has an energy barrier of 1.07 eV. Interestingly, CH3CO∗ always forms in hydroxyacetone decomposition regardless of the initial step. The dissociation of CH3CO∗ has been discussed in detail in the case of HOAc decomposition (Section 4.2.1). Taking together the plausible steps and the corresponding reaction barriers, the most likely reaction pathway for hydroxyacetone decomposition is CH3COCH2OH∗ → CH3COCH2O∗ → CH3COCHO∗ → CH3COCO∗ → CH3CO∗ → CH3C∗ + CH3∗ → CH2∗ → CH∗. Considering the low reaction energy barriers for hydroxyacetone decomposition on the Ni(111) surface (generally lower than 1 eV), the Ni-based catalyst is considered a high-performance catalyst for hydroxyacetone decomposition. 4.2.3 Furfural decomposition The possible decomposition reactions of furfural (C4H3OCHO) on the Ni(111) surface are depicted in Fig. 7 . According to reports [45], the aldehyde group in furfural is very active on the surface. The furfural easily undergoes dehydrogenation to form an η 3-(C,O) configuration of C4H3OCO∗ wherein both C and O atoms link to the metal surface. The dehydrogenation barrier is low (0.59 eV). The path taken by C4H3OCO∗ dissociation prefers decarbonylation (0.51 eV) rather than dehydrogenation on the methine groups (1.77 eV). After the decarbonylation, the furan C4H3O∗ intermediate forms. Subsequently, dehydrogenation in C4H3O∗ occurs to form C4H2O∗ (0.58 eV energy barrier). C4H2O∗ adsorbs vertically on the surface through the two C atoms. Ring opening of the adsorbed C4H2O∗ induced by C–C bond cleavage (0.68 eV) is more likely to occur than further dehydrogenation (2.98 eV). Given the plausible steps, we conclude that the ring-opening route C4H3OCHO∗ → C4H3OCO∗ → C4H3O∗ → C4H2O∗ → open-ring C4H2O∗ is the most likely reaction pathway for furfural decomposition on the Ni(111) surface. All reaction energy barriers in the optimal pathway are lower than 0.7 eV, indicating that furfural can decompose easily on the surface. The proposed pathway concurs with the results of our experiment, which show that all aldehydes were converted completely. 4.2.4 Phenol decomposition As depicted in Fig. 8 , the initial step for phenol (C6H5OH) decomposition is more likely to occur via O–H bond cleavage rather than via C–O bond cleavage. The corresponding reaction barriers are 0.49 and 1.62 eV, respectively; the corresponding products are C6H5O∗ and C6H5∗, respectively. The energy barrier of C6H5O∗ deoxylation to C6H5∗ is quite high (1.82 eV). Energy barriers for the succeeding steps of C6H5∗ dehydrogenation to form the final product of C6∗ are all higher than 1 eV. In addition, these steps are all endothermic reactions, which lead to increased energies of dehydrogenation of the intermediates and reduced stability of intermediates on the surface. As a result, phenol is more difficult to decompose than the other three compounds discussed previously; traces of phenol remained in the reformed MDF even at high reaction temperature (700 °C). Therefore, the most likely reaction pathway for phenol decomposition is C6H5OH∗ → C6H5O∗ → C6H5∗ → C6H4∗ → C6H3∗ → C6H2∗ → C6H∗ → C6∗. 4.2.5 Decomposition potential energy surface According to the above analysis of the most probable decomposition pathways of the four organics, the potential energy surface (PES) for the decomposition reactions were constructed (Fig. 9 ). Comparison of the PES shows that phenol decomposition is a continuous endothermic process with products of higher energies and reduced stabilities on the catalyst surface. Alternatively, the decompositions of HOAc, hydroxyacetone, and furfural are continuous exothermic processes that increase the stability of the products on the Ni(111) surface. On the basis of this comparison, the reactivity of decomposition on the Ni(111) surface may be deduced: furfural > hydroxyacetone > HOAc > phenol. HOAc and hydroxyacetone decompositions have the same rate-determining step: CH3CO∗ → CH3∗ + CO∗ (1.21 eV energy barrier). The rate-determining steps for furfural and phenol decomposition are C4H2O∗ → open-ring C4H2O∗ (0.68 eV) and C6H5O∗ → C6H5∗ + O∗ (1.82 eV), respectively. 4.2.6 Steam reforming reactions The steam reforming reactions consist of two parts: initial water decomposition to OH∗ and further O∗ on the Ni(111) surface; and subsequent reaction of OH∗ and O∗ with carbon precursor species from organics decomposition (CH∗ and CH3C∗) to form CO∗. The energy barriers for H2O∗ dehydrogenation to OH∗ and for OH∗ dissociation to O∗ are 0.91 and 1.11 eV, respectively. Due to its abundance and key role on the surface, we first carried out studies on the CH∗ reforming reactions with OH∗ and O∗. As shown in Fig. 10 , the energy barriers for CHOH∗ formation (CH∗ + OH∗ → CHOH∗) and for CHO∗ formation (CH∗ + O∗ → CHO∗) are 1.05 and 1.12 eV, respectively. The barriers for these two reactions differ by 0.07 eV only, suggesting a similar likelihood of formation for CHOH∗ and CHO∗. Afterward, CHOH∗ and CHO∗ decompose completely to CO∗. CHO∗ dissociates easily to CO∗ because of its low dehydrogenation energy barrier (0.26 eV). This step is exothermic, and is accompanied by a release heat of 1.39 eV. On the other hand, CHOH∗ is also very likely to decompose to CO∗ via two successive dehydrogenation steps with low energy barriers: CHOH∗ → COH∗ + H∗ (0.07 eV) and COH∗ → CO∗ + H∗ (0.99 eV). These two steps are also strongly exothermic, with amounts of heat released equivalent to 1.86 and 0.93 eV, respectively. Therefore, the carbon precursor CH∗ can be easily steam-reformed to CO∗ on the Ni(111) surface. The reforming of CH3C∗ is also depicted in Fig. 10. It consists of two steps: initial addition of the OH group to carbine carbon atom to form CH3COH∗; and subsequent dehydrogenation to form CH3CO∗. The corresponding reaction barriers are 1.29 and 0.76 eV, respectively. As discussed in Section 4.2.1, CH3CO∗ decomposes via two compatible reactions: one is decarbonylation to form CH3∗ (1.21 eV energy barrier), and the other is deoxylation to form CH3C∗ again (1.09 eV energy barrier). CH3∗ can easily be reformed completely to CO∗ through CH∗, whereas CH3C∗ is stable and can be regenerated by the route CH3C∗ → CH3COH∗ → CH3CO∗ → CH3C∗."
12,Conclusions,"The water-rich distillation fraction, which was separated out efficiently from bio-oil by molecular distillation, was catalytic reformed for H2 production over the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst without steam addition. A carbon conversion of 95% and H2 yield of 135 mg g−1 organics were obtained under optimized conditions. The catalyst maintained its high activity during 11-h test. In addition, the reaction mechanisms over the Ni(111) surface of the four typical compounds, acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, furfural, and phenol, were calculated by density functional theory. The most stable adsorption geometries of these four compounds were identified. The activation energy and reaction enthalpy for various elementary reactions of the corresponding decomposition and reforming pathways were obtained. Furthermore, CH∗ and CH3C∗ were the two key carbon precursors in the catalytic reforming reaction."
