0,Introduction,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as an environmentally friendly high-efficiency oxidant, is widely used in various areas of industry, such as chemical, environmental protection, paper, medical, etc (Jia et al., 2018; Wu and Qian, 2018). In the above chemical processes, mixtures of H2O2 and organic compounds are commonly presented, e.g. for the H2O2 production, for the oxidation and bleaching processes or for the synthesis of organic peroxides (Chen, 2008; Schreck et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2010). However, H2O2 and organic mixtures are also well known for their hazard potential (Jia et al., 2018; Papadaki et al., 2005; Schreck et al., 2004). In particular, in the process of H2O2 production, high concentration H2O2 and working solution (WS) (organic compounds mainly including 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB), trioctylphosphate (TOP) and 2-Ethylanthraquinone (EAQ)) would form explosive mixtures (Jia et al., 2018), fire and explosion accidents have been frequently occurred, causing considerable damage to life and property (Othmer, 2018; Wu and Qian, 2018). Therefore, it is of great significance to study the explosion hazard and understand the thermal runaway mechanisms of H2O2-organics mixtures, in order to explore the efficient technical means to reduce the risk of mixture explosion. Significant research works have been experimentally conducted to investigate the explosive hazard properties of H2O2-organic mixtures (Chi et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2018; Schreck et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2019; Wu and Qian, 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Chi et al. (2012) investigated the thermal hazard of H2O2 mixing with propanone by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and vent size package 2 (VSP2), the thermal analysis and adiabatic kinetic results indicated that H2O2 was highly hazardous when mixed with propanone. Zhang et al. (2019) investigated the effect of resin on decomposition characteristics of H2O2 by DSC and VSP2 calorimeters, the results illustrated that the stability of H2O2 decreases obviously with the addition of resin. Wu and Qian (2018) studied the thermal runaway behavior of hydrogen peroxide with both inorganic and organic impurities by an agitated batch reactor, and found the potential risk of organic impurities on the thermal stability of hydrogen peroxide was much larger. Schreck et al. (2004) experimentally investigated the explosive properties of mixtures of containing hydrogen peroxide and different alcohols (R−OH) by heating them under confinement, they indicated that there was a strong dependence of the explosive properties on the chemical structure. Jia et al. (2018) determined the explosive properties of the WS/H2O2, TMB/H2O2 and TOP/H2O2 mixtures by the drop weight test, and proposed explosion initiation mechanism based on the gaseous and liquid products, however, the thermal hazard mechanism is not comprehensive yet. H2O2-organics explosion is a complex process including a series of complicated chemical reactions, free radicals and intermediates. Process thermal hazards were generally analyzed and evaluated using calorimetry techniques (Fujita et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Laiwang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a, 2019b; Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). And the characterization of explosion products and intermediates has been analyzed using GC/MS, and FTIR (Liu et al., 2018; Shie and Chan, 2013; Smitha et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Electron spin resonance (ESR) also provides access to the information of free radical (Xu et al., 2018). On the basis of the experimental observations and measurements, some mechanisms and kinetics of explosion were proposed (Liu et al., 2018; Smitha et al., 2018). In fact, the detailed reaction mechanisms are still difficult to be understood by experimental methods due to the lack of effective detection tool for drastically changing free radicals, intermediates and myriad micro-reactions in explosion condition. Computational methods would be extremely useful to explore the mechanisms and model the chemical reactions. Quantum Mechanical (QM) based calculation like density functional theory (DFT) is a widely used method for microscopic reaction mechanisms research, with calculation of transition states (TS), activation energies and thermodynamic parameters (Curran, 2019). However, QM-based methods are computationally expensive and are mostly limited to small molecules and short time scales (Wang et al., 2014). Besides, the reaction pathways need to be known or pre-predicted in advance of QM exploration of reaction mechanism, which is not applicable to the complex system such as the H2O2-organics mixture, the detailed reaction pathway of which is unclear in general. As a promising reactive force field developed by van Duin et al. (2001), Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) is a general bond-order dependent potential method that can smoothly describe the bond breakage and bond formation among molecules in a system (Fantauzzi et al., 2014), which allows to explore reactions without any pre-defining of reaction pathways or reactive sites with the accuracy close to DFT but with largely reduced computational costs (Liu et al., 2019a, 2019b) that demonstrates its potential in simulating very complex systems. ReaxFF molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) has growing applications in a wide variety of systems and materials (Sun et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2016), showing its advantages in modeling reactive systems with complex chemical reactions, such as pyrolysis and combustion of hydrocarbons, coal, kerogen, polymers, etc. (Castro-Marcano et al., 2014; Qian et al., 2016; Saha et al., 2018; Xin et al., 2020). And ReaxFF MD has been recently adopted to explore the reaction routes of the thermal decomposition of energetic materials (Yang et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020) and methane oxidation under explosion condition (He et al., 2014; Hong and Guo, 2017). The ReaxFF MD simulation analysis results have been verified through the agreement of main products and reaction pathways with that of experimental results (Castro-Marcano et al., 2014; Qian et al., 2016; Hong and Guo, 2017; Saha et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2020). Those works show the feasibility and advantages of ReaxFF MD for reaction investigation of complex explosion process. This study attempts a new approach to reveal the intrinsic reaction mechanisms of thermal runaway process of H2O2-organics mixture by ReaxFF MD simulations and in combination of DFT calculations. The major component in working solution for H2O2 production, that is TMB, was selected as the target organic compound. ReaxFF MD simulations of the TMB/H2O2 mixture thermal runaway process were performed to investigate the dynamic migrating trends of reactants, intermediates or radicals, and reveal the detailed reaction pathways. Then the free energy barrier and enthalpies of the main reaction steps were calculated by DFT to further understand the reaction mechanisms at the atomic level. This study provided a novel atomic insight into the thermal runaway hazard of H2O2-organics mixture."
1,Computational methods and modeling,ReaxFF MD was adopted to examine the whole thermal runaway process and main reaction routes. And the DFT calculations were conducted to determine the intrinsic kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of key reaction steps.
2,Reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD),"2.1 Reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) Traditional molecular dynamics (MD), also known as classical MD based on classical mechanics of the Newton’s equation of motion, employs classical force field methods only to describe physical elastic collision among atoms with static bonds and fixed partial charge, which is widely used in physical properties of large biomolecules or materials (Klein and Shinoda, 2008; Doshi and Hamelberg, 2015) but is incapable of describing chemical reactions (Zheng et al., 2013; Kylasa et al., 2014). Quantum mechanical (QM) methods such as DFT could explore chemical reactions with high accuracy (Parr, 1990). However, DFT is extremely computationally intensive and not feasible for large complex systems (Agrawalla and van Duin, 2011). Motivated by restrictions of the two approaches, ReaxFF, a promising reactive force field, was developed by van Duin et al. (2001) in an effort to bridge the gap between QM and classical MD. The parameters of ReaxFF are derived solely from a large database of QM calculations on a large number of organic reactions, including both ground states and transition states (Salmon et al., 2009). The combination of MD and ReaxFF, that is ReaxFF MD, is many orders of magnitude cheaper than QM and allows MD simulate on the decomposition, reactions, and oxidations of large-scale atomic systems with accuracy close to that of DFT (Chenoweth et al., 2008). During ReaxFF MD simulations, chemical bonds among atoms can be freely broken and generated, and the connectivity among atoms is constantly updated. It can accurately describe reactivity and identify reaction pathways of complex chemical systems (e.g. Salmon et al., 2009; Castro-Marcano et al., 2014; Saha et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2021). ReaxFF MD employs a bond-order formalism, which accommodates long distance covalent interactions characteristic. The energy function of the system takes the following form: (1) E s y s t e m = E b o n d + E l p + E o v e r + E u n d e r + E v a l + E p e n + E t o r s + E c o n j + E H b o n d + E v d W a a l s + E C o u l o m b Where E s y s t e m is the total energy of the system, which is composed of covalent interactions and non-bonding interactions between atoms. E b o n d is the bond energy, E l p is the energy of long pair electrons. E o v e r and E u n d e r are the correction terms for coordination energy. E v a l , E p e n , E t o r s and E c o n j represent the valence angle term, penalty energy, torsion energy and conjugation energy term. E H b o n d is the weak hydrogen bond energy. E v d W a a l s and E C o u l o m b are non-bonded interactions, represent the van der Waals interaction energy and Coulomb interaction energy."
3,ReaxFF MD simulation,"2.2 ReaxFF MD simulation A 3D periodic closed system, containing 10 TMB, 159 H2O2 and 300 H2O molecules, was used in the calculations, with the density of 0.22 kg/dm3. To obtain the final equilibrium system, firstly, initial constructed system was energy minimized using a low temperature (10 K) molecular dynamics for 10 ps. Then, the system was kept in a Berendsen thermostat at 300 K for 25 ps with a damping constant of 100 fs to perform a NVT (constant number, volume and temperature) MD simulation. Thereafter, this system was compressed to a density of 0.22 kg/dm3 at 300 K using NPT (constant number, pressure and temperature) ensemble at a pressure of 0.2 GPa. Then, the system was relaxed by 50 ps no-reaction NVT-MD simulation at 300 K, the configuration of the equilibrated system is shown in Fig. 1 (a). After the equilibrium, the system temperature was raised to an initiation temperature, and then NVE ensemble (constant number, volume and total energy) (that is, a closed system with no heat exchange with the outside) was used to explore the detailed reaction process of thermal runaway. In order to determine the initiation temperature, preliminary reactive heating up simulation and different initiation temperature tests were conducted (see Fig. S1(a)(b) in Supplementary material), The reactive heating up simulation indicated that the runaway reactions marked by the reaction of TMB began at the temperature around 2500 K after a stage of evolution of H2O2 decomposition. And the initiation temperature was defined to be 2500 K through further different initiation temperature tests. During ReaxFF MD simulation, the system temperature was raised to 2500 K from 300 K at a rate of 200 K/ps with no-reaction NVT ensemble to simulate rapid initiation energy. At the initiation temperature of 2500 K, NVE thermal runaway simulation was conducted for the equilibrated TMB/H2O2 system, the final configuration from the simulations is shown in Fig. 1(b). All ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations were implemented in ADF software (Baerends et al., 2013). The time step of 0.25 fs and C/H/O force field parameters (Chenoweth et al., 2008) were used in the present study. It should be noted that the time scale for the simulations (∼ps) is many magnitudes lower than that in experiments (∼s). Nevertheless, according to Arrhenius equation, the reaction rate significantly increases as the temperature rises. Therefore, in MD simulations, the strategy of increasing the simulation temperature is general adopted to allow the chemical reactions to occur in the time scale of picoseconds, and hopefully acquire the similar mechanism with that of experimental conditions. Although the ReaxFF MD simulation temperatures are different from those of experiments, numerous works (Cheng et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2016; Saha et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2021) have already demonstrated that the elevated temperature strategy in ReaxFF MD can well reproduce the reaction mechanism at experimental temperatures. So the elevated temperature strategy was also adopted in this study. In order to check the reliability of our model, another two ReaxFF MD simulations with different configurations of equilibrated system (see Fig. S2 in Supplementary material) were also carried out. And the simulation results of the repeated cases were quite close to each other (see Fig. S3 in Supplementary material)."
4,Density functional theory (DFT) calculations,"2.3 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The geometrical structure optimization of the reactants, products, intermediates and transition states (TS) were performed using B3LYP functional (Becke, 1993) along with the 6−31 G(d) basis sets for all atoms. And spin-unrestricted set was employed for open-shell species. Reaction potential energy surface (PES) scans and transition state search (opt = TS) were performed for reaction steps to help for searching transition state. And intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) (Gonzalez and Schlegel, 1990) calculations were carried out to make sure that each TS connected its reactions and products. Harmonic vibrational frequency calculations were performed at the same level for reactants, products, TS to obtain the zero-point correction, thermal correction to energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy. And single point energy was calculated at the B2PLYPD3 (Grimme et al., 2011) level with basis sets of def2TZVP. Then the thermal energy, enthalpies and Gibbs free energies were obtained through adding the corrections with scaling factor to the single point of energy."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Thermal runaway process of TMB/H2O2 mixture,"3.1 Thermal runaway process of TMB/H2O2 mixture Fig. 2 shows the variation of temperature, number of reactants (TMB and H2O2) and total number of molecules during thermal runaway process of TMB/H2O2 mixture via ReaxFF MD simulations. It can be seen that the temperature of TMB/H2O2 system increased slowly form 2500 K to 3000 K at the first 150 ps with an average rate of 3.33 K/ps, then increased rapidly from 3000 K (150 ps) to 5000 K (350 ps) with the rate of 10 K/ps. According to the change regularity of temperature, the thermal runaway process was divided into two stages. The first 150 ps was stage I, and the interval from 150 ps to 350 ps was stage II. The number of H2O2 decreased sharply at the first 50 ps and then gradually approaching zero at stage I, but the decrease of TMB shifted to later, and also dropped to zero at late of stage I. However, The total number of molecules in the system increased rapidly at the first 50 ps from the initial 469 to above 530 due to the decomposition of H2O2, and then increased slowly to about 560 at the late of stage I as the initial oxidation of TMB molecules. After all the reactants were consumed, the total number of molecules increased quickly at stage II, reflecting the rapid thermal runaway process. Fig. 3 displays the change curves of the main products O2, H2O, CO, CO2 and free radicals (·OH and ·OOH) during thermal runaway process. It can be seen that in stage I, O2 and H2O rapidly increased to a high level, corresponding to the rapid decomposition of H2O2, with the overall reaction of 2H2O2=O2+2H2O. Along with the quick increase of O2, the free radical of ·OOH played a governing role, and the number of ·OOH corresponded to the increase rate of O2, and tended to zero after O2 reached its maximum. However, the number of ·OH free radical had a significant increase at stage II, which showed as the key active species during the thermal runaway process. The CO and CO2 products were initially produced at about 110 ps, and CO began to increase significantly after 200 ps, which reflected the intensive oxidation reaction. Further statistical analyzing the number of molecules with different carbon atoms, as shown in Fig. 4 , The C9 molecules (same carbon atoms with TMB) were consumed slowly at the early 100 ps, and fast decreased at around 150 ps, the C8-C6 molecules increased first and then decreased during 100−150 ps, indicating the initial cracking of C9 molecules in stage I. Then the C5-C3 molecules were generated and consumed in the early of stage II, subsequently the C2 molecules reached a maximum at around 200 ps, afterwards, after which the C1 molecules increased sharply until they became the dominating species. Fig. 4 reveals that in the process of thermal runaway, TMB undergoes cracking and opening of the benzene ring to small molecules. Summarizing the formula of molecules in the tested system at different moments, as displayed in Table 1 , it can be found that TMB (C9H12) was first converted to C9H11 free radical, and oxidized to C9H12O (3,5-dimethylbenzyl alcohol), then it was further oxidized to C9H10O (3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde) (see 150 ps in Table 1), and the bond between benzene ring and the methyl side chain was broken to generate benzaldehyde. Or a few methyl groups were substituted by hydroxyl to form (C8H10O) 3,5-dimethylphenol or phenol. Then the benzene ring was opened and cleaved into C3-C1 molecules (see 200 ps in Table 1). The typical products obtained via ReaxFF MD simulations were consistent with the main liquid products experimentally analyzed by GC–MS in the work of Jia et al. (2018), verified the reliability of the simulation results. The detailed reaction pathways obtained by tracing the TMB molecules (see Fig. S4 in Supplementary material) can further clarify the main reaction mechanisms of products evolution: TMB was initially initiated by ·OH free radical and came into being benzyl radical, and the benzyl radical was gradually oxidized to benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde. In addition, the CC bond between benzene ring and methyl or aldehyde broke, and the benzene radicals combined with ·OH to generate phenol, or structural rearrangement. The initiation mechanisms agree well with that proposed by Jia et al. (2018) via experimental measurement. After the reaction was initiated by partial oxidation of the methyl side chain, the benzene ring opened in the late of stage I. There also some TMB radicals presented direct benzene ring-opening in the early of stage II at higher temperatures. Then the hydrocarbon chain was further cracked into small C3-C1 molecules, and the C3-C1 molecules were deeply oxidized to CO and CO2 in stage II (see 300 ps in Table 1)."
7,DFT calculations of the reaction mechanisms,"3.2 DFT calculations of the reaction mechanisms The detailed reaction steps in the thermal runaway process of TMB//H2O2 mixture were obtained via ReaxFF MD simulations. In this section, the kinetic and thermal properties of main reactions process were analyzed by DFT calculations to understand the reaction mechanisms at the atomic level. H2O2 molecules were decomposed first under the initiation temperature, the elementary reaction steps of H2O2 decomposition were acquired through ReaxFF MD simulation, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). Two H2O2 molecules were first observed to react with each other, as illustrsted in step 1, when the O atom of one H2O2 molecule was close to the H atom of another H2O2 molecule, the new OH bond was formed, and the OO bond in the former H2O2 was broken to generate ·OH free radical. Then the OH bond of the latter cracked to form ·OOH free radical and H2O. The generated ·OH free radical grabbed the H atom of one other H2O2 molecule, resulting one more ·OOH free radical and H2O, as shown in Step 2. The redundant ·OOH free radicals tended to react through the O atom of one ·OOH capturing the H of another ·OOH to produce O2 and H2O2, as displayed in Step 3. This reveals why ·OOH is the dominant free radical during H2O2 decomposition and its number corresponds to the increase rate of O2 as presented in Fig. 3. The H2O2 molecule was also observed to be directly s into two ·OH radicals as presented in Step 4. In the later stage of H2O2 decomposition, the ·OH and ·OOH radicals combined to produce O2 and H2O, and ended the radical transfer reaction (Step 5). The H2O2 decomposition steps obtained by MD simulation are basically in accordance with those in the literature (Garcfa Einschlag et al., 1997; Romero et al., 2009), the special difference is that the initial step H2O2 = 2·OH was proposed in the literature, however, 2H2O2=·OH +·OOH +H2O was observed in this study through ReaxFF MD. Analyzing the reaction mechanism by DFT calculations shown in Fig. 5(b), it evidences that the H2O2 needs to overcome a free energy barrier of 80.34 kJ/mol through the transition state (TS1) reacting with another H2O2, nevertheless, the direct cracking of H2O2 requires an activation free energy of 127.32 kJ/mol. Thus the step of 2H2O2=·OH +·OOH +H2O is the kinetic favorite route. Note that the H2O2 = 2·OH step could also be prominent under some energy and environmental conditions. The chain reaction process of H2O2 decomposition (2H2O2=O2+2H2O) has two ways, one is step1→step2→step3, another is step4→step2→step5. For the first way, the step2 with a free energy barrier of 116.50 kJ/mol is the rate-limiting step. And the step4 with the activation free energy of 127.32 kJ/mol is rate-limiting step of the second way. As a result, the decomposition of H2O2 tends to go through step1→step2→step3 initially, and can go through step4→step2→step5 in the later stage. Further analyze the thermal properties of those reaction steps, the step1 and step2 are exothermic, with thermal energy of 2.82 kJ/mol and 168.24 kJ/mol released respectively. And the step3 is endothermic reaction which requires absorbing the energy of 26.46 kJ/mol. The overall reaction heat of H2O2 decomposition is -144.60 kJ/mol, the result via DFT calculations is basically consistent with the experimental data of -196.8 kJ/mol (Shanley and Perrin, 1958), although there is a deviation of less than 30 % due to the idealized treatment of quantum chemistry. As the exothermic property of H2O2 decomposition, the temperature of the simulated system showed a rapid rise during the first 50 ps as displayed in Fig. 2. The ·OH free radical generated during the process of H2O2 decomposition induced the TMB molecule reaction, as illustrated in Fig. 6 (a). ·OH free radical attacked the H atom of methyl in the TMB molecule to form the transition states (TS1). The H in methyl was captured by ·OH, resulting in a 3,5-dimethylbenzyl radical ((CH3)2-Ph−CH2·) and H2O molecule early at 3.9 ps. Combined with DFT calculations shown in Fig. 6(b), it reveals that this step needs to overcome a free energy barrier of 13.51 kJ/mol and 100.37 kJ/mol thermal energy is released. This energy barrier is significantly lower than that required for the direct cleavage of H atom (271.54 kJ/mol, shown in Fig. S5(a) in Supplementary material). Then the 3,5-dimethylbenzyl radical combined with ·OH to form 3,5-dimethylbenzyl alcohol ((CH3)2-Ph−CH2OH) at 45.5 ps, and this step is exothermic, with high thermal energy of 336.86 kJ/mol released. The other methyl could also be initiated by interaction with ·OH radicals in accordance with the above steps. Thereafter, the H atom of hydroxyl (−OH) in 3,5-dimethylbenzyl alcohol was further captured by ·OH radical to generate (CH3)2-Ph−CH2O· radical (see 79.2 ps in Fig. 6(a)) through TS2 (shown in Fig. 6(b)) with an energy barrier of 28.89 kJ/mol. Afterwards, the (CH3)2-Ph−CH2O· went through hydrogen transfer to form (CH3)2-Ph-·CHOH (see 82.2 ps). In some case, the (CH3)2-Ph−CH2OH would convert to (CH3)2-Ph-·CHOH directly through the transition state of TS3 with a lower energy barrier of 23.34 kJ/mol and releases 132.04 kJ/mol thermal energy. And then the H atom of hydroxyl (−OH) was captured by ·OH producing a 3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde ((CH3)2-Ph−CHO) through TS4 with an energy barrier of 50.99 kJ/mol and thermal energy release of 352.50 kJ/mol. According to the DFT results, it can be found that the H-abstraction and ·OH-combine reactions induced by ·OH are the key steps for the thermal initiation. The reaction heat released of the overall initiation process from TMB to 3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde was 921.76 kJ/mol shown in Fig. 6(b). When the initiation reactions take place in serial, the thermal energy released of the initiation reactions is so high that it evokes the subsequent runaway reactions. After the initiation reactions, the benzene ring was opened, and the hydrocarbon chain was further cracked into small molecules. The typical pictures of benzene ring cracking during ReaxFF MD simulation are presented in Fig. 7 (a). The structure of benzenedimethyl radical (CH3-Ph-(CH2·)2) was rearranged and the bond between C(1)-C(3) formed (see 121.4 ps in Fig. 7(a)) with the bond energy of C(1)-C(2) decreasing from 367.51 kJ/mol to 169.98 kJ/mol, this step required to overcome a free energy of 52.02 kJ/mol and needed a thermal energy of 52.73 kJ/mol (see Fig. 7(b)). Then the C(1)-C(2) bond cracked, requiring the free energy of 160.43 kJ/mol and thermal energy of 169.98 kJ/mol. The bond of C(3)-C(4) tended to break afterwards with a thermal energy of 73.11 kJ/mol released. The free energy required of the above benzene ring opening process is 212.45 kJ/mol, which is lower than the free energy to break C(1)-C(2) and C(2)-C(3) bonds directly, that are 352.45 kJ/mol and 355.29 kJ/mol. After the ring was opened, the hydrocarbon chain was cracked into small molecules at the end of stage I (see 144.0 ps and 159.2 ps). The total free energy needed to overcome from benzenedimethyl radical to C3 small molecules was 507.05 kJ/mol, and the thermal energy absorbed was 579.03 kJ/mol. Due to the thermal energy absorbed during benzene ring-opening and cracking, the temperature increase during stage I is slow. The results suggest that the ring-opening and cracking process of benzene is the critical stage for the inhibition of explosion. The number of ·OH free radical increased significant with the consumption of oxygen in stage II, as presented in Fig. 3. The vast majority of hydrogen peroxide was decomposed into oxygen early in stage I, then the generated oxygen molecules further reacted with the hydrocarbon fragments derived from TMB to produce ·OH, as schematized in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that oxygen molecule combines with hydrocarbon fragments to form peroxide or peroxide radical. And the peroxide decomposes to generate one ·OH radical. Or the peroxide radical decomposes to generate O: radical, then the O: radical can react with H2O to generate two ·OH radicals. Due to the process of oxygen consumption, the ·OH radicals increased markedly, becoming the dominant active component for the deep oxidation of small molecules in stage II. Note that the evolution of reaction steps are not limited to the path discussed in this paper, the steps emphatically point out are generally the kinetic favorite route, which are also the prominently observed via ReaxFF MD simulations. For example, TMB or small molecules also could be oxidized by oxygen molecules directly, nevertheless they are more kinetic favorite induced and oxidized by ·OH free radicals (see Fig. S5 in Supplementary material). The generated C1-C3 small molecules were oxidized deeply mainly into CO in stage II. Fig. 9 (a) illustrates the evolution paths of typical small molecules, such as C2H2O, C2H2O2, CH4O and CH2O and so on. The C3 fragments were further cracked into C2 (·C2H) and C1 (CH3· or CH2:) radical fragments, the radical fragments could easily combine with ·OH radicals to form the hydroxyl structure, and the H atoms connected with C or hydroxyl O were captured by ·OH radicals. The final CO was produced through the continuous oxidation and dehydrogenation induced by ·OH radicals. The free energy and enthalpies calculated by DFT were also obtained, shown in Fig. 9(b)(c). The overall thermal energy released by the representative ·C2H and CH3· molecules oxidation were high to -1659.60 kJ/mol and -1347.01 kJ/mol respectively. Because of the large amounts of C2 and C1 molecules in stage II (as shown in Fig. 4), the thermal energy released in this stage is rather higher than that of stage I. As a result, the temperature of the hermetic system showed sharp rise. In consequence of the deep oxidation mechanisms, the overall temperature rise rate and maximum temperature of TMB/H2O2 mixture is much higher than that of pure H2O2, as shown in Fig. S6 in Supplementary material. which is consistent with the experimental results in literature (Chi et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014; Wu and Qian, 2018). The deep oxidation reactions explain the mechanism of the larger potential hazard of H2O2-organics mixture than that of pure H2O2. According to the ReaxFF MD simulation and combining DFT kinetic and thermal properties calculations, the detailed reaction mechanisms of TMB/H2O2 are obtained and the main reaction routes is diagramed in Fig. 10 . The thermal runaway process is divided to two stages, stage I is the thermal initiation process, and stage II is the rapid thermal runaway process. In stage I, the ·OH radicals generated during H2O2 decomposition process induced the initial formation of TMB radicals, and the methyl side chain of TMB was oxidized by ·OH radicals to produce benzaldehyde or phenol. The thermal energy released by initiation reactions evoked the opening and cracking of benzene ring. It can be revealed that controlling the initiation reactions could inhibit the follow-up thermal runaway efficiently, and the ·OH radical is the key specie for the initiation reactions. It's safe to assume that the measures to control and reduce the concentration of ·OH radical, such as controlling the concentration of H2O2 or adding stabilizer to inhibit the decomposition of H2O2, can be referred for the development of explosion prevention methods. In stage II, the amount of OH radicals increased markedly for the consumption of oxygen, and the small molecules derived from TMB cracking were oxidized deeply under the action of ·OH radicals, with massive thermal energy released. ·OH radical also plays a key role in the rapid thermal runaway process. The concentration of ·OH radical generated from O2 or originally from H2O2, and the concentration of TMB determine the intensity of runaway hazard. So the concentration of H2O2 and organics in the mixture should be controlled outside the explosion range. And measures to reduce the concentration of ·OH radical, dilution or capture of ·OH, can effectively reduce the reaction activity of explosion system."
8,Conclusion,"This study presented atomic insights into the thermal runaway process of H2O2 and organics (TMB) mixture using a new approach of combining ReaxFF MD and DFT calculations. The dynamic migrating trends of reactants, major radicals, products, and the detailed reaction pathways of TMB/H2O2 mixture were obtained through ReaxFF MD simulations. The kinetic and thermal parameters of the main reaction steps were determined by DFT calculations. The simulations results were validated by comparing their predictions of typical products and reaction heat with experimental data. In this work, the thermal runaway process was divided into two stages. Stage I is the thermal initiation process, H2O2 molecules were decomposed first to generate ·OOH and ·OH free radicals. The ·OH radicals induced the initial oxidation of TMB molecular through H-abstraction and ·OH-combine reaction steps with the highest thermal energy of 921.76 kJ/mol released, which were the key steps for the thermal initiation. The initiation reactions provided the thermal energy for opening and cracking of benzene ring. In the rapid thermal runaway process of stage II, once the generated small molecules are further oxidized, the reactions show a runaway process for the massive thermal energy released, resulting in the larger explosive hazard of H2O2-organics mixture than that of pure H2O2. The ·OH radical was the most important free radical carrier both for the thermal initiation and thermal runaway process, it indicates that the methods of controlling and reducing the concentration of ·OH radical would inhibit or weaken thermal runaway process efficiently. This work not only will help researchers and industrial practitioners to better understand the intrinsic thermal hazard of H2O2-organics, but also provides a general new atomic insight into the thermal runaway process of hazardous organic chemicals, and offers theoretical guides for the development of efficient explosion suppression methods."
