0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is an environmentally benign energy carrier and also has wide applications in chemical and petroleum industries [1–3]. Hydrogen can be produced from fossil fuels, biomass, water and industrial by-products, by varieties of technologies including electrolysis of water [4–9], steam reforming [10,11], partial oxidation reforming [12,13], and autothermal reforming [14,15], etc. At present, the most widely used technology for hydrogen production in industry is steam reforming of natural gas. However, hydrogen production via steam reforming of coke oven gas (COG), a major gaseous by-product of coking process, mainly consisting of 54–59 vol% H2, 24–28 vol% CH4, 6–8 vol% CO and a few higher hydrocarbons, theoretically shows higher energy efficiency and has lower CO2 emissions [16]. The annual production of COG reaches 119 billion cubic meters in China [17]. Nevertheless, nearly half of COG is discharged to the environment directly, causing serious air pollution and great energy waste [18]. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is commonly used in industries to recover H2 from COG, but its hydrogen recovery ratio is only 71%–85%. The residual H2, CH4, CO and other higher hydrocarbons are usually abandoned [19–21]. Upgradation of COG by steam reforming [22–25], partial oxidation [26–28], and dry reforming [29,30], has been extensively studied. Steam reforming of COG (SRCOG), or desorption gas after PSA, could amplify the H2 recovery efficiency to several times since excessive hydrogen could be from steam [31]. However, SRCOG still is a highly endothermic process and possesses a large amount of CO2 release [32]. A more energy-saving and sustainable alternative of SRCOG is sorption-enhanced steam reforming of COG (SE-SRCOG), which fixes CO2 in-situ by a proper sorbent, so facilitates higher hydrogen production and feedstock conversion at moderate temperatures [33–36]. Xie et al. performed thermodynamic analysis of SE-SRCOG process and H2 purity of 95% was achieved at the temperature of 600 °C [20]. Wu et al. investigated the kinetic behavior of the sorption-enhanced reforming process of COG, and demonstrated that surface reaction of steam methane reforming in the SE-SRCOG process was the rate-determine step [33]. More importantly, regeneration of saturated sorbent then produces high-purity CO2 suitable for use or sequestration. The ideal sorbent of SE-SRCOG should possess fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity, promising adsorption stability and also low cost [37,38]. CaO-based sorbents such as limestone could be a promising candidate of CO2 acceptor for SE-SRCOG [39], due to the advantages of high CO2 uptake, sufficient reaction efficiency, abundant reserves, wide distribution and low price, which met the demand for economic operation of SE-SRCOG. However, limestone-derived CaO suffered serious pore structure decay and surface sintering at high temperatures, resulting in a tremendously dropping of cyclic performance [40]. Recently, a promising novel technique combining re-utilization of Ca-based industrial wastes and CO2 capture attracted extensive attention from researchers, due to the advantages of diverse sources, low cost, environmentally friendly and easy to scale application of industrials wastes-derived sorbent. In addition, industrials wastes-derived sorbent possessed a better CO2 capture stability, because the presence of the anti-sintering species in the sorbent could effectively prevent CaO grains from sintering [40]. Steel slag was a main by-product of steel production with high calcium content. Currently, more than 100 Mt a−1 steel slag was produced in China [41]. However, only 20% of the steel slag produced annually was utilized, and the other 80% was stockpiled in the open air, causing a serious of environmental pollution and safety problems. Researchers have made lots of studies on the recycling of steel slag over the last few years since the annually cumulated slag wastes have brought a great burden for the long-term strategy of sustainable development [42] Steel slag-steam reaction was demonstrated to be a promising solution towards energy recovery and environmental remediation by Li et al., and provided the possibility of iron recovering through magnetic separation, because the magnetic properties of steel slag after steam oxidation was greatly enhanced [43]. Said et al. designed, constructed and tested the world's first mineral carbonation pilot plant test facility that converts steel slag and CO2 into precipitated calcium carbonate, making a major step forward commercialization of CO2 sequestration by mineral [44]. On the other hand, calcium, iron, and magnesium contents in steel slag made this solid compound catalytically active for steam reforming reactions [45,46]. In addition, integration of steel slag into cement production was an efficient strategy to reduce steel slag release in large scale. However, low hydration activity and volume instability caused by RO phase and f-CaO in steel slag limited its utilization as raw meal of cement. Chen et al. [47] reported that hydration activity of steel slag was improved through carbonation, and so as the mechanical properties and volume stability on account of the consumption of MgO and f-CaO. If high-performance CaO-based sorbent for SE-SRCOG could be economically derived from steel slag, then high-purity hydrogen production from COG, and also integration of the ultimate deactivated sorbents into cement, could be achieved simultaneously. Recently, an acid leaching approach used for the treatment of steel slag has attacked widespread attention because calcium was rapidly and efficiently extracted from steel slag, and the CO2 uptake of steel slag was significantly improved [48]. Kuwahara et al. applied concentrated hydrochloric acid as the leaching agent but majority of aluminum was undesirably leached from waste slag [49]. Murakami et al. used formic acid for selective leaching, and found that calcium and magnesium could be effectively leached [50]. Using acetic acid as the leaching solvent, Tian et al. synthesized a steel slag-derived CaO-based sorbent, which showed a more stable cyclic sorption capacity than pure CaO [51]. The subsequent utilization of leaching residue (LR) has also received much attention due to high iron and silicon content. The optimum conditions for the elution treatment of Ca in blast furnace slag were investigated by Murakami et al., and zeolite A was synthesized using blast furnace leaching slag [50]. Zhang et al. used titanium white waste acid as leaching agent to extract vanadium from vanadium-bearing steel slag and the leaching residue was used as additive in cement industry [52]. In this paper, cyclic catalytic steam reforming of coke oven gas for hydrogen production, assisted by a steel slag-derived CaO, was experimentally studied. Previous to the cyclic SE-SRCOG tests, cycling carbonation-calcination tests for CaO(SS) prepared by impregnation using 5 different concentrations of acetic acid solution were studied. Subsequently, CaO(SS) with the best cyclic CO2 sorption efficiency was applied to the cyclic SE-SRCOG experiments, and impacts of operating modes (with different particles contents and loading patterns) on cyclic SE-SRCOG performance were investigated and compared thoroughly. Finally, calcined leaching residue was integrated into the CaO(SS), to further improve the stability of CaO(SS) in cyclic SE-SRCOG. Samples before and after tests were thoroughly analyzed by CO2-TPD, SEM-EDS, and BET characterizations, to correlate the reforming activity and physicochemical properties of sorbent-catalyst samples."
1,Experimental section,"The synergistic utilization of steel slag and coke oven gas based on cyclic SE-SRCOG has been illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). High-purity H2 from the reformer was supplied to hydrogen refueling stations, and CO2 collected from the calciner was delivered to chemical plant, while the deactivated sorbent after multiple reforming cycles was utilized for cement production. Experimental implementations of this conception, including steel slag sorbent derivation, cyclic carbonation-calcination tests (Fig. S1), and cyclic SE-SRCOG experiments (Fig. S2) were described in following sections and Supporting Material. Detailed operation conditions for the cyclic carbonation-calcination and SE-SRCOG tests were listed in Table 1 . According to the particles contents and loading patterns, four different operating modes of cyclic SE-SRCOG, as illustrated by Fig. 1(b) and described in Table 2 , were compared experimentally in this study, including (I) mechanically mixing, by which the catalyst and sorbent powers (dp < 0.25 mm) were first tableted respectively, then were crushed and sieved to obtain the particles with size of 0.55–0.83 mm, and finally were uniformly mixed; (II) one-body combined by directly tableting, by which the catalyst and sorbent powers (dp < 0.25 mm) were first mixed thoroughly and then compressed directly by a tableting machine, followed by crushed and sieved to obtain the sample with size of 0.55–0.83 mm; (III) one-body combined by adhesively tableting, by which the catalyst and sorbent powers (dp < 0.25 mm) were firstly mixed thoroughly in an aqueous solution of 10 wt% polyvinyl alcohol as a binder followed by dried and calcined, then the calcined sample was ground and tableted, and finally was crushed and sieved to obtained the desired samples; (IV) layered packing, by which the catalyst and the sorbent particles (0.55–0.83 mm) were divided into six layers respectively and filled into the reactor in turn."
2,Sorbent and catalyst preparation,"2.1 Sorbent and catalyst preparation Raw steel slag collected from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group was used to prepare CaO-based CO2 sorbents, by an acid extraction followed by precipitation approach. Fresh steel slag was mechanically ground to particles size <120 μm before use. The slag powder was mixed with different concentrations of acetic acid solution (0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 mol/L) at a solid-liquid ratio of 1g to 10 mL. Then, the solution was stirred mechanically at a speed of 600 rpm at room temperature for 40min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at a speed of 3800 rpm for 10min, to separate the leachate from the residue using a low-speed centrifuge (Cence TDZ4-WS). The steel slag leachate and leaching residue were dried overnight in a drying oven at 120 °C, and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 900 °C for 2h to obtain the required CO2 sorbents and calcined residue, respectively. Finally, the resulting CO2 sorbent and calcined residue were ground and sieved, with the particles size of <250 μm collected. CaO(SS)-x represents CO2 sorbents derived from steel slag, with x denoting the concentration of acetic acid solutions. CaO obtained by calcination of calcium acetate monohydrate (≥98%, Macklin) at 900 °C for 2h, denoted as CaO(CA), was employed as a comparison. The resulting sorbent was ground and sieved, with the particle size of <250 μm being collected. Preparation of Ni-CaO/Al2O3 catalyst has been described detailly in our previous studies [53]. Unless otherwise specified, the sorbent and catalyst particles (0.55–0.83 mm) used in later tests were prepared from powders obtained in previous steps, using a tableting machine (BJ-15, Tianjin Bojun Technology Co., Ltd.) under a pressure of 30 MPa. The resulting sheets were crushed in a mortar and then sieved to obtain the particles in range of 0.55–0.83 mm. The collected particles were dried at room temperature before storage."
3,Sample characterizations,"2.2 Sample characterizations Elemental compositions of the samples were quantitatively analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using an XRF-1800 Analyzer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Textual properties of the samples were determined using an Autosorb-iQ (Quantachrome) analyzer. The crystallinity of the samples was studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on an AXS D8 Advance (Bruker). The micromorphology of the samples was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7401F). The microscope was also fitted with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) for elemental analysis. The strength of interaction between metal oxide and support was studied by the temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). Temperature-programmed desorption profiles of CO2 (CO2-TPD) were obtained on the fixed-bed reforming reactor equipped with a mass spectrometer (TILON). Temperature-programmed desorption profiles of CO2 (CO2-TPD) on the fresh raw steel slag and CaO(SS)-1.0 samples were obtained on the fixed-bed reactor equipped with a mass spectrometer (TILON). Before the CO2-TPD experiment, the samples were treated in a 100 ml/min N2 flow at 800 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the reactor was cooled to 600 °C, and the CO2 adsorption was performed for 2 h under 50 mL/min of CO2 balanced with 50 mL/min of N2. After completion of CO2 adsorption, the reactor was purged with pure N2 (100 ml/min), cooled to 100 °C, and then heated from 100 °C to 1100 °C under a N2 flow of 100 mL/min at a rate of 5 °C min−1 while monitoring CO2 signals in the outlet stream."
4,Evaluation parameters for SE-SRCOG,"2.3 Evaluation parameters for SE-SRCOG The mass flow rate of carrier gas N2 in product gas was recorded by a gas flowmeter during each test, and the volume fractions of N2 in the product gas was measured by the GC. Therefore, mass flow rate of the total product gas as well as each gas component can be calculated based on nitrogen balance method, as Eq. (1): (1) F o u t , i = F i n , N 2 C N 2 × C i where F out,i is the outlet volume flow of spices i (i = CH4, CO, H2, CO2), mLSTP/min; F in,N2 represents the inlet volume flow of N2 recorded by the mass flowmeter, mLSTP/min; C N2 represents the volume concentration of N2 in the product gas, vol%; C i is the volume concentration of spices i in the product gas, vol%. CH4 conversion X CH4, used to evaluate the reforming performance, was calculated as Eq. (2): (2) X C H 4 = F i n , C H 4 − F o u t , C H 4 F i n , C H 4 × 100 % Where F in, CH4 and F out, CH4 represents the volumetric flow rate of CH4 in inlet and outlet stream, respectively. The CO selectivity S CO was calculated as Eq. (3): (3) S C O = F o u t , C O F i n , C H 4 + F i n , C O × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterizations of as-prepared catalyst and sorbent,"3.1 Characterizations of as-prepared catalyst and sorbent Raw steel slag was a promising feedstock for the synthesis of CaO-based CO2 sorbent due to its high calcium content. The inert compositions in raw steel slag could be leached into the leachate, and improved the anti-sintering performance of CaO(SS)-x [48]. Our primary temperature-programmed desorption test has verified that the acid leaching method could efficiently improve CO2 sorption capacity of CaO-based sorbent derived from steel-slag, as presented by Fig. S3. To study the leaching rule of the components from raw steel slag extracted by acid solution with different concentrations, the major elemental compositions (expressed in the form of oxides) of these CaO(SS)-x were determined by X-ray fluorescence, as presented in Fig. 2 (a) and Table S1. CaO was the major ingredient of all as-prepared CaO(SS)-x investigated. However, CaO concentration in the CaO(SS)-x decreased from 92.843% to 70.132% as increasing the acid solution concentration from 0.5 to 5.0 mol/L. This was mainly because the leaching capacity of Fe and Mg was significantly improved as using higher acid concentration as extracting agent. The elements exhibited different leaching behaviors, mainly due to the considerable diversity in their inherent characteristic properties [54]. The weight fraction of Fe2O3 and MgO in CaO(SS) samples increased remarkably from 0.074% to 3.480%, to 9.695% and 9.087% respectively, when the acid concentration increased from 0.5 to 5.0 mol/L. Although the content of MnO and SiO2 in CaO(SS)-x increased when the acid concentration increased, a little content of MnO (5.110%) and SiO2 (3.067%) was detected when using 5.0 mol/L acid as extracting agent. The interaction between CaO and stabilizer largely determined the CO2 capture capacity of CaO(SS)-x. These solid inert phases on the interface would improve the sintering-resistance of CaO particles and prolong its durability, although they decreased the content of CaO in CaO(SS)-x. When using 3.0 or 5.0 mol/L acid as extracting agent, leachate and sorbent powder exhibited the dark red appearance depicted by Fig. S4, due to the high Fe species content shown in Table S1. The calcined leaching residue was mainly composed of 28.10% Fe2O3, 24.02% CaO and 22.41% SiO2. The XRD patterns of CaO(SS)-x, LR and Ni-based catalyst were showed in Fig. 3 . Successful loading of nickel was confirmed by NiO diffraction peaks of fresh catalyst. For the reduced catalyst, the disappearance of NiO peaks and appearance of metallic Ni peaks were observed, which meant NiO was reduced to Ni successfully. CaO peaks were detected for all CaO(SS)-x samples and the peaks intensity decreased with the increase of acid concentration, implying the content of CaO in sorbent decreased, which was in accordance with the XRF results. The peaks belonging to Ca(OH)2 were also detected for all steel slag-derived sorbents, which was mainly attributed to the hygroscopic nature of the Ca-based materials [37]. Some weak peaks belonging to calcium aluminum oxide were also detected. The patterns of all the sorbents showed weak diffraction peak assigned to MgO, which may act as framework to prevent pore structure from sintering in sorption-desorption tests [55]. Noted that, the diffraction peaks belonging to Fe2O3 were observed in CaO(SS)-3.0 and CaO(SS)-5.0 due to the fact that high concentration acid possessed strong leaching capacity for Fe, which may be a promoter for SE-SRCOG process. The presence of MgO and Fe2O3 may improve CO2 sorption capacity of the sorbent, which was attributed to that the presence of metals facilitated diffusion and mobility of O2−, thereby enhancing the interaction of oxygen surface atoms with CO2 molecules [56,57]. No diffraction peaks assigned to manganese oxide and silicon dioxide were found by XRD pattern, although Mn and Si were detected by XRF results (Table S1). The phenomenon could be explained by the low content of Mn and Si, making it difficult to detect, or the overlap of Ca3Mn2O7 and Ca2SiO4 solid solution peaks by Fe2O3 peaks (2θ = 33.1°). The main characteristic peaks of Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and Ca2SiO4 were seen in the pattern of LR. Fig. 4 showed the TPR profiles of the catalyst, mechanically mixed catalyst and sorbent samples, and catalyst-sorbent samples combined by adhesively tableting. Obviously, the single catalyst system exhibited four reduction peaks at 305, 418, 522 and 695 °C, corresponding to amorphous NiO, free NiO, bulk NiO and NiAl2O4, respectively [58,59]. Compared with the pure catalyst, mechanically mixed catalyst-sorbent particles and combined catalyst-sorbent particles showed a new reduction peak at about 533 °C, which may be assigned to the reduction of iron oxides in sorbent. Combined catalyst-sorbent samples offered a weaker peak at ∼315 °C and stronger peak at ∼458 °C than mechanically mixed samples, indicating the transfer of amorphous NiO to free NiO due to the addition of CaO. The morphology of fresh and cycled CaO(CA) and CaO(SS)-1.0 was imaged using scanning electron microscopy and shown in Fig. S5. Over 35 sorption-desorption cycles, morphology of CaO(SS)-1.0 sorbent did not change appreciably. The high thermal stability of the steel slag-derived sorbent was mainly because MgO and SiO2 hindered the sintering of CaO grains. However, the cycled CaO(CA) offered severe sintering over 35 sorption-desorption cycles due to lack of a thermal stable framework. Physical properties of the fresh and cycled sorbents were summarized in Table 3 . The specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the catalyst were 23.58 m2 g−1, 2.05 cm3 g−1 and 6.75 nm. The fresh CaO(SS)-x possessed a similar BET surface area and pore volume, which was slightly higher than that of fresh CaO(CA). The high surface area and pore volume favored the intra-particle diffusion of CO2 in sorption-desorption tests. However, when x decreased from 5.0 to 0.5, the reduction of surface area and pore volume for the fresh and cycled sorbents was more and more severe, and drastically reduction of surface area and pore volume from 17.01 m2/g and 0.05 cm3/g to 7.99 m2/g and 0.02 cm3/g was also observed for fresh and cycled CaO(CA) in Table 3. These changes were confirmed by the micrograph presented in Fig. S5 showing the comparatively nonporous structure of cycled CaO(CA)."
7,Cyclic carbonation/calcination performance,"3.2 Cyclic carbonation/calcination performance The cyclic CO2 sorption/desorption capacity of CaO(SS)-x and CaO(CA) was compared in Fig. 2(b). CaO(SS)-1.0 possessed the highest initial sorption capacity of 0.6 gCO2/gCaO, and even though it showed a decrease in sorption capacity, a stable CO2 uptake of 0.27 gCO2/gCaO has been achieved after 35 cyclic sorption/desorption tests. Whereas, CaO(CA) showed the worst cyclic performance, dropping from 0.43 gCO2/gCaO to only 0.1 gCO2/gCaO at the 35th cycle, due to the pore closures caused by sintering of CaO grain, as evidenced by the SEM images (Fig. S5) and severe decline in BET surface area, pore volume and average pore size of cycled CaO(CA) (Table 3). Steel slag-derived CO2 sorbents exhibited a more stable CO2 sorption capacity, mainly due to the MgO and SiO2, which delayed the sintering of CaO grains at high temperature and improved the pore structure stability of CaO(SS)-x [60]. Neverthless, sintering of CaO-x still took place with the cycling, which was confirmed by the decreased surface area (Table 3) but was much less severe than that in CaO(CA). Noted that, although CaO(SS)-0.5 possessed the largest CaO content of 92.8%, CO2 sorption capacity was only 0.29 gCO2/gCaO at the 1st cycle, as presented in Fig. 2(b). This could be explained by the lower BET surface area of the fresh CaO(SS)-0.5, which led to fewer active sites for CO2 sorption. In addition, self-reactivation phenomenon [32,61,62], an increase in the CO2 capture capacity during the first several cycles, was observed only for CaO(SS)-5.0. Ma et al. [63] also synthesized a low-cost Ca-based CO2 sorbent from high alumina cement, carbide slag, and the by-product of biodiesel, which exhibited a high initial CO2 capture capacity of 0.63 gCO2/gCaO and maintained to 0.31 gCO2/gCaO after 30 cycles. Therefore, CaO(SS)-1.0 was employed for the following cyclic SE-SRCOG tests. TGA analysis, as shown in Fig. S6, also confirmed that CaO(SS)-1.0 possessed significant better CO2 capture capacity and kinetics than CaO(SS)-0.5 and CaO(SS)-5.0."
8,Evaluation of intermediate reduction step effects,"3.3 Evaluation of intermediate reduction step effects Fig. 5 (a), (b) compared the effects of intermediate reduction step (in 50/50 vol% H2/N2 stream, for 20min at 800 °C) after each regeneration step, on H2 outlet concentration and CH4 conversion of SE-SRCOG for selected cycles, respectively. In the post-breakthrough period of cyclic SE-SRCOG with intermediate reduction step, H2 purity and CH4 conversion can be maintained at about 72% and 70% as the reforming-regeneration cycles went on, respectively. However, in cases without intermediate reduction step, they were decreased from 71% to 82% at the 1st cycle to 51% and 11% at the 5th cycle, respectively. The reforming-regeneration cycles with intermediate reduction step offered more stable H2 purity and CH4 conversion in the pre-breakthrough stage over the first five cycles, with H2 purity of 96% and CH4 conversion of 87% in the 5th cycle, respectively. Whereas, in cases without intermediate reduction step, H2 concentration and CH4 conversion decreased sharply from 97% to 94% in the 1st cycle, to 81% and 32% in the 5th cycle, respectively. As seen in Fig. 5(a), the promotion effects of CaO(SS) were identical as the SE-SRCOG cycles continued, in cases whether with or without intermediate reduction step, implying the catalytic efficiency decay was mainly responsible for the serious decline of H2 purity and CH4 conversion in cyclic SE-SRCOG without intermediate reduction step. Phases of the catalysts used in cases with and without intermediate reduction step were then determined by XRD, as presented in Fig. S7. Stronger metallic Ni peaks were detected in catalyst sample from cyclic SE-SRCOG without intermediate reduction step, with a bigger metal nickel grains of 42.2 nm, while crystal size of nickel of catalyst in operation with intermediate reduction was estimated to be only 13.8 nm. Sintering of Ni grains was supposed to be the main cause for the poor stability of cyclic SE-SRCOG without intermediate reduction steps. Moreover, compared with steam reforming of COG without sorbent, the pre-breakthrough stage of SE-SRCOG achieved higher hydrogen purity and CH4 conversion, which was attributed to the sorption enhancement of steel slag-derived CaO. In general, an intermediate reduction step between SE-SRCOG cycles was employed to maintain the catalytic activity of the Ni-based catalyst."
9,Evaluation of operating modes effects,"3.4 Evaluation of operating modes effects H2 purity and CH4 conversion in the pre-breakthrough and post-breakthrough stage during SE-SRCOG with different operating modes were shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Table S2, Mode I, II, III and IV represent mechanically mixed mono-functional particles, combined bi-functional particles by directly tableting, combined bi-functional particles by adhesively tableting, and layered packed mono-functional particles, respectively. Obvious sorption enhancement was observed for the four operating modes from the discrepancy between H2 purity, CH4 conversion achieved in pre-breakthrough and post-breakthrough stage. In the 1st cycle, SE-SRCOG of the four operating modes showed almost similar high CH4 conversion (∼95%) and outlet H2 purity (∼98%) in the pre-breakthrough stage. Comparing to the mono-functional particles employed by operating mode I and IV, bi-functional particles (with Ni and CaO in one particle) used by mode II and III should be more advantageous, given that it offered lower diffusion resistance and improved access to the sorbent sites [64]. However, from the beginning of the 2nd cycle, bi-functional particles sample exhibited significant decline of CH4 conversion and H2 purity, in both the pre-breakthrough and post-breakthrough stages. Furthermore, in the pre-breakthrough stage of the 10th cycle, mono-functional particles sample offered H2 purity of >83% and CH4 conversion of >56%, much higher than that of bi-functional particles sample. SEM micrograph and EDS mapping of the spent combined catalyst-sorbent employed by operating mode III after the 10th reforming test were shown in Fig. 7 . More severe sintering and larger grains were observed in the spent combined catalyst-sorbent samples, which resulted in the loss of Ni active sites, and so led to the poor stability of cyclic SE-SRCOG tests. Obviously, coverage of Ni site by CaCO3, indicating by overlapping of C, Al and Ni elements (especially at the adjacent zones of sorbent and catalyst grains, marked with blue dot line), was detected in the spent combined catalyst-sorbent samples. Catalyst-sorbent samples combined by adhesively tableting suffered more severe coverage of Ni site, so offered more poor stability than that by directly tableting. As for the two mono-functional samples employed in operating mode I and IV, almost equal H2 purity and CH4 conversion during the pre-breakthrough stage were observed for the first five cycles, although it slightly decreased from 98% to 95% in 1st cycle to 95% and 87% in 5th cycle, respectively. However, in the 10th cycle, SE-SRCOG carried out via layered packing operating mode IV offered H2 purity of 87% and CH4 conversion of 65%, slightly higher than that of mechanically mixing operating mode I. As shown in Fig. S8, cyclic SE-SRCOG operated with mode IV has much slower decay of pre-breakthrough period, confirming the better stability of cyclic SE-SRCOG using layered packing samples. In addition, layer-packing configuration of steel slag derivates - catalyst bed provided a more efficient way to collect the saturation steel slag derivates, because separation of catalyst pellets was avoided, so integration of the collected steel slag derivates into cement production would be more economic. To explain the stability of layered packed samples, element distributions of the spent materials collected from the 10th reforming test of operating mode I and IV were compared in Fig. 8 and Fig. S9, respectively. As marked by the red cycle in Fig. 8(c), Ca agglomeration was observed due to the interaction between catalyst and sorbent particles, which resulted in the loss of active Ni sites. Fig. S9 showed that the used catalyst and sorbent from layered packing operating mode had a uniform distribution of Ni and improved BET surface area (Table 4 ), respectively. Besides, layered packing operating mode offered lower cost for further utilization of the spent sorbent in cement industry due to that it avoided separation of catalyst and sorbent particles. Hence, the layered packing operating mode was adopted in the subsequent cyclic SE-SRCOG experiments."
10,Evaluation of LR effects,"3.5 Evaluation of LR effects To realize the utilization of LR, integration of LR into the sorbent was initially investigated. Specifically, the mixture of LR and CaO(SS)-1.0 sorbent powder (<250 μm) was thoroughly mixed, tableted, crushed and sieved to obtain the particles in range of 0.55–0.83 mm, and the mixture and catalyst were layered filled into the reactor. Fig. 9 showed the effects of weight ratio of LR in CaO(SS)-1.0 on the H2 purity and CH4 conversion of cyclic SE-SRCOG. The pre-breakthrough period was of practical interest in that high concentration of H2 can be stable achieved during this period. The catalytic kinetics and sorption kinetics determined the reforming performance synergistically at pre-breakthrough stage. Whereas, at the post-breakthrough stage, CO2 sorption kinetics was extreme slow due to saturation of sorbent, so catalytic reaction dominated the reforming performance. As shown in Fig. 9(a), obvious sorption enhancement was observed from the discrepancy between H2 purity of pre-breakthrough and post-breakthrough stages. For the first 3 cycles, effects of LR integration on the H2 purity and CH4 conversion during the pre-breakthrough period were not obvious. However, from the 5th cycle, improved H2 purity and CH4 conversion were achieve even only 10 wt% LR was integrated to the CaO(SS)-1.0. In the 10th cycle, H2 purity and CH4 conversion increased from 87% to 65%–94% and 86% individually, when the content of LR increased from 0 wt% to 10 wt%. As the LR content continued to rise to 50 wt%, no obvious increased of H2 purity was observed, but CH4 conversion increased from 86% to 91%. As shown in Table S2, the decay rate of the pre-breakthrough period between 1st cycle and 10th cycle gradually decreased from 80% to 40% as LR content increased from 0 wt% to 50 wt%, proving that LR can obviously improve the stability of CaO(SS)-0.1 in cyclic SE-SRCOG. Fig. 10 showed TEM/EDX mapping of the spent mixture of LR and CaO(SS) after 10 SE-SRCOG cycles. The homogeneous distribution of Ca, Fe and Si was observed, suggesting that Fe and Si species in LR could effectively prevent CaO grains from sintering, thus resulting in a better cyclic stability of steel slag derivates. Similar phenomenon was confirmed by Felice et al. [64]. Tian et al. [51] investigated the influence of concomitant elements (Mg, Al, Fe and Mn) of steel slag-derived sorbent on its CO2 capture performance, and found that all of the doped sorbents displayed better cyclic stability for CO2 capture, except for the Fe-doped sorbent, which suffered the largest decay in CO2 capture capacity. This was mainly because the low resistance to sintering of Ca2Fe2O5 in the Fe-doped sorbent. However, the MgO, CaMnO3 and Ca12Al14O33 in the Mg-, Mn- and Al-doping sorbent effectively stabilized CaO grains due to its sintering-resistance at high temperatures, resulting in better cyclic stability for CO2 capture. Compared with several promising sorbents stabilized by a Mg support [65], Al support [66], or other refractory supports [67], integration of LR into steel slag-derived sorbent undoubtedly was more economical and environmentally friendly. SRCOG was then carried out using layered packing catalyst and LR/quartz sand (as alternative of sorbent) compounds. As shown in Fig. 11 (a), CH4 conversion increased from 75% to 80% and CO selectivity decreased from 23% to 21%, proving the promotion of LR on steam-methane reforming reactions, which may be attributed to the synergistic catalysis of Fe species in LR on WGS reaction. Besides, the spent sorbent with a suitable Ca/Si, adjusted by LR content in sorbent compounds, can be directly used in cement clinker production. Fig. 11(b) displays CO2-TPD profiles for mechanically mixed catalyst and sorbent, combined catalyst-sorbent and layered packed catalyst and CaO(SS)-LR samples. A weak and broad desorption peak centered at ∼250 °C is observed in samples containing LR due to sorption effects of LR components. The temperature corresponding to the strongest peak of the spent samples containing LR is lower than that of combined catalyst-sorbent and the mixture of catalyst and CaO(SS)-1.0, proving that LR can improve the stability of the pore structure of sorbents during cyclic SE-SRCOG. Although CO2 desorption occurs at a lower temperature (∼500 °C) for the combined samples, CO2 release continued even after 1100 °C, while desorption was already completed at about 930 °C over CaO(SS)-10 wt% LR samples. This indicates CO2 inside the grains of spent combined sample is difficult to release because of the large diffusion resistance caused by decay of micro-pore structures. A strong desorption peak centered at ∼950 °C was also observed at the CO2-TPD profile for the mixture of catalyst and CaO(SS)-50 wt% LR compounds, which may assign to the decomposition of the CaCO3 formed by CaO grains in LR. Table 4 listed the physical properties of the fresh and spent samples from above tests. Calcined combined catalyst-sorbent samples possessed a high BET surface area and pore volume of 73.52 m2 g−1 and 0.147 cm3 g−1 due to the decomposition of the binder. Decrease of surface area and pore volume was observed for the sorbent from mechanically mixing catalyst-sorbent samples over 10 reforming cycles. However, increase of surface area and pore volume occurred in the sorbent from layered packing samples. When integrating LR into CaO(SS), almost 4-folds increased of surface area was found in the spent sorbent, which explained the good stability of the CaO(SS)-LR compounds. Note that rich-pore structures in the spent CaO(SS)-50 wt% LR compounds was observed from the SEM images (Fig. S10), and also was evidenced by the reduction of average pore diameters, indicating LR could act as sintering-resistant spacer during cyclic SE-SRCOG due to the presence of Fe2O3, MgO and SiO2. Resultantly, with the synergistic assistance of catalysis promotions from Fe species of LR on WGS and its sintering resistance, integration of LR into CaO(SS) greatly enhanced cyclic stability and H2 production efficiency of SE-SRCOG."
11,Conclusion,"In this study, a cheap and sintering-resistance CaO-based sorbent was prepared from low-cost waste steel slag. This steel slag-derived CaO was applied as CO2 acceptor in cyclic SE-SRCOG process, to enhance hydrogen production and fix CO2. Effects of leaching acid concentration on the CO2 capture capacity of steel slag-derived CaO were investigated by cyclic sorption-desorption tests. Impacts of intermediate reduction step between reforming-calcination stages, combining and packing patterns of catalyst-sorbent particles, and integration of LR into sorbent on stability of cyclic SE-SRCOG were studied in detail. When using 1 mol/L acetic acid solution as leaching solution, the prepared steel slag-derived CaO showed a stable CO2 capture capacity of 0.27 gCO2/gCaO after 35 sorption-desorption cycles, mainly due to MgO and SiO2 in sorbent served as stable spacers for hindering the sintering. An intermediate reduction step between reforming-regeneration stages was found to be able to prevent sintering of Ni grains, and so to maintain the catalytic activity of the Ni-based catalyst. Combined catalyst-sorbent material possessed a poor stability, with CH4 conversion during the pre-breakthrough stage decreasing from 95% in 1st cycle to <40% in 10th cycle. This was mainly ascribed to the loss of Ni active sites caused by severe sintering and coverage by CaCO3. With a reforming temperature of 600 °C, cyclic SE-SRCOG with layered packing catalyst-sorbent particles offered a H2 purity of 95% and CH4 conversion of 87% after 5 cycles, and they were still maintained to be 87% and 65% at the 10th cycle, respectively. In operating mode using layered packed catalyst-sorbent particles, integration of LR into sorbent was demonstrated to be able to further improve CH4 conversion to 86%, hydrogen outlet concentration to 94%, and decrease CO concentration to only 1% even in the 10th reforming stage. This was attributed to the synergistic catalysis activity of Fe species and the sintering resistance of LR. Resultantly, H2 concentration over 93% and CH4 conversion of 88% was still achieved in the 10th reforming stage of SE-SRCOG operated using layered packed catalyst and CaO(SS)-20 wt% LR compounds."
