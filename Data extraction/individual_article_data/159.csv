0,Introduction,"α, β-Unsaturated esters as important intermediates and products are widely used in the field of polymer materials production, adhesives and textiles synthesis, paints and coatings preparation, pharmaceutical and essences fabrication [1]. Traditional one-step approaches to such compounds include direct esterification [2], dehydrogenation [3] and aldol reaction [4], which are described in Scheme 1 . The direct esterification method needs to prepare α, β-unsaturated acid firstly, but it is not feasible for the sterically-hindered t-BuOH. As for dehydrogenation, although it seems environmentally friendly and green sustainable, the non-recyclable and noble Pd catalysts are often required. Aldol condensation followed by dehydration is considered to be efficient for α, β-unsaturated esters fabrication from ester and aldehyde with the catalysis of solid oxide composites or ionic liquids. In addition, the Pd-catalyzed selective alkoxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes for synthesis of α, β-unsaturated esters was also developed in recent days [5]. The concept of hydrogen borrowing (HB) is an elegant strategy that used for direct alkylation of alcohol, ketone, ester, amide and amine [6,7]. Typically, noble transition-metal catalysts, such as rhodium [8], ruthenium [9,10] and iridium [11,12] are used for such type reaction. Gradually the inexpensive and high efficient earth-abundant metal catalysts of manganese [13] and cobalt [14] were designed to replace these noble metals. The cobalt complexes stabilized by PN5P ligands (triazine backbone) are highly active to catalyze the dehydrogenation of alcohol into aldehyde [14]. Besides, such PN5P ligands and cobalt complexes can be easily prepared on milligram scale and these complexes are also stable to air and moisture. Recently, the interrupted hydrogen borrowing (IHB) pathway was reported for synthesis of α-branched carbonyl compounds from corresponding ketone, methanol and nucleophile [15]. This ideal is aim to prevent hydrogen returning step of enone by subsequent conjugate addition of nucleophile onto CC bonds. Inspired by these above discoveries, the cobalt complex catalyzed O2-interrupted hydrogen borrowing (O2-IHB) system was designed to inhibit CC bonds further reduction by produced hydrogen for preparation of α, β-unsaturated ester from ester and alcohol (Scheme 1), which seems to be feasible. Herein, four types of PN5P ligands and corresponding cobalt complex catalysts were prepared, characterized and applied for our O2-IHB pathway. With the obtained optimal conditions in hand, the tolerance of such synthetic method on substrate scope and functional group was tested. Also, the catalytic dehydrogenation mechanism of alcohol was also determined after systematic investigation."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods Air- and moisture sensitive reactions were conducted under inert atmosphere (Ar or nitrogen) using Schlenk technologies or glove box. Dry solvents were obtained after re-distillation with sodium (or calcium hydride). Chemicals used for the reactions were provided by J&K, Acros and Aldich. NMR-spectra were collected at ambient temperature (25 °C) on Bruker Avance III (600 MHz for 1H and 13C) and JNM-ECA600 (600 MHz for 31P). Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the residual solvent signal (CD2Cl2: 5.32 ppm (1H), 54.0 ppm (13C), CDCl3: 7.26 ppm (1H), 77.5 ppm (13C)), and the H3PO4 solution (85%) was selected as standard for 31P spectra. GC–MS analyses were carried out on a GCMS-QP2020 (Shimadzu) equipped with Rtx-5MS column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The single-crystal X-ray experiments were performed on a SuperNova diffractometer with Mo K α radiation. Flash column chromatography for product separation was conducted on silica gel (Normal, 100–200 meshes) and the ratio of petroleum ether to ethyl acetate changes from 6:1 to 10:1."
3,Synthesis of PN5P ligands,"2.2 Synthesis of PN5P ligands Under inert gas atmosphere a round-bottom flask with gas inlet was charged with a magnetic stirring bar and a solution of the corresponding pyridine diamine (1 eq.) in dry THF (0.1 M). The solution was firstly cooled to 0 °C and the chlorophosphine (2.1 eq.) was injected dropwise by syringe through a septum maintaining an inert gas pressure. After about 5 min stirring, triethylamine (4 eq.) was added dropwise by syringe. After that, the flask was sealed and the reaction was warmed to room temperature and then heated to 60 °C overnight. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, triethylammoniumchloride was allowed to settle down and the liquid phase was isolated by filtration. The residue was washed with THF and combined with the filtrate, followed by being concentrated and dried under high vacuum to give the PN5P ligands. The obtained crude ligands could be recrystallized in a small amount of hot toluene."
4,Preparation of cobalt complexes,"2.3 Preparation of cobalt complexes In the glove box, a Schlenk tube was charged with a magnetic stirring bar and the suspension solvent of CoCl2 (1 eq.) in THF (0.12 M). The PN5P ligand (1 eq.) was dissolved in THF (0.12 M) and added dropwise into the stirred suspension of CoCl2 leading to instant color change at room temperature. Then the tube was sealed and removed from the glove box. The mixture was kept in 60 °C overnight. The supernatant solution was filtered off and the residue was dried in vacuum giving a red crystalline powder."
5,Synthesis reaction,"2.4 Synthesis reaction In a glove box, an oven dried round-bottom flask with small side tube was charged with a magnetic bar and catalyst (also solid t-BuOK if the 1 M t-BuOK solution was replaced). The mixed reactant solution and t-BuOK solution (1 M in t-BuOH) was respectively charged into a syringe. Then the flask connected with a two-channel valve was taken out from the glove box to be equipped with a condenser and vent valve. The air in above equipment was replaced with the corresponding reaction atmosphere using Schlenk line. Then a balloon filled with the same atmosphere was connected with vent valve (the valve was opened for refluxing status and closed for sealed system). Afterwards, the reaction mixture was firstly injected into the flask through the side tube and stirred for about 5 min. Then the t-BuOK solution was added under suitable stirring speed. After that, the flask was placed into the oil bath, leading to the instant color change. When the reaction was finished, the mixture was quenched with 0.5 mL water under stirring. Then the solids in mixture was removed by Millipore PTFE syringe filter and the clear oil-phase sample was analyzed with GC part of GC–MS or purified by column chromatography."
6,Synthesis of complex 1,"2.5 Synthesis of complex 1 Typically, 150 mg Cat-1 (1 eq.) and 5 mL THF (or toluene) were charged into a Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the glove box. After stirring for about 5 min at room temperature, 61.3 mg (2 eq.) t-BuOK were added. The mixture was stirred for another 30 min (1 h if toluene was used) before 42.6 mg (1 eq.) 2, 2′-bipyridine were added to form red precipitate rapidly. Then the suspensions was heated at 50 °C for about 5 h (about 10 h if toluene was used). Afterwards, the suspensions were filtered and the red residue were washed with THF before being dried in high vacuum. The crude product were extracted with CH2Cl2 followed by the filtrate was condensed and dried in high vacuum to obtain red complex 1."
7,Synthesis of complex 2,"2.6 Synthesis of complex 2 Typically, 200 mg Cat-1 (1 eq.) and 5 mL THF (or toluene) were charged into a Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the glove box. After stirring for about 5 min at room temperature, 81.7 mg (2 eq.) t-BuOK were added. Then the mixture was stirred for 30 min (1 h if toluene was used) before 75.4 μL (2 eq.) benzyl alcohol were added. After another 30 min (1 h if toluene was used) stirring, the filtrate of above mixture was condensed and dried in high vacuum. The crude product was extracted with CH2Cl2 followed by the filtrate was condensed and dried in high vacuum to obtain the dark purple red complex 2."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalytic performance test of cobalt complexes,"3.1 Catalytic performance test of cobalt complexes Four types of PN5P ligands and corresponding cobalt complexes were synthesized, characterized and applied for our O2-IHB pathway, which were presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Material. Among these cobalt complex catalysts, the crystals of Cat-1 and Cat-3 were obtained by liquid diffusion method at room temperature and each molecular structure was also respectively determined by X-ray crystalline diffraction technology (Supplementary Material). Although the remaining Cat-2 and Cat-4 were not crystallized, the structures were also characterized with FT-IR (Supplementary Material). Then the model reaction of benzyl alcohol with t-butyl acetate to synthesize t-butyl cinnamate was selected to identify the efficient catalyst for such O2-IHB method (Table 2 ). The oxygen concentration in nitrogen for the reaction atmosphere was firstly adopted as 20%, which was equal to its component in air. This operation was in perspective from the future application of this O2-IHB process. As for base, it was considered to be vital for activation of such cobalt complexes and α-H abstraction of esters. The t-BuOK was utilized eventually according to the reported results of Deibl and Rösler [14b,16]. By comparing the results of cobalt catalysts with that of CoCl2 and blank one, Cat-1 was believed to show the highest performance. Without cobalt catalyst or CoCl2, this reaction gives only 20.9% yield of t-butyl cinnamate. With the introduction of CoCl2, the yield is still relatively low while it has increased to 31.6%. As for the synthesized cobalt catalysts, the ligands based on 4-phenyl triazine backbone is better than 4-methyl triazine, and the substituted isopropyl group on P atom is also superior to cyclohexyl. In general, the cobalt catalysts have higher activity than that of CoCl2, and only with the loading of 4 mol.% Cat-1, the yield of tert-butyl cinnamate can reach up to 52.7% at 70 °C for only 2 h reaction. On the basis of catalyst screening test, the reaction conditions were optimized (Supplementary Material). And the yield of t-butyl cinnamate can be promoted to 86.2% with almost 100% conversion of benzyl alcohol."
10,Effect of reaction atmosphere and status,"3.2 Effect of reaction atmosphere and status During condition screening, the reaction atmosphere and status were found to be crucial for this IHB procedure. As displayed in Table 3 , there’s no t-butyl cinnamate detected under Ar atmosphere in the sealed system. However, the hydrogenated product of t-butyl phenylpropionate was recorded in relatively high yield of 79.6% on GC part of GC–MS. When the status was changed to refluxing, a small amount of t-butyl cinnamate formed with liberating H2 through acceptorless dehydrogenative condensation (ADC) route. This phenomenon indicates the refluxing status is benefit for the IHB process. Indeed, the yield of t-butyl cinnamate at (refluxing / balloon) status is also higher than that of sealed system when Ar was replaced with O2 and 20% O2. Meanwhile, the color change of reaction mixture under different atmosphere is also diverse after 4 h at 80 °C (Supplementary Material). Taking note of these discoveries, the broadly applicable reaction conditions were thoroughly investigated. And the reaction can be conducted with 5 mol.% Cat-1 in toluene at 80 °C (20% O2, refluxing/balloon), 2.25 eq. t-BuOK (1 M in t-BuOH) as the base and 3 eq. excess of t-butyl acetate with respect to the alcohol."
11,Substrate extension,"3.3 Substrate extension With these optimized conditions in hand, cobalt catalyzed direct synthesis of α, β-unsaturated esters from t-butyl acetate and various alcohol derivatives via O2-IHB route were conducted (Table 4 ). Substituted benzyl alcohols with several functional groups are applicable as well. When the core of phenyl was replaced by thiophene, pyridine and furan, the yield could also reaches from medium to favorable. Among the heterocycle alcohols, the furan-types possesses relatively high activity and yield. In addition, such O2-IHB system also allows other challenging acetates and propionates with various alcohol derivatives, which also broaden its utility. As shown in Table 5 , the medium yield of all products can be realized in our catalytic system. The substituted methoxy and methylmercapto groups are also tolerant for this reaction system. However, unlike the former t-butyl acetate system, the heavy and complex transesterification equilibrium reactions are the key point for the further enhancement of yield. It seems a challenging problem to handle with although the base of t-BuOK solution (1 M in t-BuOH) has been replaced with t-BuOK. And it is also the main problem that faced with HB pathway for the further application in direct α-alkylation of series esters by alcohols. Excitingly, our O2-IHB strategy is also suitable for the diols to synthesize the α, β-diunsaturated esters (Table 6 ) and six common diols containing aliphatics and aromatics were selected. The 1, 4-benzenedimethanol shows the highest activity and the product yield could reach up to 84.6% after 4 h reaction, with the catalyst loading of 10 mol.%. While the aliphatic diols are not as good as the aromatics, even the product from glycol could not be detected by thin layer chromatography (TCL) method."
12,Reaction mechanism investigation,"3.4 Reaction mechanism investigation After substrate extension for this cobalt catalyzed O2-IHB process, the reaction mechanism was also studied systematically. Due to the well-known and easily available aldol condensation between ester and aldehyde in the presence of t-BuOK, attention was paid to the dehydrogenation step. The effect of 4-substituted group of benzyl alcohol on formation rate of products were firstly explored (Scheme 2 ) and the results were presented in Fig. 1 . According to the results of Fig. 1, it could be confirmed that the electron-donating group would promote the formation rate of product. And the obtained reaction constant (ρ = −0.59) through Hammett equation is proved to excluding the charge accumulation of rate-controlling step. Then the kinetic isotopic effect experiments were conducted to determine the dehydrogenation site and two kinds of deuterated benzyl alcohols were selected as described in Scheme 3 . The results of Fig. 2 show that the production rate of t-butyl cinnamate reduces sharply after these two kinds of hydrogen atom was respectively deuterated. Thus, it could be believed the breakage of both OH and benzyl CH bonds of benzyl alcohol occur during dehydrogenation step, and the latter is rate-controlling. On the basis of above findings, it could be proposed that benzyl alcohol was firstly dehydrogenated in benzaldehyde with the activated cobalt complex, similar phenomenon were also observed in manganese complexes stabilized by PNP pincer ligands [7a,17]. Then the in-situ produced benzaldehyde proceeds aldol reaction with t-butyl acetate to form t-butyl cinnamate in the presence of t-BuOK and the oxygen interrupt the further hydrogenation of CC bonds in t-butyl cinnamate. The activated Cat-1 could be captured by 2, 2′-bipyridine to form complex 1 and the structure was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Supplementary Material). Besides, the intermediate of complex 2 could also be separated and characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Supplementary Material). Then the synthesis reactions under 20% O2 and Ar atmosphere using complex 2 and t-butyl acetate as reactants were conducted as Scheme 4 . The experimental results show that although the starting material of benzyl alcohol is replaced with complex 2, the yield of t-butyl cinnamate and t-butyl phenylpropionate is almost the same. Also, the phenomenon of dehydrogenation of complex 2 into benzaldehyde under 20% O2 and Ar atmosphere was respectively identified with GC–MS (Supplementary Material). As for complex 3, it is very reactive and hard to be obtained. Since complex 3 with high hydrogenation activity was considered to be produced from complex 2, the catalytic hydrogenation of t-butyl cinnamate with complex 2 was conducted as Scheme 5 . From the results of Scheme 5, the yield of t-butyl phenylpropionate is similar to benzaldehyde. So it could be considered that complex 2 would convert into complex 3 and benzaldehyde, followed by the hydrogenation of t-butyl cinnamate with complex 3. While the hydrogenated product could not be observed, with above 99% yield of benzaldehyde, after the replacement of Ar with 20% O2. In other words, the existence of O2 would prevent the hydrogenation of t-butyl cinnamate and promote the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol. Otherwise, the hydrogenation of t-butyl cinnamate with the catalysis of complex 2 could easily proceed under 2 MPa H2. In brief, all above experimental proofs supports the proposal of the dehydrogenation step starting from complex 2 to complex 3. In addition, complex 2 instead of Cat-1 was also used to catalytic synthesis of t-butyl cinnamate and t-butyl phenylpropionate from benzyl alcohol and t-butyl acetate, which was shown in Scheme 6 . And the yield of product is very close to the result that catalyzed by Cat-1. Based on above important discoveries and other supplemental results (Supplementary Material), the proposed mechanism is proved to be reasonable. Through the mechanism analysis, it could be determined that the CC bonds in product can be protected by interrupting the hydrogenation performance of complex 3 with O2. Besides, these activated cobalt complexes can activate 2-fold alcohols simultaneously, leading to the high efficiency of catalytic system."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, the cobalt complex catalyzed synthesis of α, β-unsaturated esters directly from unactivated esters and alcohols via mild O2-interrupted hydrogen borrowing process was developed. Such cobalt complex is self-activating via double deprotonation of PN5P ligand and removal of dichloro ligands under the reaction condition that could accomplish the O2-interrupted hydrogen borrowing pathway. Sequentially, 2-fold alcohols could be dehydrogenized by the activated cobalt complex. The reaction atmosphere and status are crucial to the formation of product. And this catalytic system is characterized by high efficient under mild condition and good tolerance for broad substrate scope and functional group."
