0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels have been used as energy sources and industrial feedstocks in all types of human activities. However, their expected declining supply and the effects of climate change have accelerated the development of alternative carbon-neutral resources [1,2]. Although different means of producing sustainable energy from wind, waves, geothermal heat, and solar energy have been developed, they cannot replace fossil fuels in carbon-based petrochemical industries. Biomass is a potential sustainable energy source and the only current alternative resource for the petroleum-based chemical industry because of its carbon-rich content [3–5]. For the past few decades, bioalcohols produced using an enzymatic fermentation of sugars combined with a thermochemical pretreatment have been widely investigated in the fields of molecular biology, biochemistry, and chemical engineering [6,7]. In these cellulose- and sugar-based processes and in the paper-manufacturing industry, lignin, a byproduct of the lignocellulose-to-bioalcohol and wood-to-paper processes, is considered a waste product. However, its rich carbon content and abundant aromatic monomers can be important resources for the carbon-based chemical industries [3–5,8,9]. Lignin is a natural amorphous polymer that consists of phenylpropane monomers, including p-hydroxylphenylpropane, guaiacylpropane, and syringylpropane, which are covalently bonded to each other [8,10,11]. The depolymerization of lignin via thermochemical processes, such as pyrolysis [12,13], hydrothermal liquefaction [14–16], and catalytic decomposition [17–19], cleaves the ether and CC linkages and leaves more processable fragments. The lignin fragments are then further converted to valuable fuels and chemicals. The catalytic treatment of depolymerized lignin or bio-oils may be an important step to produce valuable hydrocarbon fuels [20]. To upgrade the lignin fragments, the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of several monomeric and dimeric model compounds, such as guaiacol, eugenol, anisole, catechol, and phenol containing α-O-4 or β-O-4 ether linkages, have been studied [21,22]. Heterogeneous catalysts, such as zeolite-supported transition metals [23–26], molybdenum-based catalysts [27], solid acid-supported metals [28,29], and ionic-liquid assisted metals [30], along with homogeneous catalysts [31] were used for the HDO of phenolic compounds. The catalytic reaction network has also been studied [27,29,32,33]. While most HDO processes are accompanied by the catalytic cracking of lignin oligomers to monomers [22], we suggested the catalytic HDO of lignin fragments to a deoxygenated high carbon number dimer without cracking. This process was elucidated using a probable lignin model compound, benzyl phenyl ether containing an α-O-4 linkage, in this study. The reaction route to the high carbon number hydrocarbons suppressing the cleavage of ether linkages may be useful to selectively produce diesel and jet fuels containing high carbon number hydrocarbons. Benzyl phenyl ether was selected as a model reactant for lignin or lignin-derived oligomers because the existence of the α-O-4 linkage in lignin has been reported along with the mainly observed β-O-4 linkage [11]. Additionally, the HDO of phenolic dimers with an α-O-4 linkage has been studied [23,34–36]. In this study, benzyl phenyl ether was first isomerized to alcohols and then further hydrodeoxygenated to saturated deoxygenated hydrocarbons, which produced the higher carbon number hydrocarbons compared to that by the direct hydrodeoxygenation. We demonstrated that this two-step catalytic conversion of benzyl phenyl ether on solid acid and bifunctional catalysts produced high carbon number hydrocarbon fuels without ether cleavage. The catalytic isomerization of benzyl phenyl ether (BPE) to benzylphenols was studied and the active sites for the isomerization on the aerogel catalysts were investigated using solid characterization methods, including temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This study demonstrates that the proposed process will be useful for converting lignin fragments to high carbon number hydrocarbon fuels, including diesel and jet fuels."

3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of the silica-alumina, alumina, and silica aerogels The silica-alumina gel was prepared using the reactants listed in Table 1 . TEOS was added to AlCl3 dissolved in methanol while stirring. The mixture was further stirred for 10min. Dilute aqueous nitric acid solution was then added to the mixture and stirred for 30min. DI water was added to the solution under vigorous stirring and further stirred for 1h. PO was added to the mixture 2 or 3 times in 5-min-intervals. The gelation time to form the wet gel (or alcogel) was determined based on the disappearance of the vortex. The alumina gel was prepared using the reactants listed in Table 1. A mixture of aluminum chloride, ethanol, and aqueous nitric acid was stirred for 30min to produce a homogeneous solution. DI water was added to the solution while stirring. After 90min, PO was added to the mixture. The silica gel was prepared using a method described in the literature (Table 1) [37,38]. After aging for 2–4 days, the alcogel containing alcohol entrapped in the gel network was dried using a supercritical drying process with CO2 in a supercritical extraction system at 70°C and 13MPa. The silica and silica-alumina aerogels were calcined at 600°C for 6h under static air. The alumina aerogel was calcined at 500°C for 4h under flowing air. The prepared aerogel powders were ground and sieved (<75μm). 2.2.2 Preparation of the silica-alumina supported Ru catalyst Ru was impregnated onto commercial silica-alumina (CSA) and SAA-38 using an incipient-wetness method. After drying for 16h at 105°C in an oven, the catalyst was reduced under an H2 flow at 350°C for 2h (2.02wt% Ru/CSA). The prepared catalyst powder was ground and sieved (<75μm)."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The compositions of the prepared catalysts were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; Polyscan-61E, Thermo Electron Corp., Winsford, Cheshire, UK). The silica-alumina aerogels containing Al/(Si+Al)=0.38, 0.57, and 0.73 (mol/mol), based on the ICP-AES results, were denoted as SAA-38, SAA-57, and SAA-73, respectively. The silica aerogel and alumina aerogel were denoted as SA and AA, respectively. N2-physisorption was performed using an ASAP 2010 and ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) to measure the pore volume, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model pore size distribution [39–41]. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was performed using a BELCAT-B temperature programming unit (BELCAT, Osaka, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), as described in the literature [29]. The FT-IR spectra of the catalysts adsorbing pyridine (pyridine-FT-IR) were obtained using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, West Palm Beach, FL, USA) equipped with a MCT-A detector averaging 64 scans over a range of 1400–1700cm−1 with a resolution of 4cm−1. The wavenumber range used in this study was selected to observe the ring vibrations of adsorbed pyridine. A self-pelletized catalyst (0.02g) was installed in an IR cell with a CaF2 window and degassed at 300°C to remove physisorbed moisture on the catalyst through a Schlenk line connecting to the IR cell. Prior to the pyridine adsorption process, the baseline was recorded using the degassed catalyst pellet. The excess vaporized pyridine was adsorbed onto the catalyst surface at room temperature for 30min, and the catalyst pellet was evacuated at 100°C for 90min then cooled to room temperature, at which the FT-IR spectra were obtained. The catalyst pellet was further evacuated at 250°C for 90min then cooled to room temperature at which the FT-IR spectra were obtained again. The Brönsted acid (BA) and Lewis acid (LA) sites were counted using the peaks at 1548cm−1 (BA) and 1446cm−1 (LA), respectively, and their extinction coefficients [42]: BA sites ( mmol/g-catalyst ) = 1.88 × IA BA × R 2 W LA sites ( mmol/g-catalyst ) = 1.42 × IA LA × R 2 W where IABA is the integrated absorbance of the BA band at 1548cm−1, IALA is the integrated absorbance of the LA band at 1446cm−1, R is the radius of the catalyst pellet (0.65cm), and W is the weight of the pellet (mg). Magic-angle spinning (MAS) 27Al NMR spectra were recorded at a frequency of 15MHz on a Varian 400 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 9.4T magnet. The spectra were recorded using a 2μs excitation pulse, a 1s relaxation delay, a 3.2ms acquisition time, and a 4μs contact time with 1000 repetition times. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were obtained at a frequency of 5MHz on a Varian 200 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 4.7T magnet. The spectra were recorded using a 4μs excitation pulse, a 1s relaxation delay, a 50ms acquisition time, and a 4μs contact time with 1000 repetitions."
5,Catalysis,"2.4 Catalysis The catalytic isomerization of benzyl phenyl ether (BPE) was performed in a 160-mL Hastelloy C®-276 batch reactor which was filled with the catalyst (0.1g or 0.01g) and 0.05M BPE solution (40mL) dissolved in n-decane. The reactor was filled with 5bar He, and 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40bar H2 at room temperature. Each isothermal reaction was performed at room temperature, 70, 100, 150, 200, and 250°C for 1h. The reaction was also performed under 5bar He for 100h. When a reaction was complete, the reactor was cooled to room temperature using cooling water. The activity of the catalysts was further studied by adding 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (2,6-DTBP; 0.18, 0.45, 0.89, 2.50, and 26.7μmol) to the reactant BPE solution, which was expected to block the Brönsted acid sites on the catalysts, to confirm the effects of acidity. In addition to isomerization, the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of BPE was performed using three different procedures: (i) a one-step process of directly hydrodeoxygenated BPE at 250°C under 40bar H2 using 2.02wt% Ru/CSA (0.1g), (ii) a two-step process of isomerizing BPE at 100°C under 5bar H2 using SAA-38 (0.1g) followed by HDO using 2.02wt% Ru/CSA (0.1g) at 250°C under 40bar H2, and (iii) a one-step process of BPE HDO at 250°C under 40bar H2 using 2.02wt% Ru/CSA (0.1g) and SAA-38 (0.1g). For all catalytic reactions, the liquid-phase products were analyzed by a GC (Younglin, Acme 6000E), equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), using an HP-5 capillary column (60m×0.25mm×0.25μm). The products were identified with a GC–MS (Agilent Technologies, 7890A, HP-5 capillary column, 60m×0.25mm×0.25μm). The conversion, selectivity, and yield of the reactions and material balance were determined with the yield sum based on the moles of carbon atoms using the following equations: Conversion ( % ) = C 0 − C e C 0 × 100 , Selectivity ( % ) = C i C 0 − C e × M i M 0 × 100 , Yield ( % ) = C i C 0 × M i M 0 × 100 , where C 0 is the initial concentration of BPE before a reaction, C e is the existing concentration of BPE after a reaction, C i is the concentration of an identified product, M 0 is the moles of carbon atoms which BPE contains, and M i is the moles of carbon atoms which the product contains."

7,Conversion of benzyl phenyl ether to benzylphenols on precious-metal-free aerogel catalysts,"3.1 Conversion of benzyl phenyl ether to benzylphenols on precious-metal-free aerogel catalysts In order to avoid ether cleavage during the HDO process, the isomerization of aryl ether to phenols was performed. Benzyl phenyl ether (BPE), the lignin-derived phenolic dimer selected for use in this study, was converted to 2-benzylphenol (2BP), 4-benzylphenol (4BP), phenol, and other minor products on the prepared aerogel catalysts (Fig. 1 ). The two major products of 2BP and 4BP were obtained by the intramolecular rearrangement, and the third product of phenol was obtained via the undesirable outcome of ether cleavage. The formation of toluene, the counterpart of phenol on the ether cleavage, was negligible (below 0.1% yield) in all the observed instances, which may be related to the formation of trimers, including dibenzylphenols. While the formation of dibenzylphenols was observed on SAA-38 and SAA-57, exhibiting compositions of 24 and 13 area%, respectively, based on the GC-FID result [43], the missing toluene may contribute to the formation of dibenzyl phenols because each dibenzyl phenol molecule may form from one benzyl phenol and one toluene, that is, one phenol and two toluenes. The conversion of BPE and the selectivity to 2BP were the highest with SAA-38, but the BPE conversion was very low or negligible with SA, SAA-73, and AA. BPE conversion on SAA-38 reached 93% at 100°C and 100% at 150°C and higher, but selectivity to 2BP decreased from 62% at 100°C to 38% at 250°C. When observing the effects of the H2 or He environments, H2 did not seem to affect the conversion of BPE significantly. We continued using a sufficient H2 environment in this study because of the possible H2-consuming ether bond cleavage, despite the fact that H2 is poorly adsorbed on a solid acid catalyst surface. Unlike previously observed HDO processes on acid-supported precious metal catalysts [29], a significant decrease in the H2 pressure was not observed during the reaction, indicating negligible consumption of H2. The catalyst was allowed to be deactivated by the long-term reaction of BPE on SAA-38 (0.01g in Table 2 compared with 0.1g in Fig. 1) at 100°C and 5bar He. There was no H2 supply so as to ensure a poor H2 environment during the reaction. The BPE conversion increased from 17.9 (after 1h) to 43.5% (after 100h) and the 2BP selectivity increased from 38.4 (after 1h) to 80.6% (after 100h). The selectivities to the two other major products of 4BP and phenol did not significantly change upon a longer reaction time. These observations indicate that (i) deactivation of the solid acid catalysts may not be significant for the conversion of BPE, and (ii) there may be a reaction pathway that predominantly produces 2BP on the solid acid aerogel catalysts. During the 100-h reaction, the molar ratio of (2BP)/(4BP) increased from 9.8 to 17.5 because of the possibly higher stability of 2BP or the possible isomerization of 4BP to 2BP. The higher stability or the preferred formation of 2BP to 4BP was confirmed when the catalysis of an equimolar mixture of 2BP and 4BP was performed on SAA-38 at 100°C for 24h, exhibiting an increased molar ratio of (2BP)/(4BP) from 1 to 1.3. Based on the reaction pathways reported in the literature [35,44–56], we attempted to confirm the routes of BPE to 2BP, 4BP, phenol, and other products using carefully designed control experiments (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The predominant formation of 2BP over 4BP is attributable to the intramolecular rearrangement such as the Claisen rearrangement [57,58], which first fills the ortho-position followed by an allylic group's migration to the para-position via para-Claisen rearrangement without filling the meta-position. Claisen rearrangement has been introduced to explain radical reactions by thermal decomposition at high temperatures (300–500°C) [44–46,52,59], while also being used to explain catalytic isomerization at low temperatures (25–110°C) [43,58,60–62] which is similar to the temperature range used in this study. The preferred formation of 2BP was further studied by observing the product selectivity of (2BP)/(4BP) while changing the reaction temperature, H2 pressure, Al/(Si+Al) ratio, and reaction time (Fig. 1). The ratio of (2BP)/(4BP), or the formation of 2BP, decreased with an increase the reaction temperature from 100 to 250°C. In addition, the (2BP)/(4BP) ratio was nearly constant with different H2 pressures, indicating the negligible dependence of the catalytic activity on the pressure. The effect of Al/(Si+Al) on the selectivity of 2BP over 4BP was not clear because an appreciable conversion of BPE was observed only with SAA-38 and SAA-57. These observations of catalytic activities are further discussed in the following sections using the characterization results of the aerogel catalysts."
8,Characterizations of the catalysts,"3.2 Characterizations of the catalysts 3.2.1 N2-physisorption The nanoscopic structures of the aerogel catalysts were observed using N2-physisorption, which confirmed their mesoporosity, large pore volume, and high surface area, as expected from a review of the literature (Table 3 and Fig. S1) [37,38,40,41,63]. All the aerogel catalysts exhibited monodisperse mesopores (approximately 5–50nm) with high BET surface areas of 244–963m2 g−1. The SAAs exhibited sharper pore size distributions with smaller pore diameters and pore volumes, while SA and AA had broader pore size distributions with larger pore diameters and pore volumes. Although the highly active SAA-38 and SAA-57 exhibited large surface areas of 467–481m2 g−1, the inactive or less active SA, SAA-73, and AA did not exhibit significantly smaller surface areas; thus, this parameter does not explain the stark difference in their catalytic activities. 3.2.2 NH3-TPD Predicting the catalytic activity depending on the acidity on the basis of studies indicating that BPE isomerization occurs on acid catalysts [61,64], the acidity of the catalysts was measured using NH3-TPD (Fig. 2 and Table 4 ). High temperature acid sites (350–850°C, HR), as measured by NH3 desorbed at 350–850°C, are generally important in catalysis [65,66]. SAA-38, the most active catalyst in this study, exhibited the lowest number of total acid sites (TR) or HR, indicating that the catalytic activity did not directly depend on the number of total acid sites. When the low temperature (100–350°C, LR) and high temperature acid sites (350–850°C, HR) were compared, the more catalytic activity was observed with the fewer HR. The amount of LR was not significantly different except for SA which exhibited a negligible amount of LR.. The total number of acid sites measured using NH3 desorbed at 100–850°C (TR) increased with increasing Al/(Si+Al) in the following order: AA>SAA-73>SAA-57>SAA-38>SA. The amount of HR increased with an increase in Al/(Si+Al) except SA in the following order: SAA-38>SAA-57>SAA-73>AA. SAA-38 and SAA-57, containing fewer acid sites, exhibited high BPE conversions. However, SA, SAA-73, and AA, containing more acid sites, exhibited negligible BPE conversions (Figs. 1 and S3). These observations indicate that the number of TR or HR does not determine the catalytic activity, but the increasing ratio of LR to TR or LR to HR more significantly affects the catalytic activity. Identifying TPD peaks remains controversial, although there have been attempts to identify LR and HR in NH-TPD for zeolites [66–70] and amorphous silica-alumina [65,71]; thus, our remark on the importance of LR/TR cannot be easily justified. Instead, the type of acid may play an important role in catalysis process, which requires further investigation of the types of acids as part of the efforts to understand BPE isomerization. 3.2.3 Pyridine-FT-IR Because the numbers of acid sites could not explain the BPE isomerization activity, the types of catalysts were further analyzed using pyridine-FT-IR, which identifies Lewis (LAs) or Brönsted acids (BA) (Table 4, Figs. S2 and S3) [72,73]. The distinct bands of BAs were observed at 1637–1640 and 1548cm−1 in all catalysts except for SA. The peaks at 1446 and 1594–1598cm−1 appeared to represent the interaction via hydrogen bonds, which virtually disappeared when evacuated at 250°C. The distinct bands of LAs were identified at 1622–1623, 1614–1616, 1578, and 1450–1454cm−1 in all the catalysts. The absorption at 1492cm−1 was observed in all catalysts except SA, which represents a mixture of hydrogen bond, BA, and LA. SA did not exhibit absorption bands at 1548 (BA) and 1492cm−1 (BA and LA), indicating that SA did not contain BA. The ratio of BA/LA was calculated using the absorption bands at 1548 (BA) and 1450cm−1 (LA) [42] observing that the BA/LA ration was larger on the more active SAA-38 and SAA-57 but smaller on the inactive SAA-73, AA, and SA. These observations indicate that the BPE isomerization activity was improved by BA, but that it was possibly inhibited by LA. 3.2.4 27Al- and 29Si-NMR The acidity of the catalyst surface, as previously discussed after analyzing the NH3-TPD and pyridine-FT-IR results,, was further examined in observations of the solid structures by magic-angle spinning (MAS) 29Si-and 27Al-NMR. The 29Si NMR results exhibited strong chemical shift peaks at −108.7ppm (Q4), −101.1ppm (Q3) and −91.1 (Q2) for SA [74]. However, broad peaks for the SAAs were attributed to Si surrounded by Al atoms, in this case Q4(1Al) (−98.8ppm) for SAA-38, Q4(2Al) (−93.8ppm) for SAA-57, and Q4(3Al) (−87.9ppm) in SAA-73 (Fig. 4 (a)) [74]. Q n represents the tetrahedral symmetry of SiO2 with n denoting the number of SiOSi connections in SA, and mAl represents the number (m) of Al species bound to the Q n unit. The 27Al NMR results exhibited two distinct peaks at 44ppm (tetrahedral symmetry, Al(IV)) and close to −4.8ppm (octahedral symmetry, Al(VI)) (Fig. 3(b)) [74]. The ratio of the peak areas, (Al(IV))/(Al(VI)), decreased with an increase in the Si content, yielding values of 0.12 (AA), 0.43 (SAA-73), 0.59 (SAA-57), and 1.03 (SAA-38) and exhibiting the possible formation of tetrahedral Al symmetry by Si substitution. Based on the observation that Al(IV) is responsible for the formation of strong Brönsted acid sites [75–82], the increasing ratio of Al(IV)/Al(VI) with an increase in Al/(Si+Al) indicates that more Brönsted acid sites form on SAA-38 and SAA-57 resulting in high catalytic activity, which corresponds to the observations by pyridine-FT-IR."
9,"Conversion of benzyl phenyl ether mixed with acid-inhibiting 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine","3.3 Conversion of benzyl phenyl ether mixed with acid-inhibiting 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine The BPE conversion on the Brönsted acid sites was confirmed by control experiments using a catalyst whose Brönsted acid sites were selectively blocked by the sterically hindered organic base of 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (2,6-DTBP) (Table 5 and Fig. S4) [83,84]. When 2,6-DTBP was introduced into the reaction system, the BPE conversion decreased drastically despite the fact that only a 2/1000 equivalent of 2,6-DTBP (0.18μmol) of total acid sites (92.8μmol on 0.1g based on the NH3-TPD result) was added. Good linearity between the BPE conversion and the 2,6-DTBP concentration was observed when amounts of 0.18, 0.45, and 0.89μmol of 2,6-DTBP were added to each reactant (Fig. S4). These results demonstrate that BPE conversion must occur on the Brönsted acid sites."
10,Isomerization of benzyl phenyl ether on the precious-metal-free aerogel catalysts,"3.4 Isomerization of benzyl phenyl ether on the precious-metal-free aerogel catalysts The investigation of the BPE conversion results at 100–250°C and the active sites for the isomerization process suggest a possible reaction pathway, as summarized in Fig. 4 . The cracking of BPE during high temperature pyrolysis at 275–450°C was suggested to occur with homolytic scission consisting of bond fission, hydrogen abstraction, and β-scission followed by radical termination steps [14,44,47,52–54], but the low temperature reaction (<250°C) observed in this study may occur not via radical reactions but by different pathways. Instead of the phenoxy and benzyl radical intermediates suggested to occur during the pyrolysis of BPE [44,46,52,59,85], the carbocation intermediates on the acid catalysts can be included in the low temperature catalytic reaction pathway [58,60,86]. The Brönsted acid sites attracted ethers leading to a catalytic rearrangement to produce 2BP and 4BP possibly by Claisen rearrangement [87], which can be catalytically initiated at a temperature as low as room temperature [58,60]. The formation of 2BP was a primary reaction over that of 4BP regardless of the BPE conversion as reported in the literature (Fig. S5) [43,61,64]. Among the products, an appreciable amount of phenol was also obtained by the ether cleavage of BPE, but the formation of toluene was negligible as reported when acid catalysts were used [45]. Although the formation of toluene and phenol has been reported with sufficient hydrogen sources [44,88], 2BP and 4BP selectively formed under the H2-deficient environment caused by the poor H2-adsorbing SAA catalysts adopted in this study [61,64,89]. A GC/MS analysis of the product mixture indicated that trimers and dimers, including benzyltoluene, dibenzylphenol, and diphenylethane, were obtained by the combination of two toluenes (for the dimers including benzyltoluene and diphenylethane), and one phenol and two toluenes (for the trimers including dibenzylphenol), respectively. These observations indicate that the adsorbed toluene obtained by the ether cleavage of BPE may be quickly added to adjacent intermediates to form dimers and trimers as described in Fig. 4 [43]. The addition of cleaved fragments, particularly toluene, to the other fragments may be accelerated with the increasing reaction temperature, which suppressed the formation of 2BP and improved the formation of the trimer."
11,Two-step hydrodeoxygenation of benzyl phenyl ether using a bifunctional catalyst containing precious metal nanoparticles and solid acids,"3.5 Two-step hydrodeoxygenation of benzyl phenyl ether using a bifunctional catalyst containing precious metal nanoparticles and solid acids Based on the conversion of BPE to the phenolic dimers of 2BP and 4BP rather than the monomers of phenol and toluene on the solid acid aerogel catalysts, we designed a two-step reaction, or indirect HDO (IHDO), consisting of the isomerization of BPE to BPs on a silica-alumina catalyst and then the HDO of BPs on a supported noble metal catalyst (Fig. 5 ), which produces high carbon number dicyclohexyl hydrocarbons rather than monocyclohexyl compounds (Process II in Table 6 ). The first step of the IHDO of BPE was performed using SAA-38 at 100°C and 5bar H2, producing a mixture of 2BP, 4BP, and phenol with 100% BPE conversion (Fig. 1). The second step of the IHDO process using the entire products of the first step was performed using 2.02wt% Ru/CSA at 250°C and 40bar H2, which finally produced predominant dicyclohexylmethane (C13 compound, 52.4% selectivity), cyclohexane (13.4% selectivity), methylcyclohexane (1.5% selectivity), and trimers (unidentified C19 compounds). In contrast to the IHDO, a one-step reaction, or direct HDO (DHDO), was performed using 2.02wt% Ru/CSA at 250°C and 40bar H2, which produced a large number of the C6-7 compounds (96.3% selectivity) of hydrogenated phenolic monomers [29] and a small number of the C13 compound of dicyclohexylmethane (1.3%) (Process I in Table 6). The stark difference between the one-step DHDO and the two-step IHDO processes can be attributed to the isomerization of BPE to BPs in IHDO, as performed on the noble-metal-free solid acid catalysts. To clarify the usefulness of IHDO, we also performed DHDO using a 1:1 (w/w) physical mixture of 2.02wt% Ru/CSA and SAA-38 at 250°C and 40bar H2 (process III in Table 6), which produced a tiny amount of dicyclohexylmehtane (1.7% selectivity) and a large amount of hydrogenated phenolic monomers or their derivatives including cyclohexane (42.3% selectivity), methylcyclohexane (37.4% selectivity), cycloheptane (8.7% selectivity), and methylcyclopentane (0.4% selectivity). These observations indicate that the two-step IHDO process selectively produces cyclic hydrocarbons with a higher carbon number compared to the one-step DHDO process, which produces the hydrocarbons with a smaller carbon number. In addition, five major compounds account for 90.5 and 97.6% of the products from the DHDO process but only 67.3% of the products from the IHDO process, as described in Table 6. The other products are mostly compounds with a higher carbon numbers, including hydrogenated phenolic trimers, thus indicating that the IHDO process (process II in Table 6) leads to the preferred production of high carbon number hydrocarbons. The formation of these hydrocarbons with a higher carbon number will be useful to those seeking to produce high-energy diesel fuels from lignin or lignin-derived fragments."
12,Conclusions,"The conversion of BPE on acid catalysts of silica-alumina aerogels was observed to study the conversion of lignin or lignin-derivatives. BPE was converted to 4BP and 2BP by intramolecular rearrangement and phenol by the cleavage of ether bonds. The predominant formation of 2BP was attributed to Claisen-rearrangement. The characterizations including NH3-TPD, NMR, and FT-IR, as well as a carefully designed control experiment indicated that catalytic activity was improved by the Brönsted acid sites. Based on the observed non-cracking isomerization of BPE, a two-step HDO was designed to produce high carbon number hydrocarbons. Deoxygenated C13–19 hydrocarbons rather than cracked C6–7 hydrocarbons were successfully obtained. According to these results, the two-step HDO process may be an efficient process to produce high carbon number hydrocarbons as possible alternative sources for diesel and jet fuel."
