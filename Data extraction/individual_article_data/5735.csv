0,Introduction,"With the rapid increase in petroleum prices and concerns about environmental pollution, biodiesel has attracted extensive attention as an alternative fuel for petroleum diesel. Alternative fuels have the potential to solve the depletion problem of petroleum sources and concerns from air pollution and global warming to other environmental and sustainability issues (Demirbas, 2005). Many researchers have studied biodiesel as a renewable energy resource (Campanelli et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2008; Demirbas, 2009a). Biodiesel, an alternative liquid fuel, is produced by transesterification reactions from various biological sources such as vegetable oil and animal fats (Alptekin and Canakci, 2011; Shin et al., 2012). Biodiesel has properties similar to those of diesel oil (Encinar et al., 2005), and it can be used directly in diesel engines without modifications or after blending with petroleum products to achieve similar performance (Usta, 2005; Demirbaş, 2003). Further, biodiesel emits less CO, SOx, and unburned hydrocarbons (Peng et al., 2008; Demirbas, 2009a). Transesterification is the chemical reaction between triglycerides and alcohol to produce monoesters. During transesterification, the long chains of triglycerides are converted to monoesters and glycerol (Van Gerpen, 2005; Song et al., 2008; Warabi et al., 2004; Köckritz and Martin, 2008). Generally, there are two common methods for transesterification of biological source to biodiesel. One is the method using a catalyst termed as catalyzed transesterification method and the other is without the use of catalyst, which is termed the supercritical fluid method. Most of the practices for biofuel production have concentrated on vegetable oils such as corn, jatropha, cottonseed, crambe, linseed, peanut, rapeseed, safflower, sesame, soya bean, sunflower, palm, and babassu (Murugesan et al., 2009) as raw materials. However, the growing use of edible food crops and cash crops over the last few years have brought about new concerns related to the economic and environmental implications (Alexander and Hurt, 2007). Commercially, the use of expensive refined vegetable oils as a feedstock is not economically viable because nearly 70% of the cost is attributed to the raw materials (Phan and Phan, 2008; Meng et al., 2008). Some key areas for focus that can address solutions to mitigate those implications can be research based on byproducts like waste vegetable oils, animal fats and some woody biomass. Therefore, much effort has been recently devoted to production of biodiesel from feedstock such as rubber seed oil (Ramadhas et al., 2005), woody biomass (Poudel and Oh, 2012), chicken fat (Marulanda et al., 2010), waste vegetable oil (Zhang et al., 2003) and waste pig fat (Shin et al., 2012). In Korea, pork is one of the major food from which excessive amount of waste pig fat is generated. And the transesterification for biodiesel production via supercritical alcohols has been suggested to overcome the drawbacks related to the homogeneous catalytic process (Saka and Kusdiana, 2001; Demirbas, 2009b; Yin et al., 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this work is to study the kinetic analysis method based on the non-isothermal technique for the transesterification reaction of waste pig fat in supercritical alcohols. There is no intention in this work to describe the fundamental chemical mechanisms of the transesterification reaction of waste pig fat in supercritical alcohols. This work is focused on the measurement of apparent kinetic parameters useful for the engineering design of chemical processes."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and apparatus,"2.1 Materials and apparatus The chemical composition for the waste pig fat sample was referred from literature. The FA composition of waste pig fat is shown in Table 1 (Rohman et al., 2012; Indrasti et al., 2010). As solvents, methanol of 99.5% purity manufactured by Ducksan Chemical Co. (Gyeongju, Korea), and ethanol of 99.9% purity produced by OCI Company Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) were used. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of batch-type reactor manufactured by Parr Instrument Co. (Moline, IL, USA) with volume of 25mL. The permissible reactor conditions are 500°C and 55MPa. The temperature of the reactant was measured by a K-type thermocouple, whereas the pressure inside the vessel was monitored by a digital pressure gauge."
3,Procedure,"2.2 Procedure The waste pig fat sample was stored in vacuum for more than 24h before the experiment ensuring minimum moisture capture during the pre-setup works. The experiments were carried out with waste pig fat to alcohol weight ratios of 1:1.5 (molar ratio: 1:40.5 for methanol and 1:28 for ethanol), 1:2.0 (molar ratio: 1:54 for methanol and 1:37.5 for ethanol) and 1:2.5 (molar ratio: 1:67.5 for methanol and 1:47 for ethanol) at temperatures between 220°C and 290°C with intervals of 10°C. At room temperature, the waste pig fat with alcohol at definite weight ratio was charged into the autoclave reactor. The reaction pressure was controlled by varying the volume of alcohol and waste pig fat fed into the reactor. The total amount of waste pig fat and alcohol charged into the reactor was determined to ensure achieving of supercritical pressure. During the reaction, a magnetic stirrer was used for rigorous stirring at a rate of 500rpm so as to homogeneously mix the waste pig fat and alcohol solution. It was difficult to maintain a constant heating rate. In order to solve this problem, in this experiment, the set point of the temperature controller was set to a higher temperature than the required experimental temperature. The time required to reach the set point depends on heating rates. For SCM, the heating rates of 6.7, 6.3 and 5.8°C/min were used for the waste pig fat to methanol weight ratio of 1:1.5, 1:2.0 and 1:2.5, respectively, whereas the heating rates of 7.4, 7.2 and 12°C/min was used for waste pig fat to ethanol weight ratios of 1:1.5, 1:2.0 and 1:2.5, respectively. When the reaction temperature got to the required experimental condition, the heating of the vessel was immediately stopped and the vessel was cooled in an ice bath to stop the reaction instantly. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) (GC: DB-WAX (30m×250μm, 0.25μm thickness), Agilent GC-6890, and MS: MSD-5975 detector, California, CA, USA). The area percentage method was used to estimate the amount of alkyl esters in the product."
4,Results and discussion,
5,"Effect of temperature, weight ratio and alcohols on conversion","3.1 Effect of temperature, weight ratio and alcohols on conversion The conversion of waste pig fat to alkyl esters carried out in supercritical methanol (SCM) and supercritical ethanol (SCE) is shown in Fig. 2 . The critical temperatures and pressures of ethanol and methanol are Tc=243.0°C, 239.4°C and Pc=6.4MPa, 8.1MPa, respectively. Therefore, for some experiments of less than 240°C, the transesterification reactions of waste pig fat with alcohols took place in near critical fluids. The product yield of biodiesel in supercritical fluids is affected by reaction pressure (Goembira and Saka, 2013). However, it was impossible to perform kinetic experiments at constant pressure with the non-isothermal technique because the vapor pressure of alcohol increases with the reaction temperature; therefore, the effect of reaction pressure was not considered in this work. The effect of reaction temperature on the transesterification of waste pig fat in supercritical alcohols was studied by varying the temperature from 220 to 290°C. From Fig. 2, it can be inferred that the conversion trends in SCM and SCE are similar, and the conversion increased with temperature. Also, maximum conversions were almost 99% for both SCM and SCE which was achieved at temperature around 290°C. Liquid alcohol is a polar solvent and has hydrogen bonding between OH oxygen and OH hydrogen to form alcohol clusters. Because the degree of hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, the polarity of alcohol would decrease in supercritical state. This means that supercritical alcohol has a hydrophobic nature with the lower dielectric constant. As a result, non-polar triglycerides can be well solvated with supercritical alcohol to form a single phase (Kusdiana and Saka, 2001) of waste pig fat/alcohol mixture. This phenomenon with the high temperature conditions seems to be likely to promote transesterification reaction of waste pig fat. In addition, it was shown that the conversion was not affected significantly with the weight ratio of waste pig fat and alcohol although the conversion at 1:1.5 weight ratio for SCE is lower than the other weight ratios. This is due to the excess alcohol in comparison to the molar fraction of waste pig fat."
6,Kinetic analysis,"3.2 Kinetic analysis Kusdiana and Saka proposed the one step model for transesterification reaction in SCM as follows (Kusdiana and Saka, 2001): (1) TG + 3 MeOH → GL + 3 ME where TG, MeOH, GL and ME are triglycerides, methanol, glycerol and methyl ester, respectively. In this work, ethanol and methanol are used as solvents in supercritical fluid reaction. Therefore, the reaction model of Eq. (1) can be given as (2) TG + 3 AL → GL + 3 AE where AL and AE denote alcohol and alkyl ester. The reaction rate of Eq. (2) can be given by Eq. (3). (3) Rate = − d ( TG ) d t where TG refers to the content of waste pig fat used in this work. In this supercritical alcohol method, three species were defined as alkyl esters, glycerol and unused waste pig fat (U PF) which include triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides and unreacted free fatty acids. Therefore, Eq. (3) can be modified as (Kusdiana and Saka, 2001): (4) Rate = − d ( U PF ) d t In general, the overall rate equation of reaction is expressed in the Arrhenius form as: (5) − d ( U PF ) d t = A exp − E R T ( U PF ) n ( AL ) m where A, E, T and R are the pre-exponential factor (1/min), the apparent activation energy (J/mol), the temperature of reaction (K) and the gas constant (8.314J/molK), respectively. Also n and m denote the overall reaction order for waste pig fat and alcohol. However, the reaction order for alcohol, m used in this work is taken as zero because of the excess alcohol in comparison to the molar fraction of the waste pig fat. Hence Eq. (5) changes to (6) − d ( U PF ) d t = A exp − E R T ( U PF ) n If the basic Eq. (6) is taken and a heating rate β = dT/dt (K/min) is employed, it can be shown that (7) − d ( U PF ) ( U PF ) n = A β exp − E R T d T Where on integrating and introducing the initial condition of U PF =1 at T = T 0, the following expression is obtained as (8) ∫ 1 U PF − d ( U PF ) ( U PF ) n = A β ∫ T 0 T exp − E R T d T The integral approximation (Coats and Redfern, 1964) is to consider Eq. (8) where it can be shown that (9) A β ∫ T 0 T exp − E R T = A R T 2 β E 1 − 2 R T E exp − E R T and (10) ∫ 1 U P F − d ( U PF ) ( U PF ) n = 1 − U PF 1 − n 1 − n for n ≠ 1 (11) = − ln ( U PF ) for n = 1 Therefore, the following equations can be obtained: (12) 1 − U PF 1 − n 1 − n = A R T 2 β E 1 − 2 R T E exp − E R T for n ≠ 1 (13) − ln ( U PF ) = A R T 2 β E 1 − 2 R T E exp − E R T for n ≠ 1 From logarithm of Eqs. (12) and (13), the following equations are derived, respectively. (14) ln 1 − U PF 1 − n T 2 ( 1 − n ) = F − E R T for n ≠ 1 (15) ln − ln ( U PF ) T 2 = F − E R T for n = 1 (16) where, F = ln A R β E 1 − 2 R T E The plot of ln [ 1 − U PF 1 − n / T 2 ( 1 − n ) ] or ln [ − ln ( U PF ) / T 2 ] versus 1 / T should give a straight line with the slope determining the activation energy E. The value of F can be obtained from intercept of plot of Eqs. (14) and (15) whereas A can be calculated from activation energy E, heating rate β and the intercept F from Eq. (16). Figs. 3 and 4 show the application of the kinetic analysis method proposed in this work for SCM and SCE, respectively. The best fit values were determined employing the overall reaction order values n from −2.0 to 2.0 at intervals of 0.25. The kinetic parameters obtained in this study are summarized in Table 2 . The reaction order for SCM was obtained as 0.75, 0.50 and 0.75 for waste pig fat to methanol weight ratios of 1:1.5, 1:2.0 and 1:2.5, respectively while the reaction order for SCE was obtained as −0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 for waste pig fat to ethanol weight ratios of 1:1.5, 1:2.0 and 1:2.5, respectively. And the kinetic analysis method proposed in this work gave the activation energies of 67.6–94.0kJ/mol and 46.9–57.2kJ/mol for SCM and SCE, respectively. From this work, it was found that the apparent activation energy and the overall reaction order for SCE were lower than the value for SCM. It is well known that the kinetic investigation is very important to get information for rationally designing the reactor. There is no intention in this study to describe the fundamental chemical mechanisms for the transesterification of waste pig fat. This study focuses on the measurement of apparent activation energy useful for the engineering design of chemical processes. The negative value of the reaction order at waste pig fat to ethanol ratios of 1:1.5 for SCE was obtained due to its mathematical complexity and the relation between parameters in equation. To verify the effectiveness of the kinetic analysis method proposed in this work, Fig. 5 shows the experimental values and the calculated values from Eqs. (11) and (12) by using the kinetic parameters of Table 2. From this Figure, it was seen that the calculated values agreed well with the experimental values, and the kinetic analysis method used in this work gave reliable values of the kinetic parameters for the transesterification reactions of waste pig fat in supercritical alcohols."
7,Conclusion,"The kinetic analysis for the transesterification reaction of waste pig fat was studied in supercritical alcohols. From this study, it was found that the conversion trends in SCE and SCM were similar, and the conversion increased with temperature. However, the conversions in SCM were higher than those of SCE for each temperature. The kinetic analysis method proposed in this work gave the apparent activation energies of 67.6–94.0kJ/mol and 46.9–57.2kJ/mol for SCM and SCE, respectively. It was also found that the apparent activation energy for SCE was lower than that for SCM. Also in this work, to verify the effectiveness of the kinetic analysis method proposed, we compared the experimental values with the values we calculated by using kinetic parameters obtained in this work. From the comparison of the experimental and calculated values, the kinetic analysis method proposed in this work gave reliable values of the kinetic parameters for the transesterification reactions of waste pig fat in supercritical alcohols."
