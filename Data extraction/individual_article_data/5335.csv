0,Introduction,"Carbon materials, prepared from inexpensive and abundant biomass/derivates, are attracting vast interest because of their tunable physiochemical properties along with the possibility of doping and functionalization, and they are the promising candidates for applications in catalysis [1–3], energy storage and production [4,5] and separation [6]. Among versatile carbon materials, hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) with 3D interconnected macro-, meso- and micropores have drawn particular attention [7–9]. In heterogeneous catalysis, carbon frameworks of HPCs with hierarchical porosity offer minimized diffusion resistance and shortened diffusion pathway to mass transport by macropores, while their high surface areas ensure to highly disperse active sites throughout the micro and/or mesopores. The unique structural features strongly suggest HPCs as the promising and sustainable catalyst supports. Biomass/derivate-derived HPCs are commonly prepared by incomplete carbonization of carbon precursors (e.g. chitosan, cellulose and carbohydrates) at elevated temperature in the presence of soft (e.g. block-copolymers [10]) and/or hard template (e.g. CaCO3 [11,12] or ZnO nanoparticles [13]) or combined template and activation reagent [14]. The template is applied to create macropores of HPCs, while the activation reagent such as KOH [15], KHCO3 [16], K2C2O4 [17] and (NH4)2C2O4 [18] can introduce meso/micropores in macropore wall, adjust meso/micropore proportion and increase the surface area of HPCs. In the present work, we devote to develop novel supported Brønsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs) as efficient and recoverable solid acid catalysts for upgrading raw pyrolysis biofuel via esterification of acetic acid with high boiling point benzyl alcohol (205 °C) or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (259 °C) in a toluene media. BAILs with strong Brønsted acidity are more preferred over mineral acids in catalytic conversion of biomass to new generation biofuels and biorenewable platform chemicals, and the processes are significant to reduce fossil fuel energy consumption and noxious gas emission [19–22]. However, the separation of BAILs from the reaction media is a challenge because they exhibit high miscibility with organic solvents, and chemical immobilization of BAILs is therefore the foremost strategy to solve the separation and recovery problems. Owing to fascinating morphological and textural properties, hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbons (NHPCs) are selected as the supports for the immobilization of BAILs. The NHPCs are prepared by a single step CaCO3 nanoparticle-directed nanocasting approach combined with K2C2O4 chemical activation during carbonization of glucose and urea/melamine. Functionalization of the NHPCs via quaternary ammonization by 1,3-propanesultone followed by anion exchange with HSO3CF3 results in the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] and GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] (C3 = PrSO3H); moreover, by changing initial urea-to-glucose weight ratio in the preparation systems, nitrogen element contents and thereby Brønsted acid site densities, BET surface areas and meso/micropore proportions of the NHPCs can be well-adjusted, which may obviously influence the catalytic activity of the resulting GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]. Pyrolysis biofuels are produced from fast pyrolysis of waste biomass, and they are promising candidates to replace petroleum fuels [23–25]. However, raw pyrolysis biofuels are a mixture of acids, alcohols, furans, aldehydes, esters, ketones, sugars and multifunctional compounds [26,27], which lead to them unfavorable properties including low heating value, immiscibility with petroleum fuels, thermal and chemical instability as well as corrosiveness because of their high oxygen content (20–50 wt.%) and high acidity (pH = 2.5–3) [28–31]. Accordingly, the direct use of fast pyrolysis biofuels is limited, and they need to be upgraded, e.g., catalytic hydrotreating, to reduce oxygen content and therefore to satisfy the requirements of boiler fuels or the additive for the petroleum fuels. Prior to the catalytic hydrotreating, it is crucial to reduce acidity and oxygen content to a large extent, which can increase the stability and decrease hydrogen consumption in subsequent upgrading steps. As one of the small oxygenates, acetic acid is abundant in raw pyrolysis biofuels (ca. 1–10 wt.%) [31], and removal of acetic acid can remarkably decrease the acidity and improve the stability of fast pyrolysis biofuels. Ketonization and esterification of acetic acid are two promising catalytic processes for raw pyrolysis biofuel pretreatment; moreover, esterification affords a simpler and more effective process. Acid-catalytic esterification of acetic acid with methanol or ethanol is a common strategy to reduce the acidity and viscosity of raw pyrolysis biofuels [32,33]. However, oxygen content of raw pyrolysis biofuels is unchanged. Both the yielded water and ester is expected to be eliminated continuously if a continuous process is to operate via reactive distillation, as a consequence, oxygen content is decreased, together with high yield of the ester because of the complete esterification equilibria. For this purpose, alcohols with boiling points higher than water are chosen to avoid alcohol loss during distillation. PrSO3H/SBA-15-, resin- or zeolite-catalyzed esterifications of acetic acid with high boiling point alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol or anisyl alcohol have been studied [31,34–36]. Here the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] are successfully applied in catalytic esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol to produce benzyl acetate or 4-methoxybenzyl acetate in a simulated pyrolysis biofuel environment by using toluene as the representative of non-polar lignin derivative, and the yielded benzyl acetate or 4-methoxybenzyl acetate are value-added chemicals [37–39]. It shows that esterification activity of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] outperforms Amberlyst-15 resin and HY zeolite. The excellent esterification activity of the prepared catalysts is explained in terms of super strong Brønsted acidity and unique hierarchically porous structure; additionally, macro/meso/micropore proportion of the catalysts affects the esterification activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of BAIL functionalized NHPCs,"2.1 Preparation of BAIL functionalized NHPCs Firstly, NHPCs with different nitrogen contents were prepared by using glucose anhydrous and urea as carbon and nitrogen precursors, respectively, and the process followed by modified literature method [11]. Typically, glucose (8.9, 6.7 and 3.4 g, respectively) and urea (1.1, 3.3 and 6.6 g, respectively) were thoroughly ground into powder with K2C2O4 and then with CaCO3 nanoparticles (particle size of 50–70 nm, Fig. S1a, purchased from Zhejiang Tianshi Nano Technology Co. LTD, China) at a weight ratio of (glucose + urea)-to-K2C2O4-to-CaCO3 of 1:1:1. The mixture was firstly heated to 250 °C at a ramp of 5 °C min−1 and held for 10 min. Afterwards, the mixture was continuously heated to 750 °C at the same ramp heating rate and held for 1 h. Finally, the furnace was cooled down to 200 °C in 2 h. The above process was carried out under flowing nitrogen gas. After cooling to room temperature, the black product was washed with diluted HCl for several times to remove inorganic impurities such as calcium oxide nanoparticles and potassium compounds generated during the calcination process, and then it was further washed with water until the filtrate was neutral in acidity. NHPCs were finally obtained after air-drying at 100 °C for 12 h, and it was denoted as GU‒x (G and U represent glucose and urea, respectively). Here, x = 1, 2 and 3, respectively, representing GU with different nitrogen element contents (Table S1 of supplementary information). Additionally, the other NHPC support (denoted as GM‒2) was also prepared following the above process and using melamine as a nitrogen precursor, and the weight ratio of (glucose + melamine)-to-K2C2O4-to-CaCO3 was 1:1:1 (in which weight ratio of glucose-to-melamine was 2:1). The absence of residual potassium and calcium in as-prepared various GU/GM supports were confirmed by a Leeman Prodigy Spec (I) ICP-AES determination after the samples were calcined in flowing air gas at 600 °C followed by dissolving with dilute HNO3. Functionalization of GU/GM supports with BAILs was carried out by the following process. Typically, GU/GM support (0.6 g) was dispersed in 10 mL toluene solution containing 1,3-propane sultone (0.15 g or 1.26 mmol), and the mixture was continuously stirred at toluene refluxing temperature (110 °C) for 12 h. Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and HSO3CF3 (0.1 mL or 1.13 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 12 h, and then it was rested at room temperature for another 12 h. The solid was obtained by centrifugation, and then it was washed with abundant dichloromethane at room temperature until the adsorbed BAILs were removed completely. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and it was denoted as GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒x or GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 (C3 = PrSO3H; x = 1, 2 and 3)."
3,Characterization of BAIL-functionalized NHPCs,"2.2 Characterization of BAIL-functionalized NHPCs Nitrogen (N, %) and sulfur (S, %) element contents in as-prepared catalysts were determined by a EuroVector CHNS EA3000 elemental analyzer. FESEM observations were performed on a XL-30 ESEMFEG field emission scanning electron microscope. Nitrogen gas adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 PLUS HD88 surface area and porosity analyzer, and the samples were outgassed under vacuum at 363 K for 1 h and 373 K for another 12 h before the measurement. BET surface area (S BET) was calculated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation, pore diameter (D p) was estimated from BJH desorption determination, and pore volume (V p) was estimated from the pore volume determination using the adsorption branch of the N2 isotherm curve at P/P 0 = 0.99 single point. Mercury porosimetry measurement was performed on a Micromeritics Autopore V mercury porosimeter. Raman scattering spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon HR 800 instrument with an Ar+ laser source at 488 nm in a macroscopic configuration. XPS was performed on an Axis Ultra DLD instrument with a monochromated Al-Kα source at a residual gas pressure of below 10−8 Pa. The Brønsted acid strength of the catalysts was measured by a WDDY-2008 J microcomputer automatic potentiometric titration instrument [40]. The sample (50 mg) was suspended in acetonitrile under stirring for 24 h, and then the suspension was titrated with 0.1 mol L−1 n-butylamine/acetonitrile solution. The Brønsted acid site density (A, μeq(H+) g−1) of the catalysts was determined by acid-base titration [41]. Typically, fresh catalyst powder (50 mg) was dispersed in a NaCl solution (2 mol L−1, 10 mL) under stirring at 30 °C for 24 h, and then the suspension was titrated with standard NaOH solution (9.5 mmol L−1). The Brønsted acid site density was then calculated from the consumed NaOH."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests Typically, 24 mg of catalyst was added to a mixture of benzyl alcohol/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (3.33 mmol), acetic acid (10 mmol) and toluene (10 mL), and the reaction was carried out at 100 or 50 °C. The concentrations of the produced benzyl acetate/4-methoxybenzyl acetate and residual benzyl alcohol/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol were analyzed periodically by a Shimadzu 2014C GC-FID fitted with a HP-INNOWAX capillary column, and ethyl laurate was used as an internal standard. The catalytic performance of the tested catalysts was evaluated quantitatively by the conversion of benzyl alcohol/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, the yield of benzyl acetate/4-methoxybenzyl acetate and the selectivity to benzyl acetate/4-methoxybenzyl acetate, respectively. Additionally, the esterification processes were also monitored by a HP6890GC-5973MSD GC–MS."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization 3.1.1 Catalyst preparation As illustrated in Scheme 1 , the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts are prepared by following two steps. At first, NHPC supports are derived from calcination of glucose and urea/melamine at 750 °C under N2 atmosphere in the presence of CaCO3 nanoparticles as a hard template and K2C2O4 as an activating agent. After removing all yielded inorganic components by dilute HCl and then water washing, NHPCs are created. Purpose of introduction of nitrogen atoms in NHPC supports is subsequent quaternary ammonization with 1,3-propanesultone, which gives rise to GU/GM‒[C3 −N+]. After anion exchange of C3 − from GU/GM‒[C3 −N+] with SO3CF3 − from HSO3CF3, GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] is finally formed. In order to adjust nitrogen element contents in the NHPCs and thereby BET surface areas and micro/mesopore proportions of the NHPCs as well as Brønsted acid site densities of the resulting GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3], three NHPC supports with urea-to-glucose weight ratio of 0.12 (GU‒1), 0.49 (GU‒2) and 1.94 (GU‒3) are prepared at a weight ratio of (glucose + urea)-to-K2C2O4-to-CaCO3 of 1:1:1. After functionalization of these NHPC supports by the same amount of 1,3-propanesultone and HSO3CF3, the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1, GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2, and GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3 are prepared with nitrogen element contents of 5.2, 6.8 and 8.0%, respectively (Table 1 ). In the case of the GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2, its nitrogen content is 5.6% (Table 1). Here, the adding amount of 1,3-propanesultone and HSO3CF3 is excessive with respect to nitrogen element contents in the NHPCs so that various NHPC supports with different nitrogen element contents can be functionalized by BAILs completely. 3.1.2 Morphological characteristics Morphological characteristics of four NHPC supports and the corresponding GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts are revealed by both FESEM (Fig. 1 ) and TEM (Fig. 2 ) observations. From the images shown in Fig. 1a-c it is found that three GU supports exhibit similar 3D interconnected hierarchically porous networks that are full of open and plentiful macropores ranging from tens nanometers to several micrometers, and slightly denser structure and decreased interconnected cavity are observed as increasing urea-to-glucose weight ratio. As for GM support, it exhibits similar morphology with that of GU (Fig. 1d). However, owing to the resolution limitation of the FESEM, meso- and micropores in the samples are hardly observed. After functionalization with BAILs, microstructures of the resulting GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts remain intact basically (Fig. 1a’-d’). To explore the influence of CaCO3 nanoparticles and K2C2O4 on the morphology and porosity properties of the NHPCs, FESEM images of the GU C a C O 3 ‒1 (Fig. 1e) and GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒1 (Fig. 1f) that are prepared by carbonization of glucose (8.9 g) and urea (1.1 g) at 750 °C under nitrogen atmosphere in the presence of CaCO3 (10 g) only and K2C2O4 (10 g) only are also provided. It indicates that the GU C a C O 3 ‒1 mainly exhibits macroporous structure with pore diameter ranging from 70 to 150 nm; additionally, compared with its GU‒1 counterpart, pores in the GU C a C O 3 ‒1 is less abundant. As for the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒1, it displays sheet-like bulk structure without any macropore being found; moreover, it is difficult to observe meso- and micropores in the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒1 from FESEM image. The template-free GU‒1 prepared in the absence of both CaCO3 and K2C2O4 exhibits bulk structure (Fig. S1b), while majority macropores and minority meso/micropores are found in HPC support that is prepared by carbonization of glucose only in the presence of both CaCO3 and K2C2O4 (Fig. S1c). BAIL-functionalized GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (Fig. 1 e’) and GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (Fig. 1f’) exhibit the same morphologies with their supports. In order to observe the morphology of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] more clearly, their TEM images are recorded. As shown in Fig. 2a-d, 3D interpenetrating network of the samples are observed; meanwhile, not only macropores but also meso- and micropores can also be found. Additionally, the macroporous structure of the GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 is also found in Fig. 2e. In the case of the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1, it possesses uniform microporous structure with pore diameter of lower than 2 nm (Fig. 2f). 3.1.3 Porosity properties The formation of macro-, meso- and micropores in the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] materials is further evidenced by nitrogen gas adsorption/desorption and mercury porosimetry measurements. Fig. 3 a and b demonstrate nitrogen gas adsorption/desorption isotherms and corresponding BJH pore size distribution profiles of four BAIL-functionalized NHPCs determined by micro/mesoporous program. The isotherms show combined characteristics of type I and IV with considerable nitrogen uptakes occurring at both low (P/P 0 < 0.1) and high (P/P 0 > 0.8) relative pressure (P/P 0). The result implies that the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts exhibit hierarchical porosity consisting of macro-, meso- and micropores. The pronounced nitrogen uptakes at P/P 0 < 0.1 correspond to the micropores of the catalysts, sharp nitrogen uptakes at P/P 0 > 0.8 are related to large meso/macropores, and almost plateau nitrogen uptakes at 0.1 < P/P 0 < 0.8 are originated from small mesopores. The presence of small and large mesopores as well as small macropores in the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] is also reflected in their BJH pore size distribution profiles. As can be seen in Fig. 3b, the small mesopores of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] are well-distributed featuring sharp profiles and centering at ca. 4.0 nm (Table 1), while their large meso/small macropores are uneven-distributed featuring a continuous distribution in the pore diameter range from 15 to 105 nm. To further investigate the microporosity of as-prepared materials, nitrogen gas adsorption/desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution profiles are determined by microporous program. As shown in Fig. 3c, fast increased nitrogen uptakes occur at P/P 0 < 0.1, characteristics of the materials with microposity. The result is in accordance with the corresponding pore size distribution profiles, demonstrating that the materials possess micropores (diameter of ca. 0.4 nm, Fig. 4 c). Because the macropore filling occurs at pressure too close to the saturated vapor pressure of liquid nitrogen (i.e. P/P 0 closes to 1.0), the evaluation of macroporosity by the nitrogen physisorption measurement is limited. Therefore, mercury porosity measurement is applied to further investigate the meso/macropore distribution of the representative GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 and GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 samples. As shown in Fig. 3e, both samples exhibit a continuous distribution in the pore diameter ranging from tens nanometers to several micrometers; moreover, at smaller macropore range (50–5000 nm), GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 shows richer macropores than GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2. The mercury-intrusion curves show that more mercury is imported in GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 than GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 (Fig. 3f), in line with the result of Fig. 3e. 3D interconnected hierarchically macro-, meso- and microporous structure of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] materials is originated from their GU/GM supports, while the hierarchically porous structure of the supports is induced by the synergetic effect of CaCO3 nanocasting and K2C2O4 chemical activation [11]; meanwhile, self-activation of urea/melamine also contributes to some micro- and mesopores of NHPC supports. On the one hand, during the process of incomplete carbonation of glucose and urea/melamine at 750 °C in the presence of K2C2O4 and CaCO3, CO gas is produced via redox reaction of K2C2O4; meanwhile, the resulting K2CO3 reacts with CaCO3 to form double carbonates K2Ca(CO3)2, and thermal decomposition of K2Ca(CO3)2 yield CO2 gas. Additionally, self-activation of urea/melamine produces plentiful NH3 and CO2 gas. By the interactions between the expanding gases including CO, CO2 and NH3 with as-formed carbon intermediates and graphitic carbons (see Raman scattering spectra displayed in Fig. S2), the carbon species are etched, creating microcavity and small mesocavity in the wall of the supports. On the other hand, large meso/macropores with wide pore size distribution range that construct cores of the supports are induced by the multiple template particles derived from K2CO3 and CaCO3 nanoparticles including K2Ca(CO3)2, K2Ca2(CO3)3 and CaO. The unique hierarchically porous structure of the NHPC supports renders them combined characteristics of type I and IV isotherms (Fig. S3) and extremely large BET surface area (Table S1). That is, the BET surface areas of GU‒1, GU‒2, GU‒3 and GM‒2 are 957, 1425, 1626 and 1515 m2 g−1, respectively, which are related to urea/melamine-to-glucose weight ratio or nitrogen element content (Table S1). Since more urea/melamine can introduce more micropores and thereby larger BET surface area, the GU‒1 and GU‒3 possess the smallest and largest BET surface area. Additionally, HPC support exhibits much smaller BET surface area (631 m2 g−1) in comparison of its GU‒1 counterpart. In the case of single K2C2O4- or CaCO3-directed NHPC, the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒1 mainly exhibits type I isotherm (Fig. S3) and very large BET surface area (1455 m2 g−1), whereas the GU C a C O 3 ‒1 shows little nitrogen uptake (nonporous) and much smaller BET surface area (16 m2 g−1). The result further evidences that the BET surface areas of the NHPCs are mainly contributed from their micro and/or mesopores. In the absence of both K2C2O4 and CaCO3 nanoparticles, the resulting template-free GU‒1 has a very small BET surface area (36 m2 g−1). After functionalization of the NHPCs with ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups, the BET surface areas of the resulting GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] materials decrease significantly, originating from the block of parts of micro/mesopores in the supports. The BET surface areas and micro/mesopore proportions of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts are also related to the initial urea-to-glucose weight ratio. As shown in Table 1, increasing the initial urea-to-glucose weight ratio from 0.12, 0.49 to 1.94, the BET surface area of the resulting GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1, GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 and GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3 increases from 201, 452 to 673 m2 g−1, respectively; correspondingly, the volume ratio of micropores to mesopores (V micro/V meso) increases from 0.26, 0.54 to 2.04. The result suggests that self-activation of urea mainly contributes microporosity to the hierarchically porous structure of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]. As for glucose- and melamine-derived GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2, its V micro/V meso is 0.28, lower than that of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2. The result implies that contribution of micropores due to self-activation of melamine is negligible, originating from that little NH3 gas is generated during thermal decomposition of melamine [42,43]. From Fig. 3b and e it is also observed that the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] with lower urea-to-glucose weight ratio possesses higher macroporosity, and they follow macroporosity order: GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 > GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 > GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3. 3.1.4 Structural information The graphitization degree of the NHPC support and GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts is studied by Raman scattering spectroscopy (Fig. S2). The NHPC support (represented by GU‒2) exhibits D band at 1352 cm−1 and G band at 1583 cm−1. G band demonstrates the in-plane vibration of the sp2 carbon atoms, while the D band is a defect-induced Raman feature representing the non-perfect crystalline structure of carbon-based material [16]. The intensity ratio of D band to G band (I D /I G) is ca. 1.0, indicating its defective structure with incomplete graphitization. The reason is ascribed that doping N atoms in glucose-derived polycyclic aromatic carbon structure has some influence on the graphitization degree of carbon. After functionalization of NHPC support with ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups, the position of D band is unchangeable, and I D /I G value still maintains at ca. 1.0; however, the G band of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] shifts to slightly higher Raman shift (ca. 1593 cm−1), indicating that functionalization of NHPC support with ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups has some perturbation on the graphitic structure. To gain deep insight into the interaction between BAILs and NHPC support as well as surface chemical states and composition of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3], XPS probe technique is conducted (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4a, high resolution C 1s XP spectrum of the representative GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 and GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3 samples are fitted and deconvoluted into four peaks centered at 284.6, 286.1, 289.0 and 292.2 eV, corresponding to three sp2 graphitic carbon species from CC, CN and CO bonds in N-doped polycyclic aromatic carbon framework as well as CF bonds from SO3CF3 − anion, respectively [44]. Successful introduction of N atoms into graphitic carbon framework and chemical states of nitrogen species is confirmed by high resolution N 1s XP spectrum displayed in Fig. 4b. Three deconvoluted N 1s peaks are attributed to N species from CN (399.6 eV) and N+–H (401.6 eV) bonds of N-doped hierarchically porous carbonaceous framework as well as N+–C (quaternary-N species, 400.6 eV) of the protonated structure of GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] [45]. High resolution S 2p XP spectrum can further evidence successful functionalization of NHPCs with ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups. As can be seen from Fig. 4c, two deconvoluted characteristic peaks centered at 169.0 (S 2p1/2) and 167.9 eV (S 2p3/2) are attributing to sulfur species from the PrSO3H group and SO3CF3 − anion [46]. Similarly, Fig. 4d displays high resolution F 1s XP spectra, and the peak positioned at 688.0 eV is assigned to F species of CF bonds from ‒[SO3CF3] groups [22]."
7,Catalytic performance evaluation,"3.2 Catalytic performance evaluation 3.2.1 Catalytic activity and selectivity The catalytic activity and selectivity of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] are evaluated by esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in toluene media. To obtain the highest acetic acid removal efficiency and the highest yield of benzyl acetate or 4-methoxybenzyl acetate simultaneously, the influence of the key experimental parameters including benzyl alcohol/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol-to-acetic acid molar ratio (n BA:n AA or n MA:n AA) and reaction temperature is studied firstly. 3.2.1.1 Esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol to produce benzyl acetate At first, the influence of n BA:n AA value on the esterification activity is explored by selecting the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 as the representative catalyst. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the esterification activity of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 increases gradually as decreasing n BA:n AA value from 1:1, 1:2 to 1:3. That is, after the esterification reaction proceeds at 100 °C for 60 min, the yield of benzyl acetate reaches 70.4, 75.2 and 89.1%, respectively. Additionally, at n BA:n AA value of 2:1 (benzyl alcohol is excessive), the yield of benzyl acetate is also the highest (87.7%, 60 min). This is due to the fact that esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol is an equilibrium limitation reaction, and excessive acetic acid or benzyl alcohol can forward the reaction to the formation of benzyl acetate. At n BA:n AA value of 1:3, the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 also shows the highest conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity to benzyl acetate, and after the esterification reaction proceeds for 60 min, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity to benzyl acetate are 93.2 and 95.6%, respectively (Fig. 5b). Under the same reaction time, the conversion of benzyl alcohol (85.1 and 80.6%) and the selectivity to benzyl acetate (88.4 and 87.3%) decrease slightly at n BA:n AA values of 1:2 and 1:1. To confirm the excellent selectivity of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 to benzyl acetate, GC–MS analysis is performed. As shown in Fig. S4a, after the esterification reaction carries out at n BA:n AA value of 1:3 for 60 min (yield of benzyl acetate is 89.1%), only trace side products such as monobenzyltoluene (retention time of 15.06 min), benzyltoluene (retention time of 15.20 min) and diphenyl ether (retention time of 16.49 min) are identified in the reaction media except for the product. Monobenzyltoluene and benzyltoluene are yielded from the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2-catalyzed condensation of benzyl alcohol with toluene, while diphenyl ether is produced by the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2-catalyzed etherification of benzyl alcohol (Scheme 2 a). Generally, raw pyrolysis biofuels contain abundant acetic acid; additionally, acetic acid is more inexpensive than benzyl alcohol. Therefore, in subsequent catalytic tests, n BA:n AA value is set at 1:3 so that the acidity and oxygen content of crude pyrolysis biofuels can be reduced; meanwhile, the value added benzyl acetate can be produced with high yield. Fig. 5c shows the influence of the reaction temperature on the yield of benzyl acetate catalyzed by the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2, finding that the yield (69.2, 81.8 and 89.1% at 60 min) increases gradually with the temperature changing from 80 to 100 °C, and continuous increasing the temperature to 110 °C, the increase of the yield (93.8% at 60 min) is unobvious. The result suggests that higher reaction temperature can speed the esterification reaction to produce the ester with high yield, and therefore the reaction temperature is set at 100 °C to obtain high yield of the ester. To further confirm that the esterification is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, excessive acetic acid or benzyl alcohol as well as higher temperature can forward the reaction to the formation of benzyl acetate and thereby higher benzyl acetate yield, the reaction rate constants of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol performed at n BA:n AA values of 1:1 (0.0194 min−1), 1:2 (0.0205 min−1) and 1:3 (0.0329 min−1) are determined on the basis of the plots of lnc 0/ct vs. t (Fig. S5a), showing that the reaction rate increases obviously with changing the n BA:n AA value from 1:1, 1:2 to 1:3; additionally, the determined rate constants of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol performed at 80 (0.0184 min−1), 90 (0.0282 min−1) and 100 °C (0.0329 min−1) continuously increase (Fig. S5b), indicating that higher reaction temperature has a positive influence on the reaction rate obviously. At n BA:n AA value of 1:3 and 100 °C, the esterification activity of various BAIL functionalized NHPCs and reference acid catalysts is compared (Fig. 5d). Firstly, contribution of the NHPC support (representated by GU‒1) to the esterification activity is tested, showing that only 1.0% of benzyl acetate yield is obtained after the GU‒1-catalyzed reaction proceeds for 60 min. Otherwise, three glucose and urea-derived GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts exhibit excellent esterification activity, and their esterification activity follow the order: GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 > GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 > GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3. For instance, over period of 60 min, the corresponding benzyl acetate yield is 99.2, 89.1 and 83.4%. As for glucose and melamine-derived GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2, it exhibits similar benzyl acetate yield (88.4%, 60 min) with its GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 counterpart. In the cases of single K2C2O4- or CaCO3-directed, glucose and urea-derived NHPCs-supported BAILs, i.e., GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 and GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1, they both exhibit remarkably lower esterification activity than their GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 counterpart; moreover, the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (79.5%, 60 min) is more active than the GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (53.7%, 60 min). Template-free GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 possesses poor activity (20.7%) in this reaction under the identical reaction conditions. Previously prepared ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] functionalized ethyl-bridged organosilica hollow nanospheres, [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs with ‒SO3H loading of 8.4% (sulphur element content of 6.6%) and Brønsted acid site density of 1060 μeq(H+) g−1 [47], also displays good esterification activity in target reaction, and the yield of benzyl acetate is 74.4% under the same reaction conditions. Homogeneous p-toluenesulfonic acid with super strong Brønsted acidity exhibits the highest benzyl acetate yield (99.1%) among all tested catalysts, however, unavoidable problems such as waste generation, equipment corrosion and recycling difficulty render it lacking of competitiveness with respect to heterogeneous GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts. Additionally, all GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts show significantly higher esterification activity than Amberlyst-15 resin (30.2%, 60 min) and HY zeolite (2.2%, 60 min). As displayed in Fig. 5e, lower benzyl acetate yield in Amberlyst-15 resin-catalyzed esterification reaction is due to its low selectivity to the product because the conversion of benzyl alcohol (82.8%, 60 min) is relatively high. GC–MS analysis can support the above result (Fig. S4b), finding that considerable amount of undesired byproducts including diphenyl ether (retention time of 15.51 min), monobenzyltoluene (retention time of 14.08 min) and benzyltoluene (retention time of 14.23 min) produce in the reaction system, but only small amount of benzyl acetate (retention time of 9.03 min) is yielded. This is due to the fact that Amberlyst-15 resin is swollen by plentiful of toluene at 100 °C, resulting in its high affinity to toluene and benzyl alcohol rather than acetic acid. Accordingly, condensation of benzyl alcohol with toluene and etherification of benzyl alcohol are more favorable reactions with respect to esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol [47]. The result suggests that use of Amberlyst-15 resin is limited to raw pyrolysis biofuel upgrading via esterification of acetic acid. As for HY zeolite-catalyzed esterification reaction, the conversion of benzyl alcohol is also very low (15.6%, 60 min), suggesting that HY zeolite is almost inert to this reaction although it has a very large specific surface area. The result is further supported by GC–MS analysis (Fig. S4c), in which only trace benzyl acetate (retention time of 8.97 min) and a small amount of diphenyl ether (retention time of 15.49 min), monobenzyltoluene (retention time of 14.06 min) and benzyltoluene (retention time of 14.19 min) are identified. 3.2.1.2 Esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol to produce 4-methoxybenzyl acetate The catalytic activity of various BAIL functionalized NHPCs is further evaluated by esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in toluene media, another reaction for upgrading crude pyrolysis biofuel and the production of value-added 4-methoxybenzyl acetate (biofuel stabilizer [48]) simultaneously (Fig. 6 ). At first, the impact of n MA:n AA value on the catalytic activity of the representative GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 catalyst is explored. As shown in Fig. 6a, the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate increases gradually with decreasing n BA:n AA value from 1:1, 1:2 to 1:3, and the corresponding yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is 20.8, 52.7 and 72.7%, respectively, after the esterification reaction proceeds for 60 min at 50 °C. The result reflects that excessive acetic acid can speed the esterification reaction with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, similar to the first target reaction, and the n MA:n AA value is therefore set at 1:3 in subsequent catalytic tests. The influence of the reaction temperature on the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate over the representative GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 catalyst is then studied. As shown in Fig. 6b, the influence of the reaction temperature on the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is complicated. At lower reaction temperature (40 and 50 °C), the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate monotonically increases with the reaction time; meanwhile, increasing the temperature from 40 to 50 °C, the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate increases sharply. For example, after the reaction proceeds for 60 min, the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is 25.0% (40 °C) and 72.7% (50 °C), respectively. Continuous increasing the temperature to 60 °C or higher, influence of the temperature on the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate exhibit a volcano trend: the highest yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate occurs at 40 (77.9%, 60 °C), 20 (71.9%, 70 °C) and 10 min (64.9%, 80 °C), respectively, and then the yield begins to decrease with prolonging the reaction time. To explain the above results, the products and byproducts yielded during the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol at different reaction temperatures and times are identified by GC–MS analysis. As shown in Fig. S6b). As shown in Scheme 2b, 4,4-dimethoxydiphenylmethane is formed due to the acid-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, while bis(4-methoxybenzyl)ether is yielded owing to the acid-catalyzed etherification of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol. The formation of these byproducts may compete with the production of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate, leading to the decreased selectivity of the catalyst to 4-methoxybenzyl acetate and thereby the limited yield (72.7%, 60 min). When the reaction performs at 70 °C and 10 min, conversion of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol is fast, accompanying with the formation of considerable 4-methoxybenzyl acetate; additionally, two byproducts including 4,4-dimethoxydiphenylmethane (retention time of 19.89 min; trace) and bis(4-methoxybenzyl)ether (retention time of 21.97 min; small) are found (Fig. S7c). Based on the above discussion it is concluded that increasing the reaction temperature and extending the reaction time result in the formation of more byproducts with remarkably large amount during the process of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, which ultimately give rise to poor selectivity to 4-methoxybenzyl acetate and thereby continuously decreased yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate. Therefore, the reaction temperature of esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol is chosen at 50 °C. At n MA:n AA value of 1:3 and 50 °C, the catalytic activity of various BAIL-functionalized NHPCs as well as the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs in esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in toluene media is tested. Contribution of the NHPC support (representated by GU‒1) to the target reaction is negligible, and only 1.2% of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate yield is obtained after the GU‒1-catalyzed esterification reaction proceeds for 60 min. However, significant amount of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is yielded in the presence of various acid catalysts (Fig. 6c). Moreover, four tested GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts follow the same activity order in the production of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate and benzyl acetate: after the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1-, GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2-, GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2- and GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3-catalyzed esterification reaction proceeds for 60 min, the yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is 83.2, 74.3, 72.7 and 64.1%, respectively. Under the same reaction conditions, single K2C2O4- or CaCO3-directed, glucose and urea-derived BAIL-functionalized NHPCs, i.e., GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 or GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1, exhibits lower esterification activity than their GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 counterpart; additionally, the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (4-methoxybenzyl acetate yield of 55.2%, 60 min) is more active than the GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (4-methoxybenzyl acetate yield of 47.3%, 60 min). As for template-free GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1-catalyzed esterification reaction, only 11.6% of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is produced. The yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is 57.1% over the [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol proceeds for 60 min. As displayed in Fig. 6d, homogeneous p-toluenesulfonic acid-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol exhibits relatively high conversion of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (77.8%, 60 min) but moderate yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate (53.4%, 60 min), implying that some side reactions deteriorate the selectivity of the catalyst to 4-methoxybenzyl acetate. Through GC–MS analysis it is found that significant amount of byproducts including bis(4-methoxybenzyl)ether (retention time of 20.98 min) and 4,4-dimethoxydiphenylmethane (retention time of 18.89 min) are formed in the reaction system (Fig. S8a). Consequently, lower selectivity of p-toluenesulfonic acid to 4-methoxybenzyl acetate leads to the moderate yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate. However, Amberlyst-15 resin and HY zeolite are almost inert to the target reaction, and the corresponding conversion of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and yield of 4-methoxybenzyl acetate is extremely low, i.e., 6.2 and 5.0% (Amberlyst-15 resin) and 4.8 and 1.8% (HY zeolite). Additionally, less side products yielded in both systems as confirmed by GC–MS shown in Fig. S8b and c. Considering the difference of the tested acid catalysts in acid site densities, their esterification activity is further compared by TOF values. Here, TOF values are calculated from the linear portion of the initial reaction rate profile for the benzyl acetate yield (Fig. 7 a) and 4-methoxybenzyl acetate yield (Fig. 7b), which are normalized by the acid site densities (Table 1). It shows that the representative GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 catalyst with TOF values of 4.95 and 2.52 min−1 exhibits the highest catalytic activity in both esterification reactions, significantly outperforming p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.82 and 0.36 min−1), Amberlyst-15 resin (0.15 and 0.12 min−1) and HY zeolite (0.11 and 0.11 min−1). 3.2.2 Explanation of the catalytic activity The excellent esterification activity of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] in the above two target reactions is attributed to their super strong Brønsted acid strength and unique hierarchically porous structure with 3D interconnected macro-, meso- and micropores. On the one hand, the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts exhibit super strong Brønsted acid strength, which can ensure the production of benzyl acetate and 4-methoxybenzyl acetate rapidly and selectively. As shown in Scheme 3 , during the process of esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, carbonyl group of acetic acid molecule is firstly protonated by the incorporated ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups, which gives rise to a protonated acetic acid and increasing the electrophilicity of its carbonyl carbon atoms (step 1). Afterwards, the nucleophilic oxygen atom of benzyl alcohol/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol molecule quickly attacks the protonated carbon atom of acetic acid, which leads to the oxonium ion I (step 2). Next, the oxonium ion I undergoes a proton transfer to generate the oxonium ion II (step 3), and subsequently dehydration from oxonium ion II leads to the protonated benzyl acetate/4-methoxybenzyl acetate (step 4). Finally, deprotonation from the protonated benzyl acetate/4-methoxybenzyl acetate results in benzyl acetate/4-methoxybenzyl acetate, and the process accompanies with the regeneration of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] (step 5). Here, the Brønsted acid strength of the catalysts is measured by nonaqueous potentiometric titration with n-butylamine (0.1 mol L−1) in acetonitrile. In this method, the initial electrode potential (E i) indicates the maximum acid strength of the surface site, and the sample with E i value higher than 100 mV is defined as the super strong solid acid [49]. From the potentiometric titration curves shown in Fig. S9 it is found that seven tested samples present similar potentiometric titration behaviors, and the measured E i values are in the range of 612‒684 mV (Table 1). The result clearly confirms the super strong Brønsted acidity of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] as well as the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 and GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1, and their Brønsted acid strength has little to do with the nitrogen element contents, morphological characteristics and porosity properties. Accordingly, the Brønsted acid strength of the BAIL-functionalized NHPCs are dominated by the incorporated ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups. As for Amberlyst-15 resin (E i value of 617 mV) and HY zeolite (E i value of 426 mV), their Brønsted acid strength is lower than that of the BAIL-functionalized NHPCs, which may decelerate the esterification reaction rate and/or decrease the selectivity to the products owing to side reactions such as condensation and etherification. This is one of the reasons that Amberlyst-15 resin or HY zeolite is less active than as-prepared supported BAILs. To explore the influence of the Brønsted acid site densities on the esterification activity of the BAIL-functionalized NHPCs, their Brønsted acid site densities are determined by acid-base titration with aqueous NaOH (9.5 mmol L−1) solution, and the results are summarized in Table 1. It shows that the Brønsted acid site densities of the BAIL-functionalized NHPCs are influenced by the nitrogen element contents. Higher nitrogen element content can introduce more ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups and thereby higher acid site densities of the catalysts. As a consequence, three GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts follow the acid site density order: GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (980 μeq(H+) g−1) < GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 (1170 μeq(H+) g−1) < GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3 (1440 μeq(H+) g−1). In the case of the GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2, it has the similar nitrogen element content (5.6%) with that of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 (5.2%), as expected, they both have the similar acid site density. Similarly, the GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (900 μeq(H+) g−1) and GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 (950 μeq(H+) g−1) possess the similar acid site density to that of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1. By the combination of the catalytic testing results and the acid site densities of various BAIL-functionalized NHPCs it is found that their activity difference is not mainly originated from the acid site densities. On the other hand, the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts with 3D interconnected hierarchically macro-, meso- and microporous structures give the important contribution to the enhanced esterification activity as compared with template-free GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3], single K2C2O4- or CaCO3-directed GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 or GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1; meanwhile, the macro/meso/micropore proportion of the catalysts influence the esterification activity in some extents. Specifically, hierarchical porosity properties of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] can offer minimized diffusion resistance and shortened diffusion pathway to mass transport by open and plentiful macropores, while their high surface area ensures to highly disperse acid sites throughout the micro and/or mesopores. This synergistic effect of macro-meso-micropores in the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts significantly improve the accessibility of the reactants to the acid sites, giving rise to the positive influence on their esterification activity. Although the GU K 2 C 2 O 4 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 has much larger BET surface area (388 m2 g−1), its lower esterification activity than the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 is due to the microporous structure, which may severely decrease the accessibility of bulky benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol molecules to the acid sites and cause serious diffusion resistance of the reactants and products simultaneously. Lower esterification activity of macroporous GU C a C O 3 ‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 is ascribed to its very small BET surface area (4.7 m2 g−1) because of lacking meso- and micropores. Owing to nonporous properties, template-free GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 is the most inactive among all tested BAIL-functionalized NHPCs. Higher esterification activity of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 than [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs further confirms the unique hierarchically porous structure is favorable for highly dispersing the acidic sites, minimizing diffusion resistance and shortening mass transfer pathway and thereby the excellent esterification activity. As for three GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts, their activity difference is dominated by the macroporosity properties rather than BET surface area and acid site densities. The GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 with the lowest nitrogen element content (5.2%) possesses the most abundant macropores (Fig. 3b), which can remarkably diminish the diffusion resistance and boost the mass transport of the reactants and products. As a result, the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 is the most active among three GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts although its BET surface area and acid site density are the lowest. Based on the above discussion, the lowest esterification activity of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3 is owing to the enhanced diffusion and mass transport limitations because it lacks more macropores. The above explanation is supported by the kinetic studies. In these studies, three GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts with different macroporous proportions and previously prepared mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs are tested, and esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol is selected as the target reaction. As shown in Table S2, the determined rate constant (k 1) at n BA:n AA = 1:3 and 100 °C decreases from 0.0435 (GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1), 0.0329 (GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2) to 0.0291 min−1 (GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3), in line with the macroporous proportion of the catalysts; additionally, under the same reaction conditions, the rate constant (0.0273 min−1) of mesoporous [C3Im][SO3CF3]-Si(Et)Si HNSs is the smallest among the four tested catalysts. As for the activation energy, it is determined based on the Arrhenius equation lnk = lnA – E a/(RT) From the plot of lnk vs. 1/T obtained in the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol performed at n BA:n AA = 1:3 (Fig. S10), the E a is determined. As shown in Table S2, E a values are 18.3, 34.5 and 41.6 kJ mol−1 for GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1-, GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2- and GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3-catalyzed esterification reaction. The result is also consistent with the macroporous proportion of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts, and the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 and GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒3 with the highest and lowest macroporous proportion possess the smallest and the largest E a value and thereby the fastest and slowest esterification reaction rate. Similarly, microporous structure of HY zeolite with extremely small pore dimension of 0.53 nm × 0.56 nm is another reason that is responsible for the inferior esterification activity owing to poor accessibility of bulky benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol molecules to the acid sites as well as serious diffusion resistance of the reactants and products. In addition, because of the similar macroporosity properties, the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2 exhibits similar esterification activity to the GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒2. 3.2.3 Catalytic reusability and stability It is an important issue to evaluate the reusability and stability of the supported catalysts because leaching of the anchored active sites generally happens during the catalytic process. The reusability and stability of the representative GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 is evaluated by esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, respectively. After each catalytic cycle, the catalyst is recovered by centrifugation and then washed thoroughly with dichloromethane. Therefore, after five consecutive cycles the catalytic activity loss of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 in two esterification reactions is ca. 10%, suggesting its good reusability. To find out the reason of somewhat activity loss, hot filtration experiments are undertaken. After the reactions proceed for 10 min, the catalyst powders are removed by hot filtration, and then the reactions continue. As displayed in Fig. 8 c, the reactions stop after 10 min, and then the yields of benzyl acetate and 4-methoxybenzyl acetate maintain unchangeable with prolonging the reaction time to 60 min. The results suggest that no catalytically active ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] units remain in the filtrate, highlighting the excellent catalytic stability of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts under the reaction conditions studied. Additionally, the fifth time used GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 still exhibits 3D interconnected hierarchically porous structure, as confirmed by TEM observation (Fig. 8d). Therefore, it is inferred that somewhat activity loss after catalytic runs is owing to the adsorption of small amount of byproducts yielded from etherification and condensation of benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol on the surface of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 although dichloromethane washing is applied, and the speculation is confirmed by FT-IR spectra shown in Fig. S11. The adsorption of small amount of byproducts also leads to a slight decrease of the pore volume of the fifth time used GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 catalyst (0.21 cm3 g −1) as compared with the fresh one (0.23 cm3 g −1). The excellent catalytic stability of the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] is due to strong chemical interactions between the ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups and nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks, which can ensure the catalysts work as recyclable solid acid catalysts in practical bio-oil upgrading."
8,Conclusions,"Acid-catalyzed esterification of acetic acid with high boiling point benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol is one of the effective strategies to decrease oxygen content and acidity of raw pyrolysis biofuels prior to their catalytic hydrotreating; meanwhile, the produced esters are value-added compounds. BAILs with super strong Brønsted acidity are the promising candidates for the above process, and their separation and recovery problems can be solved by chemical immobilization of BAILs on suitable supports. In the present work, hierarchically macro-meso-microporous nitrogen-doped carbons functionalized by the ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] groups are successfully prepared via quaternary ammonization of the NHPC supports and subsequent anion exchange. The macro/meso/micropore proportion, BET surface areas and Brønsted acid site densities of the resulting GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts can be adjusted by changing initial urea-to-glucose weight ratio in the NHPC preparation systems. The GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts exhibit considerably high activity in esterification of acetic acid with benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in toluene media, and their esterification activity is significantly higher than that of single K2C2O4- or CaCO3-directed NHPC-supported BAILs as well as template-free GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]. The excellent esterification activity of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] is mainly contributed from the synergistic effect of macro-meso-micropores within the catalysts, which can significantly improve the accessibility of the reactants to the acid sites via minimizing the diffusion resistance, shortening mass transport pathway and increasing acid site population; moreover, the esterification activity of the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts is dominated by their macroporosity properties rather than BET surface area and acid site densities. The GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 catalyst with the lowest nitrogen element content possesses the most abundant macropores, which significantly diminish the diffusion resistance and boost the mass transport of the reactants and products. As a result, the GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3]‒1 is the most active among all tested GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts. More importantly, owing to chemical bonding ‒[C3][SO3CF3 −] units throughout the NHPC supports, the GU/GM‒[C3N][SO3CF3] can be reused for five times without remarkable activity loss and morphology change, and they are genuinely heterogeneous catalysts and display potential for practical applications. Further studies exploring continuous operation process via reactive distillation and catalyst poison in real pyrolysis biofuel systems are essential milestones to determine the applications of esterification reactions for real pyrolysis biofuel upgrading in a large scale."
