0,Introduction,"In the context of biorefining, the fermentation of pentoses to obtain cellulosic or second-generation ethanol (E2G) is generally not considered [1] due to the high cost of enzymes from yeasts and bacteria capable of fermenting simultaneously hexoses and pentoses [2–4]. Although it is produced in countries such as the United States, China, Canada and Brazil, the need to improve technology and reduce production costs delays its expansion and scaling [5]. Given the difficulty that not all microorganisms convert pentoses into ethanol, it is more favorable to use the hemicellulosic fraction to produce other chemicals with high added value. Hemicellulose is the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose [6,7]. Its heterogeneous structure includes pentoses (xylose and arabinose), hexoses (glucose, mannose and galactose) and some acids (acetic acid, D-glucuronic acid and D-galacturonic acid), as its shown in Fig. 1 . Approximately 90% of the hemicellulose corresponds to the xylose [6], contributing 15–35% of the total dry weight of the biomass [8,9]. Fig. 2 shown that, besides ethanol, from xylose it is possible to obtain a variety of compounds, such as succinic, acetic, lactic and butyric acids, butanol, 2,3 butanodiol, acetoin, acetone, propanol, furfural and xylitol [4,10]. Of the products mentioned above, succinic acid and xylitol were identified in 2004 by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) among the twelve compounds to form chemical platforms that allow the production of fuels, chemical products and pharmaceuticals. The compounds that make up these platforms must come from materials of biological origin; whose molecules have multiple functional groups capable of transforming into new families of useful molecules through biological or chemical conversions [11]. Xylitol is only obtained from biomass, it has no petrochemical alternative [12]. So, it constitutes a raw material of renewable origin to produce substances commonly derived from fossil sources. As a platform molecule, by means of different transformation processes, xylitol can give rise to propylene glycol (PG), ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol, xylaric acid, lactic acid and a mixture of hydroxyfurans [11,13,14]. Xylitol was first obtained in 1890 in the form of syrup from beech wood. Its discoverer was the German scientist Emil Fischer, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1902 [15,16]. Interest in the commercialization of xylitol as a sweetener began due to the shortage of sugar during World War II [15,17]. The raw material used was birch wood, which is why it is often called ""birch sugar"" [15], although it can be made from any source rich in xylose. The ""Technical Report 916 of 2003"" of the World Health Organization (WHO) states that balanced diet and caloric intake according to caloric expenditure are essential to lead a healthy lifestyle. The document encourages the reformulation of the composition of food products, in order to reduce their content in salt, fats (saturated and trans type) and free sugars [18]. Since then, the increase in the search for food alternatives more beneficial for health is notable. Consistent with these guidelines, the demand for xylitol worldwide has increased due to the low caloric content and anticaries action of this polyol [15,19,20]. Its consumption is highly recommended for people with diabetes or in need of low-calorie diets. Many food and pharmaceutical products have incorporated xylitol into their formulations [15]. The production of xylitol has increased more than forty times in four decades (Fig. 3 ). In 1978, the manufacture of xylitol and mannitol was reported jointly, with a world total of 6 000 tons [21]. In 2016, the estimated global market for xylitol was 190.9 thousand metric tons, valued at US$725.9 million. The forecast for 2022 is 266.5 thousand metric tons, with an amount above US$1 Billion [22]. Although xylitol is obtained from lignocellulosic biomass (cheap and abundant raw material throughout the planet), its production is concentrated in Asia Pacific, followed by Europe, the United States and Australia [22–24]. The costly manufacturing process of this polyol may be the reason for the limited expansion of its production to other countries. At an industrial level, xylitol is produced by chemical means through four fundamental stages: (1) obtaining xylose by acid hydrolysis, (2) purification of the hydrolysate, (3) catalytic hydrogenation of xylose and (4) purification of xylitol. This technology involves a high energy consumption, mainly in the stages of hydrogenation and purification. The factors cited justify the high price of the final product [12,20,25–27]. In the search for ecological alternatives to obtain xylitol, the biotechnological pathway has been widely studied. Despite efforts in metabolic engineering, such methods have not yet been able to replace the current chemical process [28,29]. Research on xylitol and its derivatives is on the rise, both chemically and biotechnologically. In the case of catalytic hydrogenation, by placing keywords ""xylitol"", ""xylose hydrogenation"", ""catalyst hydrogenation of xylose"" in databases such as Science Direct, Scopus or Web of Science, the publications in the current decade almost double the total of the previous one (Fig. 4 ). The studies are focused primarily on reducing manufacturing costs of this polyol by optimizing and reducing the steps of the technological process, the search for more selective and efficient catalysts, and its use as a platform molecule. This review is focused only on the chemical pathway, which is consolidated, but needs improvement to reduce production costs and make it a process friendlier to the environment. This document presents some applications of xylitol according to its properties and its potential use as a platform molecule. Are shown research efforts to decrease the steps of production of xylitol by the chemical route, fundamentally hydrolysis/catalytic hydrogenation reactions, without recovery or separation of the intermediate product (known as One Pot). Finally, the mechanism of the hydrogenation reaction of xylose and the influence of variables such as temperature, pH and pressure on the speed of reaction, yield and selectivity of xylitol are analyzed."
1,Properties and uses of xylitol,"Xylitol is a polyol of the pentitol type, also called sugar alcohol or polyalcohol. It is easily soluble in aqueous solutions since in its composition it has five hydroxyl groups, which give it a great affinity for water [20]. Carson; Waisbrot & Jones [30] proved the existence of two crystalline forms of xylitol. The stable meta form, with melting point between 334–334 K presents cyclic mono structure and it is hygroscopic, while the most stable form has a higher melting point (366–367 K), rhombic form and non-hygroscopic character. Due to its high heat of endothermic solution (Table 1 ), when xylitol dissolves in the mouth, a pleasant sensation of cooling and freshness is perceived quickly after consumption. This property helps to mask the undesirable taste of many pharmaceutical active ingredients or excipients. Xylitol is the sweetest of the polyols, being equivalent to sucrose in sweetness, but with fewer calories, and lower glycemic index (Fig. 5 ) [16,25]. Another advantage is that its two main absorption pathways (liver and intestinal flora) are independent of insulin. The permeability of the liver cells and their enormous number of enzymes allow to rapidly metabolize xylitol and turn it into energy. However, the absorption by the intestine is quite slow. All D-glucose from xylitol metabolism is first stored as glycogen in the liver and then released gradually. Thus, its concentration in the blood does not suffer the sudden changes caused by sucrose and glucose, which makes xylitol an appropriate sweetener for diabetics. In addition, due to its low-calorie load, it can be considered as a suitable sweetener for use in carbohydrate-controlled diets. Its consumption causes satiety effects, a low glycemic response and an improved nutritional profile [15,19,20]. The stability of xylitol is not affected by pH, so it can be used over a wide range of pH (1–11). The xylitol molecule does not have formyl or carbonyl groups (characteristic of aldehydes and ketones, respectively), so it does not participate in the Maillard reactions. Therefore, it is recommended to produce food products where the color change that occurs in this process is undesirable [15,20,33]. Since the early 1970s, the use of xylitol in dental health has been widely studied and recognized [32]. Studies conducted in Finland in the 1970s demonstrated an 85% reduction in dental caries in adults over a two-year period by substituting sucrose for xylitol [18]. Cariogenic microorganisms cannot use xylitol as an energy source and substrate to produce acids harmful to dental plaque. Being less fermentable than other polyols, xylitol exerts an inhibiting effect on the formation of caries and the demineralization of enamel. In addition, the growth of bacterial plaque decreases up to 50%, mainly those caused by Streptococcus mutans [15,17,32]. When combined with other protective agents such as fluoride, xylitol has a synergistic effect in the prevention of caries. This therapeutic action has been used to replace sugars in toothpastes, mouth rinses and chewing gum. On the other hand, both animal studies and clinical and field studies in humans indicated that the inclusion of xylitol in the diet can promote the re-mineralization of early caries lesions. The frequent consumption of products containing xylitol, together with good oral hygiene practices, significantly reduce the incidence of new caries [15,32]. The most common application of xylitol worldwide is in sugar-free chewing gums, because it is very convenient due to its organoleptic properties, good solubility and controllable crystallization, being very useful in the coating, in addition to the dental benefits. It is also used in candies, gelatins, jellies, chocolates, ice cream, yogurt, and a wide range of confectionery products [15,19,20]. The consumption of xylitol exerts a prebiotic effect by decreasing the fecal pH, providing an increase in the number of gram-positive bacteria in the feces. However, large doses of xylitol can cause transient gastrointestinal side effects due to limited digestibility and absorption in the small intestine (only 25–50% of the ingested dose of xylitol is absorbed). These effects are easily reversible when stopping consumption [15]. Due to its emollient and humectant properties, xylitol is used in cosmetic applications. It also has bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties that, in addition to topical use, can be used in tablet coating to improve the stability of the product [33]. Zacharis [15] and Mussatto & Roberto [20] collected information on various medical studies that report the use of xylitol as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of respiratory infections, inflammatory procedures, osteoporosis, acute otitis media, hemolytic anemia, kidney lesions, as well as in parenteral nutrition. They emphasize that the use of products that contain xylitol can inhibit the growth of several otopathogenic bacteria, which contributes to reduce the appearance of acute otitis media, and nasopharyngeal diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) carried out in 1983 a comprehensive evaluation of the available toxicological and safety data for xylitol through the Joint Committee of Experts on Food Additives (JECFA). They concluded that xylitol has very low toxicity through all routes of administration and does not represent a health hazard. Classified as a GRAS type additive (Generally Regarded as Safe), it is accepted for use as a food additive in Europe, Japan and Canada. It is included in the Inactive Ingredient Guide of the Food and Drug Administration (in oral solution, chewing gum), and in the list of non-parenteral drugs licensed in the United Kingdom [15,20,33]."
2,"Building block chemicals, the case of xylitol","Since it began the production of xylitol on an industrial scale, this polyol has been the subject of numerous investigations, as it was considered an expensive product, but very useful for specialized medical applications. As of the 2000s, the studies concerning xylitol are projected beyond interest as a food and pharmaceutical additive. The Department of Energy of the United States (DOE) in 2004 published a report that described the research needs of a group of products of biological origin that have multiple functional groups and can be transformed into new families of useful molecules. The selection included more than three hundred products. Then, supported by chemical data and market studies, the list was reduced to thirty products [11]. Subsequently, the potential markets of the selected compounds and their derivatives were analyzed, as well as the technical complexity of the transformation routes. The final selection was composed of twelve compounds: 1,4-diacids (succinic, fumaric and malic), 2,5 furan dicarboxylic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, aspartic acid, glucaric acid, glutamic acid, itaconic acid, levulinic acid, 3-hydroxybutyrolactone, glycerol, sorbitol and xylitol (Fig. 6 ) These promising chemicals can be produced from sugars through biological or chemical conversion and serve as an economic engine in a biorefinery [11]. Six years after the original DOE report, Bozell & Petersen [34] analyzed the initial list and included factors such as known processes with extensive literature, economics, industrial viability at various scales, market size, as well as capacity and flexibility to form new products. The evaluation conducted led to a new list in which xylitol remains one of the most promising compounds to produce derivatives. The final report of 2015 of the European Commission for the Directorate General of Energy highlights that xylitol and sorbitol represent high value products that show significant markets for the chemical conversion of sugars, without petrochemical alternatives [12]. The possibility of adjusting the reactions in aqueous phase (APR) of the polyols for the formation of different products including hydrogen, biofuels and biopolymers is a promising alternative in the biorefinery context [35,36]. The processes of reform in aqueous phase from sugars and polyols include isomerization, dehydration, oligomerization, aromatization and separation reactions [35]. Polyols are used in the formulations of polyurethanes, used in the manufacture of foam for mattresses, insulators, domestic and automotive seats, elastomers, adhesives [37,38], coatings and sealants. The key product segments include polyesters and polyethers [38]. Flexible foams are used in the textile industry, and in the manufacture of furniture, while rigid foams are used mainly for insulation purposes because they reduce energy transfer [38,39]. Several researchers have been investigated the use of bimetallic catalysts to produce alkanes and glycerol from xylitol. However, glycerol is a byproduct of the transesterification of vegetable oils to obtain biodiesel and is widely available on the market [35,36]. For this reason, obtaining glycerol from polyols has been displaced by the transformation to ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, potential molecules to produce polymers [36]. The products that can be obtained from xylitol are shown in Fig. 7 . It is important to note that, of these compounds, glycerol, xylonic acid and lactic acid are part of the list of thirty high-value chemical products considered in the 2004 DOE report [11]. Ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG) are produced industrially from petroleum derivatives, ethylene and propylene, respectively, via epoxide intermediates [40]. Polysaccharides, monosaccharides and high carbon alcohols are structurally similar to glycols with hydroxyl group compared with ethylene and propylene [41]. Those two glycols can be produced from xylitol and sorbitol by hydrogenolysis under heating and in the presence of reducing agents [42,43]. Since xylitol and sorbitol are obtained from biomass, the conversion of both polyols to ethylene glycol and propylene glycol then becomes favorable. The hydrogenolysis reactions are typically performed under severe conditions (433–503 K and 4–12 MPa of H2 pressure), and in the presence of bases such as Ca(OH)2 to promote the retro-aldol reaction. It is possible to obtain a combined EG and PG yield of 54–55% at nearly full conversion during the hydrogenolysis of xylitol (473 K, 6 MPa of H2 pressure) over 90%Cu-SiO2 catalysts [40]. Rivière et al. [40] synthesized and tested bifunctional Ru/metal oxide/C catalysts (metal: Zn, Sn, Mn, Sr, W) without a base promoter. The 3.1 wt%Ru/MnO(4.5%)/C catalyst was the most active with 22% of selectivity to glycols. On the other hand, Li et al. [41] obtained 97.0% conversion of xylitol with 65.1% selectivity of total glycols without base additive upon optimizing reaction conditions (518 K, 4.0 MPa H2 and 3 h). The directly selective hydrogenolysis of xylitol to ethylene glycol (EG) and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) was performed on Cu-Ni-ZrO2 catalysts prepared by a co-precipitation method. The researchers verified that Cu-Ni-ZrO2 catalysts possess favorable stability, and Cu and Ni are beneficial to the cleavage of CO and CH bond, respectively [41]. Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol can be applied as antifreeze and intermediates in the synthesis of more rigid and resistant polyurethane unsaturated resins [25,44]. Both glycols are used widely as heat-transfer agent and as raw material in the industry of fabrics, paints and polyethylene terephthalate bottles (PET) [23,40]. One of the greatest market opportunities would be the production of unsaturated polyester resin by direct co-polymerization with other glycols. Due to their non-toxic properties, these xylitol polymers are widely used in the medical-pharmaceutical industry [11,25,44,45]. Xylonic acid can be obtained from xylose by electrocatalytic oxidation in alkaline medium or by biological routes [46]. Oxidation of xylitol also results in xylonic acid. This compound is used in the food and pharmaceutical industry as acidulant, sequestrant [44], chelating agent, complexing agent, or precursor to synthesize polyesters, hydrogels or copolyamides [47]. In addition, through a biological route, xylonic acid is used to obtain 1,2,4-butanetriol, starting material in the synthesis of trinitrate 1,2,4-butanetriol, an explosive superior to nitroglycerin [46–48]. The mixture of xylonic acid and gluconic acid exerts the functions of dispersing agent, retardant and water reducer, so it could be used in the cement and concrete industries [46]. Ma et al. [47] exhorted to study the catalytic activity of D-xylonic acid in the synthesis of pharmacologically significant molecules and natural products. The large-scale production of this compound has not yet been developed [47,48]. For its commercial implementation, it is necessary that the total yields reach at least 90%, which could be achieved with the development of new catalysts. In addition, replacing acids such as nitric or peracetic with oxygen as an oxidizing agent will be essential to be considered an economic and sustainable process [11]. D-xylaric acid and others aldaric acid derivatives have been employed in polymerization reactions, to be used as crosslinkers in hydrogels and crosslinked polyurethanes. In some cases, antimicrobial properties have been achieved with incorporation of aldaric acid derivatives, opening new applications in the cosmetics industry. There are currently no known pathways for microbial synthesis of D-xylaric or other pentaric acids [49,50]. The preparation of polyhydroxypolyamides from xylaric acid and other aldaric acids has also been investigated. Xylaric acid also contains three secondary hydroxyl groups that can be utilized in a reaction with isocyanates to make polyurethanes [50]. Lactic acid is obtained by chemical synthesis or by fermentation, with simultaneous saccharification and fermentation being one of the most widely used processes for its production from lignocellulosic materials [51]. Theoretically, any raw material containing pentoses or hexoses can be used for its production [52,53]. Few studies report other substrates such as hexitols, pentitols, PG and propanal for the synthesis of lactic acid [54]. Zhou et al. [55] obtained a slightly higher yield of lactic acid when using xylose as starting material than when using xylitol (31.08% and 24.92% respectively). Jin et al. [56] proved that polyols are converted to lactic acid more efficiently compared to glycerol. The various functions of lactic acid include its use as a preservative, acidulant, and emulsifier in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [53,54]. In addition, it acts as a controlled release system for pesticides and drugs [53]. For its moisturizing and antimicrobial effects, lactic acid is used in the manufacture of dermatological drugs and hygiene products [52]. As a chemical platform, it is used in the synthesis of propylene glycol, acrylic acid, 2,3-pentanedione, acetaldehyde, pyruvic acid and biodegradable acrylic polymers. Within the latter group, polylactic acid (PLA) stands out for its applications in the textile, medical and pharmaceutical industries, as it is an ecological alternative to plastics derived from petrochemical materials to make sutures and medical clips for wound closure, and artificial prostheses [25,51–54]. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) in the aqueous phase of xylitol in the presence of platinum (Pt) supported in zirconium phosphate gives rise to high octane oxygenates that can be used in gasoline mixtures [43]. Hydroxyl furans can be obtained from xylitol and used in the manufacture of solvents, PET bottling, nylon fabric materials and as a polyamide raw material [45]. A simple and efficient HDO of the ketone in a single reactor can occur under operating conditions in the range of 423–503 K and 1–3.5 MPa of H2 over a single bifunctional metal acid catalyst [43]. Li; Tompsett & Huber [57] used the Pt/ZrP catalyst to produce selectively gasoline in high yields (up to 73%) from the aqueous-phase hydrodeoxygenation (APDHO) of both sorbitol and xylitol. The reaction took place at 518 K, 6.21 MPa, 4 wt.% Pt/Zirconia phosphate catalyst, with 20 wt.% xylitol as the feedstock, H2 flowrate 40 mL min−1. Were produced during the APHDO reaction three categories of products: (1) light gases; (2) gasoline-range products; and (3) aqueous phase cuts or products."
3,Methods of obtaining xylitol,"Xylitol exists freely in nature, mainly in fruits and vegetables, although in amounts of less than 1%, so its direct extraction is economically unfeasible [7,58,59]. The richest sources of this compound are plums, strawberries, raspberries, cauliflower, berries, corn husks, oats and mushrooms [16], hardwoods such as birch and beech, wood shavings, peel cottonseed, nuts, straw, stems and corncobs or sugarcane bagasse, which typically contain 20–35% xylan [21]. It can also be obtained from bio-waste, including birch bark and pulp waste [23]. During the metabolism, the human body produces between 5 and 15 g of xylitol daily [15,60,61]. Industrially, xylitol is manufactured by catalytic hydrogenation of xylose in a three-phase process, in the presence of a metallic catalyst, Raney nickel being the most commonly used. Its elaboration is carried out in bath, using high hydrogen pressures and relatively high temperatures [62–64]. Starting from hemicellulose of the biomass, it is possible to recover approximately 50–60% of the xylans as xylitol [4,21,27,29,65] or 8–15% of the initial raw material [27]. Performing the calculation from pure xylose, this process reaches up to 98% yield [62,64]. The appropriate choice of raw material, which has a relatively high xylan content and is available in large quantities, is important. Most of the alternatives are bulky and low density [21]. The content of xylans can vary depending on the plant, fraction to be used, collection, storage, methods and pre-treatment conditions [66]. This chemical route achieves high yields of xylitol but finds as a barrier the high energy consumption due to the high working temperature, the application of pressure for the hydrogenation of xylose and the steps for the separation and purification of xylitol. The high sensitivity of the catalysts required for the reaction also increases the cost of production [[12,20,25–27]. The high price of xylitol in the market is largely due to all these factors [26,27], and its production can be up to ten times more expensive than the conversion of sucrose to sorbitol [7]. As the final purity of the xylitol solution depends on the separation of the by-products originating from the reduction reaction, there is a need to develop efficient and selective purification methods [12,20,25]. There are patents that describe the successive fermentation of glucose to obtain xylitol [67,68], or use biosynthetic routes from hemicellulosic, without the need to use pure xylose [69,70]. BeMiller & Stapley [71] patented the obtaining of xylitol by means of an oxidative decarboxylation process using uronic acid as precursor materials with pyranose or furanose ring structure. Nevertheless, methods such as converting glucose (dextrose) into xylose followed by the microbiological conversion of xylose to xylitol are generally not used [15]. The biotechnological method has been studied since the last century. Hyvönen; Koivistoinen & Voirol [21] refer to works that used the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, while others used yeasts to reduce xylose to xylitol. Several microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and yeast) have been developed that can ferment xylose to xylitol [26,72]. However, technological bottlenecks occur in the fermentability areas of the lignocellulosic streams used as raw material, with toxicity effects of the final products in the microorganisms and in the expensive separation of xylitol from the fermentation broth [12,72]. Some companies try to use this method to commercialize this polyol, but to date, it has only been possible to reach a pilot scale, and it has not been established as an industrial process [73]. From the point of view of sustainability, the implementation of biotechnological processes is the focus of several companies, such as Thomson Biotech (Xiamen) Co., Ltd. and ZuChem Inc. [23]. Finnish companies Danisco and Xyrofin Oy own several patents to produce xylitol via fermentation [74]. After the evaluation of the life cycle (LCA), Danisco reduced the environmental impact by taking advantage of a waste stream from the pulp and paper industry as a raw material, but still performs the conversion of xylose to xylitol through the chemistry route [75]."
4,Important aspects related to the chemical route of obtaining xylitol,
5,Stages of the process of obtaining xylitol by the chemical route,"5.1 Stages of the process of obtaining xylitol by the chemical route The industrial production of xylitol by the chemical route occurs in four fundamental steps: (1) acid hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic biomass; (2) obtaining pure xylose (in crystalline form or in solution) by separation of the hydrolysate and purification; (3) catalytic hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol at high temperature and H2 pressure; and (4) crystallization and purification of xylitol [27,65] (Fig. 8 ). 5.1.1 Hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic biomass The objectives of this procedure are: to break the rigid structure of the lignocellulosic material and decompose the hemicelluloses to their monomeric sugars, which dissolve in the reaction medium [2]. Two fractions are obtained, the soluble (or hydrolysate) is composed of xylose, glucose and other sugars (arabinose, galactose and mannose), whose proportions depend on the reaction conditions and the type of biomass. The lignin precipitates and together with the cellulose they constitute the majority compounds of the solid fraction [2,21,26,27,76]. The amorphous and branched structure of hemicellulose allows it to be easily hydrolysable, and it is possible to recover between 70–95% of its sugars [8]. With this method, cellulose does not decompose due to its high crystallinity, high degree of polymerization and low accessible surface area [6,27]. Traditionally, this process is carried out using diluted sulfuric acid at concentrations between 0.5–1.5% (w/w) and a temperature range between 394–433 K [8]. The major drawback of acid hydrolysis is the simultaneous appearance of unwanted side reactions [21,27,66]. The compounds that may be also produced during the hydrolysis can be divided into the following three groups: (i) substances released from the hemicellulose structure (acetic acid), (ii) sugar degradation products (furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)), and (iii) lignin degradation products (aromatic and polyaromatic compounds) [66] The conditions (temperature, pressure, reaction time, acid concentration and solid to liquid ratio) should be chosen to maximize the yield of xylose and minimize the formation of those undesirable products [27,77]. There are other methods to extract the hemicellulosic fraction, which include the use of inorganic salts, organic solvents, solid acids, supercritical fluids, ionic liquids [78], steam explosion, lime and ammonia processing and hot liquid water pretreatment. The latter avoids the addition of chemical products [3]. However, lignin passes to the hydrolysate in alkaline media and organic solvents [78], which is not favorable for the next stage. Pretreatment with dilute acid is considered the most efficient process for the conversion of xylans to xylose, combining effectiveness, low cost, easy operation and short reaction times [27,77]. The most commonly used acid is sulfuric acid [8,27], although the use of other mineral acids such as hydrochloric, nitric, trifluoroacetic and phosphoric acids and weak organic acids has been reported, such as the acids: acetic, maleic, succinic and citric [8]. 5.1.2 Xylose purification To eliminate or reduce volatile compounds, phenolics and undesirable by-products, the hydrolysate goes through a series of purification steps involving the elimination of dissolved salts, the degradation products and the color of the hydrolysate [79]. The effectiveness of this process depends on the raw material and the type of xylose extraction [17]. The treatments with activated carbon and ion exchange chromatography are reported as the most efficient to decolorize the hydrolysate and eliminate phenolic compounds, furfural and HMF, without loss of xylose [27,66,73,78,80]. Parameters such as temperature, contact time, pH and solid-liquid ratio influence the effectiveness of activated carbon treatment [17]. As for the ion exchange method, the anion exchange resins are more efficient than the cationic resins, being the first capable of removing 73% of furfural, 96% of acetic acid, 70% of HMF and 91% of phenolic compounds [17]. Other purification treatments use physical, chemical and biological methods that include ultrafiltration, neutralization, solvent extraction, evaporation, precipitation, treatments with enzymes or microorganisms [27,80–82], steam distillation, extraction with supercritical fluids, encapsulation, molecular sieve or the use of reducing substances and polymeric adsorbents [81]. These methods, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, were described by Wang & Feng [81], essentially aiming at biotechnological conversion. The methods of purification of xylose for use by biotechnology are called detoxification, as the compounds to be eliminated are toxic for microorganisms and inhibitors of fermentation. The steps of hydrolysis and purification of the hydrolysate are fundamental to obtain a higher concentration of xylose, reduction of unwanted compounds and to avoid poisoning and deactivation of the catalyst due to impurities in the starting material [62,79]. 5.1.3 Xylose hydrogenation Occurs in the presence of a metallic catalyst, generally at temperatures between 353–413 K and hydrogen pressures up to 5 MPa [21,27,73]. If this aqueous solution in addition to xylose contains other carbohydrates, all other sugars present are also hydrogenated to their respective polyols [21]. This stage, the mechanism of the reaction, as well as the effect of the variables that influence the hydrogenation process will be described and discussed in Section 5. 5.1.4 Xylitol purification The hydrogenated solutions go through the stages of purification, concentration and crystallization of xylitol [15,21,27]. The catalyst is separated by filtration and ion exchange [21,27]. Crystallization is a separation process in which a solid phase is created from a liquid phase. It can occur by cooling, evaporation or precipitation, depending on the solubility and saturation slopes with temperature [76]. The main steps in this process are supersaturation, nucleation and crystal growth [78]. The use of organic solvents promotes the growth of xylitol crystals and intervenes in the form thereof. For example, tetrahydrofuran promotes the formation of orthorhombic needles, while ethanol leads to a prismatic structure. In the absence of solvents, irregular or hexagonal shapes can be observed. The purity of the solution, the concentration of solvents, the temperature, the speed of cooling and the agitation are factors that influence the nucleation rate, growth and purity of the xylitol crystals [83]. The crystallization yield can reach more than 75%, with purity higher than 98% [79]."
6,Hydrolysis/hydrogenation in a single pot,"5.2 Hydrolysis/hydrogenation in a single pot The industrial development of chemical substances and materials obtained from biomass could be increased by decreasing the steps of the production process. The total time of operation, the consumption of energy and production materials can be reduced by means of multiple step reactions carried out by cascade catalysis without recovery or separation of the intermediate product. The reduction of the conversion, extraction and purification steps will allow this value chain to be competitive in terms of cost [84,85]. The cascade process includes the depolymerization of polysaccharides to their monomers by acid hydrolysis (catalyzed by H+ ions generated by water). Then in the presence of hydrogen (and the metal that acts as a hydrogenation site), hexoses and/or pentoses are converted catalytically into other chemical compounds [64,85,86]. Efforts to reduce the number of steps in the process of obtaining polyalcohols have been reported since the second half of the last century. Wisniak; Hershkowitz, & Stein [87] reported a study for simultaneous hydrolysis and hydrogenation using cellulose in acid medium and ruthenium as a catalyst, at 453 K and hydrogen pressure of 5–10 MPa. The reaction did not take place at pressures lower than 5 MPa, and at greater than 10 MPa, it did not affect the speed. The hydrolysis/hydrogenation process has been extensively studied and well documented from cellulose. However, despite discussing opportunities for the conversion of hemicellulose to polyols, few investigations are focused in this sense [26,88–90]. The method of hydrolytic hydrogenation on heterogeneous catalysts is useful both for the conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose, leading to a wide spectrum of products [91]. Hemicellulose depolymerizes more rapidly than cellulose, and of the products formed, pentoses are more reactive than glucose [64]. As soon as the xylose appears, the formation of xylitol begins, if the conditions of the medium are adequate. It is possible that xylose undergoes degradation more rapidly than xylitol, which is more stable [29]. The possibility of having several types of active sites in a single catalyst allows to carry out complex transformations of the biomass and turn it into products with high added value [92]. Acid catalysts with transition metals or bifunctional catalysts for hydrolysis/hydrogenation can perform both steps in the same container, which is highly expected in the industry [1,26,64,84,93]. The conversion of carbohydrates in a single stage has been analyzed using Ru catalysts supported on zeolite H-USY (3%). The acid sites of the zeolite favor the process of hydrolysis of the polysaccharide, as the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of the sugar occurs in the Ru metal sites [85]. The bleached kraft pulp was subjected to combined hydrolysis and hydrogenation, using Pt/Al2O3 and Pt supported in different zeolite materials (Pt-MCM-48-IE, Pt-MCM-48-IS, Pt-MCM-41) as a catalyst, at 2 MPa of H2 and 428 K. The acidity and structure of the mesoporous materials, the numbers of the active sites and the presence of metal influenced on the yields of xylose, glucose, xylitol, sorbitol, furfural, furfuryl alcohol, and HMF. The yield and selectivity of xylitol was higher using Pt/Al2O3 than Pt catalysts supported on zeolite [94]. Tathod & Dhepe [90] used hemicellulose (xylan, oat spelt) as a substrate in the catalytic hydrogenation directly from hemicellulose, through cascade reactions. They suggested that the use of Pt or Ru as base metal and the addition of promoters in the ionic form such as Snδ +, Gaδ +, Feδ + allow greater selectivity for the hydrogenation of carbonyl groups. The best result (73% yield of xylitol and arabinitol) was obtained with Pt (2)Sn(0.25)/Al at 403 K. Yi & Zhang [26] performed a two-step cascade reaction using a mixture of water and isopropanol as a solvent, as they observed that the yield of xylitol was higher when using said mixture than when using the pure components. Water favors the hydrolysis of hemicellulose in the D-xylose monomer, and isopropanol supplies the hydrogen source for the reduction of xylose to xylitol, in the presence of Ru/C as a catalyst. Working at 413 K for 3 h in a single container, they reached xylitol yields of more than 80%. Due to the strong crystalline structure of cellulose, it remained unreacted to these conditions. These researchers stress the importance of adding acid to reaction, to favor the hydrolysis of biomass, and they consider the process as green, because they applied small doses of H2SO4. They also comment that the use of HCl caused a high yield of xylose, but insignificant amounts of xylitol. They attribute this result to the fact that the existence of Cl− ions can weaken the activity of the Ru/C catalyst. Using an equivalent amount of solid acid (Amberlyst-15) the resulting yield of xylitol was 36.1%, and by doubling the amount reached 47.9%. Larger amounts of the solid catalyst produced a decrease in xylitol yield. Liu et al. [89] reaffirmed what was stated by Yi & Zhang [26] regarding the addition of the appropriate amount of H2SO4 could promote the rate of hydrolysis of xylan. They found that with an acid dose between 10–30 mg, the yield of xylitol was increased from 18 up to 78% (for reaction conditions: TCI xylan: 0.5 g, H2O: 9.5 g, Ir–ReOx/SiO2: 0.15 g, initial H2: 6 MPa, 12 h). Larger amounts caused reduction of xylitol yield due to the formation of by-products. The H2SO4 favored the increase of hydroxyantenium sites by competitive adsorption in the Re site with mineral ions, so it also improved the activity of hydrogenolysis of C–O Ir-ReOx/SiO2. In their tests, starting from xylan and adjusting the reaction conditions, they could separately produce n-pentane, pentanols and xylitol, with 70%, 32% and 79% yield respectively. Dietrich et al. [29] used organic acids and Ru/C in the hydrolysis/hydrogenation of xylan from beechwood to xylitol. They checked that the type of acid and its concentration, temperature and reaction time influenced the conversion of xylan. The presence of acid was fundamental for the formation of xylose, demonstrating that the concentration of H+ greatly influences the hydrolysis of hemicellulose. By using isopropanol as a source of hydrogen and reducing agent they determined that, perhaps due to the secondary esterification reaction, lactic acid was not very active as a catalyst (∼20% yield of xylitol), while, under the same conditions, with phosphotungstic acid, 82% was reached. On the other hand, some studies show that metals such as Ru, or Pt can facilitate hydrolysis and hydrogenation due to the ability to generate H+ ions in situ through the dissociative adsorption of H2 on the surface of the support, moving to acidic sites of Lewis and form protonic acid sites by releasing an electron, so it is not required to use stronger acid (solid or liquid) [92]. For example, Yamaguchi et al. [95] did not use acid in the conversion of several types of biomass into sorbitol, mannitol, galactitol, xylitol and arabinitol in a single container. They used bimetallic catalysts of ruthenium and platinum supported in carbon, modifying the ratio Ru/Pt. The highest activity was observed when using 3%Ru(N)1%Pt/C. They verified that the effectiveness of the direct conversion to alcohols varied according to the type of biomass. The global yields of alcohol from ground eucalyptus, empty fruit bunch (EFB) and rice straw were less than 50%; however, for ground bagasse and Japanese cedar they were more than 60%. Ribeiro et al. [91] evaluated the use of Ru supported on carbon nanotubes (Ru/CNT) as a catalyst in the direct conversion of corn cob xylan into xylitol. The amorphous structure of xylan allows its conversion to be faster than that of crystalline cellulose. After 45 min of reaction, they achieved a maximum yield of 46% xylitol. After that time the yield began to decrease, due to the formation of by-products, which could also be justified by the pH decrease from 7 to 5. They found that the direct conversion of hemicellulose to xylitol occurs in two stages, where the hydrogenation process of xylose to xylitol only occurs in the presence of the metallic phase. However, the first step (hydrolysis of xylan to xylose) can be carried out in the absence of metal, and slightly improves in the presence of CNT. Finally, they carried out hydrolysis/hydrogenation tests of xylan and cellulose. They noted an increase in xylitol and sorbitol yields compared to those achieved during the separate conversion of xylan and cellulose. This could be the result of a synergistic effect between the two substrates and not the substrate/catalyst ratio [91,96]. The simultaneous conversion of cellulose and xylan using Ru/CNT catalyst requires temperature adjustment to produce xylitol and sorbitol. After two hours at 443 K, the xylitol yield was 79%, but no sorbitol formation was observed. By raising the temperature to 478 K for 4 h, for a total of 6 h of reaction, it was possible to obtain sorbitol and xylitol yields of 73.9% and 75.6%, respectively [96]. Barbaro, Liguori & Moreno-Marrodan [93] used a bifunctional ruthenium catalyst supported by resin (Ru@Dowex-H) in the direct and selective conversion of concentrated aqueous solutions of pentoses and hexoses to polyols. The xylose was hydrogenated to xylitol at 393 K, 3 MPa of H2 and 7 h and no dehydration products were formed, demonstrating the high selectivity of xylitol with the use of this catalyst. This result is attributed to the low Lewis acid character of the catalyst, which favors the kinetics of the reaction towards the hydrogenation of xylose on competitive dehydration, under moderate H2 pressures. Sorbitol is only formed when the temperature increased to 463 K after 6 h. Under the new conditions, they reported that they obtained 1,4-anhydroxylitol with a yield of 94.9% because of the selective dehydration of xylitol. Ribeiro, Órfão & Pereira [86] recently tested different metal catalysts (Ru, Pt, Pd, Rh and Ni) supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT), activated charcoal (AC), graphite (GIT) and zeolite (HY) for the transformation of corn cob xylan into xylitol in a single container. They investigated the influence of catalytic support, the nature and charge of the metal, the amount of catalyst, the hydrogen pressure and the reaction temperature. The best result was obtained from 2 h of reaction using Ru supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT, 0.4% by weight of metal charge), at a temperature of 443 K and an H2 pressure of 5.0 MPa. The researchers comment that they could not find a relationship between the properties of the supports (porosity, specific area, acidity) and the activity/selectivity of the same, only suggest that a greater amount of catalyst could facilitate the production and degradation of xylitol. They achieved 80% xylitol yield, one of the highest reported for the direct conversion of xylan to xylitol for this type of process. Said result and the high value of xylitol would compensate the use of an expensive metal like Ru for the conversion of xylan into xylitol. Li et al. [97] reported the use of Ru/C catalyst in the corn stalk conversion into polyols (24.5% sorbitol yield, 12.2% xylitol yield, and 16.0% C2-C4 polyols yield) at 473 K, and in liquid alkylcyclohexanes (yield of 97.2%, based on lignin monomers in cornstalk) at 573 K. The synergistic effect between Ru and RuO2 at Ru/C catalyst played an important role overall catalytic process. The obtained products were easily separated for liquid alkylcyclohexanes suspended in the higher layer and polyols kept in the aqueous phase. Achieving a 100% selectivity at high conversion in a single vessel under the mildest possible reaction conditions is a challenge [93]. Catalytic technology will facilitate the hydrolysis and hydrogenation of renewable raw materials [65]. In the case of using isopropanol as a source of hydrogen, for large-scale processing, it will be essential to analyze the recycling and regeneration of residual isopropanol [1]. A summary of these results and studies is shown in the Table 2 ."
7,Catalytic hydrogenation of D-xylose to D-xylitol. Reaction mechanism,"5.3 Catalytic hydrogenation of D-xylose to D-xylitol. Reaction mechanism Hydrogenation is a redox-type reaction, where two hydrogen atoms are incorporated into the organic molecule [98]. It occurs in the presence of a metallic catalyst, at high pressures and temperatures. Metal ions act as efficient electron transfer agents. The reduction of the aldehyde to alcohol makes the molecule more symmetric since both ends of the chain are CH2OH groups. As the reduced product now has a plane of symmetry, the aldose becomes a meso compound and, therefore, optically inactive [31]. D-xylose, monosaccharide of aldopentose type, can be reduced by hydrogenation reactions forming as a result a polyalcohol or alditol [[98]]. Xylose is adsorbed to the active sites on the catalyst surface, while the hydrogen molecule undergoes dissociation, but the hydrogen atoms are added in pairs to the organic species [99–102]. After the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule (H2), a nucleophile is formed, in which the pair of electrons of it attacks the carbon of the carbonyl group (CO). The protonation resulting from the addition of hydrogen with the appearance of an alcohol group (CHOH), generates D-xylitol as the reaction product (Fig. 9 ) [98,100,101]. The product of the main reaction is D-xylitol, but during this process, isomerization (irreversible) steps can occur in an acid medium [100]. Xylose isomerize to form xylulose. The hydrogenation reaction of xylulose presents a mechanism like that of Fig. 9, however, it could be produced D-arabinitol besides D-xylitol, depending on the side in the molecule in which the hydrogen attacks the carbon of the carbonyl. The high reaction temperatures promote the dehydration of D-xylose, which forms a cyclic structure (hemiacetal), originating furfural as a byproduct [100]. Murzin et al. [62] state that due to the scarcity of hydrogen on the catalyst surface, furfural and, in addition, D-xylulose may appear. Alkaline conditions increase the formation of D-xylonic acid through the Cannizzarro reaction [62,99]. The reactions that can occur during the hydrogenation of xylose are summarized in the Fig. 10 . Mikkola, Salmi & Sjöholm [102] described the reaction mechanism through the steps showing at Fig. 11 . Steps 5, 6, 8 and 10 take places on the solid surface of the catalyst. The adsorption/desorption stages (reversible) are fast, while the hydrogenation steps (irreversible) are the controlling stages of the reaction rate. They assume that hydrogen and xylose compete in the same active center during adsorption. The kinetic model did not consider xylonic acid, since all the experimental tests were carried out in neutral or slightly acidic conditions. The competitiveness factor (α) is important in modeling to define the competition between the organic species and hydrogen in the active sites of the catalyst, where α = 1 for the competitive adsorption model. When the surface of the catalyst is completely covered by the organic molecule, α < 1, and some interstitial adsorption sites are free for the entry of hydrogen, then it is said to be semi-competitive [103]. Mikkola et al. [99] explain that it is not realistic to assume complete competitive adsorption between hydrogen and organic molecules because the organic molecules involved in the reaction are much larger than the hydrogen atoms. It can be concluded that the semi-competitive adsorption model describes well the disappearance of the reactive molecule (xylose), as well as the distribution of the product [103]. Wisniak et al. [104] stated in 1974 that there were only some published investigations on the hydrogenation of xylose and the effect of the operation variables, even though the kinetics of the catalytic hydrogenation of monosaccharides has been studied extensively. Twenty-six years later, Mikkola et al [99] made the same statement, and their work only cite Wisniak et al. [104]. It is interesting to note that in 2015 Murzin et al. [62] insist on the scarcity of publications, citing only works by Mikkola and Wisniak when referring to kinetic studies on the hydrogenation of xylose. In their research, Wisniak et al. [104] refer to works by Tomkuljak [105], who used Raney nickel as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of xylose (at concentrations between 3–30%). The studies cited [104,105] reported the pH drop caused by the xylonic acid produced by the Cannizzaro reaction, induced by the presence of nickel. Researchers say that the addition of a basic buffer eliminates the formation of side products and facilitates crystallization. They suggest using the information on the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol as a comparison, as it is more readily available. Wisniak et al. [104] conducted a kinetic study of the hydrogenation of xylose using Raney nickel as a catalyst, under a wide range of pressure rates (0.7–5.5 MPa), temperature (353–413 K), xylose concentration (1–3.5 M), catalyst concentration (1–18% Ni relative to xylose) and stirring (300–1200 rpm). They determined that the reaction rate constant (k) is independent of the initial concentrations of xylose, however, the values of k were proportional to the amount of catalyst present. The speed increases with increasing pressure until, at sufficiently high values, the speed will become constant. The reaction rate did not depend on the stirring speed, and the mass transfer resistance was negligible. Through the mechanism of Hougen and Watson they determined that reaction was of pseudo first order, and the controlling step of the process is the reaction on the surface between the atomic hydrogen chemically absorbed and the xylose absorbed at 373 K, in equal or different active sites. At higher temperatures, xylose was not adsorbed, but reacts on the surface with atomic hydrogen chemically absorbed. Wisniak; Hershkowitz & Stein [87] arrived at the same conclusions when studied the hydrogenation of xylose using the platinum group as a catalyst. Until then, there was little information regarding the action of ruthenium and rhodium as hydrogenation catalysts. With their experiments, they could demonstrate that rhodium and ruthenium were exceptionally active for the reduction of carbonyl in neutral or basic solutions and were relatively slow in acid media. They discovered that ruthenium is especially active for the conversion of sugars into alcohols at all the pressure levels studied. However, using rhodium and palladium at pressures between 1.4–2.1 MPa, the rate drops precipitously to insignificant values. This research found that higher concentrations of palladium are required to achieve the same results as ruthenium. Compared with the results obtained with Raney nickel by Wisniak et al. [104], it can be concluded that, for similar conditions, the rate decreases according to Ru > Ni > Rh > Pd. Recently, Perez et al. [106] evaluated 1D multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)-supported noble metal catalysts on xylose conversion in aqueous phase. Xylitol was the key product formed, achieving selectivity within 70–85%. With total xylose consumption within the first 1.5 h, Ru decorated in MWCNT was the most active catalyst. Contrastingly, Rh and Au supported samples could barely accomplish 40% conversion after 6 h. Among the studied samples, the activity order was established as: Ru>>Pd > Pt > Rh∼Au. Sifontes et al. [107] used the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model to describe the kinetics of the hydrogenation of L-arabinose, D-galactose, D-maltose and L-rhamnose on the Ru/C catalyst. They supposed that the speed determining stage is the hydrogenation on the surface of the catalyst. Also, they assumed that competitive hydrogen adsorption and organic components and adsorption and desorption steps were assumed to be rapid quasi–equilibrium steps. The simulation determined that for particles smaller than 0.2 mm, the resistance to diffusion is negligible on the surface of the porous catalyst. This resistance becomes severe for larger particles, for example, monosaccharides. They also observed that when the concentration of reagents is low, at long reaction times, the resistance to diffusion and the reaction rate decrease. In the case of cascade reactions in a single vessel, Dietrich et al. [29] state that the speed limiting step is the hydrolysis of xylan, which occurs at temperatures close to 373 K. Then the hydrogenation was very fast, with 100% conversion to xylitol after 5 min at 413 K. As for the activation energy, few investigations report the calculated values. Table 3 collects information on some works found. The catalyst and the support influence on the activation energy in the hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol, even under the same reaction conditions, as demonstrated by Sousa-Aguiar et al. [63]. In three-phase hydrogenation there are usually mass transfer limitations due to the limited solubility of hydrogen and the large size of sugar molecules [62]. A study of hydrogen solubility as a function of reaction time can provide valuable information to develop more accurate estimates of kinetic parameters and improvements in the reaction system [102]. Carbohydrate hydrogenation studies have employed a wide range of hydrogen pressures (3.0–16.0 MPa), but they do not guarantee that the reactions are of the first order in the catalyst and that they are not controlled by slow transport of hydrogen in the gas-liquid or liquid-solid interfaces. Typically, the reaction temperature (353–393 K) used coincides with the isomerization of glucose and xylose; however, high selectivity is generally reported. The retention times of the xylan oligomers are very close and prevent a precise quantification in the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system (HPLC), being able to confuse the compounds [29]. More kinetic analysis and carbon mass balances should be carried out to clarify the reaction pathways and guide the design process [1]. Kinetic studies have been carried out using numerical simulations [62]. Sifontes et al. [107] performed kinetic studies of the hydrogenation of L-arabinose, D-galactose, D-maltose and L-rhamnose. They compared the models: competitive (sugar and hydrogen compete in the same type of sites), non-competitive (due to structural differences, sugar and hydrogen adsorbed in different sites) and a semi-empirical model. They found that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood competitive model was better suited to their experimental data and that most of the estimated parameters had an important contribution to the overall performance of the model. A good description of the hydrogenation was obtained using the ModEst42 software for the estimation of the parameter, choosing the sum of residual squares as the objective function and then minimizing it with a Simplex algorithm. On the other hand, Pham et al. [108] used the Simplex and Levenberg-Marquardt methods and the numerical tools of the Modest software. The competitive model between D-xylose and hydrogen could describe the experimental data very well, with adjustment of the model of 99.6%, so they propose to use it in the working conditions employed (4.0–6.0 MPa of H2 and 373–393 K), as well as for scaling purposes."
8,Variables that influence the catalytic hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol,"5.4 Variables that influence the catalytic hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol Hydrogenation is a complex process, in which parameters such as temperature, pressure, pH, rate of agitation and the catalyst used influence the reaction rate and the selectivity of the desired product. Ancient documents report that the hydrogenation of xylose was a process that could take between 3–4 days. Tomkuljak [105] performed his tests at 303 K and 0.1 MPa, reporting that when working with 30% Raney Ni in water, a decrease in pH and catalyst activity occurred due to the appearance of D-xylonic acid, and the speed of reaction decreased continuously until the fourth day. They highlighted that they did not find reference bibliography. They suggested that it should be studied if Raney nickel also acts as a dehydrogenation catalyst, promoting the dehydration of aldehyde to carbonic acid, with the formation of D-xylonic acid. They also reported that the increase of 3–30% of the amount of catalyst and four times that of solvent allowed keeping the pH constant, the activity of the catalyst and the speed of reaction, in addition they managed to decrease the reaction time to 24 h. Finally, they found that the increase in temperature to 343 K reduced the reaction time to 7–8 hours, but with partial decomposition of xylitol. The advances of research in the hydrogenation of xylose have allowed knowing the influence of the different variables in the process. The reaction time depends on the selected working conditions. Generally, hydrogenation of xylose occurs at temperatures between 353–413 K and pressures of 4.0 MPa or more [62]. The solubility of hydrogen in the aqueous medium is favored at high pressures and high temperatures increase the reaction rate [62,63,90]. According to Wisniak; Hershkowitz & Stein [87] the reaction rate increases only up to hydrogen pressures of 10.1 to 15.2 MPa, at higher pressures it remains constant. More recent studies indicate that moderate pressures (4.0–8.0 MPa) are recommendable for the hydrogenation of sugars in Ni and Ru catalysts [110]. However, Tathod & Dhepe [90] worked with lower pressures and explained that the pressure increases from 0.8 to 1.6 MPa generates enough H+ and H− (by heterolytic division of hydrogen on the surface of the metal), both species being available for hydrolysis and hydrogenation reactions. Mikkola; Salmi & Sjöholm [102] proved that the solubility of hydrogen was strongly dependent on temperature and pressure, increasing proportionally by growing these parameters. During the reaction, the solubility of hydrogen increased slightly, due to the conversion of xylose to xylitol. They observed that in the reaction mixture the solubility of hydrogen was considerably lower than in pure water. The lack of hydrogen on the surface of the catalyst can cause isomerization reactions and the deactivation of the catalyst by incrustation [110]. Since the solubility of hydrogen in water is quite limited, the use of alternative solvents can improve the rate of hydrogenation [62]. According to Mikkola et al. [99] ethanol allows a greater solubility of hydrogen and, therefore, provides a higher reaction rate, but its use is restricted by the solubility of xylose. The use of organic solvents is limited since the solubility of xylose in many non-polar solvents is very low. Mixing water with a non-poisonous organic solvent could increase overall hydrogenation rates by increasing hydrogen solubility [62]. Pham et al. [108] used ruthenium decorated carbon foam (Ru/CF) catalyst and followed the procedure of Mikkola et al. [99]. They obtained a high conversion of D-xylose (up to 99.7% by weight) and high selectivity of D-xylitol (up to 98.4% by weight). The only by-product identified was D-arabinitol, and they state that it can be formed because of the isomerization of D-xylitol, as indicated by Salmi et al. [103]. They did not detect D-xylulose, but it could be produced from the isomerization of xylose and then converted to D-arabinitol in the hydrogenation reaction. The xylulose is formed at the beginning of the reaction and is subsequently hydrogenated in xylitol and D-arabinitol. In experiments at less than 363 K, xylulose and arabinitol do not form and the appearance of furfural is reduced [63]. According to Mikkola et al. [99] the amount of xylulose and arabinitol can be increased if the reaction is carried out under the influence of the gas-liquid mass transfer resistance and the outer surfaces of the catalyst particles. These limitations decrease and/or are eliminated with intensive agitation. The reaction rate increases with the increase in the stirring speed. Pham et al. [108] used 300, 500 and 700 rpm and showed that when more H2 bubbles are formed, the external mass transfer is improved, which allows decreasing the contact time between the reagent and the active sites of the catalyst. Temperatures lower than 373 K guarantee high selectivity towards sugar alcohols [107]. Temperatures higher to 423 K can lead to rupture of the carbon chain [87] and the by-product formation [110]. The higher the temperature, the greater the number of collateral products [62,63]. Yi & Zhang [26] found that the yield of xylitol increased almost linearly with the increase in temperature, in the range of 373 K–413 K. They obtained the highest yield of the polyol at the highest temperature. Similar behavior of the variation of xylitol yield with the increase in temperature was also reported by Ribeiro, Órfão & Pereira [86]. Pham et al. [108] worked in a range of pressures of 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 MPa and temperatures of 373, 383 and 393 K. They point out that the effect of temperature on the reaction rate is more evident than that of pressure, even in the selectivity of xylitol and the formation of collateral products such as D-arabinitol. These results agree with those of Sifontes et al. [107], who claim that the influence of the pressure for any given sugar is not highly significant, and at values higher than 4.0 MPa, the reaction rate becomes independent of the pressure. The appearance of undesirable compounds is also influenced by pH. Sugars are relatively stable in slightly acidic conditions. Alkaline aqueous media give rise to isomerization [100]. Alkaline conditions (pH> 8–9) also lead to the formation of xylonic acid through the Cannizzarro reaction [63,100,111]. Remains of NaOH in the pores of the catalyst and the autoproteolisis of the water can cause variations in the pH [100]. The hydrogenation of xylose in nickel is selective and the pH must be kept neutral, or moderately acidic [62]. However, if the pH of the reaction medium decreases to very low values, the Ni leaching of the catalyst becomes in a problem [100]. The chemical transformations influence the pH variations during the process. To avoid the isomerization of sugars or Cannizaro reactions, the ideal pH for hydrogenation should not exceed 6.5 [107]. Liu et al. [89] verified that in the hydrolysis/hydrogenation of xylans, the addition of small amount of H2SO4 is favorable for the first step of the process. However, pH lower than 1.65 catalyzes the dehydration of xylose to furfural, and from this humins are formed by polymerization. Dietrich et al. [29] also carried out one pot tests. They worked with lactic acid and phosphotungstic acid in a pH range of 2.1–2.2 and found that a lower pH leads to a decrease in the yield of xylitol. They showed that at 413 K the reaction was completed in one hour, while when working at 433 and 453 K, after 5 min, the yield of xylitol was ∼70%, even when using different acids (lactic acid and phosphotungstic acid). Murzin et al. [62] mention a patent for hydrogenation of xylose where ruthenium supported on zirconia was used as a catalyst, with a metal dispersion of 10%. They used a fixed bed tubular reactor and at temperatures between 293–343 K and reaction pressures of 0.5–30.0 MPa and reached a purity of 99.5%. They suggest that the main drawbacks were long reaction times (up to 100–1000 h) and the formation of by-products. Yamaguchi et al. [95] verified that, for the direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to alcohols, grinding pretreatment improved the sorbitol yield by reducing the crystallinity of the cellulose. On the other hand, regardless of the pulverization, the amount of xylitol and arabinitol did not change, indicating that the sugars of the hemicellulose in the lignocellulosic biomass could effectively be converted to sugar alcohols, even without grinding pretreatment. Hernandez-Mejia et al. [88] performed experiments with Ru/TiO2 catalysts at 393 K, varying the reaction times of 15, 45, 120, 180 and 360 min. They reported that the rutile species was more active and selective than anatase. After 15 min the first reached a selectivity of xylitol of 98%, and with the increase of the reaction time, the selectivity decreased markedly. In the case of anatase, a maximum xylitol yield (<80%) is observed at 180 min, but not a complete conversion under these conditions. They concluded that the crystal structure of the TiO2 support has a strong influence on the reaction rate and selectivity of xylitol. It is believed that the acyclic carbonyl form of xylose is active in hydrogenation [62,102]. However, in aqueous solutions at 298–373 K, the amount of the aldose is only about 0.02%, and ring forms predominate. After the dissolution of xylose in water, mutarotation occurs, and then very small amounts of acyclic aldehyde and two types of furanose (five-ring internal ether) and pyranose (six–ring internal ether) coexist in equilibrium [62,99]. A summary of the influence of the variables analyzed in this section are shown in the Table 4 ."
9,Final remarks,"The growing demand for xylitol has led to an increase in research related to this important polyol. Several studies examine the reduction of manufacturing costs by optimizing and decreasing the steps of the technological process. To reduce the hydrogen consumption, isopropanol addition as in-situ hydrogen source could reduce the cost for hydrogen transportation, but, for large-scale processing, it will be essential to analyze the recycling and regeneration of residual isopropanol. The use of real biomass allows a true analysis of the influence of the impurities of the raw materials on the activity of the catalyst and on the degree of purity of the final product. However, generally the experiments are performed with model molecules. For the development of an efficient technology, studies on the kinetics and the control of the different parameters of the reaction are essential. In this way, it is possible to achieve high yields and purity of the desired product, and at the same time decrease the formation of collateral compounds. The variable that most affects the process is the temperature, which proportionally influences the hydrogen solubility and the reaction speed. Simulation is an important tool that helps to perfect the process.
