0,Introduction,"The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated organic substrates containing CO and CC groups, such as cinnamaldehyde, 2-pentenal and furfural, is an important step for industrial production of fine chemicals and utilization of biomass-derived compounds [1–3]. This type of reaction has attracted great interest in fundamental research of heterogeneous catalysis [4–6]. Generally, the hydrogenation of CC bond was thermodynamically favored than that of CO over the supported group VIII metal catalysts [1,6]. The crucial challenge is to develop a highly selective heterogenous catalyst for hydrogenating the CO bond while keeping the CC bond. Extensive works have been performed to design catalysts for selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes [1,6,7]. One of the design strategies was modifying the electronic properties of active metal with electropositive second metals (Fe, Sn, Co) [8–14] or carbonaceous supports [15,16]. For this kind of catalysts, electron was transfer from the second metal or support to the active metal. The electron enriched active sites showed less hydrogenation probability of CC bond, which enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. Another design strategy was based on the synergetic effect between metal active site and electrophilic site [5,17–20]. The CO bond of unsaturated aldehydes was adsorbed and activated on the electrophilic site, while H2 was activated on the adjacent metal active site, and the adsorbed CO bond was further hydrogenated by the activated H through spillover. The electrophilic site can be generated from reducible metal supports, which exhibit O-vacancy when reduced at a high temperature [21–23]. Some reducible supports, such as TiO2, showed the strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) effect, where the partly reduced TiOx migrated to the metal particle surface [22]. Electrophilic sites can also be generated by modifying the metal active sites with metal oxides. For example, Tamura et al. modified Ir with ReO x to promote the adsorption of aldehyde group of crotonaldehyde, which significantly enhanced the selectivity [19]. Our previous work showed that the core-shell structure of Pt@SnO x promoted the synergetic effect of Pt and SnO x for the CO hydrogenation of acrolein [20]. Steric effect catalysts with enhanced selectivity were produced using the steric constriction between unsaturated organic substrates and the environment of metal active sites, such as modifying the active sites with microporous material (Zeolite, MOFs) [24–26] or long-chain ligands, such as thiol and fluorous [27–29]. Generally, the steric constriction orientated the adsorption geometry of the unsaturated aldehyde molecules, where the CC bond was prevented from interacting with the active sites [25]. However, the steric effect depended on the relative sizes of the unsaturated aldehyde molecule and the modifier. The pore sizes of Y zeolite were commensurate with the molecular size of cinnamaldehyde but were much larger than that of 3-prenal, thus Y zeolite encapsulated with Pt nanoparticles (NPs) was efficient to orient the adsorption of CO bond of cinnamaldehyde but was inefficient to orient that of 3-prenal [24]. Similarly, Pt NPs modified with different thiols showed tunable improvement in selectivity for cinnamaldehyde but not for 3-prenal [27]. To extend the steric effect to the selective hydrogenation of smaller unsaturated aldehydes, we encapsulated Pt NPs into ZIF-8, which has a commensurate pore size with 3-prenal, for the hydrogenation of 3-prenal and obtained an enhanced selectivity to unsaturated alcohol [30]. Although the selectivity has been enhanced by the developed catalysts, it is still significant and challenging to design highly selective catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, especially for simple aldehydes with small substituents on the CC bond [1,6]. Compared with cinnamaldehyde, smaller unsaturated aldehydes are more difficult to be selectively hydrogenated to unsaturated alcohols due to the substituents effect [6]. The steric effect induced by the pore constriction requires a commensurate pore size with molecular. ZIF-8 was a suitable porous material for 3-prenal, but the steric hindrance of ZIF-8 for 2-pentenal was unclear. In addition, the mechanism of the steric effect needs further investigation. Recently, multi-effects catalysts showed significant enhanced catalyst performance [31,32]. Pt NPs modified with aspartic acid exhibited cooperation of steric and electronic effects for increasing the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols [32]. It is a promising strategy to combine ZIF-8 with a more selective active site to enhance the selectivity for the hydrogenation of 2-pentenal. Our previous work showed that Pt-SnOx exhibited a synergetic effect for enhancing the hydrogenation probability of the CO of acrolein [20]. In this work, we developed a new concept Pt-SnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts with combined synergetic and steric effects for the hydrogenation of 2-pentenal. The mechanism of the synergetic effect and steric effect were also investigated by in situ Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was enhanced by the synergetic effect between SnO x and Pt active sites and showed a linear relationship with the Sn/Pt ratio. The apertures of Pt@ZIF-8 showed a steric constriction for CC bond in the hydrogenation of 2-pentenal but the ethyl group of 2-pentenal showed a lower hindrance effect than the two methyl groups of 3-prenal. The selectivity was further increased over the Pt-SnO x @ZIF-8 catalyst with combined synergetic and steric effects."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 and Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts with different Sn/Pt molar ratios y were prepared by a two-step method. First the Pt-Sn NPs with enriched Sn on surface were prepared by the liquid-phase reduction method modified from the literature [30,33]. Typically, 1.5 mL of H2PtCl6·6H2O/ethylene glycol (EG) solution (0.015 M) and a desired × mL of tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate/EG solution (0.015 M) was mixed with 1.5 mL EG at room temperature, followed by the addition of 150 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 58000). After being stirred for 30 min, the solution was heated to 50 °C with vigorous stirring under N2 atmosphere, and then 2 mL of ethanol containing 100 mg NaBH4 was added dropwise into the solution. The dark brown solution was kept stirring for 30 min and the obtained Pt-Sn NPs were washed with ethanol and hexane for three times, precipitated by centrifugation and finally dispersed in methanol. For the synthesis of Pt-ySnO x /SiO2, the as-prepared Pt-Sn NPs/methanol solution was mixed with SiO2 (Alfa Aesar, 147 m2 g−1) under vigorous stirring and evaporated with stirring at room temperature. Finally, the obtained Pt-ySn/SiO2 sample was kept at 60 °C for 12 h to form the Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 catalysts. The Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts were synthesized based on the “bottle-around-a-ship” strategy reported in previous work [34–36], where the Pt-Sn NPs/methanol suspension was added into 250 mL methanol containing 2.05 g 2-methyl imidazole. After ultrasonic treatment for 10 min, the solution was mixed with 250 mL methanol containing 3.67 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and kept at room temperature without stirring for 24 h. The precipitated Pt-Sn@ZIF-8 was washed with methanol three times and kept at 60 °C for 12 h to form the Pt-SnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns of the Pt and Pt-Sn NPs were characterized on a Bruker Advance D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) monochromatic radiation, where the samples were prepared by dropping NPs/methanol solution on a single crystal Si substrate followed by evaporation of the solvent. The actual loadings of Pt and Sn on the catalysts were measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, where the catalysts were dissolved by boiling the catalyst powders in aquaregia. Ultrathin slices were prepared by ultratome (Leica- UC7 + FC7) with a thickness of 75 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the catalysts were obtained on HRTEM (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 120 kV, where the samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol for 30 min and the solution was dropped on a carbon film supported on a copper grid. More than 100 particles were collected to analyze the particle size distribution of NPs. The chemistry of the Pt and Sn was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Thermal Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi) with a CAE: pass energy 100.0 eV analyser mode and an Al Kα X-ray source, where the samples were pre-reduced at 200 °C with H2 for 3 h before measurement. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on an Autosorb-IQ2-MP-C system (Quantachrome, USA). The CO-uptake was measured by the CO chemisorption. For each measurement, 100 mg of catalyst was pretreated in 10% H2/He at 200 °C and the titration was carried out by the pulse adsorption of CO at room temperature. The FTIR spectra of CO adsorption were carried out on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 470 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT-A) detector, by setting 64 scans for the samples at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Typically, 15 mg of the sample was pressed on a tungsten mesh and then loaded into the measurement cell, which was connected to the vacuum system. The samples were pre-reduced at 200 °C with H2 for 3 h before measurement, then the CO adsorption was performed at 11.5 kPa and 40 °C for 0.5 h, followed by evacuation at the same temperature until the pressure was below 5.0 × 10-3 Pa."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation The liquid phase hydrogenations of 2-pentenal were carried out in a stainless-steel autoclave. For each experiment, 0.3 g reactant was added in 30 mL cyclohexane solvent. The catalyst was reduced in hydrogen at 200 °C for 3 h prior to the reaction. The reactions were carried out at 80 °C and 3.0 MPa hydrogen. The stirring speed was set at 1000 r/min to exclude the effect of gas-liquid mass transfer. Catalyst recycling experiments were carried out under the same conditions and the spent catalyst was collected by centrifugation and reused without additional treatment. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC 7900, Techcomp Ltd.) equipped with a super-wax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 μm) and an FID detector. For the 2-pentenal hydrogenation, the conversion and selectivity were calculated as: (1) C o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = ( N A , 0 - N A , t ) / N A , 0 (2) S e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) = N i , t / ( N A , 0 - N A , t ) where N A,0 was the mole of 2-pentenal in the feeding stream; N A, t was the mole of 2-pentenal after reaction; and N i, t was the moles of the products. The TOFs were calculated as: (3) TO F t o t a l = ( N A , 0 × X ) / ( t × n a c t i v e s i t e s ) ( s - 1 ) (4) TO F C = C = ( N A , 0 × X × ( S S A L + S S O L ) ) / ( t × n a c t i v e s i t e s ) ( s - 1 ) (5) TO F C = O = ( N A , 0 × X × ( S U O L + S S O L ) ) / ( t × n a c t i v e s i t e s ) ( s - 1 ) where n active sites is the total active sites of the catalyst measured by CO-uptake; S SAL, S UOL and S SOL are the selectivity to pentanal, pentenol and pentanol, respectively; X and t is the conversion and reaction time, respectively. The in situ FTIR study on the surface hydrogenation of 2-pentenal was performed on the same instrument as CO adsorption. For each experiment, 15 mg of sample was loaded into the FTIR cell and was pre-reduced at 200 °C under H2 for 3 h. Then the cell was evacuated at 200 °C to remove the surface species generated during the reduction period. The background spectrum of the bare catalyst was first collected as a reference at 80 °C under evacuation. After that, the cell was isolated from the vacuum system and 0.1 kPa 2-pentenal vapor was diffused into the cell to interact with the samples. Then, the gas phase and physically adsorbed 2-pentenal were evacuated until the pressure decreased below 5.0 × 10-3 Pa and the IR spectra of the chemically adsorbed 2-pentenal over the catalysts were obtained. At last, high-purity hydrogen was introduced into the cell at a timely moment and a series of IR spectra were collected at different times on stream to investigate the changes of the corresponding bands."
5,Results,
6,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations The Pt-ySn NPs with a desired Sn/Pt molar ratio y were prepared by the liquid reduction method. It was reported that Pt2+ was easier to reduce than Sn2+, resulting in the formation of Pt-Sn NPs with enriched Sn on surface [33]. Fig. 1 showed the XRD pattern and HRTEM image of the as-prepared Pt-1.0Sn NPs. Compared with Pt NPs, Pt-1.0Sn NPs showed the typical Pt diffraction peak (Fig. 1a) without the formation of PtSn alloy. Consistently, Fig. 1b only showed the lattice space of 0.23 nm, which is the typical lattice of metallic Pt (1 1 1) [37,38]. The TEM images of Pt and Pt-ySn NPs were shown in Fig. S1. The mean size of Pt NPs was 2.1 nm. With increasing Sn ratio, the mean particle size of Pt-ySn NPs increased to 2.6, 2.6 and 2.8 nm at a Sn/Pt molar ratio of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, respectively. The particle size can be tune to small size with the addition of PVP which limits the growth of nanoparticles. With the protection of PVP, the particle size was only slightly influenced with a further increase of the Sn content. The Sn/Pt ratio of NPs was determined by EDS analysis and the results were summarized in Table 1 . Generally, the Sn/Pt atomic ratios were very similar to the molar ratio of the precursors, suggesting that platinum and tin were well reduced. The as-prepared Pt-Sn NPs were then supported on SiO2 or encapsulated into the inner space of ZIF-8 and were further selectively oxidized in air to form Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 or Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8, where y is the Sn/Pt atomic ratio based on precursors. The nanoparticle size was measured for Pt-ySnOx/SiO2 (Fig. S2). Generally, compared with unsupported NPs, a similar particle size was obtained over SiO2, indicating that the particles kept unchanged after being supported on SiO2. The actual metal loadings were determined by ICP analysis and the results were listed in Table 1. The valance states of Pt and Sn were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. 2 ). The Pt 4f and Sn 3d peaks were deconvoluted into different valance states, as reported in the literature [39,40]. Pt 4f7/2 showed two peaks assigned to Pt0 (71.2 eV) and Pt2+ (72.2 eV), and the peak area ratio of Pt2+/Pt0 was 0.03, indicating that the platinum was mainly in metallic state. Sn 3d5/2 was deconvoluted into Sn0 (484.6 eV), Sn2+(486.2 eV), and Sn4+ (487.2 eV), and the peak area ratio of Sn0/(Sn2+ + Sn4+) was 0.06, indicating that the tin was mainly in oxidized state. The TEM images of Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 are shown in Fig. S2, where the NPs were evenly supported on the surface of SiO2. The nitrogen sorption isotherms (Fig. 3 ) indicated that the SiO2 supported catalysts had a similar type and slightly decreased surface area compared with pure SiO2 (Table 1). For the preparation of Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts, the encapsulation strategy was based on our previous works [30,41]. The TEM images showed that the NPs were distributed in the inner space of ZIF-8 and no NPs were located on the external surface of Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 (Fig. S2). To further confirm the distribution of NPs over the ZIF-8, ultrathin slices of Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8 were prepared. The TEM images showed that NPs were dispersed inside ZIF-8 (Fig. S3). It should be noted that the ultrathin slices contained a thickness of 75 nm which was much smaller than the whole crystal size of ZIF-8 (∼500 nm), suggesting that the visible NPs in the TEM images were encapsulated inside ZIF-8. The particle size inside ZIF-8 was also measured and plotted in Fig. S3, indicating that the particle size kept unchanged when NPs were encapsulated inside ZIF-8. The ultrathin slices of Pt-0.5SnOx@ZIF-8 was further investigated by the EDS mapping (Fig. S3b), confirming that the catalyst contained both Pt and Sn elements. The Pt and Pt-SnOx NPs were also supported on the external surface of ZIF-8, which were denoted as Pt/ZIF-8 and Pt-0.5SnOx/ZIF-8, respectively. Obviously, a large number of NPs were distributed on the surface of ZIF-8 (Fig. S2i and 2j). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 (Fig. 3) were of type I and identical to those of ZIF-8, indicating that the microporous structure was preserved after encapsulating NPs. To further investigate the structure of the catalysts, the adsorption of CO followed by FTIR spectroscopy was performed. The samples were exposed to 10% CO in He balance gas at 11.5 kPa and the typical vibrations of gas phase CO and adsorbed CO were observed (Fig. S4(a) and (b)). After being evaluated until the pressure was below 5.0 × 10-3 Pa, the gas phase CO vanished and the intensity of adsorbed CO remained almost unchanged. The FTIR spectra of CO adsorption at 40 °C on the Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 and Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . It was reported that the FTIR spectra for CO adsorption on the Pt catalysts consisted of two vibration regions, where the wavenumber between 2000 and 2090 cm−1 was assigned to the linear adsorption on single Pt active sites and the wavenumber between 1780 and 1860 cm−1 was assigned to the bridged adsorption on two neighboring Pt active sites [42,43]. For Pt/SiO2, a strong absorption band at 2038 cm−1 and a weak absorption band at 1812 cm−1 were observed, which were respectively assigned to linearly adsorbed CO and bridge-bonded CO on Pt NPs. With increasing Sn/Pt ratio, the intensity of linearly adsorbed CO decreased, indicating that the amount of exposed Pt active sites decreased due to the surface covering SnO x species. In addition, the bridged adsorption of CO continuously decreased and even vanished at a Sn/Pt ratio of 1.5. These results suggested that the increase of surface covering SnO x species destroyed the large ensembles of Pt and isolated the adjacent Pt active sites. For Pt based catalysts, it has been well documented that the linearly adsorbed CO on oxidized Pt showed IR vibration in the range of 2080–2100 cm−1 [42,44]. In this work, linearly adsorbed CO on all the catalysts appeared below 2050 cm−1, indicating the metallic state of Pt, which was consistent with the XPS results. The FTIR spectra of CO adsorption on ZIF-8 with encapsulated metal NPs has not been reported in the literature, thus pure ZIF-8 was exposed to 10% CO in He as blank experiment (Fig. S4(c)). As expected, no band was observed after evaluation, indicating a lack of interaction between CO and ZIF-8. In contrast, a strong band at 2021 cm−1 and a weak band at 1812 cm−1 were observed on the Pt@ZIF-8 catalyst after evaluation (Fig. S4(b)), which were respectively ascribed to the linear and bridged adsorption of CO on the encapsulated Pt NPs. With the addition of SnOx (Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8), the intensity of both linear and bridged adsorption of CO decreased (Fig. 4(b)). In addition, the bridged adsorption of CO almost disappeared over Pt-1.5SnOx@ZIF-8. These results indicated that, over the Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8 catalysts, the adjacent Pt active sites were separated by the surface covering SnO x species. It is notable that the band of linear adsorption of CO on Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 showed a slight red shift compared with Pt-ySnO x /SiO2, which could be ascribed to the ZIF-8 support effect. CO-chemisorption was used to measure the amount of surface Pt atoms (Table 1). Although there are two types of CO adsorption modes over the Pt sites, the percentage of bridge adsorbed CO on Pt is very low, therefore a 1.0 stoichiometric ratio of CO/metal was widely used for Pt or PtSn catalysts in the literature [9,38]. This was also verified in our CO-FTIR experiments that only slight bridged adsorption of CO was found in Pt/SiO2 and Pt@ZIF-8 (Fig. 4). In accordance with the CO-FTIR results, the CO-uptake values decreased with the increase of Sn/Pt ratio, indicating that the SnOx covered the surface of Pt NPs."
7,Hydrogenation reaction results,"3.2 Hydrogenation reaction results The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes has been extensively investigated and the reaction pathways were summarized in Scheme 1 , including hydrogenation of the CO bond to unsaturated alcohol (I), hydrogenation of CC bond to saturated aldehyde (II), and further hydrogenation of the above intermediate products to saturated alcohol (III and IV). The saturated alcohol can also be directly produced through simultaneous hydrogenation of CO and CC bonds (V). In addition, the decarbonylation reaction to produce CO and hydrocarbon was reported in some reaction conditions (VI). Generally, the decarbonylation reaction to produce CO occurred in the gas phase hydrogenation [6] or some surface science experiments with lower coverage of unsaturated aldehyde molecules [4,5], but did not proceed in the liquid phase hydrogenation. Catalytic evaluations of 2-pentenal (UAL) hydrogenation were carried out in the liquid phase, and the selectivity comparison of the present catalysts was based at a similar conversion of ∼10% (Table S1). Consistently, only three products of pentanal (SAL), pentenol (UOL) and pentanol (SOL) were produced and no decarbonylation reaction was detected. Since the hydrogenation of CC bond (35 KJ mol−1) is thermodynamically favored than that of CO bond (40 KJ mol−1) over group VIII metals [1], the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was always below 10% in the hydrogenation of small unsaturated aldehyde, such as acrolein and crotonaldehyde, over non-modified Pt catalysts [6,20]. With the present Pt/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 5 (a)), the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was only 4.3% and most of the reactant was hydrogenated to saturated aldehyde (87.9%). With the Pt-0.5SnO x /SiO2 catalyst, the selectivity increased to 21.4%. In addition, the selectivity continuously increased with increasing amount of SnO x species. To further confirm the effect of SnOx, the Pt-1.0SnOx/SiO2 catalyst was reduced with H2 at 400 °C for 3 h. In the subsequent reaction evaluation, Pt-1.0SnOx/SiO2-HT showed lower activity and selectivity than Pt-1.0SnOx/SiO2 (Table S1). The TEM images (Fig. S5) showed that the metal particle size increased after the high temperature reduction. In addition, the nanoparticles showed a lattice space of 0.30 nm, which was larger than any orientation of the metallic Pt and was indexed to the orientation of PtSn alloy. These results indicated that SnOx favored the CO hydrogenation rate and thereby led to the higher selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. However, it should be noted that it is difficult to completely exclude the effect of a small fraction of Sn0 on the catalyst, which could also contribute to the enhanced selectivity. Previously, we found that the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was enhanced for the hydrogenation of 3-prenal after encapsulating Pt NPs inside ZIF-8 [30]. The enhanced selectivity over Pt@ZIF-8 was ascribed to the steric effect of the micropores of ZIF-8, where the apertures around the Pt NPs surface oriented linearly adsorption of 3-prenal molecules on Pt active sites through the CO bond while the CC bond was prevented from interacting with active sites by the two methyl groups at the terminal of CC bond. This kind of steric effect was related to the structure of unsaturated aldehyde molecules, for example the CC bond of acrolein without the hindrance of substituents could be adsorbed on active sites, thus the steric effect was inefficient for the selective hydrogenation of acrolein [30]. Herein, 2-pentenal had an ethyl group at the terminal of CC bond and the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol increased to 31.0% over Pt@ZIF-8 compared with 4.3% over Pt/SiO2 (Table S1). However, there is still 52.7% of 2-pentenal hydrogenated to saturated aldehyde, indicating that the ethyl group of 2-pentenal showed a lower hindrance effect than the two methyl groups of 3-prenal. The selectivity to unsaturated alcohol over the Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts was continuously enhanced with increasing the SnOx species (Fig. 5(b)), where the selectivity was enhanced to 48.5%, 62.0% and 80.9% at the Sn/Pt ratio of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, respectively. With increasing Sn/Pt ratio, the selectivity to saturated alcohol was kept at ∼10% over Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 but decreased from 16% to 1% over Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8. Pt/ZIF-8 and Pt-0.5SnOx/ZIF-8 were also evaluated for the hydrogenation of 2-pentenal. Compared with Pt/ZIF-8, the addition of SnOx in Pt-0.5SnOx/ZIF-8 increased the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. It is notable that NPs supported on SiO2 showed a lower selectivity than that supported on the external surface of ZIF-8, which was ascribed to the supported effect. Compared with Pt@ZIF-8 (31%) and Pt-0.5SnOx@ZIF-8 (48.5%), both the Pt/ZIF-8 (15.4%) and Pt-0.5SnOx/ZIF-8 (31.6%) showed a lower selectivity to UOL, respectively (Table S1). The TEM images indicated that the Pt and Pt-SnOx NPs were deposited on the external surface of bare ZIF-8 and these NPs of ∼2.6 nm were difficult to migrate inside ZIF-8. For Pt@ZIF-8 and Pt-0.5SnOx@ZIF-8, the TEM images of ultrathin slices indicated that Pt-SnOx NPs located inside the ZIF-8. The smaller apertures, surrounding the surface of Pt-SnOx, oriented the CO to be adsorbed on the Pt-SnOx active sites and thereby enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol. The TOFs were calculated based on the CO chemisorption, as listed in Table 2 . The hydrogenation of CC only occurred on the Pt sites, while the CO can also be hydrogenation on SnOx through H-spillover, thus the hydrogenation activities of CC (TOFCC) and CO (TOFCO) were calculated based on the selectivity. For the hydrogenation of CO, Pt/SiO2 exhibited much low TOFCO of 0.063 s−1, which was consistent with the well documented results that the Pt metal exhibits a poor intrinsic property for the selective hydrogenation of CO [1,6]. With the addition of SnOx, a much higher TOFCO (0.18–0.26 s−1) was obtained over Pt-ySnOx/SiO2. It can be inferred that new active sites different from Pt were generated for the hydrogenation of CO. The surface enriched SnOx acted an electrophilic site for the adsorption of CO, and the activated CO was further hydrogenated through H spillover. These results also indicated that the structure of Pt-ySnOx NPs in the catalysts was benefit for the synergetic effect between SnOx and Pt, leading to enhanced selectivity. For the hydrogenation of CC bond, the TOFCC based on CO uptake reflects the intrinsic properties of Pt active sites. The catalyst characterizations indicated that the SnOx was enriched on the surface of Pt. Although no obvious PtSn alloy was formed in the catalysts, electron transfer could occur from SnOx to the adjacent Pt atoms [45,46]. It has been reported that electron enriched Pt showed less hydrogenation probability of CC bond [1]. With the increasing amount of SnOx, more Pt active sites were modified by the SnOx, thus a much lower TOFCC was obtained over Pt-1.0SnO x /SiO2 (0.249 s−1) and Pt-1.5SnO x /SiO2 (0.099 s−1). The Pt/SiO2 (0.525 s−1) exhibited a much higher TOF total than Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8 (∼0.052 s−1) while the TOF CO for the hydrogenation of CO bond over these catalysts were similar. For Pt/SiO2, the hydrogenation results revealed the intrinsic properties of Pt that the CC bond was thermal dynamically favored over CO. Most of the unsaturated aldehyde were hydrogenated to saturated aldehyde with unreacted CO bond, thus the TOF C=O was much lower than TOF CC over Pt/SiO2. For Pt-SnOx@ZIF-8, the steric constriction limited the internal diffusion [1,25,26] and the total reaction activity TOF total over Pt-SnOx@ZIF-8 was lower than that over Pt/SiO2. With the steric effect constriction of ZIF-8 channels, the CC bond was prevented from interacting with metal actives while the CO bond was oriented to be adsorbed on the active sites, thus a much lower TOF CC while a similar TOF CO were obtained over Pt-SnOx@ZIF-8. With the addition of SnOx, the synergetic effect and steric effect were combined over the Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8 catalyst. The ratio of TOFCO/TOFCC was calculated in Table 2. The Pt/SiO2 only gave a low ratio of 0.13 because the hydrogenation rate of CC was much higher than that of CO. The addition of SnOx activated the CO bond and the synergetic effect between Pt and SnOx further enhanced the hydrogenation rate of CO, thus the ratio of TOFCO/TOFCC increased from 0.13 to 1.84 over the Pt-ySnOx/SiO2 catalysts. For the Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8, the ratio of TOFC=O/TOFC=C increased from 0.69 to 4.28 when the Sn/Pt ratio increase from 0 to 1.5, indicating that the hydrogenation rate of CC bond was significantly decreased by the steric constriction of ZIF-8 channels. The selectivity to UOL was plotted as a function of the Sn/Pt molar ratio (Fig. 6 ). The selectivity over both series of catalysts continuously increased with the increase of Sn/Pt ratio, in consistent with the relative activity ratio (TOFCO/TOFCC). Over the Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 catalysts, the selectivity to UOL increased from 4.3% to 21.4%, 40.8% and 61.5% when the Sn/Pt increased from 0 to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, respectively. This enhanced selectivity could be ascribed to the synergetic effect between SnOx and Pt active sites, where SnOx acted as electrophilic sites for adsorption and activation of the CO bond. With the Pt@ZIF-8 catalyst, the steric effect increased the selectivity by 26.7% compared with non-modified Pt/SiO2. Interestingly, the selectivity was further enhanced by about 20% at each Sn/Pt ratio when the Pt-SnO x particles were encapsulated inside ZIF-8. The Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8 catalysts were also used for the hydrogenation of 3-prenal. The two methyl groups of 3-prenal showed a higher hindrance effect than the ethyl group of 2-pentenal, thus 96.0% selectivity was obtained over the Pt@ZIF-8 catalyst at a similar conversion. In addition, the selectivity was further enhanced to 98.6% over the Pt-0.5SnOx@ZIF-8 catalyst. The above results indicated that the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol can be further increased by combining the synergetic and steric effects. Recycling experiments were performed to evaluate the stability of Pt-1.5SnOx@ZIF-8 catalyst (Fig. S6). For each reaction, a ∼80% selectivity to UOL was obtained and the activities were similar without significant loss. The slight decrease of activity could be ascribed to the loss of catalysts during the reusing process. The spent Pt-1.5SnOx@ZIF-8 catalyst was characterized by TEM and XRD (Fig. S7). The results indicated that ZIF-8 kept the crystallization structure and no NPs migrated to the external surface. The ultrathin slices of the spent Pt-SnOx@ZIF-8 were prepared for TEM characterization, showing that the Pt-SnOx NPs were still well dispersed inside the ZIF-8. ZIF-8 exhibits a good stability even at 300 °C under air flow [41]. The Pt-SnOx NPs encapsulated inside ZIF-8 were protected by the stable structure of ZIF-8."
8,In situ FTIR spectrum for surface reaction,"3.3 In situ FTIR spectrum for surface reaction To better understand the mechanism by which the synergetic and steric effects enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol, in situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to determine the surface adsorption modes and surface reaction pathways. The FTIR spectra of gas phase UAL and SAL were firstly collected and shown in Fig. S8. UAL and SAL spectra showed two similar features in the ranges of 2700–3000 cm−1 and 1350–1500 cm−1, which were assigned to the vibrations of ʋ(CH) in the aldehyde group and δ(CH3) in the methyl group, respectively [44,47,48]. Differently, the typical ʋ(CO) vibration of SAL molecule showed a single band centered at 1745 cm−1, while this vibration in the spectrum of UAL showed two bands at 1726 cm−1 and 1713 cm−1 due to the conjugation effect of ʋ(CC) (1646 cm−1) [44]. Then the catalyst sample was loaded into the FTIR cell followed by the injection of UAL vapor (0.1 KPa). As shown in Fig. S9, the typical ʋ(CO) vibrations of gas phase UAL (1726 cm−1 and 1713 cm−1) emerged and diminished when the FTIR cell was continuously evacuated. After the gas phase and physically absorbed UAL were removed (P < 5.0 · 10-3 Pa), a steady IR spectrum of chemically adsorbed UAL was obtained. The spectrum of UAL adsorbed on SiO2 surface exhibited bands at 1708 cm−1, 1660 cm−1, and 1619 cm−1 (Fig. S10(a)). The first two bands were ascribed to the CO frequencies of UAL coordinated on SiO2 surface, as indicated by the red-shifts from the corresponding frequencies of gaseous UAL. The band at 1619 cm−1 was assigned to the vibration of ʋ(CC) [19]. The spectrum of UAL adsorbed on ZIF-8 also showed three bands centered at 1727 cm−1, 1703 cm−1, and 1638 cm−1 (Fig. S10(b)), which were ascribed to the vibrations of ʋ1(CO), ʋ2(CO), and ʋ(CC), respectively. The corresponding bands in the spectrum of UAL on ZIF-8 showed quite different shift compared with that of UAL on SiO2. To further confirm the assignments of CC and CO vibrations of adsorbed UAL molecule in the IR spectra, SAL molecules were adsorbed on SiO2 and ZIF-8 followed by FTIR detection (Fig. S9). Compared with the spectrum of UAL, no vibrations of ʋ(CC) appeared and a strong band (SiO2: 1708 cm−1, ZIF-8: 1727 cm−1) attributed to ʋ(CO) of adsorbed SAL was observed. The typical bands of adsorbed UAL and SAL molecules are summarized in Table 3 based on the above arguments. Subsequently, in situ FTIR spectrum was used to monitor the changes of these bands during UAL hydrogenation at 353 K. In each experiment, the sample was first treated with 2-pentenal at 353 K. After the sample was fully chemisorbed with 2-pentenal molecules, the gas phase and physically adsorbed 2-pentenal were removed under continuous evacuation. Then 11.5 KPa of H2 was introduced followed by in situ FTIR detection. Blank experiments using bare SiO2 and ZIF-8 were firstly carried out under the same conditions (Fig. S11). For ZIF-8 with chemisorbed UAL, the introduction of hydrogen did not weaken or change the bands of ʋ1(CO), ʋ2(CO), and ʋ(CC). For SiO2 with chemisorbed UAL, the bands of ʋ1(CO) and ʋ(CC) kept unchanged, while the vibration of ʋ2(CO) was unusually strengthened with the reaction time and returned to its original intensity after evacuating the H2. The above results indicated that pure SiO2 and ZIF-8 were inert for the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds In situ FTIR spectra for the Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . Several changes occurred in the relative peak intensities as the spectra evolved with time on stream. For Pt/SiO2 with chemisorbed UAL (Fig. 7a), the band intensity of 1619 cm−1 ʋ(CC) gradually decreased upon the introduction of hydrogen and meanwhile the band intensity of 1708 cm−1 ʋ1(CO) increased, probably arising from the hydrogenation of CC bond corresponding to the conversion of adsorbed UAL to adsorbed SAL. The prominent band appeared at ∼2020 cm−1 in the region for CO adsorbed on Pt. The intensity of this band increased with the reaction time, which was ascribed to the decarbonylation reaction of UAL (pathway VI). Several adsorption modes were reported for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes [4,49–51], and the decarbonylation reaction occurred mainly through η4(CC, CO) adsorption mode, which required more adjacent Pt atoms for the interaction of CC and CO bonds. The irreversibly adsorbed CO poisoned the Pt active sites and the adsorbed CO could not be further hydrogenated due to the lack of active H [40,48], thus the intensity of band ʋ2(CO) only slightly decreased over the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. With the increase of Sn/Pt ratio (Fig. 7(b)–(d)), the intensity of ʋ2(CO) decreased with time on stream while that of ʋ1(CO) kept unchanged. In our previous work, we found that the SnO x species acted as adsorption sites for activation of CO bond of acrolein, and the adsorbed CO on SnO x was further hydrogenated by the activated H spilled from Pt sites [20]. In this work, the characterization results showed that the SnO x species of Pt-SnO x was located on the surface of Pt. The increased amount of SnO x species provided more sites for activation of CO, resulting in a faster decrement of ʋ2(CO) with time on stream. It has been reported that the Pt(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl species was found on small clusters and showed typical double bands at the IR range of CO linearly adsorption [43,52]. As shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c), double adsorption bands at 2035 cm−1 and 2058 cm−1 occurred on the Pt-0.5SnO x /SiO2 and Pt-1.0SnO x /SiO2 catalysts. The CO-FTIR results indicated that the increased SnO x species isolated the large ensembled Pt sites, resulting in the formation of exposed Pt cluster. Therefore, the Pt(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl species was formed during the decarbonylation reaction of UAL and presented the unique double bands in IR spectra. Differently, no obvious CO-Pt species was observed in the Pt-1.5SnO x /SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 7(d)), suggesting that the decarbonylation reaction was suppressed. These results indicated that the exposed adjacent Pt atoms were inadequate for the η4 adsorption mode at an increased amount of surface SnO x species. The intensity of ʋ(CC) over all the catalysts decreased with time on stream, but the mechanism was different. The decrease of ʋ(CC) can be ascribed to the following main reasons: the hydrogenation of CC forming adsorbed SAL (D 1), the decarbonylation reaction forming adsorbed CO (D 2), and the hydrogenation of CO adsorbed on SnO x followed by desorption of unsaturated alcohol (D 3). For Pt/SiO2 without the modification of SnO x , only D 1 and D 2 proceeded upon the introduction of H2. With the increase of Sn/Pt ratio (0.5 and 1.0), the SnO x species on the Pt surface provided new active sites for the process of D 3. For Pt-1.5SnO x /SiO2, the exposed adjacent Pt atoms became inadequate for the decarbonylation reaction and the D 1 and D 3 reactions, resulted in the decrease of ʋ(CC). The intensity of the corresponding bands over the pure ZIF-8 was about 4 times higher than that over the pure SiO2 (Fig. S11). This was because the surface area of ZIF-8 (1900 m2/g) was much higher than that of SiO2 (147 m2/g), and much more reactant molecules were adsorbed on the ZIF-8 surface. For better comparison, the spectra over Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 at 0.5 min and 70 min were compared in Fig. 8 to investigate the corresponding bands. For Pt@ZIF-8, an obvious Pt-CO species was obtained when introducing H2, indicating that decarbonylation reaction occurred (Fig. 8(a)). However, the intensity of the CO-Pt species over Pt@ZIF-8 was lower than that over Pt/SiO2, which was ascribed to inhibited η4 adsorption of UAL by steric constriction of ZIF-8 channels. Compared with Pt/SiO2 (Fig. 7(a)), an obvious decrement in ʋ2(CO) was observed over Pt@ZIF-8 (Fig. 8(a)), suggesting that the steric effect oriented the η(CO) adsorption on Pt. For the Pt-ySnOx@ZIF-8 catalysts (Fig. 8(b)–(d)), the intensity of CO-Pt species in IR spectra decreased with increasing Sn/Pt ratio and even no CO-Pt species was observed over Pt-1.5SnOx@ZIF-8, because the Pt active sites were separated by the surface covering SnOx. The intensity of CO-species over Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 (y = 0.5 and 0.1) was much lower than that over the Pt-0.5SnO x /SiO2 (y = 0.5 and 0.1). The Pt-SnO x surface in the Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts was modified by the apertures of ZIF-8, which oriented the surface adsorption of UAL molecules. Thus, the decarbonylation reaction through the η4 mode was inhibited by the stereoconfinment of apertures on the surface of Pt-SnO x particles of the Pt-ySnO x @ZIF-8 catalyst. Over the Pt-1.5SnO x @ZIF-8 catalyst (Fig. 8(d)), the intensity of CC vibration was almost unchanged and only a slight decrease of ʋ1(CO) was observed. In conjunction with the high selectivity to unsaturated alcohol over Pt-1.5SnO x @ZIF-8, it can be inferred that the combined synergetic and steric effects can effectively prevent CC from interacting with Pt active sites."
9,Discussion,"The selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was significantly enhanced in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehyde over the designed dual effect catalysts. Based on the above results, this enhancement in selectivity was ascribed to both the synergetic and steric effects, and the reaction modes in the liquid phase hydrogenation were hypothesized in Scheme 2 . For Pt/SiO2, the adequate assemble Pt atoms showed a strong linear adsorption and an obvious bridged adsorption of CO. The TEM results indicated that the Pt NPs had a mean size of 2.08 nm, which favored the η4(CC, CO) adsorption mode [53]. The adsorbed UAL through η4 mode proceeded the decarbonylation, and the produced CO formed the CO-Pt species as indicated in the IR spectra. Different from the IR surface reaction, the decarbonylation pathway did not proceed in the liquid phase hydrogenation. Thus, in the liquid phase hydrogenation reaction, UAL was adsorbed on Pt active sites through the η4 mode and the CC was hydrogenated to produce the main product of saturated aldehyde (Scheme 2a). The synergetic effect between TiOx and Pt has been demonstrated by Kennedy et al. [5] that a crotyl-oxy surface intermediate was obtained over the Pt/TiOx, which exhibited a 52% selectivity to CO bond hydrogenation. Here in, the synergetic effect between Pt and SnO x was applied in the selective hydrogenation of UAL. The characterization results showed that the SnO x species mainly covered the Pt surface and divided the large assembled Pt sites, which decreased the linear CO-Pt adsorption and vanished the bridged CO adsorption. The coverage effect of SnO x was further confirmed by in situ FTIR, where the CO-Pt species formed through the decarbonylation of UAL decreased with increasing Sn/Pt ratio. The IR spectra showed that the intensity of ʋ2(CO) decreased with time on stream over the Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 catalyst, indicating that the CO bond was activated by the SnOx. These results were consistent with the TOF values that a much higher TOFC=O was obtained over the Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 catalyst. Thus, SAL and UOL were the main products in the liquid phase hydrogenation of UAL over Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 catalysts. Based on the above discussion, it could be inferred that two reaction processes occurred over the SnO x modified Pt catalyst in the liquid phase hydrogenation (Scheme 2b): one is the adsorption of CC on Pt that results in the formation of SAL, and the other is the adsorption of CO on SnO x followed by hydrogenation with spilled hydrogen to form UOL. The steric effect was firstly reported for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, where the phenyl group showed steric hindrance for the CC adsorption in some cases [1]. This steric effect can be induced by large metal particles that exhibit flat surface. The steric repulsion of the aromatic ring hindered the parallel adsorption of the planar cinnamaldehyde molecule on a flat metal surface [54]. Ligands and porous materials were used to modify the metal active sites, which also showed steric hinderance of CC due to the interaction between phenyl group and modified metal surface [25,27]. Compared with Pt/C, the selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol was increased from 33% to 74% when Pt NPs were encapsulated in zeolite Y [24]. However, the steric effect was mostly applied in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehyde with large substituents at the CC bond, and was found ineffective for those with the small substituents [24,27]. Over the present Pt@ZIF-8 catalyst, ZIF-8 with a channel size of 0.34 nm was combined with Pt active sites for the hydrogenation of UAL. The TEM images of ultrathin slices confirmed that the Pt NPs were encapsulated into the ZIF-8 internal structure. The Pt surface was modified by the apertures of ZIF-8 and the UAL molecules were oriented by the aperture to linearly interact with Pt active sites. This steric effect increased the CO adsorption of UAL on Pt and enhanced the CO hydrogenation selectivity (Scheme 2c). It should be noted that the steric effect cannot completely prevent the η4(CC, CO) adsorption because the CO-Pt species formed in the decarbonylation reaction were detected in the IR spectra. In the liquid phase reaction, this η4 adsorption mode resulted in the formation of saturated aldehyde, thus a certain amount of SAL was also produced through the η4 mode over Pt@ZIF-8 (Scheme 2c). In fact, the steric effect cannot completely prevent the CC bond from interacting with active sites due to the defect or flexibility of the steric constriction. Thus, the selectivity of steric effect catalysts was also affected by the active metal. Pt NPs with highly intrinsic selectivity to CO hydrogenation showed a 74% selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol when encapsulated into zeolite Y, while the selectivity was only increased from 30% to 63% for Ru-Y and from 0% to 16% for Rh-Y compared with the corresponding metal supported on carbon [24,25]. In this work, Pt-SnOx NPs supported non-porous SiO2 exhibited the synergetic effect for enhancing the selectivity to CO hydrogenation. The synergetic and steric effects were further combined over the Pt-SnO x @ZIF-8 catalysts. The selectivity to unsaturated alcohol and the TOFCO/TOFCC ratio increased with increasing amount of SnOx. Compared with CC bond, the hydrogenation probability of CO was enhanced due to the addition of SnOx. The higher amount of SnOx provided more electrophilic sites for the adsorption of CO and the adsorbed CO was further hydrogenated by the H activated by adjacent Pt, resulting in the positive relationship between selectivity and Sn/Pt ratio. The decarbonylation reaction was suppressed due to the SnO x and the apertures of ZIF-8, thus no CO-species was observed in the IR spectra. These dual effects resulted in a highly selective adsorption of CO on SnOx and a high selectivity to UOL (Scheme 2d)."
10,Conclusions,"Synergetic and steric effects were applied to design highly selective catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. The surface enriched SnO x in Pt-SnO x and the encapsulation of Pt-SnO x inside ZIF-8 were confirmed by catalyst characterizations. Compared with Pt/SiO2, the surface enriched SnO x on the Pt-ySnO x /SiO2 catalyst isolated the assembled Pt atoms and suppressed the formation of CO-Pt species produced form the decarbonylation reaction in the FTIR experiments. In addition, the SnO x species acted as electrophilic sites for the adsorption and activation of the CO bond, resulting in the decrease of ʋ2(CO) vibration. Thus, the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was enhanced by the synergetic effect between SnO x and Pt active sites and showed a positive linear relationship with the Sn/Pt ratio. The channel of ZIF-8 showed steric constriction in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes by orienting the CO adsorption on the Pt active sites. The two methyl groups of 3-prenal showed a higher hindrance effect than the ethyl group of 2-pentenal and a much higher selectivity was obtained over the hydrogenation of 3-prenal. For the hydrogenation of 2-pentenal, the selective was only enhanced to 31% over the Pt@ZIF-8 but was further increased to ∼80% by encapsulating Pt-SnO x into ZIF-8. The synergetic and steric effect was combined over the Pt-SnOx@ZIF-8 to prevent the CC adsorption and inhibit the CC hydrogenation."
