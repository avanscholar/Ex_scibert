0,Introduction,"The use of photocatalysts for the transformation of solar energy to produce hydrogen is a promising method to provide a source for environmentally-friendly energy [1–3]. However, an employment of most of the existing photoelectrochemical systems developed to date in hydrogen power engineering is limited due to a number of unsolved problems such as: low efficiency of charge separation [4]; low conversion of sunlight due to inappropriate values of band gap of the used semiconductors and the morphology of their surface [5]; low mobility of photogenerated charges [6]; as well as their high cost [7]. The only possible solution to these problems is to create a complex composite multicomponent photocatalytic systems based on noble [8] and transition metals [9], as well as non-metallic elements [10]. Combination of developing progressive methods for the photocatalysts production will make it possible to obtain novel capable systems for the efficient water splitting reaction with high rates of hydrogen evolution. Utilisation of graphene can improve the efficiency of such photocatalytic systems due to its excellent optical and electrical properties, as well as high chemical stability. A number of researches [10–14] show that graphene has its own photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution under water splitting reaction, positively effects the separation of photogenerated charges due to the fast transfer of photoinduced charges, forming a strong current density under sunlight irradiation. Since the discovery of graphene, a large number of experimentations have been carried out on graphene-based nanomaterials, which can be applied in photocatalytic purposes [15–19]. Since discovery, the graphene has been synthesized by various methods, such as mechanical exfoliation from graphite [20]; chemical vapor deposition [21]; epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC [22]; chemical graphitization of graphene oxide [23]; and carbonization of biomass and waste [24]. The listed above methods make it possible to obtain graphene of a good quality (i.e. high mass percentage of graphene flakes in sample, chemically pure, with the absence of defects in the lattice structure, etc.); however, its wide practical application is limited by the high production cost. Thus, the application of bio-waste materials to produce graphene became an active developing scientific area. Although the final material obtained by carbonization and thermochemical activation of biological wastes studied under the current research is a few-layered graphene (FLG) with some defects, it possesses the optical and electrical properties, which are rather comparable with single-layered graphene. Agricultural biological waste materials with a high carbon content, such as rice husks, straw, cotton stalks, nut shells, and many others are widely used for the production of various valuable materials, including graphene. More than a billion tons of such waste is generated annually and their disposal becomes an urgent problem. Agriculture of rice produces residues (i.e. rice husks) without a sustainable disposal pathway, caused by a low biodegradability and high thermal stability. Currently, the estimated rice husk waste production in Kazakhstan is about 64 × 103 tons per year [25]. Authors [26] reveal an increase in 1.2–1.5% per year in global agricultural rice production to meet the forecasted food needs, which, in its turn, will result in an increased production of rice husk. Utilization of bio-wastes such as rice husk for the graphene production is extremely perspective in a view of the scientific, economic and environmental potential. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is widely used in electrospinning fibers due to its outstanding thermal and mechanical properties, high strength and thermal stability [27–29]. Electrospinning PAN based carbon fibers have higher surface to volume ratio, hydrophobicity and can be used as a matrix for composing different photocatalytic materials [30]. During the heat treatment of PAN fibers, the processes leading to the formation of a low-defect carbon structure are easier in comparison with other polymer fibers. This advantage is caused by the following reasons: 1) for the implementation of the calcination process of PAN fibers, the destruction of the main polymer chain is not required; 2) along the PAN macromolecule chain, hydrogen atoms are located, which, during the dehydrogenation reaction (especially in the presence of oxygen), form regions with a polyconjugated structure, serving as the nuclei for a carbon structure; 3) the regular arrangement of nitrile groups promotes their polymerization with the formation of six-membered condensed heterocycles with a heteroaromatic polyconjugated structure [31]. Taking in account that SrTiO3 is one of the most efficient perovskite-type photocatalyst [32], the formation of a composite photocatalytic system combining the SrTiO3 and graphene is of a great interest for determining the impact of its structural features and properties on its photocatalytic activity in solar-induced hydrogen production. It is expected that the graphene utilisation will not only enhance the efficient separation and transfer of photoinduced charges, but also is able to provide a high conversion efficiency of sunlight due to its unique optical properties. In this research, the photocatalytic activities of composites based on synthesized SrTiO3 and bio-waste-derived FLGs and commercial graphene oxide (GO) were investigated. The choice of SrTiO3 and graphene is based on intrinsic photocatalytic activities in splitting of water under the sunlight irradiation of both materials separately, and the expected enhance of the photocatalytic activity of composite SrTiO3/PAN/FLG, resulting in increase of yield of hydrogen. Composite SrTiO3/PAN/FLG photocatalyst was obtained by the electrospinning, which is one of the simplest and effective method for obtaining 1D micro- and nanofibers based on polymers, inorganic materials and their composites with diameters ranging from tens of nanometers to several micrometers [33–35]. In particular, compared to 1D materials synthesized by other methods, micro- and nano-fibers obtained by the electrospinning have higher specific surface areas, a higher aspect ratio and developed porous structure, which favourably affect its photocatalytic activity, resulting in increase of effectiveness of hydrogen release under the influence of sunlight."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2, ≥ 98%), titanium oxide (TiO2, particle sizes d10 = 0.27 μm, d50 = 0.35 μm, d90 = 0.48 μm, 98%), oxalic acid ((COOH)2·2H2O, > 99.5%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, ≥ 85%), polyacrylonitrile (PAN, average M.W. 1,300,000, 98%), methanol (CH3OH, ≥99.6%) and ethanol (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Commercial GO (purity of 99%, thickness 0.7–1.2 nm and particle size < 450 nm) was purchased in Cheaptubes.com. Argon (99.993%) was purchased in Ikhsan Gas. Ultrapure deionised water (DI) was used throughout experiments, unless otherwise noted. All reagents were used without further purification."
3,SrTiO3 synthesis,"2.2 SrTiO3 synthesis The SrTiO3 powder (particle size in the range 150–350 nm) synthesis is described in details in [33]. Briefly, SrTiO3 was synthesized by chemical precipitation from the TiO2 and Sr(NO3)2 aqueous solution, and its thermal heating at the temperature of 1100 °C for 1 h in air. The molar ratio of TiO2 and Sr(NO3)2 in the solution was 1:1, resulting in obtaining homogeneous particles with less impurities."
4,Synthesis of bio-waste-derived FLG,"2.3 Synthesis of bio-waste-derived FLG Rice husk (RH, purchased from Kyzylorda Region, Kazakhstan) and walnut shells (WS, purchased from Turkistan Region, Kazakhstan) were served as the precursors for preparation of FLGs (Fig. 1 ). All purchased bio-waste materials were pre-purified via wash with DI, and consequently air dried in the laboratory fume hood and then in a bench oven (Loip LF-25/350-GG1) for 8 h at 105 °C. KOH was used as a chemical activator and thermal treatment was conducted under argon to prevent materials from oxidation. As shown in Fig. 1, pre-purified RH or WS were grounded in an impact mill to a particle size of 1–5 mm. The grounded materials were then carbonized at a temperature of 500 °C for 100 min with a heating rate of 7.5 °C/min in an argon medium (the flow rate of argon was 160 sccm), exactly as described previously [36]. For the thermochemical activation, carbonized samples RH or WS were mixed with KOH powder and heated to a temperature of 150 °C for 5 h in air to ensure complete impregnation of carbonizates with the molten KOH. The mass ratio of carbonized specimen to KOH was 1:4. Then, thermochemical activation was carried out under the following conditions: the argon flow rate ~250 sccm; activation temperature – 800 °C; activation time − 60–90 min. Resulting samples were washed with hot distilled water until pH ~ 6–7 in order to remove the alkaline residue and dried in two stages: at 120 °C for 12 h in air and at 150 °C for 2 h in a vacuum drying oven (vacuum level 10–3 Torr)."
5,Electrospinning of 1D SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composite,"2.4 Electrospinning of 1D SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composite Fig. 2 shows the experimental approach used for the formation of 1D fibrous composites. In each preparation 0.5 g of PAN was dissolved in ethanol and 0.1 g of SrTiO3 was added to the PAN solution under continuous stirring. Then a 0.015 g of graphene-based material (x-FLG, where x-indicates the type of used graphene (RH-FLG or WS-FLG) and commercial GO) was added to the PAN/SrTiO3 mixture and stirred for 30 min in order to ensure the homogeneous distribution of GO within the volume. Derived precursor solution was then placed into the syringe for electrospinning formation of 1D micro and nano-sized composite fibers. Obtained photocatalysts were designated as SrTiO3/PAN/RH-FLG, SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG and SrTiO3/PAN/rGO depending on the type of graphene’s origin. Electrospinned samples of the SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composite photocatalyst were calcined in two stages: firstly, stabilized at 185 °C for 30 min and then pyrolized at 500 °C for 30 min in an oxygen-containing environment. The calcined samples were designated as c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG."
6,Characterization of the obtained samples,"2.5 Characterization of the obtained samples Thermal analysis was conducted using a Perkin Elmer STA 6000 with a heating rate 20 °C∙min−1 in a temperature range from 50 to 800 °C in a purge nitrogen flow (flow rate = 20 ml min−1). The morphology and elemental composition of the as-obtained SrTiO3 photocatalyst and composite fibers was examined using the SEM images obtained with the Quanta 3D 200i (FEI, USA, accelerating voltage of 15 kV) microscope equipped with Oxford instrument X-sight EDX system. The intrinsic structural features were studied with the transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). XRD spectra were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Drone-8, LOMO) using CuKa radiation (k = 0.15418 nm). Raman spectroscopy investigation was performed on the Raman spectrometerNTEGRA SPECTRA™ (NT-MDT Spectrum) equipped with a solid-state laser, which produced an excitation wavelength of 473 nm. Data of specific surface area (Ssp), cumulative pore volume (Vp), their diameter (Dp) and pore-size distribution for obtained samples were calculated from their isotherms of low temperature N2 adsorption–desorption recorded using the Sorbtometr-M and Micromeritics (ASAP 2400V3.07) apparatus’. Optical transmittance of graphene-based samples was measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer with three detectors: a photomultiplier for operating in the UV and visible spectral regions, semiconductor InGaAs, and cooled PbS detectors for operating in the near-infrared range in a wide spectral region from ultraviolet (185 nm) to near infrared radiation (3600 nm). The calculations of the energy of the bandgaps were carried out in accordance with the method of analyzing the absorption and transmission spectra of light described in [37]. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer at 345 nm wavelength. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using a Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Corrtest-CS350, controlled by CS studio Software package) in the frequency range 0.001–104 Hz under UV light."
7,Investigation of photocatalytic activity,"2.6 Investigation of photocatalytic activity Samples of SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG photocatalyst (1 g) were dispersed in 20 ml of water-alcohol mixture (15% methanol) and stirred for 30 min. The photocatalytic water splitting was carried out under a 120 W ultraviolet lamp (λ = 254 nm) in a quartz tube reactor (d = 40 mm), the system was previously purged with argon to avoid the presence of air, and the photocatalytic activity was analyzed by calculating the rate of H2 evolution in course of splitting the water-alcohol mixture. The compositions of the released gas mixture was identified by gas chromatography using Chromos 1000 chromatograph (CHROMOS Engineering) with three packed 3 mm columns filled with NaX and PORAPAK Q phases, allowing to identify the main outcoming gases."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of bio-waste derived FLGs,"3.1 Characterization of bio-waste derived FLGs The TG curves (Fig. 3 ) for an initial RH and WS show, that the course of pyrolysis can be divided into 3 main stages: I – relates to the weight loss due to moisture evaporation (50–200 °C); II – corresponds to a rapid thermal transformation of the main components – cellulose, hemicelluloses and part of lignin (200–500 °C), accompanied by release of gaseous products, resulting in high value of weight loss of materials and their rapid decomposition in this range of temperature; the III stage is high-temperature residue charring, in which the mass loss is slower. The main part of lignin is pyrolized in the II stage of pyrolysis (about 500 °C), resulting in formation of the solid residue with low weight loss. The carbonization process in bulk for both the RH and WS was carried out in the interval of 30–120 min accompanied by measuring the carbonization time and mass loss of the sample. The main mass loss for both bio-waste GO precursors occurs within 70–90 min, therefore 90 min time interval was identified as the most optimal. Increasing the carbonization time over 90 min is impractical, since the change in mass is insignificant, which indicates the end of the process. The non-carbon elements of the initial RH and WS, such as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, are removed in the form of volatile gaseous products and the mass yields of carbonized RH and WS were 27.6% and 30.3%, correspondingly. All along the carbonization process the existing carbon atoms are arranged randomly in aromatic sheets and a free space leads to the pore formation in the graphene structure. Calculated Ssp for carbonized RH and WS before activation are 350 m2 g−1 and 270 m2 g−1, respectively. To increase the specific surface area and obtain FLGs in the carbonaceous composition, carbonized RH and WS were subjected to an activation process. Activation expands existing pores, burning off the walls between adjacent pores and removing the disordered carbon that blocks the pores in carbonized RH and WS. The mass yields of FLG from RH and WS were 11.7% and 24.2% from the initial mass of the bio-wastes, respectively. According to isotherms of N2 adsorption and desorption and BET analysis, the Ssp of FLG obtained from RH is 3200 m2 g−1, the Vp is 1.8 cm3 g−1, and the average Dp is 3.05 nm; for FLG obtained from WS Ssp is 2760 m2 g−1, Vp − 1.49 cm3 g−1, average Dp − 2.9 nm. The measures specific surface areas of FLGs reported here are higer than that for existing graphene based materials, such as sheet of graphene (theoretical) – 2630 m2g−1 [38], KOH activated GO – 705 m2g−1 [39], thermally expanded GO – 925 m2g−1 [40], coconut shell derived sheet-like graphitic carbon – 1874 m2g−1 [41] and peanut shell derived FLG – 2070 m2g−1 [42]; however, have values of the same order of magnitude of the microwave exfoliated graphene with subsequent KOH chemical activation – 3100 m2g−1 [43]. Obtained RH-FLG and WS-FLG are presented by mesoporous structure (Fig. 4 b). The Raman investigation indicates the presence of graphene in the structures of the samples obtained from bio-waste materials RH and WS (Fig. 4 a). Both RH-FLG and WS-FLG samples are characterized by inhomogeneities, representing a two-component material, mainly consisting of graphene and amorphous carbon. The presence of graphene in the structure for RH-FLG samples is confirmed by three peaks: D at 1357 cm−1, G at 1573 cm−1 and 2D at 2712 cm−1, while for WS-FLG these peaks have the following values: D at 1357 cm−1, G at 1573 cm−1 and 2D at 2701 cm−1. Both spectra exhibit relatively similar graphene-like structure characterized by two principle bands labelled as the G and 2D. The third band, the D band, appeared in both spectra, indicates the presence of defects within the carbon lattice. Analysis of the Raman spectra of the RH-FLG and WS-FLG samples indicates the presence of 5 or more graphene layers in the structure. To determine the number of layers, a method based on the analysis of the intensity ratios of the 2D to G peaks in the Raman spectra was used, according to which, for the RH and WS graphene, these ratios (I2D/IG) are equal to 0.49 and 0.54, respectively, indicating that, to a greater extent, the formed structure consists of FLG. Results of Raman investigations of graphene-containing carbonaceous materials are in full correspondence with [44]. SEM images of thermo-chemically activated RH and WS are presented in Fig. 5 . The carbonaceous materials developed from RH are representing a complex characteristic macrostructure and surface texture. The pore diameters after the thermo-chemical activation are in the range from 4 to 14 μm (Fig. 5 a, b). The carbonaceous materials developed from WS are presented by highly structured hierarchy of macropores (d ≈ 2–20 μm) (Fig. 5 c, d). After the thermo-chemical activation, both (RH and WS) samples structures become less dense and graphene flake structures are clearly visible, as previously demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy. Dispart in structures of carbonaceous materials can be explained by the difference in the nature of the initial plant material. To confirm the flake-like structure of samples after thermo-chemical activation, disclosed with the SEM analysis, the TEM images were captured (Fig. 6 a, b) and analyzed. TEM images of thermo-chemically activated RH and WS resemble the graphene flake-like structures. TEM images of WS-activated sample (Fig. 6 a) represents the extended sheet-like structure with minimal number of wrinkles, whereas RH-activated samples (Fig. 6 b) consist of edged layers with defected and corrugated structures of graphene. The TEM micrographs along with Raman spectra and SEMs confirm the formation of FLG structure after thermo-chemical activation of the bio-waste precursors."
10,Characterization of 1D SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composite photocatalysts,"3.2 Characterization of 1D SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composite photocatalysts As described above, the preparation of SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG photocatalysts is a three-stage process: formation of bio-waste-derived FLGs, the SrTiO3 synthesis, and a production of the SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composite photocatalyst by electrospinning. Synthesis of perovskite SrTiO3 powder and investigation of its physico-chemical properties and morphological features are described in [45]. In our previously published work [33] we have reproduced the method of SrTiO3 powder obtaining by [45] and used the obtained material as photocatalytic additive to 1D aligned nanofibers for photocatalytic hydrogen production. SrTiO3 powder used in the current work was analysed by SEM and XRD analysis (Fig. 7 a, b). Fig. 7 a shows that for SrTiO3 the peaks at 22.77°, 32.41°, 39.99°, 46.49°, 57.81°, 67.86°, and 77.17° are observed, which are characteristic for perovskite-type SrTiO3 (JCPDS: 35-0734) with lattice constant a = 3.90 Å, which are spherical particles with an average size of 300 nm (Fig. 7 b). SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG photocatalytic systems were attained from PAN solution with as-obtained SrTiO3 and various types of graphene via electrospinning method to facilitate fibers fabrication with desired diameters. The PAN solution was used as the binding agent to combine and re-distribute the composite components homogeneously as well as a polymer-forerunner for the production of strong heat-resistant fibers. Electrospinning of the fibers was performed out at a room temperature and voltage value of 16 kV with a syringe pump feed rate of 1.5 ml h−1. The distance between collector and nozzle of needle was 15 cm. Aluminium foil circle (d = 20 cm) was applied as a collector. The SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG fibers obtained by means of electrospinning were analysed by the SEM technique (Fig. 8 ). As-formed fibers of SrTiO3/PAN (Fig. 8 a) and with additions of synthesized RH-FLG, WS-FLG and a commercial GO (Fig. 8 b-d) are presented by cylinder-type continuous shape with no visible defects and a random arrangement. Fibers structure is presented by bundles, which contact each other creating a 3D polymer chain [46,47]. The components ratio for electrospinning solutions is selected in such a way that agglomerates of SrTiO3 and graphene particles are evenly distributed along all fibers and does not lead to fibre structural disruption (Fig. 8 a, b, c, and d). The value of diameter of the resulting fibers is proportional to electrospinning precursor viscosity, as well as the value of a relatively high voltage and was estimated to be in the range from 200 up to 400 nm. The introduction of graphene does not affect the thickness of the forming fibers. The increase of the precursor viscosity by adding particles is balanced by improvement its electroconductivity, which enhances the charge density of the electrospun jet, resulting in stretching fibers with smaller diameters. As-prepared SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG fibers were calcined which optimizes the pseudo-crystalline structure, and a high degree of curing for used polymer [48]. The two-stage calcination (stabilization and pyrolysis) ensures the thermal transformation the polymer fibre structure into the carbon without melting, and with minimal structural damage, as well as with their minimum shrinkage. Thermal stabilization of fibers was performed at 180 °C in oxygen environment. At this stage, the structure is formed in the initial solid phase, accompanied by volumetric changes. At the stage of calcination, the samples are heated to a temperature of 500 °C in air for 30 min, which leads to oxidative dehydrogenation with the formation of chromophore conjugated bonds –C=N causing an intense coloration of PAN in orange-brown and further in black colours [49]. According to the EDX analyses of the c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG sample (Supplementary, Fig. 1.S1.), the majority of sample is presented by carbon, which forms via fibers carbonization and the FLG addition; the other elements: strontium, titanium and oxygen were introduced in the course of composite formation, confirming the presence of SrTiO3 in the structure. X-ray diffraction patterns for RH-FLG and WS-FLG samples (Fig. 9 a) contains a broad characteristic diffraction band of graphene (001) at 2θ 25.946° and 2θ 25.876° for RH-FLG and WS-FLG, correspondingly. The calculated interlayer distance of FLGs is close to the theoretic value of the distance of graphene nanosheets and greater than that of graphite [50]. It can be concluded from the broadening of the peaks, that the packing of graphene is not well ordered. The faint (002) and (001) peaks seen in the graphs indicate the absence of a regularly stacked graphite structure. The XRD spectra for c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composites (Fig. 9 b) show high intensity diffraction peaks at 31.62°, 39.22°, 45.69°, 57°, 67° and 76.33°, which confirm the presence of the cubic perovskite phase of SrTiO3 (JCPDS: 35-0734). At the same time, the characteristic peaks of graphene are not observed for these samples, in view of the high intensity of the perovskite characteristic bands."
11,Photocatalytic performance and overall water splitting activity of the obtained composite photocatalysts,"3.3 Photocatalytic performance and overall water splitting activity of the obtained composite photocatalysts The absorption of light in the range from 200 to 700 nm (Fig. 10 a, b) for all synthesised and carbonized samples indicates the photocatalytic capacity of the obtained c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composites. An introduction of RH-FLG, WS-FLG and GO led to an increase in the light absorption capacity compared to 1D photocatalytic system based on a pure SrTiO3/PAN, especially in the visible spectrum. This proves the influence of the optical properties of graphene on the ability to absorb light of the entire composite photocatalytic system. From Fig. 10 a, it can be seen that the obtained under current research RH-FLG and WS-FLG do not have a significant difference in photoabsorption, when compared with commercial GO, confirming that the presence of defects in the structures of the graphene samples synthesized from bio-wastes does not significantly affect their optical properties. To establish the bandgap (Eg), the dependence of coefficient of the absorption on the energy of the falling radiation was constructed and a linear approximation was performed. The determined energy of the bandgaps for each composite photocatalytic system are the following: c-SrTiO3/PAN/RH-FLG − 2.89 eV; c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG − 2.72 eV; c-SrTiO3/PAN/rGO − 2.6 eV; and for c-SrTiO3/PAN − 3.12 eV (Fig. 10 b). Efficiency of the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes was, the PL spectra of c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG composites were collected. Spectra (Fig. 11 a) s show a dominant emission peak at ~ 388 nm for all samples. Higher intensity in the photoluminescence for c-SrTiO3/PAN (Fig. 11 a (1)) indicates a higher probability of recombination of electrons and holes under the light absorption [51]. The conjugation of carbonized products to SrTiO3/PAN composite leads to significant quenching of the PL emission, with maximal extent for c-SrTiO3/PAN/rGO sample (Fig. 11 a (4)). The evolution of the microstructure and charge-transfer properties within the photocatalytic systems was analysed with EIS measurements. Fig. 11 b show the Nyquist plots (imaginary part of impedanceZ′′ versusthe real partZ′), with the carbonaceous content is dominated by a typical semicircle (in the high-frequency regime) and linear tail (in the low-frequency regime) implying a mixed kinetic and charge-transfer mechanisms. The diameter of the semicircles of the graphene-containing composites are less than that of c-SrTiO3/PAN, indicating that graphene in c-SrTiO3/PAN/RH-FLG, c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG and for c-SrTiO3/PAN/rGO accelerates the electron transfer. The interfacial resistance of photoinduced charge transfer for c-SrTiO3/PAN is much higher than that for c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG samples. Thus, conducted investigations demonstrate that photocatalysts with additions of RH-FLG, WH-FLG, and rGO are characterized by a high separation efficiency of electrons and holes, which, in its turn, affects their recombination. The performed research have shown that for the samples c-SrTiO3/PAN/RH-FLG and c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG, a more efficient separation and a higher transfer efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs are observed compared to c-SrTiO3/PAN, however, it is still lower than that for c-SrTiO3/PAN/rGO sample. The graphs of the dependency of the rate of hydrogen release on the irradiation time for the obtained c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG samples are presented in Fig. 12 (a, b). The maximum hydrogen evolution rates for c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG, c-SrTiO3/PAN/RH-FLG, c-SrTiO3/PAN/rGO and c-SrTiO3/PAN photocatalytic systems after 24 h of irradiation are 129, 122.5, 170 and 21 mmol g−1, correspondingly (Fig. 12 a). Profiles of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution are similar in character (Fig. 12 a and b), and the hydrogen evolution rate curves reaches a “plateau” at about of 10th hour of experiment, and the oxygen ones at 12-14th, depending on a sample. The oxygen evolution curves plateaus at time values that are considerably greater than for hydrogen’s. Overall, the amount of oxygen evolved for all samples under the investigation (Fig. 12 b, 1–4) was lower than expected on a basis of hydrogen evolution, probably due to the often confront obstacles in oxygen evolution in photocatalytic water splitting [52] and also because produced oxygen was partial retained and re-aerated the reaction mixture. Although, the efficiency of a hydrogen evolution is higher for sample with the commercial GO (Fig. 12 a, 1) when compared to synthesised RH-based graphene (Fig. 12 a, 3), the bio-waste-derived c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG (Fig. 12 a, 2) photocatalyst composite had relatively higher hydrogen yield and still rather comparable to other efficient photocatalytic systems (Table 1 ) [53–62]. Relatively high values of hydrogen evolution obtained in this research when compared with existing analogues indicate the positive effect of defective bio-waste-derived FLGs on charge separation during irradiation due to the fast transfer of photoinduced charges, which forms a strong current density when photocatalyst is exposed under UV radiation. Along with the fact that FLGs in the one-dimensional structure of the photocatalytic system affect the efficiency of separation of electrons and holes, the outstanding optical properties allow to utilize FLGs as an efficient light collector. So in [11], it is reported that a photocatalyst modified with graphene leads to a significant improvement in the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under the influence of sunlight, due to the effective absorption of sunlight. Bio-waste-derived c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG one-dimensional photocatalytic systems have several advantages for the design and construction of an efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production system. The proposed mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting by synthesized c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG samples (Fig. 13 ) with subsequent hydrogen evolution is as follows: firstly, due to the high specific surface area of the fibers and the optical properties of graphene, the efficiency of light absorption is significantly increased due to multiple reflection and scattering of photons interacting with the photocatalyst; secondly, obtaining a complex composite structure allows transferring the edges of the conduction and valence bands, which leads to an increase in the potential of reducing of hydrogen and oxidizing the oxygen; third, bio-waste-derived c-SrTiO3/PAN/x-FLG photocatalysts are characterized by efficient separation of photoinduced charges and a significant effect on UV absorption. Today’s photocatalytic production of hydrogen has several unsolved problems: weak stability, inadequate effectiveness of hydrogen evolution during water splitting, and high cost of materials applied as photocatalysts. Utilisation of photocatalytic systems based on bio-waste-derived FLGs and synthesized SrTiO3 will not only increase the effectiveness of hydrogen production, but also significantly reduce its cost due to the use of bio-waste materials. The obtained experimental results once again proved that the use of different nanomaterials leads to a notable change in the properties of the photocatalytic system, which has a beneficial impact on the efficiency of hydrogen production during the reaction of photocatalytic water splitting."
12,Conclusion,"In summary, we have shown, for a first time the synthesis of composite photocatalytic system based on bio-waste-derived FLGs and synthesized SrTiO3, which shows enhanced water splitting photocatalytic performance, compared to initial SrTiO3/PAN; and appropriately comparable with other similar systems reported earlier. The catalyst itself is a carbonised composite of PAN filled with FLG/GO and SrTiO3. The bio-waste-derived c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG photocatalyst is rather comparable to the same filled with commercial GO. The bandgap values for c-SrTiO3/PAN/RH-FLG, c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG, c-SrTiO3/PAN/rGO and c-SrTiO3/PAN are determined as 2.89, 2.72, 2.6 and 3.12 eV, respectively. It was experimentally found that the rate of release of hydrogen from photocatalytic splitting water-alcohol mixture for c-SrTiO3/PAN/WS-FLG is 129 mmol g−1, for c-SrTiO3/PAN/RH-FLG − 122.5 mmol g−1, for c-SrTiO3/PAN/rGO − 170 mmol g−1 and for c-SrTiO3/PAN without addition of graphene − 21 mmol g−1. Despite the fact that the obtained characterization data indicate the presence of defects in the structure of the synthesized FLGs, they possess the optical and electrical properties comparable to pure graphene, due to which their additions to c-SrTiO3/PAN photocatalyst made it possible to increase the efficiency of hydrogen evolution. The results presented in this work indicate the possible promising application of a new strategy for obtaining effective photocatalytic systems based on bio-waste-derived FLGs for the obtaining of hydrogen via photocatalytic decomposition of water mixtures."
