0,Introduction,"The most commonly used materials for food packaging are synthetic, petrochemical-based plastics such as polyolefins, polyesters or polyamides. They are accessible at low cost in large amounts and have good properties such as tensile, tear strength, barrier to gases and aroma compounds as well as heat sealability (Tharanathan, 2003). Although the applications have grown rapidly in the last decades, petrochemical plastics are non-biodegradable. This is a serious problem mainly due to accumulation in landfills and environment (Giuggioli, Girgenti, Briano, & Peano, 2017). Nowadays consumers demand alternatives addressing the plastic accumulation. Biopolymers as a raw material to reduce environmental problems associated with food packaging have been studied. Biopolymeric materials are based on renewable and biodegradable natural compounds from abundant sources (Cazón, Velazquez, Ramírez, & Vázquez, 2017). Furthermore, these materials could provide acceptable barrier to moisture, oxygen and solute movement when applied as films or coatings (Bourtoom, 2008). Materials used from renewable natural sources to produce films are mainly polysaccharides, lipids, proteins, and their combinations. Some additives can be used to improve film properties. In general, raw materials used to obtain films are inexpensive and several are by-products or wastes (Cazón et al., 2017). Cellulose is the most profuse biopolymeric resource. It is low-cost, available, non-toxic, renewable, biocompatible, biodegradable and chemically stable. Worldwide, vegetables produce over tens of billions of tons of cellulose per year, making cellulose the largest organic carbon reservoir. Cellulose is also synthesized by tunicates and microorganisms. Therefore cellulose is considered an almost unlimited source of raw material for the increasing demand of biocompatible and environmentally friendly food packaging (Wang, Lu, & Zhang, 2016; Xu, Chen, Rosswurm, Yao, & Janaswamy, 2016). Cellulose is a linear chain ((C6H10O5)n). The number of repeated units per chain depends on the source (Wang et al., 2016). Cellulose is not soluble in usual solvents due to the inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds and partially crystalline structure, restricting hypothetical applications. For this reason, previous research in literature has focused mainly on developing and characterizing films from soluble cellulose derivatives in water (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and methylcellulose) and organic solvents (ethyl cellulose) or films based on other biopolymers using cellulose particles (nanocrystals, whiskers, fiber, etc.) as a reinforcing agent (Ma, Hu, & Wang, 2016; Roohani et al., 2008; Wahyuningsih, Iriani, & Fahma, 2016). Recently, several techniques have been studied to dissolve cellulose avoiding the chemical processes to obtain cellulose derivatives. Reported solvents include ionic liquids, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide, NaOH aqueous solution alone or mixed with urea or thiourea, tetrabutylammonium fluoride/dimethyl sulfoxide system, molten inorganic salt hydrates and other more complex solutions like aqueous metal solutions composed of transition metal ions and nitrous ligands including cuprammonium hydroxide (Isik, Sardon, & Mecerreyes, 2014; Lindman, Karlström, & Stigsson, 2010; Wang et al., 2016). The NaOH/Urea system is less toxic and less expensive and it has been considered as an environmental friendly method to rapidly dissolve cellulose (Morgado, Frollini, Castellan, Rosa, & Coma, 2011; Sun, Chen, Jiang, & Lynch, 2015). An example of commercial regenerated cellulose is cellophane which is a transparent, durable and flexible film. Besides, cellophane manufacture and post-treatment process certainly generates hazardous by-products (CS2 and H2S), resulting in serious pollution problems. Therefore, other cellulose solvent systems have been developed to prepare regenerated cellulose films (Bedane, Eić, Farmahini-Farahani, & Xiao, 2015; Yang, Fukuzumi, Saito, Isogai, & Zhang, 2011). On the other hand, biodegradable films based on cellulose still possess some drawbacks including low mechanical and barrier properties (Almeida, Frollini, Castellan, & Coma, 2010). A feasible strategy for improving the film properties could be the combination of cellulose with other biopolymers or the addition of plasticizers which allows maintaining the biodegradability while improving the film properties. Addition of a plasticizer like glycerol can reduce brittleness and increase flexibility. Plasticizers may also be responsible for a change in the barrier properties of the film, usually increasing the water vapor permeability (Shivakumara & Demappa, 2016). The combination of regenerated cellulose with glycerol to improve mechanical properties was studied (Xiao, Zhang, Zhang, Lu, & Zhang, 2003a). In that study, the cellulose-based films were soaked in a glycerol bath. Glycerol could be added directly to cellulose solution to promote the interactions between cellulose and the plasticizer. To our knowledge, the addition of glycerol to dissolved cellulose before regeneration had not been studied. Other copolymer for cellulose is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a biodegradable, semicrystalline polymer extensively studied in combination with other biopolymers, such as gelatine, chitosan or starch, among others (Bonilla, Fortunati, Atarés, Chiralt, & Kenny, 2014; Silva et al., 2008; Tang & Alavi, 2011). However, the effect of PVA in combination with cellulose regenerated following the NaOH solvent method, has not been sufficiently studied. The interaction between cellulose and PVA can be affected by the presence of other components in the film, such as glycerol. In previous studies from our group, the effect of the interaction of regenerated cellulose with PVA in presence of chitosan on the film properties, was analysed (Cazón, Vázquez, & Velazquez, 2018c; 2018b). PVA is suitable for combining with cellulose to improve the physical, thermal and barrier properties due to its high polar character, good mechanical properties and processability (Frone, Nicolae, Gabor, & Panaitescu, 2015; Wahyuningsih et al., 2016). Mechanical properties of films are critical as an adequate mechanical strength and integrity is expected throughout transportation, handling and storage of packaged foods (Rouhi, Razavi, & Mousavi, 2017). Mechanical properties like the tensile strength (TS) and percentage of elongation at break (%E) depend on the film composition, the nature of components, the testing condition and preparation of the sample (Vieira, Da Silva, Dos Santos, & Beppu, 2011). Evaluation of these properties allows foreseeing the performance of the films under processing conditions, comparing it with synthetic polymers. The barrier properties to gases, water vapour, ultraviolet (UV) radiation of a polymeric film are critical for estimating the shelf-life when used as food packaging. Generally, plastics are relatively permeable to small molecules such as gases, water vapour, organic vapours or liquids. Water vapour is one of the main permeates studied in food packaging applications. It may transfer from the internal or external environment through the polymer wall, resulting in a continuous change in product quality and decreasing shelf-life (Siracusa, Rocculi, Romani, & Rosa, 2008). Ultraviolet radiation is involved in lipids oxidation. This oxidation decreases the self-life, due to the loss of organoleptic quality of the packaged food. For this reason, reinforcing the biodegradable films with UV-protective components is a feasible alternative to prevent oxidation. Also, it is important to use natural substances as UV protective components to maintain the biodegradability of the film (Guo, Ge, Li, Mu, & Li, 2014). Besides, the raw material used to develop new films, must have adequate optical properties as transparency (Imran et al., 2012). Considering the scarce reports on cellulose-PVA-glycerol films, the hypothesis of this study was that polyvinyl alcohol and glycerol improve TS and %E and barrier (water vapour permeability, light barrier, transparency) properties of films from regenerated cellulose. Previous studies from our group reported the effect on water adsorption and other mechanical properties (burst strength and distance to burst) (Cazón, Vázquez, & Velazquez, 2018a). Glycerol was directly added to the cellulose solution to promote the cellulose-glycerol interactions. Polynomial models were used to assess the effect of the film formulation on the mechanical properties and water vapour permeability. Structure and thermal properties were also studied."
1,Materials and methods,"Microcrystalline cellulose extra pure (average particle size 90 μm), urea (99.5%), sodium hydroxide (98%), extra pure anhydrous sodium bromide (99%) and acetic acid (99.5%) were purchased from Acros organics (Geel, Belgium). Full-hydrolyzed (>98%) polyvinyl alcohol with average molecular weight (Mw) of 30,000 g/mol and ester value of 12–25 was supplied by Merck (Billerica, MA, US). Glycerol was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, US)."
2,Preparation of films,"2.1 Preparation of films Films were elaborated following the methodology explained elsewhere (Cazón et al., 2018a). The NaOH/urea method was used for dissolving cellulose. The overall preparation process is shown in Fig. 1 . Cellulose solubility increases at temperature below −12 °C. Under these conditions, a clear cellulose solution was obtained (Qi, Chang, & Zhang, 2008). An aqueous solution containing NaOH/urea/H2O (7:14:79, w/w) was used as a solvent for cellulose. This ratio of NaOH/urea/H2O was established after carrying out different tests until to get a clear solution. The solvent used for each batch was a mixture of 450 g of H2O, 39.9 g of NaOH and 79.7 g of urea. Films thickness (mm) was measured prior to other tests using a Thickness Meter ET115S (Etari GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). The measuring was carried out at 5 locations and mean values were reported."
3,Mechanical properties analysis,"2.2 Mechanical properties analysis A texturometer (TA-XTplus, Stable Micro System, UK) was used to assess the mechanical properties. TS and % E were measured following the standard method D-882 (ASTM). An initial grip separation of 40 mm and a crosshead speed of 4 mm/s were set up. Ten samples of 15 × 100 mm were cut from each film formulation and stored for 5 days in desiccators containing supersaturated salt solution of sodium bromide. Both ends of the films were fixed in the grips, as shown in Fig. 2 , and the strength during extension was measured. TS is the maximum stress needed to break the film. It represents the resistance to elongation (Spotti, Cecchini, Spotti, & Carrara, 2016). TS was calculated using Equation (1) (Antoniou, Liu, Majeed, & Zhong, 2015). (1) T S = F L · x Where TS is tensile strength (MPa), F is tensile force (N), L is the width of the film (mm) and x is the thickness (mm). Percentage of elongation at break (%E) is the maximum elongation of the film before rupture (Miller & Krochta, 1997), calculated using Equation (2) (Antoniou et al., 2015). (2) % E = l − l 1 l 1 · 100 Where l 1 is the initial length (mm) and l is the length of the film (mm) at the breaking point."
4,Water vapour permeability,"2.3 Water vapour permeability Water vapour barrier can be quantified as water vapour permeability (WVP), which indicates the flux of water that permeates per unit of area and time (g/s m Pa) considering the pressure differential and thickness of the material. WVP values were obtained gravimetrically following the ASTM method E96 (https://www.astm.org/Standards/E96.htm). A wide-mouth cup (5·10−3 m2 area) was filled with distilled water. The film was sealed on the wide mouth, weighed and placed at 20 °C inside a desiccator with silica gel. The driving force of water vapour transport is the gradient of partial pressure in both sides of the film. Weight of the cup was recorded during 5 days to the nearest 1·10−4 g and plotted as a function of time (Gennadios, Weller, & Gooding, 1994). The slope was evaluated by linear regression (r2 > 0.99). WVP was calculated according to the combined Fick and Henry laws for gas diffusion through films, using Equation (3). (3) W V P = Δ w · x Δ t · A · Δ P Where Δw/Δt (g/s) is the weight loss of the cell per unit of time, x (m) is the film thickness, A (m2) is the exposed area and ΔP (Pa) is the vapour pressure differential calculated as 2339 Pa for this study because it is the saturation vapor pressure of pure water at 20 °C (Khan et al., 2010). Each test was performed by triplicate."
5,"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), light barrier properties and transparency","2.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), light barrier properties and transparency FT-IR was used to characterize the presence of specific chemical groups to confirm the presence of crosslinking in the optimized film. FT-IR spectra were recorded over the range from 400 to 4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Samples were conditioned at relative moisture of 65 ± 2% and 21 ± 1 °C for at least 48 h prior to the test. The equipment used was a FT-IR ABB Bomen 102 (ABB Ltd, Zurich Switzerland) with a Universal Attenuated Total Reflectance (UATR) accessory. UV-VIS-NIR spectra of the films was recorded in the region (190 nm–2500 nm) to analyse the ultraviolet and visible light barrier properties of the films. A spectrophotometer V-670 (Jasco Inc, Japan) was used in transmittance mode. The percent transmittance of light at 600 nm, was used to calculate the film transparency following the Equation (3) (Han & Floros, 1997): (4) Transparency = ( log%T 600 ) / X Where %T600 is the percentage of transmittance at 600 nm and x is the film thickness (mm). The test was done in duplicate for each sample."
6,Thermal properties,"2.5 Thermal properties Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the films. The equipment used was a Q1000 (TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The samples (around 2–4 mg) were placed in hermetic aluminium pans. The test was carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 50 to 400 °C, in inter atmosphere of N2 (50 mL/min)."
7,Statistical analysis,"2.6 Statistical analysis Cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol concentration were considered as independent variables (denoted A, B and C, respectively) and the effect on the selected dependent variables (TS, %E, and VWP) were calculated. The set of experiments followed the Box–Behnken design (Box & Behnken, 1960). Table 1 shows the experiment design. Cook's distance was used to detect outliers (Cook, 1977). The multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. The statistical analysis was accomplished using Design Expert® 10.0.6 software (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)."
8,Results and discussion,"Films were obtained from cellulose, glycerol and polyvinyl alcohol at the concentrations shown in Table 1. As explained in a previous work (Cazón et al., 2018a), cellulose concentration was from 3 to 4% (w/w), because at those concentrations, a clear solution is obtained following the NaOH/urea method. Glycerol ranged from 0 to 5%. The maximum concentration of glycerol was 5% because higher concentration destabilized the cellulose solution. PVA concentration ranged from 2 to 10% (w/w). The low concentration of PVA was the minimum to avoid rupture of the films during drying. The maximum concentration of PVA bath was 10% (w/w) because at higher PVA concentration the bath was too viscous. The average thickness of the films was 0.06 mm. Results obtained for TS, %E and WVP are shown in Table 1. The relationship between the composition of the films and the dependent variables (TS, %E and WVP) was modelled using a second-order polynomial equation. Partial models were also obtained and analysed by ANOVA."
9,Mechanical properties,"3.1 Mechanical properties The TS values ranged from 25.90 to 368.82 MPa. Data fitted well to a quadratic equation. Trial 4 was disregarded because it was identified as an outlier by the Cook's distance test. The ANOVA results are shown in Table 2 . The value of r2 was 0.96. The F-value was 11.76 (p-value < 0.02). These statistical parameters denote that the mathematical model was significant. The signal/noise ratio is measured by the adequate precision. A ratio greater than 4 is desirable. The adequate precision obtained was 13.81 implying an adequate signal. F-values indicated that TS was highly affected by the cellulose-glycerol interaction, followed by the quadratic terms of the tree components of the film and the linear term of the PVA concentration. Equation (4) forecasts the values of TS for real cellulose, glycerol and PVA concentrations. (5) T S = 2246.10 − 1582.88 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) + 251.58 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) + 90.11 · P V A ( % ) − 90.86 · C e l l u l o s e · G l y c e r o l ( % ) − 7.55 · C e l l u l o s e · P V A ( % ) + 1.41 · G l y c e r o l · P V A ( % ) + 266.00 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) 2 + 11.35 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) 2 − 5.53 · P V A ( % ) 2 According to the response surface (Fig. 3 ), an increase of glycerol concentration causes a decrease of TS values using the same concentration of cellulose and PVA. However, the TS value increases up to 58.58 MPa when no glycerol is added into the formulation. The model describes a decrease of TS when PVA increases when cellulose and glycerol concentrations were fixed. The effect of glycerol could be explained by a competition for hydrogen bonds between polymer–polymer and polymer–plasticizer when a plasticizer is incorporated into the polymer matrix. Thus, direct interactions among polymer chains are reduced partly because of hydrogen bonds are formed with the plasticizer. The concentration of plasticizer could also increase significantly the amount of hydrogen bonds (Xiao et al., 2003). A similar effect was reported for methyl cellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) films. In both films, TS decreased when the concentration of plasticizers (polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and glycerol) was increased (Park, Weller, Vergano, & Testin, 1993). The addition of plasticizers (glycerol or α-monoglycerides) lowered the TS of regenerated cellulose films from cotton linter. In that case, films were prepared by dipping dry cellulose films in a 5% plasticizer bath for 3 h (Xiao et al., 2003). A decrease of TS after adding glycerol to whey protein-methylcellulose films was also observed (Erdohan & Turhan, 2005). In the present study, the TS value decreased when the cellulose concentration increased. This behavior is probably due to an increase in cellulose crystallinity, which promoted the brittleness of the film. Besides, mechanical properties of cellulose-based films are affected by the void spaces between cellulosic fibers reducing the amount of hydrogen bonds. However, incorporation of PVA improved the plasticizing efficiency, promoting the interaction between components resulting in better mechanical properties (Asgher, Ahmad, & Iqbal, 2017). This effect of PVA was also observed in bacterial cellulose-assisted de-lignified wheat straw-PVA-based, chitosan and polyethylene oxide films reinforced with PVA, reaching higher TS values at higher concentrations of PVA (Asgher et al., 2017; Ferdous, Mustafa, & Khan, 2003). Previous studies reported TS values of cellulose films from 65.1 to 88.7 MPa, depending on the concentration, time and temperature of H2SO4 coagulation bath (Zhang, Mao, Zhou, & Cai, 2005). TS values from 60 to 90 MPa were reported using acetic acid as a coagulation bath (Zhang, Ruan, & Zhou, 2001). Those values are comparable with TS values obtained in the current study. Additionally, the TS values of films obtained in this study are comparable with those of cellophane and other synthetic polymers including high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and cellophane which have TS values of 29.3, 20, 31–38 and 80 MPa, respectively (Cazón et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2003). Using the polynomial model, it is possible to select the best formulation to obtain films within the range of the study. Values of %E were in the range from 0.89 to 18.74%. Data fitted to a second-order polynomial model. The ANOVA is shown in Table 2. The value of r2 was 0.89. The F-value of the reduced mathematical model was 10.96 (p-value < 0.00) indicating that the model was significant. The adequate precision ratio of 11.32 indicates an adequate signal. The evaluation of the F-values of the three variables confirmed that %E was mainly affected by the linear term of the PVA concentration and the interaction glycerol-PVA, followed by the linear term of glycerol, the interaction cellulose-PVA and the cellulose term. The cellulose-glycerol interaction term on %E was not significant. Equation (5) predicts the %E in the range of study for real cellulose, glycerol and PVA concentrations. (6) % E = 13.28 − 5.45 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) + 1.51 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) − 3.03 · P V A ( % ) − 0.02 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · G l y c e r o l ( % ) + 1.53 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · P V A ( % ) − 0.41 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) · P V A ( % ) According to the response surface (Fig. 4 ), PVA showed a plasticizing effect that could be explicated by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the plasticizer and cellulose, weakening the hydrogen bonds among cellulosic polymer chains. Increasing cellulose concentration, slightly increases the PVA effect on %E. On the other hand, increasing the concentration of glycerol resulted in a decrease of E% values at high content of PVA. This behaviour could be caused by a disruptive effect of the cellulose matrix (Xiao et al., 2003). An important effect on mechanical properties of films (decrease of TS values and increase of %E) is expected when using glycerol as a plasticizer. But in this study, glycerol had a disruptive behaviour at high concentrations. Even though, the anti-plasticization effect has been observed in synthetic polymers, the mechanisms involved are not well known (Lourdin, Bizot, & Colonna, 1997). This phenomenon occurs when the plasticizer is introduced at low amounts (<15%). A robust contact might be taking place between the polymer and the plasticizer at low concentrations, occasioning a “cross-linking” effect that reduces the free volume and the mobility of molecules in the polymer matrix. Furthermore, a small concentration of the plasticizer could enhance the restructuring of the material rising its crystallinity and reducing the strain of the film (Suyatma, Tighzert, Copinet, & Coma, 2005). Previous studies reported %E values from 2 to 5% for regenerated cellulose films (Zhang et al., 2001). Similar values were obtained in this study for cellulose films with low PVA concentration. The most used synthetic polymers (high- and low-density polyethylene, cellophane) have the following %E: 859%, 633% and 8%, respectively (Cazón et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2001). Comparing with the E% values obtained in this work, our films are far of high- and low-density polyethylene. However, the obtained films showed higher %E values than those of commercial cellophane. The low %E could be useful for some applications in food packaging where high %E is not required."
10,Effect on water vapour permeability (WVP),"3.2 Effect on water vapour permeability (WVP) Films showed values of WVP in the 2.32·10−11-3.01·10−11 g/s·m·Pa range. Data was fitted to a quadratic model. Trial 13 was detected as an outlier. The F-value was 36.23 (p-value < 0.00) meaning that the model was significant. The ANOVA is shown in Table 2. The adequate precision was 21.36 and r2 was 0.99. F-values showed that WVP was mainly affected by the quadratic term of the PVA, followed by the linear term of the cellulose and the interaction cellulose-glycerol term. The linear term of the cellulose and glycerol concentrations was smaller. Equation (6) predicts the response of WVP for real cellulose, glycerol and PVA concentrations. (7) V W P = 5.80 · 10 − 11 − 2.29 · 10 − 11 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) + 5.81 · 10 − 12 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) + 2.63 · 10 − 12 · P V A ( % ) − 1.40 · 10 − 12 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · G l y c e r o l ( % ) + 5.31 · 10 − 14 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) · P V A ( % ) − 4.73 · 10 − 14 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) · P V A ( % ) + 3.31 · 10 − 12 · C e l l u l o s e ( % ) 2 − 7.65 · 10 − 14 · G l y c e r o l ( % ) 2 − 2.36 · 10 − 13 · P V A ( % ) 2 According to the response surface (Fig. 5 ), maximum values of WVP are reached for intermediate values of PVA. In addition, WVP values increase as the glycerol concentration increases, and decrease slightly as the cellulose concentration increases, resulting in higher values at lower cellulose concentration. Films with concentrations of PVA up of 5% had lower WVP values. In general, polysaccharide-based films have poor water vapor barrier properties because of their hydrophilic character. Furthermore, adding hydrophilic plasticizers worsen the water vapour barrier properties. Though the addition of a plasticizing agent is needed to decrease brittleness and to rise flexibility, in many cases plasticizers also rise the permeability of the films (Gennadios et al., 1994; Gontard, Guilbert, & Cuq, 1993). The cellulose concentration affected slightly the WVP values. Polymers of cellulose have a high crystallinity that are inaccessible to water molecules. Nevertheless it also contain a paracrystalline component that is sensitive to water molecules, making cellulose hydrophilic (Bedane et al., 2015). Increasing the cellulose concentration could have increased the crystallinity of the film, thus decreasing the WVP values. Similar values of WVP have been reported for cellophane, in the range from 2.22·10−11 to 7.12·10−11 g/s·m·Pa for different moisture contents. An increase of the water vapour permeability of cellophane was observed when the moisture content increased (Del Nobile, Fava, & Piergiovanni, 2002). Regenerated cellulose films from bleached Kraft pulp had values from 1.0·10−12 to 3.0·10−10 g/s·m·Pa, as a function of moisture content (Bedane et al., 2015). The effect of hydrophilic plasticizers on the WVP was also observed in galactomannan and chitosan films, where increasing the glycerol concentration from 0.5 to 1.25% and at 2.0%, the WVP values increased significantly (Cerqueira, Souza, Teixeira, & Vicente, 2012). Besides, WVP value reported for PVA films was 12·10−10 g/s·m·Pa (Bonilla et al., 2014). This value could be due the hydrophilic properties of PVA. Comparing the values of WVP for pure PVA-based films, with the values of the films developed in this work, combining PVA with cellulose, improved the water vapour barrier properties. These values are far from those of synthetic polymers. The WVP value for polyvinylidene chloride is 0.7·10−13 g/s·m·Pa, for high-density polyethylene is 2.4·10−13 g/s·m·Pa and for polypropylene is 4.9·10−13 g/s·m·Pa (Cazón et al., 2017). The WVP values obtained from the developed films in this study are 2 orders of magnitude higher from those values from synthetic polymers."
11,Structural analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.3 Structural analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Fig. 2 shows that the films were translucent. A visual inspection revealed that both sides were not equal. The appearance of the film surface depends on the composition of the mixture as showed by scanning electron microscopy. The top and bottom surfaces of the films obtained in experiments 1, 2 and 13 are shown in Fig. 6 . The selected experiments allowed observing the effect of glycerol on the surface of the film while keeping the PVA concentration constant (experiments 1 and 2) or increasing the PVA concentration (experiment 2 and 13). Films showed a continuous and a homogeneous appearance from the interior to the exterior, indicating a solid structure. Adding glycerol smoothed the rough surface observed in the top side of the film as evidenced comparing experiment 1 and 2. A flat surface in the top side can be obtained using of 10% of PVA."
12,"Spectral analysis, transparency and light barrier","3.4 Spectral analysis, transparency and light barrier In the present study, cellulose films for the experiments 9, 10 and 15 were selected to observe the effect of the concentration of glycerol and cellulose on the structural level, optical and thermal properties. FT-IR spectra of cellulose films for the experiments 9, 10 and 15 are shown in Fig. 7 . The selected experiments allow observing the effect of glycerol and the variation of cellulose content. The FT-IR spectra showed similarities between this study and the previous results reported by our research group (Cazón et al., 2018a). In the 3700 - 3000 cm−1 region, the strong and broad peaks are endorsed to the stretching vibration of OH group (Fan, Dai, & Huang, 2012). Compared with the spectrum of experiment 15, the peaks of films from the experiment 9 and 10 were sharpened due to the glycerol content. The -OH band is sensitive to hydrogen bonding. Besides, hydroxyl groups in C2, C3 and C6 also contribute to the formation of inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds likely affect the mechanical properties of the films (Acharya, Hu, Moussa, & Abidi, 2017; Xiao, Zhang, Zhang, Lu, & Zhang, 2003b; Zhang, Ruan, & Gao, 2002). The vibration peaks around 2900 cm−1 are endorsed to the aliphatic CH stretching from alkyl groups, being stronger in presence of glycerol and high cellulose concentrations. The peaks in trial 9 and 10 at 2900 cm−1 shifted to high wavenumbers in trial 15, due to the interaction of glycerol with CH2 groups of cellulose (Xiao et al., 2003). The absorbance peaks observed around 1650 cm−1 were endorsed to the HOH bending of the water. Variations of the absorbance in the different peaks as a function of the glycerol content indicate an interaction between cellulose-glycerol-PVA. This behaviour suggests that during the film regeneration, the glycerol was retained inside the cellulose fibers. Developing films with good barrier properties in the UV light range (200–280 nm) is important to protect foods from lipid oxidations promoted by UV radiation, which affect the organoleptic properties and decrease its shelf life (Guo et al., 2014). In addition, it is important to develop films with an acceptable appearance by the consumer. The spectra in the range of UV, visible and near infrared radiation of selected trials of films are shown in Fig. 8 . The selected trials permitted to observe the effect of the variation of glycerol and cellulose on the spectra. In the 190–400 nm (UV region) range, films with glycerol had higher absorbance (experiment 10 and 9), decreasing with increasing cellulose content. In trial 15, films without glycerol disclosed a very low absorption in the UV area. Therefore, a protective effect of glycerol against UV radiation was inferred. The protective effect of glycerol against UV radiation was also observed in our previous study, analysing the light-barrier as a function of glycerol and PVA content. On the other side, the same protective effect of PVA was not detected. Regard to the transparency of the films, the obtained values were 38.56, 89.38 and 53.23 for experiment 9, 10 and 15, respectively. The cellulose affected the transparency, which decreased with the cellulose content. The thickness of the films slightly increased with cellulose concentration. High thickness values could also affect the transparency values (Elsabee & Abdou, 2013), as observed by Cazón et al. (2018a), where lower values of transparency were obtained by increasing the thickness of the films containing high concentration of PVA. The developed films had optimal values of transparency, similar to the values of synthetic polymers (Han & Floros, 1997; Lee, Son, & Hong, 2008). In the near infrared region, the peaks at 1450 and 1950 nm were associated to the first overtone of the OH stretching and the combined stretching and deformation of OH groups from glycerol. The absorption at 2260 nm is likely associated to a combination of CH and OH stretching overtones from cellulose (Martelo-Vidal & Vázquez, 2014)."
13,Thermal properties of films,"3.5 Thermal properties of films Fig. 9 shows the DSC curves of the selected films. The first endothermic peak between 50 and 120 °C, corresponds to the volatilization of water from the film samples (Bonilla et al., 2014; Morán, Alvarez, Cyras, & Vázquez, 2008). Two peaks were observed in the region between 180 and 390 °C, corresponding to the depolymerization of the film compounds (Morán et al., 2008; Phinichka & Kaenthong, 2016). The endotherm peak at 225 °C corresponds to the thermal degradation of PVA (Bonilla et al., 2014). This peak was bigger and sharper in the sample of experiment 10, due to the lower cellulose content and the presence of glycerol. Probably, the interaction between glycerol and PVA was more intense at low cellulose concentrations as observed by DSC analysis of films from cellulose at different concentrations of PVA (Cazón et al., 2018a). In this study, it was possible to observe that this interaction depends on the cellulose content. The peaks between 250 and 350 °C correspond to the onset temperature of thermal degradation of cellulose (Liu et al., 2011). The presence of glycerol at low cellulose concentrations resulted in an increased thermal stability of the films, which is attributable to the increased interaction between the plasticizers and the cellulose film (Cazón et al., 2018a; Morgado et al., 2011)."
14,Conclusions,"The models obtained allowed selecting the formulation of cellulose-glycerol-PVA to manufacture films with similar TS values than those of synthetic polymer films. However, %E values of the developed films are far from those of synthetic polymers. In addition, a negative effect of glycerol on the mechanical properties of the films was observed. Glycerol disclosed an anti-plasticizing effect. The WVP values obtained showed 2 orders of magnitude far from the WVP values from synthetic polymers, although the combination of cellulose with PVA improved the WVP when compared to film from pure PVA. Increasing the cellulose concentration, increased crystallinity and decreased WVP values. The effect of glycerol and cellulose on the WVP properties was negligible compared to the effect of PVA. The absorbance values in the UV spectrum demonstrated the UV protective effect of glycerol in the films and cellulose-glycerol-PVA films had optimal values of transparency. FT-IR and DSC showed the interaction between the components of the films and confirms that glycerol was retained after the film regeneration process. Results showed that it is feasible to obtain cellulose-glycerol-polyvinyl alcohol composite films with improved mechanical properties, high water vapour permeability as well as good light-barrier properties and transparency."
