0,Introduction,"The impact of the particle size has been debated in catalysis both from the point of utilization of active sites and their geometric environment as well as from his impact on the electronic properties, which in turn influence search and catalysis [1–3]. Structure-reactivity correlations of metal species with different size (single-atom, nanocluster, and nanoparticle) have been well established and provided scientific basis for the design of high-performance metal catalysts [4–7]. Besides the metal catalysts, the metal oxides (ZnO [8,9]), sulfides (MoS2 [10,11]), carbides (MoCx [12]) and phosphides (Ni2P [13–15]), also show the intrinsic properties of active sites to vary with the size of material domains. Because of the complexity structure of these materials compared with single component nanoparticles, it is, however, challenging to establish unequivocal correlations between catalytic properties and particle size. For semiconducting metal oxides, sulfides, carbides and phosphides nanoparticles, the electronic band structures change with the particle size [16–19]. Unlike with single component nanoparticles, in these materials electron redistribution between the constituting elements is possible. For instance, theory shows that for ZnO nanoparticles ranging in size from 0.9 to 1.5 nm the electron density of Zn atoms decreases and that for O atom increases with increasing ZnO particle size, i.e., polarity increases [20]. Catalytic hydrogenation reaction, involving dissociative adsorption of the H2 on catalyst surface and subsequent stepwise H addition to the sorbed organic substrate, is sensitive to both electronic and geometric properties of the catalysts [7,21]. Sulfides, carbides, and phosphides show very good catalytic activity, sometimes even surpassing the performance of the metal catalysts, which is attributed to the electron distribution between the constituting elements [22–25]. For example, Ni2P shows better chemoselective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes than Ni. This has been attributed to the electron withdrawing effect of P on Ni [22]. For Mo2C, the electronic modification from carbon addition makes it to have higher CO2 hydrogenation activity than observed for PtCo/CeO2 and PtNi/CeO2. [23]. It suggests that the electronic properties of the above materials strongly affect their hydrogenation performance. In this work, we investigate Ni2P, a promising candidate to replace noble metal catalyst owing to its Pt-like electronic structure [26–28], and use it for the hydrogenation of phenol, a significant step for the lignin-based biomass upgrading and production of some important industrial chemicals [29–33]. Using kinetic analysis combined with physicochemical characterization techniques, we attribute the size-dependent reaction rate to the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of each elementary steps as functions of electronic properties of Ni2P. We will discuss, how the change of electronic property of Ni2P caused by different size affects the adsorption property and intrinsic hydrogenated rate of each catalyst under reaction conditions, and finally lead to a volcanic trend between Ni2P size and phenol conversion."
1,Results and discussion,"A series of Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts with varying Ni2P sizes were synthesized by controlling the reduction temperatures and Ni loadings. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show the catalysts having only Ni2P phase (Fig. 1 ) at 2θ of 40.8°, 44.7°, 47.4°, 54.2°, and 55.0° (PDF 74-1385), which was in line with the reported works [14,15]. The Ni2P crystallite sizes on these catalysts were from 3 nm to 38 nm, calculated using the diffraction peaks at 2 theta of 40.8°, 44.7° and 47.4° by Scherrer equation (Supplementary Table S1). These Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts were denoted with the specific crystallite size of Ni2P, for example 3 nm Ni2P/SiO2 means Ni2P/SiO2 with 3 nm Ni2P. Besides, we have also taken the TEM images of 3 nm Ni2P catalysts (Supplementary Figure S1a-c) to support the crystallites size results from XRD. It was observed that the small Ni2P particles dispersed well on SiO2 support, and there were hardly sub-nm clusters. The particle size of Ni2P on this sample was measured to be 3.3 ± 0.6 nm (Supplementary Figure S1d), in line with the XRD determined crystallite size. The chemical and physical properties of the Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts were compiled in Table 1 . Actually, Ni loadings of the Ni2P catalysts were all below the expected stoichiometric values. Besides, the dispersion of Ni2P on SiO2 support decreased from (4.7 ± 0.1)% to (1.9 ± 0.1)% with Ni2P size increasing from 3 nm to 38 nm. These catalysts were then investigated for hydrogenation of phenol in dodecane. On 3 nm Ni2P/SiO2, the phenol was converted with a rate of 1.4 × 10−7 molphenol gcatal −1 s−1 at 473 K, leading to 62.0% cyclohexane, 9.3% cyclohexene, 12.7% cyclohexanol and 16.0% cyclohexanone at phenol conversion of 1.1%. The increase in Ni2P/SiO2 particle size did not affect the product distribution (Supplementary Table S2), however, the phenol conversion rate showed a clear maximum (Fig. 2 ). The reaction rate and surface Ni2P sites normalized rate (turnover frequency, TOF) first increased with the Ni2P size from 3 to 15 nm, and then decreased when the size further increased to 38 nm. The TOF maxima on 15 nm Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst was 48.8 × 10−3 s−1, which was approximately 24 times and 16 times higher than those on 3 nm and 38 nm Ni2P/SiO2, respectively. Based on the products distribution on all Ni2P/SiO2 as well as the literatures [34,35], the reaction pathway for phenol hydrogenation on Ni2P/SiO2 is shown in Scheme 1 (a): phenol is delayed hydrogenated to 2-cyclohexene-1-one, which is subsequently hydrogenated to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. In the presence of acid sites, the cyclohexanol is dehydrated to cyclohexene, finally hydrogenating to cyclohexane. Although phenol hydrogenation proceeds via multiple sequential steps, its conversion rate is determined by the rate of the first hydrogenation step to 2-cyclohexene-1-one. However, it is hardly detectable in the hydrogenation of phenol because its reaction rate over all Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts were much higher (> 38 folds) than those of phenol (Supplementary Figure S2). This suggests that the conversion rate for phenol hydrogenation is determined by the rate of the phenol reduction to 2-cyclohexene-1-one, while the subsequent steps are sufficiently fast. The reduction to 2-cyclohexene-1-one consists of two elementary steps (Scheme 1(b)): addition of the first H to phenol to generate H-phenol (1st H addition), and addition of the second H to H-phenol for 2-cyclohexene-1-one (2nd H addition). The reaction rate (r) of the phenol hydrogenation can be expressed as: (1) r = k C Ph m P H 2 n The C Ph is the concentration of phenol and P H2 is the pressure of H2; m and n are their corresonding reaction order. Because the phenol concentration and H2 pressure are independent with each other, the reaction orders (m and n) are expressed as: (2) m = ( ∂ I n r ∂ I n C Ph ) P H 2 (3) n = ( ∂ I n r ∂ I n P H 2 ) C Ph A detailed reaction elementary steps and kinetic analysis for phenol hydrogenation to 2-cyclohexene-1-one based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is shown in Table 2 . Formally, phenol (Ph) molecularly adsorbs on Ni2P surface (Eq. 4). H2 dissociatively adsorbs on Ni2P surface into two surface H atoms, competitively with phenol (Eq. 5). Subsequently, phenol reacts with the first H atom to produce H-phenol (H-Ph*), which is a reversible step. We use η, i.e., the approach to equilibrium (Eq. 6), to represent the ratio of reverse and forward reaction rates. If the value of η is zero, the forward reaction rate is much larger than that of reverse and thus 1st H addition is the rate determining step. If the η is one, the 1st H addition step reaches to equilibrium, and the rate determining step shifts to the next reaction step. Then, the addition of a second H to H-Ph* makes H2Ph, leaving the Ni2P surface and this step is considered to be irreversible (Eq. 7). The coverage for empty sites (θ *), reactants (θ Ph, θ H and θ HPh), and overall rate (r) are expressed as Eqs. 8 and 9 at a given concentration of phenol and pressure of H2, respectively (The derivation details are in the Supplementary Material section S1). Based on the overall rate equation, the apparent reaction order of phenol (m) and H2 (n) are expressed as Eq. 10. In particular, they are functions of θ Ph, θ H, θ HPh and η. The measured apparent reaction orders of phenol and H2 over Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts tested at different reaction conditions are shown in Table 3 (All reaction order plots were shown in the Supplementary Material section S2). Under the reaction condition of 473 K, 1–3 MPa H2, and (2.7–8.0) × 10−2 mol/L phenol, the phenol reaction orders are approximately zero for all catalysts, indicating a medium coverage of Ph and H-Ph* on the catalysts. For the H2 reaction order, it decreased from 1.01 ± 0.00 to 0.49 ± 0.02 with the increase of Ni2P size, implying that Ni2P with larger particle size adsorbs H2 stronger, leading to a higher coverage of H and lower reaction order. When performing the reaction at lower H2 pressures (0.1–0.5 H2 MPa), the phenol and H2 reaction orders were about 0 and 1.0 over all Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts. For 3 nm Ni2P/SiO2, a reaction order of 0.40 ± 0.02 for phenol was observed at lower phenol concentrations ((2.7–8.0) × 10−3 mol/L phenol), and H2 reaction order was 1.02 ± 0.03. The first order reaction of H2 was achievable on all catalysts as long as the H2 pressure was low. Equation 10 shows that the H2 reaction order is a function of η, θ H and θ HPh. Assuming that the θH and θ HPh are all zero, the upper limit of the H2 reaction order can be estimated and is positively related to η. When the value of η is zero, the maximum value of the H2 reaction order is 0.5; while if it was above zero, the H2 reaction order was 0.5–1. For the Ni2P catalysts, this is only possible when the η = 1, that is, the 1st H addition is an equilibrated step. Thus, the expression of H2 reaction order turns into Eq. (11). (11) n = 1 - θ H - θ HPh Based on the measured reaction orders (Table 3), the coverages θ of sorbed H, phenol and H-added phenol at 473 K, 2 MPa H2, 5.3 × 10−2 mol/L phenol and 0.1 g catalyst, adsorption equilibrium constant K ° and intrinsic rate constant k for each elementary step were calculated using Eqs. 8–11 and summarized in Table 4 and Table 5 , respectively. (detailed calculations are documented in the Supplementary Material section S3). The 3 nm Ni2P/SiO2 exhibited poor H2 adsorption, and thus θ H and θ HPh were approximately zero, thereby θ Ph and θ * were the highest among all catalysts, being (54 ± 2)% and (46 ± 2)%, respectively (Table 4). When the Ni2P size was 7 nm, θ H and θ HPh increased to (24 ± 1)% and (6 ± 1)%, whereas θ Ph and θ * decreased to (37 ± 1)% and (33 ± 1)% compared to those on 3 nm Ni2P/SiO2, which was ascribed to the enhanced H2 adsorption with the Ni2P size increased. For the catalysts with Ni2P size of 15 nm and above, all coverage values were similar, suggesting that the larger Ni2P particle had weak influence on the reactant coverage. The adsorption equilibrium constant of phenol (K ο Ph) and H2 (K ο H2 ), and the intrinsic rate constant of H addition to H-Ph* (k H2 Ph) are shown in Table 5. For all catalysts, K ο Ph are identical whereas K ο H2 increased monotonically with the Ni2P particle size. In particular, K ο H2 increased drastically from < 1.0 × 10−4 on 3 nm to (4.1 ± 0.7) × 10−3 on 15 nm, and then increased slightly from (4.1 ± 0.7) × 10−3 to (6.3 ± 0.9) × 10−3 when the Ni2P size was > 15 nm, rationalized by the smaller Ni2P particle inducing greater bandgap change than the larger ones [19]. For the case of k H2 Ph, it decreased monotonically from > 5.0 s−1 to (0.05 ± 0.02) s−1 with the increased Ni2P size. The volcano-like evolution of the phenol hydrogenation rate with Ni2P particle size is the consequence of changes of H2 adsorption and the intrinsic rate of the elementary step of H addition to H-Ph* species, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The K ο Ph is insensitive to the different sizes of Ni2P, thus, is concluded to be inconsequential for the different hydrogenation rate. The K ο H2 and k H2 Ph show the opposite changing trend with Ni2P particle size, that is, K ο H2 increases and k H2 Ph decreases with increasing of Ni2P particle size. On the Ni2P with small particle sizes, H2 adsorption is too weak, i.e., too small K ο H2 that insufficient H on Ni2P to react with phenol leads to a lower reaction rate. In contrast, H on large Ni2P particles binds too strongly with Ni2P that becomes less reactive, i.e., too small k H2 Ph, although it is sufficiently abundant on Ni2P surface. On the optimal Ni2P catalyst with size of 15 nm, the adsorbed H has both sufficient surface concentration and reactivity, thus, having the highest reaction rate. This trend is more evident in Fig. 3 (b), when plotting the reaction TOF as a function of H2 adsorption free energy on Ni2P (ΔG ο H). It shows that the highest reaction rate is achieved at ΔG ο H of ~10.5 to 11.0 kJ/mol, while hydrogen binding too strong or too weak will decrease the rate. This shows that the Sabatier’s principle [36] also applies to Ni2P catalyst for hydrogenation reaction. To explore the reason for the increasing H adsorption strength (i.e. decrease of ΔG ο H) with the increase of Ni2P size, XPS was carried out to probe electron state of Ni2P particle. Fig. 4 shows the XPS results of Ni2P catalysts with size of 3 nm, 15 nm, and 38 nm, which were measured after pretreating under H2 without exposing to air. The binding energy of Ni (2p3/2) region at 852.2–852.8 eV were the Niδ+ in Ni2P, Where 0 < δ < 2 [37–39]. Moreover, the peak of Niδ+ in Ni2P decreased from 852.8 eV to 852.2 eV with the Ni2P size increased from 3 to 38 nm. It could be due to the coordination between Ni and P in Ni2P crystallite, i.e., the Ni cations coordinated with more numbers of P made an additional electron transfer from Ni to P [40]. Thus, the δ value of Niδ+ should be as δ (3 nm Ni2P) > δ (15 nm Ni2P) > δ (38 nm Ni2P). In this context, using EXAFS Oyama et al. showed that the Ni cations in small size of Ni2P has higher numbers of coordinated P atoms than those of the Ni2P with large size [14]. Consequently, the electron density of Ni increased with the increase of Ni2P size, and, thus, improved the electron-donating ability of Ni site to antibonding orbital of H2, resulting in the enhanced H2 adsorption on Ni2P surface [41]. As a complement of our argument, we carried out the stability test of the Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts. The 15 nm Ni2P/SiO2 catalyst was recycled for five runs in phenol hydrogenation at 513 K. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3a, all the five runs on 0.1 g catalysts had nearly full conversion of phenol. However, this is due to an overloading of catalysts. The elementary analysis of the used catalyst after 5 runs showed a Ni loss of ~50% from (9.8 ± 0.3)% on the fresh catalyst to (4.8 ± 0.6)% on the used catalysts. In spite of the Ni loss, XRD pattern indicate that Ni2P phase still remains on support and no other nickel phosphide phases formed (Supplementary Figure S3b). In particular, its crystallite size was hardly changed compared to the fresh sample (17 vs. 15 nm). Therefore, we surmise that the Ni2P particles did not dissolve in the solvent, however, it detached from the SiO2 support during the reaction that caused the loss of Ni and P. Since the detached Ni2P particle remains the size as its counterpart on the SiO2 support, they should have the same catalytic activities."
2,Conclusion,"In summary, the electronic properties of Ni2P nanoparticles show a marked function of the particle size. With the size increasing from 3 nm to 38 nm, the binding energy of Ni decreases 0.6 eV correlated with a decreasing surface concentration of Ni with P atoms, which corresponds to a higher electron density. This increased electron density of Ni site enhances H adsorption strength, decreasing the adsorption free energy (ΔG ο H). Therefore, large Ni2P stabilize sorbed H on Ni sites. In the catalytic hydrogenation of oxygenates such as phenol, the reaction rate shows a clear maximum with the Ni2P particle size at 15 nm Ni2P, emphasizing an optimum hydrogen binding strength. Below 15 nm, H binds too weakly leading to a low H coverage, which approaches zero on 3 nm Ni2P. In contrast, on Ni2P above 15 nm H binds too strongly, becoming less reactive while being rather abundant. The low reactivity is shown by the one order of magnitude smaller rate constant for 38 nm Ni2P than for 15 nm Ni2P. The size-dependence of the catalytic activity of Ni2P in hydrogenation is intrinsically dependent on electronic property of the hydrogen binding site, while it shows only a subtle influence on the binding of the to be hydrogenated substrate. The fact that Ni2P is a partly reducible semiconductor, points to exciting options to dynamically adjust such materials for selective hydrogenations primarily via hydrogen binding."

5,Synthesis of the Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts with different particle sizes,"4.2 Synthesis of the Ni2P/SiO2 catalysts with different particle sizes The synthesis of nickel phosphide catalysts with different particle sizes at theoretical Ni content of 10 wt% on SiO2 support were performed via incipient wetness impregnation method. The calculation for Ni content was presented in Equation (12). Detailed information for the preparation procedure was as the followings: the impregnation solution was prepared by adding a stoichiometric amount of Ni(OH)2, H3PO2 and water with stirring to form a clear and light green solution at 343 K [42], subsequently adding a certain amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O to form a green solution. Then, 2 g SiO2 was put into the mixture solution to stir for 16 h at 343 K. Afterwards, the sample was dried at 343 K for 12 h and then the catalyst precursor was obtained. To control the size of formed nickel phosphides, the precursor was reduced at 673 K, 773 K, and 873 K under H2 atmosphere (30 mL min−1), accordingly. The reduction temperature was increased from room temperature to the aimed temperature at a rate of 2 K min−1 and maintained at this temperature for 2 h. After the reduction experiment, the obtained samples were cooled to room temperature under H2 atmosphere. Finally, the obtained catalysts were named as a, b, and c according to the reduction temperatures. In order to obtain catalysts with different particle sizes from those on the above three materials. Other two catalysts with theoretical Ni content of 10 wt% and 20 wt% were prepared using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and NH4H2PO4. 2 g SiO2 impregnated into the solution containing a stoichiometric amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and NH4H2PO4 at room temperature for 16 h. Then, the samples were dried at 373 K for 12 h and calcined at 873 K under air atmosphere for 4 h. The precursor sample was reduced under flowing H2 (30 mL min−1) to obtain the active phosphide catalyst. The reduction temperature was increased from room temperature to 873 K at a rate of 2 K min−1 and maintained at 873 K for 2 h, followed cooling to room temperature under H2 atmosphere. The finally obtained samples were named as d and e according to the different Ni loadings. Note, the Ni/P molar ratio was 0.8 for all catalysts. The calculation equation for Ni content was as follow: (12) Ni wt % = [ mass of Ni ( mass of Ni + mass of SiO 2 ) ] × 100"
6,Catalyst characterization,"4.3 Catalyst characterization Crystal structure of all catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips X’Pert Pro System with Cu-Kα1 radiation operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. Powder diffraction patterns were recorded over the 10–70° 2θ range at a scan rate of 0.017° s−1. Crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation Dc = Kλ/β cos(θ) in which K was the shape factor with a value of 0.9, λ was the X-ray wavelength, β was the line broadening at half the maximum intensity in radians, and θ was the bragg angle. The actual Ni loading of the samples were determined by the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) on a UNICAM 939 AA–Spectrometer. Prior to measurement, the sample was dissolved in a mixture of hydrofluoric acid (48%) and nitro-hydrochloric acid at its boiling point. AXIS Ultra DLD (KRATOS) spectrometer was used for XPS measurement. The excitation source used was monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray. The catalysts were pretreated under H2 atmosphere at 623 K for 2 h in the chamber, and then started XPS experiment without exposing the samples to air. The calibration of XPS spectra were performed by the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV. Metal dispersion was characterized by CO-TPD with Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. The sample (0.1 g) was first placed in a U tube and then pretreated at 623 K for 1 h under 10% H2/Ar with a flow rate of 50 mL/min. Subsequently, the pretreated sample was purged by He for 1 h at 623 K. Then, the system temperature was decreased to 313 K, following by adsorbing 3 wt% CO/He for 30 min. After the adsorption experiment, turning off 3 wt% CO/He and switching to He to purge samples for 30 min. Then, increasing the system temperature from 313 K to 873 K at a rate of 10 K min−1 to start the desorption experiment. CO desorption amount was analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
7,Catalyst test,"4.4 Catalyst test The phenol hydrogenation was conducted in a batch autoclave (Parr 4848 Instrument, 300 mL). Typically, phenol (2.7–8.0) × 10−2 mol/L, catalyst (0.1 g), and dodecane (100 mL) were added into the autoclave. The reactor was firstly flushed with H2 at ambient temperature by three times, and then was charged to desired H2 pressure at ambient temperature. Subsequently, it was heated to 473 K with a stirring speed of 700 rpm. The contents in reactor was collected with intervals of 10 min online. After 1 h, the reactor was quenched to ambient temperature by ice and water mixture. The recyclability test was conducted at 513 K. After each run, the catalyst was separated from the resultant mixture by filtration, washing with acetone and oven drying for next run without other treatments. The collected contents were quantitatively analyzed by a GC (Shimadzu GC-2010) equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm) using the internal standard benzyl alcohol. The concentrations of phenol and products were obtained by the internal standard method. Its chromatographic peak on GC chromatogram was independent, and would not overlap with those of the products and reactant. The benzyl alcohol and standard samples (phenol, cyclohexaone, cyclohexene, cyclohexane) were mixed in a 10 mL volumetric flask with dodecane as solvent. This solution was quantified by GC and then the standard line of each sample was obtained. Based on the results, the correction factor (f) of each sample was obtained with respect to benzyl alcohol. According to the obtained f, the concentration of phenol and products after reaction can be quantified via Equation (13): (13) C i = C b × f i × A i A b where A i and A b are the peak areas of phenol or product and benzyl alcohol, respectively. C b is the concentration of added bezenyl alcohol. The phenol conversion (X), products selectivity (S i), reaction rate (r) and turnover frequency normalized to the exposed site (TOF) were calculated as shown in Equations (14)–(17), where C 1 and C 2 are the concentrations of added and unconverted phenol, respectively, and C i is the concentration of product i in the contents. (14) X [ % ] = ( C 1 - C 2 ) C 1 × 100 (15) S i [ % ] = C i C 1 - C 2 × 100 (16) r = mole of converted phenol mass of catalyst × reaction time (17) TOF = mole of converted phenol mole of exposed metal site × reaction time"
