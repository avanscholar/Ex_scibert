0,Introduction,"Energy crisis and the demand for carbon emission reduction makes it urgent to explore low-carbon renewable energy. Hydrogen is an ideal candidate for it is the only fuel with no carbon, owns high energy content, totally clean with water as sole product, easy transportation and utilization with the ready-made facilities for natural gas, especially with the development of hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen can be easily converted to electricity efficiently. Traditional hydrogen production process still relies on fossil fuel, in which extreme conditions are usually required, leading to the environment deterioration. Hydrogen production through biological ways owns more environmental benefits with mild reaction conditions and potential for wastes management. Dark fermentation possesses more prospective in commercial application for its high hydrogen production rate, easy control. Moreover, it can use a wide range of organic wastes as feedstock for hydrogen production and resource recovery (Rajhi et al., 2016; Dennehy et al., 2017; Ding et al., 2017; Wang and Yin, 2017), which simultaneously achieves waste treatment and renewable energy generation. As dark fermentative hydrogen production is a complex microbial metabolism process, high hydrogen production efficiency and stability are required to accomplish a practical application of dark fermentative hydrogen production. Among the various influencing factors, substrate plays an important role: source of substrate determines the cost, structure of substrate defines the pretreatment required, and composition of substrate affects the fermentation type thus hydrogen production efficiency (Wang and Yin, 2018a,b). Substrate used for hydrogen production include the first-generation land-based crops, which may cause the competition for food resources; the second-generation non-edible lignocellulosic biomass, which has been widely studied as substrate for its wide distribution and large amount, but the high requirement for pretreatment and low degradation of lignin restricted its application; and the third-generation algae-based feedstock (Doshi et al., 2016). Especially for the marine algae, they can grow in a variety of marine environments, without requiring fresh water or cultivable land; they are lack of hemicellulose or lignin, thus the depolymerization can be easier; furthermore, they are high efficient in fixing carbon dioxide to biomass, shows great potential for carbon dioxide remediation (Wei et al., 2013). Marine algae has been widely used in recovering value-added products like hydrocarbons, syngas, and polyhalomethanes (Doshi et al., 2016). Up to now, various marine algae species have been studied for biohydrogen production, like Codium fragile, Gelidium amansii, Fucus vesiculosus, Laminaria japonica, and Gracilaria verrucosa etc. (Jung et al., 2011b; Barbot et al., 2015). L. japonica was proved to be more preferable with high carbohydrate content, readily soluble and easily hydrolyzable sugars. Furthermore, it is presenting as a kind of waste in some European countries. Thus, L. japonica is considered as an ideal feedstock for hydrogen production. However, intact macro-algae cell membranes and walls restrict the disintegration and prolong the hydrogen production process. Thus, pretreatment is a fundamental and essential step for a high efficient hydrogen production (Wang and Yin, 2018). Widely studied treatment methods include heat-shock, ultrasonication, acid/base and electric current. Park et al. (2009) explored heat-shock at different conditions in enhancing hydrogen production from L. japonica, results showed that highest hydrogen production was obtained at 65 °C for 20 min treatment. Liu and Wang (2014) compared hydrogen yield from heat-shock, ultrasonication, acid and base treated L. japonica, found that heat-shock treatment at 121 °C for 20 min group achieved highest hydrogen yield, followed by acid treatment with 1 mol/L HCl group. Jung et al. (2011a) combined heat-shock and acid in disintegrating L. japonica, obtained hydrogen yield was 1.5 times higher than sole heat-shock treated group. Xia et al. (2016) also obtained significant increase in hydrogen yield with combined heat-shock and acid pretreatment. It can be seen that heat-shock has been proved to be efficient in disrupting L. japonica, and enhanced effect can be obtained by combined heat-shock and acid treatment. Besides heat pretreatment, microwave pretreatment comprises both thermal and non-thermal effect, which has been used in disrupting microbial cells in waste activated sludge for hydrogen production, and the results demonstrated that microwave pretreatment was more efficient in solubilizing waste activated sludge and enhancing hydrogen production than heat-shock (Kuglarz et al., 2013). Combined microwave-acid treatment could achieve the synergistic effect effective in sludge disintegration (Liu et al., 2016). However, there is little information about the effect of microwave treatment on macroalgae disintegration, neither the effect of microwave on biohydrogen production from L. japonica. In this study, microwave was applied to pretreat L. japonica, and different dosages of H2SO4 were added to explore the effect of combined microwave-acid pretreatment on the saccharification of L. japonica. Hydrogen production from differently pretreated L. japonica was conducted. Hydrogen production, metabolites formation, and energy conversion during the fermentation process were comprehensively examined. Furthermore, microbial communities in different test groups were analyzed, revealing the mechanism of pretreatment in enhancing the hydrogen yield from the perspective of microbiology."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and algal biomass pretreatment,"2.1 Inoculum and algal biomass pretreatment Anaerobic sludge collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digester in a local sewage treatment plant was used as inoculum. Prior to inoculation, anaerobic sludge was boiled at 100 °C for 15 min to inhibit the hydrogen consumers (Wang and Wan, 2008), and then pre-cultured to enrich the hydrogen producers. During the pre-culture process, 150 mL flask was filled with 10 mL boiled anaerobic sludge, 80 mL deionized water, and 10 mL nutrient solution. 5 g glucose, 1 g peptone and 0.05 g yeast extract was added to supply the organic nutrients for microbial growth. Composition of nutrient solution was the same as described in reference (Yin et al., 2018). After that, the mixture was adjusted to pH 7.0, flushed with N2 for 3 min, and then cultivated at 36 °C for 24 h. Then, the mixtures after the cultivations were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min to separate the microbial biomass from the medium, and the obtained microbes were washed by 0.9% NaCl solution for 3 times before being used for biohydrogen production. L. japonica was washed by fresh water for 5 times, dried at 80 °C for 24 h, then comminuted. The macroalgal particles were sieved by an 18-mesh screen to obtain the powders with diameter less than 0.88 mm. Combined microwave-acid pretreatment was applied to enhance the saccharification of L. japonica and hydrogen production. During the pretreatment process, 12.5 g-TS /L of L. japonica was used in each sample. Microwave oven (APL-MD6H, Chengdu, China) with maximum power of 1000 W was used for the microwave treatment. Microwave frequency of 2450 MHz was adopted, and temperature was controlled at 140 for 15 min. Different amounts of 0%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% (v/v) H2SO4 were added, making the concentration of H2SO4 to be 0, 93.4, 186.7 and 373.5 mmol/L, respectively. The added acid worked together with microwave pretreatment to enhance the algae saccharification and hydrogen production."
3,Experimental set-up for biohydrogen production,"2.2 Experimental set-up for biohydrogen production Batch tests were designed to evaluate the influence of pretreatment on biohydrogen production from L. japonica. Dark fermentation was conducted in 150 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 mL working volume. For the control group, 1 g comminuted and sifted L. japonica was used as substrate. For the experimental groups, 80 mL pretreated L. japonica mixture (equivalent to 1 g TS added during pretreatment process) was used as substrate. Then, 10 mL inoculum and 10 mL nutrient solution were added in each flask to make the working volume of 100 mL. Composition of nutrient solution was the same as given in (Yin et al., 2014). The initial pH of all the reactors was adjusted to 7.0 with 5 mol/L NaOH and 5 mol/L HCl. Before the fermentation process, N2 gas was passed through the samples for 3 min to establish an anaerobic environment. Thereafter, all flasks were put in a reciprocal shaker with an agitation speed of 120 rpm at 36 °C. All batches were conducted in duplicate."
4,DNA extraction and PCR amplification,"2.3 DNA extraction and PCR amplification For the microbial community analysis, inoculum after heat treatment, sediment of all the test groups after the termination of fermentation were collected and kept at -80 °C until DNA extraction. E.Z.N.A. soil DNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, U.S.) was used for the DNA extraction. PCR amplication was performed from the obtained DNA. Two primers: 515F (5′-barcode- GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3′) and 907R (5′-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT-3′), and V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA gene was used for PCR amplification. For the PCR reactions, 10 ng of template DNA, 0.8 μL of each primer (5 μM), 4 μL of 5 × FastPfu Buffer, 2 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, and 0.4 μL of FastPfu Polymerase were involved in a total volume of 20 uL. The conditions used for PCR reactions were 95 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 30 s (repeat 25 cycles), 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and then a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, U.S.), and detected by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. A further quantification of PCR products was conducted using QuantiFluor™ -ST (Promega, U.S.) according to the results obtained from electrophoresis."
5,MiSeq sequencing and data analysis,"2.4 MiSeq sequencing and data analysis Amplicon sequencing was performed by Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Biotechnology (Shanghai, China) using Illumina MiSeq PE250. QIIME (version 1.17) was used to demultiplex and quality-filter the raw fastq files. Sequences were clustered according to their similarity, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined based on the similarity threshold of 97% using UPARSE (version 7.1). UCHIME was used to identify and remove the chimeric sequences."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods For the characteristics of L. japonica, VS, TS, total oxygen demand (TCOD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to the standard methods. The contents of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen were determined by an elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical CE 440, UK). Protein content was calculated by the nitrogen content multiplied by a factor of 6.25 (Richmond, 2004). Lipid content was determined as 1% of VS as suggested for Laminaria species (Sánchez-Machado et al., 2004). The energy value of L. japonica was calculated based on the modified Dulong Formula as shown in Eq. (1) (Nizami et al., 2009): (1) Energy value kJ/g VS = 0.337 C + 1.419 ( H - 0.125 O ) + 0.02326 N where C, H, O, and N represent the weight percentages of each element in total VS. For the soluble phase, all the samples were filtered through 0.45-μm filter membranes before the analysis. Concentration of carbohydrate and protein were determined by the phenol–sulfuric acid method and the modified Lowry method, respectively. Glucose, xylose, citrate, glycerol and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were determined by a HPLC (Shimadzu LC-20AD, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Aminex HPX–87H column, temperature of colum was kept at 60 °C. The injection volume was set as 20 μL. 5 mM H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The volume of biogas was determined by the water displacement method at room temperature (25 °C). A gas chromatograph (model 112A, Shanghai, China) was used to determine the fraction of hydrogen present in the biogas. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a packed column (model TDX-01, long 3 m, and diameter 3 mm) with a pre-column pressure of 0.2 MPa. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was adopted. The temperature of the column, detector and injector were 160 °C, 110 °C and 180 °C, respectively. Modified Gompertz equation was employed to describe the cumulative hydrogen production. The energy conversion efficiency (%) was defined as the ratio of the total heating value in hydrogen (kJ) and soluble metabolic products (kJ) to the total heating value of the added substrates (kJ). Calculations were conducted based on the quantities and the higher heating values of hydrogen (286 kJ/mol), acetic acid (874 kJ/mol), propionic acid (1527 kJ/mol), butyric acid (2184 kJ/mol), ethanol (1367 kJ/mol), citric acid (1972 kJ/mol) and glycerol (1682 kJ/mol)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characteristics of L. Japonica,"3.1 Characteristics of L. Japonica Characteristics of L. japonica are shown in Table 1 . An elementary analysis was performed to examine the composition of the biomass, and the result showed that carbon account for 40.1% of L. japonica biomass used in this study, indicating it was rich in carbohydrates, and the energy value was determined to be 13.29 kJ/g VS. The C/N ratio was determined to be 16, which lies in the reported range of 10.5–28.6 for brown algae (Barbot et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2016). The big variation of C/N ratio is heavily dependent on the specific species of brown algae, cultivation conditions and the time of harvest. It has been reported that brown algae harvested during July to September could achieve a peaked carbohydrate content (Tabassum et al., 2016)."
9,Effect of pretreatments on the disintegration of L. Japonica,"3.2 Effect of pretreatments on the disintegration of L. Japonica To disrupt the macroalgae cell membranes, thus releasing the organic matters present in L. japonica biomass into the solution, microwave pretreatment was adopted, and different dosage of H2SO4 was added to explore the effect of combined microwave-acid treatment on the saccharification of L. japonica. 2% H2SO4 pretreatment was also conducted as the only acid treatment control. Fig. 1 shows the changes of SCOD, polysaccharides, protein, reducing sugars and VFA in liquid phase after the pretreatment. It can be seen from Fig. 1a that SCOD was increased in all test groups, indicating microwave treatment at all H2SO4 doses were effective in disintegrating L. japonica biomass. Concentration of SCOD increased with the increased H2SO4 concentration from 0 to 1%, and highest SCOD of 5.12 g/L was obtained, which was 1.92-fold of control group. Then, with a further increase of H2SO4 to 2%, concentration of SCOD slightly decreased to 4.67 g/L. This may because of the higher H2SO4 concentration at higher temperature led to the mineralization of organic matters, especially the small molecules. As shown in Fig. 1c, VFA concentration increased with acid concentration during pretreatment process. Highest concentration of VFA was formed in 2% H2SO4 treated group, while concentration of VFA in combined microwave and 2% H2SO4 pretreated group was significantly lower, indicating that these small molecules were decomposed or volatilized during microwave pretreatment. Similar phenomenon was also observed by Park et al. (2013) and Jung et al. (2011a) hydrolyzed algae biomass with combined heat-acid treatment. Polysaccharides and protein are the main carbon source for biohydrogen production. Fig. 1b shows that polysaccharides were dominated by glucose and xylose. This is because that cellulose and hemicellulose are the main components of L. japonica (Shi et al., 2011). For the test group with sole microwave pretreatment, a decrease of polysaccharides concentration was observed. This may because the higher temperature and the chaotic movement of molecules caused by microwave led to the degradation of polysaccharides, forming acids or alcohols. As shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c, the concentrations of citrate, acetate and butyrate all increased after microwave pretreatment. This phenomenon indicated that although microwave pretreatment alone could increase the solubilization of algae biomass, the hydrolysis of polymeric compounds into sugars available for hydrogen production was not effective. Especially for the polysaccharides, the disintegration effect was not efficient enough to make up the consumption. Liu et al. (2016) also observed a decrease of polysaccharides when microwave pretreatment temperature was over 80 °C. Our previous study on the thermal pretreatment of waste activated sludge also showed a decrease of TCOD and polysaccharide (Yin and Wang, 2016b), indicating that polysaccharides are easily broken down at higher temperatures. In the case of protein, studies have found that proteins are more resistant to high temperature (Yin and Wang, 2016b). Thus, increased protein concentration was obtained. Similar phenomenon was also observed by Ebenezer et al. (2015) and Liu et al. (2016). As to the test groups with H2SO4 addition, significant increases of polysaccharides and protein concentrations were obtained. Polysaccharides concentration increased with the increased H2SO4 addition from 0% to 2%, and polysaccharides yield increased from 846.6 mg/L to 2098.2 mg/L. It can be seen from Fig. 1b that, with the addition of H2SO4, both glucose and xylose showed a significant increase. Glucose mainly comes from the hydrolysis of laminarin, glycogen, glucosyl–glycerol and trehalose, while xylose is derived from the hydrolysis of fucoidan (Xia et al., 2016). This indicates that acid can promote the algae cell disruption, and fucoidan can only be hydrolyzed in the acidic conditions. Xia et al. (2016) also found that xylose increased expressively with the increase of acid concentration, while heating temperature had little effect on xylose releasement from L. japonica. Kim et al. (2018) also reported the necessity of acid addition in hydrolyzing algae biomass. Sivagurunathan et al. (2017) studied different acids in hydrolyzing macroalgae, and H2SO4 showed the best saccharification effect. However, for the group with sole 2% H2SO4 pretreatment, concentration of polysaccharides, glucose, and xylose were all significantly lower than combined microwave and acid treated groups, indicating that both acid and microwave pretreatment are essential for the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose present in macroalgae biomass. To summary, SCOD concentration of pretreated L. japonica was significantly higher than that of raw macroalgae, which means that both microwave and acid pretreatment are effective in disrupting macroalgae cells. Concentrations of polysaccharides, protein and reducing sugars in combined microwave and acid pretreated groups were all significantly higher than groups with sole microwave or acid pretreatment, indicating that combined microwave-acid pretreatment is an efficient method for L. japonica disintegration, thus, enhancing the saccharification of L. japonica."
10,Biohydrogen production,"3.3 Biohydrogen production Fig. 2 shows the cumulative hydrogen production using differently treated macroalgae. It can be seen that hydrogen production in all test groups terminated in 26 h. Besides 2% H2SO4 pretreated group, hydrogen production in test groups were all enhanced compared with control group, indicating that it is difficult for the hydrogen producers to consume the intracellular components of macroalgae, and suitable pretreatment can effectively enhance the hydrogen production from L. japonica. Based on the data shown in Fig. 2, modified Gompertz model was used to fit the kinetic of hydrogen production, and the obtained results are listed in Table 2 . It can be seen that both highest cumulative hydrogen production and hydrogen production rate were obtained by combined microwave and 1% H2SO4 pretreated L. japonica, followed by test group with combined microwave and 0.5% H2SO4 pretreatment. In test groups with microwave and 0–1% H2SO4 pretreatment, hydrogen production potential and maximum hydrogen production rate increased with increasing SCOD after the pretreatment. As for the lag time, microwave pretreated macroalgae showed the longest lag time, which may because of the low polysaccharides concentration after the pretreatment, which is known to be easier biodegradable than proteins. The lag time of combined microwave and acid pretreated groups were all longer than the control group, which may due to the formation of inhibitors at higher temperature and higher Na+ concentration inhibition. Especially for the test group with 2% H2SO4 pretreatment, although it showed the best saccharification of L. japonica, hydrogen production in this group was significantly inhibited. This may because that high concentration of acid significantly stimulated the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, resulting in a quick release of glucose, xylose and arabinose (Fig. 1b). Then, the Maillard reaction and Caramellization happened at higher temperature during the microwave pretreatment, turning the reducing sugars together with proteins to inhibitive polymers, like furfuraldehyde (Lin et al., 2018). Besides, higher concentration of VFA can also cause the production of inhibiters (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, high acid concentration requires large amount of NaOH to neutralize the system. A suitable amount of Na+ can stimulate the hydrogen formation by promoting the formation of Fdred. However, a higher Na+ concentration above the inhibitory threshold level can form a high osmotic pressure outside the microbial membranes, which requires more energy for the hydrogen producers to balance the Na+ across cell membrane. In this case, metabolic pathways are changed to hydrogen consumption other than hydrogen production, resulting in suppression of biohydrogen production (Ding et al., 2017). Similar phenomenon was also observed by Xia et al. (2016) and Lin et al. (2018)."
11,Change of organic matters during hydrogen production process,"3.4 Change of organic matters during hydrogen production process Hydrogen accumulation is accompanied with the substrate degradation and liquid metabolites formation. The changes of polysaccharides, proteins and carbohydrate monomers were depicted in Fig. 3 . It can be seen from Fig. 3a that both polysaccharides and proteins were decreased in all test groups. Fig. 3b shows that glucose and xylose were completely degraded during the fermentation process, while glycerol was hard to be consumed. Degradation of glycerol relies on the specific enzymes glycerol dehydrogenase (Trchounian and Trchounian, 2015). Thus, microbes present in the system might lack the necessary enzymes, and were not able to use glycerol as carbon source. For the control test, a slight decrease of substrate was observed, this may due to the hydrolysis of raw macroalgae accompanied by microbial metabolism during the fermentation process. Fig. 3b shows that concentrations of both glycerol and citrate were increased significantly, further proved the metabolic hydrolysis of raw macroalgae. Similar phenomenon were also observed in studies produced hydrogen with raw waste activated sludge (Yin and Wang, 2015), raw grass (Yang and Wang, 2018a) and food wastes (Jang et al., 2015). It can be seen that highest substrate degradation rate was achieved in test group with combined microwave and 2% H2SO4 pretreatment, indicating more biodegradable carbohydrates were obtained after the treatment. High substrate degradation and low hydrogen production indicated that the high Na+ pressure suppressed hydrogen production through impeding the hydrogen-producing pathway other than inhibiting the microbial activities. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that although the detected carbohydrate monomers were mostly consumed, there were still a large amount of polysaccharides and proteins remained in the liquid phase after the fermentation process. This was mainly due to two reasons. On the one hand, a further metabolic hydrolysis of macroalgae during the fermentation process resulted in the continuous formation of soluble polysaccharides and proteins. On the other hand, although the treatment achieved an effective solubilization of macroalgae, most of the organic matters were still present as macromolecules or polymers, impeded its utilization by hydrogen producers. Similar problem also happens in hydrogen production systems with cellulose based biomass and waste activated sludge as substrate. Lots of efforts have been taken to shoot this problem, and found that both enhancing the biomass hydrolysis in the pretreatment process and during the fermentation process works (Yang and Wang, 2017). Phummala et al. (2014) found a combination of physical, chemical and biological treatment method can significantly enhance the hydrolysis of biomass. Ratti et al. (2013) enhanced hydrogen production and substrate degradation through the addition of specific enzymes into fermentation system, and hydrolysis was promoted during the fermentation process. Considering the low substrate degradation rate in all test groups, addition of enzymes are recommended to further promote the hydrolysis of algae biomass during the fermentation process, and thus enhancing the substrate degradation rate and hydrogen production simultaneously. Fig. 4 shows the formation of VFA during the fermentation process. The liquid metabolites contained acetate, butyrate and small amount of propionate and ethanol. It ca be seen that the metabolic pathways were affected by the pretreatment methods. Butyrate dominated in the test group with microwave treated macroalgae, while the other test groups were dominated by acetate. Indicating that hydrogen production from microwave treated L. japonica followed acetate-type fermentation while the other test groups were dominated by butyrate-type fermentation. This may due to the low polysaccharides content present in microwave treated algae biomass. It has been reported that both acetate/butyrate ratio and hydrogen yield are positively associated with polysaccharides/SCOD ratio (Yin and Wang, 2016b; Yin et al., 2018). Propionate concentration was significantly higher in test groups with 1% and 2% H2SO4 addition than other groups, which may be caused by the high Na+ pressure promoted the propionate formation pathway (Lee et al., 2012). As hydrogen production is accompanied with VFA formation, highest total VFA was obtained in the group with the highest cumulative hydrogen production. Many studies have come to the same conclusion (Yin and Wang, 2017; Yang and Wang, 2018b)."
12,Bacterial diversity analysis,"3.5 Bacterial diversity analysis The effects of pretreatment methods on hydrogen production, substrate degradation and energy conversion may due to the different microbial distributions present in different test groups. To assess the effects of pretreatment on the dominant microbial community of the hydrogen production system, samples from inoculum, control group, microwave treated test group and combined microwave-1% H2SO4 treated group were collected for microbial structures analysis. Table 3 shows the characteristics of bacterial phylotype diversity of 16S rRNA gene libraries. It can be seen that coverages of bacteria sequences in all the samples were over 0.99, indicating the analysis results were reliable. Shannon and Simpson are diversity indexes, a higher community diversity of a sample is indexed by a larger value of Shannon and a smaller value of Simpson. Ace and Chao are used to estimate the total number of species, a larger variety of species exist in a sample is shown by greater values of Ace and Chao. Test group with raw macroalgae owns both largest number of microbial species (3 8 2) and highest community diversity, which was even higher than the inoculum. Revealing there was rich microorganism present in raw macroalgae biomass. Higher microbial diversity was observed in combined microwave-1% H2SO4 treated test group than microwave treated one, which may because of the richer carbon sources present in combined microwave-acid hydrolysate. It has been reported that the microbial diversity is positively correlated with the richness of substrate compositions (Xiao et al., 2015). Fig. 5 shows the bacterial community and relative abundances by genus and species, respectively. It can be seen that for the inoculum, microbial community was diversely distributed. Sequences belonging to over 200 genus were detected, and no dominant microbial communities were formed. Then, after the fermentation process, sequences belonging to different genus became dominant in test groups with differently treated macroalgae. For the control test, microbial community was dominated by genus Enterococcus (49.2%), among which 46.6% was Enterococcus aquimarinus. For the microwave treated group, genus Alcaligenes became dominant and occupied 41.5%, followed by genus Bacillus and Clostridium, accounting for 31.6% and 11.2% respectively. When it comes to the combined microwave-acid treated group, genus Clostridium became dominant, occupied 31.7%. Besides, genus Bacillus (25.5%), Terrisporobacter (16.0%), Paraclostridium (11.2%) and Enterococcus (8.6%) were all abundantly present. Considering the hydrogen production obtained in Fig. 2, it can be seen that higher hydrogen yield was accompanied with the dominance of Clostridium spp. Many studies have reported the correlation between high hydrogen production and the dominance of Clostridium spp. (Im et al., 2012; Yin and Wang, 2016a). Genus Terrisporobacter and Paraclostridium were found to be dominant in combined microwave-acid treated group other than microwave treated group, which was because they are able to degrade xylose and glycerol (Deng et al., 2015). It worth mentioning that all the dominant genus and species come from the inoculum, indicating that the local microbes present in macroalgae were not adaptable in the fermentation system."
13,Energy conversion of fermentation,"3.6 Energy conversion of fermentation The energy conversion efficiency was calculated according to the ratio of the heating value in hydrogen and soluble metabolic products to the total heating value of the added substrates. As shown in Fig. 6 , in the first 4 groups, total energy conversion efficiency increased with the solubilization of macroalgae. Highest total energy conversion efficiency of 23.8% was obtained from the combined microwave and 1% treated H2SO4 macroalgae, which was 2.5 time of the energy conversion efficiency of the control test. Indicating that proper pretreatment can significantly enhance the energy conversion efficiency of the system. However, energy conversion efficiency of the test group with 2% H2SO4 was only half of the control test, which may because the high acid concentration and high salinity resulted in the formation of more undefined products. Although total energy conversion efficiency was enhanced after the treatment, over 70% of the total energy is still undefined. Besides the energy consumed for microbial growth and reproduction, most of the energy is still stored in the residual macroalgae. Thus, a more thorough disintegration of macroalgae may be required to further enhance the energy conversion efficiency, like accompanying the pretreatment with some mechanical treatment, like ultrasound, the addition of enzyme hydrolysis during the fermentation process (Wang and Yin, 2017; Wang and Yin, 2018). Among 23.8% of total energy conversion efficiency, only 3.4% of the total energy was converted into hydrogen, indicating that more energy was remained in liquid phase rather than gaseous hydrogen, like acetate and butyrate. In this case, multi-step conversion processes recovering energy from the liquid metabolites have great potential in enhancing the total energy recovery rate. Like the photo fermentative hydrogen production process or methane production process fed with the effluent from dark fermentation, microbial fuel cell or microbial electric cell turning acids and alcohols into hydrogen or electricity (Montiel Corona and Razo-Flores, 2018; Seifert et al., 2018). For example, it has been reported that through the photo fermentation, 1 mol acetic acid and butyric acid can be theoretically turned into 4 mol and 10 mol hydrogen, respectively (Xia et al., 2015)."
14,Conclusions,"In the present study, combined microwave-acid was adopted to disintegrate macroalgal cells of L. japonica. The results showed that pretreatment could effectively enhance the solubilization of L. japonica and release the organic matters. The highest hydrogen production of 28 mL/g TSadded was obtained from microwave-1% H2SO4 pretreated macroalgae. Metabolites analysis showed that the hydrogen production process followed acetate-type fermentation. Microbial community structure analysis revealed that both the dominance of genus Clostridium and higher microbial diversity contributed to a more efficient hydrogen production. Highest energy conversion efficiencies for total metabolites and hydrogen were determined to be 23.8% and 3.4%."
