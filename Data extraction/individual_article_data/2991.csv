0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been considered to be one of the ideal green energy carriers in the future. Much attention has been paid to finding ways to produce hydrogen from renewable energy sources such as the sun and wind. Hydrogen production from water by using semiconductors as photocatalysts provides a potential way to obtain hydrogen efficiently, due to its clean, low-cost and environmentally friendly production process by utilizing solar energy. Titania has been proved to be a promising photocatalyst material for applications in various fields such as dye-sensitized solar cells [1–3], hydrogen production [4–9] and purification of air and water [10–12]. During the past several decades, there have been extensive studies on TiO2 because of its nontoxicity, high chemical stability and low cost [13]. It is generally accepted that anatase TiO2 has higher photocatalytic activity than the other three polymorphs (rutile, brookite and TiO2 (B)) [14]. But its wide band gap of 3.2 eV limits its applications since it absorbs only ultraviolet (UV) light portion of the solar spectrum. Many efforts such as dye sensitization [15,16], doping with anion [11,17,18] or metal ion [19] and forming composites with other semiconductors [20,21] have been made to narrow the band gap of TiO2 and extend its absorption range into visible light region. Recently, it has been reported that carbon species incorporated in TiO2 can act as sensitizers [22–25]. Zhang et al. reported that graphite-like carbon over the surface of TiO2 can enhance the photocatalytic activity by expanding light absorption range into visible region and improving the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes [24]. Kado et al. prepared TiO2 nanotubes with the surface modified by a thin carbon layer, for which enhanced photoresponse was also observed as a result of the existence of the thin carbon layer [25]. Microspherical morphology has been reported to be beneficial to multiple reflections of the incident light, resulting in high photon absorption associated with light scattering [26,27]. As a result, microspherical TiO2 has attracted much attention due to its large specific surface area and high light absorption [28–30]. Many approaches such as sol-gel [28] and hydrothermal method [31] have been reported to prepare microspherical TiO2 particles. Tanaka et al. synthesized spherical titania photocatalysts in a non-aqueous system [28]. Luo et al. obtained rutile titania microspheres by a surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method [31]. All of the above methods involve emissions of organic reagents, cumbersome processes, and high-temperature treatment, which is not only energy consuming but also leads to fast growth of TiO2 nanocrystals. Recently, Huang et al. prepared microspherical TiO2 photocatalysts using an aerosol-assisted flow method. However, the method also involved special equipment and high temperature environment [32]. It is still necessary to develop more efficient approaches to synthesize microspherical TiO2 photocatalysts. In this work, we developed an easy and rapid technique to synthesize microspherical carbon-incorporated TiO2 powders by flame assisted hydrolysis of tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT). Influences of TBOT/ethanol ratio and solution volume on the morphology, phase composition and photocatalytic performance of the samples were investigated. The novel method shows several advantages over previous methods such as simple processing without any special equipment or setup, short reaction time without further high temperature treatment, and only one step to the final product. Moreover, such TiO2 can be easily recovered via sedimentation or filtration, which is also significant for photocatalytic water purification."
1,Experimental,"Carbon-incorporated TiO2 powders were prepared using tetrabutyl orthotitanate (CP, 98.0%, Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) and absolute ethanol (AR, Shanghai Zhengxing NO.1 Chemical Plant) as the starting materials. Typically, 5 mL tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT) was added into certain volume of ethanol in a beaker (150 mL) followed by stirring, with generating a stable and clear solution. The obtained clear solution was ignited by a burning match and the generated yellow flame soon spread over the whole liquid surface. The combustion process is gentle and gray powders can be obtained finally. During the process, tetrabutyl orthotitanate reacts with water from combustion of ethanol and the generated alcohols. We name it as flame assisted hydrolysis process. By changing the volume of ethanol, samples with the TBOT/ethanol volume ratio as 1:5, 1:7 and 1:12 were prepared, respectively. The obtained samples were labeled as TiO2 (1: x-v), where 1: x represents the TBOT/ethanol volume ratio and v is the volume of the solution. Obviously, the combustion time depends on the volume of solution. In order to further investigate the influence of solution volume, different volumes such as 10, 30, and 50 mL were applied with TBOT/ethanol ratio as 1:7, respectively. The obtained samples were denoted as TiO2 (1:7-v). The structure and phase composition of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D/8 advanced diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan rate of 10° min−1. N2 adsorption was used to measure the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area at −195.8 °C over a relative pressure ranging from 0.05 to 0.35. The morphologies and microstructures were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Philips XL30) and transmission electron microscope (TEM: JEOL JEM-2011, Japan). EDAX Genesis system was applied for the elemental analysis. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a RBD upgraded PHI-5000 C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Al/Mg Kα radiation with the binding energies calibrated based on the contaminant carbon (C1s = 284.6 eV). The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded using a Cary-50 Scan UV-Vis spectrophotometer in a region of 200 to 800 nm. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production was evaluated under simulated solar light condition. In a typical process, 0.05 g photocatalyst was dispersed in an aqueous solution (200 mL) containing 0.1 M Na2S and 0.04 M Na2SO3 in a 360 mL quartz reactor. The mixture was dispersed by ultrasonic stirring for 15 min, purged by N2 gas for 30 min, and then was irradiated under simulated solar light with magnetic stirring. The light was from a 500 W Xe lamp (CHF-XM35, Trusttech Co., Ltd. Beijing) with light intensity of 150 mW cm−2 measured by an optical power meter (1L1400A, International Light). The amount of H2 evolution was detected using a gas chromatograph (GC7900, thermal conductivity detector, molecular sieve 5 A, N2 carrier)."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Crystallinity and morphology of photocatalysts,"3.1 Crystallinity and morphology of photocatalysts The crystallinity and phase composition of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by XRD. The samples were determined directly without any post heat treatment. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the samples prepared with different TBOT/ethanol ratios. Compared with the XRD pattern of P25, it is interesting to find that all diffraction peaks of the samples are indexed to anatase phase of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 1. It should be reasonable to obtain anatase TiO2 since the temperature during the process may reach to 400 °C. The average crystal sizes of the TiO2 are listed in Table 1 , calculated from each (101) peak using Scherrer formula. It can be seen that the average crystal sizes of TiO2 are around 20 nm, indicating that the TBOT/ethanol ratio has little effect on the average crystal size of the obtained TiO2. Fig. 2 depicts the XRD patterns of the samples obtained with different solution volumes. Similarly, almost all the diffraction peaks of the resulted samples are ascribed to anatase phase. When the volume of the solution is 10 mL, only weak and small anatase TiO2 peaks are observed, suggesting that the synthesized sample is mainly amorphous. The diffraction peaks become much sharper with the volume of the solution increasing to 30, 40 and 50 mL, indicating that the crystallinity of TiO2 can be improved significantly by prolonging the combustion time. It is crucial to control the solution volume to obtain TiO2 with high crystallinity. Table 1 shows the BET specific surface areas and the corresponding combustion time of different samples. Specific surface area higher than that of P25 is measured for all the as-prepared samples. It can also be seen that the surface area of the samples is slightly influenced by TBOT/ethanol ratio, but significantly influenced by the solution volume. The S BET values of the samples prepared with different solution volumes decrease greatly when extending the combustion times, from 134.0 m2 g−1 to 72 m2 g−1 as shown in Table 1. It is clear to see that the combustion time has little effect on the crystal size of TiO2. It is probable that more combustion times can result in larger secondary particles, thus leading to decreased specific surface area. The following SEM results support the hypothesis. The morphology of the samples was characterized by FE-SEM. Though no template was used in the preparation process, it is interesting to observe microspheres with diameters of 0.5∼2.0 μm as shown in Fig. 3 . Moreover, the morphology of the samples was influenced by TBOT/ethanol ratio. A large amount of polyhedrons in addition to microspheres is observed when the TBOT/ethanol ratio is 1:5 as shown in Fig. 3a. Uniform TiO2 microspheres are observed when the TBOT/ethanol ratio is 1:7 (Fig. 3b). Further increasing the TBOT/ethanol ratio to 1:12 leads to the microspheres with poor size uniformity as shown in Fig. 3c. The results suggest that an optimal TBOT concentration is required to obtain uniform microspheres. The influence of solution volume on the morphology of the as-synthesized samples is also investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 , a lower size distribution of about 1∼1.5 μm is observed when the solution is 10 and 30 mL. Uniform TiO2 microspheres with average size of about 2.0 μm can be obtained when the solution reaches to 40 ml. With further increasing solution volume to 50 ml, some broken microspheres are observed (Fig. 4d). This result indicates that the solution volume can affect the formation and sizes of the microspheres. Fig. 4e shows the image of a microsphere under a high magnification. It can be seen that the microspheres are composed of closely packed TiO2 nanoparticles. The morphology of the obtained samples was further studied by TEM. The TEM images of the sample prepared with TBOT/ethanol ratio as 1:7 and solution volume as 40 mL are shown in Fig. 5 . Microspheres with average diameter of about 2 μm can be observed in Fig. 5a. As shown in Fig. 5b, it can be seen that the microsphere is composed of TiO2 nanoparticles. The results are in accordance with the SEM results. Fig. 6 shows the elemental analysis for the typical sample synthesized with TBOT/ethanol ratio as 1:7 and solution volume as 40 mL. The carbon content in the microspheres is 23 at% (atomic percent) on the surface (Fig. 6a) and 19 at% in the cross section (Fig. 6b), respectively. The result confirms the incorporation of carbon species into the titania microspheres, as a result of incomplete combustion of organic compounds."
4,Mechanism of the formation of TiO2 microspheres,"3.2 Mechanism of the formation of TiO2 microspheres The reactions involved in the TiO2 formation can be described as follows: (1) C2H5OH + O2 → CO2 + H2O (2) ≡Ti(OBu) + H2O → ≡Ti(OH) + BuOH (3) ≡Ti(OBu) + ≡ Ti(OH) → TiO2+ BuOH (4) ≡Ti(OH) + ≡Ti(OH) → TiO2 + H2O (5) BuOH + O2 → CO2 + CO + C + H2O At the very beginning, water is generated from ethanol combustion (Eq. (1)). Then, the TBOT molecules react with the generated water molecules (Eq. (2)), followed by simultaneous condensation (Eqs.(3) and (4)). TiO2 is formed and crystallized gradually with the assistance of the flame, which can provide a high temperature above 400° C. The gray color of the final product was mainly caused by insufficient combustion of butanol produced during the process (Eq. (5)). The incomplete reaction of condensation process can lead to the alkoxy residues. A nuclei-like growth mechanism is proposed to elucidate the formation of TiO2 microspheres. In the initial state during the combustion process, titania nuclei is inclined to form on the surface because the generated water molecules exists at the liquid/flame interface. The titania nuclei grow to anatase crystals with the assistance of the high temperature flame. After the initial period, the precipitated TiO2 nanoparticles are surrounded by the solution, where the reactions of hydrolysis and condensation of TBOT keep proceeding [32]. During the process, TiO2 spheres are gradually formed and grow until they are stable [33,34]. Some monospheres are fused together through subsequent precipitation during the particle growth. As a result, the obtained TiO2 powders consist of a great amount of neck-linked spheres [35]. This proposed microsphere growth process can well explain our experimental results. The whole formation process of TiO2 microspheres is illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
5,XPS and UV-Vis absorption results of photocatalysts,"3.3 XPS and UV-Vis absorption results of photocatalysts In order to study the binding states of Ti, C and O, the XPS spectra of two typical samples were measured as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7A shows the XPS of Ti 2p of the samples. Two peaks with binding energies of 458.6 eV and 464.34 eV are observed, which are attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 for Ti (IV) of the surface titania [36,37], respectively. Fig. 7B shows the XPS of C 1s core level of the samples. Three peaks occur at 284.6, 285.7 and 288.6 eV, respectively. The strong peak at 284.6 eV is assigned to elemental carbon, arising from the incomplete burning of organic compounds according to the proposed formation mechanism of TiO2 microspheres. The other two small peaks are assigned to C–O bonds [38,39], caused by the insufficient hydrolysis of TBOT. The peak ascribed to Ti-C bonds at around 281 eV has not been detected, indicating that almost no carbon is doped into the lattice of TiO2 [40,41]. Therefore, most of the carbon species incorporated in TiO2 matrix is present as elemental state, which is in line with the proposed mechanism of the formation of TiO2 microspheres. Fig. 7C displays the XPS of O 1s core level of the samples. Three peaks at 532.7, 531.2 and 530.0 eV can be identified for the sample with TBOT/ethanol ratio as 1:7 and solution volume as 10 mL, which are assigned to C–O, –OH on the surface of TiO2 and Ti–O–Ti, respectively [42–45]. Only two peaks occur at 531.5 and 530.1 eV for sample with TBOT/ethanol ratio as 1:5 and solution volume as 30 mL. According to the formation process of TiO2 microspheres, more C–O bond and hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2 (1:7-10) are probably caused by the incomplete hydrolysis and condensation of TBOT within a short combustion time (7 min, Table 1). The optical absorption properties of the samples are presented in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8A shows the UV-Vis absorption of the synthesized TiO2 with different TBOT/ethanol ratio. Enhanced light absorption intensity in the visible region can be seen clearly for the resulted carbon-incorporated TiO2 microspheres samples. It may be ascribed to the incorporation of carbon species, which can act as sensitizer like dyes [24,25]. Furthermore, a qualitative red shift is observed in the absorption edge of the TiO2 samples, which is probably caused by the interactions between the incorporated carbon species and TiO2 itself [46]. The absorption edge increases with increasing the TBOT/ethanol ratio, which are 415, 429, and 443 nm for TiO2 (1:12-65), TiO2 (1:7-40) and TiO2 (1:5-30), respectively. The fact is probably due to higher carbon incorporation, which is caused by higher TBOT concentration. Fig. 8B shows the influence of solution volume on the optical absorption properties of resulted TiO2. It is obvious that more intense and broad background absorption in the visible light region is observed for samples prepared with solution volume larger than 10 mL. Moreover, the absorption edges shift to longer wavelength with the increase of the solution volume. According to the proposed mechanism, it is probably due to the increased elemental carbon content along with longer combustion time."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by hydrogen evolution in the presence of Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial reagent under UV-Vis light. The life time of photoinduced electrons can be enhanced for that the reagent reacts irreversibly with photoinduced holes and/or photogenerated oxygen, thus increasing the hydrogen evolution rate which is produced by reactions between photoinduced electrons and water [47]. The results of photocatalytic hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 9 . Fig. 9A shows the effects of the TBOT/ethanol ratio on the photocatalytic activity. Higher photocatalytic activity is observed for the samples as compared to that of P25. The highest hydrogen production rate is 8.1 μmol·h−1, which is 1.8 times larger than that of P25 (4.5 μmol·h−1) and comparable to that of graphene/TiO2 composites reported in our previous work [4]. These results indicate that a proper TBOT/ethanol volume ratio can lead to a final product with excellent photocatalytic activity. It has been reported that the carbon residues in TiO2 are likely to carry out a charge transfer process and are responsible for the photosensitization of TiO2 [48]Furthermore, enhanced absorption behavior can be realized with the presence of large secondary colloidal spheres, resulting in higher photon absorption by way of light scattering [26]. Thus, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the samples can be ascribed to the sensitization effect of carbon, and high photon absorption associated with the microspherical structure of the samples [24,25,49]. Fig. 9B displays the effects of solution volume on the photocatalytic activity of the samples. The highest photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution is 8.1 μmol·h−1 for the sample TiO2 (1:7-40) prepared with 40 mL of solution. The hydrogen production rate decreases to 6.7 μmol·h−1 for the sample obtained with the solution volume of 50 mL. The results suggest that the solution volume can affect the photocatalytic activity of the resulted TiO2 photocatalysts. Much better photocatalytic performance is expected by introducing suitable dopant in the solution."
7,Conclusions,"We developed a novel flame assisted hydrolysis technique to prepare microspherical carbon-incorporated TiO2 photocatalysts. The new approach is featured with simple, rapid and energy-saving process. Anatase TiO2 microspheres with high photocatalytic performance can be obtained in one step without any post heat treatment. The crystallization degrees can be controlled by the TBOT/ethanol ratio and the solution volume. Enhanced light absorption and photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution are demonstrated for the resulted samples because of carbon incorporation and microspherical structure. A possible formation mechanism of TiO2 microspheres was also proposed. Furthermore, the technology developed in this work should be transferable to the fabrication of other metal oxides based on their corresponding metal precursors."
