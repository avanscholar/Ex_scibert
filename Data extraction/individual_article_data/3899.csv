0,Introduction,"Optically active halogenated aryl alcohols are useful and valuable intermediates in medicinal chemistry [1–5]. A case in point is (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol, which serves not only as a precursor of l-cloprenaline used for asthma treatment [6], but also as a chiral intermediate in the synthesis of thiophene-benzimidazole and imidazopyridine, which are promising PLK1 (serine-threonine kinase polo-like kinase 1) inhibitors for cancer therapy [7,8]. A popular route to obtaining enantiopure halogenated aryl alcohols is enantioselective reduction of the corresponding prochiral ketones using chemo-catalysts [9,10] or biocatalysts [2,11,12]. Except for very few successful examples, chemical processes employing heavy metals (iridium, rhodium, or ruthenium) as catalysts are commonly confronted with severe challenges, including low enantioselectivity, rigorous reaction conditions and poor environmental compatibility. In contrast, enzyme-catalyzed asymmetric reduction of ketones can perfectly solve these tough issues due to the inherent characteristics and advantages of biocatalysts [11,13,14], thus it may be an alternative to chemical methods. Several groups have attempted to develop biocatalytic processes for the preparation of halogenated aryl alcohols from the corresponding ketones [4,7,8,15–19]. One typical research was performed by Regina et al., who employed a xylose reductase from Candida tenuis (CtXR) for the asymmetric reduction of o-chloroacetophenone, using recombinant whole-cell catalysts co-expressing CtXR and FDH (formate dehydrogenase) for the recycling of NADH. Through a series of process optimizations, the substrate loading was improved from 100 to 300mM [8]. However, apart from a few reports [2,19], the often observed low tolerance of the enzymes for high substrate concentration and the low space-time yield of the biocatalytic reductions restrict the practical applications. It is still very important to search for new carbonyl reductases with higher catalytic efficiency and subsequently carry out biocatalytic reduction process at high substrate loading. Recently, we have isolated and identified a short-chain dehydrogenase, Gox2036 (denoted as GoCR in this study), from Gluconobacter oxydans, which could reduce a broad spectrum of prochiral ketones including α-diketones, hydroxy ketones, α-ketoesters, and β-ketoesters, as well as display preference for oxidation of secondary alcohols [20]. Here, we continue our studies toward the exploration of GoCR's application in asymmetric reduction of various halogenated acetophenones to produce the optically pure halogenated aryl alcohols at high substrate loading. To regenerate NADH in situ, a substrate-coupled system was constructed. Asymmetric reductions of o-chloroacetophenone and other halogenated acetophenones were subsequently investigated. Moreover, homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation were performed to explain the strict enantioselectivity of GoCR from the point of view of tertiary structure."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Halogenated acetophenones, isopropanol, NADH, NAD+ and (S)-1-(o-chlorophenyl)-ethanol of high purity (>98%) were purchased from Roche (Switzerland), Aladdin (China), or Accela (China). Other chemicals involved were of analytical grade."
3,Synthesis of racemic alcohols catalyzed by sodium borohydride,"2.2 Synthesis of racemic alcohols catalyzed by sodium borohydride Racemic alcohols were prepared through reduction of the corresponding prochiral ketones by sodium borohydride in an ethanol solvent. The reduction procedure was as follows: ketone (1g) was added dropwise to 65mL ethanol containing 5% (v/v) deionized water and 1g sodium borohydride. The mixture was stirred continuously for 1h at 4°C, followed by the addition of 1mL glacial acetic acid to terminate the reaction. After removal of the insoluble substances by filtration, the mixture was extracted with diethyl ether. The organic layer was then removed by rotary evaporation to obtain the final racemic alcohols."
4,Genes and strains,"2.3 Genes and strains Genomic DNA of G. oxydans strain 621H (GenBank accession number: CP000009) was used as template for the PCR clone of GoCR (locus_tag: GOX2036). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and pET-28a (Novagen) were used for overexpression of the recombinant GoCR. Molecular cloning, gene expression, and protein purification of GoCR were performed as described in our previous study [20]."
5,Enzyme assay,"2.4 Enzyme assay Enzyme activities of GoCR toward halogenated acetophenones were determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the change of NADH absorbance at 340nm on a SpectraMax 190 instrument (Molecular devices, USA), and a molar extinction coefficient of 6.22mM−1 cm−1 for NADH was used for the calculation [21]. The reaction mixtures (0.2mL) for enzyme assay consisted of 10μg purified enzyme, 100mM sodium phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 6.5), 0.2mM NADH and 10mM ketone substrates. All reactions were performed at 30°C and initiated by adding NADH. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1.0μmol NADH per minute. The concentration of protein was measured by the method of Bradford [22]."
6,Asymmetric reduction of halogenated aryl ketones by whole-cell catalysts,"2.5 Asymmetric reduction of halogenated aryl ketones by whole-cell catalysts 2.5.1 Preparation of whole-cell catalysts E. coli BL21 cells harboring pET28a-gox2036 (gene encoding GoCR) were inoculated into a 200mL LB medium (1% NaCl, 1% peptone, and 0.5% yeast extract) in a 500mL shake flask. Isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside (IPTG) was added at a final concentration of 0.25mM when the cell density at OD600 reached 0.6. After cultivation at 30°C for 10h, the induced cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000× g, 10min) at 4°C. Wet cells were washed twice in 20mM PBS (pH 7.4) before further use. 2.5.2 Reaction conditions To perform reduction reactions, 0.1g wet cells suspended in 100mM PBS (pH 6.5) were added to the reaction mixture containing substrates and co-substrates, to a total volume of 1mL. All reactions were performed as batch processes in 2mL Eppendorf tubes, on a rotary shaker at 200rpm for a period of time. Other reaction conditions including substrates (co-substrates) concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time were stated in the texts or footnotes of tables, respectively."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods After reaction completion, the mixture was extracted at least twice by n-hexane added in a 2:1 ratio. Centrifugation (12,396× g, 10min) was carried out to facilitate the phase separation. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4. Supernatant was then directly subjected to GC (Agilent 6890N) or HPLC (Agilent 1100) for determination of yield and ee value. Chiral HPLC columns OD-H and OB-H were purchased from Daicel Chemicals (Japan). Capillary columns CP-ChiraSil-Dex CB and DB-5 were purchased from Varian (USA) and Agilent (USA), respectively. The absolute configuration of the products was identified by comparing the chiral chromatographic data with the authentic standards or literature reports [15,23]. The details of GC and HPLC analysis were shown in Table S1 and Figs. S3–S11. The product of o-chloroacetophenone reduction was purified and subjected to GC–MS (Fig. S12) and NMR spectra assay (Fig. S13). Spectral data for (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol were as follows: 1H NMR (400MHz, CDCl3): δ =7.59 (d, J =7.8Hz, 1H), 7.33–7.22 (m, 2H), 7.21–7.17 (m, 1H), 5.29 (m, J =6.3Hz, 1H), 2.20 (br, 1H), 1.49 (d, J =6.3Hz, 3H); GC–EI-MS m/z (M+ 158, 156 for C8H9OCl) 141, 113, 77, 51, 43."
8,Molecular simulation experiments,"2.7 Molecular simulation experiments The initial homology model of GoCR with NADH embedded in was constructed using the Modeller 9.12 package. The crystal structure of l-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (l-BDH, PDB ID: 3A28) was chosen as template. Molecular docking was performed with the Autodock 4.2 program [24] using o-chloroacetophenone as the model ligand and GoCR-NADH complex as the receptor. The GoCR substrate-binding pocket was examined by comparison with the corresponding X-ray structures of l-BDH. To encompass the entire substrate-binding pocket, the searching grid box was set to a size of 50×50×50 grid points with a spacing of 0.375Å. The box center was set exactly at the OH atom of the catalytic residue Tyr155. Fifty possible docking conformations of ligands in receptors were obtained using the Lamakian genetic algorithm (LGA) with the maximum number of energy evaluation set to be 25,000,000. The resulting conformation of lowest binding energy in the largest cluster was chosen as the final solution. To obtain a more reasonable model, the docking solution was further subjected to energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation (MD) using the Gromacs 4.6 package with the ff99SB force field used for protein and general force field (gaff) for ligands [25]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Catalytic activities of GoCR on halogenated acetophenones,"3.1 Catalytic activities of GoCR on halogenated acetophenones A series of halogenated acetophenones with a single halogen substituent (F, Cl or Br) on different positions of the aryl ring were examined with the purified enzyme GoCR for the specific activity and enantioselectivity in the presence of cofactor NADH. As shown in Table 1 , all the tested ketones could be reduced by GoCR into the corresponding alcohols with >99% ee, following Prelog's rule with an S preference. However, because of the different electronegativity and van der Waals radii of F, Cl, and Br, GoCR exhibited different activities toward substrates with different substituents. For fluorine or chlorine substituents, GoCR showed better activities on ortho-substituted ones than meta- or para-substituted ones (1a>4a and 7a; 2a>5a and 8a). While on bromine substituents, it preferred para-substituted one (9a>3a and 6a). Overall, acetophenones with chlorine or bromine substituents were better catalyzed compared to fluorine-substituted ones. Among the nine tested substrates, GoCR showed the highest and lowest activity toward 2a (1.72U/mg) and 7a (0.09U/mg), respectively. These results revealed that the catalytic activity of GoCR was significantly influenced by the substrate structure and the electronic effects of relevant substituents."
11,Substrate-coupled system for cofactor regeneration,"3.2 Substrate-coupled system for cofactor regeneration To investigate the application potential of GoCR in the preparation of optically active halogenated alcohols, asymmetric reduction of o-chloroacetophenone (2a) by resting cells of E. coli overexpressing GoCR was chosen as the model reaction for further study. GoCR was demonstrated to be NAD(H)-dependent by our previous study [20]. But the high price of NADH makes its stoichiometric addition in a bioprocess impractical [26]. Therefore, the primary task was to construct an efficient system for in situ regeneration of NADH. GoCR could oxidize various alcohols with moderate to high activities. Accordingly, the construction of a simple and economical substrate-coupled system was attempted for NADH regeneration. The conversion rate of 2a was then determined in the presence of several alcohols to investigate their performance as co-substrates. As shown in Table 2 , the coupling of ethanol and n-propanol proved inappropriate for NADH regeneration, with the conversion of 2a increasing a little compared to the blank control. Glycerol has been reported to be metabolized by cellular enzymes of E. coli to release NADH, and can be used as a co-substrate with good performance [27]. However, its addition in the present process only resulted in a 17% conversion of 2a. Among the tested primary alcohols (or polyols), the best result came from 1,2-propanediol, with which a conversion of 77% was achieved. In contrast, the tested secondary alcohols (isopropanol, 2-butanol and 2-pentanol) showed the best results in facilitating the substrate conversion, and conversions of >97% were achieved within 6h. Isopropanol was finally chosen as co-substrate considering its low cost and the formed volatile acetone which could be easily removed from the reaction system."
12,Effect of isopropanol addition on o-chloroacetophenone conversion,"3.3 Effect of isopropanol addition on o-chloroacetophenone conversion Additionally, the effects of isopropanol concentrations on the conversion of 2a were investigated. A >98% conversion of 100mM 2a was unexpectedly achieved in the presence of 2.0eq. of isopropanol (200mM, equal to 1.5%, v/v) (Fig. 1 ). More isopropanol addition did not significantly increase the conversion, or even inhibited the conversion when the concentration exceeded 12eq. (ca. 10%, v/v) due to its toxicity on the enzyme. This is very different from that reported in literatures [12,28]. Typically, equilibrium constants around 1 are observed in enzymatic asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones because of the small thermodynamic driving force exerted by the reductant, resulting in unfavorable equilibria. Thus, 15–20molareq. (or even more) isopropanol has often been necessary to drive the main reaction to completion [12,28]. In the present reaction, however, 2.0eq. of isopropanol could drive the reaction to near completion. We speculated that there may exist an intramolecular hydrogen bond in product (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol between the new obtained alcohol moiety and the ortho-substituted electronegative group Cl. This hydrogen bond sharply lowered the Gibbs free energy of the product, resulting in a more favorable equilibrium constant for 2a reduction compared to other prochiral ketones. As a consequence, a slight excess of co-substrate isopropanol could shift the reduction of 2a to the alcohol product. Similar phenomena were observed by Wolfgang's group, who proved that the reduction of α-haloketones, such as chloroacetone and 1,3-dichloroacetone was a quasi-irreversible process because of the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in alcohol products [29]."
13,Biosynthesis of (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol at high substrate loading,"3.4 Biosynthesis of (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol at high substrate loading Based on the cofactor regeneration system established above, the substrate loading of 2a was increased to test the catalytic ability of GoCR. As shown in Table 3 , 200mM 2a could be reduced to (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol with >99% ee and a high conversion rate of 98% within 10h, in the presence of 100g/L wet recombinant cells and 2.0eq. (400mM) of co-substrate isopropanol. Under the same conditions, further increasing the substrate concentration to 500mM led to the decrease of conversion, but still gave a relative high conversion rate of 92% within 18h and had no effect on the product ee value (Table 3, entry 3). Extending the reaction time or increasing the isopropanol concentration to 2.5eq. (ca. 10%, v/v) could not improve the conversion (Table 3, entry 4; Fig. S2). The further increase of isopropanol concentration to 4.0molareq. (15%, v/v) led to a significant decrease of conversion due to its toxicity on GoCR (Table 3, entry 5). The decrease of substrate conversion at 500mM load may be ascribed to the enzyme inactivation caused by the high concentration of substrate and/or product. In addition, the reaction temperature may have played a role in the enzyme inactivation. Our previous study showed that GoCR displayed the maximum reaction activity at 30°C, but was more stable under lower temperature [20]. Therefore, the reduction of 500mM 2a was performed at 25°C. As expected, the substrate conversion was increased to 95% (Table 3, entry 6). This inspired us to further decrease the temperature to 20°C, and a conversion of 96% was finally achieved, affording 450mM (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol with >99% ee (Table 3, entry 7). Although further decrease of the temperature might lead to a complete conversion, too low temperatures are considered disadvantageous for industrial production [3]. Therefore, 20°C might be the best choice. During the bioprocess, GoCR showed strict enantioselectivity to afford only an S-configuration product, even under 500mM substrate loading. It should be noted that there was no need to add extra cofactor to the reaction system, indicating that the NAD(H) from the recombinant E. coli cells was competent for carrying out the reaction. This advantage makes the bioprocess more cost-effective. Several biocatalysts reported in recent years involving asymmetric reduction of o-chloroacetophenone were listed in Table 4 . In most cases, the product concentration was quite low when using wild strains (Rhizopus oryzae, Alternaria alternate and Candida pseudotropicalis) as catalysts. In contrast, recombinant E. coli cells dramatically improved the productivity while taking a shorter reaction time because of the overexpression of target enzymes. Regina et al. reported that E. coli cells overexpressing xylose reductase (CtXR) could reduce 300mM o-chloroacetophenone to (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol with 97% yield (291mM) and a space-time yield of 12.1mmol/L/h (Table 4), using enzyme-coupled (CtXR and FDH) cofactor regeneration approach in an aqueous/n-hexane (4:1) biphasic system. In our study, using substrate-coupled (ketone and isopropanol) cofactor regeneration approach, 450mM (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol with >99% ee was synthesized via GoCR-mediated reduction of o-chloroacetophenone at 500mM substrate loading in an aqueous medium, and the space-time yield reached 25mmol/L/h, which was about two times higher than that of the CtXR-mediated process."
14,Asymmetric reduction of other halogenated acetophenones by recombinant E. coli cells overexpressing GoCR,"3.5 Asymmetric reduction of other halogenated acetophenones by recombinant E. coli cells overexpressing GoCR GoCR-mediated asymmetric reductions of other halogenated acetophenones (1a, 3a–9a) were also investigated. In the presence of isopropanol as co-substrate, moderate to high conversion (71–96%) and excellent enantioselectivity (>99% ee) were obtained for different substrates without external NAD(H) addition (Table 5 ). Among them, substrates 1a and 3a showed the best results, and 200mM substrates were converted with a conversion of 94% and 96%, respectively. It should be noted that this enzymatic process was superior to many other reported cases [15,17,18,30]. Ling et al. reported that a carbonyl reductase from Sporobolomyces salmonicolor could reduce several halogenated acetophenones to corresponding alcohols [17], but the enzyme activities were poor and products ee were also low (14–66%). Namudar et al. reported the asymmetric reduction of halogenated acetophenones by Cryptococcus laurentii [15]. Though alcohol products with high ee were acquired, the substrate concentration in the reactions was low (<20mM). In contrast, GoCR could reduce various halogenated acetophenones to S-alcohols with high substrate loading and excellent enantioselectivity, making it a more competitive and promising biocatalyst for the preparation of optically pure halogenated 1-phenylethanols."
15,Structural basis for the high enantioselectivity of GoCR,"3.6 Structural basis for the high enantioselectivity of GoCR GoCR presented excellent Prelog-selectivity toward the tested substrates, resulting in only S-configuration alcohols even at high substrate concentration. To explore the substrate conformation in the binding pocket and gain insights into the high selectivity of GoCR, homology modeling and molecular docking were performed. The crystal structure of l-BDH was chosen as homology template because of its high amino acids sequence identity (50%) to GoCR [31]. The Ramachandran plot of the resulting model showed that 92% of the residues were in the most favored regions, with 100% in allowed regions (Fig. S14), demonstrating the validity of the model. Model substrate o-chloroacetophenone was then docked into the binding pocket of the initial homology-modeled GoCR-NADH binary complex followed by energy minimization and a 2ns-long production MD simulation to refine the structure. As shown in Fig. 2A, GoCR adopts a typical Rossmann-fold conformation, in which a seven-stranded central β-sheet is surrounded by eight α-helices. Cofactor NADH is bound to the enzyme in an extended conformation at the carboxyl ends of the central parallel β-sheet. The overall conformation of the GoCR-NADH complex is similar to that found in other SDR (short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily) members [32]. o-Chloroacetophenone is embedded into a hydrophobic cavity mainly consisting of Ile143, Tyr149, Leu152, Trp193 and Tyr215. Its carbonyl oxygen atom forms hydrogen bonds with both Tyr155 and Ser142 (Fig. 2B). These two hydrogen bonds are thought to be indispensable for the catalytic activity of SDR [21]. Meanwhile, the nicotinamide mononucleotide ring of NADH is located on the re face of o-chloroacetophenone (Fig. 2C). According to these simulation results, the mechanism of the GoCR-mediated enantioselective reduction process was proposed to be as follows: the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate is protonated by the Tyr155 residue, and stabilized by Ser142 through hydrogen bonds interaction. Then, constrained by the relative positions of NADH and o-chloroacetophenone, C4 hydrogen atom of cofactor NADH can only attack the carbonyl carbon of the substrate from its re face (following Prelog's rule), resulting exclusively in the S-configuration product. This is quite consistent with our experimental data. Besides, from the complex conformation, we know very intuitively the interaction mode between substrate and the surrounding residues in the binding pocket of GoCR (Fig. 2B). Among all the residues, Trp193 is positioned close to the benzene ring of o-chloroacetophenone, resulting in a van der Waals interaction potential calculated to be −15.2kJ/mol. This interaction is the strongest among all the single-point interactions between substrate and surrounding residues (Fig. 3 ), implying that Trp193 is crucial for substrate binding and its substitution by other residues might significantly influence the enzyme function. Crystal structure determination of GoCR is underway in our lab to explore the substrate binding mechanism in detail. Further work including rational design and mutation on GoCR to engineer the activity are also in progress."
16,Conclusion,"Carbonyl reductase GoCR from G. oxydans could reduce a series of halogenated acetophenones with substituents on different positions of the aryl rings, affording only S-configuration alcohols. Among the tested ketones, the resting cells of recombinant E. coli expressing GoCR showed the best reactivity to o-chloroacetophenone, and 450mM (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol could be produced in 18h with excellent enantioselectivity (ee >99%), employing isopropanol as co-substrate to regenerate NADH. Compared to many other reported cases, our research presents a simpler and more efficient bioprocess for the preparation of (S)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-ethanol at high substrate loading. The substrate concentration may be further improved if molecular engineering of GoCR was performed to improve its catalytic activity to halogenated acetophenones."
