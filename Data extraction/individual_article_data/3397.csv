0,Introduction,"The number of gasoline run cars is increasing in leaps and bounds every day. Octane number is an important parameter that measures the gasoline engine performance. The octane number of gasoline is upgraded by blending some octane boosters like toluene, isooctane, Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), triptane, ferrocene, pyrolysis gasoline (Py Gas) etc. But some of these octane boosters are toxic [1,2]. Py gas is a byproduct during the production of olefin from Naphtha Cracker Unit (NCU). It has high octane number. It is a mixture of paraffins (cyclohexane, pentane,cyclopentane), olefins (1-octene, hexene, 1,3 butadiene, 1,3 pentadiene) and aromatics (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene) [3–5]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) confirmed that benzene, 1,3 butadiene and 1,3 pentadiene are carcinogenic compounds [6]. According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Motor Source Air Toxics (MSAT), the benzene specification of gasoline is limited to 0.62–1.3 vol%. On the other hand, Py gas contains more than 40 vol% of benzene [7]. So, it is very important to separate benzene from Py gas before blending with gasoline as octane improver, otherwise emission of benzene along with the unburnt hydrocarbons from vehicles can adversely affect the environment. The conventional separation processes of benzene from Py gas are catalytic hydrogenation and solvent extraction. But both of them are cost intensive [3,5,8]. Recently, membrane technology has gained considerable importance in the field of separation of aromatics/aliphatics mixture. One of the popular membrane technologies is Pervaporation (PV). PV is relatively simpler and eco-friendly compared to its conventional counterparts. PV is a unique membrane separation process which is combination of membrane permeation and downstream evaporation for separation of liquid mixtures by partial vaporization [9]. Polyvinyl alcohol based membranes was used for the separation of benzene/cyclohexane mixtures through PV process by several researchers [10–15]. Yamasaki and co-workers prepared PVA based homogeneous and asymmetric membranes for separation of benzene/cyclohexane and benzene/n-hexane mixtures via PV. According to them, both membranes were benzene selective due to the high interaction of the hydroxyl groups (–OH) in PVA and π-electrons in benzene. The asymmetric PVA membrane had higher selectivity towards benzene than the homogenous membrane but the permeation flux, were almost same for both [16]. Khazaei et al. fabricated polyvinyl alcohol/grapheme oxide (PVA/GO) membrane for the pervaporative separation of toluene/iso-octane mixtures. They saw that the interaction between toluene and GO increases through s and π-π bonds by adding 0.5 wt% GO in PVA matrix [14]. Koval and co-researchers synthesized PVA containing silver nitrate (AgNO3) membrane for separation of benzene/cyclohexane mixtures. The permeation flux for benzene was 0.5–5.5 kg.μm m−2.h−1 and the selectivity range was 51–84. This type of membrane was also used for the pervaporative separation of butene/n-butane, arenes/aliphatics [17]. Khatinzadeh et al. studied the influence of temperature and pressure on a composite membrane of PVA on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) support layer for the removal of benzene from gasoline. The permeation flux was observed to increase from 51.7 to 79 g/m2/h with increasing temperature (25–35 °C) and decreasing pressure (30–3 mmHg) [18]. The aim of this work is to separate benzene from model Py gas (benzene/1-octene mixture) by using in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane via PV. The PV efficiency of this membrane is calculated in terms of permeation flux and separation factor."
1,Experimental,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were supplied by Merck Pvt. Ltd, India and PVA was bought from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd., India for the fabrication of membrane. Benzene and 1-octene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA."
3,Membrane preparation,"2.2 Membrane preparation 5 g PVA was dissolved in 20 ml hot (at 353 K) distilled water then 0.1 mg AgNO3 was added to this mixture by using magnetic stirrer for 1 h. Then 1 mg NaOH was added to this PVA-AgNO3 solution as a reducing agent to produce Ag (0). Here, PVA acted as a stabilizing agent for the synthesis of Ag (0) and also a base material to prepare the membrane solution. Ag/PVA mixture was prepared and spread on a petri dish. The mixture was dried at room temperature for 2 days. After drying, the membrane was ready for PV. Fig. 1 represents the schematic diagram of the process of fabrication of membrane and Fig. 2 is the photography of membrane."
4,PV process,"2.3 PV process The PV process was carried out by a batch set up (Fig. 3 .) in laboratory scale. The PV set up is equipped with a stainless steel permeation cell where Ag/PVA membrane was mounted on a porous metal plate, a stainless steel feed agitator, a band heater, cold trap for collection of permeate via a vacuum pump during PV operation. The band heater was connected to a temperature sensor for the controlling and recording the operating temperature. The vacuum pump was assembled with Mcleod gauge for measuring the operating pressure. Here, the permeate was condensed in the cold trap placed in liquid nitrogen. The effective operational area of the membrane was 38.32 × 10 - 4 m 2 . The range of operational temperature was 303 K to 343 K with a downstream pressure of 1 mm Hg. The feed composition was varied from 30 vol% to 70 vol% of benzene in benzene/1-octene mixture. The PV experiment was not continued above 343 K due to evaporation loss. After PV experiments, permeates and retentates were analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC) (TRACE 1300, USA). The following equations (i), (ii) and (iii) were used to calculate the permeation flux, separation factor and % removal of benzene [19,20], (i) J = Q At where, J is the permeation flux (Kg.m-2h−1), Q is the total mass (g) of permeate collected, A is the effective area of membrane (m2), t is operational time (h) (ii) β AB = P A / P B F A / F B (iii) % r e c o v e r y o f A = F A - R A F A × 100 where, β AB is separation factor, PA represents the mass (g) of component A in permeate, PB represents the mass (g) of component B in permeate, FA denotes the mass (g) of component A in Feed, FB denotes the mass (g) of component B in Feed, RA represents the mass (g) of component A in retentate. Here, A represents benzene and B represents 1-octene."
5,Membrane characterization,"2.4 Membrane characterization The membrane was characterized by its swelling behavior, SEM and FTIR. The swelling behavior was tested to determine the interaction between the feed mixture (benzene/1-octene) and membrane. 0.5 g of dry membrane strips were immersed in feed (composition varied from 0 to 100 vol% benzene in benzene/1-octene mixture) at 313 K. Gently, these swollen strips were taken out from the feed mixtures and the excess liquid was removed by wiping with blotting paper. Immediately, the strips were weighed and it was done repeatedly at fixed time intervals until a constant weight of the swollen membrane was obtained. The % swelling can be calculated by the following equation (iv) [21], (iv) % S w e l l i n g = D m - S m D m × 100 where, D m is the weight of dry membrane (g), S m is the weight of swollen membrane (g) The surface morphological structure of nano Ag solution, PVA membrane (without Ag) and Ag/PVA membrane were determined using SEM, (ZEISS EVO18, Germany) which was equipped with ion sputter E1010. The cross sectional structures of PVA membrane and in-situ nano Ag/PVA were also analyzed using SEM. All the samples were silver coated before the SEM experiment. The functional groups of PVA and in-situ nano Ag/PVA were examined by NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrometer, USA. From FTIR, the bond interaction between PVA and nano Ag in in-situ Ag/PVA membrane were determined. The applied spectrum range was 4000–400 cm−1."
6,Results and discussion:,
7,Swelling behavior of in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane,"3.1 Swelling behavior of in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane The PV mechanism is controlled by the sorption of the feed components in the specified membrane [22]. The theory of solubility states that higher penetrating components have greater sorption into the membrane [23]. In this work, the percentage swelling of membrane was observed to increase with time as a function of feed concentration (volume % of benzene in feed mixture). From Fig. 4 it is clear that percentage swelling of in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane increases with increasing concentration of benzene upto 30 h and after this time no further increase in swelling is observed, i.e. equilibrium swelling is achieved. From this swelling study, it may be concluded that in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane will allow benzene to permeate in preference to 1-octene."
8,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),"3.2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Fig. 5 (a), (b), (d) represents the surface morphological structure of nano Ag, PVA membrane and in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane and Fig. 5 (c), (e) represents the cross-section of the PVA membrane and in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane. From Fig. 5(a), the size of Ag is 95 nm. The PVA and in-situ nano Ag/PVA is clearly distinguished by their SEM as well as cross sectional images. From Fig. 5 (d) and (e), it is clear that nano Ag has been well distributed in the PVA matrix to form a composite membrane."
9,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The FTIR spectra of PVA and in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane are depicted in Fig. 6 . The IR peak of PVA membrane at 3428 cm−1 indicates the –OH stretching whereas for in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane, –OH stretching is obtained at 3420 cm−1. This bond is shifted due to the generation of nano-Ag in PVA pristine and also due to interaction between nano-Ag and –OH group of the PVA matrix. A noticeable peak of PVA membrane and in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane are observed at about 2924 cm−1 and 2926 cm−1 for –CH stretching respectively. Additionally distinguishable peaks of PVA matrix and in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane are also obtained at about 1630 cm−1 and 1632 cm−1 for -C = C stretching respectively. The bonds are slightly shifted in the range of 1700–1500 cm−1 for in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane perhaps because of the breaking of the –CH bonds present in –CH2 linkages of PVA and due to the generation of new interactions in the polymer matrix. The –CH symmetric bending of –CH2 stretching is assigned to the peak at about 1384 cm−1 for PVA membrane as well as in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane. The IR spectra of PVA membrane and in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane is obtained at about 1126 cm−1 and 1124 cm−1 for –COH stretching respectively. The IR peak of PVA matrix and in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane are shown at about 848 cm−1 and 842 cm−1 for –CH bond deformation respectively. A notable new band at around 630 cm−1 for the nano Ag/PVA spectrum corroborates the interaction between nano-Ag and PVA matrix resulting from hydrogen bond formation [24–26]."
10,Permeation flux (J),"3.4 Permeation flux (J) The permeation flux (J) was calculated using GC analysis to draw a graph (Fig. 7 .) i,e Total flux (Kg/m2/h) vs Temperature (K). It is evident from Fig. 7 that the total permeation flux increases with increasing temperature as a function of concentration (volume %) of benzene in feed mixture and finally reaches a maximum value at about 343 K. This type of behavior has been reported by previous researchers [14,18,27,28]. The increase of total permeation flux with increasing temperature may be due to the increase in the chain mobility of the polymeric matrix [29] thereby creating free volumes in the membrane matrix which results in greater diffusion of the permeating species through the PVA membrane [19]. According to solution-diffusion theory, the driving force for the separation of any mixture using PV technique is due to the difference in chemical potential gradient of the feed components between the feed side and permeate sides in terms of solubility and diffusivity [24,30]. In the present investigation it was observed that permeate was benzene rich compared to retentate, or in other words the in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane is more permeable towards benzene. It may be due to the d-π interaction between metallic silver and benzene [31]. From Fig. 8 , it is evident that separation factor decreases with increasing temperature and also increasing concentration (volume %) of benzene in feed mixture; probably due to increased swelling of the membrane at higher temperature as well as increasing feed concentration, allowing permeation of 1-octene along with benzene. The maximum separation factor (6.82) is obtained at a temperature of 303 K with a feed mixture containing 30 vol% benzene. Similar results have been reported by previous researchers [19,32]. The % removal of benzene from model Py gas is 67% using in-situ Ag nano/PVA membrane."
11,Conclusions,"The debenzenation of Py gas is an important issue in petroleum industries. In this study, in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane was fabricated using a relatively straight forward method and characterized by SEM, FTIR as well as swelling behavior study. The membrane was utilized for the separation of benzene from model Py gas applying PV technique. From SEM analysis, it may be inferred that the fabricated membrane is dense. There are some interactions between Ag nanoparticles and PVA matrix of the membrane which is somewhat evident from FTIR data. From swelling behavior, it is inferred that the in-situ nano Ag/PVA membrane has greater affinity towards benzene than 1-octene. The highest permeation flux achieved is 4.05 Kg.m−2.h−1 for 70 vol% of benzene in feed at 343 K and 1 mm of Hg pressure. The highest separation factor achieved is 6.82 at 303 K and 1 mm of Hg. The benzene removal efficiency of this membrane is 67%."
