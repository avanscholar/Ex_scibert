0,Introduction,"Immobilization of a catalytic particle onto polymer support may add some extra improved catalytic performance to particles thanks to potentially multi phases consist of specific area, selective sorption and transferring properties of polymer structure [1,2]. Catalytic oxidations of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones are important initial steps for synthesis of fine chemicals [3]. At homogeneous synthesis route chromium (VI), permanganate, dimethyl sulfoxide and periodate were used as a catalyst and good yield was obtained [4], but some problems emerging with using mentioned reactants at stoichiometric ratio such as corrosion of reaction cup, high cost, separation and regeneration difficulty, adverse effect of toxic chemicals to environment and living, the expectations have been focused on the developing of green, protective and high yield processes [5]. As a result of increasing awareness and demand for useful reaction components and systems, solid catalyst was explored and it has been developing continuously. Support materials may improve catalyst activity beside easy separation from the reaction mixture as Min and coworkers reported that improving effect of SiO2 for Pd catalyst [6]. Bansal et al. were used Cu-Ni doped complex catalyst supported with Zeolite-Y [7]. Manganese oxide combined with activated carbon was used for benzyl alcohol oxidation and other reactions thanks to its multi number oxidation states [8,9]. Ammonium molibdate salts [10], titanium dioxide [11], bare manganese oxide [12] solid catalysts also were used as heterogeneous catalyst for different kinds of applications. Even if supported catalyst materials have high activity with their very small particle size called as micro or nano structures, problems during the separation are inevitable. Controllable pore size, pore distribution and surface chemistry made polymers preferable for catalysis as support material which provide easy separation without any loss of performance [13]. PVDF which has high mechanical and chemical resistance polymer consist of 50%–70% crystal forms called as α (alpha), β (beta) and γ (gamma) mainly [14]. It was used as a support material for Fe/Pd metal catalysts couple [15]. Properties of magnetic Fe nanoparticle loaded PVDF composite capsules such as effective separation of substrate and conversion of organic waste, easy separation without solvent, reusability and low cost made polymer support advantageous and benign support materials for green synthesis prospects [16]. Fe3O4 anchored PVDF membranes were also prepared and used at filtration process, and it was also preferred as filtration pervaporation systems [17]. Pd/Fe-PVDF was used for trichloride acetic acid removal [18]. Fe-zeolites/PVDF and CuO-PVDF were used to oxidize benzene and benzyl alcohol with H2O2 [19,20]. The hydrophobic nature of PVDF facilitates easy transfer of organic phases to active sites of catalyst in addition to its supporting mission for catalyst [21]. Advantageous of catalyst embedded polymeric structures can be associated with filtration application to obtain in-situ production of fine chemicals during the filtration. Thus, fast and low cost processes could be developed. Different type of catalytic reactors such as photo catalytic, submerged and bioreactors are available and those are combination of filtration membranes and catalyst which provide easy reaction, quick separation and reusability [22]. To improve the yield of a reaction system, parameters such as reactant concentration, temperature, reaction time and others should be adjusted appropriately. For the filtration processes, membrane filtration properties should be evaluated in addition to catalytic performances. In this study, preparation and characterization of magnetic Fe3O4 loaded PVDF composites were conducted as a candidate of green synthesis route. For the first time, filtration properties of Fe3O4 blended PVDF membranes were simultaneously investigated with the performances of those on benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde in microwave assisted oxidation conditions. According to our knowledge, catalytic activity of polymer supported magnetic particles (Fe3O4-PVDF) for benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde in microwave conditions was firstly reported with this study in terms of cost effective, fast and easily separable green catalyst properties. Filtration performances and alcohol oxidation activities of prepared membranes were evaluated at different test process. Encouraging results were obtained to combination of Fe3O4-PVDF filtration membranes in catalytic reactor systems at microwave conditions."
1,Materials and Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Due to its high chemical, physical and thermal durability of polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF (Solef 6010, obtained from MINGER) was used as the polymer material without any purification. N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF (73.09 g·mol−1, 0.944 g·ml−1 Sigma Aldrich) was used as solvent. Nonsolvent was double distilled water. For the synthesis of magnetic particles, FeCl2 (126.75 g·mol−1, 98%), FeCl3 (162.20 g·mol−1, 98%) and ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH (35.05 g·mol−1, 26%, d: 0.91 g·ml−1) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Benzyl alcohol (108 g·mol−1, 1.05 g·ml−1) and hydrogen peroxide (34.01 g·mol−1, 30% w/v) were purchased from Merck and Panreac Company. Bovine serum albumin, BSA (MW: 66000, ≥98% purity, Sigma Aldrich), was used to prepare model protein solution with boric acid, H3BO3 (61.83 g·mol−1, Sigma-Aldrich), phosphoric acid, H3PO4 (98 g·mol−1, Sigma-Aldrich) and acetic acid, CH3COOH (60.05 g·mol−1, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) as pH adjustment chemicals."
3,Preparation of magnetic Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF membranes,"2.2 Preparation of magnetic Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF membranes Preparation of magnetic Fe3O4 was conducted as reported by Mandel et al. [23]. A mixture of Fe (II) and Fe (III) 1:2-mol ratio was prepared. Solution was heated to 70 –80 °C. Until to pH: 12, ammonium hydroxide was added. Black precipitates were separated by magnet and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. To obtain Fe3O4-PVDF, Fe3O4 and PVDF (1.6 g in 10-ml DMF) solutions were prepared at separate cups. Then Fe3O4 in DMF according to 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% mass ratio was added to PVDF solution at 50 °C (Table 1 ). Before addition Fe3O4 solution was waited in ultrasonic bath during 10 min to provide homogeneous dispersion. The mixture of PVDF/DMF/Fe3O4 was stirred at 250 r·min−1 at 65 °C for 12 h to provide homogeneous dispersion of particles. Dope solution was waited for 10 min to avoid air bubbles during the process and casted on to glass plate (15 cm × 15 cm). It was spread to surface uniformly by casting knife with a knife gap of 300 μm at 25 °C. After exposure to air for 25 s, the glass plate was quickly immersed into distilled water bath. Another water cup was used to keep the temperature in balance. Representative illustration of preparation was given at Fig. 1 . Membranes prepared by phase inversion were dried and used for characterization and oxidation experiments. Filtration membranes were stored in distilled water until the filtration experiments. Prepared PVDF-metal oxide composites contain 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% Fe3O4 mass ratio were defined as PVDF, F2-P, F4-P, F6-P and F8-P respectively."
4,Characterization of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF membranes,"2.3 Characterization of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF membranes Samples were analyzed by XRD (Rigaku 2000) to understand crystal structure of composites and powder, at 2θ:2°–70° with 2 (°)·min−1 scanning speed. Perkin Elmer FTIR over a range of 4000–400 cm−1 was used to analyze functional groups and Seiko Exstar 7200 thermal analyzer (TG and DTA) was used to measure thermal stability of samples. The morphologies were examined by scanning electron microscopy at 10 kV (Carl Zeiss ULTRA Plus). Membranes were firstly broken in liquid nitrogen, and cross-section images were photographed. The surface wettability and hydrophilicity of membranes was investigated by static contact angle analyzer (KSV Attention, Finland) at room temperature. Sessile drop method was used, and average value was calculated by at least four different measurements of each membranes. Germany). Gas chromatography with HP5 column (Agilent 6890) was used for analysis of organics. One microliter of mixture was injected, and it was analyzed at 100 °C (5 min wait), 180 °C (5 min wait) and 220 °C (2 min wait). Concentration of BSA used as a model pollutant to determination of rejection performances of membranes. It was measured by UV–visible spectrometer (PG instruments, T80) at 280-nm wavelength. To determine water uptake capacity (WU), membranes stored in water were weighted (W w) after mopping slightly with blotting paper. Wet membranes were dried in 40-°C vacuum oven for 2 h, and dry membranes were weighted (W d). By using wet and dry masses of membranes, water uptake capacities were calculated by Eq. (1). (1) WU = W w − W d W w × 100 % Membrane porosity (PO) was calculated by mass of wet and dry membranes [21,28]. Following Eq. (2) was used for porosity calculation. (2) PO = W w − W d dAδ × 100 % where d is the density of water used at 25 °C; A is membrane area in wet state (cm2), and δ is the thickness of membrane in wet form (cm)."
5,"Pure water flux, protein rejection and antifouling performances of membranes","2.4 Pure water flux, protein rejection and antifouling performances of membranes Pure water permeability (PWP) of prepared membranes was measured by collecting permeated distilled water (L·m−2·h−1) at ultra-filtration cross-flow membrane cell. Transmembrane pressures (TMP) were adjusted as 200 kPa after pre-conditioned of membranes for 1–3 h. PWP was calculated by Eq. (3). (3) PWP = V At where V is volume of permeate (L); A is membrane area in square meter (1.7 × 10−3 m2), and Δt is the sampling time (h). Compaction factor (CF) was calculated to get information about physical resistance of membranes by dividing of initial PWP value to constant PWP value. BSA was used as a model pollutant to understand rejection performances of membranes. For this 0.5 g·L−1 aqueous BSA solution was prepared with phosphate buffer solution (0.01 mol·L−1, pH:7.4) and filtered at 200 kPa. Permeate was collected and BSA concentration was measured by UV-spectrophotometer, and rejection capacity was calculated by Eq. (4). (4) BSA = 1 − C p C f x 100 % where C p and C f are the concentration of protein in permeate and feed solutions respectively. After BSA filtrated membranes were washed, they were immersed in distilled water for 20 min. Then PWP values of cleaned membranes were measured. Flux recovery percentages of membranes (FRR) were calculated by Eq. (5). (5) FRR = PWP 2 PWP 1 × 100 % where PWP1 is pure water flux values of membrane before BSA filtration, and PWP2 is the pure water flux of BSA rejected and cleaned membrane. The thickness of the dried and wet membranes was tested by thickness measuring instrument (Hornbach, 0.25 mm to 0.01 mm range)."
6,Catalytic activity experiments,"2.5 Catalytic activity experiments Catalytic activities of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF were investigated under the conditions of batch reactor. Before using, 0.02 g Fe3O4-PVDF membrane pieces (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) were kept in benzyl alcohol for 1 h at room temperature to provide sufficient diffusion of substrate inside the membrane pores. Catalytic pieces were put in to 50-ml flask with 1-mmol benzyl alcohol and 1-mmol H2O2. Mixture was placed to microwave oven powered 500 W for 8 min. Sample taken by micro syringe was analyzed with GC (without any filtration). Catalytic pieces were washed with acetone and pure water. They were reused there times after dried. Catalytic activity of samples was reported as conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity according to following Eqs. (6) and (7) [8]. Powder Fe3O4 was used as a catalyst at the same reaction conditions of Fe3O4-PVDF. Sample taken from powder catalyst was filtered by syringe filter before injection to column.

7,Results and Discussion,
8,Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF characterization,"3.1 Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF characterization The X-ray diffraction patterns of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVDF were shown in Fig. 2 . Diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 30.1°, 35.4°, 43.2°, 56.9° and 62.6° indicated to presence of magnetite form Fe3O4 [25,26]. Fe (0) structures also could be seen by the broad peaks at around 44.6°–44.7° due to poor crystallinity of particles [24]. Presence of Fe3O4 peaks in XRD patterns of Fe3O4-PVDF sample were a good evidence for the interaction of Fe3O4 and PVDF which is important for structural durability of catalyst. Increasing amount of Fe3O4 addition to polymer resulted in shift on 2θ position of Fe3O4. New peaks at 20.4 (for F2-P) and 20.7° (for F8-P) with very small intensity corresponded to emerging of β-phase PVDF while peaks of α-phase PVDF at 2θ = 19°, 19.6°, 20.1° and 25.4° partially disappeared [14]. Amorphous structure formation increased for polymer due to agglomeration and tightening effect of particles after addition of Fe3O4. Effect of Fe3O4 on PVDF structure has been investigated by FT-IR analysis (Fig. 3 ). The bands at around 580–590 cm−1 corresponded to FeO stretching vibration, 1620 cm−1 was adsorbed HOH vibration of iron oxide [27]. The bands at 1122, 1046 and 977 cm−1 represented to complex structures of FeO and FeOH with water molecules [28]. CH and CF2 bond stretching vibrations of PVDF were observed at 1403 and 877–1175 cm−1 respectively. CF stretching vibration corresponded to 1070 cm−1, and it has not changed for composites. α-Phases of PVDF could be understood by 761, 796 and 975 cm−1 bands. The bands at around 838–840 cm−1 with 1273 and 1431 cm−1 confirmed the presence of α and β-phases as determined by XRD results. After the Fe3O4 addition, intensity of 797 cm−1 and 975 cm−1 bands of PVDF increased. But, intensity of 761, 797 and 975 cm−1 bands of F4-P decreased. That means α-phases of PVDF became amorphous. The changes of bands at around 700–650 cm−1 with increased Fe3O4 may be attributed to hydrogen bonding between OH groups of Fe3O4 and fluoride of PVDF chain [29]. Thermal decomposition of PVDF completed at three stages with temperature ranges 395–485 (with 2.5%–60% mass loss), 485–590 °C and 600–1000 °C as demonstrated at Fig. 4 . Different ash contents obtained for the PVDF, F2-P, F4-P, F6-P and F8-P samples were due to the inclusion of solvent during the calculation of dope solution, but burning only polymer and additives with small amount of solvent at the thermal analyzer. After exposing the samples to heat, remaining weight indicated to Fe3O4 inside membranes. All of the organic contents of Fe3O4 embedded composites were burned. Decomposition of polymer started with breaking of CH and CF bonds and progressed by mass loss. Decomposition of PVDF hastened especially at the initial steps of decomposition with the Fe3O4 addition. Onset temperature F8-P was recorded as 284 °C while it was 374 °C for raw PVDF. From the results, it was concluded that due to catalytic effect of Fe3O4, decomposition of polymeric matrix induced and onset temperature decreased. Exothermic DTA curves formed during the burning of organic structure were seen at lower temperatures compared with DTA curves of PVDF with increased Fe3O4 ratio. On the other hand t max values which is the max decomposition temperatures of F4-P, F6-P and F8-P were higher than of raw PVDF although catalytic activity of Fe3O4. Those were recorded as 470, 471, 484, 486 and 482 for PVDF, F2-P, F4-P, F6-P and F8-P respectively. That may be due to two reasons: (I) protecting effect of well dispersed particles in the polymer or (II) formation of different iron oxide species by oxygen releasing [30]. Burning of organic substance was completed at 600 °C for all samples. Residues observed for composite samples were higher than expected for their contents such as, approximately 30% for F8-P and 19% for F4-P. Those results proved the evidence of catalytic activity of Fe3O4 at the initial steps of burning and preventing effect of Fe3O4 after the initial steps. Cross-section SEM images of Fe3O4-PVDF samples were presented in Fig. 5 . Sponge-like structure of PVDF reshaped, and finger-like channels formed after Fe3O4 addition. Two percent and 4% ratio of Fe3O4 addition resulted in appropriate holes whereas with increasing amount of Fe3O4 (6% and further), agglomerated structures and particles began to be seen on the membrane. As a result of high amount of Fe3O4 loading, polymer structure became pressed and shrunk. Magnetic property of powder was also one of the effective parameters on the regulation of structure. Agglomeration of particles accelerated with magnetism. Effect of Fe3O4 amount could be understood by porosity and thickness results of flat sheet Fe3O4-PVDF structures measured according to overall porosity measurement procedures [31]. Porosity values firstly increased then decreased gradually with increased amounts of Fe3O4, as expected (Fig. 6 ). Those were recorded as 49.2%, 56%, 71.3%, 72.6% and 62.1% for PVDF, F2-P, F4-P, F6-P and F8-P respectively. By considering the characterization results, composites of containing 4% and 6% Fe3O4 could be presumed as the optimum compositions due to their high porosity. Although there were no exact changes for thicknesses of samples, intense structures formed with increasing Fe3O4 loading. Thickness values were obtained as 65, 60, 61, 66 and 62 μm respectively for the samples of the series. PVDF membrane has thicker structure compared with 2%, 4% and 8% Fe3O4 containing samples. It was due to easy phase separation of polymer absence of interacted Fe3O4 particles. Furthermore electrostatic interaction at around PVDF chain resulted in swollen structure which has thicker cross-section. Fe3O4 added samples gained pressed structure due to interaction between PVDF chain and Fe3O4. Thickest structure of F6-P was due to favorable spreading of particles on the polymeric surface as could be seen from the porosity values. However structure was pressed and thickness decreased when the Fe3O4 was 8%."
9,Filtration performances of membranes,"3.2 Filtration performances of membranes Water permeability, BSA rejection performance as a model contaminant and other properties of membranes were tested by cross-flow filtration system, and results were presented in Fig. 6. Increased PWP values were obtained with F4-P and F6-P, while PWP decreased for further additive although gradually decreased contact angle of F8-P which showed increasing hydrophilicity. Water permeation is not only depends on hydrophilicity but also porosity, thickness and water uptake [32]. Highest porosity and water uptake were recorded as 72.6% and 65% for F6-P. Porosity and water uptake values of membranes were higher than that of pristine PVDF membrane. A relation had been observed between thickness and pore size of membranes with permeation behaviors of those. Large amount of small pores formed during the phase separation as a result of accelerated water-solvent separation process due to hydrophilic metal oxide additives. Those were seen as increase in porosity, water uptake and hydrophilicity. Decreased WU%, PO% and PWP results revealed that 8% addition amount resulted in adverse effect for transferring of water among channels. Advantage of high amount of additive was seen at the BSA rejection results; 41.6% rejection was recorded with F8-P whereas it was only 6.7% for PVDF. Suppressed and blocked pores provided improved BSA rejection. Thickened structure had a significant effect on rejection performance of membranes in addition to small pores formed during the instant phase separation. Lower compaction values of composite membranes compared with PVDF confirmed to increase in viscosity of dope solution. That indicated to thicker skins by increased additive. Due to permeable polymeric lumps observed in SEM images of PVDF (Fig. 5), low rejection but moderate flux was obtained. Flux of BSA filtrated membranes were investigated and FRR% values were obtained. It was known that contaminant accumulation on the surface of membrane occurs by electrostatic interaction [33]. Highest flux recovery was recorded with F8-P as 87%. That was due to small pores which prevent entering the organic molecules into channels and hydrophilicity which hinders accumulation of BSA on the surface of membrane. FRR values of samples slightly increased with increased hydrophilicity. That may be explained by relation between hydrophilicity and roughness of surface. High amount of additive provides good hydrophilicity and high roughness. Due to particles tend to accumulate easily in rough surfaces; roughness and hydrophilicity should be improved simultaneously to obtain more resistive antifouling membranes. Composites prepared by Fe3O4 addition performed higher filtration and rejection performances than PVDF membrane."
10,Catalytic activity of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–PVDF,"3.3 Catalytic activity of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–PVDF Catalytic activity measurements of Fe3O4-PVDF for benzyl alcohol oxidation were conducted in a round bottom flask; 1:1-mol ratio alcohol:peroxide and 0.06 g catalyst were adjusted as reactants. Reaction cup was fixed to microwave furnace to adaptation of advantages of microwave radiation. It was refluxed with a condenser with solvent free conditions. Optimized reaction conditions were presented at Table 2 . High yield was obtained when the catalyst amount and Fe3O4 ratio increased. That was directly related to large amount of active sites of catalyst. Performance of composite was affected by Fe3O4 amount added to PVDF. Large holes induced easy transferring of substrates while narrowing of structure consequently suppressed the pores and that caused hurdled transferring of substrates to active sites. That decreased the conversion as could be seen from conversion results of F8-P. Although decreasing porosity with high Fe3O4 amount (Section 3.1), moderate conversion and selectivity was obtained with F8-P. That may be attributed to favorable pore dispersion. Catalyst amount was seen that it has a direct effect on product type. High benzaldehyde selectivity and conversion were obtained when the Fe3O4-PVDF was 0.02 g, but selectivity decreased when it was 0.04 g and further amounts. That meant benzaldehyde was converted to over oxidation products such as benzoic acid. Another important parameter investigated in this study which effected conversion and selectivity of benzyl alcohol was alcohol:peroxide ratio. Different conversion and selectivity results were presented about alcohol:peroxide effect in literature [34,35]. It should be considered that organic structure facilitated substrate transportation; on the other hand, hydrophilic groups easily interact with water and peroxide. Either hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of structure became dominant, and water or organic substrate transportation increased. Fe3O4-PVDF performed high conversion but low selectivity when used without peroxide (49% and 6% respectively). When the peroxide:alcohol ratio was 0.2, conversion and selectivity were approximately equal. Highest selectivity and conversion were recorded with the alcohol:peroxide ratio of 0.8 and 1.5 respectively. The reasons may be: (1) stoichiometrically scarcity of peroxide amount, (2) transferring problems of peroxide to active sites of catalyst due to interaction of peroxide with polymer, (3) peroxide decomposition on active sites of catalyst. Complex peroxy-metal structures formed as a result of interaction of hydrogen peroxide and metals on catalyst during the oxidation. This semi product reacted with benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde formed. But in the presence of large amount of catalyst, peroxide decomposed quickly. Eighty-nine percent conversion was obtained at 700 W (Table 2). Low benzaldehyde selectivity was observed at high microwave power due to decomposition of peroxide. Fe3O4-PVDF pieces were separated from mixture with a magnet and washed with acetone then reused three times. Surprisingly, particles performed higher conversion than first circle but little selectivity. Microwave radiation may shrink the transportation channel of polymeric support. With ongoing usage, benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity increased gradually. Because of sufficient diffusion of organic substrate inside polymeric channels facilitated to transportation of substrate to active sites of iron oxide catalyst at ongoing usages. Good interaction between benzyl alcohol and iron oxide species resulted in increased conversion. Metal concentration in the reaction solution was analyzed with atomic absorption (Perkin Elmer, PinAAcle 900 F). After the fourth reuse, iron concentration was determined as 5.217 mg·L−1(R 2 = 0.999931). Any iron remnant had not been observed after first using of catalyst. After repeating reuse metal leaching increased due to effect of deformation of microwave and solvent. Small amount of Fe3O4-PVDF catalyst has benefits of easy usage and low cost catalytic activity. When compared with other catalyst (Table 3 ), moderate activity was obtained with Fe3O4-PVDF composites at solvent free area. Also easy separation from reaction media without solvent and reusability were concluded as advantageous for oxidation reactions. Microwave conditions provided new aspect to the polymer supported catalyst and catalysis system carried out in this study."
11,Conclusions,"Fe3O4 blended PVDF composites were prepared and tested in filtration cell and benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. To obtain fast, easy and low cost in-situ production the combination of samples in catalytic membrane reactor systems with microwave radiation was investigated. From the characterization it was concluded that with increasing Fe3O4 α-phase of PVDF turned to amorphous form. Thermal decomposition of polymer fastened due to catalytic effect of Fe3O4.Initial decomposition temperature of organics decreased, while Fe3O4 acted as a retardant at further stages. Higher t max values attributed to protecting behavior of additive were observed such as 482 and 486 for F4-P and F2-P respectively compared with pristine PVDF (470 °C). From the SEM analysis, finger-like channels were observed for composites. Increased porosity, water flux and BSA rejection were obtained with Fe3O4-PVDF composite membranes. Fe3O4-PVDF membranes tested for benzyl alcohol oxidation in batch system at microwave conditions provided better alcohol conversion and selectivity compared with the yield of powder Fe3O4. Optimum conversion and selectivity were achieved with 0.02 g of F8-P. Small amount of 8% Fe3O4 contained catalyst were agreed as favorable for green synthesis. In addition to catalytic activity, Fe3O4-PVDF membranes performed improved filtration and rejection compared with bare PVDF. Rejection increased to 41.6% from 6.7% for F8-P relatively with increasing flux to 94.5 L·m−2·h−1 PWP. By considering the filtration and catalytic activity of durable Fe3O4-PVDF membranes, it was concluded that those membranes could serve as a component of catalytic membrane reactor combined with microwave radiation. These findings have potential to induce new designs using mentioned fragments for featured systems."
