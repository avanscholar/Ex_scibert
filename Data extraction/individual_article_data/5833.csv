0,Introduction,"Aerobes are continually exposed to potentially toxic concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Likewise, diverse populations of mammalian cells contain various transition metals such as iron that have the potential to function as catalysts of autocatalytic reactions, producing microenvironments that are not consistent with cell survival. Fortunately, mammalian cells have a variety of chemically diverse enzymatic and antioxidant systems that neutralize ROS as well as other regulatory systems capable of storing transition metals such as iron in complexes that limit its reactivity. Under certain conditions, an overproduction of ROS/RNS occurs, resulting in diminished antioxidant systems and sustained oxidative stress. At present, there is little doubt that oxidative stress is an important pathophysiologic component of a number of diseases, including cancer (Klaunig & Kamendulis, 2004), alcoholic liver disease (Arteel, 2003), iron storage diseases (Wang et al., 2002), cardiovascular disease (Molavi & Mehta, 2004), and a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases (Selley, 1998). It is predictable that prolonged exposure to ethanol and iron would be associated with the overproduction of ROS and RNS owing to the ability of these individual agents to synergistically amplify oxidative stress. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the interaction of these prooxidants would provide a cellular environment characterized by DNA damage and modification of gene expression, both of which are important events in carcinogenesis. In this review, evidence that supports the suggestion that the concomitant prooxidative effects of alcohol and iron are involved in the carcinogenesis process is examined. Special emphasis is placed on examination of the molecular mechanisms augmenting oxidative stress and potential cellular responses important in carcinogenesis."
1,The properties and role of iron in carcinogenesis,"The role of iron, alone or in combination with ethanol, as a predisposing factor for various cancers has been difficult to establish because this transition metal is among the most abundant elements on earth and is essential for human life. Extensive documentation that iron deficiency is manifested in anemia and that excess stores of body iron result in damage to several vital organs emphasizes the complex physiologic roles and physiochemical properties of this metal. The biologic importance, as well as toxicity, of iron can be ascribed to the chemical properties of this transition metal, which facilitate its participation in one-electron oxidation/reduction reactions for conversion between the ferric (Fe3+) and ferrous (Fe2+) states. There are four unpaired electrons associated with Fe2+ and five unpaired electrons associated with Fe3+. These electronic configurations qualify both electronic species of iron as free radicals by using the definition that a free radical is any species containing one or more unpaired electrons and is capable of independent existence (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 2003). These chemical properties explain the ability of iron to participate in Fenton redox chemistry as well as other autocatalytic reactions with lipid hydroperoxides as follows: (1) Fe 2 + + H 2 O 2 → Fe 3 + + OH • + OH − (2) OH • + LH → L • + H 2 O (3) Fe 2 + + LOOH → Fe 3 + + LO • + OH + Reaction 1 depicts the well-known Fenton reaction that produces the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH•), which can undergo additional reactions involving electron transfer, addition, or, as demonstrated above in reaction 2, hydrogen abstraction from molecules such as polyunsaturated fatty acids to form a carbon-centered lipid radical (L•). As shown in reaction 3, Fe2+ also readily interacts with lipid hydroperoxides to form a lipid alkoxyl radical (LO•). Progression of reactions 1, 2, and 3 has well-documented detrimental effects on biologic systems. The oxidation of iron in reaction 1 yields OH•, which can extract a hydrogen atom from a lipid, giving rise to a lipid radical (L•) that can, in turn, extract a hydrogen atom from anther lipid molecule. Consequently, Fe2+ can mediate production of OH•, which readily functions in the initiation stage of cellular lipid peroxidation. Under aerobic conditions, O2 adds to the lipid radical, producing the corresponding lipid peroxyl radical (LOO•). This peroxyl radical is readily reduced, by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from another lipid, to form a lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), which undergoes decomposition by means of Fe2+ (reaction 3). Thus, Fe2+ also plays an important role in the autocatalytic propagation step in lipid peroxidation. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the ability of iron to readily accept or donate electrons has a significant impact on the peroxidative decomposition of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonate. It is noteworthy that, in addition to participating in the initiation and propagation steps of lipid peroxidation, iron is also thought to be involved in β-cleavage of the lipid hydroperoxides, which, through a series of complex reactions, gives rise to numerous alkanes, alkanals, and alkenals as well as several very electrophilic α,β-unsaturated hydroxyalkenals. The resulting biogenic aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and malondialdehyde, have cellular half-lives upwards to 2 or 3 min and therefore are capable of diffusing from their site of production to more distant sites within the cell to interact with DNA or protein nucleophiles. It is the diffusible and electrophilic nature of these lipid peroxidative products that is central to their proposed involvement in carcinogenesis. Likewise, the ability of iron to enhance formation of OH• documented to attack sugars, purines, and pyrimidines has important implications in DNA damage and mutations associated with cancer. Collectively, the reactions presented in reactions 1, 2, and 3 as well as in Fig. 1 describe iron-mediated pathways that contribute to the oxidative stress associated with chemical carcinogenesis (Klaunig & Kamendulis, 2004). The concentrations of iron in healthy individuals can approach upwards to 6 g, making this transition metal the most abundant in the human body (Wriggleworth & Baum, 1980). Therefore, given the potential of iron to readily participate in one-electron oxidation/reduction reactions, it is not surprising that mammalian systems have established elaborate systems to regulate its accumulation and storage. The molecular control of mammalian iron metabolism has been reviewed in detail (Hentze et al., 2004). Dietary iron, existing primarily in the Fe3+ state, is reduced to the Fe2+ state and absorbed by duodenal epithelial cells by means of a divalent metal transporter (DMT-1). It is widely accepted that iron homeostasis is regulated primarily at the level of intestinal absorption. Once inside the epithelial cell, iron is bound to the abundant cellular protein ferritin, which has the capacity to store up to 4,500 molecules of iron in the Fe3+ state. The need to supply iron for erythrocytes or for other purposes results in activation of transport mechanisms, primarily the iron transport protein ferroportin (also known as IRGE1), which facilitates the transfer of iron from duodenal cells to the serum iron-binding protein transferrin (Tf). Each molecule of transferrin avidly binds, in fully ligated form, one or two molecules of iron in the Fe3+ state, thus decreasing the occurrence of participation in one-electron reduction/oxidation reactions. The uptake of circulating iron by hepatic and extrahepatic cells occurs through the interaction of transferrin with transferrin receptors (TfR), facilitating cellular uptake of the TfR–Tf–iron complex that is subsequently internalized by endosomes. The acidic endosomal environment assists release of Fe3+ from the TfR–Tf complex, which is subsequently processed for cellular release and recycling of Tf. The Fe3+ is enzymatically reduced and sequestered by ferritin or enters other intracellular pools of iron characterized by iron bound to low-molecular-weight ligands, such as ATP, ADP, GTP, or citrate. At present, estimates of the cellular concentrations of low-molecular-weight pools of iron range from 0.2 μM in erythroid cells to 10 μM in hepatocytes (Cabantchik et al., 1996; Petrat et al., 1999). Iron present in these pools is exchangeable, chelatable for uptake by ferritin, or bioavailable for detection by iron-responsive element-binding proteins that function as cellular regulators of iron homeostasis. These low-molecular-weight chelates of iron are also catalytically reactive in oxidant formation and are responsible for iron toxicity (Kruszewski, 2003). Likewise, the catalytic nature of these low-molecular-weight iron chelates very likely plays an important role in iron co-carcinogenicity. Regulation of intracellular iron concentrations occurs through modulation of TfR mRNA stability, which is increased when intracellular iron concentrations are low. In contrast, stability is decreased when cellular iron concentrations are sufficient. Several metals, including arsenic, nickel, and chromium, are confirmed carcinogens. The carcinogenicity or co-carcinogenicity of iron remains controversial. The questionable cause–effect association between iron exposure and cancer is confirmed in two comprehensive reviews (Deugnier, 2003; Huang, 2003). These reports, as well as others (Toyokuni, 1996, 2002), provide evidence of associations between body stores of iron and colorectal cancer as well as liver cancer. It is noteworthy that the colon is exposed to high concentrations of iron derived from the diet, and significant concentrations of iron are stored in the liver. The high incidence of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individuals with the hereditary iron storage disease hemochromatosis supports the suggestion that iron may function as a co-carcinogen in the liver (Deugnier, 2003; Huang, 2003). Indeed, the essential role of iron in cell cycle progression and proliferation of neoplastic cells has been reviewed (Le & Richardson, 2002). Likewise, the use of various therapeutic approaches to sequester iron and inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells underscores the importance of iron in tumor cell growth (Deugnier & Loréal, 2000). However, the use of human subjects often necessitates indirect measurements of body stores of iron on the basis of transferrin or ferritin saturation and does not provide information concerning the cellular concentrations of free or “catalytic” iron that may be of greatest mechanistic importance in the carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic process. In a recent review, Chung et al. (2003) summarize a series of studies, the findings of which strongly support that oxidative stress, such as that induced by excess iron, is mechanistically associated with liver cancer. Specifically, the results from one study indicate an increased frequency of p53 mutation in nontumorous liver obtained from patients with Wilson disease, a syndrome associated with copper accumulation, and patients with hemochromatosis (Hussain et al., 2000). These investigators reported significantly higher frequencies of G:C to T:A transversions at codon 249 and C:G to A:T transversions in codon 250 in patients with Wilson disease, whereas the C:G to A:T transversions were most prevalent in patients with hemochromatosis. Further, findings of parallel in vitro studies with the use of TK-6 lymphoblastoid cells treated with 4-HNE revealed an increase in G to T transversion, which also occurred at codon 249 of p53. These experimental results clearly indicate that, in individuals with cooper or iron storage disease, oxidative stress is an important event in generating mediators such as 4-HNE that specifically results in mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. These observations are supported by a series of elegant mechanistic studies characterizing the formation of DNA base adducts with various aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation. First, the iron-catalyzed peroxidation of ω-3 and ω-6 lipid substrates in the presence of deoxyguanosine is reported to result in formation of cyclic adducts with acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and 4-HNE (Pan & Chung, 2002). Further, these same investigators with other collaborators (Hu et al., 2002) have used the UvrABC nuclease excision repair enzyme to establish that 4-HNE preferentially forms DNA adducts at codon 249 of the human p53 gene, supporting the suggestion that this is a targeted mutational site for HCC. Taken together, results of these studies provide a mechanistic understanding for the association of iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and production of reactive lipid aldehydes capable of forming site-specific mutations that are linked potentially to HCC."
2,The prooxidant actions of ethanol and iron in hepatocellular carcinogenesis,"Through a variety of experimental approaches it has been established that oxidative stress is a central factor involved in alcohol-induced liver injury (Arteel, 2003). Identification of specific mediators of oxidative stress that occur in vivo has proved to be difficult, primarily because they are extremely short lived owing to their chemical reactivity. For instance, although superoxide anion (O2 ·−) is reasonably stable in aqueous solutions at pH 7.4 and its reaction rates with lipids, proteins, or DNA are quite slow, the interactions of this radical with Fe3+ proceed at a rate of 1.5 × 108 M−1s−1. Thus, the half-life of O2 ·− in biologic systems is limited owing to its extreme reactivity with other radicals. Examples of such biologically relevant reactions include reduction of O2 ·− to form H2O2, which can serve as a source for the reactive hydroxyl anion (·OH). Likewise, the very rapid reaction of O2 ·− with nitric oxide NO · (1.9 × 10−10M−1s−1) results in formation of the very potent nitrating species peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Consequently, O2 ·− likely functions as a precursor for a variety of reactions, which generate molecules having significant cytotoxic potential. Production of the ethanol-derived α-hydroxyethyl radical (CH3C· HOH) has also been observed in the livers of mice and rats treated chronically with alcohol (Knecht et al., 1990; Kono et al., 2000). This radical, derived from the complex catalytic interactions of ethanol with cytochrome P450 2E1, is proposed to mediate its cytotoxic effects through adduct formation with cellular proteins, resulting in the formation of neoantigens (Stewart et al., 2004). Given the high reactivity of these radicals, it is predictable that biomolecules within close proximity of cellular microenvironments where the radicals are generated would be most susceptible to damage. Therefore, the unregulated and sustained production of such free radicals as a consequence of oxidative stress undoubtedly contributes to the co-carcinogenic actions of alcohol and iron. As outlined in a review by Klaunig and Kamendulis (2004), this complex panel of prooxidants could be linked directly to oxidant-induced DNA damage, leading to mutations, or it is involved indirectly in dysregulation of gene expression as well as cellular signaling cascades manifested in unregulated cell proliferation. It is evident from two reviews that substantial evidence, derived from studies with laboratory animals and human subjects, supports the view that oxidative stress is a common mechanism by which chronic alcohol ingestion and iron induce liver injury (Arteel, 2003; Tavill & Qadri, 2004). Further, it is widely recognized that hepatic iron overload develops in a significant proportion of individuals who consume alcohol on a chronic basis (Fletcher et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2002). These observations are consistent with reports of a significant increase in hepatic iron concentrations in animal models of chronic alcohol consumption (Tsukamoto et al., 1995; Valerio et al., 1996). This scenario seems to indicate that the presence of both prooxidants would markedly increase oxidative stress, resulting in the production of aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation such as 4-HNE that have been implicated in targeting codon 249 of p53. Therefore, it is predictable that the occurrence of HCC in individuals who consume alcohol on a regular basis should be higher than that in subjects who do not drink alcohol. Likewise, the risk of development of HCC in subjects who have hereditary hemochromatosis and consume alcohol should be considerable. However, findings of studies evaluating these relations have been inconclusive. For instance, results of one report indicate that heavy alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, and diabetes exert independent and synergistic effects on the risk of the development of HCC (Yuan et al., 2004). When data from this study were adjusted for confounding factors, subjects consuming more than four alcohol-containing drinks per day displayed a threefold increased risk of HCC. As noted, individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis who consume alcohol would be expected to be at increased risk for the development of HCC. This proposition is supported by results of a study, documenting a high frequency of heterozygosity for the HFE C282Y mutation in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and HCC (Lauret et al., 2002). Whereas cirrhosis is a risk factor for development of HCC, the results of this study support the suggestion that this HFE mutation could be a predisposing factor for HCC. Results from a study in which the incidence of cirrhosis in HFE C282Y homozygous subjects with hemochromatosis was evaluated support the role of alcohol ingestion as a co-factor in development of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (Fletcher et al., 2002). Evaluation of these subjects with respect to hepatic iron concentrations and alcohol consumption revealed that the development of cirrhosis is nine times more likely in subjects with hemochromatosis who consume more than 60 g of alcohol per day than in subjects who consume less than this amount. Of the 224 subjects evaluated, approximately 10% were found to have HCC. It is interesting that all the individuals documented to have HCC consumed more than 60 g of alcohol per day, further supporting a role for alcohol and iron in the development of HCC. Collectively, results of these studies support the suggestion of a mechanistic association of ethanol, iron, and the HFE C282Y mutation in the development of HCC. The mechanisms responsible for the synergistic actions of ethanol and iron in the liver are predictably complex, involving oxidative stress, depletion of antioxidant systems, activation of Kupffer cells, and modulation of cellular stress–activated signaling cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (Hoek & Pastorino, 2004). However, findings obtained from studies with the use of specific animal models of alcohol-induced liver injury indicate that Kupffer cells play an important role in cellular responses associated with inflammation and cell death. Histochemical analysis of liver sections obtained from rats fed an alcohol-containing diet for 8 weeks revealed the deposition of ferric iron primarily in the centrilobular region, with equivalent deposition of the iron in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (Valerio et al., 1996). These results were confirmed by Tsukamoto et al. (1999) through determination that the nonheme iron content of Kupffer cells isolated from livers of rats treated chronically with ethanol was elevated 1.8-fold above that of Kupffer cells isolated from animals not treated with alcohol. Of particular importance was the observation that elevated nonheme iron concentrations in Kupffer cells isolated from alcohol-treated rats were associated with marked elevations in electron paramagnetic resonance–radical generation, as well as with increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) binding and increased mRNA for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and mitogen-activated protein 1. The mechanistic basis for theses responses was established by the use of the iron chelator deferiprone, which restored all these parameters to the levels observed in Kupffer cells isolated from control rats. These results have significant implications with respect to the role of iron as a potential signaling molecule in modulating hepatic TNF-α. In addition to its well-documented proinflammatory properties (Baeuerle, 1991), initiation of TNF-α–mediated hepatotoxicity has been linked to the actions of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (McClain et al., 1999), oxidative stress (Zhou et al., 2003), and perturbation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (Soriano et al., 2004). Therefore, it is likely that accumulation of iron by Kupffer cells is a key event for activation or sensitization of these cells to stimuli such as LPS or other extracellular effectors. Consistent with this proposition are results of studies, demonstrating the ability of physiologically relevant concentrations of ferrous iron (10 μM) to increase I-kappa B kinase activity, NF-κB binding, and TNF-α release by cultured rat Kupffer cells (She et al., 2002). The fact that iron chelation with deferiprone blocked these responses provides convincing evidence that Fe2+ is a pivotal signaling molecule in this cascade. In additional studies, cultured hepatic Kupffer cells have been subjected to Fe59, followed by stimulation with LPS, to evaluate the intracellular pools of iron involved in NF-κB activation (Xiong et al., 2003). Stimulation of the Kupffer cells with LPS or TNF-α was followed by a transient sequestration of Fe59 into intracellular low-molecular-weight iron complexes (LMW–Fe). This was followed by a decrease of the labeled intracellular LMW–Fe with subsequent activation of I-kappa B kinase and NF-κB. The effectiveness of iron chelation in blocking these responses implicates involvement of LMW–Fe complexes proposed to represent the cellular pools of iron involved in cytotoxicity (Kruszewski, 2003). Further, these investigators used specific inhibitors to demonstrate involvement of superoxide and peroxynitrite in the signaling events mediated by iron in Kupffer cells. Results of these latter experiments raise the interesting proposition that ROS and RNS are involved in mobilization of iron from intracellular iron storage proteins such as ferritin for translocation to and from the LMW–Fe complexes. Findings of these systematic studies reveal the intricate cellular mechanisms responding to oxidative stress that, in turn, modulate intracellular iron pools. Of particular importance is the association of iron mobilization with activation of proinflammatory cellular signaling cascades involving NF-κB. Whereas the responses of Kupffer cells to various stimuli are usually beneficial, it is conceivable that sustained oxidative stress associated with chronic alcohol ingestion, hepatic iron overload, or both could play a significant role in the initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis."
3,Summary and future directions,"In summary, although not supported by extensive epidemiologic data, evidence from a number of studies supports the suggestion that specific interactions of alcohol and iron at the cellular level could play significant roles in the initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis, especially in the liver. Findings of numerous studies document the potential of ethanol or iron to function independently as a prooxidant. When present together, the prooxidant actions of these agents are additive and possibly synergistic, resulting in profound cellular oxidative stress, which is a critical event in carcinogenesis. This is evident from the mounting evidence that points to the potential of products of lipid peroxidation such as 4-HNE that target the p53 tumor suppressor gene as an important mechanistic event in HCC. Recent experimental evidence also supports the suggestion that, in hepatic macrophage, ROS and RNS have the ability to mobilize iron. Iron, through intricate signaling cascades, activates NF-κB. This results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, further creating a cellular environment conducive to the molecular events of carcinogenesis. It is clear that oxidative stress is a potential cellular consequence of sustained exposure to ethanol and iron. However, the mechanism (or mechanisms) by which oxidative stress resulting from these two agents is potentially linked to HCC is complex. Future studies directed at maintaining the oxidant balance in hepatocytes and regulating iron homeostasis in Kupffer cells will provide additional mechanistic information as well as insight into unique therapeutic approaches to prevent HCC."
