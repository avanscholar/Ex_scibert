0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as an important industrial raw material, is widely used in petroleum recovery and refining, fuel cells, electronics, food and chemical industries, and paint industry due to its advantages of environment friendly, light weight, high calorific value and wide availability [1–4]. However, currently limited technologies on hydrogen storage and transportation prevent its large-scale applications [5]. Presently, bulky steel tanks under low temperature and high pressure are commonly used to store and transport hydrogen. Nevertheless, high compression pressure is infeasible in the process of storage, because small hydrogen molecules can cause hydrogen corrosion and easily escape through the storage containers, which may lead to an explosion. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new material with excellent hydrogen barrier properties to replace the metal body of traditional hydrogen storage tanks. Graphene has been widely applied in many fields due to its unique properties, such as excellent mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, and impermeability to gas/liquid [6–8]. Gopalsamy et al. reported the preparation of NiPd nanoalloy/graphene bifunctional nanocomposite for fuel cells [9]. In 2008, Bunch et al. [10] reported that graphene possessed gas barrier properties due to its special layered structure. Additionally, the polymeric materials prepared with graphene have good mechanical, chemical and thermal stabilities, and more importantly, hydrogen barrier properties. Therefore, it is considered as a good substitute for the metal body of the traditional hydrogen storage tank. Many technologies have been used to fabricate high quality graphene, for instance, micromechanical exfoliation [11], epitaxial growth [12], chemical vapor deposition [13,14] and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) [15]. Nevertheless, stable single-layer graphene sheets cannot be obtained by these technologies due to the strong van der Waals attraction between different graphene layers. At the same time, graphene is difficult to be modified, which limits its large-scale production and application [16]. However, the chemical oxidation process of graphene is easy to operate on a large scale, and its oxidation products can participate in various chemical reaction processes. Compared with graphene, GO is a single-atomic-layer sheet, and GO sheet is easy to exfoliate and disperse in water because of its oxygen-containing groups. Therefore, GO is a promising material for preparing gas barrier composite films. For the past few years, reports on the fabrication of gas-barrier films via self-assembly of GO and polymers have been accessible. The regenerated cellulose/graphene oxide composite films prepared by Huang Huadong et al. [17] had excellent oxygen barrier properties. The O2 permeability coefficient was reduced by about 1000 times relative to the pure regenerated cellulose film at a low graphene oxide nanosheets loading of 1.64 vol%. Layek et al. prepared a layer-structured graphene oxide/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposite coated films that can significantly improve the hydrogen barrier properties [1]. The hydrogen gas transmission rates (GTRs) decreased significantly in GO/PVA nanocomposite coated films (GTRs = 5 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa) compared to uncoated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films (GTRs = 122 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). Bandyopadhyay et al. obtained diaminoalkane functionalized stitched graphene oxide/polyurethane composite-coated nylon films [18]. The coated films exhibited noticeable reduction in the hydrogen gas transmission rate (H2GTR), and triethylenetetramine - modified graphene oxide (TET - mGO)/polyurethane (PU) with 22 wt% TET-mGO exhibited 93% decrease in H2GTR than the bare nylon film. High molecular weight polyethyleneimine (HPEI) modified graphene oxide coated PET films capable of significantly improving hydrogen barrier properties were fabricated by Park et al. [19]. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/HPEI film with a coating thickness of 9.5 μm showed a hydrogen gas transmission rate (GTR) value of 8 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa, representing a nearly 95.3% decrease in the GTR value compared to the uncoated PET film (GTR = 169.5 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). Moreover, in addition to being widely used in the field of gas separation, GO can also be applied to areas such as water treatment [20–24]. Layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technology, as an effective method, has been broadly used to fabricate composite films [25,26]. This technology was firstly reported by Decher et al. in 1991 [27], who used mutually adsorbed polyelectrolyte molecules with opposite electric charges to construct composite films via the LBL deposition method. Because the LBL self-assembly technology can effectively control the thickness and properties of films, it has been employed to fabricate nanoscale ultrathin composite films in the past two decades. Different driving forces are utilized in the LBL self-assembly process, such as electrostatic force [28], hydrophobic interactions [29], hydrogen bonding [30], and covalent bonding [31]. Recent studies on the LBL self-assembly technology have rapidly emerged, revealing various influencing factors, including ionic strength [32], concentration [33], pH [34], and molecular weight [35] of the polymer solution. Due to the advantages of simple operation, being flexible, and precise control, the LBL self-assembly technology has also extended to prepare multifunctional thin films applied in perm-selective and gas-barrier membranes [36,37]. Kim et al. obtained a high performance oxygen barrier film by alternately stacking negatively charged GO and positively charged amino-ethyl-functionalized GO (AEGO) on PET substrates by this technology [38]. Liu Hongyu et al. reported a facile approach for the fabrication of chemically-modified reduced graphene oxide based multilayer films for hydrogen barrier applications also by the LBL self-assembly technology [39]. Zhao Lili et al. reported the layer-by-layer self-assembly technology in the electric field to improve hydrogen barrier properties of GO/polyethyleneimine (PEI) LBL self-assembled films [40,41]. In recent years, based on the electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly technology, the reactive layer-by-layer self-assembly technology has been developed by alternative coatings of two kinds of organic functional groups that can react to each other to form covalent bonds. Compared with the electrostatic LBL self-assembled film, the acid, alkali and salt resistance of the reactive LBL self-assembled film is improved, which widens its application scope. Nanoscale polyurethane films, polyimide films and linear polyamide films have been successfully prepared through the method [42]. Based on conventional condensation polymerization reaction, the mGO/PEI reactive layer-by-layer self-assembled films were obtained by controlling the concentration of two alternately adsorbed functional groups on the film surface. This method is similar to interfacial polymerization, but the film thickness is much easier to control than that produced through interfacial polymerization, and the surface is smooth. Studies on the preparation of composite films have concentrated on the reaction between two kinds of monomers. There have been a few reports on the fabrication of polymer/nanomaterial composite films by the formation of covalent bonds. Jia et al. [43] reported that carboxylic acid and dihydric alcohol as cross-linking agents were used to esterify hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of GO to prepare covalently crosslinked GO membranes. Satti et al. [44] reported that a carbodiimide coupling agent was used to crosslink GO sheets and polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) to prepare composite films with tensile strengths up to 146 MPa. Ruoff et al. [45] reported that the chemically crosslinked graphene oxide sheet material can be produced through the reaction between amino-groups on polyallylamine (PAA) chains and epoxy groups on GO surface. Liu Hongyu et al. [46] prepared a PEI modified graphene oxide (PEI-mGO)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite films to enhance the hydrogen barrier properties of the film. The PEI-mGO/PVA film with 3.0 wt% of PEI-mGO content exhibited almost 95% decrease in the GTR value compared to PVA films. At present, the hydrogen barrier properties of the LBL self-assembled film prepared by the non-covalent bond, such as hydrogen bond or electrostatic force is easy to deteriorate in the acid, alkali or salt environment, which is disadvantage to hydrogen storage and transportation. Therefore, it is necessary to use covalent bonds instead of non-covalent bonds in the self-assembly process to improve the stability of the film hydrogen barrier properties in different environments. In the present study, epoxy groups were introduced to the surface of GO to form covalent bonds with PEI to obtain mGO/PEI reactive layer-by-layer self-assembled films, which possessed acid, alkali, salt and thermal resistance. GO is a nanomaterial with a large size, and the reactivity of the surface hydroxyl group is lowered due to the limitation of its mobility. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce more reactive epoxy groups as much as possible by changing the reaction conditions to provide more covalent bonds for film self-assembly, which makes the film have more stable hydrogen barrier properties in different environments. So GO was modified with EDGE to introduce epoxy groups on the surface of GO. Then with the hydrogen barrier properties as the main index, the single factor control variable method was adopted to investigate the effects of modification conditions suach as modification time, pH value and feed ratio on the hydrogen barrier properties of the film. In addition, the effects of covalent bonds self-assembly process on the thickness, nanostructure and micromorphology of the film were analyzed. The hydrogen transmission rate (H2TR), ultraviolet (UV) absorbance, infrared (IR) absorbance and film thickness were measured. The surface topography of the films was observed by an atomic force microscopy (AFM)."
1,Experiment,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials GO (oxidation degree > 95%) in the powder form was purchased from the Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Pure PEI (MW = 10,000 g mol−1) was purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The concentration was 0.5 wt% for PEI water solution, 0.5 wt% for PEI ethanol solution, and 0.05 wt% for GO suspension. Pure ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EDGE) (MW = 170 g mol−1) was purchased from SA Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pure ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EDGE) (MW = 400 g mol−1) was purchased from Aike Reagent Co. Ltd. (Sichuan, China). Pure ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EDGE) (MW = 600 g mol−1) was purchased from Hua Na Reagent Co. Ltd. (Sichuan, China). Pure industrial polyester film, PET (type 6020; thickness = 160 μm), was purchased from Yuxiang Electronic Material Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The PET film, which was used as the deposition substrate for the gas barrier measurements, was cleansed with ultrapure water and ethanol, and then pretreated with an alkali–amine solution, which was prepared by mixing sodium hydroxide (8.4%) and ethylenediamine (0.6%). The PET film was dipped into the alkali–amine solution for 1 h at 70 °C, then was rinsed with ultrapure water and dried before the LBL self-assembly."
3,Modification and characterization of GO,"2.2 Modification and characterization of GO The reaction between GO suspension (100 mL, 0.05 wt %) and EDGE (0.65 g) was performed at 190 rpm for 6 h at 45 °C. The reaction was accomplished based on the following steps: Step 1: The product was filtered by PTFE membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μm. Step 2: The product was rinsed with ultrapure water and ethanol. Step 3: The product was dispersed in ethanol (100 mL) by ultrasonication (Autotune 500w, Shimadzu, Japan) for 30 min with a high-intensity sonicator to obtain a concentration of 0.05 wt% mGO ethanol dispersion suspension. Step 4: The product was dried for 40 min. Step 5: Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Vertex 7.0, Bruker Corporation, Germany), Raman spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo escalab 250Xi, Thermo electron, USA) were used to characterize the chemical structure of mGO."
4,Preparation of self-assembled films,"2.3 Preparation of self-assembled films The preparation process of mGO/PEI films consists of the following steps: (1) Si wafers were pretreated with a piranha solution (70% H2SO4 and 30% H2O2) for 1 h under 90 °C. (2) Preparation of the PEI solution at a concentration of 0.5 wt% and GO suspension at a concentration of 0.05 wt%. (3) The Si wafers and PET film were dipped into the PEI solution for 20 min (4) The Si wafers and PET film were rinsed with ultrapure water and dried on a spin coater. (5) The Si wafers and PET film were immersed in mGO suspension for 20 min, then rinsed and dried again. This process represents one deposition cycle, and the products were considered to consist of one bilayer. This entire process was repeated to prepare mGO/PEI films with different numbers of bilayers."
5,Modification of GO,"2.4 Modification of GO During the reaction of EDGE modified GO, the epoxy groups on EDGE reacts with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of GO to form ether bonds, so the epoxy groups at the other end of EDGE were grafted on GO. But the reaction produced new hydroxyl groups, and the resulting hydroxyl groups could interact with new epoxy groups to form a crosslinked structure until the epoxy groups were exhausted. Therefore, the modification time, the modification pH and the feed ratio of GO/EDGE affect the composition of functional groups on the surface of mGO, which further affects the hydrogen barrier properties of mGO/PEI self-assembled films. In order to obtain reactive self-assembled films with good hydrogen barrier properties, the hydrogen transmission rate of reactive self-assembled films prepared with modified GO under different conditions were measured to explore suitable modification conditions. GO modified under different conditions was investigated: (1) The specimens were modified by varying EDGE duration, pH value, and feed ration. (2) Characterized the surface functional group composition before and after GO modification by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) C1s spectra to determine the degree of modification of GO. (3) The 10-bilayer mGO/PEI reactive layer-by-layer self-assembled films were fabricated and the H2TRs of the films were measured to investigate the hydrogen barrier properties. (4) With the hydrogen barrier properties as the main index, mGO/PEI self-assembled films prepared at different modification conditions (EDGE duration, pH value, feed ratio) were compared to determine the suitable modification conditions."
6,Test and characterization of films,"2.5 Test and characterization of films Some indexes are used to analyze the results, including absorbance, thickness, morphologies, surface roughness, and hydrogen barrier properties. The absorbance of the film was measured by a UV–visible light (UV–Vis) spectroscopy with the wavelength range of 190–600 nm. The films were cut into discs with a diameter of 97 mm and then inserted into a standard quartz cell (thickness = 1 mm). After taking a baseline calibration with a blank sample, the UV–Vis spectra were obtained for the films with different numbers of bilayers. The thickness of mGO/PEI films were measured using an Alpha-SE Ellipsometer (EC-400 and M-2000V, J. A. Woollam Co. Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The surface morphologies and the surface roughness were imaged with a multimode scanning probe microscope (MultiMode® 8, Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA, USA), operated in tapping mode. The hydrogen barrier properties were measured with a pressure permeation instrument (Labthink Instruments Co., Ltd., Shandong, China) at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity. A differential pressure of 0.1 MPa was maintained throughout the measurements of the gas transmission rate."
7,Results and discussion,"In this section, the structure of mGO were characterized by FTIR, Raman spectra and XPS firstly. In order to obtain reactive self-assembled films with good hydrogen barrier properties, GO was modified with EDGE under different condition, and the modified GO were studied by XPS in this section, and FTIR in Supplementary Data which support the XPS data further. Then, the characterization and hydrogen gas barrier properties of self-assembled films were discussed in detail. The photos of prepared GO, mGO as well as self-assembled films were shown in the Supplementary Data."
8,Characterization of GO and mGO,"3.1 Characterization of GO and mGO The introduction of more epoxy groups onto GO surfaces is crucial for the reactive layer-by-layer self-assembly process. Fig. 1 shows the scheme of GO modification by EDGE. Both ends of the EDGE molecular chain are epoxy groups, which can react with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of GO. The reaction of EDGE with GO further increases the epoxy group content of mGO surface, thereby promoting its covalent bond self-assembly with PEI. After modification, the dispersion stability of mGO in ethanol is improved as shown in Fig. S1 of Supplementary Data. Fig. 2 a shows the FTIR of GO and mGO. The absorption peaks at 1720 cm−1 and 1050 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of the carboxyl groups and bending vibration of the hydroxyl groups. The peak at 1720 cm−1 for mGO is weaker than that for GO. Simultaneously, the peak at 1050 cm−1 moves to 1080 cm−1, which indicates the C-O band absorption peak of hydroxyl groups on the surface of mGO moves to the position of the ether C-O bond absorption peak. Therefore, the content of epoxy groups increases. Fig. 2b shows the Raman spectra of GO and mGO. The characteristic D and G peaks of GO and mGO are presented. The D and G bands were fitted with Gaussian-shaped functions to estimate the ID/IG ratio between the areas of the peaks, which is an indication of the degree of medium range disorder. The positions of G peak and D peak have no change, while the ID/IG ratio (ID/IG = 1.09) that represents the disorder degree of the mGO lamellar structure increases compared to that of GO (ID/IG = 0.91). The results indicate that the degree of the disorder of the GO sheets increases after changing the structure of GO surface functional groups. The aforementioned changes confirm that the epoxy group content of mGO is increased, and EDGE was successfully grafted on the surface of GO. Fig. 3 shows the XPS C1s spectra of GO and mGO. The C1s high resolution spectra is presented to estimate the change of functional groups on the GO and mGO surfaces. The curves with binding energies at 288 eV, 286.4 eV, and 287.1 eV are corresponding to the C=O bond, C-OH bond and C-O-C band, respectively. The peak intensity of the C-O-C band of mGO increases significantly compared to that of GO, the peak intensity of the C=O band decreases slightly, and the peak intensity of the C-OH band changes little. These alterations demonstrate that the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of GO react with EDGE, resulting in a significant increase in the epoxy group content of the mGO."
9,Investigation of GO modification conditions,"3.2 Investigation of GO modification conditions Fig. 4 a–d displays the XPS C1s spectra of mGOs modified at different time, and demonstrates the functional group composition before and after GO modification. The peak intensity of the C-O-C band of mGO increases compared to that of GO, the peak intensity of the C=O band decreases slightly, and the peak intensity of the C-OH band exhibits little change after 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h modifications. However, the peak intensity of the C-O-C band of mGO decreases and the peak intensity of the C-OH band increases compared to those of GO after 24 h modification. These trends indicate that the content of epoxy groups on the surface of mGO (modified for 2 h, 4 h, 6 h) increases, the content of carboxyl groups decreases, and the content of hydroxyl groups changes little. However, the content of the epoxy groups on the surface of mGO modified for 24 h relatively reduces, but the content of the hydroxyl groups increases. The reason may be that long reaction time leads to the reaction of epoxy groups and water in the weak acid environment to form glycol structures. mGO modified under different times were also characterized by FTIR which were shown in Supplementary Data (Fig. S2). Fig. 5 a–d displays the XPS C1s spectra of mGOs modified under different pH values. The peak intensity of the C-O-C band of mGOs increases significantly under acidic conditions (pH = 2 and pH = 4.5) compared to that of GO, and reaches the maximum when pH = 4.5. The content of epoxy group exhibits the same trend as the peak intensity. Additionally, under alkaline conditions, the peak intensity of C-O-C and C=O bands decreases, while the peak intensity of the C-OH band increases. This meant that under alkaline conditions, the content of epoxy groups and carboxyl groups of mGOs decreases, while the content of the hydroxyl groups increases. The possible reason is that epoxy groups open loops to react with water to form the glycol structure and GO is easy to be reduced under alkaline conditions. Fig. S3 shows the FTIR of mGOs modified under different pH values, which support the results of XPS above. Fig. 6 a–d shows the XPS C1s spectra of mGOs under different ratios of GO to EDGE. With the increase of the amount of EDGE added, the peak intensity of the C-O-C band increases, which means the content increase of epoxy groups. However, when the feed ratio of GO/EDGE increases to 0.05:1.3, the C-O-C band peak intensity slightly decreases while the C-OH band peak intensity increases, which indicates the slight reduction of the epoxy groups content and the increase of the hydroxyl groups content. Similar results can be obtained from FTIR spectra shown in Fig. S4. The reason for this phenomenon may be attributed to the strong hydrophobicity of EDGE. Moreover, with the feed ratio of GO/EDGE increases to 0.05:1.3, EDGE cannot fully mix with the hydrophilic GO due to the internal system established by itself. During the reaction, EDGE first reacts with water to form an ethylene glycol structure before reacting with GO. Fig. 7 a shows the H2TRs of 10-bilayer mGO/PEI self-assembled ((mGO/PEI)10) films with mGOs modified under different times. As shown in the figure, the H2TRs of mGO/PEI films are significantly reduced compared to PET films, which means that the hydrogen barrier properties of PET films are improved effectively through mGO/PEI reactive layer-by-layer self-assembly process. Although the mGO modified for 2 h contained more epoxy groups, the hydrogen barrier properties of mGO/PEI reactive layer-by-layer self-assembled films (H2TR = 298 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa) are not as good as those prepared by the modification time for 6 h (H2TR = 232 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). Therefore, 6 h period is recommended for the modification of GO in this study. Fig. 7b shows the H2TRs of (mGO/PEI)10 films prepared with mGOs modified under different pH values. The H2TRs of mGO/PEI films (pH = 2, H2TR = 251 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa; pH = 4.5, H2TR = 232 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa) is significantly reduced compared to PET films (H2TR = 1356 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). This indicates that mGO (modified at pH = 2 and pH = 4.5)/PEI self-assembled films possessed better hydrogen barrier properties compared to PET films. But the H2TR of mGO/PEI films (pH = 9.5) was 848 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa, which shows that the hydrogen barrier properties of self-assembled films were deteriorated. The reason may be related to the higher degree of reduction of mGO under alkaline conditions. Additionally, mGO is easily dispersed in ethanol under acidic conditions, but mGO modified under alkaline conditions tends to agglomerate and has poor dispersion stability. Therefore, mGO (modified under alkaline conditions) is disadvantageous for the self-assembly adsorption process, and the self-assembled film prepared therefrom possesses a non-uniform structure and relatively poor hydrogen gas barrier properties. Therefore, the pH value equal to 2 is recommended for the modification of GO. Fig. 7c shows the H2TRs of (mGO/PEI)10 films prepared with mGOs modified under different GO/EDGE ratios. When GO/EDGE = 0.05:0.23, mGO/PEI self-assembled films possessed good hydrogen barrier properties (H2TR = 232 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa) compared to PET films (H2TR = 1356 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). But when the GO/EDGE ratio increased to 0.05:1.3, the hydrogen barrier properties of mGO/PEI self-assembled films began to deteriorate (H2TR = 316 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). Moreover, excessive EDGE (GO/EDGE = 0.05:1.3) made mGO easy to aggregate, and the dispersion stability was deteriorated, which was disadvantageous for preparing the hydrogen barrier film with a uniform structure. In addition, the H2TR of the mGO/PEI self-assembled film (GO/EDGE = 0.05:0.65) was 232 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa, which is close to the H2TR of the mGO/PEI self-assembled film (GO/EDGE = 0.05:0.23). Therefore, the feed ratio of GO/EDGE = 0.05:0.23 is recommended for the modification of GO."
10,Growth and hydrogen barrier properties of mGO/PEI films,"3.3 Growth and hydrogen barrier properties of mGO/PEI films Different bilayers of mGO/PEI reactive layer-by-layer self-assembled films were prepared under the recommended modification conditions (modification time = 6 h, modification pH = 2 and GO/EDGE = 0.05/0.23). Fig. S5 shows the photos of mGO/PEI self-assembled films with different bilayers. As the number of self-assembled bilayers of mGO/PEI films increases, the transparency of the film decreases gradually，which indicates that the adsorption amount of mGO is gradually increased. Fig. 8 shows the absorbance and thickness of GO/PEI and mGO/PEI self-assembled films with different bilayers. The absorbance and thickness of the self-assembled films increase linearly with the number of bilayers, and exhibit the same growth trend. In addition, since there was no electrostatic repulsion during the self-assembly process, there was more mGO deposited on the surface of PEI. The absorbance (1.470) of the 10-bilayer mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled film is about 3 times relative to that of the 10-bilayer GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled film (0.46). Simultaneously, the EDGE introduced onto the surface of GO increases the interlayer spacing of the mGO adsorption layer of the reactive self-assembled film, thereby the thickness of the composite film obtained by reactive self-assembly technology increases. The thickness (62 nm) of the 10-bilayer mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled film is larger than that of the 10-bilayer GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled film (47 nm). Fig. 9 shows the H2TR of GO/PEI and mGO/PEI self-assembled films with different bilayers. The change trend of H2TR of the mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films is basically the same as that of the GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films. As the number of self-assembled bilayers increases, the H2TR of the multilayer composite films gradually decreases. The hydrogen barrier properties of mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films are slightly worse than GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films, and the H2TR of the 10-bilayer GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films (235 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa) reduces by 18.7% compared to that of mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films (289 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). Moreover, the H2TR of the 10-bilayer mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films (289 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa) reduces by 78.8% compared to that of PET substrate films (1365 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). Therefore, duo to the mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled film has larger adsoption amount of mGO and thickness than the GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled film, so the mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled film also has good hydrogen barrier properties."
11,FTIR characterization of mGO/PEI films,"3.4 FTIR characterization of mGO/PEI films Fig. 10 shows the FTIR of a 30-bilayer GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled film and a 30-bilayer mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled film. In the IR spectra of the mGO/PEI film, the peak intensity of the methyl group at 2920 cm−1 and the peak intensity of the methylene group at 2820 cm−1 increase compared to the GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled film, which indicates the content increase of methyl groups and methylene groups of the mGO/PEI film. It is also can be seen that the C=O band stretching vibration peak intensity of the carboxyl group at 1720 cm−1 is decreased, indicating the content reduction of the carboxyl groups. The results are consistent with the reduction in the carboxyl groups content and the increase in methyl/methylene groups content after the modification of GO to mGO. Moreover, compared to that of the GO/PEI self-assembled film, the N-H in-plane bending vibration peak of the mGO/PEI self-assembled film secondary amine groups at 1640 cm−1 moves to 1550 cm−1. This indicates that some primary amine groups were converted to secondary amine groups. Simultaneously, a broad peak of the out-of-plane bending vibration of the secondary amine groups appear at 818 cm−1. These alterations indicate that the content of secondary amino groups in the mGO/PEI self-assembled film was increased. Based on the analysis, the primary amine groups in PEI reacted with the epoxy groups in mGO to form covalent bonds, and the primary amine groups were converted into the secondary amine groups. Therefore, the content of secondary amino groups on the mGO/PEI self-assembled films increased. It is also confirmed that the mGO/PEI self-assembled film was prepared by forming covalent bonds between mGO and PEI."
12,Comparison of the GO/PEI film and mGO/PEI film properties,"3.5 Comparison of the GO/PEI film and mGO/PEI film properties 10-bilayer GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films and a 10-bilayer mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films prepared under recommended conditions were soaked in the HCl solution (pH = 2), NaOH solution (pH = 12), NaCl solution (1 M) and heat-treated at 80°C for different durations. Then the acid-resistance, alkali-resistance, salt-resistance and heat-resistance properties of the self-assembled films were analyzed by comparing the H2TR of multilayer films under different treatment conditions, as shown in Fig. 11 . 10-bilayer GO/PEI films were immersed in HCl (pH = 2), NaOH (pH = 12) and NaCl (1 M) for 5 h, the hydrogen transmission rate of GO/PEI films increased by 159.15%, 292.34% and 174.89%, respectively. However, the hydrogen transmission rate of mGO/PEI films treated under the same conditions above increased by 54.36%, 193.96% and 88.26%, respectively. It demonstrates that with the increasing processing time, the hydrogen barrier properties of the GO/PEI and mGO/PEI self-assembled films soaked in acid, alkali and salt solutions deteriorate. Moreover, after immersion in HCl (pH = 2), NaOH (pH = 12) and NaCl (1 M) solution for 5 h, the hydrogen transmission rate of mGO/PEI films were 24.47%, 4.99% and 13.16% lower than that of GO/PEI films, respectively. It demonstrates that mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films have better acid, alkali, and salt resistance compared to GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films. In addition, 10-bilayer GO/PEI and mGO/PEI films were heat-treated for 5 h at 80 ℃, the hydrogen transmission rate of the GO/PEI and mGO/PEI films increased by 32.34% and 7.27%. Hence, mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films have better heat resistance than GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films. In summary, mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films possess better acid, alkali, salt and heat resistance compared to GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films."
13,Conclusions,"Hydrogen barrier properties are characteristic of polymeric materials prepared with graphene; thus, they can be considered as a good substitute for the metal body of the traditional hydrogen storage tank. In this study, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EDGE) was used to modify graphene oxide (GO) by grafting epoxy groups on GO. Subsequently covalent bonds between modified graphene oxide (mGO) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were formed to fabricate the multilayer composite films with stable hydrogen barrier properties in different environments. Results demonstrate that the epoxy groups of EDGE were successfully grafted onto the GO surface and the dispersion stability of GO in the solvent was meliorated. Furthermore, the reaction degree of EDGE modified GO was controlled by changing the reaction time, pH value and feed ratio of GO/EDGE. The parametric analysis has revealed that the following conditions secure the best resistance of the film to hydrogen gas transmission: the modification reaction time = 6 h, pH = 2, and GO/EDGE = 0.05/0.23. The mGO/PEI self-assembled films prepared under these conditions showed a linear increase in absorbance and thickness as the number of bilayers increased, and the hydrogen barrier properties were also gradually improved. The hydrogen transmission rate (289 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa) of 10-bilayer mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled film reduced by 78.8% compared to that of polyethylene terephthalate substrate films (1365 cm3/m2·24 h·0.1 MPa). In addition, 10-bilayer GO/PEI and mGO/PEI films were immersed in HCl (pH = 2), NaOH (pH = 12) and NaCl (1 M) for 5 h, the hydrogen transmission rate of mGO/PEI reactive self-assembled films were 24.47%, 4.99% and 13.16% lower than that of GO/PEI electrostatic self-assembled films, respectively. The reactive self-assembled film has better acid, alkali, and salt resistance compared to the electrostatic self-assembled film."
