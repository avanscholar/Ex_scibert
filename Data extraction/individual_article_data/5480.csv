0,Introduction,"The use of bioalcohols for producing hydrogen is considered of great interest as in the mid-term, it may contribute, to the implementation of hydrogen production processes based on non-fossil resources. Currently, ethanol is the bioalcohol produced in the greatest amount and it is also the higher alcohol that has been most studied with the goal of producing hydrogen using reforming processes [1–3]. Although the reforming of glycerol has also been widely studied [4–6] chiefly because glycerol is a byproduct in biodiesel production, there are few reports on the reforming of other C3 and C4 alcohols [7–12]. However, much effort is invested in the use biomass resources, including agricultural residues and lignocellulose materials, in the production of chemicals and fuels. The implementation of new processes for biomass transformation may provide new opportunities to obtain different biomass-derived alcohols, which could become available in large amounts in the near future [13–15]. In this context, the study of processes of reforming alcohols other than ethanol and glycerol for H2 production emerges as an interesting research proposal. Moreover, the use of oxidative steam reforming (OSR) processes is energetically favourable compared with steam reforming, and it could be an appropriate compromise between the energy requirement and the hydrogen yield. Furthermore, the presence of O2 in the reactants may also contribute to the elimination of carbon deposits, the build-up of which is one of the major causes of deactivation of reforming catalysts [1,2,16]. Co and Ni have been identified as appropriate active phases for the reforming of higher alcohols due to their high capacity for C–C bond cleavage [1,2]. The addition of a small amount of noble metal has been shown to have a positive effect on the catalytic behaviour of Co- and Ni-based materials for the processes mentioned [17–22]. Furthermore, the oxygen mobility of the support and the presence of alkaline cations as promoters can prevent carbon deposition, thereby contributing to less deactivation of such catalysts [17,23,24]. We recently reported that the OSR of 1-propanol (OSRP) can be effectively carried out over Ni catalysts supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), at 773 K [9]. The materials were used in the OSRP without previous reduction; characterization of the post-reaction catalysts showed that the initial NiO was transformed into metallic Ni0 during the OSRP. Together with the background relating to catalyst formulation for the OSR of higher alcohols laid out above, our previous results led us to study the effect of the addition of small amounts of different noble metals (Ir, Ru, Pt) to the bare Ni(K)/YSZ catalyst (10% Y2O3 wt/wt in the support) with respect to the OSR of 1-propanol and propylene glycol. Both processes, the OSRP and the OSR of propylene glycol (OSRPG), were studied in the temperature range 723–773 K using a reactant mixture with molar ratios of: total oxygen to carbon, O/C = 4 and H2O/C = 3.2 (OSRP) or 3.1 (OSRPG). Catalysts were used in the reforming processes without a previous reduction step and were characterized before and after reaction using several techniques; any carbonaceous deposits on the post-reaction catalysts were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and TPO experiments."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation YSZ-supported monometallic Ni and bimetallic Ni–M (M = Pt, Ir, Ru) catalysts containing K as a promoter were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The YSZ (10% wt/wt Y2O3; BET surface area 79 m2 g−1) was prepared by a precipitation method and calcined at 873 K, as described elsewhere [9]. The Ni, K, and M (M = Ir, Pt, Ru) were loaded from an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O, KNO3 and K2[PtCl4], IrCl3.xH2O or RuCl3. The resulting solids were calcined at 773 K."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The chemical composition of the samples was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) apparatus: Perkin Elmer Optima 3200RL. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were acquired with a computer-controlled XPert-PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with 0.017 steps in the range 2θ = 4°–100°, with 50 s at each step. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were performed using a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 analyzer. The sample was treated with a 12.5% (v/v) H2/Ar mixture (TPR) or 10% (v/v) O2/He (TPO) mixture and it was heated at 10 K/min. H2 or O2 consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a PHI 5500 Multitechnique System, using a monochromatic AlKα X-ray source (1486.6 eV, 350 W) which was placed perpendicular to the analyzer, working with an ultra-high vacuum (5 × 10−7 Pa). The binding energy (BE) values were referred to the C 1s peak, at 284.8 eV. Infrared spectra of the solids were recorded using a Nicolet 520 FTIR spectrometer by collecting 256 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1. FTIR was used for studying both the adsorption of CO probe molecule and the adsorption of reactant vapours (1-propanol and propylene glycol). Adsorption experiments were carried out over the H2-reduced (773 K) catalysts using a special greaseless infrared cell with ZnSe windows which allows thermal, vacuum and gas treatments. Self-supported wafers of the reduced samples were introduced into the cell, treated under high vacuum (10−3 Pa) at 673 K and then, in order to refresh the reduced samples and remove water and CO2, they were treated with several hydrogen/vacuum pulses at the same temperature. The corresponding vapour of 1-propanol or propylene glycol was adsorbed onto the samples from the purified liquid. After the adsorption, the samples were outgassed at 10−2 Pa, and the initial spectra at 298 K were registered. The samples were then treated at successive increasing temperatures up to 723 K; after each treatment, the sample was cooled to 298 K and the spectrum of the solid phase and that corresponding to the gas phase were registered. The spectra of the solid catalysts were always referred to the background spectrum of the corresponding sample after the in-situ re-reduction. The Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Jobin-Yvon LabRam HR 800 with a CCD detector cooled at 203 K and a 532 nm laser. The laser power was limited to 0.7 mW to minimize laser-heating effects. The samples were studied at room temperature at various points using 50× magnification."
4,Oxidative steam reforming of n-propanol and propylene glycol,"2.3 Oxidative steam reforming of n-propanol and propylene glycol Catalytic behaviour was studied using a Micro-Activity Reference unit (PID Eng&Tech). The sample was placed in a stainless steel 316 (i.d. = 9.2 mm) tubular reactor and the temperature was measured using a thermocouple in the catalytic bed. The liquid reaction mixture (alcohol and water) was fed by means of a GILSON 307 pump and evaporated and mixed with preheated air before entering the reactor. The OSR catalytic tests were carried out for 32 h, at 1 atm of pressure and reaction temperatures between 723 K and 773 K, using the following sequence of temperature and time: 723 K (12 h) → 773 K (12 h) → 723 K (8 h). Powdered catalysts (0.22 g), diluted with inert SiC, were used as prepared without previous reduction. The experiments were carried out under a total gas hourly space velocity (GHSV = inlet gas volumetric flow/catalyst bed volume) of 5000 h−1 and using molar ratios H2O/C = 3.2 (OSRP) or 3.1 (OSRPG) and total O/C = 4; the total oxygen content of the reactant mixture includes the O content of alcohol and those of water and O2 used as reactants. At the reactor outlet, a thermoelectric unit condensed and separated the condensable vapours from the mixture. Then, the outlet gas was analyzed online using a Varian GC-4900 gas chromatograph. The trapped condensable vapours were analyzed in a Varian STAR 3400-CX gas chromatograph. Integral alcohol conversion (X) was determined at each step of the catalytic test, X (%) = 100x (n ALCOHOL,in – n ALCOHOL,out)/n ALCOHOL,in; in several experiments besides the unreacted alcohol other components were identified, but their concentrations were <0.1% and neglected."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization Table 1 lists the catalysts prepared and their Ni, K, and M (M = Ir, Pt, Ru) contents, as determined by ICP. In all cases, the XRD patterns of the calcined catalysts showed, besides the peaks characteristic of tetragonal/cubic ZrO2 (JCPDS 01-081-1544, JCPDS 01-081-1550), those corresponding to cubic NiO (JCPDS 01-078-0423) (Fig. 1 ). Other phases containing K or M could not be identified by XRD, probably due to the low content of both K and M in the samples. By using the (200) NiO diffraction peak and the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of the NiO were determined (Table 1); which were found to be similar for all the catalysts (11–12 nm). The calcined catalysts were also characterized by XPS; Ni 2p, K 2p, Ru 3d, Zr 3d, Y 3d core levels were analyzed. The superposition of the main core levels of Ir and Pt with Ni 3p or Y 3p levels did not allow the analysis of Ir and Pt by XPS. For all the catalysts, the BE values of Zr 3d5/2, Y 3d5/2 and K 2p3/2 were in the ranges: 182.0–182.2 eV, 158.6–159.0 eV and 293.0–293.3 eV, respectively; from these values the presence of surface Zr4+, Y3+ and K+ species in the oxide matrixes can be inferred. Fig. 2 shows the spectra corresponding to the Ni 2p level of the catalysts. The two main peaks corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 were located at 855.4–856.0 eV and 873.0–873.7 eV, respectively. These values, and the presence of a satellite peak around 861 eV, point to the presence of surface Ni2+ species [25]. Table 2 shows the atomic ratios determined by XPS (surface) compared to those determined by ICP (bulk). In all cases, the atomic ratio Ni/(Y + Zr) determined by XPS was lower than that determined by ICP; the monometallic catalyst showed the lowest surface Ni/(Y + Zr) ratio. In contrast, the atomic ratio K/(Y + Zr) determined by XPS was higher in all cases than that determined by ICP; that indicating a segregation of K+ on the surface for all the catalysts. As stated above, the sole noble metal that could be analyzed by XPS was Ru; the (Ru/Y + Zr)xPS was determined after deconvolution of the band containing both C 1s and Ru 3d levels. As shown in Table 2, segregation of Ru was found on the surface of the Ni–Ru catalyst. The TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . The monometallic catalyst presented two main reduction peaks with maxima at 616 K and 636 K, and with a wide tail of hydrogen consumption at higher temperatures. Both the Ni2+-support interaction and the oxygen vacancies of the support could affect the broadness of the NiO reduction peak, as well as its position [9,19]. As expected, in all cases, the presence of a noble metal shifted the H2 consumption to lower temperatures (Fig. 3). The noble metal is firstly reduced and then it favours the reduction of nickel species in the catalyst through an H2 spill-over mechanism. Only in the case of the Ni–Pt catalyst did an isolated low-intensity peak appear at a low temperature (495 K), which could be associated with the reduction of the noble metal (Pt) [26]. Regarding H2 consumption, Table 1 shows the amount of experimental H2 consumption with respect to the theoretical amount of H2 necessary for the reduction of the nickel and noble metal species in the catalysts. The TPR/theoretical ratios of H2 uptake for the bimetallic catalysts were much higher than 1; this is related with the partial reduction of the support. The Ni–Ir catalyst showed the highest TPR/theoretical ratio of H2 uptake and the lowest temperature at which the reduction finished (Fig. 3); indicating that this catalyst was reduced the most. This is worth a specific mention because increased reducibility of different catalysts has been related with improved behaviour in oxidative reforming of different substrates such as ethanol and butanol [7,17]. The reduced catalysts were characterized by CO chemisorption followed by FTIR; CO adsorption has been demonstrated to be an appropriate method for the characterization of bimetallic catalysts [7,17,25,27]. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra obtained after CO adsorption over the catalysts; the spectrum obtained after CO adsorption on the YSZ support which did not show any bands is included for comparison. The spectrum corresponding to the monometallic catalyst indicated a diversity of Ni coordination sites; it showed bands due to chemisorbed CO on Ni0 in both linear (main bands centred at 2048 cm−1 and 2006 cm−1) and bridge (bands below 2000 cm−1) manners; the other low intensity bands above 2100 cm−1 are associated with CO linearly coordinated to oxidized Ni sites [28,29]. The introduction of a noble metal in the catalyst could increase the number of sites able to coordinate with CO. However, more simple spectra were obtained after CO adsorption on the bimetallic catalysts (Fig. 4) than that corresponding to the monometallic catalyst. The spectra were dominated by a single band with a maximum at 2048 cm−1 in the case of Ni–Ir and at 2056 cm−1 in the spectra corresponding to Ni–Ru and Ni–Pt. These bands are associated with CO linearly bonded to Ni or M [28]. In all cases, the presence a noble metal diminished the contribution of the bands due to bridge CO in the spectra and those assigned to CO linearly bonded to oxidized Ni; this is clearly visible for the Co–Ir catalyst whose spectrum after CO adsorption did not show any band below 2000 cm−1 or above 2100 cm−1."
7,Study of OSRP and OSRPG reactions,"3.2 Study of OSRP and OSRPG reactions As stated in the experimental section, the catalysts were tested in OSRP and OSRPG according to the following sequence of temperature: 723 K (12 h) → 773 K (12 h) → 723 K (8 h). The integral conversion, determined for each period of time, was in the range 81%–99%, depending on the catalyst, the catalytic test and the reaction temperature (Table 3 ). It can be seen that in most cases, for a given catalyst and reaction, the conversion at 773 K was higher than at 723 K. Moreover, at 723 K in both the initial and the final period and for both catalytic tests, the conversion achieved over the bimetallic catalysts was greater than that over the monometallic catalyst. As regards the product distribution determined in the outlet gas, the main products were H2 and CO2, in all cases, although lower amounts of byproducts were also found. Under the experimental conditions used, in general for a given catalyst, the H2 molar concentration was higher and that of the byproducts was lower for OSRPG than for OSRP. Besides a small amount of ethylene (the molar concentration was always ≤0.1%), only CO and CH4 were obtained as byproducts when OSRPG was carried out over the bimetallic catalysts. The molar concentration of ethylene obtained in OSRP was always higher than that obtained in OSRPG. In addition to CO, CH4 and ethylene, other byproducts such as propylene, acetaldehyde, propanal, 3-pentanone and acetone were obtained under OSRP conditions. Figs. 5–8 show the molar concentrations of the products determined in the outlet gas for both OSRP and OSRPG over the different catalysts. The performance of the catalysts referred to the selectivity of the processes depended on the presence of the noble metals; the bimetallic catalysts showed higher molar concentrations of H2 than the monometallic catalyst did; while byproduct concentrations were lower for the bimetallic catalysts (compare the results in Fig. 5 with those in Figs. 6–8). The bimetallic catalysts gave higher H2-yield than the Ni catalyst (see data in Table 3 and Figs. 5–8); this effect was greatest during the initial period of the catalytic tests at 723 K. These results emphasize the importance of the addition of the noble metal, which improved not only the alcohol conversion but the molar concentration of hydrogen. Among the bimetallic catalysts, the Ni–Ir showed the best catalytic performance; as shown in the characterization section, Ni–Ir also showed the highest reducibility."
8,Adsorption and reactivity of 1-propanol and propylene glycol over Ni–Ir and Ni catalysts as followed using FTIR,"3.3 Adsorption and reactivity of 1-propanol and propylene glycol over Ni–Ir and Ni catalysts as followed using FTIR Figs. 9 and 10 show the infrared spectra registered during the adsorption and reaction of 1-propanol and propylene glycol respectively over the Ni–Ir catalyst. After 1-propanol adsorption and thermal treatment at 373 K, several weak absorptions with maxima at ca. 1740, 1700, 1650 and 1610 cm−1 appeared (Fig. 9A). Bands in the 1800–1700 cm−1 region can be attributed to the υ(CO) of organic carbonylic species such as aldehydes and ketones, while absorptions in the 1700–1600 cm−1 region are characteristic of υ(CC) bonds. The initial presence of unsaturated aldehydes is proposed. However, the presence of propanal and/or 2-propenol cannot be ruled out [30]. After a thermal treatment at 473 K, the spectrum is dominated by two well-defined bands centred at ca. 1750 and 1650 cm−1, whereas the other bands initially present diminished in intensity. The asymmetry and width of the band at 1750 cm−1 could be related with the coexistence of different organic carbonylic compounds which could include acetaldehyde and acetone. An analysis of the υ(C–H) zone characteristic of aldehydic species (Fig. 9B) allows us to distinguish bands at 2700–2725 cm−1 and ca. 2810 cm−1, which could be assigned to the presence of acetaldehyde and acrolein, respectively [31,32]. These bands are clearly visible after thermal treatments from 473 K up to 673 K, and they vanished after heating at 723 K; the intensity of the corresponding υ(CO) bands evolves in a similar manner (Fig. 9A). Moreover, after the thermal treatment at 648 K, a low-intensity band at 3015 cm−1 arose; this band can be seen clearly in the spectra taken after treatments at 673 K and temperatures above (Fig. 9B) and could be associated to the υ(C–H) of physisorbed CH4. The corresponding spectra of the gas phase (not shown) confirmed the presence of CH4, after treatment at 648 K; at this temperature, υ(C–H) vibrations attributable to gaseous olefins were also visible and CO(g) was identified after treatment at 623 K. As stated above, Fig. 10 shows the infrared spectra corresponding to the adsorption and reactivity of propylene glycol over the Ni–Ir. After adsorption and thermal treatment at 373 K, weak absorptions with maxima at ca. 1760, 1685, 1650 and 1615 cm−1 can be observed (Fig. 10A). Only minor differences in the position of the bands with respect to those in Fig. 9A are noted; these bands could also be related with the presence of organic carbonylic species such as aldehydes and ketones, and unsaturated species with (CC) bonds. After the progressive increase in temperature up to 498 K, the presence of a broad band at 1760–1720 cm−1 and a band at 1650 cm−1 can be highlighted. However, after treatment at 523 K, the spectrum is dominated by a broad band centred at ca. 1650 cm−1 with shoulders at 1680 cm−1 and 1610 cm−1. Above 523 K no relevant bands in the 1800–1600 cm−1 region could be observed. Fig. 10B shows the corresponding spectra in the 3200–2600 cm−1 region in which the υ(C–H) vibrations can be observed. After propylene glycol adsorption and treatment at 373 K, only υ(C–H) due to CH3- and CH2- groups were observed. However, after the treatment at 473 K, a band at 3015 cm−1 due to physisorbed CH4 appeared and weak bands at 2740–2700 cm−1 and 2810 cm−1 can be observed; simultaneously, a significant diminution of the bands between 2850 and 3000 cm−1 can be seen. As already discussed, the presence of bands at 2740–2700 cm−1 is associated with an aldehydic υ(C–H) and that at 2810 cm−1 is attributed to the presence of acrolein. As expected, the intensity of these bands evolves in parallel with that of the bands in the υ(CO) region (Fig. 10A). After the treatment at 523 K, the intensity of the band at 3015 cm−1 increased and those of the other bands in the υ(C–H) region (3200–2600 cm−1) decreased. After the treatments at temperature higher than 523 K, only the band at 3015 cm−1 remained. Analogous experiments were carried out over the Ni catalyst (spectra not shown). The evolution of adsorbed species from 1-propanol was seen to be similar to that found over the bimetallic Ni–Ir catalyst. However, from the adsorption of propylene glycol on the Ni catalyst, CH4 was only detected after treatments above 548 K; a higher temperature than that observed for CH4 from propylene glycol over the Ni–Ir bimetallic catalyst."
9,Characterization of the post-reaction catalysts,"3.4 Characterization of the post-reaction catalysts The post-reaction catalysts were characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and TPO experiments. In all cases, the XRD patterns of the post-reaction catalysts (not shown) showed the presence of diffraction peaks characteristic of Ni0, which indicates a transformation of the initial NiO into Ni under OSRP and OSRPG conditions. A similar transformation was recently observed for non-promoted monometallic Ni catalysts under OSRP conditions [9]. To study the carbonaceous deposits formed during the catalytic tests, the post-reaction catalysts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and TPO experiments. The Raman spectra of the post-reaction catalysts for the 1150–1750 cm−1 zone are shown in Fig. 11 . In all cases, two bands centred at approximately 1350 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 appeared. The first band (D band) is due to poorly structured carbon deposits. The band appearing at 1590 cm−1 is usually deconvoluted into two components; the G component centred at 1540–1560 cm−1 is attributed to the in plane sp2 C–C stretching vibrations of well-structured coke or graphite-like structures [33–35]. The position of the G band (P G) for all the catalysts is given in Table 4 ; a higher value of P G is related with a higher degree of graphitization [33,35]. In contrast, the D′ component at ca.1600 cm−1 is related with less-ordered carbon deposits. From the corresponding areas, the I G/I D ratio was calculated; it is considered an index of the degree of graphitization of carbon deposits [33–35]. The I G/I D values for all the catalysts are shown in Table 4. There are not large differences in the P G or the I G/I D ratio for the different catalysts in a given process. For a given catalyst, the P G and I G/I D ratio were also similar after OSRP and OSRPG. In summary, in all cases the Raman results indicate the formation of poorly structured carbonaceous deposits, whose nature did not change very much as a function of the catalyst or the alcohol reformed. The amount of carbon deposited as estimated from TPO experiments, was always lower than 0.2% with respect to the total carbon fed."
10,Conclusions,"OSRP and OSRPG were carried out between 723 K and 773 K over calcined YSZ-supported Ni–M (M = Pt, Ru, Ir) catalysts promoted with K. During the OSRP and OSRPG reactions, the initial NiO phase is transformed to metallic Ni0. Poorly ordered carbonaceous deposits were found after reaction in quantities below 0.2% of the total carbon fed. The addition of the noble metal favoured the reduction of the catalyst and enhanced the catalytic performance of samples, mainly at 723 K; in both OSRP and OSRPG, a higher fraction of the corresponding alcohol was converted and a lower amount of byproducts was formed over the bimetallic catalysts than over the monometallic catalyst. Ni–Ir, which showed the highest reducibility, also showed the best catalytic performance. The study of chemisorbed CO on the reduced Ni–Ir catalyst indicated the presence of rather isolated Ni0 sites on its surface. The amount of Cn (n > 1) byproducts obtained in OSRPG was lower than that obtained in OSRP, this is related with the easier breaking of the propylene glycol C–C bond than that of 1-propanol, as shown by the FTIR study of 1-propanol and propylene glycol reactivity over Ni–Ir and Ni."
