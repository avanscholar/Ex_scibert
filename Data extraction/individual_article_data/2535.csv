0,Introduction,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are extensively recognized as worldwide environmental pollutants due to their bioaccumulative and toxic potential [1,2]. Long chain length PFASs (i.e. ≥ C6 for perfluorosulfonic acids, PFSAs, and ≥ C7 for perfluorocarboxylic acids, PFCAs) are persistent and non-biodegradable and have been detected at elevated concentrations in surface waters [3,4], groundwater [5,6] and drinking water [7,8]. The manufacture of numerous PFASs including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been phased out in Europe and North America, and its precursors were phased out in 2002 [9]; different PFASs have been introduced as replacement chemicals. Recent production phase-outs have led to shifts in formulations, frequently to short-chain or semi-fluorinated substances [10,11]. The most common substitute compound used is 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate acid (6:2 FTS) or its salts and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH) [12]. Hence, there has been an on-going industrial transition for replacement of long-chain PFASs and their precursors in recent years. In addition to this, although the manufacture of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) including PFOA have been mostly controlled, they are generated from various precursor compounds such as FTOHs [13–15]. Recent studies showed that atmospheric degradation of FTOHs is expected to contribute to the extensive distribution of PFCAs [16,17]. Atmospheric oxidation of FTOHs can be originated by reaction with OH radicals [18]. It is also observed that Cl atoms may initiate the oxidation of FTOHs and more than 90 % of reactions of both OH radicals and Cl atoms with FTOHs occur through abstraction of hydrogen atom from the − CH2 − group [16]. To date, biotransformation of 6:2 FTOH by microorganisms has been reported in soils [19,20], activated sludge [21], sediments [22,23], and bacterial and fungal cultures [24,25]. These studies observed that perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA) were the final intermediates, indicating the formation of PFCAs during 6:2 FTOH biotransformation. Furthermore, degradation byproducts including saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer aldehydes and carboxylic acids were detected, which have been found to be more toxic than PFCAs [26]. Recent studies also demonstrated that 6:2 FTOH was the biotransformation byproduct of fluorotelomer-based compounds such as 6:2 fluorotelomer iodide, 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate, 6:2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphates, and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaine [25,27,28]. Consequently, it is essential to examine the transformation and degradation products of precursors for avoiding the pollution expansion of PFCAs. The removal and/or degradation of PFASs is still a challenge since conventional treatment technologies have been reported ineffective [29,30]. Therefore, there is a growing need for the development of novel and effective processes to provide degradation of PFASs for environmental protection. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as electrochemical oxidation, photocatalytic ozonation, O3/H2O2 and UV/H2O2 have been reported to effectively decompose most PFASs including PFOA, PFOS, perfluoro decanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoro dodecanoic acid (PFDDA), perfluoro tridecanoic acid (PFTrDA), perfluoro tetra decanoic acid (PFTeDA), perfluoro hexadecenoic acid (PFHxDA), perfluoro octadecanoic acid (PFODA), and 6:2 FTS [31–39]. AOPs are based on the production of free radicals which are capable of degrading organic contaminants. Among the free radicals, hydroxyl radical (OH∙) is one of the most reactive and strongest free radical (E° = 2.33 V), reacting with several groups of organic compounds [40,41]. UV photolysis, UV/H2O2, ozonation, O3/H2O2, and electrochemical oxidation can generate OH∙ and other free radicals and effectively degrade certain organic pollutants. It is well known from literature that the combination of UV with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) provides improved oxidative degradation of contaminants by the production of hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are generated during UV process via absorption of UV light by H2O2; by means of peroxidic bond photolysis according to the following equation [42,43] (1) H2O2 + hv → 2OH UV-based AOPs degrade pollutants in two ways: (1) some pollutants directly absorb UV light, and absorption of this high-energy radiation can provide destruction of chemical bonds and following breakdown of the pollutant [44] and (2) some organics cannot be degraded very rapidly and effectively by direct photolysis. Hence, H2O2 addition to the UV process produces AOP conditions, and significantly increases the rate of pollutant degradation. H2O2 absorbs UV light, and breaks down into OH radicals [45]. In the case of ozonation, organic contaminants are also oxidized in two ways: (1) ozone itself, which is a very selective oxidant, can directly react with dissolved pollutants [46] and (2) ozone decomposes via a chain reaction mechanism to form hydroxyl radicals, which in turn can degrade the pollutant [47]. When hydrogen peroxide is added to the ozonation process, the decomposition of O3 into OH radicals is enhanced, basically shifting the process completely to an AOP. Very few studies have been published on degradation of PFAS precursors by advanced oxidation processes. For example, Yang et al. investigated 6:2 FTS degradation under various AOPs including UV irradiation, UV/H2O2, alkaline ozonation, peroxone (O3/H2O2), and Fenton reagent oxidation (Fe2+/H2O2). They observed high yields of SO4 2− and F− indicating 6:2 FTS can be almost completely desulfonated and defluorinated during UV/H2O2 process [48]. Another study evaluated photodegradation of 8:2 FTOH in lake water samples. It was observed that hydroxyl radical was the main oxidation agent and nitrate enhanced the photolysis whereas natural organic matter (NOM) diminished it. The half-life of 8:2 FTOH was determined as 0.83 ± 0.20 h in the presence of 10 mM H2O2. However, no significant degradation was observed by direct photolysis [49]. The major objective of this study was to evaluate the fate and degradation of a newly produced polyfluorinated telomer alcohol, TFHFESE, which is used in the production of textile, leather, and paper products by different advanced oxidation processes including UV photolysis, UV/H2O2, ozonation, and O3/H2O2 since there is no study in literature. Solar and solar/H2O2 photolysis of TFHFESE was also evaluated. Furthermore, the identification of degradation by-products was performed to assess environmental fate of TFHFESE, and for mechanistic degradation pathways. Tests were also conducted with river water to evaluate the effect of water matrix on degradation efficiency."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals and water samples,"2.1 Chemicals and water samples 2-(1,1,2-trifluoro-2-hepta fluoropyloxy-ethylsulfonyl)-ethanol, the novel polyfluorinated telomer alcohol (TFHFESE), was obtained from Merck KGaA, Germany and its chemical structure can be found in Fig. 1 . Hydrogen peroxide 30 wt. % in H2O and isopropanol 70 % in water (in volume) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. River water samples were collected from the Schuylkill River (Philadelphia, PA) representing surface water in eastern Pennsylvania, USA. River water samples were spiked with the target level of TFHFESE and its characteristics are listed in Table 1 ."
3,Analytical procedures,"2.2 Analytical procedures The analysis of the polyfluorinated telomer alcohol and its degradation by-products were performed by liquid-liquid-extraction (LLE), followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. 5 mL of sample was placed into a separation funnel, then 5 mL of hexane and 2 g of NaCl were added. The solution was mixed via vortex mixer and allowed for phase separation for 15 s. The aqueous phase was discarded, and the organic phase was used for analysis. The GC/MS analysis was performed by an Agilent 7890A GC coupled with a 5975C MS in Electron Ionization (EI) mode. An Agilent J&W CP6012 capillary column (30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 μm film thickness) was used. High purity helium was used as a carrier gas and purge flow rate was 50 mL/min. The head pressure was 60 kPa of helium and 5 μL injection volume was used. Initial oven temperature was 70 °C, held for 2 min, and then ramped to 90 °C at a rate of 7 °C/min. Finally, the oven temperature was ramped to 270 °C at 20 °C/min and held for 5 min. While transfer line temperature to the MS was maintained at 230 °C, ion source temperature was 250 °C, and electron energy was 70 eV. Analytes were quantified using a six-point calibration curve (Fig. SM-1). Calibration standards and one blank sample (hexane) were run for every batch of 7 samples for quality control. Spike and recovery experiments were also performed to determine method detection limit (MDL) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for TFHFESE, and data is presented in Table SM-1. MDL and LOQ were calculated from the concentrations of TFHFESE that yielded a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of higher than or equal to 3 and 10, respectively."
4,AOP procedures,"2.3 AOP procedures TFHFESE stock solution was made using deionized (DI) water and river water. The initial concentration of TFHFESE was 10 ppm. All the experiments were conducted in a batch mode at room temperature and were duplicated. For the ozonation process, an ozone generator (Wedeco, USA) was used to produce O3 from pure O2 gas (99.9 %). The O3 concentration in the ozone generator effluent (O3 and O2 gas mixture) was adjusted by changing the ozone flow rate. The reactor column was filled with sample (2 L) and the ozone gas was then sparged into the reactor at flow rates of 10, 30, and 75 L/h through a porous spherical diffuser (∼30 μm pore diameter) placed at the bottom of the reactor. Mixing was also provided with a magnetic stirrer. Excess ozone from the reactor was sent to a thermal ozone destruction unit. The inlet concentration of ozone in the gas phase was monitored by ozone analyzer and the effluent ozone gas concentration was measured according to the Standard Method 2350 E (the iodometric method with KI solution) [50]. Ozone mass transfer studies were performed for ozonation experiments. Inlet and outlet ozone concentration in the gas phase was measured via BMT 864C Ozone analyzers. Feed gas flowrates were adjusted as 10, 30 and 75 L/h. The aqueous ozone concentration was also measured in different time intervals using standard iodometry method described elsewhere [51]. Mass transfer coefficients (KLa) were measured according to the mass balance of ozone at steady state (Eq. (2)): (2) d C d t = K L a [ C e - C ] Where Ce is the equilibrium aqueous ozone concentration and C is the dissolved ozone concentration. Ce values were determined when the concentration of dissolved ozone in water was constant with the ozonation time. Integration of the equation with boundaries of C = 0 at t = 0 and C = C at t = t gives; (3) ln C e - C C e = - K L a x t The values of K La (min–1) can be determined by plotting ln C e - C C e vs. time (t). Ozone mass transfer coefficients relative to flow rate can be seen in Fig. 2 . As shown, K La values increased with the increase in flow rates. For example, while ozone mass transfer coefficient was 0.8809 min−1 at 75 L/h ozone flow rate, it was 0.1659 min−1 for flow rate of 10 L/h. Increase in the gas flow rate enhances the number of bubbles as well as superficial velocity, resulting in lower film transfer resistance and higher interfacial surface area. This was in agreement with the previously reported studies [52–54]. Fig. 2 For the UV photolysis, experiments were conducted using a collimated beam device (CBD). The UV lamp emitted 244 nm UV light. The volume of the solution was 100 mL in each experiment. UV intensity was determined with Uridine test method and a calibrated radiometer (UVX digital radiometer, Ultraviolet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) equipped with 365 or 254-nm sensor to provide accurate results. For the Uridine test method, phosphate buffer solution (approx. pH 6.88) and 0.007 mol/L Uridine stock solution were prepared. Then 0.014 mmol/L Uridine was prepared by dissolving the stock solution and adding 25 mL of phosphate buffer. The petri dish was filled with 100 mL of 0.014 mmol/L Uridine sample. The sample was irradiated for 300, 600, 900 and 1200 s. The samples were then measured at wavelength of 262 nm. This protocol was repeated three times and UV intensity was calculated. The measured UV intensities by uridine method and a radiometer showed good correlation as indicated in Fig. SM-2. UV intensity was then adjusted by changing the distance between the Petri-dish (on the base of the stand) and the UV lamp. For UV/H2O2 and O3/H2O2 processes, different amounts of H2O2 were added to the solutions. The other parts of the experiments were the same as UV photolysis and ozonation processes. For the solar photolysis, experiments were conducted using a solar lamp emitting 400 nm UV light. The power, lumen and color temperature of the solar lamp were 1000 W, 140,000 lm and 2000 K, respectively. The volume of the solution was 200 mL in each experiment. UV intensity was determined using the approach described above."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Degradation of TFHFESE by O3 and O3/H2O2,"3.1 Degradation of TFHFESE by O3 and O3/H2O2 Fig. 3 (a) shows TFHFESE degradation efficiencies for different ozone flow rates. As shown, the ozone flow rate had a significant effect on the fluorotelomer PFAS degradation. For example, ozone flow rate of 30 L/h provided higher removal (68 %) when compared to 50 % removal with 10 L/h after 120 min of reaction. Further increase in ozone flow rate to 75 L/h also showed an increase on the degradation efficiency (approximately 76 %). This can be expected considering ozone mass transfer coefficients which was determined as the highest with ozone flow rate of 75 L/h. In literature, ozonation process has mostly been found ineffective for well-known PFASs such as PFOA and PFOS with degradation efficiencies ranging between 8–35 % [32,55,56]. On the other hand, 6:2 FTS was reported as more degradable than PFOS in alkaline ozonation process (Yang, 2014). Fig. 3 (a) also shows the fluoride release during the ozonation process at 75 L/h ozone flow rate. After 120 min of process time, fluoride concentration was measured as 5.4 ppm which corresponds to almost 98 % defluorination. Huang et al. (2016) reported that only 0.5 % of fluoride was produced in 4 h by ozonation process [32]. Lin et al. (2012) also stated that PFOA was degraded by 99 % in 4 h by altering the ozone dose and solution pH. However, the ozone flow rate in their study was much higher and provided at higher alkaline condition (pH 11). It can be deduced from Fig. 3 (a) that the defluorination rate was higher than TFHFESE degradation rate during the ozonation process. This suggests that the reaction intermediates degraded faster than the parent compound. Combining O3 with H2O2 to enhance degradation efficiency has been researched for the removal of refractory pollutants [53,57,58]. Experiments were performed in the presence of H2O2 with concentrations ranging between 5−100 mM. As shown in Fig. 3 (b), addition of H2O2 reduced the removal of TFHFESE. The reduction of degradation efficiency was more significant with increasing H2O2 concentrations. The negative outcomes with H2O2 addition indicate scavenging of hydroxyl radical by the hydrogen peroxide when H2O2 is in excess relative to aqueous O3. Excessive H2O2 would compete with target pollutants for hydroxyl radical [59–61]."
7,Degradation of TFHFESE by UV photolysis and UV/H2O2,"3.2 Degradation of TFHFESE by UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 Aqueous solution of TFHFESE was irradiated with UV light of different intensities (Fig. 4 (a)). As shown, TFHFESE was degraded by almost 50 % after 30 min of UV exposure for both UV intensities. At the end of process time (2 h), the degradation of TFHFESE was 93 % and 97.8 % for UV intensities of 2.1 and 3 mW/cm2, respectively. The combination of UV irradiation and H2O2 at different concentrations was also examined. In this case, the UV intensity of 3 mW/cm2 was applied. The results can be seen in Fig. 4 (b). As shown, 97.2 % degradation efficiency was obtained with 25 mM H2O2 at only 45 min, while the degradation efficiency was 73.7 % at the same process time with UV photolysis. Adding H2O2 increased the efficiency and shortened the process time (45 min) to achieve similar degradation rate. However, further increase in H2O2 concentration (above 25 mM) did not provide additional removal as excess H2O2 may act as a radical scavenger which in turn decreased the degradation efficiency. Photolysis may occur directly or indirectly. The energy provided by the UV rays causes certain chemical reactions, such as disintegration, isomerization, hydrogen atom abstraction, intramolecular rearrangements, electron transfer in a molecule and dimerization [62] during direct photolysis. Indirect photolysis occurs when a secondary molecule (oxidative radicals) undergoes one or more of the above reactions and then reacts with the target pollutant. In our case, it seems that indirect photolysis is a more likely pathway for TFHFESE degradation as UV/H2O2 process enhanced the degradation efficiency. This may be attributed to the production of OH∙, perhydroxyl radicals (HO2∙), and superoxide anion (O2∙). Similar conclusion was stated by another study for the photolysis of 8:2 FTOH [49]. For example, it was observed that rapid degradation of 8:2 FTOH and simultaneous increase of 8:2 FTAL, which was determined as degradation byproduct, in the presence of 10 mM H2O2 during UV/H2O2 AOP in 4 h. Another study reported that UV irradiation was unsuccessful to degrade 6:2 FTS as only 10 % of removal was achieved using 300-W high-pressure mercury lamp [48]. However, more than 90 % degradation efficiency was gained in the presence of H2O2 (20−40 mM). These studies suggest that OH plays an important role for the degradation of fluorotelomers by UV/H2O2 process. However, this is in contrast to O3/H2O2 process where lower degradation was observed in our study due to presence of hydrogen peroxide. Fluoride formation was monitored during UV photolysis (Fig. 4 (a)) and UV/H2O2 (Fig. 4 (b)) processes. For sole UV photolysis, sharp increase on fluoride concentration was observed after 60 min of process time. The final fluoride concentration was measured as 1.25 ppm corresponding 23 % defluorination ratio (Fig. 4 (a)). This ratio was lower than that obtained in ozonation process in spite of much higher degradation rate during UV photolysis. This may be attributed to the rapid volatilization of −OH group and the formation of lower-chained intermediates. It seems that formed intermediates cannot be further degraded during UV photolysis. Fig. 4 (b) shows the fluoride formation during UV/H2O2 process. As seen, much higher fluoride formation of 96 % was observed when compared to sole UV photolysis. This ratio was very similar to that obtained in sole ozonation process. This suggests that with UV light, in the presence of H2O2, provided almost complete degradation of TFHFESE as well as the formed intermediates during the process to CO2 and HF owing to formed hydroxyl radicals."
8,Photodegradation of TFHFESE by solar photolysis and solar photolysis/H2O2 processes,"3.3 Photodegradation of TFHFESE by solar photolysis and solar photolysis/H2O2 processes As seen in Fig. 5 (a), 76.4 % of the initial TFHFESE was degraded after only 30 min of solar irradiation with UV intensity of 0.36 mW/cm2. Increasing light intensity did not increase degradation efficiency. 98.2 % degradation efficiency was achieved in 45 min. Final concentration of TFHFESE was measured as 0.1 ppm by 99 % degradation efficiency for both applied UV intensities. In contrast to higher degradation rates, only 0.16 ppm fluoride formation was observed after 45 min of process time. The final defluorination ratio was only 12.7 %. Similar to UV photolysis, while degradation of parent compound was quite high as almost complete degradation was achieved, the defluorination ratio was fairly low due to volatilization of −OH group and formation of intermediates. It can be said that solar photolysis was not efficient to degrade formed intermediates. Solar photolysis was also applied to TFHFESE in the presence of H2O2 and the results are given in Fig. 5 (b). As seen, TFHFESE degradation efficiency was almost the same as single solar photolysis. However, fluoride release was three times higher during solar photolysis/H2O2 process. Fluoride release was observed within 15 min of process time in contrast to single solar photolysis. The defluorination ratio was determined as 35 % after 2 h of irradiation time. Produced hydroxyl radicals may be responsible for higher defluorination ratios obtained in solar photolysis/H2O2 process as the solar lamp used in this study has near UV spectra which may be enhanced the absorption of solar photons by H2O2 [63]. However, this ratio was still lower than that obtained in sole ozonation and UV/H2O2 processes. This can be concluded to inadequate production of hydroxyl radicals during solar photolysis/H2O2 process compared to UV/H2O2 processes. For the process comparison during degradation and defluorination of TFHFESE, reaction rate constants are given in Table 2 . The rate constant values of TFHFESE degradation were fitted to pseudo-first order rate equation and they were determined as 0.0391, 0.0526, 0.0106, 0.0051, 0.0566 and 0.063 min−1 for the UV, UV/H2O2, O3, O3/H2O2, solar photolysis and solar/H2O2, respectively. For comparison, the degradation rate constant was observed as 0.0138 min−1 in the presence of 10 mM H2O2 with UV intensity of 76.5 mW/cm2 on photolysis of 8:2 FTOH [49] which was 2.8 order of magnitude lower than the determined value in this study at much lower UV intensity (3 mW/cm2) during UV/H2O2 process. They [49] also determined degradation rate constant in the presence of 100 μM H2O2, at the same UV intensity, as 0.0003 min−1 which was 130 order of magnitude lower than found in our study. Reaction rate of TFHFESE defluorination was also calculated by the below equation: (4) d [ F - ] d t = k 0 where k 0 is the pseudo-zero order rate constant (min−1), t is the process time (min) and [F-] is the fluoride concentration (mg/L). The rate constant values of TFHFESE defluorination were determined as 0.0104, 0.0420, 0.0549, 0.0314, 0.0029 and 0.0051 mg L−1 min−1 for the UV, UV/H2O2, O3, O3/H2O2, solar photolysis and solar/H2O2, respectively. For another comparison of the UV, UV/H2O2, and O3 processes which provided high degradation/defluorination efficiencies, energy consumption was also evaluated. The energy consumption was calculated for UV-based processes as follows [64]: (5) E U V ( k W h g T F H F E S E r e m o v e d ) = 1000 x p x t V ( C 0 - C t ) Where E is energy consumption, p is power rating of system (W), t is process time (h), V is reactor volume (L) and C0 and Ct are initial and final concentration of TFHFESE (mg/L), respectively. For ozonation following equation is used: (6) E O z o n a t i o n k W h g T F H F E S E r e m o v e d = r × C O 3 ( P C T 0 - P C T t ) × V Where r is the energy need for ozone production (15 kW h/kg) [65], and CO3 is the amount of consumed ozone (g) which was calculated according to Eq. (7): (7) C O 3 = Q g ∫ 0 t [ O 3 ] i n l e t d t Where Qg is the gas ﬂow rate (L/h) and [O3]inlet is the inlet O3 concentration (mg/L). Accordingly, energy consumption values were calculated as 0.93, 0.92, and 2.04 kW h/g for UV, UV/H2O2 and ozonation processes, respectively. The most cost-effective process was UV/H2O2 in terms of energy consumption, however, it should be noted that the cost for H2O2 should also be included for operational cost which will increase the cost of UV/H2O2 process."
9,The effect of water matrix on TFHFESE degradation by different AOPs,"3.4 The effect of water matrix on TFHFESE degradation by different AOPs In this part, the solution containing the PFAS was prepared in river water collected from Schuylkill River, Philadelphia. UV photolysis, solar photolysis and ozonation processes were performed. As seen from Fig. 6 , UV photolysis, solar light and ozone can also degrade TFHFESE in river water. For UV photolysis, the removal in DI water was higher than that in river water for the initial reaction stage, while it became lower than in river water at the late reaction stage. For example, the removal rates were 57 % and 71 % in river water and DI water, respectively at 30 min of process time. However, at the end of the process, the degradation efficiencies were almost identical (98.6 % and 97.8 % in river water and DI water, respectively). At the initial stage, a major percentage of available photon energy may be used for photolysis of inorganic constituents in river water, especially nitrite (see Table 1). Once the nitrite is consumed in the solution (at the late stage of the reaction), the degradation rate of TFHFESE may increase in river water. Besides, when nitrite undergoes a photochemical reaction, free radicals might be produced which enhance the degradation efficiency at the late stages. In the case of ozonation, the removal in river water was always lower than in DI water. The influence of organic and inorganic constituents in river water reduced the degradation rate during ozonation process. Similar behavior was observed during ozonation of various pollutants. For example, it was reported that the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene during ozonation process remarkably reduced in tap water as compared to pure water [66]. While the degradation efficiency lowered by 12 % in 10 min of ozonation, higher decrease of 21 % was observed at late stage of ozonation. It was concluded that the decrease in ozonation was due to the interference of water constituents, in particular NOM, in tap water on ozonation. They also observed that high concentrations of NOM showed stronger negative effect on the efficiency. Thus, NOM may be responsible in the reduction of degradation rate during ozonation because NOM would react with ozone [66]. It is also known that phosphates can scavenge hydroxyl radicals during ozonation process [67]. It was observed that the scavenging effect of phosphates with the concentrations ranging between 7 and 50 mg/L during ozonation process was much higher as compared to non-buffered system where no phosphates were present [68]. In our case, since phosphate concentration was about 16 mg/L in river water, phosphate would reduce the ozonation performance. However, no significant effect of water matrix was observed for solar photolysis since more than 99 % removals were obtained for both DI and river water. Even at the initial stage of the process, the removal efficiencies were very similar. For instance, the removal was 93.3 % in DI water while it was measured as 93.8 % in river water at 30 min of process time. The final concentrations of TFHFESE were measured as 0.5, 0.2 and 3.7 ppm for UV photolysis, solar photolysis and ozonation processes, respectively. Very high removal efficiencies were gained for UV processes. Ozone can also degrade TFHFESE but was less effective in river water."
10,Degradation mechanism of TFHFESE,"3.5 Degradation mechanism of TFHFESE To further investigate the mechanism of TFHFESE degradation by O3, UV, UV/H2O2, solar and solar/H2O2 photolysis processes, several experiments were performed using isoproponal as radical scavenger. Isopropanol; (i-PrOH) is well known as hydroxyl radical scavenger with the reaction rate constant (k OH /i-PrOH) of 1.9 × 109 M−1 s-1 [67]. All experiments were conducted under following conditions: 3 mW/cm2, 3 mW/cm2-25 mM H2O2, 75 L/h, 75 L/h-5 mM H2O2, 0.55 mW/cm2 and 0.55 mW/cm2-25 mM H2O2 for UV, UV/H2O2, O3, O3/H2O2, solar photolysis and solar/H2O2 processes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the defluorination of TFHFESE in the presence of i-PrOH was very similar to the results obtained in DI water during only ozonation process. It is reasonable to suggest that hydroxyl radicals, which may be formed by self-decomposition of ozone, were not the major oxidative species for degradation of TFHFESE during ozonation process. This can also explain lower degradation ratios in the O3/H2O2 system compared to single ozonation process where higher hydroxyl radical formation can be expected. Besides, as mentioned previously, ozonation was less effective in river water which contained NOM than in DI water due to its possible negative effect of NOM. Thus, the degradation of TFHFESE by ozone-based advanced oxidation processes was mostly promoted by the reaction of ozone and the compound rather than via hydroxyl radicals. TFHFESE appears to have higher reactivity with ozone than with hydroxyl radicals. In the case of solar photolysis and solar photolysis/H2O2 system (Fig. 7 (b)), the reduction in defluorination ratio of TFHFESE was observed in the presence of i-PrOH. However, the defluorination ratio decreased more significantly for Solar/H2O2 system as compared to single solar photolysis. While the defluorination ratio of TFHFESE was measured as 12 % after 2 h of solar photolysis, it reduced to 10 % with the addition of i-PrOH. Defluorination ratio was 35 % in the solar/H2O2 system without i-PrOH, but it was noticeably inhibited by addition of i-PrOH with a decrease of 30 %. This shows that the presence of i-PrOH quenched the generated hydroxyl radicals during solar/H2O2 system. It may said that TFHFESE was degraded by hydroxyl radicals in solar/H2O2 process. The most significant decrease in the process efficiency was observed for UV/H2O2 processes (Fig. 7 (c)). The defluorination ratio decreased to 41 % from 96 % in the presence of i-PrOH. Similar to solar photolysis, this can be attributed to scavenging activity of i-PrOH which compete with the TFHFESE for the hydroxyl radicals. In the case of single UV photolysis, i-PrOH also decreased the defluorination efficiency. However, since hydroxyl radical generation was not significant in UV photolysis as it was in UV/H2O2 process, defluorination ratio decreased by 3.8 % resulting in 19 % defluorination. This demonstrates the lower defluorination ratio obtained in single UV photolysis due to lower hydroxyl radical generation and the role of hydroxyl radicals on the defluorination efficiency of TFHFESE. Further research was performed in order to understand the degradation mechanism during different AOPs. The GC/MS chromatogram of UV photolyzed TFHFESE is shown in Fig. SM-3 (a). The large peaks were observed at m/z values of 136, 293, 313 and 327. Based on those identified intermediates, the degradation pathway of TFHFESE during UV photolysis can be proposed as shown in Fig. 8 which is indicated by red arrows. The formed intermediate m/z 327 confirmed the rapid volatilization of the OH group as mentioned in the previous sections. Then, CH2 group abstraction occurs which resulted in the formation of intermediate m/z 313. The formed intermediate m/z 313 then undergoes HF elimination to give the intermediate m/z 293. This is followed by CF2 flake off process causing the formation of intermediate m/z 136. The CF2 flake off was also observed during the degradation of FTOHs in literature [48,49]. The formation of intermediates during ozonation process is shown in Fig. SM-3 (b). As seen, the large peaks were detected at m/z values of 136, 293, and 313. It should be noted that the abundance of peaks is much lower comparing both UV processes. This explains the higher defluorination ratio of ozonation process and lower defluorination ratios of UV processes. It can be said that high amounts of intermediates were formed in UV processes causing lower defluorination ratios. Comparing UV photolysis, the intermediate m/z 327 was not observed as vaporization did not take place during ozonation process. TFHFESE degradation pathway by ozone is shown in Fig. 8 with blue arrows and as seen, the pathway followed the same pathway as occurred in UV photolysis except the formation of intermediate m/z 327. The chromatogram of solar irradiated TFHFESE is shown in Fig. SM-3 (c). As seen, in addition to intermediates of UV photolyzed TFHFESE, the intermediate m/z 142 was also identified in solar irradiation process. The proposed pathway can be seen in Fig. 8 with green arrows. Accordingly, degradation pathway of TFHFESE by solar irradiation followed the same pathway with UV photolysis process. The formation of intermediate m/z 327 was also observed in solar irradiation which confirms the volatilization of TFHFESE. The only difference in degradation pathway compared to UV photolysis process was that after the formation of intermediate m/z 293, the degradation could follow two pathways: the first one is the formation of intermediate m/z 131 due to CF2 flake off, and the second one is that the intermediate m/z 142 is formed after oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radical and/or reactive oxygen species. The abundance and number of identified intermediates were higher comparing UV photolysis and ozonation which confirms the much lower defluorination ratio of solar irradiation process."
11,Conclusion,"The newly produced replacement PFAS, 2-(1,1,2-trifluoro-2-hepta fluoropyloxy-ethylsulfonyl)-ethanol (TFHFESE), was tested under different processes, including AOPs, such as UV photolysis, UV/H2O2, solar irradiation with and without H2O2, ozonation, and O3/H2O2. UV photolysis, UV/H2O2, solar irradiation and solar irradiation/H2O2 provided almost complete degradation efficiencies in terms of parent compound. The presence of H2O2 for UV processes increased the defluorination ratio and cut the process time. Ozonation was also effective with 75.9 % degradation efficiency. However, the degradation efficiency decreased with adding H2O2 in ozonation due to scavenging effect of H2O2 on hydroxyl radical. The highest yield of fluoride was obtained for sole ozonation process (98 %). In spite of complete removal, the much lower defluorination ratios for photodegradation processes comparing ozonation was concluded to vaporization of −OH group and inadequate degradation of formed intermediates. This conclusion was corroborated with the identified degradation by-product m/z 327. For UV photolysis, four intermediates were identified with m/z values of 136, 293, 313 and 327. The mass spectrum of solar irradiated sample showed also an additional by-product corresponding m/z value of 142 comparing UV photolyzed sample. Intermediates with m/z values of 136, 293 and 313 were identified for ozonated sample. The degradation pathways during AOPs involved the loss of CH2 group, HF elimination, CF2 flake off and oxidative degradations. Hydroxyl radicals were the main oxidative agents for photodegradation systems. However, direct reaction with ozone was the major factor for the defluorination and degradation of TFHFESE during ozone-based AOPs. The effect of water matrix (DI water and river water) on degradation of TFHFESE by UV photolysis, solar irradiation and ozonation processes was also investigated. While inorganic constituents of river water diminished the degradation rate during ozonation, no significant effect of water matrix was observed for UV processes except initial stage of UV photolysis. In conclusion, TFHFESE, as an alternative to PFAS was degradable in AOPs tested in this study where single ozonation and UV/H2O2 processes seemed to be the most effective processes considering degradation and defluorination efficiencies."
