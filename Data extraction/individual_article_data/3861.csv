0,Introduction,"While growing demand for energy and declining fossil fuel resources will create a major challenge to the world, renewable energy could be a key to solve this problem. One of the renewable energy sources is wind energy, which has been significantly considered by researchers in recent years [1]. Electricity generation using wind energy stores billions of barrels of crude oil and prevents the emission of environmental pollutants [2]. Given the multiple advantages of wind energy, due to its variable nature and incompatibility of power generation and demand (lack of power supply during peak hours and surplus production during low demand hours), the use of these systems is followed by some problems [3]. Hence, to use wind turbines in high-reliability independent systems, it is necessary to use other renewable sources such as solar energy as an integrated system. Moreover, the exploitation of energy storage systems that store energy at low load times and discharge it at the peak load times can help increase network security, generate more power, and decrease fluctuations in output power [4]. In this regard, Ryu et al. [5] studied the effect of an energy storage system (EES) on the energy system, which utilized photovoltaic panels (PV)/horizontal wind turbine (HWT), as the primary source of energy and diesel fuel generator (DFG), as the secondary source to respond to the load. According to their results, it was found that using a large EES with the help of DFG could increase the flexibility of the hybrid energy system and lead to a definite reduction in electricity. Another study investigated the best configuration of solar/wind/battery system (electrochemical storage)/hydrogen (chemical storage). The results revealed that solar/wind/battery as a hybrid system showed better performance, while a solar/wind/hydrogen system (with fuel cell) has a very high potential in the near future as a clean and reliable system [6]. Numerous studies have been conducted on the use of integrated renewable energy systems [7,8]. In this regard, Bajpai and Dash [9] addressed energy management, optimization, and use of renewable hybrid systems and studied modeling of power backup systems (fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and diesel), PV systems, Sync units (converters and single battery charge), and energy flow management techniques. Moreover, Lee et al. [10] investigated the technical-economic performance of an HRES using dynamic simulation and compared it with practical results obtained from a town in South Korea. Their proposed system utilized solar thermal collector/PV/Seasonal TES/Heat and Power in comparison with the two conventional gas-fired boiler/PV and centralized Heat and Power/PV systems. Their results demonstrated that this system has the best performance in comparison to the other two systems, and increasing the solar contribution (up to 42%) by changing the size of the solar system and STES caused excellent performance of the energy storage system. Utilizing the integrated HRESs for simultaneous supply of power, cooling, and heating are important alternatives to the current conventional systems. Therefore, Bahlawan et al. [11] presented three different configurations using PV/solar thermal collector (STC)/combined heat and power/absorption chiller/organic Rankine cycle/air source Heat Power/ground source heat power (GSHP)/Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems to reduce the primary energy of construction and operation of the hybrid power plant. According to the results of this study, it was found that the use of such hybrid systems allows up to 17% of primary energy storage compared to conventional power plants. Due to the reduction in greenhouse gas emission and the cost of water production, use of the renewable systems has been largely attracted to produce fresh water. In another research, Mito et al. [12] studied the design, simulation, and economic analysis of hybrid systems, and their findings demonstrated that half of the energy consumption was stored through an optimal hybrid system. Khan et al. [13] reviewed the various combination energy systems to supply the required energy for water purification. It was highlighted that the replacement of fossil fuel by renewable sources could resolve the problem of air pollution significantly. Also, the evaluations implied that PV/HWT/Reverse Osmosis (RO) hybrid system has a good potential to be used as integrated HRES. One of the most important concerns in designing HRSs as a microgrid is to meet the common network needs, maximize integration in the HRES, prevent energy waste and overload, and reduce production costs. Therefore, Mellouk et al. [14] addressed these concerns to optimize a network consisting of HWT/PV/CPV/PTC/Solar steam turbine/Battery in Morocco. The results showed that the hybrid system is very promising in terms of energy costs (0.17 US $/kWh) and replacement rate with fossil fuel. Maleki [15] designed, simulated, and optimized six configurations using solar/wind/battery/RO desalination/Hydrogen to design the grid-independent hybrid renewable energy systems (GIHRES). It was found that in addition to its ability to meet the network load and higher access to fresh water, the solar/battery/RO desalination hybrid system is the most economical, while GIHRES-based hydrogen energy storage systems will be observed to be very affordable in the near future and reliable to provide the energy needed. Regarding the fact that novel technologies are being introduced and used in energy systems to explore eco-friendly and sustainable energy resources, various materials and devices have been developed up to now. Notably, thermoelectric has been pioneered as one of the promising alternatives for energy harvesting. The principle of such technology relies on the particular physico-thermal properties as enable them to heat, cool, or generate electricity. Although thermoelectrics have multiple benefits, including precise function, durability, and lack of moving parts, limited energy efficiency, and high cost inhibit their contribution to the energy systems [16]. Along with energy harvesting advances, the energy storage systems have also been explored to improve the efficiency and performance of different heat and power systems [17]. In addition to electrochemical and chemical storage, thermal energy storage has been used in energy management systems [18,19]. The mechanism of these systems relies on the enthalpy of phase change materials (PCMs) which can be in the form of microcapsules [20], nanocapsules [21], or intensified [22]. To date, a lot of research has been done on the synthesis of the encapsulated PCMs [23,24]. However, nanoscale encapsulation has been attracted by researchers due to its higher specific surface area and better thermal stability rather than microcapsules [25]. With regard to the numerous factors influencing encapsulation efficiency of the PCMs, the use of optimization techniques based on experimental design is necessary for a more accurate examination of the effect of parameters on the physico-thermal properties of particles. Previously, the impact of PCM to monomer, surfactant to monomer, stirring speed, and temperature on encapsulation of Lauric acid based on emulsion polymerization was investigated and Microcapsules with a latent of 167.2 kJ/kg and encapsulation efficiency of 91% was obtained. In which, it was observed that stirring speed and temperature impacts were neglectable on their system. Also, a higher amount of surfactants resulted in a smaller capsule that could increase the specific surface, while in a constant amount of monomer, the encapsulation efficiency would be lower due to lack of sufficient shell [26]. In another study, the optimization of paraffin wax encapsulation via suspension polymerization based on design parameters of initiator to monomer, PCM to monomer, emulsifier to monomer, and water to monomer was implemented. The results showed that by increasing the weight ratio of initiator to monomer the efficiency would be lower while it would result in smaller particles while the higher PCM to monomer weight had a positive effect on the latent heat. In the optimal condition, microcapsules reached a 148.5 kJ/kg latent heat and the encapsulation efficiency of 78.5% [27]. To the best of our knowledge, no experimental design has been performed to optimize the encapsulation efficiency of n-Octadecane based on the influential factors of monomer to PCM weight ratio, emulsifier to PCM weight ratio%, and polymerization reaction temperature by RSM through miniemulsion polymerization method, which is an effective method in simulation of practical experiments. Polymerization of the PCMs requires heat, power, and water, which needs energy consumption, while the use of fossil fuels to provide this energy is followed by the production of environmental pollutants. Efforts to synthesize the PCMs with less energy have already used methods such as UV-irradiation [28], but no comprehensive effort has ever been made to use energy systems. Accordingly, an integrated renewable energy system, including PTC, PV, and Solar still desalination (SSD) was designed to take practical action for sustainable development and cleaner production [29], which is one of the most important concerns of the design team. Our previous research showed the successful use of a renewable system to produce biodiesel [30,31], but such a configuration has been made for the first time to encapsulate the PCMs. Despite extensive studies in the field of HRES, no design, construction, and Techno-economic research on comprehensive renewable systems enhanced with TES have been reported. In this study, quintuple renewable recourses consisting of geothermal/biomass/hydro/solar/wind were applied to design/construct a sustainable technical, economical, and environmentally friendly hybrid system. The main sections consist of GSHP, MCP, PTC, SSD, TCR, HWT, Proton exchange membrane (PEM), and DFG. Also, a hydro/solar system was utilized to supply the water/heat/power needed for the NEPCM synthesis and biodiesel production in the TCR section. The hybrid system required both suitable solar radiation as well as hydrothermal resources near the seashore. For this purpose, the area selected for the system was Bandar Abbas, Iran in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, although there are numerous researches on hydrogen production through water electrolysis, To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been few studies on the wind/membrane electrolysis and none of them have been reported to reduce electricity generation costs and/or to increase the power sustainability using the quintuple wind/geothermal/biomass/solar/hydro renewable energy. Therefore, this method has not been performed anywhere in the world and it is the first time that such a hybrid system was designed and constructed."
1,Experimental,
2,Geothermal/wind/solar potential of the studied region,"2.1 Geothermal/wind/solar potential of the studied region The system was easy to deploy in Bandar Abbas, Iran in the Persian Gulf (Fig. 1 ), which has considerable potential for renewable energy sources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. It also could use seawater to breed saline microalgae in light of its proximity to the Persian Gulf."
3,HRES section,"2.2 HRES section In this paper, an integrated quintuple renewable energy system consisting of geothermal/biomass/hydro/solar/wind resources was implemented to produce power, heat, and freshwater (Fig. 2 ). As shown in Fig. 2, the seawater was allowed to pass through MCP that took controlled heat from GSHP to grow microalgae and partial salinity was consumed as nutrition of saline-based microalgae. After cultivation and separation of biomass, the used water, which had less salinity, was transferred to the SSD unit using an improved PTC to produce desalinated water. Moreover, in order to improve the performance of the PTC a Hybrid operating nanofluid (HybridNF) was assisted to achieve maximum thermal efficiency. The obtained biomass was transferred into the oil extraction section to gain the bio-oil through cell disruption. By utilizing an enhanced TCR, it was possible to convert algae oil into biodiesel fuel. As can be observed from Fig. 2, the heat of TCR was supplied by the PTC module hence the production of biodiesel is strongly affected by the time of solar hours. Thus, to extend the production and prolonging the heat loss of the TCR at late hours, a novel TES utility was applied to TCR. The introduced TES was prepared by encapsulation of n-Octadecane organic PCM in the same TCR configuration due to its similar condition of transesterification reaction. Also, due to the proper wind conditions of the region, the HWT was employed to supply the power of the PEM division to produce hydrogen from the distilled water of the SSD unit. In this way, a combination of biodiesel/hydrogen was prepared and introduced to the DFG block to produce an economical/sustainable power. Furthermore, the PV system was carried out to supply the required power of electronic modules of the system’s components. 2.2.1 GSHP equipment In this paper, the heat required for microalgae cultivation in MCP was provided from the GSHP and This was possible due to the geothermal potential of the studied region. The transient system simulation program (TRNSYS v. 18) was used to simulate/construct the GSHP system based on a previous work [34]. The specification of the geothermal system used consists of a 120 m depth of well, a 63 mm diameter of well, and a fluid heat capacity of 3.9 kJ/kg. 2.2.2 MCP system Dunaliella salina microalgae specie was provided from the Iranian Biological Resource Center. MCP system consisted of 7 1-m3 open ponds filled with the Persian Gulf water near the seashore of Bandar Abbas. The key variables in the microalgae cultivation step according to Table 1 were salinity includes, light intensity, and air injection to obtain the maximum production. 2.2.3 Improved PTC section 2.2.3.1 PTC’s physical properties This study used the PTC provided in Zahedi et al. ’s research [30] (Fig. 3 ). A 250W pump model CR71-4A (Motogen Iranian Company) with a maximum flow rate of 3 L/min was used in the PTC for circulating the working fluid. This study measured the radiation entering the PTC using a pyrometer (SR12, Hukseflux, the Netherlands). Moreover, a thermocouple was used to calculate the inlet fluid temperature to the PTC and output temperature. The reflectors of the PTC used in this research were two parabolic mirrors with a reflectance coefficient of 0.9. The absorbent tube, which is a major component of PTCs, consisted of a 2 mm inner copper tube and an outer glass tube with 2-mm thickness. 2.2.3.2 Hybrid operating nanofluid (HybridNF) preparation Shell Heat Transfer Oil of Thermia B, USA with a density of 818 kg/m3, the thermal conductivity of 0.133 W/mk, and specific heat capacity of 1954 J/kg.K at 40 °C was used as the base heat transfer fluid in the PTC. Therefore, MgO nanoparticles (with dimensions of 20–30 nm and 99% purity) and MWCNT (with dimensions of 20 nm and purity greater than 95%) manufactured by Iranian Nanomaterials Pioneers Co. were used to prepare nanofluids in the oil-based fluid as HybridNF. Due to compatibility in the oil-based operating fluid of the PTC to form HybridNF, the mentioned nanoparticles were selected. Moreover, CNT had high thermal conductivity (3000 W/m.k), and MgO nanoparticles had convenient specific heat capacity (985 J/kg.K) and suitable density (3580 kg/m3) compared to other nanoparticles, provided good thermal conductivity properties in the base fluid. In order to obtain suitable conditions of the PTC and achieve maximum thermal efficiency, the most important parameters containing MWCNT/MgO weight ratio, nanoparticle concentration in HybridNF, and HybridNF flow rate were selected with defined ranges according to Table 2 . The specific heat capacity of the nanoparticles was calculated from Eq. (1). (1) c p . np = ϕ 1 c p . np − 1 + ϕ 2 c p . np − 2 ϕ After determining the volume percentage of nanoparticles in the base fluid and determining the characteristics of the hybrid nanoparticles, the physical properties of the nanofluid were obtained in terms of the volume percentage of the nanoparticle. Also, the specific heat capacity of the HybridNF was calculated from Eq. (2). (2) c p . NF = ϕ c p . NF + ( 1 − ϕ ) c p . bf where np stands for the nanoparticle, bf represents the base fluid and ϕ refers to the volume percentage of the nanoparticle. Finally, Eq. (3) was used to determine the thermal efficiency of the PTC. (3) η PTC = m ˙ C p . NF ( T out − T in ) A aper G aper where m ˙ is the mass flow rate passing through the PTC in Kg/s, C p . NF represents the specific heat capacity of the HybridNF, A is the image area of the PTC, and G refers to the radiation intensity on the surface area. 2.2.4 SSD unit The water needed to synthesize NEPCM, to leach the three-phase TCR products (catalyst/alcohol, glycerin, and biodiesel), and to produce hydrogen from PEM was supplied by using SSD unit. The active single-slope SSD was constructed based on the capacity of the SSD in the design and construction of the whole hybrid system (Fig. 4 ). The SSD used technical specification consists of a freshwater capacity of 80 L, copper tube length of 6 m with a diameter of 25 mm. The passage of the saltwater through the desalination pipes over time caused the formation of sediment in the inner wall of the pipes, thereby declining the heat transfer between the cold and steam flows into the desalination, which strongly reduced the fresh desalination efficiency, especially at high thicknesses for sedimentation. Therefore, the MCP system was used to reduce water salinity. The HybridNF inside a storage tank was transferred into the absorbent tube using a gear pump located in the center of the parabolic mirrors. The parabolic mirrors re-irradiated and focused the irradiated beams in the central line. By passing the fluid through the adsorbent tube, the temperature of the HybridNF increased. Thus, the operating fluid was directed to the exchanger into the desalination and then the temperature of the fluid was transferred into the water using a copper tube. Hence, the increased water temperature resulted in surface evaporation. Finally, the evaporated water was allowed to collect as freshwater. With the aim of the highest water production, effective parameters such as HybridNF flow rate, depth of water, and chamber pressure were investigated. The mentioned parameters are presented in Table 3 . According to Eq. (4), the water production efficiency was defined as the ratio of the water produced to the energy received at the specified time (during the day). Thus, a comparison was made between the outputs obtained from the inputs consumed in order to determine the efficiency. Since the produced water was directly related to the amount of the evaporated saline water, the latent heat of evaporation was utilized to calculate the efficiency. (4) η S S D = m . ∗ L I ( t ) ( A c + A s t ) + q e l e where m is the amount of water produced, L is the latent heat of saline evaporation at the chamber pressure, I(t) is the amount of radiation received during the day, and Ac/Ast are the areas of the PTC and the SSD, respectively. Also, qele is the amount of electrical energy consumed by the system. 2.2.5 TES section To increase the time of bio-oil conversion into biodiesel in the TCR unit, encapsulated PCM was used as a TES utility. In this regard, PCM n-Octadecane with the phase change temperature of 20–30 °C was used as an organic core. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) as the monomer and shell consisting, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-link, alumina powder to remove inhibitor from monomer, azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the oil-soluble initiator, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the emulsifier, and polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20) as co-emulsifier were used for the polymerization synthesis. All the above materials were supplied from Merck, Germany, and were used without further purification except monomer. Moreover, the required water was supplied from the renewable SSD unit in this study. Since the polymerization process of miniemulsion requires heat and electrical power for a long time, it was decided to use renewable energies and integrate them to achieve green production with the least environmental impacts. Hence, the integrated renewable system, including the PTC, PV panel, and the SSD was designed and implemented according to Fig. 5 . This system used PTC part to supply the heat required for the system using daily solar radiation. In fact, part of the heat dissipation of HybridNF was used to provide the heat required for polymerization reaction in TCR part due to the similarity of reaction conditions in methyl methacrylate polymerization process as well as transesterification reaction of conversion of bio-oil into biodiesel. The remaining dissipated heat was transferred to the SSD unit to produce the distilled water. The reactor temperature was controlled by fuzzy logic, as the reaction of conversion of bio-oil to biodiesel did (See Section 2.2.6). Nanoencapsulated phase change materials (NEPCMs) were prepared and produced by the in-situ miniemulsion method. This reaction was performed in two oil and water phases as follows. First, emulsifier, co-emulsifier, and distilled water were gently mixed for 5 min as the water phase. Since the monomer had stabilizer, it was passed through a column containing alumina powder to be purified. The phase change material was mixed with the initiator, monomer, and crosslink and stirred for 5 min to form the oil phase. Finally, the two water and oil phases were mixed for 10 min to achieve pre-emulsion. Then, it was miniemulsified by ultrasonication (HD 3200-VS 70/T, Bandelin, Germany) at 70% intensity for 5 min. During the ultrasonication, the mixture was placed in a ice-water bath to prevent temperature elevation and unwanted polymerization reaction. The resulting mixture was transferred to the TCR part and exposed to nitrogen flow for 10 min. After that, different ratios of monomer to PCM and different ratios of emulsifier to PCM were mixed under different temperatures for 600 rpm for 7 h. Upon the completion of polymerization, nanocapsules gently cooled to ambient temperature, washed twice with distilled water, and filtered to remove the unreacted materials. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to improve, develop, and optimize the production process of NEPCM through Design Expert (DX 10) software [35] based on the most influencing parameters. (Table 4 ). Encapsulation production efficiency (EPE%) and encapsulation production cost (EPC) ($) were also selected as the response. Although most of the encapsulation studies investigated the amount of the encapsulated core or EPE as the main response in experiments, the cost which is an important factor for the future commercialization of this product in energy storage systems, has not been studied as a response in any research yet. Various tests were used to determine the properties of NEPCMs, the PMMA shell, and pure n-Octadecane. In this study, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy test (FTIR) was used with an S8400 Shimadzu Japan system for verification. SEM was used for verifying the morphology of NEPCM with a TESCAN VEGA/XMU device. In order to characterize crystalline Samples, the nondestructive technique X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Bruker (Germany)-D8 ADVANCE with a scanning range of 10–60 (2 θ ) was used. Using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermal properties were determined by 200 F3 Maia, NETZSCH, Germany. Based on the results obtained from DSC, EPE% could be calculated according to Eq. (5) [36]. (5) η N E P C M = ( Δ H m , N E P C M + Δ H c , N E P C M ) / ( Δ H m , P C M + Δ H c , P C M ) × 100 where Δ H m , N E P C M refers to the melting enthalpy of nanocapsules in kJ/kg, Δ H c , N E P C M stands for crystallization enthalpy of nanocapsules in kJ/kg, Δ H m , P C M is the melting enthalpy of pure PCM in kJ/kg, Δ H c , N E P C M represents crystallization enthalpy of the pure PCM in kJ/kg, and η N E P C M is the EPE%. Moreover, thermal stability properties were measured based on Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Thermal Gravimetry (DTG) tests (the first derivative of TGA diagram) by TGA/DSC1, METTLER TOLEDO, Switzerland with pan Alumina oxide. By comparing and analyzing the behavior of NEPCMs, the pure PCM, and the polymer shell without core, the encapsulation percentage of PCM could be calculated according to Eq. (6). (6) R ( % ) = X + F Where R is the percentage of the encapsulated PCM, X represents the percentage of the residual weight of the sample, and F refers to the reduced weight of the polymer shell without core at the temperature which n-octadecane is completely evaporated. Regarding the second response, in addition to the cost of materials, the production cost of the product should be considered. In this case, the energy required to supply TCR temperature was obtained through PTC. Moreover, the power required by the components, including the reactor, was provided by PV. Both were made from solar energy, which is free and without environmental pollutants. In addition, the water was supplied by active SSD. Hence the response cost was only measured by the cost of materials and production cost was neglected. 2.2.6 TCR part Methanol and chloroform were purchased from Zagros Petrochemical Co, Iran to produce biodiesel in the TCR. Moreover, sodium hydroxide was purchased from Parak Bandaremam Co., Iran. In addition, diesel fuel produced by the National Iranian Oil Company was used to compare the biodiesel characteristics of dunaliella with fossil diesel. In order to use the PTC heat to convert bio-oil into biodiesel, a three-walled reactor with a NEPCM-contained jacket was used, in which the heating fluid passing through the outer wall provided the heat required for the transesterification reaction (Fig. 6 ). Besides, the resistance sensor PT100 was used to monitor the temperature inside the TCR. Furthermore, a control valve was employed to control the reaction temperature of converting bio-oil into biodiesel with the help of a current passing the HybridNF of the PTC. The utilized control valve had two main body parts of the valve and actuator ML7984A4009 with <1% accuracy. Moreover, a 0.5-inch Honeywell valve was used as the receiver (output 4–20 mA) of the actuator. Notably, the temperature controller Hanyang PX9 was used to receive the reactor temperature signal and order to the control valve. Also, due to persistent errors in the proportional classical control logic and since the reaction temperature has an undeniable effect on the final product properties, according to Zahedi and Rafizadeh’s [37] research, the fuzzy control was used to calculate the design parameters in this study. The performance of the fuzzy PD controller for controlling the desired temperature inside the reactor was great with a precision of 0.2% without overshoot. Besides the error of the reactor temperature, the temperature error derivative is considered to avoid the instability that comes from a long delay time of heat transfer to the inside of the reactor. 2.2.6.1 Conversion of biomass into bio-oil The oil of microalgae biomass produced from the MCP section was extracted from the dried powder of dunaliella salina stirred with chloroform/methanol mixture (1:2) and then ultrasonicated (70 W, 50 kHz). In order to get the purified organic matter, the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 8 min and was placed at a rotary evaporator at a temperature of 50 °C [38]. 2.2.6.2 Conversion of bio-oil into biodiesel In the case of producing the fuel, a specific amount of bio-oil was first added to the homogeneous mixture of 1:6 M alcohol and a catalyst (sodium hydroxide) (1 wt% bio-oil) inside the reactor and heated to the desired temperature. Then, biodiesel was produced under reaction conditions for 1 h after supplying the required heat on the reactor wall (60 °C) by the PTC at a mixing speed of 500 rpm. After the reaction time and conversion of biomass into biodiesel, the separation operation was performed on the reactor contents. During the first 4 h, more than 90% of the impurities were deposited and separated. Since glycerin density is higher than that of biodiesel, glycerin was deposited and biodiesel was placed above the fluid surface. After the separation of the glycerin and biodiesel phase, glycerin was discharged from the bottom of the container, and the biodiesel was leached from the water produced by the SSD unit. In the biodiesel production section of bio-oil using renewable resources, the proton nuclear magnetic resonance test (BRUKER DRX500 AVANCE) with a frequency of 500/133 MHz was used to determine the conversion ratio of triglyceride to methyl ester and also to ensure the production of biodiesel. Moreover, the signal integral ratio of proton spectra of methylene and methyl ester was utilized to determine the reaction performance. Eq. (7) represents the conversion rate of triglyceride to methyl ester. (7) η T C R = ( 2 A 1 3 A 2 ) × 100 where A1 is the integral value of the methyl ester proton, and A2 is the integral value of the methylene ester proton. Since methylene carbon has two protons and carbon alcohol has three protons, coefficients 2 and 3 were also considered in this equation [39,40]. Also, this study used ASTM D7042 standard to measure density, ASTM D445 standard to measure viscosity, ASTM D24 standard to measure thermal value, ASTM D613 standard to measure cetane number, and ASTM D2622 standard to measure the amount of the sulfur of the produced fuel. Moreover, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to calculate the biodiesel efficiency. The presence of a small percentage of soap as well as some catalyst in the final amount of biodiesel declined the fuel quality and caused reverse effects on the fuel combustion. Therefore, the leaching method was used to remove impurities. According to the previous research, when it was leached three times, impurities in the biodiesel phase was removed and acceptable purification was achieved [31]. To obtain a suitable condition of the TCR and achieve maximum efficiency, the most important parameters containing reaction time, catalyst concentration, and temperature reaction were selected with a defined range according to Table 5 . The power required for the above-mentioned hybrid system, including pumps, control valve, controller, and the conversion reactor mixing system was supplied by a PV/inverter system. Solar panels and the respective equipment were purchased from Taban Company, Iran. The equipment included two panels with a total power of 640 W, two 100-amp batteries, a 40-amp controller charge, and a 1000-W inverter. It should be noted that the efficiency, maximum voltage, and maximum current of each module were 16.5%, 36.9 V, and 8.68 A, respectively."
4,Power/hydrogen section,"2.3 Power/hydrogen section According to Fig. 2, with the HWT/PEM configuration, the hybrid system was able to generate power and then hydrogen, simultaneously. In this study, an optimized technical production of hydrogen fuel was made by the design and production of the PEM. The water needed to produce hydrogen was supplied using the quintuple geothermal/biomass/hydro/solar/wind renewable system. A combination of biodiesel/hydrogen was prepared and introduced to the DFG block to produce an economical/sustainable power. 2.3.1 HWT unit The wind turbine used was an alternating current horizontal type that was used directly to supply the hydrogen compressor and direct-current PEM. Fig. 7 shows the selected HWT composed of a blade with 2 m diameters and a tower with 2.5 m height. The rotational speed of the HWT depended on the dimensions of the turbine blades. Turbine design parameters according to Table 6 were blade mass, length, and moment of inertia. 2.3.2 PEM preparation In order to produce pure hydrogen, membrane electrolysis was designed and made. Accordingly, the membrane electrode assembly manufactured by Nafion, USA, and Sulfuric acid manufactured by Tadbir Chemi Hayyan Company, Iran were prepared. Water was also supplied from the SSD unit. The PEM system used with three numbers of cells and Black platinum/polyaniline nanofiber as Anode/Cathode catalyst is depicted in Fig. 8 . Moreover, the production rate of the hydrogen generator unit was examined in order to obtain the optimal state of hydrogen production in terms of the amount of acid electrolyte (sulfuric acid) at different concentrations. The amount of hydrogen was measured with three variables of electrolyte concentration, electrolyte temperature, and the applied voltage and then the amount of output hydrogen was measured. Table 7 presents the test data for PEM. 2.3.3 DFG characteristics In this study, the used diesel engine generator was a horizontal single-cylinder Lister with a nominal power of 3 kW and a maximum power of 8 hp at 850 rpm. In the power generation section of the biodiesel/diesel/hydrogen composition, the parameters of biodiesel percentage in the final fuel, variable speed, and load value impacts on pollutants emissions were investigated (Table 8 ). In these experiments, the amount of hydrogen combined with air was considered to be 0.34% by volume."
5,Results and discussion,
6,MCP system,"3.1 MCP system Salinity, light intensity, and air injection were the three influencing factors examined in this work on the microalgae cultivation rate. A 7-day culture period was considered. Fig. 9 a shows the changes in biomass production efficiency by salinity levels. Based on the data, cultivation with a salinity of 3 g/L had the highest biomass production of 0.65 g/L. Then, with this salinity, the effect of light intensity on the culture medium was evaluated. Fig. 9b shows the biomass production efficiency by changing light intensity. According to Fig. 9b, cultivation with a light intensity of 300 lx had the highest biomass production of 0.70 g/L. Eventually, with the light intensity of 300 lx and the salinity of 3 g/L, the effect of air injection on the culture medium was evaluated. Fig. 9c shows the changes in biomass produced by varying air injection. The results stated that the highest biomass production was 0.81 g/L with the light intensity of 300 lx, the salinity of 3 g/L, and the air injection of 0.4 L/min. Under these conditions, the salinity-reduced water from the MCP was introduced to the SSD unit."
7,PTC section,"3.2 PTC section 3.2.1 Hybrid operating nanofluid (HybridNF) MWCNT/MgO weight ratio, Nanoparticle concentration in the PTC’s HybridNF, and HybridNF’s flow rate were the three influencing factors examined for the thermal efficiency of the PTC section. Fig. 10 a shows the changes in thermal efficiency by varying MWCNT/MgO weight ratio. According to the data, the PTC with an MWCNT/MgO weight ratio of 50% g/g had the highest thermal efficiency of 58.2%. Then, with this value, the effect of nanoparticles in the base fluid was evaluated. Fig. 10b shows the thermal efficiency vs nanoparticle concentration in the PTC’s HybridNF. The PTC with a nanoparticle concentration of 0.5% g had the highest thermal efficiency of 61.8%. Eventually, with this concertation and an MWCNT/MgO weight ratio of 50%, the effect of the HybridNF’s flow rate on the PTC was evaluated. Fig. 10c shows the changes in thermal efficiency by the HybridNF’s flow rate. According to this graph, the highest thermal efficiency was 61.8% with a HybridNF’s flow rate of 2 L/min, a nanoparticle concentration of 0.5% based on the PTC’s HybridNF, and an MWCNT/MgO weight ratio of 50%. Under these conditions, the active SSD was run."
8,SSD unit,"3.3 SSD unit After the evaluation of the suitable conditions for the injection of salinity-reduced water from the MCP system and the injection of the most heat transferred from the PTC section, in order to obtain the best water production efficiency, the most effective parameters containing the depth of saline water in the SSD, pressure and HybridNF’s flow rate were investigated. First, the effect of the depth of water in water production at keeping other variables constant was tested (Fig. 11 a). The results indicated that the SSD with a depth of water of 4 cm had the highest water production of 19 L/Day. Then, with this depth of water, the effect of the flow rate on the SSD was evaluated. Fig. 11b shows the changes in water production by varying the flow rate. Based on the data, the SSD with a flow rate of 2 L/min had the highest water production of 19.7 L/Day. Eventually, with a flow rate of 2 L/min and the depth of water of 4 cm, the effect of pressure on the SSD was studied. Fig. 11c shows the data on water production efficiency by changing the pressure. In these conditions, the highest water production was 23.1 L/Day with a pressure of 0.4 bar, a flow rate of 2 L/min, and a depth of water of 4 cm. The produced water was used in the three sections including the TCR leaching, the NEPCM synthesis, and the PEM’s hydrogen generation."
9,TES system,"3.4 TES system According to the CCD-based experimental design table of the surface response methodology developed for nanoencapsulation, 17 experiments with three replications were performed (Table 9 ). Besides, Descriptive statistics for the obtained responses are presented in Table 10 . The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to select the best model, hence the quadratic (p-value = 0.0008 and R-Squared = 0.966) and linear (p value < 0.0001 and R-Squared = 0.998) models were selected for EPE and EPC responses, respectively. According to the results, the p-value for the model was much less than 0.05, indicating that the assumed model describes the experimental data well. After the model was developed with the best fit for the intended responses polynomial equations including effective design variables and their interaction for each response were originated (Table 11 ). Fig. 12 presents three-dimensional graphs of the surface response to investigate interactions between the design parameters and their effects on the responses. Fig. 12a shows the interaction between Monomer/PCM and Emulsifier/PCM, where EPE% rose with an increase in the monomer/PCM as the emulsifier/PCM value remained constant. However, as the monomer/PCM value remained constant, EPE% did not show significant changes with increasing emulsifier/PCM. According to Fig. 12b, as the monomer/PCM value remained constant, temperature increment initially raised EPE% and then decreased it. While keeping the temperature parameter constant, EPE% experienced an ascending trend as the monomer/PCM increased and reached its maximum value. Fig. 12c shows that by keeping the temperature constant, an increase in the emulsifier/PCM did not have a significant effect on the EPE%, while an increase in the temperature had a positive effect on the increased EPE% when the emulsifier/PCM was constant. Fig. 12d indicates the interaction of the two parameters of Monomer/PCM and emulsifier/PCM on EPC, in which the EPC was strongly affected by the increase of the Monomer/PCM by keeping the emulsifier/PCM constant. It could be interpreted that by considering an average of other parameters, increasing the weight ratio of the Monomer (shell) to the PCM (core) enhances the efficiency while increasing the weight ratio of emulsifier to the PCM, changes are initially small and then decreases efficiency. Moreover, an increase in temperature initially raises efficiency which could be caused by the decomposition intensification of the AIBN initiator at the temperature above 60 °C, and after reaching the maximum point, the efficiency decreases at higher temperatures. Regarding EPC response, the highest cost sensitivity was observed in the parameter monomer (shell) to the PCM weight ratio and It was found that increasing the temperature did not affect the cost due to the use of PTC heat. To achieve the highest EPE% and the lowest production EPC, optimization was done based on the RSM. According to the results, values of the design parameters for optimal conditions equaled to 2.41 for the monomer to the PCM (wt/wt), 3.15% for the emulsifier to the PCM (wt/wt%), and 84.6 °C for temperature, where 68% EPE with an EPC of $0.09 was achieved with 70% desirability. In order to evaluate and confirm this situation, a verification experiment was performed according to the optimal values obtained. To examine the chemical properties of nanoencapsulated PCM (NEPCM), pure PCM (n-Octadecane), and polymer shell (PMMA) the FTIR spectroscopy was used (Fig. 13 ). In the spectroscopy of the PCM of the absorption band in 2854 cm−1 and 2950 cm−1, two strong peaks related to C − H tensile vibration of methylene − CH2 − and methyl CH3 − groups. A relatively strong absorbed peak at 1465 cm−1 indicated methylene bridges and an average peak absorbed at 715 cm-1 reflected the in-plane rocking of the methylene group. The results of the polymer shell spectroscopy showed a weak peak of 2950 cm−1, which was related to aliphatic asymmetric and symmetric stretches of C − H of the methyl group. Moreover, a relatively strong peak of 1731 cm−1 was related to CO tensile vibration and a weak peak of 1149 cm−1 was associated with C − O vibration in the ester group − COOCH3, and the weak peak absorbed at 1450 cm−1 was related to asymmetric and symmetric bend vibration of C–H. Examining the spectroscopic results of the NEPCM showed the existence of the polymer-related peaks in the encapsulated material, indicating a similar polymerization. Moreover, the peaks of the PCM (core) were repeated in NEPCM, and no chemical reaction occurred between core and polymer shell, that reflected successful encapsulation of n-Octadecane core by the polymer shell. The Comparison of the results from FTIR for the obtained nanocapsules with previous research showed good consistency between them [25]. Fig. 14 shows the XRD pattern for PCM n-Octadecane, PMMA polymer shell, and NEPCM. Fig. 14a represents diffraction peak for n-Octadecane at (11.6°), (15.4°), (19.2°), (19.7°), (23.2°), (24.8°), (35°), (39.6°), and (44.4°) that are reflections from (003), (004), (010), (011), (105), (111), (−110), (0–22), and (207) from the anorthic crystalline phase planes. As seen in Fig. 14b, the XRD pattern for the polymer shell is in an amorphous region. While having an amorphous behavior similar to the polymer shell, NEPCM also exhibits all the main diffraction peaks of n-Octadecane material, which proves the existence of a solid core inside the polymer shell. The results of XRD are in good agreement with those reported in previous studies [36]. To investigate the morphology and physical properties of nanocapsules, SEM was used for the dried samples of polymer shell and NEPCM under optimal conditions. Fig. 15 shows that the polymer shell particles are almost spherical and have a relatively smooth surface. The image obtained from the optimal nanoencapsulated sample represents the presence of spherical particles with a smooth surface and the absence of fractures or hemispherical particles reflected a successful encapsulation by mini-emulsion. The average size of the nanoencapsulated particles with an appropriate distribution is on average 500 nm. Moreover, DSC was used to determine the thermal properties of n-Octadecane PCM and NEPCM (Fig. 16 ). According to the results obtained from Fig. 16a, n-Octadecane with a crystallization temperature of 18.5 °C and a melting temperature of 34.1 °C, which is in the range of comfort temperatures, with latent thermal crystallization value of 239.8 kJ/kg, and melting value of 246 kJ/kg have high potential to be used in thermal storage systems. According to Fig. 16b, NEPCM with a crystallization temperature of 22.5 °C and a melting temperature of 29.6 °C has a latent crystallization thermal value of 161.8 kJ/kg and a melting temperature of 164.4 kJ/kg. According to the results, EPE% is equal to 67.1% according to Eq. (5). The EPE% calculated for the optimal sample by the model compared to the practical results showed an error of less than 7%, which indicates a very good consistency of the model with the practical results obtained. Thermal properties obtained from optimal synthesized nanocapsules and pure PCM reflect an improvement in the supercooling temperature during the encapsulation process so that this amount reduced from 15.9 °C for pure material to 7.1 °C, which can be due to an increase in the specific surface of nanoparticle compared to the bulk condition (Table 12 ). Fig. 17 shows the thermal stability results of NEPCM, n-Octadecane, and PMMA Shell. According to TGA results (Fig. 17a), the PCM exhibited a lower thermal resistance than the polymer shell and was destroyed up to 212 °C, while the polymer shell showed only 6% weight loss at the same temperature. At this temperature, the NEPCM showed a 38% reduction in weight, indicating evaporation of the non-encapsulated PCM and a small portion of the polymer shell. Such an obvious temperature difference in thermal resistance between the polymer shell and paraffin core reflects the importance of using polymeric materials to increase thermal stability and protect the paraffin core. Eq. (6) was used to calculate the percentage of encapsulated PCM (R), in which X and F values were 58.3 and 6, respectively, and R equaled to 64.3% indicating that more than half of the used PCM were encapsulated. The DTG diagram shown in Fig. 17b depicts the peak and range of weight changes of NEPCM, n-Octadecane, and PMMA Shell in comparison to temperature, in which n-Octadecane has a sharp peak in the temperature range of 100–212 °C, reflecting the extreme temperature sensitivity for this material. Besides, a relatively large peak at a temperature range of 300–420 °C for the polymer shell indicates a decrease in the thermal resistance of the material in this range. Also, it is observed that NEPCM has two peaks in the two mentioned ranges, reflecting the presence of its n-Octadecane core inside the polymer capsule. Table 13 presents the weight changes obtained for the PCM n-Octadecane, polymer shell, and NEPCM according to the TGA/DTG diagrams. According to Sections 2.2.5 and 2.2.6, biodiesel was produced with the help of nanofluid and optimal NEPCM. On the other hand, since biodiesel production requires a temperature of 60 °C, and considering the results of the hybrid operating nanofluid (HybridNF) preparation section, in case of the use of a nanofluid in the solar collector and NEPCM in the TCR, the hybrid system could supply a temperature 60 °C for a longer time, thus the amount of biodiesel production increased. For instance, Fig. 18 represents the temperature exited from optimal nanofluid at different hours. As can be seen, the parts of the day when the hybrid system was able to produce biodiesel were marked with hachure while the employed TES could extend the biodiesel production. Table 14 presents biodiesel production increase, heat value, as well as conversion efficiency of biomass to biodiesel under different conditions according to the percentage of different volumes of NEPCM relative to the condition where it was not used. According to Table 14, the best condition is when 0.35% of the NEPCM volume is used, in which the amount of biodiesel production increased by 34.9%."
10,TCR part,"3.5 TCR part After producing the optimal NEPCM and using the appropriate amount of it in the TCR system, as well as using the optimal HybridNF system, the efficiency of biofuel-to-biodiesel conversion was evaluated based on the effective parameters of time, catalyst concentration, and temperature according to Fig. 19 . As can been seen in Fig. 19a, the effect of temperature on efficiency was initially examined by keeping the other independent parameters constant, in which it was found that the highest efficiency of 72% was obtained at 55 °C. Fig. 19b presents changes in the efficiency with a catalyst concentration of 55%. Results demonstrated that as catalyst increased, efficiency also increased so that at a concentration of 1.75 (wt/wt%), 78.7% efficiency was observed. Based on the optimal values obtained from the temperature and catalyst concentration, the effect of time on efficiency was investigated (Fig. 19c). As seen, by increasing time, efficiency increased and then decreased so that the highest efficiency was 78.7% after 50 min. Hence, according to the obtained information, the optimal condition of biodiesel production in the TCR section was obtained at a temperature of 55 °C and 1.75 concentration (wt/wt%) with 78.7% efficiency in 50 min. Table 17 shows methyl ester biodiesel fatty acid compounds of Dunaliella derived from transesterification using CG-MS analysis. As seen, in the biodiesel obtained from Dunaliella, the total amount of saturated fatty acid compounds (capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, benic acid, and lignosic acid), as well as monounsaturated content (oleic acid and erucic acid), was higher. The higher the amount of saturated fatty acids in a compound, the greater the cetane number of the fuel, followed by higher ignition properties and combustion quality. Since the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid and linolenic acid) of the methyl ester Dunaliella was low, it reduced the properties of the Dunaliella biodiesel cold flow. Fig. 20 represents the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of Dunaliella biodiesel from transesterification. As shown in Table 15 , using Eq. (7) and considering the integral value of methyl ester proton in Fig. 20 and also the amount of methylene proton for Dunaliella biomass (5.755), the conversion percent of biomass to biodiesel in the transesterification for Dunaliella biomass was obtained in optimal nanofluid of 77.5%. Table 16 shows the properties of Dunaliella biodiesel obtained by transesterification in the optimal nanofluid. Due to the lower levels of unsaturated fatty acids in Dunaliella methyl ester, Dunaliella biodiesel had good oxidation stability."
11,HWT unit,"3.6 HWT unit Table 17 shows the rotation speed of the HWT in different dimensions for use in the desired hybrid system comprised of HWT, PEM Fuel Cell, AES, Hydrogen Storage Tank/oxygen storage tank, and current inverter DC to AC [41]. As can be seen in Table 17 , the required minimum rotational speed was 23.57 ω/s or 225 rpm, corresponding to a turbine with 0.6 m diameter and 0.5 kg/m mass."
12,PEM investigation,"3.7 PEM investigation To achieve the maximum volume flow rate of hydrogen, an experimental design was implemented with 15 runs according to the effective parameters of electrolyte concentration (sulfuric acid solution), electrolyte temperature, and applied voltage (Fig. 21 ). As reported in Fig. 21a, the highest volumetric flow rate of hydrogen produced at 6 V by at a constant value of electrolyte Conc. and temperature. Fig. 21b shows linear changes of volumetric flow rate by increasing the molarity in which the highest production was obtained at 1,5 M at a constant value of 6V and temperature of 35 °C. As it is shown in Fig. 21c the highest production was achieved at the temperature of 45 °C by keeping the other variables constant at an applied voltage of 6V and molarity of 1M. Therefore, the optimal working condition of PEM was attained at the applied voltage of 6V, electrolyte temperature of 45 °C, and electrolyte Conc. of 1.5 in which the maximum produced hydrogen of 95.5 ml/min was observed."
13,Hybrid renewable power generation system,"3.8 Hybrid renewable power generation system To achieve the most optimal operating conditions of the diesel generator, three fuels of pure diesel, a combination of 10% biodiesel (B10) and 20% (B20) were used at different speeds and loads at room temperature. Fig. 22 demonstrates the effect of adding biodiesel to pure diesel on NOX and CO at constant speed and load. As seen in Fig. 22a, the amount of CO production rose with an increase in the percentage of biodiesel as the maximum amount equaled to 11% of the combined biodiesel, and then it decreased. Unlike the trend of CO production, the lowest NOX emission rate was obtained in the combined fuel of 10% biodiesel (Fig. 22b). Therefore, the combined fuel of 10% biodiesel (B10) was selected due to the significantly lower emission of NOx than other fuel combinations. By selecting the B10 fuel, the effect of engine rotation speed on emissions at a constant load was investigated (Fig. 23 ). According to Fig. 23a, CO production initially dropped with an increase in the engine speed and then increased at 1050 RPM. Fig. 23b shows an increase in NOX production as the engine speed escalated. According to the results, although the lowest amount of CO production was observed in the range of 900–1050 RPM, with a rise from 900 to 1050, the amount of NOx production increased by 14%; hence, 900 RPM was selected as the optimal speed. By selecting 900 RPM for the B10 fuel, the effect of an increase in the load on the pollutants produced was investigated in Fig. 24 . It can be seen from Fig. 24a that as the load increased, CO emission raised as in a range of 25–53 N the slope of the increase was steady and then became steep. Fig. 24b also shows that produced NOx experienced a uniform upward trend with increasing the engine load. Since selecting the optimal load has a direct effect on the power generation of DFG, Fig. 25 presents the effect of the load on the engine power generation for B10 fuel and 900 RPM speed. As seen, the output generation power surged linearly with an increase in the load. According to the results, raising the load from 45 N to 53 N increased CO production by 11% and NOx production by 19%, while this increase in load elevated the output generation power of the engine by 23%. Hence, the optimal operating conditions of DFG concerning the environmental pollutants were the use of a combination of 10% biodiesel fuel with diesel at 900 RPM and 53 N load with a generation power of 2.48 kW."
14,Economic evaluation,"3.9 Economic evaluation In order to evaluate the economic viability of the proposed quintuple system, the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) analysis was used for an investment period of 4 years Table 18 . According to the outcomes, the calculated internal rate of return was equaled to 32%, which was higher than the reported interest rate reflecting the desirable investment outlook of the system. Besides, the reported BCR, which is an indicator of the future profitability of the investment project [42], was equaled to 1.13 providing a payback period of 4 years."
15,Conclusions,"This paper aims to build an integrated renewable energy system by introducing a novel HRES consisting of solar/wind/geothermal/biofuel energy to produce power and fresh water in Bandar Abas. To achieve the highest performance and efficiency of the proposed system, each part of the system was optimized based on the most influencing parameters using experimental design techniques along with residual analysis. First, by designing an integrated supply chain from providing the heat of GSHP and seawater for MCP to producing biodiesel from algae oil, the biofuel production system was achievable. The optimal performance conditions of MCP biomass production were evaluated based on the light intensity, salinity, and air injection parameters, in which the maximum biomass produced of 0.81 g/l was obtained under 300 lx light intensity and 3 g/l salinity and 0.4 l/min air injection. Low-salt water exited from MCP was used in SSD and the best-operating conditions were tested according to the parameters of chamber pressure, flow rate, and depth. Under the optimal conditions, 0.4 bar, 2 l/min flow rate with 4 cm depth of 23.1 l/min fresh water was produced so that the desalinated water would be transferred to the TCR’s post-processing for leaching and the PEM division for hydrogen production. Also, to improve the PTC system, an optimal HybridNF system was used, so that the highest thermal efficiency equaled 61.8% with a flow rate of 2 l/min, a concentration of nanoparticles of 0.5%, and an MWCNT/MgO weight ratio of 50%. By following a thermal energy storage approach, n-Octadecane was encapsulated by PMMA polymer shell based on three design parameters of Monomer/PCM, Emulsifier/PCM, and temperature in a reactor powered by renewable systems so that the most optimal values of 2.41, 3.15% and 84.6 °C respectably resulted in NEPCM with an EPE of 67.1% and an EPC of $ 0.09 providing a desirable latent heat of 163.1 kJ/kg besides, the percentage of encapsulated PCM was introduced and calculated for the first time using TGA results as it determined that more than half of the used PCM were encapsulated successfully. The optimal NEPCM was used with a volume fraction of 35% in TCR as a TES and it was observed that it could lead to a 34.9% increase in biodiesel production. To achieve the best conditions for biodiesel production in TCR, the effect of temperature, catalyst concentration, and time were examined and the highest efficiency of 78.7% with a temperature of 55 °C and catalyst concentration of 1.75% was obtained in 50 min. In this research, hydrogen production was possible with help of HWT/PEM configuration, as the produced power of HWT could provide the required electrical energy of PEM. With the regression evaluation of experimental results, the optimal operating conditions were achieved by PEM with a concentration of 1.5 M, a voltage of 6 V, and the electrolyte temperature of 45 °C with a maximum production of 95.5 ml/min. Finally, to generate power in the DFG section, a combined fuel of biodiesel with pure diesel and hydrogen/air was used and its emissions of air pollutants were examined under different loads and speed rotations. The results showed that by 10% biodiesel combination with 900 RPM and 53 N load, a generation power of 2.48 kW was achieved. In the above-mentioned condition, although CO was produced more, the emitted NOx was reduced. In company with technical results, the economic evaluation of the project showed a promising BCR of 1.13 along with a payback period of 4 years suggesting a cost-effective prospect of the introduced system. In conclusion, the proposed HRES in this study has a high potential to supply power and fresh water while exhibiting an eco-friendly feature, which can meet the energy demands of Bandar Abbas in larger dimensions."
