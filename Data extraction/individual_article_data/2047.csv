0,Introduction,"The excessive dependence on fossil fuels in the last few decades has caused severe problems to human beings due to a continual rising of their cost as well as their impacts on global warming and environmental pollution [1]. Hydrogen is a clean fuel with high energy content (122 kJ/g), recognized as a potential energy substitute for fossil fuels. Although hydrogen is traditionally produced by electro- or thermo-chemical process, biohydrogen has gained attention due to its potential as a sustainable alternative to conventional methods [2]. Photo-hydrogen production process can combine treatment of organic wastewater, utilization of solar energy and production of clean energy source, so it is considered the most environment-friendly hydrogen production method [3–5]. Now, a breakthrough in technology to produce hydrogen efficiently will be the key landmark to decide if and when hydrogen will be used as one of the most important renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels. Before moving onto successful full-scale application of photo-hydrogen production systems, however, it is necessary to determine and evaluate the distinct effects of as many parameters as possible. In previous studies, several parameters such as light intensity [6], initial pH [7] and hydrogen partial pressure [8] have been optimized with respect to photo-fermentation. However, no systematic studies were reported on the role of vitamin in photo-hydrogen production. A vitamin is an organic compound required as a nutrient in tiny amounts by an organism, which can not be synthesized in sufficient quantities through its own cells, and must be obtained from the extracellular environment. Nicotinic acid could be converted to NAD+ and NADP in vivo, which are electron carrier and play an important role in electron transfer during the metabolic process. Vitamin B1 is a precursor to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. Biotin is a coenzyme for carbon dioxide transfer, and plays a role in the citric acid cycle, by which biochemical energy is generated. So, vitamins play a prominent role in metabolic process of living cells. Effects of vitamin or their related coenzyme on growth and metabolism of Escherichia coli [9] and Cyathus bulleri [10] were well studied. But the studies of the effects of vitamin or coenzyme on phototrophic hydrogen production using Rhodobacter sphaeroides ZX-5 are still rare. In this study, the effects of different combinations of vitamins (nicotinic acid, vitamin B1 and biotin) on the growth and H2 production of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 culture were investigated. When nicotinic acid was absolutely removed from medium, photo-hydrogen production can not occur."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and medium for photo-fermentation,"2.1 Microorganism and medium for photo-fermentation R.sphaeroides ZX-5 was used as the inoculum for photo-fermentation in this study. Growth medium contained (per liter): dl-malic acid 4 g, NH4Cl 1 g, phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.0) 7.5 ml, MgSO4·7H2O 0.2 g, CaCl2·2H2O 0.075 g, FeSO4·7H2O 0.0118 g, EDTA 0.04 g, trace element solution (g/l, MnSO4·4H2O 2.1, H3BO3 2.8, Cu(NO3)2·7H2O 0.04, ZnSO4·7H2O 0.24, Na2MoO4·2H2O 0.75) 1 ml, vitamin solution (g/l, nicotinic acid 10, vitamin B1 5, biotin 0.1) 1 ml. The composition of hydrogen production medium is the same as growth medium, except that NH4Cl (1 g/l) was replaced by l-glutamic acid (1 g/l). Starter cultures were inoculated with 1 ml aliquot of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 cells stored in 20% glycerol solution at −80 °C into 250 ml shake flask containing 100 ml growth medium, then pre-cultured aerobically in a shaker with 200 rpm at 30 ± 1 °C for approximately 22 h."
3,Hydrogen production by batch photo-fermentation,2.2 Hydrogen production by batch photo-fermentation Batch tests on the cell growth and photo-hydrogen production of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 were performed in 38-ml anaerobic tubes containing 34 ml sterilized hydrogen production medium and 1 ml pre-cultured bacterial cells. Anaerobic tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers and kept at 30 ± 1 °C; 60-ml syringes were used to collect and measure gas production. A uniform light intensity of 4000–5000 lux was attained at the surface of photobioreactors. The initial pH in the photobioreactors was 7.0 ± 0.1.
4,The combination of vitamins in growth medium and hydrogen production medium of R. sphaeroides ZX-5,"2.3 The combination of vitamins in growth medium and hydrogen production medium of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 In order to test the effect of vitamins on the cell growth and hydrogen production, H2 production medium containing different vitamins were used. All combinations of these three vitamins in H2 production medium are listed in Table 1 . Attentively, growth medium of Run 1–7 and the control contain all the three vitamins, however, growth medium of Run 8–15 do not contain any kind of vitamins. The batch culture with three vitamins in both growth medium and H2 production medium was served as a control."
5,NAD+/NADH assay,"2.4 NAD+/NADH assay The NAD+ and NADH were extracted by a modification of the protocol described by Wimpenny and Firth [11]. Duplicate 70 ml samples were placed in two cenrtifuge tubes (one for NAD+ and the other for NADH determination) and centrifuged with 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. After removal of the supernatants, 300 μl of 0.4 M HCl (for NAD+ extraction) or 0.4 M KOH (for NADH extraction) was added to the pellets to resuspend them. The samples were placed in a 50 °C water bath for 10 min and then on ice to cool them to 0 °C. The extracts were neutralized by adding 300 μl of 0.2 M KOH (for NAD+ extraction) or 0.2 M HCl (for NADH extraction) dropwise while vortexing. The cellular debris was removed by centrifuging with 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and stored at −20 °C until needed. Assays of the intracellular concentrations of NAD+ and NADH were performed in triplicate by the recycling assay [12]. The reaction mixture contained the following: 2 ml of 0.1 M Bicine buffer (pH 7.8); 200 μl of 12 mM PES (phenazine ethosulfate); 50 μl of 12 mM MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide); 75 μl of absolute ethanol; 50 μl of extract, which was preincubated at 25 °C for 3 min in a 3-ml cuvette. Forty microliters of yeast ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase, 100 U/ml) in 0.1 M Bicine buffer (pH 7.8) was added to the reaction mixture to begin the assay. The assay monitored the reduction of MTT at 570 nm in a UNICO UV-2102 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (UNICO, Shanghai, China). The increase in A 570 was recorded for 10 min at 25 °C. The rate of MTT reduction is proportional to the concentration of coenzyme (NAD+/NADH). The assay was calibrated with 0.005–0.02 mM standard solutions of NAD+ and NADH."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Cell concentration of the culture was determined regularly by measuring the optical density at a wavelength of 660 nm (i.e., OD660) using a spectrophotometer (Spectrumlab 22pc, Shanghai, China). Cell dry weight (g/l) was determined by centrifugation of 10 ml cell suspension, washing the pellet twice by deionized water to remove residual salts and drying in a vacuum oven at 105 °C until the weight invariant. The OD660 values were converted to dry cell weight (DCW) concentration via proper calibration as 1.0 OD660 approximately equals 0.28 g dry cell/l. As the light source, tungsten lamps of 60 W were used in the experiment. The light intensity was measured with a digital luxmeter (ZDS-10, Shanghai, China). The composition of gas produced (mainly H2 and CO2) was analyzed with a Core Mass Spectrometer (Extrel CMS Max 300-LG, USA), calibrated with standard gas (including 10.1% CO2, 4.94% Ar and 84.96% H2)."
7,Data analysis,"2.6 Data analysis The yield of gas produced in each batch fermentations was corrected under normal conditions (30 °C, 0.1 MPa). The cumulative hydrogen production was calculated according to the biogas yield and hydrogen composition in collected gas. Substrate conversion efficiency for malate is determined as the ratio of the actual amount of hydrogen evolved to the amount expected through stoichiometric equation of the substrate."

9,Effect of vitamins on phototrophic hydrogen production of R. sphaeroides ZX-5,"3.1 Effect of vitamins on phototrophic hydrogen production of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 In this study, all the starter cultures of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 were firstly incubated with growth medium containing three vitamins at 30 ± 1 °C for approximately 22 h (OD660 2.77, pH 8.55), and then eight batch tests on cell growth and photo-hydrogen production were performed in parallel with H2 production medium containing different vitamins (Table 1). The batch culture with three vitamins in H2 production medium was served as a control. As shown in Table 2 , the amounts of total H2 evolved in Run 1, 5, 6, 7 were significantly lower than that evolved in the control. The average H2 evolution rate and the substrate conversion efficiency in Run 1, 5, 6, 7 also markedly decreased compared to the control, from 55.08 ml H2/l h to 28.64–33.93 ml H2/l h and from 95.62% to 35.39–45.43%, respectively. On the contrary, the total evolved hydrogen, substrate conversion efficiency, maximum hydrogen production rate and average hydrogen production rate in Run 2, 3, 4 were almost same as those in the control (Table 2). Besides, the fermentation periods of photo-hydrogen production in Run 2, 3, 4 and control were notably longer than those in Run 1, 5, 6, 7. The presented results illustrated that phototrophic H2 production in Run 2, 3, 4 and control reached higher yield and lasted for a longer period than those in Run 1, 5, 6, 7. All of H2 production medium in Run 2, 3, 4 and control contain nicotinic acid, however, all of H2 production medium in Run 1, 5, 6, 7 do not contain nicotinic acid (Table 1). Therefore, it can be deduced that nicotinic acid plays a crucial role in effectively enhancing the phototrophic hydrogen synthesis during photo-fermentation process, rather than vitamin B1 or biotin. Additionally, as summarized in Table 2, in contrast with the control, the lag time of hydrogen production in all other batch cultures slightly extended to 9–11 h. Moreover, H2 content in biogas, final pH and OD660 value in all of batch cultures maintained within a small range regardless of the combinations of vitamins in medium. As specified in Methods section, batch tests were inoculated with 1 ml pre-cultured bacteria cells into 34 ml sterilized hydrogen production medium. However, the inoculated cells might bring traces of vitamins from growth medium, and they would affect the experiment result of vitamins on the cell growth and hydrogen production. In order to eliminate the influence of trace amounts of vitamins from growth medium on photo-hydrogen production, the starter cultures were firstly incubated with growth medium containing no vitamins at 30 ± 1 °C for approximately 22 h, and all other conditions remained same as above-mentioned experiment. The OD660 after incubated 22 h with growth medium containing no vitamins was 1.43, obviously lower than that with three vitamins (OD660 2.77), which indicates vitamins are in favor of cell growth. The growth data from these experiments with pre-cultured bacteria grown in medium without vitamins further showed that the lack of any one of three vitamins would markedly reduced the cell proliferation (Run 8–10), and when compared with Run 12–13, Run 11 displayed that nicotinic acid played the most important role in the growth of strain ZX-5 among three vitamins (Table 3 ). There were no hydrogen produced in the absence of nicotinic acid (Run 8, Run 12–14), which consisted with the conclusion drawn from the previous experiments. It was surprised that when both of biotin and vitamin B1 were absent, there was also no hydrogen production though nicotinic acid was present (Run 11). Nevertheless, the results were compared between Run 15 and the control, and there was no significant difference, except that the lag time of hydrogen production in Run 15 longer than that in the control. We speculated that the hydrogen production medium of Run 15 contained all of the three vitamins, so R. sphaeroides ZX-5 cells could continue to grow using the necessary nutrients under anaerobic and illumination condition, thus resulted no significant difference for the cell growth and hydrogen yield between Run 15 and the control (Tables 2 and 3). Additionally, the time required for further strain ZX-5 cells growth made the lag time of Run 15 longer. Thus, when the three vitamins completely exist in hydrogen production medium, the negative effects on cell growth and photo-hydrogen production of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 would be overcome, even though the growth medium contains no vitamins. As for Run 8–14, not only did the growth medium contained none of vitamins, but the hydrogen production medium lacked at least one of three vitamins as well, therefore, the cell concentration and hydrogen yield were quite low or were zero in Run 8–14. The results in Table 2 and Table 3 illustrated that nicotinic acid plays a crucial role both in effectively enhancing the phototrophic hydrogen synthesis and cell growth. Moreover, though no reasons indicate that vitamin B1 and biotin would have direct impact on photo-H2 production, the presence of vitamin B1 or biotin was needed for photo-hydrogen production."
10,The mechanism of the significant effect of nicotinic acid on phototrophic hydrogen production of strain ZX-5,"3.2 The mechanism of the significant effect of nicotinic acid on phototrophic hydrogen production of strain ZX-5 The carbon substrate (malic acid) is fed into the TCA cycle of the photosynthetic purple non-sulfur (PNS) bacteria where it is oxidized to produce CO2 and electrons. Working in parallel is the photosynthetic membrane apparatus, which converts light energy into ATP, and then the ATP is channeled into the nitrogenase along with the protons and electrons. Protons are supplied in part by the TCA cycle as above-mentioned, and the remaining is supplied by the action of ATP-synthase acting as a part of the photosynthetic apparatus. Finally, the nitrogenase reduces the protons to molecular hydrogen [13]: (1) 2 H + + 2 e − + 4 ATP → H 2 + 4 ADP + 4 Pi The transfer of electrons from the TCA cycle to the nitrogenase is accomplished by consecutive oxidation/reduction of electron carriers. These carriers are namely nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ferredoxin (Fd). The hypothesized electron path is shown below [14]: (2) Substrate → TCA - cycle → NAD + / NADH → ( Fd ) OX / ( Fd ) red → Nitrogenase Thus, it is easy to understand why nicotinic acid plays an important role in electron transfer during phototrophic hydrogen production of strain ZX-5, which is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD); and the electron transfer process is indispensable for photo-fermentation process. Based on the mentioned experiment results and analysis, the content of electron carriers (NADH + NAD+) of the control and Run 1 during photo-fermentation was determined. As shown in Fig. 1 , the electron carriers (NADH + NAD+) content of the control fell in the range between 3.07 × 10−4 mmol/g dry cell and 4.81 × 10−4 mmol/g dry cell during photo-hydrogen production of strain ZX-5, which was markedly higher than that of Run 1. Owing to lack of nicotinic acid in hydrogen production medium, the key electron carriers (NADH + NAD+) synthesis in vivo was missing (Fig. 1), and then the electron transfer of photo-fermentation process was blocked, resulting in the significant reduction of total H2 evolved, hydrogen evolution rate and substrate conversion efficiency in Run 1. It is concluded that the nicotinic acid, as a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), is essential for the electron transfer during an anaerobic, photo-fermentation process. As for vitamin B1 and biotin, their influences on the growth and hydrogen production of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 were never reported in the literature. However, vitamin B1 is a precursor to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a coenzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex for the catabolism of carbohydrate, organic acids and amino acids. Pyruvate is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and produces acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle, which is in favor of rapid cell growth. Biotin is a coenzyme for carbon dioxide transfer, and also plays a role in the citric acid cycle, by which biochemical energy is generated. Therefore, vitamin B1 and biotin are closely related to the growth and metabolic process of living cells [15,16]. We speculate that the lack of vitamin B1 or biotin would directly affect cell growth and metabolic process of strain ZX-5, and then result in the significant reduction of phototrophic hydrogen production. Further investigation of the role of vitamin B1 or biotin in hydrogen production during photo-fermentation process will require."
11,Conclusions,"This work demonstrated that the vitamins have obviously affected on cell growth and hydrogen production of R. sphaeroides ZX-5 in an anaerobic, photo-fermentation process. Nicotinic acid, as a precursor of NAD+/NADH, plays an important role in effectively enhancing the phototrophic hydrogen synthesis. Additionally, though vitamin B1 and biotin do not have direct impact on photo-hydrogen production, they must exist in either growth medium or hydrogen production medium. Without either of them, photo-hydrogen production reduced significantly, even though nicotinic acid existed in hydrogen production medium."
