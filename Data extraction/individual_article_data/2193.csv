0,Introduction,"Esters are important contributors to wine fruity and floral aromas, and isoamyl acetate (banana), isobutyl acetate (banana), ethyl hexanoate (apple), ethyl octanoate (melon), and 2-phenylethyl acetate (plum, fruity and floral) show relatively higher odor active values (Thurston, Taylor, & Ahvenainen, 1981). Currently, single Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation is being widely used in winemaking, as it can cause pure and complete fermentation, and is associated with high alcohol conversion rate (Lee, Kho, Yu, Curran, & Liu, 2013). However, studies have shown that selected non-Saccharomyces strains/S. cerevisiae mixed fermentation can enhance ester production. Chen and Liu (2016) observed that simultaneous and sequential inoculation of Torulaspora delbrueckii during alcoholic fermentation significantly enhanced esters contents; furthermore, Kluyveromyces marxianus showed considerable potential in ester production (Reyes-Sanchez et al., 2020), while mixed fermentation also increased the content of higher alcohols, fatty acids, and other volatile compounds, which may introduce off-flavor to wine (Benito et al., 2015). Extracellular or intracellular extracts from selected non-Saccharomyces strains have been applied during alcoholic fermentation to avoid off-flavor during alcoholic fermentation. Our previous study showed that addition of yeast extracellular extracts (EE) from selected non-Saccharomyces strains during winemaking increased ester synthesis (Kong, Li, Jin, Zhu, & Tao, 2019; Sun, Hu, Zhang, Zhu, & Tao, 2018). Ester production during winemaking depended on the rate of ester synthesis and hydrolysis (Sumby, Grbin, & Jiranek, 2010), which depended on the action of the esterase, alcohol O-acyltransferases (AATs) and acyl-CoA: alcohol O-acyltransferases (AEATase) (Kruis et al., 2017). Our previous study showed that higher esterase activities in mixed fermentation can enhance the levels of medium chain fatty acid ester (Ma, Yan, Wang, Zhang, & Tao, 2017). In addition, ester precursors, such as high alcohols and fatty acids, are also important factors for fruity ester production. Khanom and Ueda (2008) observed that the contents and profile of higher alcohols can significantly influence wine volatile ester content. As volatile compounds in wine, higher alcohol content lower than 300 mg/L increased wine complexity aroma, while that over 400 mg/L had a detrimental effect on wine aroma (Rapp & Versini, 1991). Generally, the levels of higher alcohols derived from metabolism of amino acids can be modulated by the levels of assimilable nitrogen in fermenting grape juice. Fatty acids are also important for wine aroma formation during alcohol fermentation, not only as odorants and ester precursors, but also as the component of yeast membrane. Previously, Lafon-Lafourcade (1983) and Viegas, Rosa, Sa-Correia, and Novais (1989) have shown that lower concentration of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) enhances wine fruity traits, while Saerens et al. (2006) revealed that addition of high concentration of hexanoic acid (5 mM = 580.80 mg/L) and octanoic acid (1 mM = 144.21 mg/L) in wild S. cerevisiae fermentation can enhance MFE levels several times, although they introduced off-flavor when their levels reached approximately 30 mg/L. Recently, Liu, Zhang, Duan, and Yan (2020) reported that addition of 41–410 mg/L unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid, oleic acid, and linolenic acid) in alcoholic fermentation may result in overexpression of alcohol acetyltransferases (encoded by ATF1) and acyl-CoA: ethanol O-acyltransferases (encoded by EEB1), thereby increasing ester biosynthesis. However, the effect of MCFA supplementation (including appropriate supplementation amount and time) on wine fruity ester production during alcoholic fermentation is not completely understood, and little is known regarding the contribution of ester-related enzymes and ester precursors to fruity ester production during winemaking. Previously, we have shown that esterase activities were considerably high and fruity ester content was elevated in mixed fermentation of P. fermentans and S. cerevisiae. This study aimed to evaluate the role of ester-related enzymes and ester precursors in wine fruity ester production during alcoholic fermentation. A selected Pichia strain, P. fermentans Z9Y-3, and its intracellular enzymes (IEs), were used during simulated grape juice fermentation to modulate ester-related enzyme levels and influence wine ester production. In addition, MCFAs were supplemented at different phases during single S. cerevisiae fermentation to assess their effect on fruity esters production. Our observations are expected to provide technical and experimental evidence for developing a new winemaking technology for enhancing wine aroma and quality."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Yeasts, crude enzymes and ester precursor preparation","2.1 Yeasts, crude enzymes and ester precursor preparation Commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Actiflore F5 purchased from Laffort France. Non-Saccharomyces yeasts: Pichia fermentans Z9Y-3 from Sichuan liquor pool in China, which has stronger esterase and glycosidase activities. Crude enzyme preparation: crude enzymes from the intracellular extracts (IE) from Pichia fermentans Z9Y-3 were obtained using the method of extraction mentioned in Hu et al. (2016), with slight modifications. The strain was incubated in fermentation medium for 72 h (28 °C, 150 rpm), and the yeast sediment was obtained via centrifugation (9338g, 4 °C, 15 min). The sediment was purified using phosphate buffer solution. The yeast cells were disrupted using 0.45 μm glass beads for 20 min in cell disruptor, and the broken cells were centrifuged (9,338g, 4 °C, 5 min) to obtain the supernatant. Next, the supernatant purified using finely ground (NH4)2SO4 to 80% saturation and incubated overnight; then, it was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 10 min and dialyzed (dialysis membrane cut off < 10 kDa) in 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 4 °C. Finally, the crude enzymes were obtained by concentrating 20 times using PEG 20,000. Supplementation of MCFAs: MCFAs were added as ester precursors during alcoholic fermentation. To prevent the fatty acid concentration from exceeding their normal concentration in wine, 3 mg/L hexanoic acid, 3 mg/L octanoic acid, and 1.2 mg/L decanoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) were added during S. cerevisiae single fermentation. The normal concentration of fatty acids was as mentioned in Guth (1997) and Ferreira, Lopez, and Cacho (2000)."
3,"Determining the activities of esterase, AATs, and AEATase","2.2 Determining the activities of esterase, AATs, and AEATase Esterase activities were detected according to Pérez-Martín, Seseña, Izquierdo, and Palop (2013) with some modifications. The substrate specificity of the esterase toward several p-nitrophenol esters of different acyl chain lengths was determined in a standard assay using the following substrates: 4-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA), 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB), 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate (p-NPH), 4-nitrophenyl octanoate (p-NPO), and p-nitrophenyl decanoate (p-NPD). One unit of esterase activity (U) was defined as μmol of p-nitrophenol released per minute per gram of dry cell weight. Dry cell weight was determined from 10 mL culture samples adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5. AAT activity was detected per Saerens et al. (2006) with some modifications. Acetyl CoA was the substrate of C2 AATs and butyryl-CoA lithium salt, hexanoyl CoA lithium salt, octanoyl CoA lithium salt, and N-decanoyl CoA were the substrates of C4-C10 AEATase. AAT and AEATase activities were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS); One unit of acetyltransferase activity (U) was defined as μg/L of corresponding ester released per minute per gram of dry cell weight at 40 °C. All experiments were performed in triplicate."
4,Winemaking using simulated grape juice,"2.3 Winemaking using simulated grape juice Simulated grape juice (glucose, 100 g/L; potassium hydrogen tartrate, 2.5 g/L; fructose, 100 g/L; K2HPO4, 1.1 g/L; citric acid, 0.2 g/L; MgSO4·.7H2O, 1.5 g/L; malic acid, 3 g/L; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.4 g/L; H3BO3, 0.04 g/L; yeast powder, 1%; pH 3.5) was prepared per simulated grape juice formulation reference Contreras et al. (2015) with minor modifications. In this study, P. fermentans and its IEs were added during alcoholic fermentation, and the experimental groups were as follows: (1) Actiflore F5: P. fermentans = 1:1 (SP), (2) IEs from P. fermentans were added at 0 h of Actiflore F5 single fermentation (ES1), (3) IEs from P. fermentans were added at 48 h of Actiflore F5 single fermentation (ES2), and (4) IEs from P. fermentans were added at 120 h of Actiflore F5 single fermentation (ES3); the corresponding control group was Actiflore F5 single fermentation (SC). Subsequently, MCFAs were added at different phases of Actiflore F5 single fermentation. The experimental groups were as follows: (1) addition of MCFAs at 0 h of Actiflore F5 pure fermentation (BF), (2) addition of MCFAs at 48 h of Actiflore F5 pure fermentation (MF), and (3) addition of MCFAs at 120 h of Actiflore F5 pure fermentation (EF); the corresponding control group was Actiflore F5 single fermentation (CK)."
5,Volatile compound analysis,"2.4 Volatile compound analysis Volatile compounds were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with the AOC-6000 autosampler (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and SPME arrow (DVB/CAR/PDMS phase, 120 μm film thickness, 20 mm film length). Wine samples (8 mL), 0.4 mg/L internal standard (2-octanol), and 2 g NaCl were added in the 15 mL-headspace bottle (China Taicang Daobang Chromatography Technology Co. Ltd) and stirred in a 40 °C heater for 15 min. Subsequently, the fiber was exposed for 30 min at 40 °C with agitation speed of 600 rpm, then desorbed in the gas chromatography injector at 250 °C for 5 min using a Shimadzu QP2020 GC–MS (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a DB-WAX column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Agilent J & W, USA). GC–MS was performed according to Wang, Li, Dizy, Ullah, Sun, and Tao (2017) with some modifications. The carrier gas was helium (99.999%) with flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The GC program was as follows: 40 °C for 3 min, raised to 160 °C at 4 °C/min, followed by increase to 220 °C at 7 °C/min, and maintained for 5 min. The temperatures of the MS transfer line and ion source were 220 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometric data fromm/z35 to 350 were scanned at 0.2 s intervals. Aroma compounds were identified by comparing the retention time and mass spectra with those of pure standards in the NIST 17.0 mass spectral library of Japan Shimadzu Inc. Quantitative analysis was performed using the internal standard-standard curve method. 2-Octanol was used as the internal standard substance, and the standard curve was plotted using the 5-point method. For volatile compounds without reference substances, the standard curve of substance with similar chemical structures was used for calculation (Ferreira et al., 2000) (Supplementary Table 1)."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis Significant differences in volatiles and aroma traits among wine treatments were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The distribution of aroma components in different treatments were subjected to principle component analysis (PCA) using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA). The contributions of volatile categories to final wine aromas were expressed as regression coefficients in Pearson correlation analysis model. The Pearson model used cross validation and the variables were standardized using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)."
7,Results and analysis,
8,"Esterase, AAT, and AEATase activities","3.1 Esterase, AAT, and AEATase activities In this study, P. fermentans and its IE were inoculated during S. cerevisiae pure fermentation. The total fermentation time was 144 h (Supplementary Fig. 1), and the remaining sugar concentration was lower than 2 g/L at the end of alcoholic fermentation. P. fermentans and its IE did not affect the fermentation tendency of S. cerevisiae. Esterase, AAT, and AEATase activities of IEs from P. fermentans were detected during alcoholic fermentation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Esterase hydrolyzes the C2-C10 carbon-chain substrates, AATs synthesize C2 carbon-chain length substrate, and AEATase catalyze the synthesis of C4-C10 carbon-chain length substrate. Results showed that C2, C4, C8, and C10 esterase activities were higher than those of AATs/AEATase, while C6 AEATase activities were higher than that of the C6 esterase. Esterase activities ranged from 34.13 U to 62.12 U, and C4 and C6 esterase showed the highest and lowest activities, respectively; the activities of AATs and AEATase ranged from 20.6 U to 45.90 U, among which C10 AEATase showed lowest activities in IEs. Inoculation of P. fermentans and its IE in S. cerevisiae fermentation, as well as fermentation using pure-culture of S. cerevisiae (SC) were selected for comparing the cumulative activities of esterase, AAT, and AEATase in the fermentation process every 24 h (Fig. 1 ). Results showed that C2-C10 esterase cumulative activities were higher than that of AATs/AEATase, and that the esterase cumulative activities ranged from 90 to 160 U, and that of AATs/AEATase from 6 to 70 U. Compared to SC, SP increased the cumulative activities of C2, C4, C6 esterase and C2 AATs by 28.18%, 7.67%, 116.77%, and 59.94% respectively; supplementation of IEs enhanced the cumulative activities of C2, C4 ,C6, C8 esterase and C2 AATs by 5.74%, 71.29%, 91.19%, 35.83%, and 48.93%, respectively, during alcoholic fermentation. However, AAT and AEATase activities were lower than that after the addition of enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating that AATs and AEATase addition could not be utilized by yeast, although it may stimulate the expression of the corresponding genes encoding AATs and AEATase in yeast, resulting in higher activities of AATs and AEATase in mixed fermentation."
9,Analysis of fermentative volatile compounds,"3.2 Analysis of fermentative volatile compounds The concentration of acetic acid, a volatile compound, was also detected during alcoholic fermentation (Supplementary Table 2). Results showed that acetic acid content ranged from 0.04 g/L to 0.41 g/L, which was within the scope of legislative standards. In addition, eighteen fermentative volatiles were detected in this study (Supplementary Table 3), which including 3 higher alcohols, 4 fatty acids, ethyl acetate, 4 acetate higher alcohol esters (AHEs), 1 short chain fatty acid ethyl esters (SFEs), and 5 medium chain fatty acid ethyl esters (MFEs). The dynamic changes in their concentration were analyzed every 24 h during alcoholic fermentation (Fig. 2 ). Results showed that the content of higher alcohols increased with fermentation time up to 120 mg/L. Inoculation of IEs at 0 h and 48 h of alcoholic fermentation (ES1 and ES2) enhanced higher alcohol contents, while P. fermentans and IEs inoculated at 96 h (SP and ES3) during S. cerevisiae pure fermentation decreased the higher alcohol content. Acetate esters were divided into ethyl acetate and AHEs, the contents of which first increased, then decreased, and peaked at 96 h of mixed fermentation. Ethyl acetate content was 10–40 mg/L, which was several times higher than that of AHEs (1–4.5 mg/L). In addition, volatile compound production was significantly higher in SP, ES1, ES2, ES3 than in SC, and their contents were sorted in the order of ES1 > SP > ES2 > ES3 > SC at the end of alcoholic fermentation. Fatty acid levels first increased then decreased; the levels increased significantly in ES2, while SP, ES1, and ES3 did not significantly affect its production compared to that in SC. In the final wine sample, the remaining contents of fatty acids were 15.19–15.98 mg/L. The concentration of SFEs such as ethyl butyrate and those of MFEs such as ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl laurate ranged from 0.2 mg/L to 1.2 mg/L and from 4 mg/L to 14 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, compared to that in SC, SFE and MFE content increased significantly in fermentation inoculated with P. fermentans and IEs; ES1, ES2, and ES3 showed higher contents of SFEs and MFEs than SP, with ES2 showing the maximum production. To distinguish the final wine samples obtained using different inoculation strategies from the general outline of fermentative aroma components, PCA was conducted on the chemical group contents. Fig. 3 shows chemical group loadings and wine sample distributions in the first two PCs. The total variance of the first two PCs was 75.65%, and the variance of PC1 was 46.74%. SP was in the first quadrant of PC2 axis, which contained ethyl decanoate, ethyl octanoate, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and decanoic acid, whereas SC was in the second quadrant, closely associated with ethyl butyrate and 2-phenylethanol; ES1 and ES2 were in the positive direction of the PC1 axis, where most acetate esters, higher alcohol, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl laurate were located. ES3 was closely associated with phenethyl acetate in the negative direction of PC2 axis. This result was consistent with the evolution of these compounds and indicated that ES2 showed better aroma compounds during alcoholic fermentation."
10,Correlation between fruity esters and enzymes or their precursors,"3.3 Correlation between fruity esters and enzymes or their precursors We performed Pearson correlation analysis to further investigate the relationship between fruity esters and their chemical precursors or enzymes (Table 1 ). The C2-C6 esterase showed positive effect on fruity ester production, and the Pearson coefficients for the associations between C4 esterase and ethyl acetate (0.421), AHEs (0.454), SFEs (0.522), and MFEs (0.567) were the highest for all esterases. However, the C8 and C10 esterases showed contrary effect on fruity ester content, as they inhibited fruity ester production during alcoholic fermentation. C2 AATs and C4-C10 AEATase showed positive correlation with fruity esters; C2 AATs showed significant relationship with ethyl acetate (0.365) (P < 0.05), and the Pearson correlation coefficients between C6-C10 AEATase and SFEs and MFEs were significant, with the C8 AEATase and SFEs showing the highest coefficient (0.487**) among AEATases. In addition, acetic acid showed positive correlation with fruity ester, albeit not significant, which was, however, lower than that of higher alcohols and fatty acids. Furthermore, extremely significant correlations were observed between higher alcohols and ethyl acetate (0.789), AHEs (0.892), SFEs (0.788), and MFEs (0.522). Similarity, fatty acids also showed high correlation with ethyl acetate, AHEs, SFEs and MFEs, and the order of Pearson coefficients was in the order MFEs (0.940) > SFEs (0.856) > ethyl acetate (0.660) > AHEs (0.607). It is noteworthy that the Pearson coefficient between fatty acids and MFEs (0.940) was highest among all coefficients during alcoholic fermentation."
11,Effect of MCFA supplementation on fruity ester production,"3.4 Effect of MCFA supplementation on fruity ester production To investigate the importance of fatty acids in fruity ester production, MCFAs (including 3 mg/L hexanoic acid, 3 mg/L octanoic acid, and 1.2 mg/L decanoic acids) were added at the prophase (0 h), metaphase (48 h), and anaphase (120 h) during S. cerevisiae single fermentation. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the fermentation process after MCFA supplementation by calculating the loss in weight of CO2 during fermentation. The total fermentation time was 168 h, and supplementation of MCFAs showed same tendency as that observed in S. cerevisiae pure fermentation. The levels of fermentative volatiles (including higher alcohols, fatty acids, acetate esters, and fatty acid ethyl esters) were analyzed (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, Fig. 4 showed the dynamic changes in fermentative volatile content during alcoholic fermentation. The higher alcohol content initially increased and then decreased, and their remaining content was 140–200 mg/L. Compared to that observed in S. cerevisiae pure fermentation (CK), MCFA supplementation at the anaphase (120 h) of S. cerevisiae single fermentation (EF) increased higher alcohol production. Similarity, ethyl acetate and AHEs showed the same tendency as higher alcohols, and their highest concentrations were 55 mg/L and 4.0 mg/L, respectively. Addition of MCFAs at the metaphase enhanced ethyl acetate content compared to that in CK, while MCFA addition at the prophase of fermentation (BF) decreased its contents. In contrast, BF, MF, and EF increased AHE production, with MF showing the best effect. Regarding dynamic changes in fatty acid concentration during fermentation, BF showed higher fatty acid content before 96 h of fermentation, while MF was advantageous after 96 h. The remaining fatty acid content in CK, BF, MF, and EF were 16.09 mg/L, 17.10 mg/L, 20.81 mg/L, and 17.01 mg/L, respectively. Fatty acid ethyl esters included SFEs and MFEs, the concentration of which ranged from 0 to 18 mg/L. MF and EF increased fatty acid ethyl ester production, whereas BF did not. This indicted that addition of fatty acids at different time points of fermentation enhanced fruity ester production to different extents, and that addition at 48 h of alcoholic fermentation showed the best effect. PCA was applied for analyzing the final wine samples obtained after MCFA supplementation in different fermentation phases and differentiating them from the general outline of fermentative aroma components (Fig. 5 ). The total variance of first two PCs was 79.22%, and the proportion of the first PC was 47.32%. Results showed that MF was in the first quadrant of the positive direction of the PC2 axis, where medium chain fatty acid ethyl ester, decanoic acid, octanoic acid, isovaleric acid, isobutyl alcohol. and phenethyl acetate were located. EF was in the second quadrant, where it was associated with acetate higher alcohol esters (isobutyl acetate and isoamyl acetate). BF was in the fourth quadrant of the positive direction of the PC1 axis, where hexanoic acid, isobutyric acid, butanoic, 2-phenethyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl acetate were located. CK was in the negative direction of the PC1 and PC2 axes, where volatiles compounds were not located. This indicted that addition of fatty acids significantly affected fruity ester production compared to S. cerevisiae single fermentation. This agreed with the evolution of volatile compounds during alcoholic fermentation."
12,Discussion,"Esterase is widely known as enzymes that catalyze both the hydrolysis and synthesis of esters during winemaking, and esterase-encoding genes in S. cerevisiae have been characterized. Lilly, Lambrechts, and Pretorius (2000) indicated that overexpression of esterase genes may enhance ester content by several folds, and Darsonval, Alexandre, and Grandvalet (2016) confirmed that different esterase genes in wine yeast showed different extents of ester synthesis and hydrolysis. In this study, P. fermentans, with higher esterase activity, and its IEs, were used in synthetic grape must alcoholic fermentation. They enhanced C2-C6 esterase cumulative activities in mixed fermentation with S. cerevisiae, which was consistent with the results of our previous study (Ma et al., 2017). Currently, non-Saccharomyces yeast are inoculated during winemaking to enhance wine aroma by increasing the concentration of volatile compounds (Albertin et al., 2017; Sadoudi et al., 2012). It should be noted that mixed fermentation of P. fermentans and its IEs with S. cerevisiae enhanced ethyl acetate, AHEs, SFEs, and MFEs production to different levels, and inoculation of IEs at 48 h during alcoholic fermentation showed maximally promoted the ester content. Furthermore, the cumulative activities of C2-C6 esterase showed positive correlation with ethyl acetate, AHEs, SFEs, and MFEs, with significant correlation with SFEs and MFEs. Therefore, higher cumulative esterase activities led to higher fruity ester production, and P. fermentans and its IEs showed considerable advantages in elevating fruity ester production. We determined the cumulative activities of C2-alcohol O-acyltransferases (AATs) and C4-C10 acyl-CoA: alcohol O-acyltransferases (AEATase) during alcoholic fermentation. AATs as critical and versatile enzymes can utilize alcohols and acyl-COA to form acetate esters (Beekwilder et al., 2004; Kruis et al., 2019), and AEATase can transfer fatty-acyl groups from acyl-glycerol or acyl-CoA derivatives to alcohols to synthesize ethyl esters (Mason & Dufour, 2000; Saerens et al., 2006; Zhuang et al., 2015). The genetics of AATs and AEATase have been investigated in the past. For instance, AATs are encoded by ATF1, Lg-ATF1, and ATF2. Gethins et al. (2015) observed that disruption of ATF1 reduces ethyl acetate production, while Yin et al. (2019) suggested that overexpressed ATF1 enhanced the total ester content in Kluyveromyces marxianus. It is noteworthy that mixed fermentation of P. fermentans and its IE with S. cerevisiae elevated the cumulative activities of C2-AATs and C6-AEATase, and P. fermentans/S. cerevisiae mixed fermentation positively affected their activities. In addition, AATs showed higher Pearson correlation with ethyl acetate and AHEs than that with SFEs and MFEs, while AEATase showed contrary results with AATs. This is consistent with their enzymatic properties of catalyzing ester formation (Saerens et al., 2008; Yoshioka & Hashimoto, 2006). Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis showed that ester precursors, including higher alcohols and fatty acids, displayed higher correlation with ethyl acetate, AHEs, SFEs, and MFEs than AATs and AEATase, indicating that ester precursors considerably affected fruity ester production during alcoholic fermentation. Fatty acids play important roles in cell membrane maintenance, viability, and overall metabolism of wine yeasts under adverse winemaking conditions (Pinu, Villas-Boas, & Martin, 2019); they are also important odorants for wine aroma, especially medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) (Swiegers, Bartowsky, Henschke, & Pretorius, 2005). Lilly et al. (2006) and Bardi, Crivelli, and Marzona (1998) have shown that supplemented unsaturated fatty acids are toxic to yeast and exhibit strong antimicrobial activity, while recently, Liu et al. (2020) showed that application of high/low concentration of unsaturated fatty acids mixture (about 41–410 mg/L) during alcoholic fermentation increased ester production. In this study, 3 mg/L hexanoic acid, 3 mg/L octanoic acid, and 1.2 mg/L decanoic acid were added during alcoholic fermentation, and the remaining contents of total MCFAs were 13.87–20.81 mg/L at the end of fermentation, while that of MCFAs in mixed fermentation of P. fermentans and its IE with S. cerevisiae was 15.19–15.98 mg/L. Viegas et al. (1989) showed that addition of 16 mg/L octanoic acid and 8 mg/L decanoic inhibited yeast growth significantly, and that commercial wine contained 0.02–5.70 mg/L, 0.07–20.90 mg/L, and 0–4.50 mg/L hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, and decanoic acid, respectively (Guth, 1997; Swiegers & Pretorius, 2005), indicating that the concentration of supplemented MCFA was appropriate and economical. Furthermore, MCFA supplementation at different phases of alcoholic fermentation enhanced ethyl acetate, AHE, and fatty acid ethyl ester production, and that their final yields were 53.4 mg/L, 3.0 mg/L, and 9.0 mg/L respectively, while their yields in P. fermentans / S. cerevisiae mixed fermentation were 35 mg/L, 3.0 mg/L, and 7.6 mg/L, respectively. This indicated that the concentration of MCFA supplementation regulated fruity ester production. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that fatty acids showed significant correlation with fruity ester content; in particular, the correlation coefficient between fatty acids and MFEs was 0.940, which explained the importance of MCFAs in fruity ester production. Studies have shown that ATF1, ATF2, EHT1, and EHT2 were related to ester synthesis during fermentation in wine yeast (Saerens et al., 2006). In addition, ATF1 and ATF2 in yeast encode acetate ester synthase, while EHT1 and EEB1 are linked with MFE biosynthesis. In this study, supplementation of MCFAs during alcoholic fermentation enhanced fruity acetate ester and fatty acid ethyl ester content. Therefore, this indicates that MCFAs induced the expression of the corresponding genes during fermentation and elevated ester-related enzyme activities, which significantly enhanced production of fruity esters. However, the molecular mechanism via which MCFAs enhance the expression of the corresponding genes during fermentation warrants further investigation."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, Pichia fermentans and its intracellular enzymes inoculated during alcoholic fermentation increased C2-C6 esterase, C2 AAT, and C6 AEATase cumulative activities, and enhanced ethyl acetate, AHE, SFE, and MFE production; in particular, inoculation of the IEs at 48 h of S. cerevisiae pure fermentation considerably promoted fruity ester contents. Additionally, the cumulative activities of C2-C6 esterase showed significant correlation with fruity ester; C2-AATs and AEATase showed significant correlation with ethyl acetate, SFEs and MFEs. Ester precursors showed higher correlation with fruity ester than ester-related enzyme activities; in particular, fatty acids showed highest correlation with fruity esters. Furthermore, addition of appropriate concentration of MCFAs at different phase of alcoholic fermentation may increase acetate ester and fatty acid ethyl ester production, while that at metaphase showed the best effect on fruity ester production compared to that in mixed fermentation of P. fermentans and its IE with S. cerevisiae. However, the relatively higher increase in ethyl acetate level after supplementing MCFAs during alcoholic fermentation may potentially introduce off-flavor in wine. The molecular mechanism via which MCFA supplementation enhances fruity ester production warrants further investigation; furthermore, the application of MCFA for large-scale production of wine with fruity aroma should be optimized."
