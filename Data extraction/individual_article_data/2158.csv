0,Introduction,"The extensive utilization of non-renewable fossil fuels has led to serious energy crisis and environmental problems [1–3]. Hydrogen is considered as an ideal alternative to fossil fuels because of its high energy density by mass (higher heating value: 142kJ/g) and clean combustion product (H2O) [4–6]. Hydrogen can be produced from many conventional processes, such as water electrolysis and steam reforming. Nevertheless, these processes are highly energy intensive and not environmentally friendly [4,7,8]. Renewable hydrogen production from biomass by hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) by biological anaerobic dark fermentation is receiving increased attention because of its energy saving, environmentally friendly, and carbon-neutral characteristics [9–13]. The choice of biomass feedstock is a crucial issue in biofuel production [14]. Biofuels may be derived from land-based crops, such as maize and sugarcane. The technologies for cultivation, harvesting, and biofuel conversion of land-based crops are mature. However, biofuels derived from land-based crops have drawn criticisms, due to the competition of food production and large consumption of fresh water and fertilizer [15,16]. In contrast, aquatic algae, which can be classified as either microalgae (e.g., Chlorella, Chlamydomonas, and Arthrospira) or macroalgae (e.g., Laminaria, Ulva, and Gelidium) based on their morphology and size [17–22], may offer promising options for the biofuel production because of the following reasons. Firstly, biofuel yields from algae in same cultivation area are 10–100 times higher than those from land-based crops because of their short biomass doubling time (as short as 3.5h) and high productivities [up to 26,300t dry weight (DW)/km2/yr] [11,18,23–28]. Secondly, algae do not need arable land for mass cultivation because they are aquatic species [19,29,30]. Thirdly, algal biomass contains little or no lignin, which enables easy hydrolysis of the biomass for subsequent hydrogen fermentation [17,20]. Hydrogen production by dark fermentation using algae as substrates has attracted considerable attention in recent years [10,31–37]. However, comprehensive review on this issue is limited. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the stoichiometric hydrogen production potential of complex biomass, such as algal biomass, has not been reported in the literature. Less than 1/3 of energy in glucose can be converted to hydrogen in dark fermentation, whereas more than 2/3 of energy remains in the dark fermentation effluent in the forms of soluble metabolite products (SMPs), including volatile fatty acids (VFAs; e.g., acetate and butyrate) and alcohols (e.g., ethanol) [38]. Further conversion of the SMPs to biofuels and biochemicals can significantly improve the energy efficiency and economic feasibility of hydrogen fermentation [39]. This paper focuses on the discussion of hydrogen production based on the monomers derived from biomass, with a particular attention for algal biomass. The theoretical hydrogen potential of algal biomass is comprehensively discussed, and the current state of hydrogen fermentation technology is evaluated. Furthermore, the challenges associated with algal hydrogen fermentation are highlighted. The detailed objectives of this paper are to (1) analyze the metabolic pathways and theoretical yields of hydrogen production from the monomers of organic components (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) derived from algal biomass during dark fermentation, (2) discuss the effects of pretreatments on hydrogen production from algal biomass during dark fermentation, (3) compare the hydrogen production via dark fermentation and methane production via anaerobic digestion using algae as substrates, (4) discuss the further conversion of SMPs to biofuels and biochemicals, (5) propose an efficient process to convert algal biomass to hydrogen, and (6) estimate the potential of algal hydrogen fermentation in China."
1,Stoichiometric potential of dark hydrogen production from algal biomass,"In dark fermentation, high-molecular weight organic substrates (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) are first hydrolyzed to low-molecular weight ones (e.g., monosaccharides, amino acids, and glycerol), and then are converted to SMPs, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide by HPB [40]. Hydrogenase is the key enzyme that catalyzes molecular hydrogen formation by combining protons and electrons [9]. Typical bacteria genera that are related with dark fermentation are Clostridium, Enterobacter, Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Anaerobiospirillum, Thermotoga, and Caldicellulosiruptor [41,42]. Dark fermentation is mainly composed of hydrolysis and acidogenesis of anaerobic digestion [43]. However, given that slow hydrolysis conducted by HPB seriously constrains subsequent acidogenesis for hydrogen production, additional pretreatment for biomass with high-molecular weight components is necessary [11,44]."
2,Metabolism of carbohydrates in dark fermentation,"2.1 Metabolism of carbohydrates in dark fermentation High-molecular weight carbohydrates should generally be hydrolyzed to monosaccharides, which can then be efficiently used by HPB during dark fermentation [45]. Glucose, which is the most abundant and typical hexose, can be stored in the forms of starch, glycogen, cellulose, and trehalose in algal biomass [10,20,46–48]. A number of studies have reported the metabolic pathways of glucose during dark fermentation ( Fig. 1) [46,49–51]. Glucose is degraded by HPB into pyruvate, coupled with generation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Pyruvate is degraded into lactate (end product) by consuming NADH, or converted into acetyl-CoA, coupled with (1) generation of NADH and carbon dioxide, or (2) generation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, or (3) generation of formate. Formate is further degraded into hydrogen and carbon dioxide as shown in Eq. (1) [52]. Acetyl-CoA is further converted into end products, such as ethanol, butyrate, and acetate, with or without consuming NADH. NADH and H+ generate hydrogen by catalysis of HPB hydrogenase (1mol NADH generates 1mol hydrogen) as shown in Eq. (2) [4]. The NADH generation and consumption during glucose metabolism are shown in Table 1. 1mol glucose can theoretically generate 4mol NADH through the acetate pathway. Therefore, 1mol glucose can theoretically generate 4mol hydrogen [Eq. (3)] [38]. However, the production of other SMPs (e.g., ethanol, lactate, and butyrate) consumes NADH, resulting in the decrease in hydrogen yield. (1) HCOOH → CO 2 + H 2 (2) NADH + H + → NAD + + H 2 (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 Xylose, which is a typical pentose, can be stored in the form of hemicellulose in algal biomass [53–56]. In dark fermentation, xylose is first converted into xylulose-5-phosphate, which is further metabolized through either the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP, Fig. 2) or the phosphoketolase pathway (PKP, Fig. 3) [46,57]. The PPP involves a series of reactions in which xylulose-5-phosphate is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is also an intermediate of glucose metabolism and can be further converted into pyruvate. In PKP, xylulose-5-phosphate is directly cleaved to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetyl-phosphate that is further converted to acetate [57]. The NADH generation and consumption during xylose metabolism are shown in Table 1. 1mol xylose can theoretically generate 10/3mol NADH (PPP) or 2mol NADH (PKP) through the acetate pathway. Therefore, 1mol xylose can theoretically generate 10/3mol hydrogen by PPP [Eq. (4)] or 2mol hydrogen by PKP [Eq. (5)], respectively. Although PPP is the most common pathway, many HPB can also metabolize xylose through the PKP [57]. (4) C 5 H 10 O 5 + 5 3 H 2 O → 5 3 CH 3 COOH + 5 3 CO 2 + 10 3 H 2 (5) C 5 H 10 O 5 + H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + CO 2 + 2H 2"
3,Metabolism of proteins in dark fermentation,"2.2 Metabolism of proteins in dark fermentation High-molecular weight proteins should generally be hydrolyzed into amino acids to facilitate their further use by HPB during dark fermentation. Amino acids are important nitrogen sources that can improve biological activity and growth of HPB [14,58]. However, studies on hydrogen production using pure amino acids or proteins as substrates by dark fermentation are limited [59]. Kobayashi et al. reported that biomass with abundant proteins but little carbohydrates (e.g., waste eggs) hardly produces hydrogen during dark fermentation [60]. Xia et al. reported that hydrogen yield is almost zero when pure glutamic acid is used as sole substrate during dark fermentation [59]. The glutamic acid metabolism during dark fermentation is shown in Eq. (6). Furthermore, HPB prefer to consume monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) than amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and arginine). This is because fermentation of monosaccharides is more thermodynamically favorable with more negative values of standard free energy changes that can generate more adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for HPB cells [45]. (6) C 5 H 9 NO 4 + 3 2 H 2 O → 9 4 CH 3 COOH + NH 3 + 1 2 CO 2"
4,Metabolism of lipids in dark fermentation,"2.3 Metabolism of lipids in dark fermentation Triacylglycerol (TAG), which is the main component of lipids with the weight ratio of 90–98%, is an ester derived from three long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and one glycerol [61,62]. Fermentation of LCFAs to shorter chain equivalents is thermodynamically unfavorable and non-spontaneous (positive standard free energy changes of reactions), unless coupling with methanogenesis [63]. Therefore, LCFAs cannot be fermented due to lack of methane-producing bacteria (MPB) in dark fermentation. Glycerol is a well-studied substrate for hydrogen fermentation [41,64,65]. The metabolic pathways of glycerol during dark fermentation are shown in Fig. 4 [46,49]. Glycerol is first converted into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), coupled with NADH generation. DHAP is then converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is also an intermediate of glucose metabolism and can be further converted into pyruvate. The NADH generation and consumption during glycerol metabolism are shown in Table 1. 1mol glycerol can theoretically generate 3mol NADH through the acetate pathway. Therefore, 1mol glycerol can theoretically generate 3mol hydrogen [Eq. (7)] [41]. (7) C 3 H 8 O 3 + H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + CO 2 + 3H 2"
5,Calculation of stoichiometric hydrogen production potential of biomass,"2.4 Calculation of stoichiometric hydrogen production potential of biomass Table 2 shows the stoichiometric hydrogen yields and contents of monomers by dark fermentation. Glucose and xylose exhibit the same values of stoichiometric hydrogen yields [497.8mL H2/g glucose or xylose; the gas volumes in this paper are calculated under standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (1atm)] and contents (66.7%). The stoichiometric hydrogen yield and content of glycerol (730.4mL H2/g glycerol and 75.0%) are higher than those of monosaccharides. The stoichiometric yields of hydrogen and carbon dioxide of biomass in dark fermentation are predicted by the weight ratios of monosaccharides, amino acids, and glycerol (based on complete biomass hydrolysis) as shown in Eqs. (8) and (9), respectively. The stoichiometric hydrogen content of biomass in dark fermentation is predicted as shown in Eq. (10). (8) Y H B = Y H M · W M + Y H G · W G where Y HB is the stoichiometric hydrogen yield of biomass (mL H2/g biomass), Y HM is the stoichiometric hydrogen yield of monosaccharides (497.8mL H2/g monosaccharides), W M is the theoretical weight ratio of total monosaccharides in biomass (%), Y HG is the stoichiometric hydrogen yield of glycerol (730.4mL H2/g glycerol), and W G is the theoretical weight ratio of total glycerol in biomass (%), which can be estimated as 10.4% of the total lipids (assumed in the form of TAG) for algal biomass [18]. (9) Y C B = Y C M · W M + Y C A · W A + Y C G · W G where Y CB is the stoichiometric carbon dioxide yield of biomass (mL CO2/g biomass), Y CM is the stoichiometric carbon dioxide yield of monosaccharides (248.9mL CO2/g monosaccharides), Y CA is the stoichiometric carbon dioxide yield of amino acids (calculated as 76.2mL CO2/g amino acid), W A is the theoretical weight ratio of total amino acids in biomass (%), and Y CG is the stoichiometric carbon dioxide yield of glycerol (243.5mL CO2/g glycerol). (10) C H B = Y H B Y H B + Y C B where C HB is the stoichiometric hydrogen content of the produced biogas (%)."
6,Components of algal biomass and stoichiometric hydrogen production potential,"2.5 Components of algal biomass and stoichiometric hydrogen production potential The organic components of microalgal biomass are mainly composed of 6.7–68.4% carbohydrates, 14.9–84.0% proteins, and 0.8–63.2% lipids based on the mass percentage of volatile solids (VS; VS of algal biomass mainly comprise carbohydrates, proteins and lipids), as shown in Table 3. The variations in organic components of microalgae are considerably large between different species under different growth conditions. Carrieri et al. reported that the carbohydrate content of Arthrospira maxima significantly increases from approximately 20% to 50% of DW dominated by low-molecular weight trehalose and glucosyl-glycerol under sodium stress [46]. Aoyama et al. reported that the carbohydrate content of Arthrospira platensis remarkably increases from approximately 15% to 50% of DW dominated by high-molecular weight glycogen under nitrogen starvation [66]. Liu et al. reported that the lipid content of Chlorella vulgaris remarkably increases from 7.8% to 56.6% of DW at optimal iron concentration [67]. Lv et al. reported that the carbohydrate content (7–70% of DW), protein content (13–70% of DW), and lipid content (14.5–28% of DW) of C. vulgaris significantly vary at different growth phases [68]. Fernandes et al. reported that the lipid content of Parachlorella kessleri increases from near 0% to 29% of DW, whereas its carbohydrate content decreases from approximately 25% of DW to 10% of DW under nutrient depletion [69]. Based on the determined components of microalgal biomass (Table 3), the stoichiometric hydrogen yield and content are in the ranges of 46.5–386.3mL H2/g VS and 33.7–65.4% (calculated using the method described in Section 2.4). Overall, the microalgal species with high carbohydrate content can produce high stoichiometric hydrogen yield and content. Macroalgal species are typically composed of 67.0–87.2% carbohydrates, 9.4–25.4% proteins, and 0–7.6% lipids based on the mass percentage of VS (Table 3). The various organic components of macroalgae are relatively low compared with those in microalgae. Based on the components of macroalgal biomass, the stoichiometric hydrogen yield and content are in the ranges of 376.3–485.0mL H2/g VS and 64.3–66.0% (calculated using the method described in Section 2.4). Compared with microalgal species, the macroalgal species produce relatively high and stable stoichiometric hydrogen yields and contents because of their relatively high carbohydrate contents and fixed organic components. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipe) is a noxious weed, which is receiving worldwide attention because of its fast spread and crowded growth, resulting in serious problems in irrigation, navigation, hydropower generation, and biodiversity [70–72]. It possesses similar contents of carbohydrates (59.7–68.6% of VS), proteins (24.0–26.5% of VS), and lipids (1.1–2.1% of VS) to macroalgae [44,73]. The stoichiometric hydrogen yield (334.2–385.5mL H2/g VS) and content (63.8–64.4%) of water hyacinth are also similar to those in macroalgae."
7,Hydrogen production from algal biomass through dark fermentation,
8,Hydrogen production from model chemicals,"3.1 Hydrogen production from model chemicals Temperature and pH are considered two key environmental factors affecting dark fermentation [9,74]. Dark fermentation may be divided into mesophilic (e.g., 25–40°C), thermophilic (e.g., 40–65°C), as well as hyperthermophilic (e.g., >65°C) conditions [40,75,76]. The mesophilic condition is more widely applied due to its less energy requirement, compared with thermophilic and hyperthermophilic conditions [9,74,77,78]. Nevertheless, high hydrogen yields may be achieved under the thermophilic and hyperthermophilic conditions due to the following reasons. Firstly, most of the hydrogen consumers are inhibited under the thermophilic and hyperthermophilic conditions. Secondly, thermophilic HPB exhibit higher hydrogen tolerances and faster metabolic activities than mesophilic HPB. Thirdly, high temperature is more thermodynamically favorable for hydrogen fermentation [9,41]. However, volumetric hydrogen production rates under the thermophilic and hyperthermophilic conditions are relatively low due to the low cell densities of HPB [42]. Hydrogen production is coupled with VFA production that can significantly decrease the pH of liquid phase [77]. Optimal pH values have been commonly reported in the range of 5.5–6.5 for dark fermentation [9,74,77]. Low pH is unfavorable for hydrogen production by HPB because such condition can result in charge variation of cell membrane, decrease in hydrogenase activity, and change in metabolic pathway (e.g., ethanol production) for NADH consumption [9,74]. Many studies are available about hydrogen production by both pure and mixed HPB from glucose, xylose, and glucose-based carbohydrates (e.g., trehalose and starch) by dark fermentation [38,77–80]. Su et al. reported that the hydrogen yield of glucose by Clostridium butyricum under a mesophilic condition (35°C) reaches 214.0mL H2/g VS, which is only 43.0% of the stoichiometric yield. The hydrogen content (73.4%) is a little higher than the stoichiometric value of glucose (66.7%), which could be attributed to dissolve of produced carbon dioxide [38]. The hydrogen yield of glucose by Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus under a hyperthermophilic condition (72°C) significantly increases to 448.0mL H2/g VS, which is 90.0% of the stoichiometric yield [81]. Genetic modification of HPB is considered an effective method to enhance hydrogen production [42]. Song et al. reported that the hydrogen yield of glucose by recombinant Enterobacter cloacae with overexpressed hydrogen-promoting protein gene under a mesophilic condition (37°C) reaches 316.6mL H2/g VS, which is approximately 2 times higher than that by wild strain [52]. Alternatively, mixed bacteria obtained in heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge produces a hydrogen yield from glucose up to 342.2mL H2/g VS under a mesophilic condition (35°C) [77]. Heat pretreatment can effectively inactivate most of the hydrogen consumers (e.g., MPB) in the anaerobic digestion sludge. Nevertheless, spore-forming HPB are enriched through the subsequent acclimation. As compared with pure cultures of HPB, mixed HPB from anaerobic digestion sludge may be more likely to be used as the inoculum for large-scale application due to the following reasons. Firstly, they can resist contamination when unsterilized materials are used as substrates, thereby ensuring stable hydrogen fermentation during continuous operation. Secondly, they can use more different substrates, thereby increasing energy conversion of complex materials [42]. Heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge has also been demonstrated as an effective inoculum to use xylose as substrate for hydrogen production (hydrogen yields and contents are in the ranges of 190.6–336.0mL H2/g VS and 42.2–55.0%) [79,82,83]. When the stable low-molecular weight disaccharides (e.g., trehalose) and high-molecular weight polysaccharides (e.g., starch) are used as substrates, pretreatment process is recommended to facilitate carbohydrate hydrolysis and subsequent hydrogen production [74,78,80]. Xia et al. reported that when trehalose is pretreated by microwave heating with dilute acid, hydrogen yield increases to 396.2mL H2/g VS, which is 1.4 times higher than that for raw trehalose [78]. Su et al. and Cheng et al. reported that when cassava starch is pretreated by steam heating, hydrogen yield increases to 351.0mL H2/g VS, which is 1.5 times higher than that for raw cassava starch [74,80]. Overall, hydrogen yields of carbohydrates are commonly in the range of 160.1–448.0mL H2/g VS, which are 32.2–90.0% of the stoichiometric yield ( Table 4). A number of studies have recently been conducted to investigate hydrogen production from both purified glycerol and crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel industries by dark fermentation [41,64,65,84–88]. Reungsang et al. and Liu et al. reported that hydrogen production from purified glycerol is better than that from crude glycerol, because the impurities such as methanol and soap in crude glycerol inhibit dark fermentation [87,88]. However, Lo et al. indicated that crude glycerol is more suitable for hydrogen production because the impurities such as phosphates in crude glycerol show positive effects on hydrogen production [84]. Most studies have reported low hydrogen yield under a mesophilic condition (30–37°C) in the range of 29.2–219.1mL H2/g VS (Table 4). However, Maru et al. obtained a high hydrogen yield of 696.3mL H2/g VS (95.3% of the stoichiometric yield) using Thermotoga neapolitana under a hyperthermophilic condition (80°C). The yields of acetate and carbon dioxide reach 97.0% and 93.0% of stoichiometric values [Eq. (7)] [41]."
9,Reactors for hydrogen fermentation,"3.2 Reactors for hydrogen fermentation The continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) has been widely used in hydrogen fermentation [89]. Substrates and HPB biomass are suspended in the liquid phase in a traditional CSTR. HPB have the same retention time with the hydraulic retention time (HRT), and may be easily washed out under a short HRT [89–91]. Cell immobilization offers an alternative to a traditional CSTR. It can maintain a high biomass concentration without biomass washout under a short HRT, which improves the substrate degradation and hydrogen production. Cell immobilization can be realized by the formation granules or biofilms. Granule-based and biofilm-based reactors can retain more active and effective HPB [89,90]. Up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor and anaerobic filter (AF) reactor are more stable than CSTR under short HRTs [91,92]. Kongjan and Angelidaki found that the HRT reduction to 2.5 d results in cell biomass washout in the CSTR, whereas the UASB and AF reactors show fluctuating and reducing hydrogen production at an HRT of 0.5d [92]."
10,Hydrogen fermentation from microalgal biomass,"3.3 Hydrogen fermentation from microalgal biomass Microalgal biomass may comprise a high lipid content (e.g., >30% of VS, see Table 3). The LCFAs derived from lipids are not advantageous for fermentative hydrogen production (see Section 2.3). Lipid extraction for biodiesel production prior to hydrogen fermentation can be used for microalgal biomass rich in lipids [93–97]. Fermentative hydrogen production from the whole microalgal biomass with a low lipid content and lipid-extracted microalgal biomass residues has been widely reported [10,35,96–98]. The intact microalgal cells without pretreatment have been reported with low hydrogen yields (7.1–33.8mL H2/g VS corresponding to 4.1–17.7% of the stoichiometric yields) under a mesophilic condition (30–37°C) [99–103]. Nguyen et al. found that hydrogen yield by T. neapolitana under a hyperthermophilic condition (75°C) is near zero when Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is used as substrate without pretreatment [48]. This phenomenon occurs because HPB cannot readily access and consume high-molecular weight components that are tightly surrounded by rigid cell wall structure during dark fermentation [10,11,48]. Pretreatment is not only used to disrupt cell wall of microalgae, but also to hydrolyze intracellular high-molecular weight polymers. Carbohydrates in microalgae are the primary substrates responsible for hydrogen fermentation and they are typically in the forms of high-molecular weight starch and glycogen that should be hydrolyzed to achieve high hydrogen yield and production rate [11,48,104]. Yan et al. found that when Microcystis sp. (Taihu blue algae) is pretreated with dilute alkali at room temperature for 12h, hydrogen yields are enhanced to 105.0–133.0mL H2/g VS by heat-pretreated and acetate-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge under a mesophilic condition (35°C) [34,105]. Steam heating at 120°C with dilute acid for 20min is efficient in Chlorella pretreatment to significantly improve hydrogen yield [201.6mL H2/g chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 85.3mL H2/g VS] and production rate (148.0 and 246.0mL H2/L/h) under a mesophilic condition (37°C) using E. cloacae and C. butyricum as the inoculum, respectively [33,106]. The yield of low-molecular weight reducing sugars from Chlorella is approximately 100% of the theoretical value [33]. Compared with steam heating, microwave heating exhibits several advantages, such as short duration, high selectivity, and high uniformity, because electromagnetic field can selectively and instantly elicit thermal effects on polar molecules, such as water, during microwave heating [45,107]. Microwave heating at 140°C with dilute acid for 15min is favorable for pretreatment of Nannochloropsis oceanica and A. platensis, resulting in considerable enhancement in hydrogen yield (up to 101.7mL H2/g VS) and hydrogen production rate (up to 547.0mL H2/L/h) using heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge under a mesophilic condition (35°C) [45,104]. Xia et al. found similar characteristics of biomass saccharification and subsequent hydrogen production of Chlorella pyrenoidosa pretreated with microwave heating with dilute acid and steam heating with dilute acid [11]. Steam heating technology is more promising than microwave heating technology for large-scale pretreatment because excess heat (e.g., waste heat of boiler) can be reused in steam heating, thereby decreasing electricity input and reducing economic cost. Jeon et al. and Choi et al. reported that ultrasonication for 15–60min at room temperature to 45°C is efficient for Scenedesmus obliquus to enhance the subsequent hydrogen yield (up to 168.4mL H2/g VS) and hydrogen production rate (120.3–300.0mL H2/L/h) [35,98]. However, the electricity input for ultrasonication technology should also be considered for large-scale pretreatment. Some other pretreatments including enzymatic hydrolysis, autoclave, and combined mechanical pressing and centrifugation have also been demonstrated as effective methods in improving hydrogen production by S. obliquus, C. reinhardtii, and Thalassiosira weissflogii [31,48,108]. Although pretreatment is necessary for efficient hydrogen production from microalgal biomass, it still exhibits some negative effects on dark fermentation. Pretreatment for long duration or at high temperature could degrade some organic components, thereby decreasing the overall hydrogen production potential, and could also convert some organic components (e.g., glucose) to byproducts (e.g., furfural), which could inhibit the subsequent hydrogen fermentation [78,107]. In addition, acid or alkali pretreatment generally need NaOH to neutralize pH after pretreatment or to be used as pretreatment reagent, and thus, excess Na+ is added into the biomass hydrolyzate, which could inhibit HPB activities during dark fermentation [11,33,34,45,94,104–106,109]. Studies on effective pretreatment method with little unfavorable biomass conversion and additional inhibitor are necessary. Current pretreatments, such as heat and ultrasound, usually consume electricity. They are energy intensive and expensive. Cho et al. found the energy requirements in thermal (50–120°C, 30min) and ultrasonic (130W, 30–180s) pretreatments of microalgal biomass are 8–18kJ/g VS and 39–234kJ/g VS [110]. These values are very high compared with the energy contents in microalgal biomass (e.g., 25.9kJ/g VS) [14]. Ometto et al. reported negative energy balances in biogas production from pretreated microalgal biomass under most of the thermal and ultrasonic conditions [111]. Passos and Ferrer suggested the low temperature heat pretreatment under 75°C may provide a positive energy balance in biogas production from microalgal biomass [112]. More effective pretreatments should be developed to improve the fermentative biogas production whilst reducing energy consumption. Efficient biological pretreatment (e.g., enzymatic hydrolysis) can be potentially used prior to hydrogen fermentation. Alternatively, continuous pretreatment system based on excess heat utilization combined with heat recovery unit is also recommended for future pretreatment research. Furthermore, energy input and economic cost of pretreatment should also be considered for large-scale application [11]. Mixed HPB domesticated by microalgal biomass can accumulate special bacteria that can adapt to microalgal biomass, leading to improved hydrogen production during dark fermentation [10,95,113,114]. Cheng et al. reported that the hydrogen yield and production rate of A. maxima pretreated with grinding and enzymatic hydrolysis significantly increase to 82.8mL H2/g VS and 195.6mL H2/L/h, respectively, when heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge domesticated with the same microalgal biomass is used as the inoculum under a mesophilic condition (35°C) [113]. Cheng et al. also found that hydrogen yield and production rate of A. platensis pretreated by ultrasonication and enzymatic hydrolysis are increased to 96.8mL H2/g VS and 500.0mL H2/L/h, respectively, when heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge domesticated with the same microalgal biomass is used as inoculum under a mesophilic condition (35°C) [10]. Xia et al. conducted continuous operation using C. pyrenoidosa pretreated by steam heating with dilute acid and heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge as the inoculum under a mesophilic condition (35°C). They reported stable production of hydrogen (51.7–62.0mL H2/g VS) and SMPs after HPB adaption and domestication. The microbial community of HPB is developed from a simple structure of one genus (Clostridium) comprising one dominating species (C. butyricum) at earlier unstable stage of fermentation to a complex structure of three genera (Clostridium, Eubacterium, and Sporanaerobacter) comprising three main species (Clostridium cochlearium, Clostridium acetireducens, and Sporanaerobacter acetigenes) at later stable stage. HPB after adaption and domestication efficiently and stably convert microalgal biomass to hydrogen and SMPs [114]. Alternatively, high-performance HPB strains for microalgal biomass utilization can also be obtained by advanced breeding methods, such as physiochemical mutation and genetic modification. The lipid-extracted microalgal biomass, which is rich in carbohydrates and proteins, is also a promising substrate for fermentative hydrogen production [95,96]. Yang et al. used thermal heating at 100°C with dilute NaOH for 8h to pretreat Scenedesmus sp. residues after lipid extraction. The subsequent hydrogen yields of 45.5–46.0mL H2/g VS are obtained by heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge under a mesophilic condition (37°C) [94,109]. The same authors conducted repeated batch operations from Scenedesmus sp. residues after lipid extraction pretreated by thermal heating with dilute NaOH using heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge as inoculum under a mesophilic condition (37°C). They found that hydrogen yield and production rate at final batch significantly increase to 66.2mL H2/g VS and 397.0mL H2/L/h, corresponding to 1.4 and 8.4 time increases compared with those in the initial batch [95]. This result also confirms that HPB domestication can significantly enhance hydrogen production from microalgal biomass, particularly the hydrogen production rate. Nobre et al. used Nannochloropsis sp. as a feedstock for the production of biodiesel, pigments and fermentative hydrogen. The remaining microalgal biomass after lipid and pigment extraction can be efficiently fermented by Enterobacter aerogenes, with a hydrogen yield of 60.6mL H2/g DW [97]. The C/N ratio of substrate is an important factor in dark fermentation [58,115]. Excess C/N ratio inhibits biological activity and growth of HPB, resulting in inefficient hydrogen production. By contrast, inadequate C/N ratio indicates that substrate contains too much nitrogen sources, such as proteins, which are not advantageous for hydrogen production (as described in Section 2.2) [14]. The high protein content leads to low C/N ratio of microalgal biomass, which seriously constrains hydrogen production from sole microalgal biomass [58]. Xia et al. reported that hydrogen production is remarkably enhanced from mixed biomass of C. pyrenoidosa and cassava starch. The hydrogen yield of 276.2mL H2/g VS, which corresponds to 3.7 and 1.8 times compared with those for the sole C. pyrenoidosa and cassava starch, respectively, is obtained at C/N molar ratio of 25.3. The hydrogen production rate of 540.9mL H2/L/h, which corresponds to 3.4 and 3.7 time increases compared with those for sole C. pyrenoidosa and cassava starch, respectively, is obtained at C/N molar ratio of 15.6 [14]. Waste biomass with high C/N ratios (e.g., agricultural and food wastes) exhibits significant potential in improving the C/N ratio of microalgal biomass to facilitate hydrogen production. Little difference in hydrogen production is found using either dry biomass or wet biomass of microalgae as substrates in dark fermentation [31]. However, considering the high energy input in algae drying process (e.g., latent heat of vaporization of water is 2.26kJ/g), wet biomass of microalgae without energy-intensive drying process is strongly recommended for future study. As shown in Table 5, hydrogen yields of microalgae-related biomass are in the range of 7.1–276.2mL H2/g VS (with common hydrogen contents of 16.3–64.0%), which correspond to 4.1–70.0% of the stoichiometric values of dark fermentation, equal to energy yields of 0.1–3.5kJ/g VS. Hydrogen production rates are in the range of 7.9–547.0mL H2/L/h, which are equal to energy production rates of 0.1–7.0kJ/L/h. Studies on pretreatment, HPB domestication, and co-fermentation of microalgae and waste biomass with high C/N ratio are necessary to improve hydrogen production. Furthermore, most of studies on hydrogen production using microalgal biomass as substrate were conducted in batch systems, which is unsuitable for large-scale application [114]. More future studies should be conducted in continuous systems."
11,Hydrogen fermentation from macroalgal biomass,"3.4 Hydrogen fermentation from macroalgal biomass Macroalgal biomass is rich in carbohydrates (67.0–87.2% of VS) with small but suitable amount of proteins (9.4–25.4% of VS) and little or no lipids (0–7.6% of VS), and thus, it is a promising substrate for dark fermentation. As shown in Table 3, macroalgal biomass shows high stoichiometric hydrogen yield (376.3–485.0mL H2/g VS) compared with microalgal biomass (46.5–386.3mL H2/g VS). However, only a few recent studies have reported the hydrogen production from macroalgal biomass by heat-pretreated anaerobic digestion sludge under a mesophilic condition (35°C) as shown in Table 5. Shi et al. achieved 107.5mL H2/g VS hydrogen yield and 260.0mL H2/L/h production rate from Laminaria japonica. Continuous operation produces a hydrogen yield of 92.3mL H2/g VS, which is a little lower than that of batch operation because of the growth of propionic acid-producing bacteria [116]. Jung et al. found significant improvements in hydrogen production rate (620.0mL H2/L/h) and yield (158.0mL H2/g VS) when L. japonica is pretreated by grinding and thermal heating at 170°C [55]. However, Park et al. found that ball mill and steam heating at 120°C is less efficient for pretreatment of L. japonica, with 29.5mL H2/g VS hydrogen yield and 70.0mL H2/L/h production rate [117]. Park et al. found that thermal heating (150°C) with dilute acid is efficient for hydrolysis of Gelidium amansii. However, the byproducts in biomass hydrolyzate (e.g., 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) inhibit hydrogen production. Detoxification by activated carbon leads to recovery of hydrogen production, with 64.5mL H2/g VS hydrogen yield and 142.1mL H2/L/h production rate [118]. The hydrogen production rate is further improved to 510.0mL H2/L/h at optimal parameters of thermal heating with dilute acid [32]. As shown in Table 5, hydrogen yields of macroalgal biomass are in the range of 29.5–158.0mL H2/g VS, which correspond to 6.7–33.5% of the stoichiometric values of dark fermentation, equal to energy yields of 0.4–2.0kJ/g VS. Hydrogen production rates are in the range of 70.0–620.0mL H2/L/h, which are equal to energy production rates of 0.9–7.9kJ/L/h. Although results of the analysis of organic components indicate that macroalgal biomass exhibits higher hydrogen production potential than microalgal biomass, results of recent studies are insufficient to indicate obvious higher hydrogen production results from macroalgae. Similar studies on microalgal biomass (e.g., pretreatment, co-fermentation, HPB domestication, and continuous operation) should be devoted to the use of more macroalgal species (e.g., Ulva lactuca) as substrates to enhance hydrogen production and improve the feasibility for large-scale application."
12,Dark fermentation followed by photo fermentation and anaerobic digestion to enhance energy conversion from algal biomass,
13,Comparison of single-stage anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation from algal biomass,"4.1 Comparison of single-stage anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation from algal biomass Anaerobic digestion comprises four typical steps (i.e., hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis) that convert organic components into methane, carbon dioxide, and other metabolites (e.g., ammonia) by complex microbial community [43,119,120]. Methane yield and content of anaerobic digestion can be predicted by the Buswell equation [Eq. (11)] [18]. (11) C a H b N c O d + ( a + 3 4 c − b 4 − d 2 ) H 2 O → ( a 2 + 3 8 c + d 4 − b 8 b ) CO 2 + c NH 3 + ( a 2 + b 8 − 3 8 c − d 4 ) CH 4 Previous studies have focused on anaerobic digestion of algal biomass (e.g., microalgae Scenedesmus, Nannochloropsis, Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Euglena, Phaeodactylum, Arthrospira, Dunaliella, Microcystis, and macroalgae Ulva, Palmaria, Sargassum) [76,121–136]. The theoretical methane yield for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in algal biomass are 415mL CH4/g carbohydrates, 851mL CH4/g proteins, and 1014mL CH4/g lipids, respectively [18]. As shown in Table 6, methane yields of microalgal biomass (24.0–417.0mL CH4/g VS) are generally higher than those of macroalgal biomass (130.0–279.0mL CH4/g VS), because the contents of lipids and proteins of microalgal biomass are usually higher than those of macroalgal biomass. Co-digestion of algal biomass and waste biomass (e.g., waste activated sludge, kitchen wastes, and corn straw) exhibits relatively high methane yields (234.0–462.6mL CH4/g VS) compared with mono-digestion [125,137,138]. Some issues such as ammonia inhibition caused by protein degradation and sodium inhibition caused by inorganic salts of marine algal species should be addressed to enhance anaerobic digestion of algal biomass [18,126]. As shown in Table 6, methane yields and contents produced using algal biomass are in the ranges of 24.0–462.6mL CH4/g VS (with common methane contents of 49.0–78.6%), which are equal to energy production rates of 1.0–18.4kJ/g VS. Methane production rates are in the range of 0.8–67.0mL CH4/L/h, which are equal to energy production rates of 0.03–2.7kJ/L/h. The median energy production rate of hydrogen of algal biomass by dark fermentation (0.1–7.9kJ/L/h) is approximately 3 times higher than that of methane by anaerobic digestion (0.03–2.7kJ/L/h) as shown in Tables 5 and 6. The higher energy production rate of dark fermentation leads to smaller volume of reactor and shorter hydraulic retention time of operation, and results in lower economic cost and less energy input, which can make dark fermentation more attractive. However, the energy yields (0.1–3.5kJ/g VS) of single-stage dark fermentation are lower than those of single-stage anaerobic digestion (1.0–18.4kJ/g VS), because of the thermodynamic bottleneck of dark fermentation and loss of energy in organic residues, which constrains single-stage dark fermentation [38,45]."
14,Subsequent photo fermentation for hydrogen co-generation,"4.2 Subsequent photo fermentation for hydrogen co-generation The organic residues in effluent of dark fermentation are mainly composed of SMPs (e.g., acetate, butyrate, and ethanol) in supernatant residues and undegraded biomass (e.g., lipid components) in solid residues [45]. SMPs can be converted into hydrogen and carbon dioxide by photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) during anaerobic photo fermentation [Eq. (12)] [38]. Both nitrogenase and hydrogenase are detected in PSB. However, nitrogenase is the key enzyme that catalyzes molecular hydrogen formation. Typical bacteria genera that are related with photo fermentation are Rhodobacter, Rhodopseudomonas, and Rhodospirillum [9]. Based on Eqs. (3)–(7) and (12), the overall reactions of glucose, xylose, glutamic acid, and glycerol are shown in Eqs. (13) [38], (14), (15), and (16), respectively. The stoichiometric hydrogen yield of glucose is improved from 497.8mL H2/g glucose (4mol H2/mol glucose) by single-stage dark fermentation to 1493.3mL H2/g glucose (12mol H2/mol glucose) by two-stage dark fermentation and photo fermentation, the stoichiometric hydrogen yield of xylose is improved from 497.8mL H2/g xylose (10/3mol H2/mol xylose) to 1493.3mL H2/g xylose (10mol H2/mol xylose), the stoichiometric hydrogen yield of glutamic acid is improved from 0 to 1371.4mL H2/g glutamic acid (9mol H2/mol glutamic acid), and the stoichiometric hydrogen yield of glycerol is improved from 730.4mL H2/g glycerol (3mol H2/mol glycerol) to 1704.3mL/g glycerol (7mol H2/mol glycerol). (12) CH 3 COOH + 2H 2 O → 2CO 2 + 4H 2 (13) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6H 2 O → 6CO 2 + 12H 2 (14) C 5 H 10 O 5 + 5H 2 O → 5CO 2 + 10H 2 (15) C 5 H 9 NO 4 + 6H 2 O → 5CO 2 + NH 3 + 9H 2 (16) C 3 H 8 O 3 + 3H 2 O → 3CO 2 + 7H 2 Studies reported that PSB can directly use SMPs in supernatant of dark fermentation for efficient photo hydrogen production using glucose, cassava, water hyacinth with low, or no protein content as substrates in dark fermentation ( Table 7). However, when algal biomass with high protein content is used as the substrate, ammonium [formed from ammonia under an acidic condition as shown in Eq. (17)] is produced in excess in the supernatant under dark fermentation, which seriously inhibits the activity of the key enzyme (i.e., nitrogenase) of PSB responsible for hydrogen production [139]. Cheng et al. found that hydrogen yield is near zero during photo fermentation using supernatant of dark fermentation from A. platensis because of ammonium inhibition. Zeolite can efficiently remove ammonium by selective ion exchange with little influence on SMPs in supernatant of dark fermentation. After zeolite treatment, SMPs can be used in PSB efficiently for photo hydrogen production, and the overall hydrogen yield from A. platensis is enhanced from 98.5mL H2/g VS by single-stage dark fermentation to 354.7mL H2/g VS by two-stage dark fermentation and photo fermentation [104]. (17) NH 3 + H + → NH 4 +"
15,Subsequent anaerobic digestion for methane co-generation,"4.3 Subsequent anaerobic digestion for methane co-generation High-molecular weight residues in effluent of dark fermentation (such as biomass residues and LCFAs) can hardly be used by PSB during photo fermentation. Such residues can be used by MPB for methane production to enhance total energy yield from algal biomass by subsequent anaerobic digestion [11,43,45,140]. As shown in Table 7, the overall hydrogen and methane yields by three-stage dark fermentation, photo fermentation, and anaerobic digestion are 183.9mL H2/g VS and 161.3mL CH4/g VS for N. oceanica, 198.3mL H2/g VS and 186.2mL CH4/g VS for C. pyrenoidosa, 664.2mL H2/g VS and 126.0mL CH4/g VS for mixed C. pyrenoidosa and cassava starch, which correspond to 3.8–17.6 time increases in total energy yields (8.7–13.5kJ/g VS) compare with those in single-stage dark fermentation [11,14,45]. Effluent of dark fermentation can be used directly to cogenerate methane by MPB by subsequent anaerobic digestion, which is also a cost-effective method to improve energy yield from algal biomass. The overall yields of hydrogen and methane by two-stage dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion are 82.8mL H2/g VS and 115.3mL CH4/g VS for A. maxima, 46.0mL H2/g VS and 393.6mL CH4/g VS for lipid-extracted Scenedesmus sp. residues, which correspond to 5.3–27.6 time increases in total energy yields (5.6–16.2kJ/g VS) compared with single-stage dark fermentation [109,113]. A few studies have been carried out to analyze the mass balance of the two-stage dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion [141–143]. Monlau et al. reported 10.7–13.8%, 23.9–28.3%, and 49.4–58.4% of the substrates (based on the mass percentage of VS) are converted to gas fuels (hydrogen and methane), carbon dioxide, and digestate (sludge), respectively [141]. The digestate can be used as a valuable fertilizer, because of the improved availability of nitrogen and significant short-term fertilization effect [144]. Jung et al. used L. japonica as a substrate to produce fermentative hydrogen and methane. They reported that the 7.1%, 73.8% and 10.6% of the substrates (based on COD) are converted to hydrogen, methane, and residue sludge, respectively [142]. Giordano et al. suggested that 2.9–22.8% and 18.9–88.5% of the substrates (based on COD) are fermented to hydrogen and methane, respectively [143]."
16,Dark fermentation as a platform for the production of biofuels and biochemicals,"4.4 Dark fermentation as a platform for the production of biofuels and biochemicals Alternatively, effluent of dark fermentation, which is rich in VFAs, has the potential to be used (1) for direct electricity generation in microbial fuel cells [145], (2) as substrates for biodiesel production by microalgae and yeasts [146,147], (3) as substrates for polyhydroxyalkanoate production [148], (4) as additional carbon sources for wastewater denitrification [149,150], and (5) for the production of various chemicals, such as alcohols, aldehydes, and esters [39,151]."
17,Impurities in biogas,"4.5 Impurities in biogas The raw biogas may comprise various impurities, such as abundant carbon dioxide (e.g., 25–50%), and small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, water, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, siloxanes, halogenated hydrocarbons, and organic sulfur molecules, which are dependent on the substrate compositions and process operation. A cleaning process (to remove trace components harmful to the natural gas grid and engine) and upgrading process (to remove carbon dioxide to improve the heating value) are required to meet the standard for grid injection or use as transport fuel [152]. However, if the biogas is directly used for combustion or combined heat and power generation, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen may be retained in the biogas. The biogas cleaning and upgrading processes are mature. They have been commercialized in many countries, such as Germany and Sweden [153]."
18,Efficient hydrogen fermentation from algal biomass,
19,Hydrogen fermentation of algal biomass at optimized components,"5.1 Hydrogen fermentation of algal biomass at optimized components Although combined dark fermentation and photo fermentation can theoretically enhance hydrogen yield and reduce energy waste in effluent of dark fermentation, this method have some challenges when algal biomass is used as substrate. Firstly, protein content in algal biomass is too high for dark fermentation, leading to low dark hydrogen yield and excess ammonium, which inhibits subsequent photo fermentation [59]. Optimization of growth conditions (e.g., nitrogen starving and sodium stress) to accumulate carbohydrates of algal biomass and co-fermentation of algal biomass and waste biomass rich in carbohydrates can solve this problem [14,46,66]. Secondly, extracellular LCFAs from lipids cannot be used in dark fermentation or in photo fermentation [9,43,63,140]. Furthermore, LCFAs exhibit inhibitory effect on hydrogen fermentation [154]. Therefore, removal of LCFAs before hydrogen fermentation is desired. Combined lipid extraction and hydrogen fermentation is a solution to this issue, because LCFAs in lipids are extracted and used to produce biodiesel, and residual glycerol is readily used for efficient hydrogen fermentation [62]. We propose a method for efficient conversion of algal biomass to hydrogen. This method comprises pretreatment, dark fermentation, and photo fermentation ( Fig. 5). In the first step, algal biomass (or mixed biomass) at appropriate C/N ratio is pretreated with an efficient methods to convert high-molecular weight polymers to low-molecular weight monomers. Monosaccharides and amino acids are obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins, respectively, and glycerol is obtained by transesterification of lipids [45,62]. In the second stage, monomers are fermented by HPB to produce hydrogen, SMPs (e.g., acetate, butyrate, and ethanol), and ammonia, which is further converted to ammonium in acidic condition [114]. Zeolite treatment is recommended if ammonium concentration reaches the inhibitory level of photo fermentation [104]. In the third stage, SMPs are fermented by PSB to produce hydrogen [11]. In general, the fermentable biomass can be totally converted to hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and ammonia [Eq. (18)].

20,Challenges of fermentative hydrogen production for large-scale applications,"5.2 Challenges of fermentative hydrogen production for large-scale applications Table 8 presents a brief comparison of dark fermentation, photo fermentation, and anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion is a mature technology with a low operation cost. It has been widely used for large-scale biogas production in European and Asian countries [155,156]. There are a few demonstration projects on biogas production from waste algal biomass. A 2500m3 anaerobic digester has been built to treat waste biomass from microalgal bloom in Taihu Lake, Wuxi, China. The harvested microalgal biomass is co-digested with swine manure to produce biogas, which can further power a 400kW electricity generator. A pilot project in Sweden has been established to harvest drifting filamentous macroalgae from shorelines in Baltic Sea. The harvested macroalgal biomass may be used for biogas production [157]. In contrast, hydrogen fermentation has not been commercialized [158]. In dark fermentation, the additional alkali to maintain the optimal pH during dark fermentation may significantly increase the operation cost and reduce the economic feasibility [159]. The recirculation of effluents of subsequent anaerobic digestion and/or photo fermentation can effectively reduce the external alkali requirement [142]. In photo fermentation, the light supply is a major constraint for its application. The development of novel technology for effective illumination and light distribution is an important strategy to improve photo hydrogen production. Furthermore, hydrogen fermentation may also be affected by the accumulation of end-products and shift of bacterial community and metabolic pathway [40]. More studies on metabolic/genetic engineering and process engineering are necessary to improve the efficiency and stability of hydrogen fermentation."
21,Potential of fermentative hydrogen production from algal biomass in China,"5.3 Potential of fermentative hydrogen production from algal biomass in China According to Statistical Review of World Energy 2013, China is the largest energy consumer, accounting for 21.9% of the world׳s total primary energy demand in 2012. The total consumption of oil and natural gas of China is 613.2 million ton oil equivalent (2.575×1016 kJ). If petroleum and natural gas are totally replaced by hydrogen (higher heating value: 286kJ/mol), then the total volume of hydrogen demand is 2.017×1015 L. If hydrogen is produced from algal biomass by the combined dark fermentation and photo fermentation method [the stoichiometric hydrogen yield of fermentable components is assumed to be 1537.9mL H2/g VS (L H2/kg VS) based on the median stoichiometric values of glucose, xylose, glutamic acid, and glycerol (1371.4–1704.3mL H2/g VS) as shown in Section 4.2] and 30% of stoichiometric hydrogen yield can be obtained by current technology, then the total algal biomass demand is 4.372×109 t VS. Considering the annual productivity of algal biomass (26,300tDW/km2), in which 75% of components is assumed to be fermentable components, the total area required for algae cultivation is 2.216×105 km2, equal to 2.3% of total land area or 7.4% total sea area of China. Given the stoichiometric potential of hydrogen production from algal biomass (100% stoichiometric hydrogen yield of algal biomass is achieved), and then total area requirement decreases to 0.7% of land area or 2.2% of sea area. This type of energy harvesting from algal biomass could be very beneficial to the Chinese energy situation. However, this potential is a theoretical value, and does not consider the energy demand of algal biogas fermentation, such as harvesting, transport, storage (e.g., ensiling), biogas production, biogas upgrading, and digestate handing. The energy analysis for whole process of hydrogen fermentation (combined dark and photo fermentation) from algal biomass has been rarely reported. A recent study by Risen et al. indicated the whole process of biogas production from waste macroalgae in the Baltic Sea consumes 30–40% of energy content in biogas [157]. More studies on mass, energy and economical balances of the whole process should be carried out in the future."
22,Conclusion,"Stoichiometric hydrogen yields by dark fermentation depend on the contents of monosaccharides and glycerol in algal biomass. Dark hydrogen yields of algal biomass can be remarkably enhanced to 50–70% of theoretical values by efficient pretreatments (e.g., steam heating with dilute acid and ultrasonication) at optimized biomass C/N ratios (e.g., 15–25) using domesticated HPB as the inoculum. Subsequent photo fermentation and anaerobic digestion can significantly enhance the total energy yield to 16.2kJ/g VS. Potential algal feedstock for industrial fermentative hydrogen production could be obtained from (1) naturally grown waste algal biomass (e.g., algal bloom), (2) algal biomass grown in waste water or flue gas from thermal power plant, and (3) residual algal biomass after lipid and valuable component extraction. Furthermore, wet biomass of microalgae is recommended for future study in continuous systems."
