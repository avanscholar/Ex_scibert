0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, the energy demand is growing dramatically, while the finite conventional fossil fuels cannot meet the requirement (Liu et al., 2020a). Based on the Annual Energy Outlook 2020 from the United States Energy Information Agency, crude oil and coal reserves are estimated to be depleted in 2042 and 2112, respectively, as global energy demand will rise by 56% in 2040 (EIA, 2020). Furthermore, the reckless consumption of natural resources and the uninterrupted expenditure of fossil fuels have led to a series of grave problems including air pollution, global warming, acid rain, ozone layer loss, and desertification, which have constituted an enormous threat to the existence and development of mankind. It is urgent and essential to search for clean, alternative, and sustainable energy to reduce the degree of reliance on fossil fuels (Uzar, 2020). Renewable and sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, nuclear, geothermal, and hydro have been successfully utilized to decrease the consumption and dependency on fossil fuels (Benedek et al., 2018). However, those energy sources are intermittent and non-dispatchable, their output power is hard to satisfy the fluctuating electricity needs of society at any time owing to the change of power generation. Bioenergy originated from biomass has overcome the above problem, the primary products including biochar and biofuels, can be used as vital and stable backup energy for storage and transportation (Chen et al., 2021b). Moreover, biomass is the most promising energy source, which has drawn attention globally because of its low cost, sustainability, availability, and environmental friendliness (Ong et al., 2020). Various kinds of materials have been employed as feedstocks for the production of biofuels, such as corn, wood, wheat straw, sewage sludge, plastics, tires, kitchen waste, and microalgae (Lu et al., 2020). Currently, biofuels are classified into four generations according to different biomass sources. First-generation biofuels are mainly manufactured from animal fats or oil-based plants, but the application causes many serious consequences like water crises, ecosystem damage, and food versus fuel debate (Stamenković et al., 2020). Second-generation biofuels have been extensively implemented by exploiting agricultural, industrial, municipal, and household waste as feedstocks to overcome the problems raised by the first generation biofuels. However, there are still some commercial restrictions, especially the high cost of transportation, pretreatment, and conversion (Lee et al., 2015). Third-generation biofuels are derived from microalgae, which exhibit numerous advantages including high photosynthetic efficiencies, good CO2 capture ability, high oil content, exponential growth rates, and non-selective growth condition. Thus, microalgae have been suggested as the most promising and sustainable raw materials for the production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other high-value products, but they are still constrained by low productivity and high cost of cultivation and harvest (Gan et al., 2018). Additionally, fourth-generation biofuels employ genetically modified microalgae to produce biofuels. Genetic modification is utilized to increase the output of microalgae by raising the photosynthetic efficiency, decreasing the photoinhibition, and improving the light penetration. While it is an emerging technology, which is in its infancy and requires more in-depth research (Abdullah et al., 2019). Simultaneously, a proper treatment process is required to utilize microalgae as an energy source. There are two main categories of biomass conversion methods including thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis, torrefaction, combustion, gasification, and liquefaction) and biochemical conversion (fermentation and digestion) (Lee et al., 2020b). Presently, many conversion techniques, such as gasification, torrefaction, combustion, and hydrothermal liquefaction, have been extensively explored. Gasification is a versatile thermochemical technology, which utilizes air, oxygen, steam, or supercritical water to convert microalgae biomass into syngas (H2, CO, CO2, and CH4) at a temperature range of 700 to 1000 °C. However, high energy input and toxic gases emission hamper its development. Dry or wet torrefaction can transform microalgae biomass into solid product, but it is used as a pretreatment method to reduce the moisture content and improve grinding and hydrophobicity of biomass for pyrolysis (He et al., 2018). The combustion of microalgae can produce heat or electricity, but low thermal efficiency and the release of noxious gas and ash hinder its further development. Hydrothermal liquefaction can directly convert wet microalgae at a moderate temperature (300–400 °C) and high pressure environment (10–25 MPa) into bio-oil, biochar, and biogas without any pretreatment process. Nevertheless, huge capital costs, low security, and unobservable reaction process impede its promotion (Chiaramonti et al., 2017). Pyrolysis is regarded as the most popular thermochemical conversion technology, which thermally degrades the organic materials by the cracking of chemical bonds in the absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis is categorized as slow, fast, and flash pyrolysis based on various operating conditions including temperature, heating rate, and residence time, whereas the product distribution can be highly controllable by tailoring those pyrolysis parameters (Ong et al., 2019). Moreover, it is a cheap and effective route to produce biofuels and valuable chemicals because of the superiorities of abundant feedstocks, unstrict conditions, high conversion efficiency, and eco-friendliness, thus it is on the edge of commercialization right now. However, owing to the high oxygen and nitrogen contents in bio-oil, some barriers have impeded the process, such as low caloric value, high acidity, low stability, nitrogen pollution, and corrosiveness. To eliminate the obstacles and enhance the quality of bio-oil, many researchers have explored in-depth and focused on co-pyrolysis, proving that co-pyrolysis is an efficient way to solve the above problems (Su et al., 2021). Co-pyrolysis involves two or more different materials, the interaction between various radicals possesses a promotional effect on the formation of homogenous bio-oil and leads to synergistic effects, which are the crux to improve the properties of biofuels. During the co-pyrolysis process, tires, plastics, and bamboo waste have exhibited the best synergistic effects on the enhancement of yield and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil with microalgae (Dai et al., 2018b). Meanwhile, due to the significant advantages of simplicity and effectiveness, co-pyrolysis is also treated as an ideal waste management technology. The utilization of waste materials including rural solid waste, kitchen waste, wood sawdust, peanut shell, and sewage sludge as co-feedstocks with microalgae has also achieved remarkable results (Bong et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018a). Furthermore, plenty of studies have indicated that catalysts can further facilitate the selectivity of the pyrolysis process and the properties of bio-oil by limiting product distribution, lowering the activation energy, reducing acidity, and cutting down the oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds (Xiang et al., 2018). As the enormous advantages of microalgae and catalytic co-pyrolysis process, catalytic co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes will have a crucial influence on the energy market and play a key role in the future. Numerous literature works on the conventional pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, and catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae have been published (Chen et al., 2015; Enamala et al., 2018; Fakayode et al., 2020). Nevertheless, a review of the non-catalytic and catalytic co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes is limited in the literature, even with the above advantages. Consequently, this paper reveals a critical and comprehensive review of the co-pyrolysis of microalgae with other biomass wastes. Furthermore, the mechanism of synergistic effects between various materials and the catalytic effect on co-pyrolysis are provided. Finally, the economic viability, challenges, and prospects of co-pyrolysis are fully discussed."
1,Microalgae and other biomass wastes characterization,"As the oldest living unicellular microorganisms (1–400 μm) on earth, microalgae have been available for about 3 billion years with approximately 20,000 species (Levasseur et al., 2020). Moreover, microalgae have relatively low requirements for growth environment, which can be cultivated in freshwater, brackish water, marine area, and even land. With the help of chloroplasts, microalgae possess the ability to produce rich organic matters, fix carbon, and release oxygen with high photosynthetic efficiency, which are treated as a promising carbon sink (Sajjadi et al., 2018). Microalgae are mainly composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, with other minor components including vitamins, fatty acids, pigments, and antioxidants. The content of major components is primarily related to the species, cultivation methods, and environmental conditions (Nagappan et al., 2019). The proteins content of microalgae is in the interval of 14.00 to 65.20 wt%, which is widely used in the field of pharmacy vaccine, nutrition, and adhesives (Menegazzo & Fonseca, 2019). Lipids are the most valuable components with the content of 1.10–51.00 wt%, which are suitable for the production of high-value oil-based products (Katiyar & Arora, 2020). Moreover, the content of carbohydrates is between 3.28 and 30.21 wt%, which are the feedstock for valuable chemicals (Klein et al., 2018). The microalgae production industry still faces several challenges like enormous capital investments, high running costs, and huge energy consumption, especially in the cultivation and harvesting process. In 2019, the cost of biocrude based on microalgae is approximately $7.50 per gallon, which is much higher than conventional fuels (Yang et al., 2019). In addition, as the low-cost and most abundant carbon source, lignocellulosic biomass is deemed to be an economically feasible, environmental-friendly, and carbon–neutral raw material for the production of biofuels (Dai et al., 2020). Currently, there are about 5 billion metric tons of crop residues generated across the world annually. In contrast to microalgae, the chief components of lignocellulosic biomass are cellulose (40–60%), hemicellulose (15–30%), and lignin (10–25%), with little extractives and ash, and the composition mainly depends on the type of source (softwood, hardwood, or herbaceous plant) (Sankaran et al., 2020). Meanwhile, more attention has been paid to non-lignocellulosic biomass such as municipal solid waste, plastics, tires, coal, and sewage sludge. The global municipal solid waste has increased to 2.01 billion tons in 2016, which is estimated to rise to about 3.4 billion tons by 2050 (Istrate et al., 2020). In addition, over 300 million tons of plastics are produced annually, resulting in plenty of plastics waste (Kasar et al., 2020). Furthermore, non-biodegradable waste tires are another global environmental problem, more than 1.5 billion tires are scrapped annually (Mohajerani et al., 2020). The disposal of these wastes is a huge global challenge, which possesses a serious threat to the environment and human survival without proper treatment. Co-pyrolysis is an effective and simple solution, it not only can reduce the amount of waste, but also generates valuable products. Table 1 presents the elemental and proximate analyses of various kinds of materials. Most microalgae species possess high nitrogen and oxygen content. The content of nitrogen in microalgae is much higher than other materials owing to the existence of protein, Spirulina platensis possesses the highest nitrogen content of 11.26 wt%. Meanwhile, microalgae species are medium in volatile matter, moisture, fixed carbon, ash, and HHV. Moreover, the oxygen content of lignocellulosic biomass is also high, while the carbon and hydrogen content are relatively low and lead to low HHV, the nitrogen and sulfur content are close to zero. For non-lignocellulosic biomass, polypropylene (PP), coal, and tires possess high carbon content of 84.31, 79.31, and 78.70 wt%, respectively. Additionally, PP possesses the highest hydrogen content, volatile matter, HHV, and the lowest ash content. Sewage sludge has the highest ash content and the lowest HHV, while coal has the maximum fixed carbon content and the minimum volatile matter content."
2,Co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes,"Co-pyrolysis possess the superiorities of simplicity and effectiveness, while microalgae exhibit the strengths of environmental friendliness, high photosynthetic efficiencies, high oil content, and exponential growth rates. Therefore, the combination of co-pyrolysis and microalgae will have a huge impact on the biomass industry, while numerous researchers at home and abroad have devoted themselves to related studies and yielded fruitful results."
3,Co-pyrolysis process,"3.1 Co-pyrolysis process Co-pyrolysis entails the thermal degradation of two or more materials. It is analogous to conventional pyrolysis which is carried out in a closed reactor system by utilizing moderate operating temperature and oxygen-free environment. The transition from pyrolysis to co-pyrolysis does not need any modification of existing equipment but positively influences the pyrolysis process and end-products (Lee et al., 2020a). The whole process of co-pyrolysis is divided into three major steps including pretreatment, co-pyrolysis, and condensation. Pretreatment is a pivotal step in biomass conversion due to the complex nature and structure of biomass materials, which can improve the usability of components for an extensive range of applications (Soltanian et al., 2020). Pretreatment is classified as physical (milling, freezing, and extrusion pretreatments), chemical (acid, alkaline, organic solvent, oxidative, and ionic liquid pretreatments), physical–chemical (steam explosion, liquid hot water, wet oxidation, CO2 explosion, and ultrasound pretreatments), biological (microbial consortium, bacterial, fungal, and enzymatic pretreatments), thermal (torrefaction, drying, and microwave irradiation) and combined pretreatments (Huang et al., 2020). Drying, torrefaction, milling, and sieving are the most common pretreatment methods to obtain small and homogenous samples. High moisture content in biomass can affect the quality of bio-oil negatively. Thus, drying is the most common technique to reduce the moisture content of biomass (Carvalho et al., 2020). Meanwhile, torrefaction can also alter the structure and composition of biomass and improve its grinding, hydrophobicity, and pyrolysis performance (He et al., 2018). Additionally, small particles are conducive to ameliorate the reaction efficiency and promote the production of biofuels on the basis of surface chemistry. Therefore, dry biomass particles with the moisture content of less than 10 wt% need to be smaller than 1 mm to achieve the optimum effect of fast pyrolysis, while flash pyrolysis requires even smaller biomass particles (less than 0.2 mm) (Kumar et al., 2020). In general, pretreatment is the most expensive process because of large energy consumption, different kinds of pretreatment should be selected based on the properties of biomass, capital cost, production condition, and environmental impacts (del Río et al., 2020). During the co-pyrolysis process, biomass mixtures are heated to a temperature that exceeds their thermal stability threshold under anaerobic condition, a range of chemical reactions, such as decarboxylation, decarbonylation, dehydration, and dehydrogenation, occur to form carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and other functional groups. Biomass mixtures are then converted into biochar and biogas, while some volatile components are condensed into liquid products (Tripathi et al., 2016). Pyrolysis is highly affected by various operating parameters, such as temperature, reaction time, heating rate, types of inert gas, sweeping rate, and particulate size. While co-pyrolysis possesses an extra important interfering factor, that is blending ratio of different raw materials. Furthermore, those conditions require to be adjusted according to the characteristic of feedstocks and the optimization of the target product. Condensation is another vital step to isolate bio-oil. In a typical workflow of the fixed-bed reactor, pyrolysis volatiles are condensed into bio-oil by a water-cooled condenser, solid residues are left in the reactor, while the non-condensable gases are collected in a gas bag or released into the atmosphere after filtration. Three stages condensation system is widely employed during the pyrolysis experiment (He et al., 2019)."
4,Synergistic effects on the co-pyrolysis process,"3.2 Synergistic effects on the co-pyrolysis process Synergistic effects are the crux to modify the existing pyrolysis process and ameliorate the properties of bio-oil. The sufficient contact of volatiles produced by each material plays a crucial role in synergistic effects during the co-pyrolysis process. A large number of research groups have delved into the phenomenon, especially on the mechanism of synergistic effects and the improvement of target product during microalgae co-pyrolysis (Sun et al., 2019a). 3.2.1 Mechanism of synergistic effects The underlying mechanism of synergistic effects between microalgae and plastics has been explored and summarized by Tang et al. (2020b) and Qi et al. (2018). With the aid of pyrolysis–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, Tang et al. (2020b) detected that a strong interaction between microalgae and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) promoted the formation of esters and long-chain alcohols, whereas hindered the production of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds in the bio-oil. The free radicals from LDPE enhanced the dehydroxylation and C−C bond cleavage of long-chain carboxylic acids from the hydrolysis of proteins and lipids. Hydration, decarboxylation, and dehydration reforming reactions made carbohydrates generate formic acid, acetic acids, OH radicals, and release H2O, CO2, hinder the formation of furans, phenol, and long-chain fatty acids. Meanwhile, OH radicals reacted with formic acid and acetic acids to form esters, or further combined with the long-chain CH radicals from the cleavage of LDPE to generate long-chain alcohols. Moreover, Qi et al. (2018) observed a sharp rise of aromatic hydrocarbons content in the bio-oil due to violent synergistic effects between Nannochloropsis sp. and PP with the help of HZSM-5. There are three major routes of the mechanism for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Firstly, olefins from the pyrolysis of PP reacted with furans from the cracking of microalgae carbohydrates to generate aromatic hydrocarbons by the Diels-Alder and dehydration reactions, then further formed compounds with six-membered ring structures on the surface of HZSM-5. Secondly, small organic moieties were deoxygenated and decomposed into olefins, while triglycerides were cracked into heavy oxygenated hydrocarbons, then underwent decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions to form olefins. Moreover, with the help of HZSM-5, the volatiles originated from the pyrolysis of microalgae and the olefins generated from the cracking of PP entered the hydrocarbon pool and were converted into aromatic hydrocarbons through the hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Thirdly, olefins generated from the pyrolysis of PP were transformed into aromatic hydrocarbons through HZSM-5 via aromatization, cyclization, and oligomerization reactions. According to Table 1, microalgae have a very high content of nitrogen, which will cause high nitrogen content in the bio-oil and subsequent nitrogen pollution. Thus, it is essential to inhibit the formation of nitrogenous compounds (Liu et al., 2016). Meanwhile, proteins are the primary component of microalgae and the chief nitrogen source, while amino acids are the basic structural units of protein. Therefore, the mechanism of synergy between microalgae and lignocellulosic biomass can be revealed through the co-pyrolysis of amino acids and lignocellulosic biomass (Chen et al., 2017b). Consequently, Chen et al. (2019a) pyrolyzed amino acids with bamboo waste and reported that the inclusion of lignocellulosic biomass into microalgae increased phenols and oxygenated compounds significantly while cutting down nitrogenous compounds sharply. The large number of –NH2 groups in proteins was the main reason for the increment of phenols, which provided numerous H+, then facilitated the scission of lignin fragments via β-O-4 linkage breaking reaction. Additionally, the Maillard reaction and ketonization reaction caused the growth of oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil, −C=O groups from bamboo waste reacted with −NH2 groups easily. After −NH2 groups from amino acids were removed, oxygenated compounds were formed, while the Maillard reaction produced new nitrogenous compounds (Moens et al., 2004). Owing to the large amount of NH3 released during the co-pyrolysis, amino acids generated numerous intermediates which contain –COOH group, then reacted with each other to produce ketones via ketonization reaction directly (Resasco & Crossley, 2015). As the reason for the decline of nitrogenous compounds, numerous −NH2 groups were released out as NH3, while some nitrogenous compounds concentrated in the biochar as the forms of pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, and quaternary-N. Moreover, Chen et al. (2017a) conducted the co-pyrolysis of bamboo with Nannochloropsis sp. and observed a sharp growth of long-chain fatty acids and a sharp decline of acetic acids in the bio-oil. The acidic unit (−COOH) in hemicellulose of bamboo and basic unit (−NH2) in the proteins of microalgae induced condensation reaction during the co-pyrolysis process, which inhibited the formation of acetic acids. Simultaneously, co-pyrolysis inhibited the generation of acetic acids through violent decarboxylation reactions by releasing a large volume of CO2. As for the increase of long-chain fatty acids, the cracking of lipids in microalgae underwent C−O cleavage through acyl or alkoxy during pyrolysis. Therefore, pyrolysis can enhance the cleavage of the alkoxy bond and generate a great number of long-chain fatty acids. Other researchers reported that the synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis could be attributed to the formation of H and OH radicals, materials with high hydrogen content acted as hydrogen donors. Those radicals shifted from biomass to char structure and led to the decomposition of char (Meng et al., 2016). Duan et al. (2015) pyrolyzed waste rubber tires with Chlorella pyrenoidosa in supercritical ethanol and observed positive synergistic effects between two raw materials, which favored denitrogenation and deoxygenation to ameliorate the quality of bio-oil. Microalgae could form solid material then acted as free radical donors to induce the polyisoprene and poly chain scission. The hydrogen transferred from polyisoprene and poly chain to microalgae-derived radicals, which stabilized the primary product of microalgae thermal degradation. Microalgae-derived radicals took part in the termination of polymer radicals to produce bio-oil, biochar, and biogas. 3.2.2 Synergistic effects on the bio-oil As mentioned above, co-pyrolysis exhibits a positive effect on the formation of high-grade bio-oil, synergistic effects are the primary factor. Meanwhile, the performance of pyrolysis and the properties of bio-oil are prone to be influenced by various factors, which have been fully discussed in the literature (Abnisa & Wan Daud, 2014; Azizi et al., 2018a; Fakayode et al., 2020). Thus, this section mainly introduces the influence of synergistic effects on the yield and quality of bio-oil. As summarized in Table 2 , synergistic effects favor the improvement of the bio-oil properties during the co-pyrolysis process. The utilization of raw materials with high volatile matter content is instrumental in the generation of bio-oil, whereas the application of co-feedstocks with high ash content hinders the process, but promotes the production of biochar and biogas (Dhyani & Bhaskar, 2018). Table 1 indicates plastic materials like PP and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) possess the high volatile matter of 99.60 and 93.77 wt%, while the ash content is close to zero, followed by lignocellulosic biomass. While sewage sludge has the highest ash content and coal possesses the lowest volatile matter. Therefore, co-pyrolysis of microalgae with plastics or lignocellulosic biomass can facilitate the production of bio-oil, whereas the usage of coal or sewage sludge as a co-feedstock is difficult to raise the yield of bio-oil. Some studies have reported that synergistic effects are beneficial to increase the yield of bio-oil. Chen et al. (2017a) performed co-pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. with bamboo. The yield of bio-oil went up to 66.63 wt% using 50 wt% of bamboo in the mixture at 600 °C, while the bio-oil generated from the sole pyrolysis of bamboo and microalgae were just 60.05 and 61.85 wt%, respectively. Duan et al. (2015) obtained a similar conclusion via the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and waste rubber tires. The yield of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of pure microalgae was only 52.8 wt%, which was twice as high as that of waste rubber tires. Nevertheless, the highest value of 57.2 wt% was reached through the co-pyrolysis of microalgae with 20 wt% of waste rubber tires. This was because co-pyrolysis inhibited the secondary cracking of pyrolysis volatiles, thereby limiting the generation of biogas. Nevertheless, some researchers have pointed out that the synergistic effects can hinder the formation of bio-oil. Tang et al. (2020a) reported that the bio-oil yield declined during the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and rural solid waste, only 47.23 wt% bio-oil was obtained, which was lesser than each sole pyrolysis. Meanwhile, an analogous result was gained by Chen et al. (2018a), via the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and kitchen waste. The highest bio-oil yield of 56.00 wt% was gained by sole pyrolysis of kitchen waste, while only 30.00 wt% bio-oil was obtained by using 50 wt% kitchen waste. The main reason was the secondary reaction, which converted part of bio-oil into biogas. Moreover, after mixing, feedstocks pertained high H/C ratio, and increased the hydrogen-related chemical groups significantly, which was instrumental in the formation of biogas too. In addition, based on the perspective of the application, hydrocarbons are the most significant chemical composition of biofuels, bio-oil with high content of hydrocarbons can be used as transport fuel additives and industrial chemicals directly (Fan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b). The high content of oxygenated compounds in bio-oil possesses a deleterious effect on the gasoline engine, which will cause several problems owing to high acidity. Consequently, it is necessary to increase the content of hydrocarbons and reduce the content of oxygenated compounds to produce high-quality bio-oil (Mei et al., 2020). Consequently, EHI has been introduced to assess the relative hydrogen content of different samples as shown in Eq. (1) (Bertero et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2018b). EHI = (H − 2O − 2S − 3N)/C (1) The H, O, S, N, and C refer to the moles of hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon. Furthermore, HHV is another crucial criterion for the quality of bio-oil. The high contents of carbon and hydrogen will produce bio-oil with high HHV, whereas the high contents of oxygen and nitrogen have an inverse effect (Ahmed et al., 2020). Many researchers have demonstrated that synergistic effects can positively influence the quality of bio-oil by decreasing the content of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds and carboxylic acids, and increasing the HHV. In general, the addition of co-feedstocks with high EHI is favorable to improve the quality of bio-oil. Xie et al. (2015) pyrolyzed Nannochloropsis sp. with scum and detected the positive synergistic effects on the yield and aromatics proportion of bio-oil when the ratio of Nannochloropsis sp. to scum was less than 2:1. As a hydrogen donor, scum raised the EHI of the mixture to boost the formation of aromatics. Simultaneously, oxygenated compounds in the volatiles from the pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. promoted the cracking of scum, further enhanced the yield and quality of bio-oil. Moreover, Tang et al. (2019) conducted the co-pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. with LDPE and found significant synergistic effects. The growth of the LDPE ratio reduced the content of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds, while prominently rose the aliphatic hydrocarbons content in the bio-oil. Oxygenates tended to evolve as H2O and CO, while nitrogenous compounds were prone to be transformed into gas products. Meanwhile, the addition of biomass with high EHI facilitated the quality of bio-oil was also confirmed by Fang et al. (2018) and Qi et al. (2018). Furthermore, synergistic effects positively influenced the HHV of bio-oil while reducing the yield of bio-oil. Chen et al. (2018a) saw a decline in the bio-oil yield during the co-pyrolysis of kitchen waste and Chlorella vulgaris. The synergistic effects between different materials increased the hydrocarbons content and decreased the carboxylic acids in the bio-oil, resulted in the growth of HHV to 33.9 MJ/kg. The same phenomenon that synergistic effects ameliorated the bio-oil quality and reduced the bio-oil yield was also witnessed by Tang et al. (2020a), Dai et al. (2018b), and Chen et al. (2018c). Nevertheless, synergistic effects sometimes adversely affect the quality of bio-oil. According to the research conducted by Chen et al. (2019b), the bio-oil HHV was 29.30 MJ/kg and 19.93 MJ/kg from the pyrolysis of pure wood sawdust and Chlorella vulgaris with activated carbon, respectively. However, the HHV of bio-oil originated from the co-pyrolysis fell to the bottom of 15.02 MJ/kg, but the yield of bio-oil increased owing to the high volatile matter content of two raw materials. Nevertheless, the phenomenon was not common during the co-pyrolysis process. Synergistic effects can be realized through the interaction of free radicals, while the characteristics of various feedstocks and their blending ratio are the primary factors influencing the synergistic effects and resulting in complex and varied pyrolysis (Wang et al., 2019b; Zhao et al., 2020). Usually, the difference between the theoretical and experimental results of co-pyrolysis is a vital criterion to determine the synergistic effects. YT = W1X1 + W2X2 (2) YD = YE- YT (3) As shown in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), W1 and W2 represent the mass proportion of each raw material in the mixture samples, respectively. X1 and X2 refer to the product or physic-chemical properties of every single raw material, YE and YT are the experimental value and the theoretical value, respectively. If YD greater than 0, suggesting positive synergistic effects on pyrolysis; while if YD less than 0, indicating negative synergistic effects on pyrolysis (Yao et al., 2017). Table 3 summarizes the synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis of microalgae with other biomass wastes on the yield and HHV of bio-oil. Synergistic effects have a complex effect on the bio-oil yield but induce a positive influence on the bio-oil HHV in most cases. Fig. 1 depicts the influence of synergistic effects originated from the co-pyrolysis of microalgae with some representative materials on the bio-oil properties, the accession of plastics and tires presented great strengths, which increased the yield and HHV of bio-oil by 3.7 wt% and 5.22 MJ/kg, 14.7 wt% and 0.67 MJ/kg, respectively. The inclusion of bamboo waste also brought a decent result, increased the yield and HHV of bio-oil by 3.50 wt% and 0.42 MJ/kg, while the usage of sewage sludge had a tiny enhancement on the yield and HHV of bio-oil. Other materials also exhibited impressive performances, the addition of rural solid waste and kitchen waste enhanced the bio-oil HHV, whereas the application of wood sawdust raised the bio-oil yield without the amelioration on the bio-oil HHV due to its high volatile matter content and low EHI. In short, tires, plastics, and bamboo waste are suitable co-feedstocks for the pyrolysis of microalgae. Fig. 2 presents the chemical composition of bio-oil generated from the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris with other materials. The addition of 50 wt% different raw materials possessed a dramatic effect on the chemical composition of bio-oil. At first, there was a remarkable reduction of nitrogenous compounds after adding each material, as numerous nitrogenous compounds were released into the air or concentrated in the biochar. Additionally, the percentage of hydrocarbons increased significantly during the co-pyrolysis of microalgae with kitchen waste and wood sawdust. Synergistic effects between those materials promoted aromatization and deoxygenation reactions. However, the addition of waste glycerol reduced the content of hydrocarbons sharply with the prominent increment in the content of alcohols. This was ascribed to that glycerol was pyrolyzed into ethylene glycol, then further dehydrated to form alcohols. Moreover, additional ester compounds were generated with the drop of ketones and aldehydes during the co-pyrolysis process (Wang et al., 2019a). In brief, the addition of co-feedstocks with high volatile matter content is conducive to the formation of bio-oil. While the application of materials with high EHI can induce a series of reactions, such as Diels-Alder, dehydration, hydrogen transfer, Maillard, ketonization, condensation, denitrogenation, aromatization, and deoxygenation reactions, which inhibits the generation of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds and promotes the production of aromatic hydrocarbons, thereby improving the quality of bio-oil. Simultaneously, as a substitute for fossil fuel, bio-oil is the most economically and environmentally important product. The large-scale production of bio-oil is the only way to achieve the commercialization and industrialization of related industries. Consequently, it is particularly important to search and develop excellent and low-cost co-feedstocks. Many materials with high volatile matter content and EHI, such as medical waste, waste cooking oil, and waste lubricating oil, need to be studied to further ameliorate the properties of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of microalgae."
5,Catalytic effects on the co-pyrolysis process,"Catalytic pyrolysis is a prospective technique to facilitate the existing co-pyrolysis process and the properties of bio-oil. Furthermore, the application of catalysts is conducive to lower the activation energy, reduce acidity, shorten the reaction time, and affect the product distributions (Lee et al., 2020a). The catalytic pyrolysis process is categorized as in-situ and ex-situ modes. For the in-situ process, raw materials and catalysts are mixed before co-pyrolysis, while for the ex-situ process, the pyrolysis volatiles pass through the catalyst at an operational temperature (Yu et al., 2019). Table 4 summarizes catalytic effects on the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes. Numerous studies have reported that the presence of catalysts has a positive effect on the pyrolysis process and product properties."
6,Catalytic effect of zeolites,"4.1 Catalytic effect of zeolites At present, over 60 natural zeolites and 230 zeotype frameworks with special characteristics and porous structures have been discovered and designed. There are various kinds of zeolites including ZSM-5, HBEA, HZSM-5, and permutit, which have been utilized in the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes. Carbohydrates, alcohols, acids, aldehydes, furans, ketones, and other functional groups can easily diffuse into the zeolite molecular sieve channels, participate in a series of reactions to produce oxygen, aromatics, and coke (Zhang et al., 2016). As a consequence of the existence of proteins and high moisture content, the bio-oil originated from the pyrolysis of microalgae possesses high oxygen and nitrogen contents. Therefore, HZSM-5 has been widely used owing to its characteristics of deoxygenation, denitrogenation, and aromatization. HZSM-5 is manufactured from ZSM-5 via calcined and hydrothermal treatments and manifests strong acidity and favorable deoxygenation effect because of active hydrogen, which can facilitate the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and hinder the generation of oxygenated compounds like acids, alcohols, and ketones (State et al., 2019). Qi et al. (2018) conducted the co-pyrolysis of PP with Nannochloropsis sp. and witnessed a sharp growth in the content of aromatic hydrocarbons from 43.38 to 93.29 wt%, a notable drop in the content of olefins from 33.19 to 2.29 wt% and a severe decline in the content of nitrogenous compounds from 18.37 to 0.59 wt%, when the mass ratio of catalyst/feedstock raised from 1 to 10. They elucidated the phenomenon that volatiles fully reached the surface of HZSM-5, the intermediate polar product was produced by degradation during the pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp., the nonpolar compounds and hydrocarbons were formed by the destruction of nitrogenous functional groups. Additionally, the conclusion of HZSM-5 can greatly decrease the nitrogenous compounds and improve aromatics selectivity in the bio-oil was also supported by Zhang et al. (2017) and Yang et al. (2011). On top of that, Xie et al. (2015) studied the effect of HZSM-5 on the properties of bio-oil during the co-pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. and scum. The bio-oil yield declined with the presence of catalyst as the thermal cracking reaction converted the condensable gas into non-condensable gas. Meanwhile, the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons raise sharply, while the content of aliphatic hydrocarbons, oxygenated, and nitrogenous compounds declined. Due to its unique structure, HZSM-5 manifested excellent shape-selectivity to the aromatics and drove the cracking and deoxidation of oxygenated compounds. Furthermore, a similar conclusion was also gained in the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (Mihalcik et al., 2011). However, many studies have revealed that the HZSM-5 can polymerize a considerable number of oxygenated compounds to form coke on the surface of the catalyst, thus reduces its catalytic activity (Wu et al., 2015). To overcome the barrier, the utilization of modified HZSM-5 has attracted attention rapidly. The chemical liquid deposition technique is applied to ameliorating the catalytic performance of HZSM-5 by narrowing the pore openings and reducing the number of external acid sites, which has advantages of simple apparatus, easy operation, and low cost (Dai et al., 2018a). Chang et al. (2018) performed the co-pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. and palm kernel shell with HZSM-5, CaO/HZSM-5, and modified HZSM-5 with Cu. These three types of catalysts raised the aromatics content from 30.39 to 40.19, 36.12, and 42.16 wt%, respectively. The results revealed that Cu/HZSM-5 was the best catalyst which enhanced the quality of bio-oil effectively, as Cu cut down the number of strong acid sites on the surface of HZSM-5 and improved the catalytic activity, while pore structures of HZSM-5 facilitated the formation of aromatics. In addition, HZSM-5 has displayed great performance in the reduction of activation energy during the co-pyrolysis process. Bong et al. (2020) and Dai et al. (2019) reported that the average activation energy fell from 142.56 to 131.37 kJ/mol and 258.72 to 198.66 kJ/mol using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa model with the help of HZSM-5 for co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris with peanut shell and the co-pyrolysis of Spirulina with oil shale, respectively. Furthermore, Tang et al. (2020a) obtained the same result that the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and rural solid waste using HZSM-5 catalyst has decreased the activation energy from 258.33 to 222.64 kJ/mol via Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method. Except for HZSM-5 and its derivatives, other zeolite was also employed in the co-pyrolysis but did not achieve ideal results. Chen et al. (2018b) pyrolyzed the Chlorella vulgaris and kitchen waste with the aid of permutit and ascertained that the catalyst had a predominant promoting effect on the reduction of initial temperature and residue mass, but did not show positive selectivity on the final products."
7,Catalytic effect of metal oxides,"4.2 Catalytic effect of metal oxides Metal oxides exhibit Lewis acid and Bronsted base because of the positive metal ions and negative oxygen ions. They have been explored excessively to improve the properties of bio-oil with the characteristics of acid base and redox. CaO, MgO, CaCO3, ZnO, and SiO2 are the most commercial metal oxides applied in the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes, which can be divided into basic metal oxides (CaO, MgO) and acidic metal oxides (SiO2) (Chan & Tanksale, 2014). Generally, the basic metal oxides are suitable for aldol condensation and ketonization of carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acid, while the acidic metal oxides present better catalytic activity during the deoxygenation process. Microalgae possess a high content of oxygen and nitrogen, thus the catalyst with the ability of denitrogenation and deoxygenation is essential for the pyrolysis of microalgae. Among metal oxides, CaO manifests the best performance on the reduction of acids and nitrides and the improvement of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. Tang et al. (2020a) carried out the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and rural solid waste with the assistance of three different catalysts. CaO raised the activation energy of the overall reaction, while HZSM-5 and MgO diminished it. Furthermore, CaO increased aliphatic hydrocarbons content especially light fraction, reduced acids and nitrogenous compounds content. MgO boosted the increase of hydrocarbons and the decrease of carboxylic acids and nitrogenous compounds for sole pyrolysis of microalgae but failed to the pyrolysis of rural solid waste and all mixtures. Moreover, HZSM-5 raised aromatic hydrocarbons content, but unfortunately, also increased nitrogenous compounds content. The analogous experimental result was obtained by Chen et al. (2018b), via the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and kitchen waste with the aid of CaCO3, CaO, SiO2, and permutit. The process was favored by CaO without exception, the content of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil increased for all mixed samples. Moreover, the acids yield decreased sharply by 2.4 times for pure kitchen waste, 6.1 times for pure microalgae, and 4.5 times for the mixture, the metal cation Ca2+ from CaO was capable to neutralize acids. While the utilization of CaCO3 did not improve the hydrocarbons content in the bio-oil from the pyrolysis of pure kitchen waste, the addition of SiO2 presented an unfavorable product distribution, and the presence of permutit did not display any obviously admirable selectivity on the final products. Tang et al. (2020a) carried out the co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and rural solid waste with the aid of three kinds of catalysts (HZSM-5, MgO, and CaO) and detected that non-catalytic co-pyrolysis had an inhibitory influence on the bio-oil yield, primarily related to the secondary reaction to form biogas. While the addition of catalysts alleviated the situation, the presence of MgO even reversed the trend and generated positive synergistic effects on the bio-oil yield. As for the HHV, synergistic effects influenced the HHV of bio-oil positively, CaO further enhanced the tendency due to its strong deoxygenation, denitrogenation, and aromatization capacity. Based on the above analysis, CaO showed the best catalytic performance based on the amelioration of bio-oil yield and quality."
8,Catalytic effect of carbon-based catalysts,"4.3 Catalytic effect of carbon-based catalysts Carbon-based catalysts also play critical roles in the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes. Carbon-based catalysts are efficient catalysts owing to the carbonaceous matter and unique surface area, while mineral content (Al2O3, MgO, and Fe2O3) and metal (Na, Mg, K, Al, Ca, and P) can further facilitate its catalytic activity (Gao et al., 2020). Furthermore, carbon-based catalysts such as biochar, SiC, activated carbon, and graphite are widely utilized in microwave-assisted pyrolysis as absorbents with admirable microwave absorptivity. Numerous studies have demonstrated that biochar possesses strong nitrogen fixation ability and deoxidation power. Chen et al. (2018d) pyrolyzed Nannochloropsis sp. and cellulose under the aid of biochar. They ascertained that HCN, NH3, and nitrogenous intermediates had reactions with high active oxygen species, promoted the formation of pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, amine/amide-N, and quaternary-N on the surface of the catalyst, which made the high concentration of nitrogen in the char and the reduction of N-containing gas, amines, and nitriles. Chen et al. (2018c) noticed that the usage of biochar in the co-pyrolysis of bamboo waste and Spirulina platensis had a huge impact on the product distribution, which reduced the bio-oil yield from 52 to 37 wt%, while increasing the biogas yield from 12 to 20 wt%. Simultaneously, the addition of biochar enhanced the content of phenol and long-chain fatty acids and hindered the formation of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds in the bio-oil, rose the bio-oil HHV to 25.10 MJ/kg. Furthermore, other carbon-based additives also exhibited great performance on denitrogenation and deoxygenation. Chen et al. (2019b) reported the carbon-based additives improved the quality of bio-oil by deoxygenation and aromatization through the microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris with wood sawdust. The presence of SiC raised the yield of bio-oil and biochar, while the application of activated carbon increased the biogas yield due to the good absorptive capacity of microwave irradiation. Moreover, both additives had a positive impact on the aromatization and deoxygenation by increasing the content of aliphatic hydrocarbons and phenols in the bio-oil, but denitrogenation was not detected during the co-pyrolysis process. In summary, the addition of CaO and Cu/HZSM-5 exhibits great advantages in previous researches, which can facilitate the formation of aromatics and inhibit the generation of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds. The overall bio-oil quality has been improved effectually because Ca2+ in CaO neutralizes acids. Meanwhile, the pore structure and surface acidity of HZSM-5 possess strong deoxygenation, denitrogenation, and aromatization capabilities, the usage of Cu cuts down the number of strong acid sites of the catalyst. Modified HZSM-5 hinders the formation of coke and ameliorates the activity of catalysts, which can be a prospective research direction for the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other materials. Additionally, some studies have proven the effectiveness of acid and alkali coexist bifunctional catalyst in the reduction of acid content, the inhibition of coke formation, and the growth of bio-oil yield. Yu et al. (2020) utilized coexist bifunctional catalyst based on SBA-15 to conduct the pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and achieved satisfying results. Microalgae possess the drawbacks of high oxygen and ash content. Hence, the acid and alkali coexist bifunctional catalyst can be explored in the microalgae co-pyrolysis. Moreover, the relationship between the product properties and catalysts still requires additional studies, whereas the suitable catalyst for specific microalgae and other biomass wastes needs to be further developed."
9,Economic viability of the co-pyrolysis process,"Many studies have shown the great techno-economic strengths of co-pyrolysis in comparison with sole pyrolysis. The equipment of co-pyrolysis is similar to sole pyrolysis, which shows simplicity in design and operation, but the result is considerably profitable owing to the reduction of feedstocks cost and the improvement of products properties (Ozyuguran et al., 2018). Meyer et al. (2020) conducted the economic and environmental benefits analysis for the conversion of 11 biomass feedstocks to biofuels through fast pyrolysis or co-pyrolysis. The study concluded that capital-related costs (including capital depreciation, return on investment, and income tax) was the maximum cost contributed with 30–40% of the minimum fuel selling price, followed by feedstock cost (30%), hydrotreating catalyst cost (13–18%), and labor cost (12–15%). Woody and herbal mixed raw materials with reasonable product yield, little risk, low raw materials price, and low transportation costs display tremendous advantages over single raw materials. Kuppens et al. (2010) analyzed the profitability of the co-pyrolysis of biopolymers with willow and indicated that co-pyrolysis can obtain better economic benefits in comparison with sole pyrolysis of willow, the net present value of cash flow raised by at least 0.405 MEUR because of the growth of high-value crotonic acid. Zhang et al. (2015) pyrolyzed corn stalk and HDPE in the presence of HZSM-5 and performed an economic assessment. Value index formula was used to analyze the economic potential of aromatic hydrocarbons and found that high content of aromatic hydrocarbons was achieved when the hydrogen to carbon effective ratio of feedstock was more than 1. Co-pyrolysis was superior to sole pyrolysis because of high-quality products and subsequent economic benefits. As for the production of microalgae, the high cost of cultivation and the low production capacity of microalgae are the primary barriers to the commercialization of the microalgae production industry. Many scholars have devoted themselves to the techno-economic assessment of microalgae cultivations and made a substantial number of achievements. Rezvani et al. (2016) took a techno-economic assessment on the microalgae cultivations and concluded that the selling price is between $440–1028/t when photosynthetic efficiency is 4%. Yang et al. (2019) demonstrated that with the rapid development of cultivation technology last decade, the cost of biocrude of microalgae was decreased to approximately $7.50 per gallon, while the low productivity of microalgae was still the main bottleneck. A feasibility and economic analysis of microalgae-based biodiesel production in China was conducted by Sun et al. (2019b). The production cost of microalgae-based biodiesel was calculated as USD 2.29/kg according to the 100 ha of production facilities, which was far more than that of conventional fuel. The main obstacles were the low productivity of microalgae and product benefits. Additionally, Xin et al. (2016) performed a techno-economic analysis of biofuel production from the pyrolysis of wastewater-based algal. Capital, land, operation, chemical coagulation harvesting costs, and reasonable bio-oil yield and revenue were calculated. The estimated break-even selling price of biofuels was USD 2.23 per gallon, which was within an acceptable range. Meanwhile, if breakthroughs could be made in the three key components of cultivation, harvesting, and downstream transformation, this method would obtain better overall benefits and the internal rate of return would raise to 18.7%. Jonker and Faaij (2013) treated microalgae as feedstocks for the production of bioenergy and found the production cost of biofuels was 136 €/GJ for raceway ponds and 153 €/GJ for horizontal tubular systems, which was far more than diesel and gasoline (5–20 €/GJ), even the costs could be reduced by a quarter via possible improvement options during the production process. Nevertheless, co-pyrolysis with low-cost raw materials and co-production of bioenergy and high-value products has not been taken into consideration. The techno-economic assessment for co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes was conducted by Wang et al. (2016) and Chen et al. (2018c). Wang et al. (2016) detected that the inclusion of Isochrysis sp. cut down the energy consumption and facilitated energy efficiency. Co-pyrolysis saved energy costs and improved the energy conversion and stability of sewage sludge pyrolysis. Moreover, Chen et al. (2018c) performed an economic assessment for the mass production of biofuels via the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and bamboo waste. However, co-pyrolysis did not show great advantages, sole pyrolysis of Spirulina platensis earned the most profit of 33.6 million RMB annually, followed by sole pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. with 32.8 million RMB every year, while the third one was the co-pyrolysis of Spirulina platensis and bamboo waste with 31.6 million RMB per year. However, the input and output were only taken into account, while the positive social, economic, and environmental effects owing to the disposal of bamboo waste were not considered in the study. In addition, anther raw materials with low cost would push the co-pyrolysis process forward."
10,Challenges and prospects of the co-pyrolysis process,"As mentioned above, the economic feasibility of microalgae-based biodiesel is still poor due to the high cost of microalgae and low product benefits. However, the cost of microalgae is expected to decline significantly in the foreseeable future with the support of government policies and various capitals. For instance, the Chinese government has initiated many national key research and development projects for microalgae biomass and biofuels to regulate and incentivize the development of the microalgae industry. In 2009, the “Key technologies in CO2 to oil algae to biodiesel” project received 3.2 million US dollars funding from the Chinese government. In 2013, ENN Group got a loan of 46.5 million US dollars from the China Development Bank to scale up the microalgae farm to 280 Hectares in Inner Mongolia (Chen et al., 2020). The U.S. government has launched many microalgae programs to support the target of 17% of transportation fuels in the United States can be replaced by microalgae-based biofuels (Su et al., 2017). Meanwhile, in the background of global warming, carbon neutrality and low-carbon economy are the themes of sustainable development in the world. The microalgae industry is closely linked to the topic and will receive more attention and strong support from governments of all countries. Because the cultivation and utilization of microalgae can bring numerous social, economic, and environmental benefits, like carbon dioxide reduction, wastewater treatment, and environmental improvement, which will gain benefits from variegated policy arbitrations like second-generation biomass, such as tax break, economic support, subsidies for production and infrastructure (Sajjadi et al., 2018). Additionally, many microalgae companies have aroused the attention of commercial capital. For example, Xiaozao Tech in China has completed a round of Series B funding (15.5 million US dollars) in 2021 to expand production scale and increase market share. Therefore, the cost of microalgae will be decreased sharply in the future with the joint endeavors from various parties. In addition, further valorization of microalgae through deep processing is vital to the microalgae industry. Microalgae possess a wide range of applications and enormous economic value. For instance, polysaccharides are used for human nourishment, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and therapeutics. Lipids in the microalgae are applied to neutraceutics, food technology, and medicine. Bioactive compounds are extensively employed in antibiotics, agronomic chemistry, vaccines, and chemicals. Proteins are the raw material for pharmacy vaccines, nutrition, and recombinant protein. Pigments have wide application in fragrance, cosmetics, and medicine (Dasan et al., 2019). Consequently, a biorefinery system is required to realize the valorization of microalgae. Vanthoor-Koopmans et al. (2013) proposed an effective microalgae biorefinery scheme, which adopted pulsed electric field as a cell disruption technique and ionic liquids to separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Gerardo et al. (2014) held a view that membrane filtration was a promising technology and would play a key role in the recovery of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates from microalgae. Furthermore, Banu et al. (2020) proposed three biorefinery routes including biodiesel production, pigments, animal feed, biogas, bio-hydrogen production, and concluded that process integration was conductive to reduce the cost and increase the profit effectively. Nevertheless, present research of conventional or advanced pyrolysis of microalgae is still in the laboratory stage, large-scale production of bioproduct is essential to achieve its industrialization and commercialization. Therefore, the expansion of research is necessitated to complete the industrial production and subsequent market applications of bio-oil from microalgae pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the economic assessment of microalgae pyrolysis on a large scale is also important, because the positive result will absorb capital and talent, thereby stimulating the development of related industries. As the growth, survival, and reproduction organisms in aquatic ecosystems, microalgae possess high moisture content, which is unfavorable to the production of high-quality bio-oil. Accordingly, pretreatment processes, like drying or torrefaction, are imperative to ameliorate the bio-oil quality. However, the implementation of drying or torrefaction will substantially increase the production cost since they are energy-intensive processes. The application of microwave-assisted pyrolysis can combine drying and pyrolysis processes due to the polar nature of water, which will simplify the equipment and reduce the cost. It is reported that the release of water occurs between ambient temperature to 200 °C (Sait & Salema, 2015). Meanwhile, vacuum pyrolysis requires further exploration to increase the bio-oil yield and reduce the production cost, because the condition of negative pressure can cut down the boiling point of bio-oil, thereby promoting the generation of bio-oil. Lam et al. (2019) conducted the co-pyrolysis of plastics with waste oils using inert gas and vacuum pump, then obtained a result that the production cost under vacuum environment was 20.47% less than that under N2 environment. Moreover, it is necessary to achieve excess energy in the final product due to the endothermic characteristics of pyrolysis. Further studies on the selection of cheap and excellent co-feedstocks, development of effective catalysts, and mechanism of synergistic effects behind the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other materials will contribute to accomplishing the goal. As depicted in Fig. 3 , the economic advantages of co-pyrolysis and microalgae biorefinery are supposed to be combined, a comprehensive facility consisted of microalgae cultivation, biorefinery, and biofuels production system will achieve the target. During cultivation, microalgae will absorb CO2 released by vehicles using biofuels, while microalgae will be used as raw materials for the production of biofuels. The carbon cycle based on microalgae conforms to the principle of sustainable development and circular economy. After cultivation, microalgae will be sent into biorefinery systems and downstream industries, the residues will be employed in the co-pyrolysis process to produce biofuels. While biogas can be reused for the pretreatment process to cut down the storage, transportation, and heating cost, bio-oil and biochar are the main products for industry and transportation, biochar can also be utilized in the co-pyrolysis process as a catalyst. The comprehensive facility inherits the advantages of co-pyrolysis and microalgae, which will maximize the value of microalgae and accelerate the speed of commercialization of related industries (van Schalkwyk et al., 2020)."
11,Conclusions,"Co-pyrolysis of microalgae and other biomass wastes is an effective way to produce high-quality biofuels. The positive synergistic effects between various materials and the improvement of the target product have verified the strength and effectiveness of co-pyrolysis. Simultaneously, the addition of catalysts has significantly facilitated the quality of bio-oil by reducing the content of oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds, while increasing the HHV and the content of aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. Meanwhile, a comprehensive facility that inherits the superiorities of co-pyrolysis and microalgae has been proposed to realize the valorization of microalgae and promote the commercialization of related industries."
