0,Introduction,"Foods are generally deteriorated during storage which changes some chemical, physical and biological properties. The major factor of food spoilage is the growth of microorganisms which directly affects the food quality, consumers' acceptance [1–2] and directly generates the food waste [2]. The well-known method of food shelf-life extension is the addition of food preservatives e.g., sorbic acid, sodium sorbate, benzoic acid, benzoates, parabens, propionic acid, propionates, nitrates and many more [3–4] to retard the food spoilages. Although these substances can be removed via urine, but the long period or large quantities of consumptions will be the causes liver and kidney malfunctions [5–6]. In the past, it was believed that the interaction between food and its container or package affected the food quality. However, numerous literatures have revealed that some interactions capable to extend the food shelf-life while maintaining its quality [7–8]. To date, antimicrobial food packaging is a widely known concept on delaying the food deterioration while maintaining nutritional quality and safety especially for the short shelf-life products such as bread, fruit or meat which are usually expired before being sold out and abandoned as food waste. There are various reports related to the application of essential oil to retard the spoilage of baked foods such as cinnamon and clove essential oils [8], citral and eugenol [9–11]. Geraniol, a plant-based essential oil, is naturally occurring as main essential oil constituent in lime, lemongrass and lavender. Geraniol has been previously reported to exert growth-inhibiting activity against various foodborne bacterial and fungal microbes. In addition, it is claimed as generally-recognized-as-safe by Food and Drug Administration because of their high efficiency, safety and non-toxic. Thus, geraniol could be a potential essential oil to apply in food products as a natural antimicrobial agent [12–13]. Many researchers have tried to increase the food shelf-life with antimicrobial packaging as well as antimicrobial sachet prepared from polymer/essential oils blends to avoid the addition of preservatives [9,14]. Essential oils are generally known as oils, naturally produced by plant cells, which can be separated from many parts and species of plants [9–14]. They contain various antibacterial, antiviral, antimycotic, antitoxigenic, antiparasitic and antibiotic compounds which can be effectively incorporated in antimicrobial packaging. Blending PLA films with Mentha piperita and Bunium percicum essential oils showed very satisfy antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas [15]. Campos-Requena et al. [16] extended the shelf-life of strawberries with polymer/essential oil package. It was found that the antimicrobial package could extend the life of strawberry by about two times compared to the strawberry stored in the conventional package. Although numerous literatures had shown the successful of food shelf-life extension of the antimicrobial packages but some problems still exist. The release of essential oils occurs over both inside and outside of the package which reduces antimicrobial efficiency. Moreover, the strong odor of some types of essential oils interfere other products placed nearby [17]. Therefore, this research aims to develop a food shelf-life extension sachet with the controlled release of antimicrobial agent function. This sachet dimension was around 5.0 cm in length and 3.0 cm in width, which easily inserts in any food container. The structure of the microbial sachet consists of two parts. The outside materials were responsible to manipulate the release of anti-microbial agents from the active pellets packed inside. This controlled release part was produced from paper coated with ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH). In this part, a suitable coating thickness of EVOH was determined by investigating the barrier properties under wet and dry conditions. The inside materials produced from poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and geraniol blend. A suitable PBS/geraniol composition was determined, produced and packed in the coated paper. Further investigation on the antimicrobial performance, mass transfer estimation and bread shelf-life extension were also done to fulfill this work."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials,"2.1 Raw materials For the controlled release part production, an eighty grammage wood-free paper (Double A (1991) Co., Ltd., Thailand) with a dimension of 100 × 50 mm, was used as a main structural material. A high barrier grade EVOH (L171B) with 27 mol% of ethylene was produced and kindly donated by Kuraray Co., Ltd., Japan. It has a density of 1.21 g/cm3 and a melting point of 190 °C. Its oxygen transmission rate was 0.1 (cm3 × 20 μm)/(m2 × day × atm). The superior property of EVOH is generally known to have extremely low permeability at low relative humidity (RH). However, at high moisture condition, it allows the gases to permeate easily. Thus, the use of EVOH as a controlled release part is suitable for bread products which slowly releases moisture during storage and directly activates the release of antimicrobial agent. A 99.9% 1-propanol (C₃H₈O) was used as solvent for EVOH. It has a density at room temperature and boiling point of 0.804 g/cm3 and 97 °C respectively. The active part of the antimicrobial sachet was produced from PBS/geraniol blend. PBS (BioPBS™ FZ91PM) was produced by PTT MCC Biochem Co., Ltd., Thailand. It has a density of 1.23 g/cm3. Its melting point was 112–116 °C. Geraniol essential oil (C10H18O) was supplied by TCI Chemicals (India) Pvt. Ltd. It has a boiling point of 230 °C which suitable for the melt-compounding with PBS. A commercial white bread was selected to represent a short shelf-life food. It was purchased from a contracted seller which exactly known manufacturing date and ingredients."
3,Coating paper with EVOH,"2.2 Coating paper with EVOH The paper coating procedure composed of three steps. In the first step, propanol and distilled water were mixed together at the ratio of 1:1 to make the stock solution. Then, 20 g of EVOH was blended and stirred in stock solution at 150 °C for 5 h to obtain EVOH solution with the concentration of 10 wt%. In the second step, the wood-free paper was immersed into the EVOH solution with a dip-coating method for 1 min and let it dry in a desiccator at room temperature. In this part, the suitable coating time was determined by varying the dip-coating from 1 to 7 times. Further thickness control of each coating was measured using a digital micrometer with the allowable deviation of ±1.0%. To select a suitable coating thickness of EVOH, a water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) tester was employed to determine the gas permeability. The test was done at the RH values of 5 and 90% to simulate a dry and wet condition respectively. Then an optimization of dip-coating time versus WVTR was selected for producing the controlled release part of antimicrobial sachet. The final step was the heat-sealing of the coated paper together with the PBS/geraniol active part inside as shown in Fig. 1 . Evaluations of the performance of antimicrobial sachet were performed on white bread slice. The release of antimicrobial agent was directedly correlated to the moisture content, liberated from bread, in the package."
4,Preparation of PBS/geraniol active part,"2.3 Preparation of PBS/geraniol active part In this part, PBS was firtsly mixed with various concentrations of geraniol at 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% using a mixer (Thermo Scientific, PRISM Pilot 3). After that, they were melt-blended using a twin-screw extruder (Chareon tut, CTE-D16L32, Thailand). The screw speed rate was 80–100 rpm and residence time was 30 to 45 s. The temperature profile in a barrel from zone 1 to 5 was 110, 115, 120, 125 and 125 °C respectively. The PBS/geraniol blended compositions were then pelletized to obtain the antimicrobial pellets of around 2.0 × 2.0 mm in dimension. To select a suitable PBS/geraniol formulation for antimicrobial sachet production, each blend composition was evaluated by measuring the inhibition zone diameter against foodborne pathogens namely; Bacillus cereus (gram positive) and Escherichia coli (gram negative)."
5,Testing and characterizations,"2.4 Testing and characterizations 2.4.1 Barrier property of the coated paper A WVTR tester (Mocon Perma Tran-W® 3/34G) was employed to optimize the paper coating times versus moisture transmission rate. The test was performed on the paper coated with EVOH from 1 to 7 times. Measurement was carried out following the procedure in ASTM F1249, at 37.8 °C. The test was operated at 5 and 90% RH respectively to simulate the storage of bread under dry and humid condition with a mass flow rate of 100 ml/min. 2.4.2 Optical microscopy of the coated paper An optical microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 50i) was employed to observe the surface and cross-sectional morphology of neat and coated paper and some changes of the coated paper under dry and humid conditions. 2.4.3 Antimicrobial activity of PBS/geraniol blends The inhibition clear zone diameter was measured after the PBS/geraniol pellets were put on agar surface at 37 °C. They had been incubated for 24 h using agar diffusion assays following the methods described in our previous research [6]. 2.4.4 Vapor phase antimicrobial activity of sachet Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were selected to represent the pathogenic bacteria which easily transfer from human to food via bread production process. They were cultured on separate Nutrient Agar (NA) (HiMedia, India) plates by spread plate technique. After that, these plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by applying a single scoop of loop and transferring the cells into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.85% (w/v) normal saline solution that was previously autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min. Optical density (OD) of the bacterial cells was measured using a visible spectrophotometer (Unico, UV 2100) at 600 nm. A normal saline solution was used as a blank. The OD of each bacterial strain was adjusted to 0.1 for preparing a serial dilution from 10−1 to 10−4. An aliquot of 100 μl of 10−1 to 10−4 dilution of each bacterial strain was transferred onto Plate Count Agar (PCA) (HiMedia, India). The culture dilution was spread on the plate using glass beads. This plate was employed to test the antimicrobial property of the antimicrobial sachet against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial sachet was attached to inner side of the plate lid by using 3 M tape and was allowed to release vapor phase inside the plate. All plates were sealed the rim by Parafilm tape before incubating at 37 °C for 3 days. The control was PCA with bacterial culture but without the sachet. The phase antimicrobial test was done in triplicate. 2.4.5 Release of geraniol The release of geraniol from PBS pellets through the coated paper had been quantitatively evaluated from the headspace of bread package for 9 weeks of storage. The test was conducted at room temperature using a gas chromatography (GC, Nexis model GC-2030) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The sample of 2 ml was injected to the GC column with a 10 ml syringe. The optimal operating conditions for the best elution profile and spaced peaks were achieved with oven temperature operated at 10 °C/min from 80 °C to 230 °C. The carrier gas was helium which was operated at a volumetric flow rate of 32 ml/min. The temperatures of the injector and the detector were set at 230 °C. The individual standard solutions of geraniol (98%) were made by dissolving 1 ml of each compound in 100 ml ethanol. The release kinetics of geraniol from antimicrobial sachet and some mass transfer parameters were estimated following the Fick's law of diffusion as shown in Eqs. (1)–(4). The primary assumptions for these equations are i) the release is controlled by Fickian diffusion theory, ii) the geraniol volatiles mass transfer through the EVOH coated paper is a one-directional transfer, perpendicular to the coated paper surface, iii) the initial concentration of geraniol is zero, iv) no interaction between PBS, geraniol and coated paper and v) no degradation of raw materials during the test period and vi) the temperature, geraniol diffusivity and moisture diffusivity are assumed to be constant and homogeneously dispersed in the bread package and antimicrobial sachet headspace. No variation of the headspace volume was considered in both antimicrobial sachet and bread package. Moreover, geraniol content in the antimicrobial sachet was split into two quantities: the one that was encapsulated in PBS matrix, and another one was released and dispersed in the sachet headspace as shown in Fig. 2 . The diffusion coefficient (D, m2/s) of geraniol could be estimated by using Eqs. (1)–(7) [6,18]. (1) M F , t M F , ∞ = 1 − ∑ n = 1 ∞ 2 α 1 + α 1 + α + α 2 q n 2 exp − D q n 2 t L p 2 (2) α = K FP V F V P (3) K FP = C F , ∞ C P , ∞ (4) tan q n = − α q n where MF,t and MF,∞ are the mass of the head space released geraniol at a particular time t and at equilibrium respectively. MF,∞ can be supposed to be equal to MP,0. LP is thickness of the coated paper. KFP is the partition coefficient which can be estimated by using Eq. (3). CF,∞ and CP,∞ are the concentrations of geraniol in the head space of bread package and at equilibrium respectively. VF and VP are the volumes of the active pellets and bread package respectively. qn is the positive roots of tan qn which can be determined by using Eq. (5). The determination was done by plotting f(qn) = tan qn + αqn as a function of qn and then observing the points where f(qn) become zero. However, Chung et al. [18] was simplified and proposed a modified Eq. (1) and the D value can be obtained from Eq. (5). (5) 1 π − 1 α · M F , t M P , 0 0.5 = − D 0.5 α · L P · t 0.5 + 1 π 0.5 where MP,0 is the initial amount of migrant in the bread package. However, partitioning and resistance to mass transfer are negligible in case the complete migration. MF,∞ is equal to MP,0. If MF,t/MP,0 ratio is lower than 0.6, Eq. (5) can be simply modified to Eqs. (6)–(7), applied for short and long contact times respectively.

The test had been performed on the white bread slice samples for 9 weeks of storage. Total plate count of microorganisms (PCA medium, 30 °C) and yeasts and molds count (Yeast Glucose Chloramphenicol medium, 25 °C) were determined following FDA-BAM Chapters 3 and 18. A digital hygrometer was employed to monitor RH in the bread package during storage. The cutting force of bread slices stored with and without antimicrobial sachet was evaluated by using a Texture Analyzer (Stable Micro System, TA.XTplusC). The cutting blade was pressed into test samples with the cross-head speed of 50 mm/min. The experiment performed on five replications for each sample teased. 2.4.7 Statistical analysis The antimicrobial activities of PBS/geraniol blends and antimicrobial sachet values were obtained from the average of three replicated samples. Further data analysis was made using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the statistical significance at P ≤ 0.05."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Properties of the coated paper,"3.1 Properties of the coated paper 3.1.1 Optical micrograph Surface and cross-sectional micrograph of the EVOH coated paper is clearly illustrated in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3(a) shows the surface of the interlaced fibers of paper. Coating paper with EVOH (Fig. 3(b)) showed the rougher surface and tiny voids. The cross section of neat paper shown in Fig. 3(c) indicated a firm and compact of paper without structural defect. For the coated paper in Fig. 3(d), no visible phase-separation occurred between the two layers. This confirmed a good interfacial bonding between paper and EVOH. 3.1.2 Effect of paper coating thickness and RH on WVTR To obtain a suitable EVOH coating time, WVTR test was done at 5 and 90% RH to simulate the dry and humid conditions respectively (Fig. 4 ). At a humid condition, WVTR of the coated paper was found to drastically decrease with the coating from 1 to 3 times. This inversely correlated to the coating thickness as enclosed in Fig. 4. This could be anticipated that coating paper with EVOH by three times is suitable for the use as a release-controlled part in antimicrobial sachet. At dry condition (5% RH), there was no remarkable difference between the coating time and WVTR values. Further microscopic investigation of the coated paper for dry and humid conditions is clearly illustrated in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5(a) shows a smooth surface of the EVOH coated paper at dry condition. Under humid condition, it seemed rougher with small spots related to the swelling of EVOH (Fig. 5(b)). Normally, the permeation properties of EVOH are greatly influenced by RH and temperature. EVOH chemical structure composes of ethylene and vinyl alcohol units. Vinyl alcohol unit is related to gas barrier resistances but it has poor water resistance and difficult to be processed with general polymer processing. Ethylene unit show great water resistance but poor gas permeation resistance. Combination of these units generates thermoplastic copolymer with good processability and excellent barrier properties under dry condition only. Its sensitivity to moisture still exists [19–21] and limits the use of EVOH in humid environment. This is due to the fact that, at low RH, water molecules populate in the free volume between EVOH chains. With RH increment, these water molecules behave like plasticizer which directly reduce the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between EVOH chains. This increases the chain mobility and free volume due to swelling of the polymer thus reducing the barrier properties of EVOH [19,21]."
8,Antimicrobial activity of PBS/geraniol blends,"3.2 Antimicrobial activity of PBS/geraniol blends The antimicrobial activity of PBS/geraniol active part was evaluated using agar diffusion method as shown in Fig. 6 and their estimated values are clearly indicated in Table 1 . PBS/geraniol pellets were found to produced various inhibition clear zones ranging from around 5 to 15 mm. At 5 wt%, geraniol did not show any antimicrobial effect on both selected bacteria. However, it showed the inhibition clear zone against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli at 10 wt%. It was found to less effective against Escherichia coli with lower inhibition clear zone compared with that observed in Bacillus cereus. This is possibly due to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli (gram-negative) acts as a barrier and preventing itself from geraniol [22–23]. Thus, the addition of 10 wt% geraniol is a suitable concentration for the use as an active part in an antimicrobial sachet."
9,Properties of antimicrobial sachet,"3.3 Properties of antimicrobial sachet 3.3.1 Vapor phase antimicrobial activity of sachet Generally, the antimicrobial mechanism of sachet containing essential oil normally liberates vapors to inhibit the bacterial growth. Thus, an investigation of the antimicrobial performance of sachet was performed in vapor phase with various concentrations of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus of 10− 1, 10−2 and 10−4 and compared with that of control samples. Figs. 7 and 8 show the inhibition clear zone of an antimicrobial sachet and the corresponding inhibition clear zone and bacterial counts are listed in Table 2 . Antimicrobial sachet showed the inhibition zone diameter on both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli for all concentrations around 3–4 cm. Further bacterial colony count indicated a significant reduction of colony at concentration of 10−4. For other concentrations, the colonies were uncountable. In comparison, antimicrobial sachet seemed to have more effective on Staphylococcus aureus than that observe in Escherichia coli. However, statistical data showed that there were no significant difference at P ≤ 0.05. 3.3.2 Release of geraniol form the antimicrobial sachet Fig. 9(a) shows headspace release, obtained from the peak area, of antimicrobial sachet from 0 to 9 weeks of storage at room temperature. Overall, the increase of the amount of geraniol released from sachet was observed with storage time of the bread slice samples. A rapid release of geraniol was observed from 0 to 20 days and reached an equilibrium around day 40. The release of geraniol was found in accord with the liberated moisture from bread slice stored in LDPE bags shown in Fig. 9(b). The RH value of bread sliced was found to increase with the storage time and reached equilibrium at around 40 days aswell. This was mainly due to the contribution of the release-controlled part produced from EVOH coated paper as discussed above. In comparison, the migration of geraniol from sachet in this research seems to reach an equilibrium plateau slower than those observed in the other literatures. This was due to the complexicity of mass release from PBS/geraniol pellets through the coated paper envelope. Release of cinnamaldehyde from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based film reached an equilibrium state by around 7 days [24]. In hexane, the release of allyl isothiocyanate from cellulose-based film was found to reach the equilibrium plateau by around 2 days [25]. For PBS/geraniol porous antimicrobial plate, it required 20 days to reach the equilibrium plateau [22]. 3.3.3 Shelf-life extension of white bread Table 3 show the shelf-life of white bread stored with and without antimicrobial sachet and their representative pictures were illustrated in Fig. 10 . Without antimicrobial sachet, white bread slice was found to be spoiled earlier with the total plate count and yeast and mold count of 11,000 cfu/g (day 14) and 130 cfu/g (day 21) respectively. With antimicrobial sachet, the spoilage occurred at day 42. As shown in Fig. 10, it was found a band of fungus on the white bread after it had been stored for three weeks or one week after its expired date. Moreover, no fungus found on the white bread surface stored with antimicrobial sachet for all 63 days of test duration. These caused by the antimicrobial mechanism of geraniol which controlled by the coated paper. With this controlled release technique, geraniol essential oil molecules were entrapped within a PBS matrix and EVOH coated paper envelope and it was allowed to prolong-release with the increased moisture from bread as previously shown in Fig. 2. Other literatures had also indicated the shelf-life extension of bread with controlled release of antimicrobial agents. Active packaging produced from chitosan-carboxymethyl cellulose-oleic acid/zinc oxide films indicated an increase of shelf-life of sliced wheat bread from 3 to 35 days compare with the control sample [26]. Upasen and Wattanachai [27] prolonged the shelf-life of preservative-free white bread by 5–7 days with an oxygen absorber sachet. The optimized formulation of the active bag contained EVOH coated LDPE and garlic extract indicated the mold development in loaf bread was delayed from 6 to 12 days [28]. Cinnamon and clove essential oils were also found to effectively inhibit the mold growth on baked products. It was found that cinnamon could prolong the shelf-life of green bean cake for around 9–10 days while clove oil did at around 3–4 days. Further investigation of a vacuum package was found to extend the shelf-life by more than two times [8]. With eugenol and citral essential oils antimicrobial sachet, the shelf life of bread stored in LDPE, PP and HDPE packages, increased from 5 to 13, 13 and 15 days respectively [29]. Further evaluation on the mass transfer kinetics and diffusion coefficient from the release test data is clearly shown in Fig. 11 . The fractional release or MF,t/MP,0 versus time was plotted following the parameters described in Eq. (6) and then the D value was obtained as slope. The migration experimental data are in good agreement with proposed model prediction which suggested that the release of geraniol from sachet behaved following the Fick's law of diffusion. In this case, the release-controlled antimicrobial sachet can be separated into 4 major mechanisms. The first one started from the plasticization EVOH molecules under the increased moisture then allow molecules to penetrate through the coated paper layers. Simultaneously, geraniol molecules migrated to PBS pellets surface. The migrated geraniol molecules were then completely liberated inside the sachet. Finally, the swelled coated paper allows geraniol to release out of antimicrobial sachet and perform their antimicrobial activities as previously shown in Fig. 2. Further diffusivity calculation indicated that the D value was 3.18 × 10−14 m2/s. In comparison, the diffusivity of the thymol from PBS film was found 1.31 × 10−15 m2/s [6] while linalool and methylchavicol showed the D value of 2.46 × 10−12 and 1.10 × 10−12 m2/s respectively [30]. 3.3.4 Cutting force of bread Fig. 12 illustrates some changes in the cutting hardness of the white bread stored with and without antimicrobial sachet. Results indicated that the hardness was slightly enhanced with the storage period from 1 to 5 weeks. This was due to the loss of water molecules during storage which previously discussed. After this period, the hardness tended to reduce but only slightly. In comparison, the hardness values for white bread packaged with antimicrobial sachet were found to insignificantly larger than that of control samples. From the consumer point of view, numerous papers had further reported the sensory evaluation and consumer acceptance of the antimicrobial sachets and packages. Ju et al. [29] indicated that the use of eugenol and citral antimicrobial sachets in bread package had no significant effects on bread smell or taste. Moreover, the antimicrobial sachet showed the great potential in term of commercialization storage conditions [10]. Coating bread package with garlic essential oil did not show any unacceptable scent and taste [32]."
10,Conclusions,"A controlled release antimicrobial sachet produced from EVOH coated paper and PBS/geraniol blend was successfully produced in this research. Prior producing an antimicrobial sachet, the optimizations of the coating thickness and geraniol content were investigated. Antimicrobial activity investigation performed on gram positive and gram negative bacteria indicated that the suitable geraniol concentration for blending in PBS was 10 wt%. WVTR study informed that the WVTR was reduced with increasing coating thickness. Three times coating on paper was found to be an optimal condition. Release test by GC indicated that geraniol migration concentration was increased with increasing the RH in the package which correlated to the moisture liberated from bread. Shelf-life extension study informed that the spoilage of bread stored with antimicrobial sachet was delayed by more than three weeks while maintaining the textural hardness. In summary, this antimicrobial sachet could be used as a food shelf-life extension materials which easily placed in any food container. This is an alternative way of food waste minimization."
