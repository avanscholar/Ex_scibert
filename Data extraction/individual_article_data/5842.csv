0,Introduction,"The important chemical – ethylene glycol (EG), is widely used in polyester manufactures or antifreeze, etc. [1] Given on the dwindling crude oil resources, EG production via the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) from syngas becomes more attractive because of the urgent requirement of making clean utilization of coal [2]. However, the process is dramatically limited by the inefficiency of catalyst used. Generally speaking, noble metal catalysts have higher catalytic activity for hydrogenation reaction [3]. For example, Au–Ag bimetallic nanoparticles supported on SBA-15 was fabricated and showed excellent performance in DMO hydrogenation [4]. However, the wide application of noble metal catalysts in DMO hydrogenation are limited because of their high cost, poor stability, and strong ability of hydrogen dissociation and C–C bond breaking, which resulting in a wider distribution of products. Hence, the novel catalytic systems with transition metal Co or Ni as active components were designed by Chen [5] and Zhu [6], which achieved some results in oxalates hydrogenation. Due to the high activity, low cost, and toxicity, copper-based catalysts have been explored widely for the selective hydrogenation of carbon–oxygen bonds while avoiding the hydrogenolysis of carbon–carbon bonds [7,8]. In order to explore an alternative catalyst of the preferred industrial Cu–Cr catalyst for DMO hydrogenation which could endanger the safety of the environment and the workers, numerous studies have been focused on Cu/SiO2 catalysts mainly due to the moderate acidic and basic properties of SiO2 which could effectively avoid the formation of by-products. Moreover, the higher specific surface area and larger pore volume could afford the high dispersion of Cu species. Unfortunately, the inherent poor stability and short lifetime of silica-supported copper catalysts resulted by the erosion of the silica support or the aggregation of the copper particles are still unsolved because of the weak interaction between Cu species and SiO2 [9,10]. Accordingly, considerable effort has focused on modifying the Cu/SiO2 catalyst such as the addition of a second species (B, Ag, or Au) [11–13], use of different silica structures for support [14–18], or adoption of different preparation methods [19–21]. Besides, some other single or binary supports (ZnO, Al2O3, MgO, TiO2 La2O3, hydroxyapatite, or activated carbon) were also extensively studied [22–24]. In these cases, the surface acidic and basic properties or complicated sites would induce some side reactions and deteriorate the selectivity, furthermore, limit its large-scale application. Especially, ZrO2-supported Cu catalyst is investigated intensively for traditional hydrogenation reactions because of the strong metal–support interaction [25,26]. What is more, the Cu–ZrO2 interface is believed to play a vital role in many cases owing to its distinguished atomic arrangement, charge state, and so on [27]. Although the synergetic effect arising from the Cu–ZrO2 interface can trigger some enhanced properties or improved performances such as promoting the adsorption or activation of carbonyls and facilitating the reactions of O-containing intermediates, the structural differences of Cu/ZrO2 catalyst can affect the accessibility of the active phase [28]; therefore, rational design of the catalyst morphology are extremely important. Generally, the lamellar structure can make large impacts on the catalytic activity, e.g., tuning the hydrogenation activity greatly. This has motivated large activity toward layer stripping or changing the layer thickness. Subsequently, a variety of delamination methods have been developed, such as protonation exfoliation [29], sonication exfoliation, and steam reforming strategy [30]. Most importantly, the delamination of bulk materials to several layers induced exotic physicochemical properties. Especially, Cu/ZrO2 catalyst with thin, layered nanoarchitectures is beneficial to molecular diffusion and moreover, facilitates exposure of the Cu species and Cu–ZrO2 interface [31,32], where hydrogenation of CO/CO have often occurred [25,33–35]. Thus, achieving higher turnover frequency (TOF) will become much more feasible over layered Cu/ZrO2 catalysts through the exfoliation. However, the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by traditional methods usually display the macro-state as balls, lumps, pellets, and so on. Furthermore, a limited number of effective “exfoliation” of Cu/ZrO2 to layers have been addressed. Here, a versatile one-pot acetic complex process which was previously demonstrated as an effective strategy to fabricate Cu/ZrO2 catalysts with layered morphology by varying Cu content was developed [32]. The one with 50 wt% of Cu content shows distinct layer-structure and copper species uniformly combining with well-crystallized ZrO2, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity (134.1 h−1 TOF) and stability (>200 h at 220 °C) in hydrogenation of DMO to EG."
1,Experimental,"The Cu/ZrO2 catalysts with different copper content prepared by a one-pot acetic complex method was referred to as wCZ, where w was the theoretical Cu content corresponding to 10, 20, 32, 40, 50, and 58 wt%. The acetic complex method used here was the same process reported in our previous articles [32]. As comparison, the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst with the Cu loading of 15 wt% (15CZim) was obtained by the incipient wetness impregnation employing an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and ZrO2 prepared by the acetic complex method. Catalytic tests for the hydrogenation of DMO were performed in a fix-bed reactor. The feed components and the products were analysed by online gas chromatographs. The catalysts were characterized by N2-adsorption, XRD, SEM, EDS, HRTEM, and H2-TPR. For details, see the Supplementary material."
2,Results and discussions,"Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of wCZ are shown in Fig. S1a. All of them were type II and the hysteresis loop were H3 type according to the IUPAC classification [36], inferring that there were only a few slit-slapped pore channels formed except of 10CZ and 20CZ. Besides, the closure points of hysteresis loops occurred at a relative pressure of ca. 0.42, suggesting that they had similar pore architecture (Fig. S1b). For the 10CZ and 20CZ, the H3 type of hysteresis loop was rather small, indicating that there did not form the layered structure distinctly. As can be seen in Table 1 , all of the wCZ and 15CZim possessed the similar smaller BET surface area (SBET < 12.7 m2/gcat −1) and pore volume (Vpore < 0.027 m3/gcat) with the slightly enlarged average pore size (dpore). Correspondingly, the dispersion of Cu species (DCu) for wCZ was low and gradually decreased from 9.4% to 4.2% with increase of copper content. This could be attributed to the increased CuO crystallites as well as the poor porosity [14]. However, the increase in Cu content led to an increase of the specific active Cu surface area (SCu) including Cu species and Cu–ZrO2 interface from 6.4 (10CZ) to 21.6 m2/gcat (50CZ) then to a decrease again (58CZ) [37]. Interestingly, the DCu of 15CZim were increased to 14.2% due to the employment of impregnation process, while held a lower SCu compared to that of wCZ with higher Cu content. The exfoliating of Cu/ZrO2 catalysts into lamellar structure via increase of the Cu content can be directly observed in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that a few pallets piled up in 10CZ with the average thickness being >2000 nm. For 20CZ, exfoliating of bulk Cu/ZrO2 catalysts happened to some extent but not completely. With the further increase of Cu content, well-developed lamellar structure could be identified and the thickness of layers became thinner, which was consisted with the results detected in N2-adsorption (Fig. S1). Significantly, both of 40CZ and 50CZ showed distinct layered morphology with the thickness of ca. 100 nm which was also confirmed by the HRTEM image of 50CZ (Fig. S2a), indicating that the lamellar structure fully formed owed to the insertion of Cu species. In addition, EDS elemental mapping analysis provided evidence for the nanoscale mixing and closely interacting of Cu species and crystalline ZrO2, since the measured values in Cu/ZrO2 surface were close to the bulk compositions (Table S2). As a result, Cu–ZrO2 interface effectively formed and afforded substantial active sites except of Cu species for DMO hydrogenation [26,32]. However, the Cu species sintered seriously when the content was further increased to 58%, resulting in adhesion of the layers and deterioration of the layered structure (Fig. 1). To be honest, the evidence given in Table 1 based on N2-adsorption was inconsistent with what the SEM images had indicated. As a matter of fact, the SBET of all samples kept at a lower value, which was probably due to the lower pore volume and porosity. Most importantly, although the extent of delamination increased with increase of Cu content from 32% to 50%, the collapse of pores or Cu species expanding the pores appeared in large numbers, which led to the decrease of pore volume and the increase of pore sizes. As a result, the decrease of SBET caused by the decrease of inner wall of the pores was more effective than the increase of SBET caused by delamination. It was reasonable that 50CZ showed the smallest SBET because of the smaller pore volume and the larger pore sizes. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the calcined Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, in which the peaks at 2θ of around 35.6° and 38.7° denote crystalline CuO phase with tenorite structure (JCPDS 48–1548). For 10CZ and 15CZim, there was no indication for the presence of crystalline CuO phase. This meant that the CuO was amorphous or the size was beyond the detection capacity of the XRD technique (<3 nm) [38]. As the Cu content increased, the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited characteristic CuO peaks which intensity gradually increased and finally achieved maximum (58CZ). Correspondingly, the CuO crystallite sizes of the 20CZ, 32CZ, 40CZ, 50CZ, and 58CZ were 9.1, 14.5, 15.8, 16.8, and 20.3 nm, respectively (Table 1). The strong diffraction peaks of ZrO2 dominated all of the catalysts. For 10CZ, 20CZ, 32CZ, 40CZ, and 50CZ, the crystallinity of ZrO2 was supported by sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30.3, 35.2, 50.6 and 60.2°, which corresponded to tetragonal structure (JCPDS 50-1089). Apart from this, monoclinic ZrO2 appeared (JCPDS 37-1484) and the diffraction peaks intensified for 58CZ. Generally, the transformation of t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2 was greatly retarded because of the vacancies introduced by the incorporation of a few Cu2+ ions [39]. However, m-ZrO2 appeared and increased when Cu content was increased from 32% to 58%, indicating the numerous Cu2+ ions here could cause the transformation of t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2 for Cu/ZrO2 catalysts even using the lower calcination temperature. As shown in TPR spectrum (Fig. 2b), the first little peak indicated that the surface Cu species was easy to be reduced when the content was low (such as 10CZ, 20CZ, and 15CZim). However, it was difficult for H2 to diffuse into the bulk and contact fully with Cu species here because of the larger thickness and the lower porosity of 10CZ and 20CZ (Table 1). Thus, it made the reduction more difficult, which can be inferred by the broad reduction peaks with the large temperature span (from 145 to 390 °C). Along with the increase of Cu content, the higher-temperature TPR peak shifted to lower temperatures accompanied by intensity increasing. Take 50CZ as example, the narrow symmetric peak with a maximum at ca. 214 °C can be attributed to a single reduction step. It was strange that the reducing temperature in the TPR profiles could be used to reflect the size and dispersion of Cu [14,40]. In simpler terms, the smaller particle size of Cu species and/or higher Cu dispersion, the easier reduction of CuO was. While XRD patterns showed a gradually increased particle sizes and N2O titration reflected the decreased dispersion with Cu content increase. The seemingly contradictory phenomenon showed the easy reduction of Cu species since the bulk materials were stripped into more Cu/ZrO2 layers with increased SCu, which strengthen the contact of H2 with Cu species. However, higher level of Cu content (58CZ) resulted in the adhesion of layers and metal aggregation. Thus, the reduction temperature increased significantly and the peak shifted to right. Furthermore, the calculated reduction degree (RCu) of 10CZ was only 61.1%, while gradually increased to 62.1%, 81.8%, 86.3%, and 92.2% for 20CZ, 32CZ, 40CZ, and 50CZ (Table 1). Obviously, the reduction of Cu species became easy with the increase of layers and the decrease of thickness as can be seen in Fig. 1. Especially, the RCu of 50CZ was maximum, which clearly showed that the Cu species in 50CZ was more easily reduced than other catalysts as a result of more thin layers formed. However, it should be noted that the RCu remarkably decreased to 77.4% with increasing Cu content to 58%. It further reflected the decreased contacting of Cu species and H2, which seriously affected by the deterioration of lamellar structure. The 15CZim showed a higher RCu (82.4%) comparing to that of both the 10CZ and 20CZ since a large number of Cu species were highly dispersed on the ZrO2 surface only, avoiding the limitation of H2 diffusion [41]. As can be seen in Fig. 3a (WLHSV = 0.5 h−1), the conversion of DMO over 10CZ was only 25.8% with ethanol as the main product. Interestingly, the conversion increased to 72.1%, 96.7%, 98.5%, and 100.0% for 20CZ, 32CZ, 40CZ, and 50CZ, respectively. Correspondingly, the EG selectivity increased to 30.7%, 90.6%, 91.1%, and 94.5%, respectively. As comparison, the conversion of DMO and the EG selectivity of 15CZim was 81.2% and 43.3%, respectively. Moreover, when WLHSV was increased to 1.0 h−1, the DMO conversion and EG selectivity of wCZ also showed a gradual improvement (Fig. S3). For example, the 10CZ showed the conversion of DMO were <32% without EG production, while it increased to 54% and 16% over 20CZ. The 50CZ realized superior selectivity to EG (>96%) based on 99% conversion of DMO and was stable on stream for 96 h. However, both the conversion and selectivity of 58CZ decreased dramatically regardless of WLHSV at 0.5 or 1.0 h−1. Thus, too low or high content of Cu resulted in a decrease in EG yield, while the 50 wt% Cu content was the most suitable one. Actually, TOF of 10CZ, 20CZ, 32CZ, 40CZ, 50CZ, 58CZ, and 15CZim were 39.8, 74.9, 83.6, 89.1, 134.1, 80.1 and 18.2 h−1, respectively (Table 1). It was remarkable that the value of 50CZ was the maximum in wCZ and was higher than 15CZim or other Cu-based catalysts summurized in Table S1. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of the 50CZ as a function of WLHSV are evaluated (Fig. 3b). At WLHSV = 0.8 h−1, the DMO conversion was 100% and the selectivity of EG was 95.7%. Then the DMO conversion decreased with increasing WLHSV while the selectivity to EG being kept at a high level below WLHSV of 4.0 h−1. Especially, the selectivity of EG reached a maximum of 97.7% when the DMO conversion decreased slightly to 98.4% at WLHSV of 1.5 h−1. Further increasing WLHSV from 4.0 to 10.0 h−1 led to a sharp decrease of the selectivity to EG (Fig. 3b). Nonetheless, the catalyst retained excellent catalytic performance such as DMO conversion of 84.6%, EG selectivity of 46.7%, and the maximum STY to EG of 2.1 gEG (gcat h)−1 even at the rather high WLHSV of 10.0 h−1, clearly reflecting its superiority to other Cu-based catalyst (Table S1) and great potential for industrial application as a highly efficient catalyst for DMO hydrogenation. Frankly, the nonlinear growth in correlations of Cu content and catalytic activity suggested that the accessibility of active sites including Cu species or Cu–ZrO2 interface varied greatly due to the structural change [14,32,42]. In this case, as Cu content increased, the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts especially 50CZ were exfoliated into more thin layers with strengthened surface properties (Fig. 2), where exposing more surface active sites such as Cu0/Cu+ and Cu–ZrO2 interface to DMO/H2 molecules, and then the formed EG diffusing out successfully [19]. As known to all, metallic copper was supposed to be active sites for the hydrogenation of esters to alcohols since the catalytic activity was frequently found to be proportional to SCu [43–46]. As a result, the increase in Cu0 surface area was assumed to be partially responsible for the improvement of hydrogenation activity. However, both Cu0 and Cu+ species were crucial to the activity of copper-based catalysts which was principally attributed to a blurry cooperative effect between Cu0 and Cu+ species with a few illumination of structural nature of active sites [12,19]. Here, the dissociatively adsorbed H over Cu0 sites reacted with the methoxy and the acyl species which were stabilized by the Cu+ sites. Furthermore, the CO bond of ester group in DMO may be polarized via the electron lone pair on oxygen by Cu+ sites, which functioned as electrophilic or Lewis acid sites and thus promoted the hydrogenation of DMO. Besides, the interface is believed to play a vital role in hydrogenation reactions owing to its distinguished atomic arrangement and charge state for heterostructures [27]. For example, not only the highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles but also Cu–SiO2 interface provided the active sites for EG production from DMO as evidenced on Cu/SiO2 catalysts [14,17]. Similarly, it suggested the diversity of active sites besides Cu on Cu/ZrO2 catalyst [25]. As exhibited in HRTEM image of 50CZ catalyst (Fig. S2b), the synergetic effect derived from the Cu–ZrO2 interface can possibly endow the composite materials with much improved catalytic properties and stability [47]. In other words, the crystalline ZrO2 promoted the activation of adsorbed carbonyls and facilitated the reactions between O-containing intermediates and nearby highly active H atoms dissociated by Cu sites [25,32,48]. In the light of the promotion effect of synergistic effect and minimized transport distance, the excellent performance of 50CZ might be also partially attributed to the increased amount of Cu–ZrO2 interface. In the case of 58CZ, which showed a decrease in SCu and catalytic activity comparing to that of 50CZ, the layered structure was destroyed due to sintering or adhesion (Fig. 1). Clearly, it had shown once again that the layered morphology of wCZ achieved by the employment of the one-pot acetic complex method was mainly responsible for the exellent performance in production of EG."
3,Conclusions,"In conclusion, kinds of Cu/ZrO2 catalysts with different Cu contents were prepared by a one-pot acetic complex method and were applied in hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol. Catalytic performances over wCZ showed a volcano-shaped trend with respect to copper content. This result is well matched with the trend of delamination and Cu surface area including Cu–ZrO2 interface. For example, both the bulk 10CZ and 20CZ with few layers and lower SCu showed inferior performance in DMO hydrogenation as well as the 15CZim prepared by impregnation process. By contrast, 50CZ with the higher Cu surface area (21.6 m2 gcat −1) and more layers exhibited the excellent performance among the catalysts tested and other Cu-based catalysts. However, the activity of catalyst with higher Cu content (58%) was affected by the deterioration of lamellar structure and decrease in active sites. In fact, the lamellar structure would make the Cu active sites and Cu–ZrO2 interface more accessible for DMO hydrogenation, and facilitate the diffusion of reactant/product molecules during the catalytic reaction, thus allowing a higher EG yield to be obtained. It is envisaged that this facile delamination process via a one-pot acetic complex method can also be expanded to produce other layered multicomponent catalyst for a variety of potential applications."
