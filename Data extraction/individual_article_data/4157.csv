0,Introduction,"Growing environmental concerns related to the extensive use of non-sustainable fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) and a constantly increasing energy demand will force mankind, sooner or later, to tap into clean and sustainable sources of energy. Photocatalysis is expected to make a great contribution to both environmental treatment (emission cleaning and water purification) and renewable energy. Hydrogen (H2) is widely considered to be the future clean energy carrier in many applications, such as environmentally friendly vehicles, domestic heating, and stationary power generation. Photocatalytic H2 production from water is one of the most promising ways to realize a hydrogen economy for three reasons. (1) This technology is based on photon (or solar) energy, which is a clean, perpetual source of energy, and mainly water, which is a renewable resource; (2) it is an environmentally safe technology without undesirable by-products and pollutants; and (3) the photochemical conversion of solar energy into a storable form of energy, i.e. hydrogen, allows one to deal with the intermittent character and seasonal variation of the solar influx. However, it has proven difficult to find an ideal photocatalyst, which meets all the requirements (chemical stability, corrosion resistance, visible light harvesting and suitable band edges) that would render photocatalytic H2 production a viable alternative. Fortunately, nanoscience and nanotechnology have boosted the modification of existing photocatalysts and the discovery and development of new candidate materials [1], as shown in Fig. 1 . The rapidly increasing number of scientific publications constitutes clear bibliographical evidence for the significance of this hot topic. Since 2004, the number of publications on nanophotocatalytic H2 production has increased by a factor of about 1.5 times every year. Many papers studied the impact of different nanostructures and nanomaterials on the performance of photocatalysts, since their energy conversion efficiency is principally determined by nanoscale properties. The structural and electronic properties of semiconductor photocatalysts largely determine the process of photocatalytic H2 production, including basic steps such as the absorption of photons, charge separation and migration, and surface reactions. A semiconductor consists of a valence band (VB) and a conduction band (CB), which are separated from one another by a bandgap (E g), as shown in Fig. 2 (c). In the ground state, all electrons exist in the VB. Under irradiation by photons with energy equivalent to or larger than E g, some of the electrons are excited from the VB to the CB, leaving empty states, so-called holes, in the VB. These photogenerated electrons and holes may recombine in the bulk or on the surface of the semiconductor on a time scale which is slower than the time required for their formation (Fig. 2(b) and (c)). Electrons and holes that travel to the surface of the semiconductor before they recombine can cause reduction (H2 formation) and oxidation (O2 formation) reactions, respectively. For H2 production to occur, the CB bottom-edge must be more negative than the reduction potential of H+ to H2 (EH+/H2 =0 V vs NHE at pH=0), while the VB top-edge should be more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O to O2 (EO2/H2O =1.23 V vs NHE at pH=0) for O2 formation from water to occur. Apart from the band edge requirements outlined above, there are many other requirements for an ideal semiconductor photocatalyst, of which bandgap and corrosion resistance are most important. From Fig. 2(c), the minimum bandgap of semiconductor photocatalysts for water splitting appears to be 1.23 eV, corresponding to a wavelength of 1008 nm. Note that the gap of 1.23 V between the reduction and oxidation potentials of water splitting is relatively fixed, although the reduction and oxidation potentials simultaneously shift with solution pH (−59 mV per pH unit). However, if we take into account thermodynamic losses and overpotentials that are necessary at various steps in the photocatalytic process to ensure a reasonable reaction rate, effective photocatalysts have been shown to exhibit bandgaps larger than 2 eV, corresponding to a wavelength of <620 nm [2,3]. For example, a considerable activation barrier in the charge transfer between photocatalysts and water has to be overcome by an overpotential. The bandgap requirement is further restricted if solar light is to be used for water splitting, which is the goal for the future. Since the intensity of sunlight is small for wavelengths below 400 nm (3.1 eV), visible light responsive photocatalysts should have bandgaps between 2 and 3.1 eV. As mentioned above, photocatalytic H2 evolution may take place only when the conduction band edge of the photocatalyst is above (i.e. more negative than) the potential of the H+/H2 redox couple. Otherwise, the flat-band potential should be adjusted to the desired level by surface chemical modification. Besides thermodynamic requirements, an ideal photocatalyst should also have kinetic advantages, i.e. high photocatalytic activity. There are a few non-oxide semiconductors (GaAs, CdS, CuInS2, etc.) that meet all of the above requirements. However, they are unstable and/or corrode easily, either dissolving or forming a thin film, which prevents electrons from transferring across the semiconductor/liquid interface. It has thus proven difficult to find a simple and cost-effective photocatalyst meeting all requirements. It seems that photocatalysts based on oxide semiconductors, which are less efficient but corrosion resistant, will be the commercial or practical alternatives. Nanostructured photocatalysts bear the potential to improve many of the weaknesses outlined above. For instance, electron-hole recombination may be reduced in nanosized photocatalysts due to short charge transfer distances, and reactant adsorption and product desorption can be enhanced due to the high surface area offered by nanostructures. This review summarizes the recent development of nanophotocatalysts for H2 production. It excludes, however, work on photoanodes used for photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 generation, which has been reviewed elsewhere [2–5]. Considering the mechanism of the redox reactions, the principle of photocatalytic H2 production is similar to that of photoelectrochemical H2 generation. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the location of the redox reactions. In the photocatalytic process, both oxidation and reduction reactions occur on the surface of a photocatalyst, which functions as both photoanode and photocathode, and as a result, a mixture of H2 and oxidized gas (mostly O2) is evolved (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). On the other hand, oxidation and reduction take place at spatially separated photoanode and photocathode, respectively, in the photoelectrochemical process, resulting in H2 and oxidized gas (mostly O2) being evolved separately. It should be noted that the efficiency of photocatalysts is normally lower than that of photoanodes in H2 generation since hydrogen and oxygen have a tendency to react back to water if they are evolved in the same location. However, compared to photoanodes, photocatalysts do not need a conductive substrate for charge collection, so that a much broader selection of synthetic methods, such as solid-state high temperature synthesis, can be adopted. This allows photocatalysts to be prepared with relative ease and at a competitive cost. In a photocatalytic system, cocatalysts can be easily introduced by firing and mixing. Furthermore, studies focusing on photocatalysts may provide a convenient screening approach for the selection of suitable photoanodes. Given these advantages, the quest towards finding valuable photocatalysts for water splitting has involved a large diversity of materials and strategies. The literature distribution of different nanomaterials, which have been reported to be capable of photocatalytic H2 production, is shown in Fig. 3 . Most photocatalysts are semiconductors or based on semiconductors (composites or mixtures). Among them, the classic photocatalyst TiO2 (including modified TiO2) has been the most attractive since the initial work of Fujishima and Honda [6], due to its corrosion resistance, non-toxicity and low price. In recent years, the work on nanostructured TiO2 has focused on novel synthesis methods yielding TiO2 with special properties, and the modification of TiO2 by dopants, sensitizers, cocatalysts, scavengers and other semiconductors in order to enhance the visible light response and efficiency. In addition, some novel, alternative materials, e.g. oxynitrides and oxysulfides synthesized mainly by the Domen group [7•], have also shown exciting results in this field."
1,Nanophotocatalysts for H2 production,"Photocatalysts are typically made of metal oxides (see Sections 2.1–2.3 below), metal sulfides (Section 2.4), oxysulfides (Section 2.5), oxynitrides (Section 2.5) and composites thereof (Section 2.6). In most cases, metal cations with the highest oxidative states in photocatalysts have d0 (red area in Fig. 4 ) or d10 (green area) electronic configuration, while O, S and N (blue area) show their most negative states. The bottom of the conduction band consists of the d and sp orbitals of the metal cations, while the top of the valence band in metal oxides is composed of O 2p orbitals, which are normally located at ca. +3 V (vs NHE) or higher [7*,8•]. The valence bands of metal oxysulfides and oxynitrides are formed by S 3p (and O 2p) and N 2p (and O 2p), respectively. Some alkali (Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs), alkaline earth (Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) and transition-metal ions (Y, La or Gd) can construct the crystal structure of layered perovskite and cubic pyrochlore compounds, but do not contribute to the energy band structure of these compounds [8•]."
2,Nanostructured TiO2,"2.1 Nanostructured TiO2 Compared to other photocatalysts for H2 production, TiO2 has received more attention because it is stable, corrosion-resistant, non-toxic, abundant and cheap. Currently, there are two factors, which limit its practical and economical application, however. On the one hand, the photon-to-hydrogen efficiency is too low due to rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes as well as the fast back-reaction of H2 and O2 to H2O. On the other hand, it is inactive under visible light irradiation due to its large bandgap, which impedes the use of TiO2 as a solar energy harvesting photocatalyst. In order to overcome these deficiencies, many bulk, surface and operating environment modifications have been conducted. Nanostructured mesoporous TiO2 has been studied recently due to its high surface area and special porous structure, which is beneficial to both the absorption of reactants and desorption of products. Nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 was prepared by a sol–gel process with surfactants [9,10]. The photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO2 calcined at 600 °C for H2 evolution was considerably higher than that of commercial TiO2, Ishihara ST-01 and Degussa P25. Pt nanoparticles with 1–2 nm diameter can easily be introduced into mesoporous TiO2 during the gelation [11,12]. Mesoporous TiO2 with smaller TiO2 crystallite size and higher surface area can be prepared by a hydrothermal method [13]. To obtain high photocatalytic H2 production activity, it is crucial to control the thermal treatment conditions leading to high crystallinity of the anatase phase without the formation of rutile. However, Peng et al. have reported that hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles without calcination, having a large specific surface area (438 m2/g) and small crystallites (2.3 nm) dispersed among amorphous mesoporous domains, exhibited the best photocatalytic activity for H2 production compared with samples calcined at different temperatures and the commercial photocatalyst P25 [14]. A new synthesis route was carried out within a day through a template-free and non-hydrothermal route, in which adding a KCl electrolyte controlled the electrostatic repulsive force between TiO2 nanoparticles towards the formation of a mesoporous structure [15• ]. The photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution of the thus prepared meso-TiO2 was the highest compared to nonporous colloidal-TiO2 and commercial Degussa P25 and Hombikat UV-100 (HBK) samples. The photocatalytic reduction of metal cations (M=Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Ag+, Pb2+) on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 (specific surface area 130–140 m2/g, pore diameter 5–9 nm and anatase content 70–90%), synthesized by the sol–gel technique, was found to result in the formation of nanostructured metal-semiconductor composites (TiO2/M) [16]. It was shown that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/M samples increases with increasing anatase content in the original mesoporous titania, which is in agreement with results from the references mentioned above [9,10,13]. These metal–TiO2 nanostructures exhibit a remarkable photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water–alcohol mixtures, their efficiency being 50–60% greater than that of the metal-containing nanocomposites based on Degussa P25. The anatase content and pore size were the basic parameters determining the photoreaction rate. The rate of the photocatalytic hydrogen formation in water–ethanol mixtures was found to also depend strongly on the metal nature, increasing from silver to nickel to copper. This dependence was interpreted in terms of different electronic interactions between metal nanoparticles and TiO2 surface. The morphology of TiO2 plays a very important role in the efficiency of photocatalysis for H2 production. One-dimensional TiO2 (nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes and nanofibers) has attracted more and more attention. Compared to spherical particles, one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures could provide a high surface area and a high interfacial charge transfer rate. The carriers are free to move throughout the length of these nanostructures, which is expected to reduce the e−/h+ recombination probability. TiO2 nanotubes promoted with Pt metal were prepared and found to be a photocatalytic dehydrogenation catalyst in neat ethanol for producing H2 gas [17]. The prepared TiO2 nanotubes consist of small anatase grains, and have high surface areas (BET surface area of 250–300 m2/g) and large one-dimensional mesopores/macropores (total pore volume of 0.88 ml/g). These properties make them a suitable candidate to be utilized as a photocatalyst. Self-organized TiO2 nanotube-layers were formed by electrochemical anodization of Ti in a HF electrolyte [18]. Pt was deposited on the TiO2 nanotube layer by plasma sputtering. The Pt–TiO2 nanotube photocatalyst generated H2 successfully from an alkaline water solution. Pt-ionized TiO2 nanotubes were reported for the stoichiometric production of H2 and O2 by water splitting under visible light with hydrogen evolution rates of 14.6 and 2.3 µmol/h in aqueous methanol and pure water, respectively [19]. Nanostructured TiO2 films with controlled morphology and thickness were synthesized in an ambient-pressure, single-step flame aerosol reactor (FLAR) for use in water splitting photocells and dye-sensitized solar cells [20]. Two different morphologies were studied: a granular morphology and a highly crystalline columnar morphology. Due to differences in electron transport and lifetime in the TiO2 film, the columnar morphology outperformed the granular morphology for both applications, achieving a UV light to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 11% for water splitting, and a visible light to electricity conversion efficiency of 6.0% for the dye-sensitized solar cell. The columnar morphology consisted of single-crystal structures, approximately 85 nm in width and oriented normal to the substrate. It was found that the conversion efficiency for water splitting was maximized for an optimum thickness of 1.5 μm, which was a tradeoff between light absorption and electron transport losses. TiO2 nanowires (TiO2 NWs) were synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal process in 10 M NaOH (aq.) at 150 °C for 72 h and post heat treatment at 300–1000 °C for 2 h [21]. As the temperature of the post heat treatment increased, as-synthesized TiO2 NWs were transformed into TiO2 (B), anatase and rutile gradually while preserving 1D morphology. Among all the crystal structures, anatase TiO2 NWs exhibited the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate, which was also higher than that of the starting TiO2 powder (Degussa P25). However, Lin et al. suggested that a bi-crystalline structure consisting of TiO2 (B) nanotubes (or nanofibers) and anatase nanoparticles might act as an active, H2-producing photocatalyst [22,23]. The synergetic effect of bi-crystalline TiO2 (B) and anatase has also been observed in photocatalytic degradation of dyes [24,25]. Fabrication and design of TiO2 thin film photocatalysts play an important role in H2 production, since TiO2 thin films have many advantages for practical application in photocatalytic decomposition of water, compared to TiO2 powder. Anpo's group has reported on the separate evolution of H2 and O2 using a visible light responsive TiO2 (Vis-TiO2) thin film photocatalyst prepared by a radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RF-MS) deposition method [26•]. The RF-MS deposition method uses a TiO2 plate as the sputtering target and Ar as the sputtering gas. The precise control of the substrate temperature (T s) is a major factor in the synthesis of these Vis-TiO2 thin film photocatalysts. It was shown that the film prepared at T s =873 K consisted of rutile, and had the highest photocatalytic activity under both UV and visible light irradiation. Compared to anatase (bandgap=3.2 eV), rutile has a narrower bandgap (3.0 eV), which, to some extent, benefits visible light absorption. Additionally, the unique declining O/Ti ratio from the surface to the bulk of the prepared Vis-TiO2 thin films was suggested to cause a significant perturbation of the electronic structure of TiO2, enabling the absorption of visible light for stable photocatalytic reactions. Visible light was considered to be absorbed by the inside bulk of the film rather than the surface, while UV light is absorbed in the surface regions because Vis-TiO2 is covered with a stoichiometric TiO2 phase. A similar appearance of visible light activity due to newly formed oxygen vacancy states between the valence and the conduction bands in the TiO2 band structure has been reported in [27]. The RF-MS Vis-TiO2 films were prepared on one side of a metal (e.g. Ti) foil, while the opposite side was covered with Pt. The prepared photocatalyst assembly was then mounted on an H-type glass container, as shown in Fig. 5 , separating two aqueous solutions. The TiO2 side of the photocatalyst was immersed in 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution, and the Pt side was immersed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution in order to add a small chemical bias. Even under visible light, water could be decomposed into separated H2 and O2 with a good linearity against the irradiation time. It was also reported that the greater the pH difference between the two compartments of the H-type container, the higher the yield of H2 and O2. This indicates that the pH difference provides a small chemical bias as an electrical driving force for electron transfer from the TiO2 to the Pt side through the Ti foil substrate. This unique design applies the advantages of a photoelectrochemical cell in a photocatalytic system for H2 production without any sacrificial reagents. When these novel Vis-TiO2 thin film photocatalysts were prepared on various metal substrates such as Al, Fe, Pd, Pt, Ti and Zr, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate was revealed to increase with a decrease in the work function of the substrate (work function: Pt>Pd>Fe>Ti>Zr>Al), suggesting that the work function of the substrates plays a significant role in the electron transfer from the TiO2 moiety to the Pt side through the metal substrate [28]. Furthermore, the effect of chemical etching by HF solution on the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performances of Vis-TiO2 thin films has been investigated [29]. The Vis-TiO2 thin films treated with HF solution (HF-Vis-TiO2) exhibited a larger surface area and higher donor density than Vis-TiO2, indicating that the remarkable increase in the photocatalytic water splitting rate and photocurrent in HF-Vis-TiO2 may be due to the short diffusion length required for holes to reach the solid–liquid interface as well as to the high conductivity."
3,Other binary metal oxides,"2.2 Other binary metal oxides In addition to TiO2, there are some other traditional metal oxides, which have also been investigated extensively due to their specific advantages. Among them, ZnO, α-Fe2O3 and WO3 are representative. However, they all have their inherent drawbacks in photocatalytic H2 production. ZnO is easily photo-corroded under bandgap irradiation by photogenerated holes. WO3 is a stable photocatalyst for O2 evolution under visible light irradiation, but no H2 production is observed due to its low conduction band level. α-Fe2O3 has the same problem as WO3 and, moreover, is not very stable in acidic solutions. Photocatalytic decomposition of liquid water into H2 and O2 by Ta2O5 has been studied since 1994 [30]. A nanocrystalline mesoporous Ta2O5 photocatalyst for H2 production was recently synthesized through a combined sol–gel process with a surfactant-assisted templating mechanism [31]. The effects of NiO cocatalyst loading and Fe doping have also been studied [31,32]. Nanostructured VO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen production were reported by Zhang et al. [33•]. The monoclinic and tetragonal phases known for bulk VO2 are seldom used as photocatalysts due to the narrow bandgap of 0.7 eV. However, the prepared nanorod VO2, which has a body-centered-cubic (bcc) structure and a large optical bandgap of 2.7 eV, shows excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Using films of aligned VO2 nanorods, the hydrogen production rate reaches a high rate of 800 mmol/m2/h from a mixture of water and ethanol under UV light irradiation at a power density of 27 mW/cm2, thus constituting a good example of how crystal structure and morphology may affect photocatalytic activity."
4,Ternary and quaternary metal oxides,"2.3 Ternary and quaternary metal oxides Investigations of more complex oxides with three and four elements are significant. K4Nb6O17 was reported as a novel niobate photocatalyst for H2 evolution in 1986 [34]. It has a layered structure with two kinds of interlayers. H2 is evolved from one interlayer, in which cocatalysts are introduced by ion exchange or interlayer reaction, while O2 production occurs in the other interlayer, as shown in Fig. 6 . In this case, the sites for H2 and O2 evolution are separated by the photocatalytic niobate sheet [8•]. Furthermore, an electric field gradient originating from the uneven K+ distribution on opposite sides of the niobate sheets assists electron-hole separation. Potassium hexaniobate nanoscrolls (NS-K4Nb6O17) were studied as building blocks for visible light-driven H2 production from water using tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)3 2+) chloride as a sensitizer and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an electron donor [35]. Interestingly, H2K2Nb6O17 nanosheets and H4Nb6O17 nanoscrolls obtained from K4Nb6O17 can preserve the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution observed for the parent compound [36]. A Dion–Jacobson type layered perovskite (ACa2Nb3O10, A=H or K) has been studied as a photocatalyst for H2 production using methanol as a sacrificial donor [37–40]. Both Pt and Rh2O3 can act as cocatalysts to speed up H2 evolution. Photogenerated charge carriers relaxed with second order kinetics on a sub-nanosecond time scale depending on the nanosheet size. A series of H2 production photocatalysts based on K4Ce2M10O30 (M=Ta, Nb) and their solid solution K4Ce2Ta10− X Nb X O30 (X =0–10) was prepared [41•,42] and shown to have an appropriate bandgap energy of ca. 1.8–2.3 eV (corresponding to an absorption edge of 540–690 nm). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the valence bands of these photocatalysts are composed of hybridization with O 2p+Ta 5d (or Nb 4d) and occupied Ce 4f orbitals, while the conduction bands are mainly contributed by the Ta 5d (or Nb 4d) orbitals (Fig. 7 ). K4Ce2M10O30 (M=Ta, Nb) have a parallelepiped (tunnel) surface structure. This is beneficial to the formation of “nano-nests”, to which the cocatalysts, nanoparticles of Pt, RuO2 and NiO X , can be strongly associated, thus avoiding aggregation and improving photocatalytic H2 generation greatly. This is a classic example of the effect of surface nanostructures on photocatalytic performance. Highly efficient photocatalytic H2 generation can also be obtained with different nanostructured titanates, such as cubic SrTiO3 [43], Ruddlesden–Popper type layered perovskite Sr3Ti2O7 [44], (110)-layered perovskite La2Ti2O7 [45], Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 [46] and perovskite K2La2Ti3O10 [47]. Tantalates of the ATaO3 (A: Li, Na, and K) type consist of corner-sharing TaO6 octahedra with perovskite-like structures. NaTaO3 shows the highest photocatalytic activity among the ATaO3 (A: Li, Na, and K) type photocatalysts when a NiO cocatalyst is loaded, which is due to the suitable conduction band level consisting of Ta 5d and energy delocalization caused by the small distortion of TaO6 connections [8•]. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of NiO-loaded NaTaO3 doped with lanthanum was 9 times higher than that of nondoped NiO-loaded NaTaO3 [48]. The small particle size and the ordered nanostep surface structure of the NiO/NaTaO3:La photocatalyst resulting from doping contributed to highly efficient water splitting. H2 evolution proceeded on ultrafine NiO cocatalyst particles, which were loaded on the edges of the nanostep structure of NaTaO3:La nanoparticles, while O2 evolved in the grooves of the nanostep structure. In this way, the reaction sites for H2 and O2 evolution were separated, avoiding the back-reaction to water. This result underlines the importance of the nanostructured surface morphology of photocatalysts."
5,Metal sulfides,"2.4 Metal sulfides Metal sulfides are normally considered attractive candidates for visible light responsive photocatalysis. The valence band of metal sulfides normally consist of 3p orbitals of S, which result in a more negative valence band and narrower bandgap as compared to metal oxides. Recent studies have focused on CdS, ZnS and their solid solutions. CdS has a suitable bandgap (2.4 eV) and good band positions for visible light assisted water splitting. However, S2− in CdS is easily oxidized by photogenerated holes, which is accompanied by the elution of Cd2+ into the solution, similar to ZnO. Such photocorrosion is in fact a common problem to most metal sulfide photocatalysts. CdS can yet be an outstanding photocatalyst for H2 production under visible light irradiation in the presence of a hole scavenger (S2− or SO3 2−). ZnS is another good photocatalyst for H2 production, but its 3.6 eV bandgap corresponds to UV light. Recent developments aiming at improving CdS and ZnS photocatalysts can be divided into four directions: (1) synthesis of one-dimensional and porous CdS; (2) doping and formation of solid solutions of CdS and ZnS; (3) addition of cocatalysts on CdS; and (4) development of support and matrix structures for CdS. (1) A solvothermal method was applied to synthesize CdS nanorods [49] and nanowires [50], which have high photocatalytic activity for H2 production. Mesoporous CdS nanoparticles with an average pore size of 54 Å and a particle size of 4–6 nm have been prepared by template-free, ultrasonic-mediated precipitation at room temperature [51]. Pt-loaded mesoporous CdS shows a hydrogen production rate of 1415 µmol/h/0.1 g catalyst. Nanoporous CdS, including nanosheets and hollow nanorods, has been prepared by a two-step aqueous route, which consists of an initial precipitation of nanoporous Cd(OH)2 intermediates and a subsequent S2−/OH− ion exchange [52]. The obtained CdS nanostructures contain pores with 3 nm diameter and exhibit a very high photocatalytic H2 yield if they are loaded with monodispersed, 3–5 nm large Pt nanocrystals. (2) As mentioned above, ZnS has too large a bandgap to respond to visible light. Doping and the formation of solid solutions of ZnS and narrow bandgap semiconductors can enhance the visible light utilization of ZnS. (AgIn) X Zn2(1− X)S2 solid solutions between ZnS and AgInS2 with a narrow bandgap showed photocatalytic activities for H2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing sacrificial reagents, S2− and SO3 2−, under visible light irradiation (wavelength larger than or equal to 420 nm) [53•] The absorption of the solid solutions shifted monotonically to longer wavelengths as the ratio of AgInS2 to ZnS increased. The dependence of the photophysical and photocatalytic properties upon the composition was mainly due to a change in band position caused by the contribution of the Ag 4d and S 3p, and Zn 4s4p and In 5s5p orbitals to the valence and conduction bands, respectively. ZnS and CdS have similar crystal structures, which make them form solid solutions easily. ZnS–CdS solid solutions were reported to be active for H2 production under visible light irradiation [54–57]. (3) Novel cocatalysts besides noble metals have been found matching CdS. The rate of H2 evolution on CdS is increased by up to 36 times when loaded with only 0.2 wt.% of MoS2, with the activity of MoS2/CdS being even higher than those of CdS photocatalysts loaded with different noble metals, such as Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Au [58•]. The WC/CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst presented in [59] also exhibited a high rate of H2 production, comparable to that of Pt/CdS, under visible light irradiation from water containing sulfide and sulfite ions as hole scavengers. Like the Pt cocatalyst loaded on the surface of CdS, WC provides active sites for proton reduction and causes fast diffusion of photogenerated electrons from CdS towards WC, leading to efficient charge separation and high photocatalytic activity for H2 production. (4) The photocatalytic H2 production by nanosized CdS was enhanced by immobilization of CdS on various supports, such as aluminum-substituted mesoporous silica molecular sieve (Al-HMS) [60], microporous and mesoporous silicas [61], porous and rough polyethylene terephthalate fibers (PET) [62], a designated glass [63], modified (cyclized) polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) [64] and ETS-4 zeolite [65]."
6,"Nitrides, oxynitrides and oxysulfides","2.5 Nitrides, oxynitrides and oxysulfides Nitride, oxynitride and oxysulfide photocatalysts have been systematically investigated by Domen's group. Here, the oxynitride and oxysulfide photocatalysts differ from photocatalysts doped with N or S. For oxynitrides and oxysulfides with metals of d0 electronic configuration, like TaON and Sm2Ti2S2O5, the valence band mainly consists of hybridized N 2p (S 3p) and O 2p orbitals, while the conduction band is mostly composed of the empty d orbitals of the corresponding metal. In this case, oxynitrides or oxysulfides thus contain N or S as constituent elements to form the valence band. Thus, photogenerated holes can migrate smoothly in the valence band of the photocatalysts, which is particularly advantageous for water oxidation involving a 4-electron transfer. In contrast, the dopant levels in the forbidden bandgap are usually discrete, which is unfavorable to the migration of photogenerated holes. From the viewpoint of the electronic band structure, d10 metal (like Ge or Ga) based semiconductors are advantageous over the d0 configurations in that the bottom of the conduction band is composed of hybridized sp orbitals of metals. The hybridized sp orbitals possess large dispersion, leading to increased mobility of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band and thus high photocatalytic activity [7•]. As a d10 electronic configuration metal nitride, β-Ge3N4 was synthesized from GeO2 powder by nitridation under a flow of NH3 at 1153–1173 K for 10 h [66•]. When modified with RuO2 nanoparticles, the material performed photocatalytic stoichiometric evolution of H2 and O2 from pure water. DFT calculations revealed that the tops of the valence band are formed by N 2p orbitals, while the bottoms of the conduction band consist of hybridized 4 s and 4p orbitals of Ge. An oxynitride with d10 electronic configuration, (Ga1− X Zn X )(N1− X O X ) which can decompose water under visible light, was devised in [67•]. As both GaN and ZnO have wurtzite structures with similar lattice parameters, a solid solution between them could be synthesized. Despite the large bandgaps of plain GaN and ZnO (>3 eV), the p–d (i.e., N2p–Zn3d) repulsion in the GaN–ZnO solid solution shifts the top of the valence band formed by N 2p orbitals upward, resulting in a narrower bandgap. The bandgaps of the solid solutions were estimated to be 2.4–2.8 eV by diffuse reflectance spectra. DFT calculations indicate that the visible light response of the solid solutions originates from the contribution of Zn 3d orbitals to the valence band. Like β-Ge3N4 modified with RuO2 nanoparticles as H2 evolution sites, (Ga1− X Zn X )(N1− X O X ) catalyzed observable, steady and stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution under visible light irradiation (λ >400 nm). The activity of (Ga1− X Zn X )(N1− X O X ) modified with various transition-metal oxides as cocatalysts was further improved by co-loading Cr, which is due to the formation of suitable reaction sites by intimate interaction between Cr and the paired metal component [68]. Noble-metal/Cr2O3 core/shell nanoparticles prepared by in situ photodeposition were also developed as a new type of H2 evolution cocatalyst [69•]. In this system, the Rh nanoparticles forming the core induced the migration of photogenerated electrons from the (Ga1− X Zn X )(N1− X O X ) bulk to the surface, while the Cr2O3 shell provided a H2 evolution site at the external surface, which blocked the back-reaction of H2 and O2 to H2O on Rh. Post-calcination at moderate temperature resulted in an improved performance of (Ga1− X Zn X )(N1− X O X ) in photocatalytic water splitting under visible light [70]. The improvement is attributable to the reduction of zinc- and/or oxygen-related defects, which act as recombination centers."
7,Nanocomposites and Z-scheme systems,"2.6 Nanocomposites and Z-scheme systems In order to separate photogenerated electrons and holes and/or utilize visible light, nanocomposites have been extensively studied in photocatalytic H2 production. The intercalation of TiO2, CdS, Cd0.8Zn0.2S and Fe2O3 nanoparticles into layered compounds such as H2Ti4O9, H4Nb6O17, K2Ti3.9Nb0.1O9, HNbWO6, HTaWO6, HTiNbO5 and HTiTaO5 has been reported [71–75], where intercalation suppresses the growth of the nanoparticles. When these intercalated nanoparticles are excited by bandgap irradiation, the photogenerated electrons can be quickly transferred to the matrix layered compounds. In the LaMnO3/CdS nanocomposite, the holes photogenerated by visible light in the valence band of CdS can move to the valence band of LaMnO3 and react with electron donors (Na2S and Na2SO3), while photogenerated electrons remain in the conduction band of CdS and react with water to produce H2. This charge–carrier separation at the nanoscale is responsible for the improved photocatalytic activity [76]. Photocatalytic H2 production via water splitting was also reported on Ni/NiO/KNbO3/CdS nanocomposites using visible light irradiation at wavelengths longer than 400 nm in the presence of isopropanol [77]. The observed high photocatalytic activity is due to effective charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in CdS, which is achieved by electron injection into the conduction band of KNbO3. From the above examples, it is clear that the band positions of different constituents in nanocomposites must match well. Furthermore, the preparation method and the cocatalyst location are also important factors in nanocomposites. This was recently demonstrated in CdS/TiO2/Pt [78,79]. In a conventional system for photocatalytic water splitting, semiconductor photocatalysts should possess both a CB above (i.e. more negative than) the reduction potential of H+ to H2 and a VB below (i.e. more positive than) the oxidation potential of H2O to O2, as shown in Fig. 8 (a). This constraint seriously limits photocatalyst selection and visible light utilization. A Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting system, which involved two-step photo-excitation under visible light irradiation, has been developed by mimicking the natural photosynthesis of green plants [80]. The Z-scheme system consisted of a H2-evolution photocatalyst (PS1 in Fig. 8(b)), an O2-evolution photocatalyst (PS2 in Fig. 8(b)), and a reversible redox mediator (Ox/Red), which acted separately as electron donor (PS1) and acceptor (PS2) for the respective half reaction, and which was different from irreversible sacrificial reagents used in conventional systems. Photocatalysts, which alone are only effective in carrying out one of the two half reactions in water splitting, are capable of running both half reactions when arranged in a Z-scheme, which is the merit of this two-photon system. SrTiO3, TaON, CaTaO2N and BaTaO2N can work as H2-evolution photocatalysts, while WO3, BiVO4 and Bi2MoO6 can act as O2-evolution photocatalysts. The IO3−/I− and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couples normally form reversible electron mediators [80–83]. An all-solid-state Z-scheme, based on a CdS–Au–TiO2 three-component nanojunction, was recently reported, where PS1(CdS), PS2(TiO2) and the electron-transfer system (Au) were spatially fixed [84•]. The vectorial electron transfer of TiO2 →Au→CdS occurs as a result of excitation of both TiO2 and CdS. The electron supply from TiO2 to CdS via Au restricts the self-decomposition of CdS due to the oxidation of surface S2− ions by the photogenerated holes in CdS. In a Z-scheme system, H2 and O2 are evolved separately from two different photocatalysts, which, to some extent, restrains the back-reaction of water decomposition. The key factors in the design of a Z-scheme system are to find a pair of photocatalysts for separate H2 and O2 production with high efficiency, and a reversible electron mediator, the redox potential of which can meet the requirements of being electron donor and acceptor in the respective unit reactions. The energy levels and charge transfer should also be considered when designing both nanocomposites and Z-scheme systems."
8,Summary and outlook,"Photocatalytic H2 production offers unique opportunities to develop an alternative and sustainable energy system and to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. In photocatalytic H2 production, photocatalyst materials play a crucial role. Novel photocatalysts are expected to be developed, while the existing materials should be modified and optimized. Nanostructured photocatalysts are expected to be a future trend, since nanosized photocatalysts have shown much better performance than their bulk counterparts. It is difficult to say what kind of material is perfect or best, since there is no existing photocatalyst that meets all the requirements, and all candidates have their specific drawbacks. Metal oxide photocatalysts are definitely considered promising materials. Although most metal oxides show low photonic efficiency, these cheap materials possess good corrosion resistance, and hence can exhibit stable performance for a long time. In the light of the preceding literatures, TiO2 has been and will be one of the most important photocatalysts for H2 production, owing to its availability, low price, non-toxicity, high photoactivity and stability. The biggest disadvantage of TiO2 is the low utilization of visible light, as a consequence of its wide bandgap. Multi-component metal oxides with perovskite structures like ATaO3 (A=Li, Na, K), Sr2M2O7 (M=Nb, Ta), A m B m O3m +2 (m =4, 5; A=Ca, Sr, La; B=Nb, Ti), RbLnTa2O7 (Ln=La, Pr, Nb, Sm), pyrochlore structures like Bi2MNbO7 (M=Al, Ga, In), RbWMO6 (M=Nb, Ta), A2Ta2O6 (A=Na, K), orthorhombic structures like ATa2O6 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba), tungsten bronze structures like K4Ce2M10O30 (M=Ta, Nb), columbite structures like NiM2O6 (M=Nb, Ta), tunnel structures like MIn2O4 (M=Ca, Sr) and scheelite structures like AMO4 (A=Ag, Bi; M=Mo, W) have been scrutinized in detail. Some of these complex oxides have suitable band structures for visible light water splitting, since more metal elements can contribute to the construction of valence and/or conduction band. Some display specific “nest” nanostructures, which are suitable for nanosized cocatalyst loading. Metal sulfides can be applied in practical photocatalytic H2 production systems if sulfur by-products such as hydrogen sulfide from the hydrogenated desulfurization process in petrochemical plants and mining industries are available and plentiful. Solid solutions from two or more semiconductors are ideal photocatalytic systems driven by visible light, the optical and photocatalytic properties of which can be adjusted gradually by suitable choices of the constituents and their contents. Oxynitrides and oxysulfides have been found to be stable photocatalysts for water reduction and oxidation under visible irradiation. This finding provides good clues to fine-tuning the valence band position. The ability to adjust and fine-tune bandgap and band positions is instrumental in developing visible light responsive photocatalysts for H2 production. Three approaches towards band engineering have been reported, namely (i) cation doping, (ii) valence band modification and (iii) solid solution formation [85•], as shown in Fig. 9 . Valence band modification (like TaON and Sm2Ti2S2O5 mentioned in Section 2.5) and solid solutions (like (AgIn) X Zn2(1− X)S2 mentioned in Section 2.4) are promising and effective due to the formation of new bands, while discrete donor levels are introduced by cation doping. These discrete levels are inconvenient for the migration of photogenerated holes, and the donor levels easily act as recombination centers. Appropriate band construction is necessary, but not sufficient. In order to obtain efficient H2 production, combining different techniques and approaches is indispensable. First of all, a database of existing nanophotocatalysts has to be established, since plenty of nanostructured materials have already been used in photocatalytic H2 production. The accumulation of a large amount of empirical/experimental and theoretical data is important in the quest to foster a deep understanding of the preparation, properties and performance of photocatalysts and their optimization for water splitting. This database should include information regarding the nanomaterials used, preparation methods, modifications, photocatalytic reaction environments and activity, etc. Using this database will avoid repeated, unnecessary work and direct the development of new nanophotocatalysts. With the aid of crystallography, physics and chemistry handbooks, and model calculations, new nanophotocatalysts will be designed and screened, and their band structures may be obtained. Novel synthesis methods for nanophotocatalysts should be developed, since synthetic methods strongly affect material performance. Low-dimensional nanostructures with high aspect ratio and porous nanostructures will certainly attract more attention, as they favor charge and mass transport, respectively. There is a requirement to understand the interfacial and local properties of nanophotocatalysts, such as the interfaces between photocatalyst, cocatalyst and water, and the location of grain edges and boundaries. The charge and mass transport processes in these areas, which are predominant in nanostructures, are different from those in the bulk phase. In most cases, photocatalytic H2 production can be increased dramatically by modifying the catalyst's nanostructure with cocatalysts. Hence, the design of “nano-nest” structures on photocatalysts is important in order to host nanosized cocatalysts in well-defined and tailored positions. The reaction kinetics in photocatalytic H2 production has to be emphasized to a greater extent if maximum efficiency is expected. Theoretical and modelling work is useful and imperative in better understanding of the process and mechanism of nanophotocatalytic H2 production as well as designing new nanophotocatalysts and miniphotoreactors. Calculations provide a molecular picture of hydrogen production on catalytic surfaces, which may allow us to design such catalytic surfaces on the basis of insight [86]. Multi-technology integration will provide a bright prospect for photocatalytic H2 production by nanomaterials."
