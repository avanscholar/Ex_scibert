0,Introduction,"Recently, materials with nanostructure attracted great interest as smaller, faster and cheaper materials particularly those coming from metallic nanoparticles can be produced. Metal nanoparticles represent the largest area for nanomaterial preparation due to its brilliant physical and chemical properties such as electronic, catalytic, magnetic and optical properties for which they have potential use in biomaterials science field [1,2]. There is great interest in Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) preparation due to its unique properties in several research fields [3,4]. AuNPs are the most stable and compatible metal nanoparticles used for preparation of smart devices [5,6]. AuNPs can enhance the performance of non-volatile memory devices [7] and are used as low temperature printing metal inks in electronics [8]. Natural fabrics such as cotton and wool have gained permanent coloration by treatment with AuNPs [6]. In addition AuNPs act as anti-aging factor for skin protection [4]. Chemical reduction of metal salts by chemicals as reducing agents such as citric acids, borohydrides, or other organic compounds represent the most common preparation method of metal nanoparticles [1,9–11]. These reducing agents cause cytotoxicity as a biological hazard. Application of green chemistry principals have been used to minimize or eliminate the waste and implement sustainable processes [12]. Therefore, nowadays biological methods or natural biopolymers are preferably used to prepare metal nanoparticles specially AuNPs. AuNPs are generally prepared by the chemical reduction of gold salts in an aqueous solution. The presence of capping agents such as polymers is very important to stabilize the prepared nanoparticles. Natural biopolymers as capping agents play an important role to achieve green chemistry principles [13]. Previously AuNPs were prepared via chemical reduction methods by using sodium borohydride or hydrazine hydrate. But the nanoparticles instability and its aggregation in water represents the main drawbacks [14]. Therefore, green chemistry was used to overcome these drawbacks by using ecofriendly biocompatible plant extracts such as banana peels and coriander [15] or non-toxic biocompatible natural polysaccharides such as chitosan [16] and gelan gum [17]. Therefore, AuNPs prepared via green chemistry could be used in biomedical applications. Raveendran et al. was the first team to apply green chemistry principals for silver nanoparticles preparations by using glucose as a green reducing agent and starch as green capping agent [18]. Solvents, reducing and capping agents are used to establish a green synthesis method for metal nanoparticles [19],[46]. Electrospinning is an effective, cheap and simple method for nanofibers production from polymeric solution when compared with other methods such as phase separation and self-assembly. This method produces ultrafine fibers from submicron to nanometer diameter [13,20–23]. Recently, composite nanofibers are fabricated via electrospinning technique through incorporating metal nanoparticles into electrospun nanofibers to have applications in several fields especially the medical sector [24,25]. The main impact of the electrospun nanofibers is its compatibility with the size of human cells because of its very high surface area so that electrospun nanofibers have been used for filtration and absorption in biological systems such as artificial blood vessels, sutures, wound dressing, and drug delivery systems [25,26]. Chitosan as cheap renewable biopolymer has several applications in the medical field [27,28]. Chitosan and its derivatives could stabilize AuNPs by its amino groups to avoid nanoparticles aggregations [29–31]. Here, CMCS is used instead of chitosan for AuNPs preparations due to its solubility in water which reflects its unique properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity [25,32]. In addition, it can be considered as quick reducing agent for chloroauric acid to gold particles. Kim et al. prepared poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) nanofibers with incorporated gold nanoparticles by electrospinning [33]. This electrospinning was conducted in two steps, 1) formation of AuNPs and 2) addition of capping agent to the PEO solution afterwards. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is one the most common water soluble fiber forming electrospun nanofibers. In addition it has been used as reducing and capping agent for metal nanoparticle preparation [25]. In the present work we have prepared nanofibers with stabilized and well dispersed AuNPs by using PVA as nanofibers forming material and capping agent and CMCS as reducing agent. Without any further steps we directly prepared nanofibers via electrospinning. We aimed to obtain innovative easy route for the fabrication of CMCS-AuNP nanofibers by electrospinning technique with internal capping agent. UV spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging were used to characterize the synthesized AuNPs. The produced nanofibers were characterized by FTIR and SEM micrograph. Antibacterial activity was estimated to use the nanofibers in biomedical applications. Finally, we compared the cytotoxicity of AuNPs produced by Green chemistry with AuNps prepared by common chemical reduction."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Hydrochloroauric acid (HAuCl4) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Chitosan (Aldrich, USA, viscosity 1860cps, degree of deacetylation 79.0%). Sodium hydroxide (Modern Lab chemicals), monochloroacetic acid (Fluka, Germany). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Four bacterial strains Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 19615) as Gram positive and Escherichia coli (ATCC 11229), Salmonella enterica (ATCC 7251), Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 33420) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) as Gram negative were used. These bacterial strains were selected as test cells because they are the most frequent bacteria in wound infection and represent Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively. Fresh inoculants for antibacterial assessment were prepared on nutrient broth at 37 °C for 24 h."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Preparation of carboxymethylchitosan The carboxymethylchitosan (CMCS) was prepared according to the procedure given in the literature [34]. Briefly, chitosan (5 g), sodium hydroxide (12.8 g) and isopropanol solvent (100 mL) were suspended in a flask to swell and alkalize at room temperature for 1 h. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C in a water bath. The monochloroacetic acid (14.6 g) was dissolved in isopropanol (50 mL), and added to the reaction mixture drop wise within 30 min., then the carboxymethylation proceeded for 3 h at 60 °C. Then, the reaction was stopped by adding a few drops of acetic acid to neutralize the reaction mass and the isopropanol was decanted. Ethyl alcohol (80%) was added and the solid product was filtered and rinsed with 80% ethyl alcohol to desalt and dewater. The product was then vacuum-dried at 40 °C. 2.2.2 Preparation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) Glassware was cleaned in a bath of freshly prepared aquaregia solution (HCl:HNO3 3:1) and then rinsed thoroughly with H2O prior to use. Before the preparation of AuNPs, stock solution of 1% (2 g) CMCS was prepared in bi distilled water. The solution was stirred overnight and turned into a homogeneous system. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (100 μL, 20 mM) was mixed with 3 mL of the carboxymethylchitosan solution and the mixture was heated at 100 °C on a water bath with magnetic stirring until a red solution was obtained [1]. 2.2.3 Preparation electrospinning solutions Polymer solutions used for electrospinning were prepared as follow: CMCS solution (2 wt%), was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of CMCS, containing HAuCl4 (100 μL, 20 mM), in 10 ml distilled water under continues stirring for 1 h. PVA solution (8 wt%) was prepared by dissolving 0.8 g of PVA in 10 ml distilled water with moderate stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. The optimum condition for forming nanofibers is 8 wt% PVA and 2 wt% CMCS solution from total 10 wt% solution, obtained from our previous work [23]. 2.2.4 Preparation of nanofibers by electrospinning The viscous solution of PVA/AuNPs/CMCS composites was contained in a plastic syringe. The pinhead was connected to a high-voltage generator, an aluminum foil served as the counter electrode. A dense web of fibers was collected on gauze bandage on top of aluminum foil. The utilized electrical potential amounted to 25 kV, the distance between the capillary and the substrate electrode was 15 cm, and the feed rate of the solution was 1 ml/h through a syringe pump. The electrospinning was performed at room temperature at open system. The electrospinning device used consists mainly of extrusion system (syringe pump), collecting electrode, and high voltage supply. Samples from nanofiber web with aluminum foil were taken for SEM imaging and samples from nanofiberwebs on gauze bandage were taken for antibacterial evaluation [23]."
4,Characterization of materials,"2.3 Characterization of materials The morphology and particle size of AuNPs were investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM), JEOL JEM 2100 F electron microscope at 200 kV. The surface morphology of the electrospun nanofibers was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination by mounting the samples on stub with double stick adhesive tape and coated with gold in a S150A sputter coater unit (Edwards, UK). The gold film thickness was 150 Å. The samples were then viewed in a JEOL JXA-950 Electron Probe Micro Analyzer, Japan. UV–Vis absorption spectra of AuNPs were recorded by using a Spectronic UV–Vis spectrometer (Model: Genesys 2, USA). UV-blocking protection, expressed as UV-protection factor (UPF), was determined according to the Australian/New Zealand Standards: AS/NZS 4399-1996, and ranked as follows: good protection (UPF: 15–24), very good protection (UPF: 25–39), and excellent protection (UPF N 40). The higher the UPF value, the better the protecting property is. Degree of whiteness and yellowness of fabric samples were evaluated using Color-Eye 3100 Spectrophotometer (SDL Inter). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the all samples were obtained using a Nexus 670 FTIR spectrophotometer (Lelet Co., USA). The spectra of sample in the range of 4000–800 cm−1 are investigated. X-ray diffraction studies were conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (D2 Phaser, Bruker AXS, Germany) operating at 30 kV and 10 mA. The diffraction patterns were recorded using Cu-K radiation and the film samples were analyzed at a 2θ range, 1–50°. The electrical conductivity of the solution was measured by a conductivity meter (DDS-11, Shanghai, China)."
5,Evaluation of antibacterial activity via disk diffusion method,"2.4 Evaluation of antibacterial activity via disk diffusion method The antibacterial activity of the prepared nanofibers was determined by disk diffusion method on an agar plate as described in previous work [35,36]. In the antibacterial assay, all data were the means from at least three parallel experiments that the discrepancies among them were <5%."
6,Assay for cytotoxicity test of carboxymethylchitosan (in vitro),"2.5 Assay for cytotoxicity test of carboxymethylchitosan (in vitro) 2.5.1 Cell culture Culture was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (in case of A549), and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5%CO2 and 95% humidity, cells were sub-cultured using trypsin versene 0.15%. Notable, skin normal human cell line (BJ-1) “Immortalized normal foreskin fibroblast cell line” was obtained from Karolinska Center, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute and Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Other cell lines were obtained from Vacsera (Giza, Egypt). 2.5.2 Cell viability assay After about 24 h of seeding 20,000 cells per well in case of A-549 cells per well (in 96 well plates), the medium was changed to serum-free medium containing a final concentration of the extracts of 100 μg/ml in triplicates. The cells were treated for 24 h. 100 μg/ml doxorubicin was used as positive control and 0.5% distilled water was used as negative control. Cell viability was determined using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay as described by Mosmann 1983 with minor modifications [37,38]. Percent cytotoxicity = 1 − Av X Av NC × 100 where Av: average, X: absorbance of sample well measured at 595 nm with reference 690 nm, NC: absorbance of negative control measured at 595 nm with reference 690 nm."
7,Results and discussion,"We prepared PVA/AuNPs/CMCS composite nanofibers. Gold salt was directly reduced to gold nanoparticles by CMCS. The prepared nanoparticles capped in CMCS solution, then CMCS protected the gold nanoparticles. PVA was added as fiber aiding material."
8,Preparation of carboxymethylchitosan (CMCS),"3.1 Preparation of carboxymethylchitosan (CMCS) The carboxymethylchitosan prepared based on our previous work [23,25] as shown in Scheme 1 . Nitrogen content has been used to confirm the conversion of chitosan to carboxymethylchitosan by changing its percent from 6.9 for native chitosan to 3.9%. This change in nitrogen content is due to the conversion of both NH2 and CH2OH into NHCH2COOH and CH2OCH2COOH respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of CMCS compared with original chitosan (CS). FT-IR spectrum shows that strong peak at 3420 cm−1 which corresponds to OH and NH stretching vibrations for CS appears wider at 3428 cm−1 for CMCS. Band peaks at 2918 cm−1 and 2846 cm−1 for CS replace by one band peak at 2927 cm−1 for CMCS, in addition band peak at 1640 replaced by one at 1639 cm−1 which are corresponding to CH and CO bonds stretching respectively two strong peaks at 1733 and 1385 cm−1 which corresponding to carboxylate group vibrations confirm the conversion of CS into CMCS and formation of the CH2COO– groups onto CS chains [25]. The 1H NMR spectrum of carboxymethylchitosan is shown in Fig. 2 . Chemical shifts were at 1H NMR (TFA/DMSO): δ = 4.074 and 3.883 ppm for H-3, H-4, H-5, H-6 and H-2 in glucose amine unit; δ = 2.883 for hydrogen of C-2 and C-3 and methylene of carboxymethyl group (Glu-NH-CH2-COOH). δ = 2.536 ppm for Glu-NH-COCH3. Therefore, 1H NMR spectral data agrees with FTIR results."
9,Preparation and characterization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs),"3.2 Preparation and characterization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) Carboxymethylchitosan (CMCS) has been used as reducing and capping agents in the preparation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This is due to the presence of free amino groups that bind with AuNPs to stabilize the prepared nanoparticles [29,32,39] as shown in Scheme 2 . CMSC capped AuNPs were prepared via two consecutive steps as follow: (a) heating HAuCl4 solution in water bath at 100 °C with stirring. (b) ultra-sonication of the result solution for 45 min. at high frequency. We prepared PVA/gold nanoparticle/CMCS composite nanofibers. Gold salt was directly reduced to gold nanoparticles by carboxymethylchitosan in the PVA viscous solution, then PVA protected the gold nanoparticles. We added PVA mainly because the viscosity of solution increased. If we added all the PVA to the system directly, the chance of reaction between chloroauric acid and reducing agent was decreased, and the nanoparticles could not be well dispersed in the PVA solution. The formation of AuNPs was confirmed by changing of the HAuCl4 solution colour from yellow colour to reddish brown to red colour. In addition, we performed systematic characterization of the prepared AuNPs from UV–Vis spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM imaging as shown in Fig. 3 (a-d). Fig. 3a shows UV–Vis spectra of AuNPs capped in CMCS. There are SPR (surface plasmon resonance) at 520–530 nm with no change in the peak position, which indicates that there is no nanoparticles agglomeration [41]. In addition, Fig. 3a shows the effect of concentrations of HAuCl4 (0.024–0.072 wt%) and CMCS (0.1–0.3 wt%) on nanoparticles formation efficiency. As the concentration of HAuCl4 increased, the AuNPs formation efficiency increased because of gold ions enhanced the oxidation power of CMCS hydroxyl groups. As the concentration of CNCS increased, AuNPs increased till 0.15 wt% concentration then this efficiency decreased with aggregations because the steric effect of CMCS. Fig. 3b showed TEM imaging of CMCS capped AuNPs. TEM images showed that AuNPs capped in CMCS were normal distributed within CMCS polymer matrix with spherical shape and its particle size was ranged from 15 to 25 nm. These spherical AuNPs with these particle size ranges are suitable for biomedical applications and can be fabricated into electrospun nanofibers. In addition, some of AuNPs were in non- spherical shaped due to two or three spherical particles interference through nucleation process [32,42]. The crystal structure of the prepared AuNPs was determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD pattern of AuNPs represented in Fig. 3c. XRD of AuNPs were displayed 2θ values at 38.45, 43.92, 67.45 and 78.23° which corresponding to plane lattice sets (111), (200), (220) and (311) respectively. Therefore, XRD confirms that AuNPs had cubic structure with peaks sharpness due to nano-sized structure of the nanoparticles. In addition, XRD showed two characteristic peaks for CMCS at 2θ vales at 11 and 23° which appears in capped AuNPs in broad peaks due to an incorporation of AuNPs within CMCS. FT-IR spectra were used to confirm the reduction of HAuCl4 to AuNPs capped in CMCS. Fig. 3d illustrated FT-IR spectra of both pure CMCS and AuNPs capped CMCS. Both of them showed the same major band peaks, at 3436 cm−1 for OH and NH groups stretching; 2926 cm−1 for CH stretching; 1611 cm−1 for CO and NH coupling; 1431 cm−1 for CN and NH coupling; 1058 cm−1 for CO bending and 886 cm−1 for polysaccharide ring, but CMSC capped AuNPs spectrum showed and intensity increased with blue shift for CO and NH groups at 1602 cm−1. This change in intensity results from electrostatic interaction of AuNPs and carboxylate groups in CMCS and/or from coordination of CMCS nitrogen/oxygen atoms with AuNPs. Fig. 4 showed the electrical conductivity of CMCS/AuNPs/PVA nanocomposite measured at room temperature at constant PVA concentration content (7 wt%). As the AuNPs concentration increased from 0, 0.024, 0.036, 0.048, 0.60, 0.072 wt%, the conductivities of solution were 0.36, 0.47, 0.51, 0.75, 0.84 mS/cm. In general, we found that as the amount of AuNPs in solution increased, the solution conductivity enhanced. Therefore, dispersing of AuNPs in PVA solution causes an improvement in its conductivity because gold is a conductor."
10,Electrospinning of PVA/AuNPs/CMCS aqueous solutions,"3.3 Electrospinning of PVA/AuNPs/CMCS aqueous solutions CMCS is high viscose electrolyte in water. Therefore, its aqueous solution is not spinnable alone and need another fiber aiding material such as PVA. The main role of PVA is fiber aiding material of CMCS because of the hydrogen bonds formed between CMCS and PVA. In addition, it can be used as stabilizer for AuNPs [23]. Fig. 5 showed SEM images of CMCS/AuNPs/PVA nanofiber composite. Fig. 5 (A, B, C, D, E) illustrated the effect of AuNPs content in the nanofiber composite morphology and its diameter. The results showed that as the HAuCl4 concentration in the solution increased from 0.024, 0.036, 0.048, 0.060 and 0.072 wt%), the nanofiber diameter decreased in sequence 214.8, 212.8, 196.7, 165.8 and 157.5 nm. In addition, the AuNPs weight percent obtained in the nanofiber composite increased from 0.35, 0.58, 0.76, 0.98 and 1.09 wt% receptivity. This decrease in nanofiber diameters is due to an increase of charge density of AuNPs in the electrospinning solution which ejected with stronger elongation force in electric field to form thinner nanofibers [13]. Also, AuNPs distributed inside the produced electrospun nanofibers as a little spherical spot and the average AuNPs size were 10 nm, 10.5 nm, 11 nm, 11.5 nm and 12 nm respectively, which related to the chloroauric acid concentration in solution. These results confirmed that AuNPs well dispersed inside CMCS nanofiber composite and reflect the covering effect of CMCS to AuNPs in the nanofiber composite [23,43]. Fig. 6 showed scanning electron microscope analysis (SEM/EDS) which confirmed the presence of AuNPs in the electrospun nanofibers. AuNPs deposited inside electrospun nanofibers in smooth surface. SEM images confirmed that AuNPs were prepared in homogeneous distributed inside the nanofiber composite. In addition, Au content was 1.09 wt% measured from EDX analysis [44]. The uniform appearance of AuNPs within nanofibers proofed that experimental reaction conditions had no any effect on the nanofibers surface morphology. In addition, AuNPs had strong physical and chemical interactions with CMCS nanofibers so that they were strong attached together [44]. Fig. 7 illustrated the FT-IR spectra of both PVA, CMCS and CMCS/AuNPs/PVA nanofibers composite to confirm that AuNPs distributed inside CMCS nanofibers [45]. From Fig. 7 we found that when the content of AuNPs were increased the band peaks of both CH and OH out of plane groups, at 848 and 617 cm−1 were disappearing. In addition, appearance of two peaks at 1322 cm−1 and 1420 cm −1 corresponding to in plane OH group and wagging OH group vibrations confirmed that AuNPs were oriented within CMCS nanofibers and the interaction between them were take place via OH groups. The prepared nanofiber composites from PVA/AuNPs/CMCS gain new valuable properties other than antibacterial such as ultra violet protection (UPF). Table 1 shows the effect of AuNPs content in electrospun solution on ultraviolet efficiency. The results were shown that UPF increased with increasing of the contents of AuNPs in electrospun solution (wt%). This increasing reflects on atomic absorption values of AuNPs expressed mg/dl. It was demonstrated that an increasing of AuNPs in electrospun nanofibers results in a significant increase in their UV-protection function. The UV-protection property of electrospun nanofibers showed that they afforded poor protection, UPF < 20, against UV-radiation. The variation in protection value is expressed as UPF, between the electrospun nanofibers, with and without AuNPs. [46]. For AuNP concentration above 0.58 wt%, the UPF > 20 offers protection against UV radiation. UPF increased to 64 for 1.09 wt% AuNPs."
11,Antibacterial activity of PVA (AuNPs) CMCS nanofiber composites,"3.4 Antibacterial activity of PVA (AuNPs) CMCS nanofiber composites The antibacterial activity of CMCS nanofibers measured via disk inhibition method (expressed in size of zone of inhibition) were illustrated in Fig. 8 Chitosan and chitosan derivatives had higher antibacterial activity due to some type of interaction of its amino groups and negative charges on bacterial membrane, which inhibited the bacterial cell growth causing death of bacteria [46,47,48]. Fig. 8 showed that antibacterial activity was increasing when AuNPs increased for both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria which confirmed that the interaction of CMCS with AuNPs proceed through OH groups not NH groups. In other words, the area covered by the nanofibers from CMCS with higher concentration of AuNPs leads to an increase of the inhabitation zone with AuNPs concentration [23,36]. However, chitosan and its derivatives were more effective towards Gram positive bacteria than Gram negative bacteria because of the difference of bacterial cell wall as showed in previous studies [35], Antibacterial results Fig. 8 showed that electrospun PVA/AuNPs/CMCS nanofibers composite had similar activity towards both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria due to its transformation to nano structure that made it can penetrate the bacterial cell wall although the presence of more potential barrier. [23,36]."
12,In vitro cytotoxicity is enhanced with DOX loaded AuNPs,"3.5 In vitro cytotoxicity is enhanced with DOX loaded AuNPs The cytotoxicity of AuNPs were studied by using epidermis cell line (A549). These cell lines grew on CMCS, CMCS reduced AuNPs and chemical reduced AuNPs at different concentrations, from 0.024 wt% Au to 0.072 wt% concentration of HAuCl4, for 24 h to evaluate the viable cells according to MTT protocol. The viable cells of chemical reduced AuNPs were decreased from 48.1 ± 0.3% to 11.01 ± 0.3% as the concentration of Au increased from 0.024 wt% to 0.072 wt% whereas these viable cells were changed from 96.1 ± 0.3% to 91.2 ± 0.3% for CMCS reduced AuNPs at the same concentrations as shown in Fig. 9 . Therefore, there is illustrated increase in cytotoxicity of chemically reduced AuNPs whereas, there is no any significant in cytotoxicity of CMCS reduced AuNPs. From (Fig. 9) it can be illustrated that there is no any significant decrease in viable cell within range of CMCS loaded AuNPs concentration from 0 to 0.072 wt%, so that it can be reported that CMCS loaded AuNPs are non-toxic, safe and cell compatible and can be used as biomaterial for drug delivery."
13,Conclusion,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were prepared via easy and green method by using CMCS as reducing and stabilizing agents at the same time. UV absorption, XRD, UPF and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to characterize these AuNPs. MTT protocol was used to evaluated cytotoxicity of the prepared AuNPs. CMCS was prepared based on our previous method by reacting chitosan with monochloroacetic acid in alkaline medium. CMCS/AuNPs/PVA nanofibers composite have been successfully prepared. The prepared AuNPs have spherical shapes with average diameter from 15 to 25 nm and are well distributed inside the prepared nanofibers. The prepared nanofibers composite showed higher antibacterial activities towards both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria than AuNPs alone due to nano sized structure, and its antibacterial activities were increased by increasing AuNPs wt% in the nanofibers composite. Therefore, it can be used in several biomedical applications. AuNPs capped by CMCS showed lower cytotoxicity compared with that prepared by other chemical reduction, which means that these nanoparticles have more safety in medical treatment purposes."
