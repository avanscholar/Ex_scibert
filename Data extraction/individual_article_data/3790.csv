0,Introduction,"In recent decades, increasing CO2 emission into the atmosphere is one of the main reasons for global warming with adverse environmental effects such as sea level rise, floods, droughts, etc. Reduction of fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal.) consumption by energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage, conversion of CO2 to different products, application of renewable energies and reforestation are effective mitigation options. Fossil fuel power plants, oil and gas and other industries such as iron and aluminum, cement, lime, hydrogen, ammonia and methanol plants have been known as the major emission sources of CO2 which produce more than 33% of the total CO2 in the world (IEA, 2007). The production rate of CO2 in fossil fuel power plants fuelled by natural gas is equal to 350–600kg/(MWh produced electricity) depending on their thermal efficiency (Kaggerud et al., 2006). Also, CO2 emission rate in methanol synthesis plants from natural gas is around 250–500kg/(tonne of methanol) (Cifre and Badr, 2007). There are various techniques for CO2 capture in fossil fuel power plants such as pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion carbon capture technologies (GCCSI, 2009; IPCC, 2005; IEA, 2008, 2009). CO2 capture in power plants decreases the overall efficiency of plants by 9–13% (Kaggerud et al., 2006). The decrease of efficiency results in increase of fuel consumption and therefore, produced electricity cost increases. Table 1 shows the comparison of efficiency and cost of combined cycle power plants with and without CO2 capture (Davison, 2007). The co-production of electricity and fuels with CO2 utilization has been studied by several authors. A comparison of electricity and hydrogen production systems with CO2 capture and storage has been done by (Damen et al., 2006). They have compared state-of-the-art and advanced electricity and hydrogen production technologies with CO2 capture using coal and natural gas based on conversion efficiency, energy production costs, and CO2 avoidance costs. They have showed reduction in electricity and hydrogen production costs by means of developing new technologies including fuel cells and membrane reformers. Conversion of CO2 into valuable products such as methanol is one of the known carbon capture methods. Ribeiro et al. (2010) investigated the use of synthesis gas obtained from biomass gasification as a feed stream for methanol production along with co-capture of carbon dioxide. Since the composition of hydrogen in the bio-syngas is deficient, they used a pressure swing adsorption process to adjust the stoichiometric ratio of a bio-syngas. A novel approach for treatment of CO2 from fossil fired power plants has been studied by (Minutillo and Perna, 2010). They used flue gases as co-reactants in a catalytic process, the tri-reforming process, to generate a synthesis gas for production of chemicals including methanol. They investigated the performance of tri-reforming power plants for co-generation of electrical power and synthesis gas. Energy analysis and energy saving of a methanol/electricity co-production system is taken into account in other work (Guang-jian et al., 2010). By defining new parameters called energy-saving factors, they showed that heat exchange processes are the main contribution to the energy savings. Chen et al. (2011) have recently presented a polygeneration system to produce methanol, liquid fuels and electricity from coal and biomass. The optimal design and operation of the proposed system have been investigated under different economic and policy scenarios in order to minimize the net present value in their work. Methanol synthesis via CO2 recovery in fossil fuel power plant flue gas and renewable hydrogen from water electrolysis unit by renewable energy sources is considered as a zero emission plant with renewable energy storage system (Katayama and Tamaura, 2005; Takeuchi et al., 2001). Recently, in order to increase energy conversion efficiency in methanol synthesis plant through renewable hydrogen and CO2 recovery from fossil fuel power plant, integrated system for co-production of electricity and methanol is proposed in small scale or partial carbon capture in common fossil fuel power plant (Mignard et al., 2003). Mignard and Pritchard (2006) have investigated the production of liquid fuels via captured CO2 from a coal-fired CHP power plant by amine absorption technology and renewable hydrogen. They have compared the energy efficiency of three different liquid fuels including methanol, mixed alcohol and gasoline. They reported methanol process had the highest efficiency, with 0.50kWh of chemical energy stored for each kWh electricity used. Cifre and Badr (2007) investigated the utilization of renewable hydrogen for production of methanol. To utilize the renewable hydrogen for production of renewable methanol, a sustainable carbon source is needed. They considered different carbon sources including biomass or CO2 in the flue gases of fossil fuel-fired power station, cement factories, fermentation processes, and water purification plants and reviewed methanol production pathways via biomass gasification and CO2 recovery from the flue gases of a fossil fuel-fired power station. The main goal of the present study is to develop an integrated system for co-production of electricity in fossil fuel power plant and methanol through captured CO2 and renewable hydrogen from water electrolysis unit in industrial scale. In other words, utilization of renewable energy source to produce methanol by the captured CO2 and renewable hydrogen is investigated technically and economically as a zero emission system. The context of this paper is based on the (Mignard et al., 2003) with a change in power plant unit which was proposed by the same study to utilize a closed cycle using CO2/O2 mixture instead of air in power plant. Therefore, the main feature of this work is using the Matiant cycle power plant to produce electricity instead of using conventional combined cycle or gas turbine power plants. In the Matiant cycle, CO2 is captured through oxy-fuel combustion technology by using oxygen from water electrolysis unit as by-product. In our study, methanol is produced from renewable H2 (by electrolysis of water through electricity produced from wind power) and the captured CO2 from the oxy-fuel combustion of methane. The electricity produced continuously in Matiant cycle power plant is exported to the country grid. It should be noted that the electricity from wind turbines is dedicated to water electrolysis unit to produce renewable hydrogen and this electricity is not exported to the country grid. Consequently, the context of co-generation of methanol and electricity in this work is as follows: 1. Methanol is produced in methanol synthesis unit from renewable hydrogen and the captured CO2. 2. Electricity is continuously produced in Matiant cycle power plant by using CO2 as working fluid which itself is produced by oxy-fuel combustion of methane; the oxygen for oxy-fuel combustion is supplied from the electrolysis unit which is powered by renewable energy. The electricity produced in the Matiant cycle is the only electrical energy exported to the grid. All renewable energy is used for electrolysis only. Since the process goal is the cogeneration of methanol and power from renewable electricity and natural gas, then there is an alternative scheme which relies on (a) natural gas reforming followed by conventional methanol synthesis and (b) direct utilization of the wind renewable energy, with these two processes running independently from each other. In this case one uses whatever wind power is already there and top it up with fossil generation to make up any shortage with respect to demand. Although this scheme seems more straightforward and cheaper than the scheme described above to avoid CO2 emission, this scheme is probably unable to reliably match the supply of power with demand for power at all times, given that both demand and supply will vary independently in time and to a large extent, i.e. steady demand from an industrial process, but supply will still be variable. This scheme can be an attractive and different alternative to this work, but it is beyond the scope of this study. Another alternative interesting scheme to the Matiant cycle studied in this work which is simpler and cheaper alternative to the Matiant cycle, consists of the following processes: (a) natural gas reforming followed by conventional methanol synthesis, (b) electrolysis of water followed by hydrogen and oxygen storage and (c) power generation by using the hydrogen e.g. in a gas turbine or fuel cell plant, with storage of hydrogen and oxygen after (b) allowing steady supply to (a) and (c). This scheme is very attractive and requires a separate and independent comprehensive study of the process and comparison with the present work as well as with previous work reported by Mignard et al. (2003). Therefore, the objective of this work is co-production of electricity and methanol in the proposed system without any CO2 emission into the atmosphere by a combination of renewable wind energy for electrolysis of water to produce H2 and O2 with the Matiant cycle."
1,Methodology,"The developed integrated system consists of four main units: • Water electrolysis unit for production of H2 and O2, • Renewable wind energy unit, • The Matiant cycle power plant with CO2 capture technology through oxy-fuel combustion to produce electricity and export to country grid continuously, • Methanol synthesis unit which is fed by captured CO2 and renewable hydrogen. The produced water in the Matiant power plant and methanol synthesis unit is sent to water electrolysis unit after separation. The block diagram of the integrated system is shown in Fig. 1 . The chemical operations that occur in the system are presented following: (Perry and Green, 2000). The natural gas is assumed to be mainly pure methane. (1) 3H2O→3H2 +1.5O2 ΔH=+286kJ/molH2 (2) CH4 +2O2 →CO2 +2H2OΔH=−800kJ/molCH4 (3) CO2 +3H2 ↔CH3OH+H2OΔH=−49.51kJ/molCH3OH In the water electrolysis unit with renewable energy source, pure oxygen and hydrogen are produced for feeding the power plant and methanol synthesis unit, respectively. The produced oxygen is a by-product of water electrolysis unit. The Matiant cycle power plant is selected as fossil fuel power plant in the integrated system. Its main characteristic is using the oxy-fuel combustion carbon capture technology. The captured CO2 from the Matiant cycle is sent to the methanol synthesis unit and converted into methanol by renewable hydrogen through a catalytic reaction. In this work wind turbine technology is employed as renewable energy source to produce electricity that is required in the electrolysis unit. Since this renewable energy is not available continuously during 24h, the steady operation of all units would be impossible. It is assumed that the renewable energy is available only for 12h/day. Therefore, in order to provide the required feed of power plant and methanol synthesis units continuously, the non-continuous capacity of the renewable energy unit and water electrolysis unit is considered to be two times of their capacities in continuous state. Also, the compression and storage units are required to store extra hydrogen and oxygen for use at the times that the renewable energy source is not available."
2,Technical criteria and process description,"In the integrated system, the design of each unit is based on the established available concepts and methods. Also, their operating conditions and production capacities are selected based on technical feasibility. Subsequently, equipment sizing and cost estimation have been taken into account."
3,Technical criteria,3.1 Technical criteria Production capacity of the methanol unit is assumed to be 900kmol/h. Therefore the Matiant cycle power plant can utilize 900kmol/h CH4 to generate electricity. Mass balance of the integrated system is written according to Eqs. (1)–(3). The technical criteria which are considered in the development of the integrated system are as follows: • Operating time of methanol synthesis unit and Matiant cycle power plant is 8000h/year. • The continuous electricity used in the system is provided from Matiant power plant cycle. • Maximum ambient temperature is 30°C. • The cooling media used in the system is cold water from cooling tower in power plant. • Approach temperature in heat exchangers is 10°C. • The minimum available temperature in processes is 40°C based on the assumption that the cooling water is available at 30°C. • The heat exchanger type is selected as shell and tube with counter-current streams. • Expansion process in the expander is isentropic with 87% efficiency. • Pressurization process in compressors and pumps is isentropic with 75% efficiency. • Natural gas is provided as fuel in power plant at 3bar. • Make up oxygen is provided in power plant at 10bar. • Lower heating value of natural gas is 740MJ/kmol. • Natural gas is assumed to be pure methane. • Molar percentage of H2S in natural gas is less than 0.1ppm.
4,Process description,"3.2 Process description 3.2.1 Water electrolysis unit Alkaline electrolysis occurs at 80°C and 1.5bar. The electrolyte is 25–40% of KOH. It is adopted in cells with nickel wire mesh coated with Raney nickel as cathode and nickel wire mesh coated with Raney nickel–cobalt spinel composite as anode, 2.5m2 surface area and direct electricity with 7.5kA/m2 density and 1.75V as voltage. Alkalinity helps the electrical conductivity. Details of technology and performances can be found in the literature (Mignard et al., 2003). The required power of water electrolysis unit is 617MW during the time at which renewable source is available. This power is enough to produce 5400kmol/h hydrogen with consideration of enthalpy change in water electrolysis reaction and 69.5% of the cells efficiency. Therefore, 391 water electrolysis cells are put in series arrangement in the electrolysis modules. The water electrolysis unit includes 12 parallel branches and each branch is assembled by four series modules which consumes 51.41MW renewable energy. Selecting the value for energy efficiency of electrolysers is based on (Mignard et al., 2003) which includes the energy losses in transformers in order to bring down the power supply from wind turbines, and energy dissipation in silicon controlled rectifier units to deliver DC current to electrolysers, 3.2.2 Renewable energy unit The purpose of the electricity and methanol co-production in the integrated system is mitigation of CO2 emission. Therefore, water electrolysis unit shall operate by energy sources without CO2 emission to provide the renewable hydrogen. Then, wind turbines are assumed as renewable energy unit. After calculation of the required power for water electrolysis unit and the assumption of 5% energy dissipation, the capacity of wind turbines is 650MW in 12h of accessible time (Wang et al., 2009). The energy dissipation occurs in transmission of electricity from renewable source unit to the integrated system. (IEA, 2003). The selection of 50% for capacity factor which seems to be the upper limit for capacity factor of wind turbines was based on our information obtained from certain wind turbines manufacturers and wind farm operators which are available at (www.energynumbers.info). For example, Danish wind farm “Horns Rev 2” comprising 91 Siemens SWT-2.3-93 wind turbines each of 2.3MW and with a nominal total capacity of 209MW, has been reported to have the capacity factor at 46.7%. However, we understand that this is the maximum expected capacity factor which predicts the best performance of the scheme. With regard to technical feasibility of the process, the assumption of 50% capacity factor does not change significance of the project, but this assumption will definitely increase the total product cost of methanol. 3.2.3 Methanol synthesis unit Methanol synthesis reactor is fed by CO2 and H2 in gas phase in order to produce methanol through a catalytic reaction over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst under the adiabatic condition based on the ICI technology (Tijm et al., 2001). The process flow diagram of methanol synthesis unit is shown in Fig. 2 and the properties of streams are presented in Table 2 . Temperature and pressure of the inlet stream into the reactor (3) are considered at 230°C and 50bar and the molar ratio of CO2 to H2 is 1:3. The molar ratio of recycle per reactor output is 8:9 (Mignard et al., 2003). Therefore, the conversion of CO2 into methanol is 20% and the yield of products per each feed circulation is 99% in the reactor. According to Eq. (3) and reactor operating conditions, the outlet stream (4) leaves the reactor at 300°C and 45bar with 10% pressure drop and 70°C increase in temperature. In order to separate products from unreacted feed, the outlet stream is cooled till 40°C in several steps through reheating recycle stream and cooling media. 1800kmol/h reactor products (6) is condensed at 40°C and 44.5bar in a flash drum which is then stored in a storage tank at 1.3bar (8). The recycle gases (18) are compressed to 50bar by a compressor (19) and then mixed with fresh feed (2). The stream (2) is warmed to 230°C in a heat exchanger by hot reactor outlet stream (4) before entering the reactor. Methanol separation from reactor products is called purification process and occurs in two distillation towers. The first tower consists of 60 trays to separate the light components such as CO2 and H2. The second one consists of 70 trays to separate water from methanol. Operating pressure of each reboiler of towers has been selected in order to obtain the maximum thermal energy usage of the stream (4). Thus, the stream (4) after reheating the recycle stream enters to the reboiler of the second tower at 130°C; then, it enters the reboiler of the first tower and leaves it at 90°C. Finally, this stream is condensed by using cooling media in other heat exchanger till 40°C. The products of the second tower (13) are 892.5kmol/h methanol with 99.9% purity and 907.5kmol/h water with 99.1% purity (15). 3.2.4 The Matiant cycle power plant unit The Matiant cycle is based on CO2 circulation as thermodynamic working fluid. The concept of Matiant cycle has been introduced in (IPCC, 2005) as an oxy-fuel direct heating gas turbine cycle however in the best knowledge of authors, there is no pilot or commercial scale power plant that operates on the Matiant cycle. In optimum condition of the cycle for circulation of 1kmol CO2, 0.0818kmol CH4 is burnt through oxy-fuel combustion (Mathieu Ph Nihart, 1999). Therefore, in the power plant of the system, 11,000kmol/h CO2 will be obtained by combustion of 900kmol/h CH4. The process flow sheet of the Matiant cycle is shown in Fig. 3 and the properties of streams are presented in Table 3 . In the Matiant cycle power plant liquid carbon dioxide at 300bar and 80°C (1) is reheated by the hot exhaust stream of expander L (14) up to 600°C (2) then expanded to 40bar in the expander G (3). Again this expander outlet is reheated up to 700°C (4) by stream (14), then mixed with 70% of the total used methane and oxygen and burnt to reach 1300°C (8) in the combustion chamber H. This stream is expanded to 9.7bar in expander I (9) and again mixed with the remaining methane and oxygen and burnt to reach 1300°C in the combustion chamber K (13). This stream is expanded to 1bar in the expander L (14) and passed through the reheater and heat exchangers to be cooled to 40°C (16). The condensed part of stream which is pure water is separated in the flash drum N and sent to water electrolysis unit (17). The circulated CO2 in the closed cycle (18) is pressurized up to 111bar in the compressor with inter-stage cooling system. In the compression stage of the cycle, the inlet stream of each compressor is pressurized till the gas temperature reaches 100°C and the outlet stream is cooled to 40°C by inter cooling system and then sent to the next compressor. The CO2 used in the methanol synthesis process is withdrawn at the intermediate stage of compression corresponding to 50bar (19). The circulated CO2 after compressor stage will be liquid at 111bar and 40°C (20), and then it is pressurized to 300bar by high pressure pumps. 3.2.5 Hydrogen and oxygen compression and storage units In order to provide the required feed for the Matiant cycle power plant and methanol unit at their operating pressure from water electrolysis unit continuously, compression units are considered to pressurize H2 and O2 up to 50 and 40bar, respectively. Also storage units are considered to store H2 and O2 at 12bar and 40°C (Branan, 2002) in the spherical tanks to be consumed during the time in which renewable energy is not available. The process flow sheet of these units is shown in Fig. 4 . The properties of streams are given at Table 4 . Due to limitations in design and construction of large single stage compressors and pressure vessels for storage of the gases, for each one of the 12 parallel water electrolysis branches (1), a separated compressor line and storage vessel were considered for products (2, 7). There are two lines with the same capacity of hydrogen for each branch, one line for storage (3) and another for compression (4). Also, the same design is considered for oxygen (8, 9). The size of storage tanks for oxygen and hydrogen is 2900m3 and 5900m3, respectively. When the renewable energy is not available, the stored products in spherical tanks are transferred to relevant units through the nearby compression units. The compression units consist of four compressors with inter-stage cooling system and storage units consist of two compressors with inter-stage cooling system and spherical storage tanks. Regarding the pressure and size of storage tanks, the assumptions and cost estimation procedure need further explanations. A medium pressure is selected for storage tanks to find a balance between the size of the tanks which is related to construction cost and the energy required in compressors to increase the pressure of the gases. However, the spherical tanks are not usually used for gases at moderate pressure, but hydrogen and oxygen are stored at moderate pressure in order to avoid the increase of annual energy cost of compressing the gases up to high pressure. The other reason for this decision is that the electricity used in compressors is provided from Matiant cycle. Since the electricity produced by Matiant cycle is exported to the country grid, increasing the pressure of storage tanks will decrease the portion of electricity available for exporting to the country grid. Furthermore, the selection of spherical tanks in this work is justified by economic assessment. It is true that the cost of cylindrical tanks is lower than that of spherical tanks, but for a given amount of material, for example carbon steel, the volume of a spherical tank is higher than that of a cylindrical tank constructed by the same amount of metal which means that the spherical tank can contain more gases. Finally, the economic evaluation determines the most economical alternative for storing hydrogen and oxygen. For this purpose, the standard equations for sizing cylindrical and spherical tanks were used which can be found in literature such as (Peters et al., 2002). After calculating the amount of metal used in construction of the tanks, the cost of the tanks with carbon steel per unit mass of used metal can be estimated by Eq. (8) which has been described in Section 4. It has to be mentioned that the authors did not follow the standard sizes for sizing the storage tanks. Indeed, the size of storage tanks is a suggestion from the authors. Regarding metallurgy of storage tanks, the H2 storage tanks were considered to be constructed by carbon steel. For O2 storage tanks, 316 stainless steel was selected to avoid possible corrosion by the presence of oxygen."
5,Cost estimation,"The fixed capital investment (FCI) and total product cost (TPC) for each unit of the integrated system are estimated after equipment technical sizing. For cost estimation, the following assumptions are considered: • Discount rate is 8%. • Plant lifetime is 25 years. • Exchange rate is 1.5US$/(Pound Sterling) and 1.2US$/Euro. The purchase and installation costs of the main equipment are estimated by Eqs. (4)–(8). The other required costs are estimated by industrial equipment cost graphs and equations (Peters et al., 2002). The wind power plant component installation cost (C 1), electrolysis component installation cost (C 2), expander purchase cost (C 3), compressor purchase cost (C 4), and storage tank cost (C 5) are estimated by following equations: (4) C 1 ( US $ ) = 1000 × P Ref: (IEA, 2003) (5) C 2 ( £ ) = 200 × E + 16000 × E 0.60625 Ref. (Mignard et al., 2003) (6) C 3 ( US $ ) = ( − 98.328 × ln ( D ) + 1318.5 ) × D Ref. (Arsalis, 2008) (7) C 4 ( U S $ ) = 91562 × C 445 0.67 Ref. (Arsalis, 2008) (8) C E US $ kg = 73 w − 0.34 Ref. (Peters et al., 2002) where P, E, D, and C are capacities of wind power plant, electrolysis unit, expander and compressor in kW, respectively and w is the total mass of storage tank in kg. Eq. (8) is used to estimate the cost of storage tanks with carbon steer, and to convert the carbon steel as the material of construction to stainless steel, the above equation should be multiplied by a factor which can be found at (Peters et al., 2002). Also for estimation of operating costs, the prices of methane and makeup oxygen which are fed to the Matiant power plant are considered as follows: • First scenario assumes that the minimum price of natural gas is 3.9US$/GJ LHV basis (Davison, 2007). • Second scenario assumes that the price of natural gas is 7.8US$/GJ LHV basis (Davison, 2007). • Price of oxygen, which is produced by renewable energy source, is 2.5US$/kmol (Saxe and Alvfors, 2007). To estimate the total product cost of methanol, the purchase and installation costs of the equipment, and subsequently FCI and annual operating costs are estimated by industrial equipment cost graphs and equations (Peters et al., 2002). Afterwards, FCI is annualized by using discount rate and then it is added to annual operating costs to obtain the total annual cost of the process using following equations: (9) Annual Capital Recovery ( $ / year ) = FCI × i ( i + 1 ) n ( 1 + i ) n − 1 (10) Total Annual Cost $ year = Annual Capital Recovery + Annual Operating Costs where i and n are discount rate and plant lifetime, respectively. Finally the total product cost of methanol is calculated by dividing total annual cost by annual production of methanol as follows: (11) Total Product Cost $ kmol = Total Annual Cost ( $ / year ) Annual Production ( kmol / year )"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Energy balances and efficiency calculation,"5.1 Energy balances and efficiency calculation Two different energy conversion efficiencies are defined and calculated for the integrated system: Thermal energy conversion efficiency in the Matiant power plant which is defined below: ( Electrical Energy Output from Matiant Cycle − Electrical Energy Consumption in O 2 Units ) Chemical Energy Input to Matiant Cycle The electrical energy produced by renewable source is stored in the form of chemical energy in methanol as lower heating value. The efficiency of this energy conversion is considered as efficiency of renewable energy conversion in methanol synthesis unit as follows: Chemical Energy Output from Methanol Synthesis Unit ( Electrical Energy Consumption in Methanol and H 2 Units + Renewable Electrical Energy Consumption ) The chemical energy terms are based on low heating values. CO2 legislation in fossil fuel power production units decreases the overall efficiency of plants; but in the integrated system, by using oxygen from electrolysis unit, 4% increase in the Matiant power plant efficiency is observed compared with efficiency of combine cycle power plant with oxy-fuel combustion carbon capture. Conversion efficiency of renewable energy into chemical energy in the methanol production process via CO2 recovery and renewable hydrogen depends on energy consumption in the whole system (i.e. carbon capture technology of fossil fuel power plant, H2 utilization, H2 and CO2 storage and compression units and methanol synthesis unit). The value of the mentioned efficiencies and energy balances are presented in Table 5 ."
8,Economic evaluation and total product cost estimation,"5.2 Economic evaluation and total product cost estimation Fixed capital investment and total product cost for each unit of the integrated system are estimated as shown in Table 6 . In the Matiant electricity cost calculation, the annual operating costs of the Matiant cycle and oxygen compression and storage units are considered together. Also, in the methanol cost calculation, annual operating cost of renewable energy unit, water electrolysis unit and hydrogen compression and storage units are considered with methanol synthesis unit together. In Table 7 , thermal efficiency, electricity production cost, CO2 avoided cost of the Matiant cycle power plant are shown. The CO2 avoided cost is defined as the difference between the electricity prices of conventional combined cycle power plant as the base plant and zero-emission power plant with oxy-fuel CO2 capture technology when 1tonne of CO2 is produced. The higher capital investment required for compression and storage of oxygen as the by-product of water electrolysis unit and supplying the make-up oxygen from renewable sources, leads to increased electricity cost in the system as shown in Tables 6 and 7."
9,Conclusion,"Present study is aimed at developing a zero emission integrated system for co-production of both electricity and methanol through CO2 capture in industrial scales using the Matiant cycle power plant. In this way, the captured CO2 from power plant is reacted by renewable hydrogen from water electrolysis unit to produce methanol. The major results of this work include technical feasibility of the integrated system which can result in eliminating CO2 emission. Additionally, when the price of natural gas is 7.8US$/GJ, the total CO2 avoided cost is 93US$/(tonne of CO2) and methanol production cost is 576US$/(tonne of methanol). The outcome of the integrated system will be 582 millionkWh/year electricity and 228,480 (tonne of methanol)/year with no greenhouse gases exhausted into the atmosphere."
10,Recommendation for future research,"Study on renewable energy storage system for continuous operation of water electrolysis unit, optimization of hydrogen and oxygen compression and storage units, and also study on the effect of incomplete combustion of natural gas in power plant thermal efficiency and methanol synthesis conversion efficiency are the most important researches which are recommended for the future research."
