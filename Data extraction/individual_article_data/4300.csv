0,Introduction,"Rather than depletion of fossil fuels, global warming caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these fuels threatens the human being. Today, use of fossil-sourced fuel is so high that 171,000 kg of coal, 116,000,000 L of gas, and 186,000 L of oil is consumed per second [1]. It is stated that the widely use of bio-fuels instead of fossil fuels will contribute to reduction of GHG emissions in our atmosphere [2]. Biodiesel, one of the bio-fuels, is a renewable energy resource that is overemphasized in order to meet the increasing energy demand for transportation and decrease GHG emissions [3]. When the studies that have been recently conducted in the field of renewable energy are considered, it is seen that excessive emphasis is put on biodiesel, which has arisen as an alternative to the petroleum based fuels. Biodiesel is regarded as a clean and renewable fuel that is considered to develop the agricultural economy as well as reducing the dependency on the petroleum-originated fuels [4]. Due to the reason that it does not contain sulfur and aromatic, it is not toxic and it is biodegradable, the interest on the use of biodiesel as an alternative fuel in the compression ignition (CI) engines is increasing day by day [5]. Biodiesel can be obtained from different organic resources such as vegetable oils, animal fats, waste oils and algae [6–8]. The characteristics of the biodiesel obtained may vary according to the feedstock and alcohol type used in its production and this may lead to the occurrence of different engine performance and emission values for each biodiesel [9,10]. Accordingly, it is expressed in the literature that, although certain different results are achieved as a result of the use of biodiesel in the CI engines, generally, there is a decrease tendency in PM, HC and CO emissions and there is an increase tendency in NOx emissions [11–13]. The cost of biodiesel that is higher than the petroleum based diesel fuel constitutes an obstacle for it to become commercially widespread. It was notified that approximately 70–85% of the total biodiesel production cost results from the raw material cost (feedstock cost) [14]. Furthermore, in the event that the edible oils (nutritional source) are used as feedstock in the production of biodiesel, the need for agricultural land will increase depending on the cooking oil demand. In this case, the risk of deforestation leads to concerns [15]. Use of waste cooking oils (WCO) instead of raw oils to produce biodiesel is an effective method to reduce raw material costs [16]. The main sources of WCO are frying oil used for cooking at high temperatures and edible fat mixed in kitchen waste. A great quantity of WCO is produced in the houses, restaurants, and food processing industry and fast food stores every day in the world [17]. It is estimated that the potential WCO amount is approximately 0.7–1.0 million tons/year in the European Union (EU) [18]. These wastes cause important waste disposal problems such as polluting river water and blocking of drainage [19]. Therefore, the use of these wastes as a raw material for biodiesel synthesis helps to eliminate and reduce the cost of production [16]. In the literature, various studies were conducted on the testing of the biodiesel obtained from WCO in the CI engines [20–24]. It is understood from the literature, with the WCO biodiesel addition to the diesel fuel, generally while a decrease occurs in the engine torque, the engine power and the break thermal efficiency (BTE), an increase occurs in the break specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). While an increase is seen in the CO2 emissions, the NOx, HC, CO and smoke emissions generally decrease. In addition, it was stated by Al-Dawody et al. [25] and Gad et al. [26] that the in-cylinder pressures (CPs) decrease with the use of the WCO biodiesel. The hydrogen addition to conventional hydrocarbon-originated fuels is recommended to increase the performance and emissions of internal combustion engines (ICE) [27]. It is expressed that the addition of less amount of hydrogen reduces the heterogeneity of the diesel fuel spray as a result of the high diffusion of the hydrogen and makes a more flammable mixture with the homogeneous pre-mixed air [28]. Hydrogen is an environment-friendly, non-toxic, odorless, renewable and recyclable alternative fuel, which generates only water as the combustion product as a result of its combustion with oxygen [29–31]. Due to the reason that harmful products such as hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide are not generated as a result of the combustion of hydrogen. Because of that, it provides positive contribution to the air quality [4,32,33]. Hydrogen has many advantages such as higher flame speed, low ignition energy, rapid diffusion rate, wide flammability limit and low quenching distance as compared with the hydrocarbon-originated fuels [34–37]. These advantages of hydrogen have ensured that it can be burnt even under the insufficient conditions for combustion [38]. In addition, the studies on the effect of hydrogen addition to the CI engine fueled with neat biodiesel and biodiesel-diesel fuel blends have been comprehensively examined and presented in Table 1 . It has been seen that an improvement has been observed again with hydrogen addition in the engine performance and the exhaust emissions, which deteriorated with using biodiesel in general. However, as seen in Table 1, with the use of hydrogen in CI engines, the NOx emissions increased while other emissions decreased in general. According to Hamdan et al. [39] hydrogen enrichment slightly increases CPs. It has been seen from the literature review that, limited researches have been conceded on using hydrogen as a tertiary fuel in a CI engine fueled with diesel-biodiesel fuel blends. Besides, it was observed that, instead of the commercial CI engine widely used today, single-cylinder, lower power test engines are generally used. In the study, it is aimed to determine the effect of hydrogen addition on the performance and emissions of a commercial CI engine, fueled with diesel-waste cooking oil biodiesel (B25) fuel blends. The target is improving the performance and emissions of biodiesel fueled CI engine with hydrogen addition and determining the optimum hydrogen addition rate. Also, the CPs characteristics were investigated. For this purpose, tests were conducted without any regulations in ECU and modifications at the engine. The tests were performed at different engine loads (40, 60, and 80 Nm) and constant engine speed (1750 rpm). For each diesel and B25 fuel tests, hydrogen was added into the intake air at the flow rates of 10, 20, 30 and 40 lpm by volume."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Test fuels,"2.1 Test fuels In this study conducted, B25 (25% biodiesel + 75% diesel) was obtained by adding biodiesel at the rate of 25% by volume to the diesel fuel. In the cases where the test engine was fueled with diesel and B25 fuels, hydrogen was added into the intake air at the flow rates of 10, 20, 30 and 40 L/min (lpm) and it was designated as H10, H20, H30 and H40 in the study. While the diesel and B25 fuels were injected into the cylinders as the main fuel, the hydrogen, however, was taken into the cylinders by being mixed with the intake air via a mixing chamber placed between the turbocharger and the air filter. In the study, the biodiesel fuel obtained from the WCOs was used. The WCO biodiesel was supplied from Tarımsal Biyodizel Enerji company, which was founded in Kocaeli/Turkey in 2014. The physical and chemical properties of the fuels are given in detail in Table 2 . When Table 2 was examined, it was seen that the properties of the WCO biodiesel are within the limits of the standard EN 14214. Diesel, biodiesel and diesel-biodiesel blend (B25) fuels used in the study were analyzed in terms of physical and chemical properties in Inonu University Fuel/Petroleum Analysis Laboratory accredited according to ISO 17025. Properties of test fuels and test methods are given in Table 3 ."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup For the engine tests, a four-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, 1.461-L, turbocharged CI engine with the common rail fuel injection system was used. The certain technical specifications of the test engine are given in Table 4 . The intake air, engine oil, fuel, exhaust, cooling water inlet and outlet temperatures of the CI engine used in the experimental study were measured by using K-type thermocouples. For the loading of the test engine at different engine loads, a water-cooled eddy current dynamometer was used. The schematic view of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 1 . The experimental setup used in the study was presented in detail in reference [53]. In order to reduce the pressure of the hydrogen stored in a high-pressure hydrogen tube to 1 bar, a pressure regulator was used. A flame arrestor valve of the Gunes brand was placed onto the hydrogen pipeline against the probability of any backfire. The flame arrestor acts like no-return valve to quench the flame. The hydrogen flow rate was controlled with a valve and the flow rate of the gas was measured with a digital mass flow meter with 1% lpm sensitivity. The hydrogen enrichment process can be performed by three different methods, namely continuously induction to the intake manifold, indirect injection into the intake manifold and direct injection into the combustion chamber [32,54]. It is expressed that inducting hydrogen to the intake manifold is the most appropriate method in the hydrogen-diesel dual fueled CI engines within these methods [55]. For this purpose, a mixer chamber was used to induct hydrogen in to the intake manifold. The length of the line between turbocharger and mixing chamber was enough for forming a homogeneous hydrogen-air mixture. For measuring the amounts of diesel and B25 fuels used as the main fuel, a calibrated burette and a chronometer were used. The flow rate of the intake air was measured with the digital mass flow meter on the intake line. The hydrogen was used as an additional fuel and the original injection mechanism of the engine was protected. The CP was measured by placing an Oprant OPTD 32288 GPA model air-cooled pressure sensor into the glow plug slot of the first cylinder of the engine. If the raw CP data used, a noisy trend may be seen in the graphics. The noise causes errors in complex calculations, especially when conducting thermodynamic analysis. Therefore, these pressure data need to be smoothed. The equation Eq. (1) was used for correction of instantaneous raw pressure data [56]. In this equation, Pn indicates the pressure data, n indicates the sample number. (1) P n = { ( P n − 1 ) + 2 ( P n ) + ( P n + 1 ) } / 4 The crank position of the engine was determined by using a crank encoder, which produces 360 pulses per minute. For recording the data obtained, a National Instruments 6343 model data collection card was used. In the exhaust emissions measurement process, Bosch BEA 460 emission analysis device was used. The emission analyzer has two modules, namely exhaust gas and smoke emission measurement modules. The characteristics of the exhaust gas analysis device are given in Table 5 . Accuracies of the measurement devices and total uncertainties of the measurements performed in the experimental study were calculated according to the Kline and McClintock method [57,58] and presented in Table 6 ."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure All tests within the scope of the study were performed at the constant speed of 1750 rpm and at the engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm. At the tests performed with the diesel and B25 fuels, hydrogen added into the intake air at the flow rates of 10, 20, 30 and 40 lpm. The energy shares of the hydrogen (HES) was defined as the proportion of the energy of the hydrogen to the total energies of the fuels sent into the cylinder and was calculated with the equation Eq. (2). (2) H E S = m ˙ h y d r o g e n L H V h y d r o g e n m ˙ h y d r o g e n L H V h y d r o g e n + m ˙ f u e l L H V f u e l where, L H V h y d r o g e n and L H V f u e l (MJ/kg) are the lower heating values of hydrogen and other fuels (diesel and B25), m ˙ h y d r o g e n and m ˙ f u e l (kg/h) are the mass flow rates of hydrogen and other fuels, respectively. The energy share ratio of hydrogen to the total energy output was given in Fig. 2 . Before proceeding with the data collection process, the test engine was warmed up to 80 °C to reach steady state conditions. For the purpose of minimizing the uncertainty of the data obtained, the tests were repeated for three times and the evaluations were made by taking the average of the data obtained."
5,Results and discussion,"In this research it was aimed to determine the effect of the hydrogen enrichment on the BSFC, EGT, volumetric efficiency, CP and the THC, NOx, CO2, smoke, O2 characteristics of the CI engine fueled diesel and B25 fuels."
6,Engine performance characteristics,"3.1 Engine performance characteristics In this section, the effect of the hydrogen addition on the BSFC, the volumetric efficiency and the EGT is presented and interpreted in the form of graphics by the different engine load and fuels. 3.1.1 Brake specific fuel consumption The BSFC is defined as the proportion of the mass fuel flow rate to the engine power [59]. The BSFC that depends on the characteristics of the fuel is a measure of the effectiveness of the engine in the use of fuel [60]. The variation of BSFC values depending on the different hydrogen fractions and engine loads are given in Fig. 3 . When Fig. 3 was examined, it was seen that the BSFC values obtained for the pure (without hydrogen addition) diesel and the pure B25 fuel tests were considerably close to each other at each engine load. But there were increases at very small rates with the B25 fuel tests as compared with the diesel fuel tests. B25 fuels lower heating value is 1.5% lower than diesel fuels. Because of that BSFCs of diesel fuel and B25 fuel nearly same. In the literature, it is expressed that the BSFC generally increases with the use of biodiesel [4,25,61]. It is seen that BSFC generally exhibit a decrease with the increasing load for each fuel and hydrogen addition. As a result of the increase in the cylinder wall temperatures, the decrease in the ignition delay and accordingly the progress of the combustion, BSFCs showed decreasing tendencies [62]. The similar results were obtained also by Hajlari et al. [63]. Furthermore, the BSFCs showed decreasing tendencies with the hydrogen addition for all tests. With the increased hydrogen addition rate, this decreasing tendency increased much more and the maximum decrease in the BSFC was obtained with the H40 for each engine load and fuel. With H40 condition the decreases in the BSFCs of diesel fuel tests were 11.1%, 12.5% and 7.9%, respectively, for the engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm as compared with the pure diesel fuel tests. Similarly, with H40 condition the decreases in the BSFCs of B25 fuel tests were 6.1%, 11.2% and 6.3%, respectively, for the engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm as compared with the pure B25 fuel tests. The effects of hydrogen on BSFCs obtained in B25 fuel tests were not effective as diesel fuel tests. The combination of lower volumetric heating value of hydrogen and lower heating value of B25 fuel might responsible. At low loads, hydrogen and air mixture was too lean to be ignited by B25 pilot fuel. This was very significant at high loads when the hydrogen mass share was lower. It causes weak ignition and combustion. But in general, hydrogen addition improved the BSFCs compared to the BSFC of pure B25 fuel tests [64]. The homogeneous air-hydrogen mixture was taken into the cylinders caused more power generation and less fuel consumption [45]. Higher flame speed of hydrogen helps improving the mixture formation. This ensures that the in-cylinder pressure and temperature values increase and the combustion enhances. Therefore, decreases occur in the BSFCs [32]. 3.1.2 Volumetric efficiency The volumetric efficiency is calculated by dividing the mass of the air taken into the engine by the air mass that can be taken into the swept volume [65]. The volumetric efficiency is affected by many factors such as fuel type, air/fuel ratio, the fuel vaporization pressure in the intake manifold, temperature of the mixture, pressure of the residual gases, compression ratio, engine speed, design and timing of the intake and exhaust valves [66]. The variation of volumetric efficiency depending on the different hydrogen fractions and engine loads for each diesel and B25 fuels tests are given in Fig. 4 . When Fig. 4 was examined, it was seen that a small increase in volumetric efficiency was observed with the pure B25 fuel tests compared to the pure diesel fuel tests. These increases with the pure B25 fuel tests were 1.1%, 2.4% and 1.5% for engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm, respectively. Similar results were obtained by Yesilyurt et al. [22]. For each fuel, the volumetric efficiency increased as well with the increasing engine load. The increases were between 3.9% and 12.4% for diesel tests and between 4.6% and 12.3% for B25 fuel tests. It was seen that the hydrogen addition had a slightly effect on the volumetric efficiencies (maximum 2.7% for diesel and 1.3% for B25) of the diesel and B25 fuel tests. The amount of hydrogen sent into the cylinders at low engine load (40 Nm) was relatively higher than high engine loads (60 and 80 Nm) (Fig. 2). The hydrogen replaces the intake air [32] and this condition can cause a change in volumetric efficiency. It was observed that volumetric efficiency became stable at high engine loads due to the decrease in hydrogen ratio and increase of turbo efficiency. The engine used in this study was a turbocharged CI engine. As seen in Fig. 4b and c, the efficiency of the turbocharger increased with increasing load, more air was sent into the cylinders and therefore, the volumetric efficiency was over 100%. In addition, combustion partially improves with the hydrogen addition and the exhaust gas temperature increases. Because the turbocharger efficiency and volumetric efficiency increase. 3.1.3 Exhaust gas temperature The EGT in relation to the engine load and hydrogen content are shown in Fig. 5 . In all studies conducted with liquid fuels and hydrogen addition, it was seen that the EGTs increased with the increasing engine load. With the increasing engine load, the amount of the fuel injected into the cylinders increases as well. In this way, more heat is generated and the EGT increases [61,67]. For each engine load, lower EGT was obtained with the studies conducted with the pure B25 fuel as compared with the pure diesel. The decreases that occurred in the EGTs in the studies conducted with the pure B25 were 10.4%, 7.1% and 9.1%, respectively, for the engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm as compared with the pure diesel fuel. When it was compared with diesel fuel tests, it is expressed that the combustion temperatures might decrease due to the lower heating value and high latent heat of vaporization of B25 fuel and in this way; it might decrease the EGT [52]. Furthermore, it ensures earlier complete combustion than the diesel fuel due to the reason that B25 contains O2. This causes a decrease in the EGT [61]. The similar results were obtained by Refs. [52,61,68]. The EGT generally increased with the hydrogen addition at the diesel and B25 fuel tests. It is thought that the unburned hydrogen-air mixture near the cylinder walls extends the combustion duration. The combustion continues to the middle of the expansion stroke and thus, the EGT values increase. On the other hand, EGT decreased only in H10 tests. It is thought that a small amount of H2 is shortened the ignition delay and end of the combustion. The exhaust gas temperature decreased with reduced combustion duration. The literature includes limited number of studies in relation to the change of the EGT with the hydrogen addition to the biodiesel fuel engine. The results obtained show similarity with the study conducted by Rocha et al. [32]. Furthermore, when the studies conducted in relation to the tests with the diesel fueled CI engine in the literature were examined, it was seen that an increase occurred in the EGT with the hydrogen addition [69]. 3.1.4 In-cylinder pressure The CP is one of the most important parameters used in the analysis of a combustion process [70]. The distribution of the in-cylinder mechanical loads that occur as a result of the combustion of the fuel by the crank angle is expressed with the CP curves [71]. The variation of CP values with the hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests for 40, 60 and 80 Nm engine loads based on the crank angle are given in Fig. 6 . When Fig. 6 was examined, it was seen that the CP curve profiles were considerably similar to each other for each fuel tests and the abnormal combustion characteristics such as high pressure raise rates were not observed. Generally, in the studies conducted with the pure diesel fuel, higher peak CP values than the studies conducted with the pure B25 fuels were obtained. The peak CP values decrease due to the poor atomization and insufficient air-fuel mixture caused by the high viscosity and low volatility of biodiesel [72]. As another clarification is the biodiesel has lower heating value than the diesel fuel [25]. Similar results were obtained by Öztürk [73] and Raman et al. [74]. It was seen that the peak CPs increased with the increasing engine load for each single and hydrogen-added studies. As the amount of the fuel injected into the cylinders increases with the increasing engine load at the constant engine speed, also the peak CPs increase [75]. With the increasing hydrogen addition rate for all engine loads the peak CPs increased as well and the maximum peak CP values were obtained with the H40. However, it was also observed that the effect of decreasing HES with increasing load on CPs also decreased. Due to the high flame speed of the hydrogen, the combustion completed rapidly and the CPs increase [32,76]. The experimental results similar to the results obtained from this study were obtained by Ref. [32,54,76–78]. Because of the amount of hydrogen decreased with increased load, the effect of hydrogen on CPs disappeared. The hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests caused a change at the location where the peak CP occurred. The peak CPs came closer to top dead center (TDC) with hydrogen addition at 60 and 80 Nm engine loads for all test fuels. On the other hand, this effect was not seen at 40 Nm engine load. For the engine load of 40 Nm, while the peak CP location moved away from TDC with the hydrogen addition to the diesel fuel, there was no significant change at the peak CP location with the hydrogen addition to the B25 fuel. The similar results were obtained by Yilmaz et al. [54] and Saravanan and Nagarajan [79] and it was expressed that the maximum CPs occurred earlier with the hydrogen enrichment due to the rapid combustion of the hydrogen having a high flame speed (at constant volume). On the other hand, the effect of the hydrogen on the peak CP location is not seen clearly because of the high peak CP obtained with the pilot fuels at 40 Nm engine load. In addition, there were pressure fluctuations especially 40 Nm engine load. It is thought that the reasons of pressure fluctuations seen in the TDC are pilot injection and higher hydrogen amount. These fluctuations were not observed with increasing loads. Because the effects of pilot injection and the hydrogen energy share on the cylinder pressures were lower than main injection."
7,Emission characteristics,"3.2 Emission characteristics In this section, in order to research the effects of the hydrogen addition on the CI engine emissions, the CO2, NOx, THC, O2 and smoke emissions were measured at different loads and hydrogen addition percentages and were presented in graphics. 3.2.1 Carbon dioxide emissions CO2 emission which is a type of greenhouse gas is formed as a result of complete combustion of carbon and oxygen that are present in petroleum based fuels [35]. The effects of the hydrogen addition on the CO2 emission are given in Fig. 7 . With the increasing engine load, for each tests with hydrogen addition, a decrease occurred in the CO2 emission. One of the benefits of the hydrogen using as a fuel in the ICE is decreasing the CO2 emissions [80]. It was seen in Fig. 7, the CO2 emissions showed similar tendencies with hydrogen addition for each test. For pure diesel and pure B25 fuels, an important decrease occurred in the CO2 emissions with the hydrogen addition and the maximum decrease was obtained with the H40. Accordingly, the decreases that occurred in the CO2 emissions of the H40 tests to pure diesel tests were 20.5%, 10.7% and 11.3%, respectively, with the engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm. It was seen that the hydrogen addition was much more effective on the B25 fuel tests because of the oxygen content of B25. According to the studies conducted with diesel and biodiesel fuels, the reason for the decrease in the CO2 emission is that the hydrogen does not consist of the carbon molecule [32,35,81]. Similar results were obtained in the literature [4,32,81–83]. 3.2.2 Nitrogen oxides emissions NOx which is one of the most harmful emissions that the CI engines produce [43], generally consists of 90–95% NO and 5–10% NO2 [80]. The NOx emissions generally occur as a result of the higher combustion temperature, the oxygen concentration in the combustion chamber and the nitrogen’s being exposed to high temperature [80,84,85]. When Fig. 8 was examined, it was seen that the NOx emissions increased with the increasing engine load for each test. With the increasing engine load, more fuel is burned thus the gas temperatures and NOx emissions increase [86]. It was observed that the NOx emission values obtained with pure B25 fuel tests were slightly higher than pure diesel fuel tests. When the studies about using biodiesel in the CI engines in the literature were examined, it was seen that the use of biodiesel generally increases the NOx emissions [61,63,86–88]. As the reasons for the increase in the NOx emissions, the higher cylinder temperatures and the oxygen content of the biodiesel are shown [89]. Another reason is shown as the ignition delay that increased with the use of biodiesel and the more fuel burned in the premixed combustion phase [74]. The NOx emission values of the B25 and diesel fuel tests show similarities with hydrogen enrichment for each engine load. Generally, B25 fuel tests showed higher NOx emissions with the hydrogen addition compared to the diesel fuel tests. Aside from the increase of the combustion temperature with the hydrogen addition, as the combustion process in the CI engines occurs at high oxygen levels, the NOx emissions can show a tendency to increase [32]. It was seen a downward tendency in the NOx emissions with the hydrogen addition at the 40 Nm and 60 Nm engine loads. The ignition delay and the rate of heat release in the pre-mixed combustion phase of diesel fuel decrease with hydrogen addition. Because of that the NOx formation is suppressed [64]. At higher engine loads (80 Nm), the hydrogen addition in diesel and B25 fuel tests generally causes an increase in the NOx emissions. In the literature, while NOx emissions slightly decrease with the hydrogen addition at lower loads, it was stated that an increase can be seen at high loads [30,35,90,91]. The most important reason of that is higher cylinder temperatures due to higher loads. Similar results were obtained by Aldhaidhawi et al. [5] and Graham [92]. 3.2.3 Total hydrocarbon emissions HC emissions occur because of the incomplete combustion of the fuel during the combustion process. As the combustion process occurs rapidly and there’s not enough time for complete combustion, certain unburned fuel can remain in the combustion chamber and this fuel is thrown out through the exhaust system [63]. The HCs, which are among the exhaust gases that are not burned, are generally named as total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions [93]. The effect of hydrogen addition on THC emissions can be seen in Fig. 9 . When Fig. 9 was examined, it was seen that the THC emissions decreased with the increasing engine load for each tests. THC emissions increased with B25 fuel tests compared to pure diesel fuels tests. Because of the low heating value of biodiesel, HC emissions upsurged due to rise of fuel consumption [63]. Srivastava et al. [87], stated that biodiesel poorly mixed with air in the combustion chamber and HC emissions deteriorated. With the hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests, the THC emissions slightly decreased in the first place and then slightly increased with the hydrogen blend rates (especially after H30). In the literature, it was stated that the THC emissions can decrease with the hydrogen addition and the reason for this situation is explained as that the hydrogen does not include any carbon molecules [32,82]. In the study conducted by Talibi et al. [94], the THC emissions raised with the increasing hydrogen amounts. It was stated that this increase was most probably caused by the decrease of the O2 amounts that are taken into the cylinders. When the higher amount of hydrogen burned with pilot diesel fuel, the availability of oxygen reduce. This decrease the local air/fuel ratios. Main diesel fuel is injected into diluted air. This may be the reason of higher THC emission. In addition, homogeneous air-hydrogen mixture near the cylinder walls cannot be burned because of miss fire. 3.2.4 Oxygen emissions The change in O2 emissions of hydrogen enriched diesel and B25 fuel tests depending on the different hydrogen content and engine load are given in Fig. 10 . As it was seen from Fig. 10, due to the reason that the air/fuel ratio decreases with the increasing engine load, the O2 emission decreased for all test conditions [52]. Generally, a decrease occurred in the O2 emission with the hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests at each engine load. This can be clarified that the O2 concentration decreases with the hydrogen addition into the intake air [32]. Whereas the average decrease that occurred in the O2 emissions with the hydrogen addition was 5.6%, 4.0% and 1.7%, respectively, for the engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm in the study conducted with the diesel fuel, the average decrease that occurred with the hydrogen addition was 1.7%, 4.6% and 4.5% in the study conducted with the B25 fuel. Due to the reason that the B25 fuel contains O2, it generally generates a little bit higher O2 emission than the diesel fuel. 3.2.5 Smoke emissions The smoke emission occurs due to the reason that the fuel is not burned completely depending on the factors such as the poor combustion of the fuel, the lack of oxygen, insufficient the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber and the low combustion temperature [63]. The variation of smoke emissions with hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests at variation engine loads are shown in Fig. 11 . When Fig. 11 was examined, the pure B25 fuel exhibited lower smoke emission than the pure diesel fuel for each engine load. These decreases in the smoke emissions were obtained with B25 fuel tests as 12.5%, 8.3% and 28.6%, respectively, for the engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm as compared with the diesel fuel tests. Biodiesel contains excessive oxygen molecules and has a positive effect on the smoke emissions [89]. Furthermore, a significant increase occurred in the smoke emissions obtained for each fuel tests with the increasing engine load. The amount of the fuel taken into the cylinders increases with the increasing engine load and the fact that the fuel is not completely burned increases the smoke emissions [88]. Similar results were achieved in the literature [95–98]. It was seen that generally the smoke emissions increased with the hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests and the maximum increase for both tests was obtained with the H40. In all studies conducted with the B25 fuel with hydrogen addition, lower smoke emissions were obtained compared to all diesel fuel tests. It is expressed that the dilution effect of the hydrogen addition cause and incomplete combustion through the partial pressure of the local oxygen and this situation might increase the smoke emissions [99]. Even though it is considered that the gaseous fuels will produce low smoke emission, the combustion occurs in the rich-mixture area with the addition of hydrogen. As the flame speed of hydrogen is higher than the liquid fuels, it reacts with oxygen more rapidly and easily burns in the premixed combustion phase. Also, hydrogen substitutes the oxygen in the intake air and enriches the mixture and causes more the smoke formation [39]. Zhou et al. [100] stated that hydrogen addition decrease of the oxygen amount in the combustion chamber so smoke emissions increased. With increasing load, not only energy share of hydrogen but also effect of hydrogen on smoke emissions decrease. Also, in the study conducted by Pundir and Kumar [101] it was seen that the smoke emission increased with the increasing hydrogen rate at the 90% engine load."
8,Conclusions,"In this study conducted, the improvement of the engine performance and the emissions was aimed by adding hydrogen into the intake air of the engine fueled with diesel and diesel-biodiesel at diverse rates. The results obtained from the study are given below: ∗ It was found that hydrogen has a positive effect on BSFC for all test conditions and maximum decrease was obtained as 12.5% and 11.2%, respectively, with the H40 for the diesel and B25 fuels. ∗ The increase occurred in the EGT with the hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests. Maximum increases in the EGT for the diesel and B25 fuel tests were obtained as 11.9% and 19.6%, respectively, under the H40 conditions. ∗ It was seen that the CP curve profiles were considerably similar to each other for each fuel tests and abnormal combustion characteristics such as high pressure raise rates were not observed. Generally, the pure diesel fuel exhibited higher peak CP than the pure B25 fuel for all engine loads (the pressure difference varies between 1.5% and 4.1%). An increase occurred in the CP with the hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests. It was seen that the peak CP location came closer to the TDC with the hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests for the engine loads of 60 Nm and 80 Nm except for the 40 Nm. There was no significant change observed in the peak CP location with the hydrogen addition at the B25 fuel tests. ∗ With hydrogen addition to the diesel and B25 fuel tests, a decrease occurred in the CO2 and O2 emissions. The maximum decreases in the CO2 emissions were obtained as 19.2% and 20.5%, respectively, with the H40 for both diesel and B25 fuel tests. ∗ THC and NOx slightly improved with hydrogen addition. Generally, higher NOx emissions were generated with B25 fuel for each engine load and hydrogen flow rates as compared to the diesel fuel tests. While a slight decrease was seen in the THC emissions up to the H30, it slightly increased with the increasing hydrogen amount. ∗ The addition of hydrogen to diesel and B25 fuel tests generally led to an increase in smoke emissions. For each engine load and hydrogen flow rate, in the studies conducted with the B25 fuel, lower smoke emission was exhibited as compared with diesel fuel. ∗ In generally, it was found that the H30 was the optimum condition among the hydrogen addition rates. The research findings clearly indicate that hydrogen enrichment of the intake air of CI engine fueled with neat diesel and diesel-biodiesel blend has a significant role in improving the performance and combustion, and reducing the emissions. In the future research works, the potential environmental and economic benefits of hydrogen fueled CI engines can be analyzed. In addition, obtained findings can be investigated from the sustainability perspective using advanced sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA), exergy and their combinations."
