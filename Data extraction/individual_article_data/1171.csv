0,Introduction,"The use of fossil fuels for energy production has caused severe global environmental issues (Akhtar et al., 2018; Awasthi et al., 2019; Maliutina et al., 2017). One promising way to resolve these issues is to replace fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy. Biomass has been regarded as a viable source of energy, owing to its sustainability, abundance, and low pollution. Pyrolysis is an efficient method for the production of value-added fuel gas, chemical raw materials, and biofuels from biomass (Akhtar et al., 2018; Awasthi et al., 2019). In particular, bio-oil contains highly value-added fine chemicals such as phenolics, aromatic hydrocarbons, furans, etc., which has attracted significant interest among researchers (Huang et al., 2015). However, complex composition and low selectivity of target products in bio-oil significantly limits the efficient utilization of biomass and renders the downstream separation and purification processes costly and time-consuming. In this context, researchers have focused on developing appropriate catalysts for upgrading biomass pyrolysis vapors to increase the selectivity of target compounds. (Lu et al., 2018) used noble metal catalysts to investigated the reforming of pinewood pyrolysis vapors in a Py-GC/MS. They observed that monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were promoted over Mo2N/HZSM-5. (Huang et al., 2015) investigated the optimal experimental conditions during catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust using HZSM-5. They reported that at 500 °C, the concentration of hydrocarbons and the C8-C12 in bio-oil peaked at 58.63 area% and 48.03 area%, respectively. (Guo et al., 2018) investigated the reforming of the volatile matter of rice husk over bio-char and metal-loaded char and reported that the tar conversion reached 92.6% at 800 °C by using the Fe-supported char catalyst. The char-supported metal catalysts also exhibited high selectivity for syngas production. The thermochemical conversion of biomass is an efficient approach to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels for H2 production (Arregi et al., 2018a; Dou et al., 2019). Hydrogen is one of the cleanest energy carriers as its combustion only produces water vapor. Global efforts have been focused on a transition from carbon-based to hydrogen-based energy systems to reduce the ecological and environmental problems caused by the use of fossil energy. However, conventional hydrogen production technologies, including coal gasification and oil/gas reforming, etc. lead to large consumption of fossil fuels (Kırtay, 2011). Biomass gasification and pyrolysis/reforming of vapors have been regarded as the two most effective methods for biomass-based H2 production (Arregi et al., 2018a). The design and configuration of bio-oil reforming reactors affect the process operation and control of the target product (Arregi et al., 2018a; Dou et al., 2019). A range of methods such as fluidized-bed and entrained-flow reactors, thermogravimetric analyzer, Py-GC/MS, and two-stage pyrolysis-reforming reaction systems have been used to investigate the influence of reactor configurations on product distribution (Arregi et al., 2018b; Efika et al., 2012; Maliutina et al., 2018; Maliutina et al., 2017). The majority of published studies on catalytic reforming of bio-oil have focused on traditional heating methods. The alternative is the use of microwave, which offers a more uniform volumetric heating, higher heating rates, and better control of the process variables (An et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2016). Under microwave radiation, heat is generated throughout the entire particle, leading to the formation of a temperature gradient in the particle (Dong et al., 2018a). During microwave heating, the generated volatile matter migrates from high-temperature particle interior to a lower temperature zone in the particle surroundings, which minimizes the secondary thermal cracking of tar molecules. Microwave pyrolysis has also been reported to promote the generation of H2 under fast heating rates (An et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2016). Various types of catalysts have been tested for reforming and upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapors. The commonly used catalyst supports include zeolites, char (Dong et al., 2018a; Guo et al., 2018), metal oxides (Arregi et al., 2018b), and various minerals (Andrade et al., 2018). Metals-based catalysts such as Ni (Lee et al., 2019), Co (Li et al., 2020), Cu (Li et al., 2020), Ce (Palma et al., 2013), Pt (Palma et al., 2013), La (Hufschmidt et al., 2010), and Ru (Ma et al., 2018) have also been reported in the literature. Among the support materials, bio-char and activated carbon are low cost, contain acidic and oxygen functionalities, and a well-developed pore structure (Guan et al., 2016). Carbon-based catalysts also show superior microwave absorption capacities, leading to faster heating rates and lower energy requirements. Activated carbon has been used as a catalyst support in tar upgrading and reforming, where tar conversions of as high as 96% have been achieved at 850 °C (Dong et al., 2018b). Catalytic reforming of biomass volatile matter under conventional heating conditions has been extensively investigated, while the information on in-situ reforming of microwave pyrolysis vapors is scarce, especially using Fe-loaded activated carbon catalyst. Furthermore, the main challenge in catalytic upgrading of the released volatile matter is the low selectivity of target products. Therefore, this study focused on better understanding the reforming mechanism of biomass pyrolysis vapors over Fe/AC catalyst under microwave pyrolysis conditions. The primary objective was to control the secondary gas-phase reactions for enhancing the formation of H2 and fine chemicals. The changes in reaction pathways during catalytic reforming of pyrolysis volatile matter in the presence of Fe/AC catalysts were also studied systematically by using representative model compounds that were detected in bio-oil. Pyrolysis products were characterized in detail by several techniques to understand the role of Fe in the in-situ upgrading of volatile matters and the selectivity of target products. The findings of this study can be used to develop a practical approach for selective poly-generation of H2-rich biogas and chemical raw materials from biomass through microwave pyrolysis."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sample properties,"2.1 Sample properties Palm kernel shell (PKS) from Malaysia with a top size of 1 mm was used in this study. The properties of the sample are given in Table 1 . Silicon carbide (SiC) was mixed with the sample to reach the desired pyrolysis temperatures. The sample was dried in an oven at 80 °C and stored in air-tight containers. Analytical grade phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy- (syringol) (CAS No. 91-10-1) and phenol, 2-methoxy- (guaiacol) (CAS No. 90-05-1) were purchased from Aladdin Co. Ltd. in analytical grade and used as the model compounds to study the pyrolysis reaction pathways. The coconut shell-based activated carbon (AC) sample was purchased from Tianjin Dengke Corporation, China."
3,Preparation and characterization of catalyst,"2.2 Preparation and characterization of catalyst The Fe(NO3)3·9H2O aqueous solution was used to synthesize the Fe/AC catalysts. Catalysts with different Fe concentrations (0.0 wt%, 1 wt%, 2.0 wt%, and 4.0 wt%, respectively) were synthesized as follows: the iron nitrate solution was prepared by dissolving the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O into deionized water. Activated carbon was then added and mixed for 4 h at 50 °C using an ultrasonic apparatus, followed by drying overnight at 105 °C in a vacuum oven. The catalysts were activated at 800 °C for 1 h under nitrogen (99.999%, 200 ml/min) in a quartz reactor. The samples were defined as AC, 1%-Fe/AC, 2%-Fe/AC, and 4%-Fe/AC based on the amount of Fe loaded. The content of Fe in the catalyst was measured using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (Beijing Haiguang WLY100-1 ICP-AES). The phase analysis of the samples was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with a Cu X-ray tube and in a 2θ range of 10-90° at 2°/min. The pore structure of catalysts was tested by isothermal N2 adsorption in a Vsorb 4800P apparatus. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods were used to determine the specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution from the N2 adsorption isotherms."
4,Catalytic reforming experiments,"2.3 Catalytic reforming experiments The experimental apparatus used for catalytic reforming of PKS pyrolysis volatile matter is shown in Fig. 1 . The tests were conducted at 500 °C for 30 min using a two-stage quartz reactor (50 mm ID) and a 2.0 kW microwave oven (Tangshan Microwave Thermal Instrument CO. Ltd., China). PKS (ca. 10.0 g) and SiC were blended at a mass ratio of 10:2 before loading to the reactor. A K-type thermocouple measured the sample bed temperature. Nitrogen (99.999%) at 400 ml/min was used to carry the volatile matter out of the reactor and through three water-cooled condensers. The tar fraction was captured by Dichloromethane (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). The organic tar and dichloromethane phases were then separated by distillation. Gas bag was used to collect the light gas fraction. The yields of bio-char and bio-oil were obtained by direct weighing, while the gas yield was calculated by difference. The pyrolysis runs were repeated two times to calculate the experimental error and ensure the reproducibility of the results. When using model compounds, a vaporizer set at the boiling points of the compounds was used to convert them into the gaseous phase. The SiC and 2%-Fe/AC catalyst (ca. 10.0 g) were used during the thermal cracking and catalytic reforming tests involving the model compounds. Approximately 0.1 g of syringol or guaiacol were heated to their boiling points of 265 °C and 205 °C in the vaporizer, respectively. The generated vapors were carried to the SiC/catalyst bed by nitrogen gas. The catalytic reforming experiments of model compounds were conducted for 30 min, after which the products were collected and subjected to detailed characterization."
5,Analysis of pyrolysis products,"2.4 Analysis of pyrolysis products The bio-oil generated during pyrolysis tests was analyzed by GC–MS (Thermo Scientific ISO) with a TR-5MS coated capillary column (30 m length and 0.25 mm inner diameter). The instrument was equipped with a quadrupole analyzer (70 eV). He (0.2 ml/min) was applied as the carrier gas. Dichloromethane was used as the solvent in GC–MS measurements. The concentration of compounds was obtained from area% data (An et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015). The light gas fraction containing CO, CO2, H2, CH4, and C1-C4 was analyzed by GC (TRACE 1300, Thermo Scientific ISQ) with a TCD detector and a molecular sieve column. The GC column was heated at 40 °C for 3 min, followed by ramping to 200 °C (10 °C/min) and holding for 4 min."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The crystalline phases associated with the Fe/AC catalysts were analyzed by XRD. The XRD spectra of the fresh activated carbon sample showed broad peaks typical of amorphous carbon. A lower intensity peak at about 2θ = 26.7 corresponded to SiO2 inherently present in the activated carbon sample. Compared with the fresh activated carbon, it was apparent that the active Fe species were present as dominant phases of α-Fe and γ-Fe. The diffraction peaks of α-Fe appeared at 44.54°, 65.01°, and 82.25°, while those of γ-Fe were detected at 43.47°, 50.78°, and 74.56°. The occurrence of the elemental Fe phase was attributed to the strong reducing effect of carbon during the activation of Fe/AC catalysts at 800 °C under nitrogen (Guo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). (Zhang et al., 2015) observed that elemental metals may form due to deoxidation effect of activated carbon support during the preparation of the catalyst. According to the Fe-C phase diagram, α-Fe and γ-Fe may co-exist at 700–900 °C. After the activation of catalysts at 800 °C in this study, the sample was taken out and cooled down rapidly, which led to the preservation of γ-Fe in the sample. The XRD curves of the 2%-Fe/AC catalyst after reforming tests showed that the α-Fe and γ-Fe phases did not change after catalytic pyrolysis experiments and were present in the metallic form in the used catalyst, possibly owing to the reducing effect of activated carbon. (Torres et al., 2007) reported that elemental Fe is one of the most reactive species in cracking of large tar molecules. Table 2 shows the theoretical and actual Fe content in the Fe/AC catalyst samples, as measured by the ICP. As seen, the actual Fe content corresponded well with the theoretical values. The analysis of the physical structure of the Fe/AC catalysts showed a large surface area and well-developed pore structure, especially in the micropore region, which significantly affects their reactivity (Bu et al., 2013). BET surface area of 789.72 m2/g and micropore volume of 0.36 cm3/g were obtained for the AC. Iron loading enhanced the physical structure of the catalysts, which for 2%-Fe/AC reached a surface area of 912.4 m2/g and pore volume of 0.42 cm3/g. Further increasing of Fe content of the catalyst to 4 wt% led to a slight reduction in the BET surface area and micropore volume, possibly as a result of the agglomeration of active species and blockage of pores (Yang et al., 2019)."
8,The yields of pyrolysis products,"3.2 The yields of pyrolysis products Product yields during catalytic microwave pyrolysis tests were determined to evaluate the extent to which the catalysts affected the volatile matter (Fig. 2 a). The proportions of bio-char, bio-oil, and biogas during the non-catalytic test were about 54.65 wt%, 21.04 wt% and 24.31 wt%, respectively. As expected, the yield of bio-char remained relatively constant during catalytic reforming and thermal cracking experiments, mainly because the catalyst only affected the secondary pyrolysis reactions in the gas phase. During catalyst reforming tests, the yield of the light gas fraction was drastically increased, which was attributed to the secondary cracking of tar molecules over Fe/AC catalysts, leading to the generation of light gaseous species (Di Stasi et al., 2019). Using the Fe/AC catalysts, the yield of bio-oil decreased to as low as 7.96 wt%, while the yield of biogas reached 37.09 wt%. The tar conversions during the catalytic reforming and thermal cracking experiments were calculated in comparison with the non-catalytic tests, and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. When passed through the hot SiC bed, the thermal decomposition of tar was promoted, reaching a tar conversion of 19.2%. However, significantly higher tar conversion was achieved over AC and Fe/AC catalysts. Tar conversion reached 53.23% when AC was used as the catalyst. The addition of Fe was found to further enhance the tar conversion, which peaked at 62.17% when using the 4%-Fe/AC. The well-developed pore structure of the catalyst and the presence of active metallic Fe catalyst promoted the catalytic cracking of large tar molecules to generate light gases (Guo et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2015). It can be concluded that Fe-loaded activated carbon catalysts exhibited a high reactivity for the reforming of pyrolysis volatile matter. Metallic iron is known to catalyze the cracking of C–C and C–H bonds (Virginie et al., 2010)."
9,Characterization of bio-oil,"3.3 Characterization of bio-oil Fig. 3 and Table 3 compare the characteristics of bio-oil in the presence and absence of the catalyst. The GC–MS peak areas of different chemical compounds were used to comparatively investigate the impact of catalysts on the composition of bio-oil during reforming experiments (Lam et al., 2017). The chemical compounds were categorized into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aliphatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, and esters. As seen in Fig. 3 and Table 3, the non-catalytic PKS bio-oil contained about 60.85 area% phenolics. Aldehydes and ketones (8.01 area%), esters (4.91 area%), carboxylic acids (6.08 area%), and aliphatic hydrocarbons (5.03 area%) were the other organic species in the bio-oil. (Kim et al., 2010) and (Omoriyekomwan et al., 2016) also observed that phenolic compounds were formed during the pyrolysis of PKS, which was attributed to the high proportion of lignin in the biomass structure. Upon thermal decomposition, lignin is converted into methoxyphenyl and phenolic radicals (Kim et al., 2010). The main phenolics formed during non-catalytic PKS microwave pyrolysis were phenol, phenol, 2-methyl-, p-cresol, phenol, 3-methyl-, phenol, 2-methoxy-, phenol, 3,4-dimethyl-, phenol, 4-ethyl-, catechol, phenol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxy-, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy-, and phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(1-propenyl)-, where phenol had the highest concentration (34.91 area%). The phenolics contained alkyl- (methyl-, ethyl-, propenyl-, vinyl-, etc.) and CH3O– side chains as well as compounds containing both alkyls- and CH3O– groups. The main aliphatic hydrocarbons detected in bio-oil were eicosane, heptadecane, and 2,6,10,15-tetramethyl-. Aromatic hydrocarbons included monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PAHs, with concentrations of 0.72 area% and 1.78 area%, respectively. The high concentrations of aliphatic oxygen-containing species in bio-oil was due to the high O/C ratio of the PKS biomass (Wang et al., 2015). The oxygen-containing compounds may form during the thermal cracking of cellulose and hemicellulose in lignocellulosic biomass (Zheng et al., 2014). SiC and AC were found to significantly alter the composition of bio-oil by reforming PKS volatile matter. As seen in Fig. 3, the thermal cracking of volatile matter in the hot SiC promoted the generation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolics, reaching 7.61 area% and 77.21 area%, respectively. Fig. 3 also shows that the formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolics, and PAHs were enhanced over AC, which was accompanied by a reduction in aliphatic hydrocarbons and O-containing compounds. Fe loading further hindered the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols, while the concentration of phenolics increased to the range of 79.08–86.98 area%, peaking at 86.98 area% using the 1%-Fe/AC catalyst. Similarly, the concentration of phenol peaked at 75.65 area%. External standards were used to calibrate the GC–MS and obtain the phenol yield under different test conditions. The yield of phenol during non-catalytic pyrolysis was 2.28 mg/g.PKS. When the volatile matter was passed through the upper reactor bed containing SiC, AC, 1%-Fe/AC, 2%-Fe/AC, and 4%-Fe/AC, the yield of phenol increased to 3.11, 4.02, 5.17, 5.09, and 4.83 mg/g.PKS. The highest phenol yield of 5.17 mg/g.PKS was obtained during reforming over the 1%-Fe/AC catalyst. It can be concluded that a high selectivity of phenol was achieved over the Fe/AC catalysts. Phenol-rich bio-oil is extremely attractive to replace petroleum-based phenol after purification (Kim et al., 2010; Omoriyekomwan et al., 2016). The complexity of bio-oil decreased in the presence of SiC and Fe/AC (Table 3). During the non-catalytic tests, only the bottom bed was loaded with the sample, and upon heating, the generated volatile matter moved from the hot-bed zone to the lower temperature surrounding environment. Under these conditions, the primary pyrolysis reactions determined the product composition. Conversely, in the presence of the second catalyst bed, the pyrolysis vapors passed through the second hot-bed, undergoing secondary pyrolysis reactions, which further altered their composition. The demethoxylation, demethylation, and deoxygenation of pyrolysis vapors took place during the secondary pyrolysis reactions over the catalyst, leading to the lower complexity of the bio-oil and biogas. Thermal cracking of volatile matter over hot SiC bed increased the concentration of phenol to 46.11 area%. Whereas, alkylphenols such as phenol, 2-methyl-, p-cresol, phenol, 3,4-dimethyl-, phenol, 4-ethyl-, phenol, 2,5-dimethyl-, etc., were not detected, which suggested that high temperatures promoted the dealkylation of alkylphenols. When Fe/AC catalysts were used, the concentration of compounds containing both methoxyl and methyl groups, such as phenol, 2-methoxy-, 1,2-benzenediol, 3-methoxy-, phenol, 4-ethyl-2-methoxy-, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy-, phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(1-propenyl)-, 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene decreased dramatically, and some were not detected after catalytic reforming. In contrast, the concentration of phenol and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (ethylbenzene, xylene, etc.) were greatly increased, suggesting that the Fe/AC catalysts promoted the demethoxylation and demethylation reactions under the catalytic reforming conditions. Fe-based catalysts have also been reported to enhance the cyclization and aromatization of generated alkyl groups to form aromatics and phenolics (Yang et al., 2019). The radicals generated during the cracking of methyl and methoxyl side chains may be stabilized by H-donation from the radicals generated during the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose, thus forming lower molecular weight species. The PKS pyrolysis results suggested that Fe/AC catalysts promoted the formation of phenolics by H-donation from hydroxyl groups. Similar H-donation reactions have also been reported by (Hosoya et al., 2008; Vuori, 1986). Catalytic reforming of PKS volatile matter using Fe/AC catalysts was also found to generate a small amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, primarily naphthalene and its derivatives, which can be attributed to the secondary catalytic polymerization of aromatic rings (Gong et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2015). Activated carbon is known to be a good microwave absorber, forming hot spots under microwave radiation, which in turn could promote the polymerization reactions (Mamaeva et al., 2016; Omoriyekomwan et al., 2016). The higher temperatures generated within the sample may also favor the heterogeneous catalytic reactions over the Fe/AC catalyst particles (Dong et al., 2017)."
10,Biogas analysis,"3.4 Biogas analysis Fig. 4 compares the concentration of light gases formed during the catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of PKS. Under non-catalytic conditions, H2, CO, and CO2 were the main gaseous components during PKS pyrolysis with volumetric concentrations of 38.99, 32.46, and 24.66 vol%, respectively. CO and CO2 were generated by the cleavage of carbonyl and carboxyl functionalities in cellulose and lignin in PKS structure (Park et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2015). The generation of H2 can be related to radical poly-condensation and dehydrogenation of pyrolysis vapors (Porada, 2004). Besides, the de-polymerization of phenyl groups in lignin and hydrocarbons may also lead to H2 formation (Park et al., 2010). The concentration of CH4 in the PKS biogas was approximately 3.89 vol%. CH4 was mainly generated by cracking of aliphatic structures and decomposition of methoxy functionalities (Blanco López et al., 2002). When volatile matter passed through the hot SiC bed, thermal cracking substantially changed the biogas composition. Under these conditions, the concentration of CO2 decreased, while the formation of H2 and CH4 was enhanced. The decrease in the CO2 concentration was due to incomplete thermal decomposition of oxygen functionalities (e.g., carbonyl group in aldehydes and ketones). The dealkylation of alkylphenols in tar during secondary cracking reactions at high temperatures favored the generation of CH4, which was consistent with the changes in bio-oil as discussed above. Fig. 4 shows that the Fe/AC catalyst enhanced the generation of H2 and CH4 while the concentration of CO was drastically hindered. The concentration of H2 in the light gas fraction during catalytic reforming tests was in the range of 59.14–75.12 vol%, which increased from 38.99 vol% during non-catalytic pyrolysis and peaked at 75.12 vol% in the presence of 2%-Fe/AC. The relative increase in the volumetric concentration of CH4 during catalytic reforming was due to the removal of methyl and methoxy functionalities during thermal decomposition of lignin via C-O bond rupture (Xu et al., 2016). The concentration of CH4 increased from 3.89 vol% under non-catalytic pyrolysis conditions to 8.49 vol% in the presence of AC and peaked at 11.23 vol% when 1%-Fe/AC was used as the catalyst. These results suggested that Fe/AC catalysts stabilized the methyl and methoxy radicals by promoting the hydrogen donation. Based on the combined results from bio-oil and biogas analysis, the 2%-Fe/AC catalyst was regarded as the optimum catalyst for selective poly-generation of phenol and H2 from PKS in the two-stage reactor under microwave heating conditions."
11,Mechanism of catalytic reforming of volatile matter,"3.5 Mechanism of catalytic reforming of volatile matter As discussed above, the Fe/AC catalysts selectively promoted the formation of phenol and H2. In this part of the study, syringol and guaiacol were chosen as the model compounds and subjected to the catalytic reforming tests. The main objective was to better understand the impact of catalyst on the reaction pathways during reforming of volatile matter. Syringol and guaiacol were present in the non-catalytic bio-oil; however, they were not detected in the catalytically reformed bio-oil (Table 3). In this set of experiments, the model compounds were converted into the gaseous state in a vaporizer before passing through either hot SiC or Fe/AC catalyst bed, where the former was used as the control experiment to evaluate the impact of 2%-Fe/AC catalyst on the reforming reactions of volatile matter. The composition of the oil derived from thermal cracking and catalytic reforming of syringol and guaiacol are shown in Table 4 . In the presence of hot SiC bed at 500 °C, the model compounds underwent thermal cracking to generate bio-oils with a complex composition and containing compounds such as single-ring aromatics (ethylbenzene, o-Xylene, phenylethyne, styrene, 3-methylphenylacetylene), PAHs (naphthalene, naphthalene, 2-methyl-, biphenyl, phenanthrene), benzofurans (benzofuran, benzofuran, 2-methyl-), benzaldehydes (benzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-, benzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-, 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde), and phenols (phenol, phenol, 2-methyl-, phenol, 2-ethyl-), etc. The phenol concentration during non-catalytic pyrolysis of syringol and guaiacol was only 6.83 area% and 9.75 area%, respectively. The tar conversion reached 60.89% and 74.72% for syringol and guaiacol during the thermal cracking process, respectively. The reaction pathways during the thermal cracking of syringol and guaiacol are proposed in Fig. 5 a. At elevated temperatures, the demethoxylation of syringol forms Ӧ, C H 3 ̇ , and guaiacol radicals (a1), which further stabilize through reaction with hydrogen to form guaiacol. Guaiacol may further undergo demethoxylation reaction to generate Ӧ, C H 3 ̇ , and phenyl radicals (a2). The reaction of phenyl radicals with either hydrogen or methyl radicals may lead to the formation of phenol (a3) or phenol, 2-methyl- (a4). Another possible pathway is the demethylation of guaiacol to form catechol radical (a5), which further generates catechol through hydrogenation. The methoxyl group detached from guaiacol may also create Ḣ, Ȯ, and CH . . . radicals (a7). Benzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy- may then be formed through the reaction of Ȯ, CH . . . , and phenyl radicals (a6). The formation of PAHs was mainly attributed to the dehydration and cyclization at high temperatures (a8). Furthermore, the demethoxylation and isomerization reactions may lead to the generation of ethylbenzene and styrene (a9). The 2%-Fe/AC catalyst drastically decreased the complexity of liquid fraction, leading to an improved selectivity of some compounds. When syringol was used as the model compound, the liquid fraction mainly contained phenol (53.16 area%) and guaiacol (42.42 area%). When guaiacol was passed through the 2%-Fe/AC catalyst bed, phenol (80.32 area%), phenol, 2-methyl- (6.43 area%), and catechol (5.58 area%) dominated the liquid product. These results showed that phenol was the primary product during catalytic reforming of syringol and guaiacol over the Fe/AC catalyst, which was consistent with the result obtained during catalytic reforming of PKS pyrolysis volatile matter (Table 3). The proposed reaction pathways during catalytic reforming and the thermal cracking of model compounds are summarized in Fig. 5b and 5c. The observation that phenol was formed during catalytic reforming of syringol and guaiacol suggested that the 2%-Fe/AC catalyst exhibited a high demethoxylation reactivity. As shown in Fig. 5b, the dissociative adsorption of syringol (b1) on the Fe/AC catalyst led to the formation of Ȯ, C H 3 ̇ , and guaiacol radicals, which then reacted with hydrogen radicals to form H2O, CH4, and guaiacol (b2). The guaiacol formed from syringol may further undergo dissociative adsorption on the Fe active sites to form Ȯ, C H 3 ̇ , and phenyl radicals (b3), the hydrogenation of which forms H2O, CH4, and phenol (b4). Another possible pathway as suggested by the compounds detected in the syringol oil is the formation of Ḣ, Ȯ, C ̇ H , and phenyl radicals. The Ȯ and C ̇ H radicals may further react to form O = C H ̇ radical, which in turn can form benzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy- by reacting with the phenyl radical. Phenol was the main product during the catalytic reforming of guaiacol, as shown in Table 4. Demethoxylation of guaiacol over the Fe/AC catalyst, followed by hydrogenation of the phenyl radical, may lead to the generation of phenol as discussed above (Fig. 5c). Alternatively, the phenyl radicals formed by dissociative adsorption of guaiacol on Fe active sites may react with methyl radical to form phenol, 2-methyl- (c4). Catechol was also detected during the catalytic upgrading of guaiacol (Table 4). Catechol may be formed through the reaction between catechol radical (generated as a result of demethylation of guaiacol (c5)) and a Ḣ radical (c6). The above results showed that one major formation pathway of phenol over Fe/AC is the complete decomposition of methoxy groups in the model compounds. (Olcese et al., 2012) also reported that demethoxylation of guaiacol is a favored reaction over the Fe-based catalysts. (Tan et al., 2017) suggested that the dehydrogenation of the –CH3 is more likely to take place than the breakage of the C-O bond, followed by hydrogenation of phenoxy radicals to form phenol. The cleavage of Calkyl-O bond in the methoxy group, may also generate phenol (Teles et al., 2018). The demethoxylation and decarbonylation reactions are catalyzed by Fe nanoparticles, which facilitate the supply of H radicals. The high rates of demethoxylation observed over the Fe/AC catalyst can be explained by strong oxophilicity of Fe active sites and its interaction with oxygen from the methoxy groups that facilitate the dissociative adsorption of the primary pyrolysis vapors (Fig. 5b and c) (Hensley et al., 2015). (Guo et al., 2019) also reported the promotion of hydrodeoxygenation of p-cresol over Fe active sites. Water and methane are also generated as a result of catalytic guaiacol decomposition via hydrogen donation to methyl and oxygen radicals. A combination of these reactions led to the generation of phenol as the main product of catalytic reforming of biomass pyrolysis volatile matter. Table 5 presents the concentrations of H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 during catalytic reforming and the thermal cracking of model compounds. Similar to the catalytic reforming of PKS pyrolysis volatile matter, H2 was the main component of the biogas. However, CO was not detected in the biogas fraction, which was also consistent with the result obtained during catalytic reforming of PKS volatile matter. The generation of CH4 and CO2 over the catalyst was attributed to the release and stabilization of the methoxy and C = O groups."
12,Conclusions,"The Fe/AC catalyst was found to significantly enhance the yield of biogas during catalytic reforming of PKS volatile matter under microwave irradiation. Using the 2%-Fe/AC catalyst, the concentration of phenol in the liquid fraction reached 75.09 area%, while H2 peaked at 75.12 vol% in the bio-gas. The reaction mechanisms under catalytic reforming conditions were studied by using syringol and guaiacol as the model compounds. The results showed that the Fe/AC catalyst enhanced the demethoxylation, demethylation, and deoxygenation reactions during catalytic reforming of volatile matter, leading to a drastic increase in the selectivity of phenol and H2 formation."
