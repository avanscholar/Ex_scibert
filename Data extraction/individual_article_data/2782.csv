0,Introduction,"Higher intake pressures (“boosted” operation) have offered enhanced power density and reduced fuel consumption in gasoline spark-ignition (SI) engines relative to naturally aspirated engines [1]. Boosted SI engines operate in conventional flame propagation combustion modes at low temperatures (<1000 K) in the low-speed and high-load regime (compressed pressures greater than 20 bar). Moreover, higher compressions ratios can be enabled by adding alcohols to gasoline fuel, due to their high research octane number (RON) and octane sensitivity, thus further increasing the benefits of boosted SI operation. Actually, these engines may operate on fuel lean or near stoichiometric mixtures of gasoline blends containing small (C2-C4) alcohols within the next decade [2]. The U.S. Department of Energy's Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) initiative [2] has identified four saturated alcohols out of the ten most promising blendstocks for commercialization as gasoline components. These ten promising blendstocks possess chemical and physical properties that enable higher compression ratio engine designs. Higher compression ratio engines are generally more thermally efficient and produce fewer emissions. Four of these ten blendstocks are small alcohols, namely ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol and iso-butanol. While ethanol has been a gasoline component for many years [3], longer chain alcohols proved to be suitable alternatives. Bio-alcohols, such as the propanol and butanol isomers, have higher energy density, lower water absorption, better miscibility with conventional fuels, and lower corrosivity than ethanol [4]. Among the C3-C4 alcohols, the viability of n-butanol and iso-butanol in SI [5,6], diesel [7,8], and homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines [9] has been investigated, as well as the engine performances of n- and isopropanol/gasoline blends in both a direct injection SI [10] and HCCI engine [11]. For instance, in a recent study [12] the predictability of four kinetic models for n-butanol and iso-butanol was assessed using a single-zone engine model and compared to experiments conducted in a HCCI engine. The authors concluded that the existing models were unable to accurately capture the low temperature combustion seen in HCCI engines. Thus, this work seeks to refine the low-temperature chemistry of C3-C4 linear and iso-alcohols considering recent rate constant calculations and measurements. Ignition delay times (IDT) of these alcohols in neat and blended mixtures were recently measured for the first time at engine-relevant conditions from a rapid compression machine (RCM) [13,14]. Combustion and pyrolysis of these alcohols were also studied experimentally by many groups across different facilities. However, this work will focus mainly on autoignition data and additional validations are included as Supplemental Material. Shock tube (ST) measurements of IDT are available for neat propanol isomers [15–17], neat n-butanol [18–22] and neat iso-butanol [22,23], but the conditions studied are typically limited to high temperatures (>1000 K). However, RCM studies of neat propanol isomers and their blends with gasoline, at engine-relevant conditions are scarce. Saharin [24] measured the ignition delay times of n-propanol in an RCM at temperatures of 750–860 K and pressure of 35 bar. IDTs of neat butanols in RCMs have been reported [25,26] at lower temperatures and higher pressures, conditions more appropriate to boosted SI engines. However, much of the data to date has been acquired for undiluted, stoichiometric mixtures, less representative of dilute engine operation at low temperatures. For instance, the reactivity of the four butanol isomers was studied in a RCM at 715–910 K, 15 and 30 bar, and at different equivalence ratios by Weber et al. [25,26]. There are also relatively few IDT studies of n-butanol or iso-butanol blended mixtures relevant to gasoline fuels at boosted SI conditions. Kumar et al. [27] studied the autoignition of n-butanol and its blends with primary reference fuels (mixtures of n-heptane and iso-octane) at 613–979 K and 20 bar. The low-temperature ignition behavior of n-butanol and its blends with toluene primary reference fuels (TPRF) was recently investigated in a RCM at 678–916 K and 20 bar [28,29]. Studies of autoignition for iso-alcohols blended with gasoline-like mixtures at low temperatures and high pressures are currently missing in literature. New IDT measurements of neat n-propanol, iso-propanol and iso-butanol and iso-alcohols blends with FACE F (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) were performed in an RCM from 20 to 40 bar and 780–950 K [13,14]. In addition to these experimental studies, there have been multiple efforts in the past to develop kinetic models for the C3-C4 alcohols [30–36], as reviewed by Sarathy et al. [37]. However, there are still uncertainties in the kinetics of both low temperature peroxy chemistry and H-atom abstraction rate constants. Examples of uncertainty can be found in the use of alkane reaction rates for analogous low temperature pathways in alcohols and the lack of site-specific H-atom abstraction rates by small radical abstractors (e.g. OH, HO2). The recent work of Lizardo-Huerta et al. [38], which describes the influence of the hydroxyl group on many unimolecular reactions involving β-HOROO˙ and HOQ˙OOH radicals, gives direct theoretical estimates of kinetic rate constants of important low temperature reactions. Moreover, calculations of rate constants of H-atom abstractions by HO2 for different alcohols molecules were recently published [39-41] and are used herein to improve model predictions. In the kinetic model developed here, emphasis was placed on describing the low temperature chemistry of the four alcohols to capture autoignition. The following sections describe the development and validation of the improved detailed chemical kinetic model, first focusing on their neat behavior and then exploring their autoignition behavior when blended with research grade gasolines."
1,Kinetic model construction,"The base chemistry of AramcoMech 2.0 [42] was used to describe the C0-C4 chemistry. Alcohol chemistry was derived from the work of Sarathy et al. [37] and important revisions to the model are discussed in this section. Thermochemistry of important species involved in the combustion of the alcohols considered have been updated following new group additivity values [43,44]. Reaction rate rules have been applied consistently across the alcohols, as enlisted in Table T1 in the Supplemental Material. Figure 1 shows the most important oxidation pathways of n-butanol at 800 and 1000 K, at 20 bar and ϕ = 1 in air, as representative of alcohol reactivity at boosted SI conditions. Major pathways at high temperature involve β-scission reactions, which for n-butanol were updated based on Zhang et al. [45]. For all the considered alcohols, H-atom abstraction reactions by OH and HO2 radicals are of critical importance and are found to be the most sensitive reactions for ignition delay times at low and intermediate temperatures [29,37]. Recently, McGillen et al. [46] employed a novel approach to derive a self-consistent site-specific set of reaction rate coefficients for all butanol isomers for use in atmospheric and combustion chemistry modeling. The branching fraction of the H-atom abstraction by OH from all sites of n-butanol and iso-butanol was taken from McGillen et al. [46], and by analogy it was applied to n-propanol and iso-propanol too. At the α-site, H-atom abstraction is predominately by HO2 and the rate constant adopted for all alcohols is from Mittal et al. [47]. Kinetic coefficients of H-atom abstraction by HO2 at the β- and γ-sites of n-butanol are taken from the work of Rawadieh et al. [41]. The recently calculated rate constant of H-atom abstraction by HO2 at the β-site of iso-butanol [39] is adopted, while for other sites the values are analogous to 2-butanol estimates [48]. Similar analogies were applied to the rates of H-atom abstraction by HO2 at β- and γ-sites for propanol isomers. Low-temperature reactivity of alcohols is characterized by the competition between chain branching and chain propagating reaction pathways [30]. At low temperatures, O2 addition to hydroxyalkyl radicals are favored pathways for both isomers, leading to the formation of alcohol peroxy radicals (RO2). The kinetics for the addition of O2 have been modelled based on the work of Miyoshi [49]. However, O2 addition at the α-site seldom leads to formation of a stable peroxy adduct and instead predominantly leads to the production of an aldehyde and HO2 via a concerted elimination pathway as reported by da Silva et al. [50]. When formed, RO2 can undergo internal isomerization to produce hydroperoxyl alcohol radicals (QOOH), which compete with the concerted elimination reaction producing enols and HO2 radicals. The QOOH radicals subsequently can react with O2 or undergo unimolecular reactions, such as formation of cyclic ethers and β-decompositions. The rate constants for reaction classes involving β-HOROO˙ and HOQ˙OOH radicals were taken from the work of Lizardo-Huerta et al. [38] when available, or otherwise from reaction rate rules developed by Villano et al. [51,52]. When QOOH reacts with oxygen, it can produce peroxy-hydroperoxy alcohol radicals (Ȯ2QOOH). This can be followed by an isomerization reaction of the Ȯ2QOOH to produce keto-hydroperoxides and eventual chain branching by producing two ȮH radicals from the initial fuel radical. These additional low temperature pathways were modeled by analogy to similar alkane pathways from the work of Mohamed et al. [53]."
2,Numerical simulations,"The kinetic mechanism developed is comprised of 371 species and 2318 reactions and is attached in the Supplemental Material. Ignition delay time simulations used the CHEMKIN closed homogeneous batch reactor module or the LLNL developed solver ZeroRK [54]. RCM simulations included volume histories derived from non-reactive tests to account for compression and heat loss effects. Additional validations in jet-stirred and plug-flow reactors were performed using CHEMKIN, whereas a LLNL developed fast solver was used for laminar flame speed predictions [55]."
3,Results and discussion,"The improved detailed chemical kinetic model developed for the alcohols in this work was validated using fundamental data for ignition, intermediate species and laminar flame speeds from literature. However, the following discussion focuses mainly on their ignition behavior at low-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Additional validations for intermediate species and laminar flame speeds are included in the Supplementary Materials, along with the kinetic model and species dictionary."
4,Autoignition behavior of neat C3-C4 linear and iso-alcohols,"4.1 Autoignition behavior of neat C3-C4 linear and iso-alcohols The ignition delays of neat n-butanol have been measured by different groups in both shock tubes [19-21] and RCMs [25,28], investigating its reactivity at high pressure and low temperature conditions. Although IDT measurements for propanol isomers are mostly available at higher temperatures [15–17], recent RCM studies were performed at elevated pressure (20–40 bar) and intermediate temperatures (780–950 K) conditions [13]. Figure 2 shows comparisons of the current kinetic model predictions and experimental measurements at stoichiometric conditions and across several pressures for both n-butanol (Fig. 2a and b) and n-propanol (Fig. 2c and d). In Fig. 2a, the influence of facility dependent pressure gradients for the post-reflected shock conditions has been included in the simulations by using an equivalent volume profile. Overall, the model captures the dependence on temperature and pressure. It is interesting to note the non-Arrhenius IDT indicating the effect of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) in n-butanol at pressures above 20 bar. Therefore, accurate rate constants and thermochemistry for LTC are needed in n-butanol chemical kinetic models to simulate engine-relevant ignition behavior. Moreover, the impact of including the updated LTC chemistry is demonstrated by the good agreement seen in Fig. 2b with the recently published RCM data [28] and the improved agreement with the Weber et al. RCM data [25] in comparison to simulations using the kinetic model of Sarathy et al. [37]. Figure 2c shows the good agreement of the current model with IDTs at high temperatures and across different pressures, while Fig. 2d shows the impact of the updated n-propanol LTC in the current model in relation to the predictions of Sarathy et al. [37]. The ignition behavior of neat iso-butanol at low-temperatures was studied at similar conditions in two RCM facilities [13,26]. Figure 3 a presents the recently measured [13] and simulated ignition delay times for iso-butanol as functions of inverse temperature at two pressures (P = 20 and 40 bar), covering the temperature range of 780–950 K and at undiluted, stoichiometric fuel loading (21% O2, ϕ = 1). In Fig. 3b, the ignition measurements of iso-butanol in air at 15 and 30 bar by Weber et al. [26] are included. The current model reproduces the experiments and the trends across pressures well. However, the comparisons between measurements and simulations highlight the occasional difficulty of reconciling multiple datasets. Even though the kinetic model is in good agreement with the data, within a factor of 1.6 from both studies, the simulated behavior is faster or slower than either study. Slower simulations than the measurements are shown in Fig. 3a, while faster reactivity than the data is shown in Fig 3b. It should be noted that the two datasets differ in terms of facilities used, diluent compositions, and heat losses. However, a clear explanation for the simulation behavior relative to the experiments is not readily apparent. Additional measurements at these conditions would potentially provide more clarity and insight into the autoignition of iso-butanol. Measured ignition delays of iso-propanol from ST [16] and RCM [13] and the corresponding simulations are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. At all temperatures and across different pressures the current model reproduces the experiments well and its improved performance is depicted in Fig. 3d with respect to the simulations using the kinetic model of Sarathy et al. [37] Examining the chemistry controlling the behavior in Figs. 2 and 3, it is noted that at low temperature and high-pressure conditions, ignition is strongly influenced by H-atom abstraction reactions by OH and HO2. In particular, the rate constant from Mittal et al. [47] for the H-atom abstraction by HO2 at the α-site increased the reactivity of n-butanol and propanol isomers, improving agreement with the measurements. For H-atom abstractions by OH, only the β- and γ-sites promote ignition while those at the α-site are the most inhibiting reactions. Alpha radicals react with O2 to form HO2, a less reactive radical than OH at low temperatures, and an aldehyde. The adoption of McGillen et al. [46] rates for the H-atom abstractions by OH for iso-butanol instead had the most impact on its ignition and in decreasing its reactivity in the range of 750–800 K with respect to the simulations of Sarathy et al. [37] (i.e., see Fig. 3a and b). Other important reactivity promoting reactions are the key steps in low temperature chain branching, such as the unimolecular isomerization of QOOH and the addition of molecular oxygen to QOOH, which compete with inhibiting pathways such as the formation of enols and HO2 radicals."
5,Autoignition of C3-C4 alcohols blended with gasoline,"4.2 Autoignition of C3-C4 alcohols blended with gasoline At similar low temperature and high pressure conditions, iso-butanol is less reactive than n-butanol, as shown in Weber et al. [26]. Similarly, iso-propanol autoignition is slower than n-propanol as shown in Cheng et al. [13]. To investigate the effect of these isomers on gasoline ignition, two sets of ignition data were selected. Simulations of blended gasoline fuels were performed using the Co-Optima model developed by LLNL [56], which includes chemistry commonly used to model commercial and research-grade gasoline fuels, updated with the C3-C4 alcohol model from this study. In the recent work of Gorbatenko et al. [29], n-butanol was blended with a reference gasoline (RON 95, MON 86.6) and a simple gasoline surrogate. The surrogate employed was the three-component TPRF surrogate, comprising toluene, iso-octane and n-heptane, as detailed in Agbro et al. [28]. Ignition delay times were measured in an RCM at various blending ratios (10%, 40% and 85% vol n-butanol), T = 678–916 K, P = 20 bar and stoichiometric conditions. In Fig. 4 a, ignition measurements from Gorbatenko et al. [29] and simulations using the current kinetic model are displayed for neat n-butanol and n-butanol/TPRF blends. The model predicts the effect of n-butanol addition to reduce the reactivity of the gasoline in the NTC region well. n-Butanol acts as an octane enhancer in the NTC region, while at higher temperatures, around 830 K, the addition of n-butanol to gasoline begins promoting reactivity. Chain branching routes from H-abstraction reactions by HO2 become more dominant and lead to the formation of H2O2 which then decomposes into two OH radicals. Recently, new experiments were conducted for FACE F/iso-alcohol blends across a range of engine-relevant conditions in a RCM [14]. The effects of isopropanol and isobutanol addition were studied by adding 10%, 20% and 30% isoalcohol by volume into the base gasoline, at T = 700–1000 K, P = 20 bar and at diluted, stoichiometric fuel loading conditions (15% O2, ϕ = 1). FACE F is a research gasoline and the surrogate used in the simulation is the five component surrogate FGF-LLNL, composed of cyclopentane (14% mol), 1-hexene (14% mol), toluene (12% vol), isooctane (53% vol) and n-heptane (7% mol) [57]. In Fig. 4b and c, comparisons of the measured and predicted IDTs for neat FACE F and its blends with both iso-alcohols are presented. FACE F behavior is predicted well by the model at 20 bar and across the temperature range studied. At higher temperatures, addition of iso-butanol to the gasoline slightly promotes ignition and the model captures this behavior well. At lower temperatures, addition of iso-alcohols to the research gasoline suppresses reactivity. The effect of iso-propanol addition on IDTs is well represented by the model, while in the case of 30% vol iso-butanol addition the model predicts faster autoignition than the experiments. Faster simulations than the measurements for mixtures with higher iso-butanol content are consistent with the neat iso-butanol results shown in Fig. 3b at 30 bar. Additional measurements of IDT for iso-butanol blends, with individual gasoline components and research grade gasolines, would help refine our ability to predict autoignition. A brute force sensitivity analysis of IDTs for the 20% vol isobutanol/FACE F and 10% vol n-butanol/TPRF mixtures at 20 bar are presented in Fig. 5 a and b, respectively. Two temperatures (750 and 900 K) are shown to highlight the differences in sensitive chemistry at low and high temperatures. The sensitivity coefficients are defined as S r e l = ln ( τ Δ τ ) / ln ( k Δ k ) , where τ Δ and τ are the ignition delay times after multiplying and dividing, respectively, the original rate constant by 2. Negative sensitivity coefficients indicate that the reaction promotes reactivity, while positive coefficients indicate an inhibiting effect. For the butanol-related reactions, H-atom abstraction by OH at the α-site of both butanol isomers is the most sensitive and inhibits the reactivity of both mixtures at low temperatures, due to the successive O2 addition to alpha radicals that leads to the production of an aldehyde and HO2 via a concerted elimination pathway. At higher temperatures, the H-atom abstraction from the γ-site exhibits more sensitivity. For reactions related to gasoline components, H-atom abstraction by OH forming cyclopentyl radical is the most inhibiting reaction at both temperatures for the iso-butanol/FACE F mixture. The H-atom abstraction by OH on the tertiary carbon site of iso-octane is also a significant sensitive reaction inhibiting reactivity. For both mixtures considered in Fig. 5, iso-octane reactions show similar sensitivities. However, for n-butanol/TPRF, abstractions of primary hydrogens by OH are most sensitive in promoting ignition at 750 K."
6,Conclusions,"An improved detailed kinetic model for C3-C4 linear and iso-alcohols was developed in this work for autoignition at engine-relevant conditions. The model was validated against literature measurements and recent RCM autoignition data for neat alcohols and their blends with a research-grade gasoline and a gasoline surrogate. Good agreement was observed between the current kinetic model and measurements across multiple datasets. Updates to the rate constants for H-atom abstraction by OH and HO2, low-temperature reaction classes, and thermochemistry improved the ability of the model to simulate low-temperature and high-pressure autoignition. Therefore, this model can be used to predict ignition of both linear and iso- C3-C4 alcohols and their blends with gasoline for boosted spark ignition engine combustion and other low temperature combustion processes."
