0,Introduction,"The construction of CC bonds is of fundamental importance in organic synthesis. Generally, the coupling of enolate derivatives with alkyl halides has been applied for this purpose. However, this method has some disadvantages such as the use of strong base, the large amount of weight lost with the leaving group of the alkylation agent (i.e. low atom efficiency) and the formation of undesirable waste. Recently, CC bond formation through the coupling of alcohols as cheap and readily available alkylation agents has attracted much attention [1–4], because it can give a catalytic method to produce chemicals from bio-alcohols. The reaction proceeds through a hydrogen-borrowing (or hydrogen autotransfer) mechanism, which consists of (1) dehydrogenation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds, (2) Aldol condensation of them to form α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and (3) hydrogenation of the CC (and CO) bonds using the borrowed hydrogen atoms from alcohols. Only water is produced as byproducts, and the atom efficiency of this system is high. Various homogeneous (Ru [5–13], Ir [12–21], Pd [22–24], Cu [25,26], Ni [27] and Fe [28]) and heterogeneous (Pd [23,24,29], Ir [30], Ag [31], Cu [24,32–36], Ru [37], Rh [37,38], Ni [37,38] and basic oxides [39–47]) catalysts have been developed for this reaction. However, these systems suffered from problems such as high temperature (>200°C) [23,24,31–47], high reaction pressure (30–80atm) [23,24,32,33,37,38], high cost of noble metals [5–24,29–31,37,38] or needs of additives [5–33,37,48] such as hydrogen donor or acceptor, or base. Generally, the reported catalysts for the coupling of alcohols were not effective under additive free condition at low temperature. Importantly, previous reports on the self-coupling of secondary alcohols are limited [22,34–36]. Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts for self-coupling of 2-propanol to give methyl isobutyl ketone [34–36] are known, but these examples suffer from high temperature (>200°C) and low selectivity. A homogeneous Pd catalyst for self-coupling of 1-phenyethanol at low temperatures [22] was reported, but this system suffers from high catalyst cost and difficulties in catalyst reuse. From the environmental and economical point, it is desirable to develop cheap and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for the coupling of secondary alcohols under mild and additive-free conditions. In the course of our recent findings [49] on the CeO2-supported Ni (Ni/CeO2) catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of ketones by 2-propanol we have discovered that that Ni/CeO2 acts as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for self-coupling of aliphatic secondary alcohols without any additives under relatively mild conditions. The structure-activity relationship and mechanistic aspects are also discussed to clarify the factors affecting the activity of this catalytic system."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation CeO2 (JRC-CEO-2) and TiO2 (JRC-TIO-4) were supplied from Catalysis Society of Japan. γ-Al2O3 was prepared by calcination of γ-AlOOH (Catapal B Alumina purchased from Sasol) at 900°C for 3h. ZrO2 was prepared by hydrolysis of zirconium oxynitrate 2-hydrate in distilled water by gradually adding an aqueous NH4OH solution (1.0moldm−3), filtration of precipitate, washing with distilled water three times, drying at 100°C, and calcining at 500°C. SiO2 (Q-10) was supplied from Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd. C (active carbon) was purchased from Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd. Ni metal, NiO and Ni2O3 were purchased from Mitsuwa Chemical. Raney Ni (B113W, Ni >90%) was supplied from Evonik Industries. The catalyst precursor (named NiO/CeO2) was prepared by an impregnation method. A mixture of the support and an aqueous solution of Ni nitrates were evaporated at 50°C, followed by drying at 90°C for 12h, calcination in air at 350°C for 4h. Before catalytic experiments, the precursor (NiO/CeO2) was pre-reduced in a pyrex tube under a flow of H2 (20cm3 min−1) at a reduction temperature (T H2) for 0.5h. The specific surface area of 5wt% Ni/CeO2 was 69m2 g−1."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization XRD patterns of the powdered catalysts were recorded with a Rigaku MiniFlex II/AP diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Specific surface area was obtained by measuring N2 adsorption at −196°C by BELCAT. Ni K-edge XAFS measurements were performed in a transmission mode at the BL01B1 in SPring-8 operated at 8GeV. A Si(111) single crystal was used to obtain a monochromatic X-ray beam. A pressed pellet of the pre-reduced Ni/CeO2 sample (Ni=5wt%) was placed in a quartz in situ cell in a flow of 100% H2 (100cm3 min−1) for 0.5h at each temperature under atmospheric pressure, then the sample was cooled to 40°C under a flow of He, and then a XAFS spectrum was obtained. The analysis of EXAFS was performed using the REX version 2.5 program (RIGAKU). The Fourier transformation of the k 3-weighted EXAFS oscillation from k space to r space was performed over the range 22–126nm−1 to obtain a radial distribution function. The inversely Fourier filtered data were analyzed with a usual curve fitting method in the k range of 22–126nm−1. The parameters for the NiO and NiNi shells have been provided by the FEFF6."
4,Typical procedures of catalytic reactions,"2.3 Typical procedures of catalytic reactions Commercially available organic compounds were used without further purification. Typically, 3 or 5wt% Ni/CeO2 (3mol% of Ni with respect to alcohol) was used in catalytic experiments. After the pre-reduction, we carried out catalytic tests without exposing the catalyst to air as follows. The mixture of o-xylene (1.5mL), alcohol (1mmol), and n-dodecane (0.5mmol) was injected to the pre-reduced catalyst inside a reactor (cylindrical glass tube) through a septum inlet. Then, the reactor was purged by N2 and set in a reaction vessel equipped with a condenser. The resulting mixture was stirred at 80–144°C. Conversion and yields of products were determined by GC using n-dodecane as an internal standard. The GC-FID (Shimadzu GC-14B) and GC–MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP5000) analyses were carried out with a Rtx-65 capillary column (Shimadzu) using nitrogen or helium as the carrier gas. The products were identified by GC–MS and by comparison with commercially pure products."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structure of Ni/CeO2,"3.1 Structure of Ni/CeO2 The XRD spectrum of 5wt% Ni/CeO2 showed no peaks due to metallic Ni and NiO possibly due to high dispersion of Ni species. Thus, the structure of Ni species on the Ni/CeO2 catalysts was studied by Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structures (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) shown in Fig. 1 . Table 1 shows the results of curve-fitting analyses of the EXAFS. The curve-fitting of the EXAFS of unreduced precursor, named NiO/CeO2, gave a NiO shell at 1.99Å with NiNi coordination number (N) of 6.9 and a NiNi shell at 2.95Å of N =7.8 (Table 1). By comparison with the crystallographic data of NiO, the EXAFS feature of NiO/CeO2 was assigned to NiO species. On the other hand, the EXAFS of the Ni/CeO2 catalyst reduced at 400°C consists of a NiNi shell at 2.44Å (N =5.9) with a weak NiO shell at 1.84Å (N =0.4). By comparison with the crystallographic data of Ni metal, the NiNi shell was assigned to metallic Ni. The NiNi coordination number (5.9) was smaller than that of Ni foil (12), indicating a small size of Ni metal nanoparticles on Ni/CeO2. The weak contribution of the NiO shell indicates the presence of NiO species as minor species. The EXAFS of the Ni/CeO2 catalyst reduced at a medium temperature (250°C) consists of characteristic features due to NiO (a NiO shell at 2.02Å with N =2.4 and a NiNi shell at 2.94Å with N =1.8) and a feature due to Ni metal (a NiNi shell at 2.49Å with N =2.0), which indicates the co-presence of NiO and Ni metal species. To estimate the fraction of Ni metal and NiO species in the catalysts, we carried out pattern fitting analysis of Ni K-edge XANES. We obtained the fractions of the Ni metal and NiO by the least-squares fitting of the XANES spectrum of the Ni/CeO2 sample with a linear combination of XANES spectra of Ni foil and NiO. The fraction of Ni metal and NiO species in each catalyst was plotted in Fig. 2A as a function of the reduction temperature. The fraction of metallic Ni increased with increase in the reduction temperature."
7,Catalytic performance and structure-activity relationship,"3.2 Catalytic performance and structure-activity relationship First, we compared the activity of various Ni(5wt%)-loaded catalysts pre-reduced at 500°C and Ni compounds for self-coupling of 2-octanol (Table 2 ). Among various Ni catalysts, Ni/CeO2 showed highest yield of dimer products (ketone 1a and alcohol 2a). In contrast, Ni-loaded ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2 and active carbon catalyzed the dehydrogenation of 2-octanol to give 2-octanone as the main products (entries 3–7). Yield of the dimer products for Ni/CeO2 was much higher than those on other Ni-loaded catalysts even under a similar conversion level (38–74%, entries 2–7). Ni-loaded ZrO2, γ-Al2O3 or TiO2 catalysts pre-reduced at lower temperature (250°C) were also tested (not shown), but the yields of the dimers were below 8%. Cu/CeO2 and Co/CeO2 catalysts (entries 14,15) were less effective than Ni/CeO2 (entry 1). Commercially available Ni compounds (Ni powder, Raney Ni, Ni2O3 and NiO) were nearly ineffective for the self-coupling reaction (entries 10–13). The unreduced precursor (NiO/CeO2) and bare CeO2 showed no yield of the self-coupling products (entries 8, 9). Thus, CeO2 as well as metallic Ni is indispensable for the self-coupling reaction. Next, we optimized the preparation conditions of the 5wt% Ni/CeO2 catalyst. Fig. 2B shows the influence of hydrogen reduction temperature on the catalytic activity. The yield of dimers (self-coupling products) showed volcano-type dependence on the reduction temperature, and the reduction temperature of 250°C gave the highest activity. The XANES analysis showed that the Ni/NiO ratio of the catalyst reduced at 250°C was 48/52. At the reduction temperatures higher than 250°C, the dimer yield gradually decreased with increasing the reduction temperature but was still higher than those of the none-reduced NiO/CeO2 (dimer yield=0%). This shows that metallic Ni is indispensible and the co-existence of oxide one would promote the reaction. The decrease of the activity at reduction temperature more than 300°C would be due to the aggregation of Ni particles, since the fraction of Ni metal was almost constant in this temperature range. Influence of Ni content in Ni/CeO2 on the catalytic activity is shown in Fig. 3 . The Ni loading in a range 1–3wt% was found to be optimum, and the activity decreased at higher loading. For the 1 and 3wt% Ni/CeO2 catalysts, the yield of dimers showed volcano-type dependence on the reduction temperature, and the reduction temperature of 300°C gave the highest activity (result not shown). Assuming that base-catalyzed Aldol condensation step is responsible for the high activity of Ni/CeO2, influence of the support basicity on metal oxide catalyzed Aldol condensation was examined. Aldol condensation of 2, 5-hexanedione to 3-methy-cyclopenten-1-one by metal oxides was carried out as a model reaction under toluene reflux condition in N2 (Table 3 ). The reaction rate was plotted as a function of the electronegativity of the metal oxide (Fig. 4 ). There is a general tendency that basicity of metal oxides increases with a decrease in the electronegativity of the metal oxide [50]. The rate for Aldol condensation increased with decrease in the electronegativity (i.e. with increase in the basicity of the metal oxides). Thus, an effective promotion of the Aldol condensation step by basic sites on the CeO2 support can be responsible for the support (CeO2) specific Ni catalysis for self-coupling of 2-octanol shown in Table 2. To confirm the influence of surface basicity on the activity, the yields of dimers (1a and 1b) for self-coupling of 2-octanol by 5wt% Ni-loaded metal oxides (Table 2) are plotted as a function of the number of basic sites, which has been estimated by CO2-TPD in our recent report [51]. The result (Fig. 5 ) shows that the catalytic activity as well as the basicity of the catalysts increases with a decrease in the electronegativity of the support oxides. We examined the scope of substrates for self-coupling of secondary alcohols by using Ni/CeO2 (Ni=1–3wt%) reduced at 300°C (Table 4 ). Reaction of 2-octanol effectively proceeded at 130°C for 20h to give the corresponding dimer products in high yield (entry 1). Self-coupling of other aliphatic liner alcohols proceeded in good to moderate yield (entries 4–6). In the dimer products, 1 (ketone) was mainly obtained and 2 (alcohol) was a minor products. Ni/CeO2 was also active for the self-coupling of cyclic alcohol, but the main dimer product was not 1 but 2 (entry 7). Self-coupling of 2-propanol proceeded (entry 8) at much lower temperature (120°C) than those of the reported Cu-based catalysts [34–36] (>200°C) and various coupling products, methyl isobutyl ketone (21%), 4-methyl-2-pentanol (19%), diisobutyl ketone (21%) and 2, 6-dimethyl-4-hexanol (9%), were obtained in comparable yields to the previous studies. Note that the product of Aldol addition (non-dehydrated products) was not observed by GC–MS. To the best of our knowledge, the present system is the first heterogeneous catalytic system for self-coupling of various aliphatic alcohols under relatively mild reaction conditions. After the reaction, Ni/CeO2 was easily separated from the reaction mixture by a centrifugation. The filtered catalyst was washed with acetone, followed by calcination in air at 350°C for 1h, and by reducing in H2 at 300°C for 0.5h. As shown in Table 4 entries 1–3, the recovered catalyst was reused at least two times without any indication of catalyst deactivation. We also analyzed the solution after reaction by using ICP and confirmed that no Ni species were dissolved in the solution (under the detection limit less than 0.1ppm). These results show that Ni/CeO2 is a recyclable catalyst for the self-coupling of secondary alcohols."
8,Reaction pathway,"3.3 Reaction pathway As previously proposed by various researchers [1–3], the present catalytic system could proceed through so called hydrogen-borrowing pathway, which consists of dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols to ketones, Aldol condensation of them to form α,β-unsaturated ketone, and hydrogenation of the CC bonds using the borrowed hydrogen atoms from alcohols. Fig. 6 shows the time course of the product yield for self-coupling of 2-octanol by Ni/CeO2. A time-conversion profile characteristic to a consecutive reaction mechanism was observed; 2-octanone formed at an initial induction period was consumed after 2h to give the dimer product. Thus, the initial stage of the reaction should be the oxidation of alcohols to the ketone intermediates possibly accompanied by the transitory generation of nickel hydride (NiH) species. As shown in Fig. 4, bare CeO2 was active for Aldol condensation of ketones to form α,β-unsaturated ketone. We tested transfer hydrogenation of 1-dodecenne using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor by Ni/CeO2 (Eq. (1)) as a model reaction. (1) It was found that the catalyst was effective for the transfer hydrogenation of the CC bond. Thus, in the self-coupling of alcohols, hydride transfer from the alcohol to the CC bond of α,β-unsaturated ketone could occur by this catalyst. Based on the above results, we propose a plausible mechanism as shown in Fig. 7 . The reaction begins with the dehydrogenation of alcohols to the corresponding ketones with the generation of NiH species (step 1). Then, Aldol condensation between these ketones occurs to give the α,β-unsaturated ketone (step 2). Finally, hydrogen transfer from NiH species to the CC bond of the α,β-unsaturated ketone gives the ketone product (step 3). In the case for the self-coupling of cyclopentanol (Table 4, entry 7), CO bond is also hydrogenated to give an alcohol 2 as a major product. The α,β-unsaturated ketone is relatively unstable, but in situ hydrogenation of the CC bond of it by borrowed hydrogen from alcohols results in selective production of the saturated ketone as shown below. Eq. (2) shows the result of CeO2-catalyzed Aldol condensation of 2-octanone. The yield of the Aldol condensation product (15%) was lower than the conversion of 2-octanone (51%) and several byproducts with higher molecular weight were observed, suggesting that the unstable α,β-unsaturated ketone underwent undesirable reactions. On the other hand, the reaction of equimolar mixture of 2-octanone and 2-octanol by Ni/CeO2 resulted in 97% yield of the saturated ketone (Eq. (3)). These results indicate that fast hydrogenation of unstable α,β-unsaturated ketone by in situ formed NiH species plays a significant role in the one-pot self-coupling of 2-octanol by Ni/CeO2. (2) (3)"
9,Conclusions,"We studied supported Ni catalysts for the CC self-coupling of aliphatic secondary alcohols to dimer products (mainly higher ketones). The catalytic activity was largely varied with the support materials as well as the oxidation state of Ni; CeO2 (a basic support) and metallic Ni are indispensable for the reaction. The best catalyst, i.e. 1 or 3wt% Ni/CeO2 pre-reduced at medium temperatures (250–300°C), acted as reusable heterogeneous catalyst for the self-coupling of various secondary alcohols without any additives at low temperature (80–144°C), providing the first heterogeneous catalytic system for the self-coupling of various secondary alcohols under mild conditions. A possible reaction mechanism is proposed, in which ketones, formed by dehydrogenation of alcohol, undergone Aldol condensation to give α,β-unsaturated ketone which is finally hydrogenated by in situ formed NiH species."
