0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic compounds using metallic catalysts is regarded as one of the most important reactions in the synthesis of fine chemicals [1–3]. 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (py-THQ) is an important fine chemical intermediate widely used in the synthesis of medicines, pesticides and dyes [4–6]. The method of quinoline selective hydrogenation to obtain py-THQ is simple with 100% materials utilization, which attracts wide interests of researchers. Many scientists have employed high reaction temperatures (100–150 °C), high reaction pressures (3–6 MPa) and long reaction times (>10 h) in quinoline hydrogenation reaction. These conditions increase the reaction rate of quinoline hydrogenation but decrease the selective production of py-THQ [7]. Therefore, it is a great challenge to find a catalyst that offers high conversion and high selectivity for quinoline hydrogenation under mild reaction conditions [8,9]. It is well known that most catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of quinoline contain noble metals [10]. A synergistic effect occurs among the various metal-related species in multimetallic catalysts, so their catalytic performance can be improved as compared to those of monometallic catalysts [11–13]. In the past few decades, precious metals including platinum [14–17], gold [10], palladium [18–20], rhodium [21], iridium [22,23] and ruthenium [24–28] deposited on various supports (e.g., carbon and metal oxide) have been employed in quinoline-selective hydrogenation reactions. Recently, Yu et al. found that an Ru/OMNC-700 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity and provided a TOF of 70.0 h−1 for quinoline hydrogenation with >99% THQ selectivity under mild conditions (50 °C and 1.0 MPa H2) [29]. In the study of Zhang et al., the as-prepared Pd@CIL-900 catalyst had large surface area, realizing a TOF of 179.2 h−1 for quinoline hydrogenation and high selectivity for THQ production (>99%) at 80 °C under 0.1 MPa H2 [30]. Most of the above studies investigated the catalytic performance of monometallic or bimetallic catalysts for quinoline hydrogenation. It is of great significance to find a highly efficient trimetallic catalyst that has high selectivity for quinoline hydrogenation under mild reaction conditions [31–34]. Herein, we successfully prepared Ni/C samples at RT via a simple strategy of hydrazine hydrate reduction and the corresponding PtNi/C, RuNi/C and PtRuNi/C catalysts by a chemical replacement strategy. The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic behavior of the PtRuNi/C trimetallic nanocatalyst for quinoline hydrogenation was investigated. The reasons for the differences in the catalytic performances of the monometallic (Ni/C, Pt/C and Ru/C), bimetallic (PtRu/C, PtNi/C and RuNi/C) and trimetallic (PtRuNi/C) catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of quinoline are discussed. The nanostructures of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by various analytical methods, including XRD, TEM, SEM, HAADF-STEM, STEM-EDX mapping and line-scanning, XPS and HS-LEIS. PtRuNi/C exhibited outstanding catalytic performance in quinoline hydrogenation, providing >99% selectivity for the production of py-THQ and 211.4 h−1 TOF under mild reaction conditions (reaction temperature −60 °C and 5.0 MPa H2)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., The reagents included nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), ethanol, hexane, sodium hydroxide, hydrazine hydrate (85 wt% N2H4·H2O), carbon black (BP-2000), ruthenium trichloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl2·6H2O), quinoline (C9H7N), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (C9H11N), 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline (C9H11N), decahydroquinoline (C9H17N), decahydroisoquinoline (C9H17N) and deionized water. All chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of the catalysts Preparation of Ni/C: Ni/C was synthesized at room temperature (RT) via a hydrazine hydrate reduction [35]. Typically, 0.4500 g nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate was added to a solution prepared by mixing 82.5 mL deionized water with 12.5 mL anhydrous ethanol. After 10 min magnetic stirring at RT, a green transparent solution was obtained, 20 mL aqueous NaOH solution (containing 1.8130 g NaOH) was then poured into the above-mentioned solution, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Then, 25 mL hydrazine hydrate was transferred to the above mixture as a reductant, and the mixture was magnetically stirred for another 10 min. Next, 1.2500 g carbon black (BP-2000) was injected into the mixture, the mixture was stirred for 10 min, transferred to a Teflon cup, and allowed to react at RT for 18.5 h. When the reaction was complete, the black product was collected by filtration and washed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol. The black solid, which was designated Ni/C, was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 6 h. Preparation of PtNi/C and RuNi/C: Ni/C (0.3000 g) and a specific amount of aqueous RuCl3 solution (1.0000 g RuCl3·xH2O in 250 mL deionized water) were mixed together and magnetically stirred for 6 h. The catalyst was collected by filtration and washed several times, the resulting black solid, which was designated RuNi/C, was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 6 h. The steps in the synthesis of the PtNi/C catalyst were similar to those of RuNi/C via a chemical replacement method [36–40]. Preparation of PtRu/C: PtRu/C catalyst with 1.0 wt% Pt and 1.2 wt% Ru loading was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. A pre-calculated amount of aqueous H2PtCl6 solution (1.0000 g H2PtCl2·6H2O in 250 mL deionized water) and aqueous RuCl3 solution were placed in a beaker, and deionized water (100 mL) was added. Carbon black (BP-2000, 0.3000 g) was added to the mixed solution under strong agitation. The mixture was stirred continuously at 80 °C until almost all of the water had evaporated. It was then placed in a blast oven and dried at 110 °C for 3 h to obtain a dry sample. The sample was calcined under mixed gas (90%N2+10%H2, 20 mL min−1) at 400 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, the product was designated PtRu/C. The steps in the synthesis of Pt/C (with 2% Pt loading) and Ru/C (with 2.4% Ru loading) catalysts were similar to those of PtRu/C. Synthesis of PtRuNi/C: A pre-calculated amount of aqueous H2PtCl2 solution was diluted in 200 mL deionized water, and 0.3000 g Ni/C was added. After stirring for 2 h, a measured amount of aqueous RuCl3 solution was added, and stirring was continued for an additional 2 h. After filtration and washing with ethanol and deionized water, a black solid was obtained. The solid powder was dried at 60 °C for 6 h under vacuum and was designated PtRuNi/C. The actual loading of Pt in PtNi/C and PtRuNi/C was 2% and 1%, respectively. The ruthenium mass fraction in RuNi/C and PtRuNi/C was 2.4 wt% and 1.2% wt%, respectively. The metal content of as-obtained catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic mass spectrometry (Agilent ICP-MS 4500-300)."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements of as-synthesized samples were performed on Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation as the X-ray resource (λ = 0.154 nm, 40 kV and 30 mA). Transmission electron microscopy images were captured on an FEI TECNAI F30 electron microscope at 300 kV acceleration voltage. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the samples were recorded on a PHI Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe analyzer with Al Kα irradiation (hν = 1486.6 eV), the binding energy of C 1s (284.6 eV) was used as the internal standard. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and STEM energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) elemental mapping and line-scanning results of the catalysts were obtained using a TECNAI F30 electron microscope at 300 kV acceleration voltage. High-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering (HS-LEIS) spectra of the catalysts were obtained on an IonTOF Qtac100 low-energy ion scattering analyzer. The low ion flux was 1325 pA cm−2 (3 keV 4He+ spectra). 20Ne+ ions with a kinetic energy of 5 keV were applied at a low ion flux of 1600 pA cm−2 (5 keV 4Ne+ spectra). The scattering angle was 145°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and SEM-EDX spectra of the catalysts were collected in a LEO-1530 scanning electron microscope."
5,Catalytic activity test,"2.4 Catalytic activity test The catalytic performance of as-synthesized catalysts for quinoline hydrogenation was tested in an MS-50-316 L stainless steel autoclave. In the experiment, 10 mL ethanol quinoline solution (0.69 wt%) and 0.0500 g catalyst was placed in the autoclave. After the reaction device was installed, air in the reactor was replaced with hydrogen, the reactor was then filled with hydrogen until the pressure reached 5.0 MPa and the stirring rate reached 870 r min−1. The reaction was conducted at the specified temperature (e.g., 100 °C) for a defined period of time (e.g., 1 h). When the reaction was finished, the sample was quickly cooled to room temperature. The filtered liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography on Shimadzu system using a DB-35 (60 m × 0.32 mm) capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID), and the products were identified by gas chromatography ∼ mass spectrometry using a Shimadzu system. The catalytic properties of as-obtained catalysts were determined by calculating their conversion, selectivity and turnover frequency (TOF). The Pt and Ru metal loadings were determined by ICP-MS and the metal atoms were equally distributed on the surface of catalysts. According to the literature [41,42], the dispersion of the PtRu nanoparticles was calculated according to the equation below. The Pt and Ru metal loadings were determined by ICP-MS, and the metal atoms were found to be equally distributed on the surface of the catalysts. X = n ( q u i n o l i n e ) i n − n ( q u i n o l i n e ) o u t n ( q u i n o l i n e ) i n × 100 % T O F = ( n ( q u i n o l i n e ) × X ) / ( n ( n o b l e m e t a l ) × t × D ) where X is the conversion of quinoline and nnoble metal, t and D represent the total moles of noble metal, the reaction time and the dispersion, respectively. The dispersion can be calculated as follows: D = (6nsM)/(ρNdp) Where ns signifies the number of metal atoms on the surface per unit area (Pt: 1.12 × 1019 m−2 and Ru: 1.63 × 1019 m−2), M represents the atomic mass of Pt or Ru (195.08 g mol−1 and 101.07 g mol−1 for Pt and Ru, respectively). ρ represents the density of the metal (ρ Pt = 21.45 g cm−3, ρ Ru = 12.1 g cm−3). N is the Avogadro’s number (6.023 × 1023 mol−1), and dp is the average size of the metallic particles (dp = 6.52 × 10−9 m, from Fig. 3)."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Characterization results of the samples,"3.1 Characterization results of the samples Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-synthesized samples that were used to analyze the crystallite phase structures and dispersion of the catalysts. Fig. 1A displays the XRD patterns of Ni/C, Ru/C and RuNi/C. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.2°, 33.1°, 38.1°, 52.1°, 59.1° and 62.7° are assigned to the (001), (110), (101), (102), (110) and (111) planes of Ni(OH)2, respectively (JCPDS card No. 04-0117) [43]. In addition, the diffraction peak at 2θ = 44.4° corresponds to the (111) facet of fcc Ni (JCPDS card No. 04-0850) [44,45]. XRD patterns indicate that Ni and Ni(OH)2 crystalline phases are present in Ni/C. After ruthenium was supported on Ni/C (Fig. 1Ac), the intensity of Ni(111) and Ni(OH)2 diffraction peaks decreased slightly. A possible reason for this is that ruthenium atoms replace some nickel atoms during the synthesis of RuNi/C. Similar conclusions could be drawn by analyzing the XRD patterns of the Ni/C, Pt/C and PtNi/C catalysts (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the XRD patterns of Ni/C, PtRu/C and PtRuNi/C. Only the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni(OH)2 and Ni appear in Fig. 1C, while the characteristic diffraction peaks associated with Ru and Pt are not observed. This is probably because Ru and Pt are coated on Ni/Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles in the form of particles too small to be observed or as an amorphous coating. Fig. 2 displays a HAADF-STEM image of PtRuNi/C (Fig. 2a) and shows the size distribution of PtRuNi nanoparticles (Fig. 2b). It demonstrates that the PtRuNi nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the catalyst support (carbon black). Fig. 2b shows that PtRuNi nanoparticles with an average diameter of 6.52 nm are obtained and that the particle size distribution is narrow with small particle size. To further explore the nanostructure and morphology of the catalyst, the PtRuNi/C catalyst was observed by TEM. The four TEM images in Fig. 3 show the PtRuNi/C catalyst at various magnifications. In the TEM images of PtRuNi/C, many small black spots can be observed on the surface of the support (Fig. 3a and b), and the distribution of the PtRuNi metal nanoparticles is seen to be very uniform. Typical SEM images of the PtRuNi/C and RuNi/C catalysts and their SEM-EDX spectra are shown in Fig. 4 . The images show that PtRuNi and RuNi nanoparticles are too small to be detected by SEM, demonstrating that the metallic nanoparticles are highly dispersed. To further investigate the distribution of elements in the catalysts, the PtRuNi/C and RuNi/C catalysts were characterized by SEM-EDX. Platinum, ruthenium, oxygen, nickel and carbon are found in the EDX spectrum of PtRuNi/C (Fig. 4b). In addition, elemental ruthenium, oxygen, nickel and carbon are detected in the EDX spectrum of the RuNi/C catalyst (Fig. 4d). HAADF-STEM image of PtRuNi/C and its STEM-EDX elemental line-scanning result are shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5a, a number of highly dispersed, bright nanoparticles are visible on the support. Fig. 5b presents a STEM-EDX elemental line-scanning image in which we can see that Ru, Pt and Ni occur together in selected individual PtRuNi nanoparticles and that the Ru and Pt are centrally distributed on particles with a diameter of 4–6 nm. Areas containing all three elements do not appear, consistent with the previous XRD analysis results indicating that the PtRuNi alloy does not exist in the PtRuNi/C catalyst. The chemical states and surface compositions of the elements in Ni/C, PtNi/C, RuNi/C and PtRuNi/C were analyzed using the XPS technique. The Ni 2p XPS spectra of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . The Ni 2p3/2 peaks appearing at binding energies of 852.7, 853.9, 855.4 and 857.1 eV belong to Ni(0), NiO, Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH species, respectively [46–48]. Comparison of the peak areas shows that the Ni species on the surface of the above-mentioned four catalysts exists primarily in the form of oxidized Ni, with a small amount of Ni(0) species. Combined with the XRD characterization results presented above, the results show that Ni(OH)2 is the dominant Ni species present. Fig. 7 shows the Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt/C, PtRu/C, PtNi/C and PtRuNi/C. The binding energies observed at 71.5, 72.4 and 73.5 eV can be assigned to Pt(0), Pt2+ and Pt4+, respectively. In the Pt 4f5/2 XPS spectra, the Pt(0), Pt2+ and Pt4+ species have binding energies of 74.9, 75.8 and 76.9 eV, respectively [49–51]. Through calculation and comparison of each peak area, we find that Pt exists primarily in the form of Pt2+. The main reason for this is that Pt is located on the surface of the catalysts and is thus easily oxidized in air. Interestingly, the peak area of Pt(0) in Fig. 7a (Pt/C) and Fig. 7b (PtRu/C) are much larger than those in Fig. 7c (PtNi/C) and Fig. 7d (PtRuNi/C), this may be due to the effect of the thermal reduction in 90%N2+10%H2 for Pt/C and PtRu/C and greater Pt dispersion in the PtNi/C and PtRuNi/C catalysts. The Ru 3p XPS spectra of the Ru/C, PtRu/C, RuNi/C and PtRuNi/C catalysts are displayed in Fig. 8 . The binding energies at 462 and 464.2 eV are assigned to Ru(0) and Ru4+ species, respectively [52]. By calculating the peak areas associated with the Ru(0) and Ru4+ species in the Ru 3p3/2 XPS line, Ru species exists preferably in the form of Ru4+ rather than Ru(0). This is because Ru(0) is oxidized under air, the results therefore indicate that there are Ru atoms on the surfaces of the catalysts containing ruthenium. A comparison of the Ru 2p XPS and Pt 4f XPS spectra shows that the ratio of oxidized Pt in all Pt-related species is much larger than that of oxidized Ru in all Ru-related species. This suggests that more Pt atoms than Ru atoms are located on the surface, resulting in Pt being more easily oxidized. The atomic content on the outermost surface of the catalysts was characterized by high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering. 3 keV 4He+ and 5 keV 20Ne+ HS-LEIS spectra of the as-prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . According to Fig. 9Ac, there are four types of atoms (carbon, oxygen, nickel and platinum) on the surface of PtNi/C, and the content of carbon and oxygen atoms on the surface of each catalyst is almost the same. However, in the 3 keV 4He+ HS-LEIS spectrum of Pt/C (Fig. 9Ab), no signal from Pt atoms is found, probably because high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering (3 keV 4He+) is less sensitive to heavy atoms. Moreover, in the 3 keV 4He+ HS-LEIS spectra, the Ni signal of the Ni/C catalyst is much stronger than that of the other catalysts, mainly because some Ni atoms were replaced with Pt atoms during the synthesis of the PtNi/C catalyst. Fig. 9Fc (5 keV 20Ne+ HS-LEIS spectra for PtRuNi/C) shows that the intensity of the Pt atom signal is much stronger than that of the Ru atom signal, indicating either that Pt atoms have higher dispersion than Ru atoms on the surface of the PtRuNi/C catalyst or that most Ru atoms are covered by Pt atoms. The above results are generally consistent with the results obtained with XPS. To further investigate the microstructure and elemental distribution of PtRuNi, the PtRuNi/C sample was characterized by HAADF-STEM and STEM-EDX elemental mapping analysis. Fig. 10 a shows a HAADF-STEM image of the PtRuNi/C catalyst. Many metallic nanoparticles are observed on the surface of the PtRuNi/C catalyst. Fig. 10b–d shows the STEM-EDX mappings of Ni (red), Pt (dark cyan) and Ru (yellow) elements, respectively, the Ni signal is clearly much stronger than that of Ru and Pt, and the intensity of Pt is very difficult to distinguish because the Pt loading is low. It is noted that the distribution of Ni element does not overlap that of Pt and Ru elements. Taken together with the other characterization results presented above, it can be inferred that PtRu islands are loaded on the surface of the Ni/Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles (PtRu island-on-Ni/Ni(OH)2 NPs)."
8,Catalytic activity results,"3.2 Catalytic activity results The catalytic performance of different catalysts for quinoline selective hydrogenation is shown in Table 1 . Quinoline hydrogenation reactions were performed at 100 °C under 5.0 MPa H2 for 1 h. When quinoline hydrogenation was catalyzed by the Ni/C catalyst, no products were formed under the investigated reaction conditions (entry 1 in Table 1). After platinum was supported on the Ni/C sample, both quinoline conversion and TOF increased synchronously (conversion = 68.8%, TOF = 447.7 h−1, yield of py-THQ = 63.3%) (entry 4 in Table 1). The TOF of the Pt/C and Ru/C catalysts was low with low yields to the products (py-THQ, bz-THQ, decahydroquinoline and decahydroisoquinoline) (Table 1, entries 2, 3). Furthermore, Pt/C provided 15.6% yield of py-THQ. The main product of quinoline hydrogenation over the Ru/C catalyst was decahydroisoquinoline. Based on analysis of data obtained for the catalysis of quinoline hydrogenation, PtRuNi/C catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic properties and high yield of py-THQ in this reaction (yield of py-THQ = 69.4%, TOF = 329.3 h−1, conversion = 100%). The improved catalytic performance of PtRuNi/C catalyst in the hydrogenation reaction may be due to a synergistic effect among Pt-, Ru- and Ni-related species. It has been reported that supported catalysts containing various noble metals can catalyze the hydrogenation of quinolone under a variety of conditions. PtRuNi/C described in this work exhibited relatively excellent catalytic performance compared to previously reported catalysts. The catalytic performance of the PtRuNi/C catalyst in quinoline hydrogenation at different reaction temperatures is shown in Table 2 . At a reaction temperature of 25 °C, the conversion of quinoline was only 1.1%, with 1.1% yield of py-THQ. Quinoline conversion increased (100%) when the reaction temperature was increased from 25 °C to 80–100 °C. TOF of the PtRuNi/C catalyst for quinoline hydrogenation gradually increased from 3.6 h−1 to 329.3 h−1. The selectivity for the production of py-THQ decreased, but the yield of py-THQ only slightly changed at reaction temperatures ranging from 60 °C to 100 °C. The main reason for this may be that as the temperature increased, py-THQ was also further hydrogenated, yielding other products and reducing the selective production of py-THQ. It can be concluded that PtRuNi/C catalyst shows the optimum catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of quinolone at 60 °C (selectivity for the production of py-THQ > 99%, TOF = 211.4 h−1, yield of py-THQ = 63.5%). Moreover, the stability of PtRuNi/C for quinoline hydrogenation was also investigated, and the results are displayed in Fig. 11 . It was found that selectivity for the production of py-THQ remained above 99% and that the yield of py-THQ was almost unchanged, indicating that the PtRuNi/C catalyst was very stable under the investigated reaction conditions."
9,Conclusions,"Ni/C was prepared at RT via hydrate hydrazine reduction, and Pt and Ru were gradually loaded on the Ni/C in a chemical replacement reaction to form a PtRuNi/C trimetallic catalyst. PtNi/C and RuNi/C bimetallic catalysts were obtained using the same preparation method. The morphology, particle size, element distribution, and nanostructures of the PtNi, RuNi and PtRuNi nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM, HAADF-STEM, STEM-EDX elemental mapping and line-scanning and HS-LEIS analysis. The results showed that PtRuNi/C has a novel nanostructure in which PtRu islands are supported on Ni/Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles (PtRu island-on-Ni/Ni(OH)2 NPs). PtRuNi/C exhibited the optimum catalytic performance (selectivity for the production of py-THQ > 99% and TOF = 329.3 h−1) for selective quinolone hydrogenation under mild reaction conditions (5.0 MPa H2 and 60 °C). The PtRuNi/C trimetallic nanocatalyst showed significantly improved catalytic properties as compared to bimetallic (PtNi/C, RuNi/C and PtRu/C) and monometallic (Ni/C, Pt/C and Ru/C) nanocatalysts due to the synergistic effect among platinum-, ruthenium- and nickel-related species originated from the novel PtRu island-on-Ni/Ni(OH)2 NPs nanostructure."
