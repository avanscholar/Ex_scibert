0,Introduction,"The growing energy depletion and the human’s desirability of a pollution-free environment determine the urgency of developing clean energy production and storage technologies [1–4]. Therefore, many key technologies involved in the efficient utilization of clean energy, such as hydrogen energy production and fuel cells, have become a hot research topic and attracted much attention [5–8]. Electrochemical catalytic water splitting to produce high purity hydrogen is regarded as one promising way for sustainable hydrogen economy [9–17]. In addition, electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is also a key electrochemical process in a wide range of energy recycling technologies, which can convert the chemical energy into electricity through battery devices [18]. Nevertheless, their energy conversion efficiency still heavily depend on the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. Up to now, platinum (Pt)-based catalysts remain the most efficient electrocatalysts owing to their high intrinsic activity, however, the high price and limited reserve greatly restrict their large scale applications. Therefore, great efforts have been made on searching cost-effective alternatives to Pt-based electrocatalysts, such as transition metal compounds, metallic alloys, metal oxides, and carbon-based materials [7,19–26]. Recently, ruthenium (Ru) has drawn extensive attention for its superior electrocatalytic activities comparable to Pt and its alloys [27–30], while the price of Ru is just 4% of Pt [31,32]. From this point of view, Ru is a potential alternative to Pt-based catalysts. Previous studies have shown that Ru-based electrocatalysts possessed excellent activities on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction, methanol oxidation, and oxygen reduction [33–39]. Unfortunately, due to easy corrosion and aggregation, the poor durability of Ru-based electrocatalysts is still a bottleneck for practical applications. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop efficient, stable and multifunctional Ru-based electrocatalysts through a rational design. It has been demonstrated that engineering the size and shape of metal nanoparticles could radically alter their electrocatalytic performance [40–42]. In general, ultrasmall metal nanoparticles can expose a mass of accessible superficial active sites, possessing superior electrocatalytic performance than the bigger ones [43,44]. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges in preparation of stable super-small nanoparticles, mainly due to the high surface energy, easy collapse and agglomeration at high annealing temperature. To fulfill the requirements of both high efficiency and durability for ultrasmall metal nanoparticles, anchoring them on an appropriate support is considered to be an effective method [10,24,44–46]. In this field, heteroatom-doped carbon as a common metal support material has generated a great deal of attention [47–49]. The heteroatom species on carbon support can serve as metal anchoring sites. Besides, the wide surface area as well as heteroatom doping of porous carbon support can promote the adsorption and dissociation of gas molecules, which are beneficial to the kinetics of the gas-involving reactions. Inspired by the aforementioned discussions, herein, we designed and synthesized a hybrid nanostructure composed of hollow nitrogen-doped carbon sphere coupled with ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles (Ru/HNCS). The as-synthesized Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst with Ru content even below 0.1 wt% presents exceptionally catalytic activities towards both HER and ORR. When catalyzing HER in acidic condition, a low overpotential (η10) of 39 mV was sufficiently to achieve the polarization current density of 10 mA cm−2; Meanwhile, the Tafel slope was merely 30 mV dec−1. Meanwhile, Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity for ORR with a half-potential of 0.72 V as well as high durability and palmary anti-poisoning capability for methanol in basic electrolyte. These outstanding performances can be attributed to the strongly coupled ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles and the perfect dispersity of the active sites, as well as the synergistic effect between noble metal and hollow carbon spheres support."

3,Preparation of polydopamine (PDA) coated silicon dioxide spheres (SiO2@PDA),"2.2 Preparation of polydopamine (PDA) coated silicon dioxide spheres (SiO2@PDA) Silicon dioxide (SiO2) spheres were firstly synthesized according to a method reported previously [50]. Then, 80 mg of SiO2 spheres were dispersed into 25 mL Tris-buffer solution under ultrasound treatment. Afterward, 80 mg of C8H11NO2·HCl was added into the above SiO2 dispersion and stirred for one day at room temperature. Finally, the polydopamine coated SiO2 spheres (SiO2@PDA) was collected through centrifugation and re-dispersed in 25 mL water."
4,Synthesis of Ru nanoparticles confined within hollow nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (Ru/HNCS),"2.3 Synthesis of Ru nanoparticles confined within hollow nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (Ru/HNCS) 2.0 mg of RuCl3 was dissolved in previously prepared SiO2@PDA dispersion under stirring for 2 h. Then, the dispersion was rotary evaporated to remove water and dried in vacuum. After that, the as-obtained hybrid sample was annealed at 800 °C for 2 h in a tubular furnace with Argon atmosphere. Next, the recovered black product was dispersed in 40 mL HF (5%) and stirred for 24 h to remove the SiO2 templates. Finally, the product was washed with water and donated as Ru2.0/HNCS. For comparison, we synthesized a series of Ru/HNCS using different amount of RuCl3 (1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 mg) and the corresponding electrocatalysts was named as Ru1.0/HNCS, Ru0.5/HNCS and Ru0.25/HNCS, respectively. In addition, HNCS was prepared through directly annealing of SiO2@PDA without adding of RuCl3."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Morphology characterization as well as element mapping of the synthesized samples were performed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X, 200 kV).

All electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements HER catalytic performance of the electrocatalysts were characterized in 1 M KOH or 0.5 M H2SO4. A glass carbon electrode (GCE) with diameter of 3 mm was used as the working electrode; Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and graphite rod were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Before use, the GCE was polished with aluminum oxide powder and cleaned in alcohol and water. Next, 5 mg electrocatalyst and 100 μL Nafion (5 wt%) were dispersed into 900 μL water to form an ink solution through ultrasonication for several minutes. Then, 5 μL above ink solution was deposited onto the polished GCE and dried in vacuum for the following tests. Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) measurement was carried out with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests at different scan rates were performed to detect the electrochemically surface areas (ECSAs). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The stability of the catalysts was characterized by I-t test for 20 h. In order to analyze the contribution of HNCS on the catalytic activity, 1 M SCN− was introduced into the electrolyte and LSV tests were performed. For stability tests, to prevent the catalysts falling off from the electrode during the test, conductive carbon paper was chosen as working electrode. Specifically, 10 μL catalyst ink solution (5 mg/mL) was loaded onto the carbon paper (5 mm × 10 mm) for the I-t tests and the mass activities at different overpotentials were recorded. For ORR characterization, rotating disk electrode (RDE, 5.6 mm in diameter) was used as working electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode was used as reference electrode. 20 μL aforementioned ink solution was dropped onto the RDE and dried in vacuum for electrochemical characterization. Highly purified O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH were used as electrolyte. The catalytic activities of the electrocatalysts were firstly tested by LSV measurement at a series of rotation rate (400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 and 2400 r/min). The durability of the electrocatalysts were explored by cyclic CV for 8000 cycles. All recorded potentials were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)."
7,Result and discussion,"A schematic illustration for the synthesis process of the Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst is shown in Fig. 1 . Briefly, monodispersed SiO2 sphere was firstly prepared through Stöber method [50,51]. Then, a layer of polydopamine (PDA) was coated on the surface of SiO2 sphere serving as ligands for metal ions. Subsequently, Ru3+ was introduced and chelated on the surface of PDA layer homogeneously (Ru3+/PDA@SiO2). Afterward, the Ru3+/PDA@SiO2 hybrid was annealed at argon atmosphere. During thermolysis process, the PDA layer was converted into nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) shell, meanwhile, Ru3+ was reduced to ultra-small Ru nanoparticles and confined within the NC shell (Ru/NC@SiO2). The rigid polymer structure of PDA and the complexation between PDA and Ru3+ effectively facilitate the isolation of Ru nanoparticles and the prevention of aggregation. Finally, the inner SiO2 template was removed to obtain the hollow NC spheres coupled with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/HNCS). Low magnification TEM image in Fig. 2 a indicates that the Ru2.0/HNCS exhibits regular hollow spherical structure, which is inherited from the SiO2 template (Fig. S1). The diameter of the hollow spheres was statistical measured with 900 ± 30 nm. These regular hollow carbon spheres would establish a fluffy three-dimensional shell frame, which endows Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst a large gas adsorption capacity, expeditious mass transfer and facilitated electrolyte permeability. A close observation clearly shows the high-density ultrasmall nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within the hollow carbon shell without noticeable aggregation (Fig. 2b). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 2c) further verifies that ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles with average diameter of ∼1.8 ± 0.3 nm (Fig. 2d) are uniformly distributed within the carbon shell. Contrastively, the electrocatalysts with lower Ru contents present similar hollow sphere morphology with only the particle densities decreased (Fig. S2). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2e) clearly displays the lattice spacing of 0.23 nm, which can be attributed to (101) crystalline plane of metallic Ru [43,52]. Element distributions of Ru2.0/HNCS reveals that Ru, N, and C are uniformly distributed throughout entire sphere (Fig. 2f–i), which is consistent with the aforementioned result. Fig. 3 a shows the XRD spectrum of Ru2.0/HNCS. The strong peaks located at 38.5°, 42.2°, 44.1°, 58.5° and 69.6° can be well matched to the (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) planes of the metallic Ru (PDF no. 89-4903), respectively [52,53]. XPS survey spectrum of Ru2.0/HNCS (Fig. S3) confirms the presence of Ru, C and N elements. As displayed in Fig. 3b, the singlet peak of Ru 3p3/2 located at 461.6 eV [32,43]. With respect to the Ru 3d spectra in Fig. 3c, double peaks located at 283.5 and 279.8 eV belong to Ru 3d3/2 and Ru 3d5/2, respectively. These high-resolution XPS results confirmed the metallic state of Ru species [54]. Attention should be paid to the fact that the common surface oxidation did not appear in Ru/HNCS electrocatalysts, which indicates the great protection and stabilization effects of the HNCS support. For N 1s spectra (Fig. 3d), triplet peaks at 397.2, 398.1 and 400.7 eV imply the existence of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, respectively [48,55]. This result confirmed that the PDA layer in Ru3+/PDA@SiO2 was converted into nitrogen-doped carbon during pyrolysis process. Subsequently, Raman spectroscopy was employed to detect the structure defect on HNCS support. The peaks located at 1350 and 1580 cm−1, which are derived from D and G band of graphitic carbon (Fig. 3e). The dominant peak intensity of D band suggests the richness of defects sites in HNCS. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of Ru2.0/HNCS electrocatalyst shows a type-IV curve (Fig. 3f). The initial rapid N2 adsorption uptake at P/P0 < 0.1 means the existence of micropores, while the final N2 adsorption ascension indicating the presence of macropores. As shown in the inset in Fig. 3f, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of Ru2.0/HNCS was determined to be 291 m2/g, which ensures a wide interface for electrochemical reactions. Meanwhile, the total pore volume of 0.198 m3/g and pore size distribution also confirmed the porous structure. This porous structure would promote the gas adsorption and improve the availability of active sites. The HER performances of Ru/HNCS electrocatalysts were firstly investigated in 1 M KOH solution. For comparison, Ru/HNCS electrocatalysts with different Ru contents (Ru2.0/HNCS, Ru1.0/HNCS, Ru0.5/HNCS and Ru0.25/HNCS), HNCS and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) were measured under the same test conditions. The accurate Ru contents of all Ru/HNCS electrocatalysts were detected through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and listed in Table S1. The LSV curves of all electrocatalysts (Fig. 4 a) reveals that HNCS has negligible HER activity. Obviously, the Ru content has a remarkable impact on the HER performance. Compared with HNCS, Ru0.25/HNCS presents great improvement even with trace Ru, and η10 decreased to 180 mV. Continuously increase the Ru content to Ru0.5/HNCS, η10 value further decreased to 78 mV. However, further increase the Ru contents (Ru1.0/HNCS and Ru2.0/HNCS), the overpotential decreased unconsciously. Ru2.0/HNCS shows the highest HER activity with η10 about 72 mV. The corresponding Tafel slope decreased from 135 mV dec−1 for Ru0.25/HNCS to 67 mV dec−1 for Ru2.0/HNCS (Fig. 4b). We then normalized the electrode current to catalyst mass, as shown in Fig. S4a, for Ru2.0/HNCS catalyst, at potential of η10, the corresponding mass activity reaches 27 mA mg−1. To further identify the intrinsic activity of Ru/HNCS towards HER, the double-layer capacitance (C dl) was tested to analyze the ECSA of catalysts [56]. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at a series of scan rates (Fig. S5) were recorded to measure the C dl. The calculated C dl values for Ru0.25/HNCS, Ru0.5/HNCS, Ru1.0/HNCS and Ru2.0/HNCS are 1.72, 26.2, 33.9 and 38.1 mF cm−2, respectively. A larger C dl value means a larger ECSA and more exposed active sites. Naturally, the ECSA values increased with the content of Ru increased. Charge transfer resistance (R ct) of the electrocatalysts was investigated by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to the Nyquist plots (Fig. S5), the R ct of Ru0.5/HNCS, Ru1.0/HNCS and Ru2.0/HNCS were fitted to be 232, 83, and 116 Ω, respectively. The EIS result reveals a dependency relationship between conductivity and metal loading, and appropriate loading concentration is beneficial to promote the electron transfer. In addition, the nitrogen-doped carbon shell makes a great contribution to the good electro-conductivity. The electrocatalytic performance of Ru/HNCS toward HER in acidic condition (0.5 M H2SO4) was also tested. Fig. 4c shows the catalytic activity of Ru/HNCS present sharp increase and the over potentials decrease significantly as increase the Ru contents, similar with that in alkaline electrolyte. The LSV curves show that the η10 of Ru2.0/HNCS is only 39 mV, and the corresponding mass activity arrives 28 mA mg−1, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst. Especially, at high electrode current, its performance even superior to Pt/C. Meanwhile, Ru2.0/HNCS realize a low Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4d). However, the noble metal contents in Ru/HNCS is two orders lower than that in commercial Pt/C catalyst. Analogous, the ECSA detection and EIS tests (Fig. S6) reveal similar tendency with that in alkaline condition. We speculate that the excellent electrocatalytic activity arise from its structure characteristics: first, successive polymerization-chelation synthesis procedure facilitates Ru mainly coupled on the carbon sphere surface; second, by means of “strong metal-support interaction” in situ formation of ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles, which exposed more surficial active sites than larger ones. In order to gain an insight into the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, the exchange current densities (J exchange ) of the catalysts were calculated from Tafel slope by using extrapolation method (Fig. S7), and the turnover frequency (TOF) under J exchange were also calculated and listed in Table S2 and Table S3. When calculating the TOF, we normalized the hydrogen yield to the Ru loading amount, without considering the contribution of HNCS to the catalytic activity. However, when ultra-small metal nanoparticles loaded on the carbon materials, the carbon sites adjacent to the metal nanoparticles will be activated, resulting in improved catalytic activity. In order to analyze the contribution of HNCS to the catalytic activity, 1 M SCN− was introduced into the electrolyte, which could poison the metal sites. Through comparing the polarization curves (Fig. S8), it can be seen that HNCS also presents obvious catalytic activity for HER, especially in acidic medium. In addition, we compared the catalytic performance of our catalysts with many other noble-metal based HER electrocatalysts. From Table S4, we can see that the Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst shows comparable catalytic activity to precious metals. The stabilization of the Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst for HER was characterized through chronoamperometry at given potentials. As shown in Fig. 4e, at −50 mV vs. RHE, Ru2.0/HNCS presents a stable trend on the whole process within 20 h in 1 M KOH, and the fluctuation of the curve is caused by the hydrogen bubbles; However, when operated at high overpotential, the current shows obvious decrease. When tested in acidic electrolyte, the Ru2.0/HNCS electrocatalysts shows similar stability property (Fig. 4f). To further analyze the stability of catalyst, the Ru2.0/HNCS electrocatalysts after stability test was collected and characterized by XPS, XRD and HRTEM. The high resolution XPS spectrum of Ru 3d (284.9 eV) shifted to the high binding energy about 1 eV in comparison with original Ru/HNCS catalyst (Fig. S9), which indicates the surface oxidation of Ru nanoparticles. In addition, the hydrogen bubbles adsorption probably also makes the activity attenuation. As shown in Fig. S10, the XRD and HRTEM characterizations show that after long-time electrochemical process, the crystallinity of Ru nanoparticles decreased, while the XRD patterns still matched the metallic Ru well. From the HRTEM images, it can be seen that the Ru nanoparticles still anchored on the carbon spheres. Besides the superior HER activity, the resultant Ru/HNCS electrocatalysts is expected to be capable of catalyzing the ORR. To characterize the ORR efficiency of the as-synthesized Ru/HNCS electrocatalysts, LSV measurements were firstly performed in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions. As shown in Fig. 5 a, HNCS presents considerable ORR activity. As a kind of metal-free material, which can be ascribed to the nitrogen doping and porosity of the hollow carbon spheres. After coupled with high-density Ru nanoparticles, the electrocatalytic activity of Ru/HNCS for ORR were further boosted. Ru0.5/HNCS and Ru1.0/HNCS exhibited similar activities with half wave potential (E1/2) of 0.72 V and onset potentials (Eonset) of 0.83 V. The Tafel curves derived from the LSV curves reveal that Ru1.0/HNCS has a lower Tafel slope of 107 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5b). In addition, LSV measurements for Ru1.0/HNCS were tested at different rotation rates (Fig. 5c). The corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots were drawn to explore the reaction mechanisms [57]. An average electron transfer number (n) was fitted to be 3.97 (Fig. 5d), closing to the theoretical value of 4.0, which indicates that the catalytic mechanism on the Ru/HNCS catalyst is a four-electron pathway [58]. It is well accepted that, for ORR electrocatalyst, the anti-poisoning capability is also a key factor in practical fuel cells application [59]. In order to investigate the anti-poisoning capabilities, a mixed alkaline electrolyte containing 1.0 M CH3OH was selected to test the tolerance of Ru1.0/HNCS. As shown in Fig. 5e, the LSV curve remains almost unchanged in 1 M CH3OH electrolyte, indicating the broad applicability and good toxicity resistance of Ru/HNCS catalyst toward the ORR. The electrochemical stability of the Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst was evaluated through continued CV operation for 8000 cycles. Fig. 5f indicates that after long-time operation, the half-wave potential of Ru1.0/HNCS just negatively shift with 28 mV, which confirmed the excellent stability. The XRD and HRTEM characterizations of the catalyst after stability test further confirmed the stable structure and compositions (Fig. S10). Based on the analysis of above experimental observation, we believe that the excellent catalytic performance of Ru/HNCS is mainly derived from the synergistic effect between Ru and carbon sphere support: First, ultrasmall and homogeneously dispersed Ru nanoparticles provide a large amount of active sites; Second, the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres not only serve as anchor supports which prevent the aggregation and exfoliation of metal nanoparticles, but also improve the capacious surface area for O2 adsorption; Third, the rigid hollow carbon spheres build up a three-dimensional space in electrode, which is beneficial for mass transfer and diffusion. All of these favorable features render the Ru/HNCS an efficient HER and ORR electrocatalyst. In order to explore the universality of our proposed synthesis strategy, we also prepared transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) loaded composite catalysts through the same synthesis route. As shown in Fig. S11, it can be seen that our synthesis method is applicable for the preparation of ultra-small transition metal nanoparticles-based catalysts. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. S12, when used as electrocatalyst, owing to the ultra-low loading of transition metal nanoparticles, their catalytic activities are inferior in comparison to precious metal-based catalysts."
8,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized an efficient Ru-based dual-electrocatalyst through the pyrolysis of Ru3+ coordinated polydopamine spheres. The as-synthesized Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst with Ru content as low as 0.1% exhibited outstanding catalytic performance for both HER and ORR. For HER, a low η10 of 39 mV and fast reaction kinetics were achieved in acidic solution. When used as ORR electrocatalyst, Ru/HNCS demonstrated an E1/2 of 0.72 V and an Eonset of 0.83 V, as well as palmary anti-poisoning capability for methanol in basic electrolyte. More importantly, Ru/HNCS electrocatalyst possessed an unprecedented stability, which will provide an important enlightenment to solve the stability challenge of Ru-based catalysts. All above features make the Ru/HNCS as promising electrocatalyst for water splitting and fuel cell applications."
