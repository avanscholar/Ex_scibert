0,Introduction,"Pervaporation is a membrane-based, energy-efficient technique that consists of permeation and evaporation driven by a chemical potential gradient with a pressure difference across the membrane [1]. Membranes can either be organic (polymeric) [2], inorganic [3], or nano composite (inorganic filler embedded in polymer matrices) [4], and depending on the intended application, the membrane can be hydrophilic [5], hydrophobic [6], or target organophilic [7]. Mixed matrix membrane (nanocomposite) membranes have shown promising results for separating various alcohols and water azeotropes. Therefore, various types of fillers suitable for specific polymers have been explored. In this context, the use of metal organic frameworks comprising ZIF and UIO types [8,9], zeolites (inorganic) [10], graphene oxide (GO) [11], carbon nanotubes [12], titanium nanotubes [13], etc. as fillers in various polymer matrices have been explored for fabricating anti-trade-off membranes. Among these fillers, GO has the benefits of a high surface area (2600 m2g), smooth transport of permeates, and high thermal and mechanical stability in the polymer matrix. That is why GO has been incorporated into several polymer matrixes, such as chitosan, polyamide, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), to fabricate mixed matrix membranes [14]. However, owing to its poor dispersion in solvents and various polymer matrixes at high loading, GO is less popular in homogenous membrane fabrication. Furthermore, the appropriate dispersion of GO relies on the specific functionality interaction with the polymer phase; therefore, mass-scale synthesis with even particle size distribution of GO is difficult, increasing the membrane preparation cost and poor performance. The material called graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), similar to GO, also has a lamellar sheet-type structure. It consists of lamellar layers with tri-s-triazine base units. In a manner similar to GO, g-C3N4 exhibits excellent mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability characteristics. As it is synthesized from the thermal polymerization of an amine-containing source, it possesses a specific amount of primary and secondary amine functionality and thus exhibits a hydrophilic nature. Therefore, it exhibits good dispersity in water and interacts with polymers containing hydroxyl functionalities in their backbone through hydrogen bonding interactions. Furthermore, g-C3N4 can be exfoliated into two-dimensional nanosheets with several evenly distributed nanoholes across the entire lamellar structure [15,16]. According to the bond length and covalent radius, the geometric diameter of a nanopore is 0.311 nm [17]. Additionally, the interlayer stacking distance between sheets is 0.3 to 0.4 nm [18], which is slightly larger than the kinetic diameter of water (approximately 0.28 nm) [19]. Therefore, water can be easily transported through these pores and the interlayer spacing while other molecules of larger size face a transport barrier owing to the higher aspect ratio of g-C3N4 sheets during the separation. Therefore, the mixed matrix membrane prepared via g-C3N4 incorporation may exhibit excellent dehydration performance in pervaporation. However, to date, only a few studies have been focused on g-C3N4 polymer composite membranes. Cao et al. fabricated a highly water-selective hybrid membrane by incorporating g-C3N4 nanosheets in a sodium alginate polymer matrix and used it for the pervaporation of water/ethanol mixtures [16]. Their study optimized a 3 wt.%-loading g-C3N4 membrane that exhibited the highest pervaporation flux of 2,469 g/m2h with a high separation factor of 1653 at 76 °C with 10 wt.% water content in the feed. Wang et al. fabricated a membrane using g-C3N4 prepared from the thermal oxidization of melamine embedded in a PVA matrix and employed it in the pervaporation of water and ethanol mixtures [20]. They reported that the thermal and hydrophilicity of the g-C3N4 nanocomposite membranes were significantly improved. Furthermore, a significant improvement in the pervaporation performance was reported with a flux of 6,332 g/m2h and separation factor of 30.7 for a 90 wt.% ethanol-feed concentration. In their next study, they modified the g-C3N4 sheets without destroying the g-C3N4 crystal unit by using hydrogen peroxide to introduce a carboxylic group and further modified it with a polydopamine (PDA) coating and embedded it in the PVA polymer matrix [21]. Among the three different PVA–g-C3N4 nanocomposite membranes, they reported the best results for the PDA-modified g-C3N4–PVA composite membrane, with a separation factor of 57.9 and flux of 2328 g/m2h at 70 °C for 90 wt.% ethanol in the feed. As explained above, the g-C3N4 generally synthesized from the precursor consists of a series of carbon-rich nitrogen groups such as melamine. However, g-C3N4 synthesized directly from the melamine precursor via thermal polymerization produced bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) having a higher thickness (greater than 90 nm) due to multiple sheets were stacked on each other. The theoretical thickness of monolayer of g-C3N4 ca. 0.325 nm [22]. Generally, in the separation mechanism of molecules, the molecular sieving can be exhibited by two ways 1) through the intrinsic pore of g-C3N4 and 2) through the interlayer spacing of two-dimensional material [18]. Therefore, molecular sieving could be more effective if these pores become more patulous. Protonated interlayers of g-C3N4 intercalation by anion from the acid is an efficient technique for tuning these pores to make them accessible. It has been reported that the interlayer spacing can be enlarged up to 1.08 nm by this method. [18]. Additionally, due to anion (acid) intercalation, the partial exfoliation also takes place, making structural pore patulous. Therefore, in this study, acid treatment of BCN was performed to exfoliate it with a decrease in particle size by partial decomposition in sulfuric acid to produce acid-treated g-C3N4 (ACN) [23]. Furthermore, hydrophilic modification of ACN was performed by glycidol treatment to introduce a hydroxyl functionality in ACN to obtain glycidol-modified g-C3N4 (GCN). The above report prompted the exploration of g-C3N4 as a filler in the field of pervaporation, as g-C3N4-polymer nanocomposite membranes exhibit a significant pervaporation output in ethanol/water separation. However, changes in the feed, such as isopropanol/water (because 87.7 wt.% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in water results in an azeotropic boiling mixture at 80.4 °C) [24-25], and the pervaporation dehydration output from the g-C3N4 nanocomposite membrane are required to be investigated. PVA is a widely used hydrophilic membrane material with excellent thermal, mechanical, and chemical resistance and an excellent membrane forming property [26,27]. Owing to the high hydroxyl functionality of PVA molecules for modification, the ease of chemical crosslinking of certain reagents such as glutaraldehyde is possible. In this manner, the swelling of membranes prepared using PVA can be controlled. In this study, BCN nanosheets were synthesized via the thermal polymerization melamine precursor. In a subsequent step, sulfuric acid followed by glycidol treatment was performed to obtain the partially exfoliated ACN and GCN. Finally, different PVA–g-C3N4 nanocomposite membranes were prepared by incorporating BCN, ACN, and GCN nanosheets into the PVA solution and coating the alumina hollow fiber (AHF) via dip-coating technique and utilized for evaluation of pervaporation dehydration ability with isopropanol/water mixture."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Melamine (99.5 %) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). PVA of molecular weight 88000–97000 (98–99% degree of hydrolysis) was procured from Alfa Aesar (USA). The porous AHF support was donated by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (South Korea). All other laboratory chemicals, such as glutaraldehyde (25 wt.% aqueous solution), isopropanol, hydrochloric acid (36.0%, w/w), and sulfuric acid, were purchased from Dae-Jung Chemicals & Metal Co. (Korea). Glycidol (99.5 %) was procured from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). For the pervaporation experiment, water/IPA mixtures were prepared in the laboratory by mixing a predetermined quantity of each (w/w). The sponge-like morphology with outer diameter 0.2894 cm and inner diameter 0.222 cm of alumina hollow fiber having spherical pore shape (∼500 nm) confirmed in our previous study [11] was used as support."
3,"Synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride forms: BCN, ACN, and GCN","2.2 Synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride forms: BCN, ACN, and GCN Different forms of g-C3N4 were synthesized from melamine precursors using the thermal polymerization method. First, 200 g of melamine powder was weighed in a clean stainless steel vessel, covered with lead, and heated from room temperature in a furnace at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to achieve a final temperature of 550 °C and maintained for 12h (calcination). After cooling to room temperature, a pale-yellow product called bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) was obtained. The obtained BCN powder was crushed in a mortar to a size of 200 µm. Then, it was dispersed in a dilute HCl (10 wt.%) solution with 30 minutes’ sonication and filtered using Whatman filter paper (repeated twice). After that, it was washed (twice) with copious amounts of deionized (DI) water. The BCN powder thus obtained was dried entirely in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and then stored under ambient conditions in a glass bottle. Next, ACN was synthesized using BCN, 10 g of BCN powder was added gently into 300 ml of a concentrated H2SO4 solution. The resultant mixture was sonicated for 30 minutes in an ultrasonic bath (intensity set at 100 W). Subsequently, the resultant suspension was slowly added to cold water (0 °C). During the process from sonication to cooling, the yellowed suspension became clear and turned opaque with dispersed white particles due to the exfoliation of BCN. Then, the resultant opaque white suspension was filtered and washed with DI water and IPA twice each to eliminate the sulfuric acid. It was dried using a procedure similar to that used for the BCN and ACN powder and stored in a clean glass bottle. Glycidol-modified carbon nitride (GCN) was synthesized using glycidol and ACN powder. Three grams of ACN powder was dispersed in 300 ml of 0.1-M glycidol in DI water, and the resultant suspension was heated to 80 °C and constantly stirred for 3 days. GCN powder was then obtained by following a similar washing and drying procedure to that used for ACN, and it was stored in a glass bottle under ambient conditions."
4,Preparation of g-C3N4- PVA nanocomposite coated AHF membranes,"2.3 Preparation of g-C3N4- PVA nanocomposite coated AHF membranes First, PVA powder (5 g) was dissolved in 95 g of DI water by constant stirring and heating to 90 °C on a hot plate for 5 h. After that, a clear PVA solution (5 wt.%) was filtered to remove undissolved matter, sonicated to remove air bubbles, and allowed to stand for 12 h to eliminate effervescence. To the resultant solution, 0.25 ml of glutaraldehyde solution and 0.03 ml hydrochloric acid were added and stirred for 30 min, followed by sonication for 10 min. Then, the resultant solution was transferred to a measuring cylinder and coated on the previously one-end-sealed AHF using the dip-coating method. The PVA-coated AHF was dried at room temperature for 1 day, followed by a second coating, then dried again for 1 day, and transferred to an oven at 80 °C for 1 h for curing. The PVA-coated AHF membrane is denoted as CPVA. To prepare the g-C3N4–PVA nanocomposite AHF membranes, 0.1 g (2 wt.% loading with respect to the PVA content) of BCN, ACN, and GCN each were dispersed in the aforementioned PVA–GA solution and sonicated using an ultrasonicator (Branson Sonifier 450) at a 20% duty cycle for 1 h. A similar procedure to that used previously was used to prepare the CPVA, and the final membranes were denoted as P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, and P-GCN-2. For the optimization of the filler content for pervaporation output, membranes of various GCN contents were prepared and denoted as P-GCN-4, P-GCN-6, and P-GCN-8. Thus, a higher amount of GCN (e.g., 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 with respect to the PVA content) was added to the PVA solution. A higher loading amount (more than 8 wt.%) resulted in a brittle and relatively fragile membrane, and therefore, the maximum amount of GCN used was 8 wt.% loading. The thickness of the active layer (with two coatings) for all the nanocomposite membranes was approximately 9 µm, as confirmed by FE-SEM analysis. The CPVA, P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, P-GCN-2, P-GCN-4, P-GCN-6, and P-GCN-8 free-standing films (50 µm) were also prepared for the characterization of the active layer. The coating solutions prepared for each membrane were cast on a glass plate with an applicator, allowed to dry for 24 h, and then heated in an oven at 80 °C for 1 h. The films were then peeled away from the glass plate."
5,Characterization techniques,"2.4 Characterization techniques The BCN, ACN, and GCN powders were scanned using attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy (ATR mode of FT-IR, Nicolet iS10, USA) within the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1, and the functional group modification chemistry of the g-C3N4 nanosheet was observed. The XRD pattern (2θ= 5–60°at a speed of 5°/min) of the BCN, ACN, and GCN powders were recorded. The crystalline nature of the different forms of g-C3N4 nanosheets was confirmed using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Japan, D/Max 2500) at λ = 1.5406, Cu Kα radiation source at 45 kV and 15 mA. AFM was used in tapping mode (AFM: Model-I con-PT-Plus, Bruker) of BCN, ACN, and GCN particles and CPVA, P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, P-GCN-2 analysis. For the membranes AFM profile, samples were mounted on the glass slide and analyzed. With supplied software (Nano scope analysis 1.5) the root mean square surface roughness (RMS) was calculated. The core-level element chemistry of BCN, ACN, and GCN particles was determined by an XPS investigation (Multi lab 2000, Shimadzu, Japan, and Kratos HP Thermo VG scientific, UK, with a 200-W Al Kα monochromatic X-ray source). TEM images of the BCN, ACN and GCN particles previously dispersed in isopropanol (0.1 wt.%) were obtained using a JECL (Japan) JEM-2100F transmittance electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The cross-sectional and surface morphologies of all the membrane samples were evaluated using a field-emission scanning microscope (Vega II LSU, Tescan, Czech Republic). The membrane samples were fractured in liquefied nitrogen, coated with silver sputtering prior to analysis, and scanned with the focus of the electron beam on it. The static contact angle of the water droplet on all the membrane samples was measured using a contact angle analyzer (Phoenix 300, South Korea). Based on the shape of the water droplet at the membrane surfaces after 10 s, the contact angles were measured using the supplied software. Every sample was analyzed twice, and the average value of the contact angle (standard deviation less than 2) was reported. The thermal behavior of all the membrane samples was determined by diffraction scanning calorimetry (DSC, Perkin Elmer, USA) in nitrogen environments. The mechanical characteristics of all the membrane specimens were determined using a UTM (AGX-X, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with Trapezium software. The membrane samples were dried in a vacuum oven (25°C) and cut to a size of 25 × 100 mm prior to the analysis."
6,Swelling degree measurements,"2.5 Swelling degree measurements The swelling behavior of all the free-standing membrane samples in IPA/water (80/20, w/w) was calculated. The samples previously dried in a vacuum oven (25 °C) were weighed and then immersed in the feed solution. Subsequently, they were maintained in the same condition (40 °C) to realize equilibrium swelling; after 24 h, they were removed and blotted with tissue paper and weighed on an electron weighing balance. The degree of membrane swelling was calculated using the following equation. (1) Swelling degree ( % ) = Weight ( g ) of swelled sample − Weight ( g ) dried sample Weight of dried sample ( g ) × 100"
7,Pervaporation setup for dehydration test,"2.6 Pervaporation setup for dehydration test Pervaporation dehydration experiments were conducted using the setup described in our previous study [7]. The different feed solutions (80/20, 85/15, and 90/10) were poured into the feed tank and circulated at a speed of 70 L/h, and the temperature of feed tank was controlled by water bath (from 40 °C to 60 °C) for the tests. The membranes were fitted in the membrane cell, and the vacuum applied on the downstream side was less than 1 torr for each test. The permeate solution collected in trap (covered with cylinder containing liquefied nitrogen) was measured using an electronic weighing balance (having a 0.001g precision). The weight fractions of each component in the feed and permeated solutions were determined using gas chromatographs (DS Science, DS7200) (GC). Based on the design of the membrane cell, the area through which pervaporation dehydration occurred was 0.0019643 m2. The following equation was used to determine the permeation rate (flux) and membrane selectivity (separation factor). (2) Flux ( J ) ( kg / m 2 h ) = Weight ( kg ) of permeate solution obtained after test effective membrane area ( A ) ( m 2 ) × total operation time t ( h ) (3) Separation factor ( α ) = P ( water ) / P ( IPA ) F ( water ) / F ( IPA where P and F denote the weight fractions of water and IPA in the permeate and feed solutions, respectively, as obtained from the GC analysis. For evaluation of reproducibility, repeated (twice) pervaporation experiments have been conducted for every membrane sample."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of g-C3N4 nanosheets,"3.1 Characterization of g-C3N4 nanosheets Fig. 1 presents the FTIR (ATR mode) spectra of the BCN, ACN, and GCN nanosheets. All the spectra comprise peaks in the range of 3000–3400 cm−1, which is attributed to the stretching vibration of amine groups [28], as these peaks were broadened in the case of ACN owing to the slight oxidation of g-C3N4 by strong sulfuric acid and even more broadened in cased of GCN owing to the presence of a hydroxyl moiety due to the ring opening of the epoxide in glycidol due to either the amino or hydroxyl from ACN. The other peaks at 1655, 1550, 1400–1455, 1316, 1220, 900–1090, and 790 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of the tris-triazine ring units of g-C3N4, while that at 1390 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of the s-triazine present in the all the BCN, ACN, and GCN nanosheets. This indicates that both s-triazine and tris-triazine were retained and simultaneously present in all the types of g-C3N4 nanosheets under consideration [28-30]. Furthermore, the peak at 1143 cm−1 observed in the spectra of the GCN sheets represents the C–N stretch vibration, and it corresponds to the aliphatic secondary amine due to the ring opening of glycidol by the amino group in g-C3N4. Figs. 2 a–f reflect the deconvoluted XPS spectra of the C1s and O1s core levels of the BCN (a and b), ACN (c and d), and GCN (e and f) nanosheets. As in the BCN, ACN, and GCN cases, the core-level N1s region has deconvoluted (fitted) four peaks at binding energies of 398.9, 399.6, 401.3, and 405 eV corresponding to heptazine N; aromatic amide, imide N, or cyanoquinone N; graphitic N; and oxidic N, respectively [31,32]. The O1s level region has deconvoluted two peaks for BCN at binding energies of 532.5 eV and 533.3 eV corresponding to C=O and N–O, respectively. However, in the case of the ACN and GCN O1s level region, along with these peaks, an additional peak was observed at a binding energy of 531.8 eV corresponding to the C–OH groups [33]. This additional hydroxyl functionality was observed owing to the ring opening of glycidol by amine in g-C3N4, and this analysis supports the aforementioned FTIR results. Therefore, based on the FTIR and XPS results, the postulated reaction is presented in Fig. 3 . Fig 4 . presents the XRD patterns of the BCN, ACN, and GCN nanosheets, wherein XRD pattern of BCN exhibit peaks at 2θ = 27.62° (strong peak) and 12.92°, corresponding to the 002 (d = 0.32 nm) plane of the stacked conjugated aromatic plane and 100 plane (d = 0.69 nm) of the structural packing of tri-s-triazine units, respectively [21, 28]. Therefore, it suggested that all the types of g-C3N4 under consideration have a triangular nanopore within the tri-s-triazine units [16]. However, in the case of ACN, the (002) diffraction peak shifted to 27.12o (d =0.34 nm) and that for GCN to 26.77 (d =0.34 nm) and additionally, intensities for both of these peaks were decreased. This result speculates that interlayer distance was expanded due to the intercalation of sulfuric acid. Additionally, peak intensity for (100) plane assigned for structural packing of tri-s-triazine units was significantly enhanced with modification, which dictates the exfoliation of g-C3N4 and formation of few layers of intercalated acid molecules [22,34]. Furthermore, new diffraction peaks at 18.44o, and 24.62o due to 002n plane indicating the new phase interlayer spacing of 0.48 nm and 0.36 nm were produced [18]. Therefore, overall, from the XRD study, it was confirmed that exfoliation of BCN gives an ACN and further its modification with glycidol produced GCN. Thereby, both ACN and GCN have higher interlayer spacing, and the triangular pore of structural triazine units became more patulous. To investigate the morphology of the BCN, ACN, and GCN nanosheets, TEM and AFM investigations were conducted; the corresponding images are presented in Fig. 5 a and b. From the TEM images, it can be observed that all the types of g-C3N4 have a two-dimensional thin (ultra) structure similar to graphene. Since BCN are not exfoliated and unmodified, therefore, as expected, their obvious sheets aggregation and a large number of sheets were stacked to each other can be seen in the TEM images. On the other hand, in the ACN case, a few of the sheets were stacked. However, in GCN, due to functionalization with glycidol and the exfoliation, complete dispersion in the solvent took place during the sample preparation. As a result, the apparent ultra-thin structure of nanosheets was apparent observed. The approximate thicknesses of the BCN, ACN, and GCN sheets were 80 nm, 10 nm, and 2–3 nm, respectively, as obtained by probing the samples using AFM. In terms of the acid modification of the g-C3N4 sheets, exfoliation was performed. The higher decrement of the thickness of g-C3N4 sheets seems to be more profound by the glycidol modification observed."
10,Characterization of g-C3N4–PVA nanocomposite membranes,"3.2 Characterization of g-C3N4–PVA nanocomposite membranes The solid-state morphologies of the CPVA, P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, and P-GCN-2 membranes were examined via FE-SEM analysis, surface (supplementary information file Fig.4s), and cross-sectional images of all the types of g-C3N4 nanocomposite membranes are presented in Fig. 6 a. It can be observed that g-C3N4 exhibits good compatibility with PVA as it is merged well in the polymer matrix at the molecular level, and even in images captured at high magnification (1 µm), slight changes in cross-sectional images of P-ACN-2 and P-GCN-2 was observed. This is because, hydroxyl modification enhances the hydrogen bonding interaction between the g-C3N4 nanosheets and the PVA polymer matrix. However, owing to the higher sheet thickness, as observed in the AFM investigation, in the case of P-BCN-2, a slight agglomeration was observed, which almost disappeared in the case of the P-GCN-2 sheet. Overall, all the membranes were homogenous, and no visible voids or cracks were observed in the FE-SEM investigation. On increasing the GCN nanosheet content from 2 wt.% to 8 wt.%, the smooth membrane morphology became rough, as can be observed in Fig 6 b. In the case of 8 wt.% loading of the GCN sheet, agglomeration with a void can be observed. In order to examine the surface roughness of CPVA, P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, and P-GCN-2 membranes, the AFM analysis was performed for all the membranes and depicted in Fig 6 c. The root mean square surface roughness found to be decreased from P-BCN-2 (6.23 nm), P-ACN-2 (5.21 nm), and P-GCN-2 (2.38 nm) was observed. This result well supports the FE-SEM results, as GCN exhibited excellent interaction with PVA molecular chains and acquired interstitial space between them. Therefore, surface roughness decreased with modification of g-C3N4 types [35]. The cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the P-GCN-6 membrane with an increased number of dip-coating processes are presented in Fig. 7 . By increasing the dip coating time, as expected, the active layer thickness increased from 4 to 39 µm. In all the cases, the PVA–g-C3N4 nanocomposite active layer and alumina support showed good compatibility, which was observed in the FE-SEM images and may be due to hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups in PVA and the alumina support. A DSC analysis of the CPVA, P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, and P-GCN-2 membranes was performed to observe the chain mobility and rigidity of PVA with the addition of g-C3N4. The glass transition temperatures were calculated from the DSC curve shown in Fig.8a. The Tg values for P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, and P-GCN-2 were 142.2 °C, 149.1 °C, and 151.7 °C, respectively, and were higher than those of the CPVA (80 °C) membrane. This data predicts the good dispersion of g-C3N4 in the PVA matrix due to the efficacious interaction and bonding of g-C3N4 with PVA functional moieties. It also reduces the segmental motion of the PVA chain and increases the rigidity of the membranes [36]. The hydroxyl modification of g-C3N4 in GCN and its strong interaction with the PVA chain were further confirmed by the strain–strength graph shown in Fig. 8 b. It can be observed from Fig. 8 b that the tensile strength was increased significantly in the order of the nanosheet types of CPVA (38.05 MPa) <P-BCN-2 (38.56 MPa) < P-ACN-2 (46.29 MPa) < P-GCN-2 (56.61 MPa). On the other hand, fracture strain has decreased in opposite order, such as CPVA (110%) > BCN (68.2%) > ACN (48.6%) > GCN (43.2 %). The increase in the mechanical properties (tensile strength) of PVA upon incorporating g-C3N4 is due to the inherent high strength of the g-C3N4 nanosheets [37-38]. However, it leads to increased stiffness of the membrane. Additionally, a higher degree of increment in tensile strength and decrement of fracture strain in thin g-C3N4 nanosheets (BCN and GCN) incorporated membranes was attributed to their enhancement of dispersion in polymer matrix. Furthermore, it was more profound in P-GCN-2, due to the hydrophilic modification of GCN particle could exhibit an excellent interfacial interaction with PVA chain, which leads to constraining their movement with results in increased brittleness of membrane [39]. Interfacial interactions between g-C3N4 and the PVA polymer were interpreted using FTIR spectroscopy. Fig. 9 presents the FTIR spectra of the CPVA, P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, and P-GCN-2 membranes. The FTIR vibrational frequencies between 3000 and 3350 cm−1 corresponding to the OH stretching peak were found to shift to red, while the incorporation of g-C3N4 into the PVA matrix was observed. This was increasingly significant in the order of the g-C3N4 sheet types of BCN < ACN < GCN, which suggests a hydrogen bonding interaction between the amino group and hydroxyl (in the case of ACN and GCN in the g-C3N4 nanosheets and hydroxyl from PVA) [16, 20, 40]. Other peaks corresponding to g-C3N4 could have overlapped with that of the PVA peak; however, an additional peak between 900 and 1000 cm−1 corresponding to the tris-triazine ring units of g-C3N4 was observed in all the g-C3N4 samples, which confirms the interaction and dispersion of g-C3N4 at the molecular level in the PVA matrix."
11,Pervaporation,"3.3 Pervaporation 3.3.1 Effect of different types of g-C3N4 on pervaporation of water/IPA mixtures Figs. 10 a present the effect of different types of g-C3N4 on the pervaporation separation performance of the g-C3N4–PVA nanocomposite coated AHF membranes at 40 °C with a feed solution of an 80/20 (w/w) IPA/water mixture. The flux for the CPVA of 0.236 kg/m2h decreases to 0.143 kg/m2h for P-BCN-2 and then increases to 0.185 kg/m2h for P-ACN-2 and further to 0.199 kg/m2h for P-GCN-2. However, the separation factor from the CPVA (79) membrane increased in the order of the g-C3N4 nanosheet types of BCN (92) < ACN (107) < GCN (139) in the membrane. This phenomenon can be explained by using DSC and mechanical testing analysis, as a change in the g-C3N4 nanosheet type could increase the Tg value of the membranes; therefore, the rigidity of the membrane was also influenced. This result is because the permeation barrier for transportation through the membrane was increased in the g-C3N4 nanocomposite membrane, and the flux was found to be lower than that of the CPVA membrane. However, the increased hydrophilicity predicted by the contact angle measurement presented in Fig. 10 b owing to the additional hydroxyl moieties in g-C3N4 in the case of ACN and GCN (confirmed from FTIR and XPS investigations) results in an increase of membrane swelling in feed solution (presented in Fig. 10 b); therefore, the permeation of small molecules, such as water, was found to be increased, and thus, the total flux also increased. The same trend of swelling degree value in water and that of opposite in IPA was observed with different types of g-C3N4 (supplementary information file Fig.3s). Nevertheless, for all the membranes, the swelling degree in IPA is negligibly low. Several studies have reported similar rigid behavior in the membrane and a decrease in flux with filler loading [13,41]. In all the types of g-C3N4 under consideration, the pores in the g-C3N4 sheets exhibit a molecular sieving action through tiny triangular nanopores of s-triazine and interlayer spacing between them, that promote higher water permeation than IPA. Additionally, the XRD study confirmed that enhancement of interlayer spacing and the tiny pore became more patulous with treatments. Furthermore, as observed in the FE-SEM and AFM studies, the nanosheets became less thick with acid treatment followed by glycidol treatment. Therefore, the distribution of g-C3N4 nanosheets in the PVA matrix could also improve with this treatment, and due to that water molecular sieving through the tiny pore and smooth interlayer spacing was more profound in ACN and GCN loaded membranes. Moreover, the separation factor is improved on changing the type of g-C3N4 sheets owing to hydrophilic modification, which promotes hydrophilic–hydrophilic interactions with water molecules. It is well known that permeation in pervaporation through a hydrophilic membrane occurs via the jumping of the water molecule from one site to another [42]. This is because the separation factor increases monotonously in the order of P-BCN-2 < P-ACN-2 < P-GCN-2 membranes. From the above results, among the P-BCN-2, P-ACN-2, and P-GCN-2 membranes, P-GCN-2 realized the highest pervaporation output with a flux of 0.199 kg/m2h and separation factor of 139, and it was thus optimized. To further determine the pervaporation potential of GCN, it was necessary to optimize the content in the PVA matrix; therefore, the loading of GCN was increased. Fig. 11 a presents the effects of the GCN content in the PVA matrix loading on the pervaporation separation output in terms of flux and separation factor using the 80/20 (w/w) IPA/water feed at 40 °C. The slight decrease in flux (0.199 to 0.140) and the increase in the separation factor (139.9 to 241) with content (from 2wt.% to 6 wt.% loading) can be observed in Fig. 11 a. The water content in the permeate also increased up to a 6 wt.% loading of the GCN. The decrease in the flux was attributed to the increased in the rigidity of the membrane, as observed in the FE-SEM investigation. At 8 wt.% loading, the membrane exhibited conglomeration of the GCN particles and was more brittle, which resulted in the production of a non-selective void in the membrane; therefore, the flux, separation factor, and water content in the membrane were decreased [43]. As the GCN is modified with a hydroxyl group, which causes physical bonding (intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction) with the PVA chain, the polymer free volume is reduced as the compactness of the membrane is increased, which became increasingly significant with the GCN loading. This results in a decrease in the degree of membrane swelling, as confirmed by Fig. 11 b. However, an increase in the GCN loading causes an increase in the hydrophilicity of the membrane, as confirmed by the contact angle investigation presented in Fig. 11 b. The contact angle of water on the GCN loading decreased from 56.44° for a 0 wt.% loading to 38.21° for 8 wt.% loading, which results in a higher membrane affinity for water molecules, and its separation factor was thus found to increase up to a 6 wt.% loading. However, in the case of 8 wt.% loading, non-selective permeation of IPA could have occurred through the void around the non-physically bonded agglomerated GCN sheets, which results in a lower separation factor. Moreover, for an 8 wt. % loading, the flux was also found to be decreased; this is because the GCN could act as a nucleating agent with the loading and could result in an increase in the crystallinity of the membrane, which increases the permeation barriers for the transport of permeation molecules [16]. Nevertheless, the separation factor decrement was more than that of the CPVA membrane, which indicates that molecular sieving occurred through the nanopores of s-triazine. 3.3.2 Operating condition effect The operating conditions were changed by decreasing the water content in the feed (10 to 20 wt.%), and the results thus obtained are presented in Fig. 12 a and 12b. The pervaporation performance through the different GCN loaded membranes followed the same trends of flux and separation factor for all the feed composition ranges. In general, for either the pristine polymer or nanocomposite membrane, if the driving force of the desired component (i.e., water in this study) increases, resulting in a higher permeation rate and causing increased swelling due to the plasticization of the membrane, the permeation of water along with the associated IPA molecule also increases, which results in a decrease in the separation factor [7,10,13, 25]. In industrial applications, membranes should operate flexibly in various temperature ranges; therefore, it is necessary to examine the influence of temperature on the performance of the membrane. Fig. 13 a presents the influence of temperature on the P-GCN-6 membrane; the flux was found to be significantly increased (0.154 to 0.286 kg/m2h), while the separation factor decreased from 241 to 66.9 as the temperature was increased from 40 °C to 60 °C. A possible reason for this is that, as the temperature increases, the vapor pressure on the feed side increases because of the thermal agitation of the polymer chain, which results in an increase in the free volume of the membrane. The permeation of both water and IPA occurs at a faster rate through the expanded membrane (larger free volume) [25,43]. By applying the Arrhenius equation given below to the temperature dependence of the flux, the graph of natural log as a function of temperature was plotted, as shown in Fig. 13 b [44]. (4) Flux ( J i ) = A p . e − E a / R T where Ji (kg/m2h), T (K), R (J/mol K), Ap (kg/m2h), and Ea (kJ/mol) are the flux of component i, absolute temperature, universal gas constant, pre-exponential factor, and apparent energy of activation for the permeation, respectively. Eqs 1, 2, 3, (4) By evaluating the slope of the linear equation, the apparent energy of activation (Ea) for permeation was calculated for water (24.89 kJ/mol), and it was found to be lower than that for IPA (80.71 kJ/mol). The positive values of Ea for both water and IPA suggest that the permeation of both components is sensitive to temperature. 3.3.3 Effect of thickness and evaluation of long-term durability Based on Fick's law of diffusion, it can be predicted that the flux increases by decreasing the membrane thickness [45]. Fig. 14 presents the effect of the membrane thickness on the flux and separation factor for the P-GCN-6 membrane at 40 °C. The flux was found to decrease linearly with the membrane thickness. The separation factor varied slightly when the membrane thickness increased from 9.2 to 39 µm and was comparatively low at thicknesses less than 9.2 µm. This could have been owing to defects in the active layer of the membrane of thickness less than 9.2 µm, which results in unfavorable transport across the membrane. A similar observation was reported in the study of Koops et al., wherein an investigation was conducted on the dehydration of acetic acid [45]. For the purpose of industrial application, the long-term durability of P-GCN-6 in terms of pervaporation performance was evaluated. Continuous testing was performed for 240 h with intermittent sampling at a feed ratio of 80/20 w/w IPA/water at 40 °C. The pervaporation output in terms of flux and separation factor over time was evaluated, as shown in Fig. 15 . The P-GCN-6 membrane demonstrated a constant flux, and separation factor (water content in the permeate) remained high (99.0 wt.%). Therefore, based on the reproducibility of the long pervaporation performance of the P-GCN-6 membrane, it can be predicted that the P-GCN-6 membrane can be used industrially without the need for any membrane regeneration for a long time. The optimized pervaporation output in this study for P-GCN-2 membrane was compared with the performance from the other 2D and carbon nano material incorporated membrane and depicted in Table 1s. Based on the table, it can be stated that the membrane produced in this study has comparable dehydration ability compared to that reported in the literature."
12,Conclusions,"For the pervaporation separation of IPA/water mixtures, membranes comprising different types of g-C3N4 nanosheets, namely, BCN, ACN, and GCN, were successfully accommodated in a PVA polymer matrix solution and coated on an AHF. Among the three types of g-C3N4 nanosheets under consideration, GCN demonstrated the highest pervaporation output owing to the following reasons: 1) Hydroxyl moieties on the g-C3N4 could have increased the uniform dispersion in the PVA matrix with hydrogen bonding interaction, 2) a molecular sieving effect could have occurred, as the permeation of water through the nanopores of ultra-thin two-dimensional nanosheets as well as through the interlayer spacing could be much smoother as compared to that in other hybrid membranes owing to the ultra-thin nature of the GCN, and 3) the hydrophilicity of the membrane due to hydrophilic GCN accommodation could have increased its water affinity as compared to that of IPA. Therefore, the GCN-accommodated membrane demonstrated the highest pervaporation output with a flux of 0.199 kg/m2h and separation factor of 139.8 at an 80/20 (w/w, IPA/water) feed mixture at 40 °C. Furthermore, the pervaporation output was optimized with a higher loading of the GCN nanosheets, and 6 wt.% loading resulted in an optimum result with a flux 0.156 kg/m2h and separation factor of 241. The GCN nanosheets (P-GCN-6)-accommodated PVA membrane exhibited the highest mechanical strength, well-controlled PVA membrane swelling, and long-term durability in pervaporation; therefore, it can be concluded that the hydroxyl-functionalized modification of ultra-thin g-C3N4 nanosheets-accommodated membranes can provide excellent candidates for application in the pervaporation of IPA/water mixtures."
