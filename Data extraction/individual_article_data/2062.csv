0,Introduction,"Most of the worldwide energy consumption derives from fossil fuels, such as natural gas and oil. However, fossil fuels are non-renewable, and their use in combustion processes generates pollution [1]. Because of the progressive decrease of fossil fuel reserves and the pollution caused by their utilization, hydrogen is considered nowadays an attractive alternative energy source [2]. In this contest, the development of technologies for sustainable production of hydrogen from renewable resources, including biomass and water, is becoming very attractive [3]. In particular, food industry wastewaters contain various organic compounds, such as sugars, which can be converted into hydrogen through appropriate procedures [4,5]. Photoelectrocatalysis is one such procedure, which is classified among the low-cost technologies in the hydrogen-based energy system [3] and allows hydrogen production by degradation of organic compounds present in wastewater [6,7] or by water splitting itself in the absence of any sacrificial agent [8,9]. Photoelectrocatalysis can also allow to degrade organic pollutants both from wastewater and gaseous phase [10–13]. In a typical photoelectrocatalytic process, the organic substance and/or water is oxidized at the photoanode while hydrogen is produced at the cathode by reduction of protons or water [8]. Reduction is effectuated by electrons flowing through an external circuit from the photoanode to the counter electrode. The photoanode carries a nanostructured oxidation photocatalyst, typically an oxide semiconductor, while the cathode carries a reduction electrocatalyst. Among the various oxide semiconductors, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is very attractive because of its bandgap (Eg≈2.2eV) which allows utilization of a considerable portion of solar energy [8,14,15]. Moreover, hematite is an environmentally friendly, abundant, non-toxic material and it is very stable in aqueous solutions. However, hematite, in its pure phase, has some limitations with regard to the desired efficiency for solar water splitting. This is due to its poor charge transfer characteristics, low electron mobility, short hole diffusion length and its high recombination rate of the photogenerated holes and electrons [16,17]. A promising method to improve the photoelectrochemical properties of hematite is to introduce dopant atoms such as Zr, Cr, Mo, Zn, Cd, Ni, Pt, Ti, Si and Ge [14,18,19]. There are several methods to synthesize doped hematite such as hydrothermal method [17,20], spray pyrolysis [21], sol-gel method [22] and electrochemical deposition [19,23–25]. The latter method is advantageous, being inexpensive in both materials and energy consumption because it is performed at low temperature [19]. Also, its deposition could be applied straight on the photoanode electrode, such as the presently used FTO glass. Thus in the present work we have employed electrodeposition to construct metal-modified hematite photoanodes. Several works have demonstrated that hydrogen can be produced by the photoelectrocatalytic decomposition of ethanol, methanol and other oxygenates [26–30]. These substances are major biomass products offering a high hydrogen yield. Another category of substances promoting high photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production rate are water wastes containing sulfide and nitrogen-compounds [31–34]. However, the food industry produces a large amount of solid and liquid wastes such as glucose, sorbitol and other saccharides. The photodegradation of this type of compounds could also lead to interesting hydrogen yield [35–37]. Aqueous solutions containing oxygenated organic compounds (OOC) could be photocatalytically reformed to yield hydrogen according to the following general formula [38]: (1) CnHmOk +(2n−k)H2O→nCO2 +(2n+m/2−k)H2 Obviously, reforming involves hydrogen production by a combination of OOC oxidation and water splitting [38]. In the present work, we have thus studied hydrogen production by choosing to involve a few characteristic of the above OOC. It must be also underlined at this point that most of the works studying photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production limit themselves to the characterization of the cells by recording only the current produced [33–37]. In the present work, we have gone beyond this point and we have actually monitored hydrogen production by using a specially designed for the present purpose reduction electrocatalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All the used reagents were obtained from Aldrich. Millipore water (18.2MΩ·cm at room temperature) was used in all experiments. SnO2:F transparent conductive electrodes (FTO, Resistance 8Ω/square) were purchased from Pilkington, USA, carbon paste Elcocarb C/SP from Solaronix, Switzerland and silica frit from ROBU, Germany."
3,Preparation of Fe2O3 films on FTO,"2.2 Preparation of Fe2O3 films on FTO Hematite (Fe2O3) films were deposited on FTO transparent electrodes by the electrochemical deposition procedure. The FTO glass was cut in proper dimensions and carefully cleaned with soap and then sonicated using isopropanol, water and acetone. The FTO glass was immersed into the electrodeposition solution containing 5mM FeCl3, 5mM KF, 0,1M KCl and 1M H2O2. The volume of the solution was 100ml. The deposition of the hematite film was performed by cyclic voltammetry and by applying 50 potential cycles between −0.4 to 0.5V vs Ag/AgCl with scan rate of 100mVs−1 at 50°C. A 2.5cm2 Pt foil was used as counter electrode. The distance between the anode and the cathode was approximately 1cm. After deposition, the hematite-modified FTO electrode was rinsed with millipore water. Finally, the film was calcined up to 750°C for 10min in air atmosphere at a rate of 20°C/min. Two types of films were prepared. Films, which were used for current-voltage measurements had a convenient geometrical area of 1cm2 (1cm x 1cm). Those which were used for hydrogen production were much larger and had an area of 17.5cm2 (5cm x 3.5cm). The metal-modified photoanodes were prepared with the same method by adding in the electrodeposition solution appropriate amounts of the corresponding salts: CoCl x 6H2O, TiCl4, CuCl2 × 2H2O, SnCl4 or NiCl2. The atomic ratio of each metal with respect to Fe was in the range 0.5-10%. The samples are named xMe-Fe2O3, where x is the (nominal) atomic ratio of the modifier (%) and Me is the metal. All samples are then characterized by the above nominal metal content, even though, the actual metal concentration in the obtained films may be different, as usually happens by electrodeposition."
4,Deposition of the electrocatalyst,"2.3 Deposition of the electrocatalyst The counter electrode was fabricated by using a commercial carbon paste (ElcocarbC/SP, Solaronix) that was applied on the FTO glass by doctor blading procedure followed by a thermal treatment at 450°C for 30min. Pt was then deposited on the top using a solution of diamminedinitritoplatinum(II) in ethanol and casted on warm film lying on a hot plate at 40°C. The film was subsequently annealed again at 450°C. The final quantity of Pt on the film was calculated to be 0.1mg/cm2. The geometrical area of the film was 17.5cm2 (5cm x 3.5cm). The photocatalyst and electrocatalyst were deposited on separate FTO electrodes and connected by an external circuit. In that case, hydrogen production rate could be enhanced by applying an external electrical bias."
5,Materials characterization,"2.4 Materials characterization All the materials were widely characterized using various techniques. Raman spectra were obtained with a Dispersive MicroRaman system (Invia, Renishaw), equipped with 785nm diode-laser. The crystalline phase composition of the samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns were obtained using Assing diffractometer with Ni filter and graphite monochromator using Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range 20–70. Light absorption properties of the samples were studied by UV–vis reflectance spectra, recorded by a Perkin Elmer spectrometer Lambda 35 using a RSA-PE-20 reflectance spectroscopy accessory (Labsphere Inc., North Sutton, NH). Equivalent band gap determinations of the photoanode were obtained by the Kubelka–Munk Function (KM) F(R∞) by plotting [KM x hν]2 vs. hν [39–43]. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber with a SPECS LHS-10 hemispherical electron analyzer. Unmonochromatized AlKα line at 1486.6eV and analyzer pass energy of 36eV, giving a FWHM of 0.9eV for the Ag3d5/2 peak, was used. The analyzed area was 2.5-4.5mm2. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements were made with a Zeiss SUPRA 35 VP."
6,Photoelectrochemical tests,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical tests Current-voltage measurements were performed by employing an Autolab PGSTAT128N potentiostat and a reactor made of Plexiglas, in a three-electrode configuration. The active area of the photoanode in that case was 1cm2 (1cm×1cm), for reasons of simplicity. Ag/AgCl and a Pt foil were used as a reference and counter electrode, respectively, while the aqueous electrolyte contained 1M NaOH (pH∼13.5) and the organic agent, when necessary. Illumination was made with a Xenon lamp, set at approximately 100mW/cm2."
7,Photoelectrocatalytic H2 production,"2.6 Photoelectrocatalytic H2 production In the case of hydrogen production, a large pyrex H-shaped reactor was used, which could accommodate a larger photoanode and counter electrode (3.5cm×5cm active area) (Fig. 1 ). The counter (cathode) electrode was based on an FTO glass carrying a combination of carbon paste with Pt [44]. Its construction is detailed in subsection 2.3. The electrolyte was again 1M aqueous NaOH without or with the organic additive. In that case, the organic agent was added only in the anode compartment. In particular, we tested glucose, sorbitol, glycerol and ethanol in a concentration equal to 1g/L. The volume of the electrolyte was 250ml in each compartment of the cell. The two compartments were separated by a silica frit (porosity SGQ 5, diameter 25mm, thickness 2mm). The reactor was equipped with fittings allowing Ar gas to flow through the electrolyte. Before photoelectrocatalytic tests, a vigorous flow of Ar for 20min was used to deoxygenate the electrolyte. The Ar flow continued at a controlled rate of 20Nccmin−1 during the tests. Hydrogen was analyzed on line by using Ar as carrier inert gas and by applying a bias measured vs Ag/AgCl. Illumination was made in all cases by using a Xe lamp providing an intensity of approximately 100mW/cm2 at the position of the photoanode. Hydrogen was detected on line with an SRI 8610C gas chromatograph by using Ar (as carrier inert gas) and by applying a bias measured vs Ag/AgCl. Calibration of the chromatograph signal was carried out with a standard of 0.25% H2 in Ar. An Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT128N allowed the application of electric bias and the tracing of current-voltage curves."

10,Results and discussion,
11,Photocurrent measurements,"3.1 Photocurrent measurements Photocurrent measurement data were used in the present work as a principal tool to judge which metal modifier was worth of further study for hydrogen production purposes. Since the rate of hydrogen production is proportional to the current flowing in the photoelectrochemical cell, we thus searched for metal modifiers that resulted in current increase. Fig. 2 shows the J-V plots (photocurrent density vs applied potential) for pristine hematite and for Ti or Ni-modified hematite thin films. In dark conditions, the J–V responses for all samples were similar and showed no evidence of PEC activity. The pristine hematite thin film gave a photocurrent density equal to 0.34mA/cm2 at 0.5V vs Ag/AgCl. This value is one of the highest photocurrents reported for bare hematite prepared by electrodeposition method [45]. The currents obtained for various amounts of modifiers are shown in Fig. 2a and b as well as in Figs. S1-S3. In all cases the presence of the metal modifier resulted in modifying the J-V response, however, only Ti (Fig. 2a) and Ni (Fig. 2b) resulted in substantial increase of current density. The other modifiers studied in this work, i.e. Co, Cu and Sn, decreased instead of increasing current. In general, the results were in agreement with those which have already appeared in literature [46]. However, there are also previous reports [47–49], which indicate that addition of Sn modifiers increase photocurrent. It is interesting that in those cases, deposition was made by the hydrothermal route. This is a direct indication that the synthesis and film deposition method plays a crucial role in the effect of doping. This should be also associated with the final uptake of the modifier as will be explained below. Metal modifiers (Mn+) of hematite may act in several ways: first, metal may act as an electron donor due to the substitution of Fe3+ by Mn+ in hematite lattice. Increased donor concentration improves the conductivity of the photoactive film and decreases carrier recombination; second, increased donor concentration would increase the electric field across the space charge layer resulting in higher charge separation efficiency [46]. However, adverse effects may take place at high modifier concentration [46]. Thus there exists an optimal modifier concentration [46] which in the present case was 1% for Ni and 3% for Ti. All atomic ratios are nominal and they correspond to the original concentration in the electrodeposition solution. The highest recorded current was the one produced by a photoanode bearing a 3%Ti-Fe2O3 and it was 1.54mA/cm2 for a bias potential equal to 0.5V vs Ag/AgCl (i.e. 3 times that of pristine hematite) while the corresponding value for Ni was 0.67mA/cm2. Having thus trimmed the best modifiers among five studied, the rest of the data were limited to the study of only Ti or Ni-modified hematite photoanodes."
12,Characterization,"3.2 Characterization The morphology of pristine Fe2O3 and 1%Ni-Fe2O3 films electrochemically grown on FTO electrodes is shown in Fig. 3 . The image shows a mesostructure composed of nanoparticles (with a size ranging from 40 to 400nm) with substantial size polydispersity [44]. Each large nanoparticle seems to derive from aggregation of smaller entities. Similar results have been obtained with 3%Ti-Fe2O3 film whose thickness, evaluated by SEM profile, was approximately 300nm [44]. The corresponding diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 4 . The same figure also shows XRD patterns obtained with Ti and Ni-modified hematite. It is obvious that all patterns only involve peaks deriving from the FTO substrate [50] and those from pure hematite [51]. The presence of the metal modifiers did not affect hematite crystallinity, at least to the point where such modifications may be detectable. Calculation of crystallite sizes was performed by using the Scherrer’s formula (Eq. 2) at the (101) diffraction plane of hematite phase. (2) d − = 0.9 ⋅ λ β ⋅ cos θ where: d − =average crystallites size [Å]. λ= x-ray wavelength=1.54060Å; β=the full width at half maximum intensity of the peak at the (101) diffraction plane of hematite phase [degree]. θ= diffraction angle [degree]. The sizes (Table 1 ) ranged between 20 and 26nm but this variation is considered to be within experimental error. These relatively small sizes verified that the nanoparticles of Fig. 3 are in fact the result of aggregation of smaller entities, as already said. The intensity of the main peak of the hematite phase (at 55.66°) is directly correlated with the thickness of the electrodeposited film [52]. Therefore the ratio between the intensity of FTO main peak (at 27.66°) and that one of hematite phase (at 55.66°) could be used to estimate the thickness of the films through the following relationship: (3) T = T T i ⋅ R R T i where: T =thickness of the pristine Fe2O3 and 1%Ni-Fe2O3 electrodeposited film [nm]; R =ratio between the intensity of FTO main peak (at 27.66°) and that one of hematite phase (at 55.66°) for pristine Fe2O3 and 1%Ni-Fe2O3 [−]; TTi =thickness of the 3%Ti-Fe2O3 electrodeposited film=300nm [44]; RTi =ratio between the intensity of FTO main peak (at 27.66°) and that one of hematite phase (at 55.66°) for 3%Ni-Fe2O3 [−]. The value of R (from XRD) was 0.10 for 1%Ni-Fe2O3 while it was equal to 0.072 and 0.078 for pristine Fe2O3 and 3%Ti-Fe2O3, respectively. These values were inserted in Eq. (3) and allowed to obtain the thickness of the pristine Fe2O3 and 1%Ni-Fe2O3 electrodeposited film, being equal to 277 and 385nm, respectively. These results indicate that the thickness of the film for the 3%Ti-Fe2O3 sample (300nm) was lower than that of the 1%Ni-Fe2O3 sample (385nm). For a material which suffers of low charge carrier mobility, as hematite, thicker film may result in increased electron-hole recombination. Thus the thicker Ni-modified photoanode may partly justify the lower current production in that case. Raman spectroscopy was also used to examine crystalline phases, as shown in Fig. 5 . For all three samples, the optical modes of hematite were clearly observed (at 225, 244, 292, 409, 496 and 611cm−1). However, no titanium oxide (expected at 145, 399, 516 and 640cm−1) [53] or nickel oxide (expected at 460 and 500cm−1) [54] has been detected indicating as above that the quantity of the modifier and the electrodeposition method employed for hematite modification did not produce any separate metal oxide phases. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis absorption spectra reported in Fig. 6 a show absorption bands of α-Fe2O3 at 450nm and 550nm. The shoulder around 550nm is attributed to indirect transitions while the band around 450nm is attributed to direct charge transfer [55]. It is noted that in the case of Ti-modified hematite, direct charge transfer is enhanced while for Ni-modified hematite, the band at 550nm, responsible of the indirect charge transfer, prevails. In the case of direct charge transfer, the photo-generated holes are directly extracted from the valence band and the photocurrent follows the voltage variations of the hole density at the surface [56]. For the indirect charge transfer, the photogenerated holes are trapped in surface states and they may subsequently recombine with trapped electrons. As it is also seen in Fig. 6b, the band gap of Fe2O3, 3%Ti- Fe2O3 and 1%Ni-Fe2O3 was equal to 2.2, 2.1 and 2eV, respectively. Despite the fact that the value of the band gap in the case of 1%Ni-Fe2O3 is the lowest (2eV), the sample which showed the best photoelectrochemical response was hematite doped with titanium. This result can be justified by considering the optical properties of the samples in terms of direct and indirect charge transfer. It is interesting that the J-V curves corresponding to 3%Ti- Fe2O3 and 1%Ni-Fe2O3 vary in a very different manner with applied voltage, as can be seen in the diagram of Fig. 2 c. This is apparently associated with the difference in the prevailing direct or indirect charge transfer [56]. This differing behavior, at least partly, justifies the difference in the obtained currents. XPS was also used to examine the actual atomic ratio of each component of the films, which may be different from that of the nominal percentage [44]. We have studied three metal modifiers, Ni, Co and Ti. Interestingly no dopant was detected in the case of Ni and Co, apparently because the uptake was too small to be detected. On the contrary, as seen in Table 2 (see also spectra presenting as supporting information), Ti uptake was much larger than the nominal percentage, similarly to previous observations [44]. Higher Ti uptake by electrodeposition may constitute one additional reason for higher hematite modification. As a conclusion of this subsection by summarizing the above data, we might say that the superiority of the Ti-modified hematite may be the result of thinner film formation, enhanced direct charge transfer and strong metal uptake."
13,Photoelectrocatalytic H2 production,"3.3 Photoelectrocatalytic H2 production The above data highlight Ti-modified hematite (3%Ti-Fe2O3) as the best material for the construction of efficient photoanodes for photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production. In the present subsection we present such data by testing the applicability of various oxygenated organic compounds. As already said, for this purpose we employed the H-shaped reactor schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The organic additives were dissolved in the electrolyte of the anode compartment. Fig. 7 presents hydrogen production rate in the presence of various organic additives. The rising part of each curve corresponds to the accumulation of hydrogen in the tubes of the detection line. The constant rate thereafter indicates that the quantity of the organic stuff was large enough so it was not exhausted during measurement. In addition, it demonstrates the stability of the system and of its components. The data of Fig. 7 highlight the superiority of glycose vs the other three additives, i.e. glycerol, sorbitol and ethanol as a hydrogen producing agent. Indeed the highest rate was obtained in the presence of glycose (1.43μmol/min). Sugars have repeatedly been used as sacrificial agents for hydrogen production by photocatalysis or photoelectrocatalysis [35,57,58]. The feasibility of hydrogen evolution from carbohydrates, such as glucose, under light irradiation was demonstrated in a pioneering work by Kawai and Sakata [59] in which it was reported that the presence of several hydroxy groups in sugars enables their easy activation on semiconductor surface. Alcohols are also considered as very efficient agents for the evolution of hydrogen by stepwise oxidation through various intermediates, including aldehydes and carboxylates [60]. Kondarides et al. [61] have studied photoreforming of glycerol (and other biomass-derived compounds including saccharides and organic acids) to H2 and CO2 over Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts under non aerated conditions and with UV irradiation. In this case, the hydrogen production rate increased by an order of magnitude in the presence of glycerol than that obtained in pure water. In the present case, ethanol gave the lowest hydrogen production rate but we believe that this is the result of the relatively low ethanol concentration (1g/L) [62,63]. The obtained photoelectrochemical results confirm the valorization of sugars present in wastewater as a very interesting sacrificial agent and it is a valid alternative to the conventional water splitting reaction for H2 production. Fig. 2 shows that the applied external bias (voltage) affects current. Since hydrogen production depends on the current flowing between photoanode and counter electrode, it is expected that hydrogen production rate should increase at higher applied bias. This was indeed observed, as seen in Fig. 8 , by increasing external bias from 0.5V to 0.7V vs Ag/AgCl. In particular, after 13h of irradiation, the hydrogen production rate in the presence of glycerol was 1.43μmol/min under 0.5V but became 2.3μmol/min under 0.7V vs Ag/AgCl. Since glucose showed the best results, this substance was chosen to compare the H2 production obtained by using 3%Ti-Fe2O3, 1%Ni-Fe2O3 and unmodified Fe2O3 with an external bias of 0.5V. The obtained results are reported in Fig. 9 . Under steady state conditions, both metal modified Fe2O3 films showed an enhanced performance compared with unmodified Fe2O3. It must be noted that 3%Ti-Fe2O3 allowed to reach a H2 production higher than 1%Ni-Fe2O3. 3%Ti-Fe2O3 superiority is in accordance with photocurrent produced in each case, as seen in Fig. 2c."
14,Conclusions,"This study has shown that the photoelectrocatalytic process applied to solutions containing organic substances represents a valid alternative to the conventional water splitting reaction for H2 production. In particular, the obtained results confirm the valorization of sugars or of other organic substances (such as glycerol) present in wastewater as potential renewable hydrogen resources. Hematite (Fe2O3) film deposited on transparent FTO was used as photoanode. The Fe2O3 photoanodes were prepared by the electrodeposition method. The efficiency of various metal modifiers (Ti, Ni, Sn, Co and Cu) has been tested by monitoring the photoelectrochemical behavior of the modified Fe2O3 photoanodes. The experimental results showed that the highest photocurrent production has been achieved with the Ti-modified Fe2O3 photoanode. The highest hydrogen production (1.43μmol/min at 0.5V and 2.30μmol/min at 0.7V vs Ag/AgCl) was obtained on a Ti-modified hematite photoanode in the presence of alkaline aqueous electrolyte solution containing 1g/L glucose as sacrificial agent."
