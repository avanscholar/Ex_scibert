0,Introduction,"Increasing energy demand and extensive utilization of fossil sources are considered to be among the reasons of a global increase of energy-related CO2 emissions [1]. Therefore, introduction of renewable, low-carbon sources nowadays is progressing fast [2,3]. One of the forward-looking concepts towards sustainability is to utilize solar energy, a renewable, abundant, cheap and carbon-free source of energy, as to drive catalytic process [4,5]. In particular, the field of heterogeneous photo-catalysis have advanced in the last decades from decomposition of pollutants and water splitting to a more complex reactions such as selective organic synthesis [6–10], and CO2 reduction [11,12]. Recent publications in the field of heterogeneous photo-catalysis have demonstrated the feasibility of converting oxygenated organic substrates into hydrogen by means of photo-reforming process using semiconducting materials, staring from model compounds [13–17], to a more complex systems such as plastics [18,19], lignin [20,21], and biomass-derived crude glycerol [22,23]. Recently, thermo-, electro- and photo-catalytic valorization of glycerol, by-product of biodiesel production, has been considered as sustainable way to obtain various high valuable chemicals [24,25], and hydrogen as energy carrier [26,27], due to the fast-growing global market of biodiesel and, thus, low price of crude glycerol [28]. In particular, photo-reforming of glycerol have received a substantial attention by many authors in the last decade due to high rates of H2 production compared to the majority of studied mono- and polyols [29]. Among the catalysts reported for glycerol photo-reforming, TiO2-based materials have drawn the greatest interest, because they are cheap, non-toxic, abundant and non-critical raw materials [30], having a good thermal and photo-stability. Most of the studied photo-catalysts consist of a noble metal co-catalyst which serves as cathode or electron trap, thus, responsible for H2 evolution. On the opposite, the surface of semiconductor is considered as anodic site, where the photo-generated hole participates in oxidation of substrate [13,31,32]. Interestingly, the majority of these studies report monitoring the rates of hydrogen production, thus focusing only on the reduction reaction. The mechanism of oxidation side is seldom discussed in detail. This work presents the results on photocatalytic reforming of glycerol in aqueous media using TiO2 semiconductor supported Pt nanoparticles. Two commercially available and two lab-synthesized titania having different phase compositions were used. As far as synthesis of titania concerns, the microemulsion-mediated method was used. This method have a number of advantages compared to traditional ones: it improves the size distribution and allows controlling the size and morphology of nanoparticles [33–35]. Moreover, microemulsion technique allows to easily tune TiO2 composition by varying the synthesis conditions, as it will be demonstrated in this work. Recently, it has been demonstrated that TiO2 prepared by microemulsion method outperformed the differently synthesized titania in the reaction of glycerol photo-reforming, carried out in similar conditions, thanks to a greater specific surface area, giving access to the increased densities of active sites. [36] Besides, this method provides an improved control over mixed oxide and bimetallic system composition, where the initial ratio of the precursor concentrations in the micelles will correspond to the final composition of the particles obtained after post-treatment [37–39]. As the crystalline size, specific surface area and polymorph composition of the support are among the parameters that can substantially influence photocatalytic performance [40–44], the microemulsion technique was selected to obtain anatase and rutile phases to be compared with commercial supports. The effect of different phases of titania and metal co-catalyst on hydrogen production and selectivity of intermediate products in glycerol photo-reforming are assessed taking into account the method of co-catalyst and TiO2 preparation."
1,Experimental part,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials P25 (TiO2 P25 Degussa), DT-51 (TiO2 DT-51 Millennium CrystalACTIV) were used as commercially available references as received; Titanium(IV) butoxide (97 %, Sigma Aldrich), Triton X-100 (Alfa Aesar), 1-hexanol (99 %, Alfa Aesar), Cyclohexane (99 %, Alfa Aesar), Ethanol (99.8 %, Sigma Aldrich), HNO3 (65 %, Sigma Aldrich) were used for the synthesis of titania by reverse microemulsion method; [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 (99.99 %, Alfa Aesar, Premion®), H2PtCl6·xH2O (Sigma Aldrich) were used for the Pt nanoparticles preparation; glycerol (99.5 % Alfa Aesar), glyceraldehyde (90 %, Sigma-Aldrich), glycolaldehyde dimer (Sigma-Aldrich), dihydroxyacetone dimer (97 %, Sigma-Aldrich) were used for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) calibration and as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) standards, all without further purification."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation TiO2 nano-oxides were prepared by reverse microemulsion method following the procedure reported elsewhere [45], modifying the thermal treatment. In brief, the oil phase composed by cyclohexane (dispersant), Triton X-100 (surfactant), and n-hexanol (co-surfactant), was mixed with 5 M aqueous solution of HNO3, forming a microemulsion system. Another oil phase was prepared adding titania precursor, titanium (IV) butoxide. This solution was added to previously prepared microemulsion under vigorous stirring. The resulting reverse microemulsion system was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and then heated up to 74 °C under reflux and kept at this temperature for 5 h under vigorous stirring. The resulting solid was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol 5 times. The obtained paste was dried overnight at 100 °C and calcined at 400 °C for 3 h with the ramp of 2 °C/min. The resulting solid powder of titania in the form of anatase was denominated as TiO2-m_A. Titanium dioxide with rutile phase was obtained, following the same procedure, except the stirring was kept for 4 days at room temperature, without further heat-treatment. The obtained precipitate was then separated, washed, dried and calcined as mentioned above. The resulting powder was denominated as TiO2-m_R. Platinum metal nanoparticles were deposited by incipient wetness impregnation and deposition-precipitation (DP) of platinum precursor following the reduction step in hydrogen flow. For the impregnation procedure, the solution of H2PtCl6·x H2O was loaded on powders, containing the same pore volume as the volume of the added precursor solution, following cycles of loading and drying in oven at 100 °C. Finally, the powder was dried at 120 °C overnight, calcined at 350 °C for 3 h (ramp 10 °C/min) in static air and sieved with 60–80 mesh. The Pt NPs were obtained by reduction in H2/N2 flow (100 cm3/min, 10 %) at 350 °C for 3 h (ramp 10 °C/min) in static air. The DP synthesis was performed as follow: a 0.001 M solution of [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 was used at pH 8, adjusted by adding dropwise a 0.1 M NaOH solution. Then, the resulting solution was added dropwise to the titanium dioxide suspension under vigorous stirring at room temperature with a dropwise addition of 0.1 M NaOH to maintain pH 8. Once the entire platinum solution was transferred, temperature was increased to 65 °C, and the obtained suspension was stirred for 2 h. The solid was then separated by centrifugation, washed several times with water, dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 350 °C for 3 h with a rate of 10 °C/min in static air and sieved with 60–80 mesh. The Pt NPs were obtained by reduction with H2/He flow (100 cm3/min, 5 %) at 350 °C for 3 h (ramp 10 °C/min). According to the type of synthesis, resulting catalysts were denoted as Pt/TiO2-m_A, Pt/TiO2-m_A_DP; Pt/TiO2-m_R, Pt/TiO2-m_R_DP; Pt/P25, Pt/P25_DP; Pt/DT-51, Pt/DT-51_DP. All the platinum-containing solids were loaded on titania in 1.5 wt.% of Pt. Table 1 reports all prepared samples."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The prepared materials were characterized in terms of their specific surface area, phase composition and light absorption properties, using nitrogen physisorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy (DRS). Catalyst surface area was measured by a N2 physisorption apparatus (Sorpty 1750 CE instruments) and single-point BET analysis methods, in which samples were pre-treated under a vacuum at 125 °C. Powder X-ray diffraction analyses of all the samples were carried out at room temperature with a Bragg/Brentano diffractometer (X'pertPro PANalytical) equipped with a fast X’Celerator detector, using a Cu anode as the X-ray source (Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å). Diffractograms were recorded in the range of 10−80°2θ with a step of 0.05°2θ. Particle size determination was done by Scherrer equation over the 100 % peak. The rutile-to-anatase ratio for all the samples was determined according to the method described by Ding et al. [46]. Raman spectra were recorded at ambient temperature with 514 nm Ar+ laser excitation by Renshaw RM1000 spectrometer equipped with Leica DMLM microscope and CCD camera. Power output was 6.25 mW and grating 1200 lines/mm. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy analyses were carried out in a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 instrument equipped with integrating sphere in the range 280−800 nm. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia and carbon dioxide analyses were carried out on a Micromeritics Autochem II instrument equipped with TCD detector. In temperature programmed NH3 desorption analysis, the sample was first pre-treated at 400 °C for 45 min (ramp 10 °C/min) in He atmosphere (30 cm3/min). The sample was flushed for 1 h at 100 °C with a mixture of 10 % NH3 in He (30 cm3/min), then it was purged for 1 h with helium at the same temperature. Finally, desorption measurements were carried out up to 700 °C with a ramp of 10 °C/min with isotherm of 30 min. In temperature programmed CO2 desorption analysis, the sample was first pre-treated at 500 °C for 2 h (ramp 10 °C/min) in He atmosphere (30 cm3/min). Saturation of the sample with carbon dioxide (10 % in He) was carried out at 60 °C for 1 h (30 cm3/min). Desorption measurements were performed in He for 30 min up to 900 °C (ramp 10 °C/min) for 20 min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of platinum containing samples were done at IMM_CNR, Bologna, Italy. The analyses were carried out using TEM/STEM FEI TECNAI F20 instrument, equipped with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector at 200 keV. The corresponding samples were suspended in ethanol and treated in ultrasonic bath for 15 min. The suspension was deposited on a “quantifoil carbon film” Cu grid for TEM analysis, then dried at 100 °C."
5,Photocatalytic test and analytical methods,"2.4 Photocatalytic test and analytical methods The photo-reforming of glycerol has been carried out in a sealed top-irradiated glass photo-reactor (Scheme S1). Prior the reaction, 7 % by volume (1 M), aqueous solution of glycerol with 0.5 g/L of catalyst were stirred for 20 min in the dark, while purging continuously N2. The amount of catalyst was optimized following H. Kisch [47] and presented in Fig. S1. The sealed reactor of 4.6 cm diameter was irradiated for 6 h using the solar simulator that consists of 300 W Xe-lamp (irradiance of 100 mW/cm2 was regularly measured prior each test by radiometer HD2102.2 DELTA OHM equipped with two probes of 315−400 nm and 400−1050 nm). Samples were collected at the end of the reaction. After reaction, the samples were qualitatively analyzed by Electrospray Ionization Mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques for identification of the products. Waters micromass ZQ 4000 instrument with quadrupole mass analyzer was used to perform ESI-MS analysis. The aqueous product solution was diluted in methanol and injected without further derivatization. Positive ions conditions were 3.53 kV for the probe and 10 V for the cone, while for negative ions the probe voltage was 2.54 kV and 40 V for the cone with a 0.02 cm3/min flux. 600 MHz 1H NMR analysis was performed using Varian Inova (600 MHz for 1 H) equipped with an indirect triple resonance probe. The data treatment was done using a presaturation sequence (PRESAT, with power = 4 dB and presaturation delay 2 s), while analyzing aqueous solutions (the residual H2O signal δ 4.79 ppm). After the reaction, the liquid phase was filtered, diluted 100 times (from 1 M to 0.01 M) or used without dilution (in case of 0.05 M), and analyzed in an Agilent HPLC over Rezex ROA Organic Acid column (0.0025 M H2SO4 eluent, oven temperature 30 °C and 0.6 cm3/min flux) with DAD and RID detectors. Aqueous solutions of commercial standards were used to calibrate the products by external method. Hydrogen was analyzed in off-line Agilent Technologies GC equipped with CP Molesieve 5A UM 25 m x0.53 mm x50 μm column and TCD detector. The calibration was done using constant volume (1 cm3) of gas-tight syringe with different molar fractions of H2/N2. The calibration was done injecting different volumes of the commercial mixture of gases with constant molar fraction. The study of the effect of the reaction time during 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 5 h proceeded with 0.05 M aqueous glycerol solution, keeping the amount of catalyst loading 0.5 g/L. In this set of experiments with the more diluted starting concentration, the conversion of glycerol (X%), yield (Y%) and selectivity (S%) of the products were calculated using the following equations: (1) X % = n g l y c e r o l i n , m o l - n g l y c e r o l f i n , m o l n g l y c e r o l i n , m o l × 100 % (2) S % = n ( p r o d u c t ) , m o l ∙ S F n g l y c e r o l i n , m o l - n g l y c e r o l f i n , m o l × 100 % While in the experiments with 7% by volume (1 M) aqueous solution of glycerol the selectivity of products was calculated as: (3) S % ' = n ( p r o d u c t ) , m o l ∙ S F ∑ n ( p r o d u c t ) , m o l ∙ S F × 100 % where SF is the stoichiometry factor, which is equal to 1 for glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, 2/3 for glycolaldehyde, and 1/4 for H2, n is moles of corresponding product."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. S2 shows the diffractograms of all the used TiO2 powders. The content of different crystal structures has been estimated for all the materials using the procedure reported by Ding et al. [46]. Commercial TiO2 P25 consists of 80 % anatase and 20 % rutile, which is consistent with other works [48]. From XRD data provided in Fig. S2 the crystallite size of anatase in P25 crystals was found 23 nm with respect to anatase (101) reflection. Another commercial TiO2 (DT-51) nanocrystals consist of 100 % anatase with particles diameter of 20 nm. XRD analysis of TiO2 anatase synthetised by microemulsion (TiO2-m_A) demonstrate that the main phase is represented by anatase (92 %) with a small amount of rutile (8 %). From XRD patterns, the crystallite size of TiO2-m_A calcined at 400 °C was determined to be 8 nm, which confirms that the microemulsion technique permitted to obtain small crystallites, indeed. Rutile, in turn, has been considered as the thermodynamically stable above 35 nm at all temperatures and atmospheric pressure [45]. Nevertheless, as one can see from the Fig. S2 and Table 1, microemulsion method allows synthesizing rutile with 11 nm crystallites (sample TiO2-m_R). It is worth noting that the microemulsion synthesis allowed to obtain both, anatase-rich and a pure rutile phase, by just changing the hydrolysis time, highlighting the versatility of this synthetic method. XRD patterns of Pt-containing materials prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation and deposition-precipitation methods with reduction in hydrogen are shown in Fig. S3. The XRD patterns of Pt-containing materials resemble the data obtained for pristine supports. Thus, the deposition of Pt NPs and treatment of Pt-decorated materials do not affect the crystalline size of TiO2 as well as the phase composition, keeping anatase as major phase with reflections (101), (004), (200), (105) and (211) at 25.33, 37.82, 48.08, 53.93 and 55.12 2°θ, respectively. The crystalline size was calculated by Scherrer formula using the anatase (101) reflection. The values of crystalline size of prepared materials are shown in Table 1. No Pt phase was detected due to the small amount and crystallite size of Pt in the sample. The phase composition was also confirmed by RAMAN spectroscopy. On Fig. S4 one can see a clear presence of anatase phase in P25, DT-51 and TiO2-m_A, showing the bands with the corresponding assignments at 143 cm−1 (Eg), 197 cm−1 (Eg), 397 cm−1 (B1g), 516 cm−1 (B1g), and 638 cm−1 (Eg). While the bands of rutile phase in TiO2-m_R could be observed at 143, 445 and 610 cm-1 with B1g, Eg and A1g symmetry species, respectively. The band at 210 cm−1 and a weak broad shoulder at approximately 707 cm−1 have been attributed to second-order or two-phonon RAMAN scattering [49–51]. Specific surface area was determined, and the results are shown in Table 1 for bare titania. The obtained results indicated that the procedure used for microemulsion-synthesized titania preparation permitted to obtain a photocatalyst with a higher surface area and smaller crystallite size with respect to the commercial powders. Table 1 shows that P25, TiO2-m_A, TiO2-m_R retain their surface areas even after Pt deposition. On contrast, the surface area of DT-51 notably decreased after deposition of Pt nanoparticles. It is known that anatase normally undergoes a drastic transition to rutile at temperatures starting from 500 °C, resulting in shrinking of surface area with the particle size decrease. In a recent study it has been shown that the anatase can retain its phase composition even at 500 °C, however a slight growth of particles was observed with a concurrent decrease in surface area [36]. Thus, the minor decrease in specific surface area of DT-51 after Pt deposition may be due to the specific porosity of this commercial sample, than can be partially blocked by the metal deposition. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy was used to evaluate absorbing capability of solids. Reflectance spectra on Fig. S5 indicate that absorption of TiO2-m-based powders and P25 is slightly enhanced in the visible region with respect to the commercial DT-51. This behavior could be mainly due to the presence of a small amount of rutile in the lab-synthesized titania and P25, as highlighted from the XRD patterns reported in Fig. S2. Indeed, the absorption edge for TiO2-m_R is notably shifted towards visible range compared to other photocatalysts. This is in agreement with literature, since it is known that energy bandgap of rutile is around 3.0 eV, while anatase is characterized by an energy bandgap of around 3.3 eV [52]. To note, however, the band gap can be red shifted by 0.25 eV for oxygen deficient TiO2 as was reported by T. Das and co-workers [53]. The results in Table S1 shows that the values of energy bandgap of the different types of titanium dioxide slightly differ depending the method used. [54] Nevertheless, all the samples absorb in the UV range of solar spectrum, and the bandgap calculated using Reflectance, KM or Tauc plot (Figs. S5–S7) are generally following the same trend, and it decreases in the order: DT-51 > P25 > TiO2-m_A > TiO2-m_R. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that all the three methods could be valid for determination and comparison of band gap of powdered materials. Regarding KM spectra of Pt-decorated samples, Fig. S8 shows a more pronounced increase of absorption intensity throughout visible and NIR region for Pt/TiO2-m_A_DP compared to pristine supports (Fig. S6), which could be ascribed to the presence of PtOx on the surface of semiconductor as was reported in the literature [16,55,56]. On the other hand, such increase was explained by a large absorption cross section of noble metal nanoparticles (Au, Pt, Ag) that generate intra- and interband transitions via 6sp and 5d band, producing hot electrons, which are then injected into conduction band of semiconductor occurring at the metal-semiconductor interface. As a result, noble metal nanoparticles facilitate absorption and transfer of visible part of solar energy to semiconductor [16,57,58]. From the obtained KM spectra, energy bandgap of the samples were determined and collected in Table 1. TEM micrographs and size distribution of Pt-decorated samples are shown in Fig. S9. Between two methods, in case of anatase-rich samples, the deposition-precipitation gives access to smaller and homogenously distributed Pt NPs than classical impregnation, although for both methods big platinum clusters (> 2 nm) could be observed. Different situation can be observed for rutile-based samples. TEM images show that incipient wetness impregnation resulted in smaller platinum clusters than deposition-precipitation with narrower distribution, although clusters of 10 nm were observed in TEM micrographs (Fig. S10, A). On the other hand, for Pt/TiO2-m_DP sample, large aggregates of 35 nm can be observed (Fig. S10, B). The average particle size of Pt is shown in Table 1."
8,Photocatalytic tests,"3.2 Photocatalytic tests Photocatalytic glycerol reforming tests were carried out on both bare supports and Pt-TiO2 catalysts using simulated solar light with the aim to maximize the H2 productivity compared to literature reports and to study the effect of different titania on liquid phase products, among which, glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxyacetone are normally the primary products of this reaction [32,59,60]. In Fig. 1 , the tests with only bare supports have revealed a better rate of hydrogen evolution for the material with the greatest fraction of rutile, TiO2-m_R. The activity trend did not change if normalized to unit area of the semiconductor (Fig. S11), emphasizing that specific surface area is not the main intrinsic property of the catalyst affecting hydrogen production rates. Elevated rates of hydrogen production from glucose photo-reforming on rutile-based photo-catalysts were also reported by the groups of M. Bellardita [61] and R. Chong [62]. Nevertheless, in the work of W. Chen and co-workers [44] P25 demonstrated superior activity followed by pure anatase ≈ brookite and finally, rutile, towards H2 in different alcohol-water mixtures due to the anatase-rutile heterojunction, which decreases the rate of electron-hole recombination. However, the morphological and surface area differences between powdered photocatalysts must be taken into account for complete comparison, as well as differences in light distribution for suspended powders, i.e. scattering and absorption. Many theoretical and experimental works conducting the study of scattering and absorption coefficients with the aim to solve radiative transport equation have been reported up to date [63–65]. Nevertheless, it is beyond the focus of this work. Introduction of a metal nanoparticle such as Pt on the surface of TiO2 significantly enhances the rate of hydrogen production for all the types of TiO2 as could be seen from Fig. 2 . This enhancement has been previously explained by experiments based on photoluminescence spectroscopy and was associated to the migration of photo-excited electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 onto the supported metal nanoparticles, and therefore, the decrease of rate in electron-hole recombination phenomena [14,44,66]. The use of Pt nanoparticles permitted formation of detectable amount of liquid phase products such as glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde, which were the main compounds observed in these conditions. Glycolaldehyde is a well-known high-value compound used as an intermediate for the preparation of other valuable products [67–69]. For instance, it could be applied as a food browning agent. It is also used as an intermediate for ethylene glycol or ethanolamine synthesis, cross-linking agent for amino-containing materials. No activity was observed, when the reactions were undergone in the dark or when only the visible light (>420 nm) was used. Except hydrogen and CO2, among the gas phase products some traces of CO and CH4 were detected, indicating that the reduction processes may occur, although the electrons do not participate directly in reduction products generation. Comparing the two methods of Pt NPs preparation, one can see that the catalysts synthesized by deposition-precipitation exhibit higher rates of hydrogen production, but also higher rates of liquid phase products compared to the impregnation method thanks to the well-dispersed small Pt NPs with a high surface area as could be seen in TEM images (Fig. S9). The advantage of deposition-precipitation synthesis yielding small metal nanoparticles with narrow particle size distribution, regardless the metal loading, was also pointed out in the literature [70,71]. The exception in this correlation is Pt/TiO2-m_R with smaller Pt NPs than Pt/TiO2-m_R_DP, which revealed greater rates of hydrogen production compared to Pt/TiO2-m_R_DP sample (Fig. 2), further confirming the positive effect of well-dispersed and small nanoparticles on photo-reforming process. Superior activity of smaller Pt NPs can have two-fold explanation. Firstly, smaller particles owing its high surface area could effectively participate as cathode, reducing H+ to H2. Secondly, the role of co-catalyst in photo-catalysis has been widely investigated [44,66,15,72], elucidating the reason of suppressed electron-hole recombination by the fact that Pt NPs create a rectifying Schottky contact on the surface of TiO2, thus trapping the electrons photo-excited into the conduction band of TiO2. Meanwhile the holes, remained in the valence band, efficiently participates in oxidation of organic substrates. Fig. 2 shows that the deposition of Pt NPs changed the activity of rutile-rich titania, TiO2-m_R. In the shown set of experiments, P25-based materials outperformed the other types of titania supports in hydrogen production. This can be explained by the presence of big aggregations of Pt NPs found for TiO2-m_R (Figs. S9, S10) that could decrease the dispersion of metal responsible for hydrogen evolution. Further comparison of the results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that P25, TiO2-m_A and TiO2-m_R based catalysts exhibit higher production rates of glycolaldehyde, while DT-51 based ones showed slightly greater productivity to glyceraldehyde than glycolaldehyde. This is in agreement with the calculated values of selectivity using these supports, shown in Table 2 . To elucidate whether the differences in mechanism of liquid phase products may originate from different surface acidity and basicity of the supports, the TPD analyses were carried out. The results of temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia analysis for all the titania supports are presented in Fig. 3 . The desorption curves are centered in the range of 150−650 °C showing for all the supports a presence of acid sites of different strength. Worth to note, both TiO2-m_A and TiO2-m_R have strong acid sites around 600 °C, according to classification given in literature [73]. Whereas only TiO2-m_A and P25 show the presence of a strong acid site above 650 °C. The sample TiO2-m_A is notably characterized by a greater amount of weak and medium acid sites compared to other samples. Such behavior can be explained by a larger surface area of this material [34]. In fact, surface-normalized TPD NH3 of the supports presented in Fig. 3B show comparable intensity of TCD signal. Nevertheless, calculated amount of desorbed NH3 showed greater value for lab-synthesized anatase, TiO2-m_A, both for mass- and surface area-normalized cases, followed by DT-51, TiO2-m_R and P25 samples (Table S2). The TPD CO2 curves for all the samples are presented in Fig. 4 . The TPD CO2 profiles in this case show a convolution of basic sites of different strength for all the supports. In this case a distinguished peak above 700 °C can be noticed for DT-51. This behavior could be explained by the decomposition of residues remained from the synthesis of TiO2 DT-51, namely sulfates and chlorides, also mentioned previously in the literature [74]. While TiO2-m_A and TiO2-m_R revealed similar basic sites around 600 °C. Surface-normalized TPD CO2 curves are presented in Fig. 4B, and does not show a substantial difference as compared to mass-normalized one. The obtained amount of desorbed CO2 is collected in Table S2. The results show that P25 is characterized by a greater amount of basic sites within the studied samples, followed by TiO2-m_R, TiO2-A and DT-51. Comparison of TPD NH3 and TPD CO2 did not show evident correlation with results observed on Fig. 2, suggesting that the photocatalytic reaction unlike the classical catalytic cycles [75,76], is less sensitive to the acidity of photoactive material. One of the explanations of observed behavior could arise from different mechanism undergone on the surface of different polymorphs of titania (rutile and anatase) upon light absorption. The decrease of glyceraldehyde selectivity and the increase of glycolaldehyde selectivity with the increase of rutile content display preliminary insights towards reaction mechanism for different types of titania. Taking into account experimental data and literature reported mechanisms over glycerol aqueous phase reforming [77,26], and photo-reforming [32,78,13,79], it is possible to suggest the scheme of glycerol photo-reforming under study, which is illustrated in Fig. 5 . In this research we have observed formation of glyceraldehyde in the step 1a as one of the primary products which take place via indirect mechanism described by K. Sanwald and co-worker [32]. In principle, the photo-generated holes are trapped by lattice oxygen sites in TiO2, abstracting the H-atom from C–H bond with subsequent formation of carbonyl group. One molecule of hydrogen is produced concurrently at a cathodic site. Further oxidation of glyceraldehyde can yield glycolaldehyde and formic acid as indicated in 2a. This was confirmed with reaction using Pt/DT-51_DP, which has only anatase polymorph. The dependency of selectivity of the products from glycerol conversion, presented in Fig. 6 , a, shows that the primary products of the reaction for DT-51 support are glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone in liquid phase. Then, glycolaldehyde appears as a secondary product with the consumption of both, glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone. However, in the test with microemulsion-synthesized anatase, Pt/TiO2-m_A_DP (Fig. 6, b), which has some fraction of rutile, glycolaldehyde can be already observed as a primary product formed directly from glycerol, suggesting the presence of a direct mechanism of CC cleavage, presumably following step 1b shown in Fig. 5. The effect of rutile can be further confirmed in the reaction with Pt/TiO2-m_R shown in Fig. 6, c. Analyzing reported in literature mechanism of glycolaldehyde formation on P25-based catalyst, one can suggest direct hole transfer to a chemisorbed glycerol on coordinatively unsaturated Ti(IV)-OH site to generate an alkoxide radical followed by β-C–C-scission [80]. Another suggestion of higher selectivity to glycolaldehyde was given by Chong and co-authors [59]. It is more likely that the peroxy species Ti-O-O-Ti, formed preferentially on rutile {110} in water media, which was confirmed by EPR and theoretical calculations, are the species responsible for high selectivity to glycolaldehyde. Similar behavior of selective CC cleavage was observed by the group of M. Bellardita and co-workers [61] on lab-synthesized rutile with and without Pt NPs during the glucose photo-reforming. Authors suggested the presence of peroxo species on rutile being beneficial for milder glucose oxidation than anatase that is known to produce in water highly reactive and surface mobile ·OH radicals leading to over-oxidation of organic molecules. The considerations reported in literature are confirmed in this study where the presence of rutile affects product distribution (Fig. 7 ). Glycolaldehyde selectivity increases as rutile content raises, with a concurrent decrease in glyceraldehyde selectivity, showing the importance of this phase in the production of the secondary product. Fig. 5 shows also a formation of another C3-species, dihydroxyacetone, following the step 1c, via two electron oxidation of secondary carbon atom of glycerol. On the other hand, the formation of dihydroxyacetone could be explained by the fact that in aqueous medium this trios is in fast isomerization equilibrium with glyceraldehyde [81–85], that in fact take place via an acid-catalyzed hydride shift, via a base-catalyzed mechanism with a proton shift (and intermediate enol), or via a concerted proton-coupled hydride shift in neutral media [86,87]. Another intermediate such as formic acid is shown in Fig. 5. Even though formic acid was not detected in liquid phase in this set of experiments, one can assume its formation and fast transformation to carbon dioxide. As a matter of fact, T. Montini and co-workers [79] have shown a complexity of glycerol photo-reforming on Cu/TiO2 under simulated solar light, meaning the production of multiple intermediates with different rates of formation. A rapid formation and consumption of intermediates often prevents their identification. This work shows the advantage of microemulsion synthesis in obtaining small crystallites with high specific surface area of anatase-rich and pure rutile TiO2. The prepared rutile allowed maximizing the rate of hydrogen production from glycerol photo-reforming process compared to commercial benchmark, P25. Moreover, platinized rutile was found to be more active in production of glycolaldehyde via direct CC cleavage of glycerol."
9,Conclusion,"Glycerol photo-reforming toward hydrogen and valuable chemicals production was studied using different polymorphs of titanium dioxide. Within the supports used, lab-synthesized rutile TiO2-m_R prepared from reverse microemulsion system, demonstrated greater rates of hydrogen production compared to lab-synthesized anatase TiO2-m_A, and commercially available samples, P25 and DT-51. This activity was changed when Pt metal nanoparticles were deposited on titania, resulting in greater photo-catalytic hydrogen production for P25 support. Among the metal-decorated catalysts tested, Pt nanoparticles prepared by deposition-precipitation showed the most promising results towards hydrogen production, because of the small and homogeneously distributed nanoparticles compared to classical impregnation method. However, rutile-containing samples showed an opposite tendency. The phase composition was found to be affecting the selectivity of liquid phase products. Rutile was more selective to direct CC cleavage of glycerol to form glycolaldehyde, while anatase was more selective towards glyceraldehyde than to glycolaldehyde. This study opens a possibility to produce chemicals and fuels by photo- or electro-photo-catalytic process, which can be an alternative and efficient way to upgrade biomass feedstock, following current advances in sustainable development."
