0,Introduction,"Acylated amino-alcohols such as ceramides, glucamides and amino-acid derivatives have found important applications, such as in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, as potential anti-viral or anti-tumour drugs [1–3], anti-oxidant stabilizers [4] and as active ingredients in hair and skin care products [5]. In addition, these compounds can also be used as surfactants in environmental, food and agricultural industries [6–8]. Many processes of chemical acylation of amino-alcohols have been developed so far but these methods have faced several limitations. One of the most serious restrictions during chemical processes is the necessity for fastidious steps of alcohol or amino group protection and deprotection, which are essential to control the chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity of acylation reactions [9,10]. Biocatalysis is considered as an interesting alternative for the preparation of synthetic compounds: it offers a clean way to perform chemical processes under mild reaction conditions, with a high degree of selectivity [11,12]. Lipases (E.C. 3.1.1.3) in particular provide several advantages when used in anhydrous organic media [13–15]. These include shifting of the thermodynamic equilibrium in favour of synthesis over hydrolysis reaction, increasing the solubility of non-polar substrates, eliminating side reactions, making enzyme recovery easier and increasing enzyme thermostability [16–18]. Lipases are excellent biocatalysts in O-acylation, transesterification and N-acylation reactions in the synthesis of various acylated derivates used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries [19–22]. They have, therefore, been widely studied over the past two decades and a large amount of their key properties in biocatalysis have been highlighted [15,23–25]. Recently, a new proton shuttle reaction mechanism was proposed to explain chemoselectivity for lipase-catalyzed N-acylation of amino-alcohols [26]. However, it is still necessary to optimize the output of lipase-catalyzed reactions and to understand this type of selectivity in different reaction conditions. The properties of lipases (activity, chemoselectivity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity) can be modulated by many parameters such as genetic or chemical modification, enzyme immobilization [15,27–29]. Solvent nature also particularly influences lipase-catalyzed acylation reactions. Recent studies have shown that the solvent affects the activity and selectivity of enzymes in a complex way, involving many interactions between the solvent and both the substrate and the enzyme [30–35]. Furthermore, the use of lipases in organic solvents makes many synthetic reactions possible that do not occur in the natural media of these enzymes. However, these solvents can display certain disadvantages, such as volatility and/or toxicity towards the environment [36], particularly when they are used on a large scale. An alternative to these organic solvents is the use of ionic liquids. Ionic liquids have recently emerged to replace organic solvents in biocatalytic transformations, especially in the case of polar substrates like amino-alcohols that are difficult to dissolve in organic solvents [37]. Moreover, they show unique properties, including no vapor pressure and capacity to be recycled and to prevent the thermal deactivation of enzymes [30,38]. These properties can be useful in lipase-catalyzed biotransformation. In many cases, these media have been shown to improve the efficiency of lipase-catalyzed acylation reactions [31,39–41] and used to perform both ester and amide synthesis [38,42–44]. Despite the attractive properties of organic solvents and ionic liquids, few studies have been devoted to the lipase-catalyzed acylation of bifunctional substrates, exhibiting both amino and alcohol groups, such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, 2-amino-1-butanol, 6-amino-1-hexanol, serine and other amino-alcohols with variable carbon chain lengths [45–50]. In such reactions, the lipase catalyzes O-acylation or N-acylation with a chemoselectivity that is largely dependent on the amino-alcohol structure [26]. Among lipases used in organic synthesis, Candida antarctica lipase B is well known for its ability to convert alcohols and amines into esters and amides in various solvents [8,51] and seems to be the ideal enzyme for the acylation of compounds such as amino-alcohols. Moreover, commercially available immobilized C. antarctica lipase B, such as Novozym® 435, shows many advantages such as long-term stability at moderately high temperatures and a tolerance for polar and non-polar solvents [52]. In the present work, we investigated two organic solvents and one ionic liquid as reaction solvents in the acylation of three amino-alcohols, catalyzed by Novozym® 435, with myristic acid 1 as an acyl donor. In order to determine the optimum conditions for selective N-acylation and O-acylation of amino-alcohols and to maximize both the yield and the selectivity, the effects of amino-alcohol structure and solvent nature were compared."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Novozym® 435 (C. antarctica lipase B immobilized on acrylic resin), was kindly provided by Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark. (±)-Alaninol 2 (98%) and 6-amino-1-hexanol 6 (≥97%), as well as tert-amyl alcohol (99%) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (Bmim [PF6]) (≥97%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, USA) while (±)-4-amino-1-pentanol 4 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA). Myristic acid 1 and acetic acid were from Fluka (St. Quentin-Fallavier, Switzerland). All chemicals were dried over molecular sieves. Pure water was obtained via a Milli-Q system (Millipore, France). Acetonitrile, methanol, n-hexane, chloroform and 1-butanol were purchased from Carlo ERBA (Val-de-Reuil, France)."
3,Enzymatic acylation procedure,"2.2 Enzymatic acylation procedure 2.2.1 General procedure for lipase catalyzed amino-alcohol acylation In all cases, reactions were carried out at 55°C in screw-caped tubes. 2ml reaction mixtures containing various amounts of amino-alcohol (25–350mM) and 175mM of myristic acid 1 as an acyl donor were incubated for 10min prior to addition of 5gl−1 of Novozym® 435. Reactions were conducted for 96h. Initial rate measurements were also performed according to a previously established procedure [53]. The initial rates were calculated from the linear relationship of the total concentration of products against reaction time (0–1h in n-hexane and 0–2h in tert-amyl alcohol or Bmim [PF6]). 2.2.2 Procedure for amino-alcohol acylation in tert-amyl alcohol When using tert-amyl alcohol as a reaction solvent, 100μl samples were taken at intervals and centrifuged at 18,000× g for a minute. The supernatants were then analyzed by LC–MS, leading to the determination and quantification of remaining substrates and synthesized products. 2.2.3 Procedure for amino-alcohol acylation in n-hexane When using n-hexane as a reaction solvent, various samples containing the same concentration of reactants and enzyme were prepared and incubated under the same conditions. Reactions were then conducted in parallel and withdrawn at different times to determine the reaction progress. 6ml of a methanol/chloroform (50/50, v/v) mixture were then added in each sample and the reaction medium was homogenized. 500μl samples were taken and centrifuged at 18,000x g for a minute. The supernatants were then analyzed by LC–MS, leading to the determination and quantification of remaining substrates and synthesized products. 2.2.4 Procedure for amino-alcohol acylation in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate When using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (Bmim [PF6]) as a reaction solvent, various samples containing the same concentration of reactants and enzyme were prepared and incubated under the same conditions. Reactions were then conducted in parallel and withdrawn at different times to determine the reaction progress. 6ml of 1-butanol, a solvent that is immiscible with Bmim [PF6], were added in order to extract substrates and products from Bmim [PF6]. 500μl samples were taken from 1-butanol extracts and centrifuged at 18,000x g for a minute. The supernatants were then analyzed by LC–MS, leading to the determination and quantification of remaining substrates and synthesized products. The partition coefficient between Bmim [PF6] and 1-butanol was determined for all compounds (myristic acid 1 and acylated products) using the following procedure: a solution of Bmim [PF6] with a known concentration of each compound was prepared and then extracted in 1-butanol. The partition coefficient was calculated as the ratio of the final quantity determined by HPLC to the known initial quantity. All samples were performed in duplicate and the averages of duplicate partition coefficients were mentioned in Table 1 . Finally, it was used to correct the concentration values of all compounds in 1-butanol extracts."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods 2.3.1 HPLC–MS analysis Structural and quantitative analysis of reaction products were conducted using a LC/MS-ES (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) system from Agilent (1100 LC/MSD Trap mass spectrometer VL) with a C18 Prontosil 120-5-C18-AQ reversed-phase column (250mm×4mm, 5μm; Bischoff Chromatography, Germany). The elution of reaction samples was carried out at room temperature and at a flow rate of 1mlmin−1, using a mobile phase consisting in a mixture of two solvents: acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (77/23/0.1, v/v/v) (A) and methanol/acetic acid (100/0.1, v/v) (B). The following variations of the mobile phase were used during the time interval of the analysis: 100% solvent A from 0 to 20min; a linear gradient reaching 0% solvent A and 100% solvent B from 20 to 23min; 100% solvent B from 23 to 80min; a linear gradient reaching back 100% solvent A and 0% solvent B from 80 to 82min; 100% solvent A from 82min to the end of the run at 90min. Products were detected and quantified by differential refractometry and UV detection at 210nm. An external calibration was performed with pure myristic acid. Then, calibrations for individual acylation products were obtained after mass balance in reaction conditions enabling to obtain only these products with myristic acid as an acyl donor. Low-resolution mass spectral analyses were obtained by electrospray in the positive detection mode. Nitrogen was used as the drying gas at 15lmin−1 and 350°C at a nebulizer pressure of 4bar. The scan range was 50–1000 m/z using five averages and 13,000 m/z per second resolution. The capillary voltage was 4000V. Processing was done offline using HP Chemstation software. 2.3.2 Acylated-amino-alcohols purification and analysis for identification In order to perform the purification and characterization of acylated products, 20ml reaction mixtures containing 50mM of the amino-alcohol and 175mM of myristic acid 1 in tert-amyl alcohol were incubated for 24h in presence of 15gl−1 of Novozym® 435. Purified products were then characterized by 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and IR (infrared spectroscopy) after purification via preparative HPLC using a ProntoPrep C18 reversed-phase column (250mm×20mm, 10μm; Bischoff Chromatography, Germany) eluted via the mobile phase given in Section 2.3.1, at room temperature and at a flow rate of 5mlmin−1. 1H NMR were recorded on a JEOL-JNM LA400 spectrometer (400MHz), with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. Samples were studied as solutions in CDCl3. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded from 400 to 4000cm−1 with a resolution of 4cm−1 using a 100 ATR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA). 2.3.2.1 N-Myristyl 2-amino-1-propanol 3a m/z (LR-ESI+) C17H36NO2 (M+H+), found: 286.4, calculated for: 286.48.

5,Titration of Novozym® 435 active sites,"2.4 Titration of Novozym® 435 active sites In order to determine the amount of immobilized C. antarctica lipase B (Novozym® 435) active sites, a suicide inhibitor (4-methylumbelliferyl hexylphosphonate) was used according to the method developed by Fujiia et al. [54,52]. This inhibitor was added to 10mg of immobilized lipase (immobilized on beads of acrylic support), to a final concentration of 50μM. In this sample, acetonitrile was added to final volume of 1ml. 100μl sample solution was adding to 900μl of buffer (100mM Tris–HCl, 1mM CaCl2, pH 8.0), then fluorescence intensity was analyzed using a luminescence spectrometer (Luminescence Spectrometer Model LS-50B, Perkin-Elmer, MA, USA). The excitation wavelength was λ =360nm and the emission wavelength was λ =445nm. The active site amount was establish from the linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and the concentration of the leaving group 4-methylumbelliferone. Finally, the relationship between fluorescence intensity and the amount of beads containing immobilized lipase was linear. The resulting active C. antarctica lipase B load on beads was found to be 4.7% (%weight/weight) which equals 1.4μmol of lipase active site per gram of beads."
6,Determination of the kinetic parameters,"2.5 Determination of the kinetic parameters The kinetic parameters from amino-alcohol acylation were determined using Lineweaver–Burk reciprocal plots of initial rates versus amino-alcohol concentrations. The apparent maximum rates (V max,app) of myristic acid conversion, O-acylation and N-acylation were obtained by using y-intercept which correspond to the 1/V max,app value. The apparent catalytic constants (k cat,app) were then calculated as the ratio of the V max,app to the total amount of Novozym® 435 active sites in the reaction medium, which was previously determined by titration (1.4μmol of lipase active sites per gram of Novozym® 435: see Section 2.4). In parallel, the apparent Michaelis constants (K m,app) were obtained by using x-intercept which correspond to the −1/K m,app value."
7,Evaluation of the chemoselectivity,"2.6 Evaluation of the chemoselectivity The chemoselectivity of Novozym® 435 during the acylation of amino-alcohols was studied by comparing the alcohol group O-acylation and the amino group N-acylation, and then calculated via the apparent catalytic efficiency ratio (Eq. (1)) [55], which was transformed into an apparent catalytic constant ratio (Eq. (2)) owing to the fact that there is a unique K m,app for each bifunctional amino-alcohol. (1) C = k cat , app O -acylation / K m,app k cat , app N -acylation / K m , app (2) C = k cat , app O -acylation k cat , app N -acylation"
8,Hydrolysis tests,"2.7 Hydrolysis tests Hydrolysis tests of alaninol 2 acylation products were carried out using tert-amyl alcohol as a reaction solvent at 55°C in screw-caped tubes. 2ml reaction mixtures containing 200mM of water and 50mM of purified amide 3a or amido-ester 3c were incubated for 10min prior to addition of 5gl−1 of Novozym® 435. Reactions were conducted for 48h. 100μl samples were taken and centrifuged at 18,000× g for a minute. The supernatants were then analyzed by LC–MS, leading to the determination and quantification of remaining amide or amido-ester and hydrolysis products."

10,Effect of the solvent on the apparent kinetic parameters and the chemoselectivity of Novozym® 435 in the acylation of amino-alcohols,"3.1 Effect of the solvent on the apparent kinetic parameters and the chemoselectivity of Novozym® 435 in the acylation of amino-alcohols Two organic solvents (tert-amyl alcohol and n-hexane) and one ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; Bmim [PF6]) were used for the selective acylation of alaninol (2), 4-amino-1-pentanol (4) and 6-amino-1-hexanol (6) using myristic acid 1 as an acyl donor (Scheme 1 ). Bmim [PF6] was chosen as a model ionic liquid on the basis of several earlier studies which revealed the efficiency of Bmim [PF6] for O-acylation, transesterification and N-acylation reactions catalyzed by C. antarctica lipase B [56,57]. The two organic solvents were chosen from previous works found in the literature, which have demonstrated the efficacy of these solvents during the acylation of amino-polyol substrates catalyzed by lipases [8,53,58]. All experiments were performed in media containing various amounts of the amino-alcohol (25–350mM) as an acyl acceptor and 175mM of myristic acid 1 as an acyl donor. In the absence of enzyme, no product was detected within 2 days. LC–MS analysis demonstrated that the decrease in myristic acid 1 concentration is always concomitant with the synthesis of acylated products. The purification and the structural elucidation by MS, IR and NMR analyses identified the structure of the acylated products. The kinetic parameters for the acylation of amino-alcohols 2, 4 and 6 were determined using Lineweaver–Burk reciprocal plots. As shown in Fig. 1 , which describes the acylation of 4-amino-1-pentanol 4 in tert-amyl alcohol, a decrease in the initial rates of myristic acid 1 conversion, O-acylation and N-acylation, occurred when amino-alcohol was in excess (≥175mM). This phenomenon was also noticed on the acylation kinetic profile of alaninol 2 and 6-amino-1-hexanol 6, in both organic solvents and ionic liquid and could be attributed to an inhibitor effect similar to excess substrate inhibition. However, it was not observed in a previous work in which we performed the O-acylation of 2-butanol starting from myristic acid as an acyl donor under similar experimental conditions [59]. Thus, the decrease in initial rates is most likely due to an interaction between myristic acid 1 and the amino group of the amino-alcohol. Indeed, the presence of an amino substrate and a fatty acid substrate in an organic solvent generally leads to the formation of an ion-pair complex between both substrates, depending on the acido-basic conditions of the medium [46,53,58]. This salt complex makes the ion forms of both substrates non-reactive (NH3 + amine form and COO− fatty acid form) and therefore leads to the overestimation of the substrate concentrations that are actually available to the enzyme in the reaction medium. Maugard et al. [53] previously described this ion-pair complex as a limiting factor in lipase-catalyzed acylation, under conditions where it is less soluble than free substrates. To verify this hypothesis, the composition of the medium, in particular the carbonyl species was analyzed by IR spectroscopy at the start of the reaction using various concentrations of amino-alcohol 2 in tert-amyl alcohol as a reaction solvent. When myristic acid 1 alone was totally solubilized, only one carbonyl band was observed at 1710cm −1 (Table 2 , entry 1), corresponding to the acid form. When the concentration of amino-alcohol 2 was increased in the media, a decrease in the area of the carbonyl acid band (1710cm−1) was concomitant with an increase in the area of the carboxylate band (1562cm −1) (Table 2, entries 2–5). This demonstrates the formation of an ion-pair complex between substrates 1 and 2. Due to the inhibitor effect of the ion-pair complex at high substrate concentrations, the apparent kinetic parameters (k cat,app and K m,app) were obtained from Lineweaver–Burk reciprocal plots corresponding to amino-alcohols concentrations lower than 175mM. Indeed, no decrease in initial rates and de facto no inhibition due to the ion-pair complex formation was observed for these amino-alcohol concentrations. Thus, for amino-alcohol 4 acylation in tert-amyl alcohol (Fig. 1), the k cat,app values were 86min−1 for O-acylation (Fig. 1B) and 13min−1 for N-acylation (Fig. 1C) and 99min−1 for myristic acid 1 conversion (Fig. 1A) and the K m,app value of amino-alcohol 4 acylation was 75mM (Fig. 1A). The apparent kinetic parameters, the chemoselectivity ratio (C), as well as the log P values of amino-alcohols, are summarized in Table 3 . The log P value is defined as the logarithm of the partition coefficient of a given compound in a standard octanol/water biphasic system [60]. This parameter characterizes the hydrophobicity of a compound: the higher the log P value, the more hydrophobic the compound [61,62]. Table 3 provides a number of key information. In order to facilitate the comparison of the parameters described in this table, the effect of solvent nature on the K m,app, k cat,app and chemoselectivity is discussed separately. 3.1.1 Effect on the K m,app The K m,app of amino-alcohol 2 in tert-amyl alcohol (182mM) was 2- and 2.5-fold higher than the K m,app of long chain amino-alcohols 4 (75mM) and 6 (63mM), respectively (Table 3, entries 2, 5 and 8). This indicates a lower affinity of Novozym® 435 for short chain amino-alcohol 2. The same phenomenon is observed using Bmim [PF6] (Table 3, entries 3, 6 and 9). In contrast, the K m,app of short chain amino-alcohol 2 in n-hexane (18.7mM) was 1.5- and 2-fold lower than the K m,app of long chain amino-alcohols 4 (35.3mM) and 6 (53mM), respectively (Table 3, entries 1, 4 and 7), which indicates a switch in the affinity of Novozym® 435 in favour of the short chain amino-alcohol 2. To date, a clear consensus has not yet emerged on the parameters to quantitatively describe solvents and their influence on enzymatic reactions. However, it is well known that solvent hydrophobicity is a key factor, whose influence can be evaluated using the log P value [61,63,64]. The solvent effect can be analyzed using the probable relationship between enzyme activity and substrate solvation. In a hydrophilic solvent such as tert-amyl alcohol (log P 0.89) or Bmim [PF6] (log P −2.36), the solvation of the highly hydrophilic amino-alcohol 2 (log P −0.96) is favoured to the detriment of its availability for the enzyme. Thus, the affinity of the lipase for amino-alcohol 2 is lower than its affinity for other amino-alcohols in hydrophilic solvents, resulting in a higher K m,app value (Table 3). In contrast, in a hydrophobic solvent such as n-hexane (log P 3.90), the solvation of an amino-alcohol is favoured when its hydrophilicity decreases, the solvation of the more hydrophilic amino-alcohol 2 is therefore not favoured and this benefits its availability for the enzyme. Thus, the affinity of the lipase for amino-alcohol 2 is higher than its affinity for other amino-alcohols in hydrophobic solvents, resulting in a lower K m,app value (Table 3). In addition, Novozym® 435 consisting in C. antarctica lipase B immobilized on a positively charged acrylic polar resin, solvation of the biocatalyst would not be favoured in a hydrophobic solvent: as a concequence, this promote biocatalyst availability for polar substrates such as amino-alcohols in n-hexane, resulting in a lower K m,app value. These results are in accordance with several studies that have demonstrated that the use of various supports (polar or apolar) allows to modulate activity and selectivity of a particular immobilized lipase used in various solvents [17]. 3.1.2 Effect on the k cat,app of myristic acid conversion In this work, the k cat,app of myristic acid conversion is a representative parameter of the biocatalyst activity for the amino-alcohol acylation. Indeed, the k cat,app of myristic acid conversion corresponds to the sum of k cat,app of mono-N-acylation, mono-O-acylation and amido-ester synthesis. n-Hexane was the most effective reaction solvent, in terms of k cat,app of myristic acid 1 conversion, to enhance the activity of Novozym® 435, regardless of the three amino-alcohols tested. Catalytic activity was lowest using Bmim [PF6]. The k cat,app of myristic acid 1 conversion from the acylation of amino-alcohol 2 in n-hexane (357min−1) was 6- and 11-fold higher than the k cat,app of myristic acid 1 conversion in tert-amyl alcohol (58min−1) and in Bmim [PF6] (33min−1), respectively (Table 3, entries 1–3). These results are not surprising given that tert-amyl alcohol and Bmim [PF6] are the most polar of the three solvents used. Indeed, the polarity of solvents is well known to dramatically influence the catalytic activity of enzymes [63–68]. Extremely or intermediary hydrophilic polar solvents, such as tert-amyl alcohol, interact with the absolute amount of water, indispensable in the acquisition and the maintenance of enzyme conformation. These solvents strip off water molecules from the enzyme, resulting in either a change in the conformation and flexibility of the enzyme or a negative effect on the transition state stability and, thus, on catalytic activity. Apart from their potential interactions with water molecules, hydrophilic polar solvents also interact with the secondary structure of the enzyme via multiple hydrogen bonds and via other strong interactions. This can lead to an alteration in the protein conformation and thus a negative effect on catalytic activity. However, the low k cat,app of myristic acid 1 conversion obtained in Bmim [PF6] (Table 3, entries 3, 6 and 9) can also be explained by limiting factors such as diffusion and mass-transfer limitations associated with the high viscosity of this ionic liquid [69,70]. Moreover, anions such as [PF6] can strongly interact with the positively charged sites in the C. antarctica lipase B structure, potentially causing conformational changes [71]. In addition, it must be taken into consideration that ionic liquids form ion-pairs that can interact with both the carboxyl group of fatty acid and amino groups of amino-alcohols. On a one hand, these interactions could modulate the ionization state of the substrates and the enzyme and thus affect catalytic activity. On the other hand, they may stabilize substrate ionic form and promote as a result the formation of an ion-pair complex between both substrates. This would cause higher limitation of substrate availability in Bmim [PF6] than in n-hexane and tert-amyl alcohol. 3.1.3 Effect on the chemoselectivity The chemoselectivity of the Novozym® 435-catalyzed acylation of the three amino-alcohols was evaluated using the chemoselectivity ratio (C) (Eq. (2)). The acylation of amino-alcohol 2 in n-hexane and Bmim [PF6] gave similar C values, close to 0.1 (Table 3, entries 1 and 3), as no ester 3b was detected in tert-amyl alcohol (Table 3, entry 2). In contrast, C values of 539 and 10.5 were obtained for the acylation of amino-alcohol 6 in n-hexane and tert-amyl alcohol, respectively (Table 3, entries 7 and 8), when only trace amounts of amide 7a were detected in Bmim [PF6] (Table 3, entry 9) (the experimental detection limit by LC–MS analysis was 2μM). Similarly, C value of 6.61 was observed for the acylation of amino-alcohol 4 in tert-amyl alcohol (Table 3, entry 5) while amide 5a was detected as trace amounts not only in Bmim [PF6] but also in n-hexane (Table 3, entries 4 and 6). According to these data, Novozym® 435 shows higher selectivity towards N-acylation of amino-alcohol 2, which has two carbons between the alcohol and amino groups. Moreover, we can also conclude that Novozym® 435 is more chemoselective for O-acylation of substrates 4 and 6, which are long chain amino-alcohols exhibiting four and six carbons between their alcohol and amino groups, respectively. In addition, the fact that the higher k cat,app of O-acylation was obtained with amino-alcohol 6 (Table 3, entries 7–9) in comparison with amino-alcohol 4 (Table 3, entries 4–6) can be explained not only by the increase in the carbon chain length but also by the fact that amino-alcohol 6 is a primary alcohol while amino-alcohol 4 is a secondary one. Indeed, it has been widely demonstrated in the literature that lipase-catalyzed acylation of primary alcohols generally occurs with a higher catalytic activity than the acylation of secondary alcohols [72–74]."
11,Effect of the solvent and of the amino-alcohol concentration on the production of acylated amino-alcohols catalyzed by Novozym® 435,"3.2 Effect of the solvent and of the amino-alcohol concentration on the production of acylated amino-alcohols catalyzed by Novozym® 435 3.2.1 Time-course of alaninol acylation in tert-amyl alcohol, n-hexane and Bmim [PF6] Prior to study the Novozym® 435-catalyzed acylation of amino-alcohols 2, 4 and 6 in terms of production at a fixed time, the reaction was carried out in n-hexane, tert-amyl-alcohol and Bmim [PF6], using 35mM amino-alcohol and 175mM myristic acid 1, and monitored over time. Fig. 2 shows the time-course of alaninol 2 acylation. During this reaction conducted in Bmim [PF6] (Fig. 2C), ester 3b was detected only as trace amounts as it was not detected in tert-amyl alcohol (the experimental detection limit was 2μM). On the other hand, amide 3a was the main product synthesized in tert-amyl alcohol at a plateau of substrate and products concentrations reached after 96h with a maximum yield close to 100% (based on starting alaninol 2) (Fig. 2B), whereas it was predominant only over the first 30min and 24h of reactions effected in n-hexane and Bmim [PF6], respectively (Fig. 2A and C). After these times, amide 3a was then consumed to the benefit of amido-ester 3c synthesis, which became the main product after 96h with maximum yields close to 99% and 90% in n-hexane and Bmim [PF6], respectively (based on starting alaninol 2). Interestingly, this plateau was also reached after 96h for reactions involving amino-alcohols 4 and 6, whatever the solvent (data not shown). On the other hand, the time-course of the increase in amido-ester concentration was clearly concomitant with the decrease in amide concentration. These results suggest that the synthesis of the amido-ester may proceed sequentially according to three hypothetic pathways described in Scheme 2 : • Either the N-acylation of alaninol 2 occurs first and is then followed by the O-acylation of the amide synthesized in the first step (Scheme 2; pathways (A) then (E)); • Or the O-acylation of alaninol 2 occurs first and is then followed by the N-acylation of the ester synthesized in the first step (Scheme 2; pathways (B) then (F)); • Or the O-acylation of alaninol 2 occurs first and is then followed by the aminolysis of the ester, which would be used as an acyl donor to give the amide via a kinetically controlled process involving the formation of the acyl enzyme from the ester that would be released by the attack of the amine, as reported by Volker Kasche works to describe the mechanism of amidase–catalyzed amine acylation using esters as acyl donors [75,76]. Once formed, the amide would then be O-acylated to give the amido-ester (Scheme 2; pathways (B) then (D) then (E)). These three hypothetic pathways take into account the possibility that hydrolysis reactions occur. To evaluate their probability, we purified and placed under hydrolysis conditions the amide and the amido-ester. It was thus shown that amide bonds could not be hydrolyzed by Novozym® 435 (Scheme 2; pathways (G 1) then (G 4)). By cons, the ester bond of the amido-ester was shown to be hydrolysed, giving 80% conversion into the amide after 48h of reaction. However, there is no evidence that this type of reaction would occur under our experimental synthesis conditions: no increase in the concentration of myristic acid was indeed observed over time in the three solvents tested (Fig. 2). Similarly, no result can confirm or refute the possibility of an alcoholysis reaction leading to the conversion of the amide into the ester (Scheme 2; pathway (C)) but this side reaction is very unlikely to happen given that the hydrolysis of amide bonds was shown not to occur under hydrolysis conditions. Hypothesis 2 is strongly unlikely considering that the reaction time-course revealed that the amido-ester production was concomitant with the amide concentration decrease in the three solvents tested. Hypothesis 3 would, on the other hand, necessarily imply the rate of the ester conversion in the second step (Scheme 2; pathway (D)) being at least as fast as its formation in the first step to make it undetectable all along the reaction time-course, but has to be considered. We focused in a previous work on the kinetic analysis of Novozym® 435-catalyzed acylation of a mono-alcohol and a mono-amine structurally related to alaninol 2 carried out in tert-amyl alcohol under similar experimental conditions. We demonstrated then that (R)-2-butanol O-acylation rate was 22-fold faster than (R)-sec-butylamine N-acylation rate [59]. On this basis, we would expect the ester intermediate to accumulate in the reaction medium before being converted into the amido-ester (Scheme 2; pathway (F)), which is, however, not the case: this ester intermediate is detected at best as trace amounts whatever the reaction time or the solvent tested. In addition, we also showed in this previous work that the N-acylation rates obtained for the enzymatic acylation of bifunctionnal compounds such as 1-methoxy-2-propylamine and 1,2-diaminopropane, catalyzed by Novozym® 435 in tert-amyl alcohol at 55°C, were 8- and 38-fold higher, respectively, than the N-acylation rate of the related mono-amine (sec-butylamine) [77]. These bifunctionnal compounds are structurally related to alaninol 2 but exhibit no alcohol group in their structure and thus cannot possibly be O-acylated. For this reason, we formulated the following postulate for amino-alcohol acylation: the presence of an alcohol group in β-position of the amino group of the acyl acceptor would result in the enhancement in the rate of N-acylation. This may be due to the formation of an intramolecular interaction between the amino group and the alcohol group located in β-position, which is strengthened by the fact that this interaction could not occur for amino-alcohols 4 and 6, considering the longer distance between both functional groups, giving as a result low rates of N-acylation. In order to confirm and develop this new postulate, molecular modelling studies were conducted to precisely understand the Novozym® 435-catalyzed N-acylation mechanism using a methoxy-amine, a di-amine, a short chain amino-alcohol or a long chain amino-alcohol as an acyl acceptor. These studies recently led to propose a new proton shuttle reaction mechanism to explain chemoselectivity for Novozym® 435-catalyzed N-acylation of alaninol 2 and 4-amino-1-pentanol 4 [26]. As a consequence, despite that no data collected from the present work or the previous ones categorically rule out the hypothetic sequence 3 (Scheme 2; pathways (B), then (D) and (E)), the synthesis of amido-ester seems more likely to proceed predominantly via the hypothetic sequence 1 (Scheme 2; pathways (A) then (E)). Furthermore, our results also suggest that the amide is a better acyl acceptor than the amino-alcohol for enzymatic acylation, especially when using n-hexane: in this solvent, a rate of 4.4mmolh−1 g−1 was measured for the mono-acylation of alaninol 2 while a higher rate of 7mmolh−1 g−1 was obtained for the O-acylation of amide 3a, leading to the synthesis of amido-ester 3c. This selectivity may be related to the differential partition of the amide and the amino-alcohol in the enzyme microenvironment [77,78]. As previously described, Novozym® 435 indeed consists in C. antarctica lipase B immobilized on a positively charged acrylic polar resin. A cationic charge repulsion phenomenon seems therefore likely to occur between the cationic charges of the enzyme carrier and the protonated amine form of alaninol 2, coming from the formation of an ion-pair complex between the amino-alcohol and myristic acid: we previously demonstrated this phenomenon in tert-amyl alcohol (see Section 3.1) and it has already been proved that the use of non-polar solvents such as n-hexane promotes and stabilizes the formation of this ion-pair complex because polar amino-alcohols are slightly solubilized while ion-pair complex forms of amino-alcohols are highly solubilized in these solvents [46]. This is due to the carboxylic acid playing the role of phase transfer agent for the amino-alcohol, which improves its solubility. As a result, cationic charge repulsion could theoretically lead to a decrease in the concentration of the amino-alcohol in the enzyme microenvironment. In contrast, the uncharged amide function would not be repulsed by the enzyme carrier and would therefore be more available than the amino-alcohol in the enzyme microenvironment, which would explain why the rates of amide O-acylation are higher than the rates of amino-alcohol mono-acylation in n-hexane. Finally, to identify optimal, highly selective conditions required to produce monoacylated and diacylated compounds, the influences of the amino-alcohol concentration and substrate molar ratio r ([myristic acid 1]/[amino-alcohol]) were investigated. All experiments were performed using the same conditions as in Section 3.1. Figs. 3–5 show the product distribution in n-hexane, tert-amyl alcohol and Bmim [PF6] solvents, after 96h of Novozym® 435-catalyzed acylation of amino-alcohols 2, 4 and 6. This reaction time was chosen to reach a plateau for the production of acylated amino-alcohols under all experimental conditions such as previously described. 3.2.2 Production of acylated amino-alcohols in n-hexane The data in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the use of n-hexane gives two major products, depending on the r-value. At initial amino-alcohol concentrations inferior or equal to 100mM (r ≥1.75), the selective production of amido-esters 3c, 5c or 7c is improved, up to 49mM for amido-ester 3c production (56% yield based on starting myristic acid 1). Amino-alcohol concentrations superior to 100mM (r <1.75) enhances the production of monoacylated compounds. The synthesis of amides from amino-alcohols 2 and 4 reached 166mM for amide 3a and 138mM for amide 5a (95% and 79% yields based on starting myristic acid 1) under stoichiometric conditions (Fig. 3A and B). Moreover, ester 3b was not detected and ester 5b was negligible. Hence, stoichiometric conditions are the optimal conditions for acylation of amino-alcohols 2 and 4, and favour both the synthesis yield and the chemoselectivity of amide production. On the other hand, the production of ester 7b from the longest amino-alcohol 6 (6 carbons) (Fig. 3C) was improved and reached up to 68mM (39% yield based on starting myristic acid 1) using 100mM starting amino-alcohol 6. Again, this change in the chemoselectivity of Novozym® 435 at 96h, which is shown to be dependent on the carbon chain length between the alcohol and amino groups of the amino-alcohol, was in accordance with its chemoselectivity under initial velocity conditions, previously described in Section 3.1. An interesting result of this study, which should be highlighted, is the decrease in the global conversion yield observed when a large excess (350mM) of amino-alcohol (r <0.7) is used. This is true for all amino-alcohols tested. The decrease could be explained by the formation of a non-reactive ion-pair complex between myristic acid 1 and the amino-alcohol as described in the previous section. The formation of this complex would indeed be favoured in non-polar solvents such as n-hexane [46] and would drastically affect the availability of both substrates for the enzyme, especially in excess of the amino-alcohol. 3.2.3 Production of acylated amino-alcohols in tert-amyl alcohol Similar experiments were performed using tert-amyl alcohol as a polar protic solvent (Fig. 4). The acylation of amino-alcohol 2 in tert-amyl alcohol (Fig. 4A) leads predominantly to the production of amide 3a and was enhanced by an increase in amino-alcohol 2 concentration, reaching a maximum value of 172mM (98% yield based on starting myristic acid 1) for initial amino-alcohol 2 concentrations superior or equal to 250mM. However, ester 3b was not detected and the production of amido-ester 3c was negligible. Acylation of amino-alcohols 4 and 6 (Fig. 4B and C) studies were also performed: esters 5b and 7b were detected and quantified although their production remained low. On the other hand, the production of amido-esters 5c and 7c were predominant and reached maxima of 30mM and 20mM (34% and 23% yields based on starting myristic acid 1), respectively, for concentrations in long chain amino-alcohol lower than 50mM (r >3.5). The production of amides 5a and 7a was improved for concentrations higher than 50mM (r <3.5). Under the best conditions used (250mM starting amino-alcohol 4 or 6), production close to 53mM of amides 5a or 7a (30% yield based on starting myristic acid 1) was reached. On the other hand, in contrast to the results obtained in n-hexane, no decrease of global yield was observed in tert-amyl alcohol when a large excess (350mM) of amino-alcohol (r <0.7) was used. This could be explained by the likely complete solubilization of substrates in this solvent which would make the ion-pair complex formation less favoured and less stable than in n-hexane. Both substrates would be therefore more available for the enzymatic reaction than in n-hexane. In summary, amide production at 96h is improved in tert-amyl alcohol for all amino-alcohols tested, although acylation catalyzed by Novozym® 435 of amino-alcohols exhibits higher k cat,app of O-acylation than k cat,app of N-acylation as described in Section 3.1. These results suggest that Novozym® 435 favours the synthesis of the amide as a thermodynamic product whereas the ester, which is preferentially synthesized under initial velocity conditions, can be considered as a kinetic product. 3.2.4 Production of acylated amino-alcohols in Bmim [PF6] Finally, Bmim [PF6] was tested as a solvent (Fig. 5). The use of 100mM amino-alcohol (low excess of myristic acid 1; r = 1.75) in Bmim [PF6] gave the highest amido-ester production of all our experiments, reaching 77, 65 and 20mM of amido-esters 3c, 5c and 7c (88%, 74% and 23% yields based on starting myristic acid 1), respectively. However, when amino-alcohol concentration was higher than 130mM (r <1.35) a sharp decrease in amido-ester production was observed. In contrast, the production of esters 5b and 7b (Fig. 5B and C) never exceeded 20mM (11% yield based on starting myristic acid 1) and the production of amides was enhanced when amino-alcohol concentration increased from 100 to 175mM (1.75> r >1), reaching up to 74mM of amide 5a (42% yield based on starting myristic acid 1) under stoichiometric conditions."
12,Conclusion,"In this work, we firstly evaluated the effect of reaction solvent on the activity and chemoselectivity of Novozym® 435 (immobilized C .ntarctica lipase B) for the acylation of three amino-alcohols (alaninol 2, 4-amino-1-pentanol 4 and 6-amino-1-hexanol 6) using myristic acid 1 as an acyl donor. Our results suggest that the nature of the solvent affects both the availability of substrates and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In contrast, we also found that the chemoselectivity of Novozym® 435 under initial velocity conditions is mainly affected by amino-alcohol structure rather than by the reaction solvent. In particular, we have shown that the k cat,app of N-acylation is improved when using the short chain amino-alcohol alaninol 2 whereas the k cat,app of O-acylation is improved when using the longer chain amino-alcohols 4-amino-1-pentanol 4 and 6-amino-1-hexanol 6. This demonstrates the strong influence of substrate structure on the chemoselectivity of Novozym® 435, and provides new insights into the selective synthesis of amides or esters produced from the acylation of bifunctional substrates. Furthermore, we also investigated the impact of amino-alcohol structure, solvent nature and substrate molar ratio on enzymatic production obtained at a plateau of products concentrations after 96h of reaction. From a general point of view, our work clearly demonstrates clearly that the production of acylated amino-alcohols catalyzed by Novozym® 435 after 96h is markedly influenced by three main parameters: • Reaction solvent: tert-amyl alcohol improves the production of amides 3a, 5a and 7a while Bmim [PF6] favours the formation of amido-esters 3c and 5c . • [myristic acid 1]/[amino-alcohol] molar ratio (r): under stoichiometric conditions and in excess of the amino-alcohol (r ≤1) in tert-amyl alcohol and n-hexane, the production of monoacylated amino-alcohols is improved in most cases. On the other hand, a large excess of myristic acid 1 (r >1) enhances amido-ester production in n-hexane and Bmim [PF6]. • Amino-alcohol structure: chemoselective production of monoacylated amino-alcohols is markedly affected by the amino-alcohol structure. Using n-hexane and in excess of amino-alcohol, amide production from alaninol 2 and ester production from the longer chain amino-alcohol 6-amino-1-hexanol 6 were favoured. Together with our previously published work [59,77], these data give a clearer understanding of the parameters affecting the Novozym® 435-catalyzed acylation of amino-alcohols, which is important in order to maximize both the yields and the chemoselectivity of these reactions. In addition, n-hexane and tert-amyl alcohol used as solvents in this work can potentially be replaced by other organic solvents with similar properties but considered as more environmentally friendly, such as for example: cyclopentane and tert-butanol. As prospect, it is also conceivable to test the influence of other parameters to modulate lipase properties, for example the use of various supports to immobilize C. antarctica lipase B. Indeed, the use of various immobilization protocols to produce a biocatalyst starting from a particular lipase has been shown to significantly affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity, depending on the solvent used [28,29]. On the other hand, it would also be interesting to test other lipases as biocatalysts, such as for instance Rhizomucor miehei lipase which has already been used to acylate amino-alcohol substrates [5]."
