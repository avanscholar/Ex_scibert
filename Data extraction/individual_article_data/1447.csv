0,Introduction,"In recent years there is an increased interest in producing advanced biofuels from alternative feedstocks. The need to improve energy yields and allay sustainability concerns including land use change of first and second generation biofuels have led to research of algae (both macro and micro) as viable substrates for the production of advanced biofuels. Algal biofuels can overcome the food-or-fuel debate associated with first generation biofuels [1,2] and do not face the complex conversion processes required for second generation biofuel production [3,4]. Aquatic algae possess several advantages over terrestrial plants. Firstly, both macro-algae and micro-algae have higher growth rates and biomass productivities as compared to agricultural crops [5–7]. Secondly, the cultivation of algae may not require arable lands or fresh water. A win-win situation can be achieved through coupling algae production with wastewater treatment [8–10]. Thirdly, algae may provide continuous biomass supply throughout the year with optimised cultivation such as CO2 supplementation using flue gas for micro-algae [11,12] and efficient preservation such as ensiling for macro-algae [13]. Production of liquid biofuels (such as biodiesel and bioethanol) using algae biomass has been extensively explored [14,15]. However, the parasitic energy demand for the generation of liquid biofuels from raw feedstocks exceeds that in the conversion from substrates to gaseous biofuels such as biohydrogen and biomethane [16–18], leading to comparatively lower overall energy efficiencies. Besides, gaseous biofuels offer more utilisation options, including: compression for vehicles fuels; injection into the existing natural gas grids for use as renewable heat in industry such as breweries [19]; on site electricity generation using internal combustion engines [20]; or increased efficiency through use of biomethane from the gas grid at combined cycle gas turbines. Biological hydrogen production through dark hydrogen fermentation of algae biomass shows advantages over conventional energy-intensive hydrogen-producing methods such as steam methane reforming [21] due to the mild reaction conditions and renewability of the produced hydrogen [22]. However, limited energy conversion restricts its application. An alternative gaseous product biomethane generated through biological anaerobic digestion of algae biomass with better energy output has been analysed in previous studies [15,23,24]. Nevertheless, some major bottlenecks still restrict the application of this process. The abundant recalcitrant organics such as polyphenols in macro-algae [5] and triglycerides in micro-algae are not readily digested by the microbes and thereby decrease the biodegradability of biomass [23]. In addition, the rigid cell wall structures of algae act as barriers between the intracellular biodegradable contents and anaerobic microbes, hence hindering the degradation and methanogenesis of algae biomass in anaerobic digestion process [24]. To tackle this problem, a two-stage process combining hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion can serve as a promising solution. The two-stage set-up separates the process phases and optimises the operational conditions for each. In the first stage of hydrogen fermentation, the anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB) favour the pH condition of 5–6 where they can efficiently degrade the large-molecular-weight organics such as carbohydrates and proteins into gaseous hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and liquid soluble metabolic products (such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, and lactic acid) in a short retention time (2–4 days) [22]. Subsequently, the liquid fermentation effluents rich in small-molecular-weight VFAs and alcohols can be readily utilised by the methanogenic organisms in the second stage of anaerobic digestion. Therefore, compared with one-stage anaerobic digestion, the two-stage process presents better energy yields with improved biogas production and significantly shortens the overall retention time with concurrent increase in organic loading rates (OLRs). Yang et al. [25] used lipid-extracted residues of micro-algae Scenedesmus for two-stage batch fermentative hydrogen and methane co-production and obtained a 22% increase in methane yield and a 27% increase in energy efficiency in contrast to that in one-stage anaerobic digestion. Massanet-Nicolau et al. [26] investigated the two-stage continuous fermentative hydrogen and methane co-production of pelletized grass, which exhibited an overall energy yield of 11.74 kJ/g volatile solids (VS) with an increase of 13.4% compared with one-stage anaerobic digestion. Process stability was maintained whilst the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was greatly shortened from 20 days in the one-stage to 12 days in the two-stage process [26]. Apart from relatively limited biodegradability of algae compared with some first generation feedstocks [5], the intrinsic compositional unbalance of certain algae biomass (in particular micro-algae biomass) can impair the anaerobic digestion process [27]. Proteins occupy a large portion of organics in micro-algae, leading to a low C/N ratio in the biomass. The excessive nitrogen is released in the form of ammonia during the degradation of proteins, resulting in severe decrease in the microbial activities of methanogenic microbes [28]. By contrast, some species of macro-algae, such as brown seaweeds Laminaria digitata and Saccharina latissima, contain rich carbohydrates and have a high C/N ratio when harvested at optimum times [5]. This can in certain cases lead to limited nitrogen supply for the basic metabolisms of AFB in hydrogen fermentation and the methanogens in anaerobic digestion [29]. The optimum C/N ratio was suggested to be 20–30 for algal feedstocks [21,30]. Thus, adjusting the C/N ratio by mixing nitrogen-rich micro-algae and carbon-rich macro-algae as co-substrates offers an excellent strategy to improve the process performances of both hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion. Xia et al. [29] mixed micro-algae Arthrospira platensis and macro-algae L. digitata for batch fermentative hydrogen production and achieved an optimal H2 yield of 85.0 mL/gVS at a C/N ratio of 26.2. A study on the continuous one-stage anaerobic digestion of mixed A. platensis and L. digitata at a C/N ratio of 25 was conducted and the highest specific methane yield (SMY) of 273.9 mL/gVS was recorded at an OLR of 3.0 gVS/L/d and an HRT of 28 days [27]. Although many micro-algae species thrive in tropical and sub-tropical waters while macro-algae are commonly found in temperate seas, the micro-algae cultivation in temperate regions using seawater and flue gas from coal-fired power plants provides the possibility of harvesting micro- and macro-algae biomass in the same place [2,5,12]. The authors previously conducted a two-stage batch fermentative hydrogen and methane co-production using co-substrates of macro-algae (L. digitata) and micro-algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Nannochloropsis oceanica) [31]. The micro-algae biomass supplied nitrogen to balance the C/N ratio of the algal mixtures. Co-fermentation facilitated the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of the algal co-substrates and further boosted the energy conversion in anaerobic digestion. Although the batch co-fermentation provided some innovative findings, these experimental configurations have significant limitations. Batch systems allow sufficient guaranteed retention times, efficient mixing and anaerobic conditions; they also allow an optimum inoculum to substrate VS ratio of 2:1 which minimises inhibitory effects such as accumulation of volatile fatty acids and ammonia. Batch assays have limited replicability compared with likely industrial applications. In the majority of commercial industrial applications, the loading of reactor is continuous. As such it is necessary to undertake continuous laboratory experiments to assess the impact of higher OLRs and shorter HRTs for a prosperous and stable fermentation process. Economics dictate the need for high processing capability and biofuel outputs for minimum size of reactor system. Therefore, continuous two-stage laboratory co-fermentation is essential to address long term optimised operational conditions. Nevertheless, to date, long term continuous two-stage co-fermentation of micro- and macro-algae biomass remains uninvestigated in literature. This paper will address this knowledge gap in the state of the art through the following objectives: (1) Assess co-generation of hydrogen and methane using the mixture of macro-algae (L. digitata) and micro-algae (A. platensis) at the optimal C/N ratio of 20 with increasing OLRs. (2) Evaluate the effects of different OLRs and HRTs on the specific hydrogen yields (SHYs) and the acidification yields in first-stage dark hydrogen fermentation, and the SMYs in second-stage anaerobic digestion. (3) Compare the performances of two-stage and one-stage systems on the overall energy conversion and process stability. (4) Estimate the gross energy potential of this advanced gaseous biofuel system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Algal biomass and inocula,"2.1 Algal biomass and inocula The macro-algae L. digitata was naturally grown in the open sea and collected in September in West Cork, Ireland. The harvested L. digitata was washed with tap water to remove attached sands and other impurities, and then cut to small particles (4–5 mm) by a mincer (Buffalo Heavy Duty Mincer CD400). The micro-algae powder of A. platensis was purchased from Bluegreen Life Foundation Inc. (Lewes, DE, USA). Both macro- and micro-algal samples were cryopreserved at −20 °C before the experiment. The hydrogen inoculum used in biohydrogen potential (BHP) test and continuous hydrogen reactor was taken from the anaerobic sludge of an Irish farm digester. The original sludge was heated at 100 °C in an autoclave (Sanyo MLS-3780, Japan) for 30 min to inactivate methanogens and subsequently acclimatised 3 times (3 days each time) using a modified culture medium to activate the spore-forming hydrogenogenic bacteria. The compositions of the modified medium were detailed in our previous study [31]. The inoculum used in the biomethane potential (BMP) test and continuous digestion reactors was obtained from the digestate of an existing laboratory scale seaweed anaerobic digester. The methane inoculum was degassed at a temperature of 37 °C for 7 days before the experiment."
3,Biohydrogen and biomethane potential tests,"2.2 Biohydrogen and biomethane potential tests The two-stage batch BHP and BMP tests on the mixture of L. digitata and A. platensis were conducted in triplicate in an AMPTS II system (Bioprocess Control, Sweden). In the BHP test, 3 g VS of the algal substrate were added to each glass bottle and then the liquor volume was adjusted to 270 mL using distilled water. Subsequently, 30 mL of hydrogen inoculum was added into each bottle to make the total working volume 300 mL. The VS portions of the two algal biomass in each bottle were calculated to effect a C/N ratio of 20: 2.82 gVS of L. digitata mixed with 0.18 gVS of A. platensis. The initial pH was adjusted to 6.00 ± 0.05 with 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl solutions. All bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and purged with N2 for 5 min to maintain anaerobic conditions, and then placed in a water bath at a temperature of 37 °C for 4 days. Stirrers which were set to switch between on and off for 60 s periods with a mixing speed of 60 rpm were applied to the bottles. Carbon dioxide in the produced gas was absorbed by 80 mL of 3 M NaOH solution and then the hydrogen gas flow was recorded by a gas tipping device based on water displacement. The recorded hydrogen gas volumes were automatically normalised to standard temperature and pressure (STP) and zero moisture content by the AMPST II system. After the BHP test, the effluent in each bottle was analysed and then prepared for subsequent BMP test. The pH values of effluents were adjusted to 8.00 ± 0.05 with 1 M NaOH and then inoculated with methane inoculum at the inoculum to substrate VS ratio of 2:1. The total working volume of each bottle was 400 mL and the BMP test ran for 26 days so that the two-stage batch BHP and BMP tests duration reached 30 days. All the other BMP test settings were the same as those in the BHP test. A control group with just blank inocula (no substrates) was established and all the hydrogen and methane volumes produced from experimental groups were corrected for the ones produced from control group."
4,Set-up and operation of continuous reactors,"2.3 Set-up and operation of continuous reactors Four lab-scale (5 L) continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR), which comprised of one H2 reactor and three CH4 reactors, were used for the continuous fermentation trials as shown in Fig. 1 . The H2 reactor and CH4 reactors A and B comprised the two-stage fermentation systems. The CH4 reactor C acted as a one-stage fermentation system as a comparison to the two-stage system. The working volumes of H2 reactor and CH4 reactors were 3 L and 4 L, respectively. The temperature of the reactors was maintained at 37 ± 1 °C using a temperature controller unit. The volume of the produced biogas from each reactor was measured using a wet tip gas meter which was connected to an automated data acquisition system. The reactor configuration has been detailed in previous studies [27,32]. The HRT of the H2 reactor was set to 4 days. The HRTs of CH4 reactors A and B were set to 12 days and 24 days, respectively. The HRT of the one-stage CH4 reactor C was set to 16 days to match the overall HRT of the first two-stage system comprising of the H2 reactor and the CH4 reactor A. In a similar fashion, the overall HRT of the second two-stage system comprising of the H2 reactor and CH4 reactor B was set to 28 days to match the one in a previous study that investigated the one-stage co-digestion of L. digitata and A. platensis for methane production [27]. The OLR of the H2 reactor was increased from 3.0 to 12.0 gVS/L/d with an increment of 3.0 gVS/L/d each time. This was achieved by diluting the algal biomass with a calculated volume of water to keep the HRT unchanged. Every time after feeding, the pH value in H2 reactor was adjusted to ca. 5.5 using 1 M NaOH solution to ensure the pH did not drop to a level to inhibit hydrogen-producing microbes. The effluent from the H2 reactor was divided into three parts: the first one as the feedstock for CH4 reactor A, the second one as the feedstock for CH4 reactor B, and the third one for analyses. The OLR of CH4 reactor A ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 gVS/L/d with an increment of 1.0 gVS/L/d each time, whilst that of CH4 reactor B increased from 0.5 to 2.0 gVS/L/d with an increment of 0.5 gVS/L/d each time. The OLR of the CH4 reactor C (in the single stage system) started from 1.0 gVS/L/d with an increment of 1.0 gVS/L/d until reactor failure was observed. Each OLR of each reactor was maintained constant for 48 days, which equates to two HRTs of CH4 reactor C, which had the longest retention time."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Total solids (TS) and VS contents of L. digitata, A. platensis, and inocula were determined using Standard Methods 2540 G [33]. The pH value was measured using a pH meter (Jenway 3510, UK). The ratio of VFAs to total alkalinity (FOS/TAC) was determined based on a two points titration method using 0.1 N H2SO4 with end points of pH 5.0 and pH 4.4 [34]. Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents were determined by an elemental analyser (Exeter Analytical CE 440, UK) and oxygen was calculated as the remaining content of VS. Soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) and total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) were measured using Hach Lange cuvette tests (LCK 914 and LCK 303, respectively) and evaluated on a DR3900 Hach Lange Spectrophotometer. Salinity of effluents was determined on a VWR hand held C0310 monitor (VWR international, USA). The composition of biogas (H2, CO2, O2, N2, and CH4) produced in CSTR reactors was determined using a gas chromatograph (GC, Hewlett Packard HP6890, USA) equipped with a Hayesep R packed column and a thermal conductivity detector. The compositions of VFAs in the effluents were determined using a GC (Hewlett Packard HP6890, USA) equipped with a Nukol fused silica capillary column and a flame ionisation detector [32]."
6,Calculations,"2.5 Calculations The energy values of L. digitata and A. platensis were calculated using the weight percentages of C, H, N, and O on the basis of the modified Dulong Formula as shown in Eq. (1) [35]: (1) Energy value of algal biomass kJ/kg = 337 C + 1419 H − 0 . 125 O + 23 . 26 N The energy conversion efficiency (ECE) was calculated based on Eq. (2) [36]. (2) ECE = Energy value of H 2 + Energy value of CH 4 Original energy value of algal biomass × 100 % The total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD) of algal biomass was calculated based on the element compositions using Eq. (3) [32]: (3) C a H b O c N d + ( a + b 4 − c 2 − 3 4 d ) O 2 → a C O 2 + b − 3 d 2 H 2 O + d N H 3 The acidification yield in the H2 reactor is defined as the percentage of the COD from VFAs to sCOD as shown in Eq. (4) [32]: (4) Acidification yield = COD VFAs sCOD increase × 100 % The theoretical calculation of biomethane yield was based on the Buswell equation as shown in Eq. (5) [32]: (5) C a H b O c N d + ( a − b 4 − c 2 + 3 4 d ) H 2 O → ( a 2 + b 8 − c 4 − 3 8 d ) C H 4 + ( a 2 − b 8 + c 4 + 3 8 d ) C O 2 + d N H 3"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characteristics of algal biomass,"3.1 Characteristics of algal biomass Table 1 presents the characteristics of L. digitata and A. platensis biomass. The macro-algae L. digitata was harvested from natural environments in shallow coastal waters, resulting in a lower VS/TS ratio as compared to the artificially cultivated micro-algae A. platensis which avoided the significant salt accumulation from seawater. The harvest timing of September coincided with the peak carbohydrate accumulation in L. digitata biomass [5], leading to a high C/N ratio of 26.47. By contrast, the rich proteins in A. platensis contributed to the high nitrogen content. This also provided the possibility of mixing the two algal substrates at an appropriate C/N ratio of 20. Moreover, A. platensis biomass exhibited higher energy content and theoretical biomethane potential on the basis of elemental composition, despite potential antagonistic effects of recalcitrant organic components on the biodegradability [27]. L. digitata biomass is rich in carbohydrates, which generate 20 times higher hydrogen-producing potential than proteins and lipids [40] and as such serve as the major components utilised by the AFB for biohydrogen production. A. platensis is rich in proteins and can supply essential nitrogen sources for the anaerobes in both H2 and CH4 reactors to maintain effective metabolism [29]. The lipid contents are relatively low in both algal species and are not readily utilised by the AFB for hydrogen production. The lipids, however, can be slowly degraded and further converted to biomethane in the second-stage anaerobic digestion with a longer retention time [22]."
9,Batch biohydrogen and biomethane potential tests,"3.2 Batch biohydrogen and biomethane potential tests After the sequential 4-day BHP and 26-day BMP tests using the mixed L. digitata and A. platensis biomass, a BHP yield of 94.6 mL H2/gVS and a BMP yield of 309.3 mL CH4/gVS were recorded (Fig. 2 ). The BHP yield exceeds the result (60.5 mL H2/gVS) obtained in a previous study using algal mixture of L. digitata and A. platensis at a C/N ratio of 16.5 [29], indicating the C/N ratio of 20 is preferred during the batch hydrogen fermentation of this specific algal mixture. Moreover, the BHP yield is close to the findings (94.5–97.0 mL H2/gVS) of our previous study on batch hydrogen co-fermentation of macro-algae (L. digitata) and micro-algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Nannochloropsis oceanica). After hydrogen fermentation, the VFA compositions in the hydrogenogenic effluent were as follows: 0.64 g/L of acetic acid, 0.02 g/L of propionic acid, 0.02 g/L of isobutyric acid, 0.97 g/L of butyric acid, 0.03 g/L of isovaleric acid, and 0.01 g/L of valeric acid. The acetic and butyric acids accounted for 95.1% of the total VFAs, indicating that the predominant metabolic pathways of the AFB during hydrogen fermentation were acetic and butyric routes [22]. As shown in Fig. 2b during subsequent BMP test, the soluble VFAs that are readily utilised by methanogens contributed to the first peak of biomethane production rate at 3rd day, whereas the solid remnants continued to be hydrolysed and resulted in the second peak of biomethane production rate at 11th day. The BMP yield matches that from the one-stage batch anaerobic co-digestion of L. digitata and A. platensis (311.5 mL CH4/gVS) achieved by Ref. [27]. Although no significant enhancement of BMP yield was obtained, the two-stage batch co-fermentation of L. digitata and A. platensis secured an overall energy yield of 12.1 kJ/gVS that is 8.5% higher than that from the one-stage biomethane production [27]."
10,Continuous fermentation performances with increasing OLRs,"3.3 Continuous fermentation performances with increasing OLRs The performance characteristics of all four reactors of the two-stage and one-stage systems over increasing OLRs are summarised in Table 2 . The first HRT at each OLR in each reactor was deemed as the acclimatisation period for anaerobic microbes, thus the data in Table 2 are displayed as mean values over the post-first HRT duration of each OLR. Throughout the entire experiment, the TAN concentrations of all CH4 reactors stayed low, indicating that no ammonia inhibition occurred. 3.3.1 Performance of H2 reactor Fig. 3 shows the SHYs of the H2 reactor with increasing OLRs; Fig 4 a shows the compositions of VFAs. At the initial OLR of 3.0 gVS/L/d, the SHYs were quite limited. However, the acidification yield reached 87.5%, indicating a large portion of mixed L. digitata and A. platensis were utilised by the AFB to maintain basic metabolisms. Thus, the low mean SHY (14.3 mL/gVS) and the high acidification yield at this low OLR indicated that the AFB in H2 reactor were underfed to some extent. When the OLR increased from 3.0 to 6.0 gVS/L/d, the SHYs drastically increased. Although the SHYs fluctuated between 40.5 and 72.0 mL/gVS over this OLR, an average of 55.3 mL/gVS was achieved, which equates to 58.5% of the BHP yield in the batch trial. As the sCOD of 14.2 g/L at this OLR (6.0 gVS/L/d) was over 2-fold of that (7.0 g/L) at the initial OLR (3.0 gVS/L/d), it could be assumed that the hydrolysis of mixed algal substrates was even a little bit more efficient. The tVFA also increased to 5254 mg/L, corresponding to an acidification yield of 63.0%. Similarly, the salinity increased by 55.6%, illustrating that this OLR provided excessive biomass supply for the basic metabolisms of AFB and hence more algal substrates were degraded and utilised for hydrogen production. When the OLR was further lifted from 6.0 to 9.0 gVS/L/d, a sharp drop in hydrogen production was recorded. The mean SHY of 20.4 mL/gVS was 63.1% lower than that at the OLR of 6.0 gVS/L/d. This result was attributed to the accumulation of large quantities of VFAs that inhibited the hydrogen-producing pathways of AFB in the H2 reactor. The increased loading of algal substrates resulted in sCOD and tVFA values higher by 29.6% and 26.1% in the liquid phase, respectively, whereas the remaining VS in the H2 reactor (at 9.0 gVS/L/d) increased by 57.5%. As the increase in remaining VS exceeded the increase in sCOD and tVFA, it was assumed that H2 reactor was overfed, and hydrolysis and acidification of loaded algal substrates were limited to some extent. With the OLR further rising to 12.0 gVS/L/d, the average SHY marginally declined to 19.0 mL/gVS. Although the sCOD slightly increased, the tVFA unexpectedly decreased a little bit, leading to a lower acidification yield as compared to that at the OLR of 9.0 gVS/L/d. This also indicated that more algal substrates were fermented through ethanol and lactic acid producing pathways. This was probably ascribed to the enhanced fluctuations of pH values at higher OLRs. With the loading increasing, soluble acidic metabolites accumulated and hence the pH drop became more severe between each feed. The lower pH facilitated the shift of acetic and butyric routes to ethanol and lactic acid producing pathways in the H2 reactor [24,32,41]. These results suggested that the optimum OLR for continuous biohydrogen production through co-fermentation of macro-algae L. digitata and micro-algae A. platensis was 6.0 gVS/L/d in the H2 reactor. The insufficient biomass supply at lower OLR failed to provide essential feedstock for the AFB to produce hydrogen, whereas the overfeeding of algae at higher OLRs resulted in the accumulation of VFAs which in turn suppressed the hydrogen-producing metabolisms. 3.3.2 Performance of CH4 reactors A and B The SMYs of CH4 reactors A and B of the two-stage system and the variation trends of tVFA and FOS/TAC values over increasing OLRs are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 5 , respectively. At the initial OLR of 1.0 gVS/L/d, CH4 reactor A performed best with an average SMY of 265.5 mL/gVS which accounted for 85.8% of the BMP value in the batch trial. The sCOD and tVFA were low at 0.6 g/L and 354 mg/L, respectively, indicating that most of the soluble metabolites produced via first-stage dark hydrogen fermentation were utilised by the microbes in CH4 reactor A. The FOS/TAC value was low (0.22) as well. When the OLR increased to 2.0 gVS/L/d, the average SMY slightly decreased to 245.0 mL/gVS, signifying 79.2% of the BMP yield. The low FOS/TAC value of 0.17 ensured the process stability of second-stage anaerobic digestion. Under the conditions of higher sCOD and tVFA inputs from effluents of the H2 reactor, the sCOD and tVFA values of CH4 reactor A remained almost as low as those at the previous OLR of 1.0 gVS/L/d, resulting in even higher sCOD and tVFA destruction efficiencies (93.7% and 93.3%, respectively). The continuous increase of OLR from 2.0 to 3.0 gVS/L/d further led to a 9.4% drop in SMY. Although the FOS/TAC value remained within a suitable range, both the VFAs and sCOD increased. The average tVFA value of 877 mg/L was not high, however, the variation trend shown in Fig. 5 implied that the accumulation of VFAs was in progress. Especially as shown in Fig. 4b, the content of propionic acid in CH4 reactor A significantly increased at 3.0 gVS/L/d as compared to the lower loading rates. The accumulation of propionic acid in the digester is always deemed as an indicator of impending anaerobic digestion failure [42,43]. At the maximum OLR of 4.0 gVS/L/d, a notable reduction in SMY was recorded: the SMY of 174.0 mL/gVS was lower than that at 3.0 gVS/L/d by 24.1% and only equivalent to 65.5% of the highest one obtained at 1.0 gVS/L/d. The sCOD and tVFA further accumulated in CH4 reactor A. The average FOS/TAC value increased to 0.27 and the variation trend shown in Fig. 5 suggested that the FOS/TAC of CH4 reactor A was rising towards the threshold value. Fig. 4b shows that the propionic acid concentration further increased to 775 mg/L and almost all the iso-acids were higher, illustrating that the process instability of CH4 reactor A caused by the overloading of mixed algal biomass was in progress [42]. The struggling of CH4 reactor A at higher OLRs could be associated with the inability of the microbial community to acclimatise to such a high loading in a short HRT of 12 days. This may have resulted in washout of microbial community. Since CH4 reactors A and B shared the same feedstock origin (effluent from H2 reactor), the 2-fold HRT of CH4 reactor B led to lower OLRs which equates to half of those of CH4 reactor A. The FOS/TAC values remained low (0.17–0.19) throughout the entire continuous experiments, indicating that a more stable second-stage anaerobic digestion process was ensured by the longer HRT and lower OLRs of CH4 reactor B as compared to CH4 reactor A. Although the SMYs were marginally lower than the highest one obtained in CH4 reactor A, the average values in CH4 reactor B were less affected by the increasing OLR from 0.5 to 2.0 gVS/L/d and remained within a reasonable range of 223.8–242.5 mL/gVS signifying 72.4–78.4% of the BMP value and 46.7–50.6% of the theoretical methane yield. The sCOD and tVFA stayed low over increasing OLRs, leading to the high sCOD (88.6–95.1%) and tVFA (92.2–95.6%) destruction efficiencies. However, the highest average sCOD (2.2 g/L) and tVFA (551 mg/L) recorded at the maximum OLR of 2.0 gVS/L/d were both higher than those in CH4 reactor A at the same OLR. This was caused by the feedstock sourced from the effluent of the H2 reactor at various OLRs. At an OLR of 2.0 gVS/L/d, the feedstock loaded into CH4 reactor B was obtained from the effluent of the H2 reactor at an OLR of 12.0 gVS/L/d, whilst the one loaded into CH4 reactor A was originated from the effluent of the H2 reactor at an OLR of 6.0 gVS/L/d. The sCOD and tVFA values of the former were markedly higher than the latter, resulting in a comparatively more severe impact on the second-stage anaerobic digestion process. Nonetheless, Fig. 4c reveals that no accumulation of propionic acid or iso-acids in CH4 reactor B were observed at an OLR of 2.0 gVS/L/d, demonstrating that no inhibition of methanogens or anaerobic digestion process failure was evident. Overall, considering SMY, treating capacity, and process stability, an OLR of 2.0 gVS/L/d was shown to be optimal for CH4 reactor A at a fixed HRT of 12 days. 3.3.3 Performance of CH4 reactor C The SMYs of CH4 reactor C of the one-stage system are shown in Fig. 3. With the OLR increasing from 1.0 to 3.0 gVS/L/d, the average SMYs gradually decreased from 204.5 to 72.2 mL/gVS. As shown in Fig. 5, the VFAs accumulated and the FOS/TAC values rose along with the increasing OLR, indicating that the buffer capacity in the CH4 reactor C was strongly negatively correlated with OLR in this one-stage system. At the initial OLR of 1.0 gVS/L/d, the tVFA already reached 1287 mg/L and the VFA composition in Fig. 4d revealed that propionic acid accounted for 65.6% of the tVFA. This phenomenon of propionic acid accumulation was similar to that obtained in the CH4 reactor A at the maximum OLR of 4.0 gVS/L/d, signifying that the process instability of one-stage anaerobic co-digestion was triggered. When the OLR rose to 2.0 gVS/L/d, a remarkable surge in VFAs was noted: the tVFA concentration of 6593 mg/L was even close to that in the H2 reactor at 9.0 gVS/L/d. It was assumed that the methanogens in CH4 reactor C suffered severe inhibition under such acidic condition. When the OLR further increased to 3.0 gVS/L/d, the sCOD increased by 110.7%, whereas the tVFA slightly decreased instead, indicating that the acidification process was impaired even though the hydrolysis was efficient. In addition, the enhancements of propionic, butyric, and longer-chain acids and little accumulation of acetic acid were recorded in Fig. 4d. These results suggested that the microbial community was highly affected: the activities of acetogens and methanogens were inhibited to a great extent. Furthermore, the salinity in CH4 reactor C amounted to 13.3 g/kg, which was far higher than the highest ones obtained in CH4 reactors A and B during the entire experiment. Although small concentrations of sodium ions (100–350 mg/L) are supposed to be essential for the maintenance of healthy metabolism of the microbes in anaerobic digesters [44], the enhanced osmotic pressure caused by the remarkably high salinity can inhibit microbial activity and even lead to dehydration of microbes [23]. Luo et al. [45] investigated the effects of saline adaptation on anaerobic digestion of sludge and observed that salinity levels higher than 8.7 g/kg impaired the methane production. On the other hand, Tabassum et al. [46] demonstrated acclimatisation to salinity levels of the order of 14 g/L in mono-digestion of farm cultivated S. latissima at an OLR of 4.0 kgVS/m3/d. The high salinity level recorded here of 13.3 g/kg at an OLR of 3.0 gVS/L/d will have some inhibitory effects on the microbial consortium in CH4 reactor C. Although the gas production did not thoroughly stop, the failure of CH4 reactor C was inevitable. In a previous study [27], Herrmann et al. conducted continuous one-stage anaerobic co-digestion of L. digitata and A. platensis based on a C/N ratio of 25 at a long HRT of 28 days. A high OLR of 4.0 gVS/L/d was shown to be tolerable for the CH4 reactor and an SMY of 259.6 mL/gVS was recorded. Despite the different seed inocula and minor variation in C/N ratios, the significant reduction in HRT (28 days as compared to 16 days here) was assumed to be the key influencing factor between these two one-stage systems. It is suggested that an HRT of 16 days did not supply sufficient time for acclimatisation and enrichment of the microbial consortium in the CH4 reactor C and led to washout of microbes, accumulation of VFAs, and inhibition of methanogenesis."
11,Comparisons between two-stage and one-stage fermentation performances,"3.4 Comparisons between two-stage and one-stage fermentation performances The two-stage system comprising of the H2 reactor and the CH4 reactor A and the one-stage system of CH4 reactor C shared comparable operational parameters such as overall HRT (16 days), OLR, temperature (37 ± 1 °C), and initial seed inoculum for methane production. At an OLR of 6.0 gVS/L/d, the highest average SHY of 55.3 mL/gVS, which equates to 58.5% of the BHP yield in batch trail, was obtained in the first-stage dark hydrogen fermentation. In the second-stage anaerobic digestion, the average SMY of 245.0 mL/gVS equivalent to 79.2% of the BMP value was achieved in CH4 reactor A at a corresponding OLR of 2.0 gVS/L/d, and process stability was secured. The two-stage system effected an energy yield of 9.4 kJ/gVS and the ECE amounted to 51.0%. The energy yield of the continuous two-stage system was 22.3% lower than the batch trial. This is expected due to the disadvantages of shorter retention time (16 days in two-stage versus 30 days for batch) and the larger reactor with less efficient mixing conditions. By contrast, in the one-stage system, the CH4 reactor C recorded its highest SMY of only 204.5 mL/gVS at the initial OLR of 1.0 gVS/L/d. The energy yield and ECE were lower at 7.3 kJ/gVS and 39.8%, respectively. Even at this low OLR, a certain degree of VFA accumulation was observed. When the OLR rose to 3.0 gVS/L/d, the process instability of one-stage anaerobic co-digestion of L. digitata and A. platensis became more obvious. Therefore, the two-stage system prevailed in both energy production from mixed algal feedstock and treating capacity as compared to one-stage system at a fixed HRT of 16 days. Even if the energy content in produced hydrogen was nearly negligible, the first-stage dark hydrogen fermentation would serve as an optimised hydrolysis and acidification method pretreating the mixed algal feedstock. Similar results were reported by Refs. [26,32] utilising grass and food waste in continuous two-stage systems. To sum up, the technical feasibility of two-stage co-fermentation of L. digitata and A. platensis biomass has been proven, and several operational parameters have been assessed via this 32-week long experimentation, thus mitigating the gaps between the fundamental innovations obtained by the small-scale batch co-fermentation and the potential commercial deployment of algal biofuel systems in future. Although positive results on two-stage continuous hydrogen and methane co-production using mixed L. digitata and A. platensis have been achieved in this study, some issues are still noteworthy. The C/N ratio was adjusted to 20 in the mixture of macro- and micro-algae, however, the TAN levels stayed low in all four reactors throughout the entire continuous experiment, indicating that the hydrolysis or degradation of nitrogen-rich micro-algae biomass may have been somewhat limited, especially in a short HRT of 16 days. This was probably ascribed to limited degradation of untreated A. platensis due to its recalcitrant cell wall structures. The slow or limited utilisation of micro-algae biomass further restricted the fermentation/digestion process and also explained why the longer HRT in CH4 reactor B and in the previous study [27] could ensure a more stable process. Therefore, to overcome this drawback, pretreatment of micro-algae and even macro-algae to facilitate the solubilisation and hydrolysis of feedstock is a promising option for a stable continuous fermentation/digestion process in future study."
12,Comparison between results of this study and relevant literature,"3.5 Comparison between results of this study and relevant literature To the best of our knowledge, most of the studies on biohydrogen and biomethane production from either macro- or micro-algae biomass were conducted in batch trials [23,30]. The data on long term continuous fermentation of algae are relatively limited. A comparison between the results of continuous fermentative gaseous biofuel production from algal biomass and other co-substrates in this study and the state of the art in the literature is summarised in Table 3 . Tabassum et al. [46] found that a mixed feedstock of 66.6% macro-algae (L. digitata or S. latissima) and 33.3% dairy slurry was optimal to obtain a maximum biomethane production efficiency during continuous anaerobic co-digestion. The energy yields (9.0–9.3 kJ/gVS) were close to that obtained in this study. Allen et al. [47] suggested for the green macro-algae (Ulva lactuca) that the optimal mixture in long term continuous digestion would be 25% macro-algae and 75% dairy slurry; this resulted in an SMY of 170 mL/gVS, equivalent to 95% of the BMP value. These differences are attributed to the significant variation in biological characteristics of different macro-algal species. The green seaweed U. lactuca typically has a C/N ratio below 10 and as such needs to be co-digested with a carbohydrate-rich co-substrate to increase the C/N ratio for better digestibility. The carbohydrate-rich brown seaweeds L. digitata and S. latissima have high C/N ratios (>25) when they are ripest in late summer [46]. Similarly, the protein-rich Taihu blue algae with a low C/N ratio of 6.1 resulted in an SMY of 160 mL/gVS, whereas the mixture of Taihu blue algae and carbohydrate-rich corn straw with a C/N ratio of 20 resulted in an increase in SMY of 46% [48]. Herrmann et al. [27] also used micro-algae A. platensis as a nitrogen-rich additive to macro-algae L. digitata for adjusting the C/N to 25. Compared with the results obtained in the one-stage reactor in this study, the longer HRT (28 days) allowed a higher OLR (4.0 gVS/L/d) with a stable process and a higher SMY. All the above studies were conducted in a one-stage system; only one previous study investigated two-stage continuous fermentation of macro-algae L. digitata [49]. The two-stage fermentation system outperformed one-stage system with a higher energy yield in a shorter overall HRT [49]. This finding was consistent with the output of this study. The optimal HRT, OLR, and biofuel yield varied between the studies due to different experimental configurations, different sources of inocula, and different algal feedstocks. However, the results showed similarities in C/N ratios, and the improvements in energy return and process stability."
13,Gross energy potential from algal mixture,"3.6 Gross energy potential from algal mixture In this study, the major component in the algal mixture is macro-algae L. digitata, which accounts for 94% of the VS. The co-substrate micro-algae may be considered as a nitrogen-rich additive. Therefore, the gross energy potential from this mixed algal feedstock is heavily associated with the L. digitata biomass resource. Nonetheless, the definite data on the annual yields of seaweed per hectare are not available because of a series of variations, such as algal species, locations, harvesting times, etc [44]. According to a latest report of International Energy Agency Bioenergy, the yields of L. digitata cultivated using advanced textiles in open sea reached 16 kg/m2, equivalent to 160 tons wet weight per hectare per year (t wwt/ha/yr) [50]. Under this scenario, based on the energy yield of 9.4 kJ/gVS in the two-stage continuous co-fermentation system, the gross energy potential is calculated to be 213 GJ/ha/yr. This value is comparable with the gross energy yields of biomethane from terrestrial crops, such as maize (217 GJ/ha/yr), fodder beet (250 GJ/ha/yr), and grass (163 GJ/ha/yr) [51]. The advantages of algae cultivation, are that as an advanced third generation biofuel there is no requirement for arable land, the fuel is outside the food-or-fuel debate, and it is an attractive process for countries with long coastlines [44]. For example, in China, Shandong Province is one of the biggest mariculture bases, and macro-algae is one of the major products [52]. Meanwhile, a modern micro-algae cultivation plant equipped with large raceway ponds has been constructed in Penglai City, Shandong Province. Seawater is used as basic culture solution, and flue gas from a coal-fired power plant is used as the CO2 source [53,54]. These examples in the literature indicate that both macro-algae and micro-algae can be grown in the same place, making the combined use of the macro- and micro-algae reasonable and feasible. In addition, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (coupling seaweed production with fish farms) captures nutrients from fish excrement enhancing seaweed growth and water quality [5], and leading to promotion of industrial scale advanced gaseous biofuel production from algal biomass."
14,Conclusions,"A continuous two-stage system involving dark hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic fermentation of mixed macro-algae and micro-algae at a C/N ratio of 20 was shown to be feasible with an overall ECE of 51.0%. The short HRT (16 days) allowed an efficient fermentation process in the H2 reactor at 6.0 gVS/L/d and a stable digestion process in the CH4 reactor at a corresponding OLR of 2.0 gVS/L/d. In contrast to the one-stage system, the first-stage dark hydrogen fermentation in the two-stage system optimised hydrolysis and acidification of algal mixtures, hence facilitating improved methane production and process stability in second-stage anaerobic digestion. The gross energy potential of 213 GJ/ha/yr makes this algal mixture comparable with terrestrial crops in gaseous biofuel production while removing any land use implications."
