0,Introduction,"Red mud is the main residue generated during the Bayer process of alumina extraction from bauxite [25]. Nearly 100% of the total red mud (RM) produced worldwide since 1890 (when the Bayer process started industrially) has been stored, accumulating more than 3 Bt of this hazardous waste. Low value applications have been found for the RM, i.e. road making, land reclamation, cement and ceramic production [36]. However, the composition of RM confers this material a potential of being useful in a variety of chemical applications. RM is mainly composed of Fe, Al, Si, Ti, Na, Ca and Mg oxides [2], which enables its use in metal recovery [28], adsorption of organic contaminants in water [17,21,61], adsorption of heavy metals in contaminated soils [16,20], CO2 capture [48,53], Cr(VI) reduction [10], ammonia decomposition [32] and polymers addition [18]. RM has also been tested in catalytic applications [23], such as in the hydrogenation of toluene [42], tetrachlorethylene [39] and polycyclic aromatic compounds, i.e. anthracene oil [63], naphthalene [44], phenanthrene and pyrene [14]. Moreover, RM has been studied in oxidation reactions of organic compounds, such as methane, chlorinated hydrocarbons [19], waste plastics [29,65] and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [26]. Red mud is not often applied in its pure form, especially due to the high alkalinity, partial solubility in water and possible presence of heavy metals [49]. In most applications, RM is used after neutralization and/or acid treatment [4,17,48,53,61]. Few works show the application of red mud as support for metal catalysts, i.e. Ni/RM [7] or Ru/RM [32] for ammonia decomposition, Co/RM for phenol oxidation [31,51] and MgCl2/RM for color removal of dye wastewater [62]. Coating of red mud with carbon has shown to be an important alternative to reduce leaching and alkalinity of this waste [12,35]. Some papers report the coating of red mud by different carbon structures, such as carbon nanotubes [13], and using different carbon sources, e.g. carbon from coal gangue [3], carbon of associated natural gas [60], carbon obtained by catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [45] and carbon from methane decomposition [58]. The main advantage of using red mud as catalyst support is the application of an industrial useless residue produced in large scale with rich chemical composition. During the synthesis of the supports, large particles of iron oxy-hydroxides present in red mud are reduced to form large Fe0 particles, which are responsible for the magnetic properties of the catalysts. More dispersed iron is found on the Si, Ti and Al oxides likely formed by solubilization and reprecipitation during the Bayer process. These small iron oxy-hydroxides are reduced to Fe0 nuclei that are able to catalyze the CVD reaction for the formation of high surface area carbon structures on the surface of the catalyst [37,59]. The oxidation of alcohols is considered an important process in organic synthesis due to the high industrial relevance of the carbonyl compounds produced. Many commercial processes use stoichiometric oxidants, such as chromates, permanganates or peroxides, thus generating large amounts of environmentally dangerous co-products. In this context, the development of catalytic processes that involve molecular oxygen as a final oxidant is an extremely important issue in catalysis science. Although a number of catalytic systems based on transition metals have been successfully applied in the oxidation of alcohols by molecular oxygen [5,6,30,46,52,55,64,66], gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) remain among the most promising catalysts for these reactions [1,3,15,27,43,54]. Supported AuNPs usually show a remarkable catalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and excellent selectivity for carbonyl compounds. Moreover, some of these catalysts have demonstrated a unique ability to promote the direct oxidative esterification of alcohols in methanol solutions [11,24,33,38,41,47,56]. In these systems, the alcohol oxidation and the subsequent oxidation of primarily formed aldehydes are connected in an effective tandem catalytic process to give corresponding methyl esters, compounds with many practical applications such as solvents, extractants or diluents. The activity of gold as catalyst is known to be strongly depended on the interaction of AuNPs with the support and therefore on the support nature. Various solid materials have been applied to stabilize AuNPs; however, in spite of important progress, a search for efficient and collaborating supports for the use of AuNPs in oxidation reactions remains to be of a crucial importance. In the present work, AuNPs supported on the modified red mud materials, i.e. reduced by H2 or coated with carbon through the reduction with ethanol, were prepared and their catalytic performance in the liquid-phase aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol was studied, for the first time as far as we know."
1,Material and methods,
2,Synthesis of supports and catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of supports and catalysts Two different supports based on red mud residue were produced, denominated as RMH and RMC. The raw RM suspension (ALCAN) was first washed with milli-Q water and dried in the oven at 80°C. RMH support was produced via reduction with hydrogen, and RMC by CVD (chemical vapor deposition) reaction of RM with ethanol as carbon source. Both processes took place in similar conditions, i.e. 100mg of RM placed in horizontal oven and heated to 700°C (heating rate of 10°Cmin−1) under flow of the reactant mixture (50mLmin−1). The final temperature was kept over 3h before cooling down. The reactant mixtures used were 15% H2 in N2 and 15% ethanol in N2, respectively for reduction and CVD reactions. The red mud based supports were impregnated with Au(en)2Cl3. Au(en)2Cl3 was synthesized as follows: HAuCl4·3H2O (100mg) was dissolved in Milli-Q water (1mL) under magnetic stirring. Then, ethylenediamine (45μL) and ethanol (7mL) were added to the solution. After 20min stirring at room temperature, Au(en)2Cl3 was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and dried under vacuum at room temperature. The cationic gold ethylenediamine complex Au(en)2 3+ was adopted here as the gold source in despite of the anionic chloroauric complex of AuCl4 − in order to increase the attachment and distribution of gold nanoparticles by adsortive process, mainly onto the electron rich surface of the carbon filaments. The use of gold complexes in similar procedures is well described in the literature, as reported by Corma et al. [9]. The catalysts were produced from Au(en)2Cl3 (10.8mg) and the corresponding support (RMH or RMC, 500mg), with their amounts being calculated to obtain the materials with approximately 1wt% of Au. Prepared gold catalysts were named as RMH-Au or RMC-Au, respectively. The mixture of Au(en)2Cl3 and the support with Milli-Q water (ca. 150mL) was heated at 70°C to allow the complete and slow evaporation of water favoring the better dispersion of the gold catalyst on the support surface. The mixture was finally dried under vacuum at room temperature and at 65°C in an oven for more than 12h. The powder obtained was heated to 300°C and kept at this temperature for 2h under nitrogen atmosphere."
3,Characterization of the catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of the catalysts The catalysts synthesized were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD – Rigaku Geigerflex equipment using Co Kα radiation from 10 to 80° (2θ) at 4°min−1), Mössbauer spectroscopy (CMTE – MA250 spectrometer using 57Co/Rh source at room temperature and α-Fe as reference), elemental analysis CHN (Perkin-Elmer analyzer), atomic absorption spectrometry (AA – Hitachi-Z8200 spectrometer), transmission electron microscopy – TEM (microscope Tecnai G2 200kV – SEI) and EDS microanalysis (JEOL JXA-8900 RL at 15kV)."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests The reactions were carried out in a stainless steel 10mL autoclave with magnetic stirring. A mixture of benzyl alcohol (2.5mmol), methanol (2mL), K2CO3 (if any) and the catalyst (30.0mg, 1.5μmol of Au, 0.06mol% with respect to the substrate) was inserted in the reactor. The autoclave was pressurized with oxygen to 10atm and heated to 130°C in an oil bath under stirring. The reactions were followed by gas chromatography (GC – Shimadzu QP2010-Plus equipment using a Carbowax 20M capillary column). The reactions were monitored over time by the analysis of small aliquots diluted 25 times with methanol analyzed by chromatography. The reaction products were identified by GC–MS on a Shimadzu QP2010-Plus equipment using 70eV."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Synthesis of supports and catalysts,"3.1 Synthesis of supports and catalysts The red mud based gold catalysts RMH-Au and RMC-Au were prepared with the RM reduced with H2 and with ethanol, respectively. The reduction with ethanol promotes a partially coating of the RM with carbon. Pure red mud was modified before application in order to overcome its limitations, such as: (i) leaching, (ii) low specific surface area and (iii) no magnetism. The supports produced with the modified red mud are magnetic and less subjected to leaching in a contact with a liquid phase. Moreover, RM partially coated with C (after CVD with ethanol) presents a higher surface area. The catalysts RMH-Au and RMC-Au were characterized by different techniques that provided information about their structure, morphology and composition, especially about gold, iron and carbon."
7,Characterization of the catalysts,"3.2 Characterization of the catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied in the study of the crystalline phases formed during the synthesis. No peaks related to metallic Au are observed in the XRD patterns, likely due to the low Au content and high dispersion on the support. Only reflection peaks characteristic of the modified RM matrix could be observed. TEM images were obtained in order to better characterize the gold nanoparticles supported on different red mud based supports (Fig. 1 ). The TEM images of the RMH-Au catalyst (Fig. 1) show gold nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of the reduced red mud. In the RMC-Au composite, it is clear the presence of carbon nanofilaments. The Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) seem to be dispersed all over the filaments surface. It is possible to observe based on the TEM images (Fig. 1) that the size of the Au nanoparticles supported on RMH is greater than that of the Au nanoparticles supported on RMC. To confirm this observation, the average size of the Au nanoparticles in both catalysts was determined using the ImageJ software, which gave the values of 11 and 9nm for RMH-Au and RMC-Au, respectively. The size distribution of the gold nanoparticles on RMH-Au and RMC-Au catalysts is shown on Fig. 2 . The characterization results from Mössbauer spectroscopy, CHN elemental analysis and average Au particle size obtained from TEM are summarized in Table 1 and discussed in detail in the Supplementary material. Fe3+ and Fe2+ phases were identified by Mössbauer spectroscopy in both catalysts (hyperfine parameters, Table S1). Based on the parameters obtained, the iron phases were identified as iron silicate, according to Karimi and co-workers study [22]. This determination enforces the observation that these phases remain stable during the reduction stage of the catalysts synthesis. The analysis of the pure red mud have shown the same Fe3+ and Fe2+ phases, confirming that the iron silicates are not produced during the synthesis of the catalysts, but are already present in the original red mud residue. Moreover, the RMH-Au catalyst contains mainly metallic iron (α,γ-Fe, 59%) while RMC-Au contains magnetite (Fe3O4, 34%), iron carbide (Fe3C, 28%) and metallic iron (α,γ-Fe, 7%) as main iron phases. Pure red mud does not contain carbon in its composition, so as well as the catalyst RMH-Au. As the RMC-Au sample is produced via the CVD reaction of the red mud and ethanol, this catalyst is partially coated by carbon (42%). The surface area of pure RM is 24m2 g−1, as determined by the N2 adsorption/desorption technique using the BET method. It is observed that RMH presents lower specific surface area (16m2 g−1) than pure RM [34], what can be explained by the sintering of RM oxides at high temperatures. According to Paredes et al., Na2O and CaO contained in the RM are very susceptible to the sintering process [40]. On the other hand, RMC support presents greater specific surface area than RM and RMH (54m2 g−1) [34] due to the presence of carbon nanofilaments formed under the CVD process, as shown in the TEM images of Fig. 1. The RMH-Au and RMC-Au samples were also analyzed by EDS analysis. The spectra obtained are shown in Fig. 3 . The peaks characteristic of Au can be seen in both EDS spectra (Fig. 3), thus confirming the presence of gold in the catalysts. Other peaks are typical for the RM elemental composition, such as those of O, Fe, Si, Ca, Ti and Al [51]. Since EDS analysis was not quantitative, it was not possible to infer the amount of each element in the composition of the catalysts based only on its data."
8,Catalytic tests,"3.3 Catalytic tests The catalytic activity of the RMH-Au and RMC-Au catalysts was tested in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (1) with molecular oxygen in methanol and toluene solutions. The results are presented in Table 2 . The reaction times given in Table 2 were chosen to facilitate a comparison between the runs. In methanol, both materials promoted the oxidation and oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol in the absence of any co-catalysts or additives (Table 2, runs 1 and 2). The main reaction products obtained are benzaldehyde 2 (ca. 90%) and methyl benzoate 3 (Scheme 1 ). The combined selectivity for these products was 95–97% in both runs. Benzoic acid and benzyl benzoate were also detected but in very low concentrations. The pure supports, in the absence of Au nanoparticles, do not promote the reaction. The first reaction step is the oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, which can undergo a consequent oxidation to give benzoic acid derivatives. The formation of esters, methyl benzoate 3 and benzyl benzoate, can be formally rationalized as the esterification of benzoic acid with methanol and benzyl alcohol, respectively. However, it is currently accepted that the key intermediates of the process are hemiacetals formed by the benzaldehyde condensation with benzyl alcohol or methanol (Scheme 2 ) [8,33,50,57]. The corresponding esters arise from the gold promoted dehydrogenation of the hemiacetals. The conversion of benzyl alcohol occurred faster with RMC-Au than with RMH-Au. Turnover numbers (TON) and turnover frequencies (TOF) presented in Table 2 were calculated with respect to the total amount of gold in the catalyst. The reactions occurred with very low catalyst loadings (ca. 0.06%mol of Au with respect to the substrate) so that the turnover number reached high values of over one thousand reflecting the high stability of the catalyst. The addition of base (K2CO3) in sub-stoichiometric amounts (0.16equiv.) significantly accelerated the reaction over both catalysts because the first abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate occurs easily, but it did not change the product distribution (Table 2, runs 3 and 4). RMC-Au was more efficient for the oxidation of benzaldehyde into methyl benzoate than RMH-Au; however, benzaldehyde remained a major reaction product with both materials even in the presence of base. It is noteworthy a poor performance of the gold catalysts based on red mud in the oxidation of benzaldehyde, differently from AuNPs supported on silica, magnesium oxide and ceria-alumina mixed oxides reported in our previous works [11,41,56]. The reason for such a strong effect of the support nature on the reactivity of AuNPs in the oxidation of benzaldehyde could be the difference in the affinity of the support towards benzaldehyde, which should be adsorbed on the surface before the dehydrogenation step, and/or the difference in the capacity of the support to promote the acetalization of the aldehyde to give hemiacetals, assumed as key intermediates on the way to benzoic acid derivatives (Scheme 2). In special experiments, using benzaldehyde as the substrate instead of benzyl alcohol under the conditions of runs 3 and 4, both catalysts demonstrated quite low activity with only 20–30% of benzaldehyde being converted after 10h reaction (not shown in Table 2). In the run with RMC-Au, the main reaction product was methyl benzoate 3 (98% selectivity), whereas RMH-Au promoted less selective oxidation resulting in methyl benzoate with ca. 50% selectivity along with several non-identified products. Thus, gold catalysts based on RM are more efficient for the oxidation of alcohols than for the oxidation of aldehydes. The difference in the catalytic activity of AuNPs supported on the RM reduced with hydrogen, RMH, and carbon coated red mud, RMC, became even more significant when the reactions were performed in toluene solutions. In toluene, the activity of RMC-Au was nearly two times higher than that of RMH-Au (Table 2, runs 5 and 6 vs. runs 3 and 4). Probably, carbon coating allows better dispersion of the solid material into the reaction solutions thus making AuNPs surface more accessible for the substrate. The RMC-Au and RMH-Au catalysts, which are solid and magnetic materials insoluble in the reaction mixture, can be recovered magnetically by the simple approximation of a magnet to the walls of the reactor. These features represent the important technological advantages of the process. The RMC-Au catalyst was reused two times after recovering and washing with methanol (Table 2, runs 7 and 8 vs. run 4). No significant changes in selectivity were observed in recycling experiments. The decrease in activity at first recycling can be attributed to mechanical losses of the catalyst during the recovery procedure. TEM images of the spent RMC-Au catalyst (after run 8 in Table 2) showed that AuNPs presented similar aspect compared to the fresh catalyst, with no modification on the surface or morphology of the catalyst being observed (Fig. 4 ). Moreover, EDS microanalysis confirmed that AuNPs remain on the surface of the supports even after consecutive reactions (see Fig. 4). Leaching tests were performed by analysis of the supernatants after the reaction by atomic absorption spectrometry and showed no significant leaching of Fe for both RMH-Au and RMC-Au catalysts, even in the reusing runs. Leaching of Au was very small in both cases and even less important for the RMC-Au catalyst, likely due to the better incorporation of AuNPs on the carbonic surface. In general, leaching data show that no more than 0.4% of the total Au content was leached from RMC-Au and no more than 0.8% was leached from RMH-Au. To further verify the possibility of catalyst leaching, fresh benzyl alcohol was added to the supernatant recovered after the reaction (Table 2, run 4); the solution was placed back in the autoclave and kept under the oxidation conditions. No further conversion was observed which indicated the lack of significant gold leaching to the liquid phase during the process, which was therefore truly heterogeneous."
9,Conclusions,"Gold nanoparticles were supported on different matrixes based on red mud residue: red mud reduced with H2 – RMH-Au, and with ethanol – which promoted partially coating of the RM with carbon – RMC-Au. Characterization results have shown that AuNPs are well dispersed on the surface of the supports with average particle diameter of approximately 10nm. The materials were applied as catalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with molecular oxygen. Coating with carbon allowed better incorporation of AuNPs on the surface of the materials preventing gold and iron leaching and, probably, increased the dispersion of the material into the reaction solutions. AuNPs supported on RM reduced in ethanol and, therefore, coated with carbon showed better catalytic performance than AuNPs supported on RM reduced in hydrogen."
