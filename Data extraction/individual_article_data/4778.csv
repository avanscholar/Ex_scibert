0,Introduction,"Polymer-inorganic hybrid materials are an accessible means because of alerting the properties of polymer matrix without requiring synthesis of a new chemical species. Many types of inorganic fillers have been added to polymer materials with perfect properties. Especially the excellent properties and outstanding application potential of graphene have arouse many researcher's attention in the recent years [1–6]. Many researchers have used graphene family as fillers to improve the properties of polymer matrix, such as graphene oxide (GO) containing -OH and -O- functional groups on the surfaces and -COOH and -CONH3 functional groups on the edges [7–10]. These functional groups render GO hydrophilic and provide compatibility between thermosetting polymers and GO by hydrogen bonding and molecular interactions, leading to the production of various polymer/graphene composites [11–16] possessing excellent properties. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has strong hydrophilicity, superior flexibility, good transparency, and excellent formation of films [17], which finds lots of applications as coatings in the packaging, paper industries, textile and the field of medicine, etc. PVA/filler compositions can be applied in many fields, such as electronics [18,19], dielectrics [20], drug delivery [21], mechanics [22], and water resistance [23]. Among various fillers, PVA shows excellent mechanical and optical properties by the addition of graphitic nanostructure [24–27]. The introduction of graphene also can increase the thermal stability and mechanical properties of PVA [28,29]. Recently, Kalim et al. reported that poly (4-styrenesulfonic acid)/PVA composites have high dielectric properties by adding GO [30]. Liang et al. synthesized the PVA/GO composite and analyzed the effect of the dispersion of GO on the elastic modules of PVA [31]. Ramalingam et al. reported the electrospinning technique for the synthesis of PVA/graphene nanofibers and obtained a high electrical conductivity of 10.7×10−6 Scm−1 of PVA/graphene nanofiber [32]. On the basis of the reported studies, it can be found that most reports have mainly concentrated on the synthesis process and the effect of graphene sheets dispersion on the properties of nanocomposites. However, the effect of GO nanofibers on material properties is rarely reported. Therefore, in this study, graphene nanofibers containing oxygen and nitrogen functional groups are built to address the possibility of preparing composites with high mechanical properties (e.g., the elasticity modulus, the tensile strength, and stretchability etc) by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The influences of functional graphene nanofiber (FGF) with different groups on the mechanical properties of PVA/FGF composites have been explored detailedly at the molecular level. Especially, the mechanical properties of PVA/FGF composites and pure PVA are obtained by two following ways: (1) The Constant strain method of MD simulations is used to estimate Young's modulus, Bulk modulus, Shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio. (2) The stress-strain curve via the Souza-Martins barostat and thermostat (NPT) method is used to investigate the tensile strength and stretchability [33]. Moreover, PVA composites with the different aspect ratios of FGF are built and analyzed about their mechanical properties. In addition, Rg and interaction energy between the PVA and FGF, RDF, and MSD of PVA molecular chains are also calculated and discussed."
1,Models and methods,"In this study, FGF has been employed to improve the mechanical properties of PVA matrix composites. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the different aspect ratios of FGF on the mechanical properties of composites, the models of FGF with aspect ratios of 3×10, 3×20, and 3×30 are also constructed, which are named as FGF10, FGF20, and FGF30, respectively. The models of FGF20 with different functional groups are shown in Fig. 1 . Obviously, the -O-, -OH, -COOH, and -CONH3 functional groups are averagely distributed on the surfaces of graphene nanofiber and at the edges of graphene nanofiber, respectively, where the other parts of the graphene nanofibers are deactivated by the hydrogen atom. For the sake of simplicity, the surface and edge functioned graphene nanofiber with -O-, -OH, and -COOH groups is referred to as SEGC (Fig. 1a) and only the edge functioned graphene nanofiber with -OH and -COOH functional groups is referred to as EGC (Fig. 1b). Similarly, the surface and edge functioned graphene nanofiber with -O-, -OH, and -CONH3 groups is referred to as SEGN (Fig. 1c) and only the edge functioned graphene nanofiber with -OH and -CONH3 groups is referred to as EGN (Fig. 1d). In the modeling process of composites, FGF and PVA (a PVA chain containing 100 monomer units) are randomly placed in a unit cell with 1.27 pristine density, in which the loading of FGF is 2.0wt% in all of the unit cell. As an example of PVA/SEGC composite, the modeling process for PVA/SEGC composite is shown in Fig. 2 . The amorphous cell packing task and the Forcite module in the Materials Studio software package of Accelry have been applied during the whole molecular simulations [34]. The COMPASS force field [35–37] is chose during the molecular simulations. In all cases, an Ewald summation method of the electrostatic interactions and the van der Waals interactions with an accuracy of 1.0×10−4 kcal/mol and a Buffer width of 0.5Å are used during the modeling and subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The Andersen thermostat [38] temperatures (298K) and Berendsen [39] pressure (1.0×105 Pa) control algorithms are used throughout. Before MD simulations, to obtain the reasonable structures of these PVA composites, an geometry optimization and an Anneal task (NVT and NPT, 20 annealing cycles, temperature from 298K to 1000K and back to 298K at 20K intervals) are applied to eliminate the undesirable contacts in the PVA composites. After then a MD simulation (NVT, 500ps) is run to further equilibrate each of modules for data production. Finally, the mechanical properties and uniaxial tensile simulations are performed for the modules for production."
2,Simulation analysis,
3,Rg analysis,"3.1 Rg analysis To estimate the equilibrium of the system and the size of PVA molecular chains in the pure PVA resin and PVA/FGF composites, Rg of PVA molecular chains in the system is calculated. The formula of Rg (1) is as follows [40]: (1) R g = ∑ i m i r i 2 ∑ i m i where m i is the mass of atom i, and r i is the position of atom i with respect to the center of mass of the molecule."
4,Mechanical properties [34],"3.2 Mechanical properties [34] 3.2.1 Elastic modulus calculation The mechanical properties of PVA/FGF composites are calculated by MD simulations to obtain the elastic modulus. On the basis of the generalized Hooke's law, the elastic modulus of PVA/FGF composites are calculated by the following Eq. (2): (2) σ i = C ij ε j where i,j =1, …⋯,6, C is the Voigt matrix representation of the elastic stiffness tensor. Poisson's ratio reflects the elastic constants of transverse deformation of materials, which means the ratio of transverse strain to corresponding longitudinal strain caused by uniformly distributed longitudinal stress within the material's proportional limit. The expression (3) is shown below: (3) v ij = − S ij S ii where S is the elastic compliances of the system. When a uniaxial tension is applied to a material, then the lengthening of the material is measured according to the strain. The ratio of stress to strain defines the value of the Young's modulus for that axis (4): (4) E i = σ i ε i Since a material will always increase in length under tension, the value of this quantity should always be positive. The Young's moduli in each of the Cartesian directions can be calculated from the elastic compliances (5): (5) E i = 1 S ii Given the stiffness matrix of an anisotropic material, it is possible to estimate Bulk modulus and Shear modulus of an anisotropic material according to Voigt, Reuss, and Hill method [40]. The following formulas (6) are the definitions of Voigt and Reuss, and the Hill values are obtained by the average of Voigt and Reuss: (6) K Voigt = 1 9 C 11 + C 22 + C 33 + 2 C 12 + 2 C 13 + 2 C 23 K Re uss = 1 S 11 + S 22 + S 33 + 2 S 12 + 2 S 13 + 2 S 23 G Voigt = 1 15 C 11 + C 22 + C 33 + 2 C 44 + 2 C 55 + 2 C 66 − C 12 − C 13 − C 23 G Re uss = 15 4 S 11 + S 22 + S 33 − S 12 − S 13 − S 23 + 3 S 44 + S 55 + S 66 In this study, the Constant strain method is used to estimate the mechanical properties. During the simulations, many strains act on the each configuration to form a strained structure, and then structure is optimized, keeping the cell parameters unchanged to permit internal relaxation, in which case the number of steps for each strain is 4, and the maximum strain amplitude is 0.003. 3.2.2 The uniaxial tensile test simulations In principle, the yield strength, fracture strength, and stretchability can be predicted by MD simulations under enough length (micrometer regime) and time scales. Here, the yield strength and the strength of 250% stretchability of PVA/FGF composites and pure PVA are performed by MD simulations of the uniaxial tension. During the simulations, the limit of the axial strain is set to be 250% and the strain ratio is 5.0×106 s−1 [41]. The Stress Component is carried out along one of XX, YY, and ZZ directions, respectively. All the other stress components are set to zero and then the stress-strain curves are plotted according to their average value."
5,RDF analyses,"3.3 RDF analyses Generally, RDF shows the distribution probability of another atom at around a given atom. Meanwhile, the peak position of RDF means the interaction strength between atoms. The small peak position indicates a strong interaction between atoms [42,43]. The formula of RDF (7) is as follows: (7) g A − B r = V N B ⋅ n B 4 π r 2 dr where n B is the number of atom B located at the distance r from atom A. N B is the total numbers of B atom in the composite and V is the total volume of the composite. In this study, the RDF curves of PVA/FGF composites are analyzed to estimate the probability of hydrogen bonding and the strength of interaction between PVA and FGF."
6,Interaction energy between PVA and FGF,"3.4 Interaction energy between PVA and FGF In the polymer composites, the interaction energy is an important parameter to estimate the degree of interaction between filler and polymer. The greater of the interaction energy indicate the stronger the intensity of the interaction between polymer and filler. The interaction energy (E inter) of PVA/FGF composites is expressed as following Eq. (8): (8) E int er = E total − E PVA + E FGF where E total , E PVA , and E FGF is the energy of the PVA/FGF composites, PVA resin, and FGF, respectively."
7,The mobility of PVA molecular chains,"3.5 The mobility of PVA molecular chains MSD is one critical parameter in determining the mobility of the polymer chains, which can be calculated by the following equation [44,45]: (9) MSD t = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N r i t − r i 0 2 where N, r i , and t is the total number of atoms in PVA molecular chains, the position of atom i, and the time of dynamic simulation, respectively. The angular brackets indicates an ensemble average."
8,Results and discussion,
9,The morphological characteristics of PET chain,"4.1 The morphological characteristics of PET chain In was reported that the polymer system is considered to be in equilibrium when the average size of the polymer chains has reached a stationary value [46,47]. Meanwhile, the size of a polymer molecular chain can be expressed by the radius of gyration (Rg) parameter. Fig. 3 shows the plot of calculated average Rg for PVA molecular chains in the pure resin and PVA/FGF20 composites. Clearly, the average Rg of PVA molecular chains in the system has no obvious fluctuations after 200ps, indicating that the polymer system has been in equilibrium. As a result, the average Rg of the pure PVA resin, PVA/SEGC, PVA/EGC, PVA/SEGN, and PVA/EGN composites is 19.92, 20.59, 21.10, 20.26, and 19.75Å, respectively. Note that the Rg of PVA molecular chains in FGF20 filled resin is larger than that of the pure PVA resin except for PVA/EGN composites under the same condition. These data indicate that PVA molecular chains in the composites are extended along the surface of FGF20 [48], which makes PVA molecular chains align more tightly each other. Obviously, the alignment of the molecular chains is favorable for the formation of hydrogen bonds, resulting in the enhancement of the interactions between molecular chains. As for PVA/EGN composites, Rg of PVA molecular chains is smaller than that of the pure PVA resin. Probably, the main reason is that the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl and amide functional groups is weaker than that between the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Meanwhile, the added EGN reduces the probability of interaction between molecular chains. Therefore, the more curly form of PVA molecular chains can be observed in PVA/EGN composites. Moreover, these phenomena can be further confirmed by the analyses below."
10,The mechanical properties analyses of PVA/FGF20 composite,"4.2 The mechanical properties analyses of PVA/FGF20 composite 4.2.1 Elastic modulus The mechanical properties of the PVA composites calculated by MD simulations are summarized in Table 1 . As presented in Table 1, the added FGF20 fillers can result in the different degrees of improvement on modulus and several interesting features can be observed. Firstly, the Young's modulus of PVA/EGC composites in the three axes direction are the strongest among the available composites, indicating the stronger interaction between PVA and EGC. Its maximum Young's modulus of 12.30GPa is larger than that of the pure PVA (8.53GPa), suggesting the increasing of Young's modulus by 44%. Here, note that the measured Young's modulus of PVA resin is increased by 25% with 0.5wt% GO sheet [48]. Moreover, the elastic modulus of PVA resin is found to be 150% increment with 0.3wt% GO sheet experimentally [49]. Here, those differences may result from the different shapes and sizes of GO. As for the other PVA/FGF20 composites, the Young's modulus of them in some axes direction are stronger or weaker than that of the pure PVA. Especially, the Young's modulus of PVA/EGN composites is the weakest among the PVA/FGF20 composites, which may be due to the configuration of PVA molecular chains on the surface of FGF20, weak interactions between PVA and FGF20. In addition, note that the Young's modulus in only one axis direction of PVA/EGN and PVA/SEGN is weaker than that of pure PVA. This point can be attributed to the weak interaction between PVA and EGN and SEGN as mentioned below. Moreover, the additions of EGN and SEGN result in the weak interaction between PVA molecular chains around EGN and SEGN. Secondly, compared with the pure PVA resin, the shear modulus of composites are improved by the addition of SEGC, EGC, and SEGN accordingly. On the contrary, the added EGN weakens the shear modulus of composites. As a result, the orders of the shear modulus are PVA/EGC>PVA/SEGC>PVA/SEGN>PVA>PVA/EGN. Thirdly, all the added FGF20 can enhance the bulk modulus of composites. Namely, the bulk modulus of PVA/EGC composites is the strongest followed by PVA/SEGC, PVA/SEGN, and PVA/EGN composites, respectively. Here, compared to pure PVA, the stronger bulk modulus of PVA/EGN composites may be due to the addition of high modulus graphene, which makes the material difficult to compress. 4.2.2 Tensile strength Fig. 4 shows the stress-strain curves for the PVA composites with different functional groups of FGF20 under uniaxial tension at 298K. These curves exhibit a typical elastic behavior and plastic deformation. It can be seen that the tensile strength of composites are increased by the addition of FGF20 compared to the pure PVA. In the elastic stage, the first maximum stress of parabola is defined as yield strength in the curves. Clearly, the yield strength of PVA/EGC, PVA/SEGC, PVA/SEGN, and PVA/EGN composites is up to 0.59, 0.55, 0.52, and 0.50GPa, respectively, which is larger than that of the pure PVA (0.47GPa). After passing the elastic platform, the stress increases linearly with the increase of the strain in the plastic stage. Here, the tensile stress of PVA/EGC, PVA/SEGC, PVA/SEGN, and PVA/EGN composites is 1.49, 1.36, 1.08, and 0.94GPa, respectively, which is stronger than that of the pure PVA (0.91GPa) at the same 250% elongation. Therefore, PVA/FGF20 composites have weak stretchability. On the other hand, the fracture strength of system cannot be obtained duo to the limitation of the length and time scale. As a result, FGF20 can effectively increase the tensile strength of composites with a certain elongation. Meanwhile, the changing trend of the tensile strength with different functional groups is similar to that of elastic modulus. The reason may be attributed to the addition of graphene with excellent mechanical properties and the strong interaction between FGF20 and PVA, which blocks the movement of PVA molecular chains. By analyzing the above data, it is found that oxygen-containing functional groups in the graphene are more conducive to improving the strength of PVA/FGF20 composites, because O atoms bounded to the graphene are more likely to form hydrogen bonds with H atoms of PVA than those of the N atoms. This point can be further verified by the following analyses. At the same time, we found that the properties of materials are related not only to the strength of molecular interaction, but also to the properties of fillers themselves."
11,Radial distribution functions of PVA and FGF20,"4.3 Radial distribution functions of PVA and FGF20 In order to further explore the influence of the nature of FGF20 on the interaction between PVA and FGF20, RDF between PVA and FGF20 are analyzed. For simplicity, the atoms H and O of -OH in PVA molecular chains are marked with HPVA and OPVA, respectively. The atom O that connects to SEGC and EGC is marked with OSEGC and OEGC, respectively. Similarly, the atoms O and N that connect to SEGN and EGN are marked with OSEGN, OEGN, NSEGN, and NEGN, respectively. The RDF (g(r)-r) curves between the atoms N and O of SEGC, EGC, SEGN, and EGN and the atoms H of -OH in PVA have been given in Fig. 5 . According to the literature [42,43], the peaks within 3.5Å in the g(r)~r curves are mainly composed of hydrogen bonds and chemical bonds. While the peaks beyond 3.5Å are mainly composed of Van der waals interaction and Coulomb force. As shown in Fig. 5a, the first peak in the g(r)-r curves of HPVA-OSEGC and HPVA-OEGC of PVA/SEGC and PVA/EGC composites appears at 1.59 and 1.71Å, respectively. This indicates that the initial distance of HPVA-OSEGC is smaller than that of HPVA-OEGC, suggesting that the interaction between PVA and SEGC is stronger than that between PVA and EGC. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that the atoms O of -O- and -OH on the surfaces of the graphene nanofiber are easier to form hydrogen bonds with the atoms H of the -OH in PVA compared with that of -COOH at the edges of the graphene nanofiber. Fig. 5b is the g(r)~r curves of HPVA-OPVA between PVA molecular chains in the pure PVA, PVA/SEGC, and PVA/EGC composites. The highest peak value of HPVA-OPVA in PVA/EGC, pure PVA, and PVA/SEGC resin is about 1.65, 1.70, and 1.83Å, respectively, indicating that the added EGC leads to the formation of the strongest hydrogen bonds between the H and O (-OH) atoms of PVA molecular chains. However, the added SEGC results in the formation of the relatively weak hydrogen bond between PVA molecular chains, which can be ascribed to the fact that the O atoms of epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups on the surfaces of graphene nanofiber increase the distances between PVA molecular chains on both sides of the SEGC nanofiber compared with EGC nanofiber. These changing trends are consistent with the results of R g and mechanical properties mentioned above. Moreover, similar phenomenon can also be observed in Fig. 5c and d. As shown in Fig. 5c, the first peak in the g(r)-r curves of HPVA-OSEGN, HPVA-OEGN, HPVA-NSEGN, and HPVA-NEGN of PVA/SEGN and PVA/EGN composites appears at 1.71, 2.01, 2.59, and 2.17Å, respectively. These differences can be clarified by considering the fact that SEGN and EGN contain different types of the functional groups and the locations of the functional groups are also different. The initial distances of HPVA-OSEGN and HPVA-OEGN are smaller than those of the HPVA-NSEGN and HPVA-NEGN, indicating that the atoms O of FGF20 are easier to form hydrogen bonds with the atoms H of -OH in PVA than those of the atoms N of FGF20. This point can be understood because the electronegativity of oxygen atom is larger than that of the nitrogen atom. All these facts will reduce the probability of the interaction between the atoms N and the atoms H of -OH in PVA. Moreover, this point can be further reflected by the g(r)~r curves of HPVA-OPVA between PVA molecular chains in the pure PVA, PVA/SEGN, and PVA/EGN composites. As shown in Fig. 5d, the highest peak of HPVA-OPVA in PVA/EGN, pure PVA and PVA/SEGN resin is located at 1.75, 1.70, and 1.69Å, respectively, indicating that the added SEGN and EGN have slight effects on the hydrogen bonds formed between the H and O (-OH) atoms of PVA molecular chains. Moreover, the highest peak of HPVA-OPVA in PVA/SEGN composites is significantly lower than those in PVA/EGN composites, implying that the addition of SEGN only reduces the probability of the formation of hydrogen bonds. This point is also agreement with the phenomenon of PVA/SEGC composites in Fig. 5b. Therefore, the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of FGF contribute to the formation of hydrogen bonds between PVA and FGF20. However, the other positions of the functional groups of FGF20 are helpful for the hydrogen bonds between PVA molecular chains."
12,Interaction energy between PVA and functionalized graphene,"4.4 Interaction energy between PVA and functionalized graphene It was reported that blending graphene with PVA resin can greatly improve the mechanical properties of PVA resin [49–51], and the degree of improvement is directly affected by the interaction energy (E inter) between PVA resin and graphene. In this study, E inter between PVA and FGF20 has been calculated. As shown in Table 2 , the largest interaction energy can be observed in PVA/SEGC followed by PVA/EGC, PVA/SEGN, and PVA/EGN composites, which is consistent with the results of the above RDF analyses. Clearly, these data indicate that the oxygen-containing FGF20 are more likely to form strong interactions with PVA resin relative to the nitrogen-containing FGF20. Compared PVA/SEGC with PVA/EGC composites, it can be seen that the interaction energy between PVA and SEGC is stronger than that between PVA and EGC, indicating that the more oxygen-containing functional groups of FGF20 will lead to the stronger interaction between PVA and FGF20. Compared PVA/SEGN with PVA/EGN composites, it is clearly that the interaction energy between PVA and SEGN is larger than that between PVA and EGN because of the presence of oxygenated functional groups in the former."
13,MSD of PVA chains,"4.5 MSD of PVA chains In order to further investigate the structural influences of FGF20 on the mechanical properties of PVA/FGF20 composites, the MSD curves of PVA molecular chains around FGF20 in the PVA/FGF20 composites have been given as well as that of the pure PVA resin for comparison. Generally, the slope of the curve indicates the ability of the molecular chain to move, i.e., the larger the slope of the curve is, the stronger the mobility of the chain will be. As shown in Fig. 6 , the slopes of the MDS curves of PVA/FGF20 composites are smaller than that of the pure PVA expect for that of PVA/EGN, suggesting that the added FGF20 decreases the ability of PVA molecular chains to move because of the strong interaction between PVA and FGF20. Moreover, the orders of the slope of the MSD curves are PVA/EGN>PVA>PVA/SEGN>PVA/SEGC>PVA/EGC, suggesting that the interaction between PVA molecular chains and oxygen-containing FGF20 is stronger than that between PVA molecular chains and nitrogen-containing FGF20. Obviously, the strong interaction can limit the movement of PVA molecular chains, which is responsible for the high modulus of PVA/EGC composites mentioned above. So, the type and location of functional groups on FGF20 determine the properties of the PVA/FGF20 composites."
14,The effect of aspect ratio of graphene,"4.6 The effect of aspect ratio of graphene In order to investigate the effect of aspect ratio of graphene on the mechanical properties of PVA/FGF composites, we have also constructed a series of composites with different aspect ratios of graphene. Taking FGF with the oxygen-containing functional groups at the edges as an example, as shown in Table 3 , the order of the elastic modulus of composites is PVA/FGF20>PVA/FGF30>PVA/FGF10, suggesting the elastic modulus of composites is strengthened with the increase of aspect ratios of graphene in a certain range. Similarly, this phenomenon can also be observed in Fig. 7 , where the yield strength of PVA/FGF10, PVA/FGF20, and PVA/FGF30 is 0.52, 0.59, and 0.57GPa, respectively. Correspondingly, the calculated tensile stress is 1.11, 1.48, and 1.25GPa at 250% elongation, respectively. Therefore, it seems that a larger aspect ratio of graphene will reduce the enhancement of mechanical properties of composites. Probably, the reason can be ascribed to the fact that a larger aspect ratio of graphene will affect the arrangement of PVA molecular chains around them due to the shape of the wrinkled FGF30."
15,Conclusions,"In this study, the mechanical properties of PVA/FGF20 (PVA/SEGC, PVA/EGC, PVA/SEGN, and PVA/EGN) composites and pure PVA resin have been investigated using MD simulations. The microstructure analyses (such as R g, RDF, E inter, and MSD) of all materials have been studied to reveal the influence of FGF20 on the mechanical properties of materials. It was found that the addition of FGF20 can improve the mechanical properties of composites, and the type and location of functional groups bounded to FGF20 affect the properties of the PVA/FGF20 composites. Firstly, the oxygen-containing FGF20 has significant improvements on the mechanical properties of PVA/FGF20 composites compared with nitrogen-containing FGF20 because oxygen is more likely to form hydrogen bonds than nitrogen. Secondly, the oxygen-containing groups in the edge of FGF20 (i.e. EGC) have the strongest improvement capability than the other FGF20 (i.e. SEGC, SEGN, and EGN), which can be ascribed to the alignment of the PVA molecular chains in the plane of the EGC nanofiber and the strong interfacial interaction between PVA and EGC. In a word, the improvement of the mechanical properties of PVA/FGF20 composites is ascribed to the micromorphology of PVA molecular chains, the properties of FGF20 themselves, and the strong interfacial interaction between PVA and FGF20. Moreover, the mechanical properties of composites have been enhanced with the increase of aspect ratios of graphene in a certain range. On the other hand, a larger aspect ratio of graphene will reduce the enhancement of mechanical properties of compositions. Hopefully, the present findings are helpful to the molecular design and the improvement of PVA-based material properties."
