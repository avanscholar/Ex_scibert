0,Introduction,"The primary energy sources for catering human demand are mostly covered by conventional fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas. However, gradually dwindling supplies of fossil fuels and heavily reliant on it have resulted in a serious energy crisis and environmental pollution issues. Therefore, it is indispensable without exception to explore a sustainable energy source. Biomass, the most abundant and low-cost feedstock, has been regarded to offer an alternative to produce renewable carbon (Cheng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2015). As of now, thermochemical process such as catalytic pyrolysis has been extensively studied and considered as a promising pathway to convert biomass to high-value chemicals and fuels (Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). Compared to the catalytic pyrolysis aiming at the production of liquid oil, the gasification or co-gasification targets to achieve the output of syngas (CO & H2) in the presence of gasifying media, which requires a higher temperature (typically greater than 800 °C) than catalytic pyrolysis does (typically less than 700 °C). Tar deposition is a serious problem and may cause operational issues such as blockage and corrosion during gasification. Also, Techno-economic analysis indicated that the pyrolysis-based pathway had economic advantages over the gasification pathway regarding the production of transportation fuels from biomass (Liu et al., 2014). Phenol and its derivatives are important intermediates in the chemical industry, which are usually used in the production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, etc (Mullen et al., 2017). However, the worldwide phenol is currently manufactured based on petrochemical benzene in the cumene process, which is an energy-intensive process and gives rise to by-product acetone and environmental pollution (Huang et al., 2018). Therefore, it is of great significance of converting biomass directed towards phenols production to mitigate the dependence on fossil energies. The lignin fraction of biomass could be directly dissociated into phenols in the presence of specific catalysts. The cellulose/hemicellulose segments in biomass, though not possessing phenols-like framework, could also lead to the generation of phenols through rearrangement, decarbonylation, and Diels-Alder reactions, etc (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b). The resulting phenols in so-called bio-oils could be effectively concentrated by extraction using specific solvents (Yang et al., 2014). Hydrogen, as the most abundant element in the universe and an eco-friendly energy carrier, appears to be an evolving alternative fuel for the future. In addition to serving as an energy carrier, hydrogen is also employed as an important intermediate in the chemical industries such as petroleum refining, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, fertilizers and steel production, etc. (Kumar et al., 2017). In recent years, hydrogen fuel cells and cars have attracted much attention, which represents an emerging opportunity for hydrogen-based transportation to replace conventional vehicles. But currently, up to 96% of worldwide hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels via natural gas or oil steam reforming and coal gasification, all of which are based on non-renewable sources, virtually also leading to huge amounts of greenhouse gases emission, especially carbon dioxide (Dou et al., 2019). Regarding renewable sources, biomass converted to hydrogen is one of the technologies that is highly anticipated, which has been extensively investigated in the past few decades (Santamaria et al., 2019). Many kinds of catalysts have been used for the catalytic conversion of biomass. And the shape-selectivity performance of catalysts plays an important role in the production of fine chemicals and fuels (Sudarsanam et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2015). ZSM-5 type zeolites have been recognized as the effective catalyst of biomass catalytic pyrolysis aiming at the production of phenols or aromatic hydrocarbons. Whereas one of the most serious shortcomings is the rapid deactivation due to the coke deposition issues, although coking deactivated zeolites can be regenerated by combustion (Mullen et al., 2017; Bulushev and Ross, 2011; Gopakumar et al., 2012). The alkali metals contained in biomass may deposit on the zeolite resulting in its permanent deactivation (Gao et al., 2015). Therefore, screening the highly-efficient and long-life catalysts is indispensable for the catalytic conversion of biomass. Biochar, activated carbon and graphitized carbon nanotubes are defined as typical carbonaceous materials, which are usually used for biomass thermochemical conversion (Liu et al., 2019; Mateo et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020). The biomass-derived activated carbon has been demonstrated to be effective for converting lignocellulosic biomass and isolated cellulose into phenols (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b; Chen et al., 2020). Compared with activated carbon, biochar has limited specific areas, functional groups, and so on. However, research results showed that the selectivity toward hydrocarbons and phenol compounds was obviously enhanced when biochar was employed in the pyrolysis of biomass (Zhu et al., 2018). Recently, our group reported that the metals impregnated carbon catalysts derived from nanocellulose displayed notable performance in hydrogen generation when applied for biomass pyrolysis, and up to 67.4 vol% of hydrogen concentration was observed in the gas product, which showed that nanocellulose derived carbon catalysts may possess high reductibility leading to more hydrogen formation (Zhang et al., 2020). However, it is still not simple and economical to synthesize the metals loaded catalysts. And the present work is to perform the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass over nanocellulose derived raw biochar catalyst for enhancing the production of phenols-rich bio-oil and hydrogen-rich gas."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Biochar catalyst used in this study was produced via microwave-assisted pyrolysis of nanocellulose. The nanocellulose powder (cellulose nanocrystals) was purchased from Celluforce Inc., Canada, and used without further treatment. The Douglas fir sawdust (C: 47.8 wt%; H: 6.6 wt%; O by difference: 45.6 wt%) was purchased from Bear Mountain Forest Products incorporated, which was ground to granule with a size of less than 1.5 mm and used without further treatment. During the quantification of phenol, cresols and dimethylphenols, phenol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99%), m-cresol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and 3,5-dimethylphenol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99%) were used as authentic standards. Here, m-cresol and 3,5-dimethylphenol were employed to respectively represent all the isomers of cresols and dimethylphenols. Different solutions of authentic standards (100 mg/L, 200 mg/L, 500 mg/L, and 1000 mg/L) were prepared to define the standard curves. All the resulting solutions were analyzed by GC/MS."
3,Biochar catalyst preparation and characterizations,"2.2 Biochar catalyst preparation and characterizations A Sineo MAS-II microwave synthesis workstation (Shanghai, China) was used to implement nanocellulose pyrolysis. In a typical run, 40 g nanocellulose powder was loaded into a three-necked quartz flask, and then inflated with 400 mL/min N2 for 15 min to create an oxygen-free atmosphere. After that, N2 was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 100 mL/min to carry out the pyrolysis vapor. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis process lasted for 40 min with a power input of 700 W. At last, about 7 g biochar catalysts could be collected and subsequently used in the pyrolysis of Douglas fir without further treatment. The nanocellulose derived biochar was subjected to the mineral analysis (University of Arkansas, Fayetteville), elemental analysis (PerkinElmer 2400 Series II), characterizations of N2 adsorption–desorption (Micromeritics R TristarII 3020), scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN VEGA3), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD, Micromeritics Autochem 2920), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Shimadzu)."
4,Catalytic pyrolysis and product analysis,"2.3 Catalytic pyrolysis and product analysis The catalytic pyrolysis of Douglas fir was carried out to test the performance of biochars in a fixed bed quartz tube furnace reactor (Thermal Fisher Scientific). Douglas fir (1 g) and Biochar catalyst (by ratios) were first introduced into the quartz tube (inner diameter, 20 mm; length, 600 mm), then purged with N2 at a flow rate of 300 mL/min for 15 min to create an oxygen-free environment. The quartz wool was also placed to separate and hold the Douglas fir and biochar catalyst in place. In order to keep a relatively constant temperature, the biochar catalyst bed was firstly heated to the desired temperature and the Douglas fir bed was subsequently pushed into the furnace to be heated for getting pyrolysis volatiles. During the pyrolysis, N2 was set at a flow of 50 mL/min to carry out volatiles flowing through the biochar catalyst bed and then a condensation system. The liquid product yield was calculated based on Douglas fir by the mass difference of the condensation system before and after the reaction. The yield of solid product was obtained by the weight change (coke) of biochar catalysts plus mass of left residue (char) after biomass pyrolysis. The weight change of biochars was obtained by the difference of catalyst before and after the reaction. The yield of gas was calculated by using the mass balance of liquid and solid products. A central composite design (CCD) was adopted to investigate the optimized experimental conditions. According to the results of CCD, the biochar to Douglas fir mass ratios and temperatures were respectively set to 1.6, 2, 3, 4, 4.4 and 579, 600, 650, 700, 721 °C. The chemical composition of bio-oils was determined by using the Agilent 7890A/5975C GC–MS system equipped with a DB-5 capillary column. The GC was initially maintained at 40 °C for 5 min, and then was heated to 280 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and maintained for 5 min. 1 μL of the ethyl acetate diluted sample was injected into the GC with helium gas at the flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The ion source temperature was 230 °C for the mass selective detector. The NIST automatic mass spectral search library was applied to interpret the compounds detected in liquid samples. The area percentage of compounds based on the GC/MS results was used to predict the product selectivity. The standard solutions with specific concentrations of some phenols were also subjected to GC/MS for the quantification analysis. The non-condensable was collected in a Tedlar gas bag and analyzed by using an INFICON 3000 Micro-GC (INFICON Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) system with two channels of thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). The column type of channel A is a Molecular Sieve with a temperature of 100 °C using Argon as a carrier gas. The column type of channel B is Plot U with a temperature of 85 °C using Helium as a carrier gas. Channel A and channel B were respectively used to identify H2, CH4, CO and CO2, C2, C3, C4. The gas compounds with more than 4 carbon atoms (>C4) were either not detected or negligible in this study."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Biochar characterizations,"3.1 Biochar characterizations As the SEM results showed, porous framework and irregular channels could be found in biochar catalysts, which could provide enough active sites for the primary dissociation of large molecules in pyrolysis volatiles. The nanocellulose derived biochar held a relatively high BET surface area of 154.55 m2/g, which might arise from its porous structure. The area of micropores and external surface was respectively 139.41 and 15.14 m2/g. The total adsorbed quantity of NH3 was 0.0513 mmol/g, which indicated that the biochar catalyst had a similar total acidity to physical-activated carbon such as by steam activation (Zhang et al., 2019). The content of carbon and hydrogen in biochars was respectively 79.82 wt% and 1.93 wt%, displaying a good carbonization during the production of biochars. Only a trace amount of nitrogen (0.39 wt%) was observed. The oxygen (17.86 wt%, by difference) revealed the inherent oxygenated groups existing over biochars, which correlated with FT-IR analysis results. The bands shift at 1150 and 1440 & 1600 cm−1 could be respectively assigned to the vibrations of CO and CC groups. Adsorption peaks at 1710 and 2900 cm−1 were respectively attributed to the CO and CH group vibrations. The complete minerals profile including Ca, P, K, Fe, Mg, S, Cu, Na, and Al, the content of which were respectively 404, 2563, 290, 181, 198, 12107, 2.29, 12149, and 27.7 ppm. There was no detectable content of Mn and Zn. The inherent mineral constituents concentrated on biochar such as Na, P, and S might combine with oxygen leading to more active sites, which could optimize the catalytic performance of biochar catalysts and impact the product distribution (Xu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b)."
7,Catalytic pyrolysis of Douglas fir over biochar,"3.2 Catalytic pyrolysis of Douglas fir over biochar The yield of products: Table 1 concluded the yield of bio-oils, non-condensable gases, and solid products as a function of catalytic temperatures and biochar to Douglas fir feeding ratios. As summarized in Table 1, two factors including pyrolysis temperatures and biochar/Douglas fir ratios were simultaneously considered to design the experimental model. Generally for conventional methods, it needs a lot of experimental runs to design and optimize the research conditions, especially for the models involving two parameters or more. At this moment in the multivariate experimental models, the statistical experimental designs has been demonstrating its superiority in contrast with conventional ones, which could achieve the optimal response with a minimum number of experimental runs. And response surface methodology has been used as a reliable statistical tool especially, which targets to employ an experimental design like the central composite design (CCD) to fit the research model through least-squares technique (Ghafoori et al., 2014, 2015; Ahmadi et al., 2005; Tavares et al., 2009). Herein, a Box-Wilson central composite design with 5 central points (duplicated runs) and 4 factorial and 4 axial points was employed for this 2-factors model, which resulted in 13 runs in this study. All statistical work was achieved through Design-Expert 10.0 software (Villota et al., 2018; Asfaram et al., 2015). As were shown in Table 1, compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis at the same temperature, it was seen that the yield of bio-oils was increased, while the gas yield was reduced. At the temperature of 650 °C, for instance, the yield of bio-oil and gas for the absence of biochar catalyst was respectively 29 wt% and 52 wt% (Run 34), which were respectively changed to 35 wt% and 44 wt% (Run 1) when bio-char was employed, suggesting that biochar could make light pyrolysis volatiles catalyzed with more generation of liquid fractions. At a fixed biochar to Douglas fir ratio, the higher temperature could decrease the bio-oil yield and enhance more production of gases. For example, 36 wt% of the bio-oil yield in Run 16 was reduced to 30 wt% in Run 17, while the gas yield was increased to 52 wt% from 44 wt%. As the biochar to feeding ratio increased to 4 (Run 11) from 2 (Run 13), the bio-oil and gas yield changed to 24 wt% and 58 wt%, respectively from 29 wt% and 53 wt%, which may be attributed to the facilitated dissociation of heavier pyrolytic volatiles over biochar catalysts. It seemed that the yield of solid products stayed almost constant at around 20 wt% within the range of all experimental runs. The weight change of biochar catalysts ascribed to the coke deposition and reactions with pyrolysis volatiles. The normal probability plot of residuals, 2D contour lines, and 3D response surface regarding the yield of bio-oil, solid, and gas products were further analyzed. The residual represents the difference between the predicted/fitted values and observed experimental values from the regression. The normal probability plot of residual is a graphical tool to evaluate if a data set is approximately normally distributed or not (Ghafoori et al., 2014; Hasan et al., 2009). It could be interpreted as the normal distribution of residual values because of the points on the plot spreading very close to the straight line, which conveyed that the experimental points were reasonably aligned, suggesting the normal distribution of the experimental data from the current design model (Ghafoori et al., 2014; Hasan et al., 2009). The 2D contour lines and 3D response surface provided us a clearer demonstration of the interactive effect of the two variables on the response. It is easy to understand the bio-oil presents a descending yield with the increasing pyrolysis temperatures and biochar/feeding ratios, whereas which is contrary to the yield of gas products. The normality of residuals regarding the content of phenolic monomers, the concentration of hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide indicated the normal distribution of these experimental data (the fitted R2 of the above compounds was respectively 0.87, 0.97, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.75). Additionally, the comparisons of predicted and actual experimental values suggested a good fit, and the presence of a linear relationship between them with high correlation expressed their low discrepancies (Ghafoori et al., 2014, 2015; Asfaram et al., 2015). The reasonability of the present experimental design could be confirmed by aforesaid plots and analysis. The service life is an essential indicator that impacts critically on the cost and catalytic property of biochar catalyst. Therefore, the used biochar catalyst collected after Run 1 was employed to evaluate the reuse performance for 15 cycles from Run 18 to Run 32 at the temperature of 650 °C. By contrast with fresh biochar catalyst, as Table 1 conveyed, the reused biochar gave rise to a similar yield of bio-oil, and tended to lessen the gas yield following the increasing cycles of reuse. This suggested that the biochar catalyst could maintain a stable catalytic activity in biomass dissociation despite 15 cycles of reuse and without regeneration, which might arise from the fact that the formed coke is also carbonaceous residue being of similar matrix with biochars (Zhang et al., 2019). 3.2.1 The compositions of bio-oils The identification and partial quantification of specific phenols were carried out by GC/MS analysis. As Fig. 1 and the total ion chromatogram depicted, elevated temperatures enhanced the decarbonylation, decarboxylation and so like reactions despite the absence of biochars, which resulted in the acids, ketones, and esters produced with only a small quantity. By contrast with the non-catalytic process, biochar catalyzed the obtained bio-oil compositions to be simplified. For example in Run 1, the acids, ketones, and so on were not detectable in bio-oils, while the selectivity of phenolic monomers was facilitated to 91.36% from 49.27% (Run 34) with the assistance of biochars. Additionally, the concentration of phenol and cresols in bio-oil from Run 34 was respectively 15.76 mg/mL and 20.95 mg/mL, which were notably promoted to 53.77 mg/mL and 44.51 mg/mL of Run 1. While the concentration of dimethylphenols was slightly reduced to 7.76 mg/mL of Run 1 from 9.11 mg/mL of Run 34, which revealed that the biochar intensified the dissociation of side-chains from the aromatic nucleus. What is of more interest was that the selectivity of naphthalenes was reduced to 8.64% from 22.24%, which exhibited that the biochar could effectively suppressed the condensation of mono-aromatic intermediates into poly-aromatics. It should be noted that the detectable furans were dramatically reduced to a much low level or not observed, which was attributed to the conversion of furans to aromatics through Diels-Alder, aromatization, oligomerization, rearrangement and so like reactions (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b; Cheng and Huber, 2011; Uslamin et al., 2019). The maximum selectivity of phenolic monomers was up to 95.72% (Run 10) located at the catalytic temperature of 600 °C with 4 of biochar to Douglas fir ratio. During 15 cycles of reuse, it was noteworthy that the selectivity towards phenolic monomers kept at around 65%, which was lower than that over fresh biochar, but still excelling that from the non-catalytic process. The concentration of phenol and cresols tended to decline over reused biochars but still higher than that from non-catalytic pyrolysis. And the generation of dimethylphenols was favored over reused biochars. By contrast with fresh biochar, the reused one also tended to produce more furans and naphthalenes. These results showed that the reused biochar was still highly active towards the production of phenols but the catalytic performances had degraded in contrast with fresh biochars. This might be related to the decrease of certain minerals. The content of P, S, and Na was reduced to 823, 2142, and 6430 ppm respectively from 2563, 12107, and 12149 ppm, and these complex species were demonstrated to upgrade the pyrolysis volatiles and enhance the generation of phenols (Mateo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b; Zhao and Li, 2016). By comparison with the compositions of the bio-oils produced over zeolites or metal oxides catalysts, the difference was marked on the hydrocarbons content (Liu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). These conventional catalysts removed the oxygen in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water, resulting in the bio-oil with a very low content of O-species. Whereas the carbon catalysts like activated carbons and biochars mostly centered on the production of valuable bio-based chemicals such as phenols (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b; Chen et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2018). Fig. 2 illustrates the effects of catalytic temperatures and biochar to Douglas fir ratios on bio-oil compositions. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, the generation of phenolic monomers was weakened at the early stage and then intensified by rising biochar to Douglas fir ratios, whereas it almost underwent a constant selectivity as the ratios further increase from 3 to 4.41. Fig. 2C described the concentration of phenol, cresols, and dimethylphenols in bio-oils varied with biochar to Douglas fir ratios. As described, the content of dimethylphenols gradually declined to 1.2 mg/mL from 22.08 mg/mL along with the increasing biochar to Douglas fir ratios. As the biochar to Douglas fir ratios ranging at 1.6 ~ 3, the concentration of phenol and cresols firstly decreased and then increased. Further increase of biochar to Douglas fir ratios resulted in the decreasing concentration of phenol from 53.77 mg/mL to 17.36 mg/mL, and cresols from 44.51 mg/mL to 12.23 mg/mL. The limited increase of biochar ratios could enhance the generation of phenols (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b; Mamaeva et al., 2016), which was consistent with the current conclusions. However, elevated biochar ratios may obviously enlarge the residence time of pyrolysis volatiles and eventually lead to the excessive cracking or condensation to polymers like naphthalenes. According to Fig. 2B and D, the temperature lower than 650 °C benefitted the reactions of decarbonylation, decarboxylation, aromatization that led to the more production of phenolic monomers (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b). And at elevated temperatures, the excessive cracking and condensation reactions would dominate with increased production of light gases and reduced formation of phenolic monomers. 3.2.2 The compositions of non-condensable gases The thermal shock driven by elevated temperatures triggers the biomass pyrolysis volatiles undergo random dissociation and linkage that will generate complicated gas streams consisting of hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, C2, C3, and so on. In the absence of biochars at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, as Fig. 3 introduced, the content of hydrogen and methane was respectively 42.70 vol% and 18.35 vol%, which slightly went up to 45.53 vol% and 18.46 vol% as the temperature rose to 650 °C. Following a further increase of the temperature to 700 °C, the hydrogen content moved significantly to 55.20 vol% at the expense of C m H n , and CO x , which was testified by the decreasing content of methane (18.35 to 16.50 vol%), carbon monoxide (28.03 to 21.61 vol%) and carbon dioxide (5.13 to 3.12 vol%). This could be interpreted that high temperatures resulted in the decomposition of methane through a free radical mechanism with the production of hydrogen and coke (Ochoa et al., 2020), and C m H n was also consumed by dry or CO x reforming reactions leading to the hydrogen generation (Balat and Kırtay, 2010). In addition, the water vapor existing in pyrolysis volatiles can also be a considerable origin of hydrogen by means of the reactions of steam reforming with C m H n , and water–gas shift (WGS) reaction with carbon monoxide (Restrup et al., 2013). With the assistance of biochar catalysts, for instance, in Run 1, the hydrogen concentration reached up to 80.71 vol% that was dramatically enhanced from 45.53 vol% of Run 34. And meanwhile, it should be observed that the content of methane and carbon monoxide significantly fell off to 8.32 vol% and 6.43 vol% respectively out of 18.46 vol% and 24.58 vol%, reasons of which should be that the biochar intensified the reactions of dry reforming, steam reforming and water–gas shift reactions where the inherent minerals complexes in biochar could provide active sites for these reactions (Muritala et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2018). Additionally, the Boudouard reaction (Ochoa et al., 2020) and water–gas reaction (WGR) (Avbenake et al., 2019) may also occur to contribute to the generation of hydrogen. These results could also be confirmed by the low amounts of carbon dioxide and light HCs observed in non-condensable gas when biochar supplied in the pyrolysis. The biochar derived from nanocellulose outstands on the significant enhancement of hydrogen generation when compared to the activated carbon and the whole biomass-derived biochar catalyst. For instance, the phosphoric acid-treated activated carbon has been used to pyrolyze biomass, and less than 10 vol% of hydrogen was observed in gas products, whereas the carbon monoxide reached up to 50 vol% (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b). Zhu et al. (2018) studied the biomass pyrolysis over corn stover derived biochar catalyst, and about 30 vol% of hydrogen and 50 vol% of carbon dioxide was obtained in gas product. Over 15 cycles of reuse assessment, it could be seen that there was a descending trend on the content of hydrogen, which declined to 63.28 vol% (Run 32) from 73.38 vol% (Run 18), but still far beyond that of non-catalytic pyrolysis (45.53 vol% of Run 34). And the output of methane and carbon monoxide appeared to maintain at around a range of 10–14 vol%, which still remained in the lower level by comparison with free of biochar catalysts. These exposed that the catalytic performance of spent biochars degraded in comparison with a fresh one, but continued to act as an effective catalyst to prompt the generation of hydrogen despite 15 cycles of reuses. Fig. 4 diagrammed the compositions of gas products varied with respect to the catalytic temperatures and biochar to Douglas fir ratios. Fig. 4A offered that hydrogen evolution was gradually promoted by rising biochar to Douglas fir ratios from 1.6 (67.23 vol%, Run 3) to 3 (80.71 vol%, Run 1) accompanied by the reducing output of methane, carbon oxides, and light HCs, which extra proved that the biochar accelerated the reactions of steam reforming and dry reforming to motivate the generation of hydrogen. Whereas the content of hydrogen underwent a slight increase as biochar to Douglas fir ratios further rising from 4 to 4.4. Following the temperature increasing at the fixed biochar to Douglas fir ratio of 3, the hydrogen concentration was enhanced to 80.71 vol% (650 °C) from 74.42 vol% (579 °C). While following the further increase of temperature to 720 °C, the hydrogen fraction fluctuated with a small extent to 82.38 vol%, which was caused by the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium. And some reactions such as WGS might shift towards the reverse at an even higher temperature, while simultaneously suppressing the formation of hydrogen (Restrup et al., 2013). On the whole, the hydrogen evolution expressed an upward tendency as the temperature and ratio of biochar to Douglas fir moved up, while this was subject to the constraints of kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium."
8,Insight into the reaction mechanism,"3.3 Insight into the reaction mechanism The possible pathways of phenols generated from the catalytic pyrolysis of Douglas fir was presented in Fig. 5 . The alkylphenols could be formed through demethoxylation of G-type or S-type methoxy phenols that were respectively originated from coniferyl alcohol (G-unit) and sinapyl alcohol (S-unit) during lignin depolymerization with the evolution of H2 and CO, etc (Chio et al., 2019). Besides, the transalkylation reaction was also an important pathway to yield phenols, in which the role of metals on biochar might matter a lot (Wang et al., 2017). Reported literature also pointed out that the superheated moisture existing in the pyrolysis volatiles could react with the oxygen-containing groups leading to the enhancement of the acidity of biochar, and then promote the dehydration and decarbonylation reactions, etc., which were considered to intensify the conversion of cellulose or hemicellulose pyrolysis intermediates into phenols (Su et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 5, similar to the “hydrocarbon pool” theory that was popularly employed to illustrate the pathway toward the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during biomass catalytic pyrolysis over high acidity catalysts like HZSM-5 (Kelkar et al., 2014; Iliopoulou et al., 2019), our previous study has proposed the “phenol pool” reaction to describe the phenols production from the pyrolysis of glucose-based carbohydrates over activated carbon catalyst (Zhang et al., 2018a, 2018b). And in this theory, C5 fractions like furans and ketenes would undergo oligomerization, decarbonization, and decarboxylation reactions to form phenols. The superheated steam (water) present in the reaction system has been demonstrated to attenuate the adsorption of coke precursors on the catalyst (Wang et al., 2018), and enable catalyst a more stable selectivity on desired products (Verboekend et al., 2016). Nimlos et al. reported that the water could react with aromatic intermediates to form phenols during biomass pyrolysis, which was confirmed through the identification of 18O-labeled oxygen (prior use of 18O-labeled water as the steam source) in the phenol products. And the authors further declared that this result also appeared in the pyrolysis of isolated cellulose (Mukarakate et al., 2015). Hence the phenols also arose from another pathway that was suggested in this study, as was offered in Fig. 5, the furans reacted with olefins in the “hydrocarbon pool” via Diels-Alder reaction to generate aromatic intermediates, and meanwhile, the water involved in this process with the motivation of protonation, last boosting the formation of phenols. As for another reaction route, the oxygen-containing intermediates resulted from the Diels-Alder reaction could also undergo the dehydrogenation process to form phenols with the inducing of low acidity catalyst, which had been testified in a previous publication (Mullen et al., 2017). Additionally, it should be stressed that the water appearing in the pyrolysis system, whether it is free, bound, or produced water, would play an important role in enhancing the formation of phenols, and also be a source of hydrogen. As it is known, hydrothermal deactivation may occur for zeolites especially at such a high temperature, whereas which does not apply to the biochar catalyst because of its non-crystalline structures. Therefore, besides the good tolerance to coke deposit issue and simpler to manufacture, etc., the biochar catalyst also has the resistance of hydrothermal deactivation especially in the conditions of high temperature and humidity, which suggests that the biochar catalyst has promising advantages although some of its activities are restricted by comparison with conventional zeolite catalysts."
9,Practical implications of this study,"3.4 Practical implications of this study As of now, many catalysts such as acidic zeolites, metals/transition metal oxides have been extensively studied in the conversion of biomass into initial liquids or gases, and also in the catalytic upgrading of bio-based compounds into value-added chemicals, such as phenols, furans, and hydrocarbons. However, the serious coking issue, deposition of inherent minerals of biomass, and collapse of crystal texture in hydrothermal conditions could sharply cause the deactivation and poisoning, and reduce the service life of these catalysts. Based on the results of this work, biomass-derived biochar catalysts are relatively cheaper and simpler to manufacture, and highly resistant to hydrothermal deactivation, deposition of coke, and inorganic species. Whereas this study focuses on the trial of nanocellulose derived biochar in the biomass conversion, the comparisons of the biochar catalysts respectively originated from the whole biomass and nanocellulose are needed to be further performed, and the extraction of nanocellulose from agricultural or woody biomass wastes should be centralized to lower the cost of biochar production. Moreover, the biochar yield is only 18 wt% in current work, so the carbonization efficiency of biomass needs to be well improved. In addition, the regeneration or disposal methods for the spent biochar catalysts may be a research target and also a challenge although it is low-cost and eco-friendly, and the regeneration under microwave-assisted process in the presence of some agents like air is a recommended trial. The probe into the interaction mechanism of pyrolysis volatiles and active sites on biochar at the molecular levels by using density functional theory (DFT) will be highly recommended, as these investigations are important for the design, modification, and optimization of the biochar catalysts."
10,Conclusions,"This study developed a simple and cost-effective biochar toward the co-production of phenolic monomers and H2 from biomass. The results showed that the phenol was enhanced to 53.77 mg/mL from 15.76 mg/mL of non-catalytic process. The cresols were intensified to 44.51 mg/mL from 20.95 mg/mL of non-catalytic pyrolysis. The H2 was up to 85.32 vol%, which was about two times higher than 45.53 vol% of non-catalytic. Despite 15 cycles reuse, the biochar is still enabled to keep a stable selectivity. The proposed mechanism unveiled that the water not only mattered in the phenols formation but also provided a source of H2."
