0,Introduction,"The hydrogenation of diesters, including oxalate, carbonate, acetate and maleate, has drawn great attention as an efficient way to produce multiple kinds of chemicals, such as methanol, ethanol, dihydric alcohol and other pharmaceutical intermediates. However, the diesters generally possess multiple CO or CO bonds, their hydrogenation reactions generally include several cascade reactions. For instance, the dimethyl oxalate (DMO) hydrogenation reaction comprises several continuous reactions, including DMO hydrogenation to intermediate methyl glycolate (MG), MG hydrogenation to ethylene glycol (EG) and deep hydrogenation of EG to ethanol [1,2]. Therefore, it is also a significant challenge for the selective hydrogenation to obtain target products. Copper-based catalysts were extensively investigated in the hydrogenation of esters due to their high activity toward CO and CO bonds [1]. In order to enhance hydrogenation reactivity and selectivity, the supports, such as MCM-41 [2], SBA-15 [4,9,12], KIT-6 [5] and HMS [6–8] with orderly channels, were introduced to fabricate Cu0 and Cu+ sites to activate H2 and polarize the CO bond of esters, respectively. For instance, Deng et al. presented a series of Cu/MCM-41 catalysts by ammonia evaporation method, which significantly enhanced the dispersion of copper species compared with impregnation method [4]. Nanoarrays Cu/SiO2 catalysts with embedded active species in monolithic channels were also prepared and exhibited excellent activity and promoted mass transfer efficiency [3,4]. Researchers also found that addition of a second metal could change the crystalline size of Cu, and improve the dispersion of Cu, such as Cu-Au [9], Cu-Ag [10], Cu-Pd [11], and Cu-Pt [12], which enhanced their hydrogenation reactivity and thermal stability. Zhao et al. have reported a Ni containing Cu–Ni bimetallic nano-catalyst, achieving an excellent selectivity toward ethanol (90 %) for the DMO hydrogenation under 2.5 MPa and 553 K [13]. Le et al. have investigated the influence of zinc doping and found that Zn makes a significant influence on the texture and structure of the catalysts [14]. Zheng et al. have found that the catalyst with 1.0 wt% La loading exhibits the highest catalytic activity, which attributed to the formation of CuOLa bond enhancing the stability of Cu2+ under reductive atmosphere [15]. The surface acidity of catalysts is also an important factor to improve the selectivity of the products in the ester hydrogenation, since the acidic sites could polarize the CO bond via the electron lone pair in oxygen, thus improving the reactivity of the ester group. The metal oxides, such as B2O3, and ZrO2, have been used as promoters to controllably tune the surface acidity of catalysts, which further improve the selectivity of the desirable product [16–18]. Our previous work has introduced B2O3 species by impregnation on Cu/SiO2 catalysts with improved selectivity and stability, which could be ascribed to the suitable acid sites and high dispersion of copper species by B2O3 doping [18–20]. Tian et al. prepared Cux–Mgy–Zrz/SiO2 catalysts, also showing better catalytic performance after doping with MgO and ZrO2 due to the change of surface acidity [21]. Alumina and zirconia supported Cu catalysts were both appeared to exhibit high activity and hydrothermal stability, which were frequently used in CO and CO2 hydrogenation [22–24]. For CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, the modification of Al2O3 can provide modest acidity sites as well as decreased copper cluster size [24]. The modification of aluminum on silica surface such as SBA-15 [25] and MCM-41 [26] also illuminated that it could strengthen the acidity and the interaction between copper species and the supports. Therefore, using metal oxides as promoters may controllably tune the acidity of catalysts and enhance the interaction between copper species and the supports, which further improves the catalytic performance of esters hydrogenation. However, the reported work primarily used the surface doping or impregnation to introduce metal oxides into the catalysts. The incorporation of the metal oxides into the silica framework may facilitate the dispersion and stability of promoters. Herein, the silica precursor (silica sol) was first modified with aluminum salts to prepare CuAl/SiO2 catalysts by a hydrothermal method. The aluminum content in the silica sol was controlled to investigate its effect on hydrogenation of diesters (e.g., DMO and EC) to selectively produce EG and ethanol. All the catalysts were systematically characterized for a better understanding of their structures, surface chemistry and structure-activity relationship. The role of aluminum promotion on the catalytic performances was also discussed through correlating the surface concentration of the moderate-intensity acidic sites with the selectivity of EG, ethanol and methanol in DMO and EC hydrogenation reaction, respectively."
1,Experiment,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Dimethyl oxalate was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai) Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Ethylene carbonate was purchased from Meryer (Shanghai) Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. Methanol, 1,4-Diocan, ammonia aqueous solution, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (>99 %) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (>99 %) were bought from Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd. 30 wt% colloidal silica was from Qingdao Yijida Chemical Co. Ltd.; Hydrogen gas (99.99 %) was from Tianyi Gas Co., Ltd. All the chemicals above were used as received and without any purification."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The colloidal silica solution (30 wt%) was first added by Al(NO3)3·9H2O with the Al weight content of 0.5 %∼2 %. The Cu/SiO2 and CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Firstly, 2.8 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 240 mL of deionized water and then added with 24 mL of 25 % ammonia aqueous solution. 1.72 g of Al containing colloidal silica solution were added to the solution. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, the slurry was transferred into the Teflon-lined autoclaves for hydrothermal synthesis. After heating in an oven at 413 K for 10 h, the products were washed with deionized water and ethanol to pH = 7. Finally, the catalysts were dried and calcined at 723 K for 4 h. The calcined samples were denoted as Cu/SiO2 and CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts, where x represents the weight content of Al (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 %)."
4,Catalytic characterization,"2.3 Catalytic characterization Textural properties were measured at 77 K by N2-physisorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument. The specific surface areas were calculated from the isotherms using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and pore size distributions were calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The actual copper and aluminum contents were tested through inductively coupling plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were implemented by the Empyrean diffraction meter using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 35 mA, and the copper particle sizes were calculated by the Scherrer equation. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was determined by Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. After pretreated in argon atmosphere at 393 K for 1 h, approximately 50 mg of catalysts were reduced in 10 vol% H2-Ar (30 mL min−1) with the temperature increased from 323 K to 1073 K (heating rate of 10 K min−1). The TCD was employed to determine the amount of hydrogen consumption during this process. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was carried out on a FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet, iS50). The materials were finely dried in oven and grounded before dispersed in KBr powder. The spectra range was started from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1 with a resolution ratio of 0.5 cm−1. The CO2 and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was carried out on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. For qualified evaluation of basic sites or acid sites, 100 mg of catalysts were placed in a quartz U tube and reduced in 10 vol% H2-Ar (30 mL min−1) at 623 K for 4 h before the gas switched to CO2 or NH3, which passed through the U tube for 1 h to reach adsorption saturation. After weak adsorption removed by argon sweeping, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 973 K at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under argon atmosphere. The specific surface area of metallic copper species was qualified by dissociative N2O adsorption and H2-TPR reverse titration. Typically, after pretreated in Ar at 473 K for 2 h, 50 mg of catalysts were reduced with the temperature from 323 K to 973 K (this process was defined as total TPR). Then the atmosphere switched to 10 vol%N2O-Ar mixture under room temperature and pulse titrated for 2 h, oxidizing copper species to higher valence states. Finally, the reduction process repeated with the temperature increased to 573 K (this process was defined as Surface TPR). The dispersion (DCu), specific surface area (SCu) and particle size of copper species (dCu) were calculated by the following formula: (1) D C u % = 2 × H 2 c o n s u m p t i o n ( S u r f a c e T P R ) H 2 c o n s u m p t i o n ( T o t a l T P R ) × 100 % (2) S C u 0 m 2 g - 1 C u = D C u × N a v M C u × 1.46 × c ≈ 649 × D C u (3) d C u n m = 6 S C u × ρ C u ≈ 1.0 D C u Where assumed Cu species are sphere and contains 1.46 × 1019 individual each square meter. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed at the XAFS station in the 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) operating at about 150 mA and 2.2 GeV. The absorption spectra of the Cu K-edge of the samples and reference compounds were recorded at room temperature in transition mode. The harmonic content in monochrome beamline was reduced with a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. The back-subtracted EXAFS function was converted to k-space and weighted by k3 to compensate for the diminishing amplitude. The Fourier transforming of k3-weighted EXAFS data was performed in the range of k = 3–11 Å−1, using a Hanning function window."
5,Catalytic performance,"2.4 Catalytic performance The vapor-phase hydrogenation of DMO and EC were tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor (length of 50 cm, inner diameter of 0.8 cm and external diameter of 1.6 cm). Typically, 0.4 g of the catalyst (40–60 mesh) was placed in the middle section of the reactor. After reduced in H2 atmosphere at 623 K for 4 h and cooled to the reaction temperature of 553 K, DMO (15 wt% dissolved in methanol) was injected to the reactor. The H2/DMO molar ratio, reaction pressure and weight hour space velocity (WHSV) were 200, 2.5 MPa and 0.2 h−1, respectively. Same reduction condition was applied to the hydrogenation of EC, while the reaction temperature is 453 K and the raw material is 10 wt% EC dissolved in 1,4-diocan. In this case, the H2/EC molar ratio, reaction pressure and WHSV were 200, 3 MPa and 0.2 h−1, respectively. The reaction products were analyzed by GC SP-2100A equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-WAX capillary column (Agilent Technologies Company, 30 m × 0.250 mm). All the experimental data were averaged from three to six separate GC samples to ensure the repeatability of the data."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic activity of DMO and EC hydrogenation over the Cu/SiO2 and CuAl/SiO2 catalysts,"3.1 Catalytic activity of DMO and EC hydrogenation over the Cu/SiO2 and CuAl/SiO2 catalysts The catalytic performance over the Cu/SiO2 and CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts were investigated to understand their catalytic activity of DMO and EC hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), all the catalysts exhibited a 100 % DMO conversion. The yield of ethanol raised while the yield of C3-C4 products (including n-propanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethyl ether) declined with the increase of Al content on the catalysts. The optimal ethanol yield of 94.35 % was achieved over the Cu1.0Al/SiO2 catalyst at a WHSV of 0.2 h−1. The catalytic performance of the EC hydrogenation over the CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts was shown in Fig. 1(b). The EC hydrogenation reaction involved several cascade reactions, including hydrogenating EC to methanol and EG and further hydrogenating EG to ethanol [27]. All the catalysts obtained approximately 100 % conversion toward EC. With the increase of the Al contents, the yield of EG and ethanol fluctuated slightly, while the yield of another primary product, methanol, showed a noticeable change. Minor amount of aluminum enhanced the yield of methanol, which inclined from 45 % to 64 %, but further doping inhibited this phenomenon. This can be ascribed to that larger copper crystal suppressed the production of methanol. The optimal methanol yield of 64.48 % and EG yield of 95.37 % were achieved over the Cu0.5Al/SiO2 catalyst at a WHSV of 0.2 h−1."
8,Physic-chemical properties of the Cu/SiO2 and CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts,"3.2 Physic-chemical properties of the Cu/SiO2 and CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts 3.2.1 Textural properties The textural properties of the Cu/SiO2 and CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts are vital for the catalytic performance. The effects of the aluminum additive on the physical properties of catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 . All the samples displayed reversible Langmuir type IV isotherms in Fig. 2(a) with H1-type hysteresis loops, which illustrated that the catalysts prepared by hydrothermal method possess mesopores. The introduction of aluminum didn’t significantly change the pore structures. The board hysteresis loops in the isotherms of all the catalysts indicated the wide distribution of pore diameter, which was consist with the pore size distribution curves in Fig. 2(b). As listed in Table 1, the BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of Cu/SiO2 were 483.01 m2/g, 0.89 cm3/g and 6.29 nm, respectively. With the increase the content of aluminum, the SBET and Dpore slightly decreased from 369.08–278.94 m2/g and from 5.77 to 4.03 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the decrease of Vpore from 0.61 to 0.24 cm3/g could be attributed to the entrance of aluminum oxide particles into the mesopores of the SiO2, which was not leading to the destruction of pore structures. The ICP-OES results in Table 1 showed that the copper contents of all the catalysts were consistent, and the aluminum contents of all the samples were similar to the target value when the content was lower than 1.5 %. High aluminum content led to a clear deviation, which may be resulted from the breakaway of the excessive and unstable aluminum oxide on the support. The N2O pulse titration results illustrated that the addition of aluminum oxide could appreciably enhance the surface area (from 20.5 to 26.3 m2/g) and the dispersion of copper species (from 28.9 to 37.0%), respectively. Excessive incorporation in the silica would impair this benefit but still better than the original Cu/SiO2 catalyst. Associated with the result of FT-IR, it could be proposed that partial copper species strongly bonded with SiO2 were replaced by aluminum. The copper could further effuse on the surface of the support and form much smaller copper nanoparticles, and thus caused the decreased particle sizes of copper and the increased Cu dispersion. 3.2.2 XRD patterns XRD patterns, which are helpful to understand the structure change and activity sites evolution, are depicted in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3(a) showed that no significant CuO diffraction peaks were observed on the fresh Cu/SiO2 catalyst. The main peaks centered at 2θ = 20.04, 30.61, 36.07, 56.17, and 62.15° can be indexed to the CuSiO3·2H2O phase (JCPDS NO. 11-0322) [28]. During the hydrothermal process, the [Cu(NH3)4]2+ in the solution vigorously reacted with the surface hydroxyl groups on the silica support, and then the copper silicate was formed. With the addition of Al into the catalysts, these broadening peaks still maintained until the amount of aluminum increased to 2 %, which could be concluded that the aluminum introduction doesn’t destroy the stable structures of copper silicate. After the reduction and reaction, great differences were observed over the used catalysts in Fig. 3(b). The peaks of copper silicates were replaced by a wide diffraction peak of amorphous silica at ∼23°. Meanwhile, several obvious diffraction peaks at around 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1° emerged, which are indexed to the (111), (200), (220) lattice face of Cu (JCPDS 04-0836), respectively. In addition, the peak at 36.5° belongs to the (111) lattice face of Cu2O (JCPDS 05-0667). There were no obvious peaks of CuO observed on the used samples, suggesting that CuO particles were either completely reduced or highly dispersed on the support. The coexistence of Cu and Cu2O could be regarded as the reduction of CuO and copper silicates species during reduction process, respectively, since the strong interaction between silica and copper species in the copper silicates hampered the further reduction of Cu2O to metallic Cu. The particle sizes of copper on the used catalysts were calculated and listed in Table 1. The results showed that the moderate amount of aluminum suppressed the agglomeration of copper species during the reaction, while excessive aluminum on the catalysts could not make such effect. 3.2.3 NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD results In order to evaluate the strength and quantities of acidic and basic sites on catalysts with the introduction of aluminum, NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD were employed and the results were shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . As shown in Fig. 4(a), all the catalysts presented three similar peaks in NH3-TPD profiles. The peak in low temperature could be interpreted by the desorption of ammonia with weak adsorption on SiOH [29,30]. The desorption peak at 500−600 K was associated with the ammonia adsorbed on the acidic hydroxide group of SiOHAl, which was agree with the result reported by Hidalgo et al. [31]. The third peak at high temperature might be concluded to ammonia adsorbed on copper species [32]. The CO2-TPD profiles of all the samples in Fig. 4(b) possessed two peaks. The low-temperature peak at 400 K could be ascribed to the weak adsorption of CO2 on the catalysts. The second peak at ∼780 K could be attributed to the strong adsorption of CO2 on the surface basic sites [33]. Depending on the NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD results, the amounts of acid sites and basic sites with different strength of acidity and basicity were calculated and listed in Table 2. It was easy to find that the amount of total acid sites increased with the aluminum concentration. With the increase of the aluminum content, the amount of weak acid sites fluctuated slightly while the amount of strong acid sites increased from 0.35 to 0.49 mmol/g. Meanwhile, a little bit of Al (e.g., 0.5 wt%), could significantly increase the acid sites in medium strength region, verifying the formation of acidic hydroxide group of SiOHAl. In addition, the introduction of aluminum led to a notably reduction of total basic sites from 0.36 to 0.19 mmol/g, indicating a successful suppression of the basicity over the catalysts. Notably, high content of Al doping increased the amounts of basic and acidic sites simultaneously, which could be due to amphoteric properties of the Al2O3. 3.2.4 H2-TPR results The H2-TPR experiment was implemented to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 , all the samples exhibited a reduction peak at ∼535 K. Our previous work showed that the copper silicates reduced to Cu+ occurred at around 510 K (the further reduction to Cu0 at a tough condition of 873 K), which is overlapped with the temperature for the reduction of well-dispersed CuO to Cu0 at around 515 K [34–36]. Therefore, the single peak at ∼535 K for the catalysts in this work was ascribed to a combined reduction of highly dispersed CuO to Cu0 and copper silicates to Cu+. The higher reduction temperatures of the Cu/SiO2 and CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts here (∼535 K) than that of Cu/SiO2 catalysts in other literatures (∼510 K) could be attributed to the strong metal support interaction of copper silicates species prepared by hydrothermal method. And the increased reduction temperatures in CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts in Fig. 5 are probably due to the altered interaction between Cu and SiO2 caused by Al addition. 3.2.5 FT-IR results To further investigate the influence of aluminum doping on the surface group information of the copper-based catalysts, FT-IR spectra of the catalysts with different contents of Al were collected and shown in Fig. 6 . The peaks at 1106 cm−1, 800 cm−1 and 475 cm−1 appeared in all the samples, which were indexed to the asymmetric stretching vibration, symmetric stretching vibration and bending mode of SiOSi bonds in the amorphous silica, respectively [37]. Similarly, the characteristic δ OH vibration bond of 674 cm−1 and the shoulder peak at 1042 cm−1 were also observed over all the catalysts, indicating that the copper silicates component were successfully formed during the hydrothermal process. It should be noted that the ν SiO band belonged to SiO2 at 800 cm−1 shifted toward lower frequency with the increase of Al content. According to FKS regulation [38], due to the higher length of AlO bond (1.75 Å) compared with Si-O bond (1.61 Å) and the less electronegativity of Al, this red-shift implyed the formation of AlO bond. This bond substituted a trace amount of SiO bond in the prceeding copper silicates’ structure, further causing the effusion of copper species. This also could be evidenced by the increased Cu dispersion in Table 1. But excess substitution of aluminum will lead to Cu aggregation due to the detached copper tends to form larger cluster. This was in accordance with the results from NH3-TPD profiles and N2O titration. 3.2.6 Cu K-edge XANES and EXAFS To gain further insights into the change of local coordination structures, we performed the XAFS experiments including XANES and EXAFS (Fig. 7 ). Obviously, the adsorption edge and white line feature of the Cu K-edge XANES spectra of the CuxAl/SiO2 catalysts are similar with those of Cu/SiO2 in Fig. 7(a), suggesting that the valence state and coordination environment of Cu were slightly changed after the decoration of Al. The radial structure functions (RSFs) of Cu K-edge derived from EXAFS spectra of used catalysts are shown in Fig. 7(b). The first coordination shell at ∼0.15 nm (without phase-scattering shift correction) was attributed to the scattering pathway of the CuO bond, and the shell at ∼0.27 nm could be ascribed to the CuCu coordination. Notably, the amplitudes of both the CuO and CuCu shell, associated with the coordination number, firstly lowered and then increased as the Al increased. This indicated that the addition of Al was beneficial to the Cu dispersion, and the Cu0.5Al/SiO2 exhibited the highest Cu dispersion, which is in accordance with the N2O titration results in Table 1. Thus, the Al is not decorated on the surface of the catalyst, but definitely incorporated in the local structures of silica to regulate the physio-chemical properties."
9,Discussions,"3.3 Discussions 3.3.1 The role of aluminum incorporation on the acidic sites and catalytic performance During the hydrothermal process, the Cu(NO3)2 reacted with ammonia to form cuprammonia complexes ([Cu(NO3)4]2+), which further clung on or reacted with the silica to generate the CuO and Cu silicates, respectively [39]. According to the above experimental results, the generation of acidic sites were according to the following paths: Al(NO3)3 firstly grafted on the SiO2 support and then formed Al2O3 through calcination. Meanwhile, some aluminum species interacted with the surface SiO bond during the deposition-precipitation process, which formed SiOHAl bond and further influenced the yield of products. Moreover, the formed SiOHAl is also a Lewis acidic site, which has been proved to polarize the CO/CO bond in DMO or EC via the electron lone pair in oxygenand thus promoting the catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions. To gain a better understanding of the correlation between the amounts of aluminum and the catalytic activities, the moderate-intensity acidic amounts and the yield of EtOH and MeOH in different reactions as functions of weight contents of Al are illustrated in Fig. 8 . In Fig. 8(a), the Cu1.0Al/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest EtOH yield in the hydrogenation of DMO. As we all known, ethanol is the product of deep hydrogenation, the yield of which is dependent on the dissociation rate of H2 in DMO hydrogenation. As reported [40,41], Lewis acidic sites could polarize the CO/CO bond via the electron lone pair in oxygen, while the Cu0 sites can activate H2. In our system, the amounts of SiOHAl, a medium and Lewis acidic site that can improve the reactivity of DMO, increased with the elevated Al content (Fig. 8(a)). But from Table 1, the surface Cu0 first increased and then decreased with the Al doping. Combining with these two points, the selectivity of ethanol increased first and then decreased with the elevated of the amount of Al. In Fig. 8(b), Cu0.5Al/SiO2 exhibited the highest MeOH yield in the hydrogenation of EC. Small amounts of aluminum can enhance the performance by regulating the copper grain size and the acidic density of catalysts. However, abundant aluminum oxide will lead to the side reaction as well as a destruction of the pristine structure of the Cu/SiO2 catalysts. In summary, through correlating the textural properties, the calculated particle size of copper species, and the acidic sites and basic sites amounts with the catalytic performance, we can concluded that the textural structure, the particle size of copper and the acidic sites corporately played a vital role in the catalytic activity of the CuAl/SiO2 catalysts during the hydrogenation of esters. 3.3.2 The role of aluminum incorporation on the catalytic stability The catalytic stability of catalysts is great significant for the hydrogenation of DMO/EC from the viewpoint of further industrialization. Thus, the Cu/SiO2 and Cu1.0Al/SiO2 catalysts were selected to test the long-term stability for the hydrogenation of DMO to ethanol, which could also reflect the influence of doping aluminum. As shown in Fig. 9 , both the two catalysts exhibited a conversion of 100% toward DMO, while the yield of the target product, ethanol, presented different variation trend. The Cu1.0Al/SiO2 exhibited a steady yield of ethanol (92 %–94 %) during the 40-h stability test. However, the yield of ethanol dropped from 85 % to 78 % on the Cu/SiO2 without aluminum. The Cu1.0Al/SiO2 catalyst with SiOHAl exhibited superior catalytic stability than the Cu/SiO2 catalyst, implying that the SiOHAl bond can enhance the catalytic stability for hydrogenation. The activity decline over copper-based catalysts during the long-term hydrogenation is generally caused by the aggregation of copper species, which will lead to a decreased copper dispersion and changed valence of Cu [42]. Previous researches illustrated the doping of acid oxides can also promoted the stability of catalysts due to the inhibition of Cu agglomeration [18,23]. Similarly, as displayed in Fig. 3(b) and Table 1, it can be concluded that the moderate amount of Al can decrease the degree of aggregation, which is probably the origin of the excellent selectivity toward ethanol and suppression of the side-reaction over the CuAl/SiO2 catalysts after the long-term reaction."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the CuAl/SiO2 catalysts were successfully prepared using the aluminum modified silica sol as the support by a hydrothermal method. And the catalysts were investigated for catalyzing the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) and ethylene carbonate (EC) to ethanol and ethylene glycol (EG), respectively. The results showed that the incorporation of Al in the silica could tune the surface acidity, reduce the Cu crystalline size and alter the textural properties of the catalysts, thus intrinsically facilitating the esters hydrogenation. The Cu1.0Al/SiO2 catalysts exhibited the highest selectivity of ethanol (94 %) in the DMO hydrogenation, while Cu0.5Al/SiO2 exhibited the highest selectivity of EG (∼95 %) and methanol (65 %) in the EC hydrogenation. Moreover, the addition of Al can boost the catalytic stability for hydrogenation reactions by inhibiting the aggregation of copper species. These findings provide an easy and accessible way to design catalysts with high activity and selectivity in esters hydrogenation reactions."
