0,Introduction,"Consumption of fossil fuels is responsible to increase greenhouse gas emissions which have a great impact on the environment leading to global warming. Moreover, the limited reserves of fossil fuels drive the thinking towards alternate sources. The growing interest in the renewable energy to replace the conventional fossil fuels shows a path to produce clean fuel for transportation and other energy utilities [1]. Fuels from renewable waste biomass are suitable alternatives to the conventional fossil fuels. Waste or lignocellulosic biomass is a potential renewable energy source to meet the increasing energy demands [2]. In addition, fuels derived from waste biomass are considered carbon-neutral as the net CO2 released from their combustion is utilized by the plants during photosynthesis [3]. Hydrogen is a clean fuel as its combustion results in water which makes it attractive compared to other gaseous fuels. Hydrogen is not readily available in nature and is generated by the reforming of natural gas. Exploiting lignocellulosic biomass could be a suitable option to produce H2 through gasification technologies [4]. Compared to thermochemical gasification that consumes large amounts of energy for biomass conversion, supercritical water (or hydrothermal) gasification is relatively energy-efficient with no additional requirement of biomass drying. Lignocellulose biomass components can break down into simple molecules during supercritical water gasification (SCWG) to produce synthesis gas or syngas [5]. Syngas (H2 + CO) is the main product of SCWG of biomass and can be used as a clean fuel or in the production of diesel fuel via gas-to-liquid (GTL) technologies such as Fisher–Tropsch catalysis or syngas fermentation [2]. A fluid cannot be liquefied beyond its critical temperature irrespective of the pressure applied. Every fluid is characterized by a unique critical point. With the operating temperature and pressure greater than its critical point, a fluid is termed as a supercritical fluid. The low-cost availability of water, its non-toxic nature and critical point (374 °C and 22.1 MPa) near to many chemical processes makes it an ideal solvent for many chemical reactions [6]. Supercritical water (SCW) has high kinetic energy like gases and densities similar to that of liquids. A combination of gas and liquid like properties makes SCW superior to various conventional solvents. The increase in temperature over the critical temperature of water weakens the hydrogen bonding between the molecules and also contributes to H2 production [7]. The dielectric constant of SCW is much lower than that of normal water which makes SCW a non-polar solvent. The tuning of thermophysical properties of water with temperature and pressure makes it miscible with organics and gases forming a single homogenous phase appropriate for SCWG [8,9]. Supercritical water gasification of biomass in various reactor configurations such as batch, tubular and continuous stirred tank reactors has been investigated in the past and current years. A new emerging reactor configuration to gasify the biomass in fluidized bed at supercritical conditions has been found to be attractive to overcome the current technical problems of the SCWG processes. This review is focused on discussing these various SCWG reactor configurations for H2 production from biomass. In addition, different process parameters are also known to influence the yields of H2 during SCWG of biomass. In a study by Lu et al. [10], the parameters that influenced the SCWG of corn cobs followed the order: temperature > pressure > feedstock concentration > residence time. Hence, this paper also presents an overview of the process parameters such as temperature, pressure, feed concentration, catalyst type and loading along with reactor configurations that influence the overall reaction mechanisms and H2 yields."
1,Supercritical water gasification of biomass components,"Lignocellulose biomass is the non-edible part of the plants that is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [11]. Lignocellulosic biomass can be categorized into agricultural and forest residues, dedicated energy crops and municipal paper waste. Lignocellulose forms a complex network in the plant cell wall that is held together by covalent bonding, intermolecular bridges and van der Waals forces. A lignocellulosic biomass typically has 30–60% cellulose, 20–40% hemicellulose and 15–25% lignin [12]. Gasification can be defined as the conversion of biomass to H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 through high temperature (>700 °C) reactions with controlled amounts of oxygen and/or steam. Supercritical water gasification is a type of biomass gasification where supercritical water (374 °C and 22.1 MPa) is used as the medium. Thus, the main difference between SCWG and other thermochemical gasification techniques is related to their gasification medium i.e., supercritical water or inert gas and/or steam. Supercritical water has a dual role as a reactant and medium in the gasification of biomass. The probability of generation of H+ and OH– ions at high density is greater at supercritical conditions creating an environment for hydrolysis and pyrolysis reactions [13]. Free radicals are also generated at high temperatures over the supercritical temperatures [14]. Production of H2 through SCWG of biomass irrespective of the moisture content makes it superior to other conventional thermochemical routes. The added advantage of SCWG of biomass is its high pressure H2 production which cuts down the compression energy costs during its storage [1]. Around the supercritical point, water has ability to form ions which helps in degradation of biomass components [8]. Lignocellulosic biomass which consists of cellulose and hemicellulose gets dissolved at high temperature and pressure in SCW. These molecules further breakdown to simple sugars which are gasified by increasing the reaction temperature and pressure [5]. Lignin in biomass converts to phenolic compounds which are further reformed to simple gases such as H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 [15]. Since diverse groups of compounds are produced from cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, it is therefore necessary to study the behavior of the intermediates and their degradation or reformation routes to gases. Prior to understanding the mechanisms, behavior and the breakdown of the complex lignocellulosic biomass in supercritical conditions, it is essential to investigate the SCWG of their model compounds such as cellulose, glucose, glycerol, lignin and phenolics. Some of the vital reactions that occur during the gasification of biomass in SCW are as given below. The overall reactions of biomass gasification are mentioned below: (1) CH x O y + ( 2 − y ) H 2 O → CO 2 + ( 2 − y + x / 2 ) H 2 (2) CH x O y + ( 1 − y ) H 2 O → CO + ( 1 − y + x / 2 ) H 2 Cellulose hydrolysis: (3) ( C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n + n H 2 O → n C 6 H 12 O 6 Glucose reforming reaction: (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 6 CO + 6 H 2 Hydrolysis of lignin: (5) ( C 10 H 10 O 3 ) n + n H 2 O → n C 10 H 12 O 4 → Phenolics Steam reforming reaction: (6) Phenolics + H 2 O → CO + CO 2 + H 2 Water–gas shift reaction: (7) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 Methanation reaction of CO: (8) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O Methanation reaction of CO2: (9) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Hydrogenation reaction: (10) CO + 2 H 2 → CH 4 + 0.5 O 2 Steam reforming reaction is a reaction taking place within the SCWG system where the biomass degradation products such as phenolics react in SCW and breakdown to CO, CO2 and H2. The reforming reactions produce CO, CO2 and H2, whereas CH4 is produced by methanation and hydrogenation reactions. Water–gas shift reaction (WGS) is another significant reaction of SCWG of biomass. Fig. 1 illustrates a simplified mechanistic approach for lignocellulosic biomass conversion to different product gases in SCW conditions. In the initial step, waste biomass degrades to sugars, guaiacols, syringols, phenolics etc. While cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolyze to yield C5 and C6 sugars, lignin degrades to phenolic components including guaiacols and syringols. In the SCWG regime, these degradation products further convert to simpler compounds such as acids (e.g., carboxylic, succinic, acetic etc.), alcohols (e.g., coumaryl, coniferyl, sinapyl etc.), phenols, aromatics and aldehydes. As acids mostly arise from the decomposition of sugars in supercritical environments, alcohols, aromatics and aldehydes result from denaturation of ligneous components (i.e. phenols). With the aid of different heterogeneous catalysts, gases such as H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 are produced based on WGS, methanation, hydrogenation and other reactions [5]. In addition to the above-mentioned gases, traces of hydrocarbons such as C n H2n+2 components are produced. Depending on the feed (biomass) concentration, operating conditions and the presence of catalyst, H2 with different concentrations can be obtained. Figs. 2 and 3 show the gas yields at various temperatures and feed concentrations of biomass during SCWG."
2,Cellulose,"2.1 Cellulose Cellulose is a glucose polymer consisting of β (1, 4) linked d-glucose subunits that are synthesized in the plants' cell membrane and aggregated by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces [16]. The linear nature of cellulose molecules is responsible for forming both intra and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding [17]. Hemicellulose is a mixture of polysaccharides composed of C5 and C6 sugars such as glucose, mannose, xylose and arabinose along with sugar acids such as methylglucuronic and galaturonic acids [18]. Cellulose constitutes the largest fraction in biomass and its hydrolysis results in the formation of C6 sugars, mostly glucose. Since glucose is a monomer of cellulose, it is the main product of cellulose decomposition in SCW [19]. Glucose undergoes hydrolysis at near and above the critical temperatures [14]. Many reaction mechanisms have been described for SCWG of glucose [20–23]. Products of different phases are obtained from SCWG of glucose. Gas products are produced at higher temperatures and typically consist of H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and traces of hydrocarbons. On the other hand, coke and char are formed due to the following reactions: (11) 2 CO ↔ C + CO 2 (12) CO + H 2 → C + H 2 O (13) CO 2 + 2 H 2 → C + 2 H 2 O Heavy aromatics such as oil-based liquids are the result of dehydration reactions of smaller reactive intermediates. Barbier et al. [24] studied glucose (2 wt.%) gasification at near critical temperature (370 °C) and pressure of 25 MPa in a batch reactor and proposed that lighter reactive components undergo hydration reactions to form heavy condensed products and aromatic compounds. The study also revealed that fragmentation and dehydration reactions compete with each other and the products' yield depend on the operating parameters. This is in agreement with SCW gasification of glucose by Catallo et al. [25]. Temperature is a key parameter which decides the yield of liquid products in SCWG of glucose. Low temperatures SCWG (around critical point) mostly results in acids, aldehydes, ketones, furfurals etc., whereas at high temperature SCWG (∼750 °C) results in recalcitrant compounds such as phenol and acetic acid [21,26]. Three reaction mechanisms have been proposed for the SCWG of glucose by Goodwin and Rorrer [21]. The first mechanism is the degradation of glucose into acetic acid and propenoic acid which are further degraded into gases at high temperatures (∼750 °C). This is supported by the other studies [27,28]. The second way is the glucose conversion to 5-hydroxymethyl furfural followed by its dehydration to 2,5-hexanedione which further hydrolyzes to 3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one. These intermediates were also observed in other studies of glucose gasification at supercritical conditions [26,29]. Another mechanism to produce syngas is via phenol formation. The intermediates formed are degraded to simple gases such as H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 [30]. SCWG of glucose and phenol mixture has also been studied and it is found that trace amounts of phenol in glucose have major impact on H2 yields by interacting with the intermediates [31]. In gasification experiments with phytomass systems, Sinag et al. [32] found acetic acid and formic acid as the intermediates which further degrade to gaseous products via the following reactions. (14) HCOOH → H 2 + CO 2 (15) HCOOH → H 2 O + CO (16) CH 3 COOH → CH 4 + CO 2"
3,Glycerol,"2.2 Glycerol Glycerol is another model compound used to understand the behavior of biomass at near critical temperatures. This is due to the fact that glucose forms ring structured compounds such as furfurals with different functional groups [2]. Acrolein is a key intermediate in the degradation of glycerol in SCW [33]. However, the reaction mechanisms are dependent on the operating conditions [14,34]. Degradation of glycerol at near and supercritical temperatures has been demonstrated by Buhler et al. [34]. It was found that ionic reactions were favored at high pressures with the formation of aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and propionaldehyde) and acrolein. On the other hand, at high temperatures free radical degradation reactions were significant and resulted in products such as acrolein, methanol, allyl alcohol along with H2, CO and CO2. Only low concentrations of glycerol (<2 wt.%) are completely gasified to H2-rich gas [35]. Kinetic experiments on glycerol degradation revealed that acrolein and acetaldehyde are the major products at 400 °C and 33 MPa [36]. Guo et al. [37] investigated glycerol degradation at supercritical conditions (440–600 °C and 25 MPa) to produce H2. They proposed that glycerol is initially converted into acrolein and hydroxyl acetone but with an increase in temperature, the breakdown of C–C bonds is favored, forming formaldehyde and acetaldehyde along with H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. These intermediates are degraded to produce H2-rich syngas by steam reforming reactions or pyrolysis."
4,Lignin,"2.3 Lignin Lignin in the biomass acts as a binding agent that holds cellulose and hemicellulose together, providing firmness to the lignocellulosic network. This makes the biomass resistant to various chemicals and enzymes [18]. Lignin is a highly branched phenyl propane polymer linked with C–O–C and C–C bonds. Lignin also contains phenolic, methoxyl, hydroxyl and terminal aldehyde groups in the side chain. Three alcohols such as p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols are the building blocks of lignin [2]. The presence of lignin in biomass makes it difficult to obtain cellulose and hemicellulose to produce fermentable sugars. The diversity in structures of lignin which results from various extraction techniques enhances the complexity of its conversion into value-added products [38]. Lignin can be degraded at near critical conditions with short residence times of around 24 s [39]. SCW initiates the formation of ions (H+ and OH–) to dissociate lignin complex into monomers and oligomers which further decompose into useful products [2]. All the higher and substituted phenols (e.g., cresols, guaiacols and catechols) deform to stable phenolic compounds [40,41]. Gasification of lignin results in four phases namely oil (e.g., phenolics, PAHs and heavy hydrocarbons), aqueous (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, catechol and phenols), gas (e.g., H2, CO, CO2 and CH4) and solid phase (i.e., char) [42,43]. The reaction mechanism differs for dissolved and non-dissolved phases of lignin degradation. Hydrolysis and dealkylation reactions are the preliminary reactions in lignin degradation which results in formation of phenols, formaldehydes and the reactive low molecular weight compounds [15]. High molecular weight compounds are formed by cross-linking of reactive low molecular weight components and formaldehyde. Oil phase is a result of homogenous hydrolysis of ether linkages of dissolved phase and from minor catechols which decomposes to phenol and aromatics to form PAHs. A few components such as guaiacols and syringols in oil phase undergo hydrolysis to form aqueous products such as methanol and catechol. Dealkylation of the intermediates of lignin degradation and non-dissolved phases are converted to gases, hydrocarbons, mixture of phenolics and water-soluble products. At higher temperature (>400 °C) with the long residence times (60 min), the monomers and oligomers have a tendency to re-polymerize with the aldehydes to form solid residues (phenolic char) [44]. Addition of phenol to lignin significantly inhibits the re-polymerization of active components from the reactive molecules and thereby reduces the solid residue formation in SCWG of lignin [15]. CH4 and CO2 are the major products of lignin gasification [45]. It has been reported that high temperatures are required for complete gasification of lignin with maximum H2 yields [9]. A few authors have studied the reaction kinetics of lignin and cellulose gasification. In a study by Resende and Savage [46], reactions were carried out under isothermal conditions and constant volume batch reactor for the evaluation of kinetic parameters. They reported that for steam reforming reactions of cellulose and lignin, the rate constants were 1.16 × 10−3 and 5 × 10−4, respectively. In addition, the rate constants for WGS reaction were 6.11 × 10−3 and 2.8 × 10−3 for cellulose and lignin, respectively. The major conclusions from this kinetic study were: (i) formation of H2 via steam reforming reaction in short intervals and via WGS reaction in longer intervals, and (ii) predominant formation of CO, CO2 and CH4 via gasification reactions of biomass intermediate products. Following the kinetic modelling of lignin gasification in SCW, the activation energy for lignin degradation is determined to be 34.3 kJ/mol [47] and 37 kJ/mol [39] depending on the biomass species."
5,Effects of operating parameters,
6,Temperature,"3.1 Temperature Temperature plays a crucial role in the gasification of biomass in SCW. Higher temperature maximizes the gasification efficiency and increases H2 yields [9]. Fig. 1 shows the variation of yields of various components in the product gases with temperature. Ionic product of SCW decides the hydrolysis rate of biomass degradation in supercritical conditions. Beyond the critical point of water (>374 °C and 22.1 MPa), the ionic product yield decreases compared to that of its room temperature and pressure [8]. Density and temperature have major impact on the ionic product. As temperature increases beyond the critical point, density decreases; thus resulting in lower ionic product which favors radical mechanisms [13,14]. The shift of ionic mechanism to free radical mechanism for biomass decomposition with increase in temperature enhances the reactions forming gaseous products [8]. Increasing the temperature of SCWG increases the concentration of free radicals. Promdej and Matsumura [48] have investigated glucose decomposition at 25 MPa pressure in a tubular reactor over the temperature range of 300–460 °C. They have classified the reaction mechanisms of glucose decomposition during SCWG into ionic and radical mechanisms depending on the kinetic reaction rates at different temperatures. The studies revealed that subcritical water gasification was dominated by ionic mechanisms, whereas supercritical water gasification was favored by free radicals. From thermodynamic point of view, the breakdown of complex biomass molecules requires significant amount of energy for endothermic reactions, indicating that high temperatures are essential for supercritical water gasification [38]. The operating temperatures for SCWG of biomass can be categorized into two temperature ranges such as low temperatures (350–500 °C) and high temperatures (500–800 °C). Matsumura et al. [49] investigated the high and low temperature gasification of biomass and their effect on the reaction mechanisms. In the case of low temperature gasification, CH4 is the major product, while H2 is significant at high temperature gasification. Methanation reactions are also profound in low temperature gasification process. The endothermic nature of reforming reactions shifts the gas yields favoring H2 and CO2. Reforming and WGS reactions are the major routes of H2 production from biomass at supercritical conditions. The weak exothermic nature of WGS reaction becomes dominant with the increase in temperature. This results in the increase of H2 and CO2 yields, lowering the yield of CO [5,30]. The yields of CO and CH4 are higher in low temperature gasification, whereas high temperatures favor the yield of H2 and CO2. In a study by Hao et al. [50] glucose was found to completely gasify at high temperature (650 °C) and 25 MPa with a residence time of 3.6 min. The gasification of glucose in tubular reactor has been investigated without the presence of catalyst at different temperatures (600–767 °C) and residence times (15–60 s) [30]. Maximum yields of H2 (11.5 mol/mol of glucose) close to the theoretical yields (12 mol/mol of glucose) were obtained at 767 °C with 1.8 wt.% glucose in 60 s. Increasing temperature (445–600 °C) is found to enhance H2 yields from SCWG of glycerol in tubular reactor at 25 MPa [37]. In the non-catalytic gasification of lignin, H2 and CO yields are greatly affected with temperature. The yields of H2, CH4 and CO2 increases; while CO yield decreases with increase in temperature from 500 to 700 °C [45]."
7,Pressure,"3.2 Pressure The influence of pressure on SCWG of biomass is quite complex. In order to understand the effects of pressure, the critical properties of SCW need to be examined. Density, dielectric constant and ionic product of SCW increase with pressure [8]. Around the critical point (≤22.1 MPa), the ionic reaction mechanisms of water are dominant due to higher densities compared to the densities at supercritical temperatures (>374 °C) [3]. This results in the increased yield of ionic product of water which enhances the hydrolysis rate to break the complex molecules of biomass [51]. This implies that at elevated pressures, ionic reaction mechanisms are favored rather than free radical mechanisms [13,14]. SCW as a reactant medium has a tendency to hinder the reaction progress. The solvent molecules reduce interactions between the solute molecules at high density. With the increase in pressure, density of SCW also increases, forming a solvent cage around the solute molecules. High pressures cause the reactions involving solutes (e.g., coking and polymerization) to restrain, while favoring the reactions involving solute and solvent molecules (e.g., reforming and WGS reactions) [10]. Risk husk has been gasified in SCW at different pressures (22–34 MPa) over a temperature range of 500–700 °C [52]. They observed that pressure has a more pronounced effect on the SCWG of biomass at higher temperatures. Researchers from University of Twente, Netherlands have investigated the effects of pressure (5–45 MPa) on SCWG of glucose and glycerol [5]. It was found that pressure had minimal effect on product gases yield over the pressure range studied. Increasing the density with pressure favors the decomposition rate of lignin [53]. The yields of H2, CH4 and CO2 initially increased with density and remained constant after reaching a certain level at 400 °C [54]. With the increase in pressure from 15 to 27.5 MPa, gasification efficiency of lignin improved. In addition, higher pressure resulted in higher yields of H2 and CH4 with lower CO2 yields [55]. The yields of H2 were found to decrease with increase in pressure for glucose gasification at different temperatures (400–600 °C) [56]."
8,Feed concentration,"3.3 Feed concentration Higher concentrations of biomass have a negative impact on SCWG process. Moreover, it is difficult to gasify higher feedstock amount compared to lower feedstock amounts at same operating conditions [9]. Furthermore, higher concentration of biomass leads to the pumping issues in the refineries leading to plugging problems. Gasification efficiency and product gas yields were found to decrease with feed (sawdust) concentration [51]. Glucose concentration, when increased from 1 to 17% decreases the component (H2, CH4 and CO2) yields in the product gaseous mixture [49]. The results from SCWG of glucose with various concentrations (0.3–0.9 M) also revealed that H2 (1.7–0.7 mol/mol in the presence of activated carbon), CH4 and CO2 yields had reduced yields at 650 °C and 28 MPa [57]. With the variation in glucose concentration from 1 to 5%, yields of H2 decreased at 700 °C and 24.8 MPa [58]. As the concentration of glycerol increased from 10 to 50 wt.%, H2 yields was found to decrease [37]. The yield of H2 reduced with the increment in glucose concentration from 0.1 to 0.8 M at 700 °C and 25 MPa [59]. H2 yields (11.2–5.7 mol/mol) decreased to a greater extent when the glucose concentration increased from 1.8 to 15 wt.% [30]. SCWG of various concentration of alkaline black liquor (9.5–3 wt.%) revealed that H2 yields (24.4–45.1 mol/kg) almost doubled along with the improvement in gasification efficiency [60]. The variation in lignin concentration from 5 to 33 wt.% in SCW at 600 °C and 0.08 g/cm3 improved the yields of CH4, while lowering the yields of H2 and CO [45]. H2 yields are found to be lower with increase in lignin concentration [55]. In a glycerol (5–40 wt.%) gasification experiment by Byrd et al. [61], increasing glycerol concentration was found to increase CH4 yields at the expense of H2."
9,Residence time,"3.4 Residence time The time or duration for which the reactants stay inside the reactor is known as the residence time. The biomass conversion and H2 yields increase with residence time up to a certain extent; thereafter they show no significant change [52]. An increase in residence time, usually in the order of seconds, increases the gasification efficiency as well as conversion, and vice versa [62]. The increase in residence time from 9 to 46 s in SCWG of wood sawdust (2 wt.%) at 700 °C and 25 MPa improved gasification efficiency [51]. Furthermore, the increment in residence time enhanced the yields of H2 [9]. With an increase in the residence time of corn cob gasification, H2 yields improved with lower CO yields [10]. In another study, residence time did not show significant impact on H2 yield at 740 °C and 25 MPa for 1.8 wt.% of glucose [30]. The influence of residence time on SCWG of iso-octane was evaluated and it was reported that H2 yield increased from 1.1 to 5.5 mol/mol when the residence time increased from 6 to 33 s [62]. During SCWG of glycerol (10 wt.%), yields of H2 (0.3–1.3 mol/mol) enhanced with increase in residence time from 5.2 to 9 s at 487 °C and 25 MPa [37]. Higher H2 yields are favored at short and long residence times for non-catalytic and catalytic SCWG of lignin [55,63]. The yields of H2 initially increased and then decreased with residence times in alkali catalytic SCWG of lignin [64]. It is reported that with short residence times (5 s) complete de-polymerization of lignin in SCW can be achieved at 390–450 °C and 25 MPa [47]."
10,Catalysts,"3.5 Catalysts Generation of H2 from SCWG of biomass requires high temperature and pressure. The presence of catalysts reduces the operating costs along with improved selectivity for H2. Moreover, the implication of catalysts reduces the tar and char formation in SCWG. The choice of catalyst to gasify biomass samples in SCW depends on its ability to cleave C–C bonds, progress the WGS reaction and reduce activity towards C–O bond cleavage. The presence of catalyst in reducing the requirement of extreme operating conditions and increasing the high H2 yields makes catalytic SCWG attractive [65]. Different catalysts such as alkali, transitional metals and activated carbon (AC) have been employed for SCWG of biomass [6,8]. Alkali metal catalysts such as Na2CO3, KHCO3, K2CO3, KOH and NaOH have been found to be effective for SCWG of biomass. Alkali metal catalysts improve the WGS reaction and enhance H2 yields [8]. The yields of H2 and CO2 enhanced upon addition of KOH to SCWG of pyrocatechol and industrial inorganic waste, whereas CO yield decreased for both feedstocks [66,67]. Glycine and glycerol have been gasified in SCW at 380–500 °C and 25 MPa in the presence and absence of Na2CO3 [68]. In presence of Na2CO3, a gasification efficiency of 95.8% and 98% with H2 yields of 4.1 and 5.1 mol/mol were obtained for glycine and glycerol, respectively. The role of NaOH has also been studied in SCWG of glucose and some other biomasses in a batch reactor [69]. It was found that H2 volume increased to 80% at 450 °C and 34 MPa. The impact of catalysts (i.e., K2CO3, Trona: NaHCO3·Na2CO3·2H2O, red mud and Raney Ni) on various biomasses (i.e., corn stalk, corn cob and tannery wastes) has been examined [70]. The studies indicated that Trona is effective of all the catalysts tested with maximum yields of H2. K2CO3 and Trona catalysts have also been used to gasify biomasses such as cauliflower residue, tomatoes residue, acorn, extracted acorn and hazelnut shell in SCW at 600 °C and 35 MPa [71]. Trona as compared to K2CO3 improved the yields of H2 and CO2 and reduced the yield of CO to a greater extent. Transition metals exhibit high catalytic activity and are found to be more effective for SCWG of biomass. Ni and Ru perform extensively well in SCWG processes. Various supports for the active catalysts influence their catalytic activity and stability. Ni catalysts can catalyze the aqueous products of biomass to gases [51,72]. Catalytic activity and selectivity of Ni and Ru based catalysts have been tested in SCWG of different biomass samples such as glucose, cellulose, fructose, xylan, pulp, lignin and bark for H2 production [73]. It was observed that Ni/α-Al2O3 and Ni/hydrocalcite did not improve the selectivity for H2. Metals such as Ru, Cu and Ag when doped with Ni enhanced its catalytic activity and stability [65]. The stability and activity of Ni/γ-Al2O3 have been enhanced along with increase in H2 yield (50 mol/kg of carbon) when Ru was added for SCWG of glucose at 700 °C and 24 MPa [74]. Different transition metals (e.g., Ni, Ru, Cu and Co) with different supports (e.g., γ-Al2O3, ZrO2 and AC) and various promoters (e.g., Na, K, Mg, or Ru) have been investigated for SCWG of glucose at 600 °C and 24 MPa [75]. High H2 yield (38.4 mol/kg of glucose) was obtained with Ni/γ-Al2O3. In addition, Mg and Ru are also reported to be effective promoters for the catalyst. In a study by Furusawa et al. [76], Ni/MgO catalyst was used to gasify lignin, where the highest carbon efficiency of 30% was obtained for catalyst when calcined at 600 °C. To improve the catalytic activity and stability, promoters such as K, Na, Cs and Sn can be added to Ni catalysts for SCWG of glucose [77]. The performances of Ni catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and CeO2-γ-Al2O3 were evaluated for SCWG of glucose at 400 °C and 24.5 MPa [78]. The results showed that Ni/CeO2-γ-Al2O3 exhibited higher catalytic activity and H2 yield (12.7 mol/kg), as compared to that of Ni/γ-Al2O3 (10.5 mol/kg). The addition of Ce to the support inhibited the carbon deposition and formation of coke on the catalyst. Another transition metal such as Ru has also been found to be active for catalytic SCWG of biomass. H2 yield (12 mol/mol of glucose) close to the theoretical yield was obtained with Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at 700 °C and 24.8 MPa [58]. Stability of Ru supported on different supports (TiO2, γ-Al2O3 and AC) was tested for SCWG of lignin where Ru/TiO2 showed highest stability and catalytic activity [79]. When alkalis such as NaOH and Ca(OH)2 were added to Ru/γ-Al2O3 an improvement in H2 selectivity was observed [80]. Moreover, the combination of CaO and Ru/γ-Al2O3 had similar yields for H2 (14.7 mol/kg) and CH4 (12.8 mol/kg) at 550 °C and 36 MPa. Ru-trivalent salts on carbon supports were also tested for SCWG of lignin and it was found that Ru(NO)(NO3)3/C performed as good as Ru/C [81]. However, Ru catalyst is prone to poisoning in the presence of traces of sulfur in SCWG processes, thereby reducing the yields of H2 [82,83]. The ability of activated carbon to catalyze hydrothermal reactions makes it as a good choice of catalyst for gasification of biomass in SCW. Carbon gasification efficiency can be enhanced along with WGS and methanation reactions in presence of activated carbons. Various activated carbons such as spruce wood charcoal, macadamia shell charcoal, coal activated carbon have been investigated for the purpose [8]. H2 and CH4 yields are found to improve to a greater extent with the carbon catalyst due to progress in WGS reaction [52]. Various metals with activated carbon have been tested in SCWG of woody biomass (containing higher amount of lignin) in batch reactor [63]. It was found that for lignin gasification efficiency, the carbon-supported catalysts followed the order: Ru/C > Rh/C > Pt/C > Pd/C > Ni/C, while for H2 production they were in the order: Pd/C > Ru/C > Pt/C > Rh/C > Ni/C. Other transition metals such as Pt and Pd have also been evaluated for SCWG of biomass [6,8]. Hog manure has been gasified at 500 °C and 28 MPa with different catalysts and is reported to produce H2 production following the order: Pd/AC > Ru/Al2O3 > Ru/AC > AC > NaOH [84]. Although, homogenous catalysts such as alkali metals are dissolved in SCW for catalyzing WGS reactions, it is often difficult to recover them. The common issues encountered in their use are reactor plugging, corrosion and fouling [8]. On the contrary, heterogeneous catalysts such as transition metals offer high selectivity, catalytic activity and recyclability. The use of Ni catalyst is not only cost-effective but also efficient with high catalytic activity for H2 and CH4 production. However, Ni is sometime prone to sintering during SCWG [65]. On the other hand, Ru-supported catalysts exhibit high selectivity to H2, are more resistant and less prone to hydrothermal sintering compared to Ni catalysts [6]. Ru supported on rutile TiO2 and carbon has shown high stability during gasification. However, the char formed during SCWG of biomass reduces the catalytic activity of transition metals [65]. The supports for transition metal catalysts are sometimes unstable and change their structure and/or phase reducing their catalytic activity. Activated carbon is prone to chemisorption of the intermediates which decreases the surface area, thus affecting its activity. The recovery of catalyst also involves additional costs to the SCWG processes. The heterogeneous catalysts are filtered off from the process effluent and dried at temperatures around 60 °C, whereas the spent catalyst are washed with tetrahydrofuran to remove any organics attached to their surface [85]. Ru is found to be more effective and easily recoverable than Rh, Ni, and Pt with low recovery costs [65,86]. Activated carbon catalysts can be recovered through washing the remaining solid products with HCl at room temperature for an hour followed by filtration. The acid-insoluble fraction contains activated carbon which is further heated above the boiling point of water for recovery [87]."
11,Reactor configurations,"Different reactor configurations have been applied for gasification of biomass at supercritical conditions. These include batch and continuous reactors. Batch reactors operate in two modes such as diamond anvil cell and high pressure autoclaves, whereas continuous reactors can be in form of continuous flow reactors (e.g., tubular reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors). In addition, SCW fluidized bed reactor is an emerging new continuous reactor configuration for gasification of biomass. Diamond anvil cell (DAC) is a high pressure micro-chamber (50 nL) batch reactor which is a result of two oppositely placed diamond anvil cells [88]. The set-up can be either cooled or heated rapidly with the help of micro-electric heaters. The in-situ observations of the samples can be visualized with the help of optical microscopy [89,90]. The phase behavior, solubilities, viscosities, partition coefficients and the product analysis can be studied in details with the help of DAC [15,91,92]. A detailed schematic of DAC can be found elsewhere [91]. The decomposition of microcrystalline cellulose along with glucose and cellobiose has been performed over the temperature range of 320–400 °C at 25 MPa in DAC [93]. The phase behavior of lignin and effect of phenol on lignin gasification was studied in DAC up to 600 °C [15]. Although the phase behavior of the component can be vividly studied in DAC, comprehensive product analysis is difficult to achieve due to the low operating volumes. To have a broad range of product analysis, large volume autoclaves are used as batch reactors. A few studies on the SCWG of biomass and its components in batch reactors are summarized in Table 1 . Fig. 4 represents the schematics of a typical autoclave reactor. The components of biomass with or without catalyst are sealed inside the autoclave reactor and the reactants are stirred with the help of a stirrer [92]. Investigations on the impact of various parameters on SCWG of biomass and its model compounds have been performed in various autoclave reactors [56,97]. In order to meet the increasing demands for energy, the gasification process need to be continuous. Table 2 summarizes a few biomass components that have been gasified over continuous mode in SCW for H2 production. Gasification reactions at high temperatures and pressures occur rapidly; hence tubular reactors are well suited for continuous SCWG of biomass [51]. Fig. 5 shows a typical continuous flow apparatus. These tubular reactors are widely used to study the effects of parameters for the gasification of biomass at or beyond supercritical conditions [37,74]. Another available hybrid reactor configuration is that of continuous stirred reactors (CSTR), which is a combination of tubular and autoclave reactor [51,101]. However, higher energy inputs and complexity are constraints of CSTR at SCW conditions. CSTR compared to tubular reactors require high energy inputs due to their continuous stirring designs for efficient mixing of feed components. A unique design with mixing T-junction has been used for the SCWG of glucose for improve H2 yields and suppress char formation [100]. SCW is introduced from one side of T-junction where it instantaneously mixes with the incoming biomass slurry from the other side. The SCW-biomass slurry mixture is then fed to the reactor. The mixing of SCW with biomass slurry before its entry into the reactor reduced the char formation. The gasification efficiency and rates were compared with the previously designed continuous SCW gasification systems for glucose and it was found that the new configuration was superior to the conventional designs. In another investigation by Susanti et al. [30], a new continuous SCWG reactor was designed that inclined at 75° from the vertical position and had different zones for reaction, insulation and cooling. Higher yields of H2 (11.5 mol/mol of glucose) were achieved with this reactor configuration at 767 °C and 25 MPa. Plugging is one of the main concerns for SCWG of biomass in tubular reactors. Char/coke which is formed during gasification process blocks the passage in tubular reactors [9]. The plugging of the reactor results in shutdown of the process during gasification of biomass in SCW. In order to overcome this difficulty, fluidized bed reactors have made their way into today's biorefineries. Table 3 shows H2 yields from a few biomass species in fluidized bed reactors. Matsumura and Minowa [104] performed experiments in a fluidized bed reactor over temperature and pressure ranges of 350–600 °C and 20–35 MPa, respectively, which included three scenarios that were operated in bubbling/particulate and circulating fluidization modes. Biomass slurry was used as the fluidizing medium in first two scenarios to achieve bubbling/particulate and circulating fluidization, whereas in the third scenario, SCW alone was used to attain bubbling/particulate fluidization. It was reported that bubbling fluidized bed with biomass slurry was an effective fluidizing medium for SCWG of biomass. Extensive efforts have been invested to develop a SCW fluidized bed reactor for H2 production from biomass. Lu et al. [105] have studied the hydrodynamics of SCW fluidized bed and developed a new correlation for minimum fluidization velocity over the temperature range of 360–420 °C and pressures from 23 to 27 MPa. Residence time and particle distribution which have maximum impact on H2 yields have been investigated for SCW fluidized bed reactor [106]. Based on the results, it was concluded that double symmetric feeding pipe with an angle of 45° provided uniform solid distribution and long residence time. In a study on glucose and corn cob gasification in a fluidized bed reactor by Lu et al. [102], the effects of various parameters on H2 yields over temperature range of 550–650 °C and 27 MPa pressure were investigated. The results indicated that H2 yield increased with temperature (∼2.6 –9.1 mol/kg for 550–650 °C) and decreased with concentration (12 –3.6 mol/kg for 5–18 wt.%) for corn cob at 25 MPa. Similar effects of temperature and concentration (7.7 –2.5 mol/kg for 5–30 wt.%) was observed for glucose at 25 MPa. A slight increase in H2 yields (6–7.1 mol/kg) has been reported with increase in pressure (23–27 MPa) at 600 °C for 10 wt.% glucose solution. Sewage sludge was gasified in a SCW fluidized bed reactor by Chen et al. [103]. The experiments were performed between 480 and 540 °C with concentration varying from 4 to 12 wt.% at 25 MPa. The results indicated that with increase in temperature (480–540 °C), the yield of H2 increased from 6.7 mol/kg to 9.3 mol/kg. In contrast, H2 yields decreased from 9.2 mol/kg to 1.9 mol/kg with increase in feed concentration from 4 to 12 wt.%. In addition, the performance of alkali catalysts (i.e., NaOH, Na2CO3, KOH and K2CO3) were tested and it was found that KOH resulted in maximum H2 yield (15.5 mol/kg) at 540 °C and 25 MPa for 4 wt.% feed concentration. The index for catalytic activity was in the order: KOH > K2CO3 > NaOH > Na2CO3. The use of a novel continuous-flow microchannel reactor has been proposed by Goodwin and Rorrer [21,107]. These microchannel reactors are considered as one of the advanced configurations for SCWG where the reactions are endothermic. These reactors offer high heat transfer rates necessary for gasification reactions. Microchannels of diameters <1 mm are nested onto a single device for H2 production from glucose and xylose using micro-fabrication techniques. The entire reactor is fabricated with 21 rectangular channels of 75 μm × 500 μm with 100 cm length in a serpentine pattern of 25 layers on a device for SCWG of glucose. Goodwin and Rorrer were able to achieve 100% gasification (5.7 ± 0.3 mol of H2/mol of glucose) in 2 s at 750 °C and 25 MPa with this microchannel stainless steel reactor [21]. In another study, H2 yield of 8.2 ± 0.8 mol/mol of xylose was achieved in 1 s at 650 °C and 25 MPa in a Haste alloy C276 microtube reactor [107]."
12,Technical challenges and future prospective,"Hydrogen is not a natural source of energy, so it has to be synthesized from different sources through various routes. Major amounts of H2 are synthesized form non-renewable sources of energy such as oil, natural gas and coal with huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Advance technologies are applied to convert renewable sources such as wind, solar and biomass to fuels. No net emissions of CO2 from biomass, less operating costs and higher efficiencies (relative to other renewable sources) drive to think of SCWG as an appropriate technology to deal a diverse variety of biomass. The advantage of direct usage of wet biomass makes SCWG of biomass superior to conventional gasification technologies, which require huge amounts of energy for biomass pretreatments such as drying. Moreover, H2 production reduces the gas compression cost along with separation of CO2 from the product gases at high pressure, which is an added advantage of high pressure SCWG [4]. Hence, efforts are concentrated to effectively use biomass for H2 production in an environmentally friendly way for the current energy needs. High temperature and high pressure demand advance materials compatible to extreme conditions and high operating costs for high pressure processes. Plugging and char formation are crucial problems in SCWG of biomass [9]. The lower ability to dissolve inorganic salts at SCW conditions tends to their precipitation during SCWG of biomass. These precipitated salts combine with chars resulting in the plugging of the reactors [5,108]. Char formation can be reduced by heating biomass rapidly or with higher heating rates [100]. To overcome these plugging problems, new continuous reactor configurations have been proposed [30,100,103]. Continuous stirred tank reactor which is an integrated technology of autoclave and tubular reactors are employed to gasify the biomass with reduced plugging issues [51]. Char formation reactions are also restrained with this advance configuration. However, the limitation of this configuration is higher energy requirement. Another new emerging design in SCW gasification of biomass is fluidized bed. Char formation and plugging problems can be completely eliminated with this new fluidized bed configuration. The high energy demands, high operating costs and the complex design are some of the constraints of new fluidized bed configuration [103]. Due to the complexity and interplay of the process parameters, designing an efficient SCWG system is still underway. Corrosion of the reactor material is another technical challenge which needs to be addressed [109]. High temperature and extreme environments pose this problem, demanding advance materials to withstand these supercritical conditions [110]. The possible solution is to treat the corrosive feeds and residues prior to the injection into the reactors [111]. Pumping of higher concentrations of the biomass is another challenge to overcome. The biomass has to be comminuted into smaller particles to pump their slurry efficiently [112]. To optimize the SCWG process, efficient energy recovery equipment is inevitable. High efficiency of heat exchanger is required to heat water and mix it with the biomass for their efficient hydrothermal degradation to gases. Implication of catalysts for SCWG reduces the operating parameters with maximum H2 yields. The presence of the catalysts along with char formation might also be a cause for plugging of the reactors [113]. Although the metal catalysts, especially Ni and Ru are employed in SCWG of biomass for enhanced H2 production, they are also found to be active to methanation reactions yielding CH4 [6,8]. Selectivity to H2 and stability of catalyst at these supercritical conditions always poses a challenge which needs attention. Catalyst poisoning and deactivation during SCWG process increases the operation and regeneration costs. Catalyst supports which restrain the side reactions and thereby improve the yields of H2 need to be developed. An efficient and suitable catalyst by considering the structural properties, to enhance the catalytic activity and stability (without phase transition and sintering) is essential for the SCWG of biomass. Alumina supports for Ni and Ru with carbon nanotube has shown to be a feasible alternative [8]. The current cost of H2 produced via direct gasification of biomass is nearly three times higher than that of H2 produced via steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas [114]. The cost of H2 production from natural gas through SMR is 1.5–3.7 US$/kg (assuming 7 US$/GJ natural gas price), whereas from biomass it is 10–14 US$/GJ [4]. However, the low-cost lignocellulosic biomasses offer advantages of direct use (even for wet biomass), high H2 production and no sulfur removal from the product gases. In addition, H2 produced through biomass gasification has a net higher heating value and energy efficiency of 56–64% [115]. Although the feedstock (biomass) price for SCWG is lower as compared to natural gas for SMR, the operating costs and capital costs for high-pressure SCW systems are high. The lack of demonstrated technology for the large scale production of H2 from SCWG of biomass with net positive energy and economic conditions limits to the current commercial use of SMR from natural gas. High temperature and low density favor free radical mechanisms which are responsible to degrade the components into gases. Water gas-shift reactions and steam reforming reactions are dominant at high temperatures favoring high yields of H2. The product gases from SCWG usually requires upgrading or conditioning to either use it directly as fuel or converting them into liquid fuels via GTL technologies such as Fisher–Tropsch and syngas fermentation [2]. From the production of H2 to its storage and use for energy applications requires advanced design and materials with feasible techniques to meet economic, technical and environment standards."
13,Conclusions,"The implication of supercritical water gasification technology to produce H2 from biomass is growing with years and requires efforts to make it feasible and competent with other techniques for production of H2. Reactor configurations and operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, feed concentration, residence time and catalyst play crucial roles in maximizing H2 production. At near supercritical temperatures and high pressures, ionic mechanisms are dominant resulting in the enhancement of hydrolysis rate. From gasification studies of glucose and lignin, it can be concluded that the presence of phenol with glucose decreases H2 yields; whereas with lignin, it decreases char formation. H2 is the major product of cellulose or glucose gasification, while CH4 is the major product of lignin gasification in supercritical water. Pressure has minimal effect on process efficiency and H2 yields. Gasification of higher feed (biomass) concentrations results in lower yields of H2 with compromised efficiency. The presence of catalysts enhances H2 yield in supercritical conditions. In addition, batch reactors are suitable to study the phase behavior and reaction mechanisms, while tubular reactors are optimal for parametric studies. The reactors for supercritical water gasification are still in the developmental stage and significant efforts are being invested to make them competent towards energy efficiency and high H2 yields."
