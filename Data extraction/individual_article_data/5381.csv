0,Introduction,"Fossil energy (coal, oil, and natural gas) and related feedstock are increasingly consumed, and the energy crisis has become a big challenge for human society. Meanwhile, the waste gas and inhalable particulate matter produced by the burning of fossil energy also bring serious environmental problems such as photochemical pollution, global warming, and haze weather. Therefore, it is urgent to find renewable and sustainable energy that can replace the fossil energy. Hydrogen energy has attracted great attention due to its high heating value and non-polluting products. The concept of the “hydrogen economy” was proposed to solve the energy crisis and feedstock sustainability in the future [1]. One of the biggest challenges in the “hydrogen economy” is the storage and utilization of hydrogen energy. Traditionally, it is mainly realized through physical hydrogen storage methods such as high-pressure gas cylinders. The hydrogen storage ratio is low and there are hidden safety hazards [2]. Therefore, it is of great significance to find efficient and environmentally friendly hydrogen storage/utilization methods. The homogeneous catalysis based on transition metal complexes is one of the feasible solutions to this problem (Fig. 1 ). On one hand, these catalytic systems mediated by transition metal catalysts can store the H2 as chemical bond energy into unsaturated organic molecules such as carbon dioxide, aldehydes/ketones, and imines/nitrile, etc. to liquid chemical fuel. On the other hand, transition metal catalysts can dehydrogenate corresponding saturated molecules to generate hydrogen for utilization or to sustainable feedstock via (de)hydrogenation transformation. This strategy of using liquid organic molecules as fuel and feedstock is very promising in the “hydrogen economy” due to its advantages such as reproducibility, convenient storage and transportation, cheap and easy access, stability and environmental friendliness. The homogeneous catalytic (de)hydrogenation reactions are driven by the catalytically active transition metal complexes, which have well-defined structures. Using X-ray diffraction analysis, the environment around the active transition metal center and the effect of the ligand and reaction substrate can be better understood to make a more accurate description of the reaction mechanism. The performance of catalyst can be easily modified and improved by tuning the ligand and altering the metal center. Due to the merits of high efficiency and selectivity; mild reaction conditions; clear structure–activity relationship, homogeneous hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions mediated by transition metal complexes have gradually become a hot issue over the past decade (Fig. 2 ). The early homogeneous catalytic systems were mainly conducted by noble transition metal complexes. The reaction mechanism generally consists of a two-electron process dominated by metal centers (Fig. 3 a and 3b), namely, oxidative addition, reductive elimination, and inner-sphere insertion\elimination reactions. Wilkinson catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3) is a representative of this type of catalyst [3]. With the continuing exploration by chemists, metal-ligand cooperation (MLC) catalysis has become a more popular strategy [4]. The central idea of this strategy is to introduce a Lewis base functional site on the ligand to construct an intra-molecular Lewis acid-base pair (LB-TM, Fig. 3c), so as to carry out metal-ligand cooperation during hydrogenation and dehydrogenation [5–9]. The well-known “Noyori Catalyst” catalyst [10] one of the most famous representative catalysts based on the LB-TM strategy. Although noble metal complexes perform attractive catalytic activities, the high cost and toxicity limit their wide application in industry. Therefore, researchers have begun to develop non-noble metal catalytic systems based on the previous mechanism in recent years [11,12]. Different from the precious metal center, the one-electron transfer process may compete with the two-electron (de)hydrogenation process in the first-row transition metal catalyst, such as the oxidative addition/reduction elimination, insertion reaction/elimination, or the bifunctional MLC mechanism [13]. Thus, in order to make the first-row non-noble transition metal catalysts to perform better two-electron reaction process, so as to achieve high activity, strong-field ligands are usually used to stabilize the complexes. Another novel strategy is to use a Lewis acidic functional site such as boron or aluminum and low-valent transition metals to facilitate the hydrogen activation and transfer process (LA-TM, Fig. 3d), with the assistance with the Lewis acid site to accept the hydride [14–19]. Many reviews have elaborated on the mechanisms of homogenous hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reaction in detail, especially focusing on the rational design and synthetic preparation of functional ligands [20–22]. However, it should be pointed out that metal centers also play a crucial role in the catalytic process. Transition metals in different groups and rows have a rich diversity in oxidation states, electronic structures, and atomic radii. These differences will have an important impact on the geometry, reaction mechanism, and catalytic activity of transition metal complex catalysts. Stimulated by our, as well as others’ recent theoretical studies of the transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation and dehydrogenation related reactions, this mini-review is mainly focused on the metal center effect on the reaction mechanism."
1,Oxidation state of the metal center,"Transition metal centers in different oxidation states may exhibit distinct mechanisms in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Cobalt complex is one of the most widely studied (de)hydrogenation catalysts and shows activities in different oxidation states, which is worth being discussed concerning the metal effect of oxidation state on the catalytic mechanism for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation."
2,The mechanism of low-valent Co complexes,"2.1 The mechanism of low-valent Co complexes The H2 activation process is the crucial step in the homogenous hydrogenation reaction. Complexes with low-valent cobalt centers can either undergo the oxidative addition or the Lewis base/acid assisted heterolytic cleavage to activate the inert H2 molecule, exhibiting the mechanistic diversity. Recently, Linehan et al. developed a well-defined cobalt catalyst, Co(dmpe)2H, (dmpe:1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)-ethane), and the oxidative addition mechanism was proposed for H2 activation [23]. Ke et al. carried out a theoretical study on this Co(I) catalytic system [24], suggesting the H2 activation proceeded via a nearly barrierless oxidative addition process (0.4 kcal/mol, Fig. 4 ). While the Lewis base assisted heterolytic cleavage required much higher activation free energies. The activation free energy of the formate assisted cleavage reaction pathway is 8.6 kcal/mol. The Verkade's base (VKD) assisted cleavage needs to overcome an activation free energy of 23.2 kcal/mol due to the steric repulsion (Fig. 4). Another interesting example is the Co(-I) bimetallic complex developed by Lu et al. [25], in which the Co center was in a very low oxidation state of −1. A Co(-I)/Co(I) catalytic cycle via the oxidative addition mechanism was proposed. The catalytic cycle also began with the H2 activation via oxidative addition. Subsequently, the hydride directly transferred to the CO2 with an activation free energy of 23.6 kcal/mol. After the release of the generated formate, another molecule of H2 coordinated to the Co(I) center. The formic acid would be further deprotonated by the Verkade's base. An alternative catalytic cycle that involved the dual oxidative addition mechanism was also been investigated and ruled out due to its higher activation free energy (Fig. 5 ). Besides the hydrogen activation process, the hydride transfer process is important for the hydrogenation reaction. The oxidation state of the metal center is found to significantly affect the hydride transfer ability, thus altering the reaction mechanism in the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The hydride transfer ability can be measured by the Gibbs free energy of the hydride dissociation reaction ( Δ G H - 0 (MH): MH → M+ + H-), which is well known as hydricity [26,27]. The smaller the hydricity represents the stronger ability for hydride transfer. For the same metal, the higher the oxidation state of the metal center, the lower the ability for the hydride transfer it has. In previous studies on the Co-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 by Ke et al. [24], the hydride transfer to CO2 showed distinct differences between the Co(I) monohydride and Co(III) dihydride intermediates (Fig. 6 ). The activation free energy for the hydride transfer by Co(I)-monohydride intermediate was 10.0 kcal/mol, while the hydride transfer promoted by Co(III) dihydrogen intermediate had a higher activation free energy barrier (25.7 kcal/mol), which was well reflected by the calculated hydricity of 33.7 kcal/mol for the Co(I) monohydride compound, and of 96.5 kcal/mol for the Co(III) dihydride compound (Fig. 6). NPA charge analysis suggested a lower charge of 0.067 for the hydride on the Co(I) center, while a higher NPA charge of 0.147 for the hydride on the Co(III) center. The molecular orbital analysis also indicated the influence of the metal center on the Co-H σorbital. The Co(I) monohydride compound had a higher energy level for the Co-H orbital, indicating a stronger hydride donor. Low-valent transition metals usually prefer to higher electron density and better hydride donating ability. However, it should be noted that low-valent transition metals might correspond to less stable hydride intermediate from the perspective of thermochemistry. Nevertheless, it should be very interesting to tune the balance between the thermodynamic stability and the kinetic activity for the metal-hydride intermediate by the mental center effect of oxidation state. Since the high oxidation state Co(III) dihydride complex lacks a driving force for the hydride transfer reaction, it can be deprotonated by the base to a low-valent Co(I) monohydride, which may also lead to interesting mechanism variation in CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 7 ). Ke and cowokers’ DFT results [24] suggest that the direct hydride transfer mechanism via an outer-sphere manner had an activation free energy of 10.0 kcal/mol. Instead, the low-valent monohydride complex could also nucleophilically attack the CO2 using the Co(I) center (ΔG≠= 7.6 kcal/mol), then the reduction elimination between the hydride and the reduced [CO2]2− ligand via an inner-sphere manner furnished the formate anion (ΔG≠= 6.1 kcal/mol). The alternative direct hydride transfer mechanism was found to be slightly higher in the activation free energy (10.0 kcal/mol, Fig. 7), which was consistent with the theoretical studies by Appel et al. [28]."
3,The mechanism of Co(II) complex,"2.2 The mechanism of Co(II) complex With respect to the relatively higher oxidation state of cobalt in Co(II) complexes, strong ligands tend to make the complexes adopt square planar coordination geometry in the low-spin doublet state. The ligand field theory and the empirical 18-e rule play a very important role in determining the reaction mechanism [29]. For the bifunctional catalysis, the catalyst needs to maintain a specific geometry for effective metal-ligand cooperation. Thus, the difference in d electron numbers can bring a variety of reaction mechanisms. Hanson et al. developed effective Co(II) complexes for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of ketones [30–32]. A non-bifunctional mechanism was proposed, which was supported by the methylation of the functional NH group in the catalyst. In order to understand the unusual non-bifunctional mechanism in catalyst with “bifunctional” ligand, Ke et al. carried out DFT studies on this Co(II)-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation system [33]. The bifunctional metal ligand-cooperation mechanism via outer sphere (Fig. 8 ) was found to have a higher activation free energy (ΔG≠= 47.8 kcal/mol) than the inner-sphere non-bifunctional mechanism (ΔG≠= 36.7 kcal/mol), which was in good agreement with the experimental observation by Hanson et al. [31]."
4,The mechanism of Co(III) complexes,"2.3 The mechanism of Co(III) complexes As for the catalyst bearing the Co(III) metal center, the Lewis base assisted bifunctional mechanism is usually preferred. The hydrogenation activation process can either operate the metal-ligand cooperation catalysis or the external base activation process (Fig. 9 ). Nozaki et al. prepared an Ir(III) pincer complex using alkylphosphine pyridine ligand as the main scaffold, and proposed a metal-ligand cooperation via the aromatization/dearomatization mechanism for the catalytic system [34]. Yang et al. carried out a theoretical study on the CO2 hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by Nozaki’s iridium catalyst and proposed an alternative mechanism without the dearomatization process of the ligand [35]. Instead, the hydroxyl group functioned as an external base to cleave the H2 molecule. DFT calculation results indicated the external base mechanism was 20 kcal/mol more favorable than the (de)aromatization mechanism. Himeda et al. developed a half-sandwich Co(III) complex with a pendant oxyanion functioned as the proton-responsive ligand for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction [36]. The DFT results indicated the activation free energy of the Co(III) system was slightly higher than that of the Ir(III) system. The hydrogen activation process was verified to proceed via a metal-ligand cooperation mechanism, in which the H2 was cleaved through a proton-shuttle transition state. The activation free energy of the direct heterolytic cleavage was 31.8 kcal/mol. In comparison, the proton-shuttle mechanism had an activation free energy of 26.7 kcal/mol [37]. Though the Co(III) center was inert for the H2 activation via the oxidative addition mechanism due to the low electron density on the Co(III) center. The metal-ligand cooperation via the proton shuttle mechanism could achieve the heterolytic cleavage of H2 with an accessible activation free energy."
5,The mechanism of Ni complexes,"2.4 The mechanism of Ni complexes With respect to the transition metal catalysts based on Ni center, Ni(II) is widely utilized in the catalytic (de)hydrogenation reaction with different types of ligands (Fig. 10 a) [16,38,39]. Recently, we carried out a theoretical study on the hydrosilylation of CO2 catalyzed by the Lewis Acid PBP-Ni(II) complex [40]. With the d8 electronic structure, the PBP-Ni(II) complex maintains the low-spin state and the square-planar geometry. The mechanism study suggested that the Ni(II) promoted Si–H bond cleavage should generally involve an SN2 type transition state in a linear manner. With the aid of external Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, the first Si–H bond activation is found to be the rate-determining step and the activation free energy is ~28 kcal/mol, which is lower compared with the previously proposed mechanism (Fig. 10b). Deshmukh and Sakaki et al. theoretically evaluated the potential of Ni(I) catalyst for hydrosilylation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen production reaction [41,42]. The mechanism investigated follows the typical hydride transfer and regeneration mechanism (Fig. 10c). The activities between different oxidation states, Ni(I) and Ni(II), are compared, indicating the Ni(I) hydride insertion reaction with CO2 requires a lower activation free energy (ΔG≠= 7.2 kcal/mol) than the Ni(II) hydride complex (ΔG≠= 26.9 kcal/mol). The origin of the activity difference was further analyzed using frontier molecular orbital theory. The energy level of SOMO of Ni(I) complex (−5.02 eV) is much higher than Ni(II) complex (−7.33 eV), which facilitated the hydride transfer process. The first Ni(0) hydrogenation catalyst was synthesized by Lu et al using a bimetallic strategy in 2015 [43]. The LA-type Ga(III) and In(III) ions are able to stabilize Ni–H2 adducts and facilitate olefin hydrogenation. The Ni–Al complex and a single nickel center are not active for H2 activation and hydrogenation. In 2017, Driess et al. synthesized a Ni(0) complex using bis(N-heterocyclic silylene)-xanthene ligand [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (Fig. 11 ) [44]. This complex could activate H2 reversibly and is effective for catalytic hydrogenation of olefins under 1 bar H2 pressure at room temperature. DFT study (B3LYP-D3/SDD-def2SVP) and NBO analysis suggested the H2 cleavage proceeds via a metal-ligand assisted homolytic mode. The activation free energy was calculated to be 11.6 kcal/mol, and the overall rate-determining step (ΔG≠= 24.8 kcal/mol) is the isomerization of the hydride."
6,The mechanism of Fe complexes,"2.5 The mechanism of Fe complexes The majority of the LB-TM iron catalysts used Fe(II) as the metal center. With strong field ligands such as CO, the metal center tends to maintain a low-spin state. Peters’ recent works indicated that the Fe(0) catalyst can be stabilized by LA type ligand, the mechanism will be discussed in section 3.2 [45]. On the other hand, due to the intrinsic character of the first-row transition metal center, the splitting energy gap of the ligand field is relatively narrow. When the redox-active ligand coordinated to the Fe center, the electronic structure of the catalysts becomes diverse [13]. The redox-active ligand can lose and gain electrons during the catalytic process, which leads to a unique metal-ligand cooperation mechanism. The (iPrPDI)Fe(N2)2 (iPrPDI = 2,6-(2,6- i Pr2-C6H3-NCMe)2C5H3N) developed by Chirik et al. is a representative complex with redox-active ligand. The oxidation state of iron center is described as a resonance hybrid (Fig. 12 a) between Fe(0) and Fe(II). The four-coordinate compounds, (iPrPDI)FeN2, is an intermediate spin ferrous derivative (SFe = 1) antiferromagnetically coupled to a bis(imino)pyridine triplet dianion. Generally, the oxidative addition reaction is a two-electron process, which may lead to unstable high-valent intermediate. With the redox-active ligand, both the metal and bis(imino)pyridine ligand participate the electron flow to achieve the net two-electron and the high-valent intermediate can be avoided (Fig. 12b) [46]. Mechanism study suggested the hydrogenation operated in the classical hydride insertion/elimination process and the spin state of the intermediate was found to be an open-shell singlet state [47]. More recently, using experimental and computational studies, Langer and Ke et al. investigated an unusual PBP-type iron pincer complex that is active for the dehydrogenation of Me2NH-BH3 [48]. The catalytic process undergoes a 2-electron process (Fig. 13 ). The PBP-Fe(0) complex is the starting point and the catalytic cycle initiated with the protonation of the Fe(0) center by Me2NH-BH3. During this process, the Fe(0) center is oxidized to a Fe(II) center. Subsequently, an outer-sphere coupling reaction releases the H2 molecule and the carbanion PBP-Fe(II) intermediate is formed. The bifunctional dehydrogenation reaction yields another molecular of H2 and regenerates the Fe(0) complex. The unique B → M binding property increases the electronic density of the Fe center that participates the dehydrogenation more like a proton acceptor via redox-active mode. The Fe(II) hydrido ligand possesses an acidic character and couples with the B-H of BH3NMe2 to release the H2."
7,The “Group” effect,
8,Different electronic configurations and the same oxidation state.,"3.1 Different electronic configurations and the same oxidation state. Transition metal complex with the metal center in different electronic configuration will experience different energy penalty, due to ligand field distortion caused by the coordination geometry change during the reaction. Studies by Hanson [31] and Ke [33] suggested the d7 Co(II) pincer catalyst preferred an unusual non-bifunctional inner-sphere mechanism even with the ancillary functional NH group. In contrast, the d6 Fe(II)-PNP pincer catalyst was demonstrated to proceed via the outer-sphere bifunctional mechanism in many (de)hydrogenation reactions [49,50]. The mechanistic variation between d6 Fe(II)-PNP catalyst and d7 Co(II)-PNP catalyst was found to originates from their different electronic configurations even though at the same oxidation state. Ke’s DFT results [33] suggested that the ground state of d7 Co(II)-PNP was doublet, in which the dz 2 orbital was singly occupied (Fig. 14 ). In the bifunctional transition state, a geometry change due to the hydride flipping resulted in an anti-bonding dz 2 orbital. This ligand field distortion leads to a large energy penalty (36.3 kcal/mol) due to the significantly increased orbital energy level for the single filled dz 2 orbital. Therefore, the outer-sphere bifunctional mechanism was not favored due to the increased deformation energy. In contrast, the ground state of the d6 Fe(II)-pincer catalyst was singlet and the coordination geometry well maintained an octahedral structure in the transition state. Therefore, the ligand field distortion energy required was low (14.4 kcal/mol). Thus, the d6 Fe(II)-pincer catalyst preferred the bifunctional mechanism. As a supplementary example, Mn(I) also possesses a d6 electronic configuration, different from the d7 Co(II) catalysts [30,31], and similar to the d6 Fe(II) catalysts [50]. With coordinated strong ligand, the Mn(I) complexes tend to adopt low spin ground state and the coordination geometry prefers a six-coordinated octahedral structure according to the 18-e electronic rule. Recently, a series of Mn(I)-Pincer complexes based on phosphine pincer ligands were prepared that operate the outer-sphere bifunctional mechanism in metal-ligand cooperation manner for (de)hydrogenation [51]. Differently, the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands [52] with stronger electron-donating ability could promote the (de)hydrogenation without the bifunctional assistance [53,54]. Detailed mechanistic study based on DFT calculation indicated the hydride transfer proceeded via a unique outer-sphere non-bifunctional mechanism (Fig. 15 ) [53]. The activation free energy of the dehydrogenation of alcohol was 12.2 kcal/mol. The hydrogenation of the α, β-unsaturated ketones also proceeded via an easily accessible energy barrier (ΔG≠ = 14.9 kcal/mol), which was lower in comparison to traditional PNP catalysts via the outer-sphere bifunctional mechanism."
9,Similar electronic configuration and different oxidation states.,"3.2 Similar electronic configuration and different oxidation states. Metal centers with similar electronic configuration however in different oxidation states also exhibit different features in (de)hydrogenation mechanism. Metal centers with similar valence d electrons but different oxidation state can lead to complexes in different coordination situation and different multiplicities. Even with the same ligand, it can affect the splitting of the d orbital, resulting in different spin ground states and geometric structures. As shown in Fig. 16 , the square pyramidal Rh(I) complex with tri(azaindolyl)borane ligand was developed by Owen and co-workers [17]. And the (TPB)Fe(0) catalyst (TPB = tris(phosphino)borane) was developed by Peters and co-workers [45]. They are both d8 complexes. However, the d8 Rh(I) center preferred a singlet ground state [55]. It promoted the H2 activation via a bifunctional LA-TM synergetic heterolytic mechanism with an activation free energy of 20.2 kcal/mol. On the contrary, the trigonal bipyramidal (TPB)Fe(0) catalyst preferred a triplet reaction pathway [56]. The triplet (TPB)Fe(0) catalyst activated the H2 molecule via a dissociative oxidative addition mechanism in a mer(trans)-homolytic manner. The generated metal hydride then transferred to the middle between the Fe center and the boron atom to form a bridging bond. The activation free energy of the oxidative addition step was only 9.8 kcal/mol due to the low-valent Fe(0) center. With the same PNP (PNP = HN[CH2CH2(PiPr2)]2) pincer-type ligand, the d8 complexes with Co(I) and Ni(II) as metal centers were discovered experimentally to adopt different electronic structures and coordination geometry (Fig. 17 a) [39,57]. In order to explore the reasons and effects behind this phenomenon, computational studies of these two complexes were conducted by Ke et al. [58] Their results showed that the PNP-Co(I) pincer catalyst tended to choose a tetrahedron geometry in high spin, while the PNP-Ni(II) pincer catalyst adopts a square-planar structure in low spin. This structural difference further leads to mechanistic variation for the hydrogenation of ketones. The PNP-Co(I) catalyst preferred an MLC outer-sphere bifunctional mechanism, while the PNP-Ni(II) catalyst followed the non-bifunctional inner-sphere hydride transfer mechanism (Fig. 17b and 17c). By comparing the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of the complexes, it was found that the energy gap of PNP-Co(I) was narrower (Co: 1.73 eV and Ni: 3.09 eV) when adopting the square planer geometry. Therefore, the PNP-Co(I) tended to choose a high spin state to occupy more orbitals, reducing the instability effect brought by electron repulsion. Although both the Co(I) and Ni(II) centers had similar d8 configuration, the Ni(II) center had a higher effective nuclear charge, so that the ligand would be more tightly bound to the metal center, resulting in a larger HOMO-LUMO gap. The proposed MLC hydrogenation mechanism of the PNP-Co(I) pincer complex was supported by the experimental studies by Beller et al. and Robert et al. [59,60] Therefore, the influence of the metal center on multiplicity and d-orbital splitting should be carefully considered for the development of the homogeneous hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts. The oxidation state of the metal center will also affect the stability and activity of metal hydride for hydrogenation in the MLC bifunctional catalytic process. The formation of the metal hydride intermediate is a crucial step for (de)hydrogenation, which should be thermodynamically proper on the reaction potential surface. A DFT study on transfer hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by Sortais’s PyO-Mn(I) (PyO = 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine) bifunctional catalyst by Ke et al. [61,62] suggested that the thermodynamic property of the Mn(I) hydride will be influenced by the interaction between the M−H bond and the functional OH group on the PyO ligand. The low oxidation state of the Mn(I) center lead to a stronger perturbation between the M−H bond and the OH group, which resulted in the repulsion towards the filled dyz orbital thus the thermodynamic instability of the metal hydride intermediate. The formation of the metal hydride during the dehydrogenation was uphill by 11.1 kcal/mol, with i PrOH as a model substrate (Fig. 18 ). With respect to the PyO-Fe(II) complex bearing also a d6 center but a higher oxidation state in comparison to the PyO-Mn(I) catalyst, the formation of the metal hydride was, on the contrary, exergonic by −5.4 kcal/mol. A systematic evaluation of metal centers with different oxidation states but the similar valance d6 configuration showed that the oxidation state of the metal center significantly affected the perturbation between the M−H bond and the adjacent functional group, thus the thermodynamic stability of the metal hydride intermediates and the activity of the (de)hydrogenation reactions."
10,The “Row” effect,"The radii of the transition metal due to the row effect plays an important role in catalysis. With respect to the mechanism issue, it mainly manifests in two aspects. The first one is the thermodynamic stability of the catalyst. The transition metal catalysts applied in the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction usually use multidentate pincer ligand with a rigid backbone. The change of the radii of the metal center will affect the dative binding and thus the coordination geometry, which might result in the dissociation or even decomposition of the active species during (de)hydrogenation. In the study of Ru system by Morris and co-workers, when the metal center was changed from Ru(II) to Fe(II), the catalyst was easily decomposed to form nanoparticles, which affected the catalytic activity [63]. The second aspect is the change of reaction mechanism due to the difference in metal atom radii. An interesting example can be seen in the theoretical study of LA-TM catalyzed hydrogen activation by Ke et al. [64], based on the DPB-Ni(0) catalyst (DPB = diphosphine-borane) developed by Peters et al. [65]. The DPB-Ni(0) catalyst preferred the synergetic heterolytic mode via the LA-TM cooperation with an activation free energy of 23.7 kcal/mol (Fig. 19 ). When the Ni(0) was replaced with the second row Pd(0) [66], the synergetic heterolytic mode could not be obtained due to the increase in the atomic radii, and the fac(cis)-homolytic cleavage via oxidative addition became the most plausible mechanism (ΔG≠ = 29.6 kcal/mol) (Fig. 19) [55]. With respect to the activity issue, the row effect also shows an important impact due to the change in the back-donation ability of the d orbitals. DFT studies [37] by Ke et al. based on Himeda’s catalytic CO2 hydrogenation systems [67–69], provided hints to understand the experimentally observed activity difference in Group 9 transition metals (TOF, Ir(III) > Rh(III) > Co(III)). As shown in Fig. 20 , when the hydrogen molecule coordinated to the metal center, the functional ligand would assist the cleavage of H2 with one water molecule as the proton-shuttle. For the investigated Co(III), Rh(III), and Ir(III) catalysts, the calculated activation free energies were 18.3, 14.2, and 13.4 kcal/mol, respectively, which was in good agreement with the experimentally observed activity trend. The H2 cleavage step was suggested to be the rate-determining step of the entire catalytic cycle, in which the metal centers’ back donation ability was unfolded to play an important role in the catalytic activity. Compared to free H2 molecule, the coordinated H2 in the Ir(III)–H2 complex was elongated by 0.11 Å, and it was increased by 0.05 Å and 0.06 Å for the Co(III)–H2 and the Rh(III)–H2, respectively (Fig. 20). The d orbital of the Ir(III) center and the H2 σ* orbital had the highest second-order disturbance energy (22.24 kcal/mol), which was much higher than those of the Rh(III)–H2 (8.42 kcal/mol) and the Co(III)–H2 (3.56 kcal/mol). The hydride transfer ability will also be affected by the row effect. In the theoretical study by Jiao and Beller et al. (Fig. 21 ), it was found that the PNP-Fe(II) pincer complex exhibited a superior catalytic activity in the hydrogen release process, with the trend of the activation free energies for group 8 (Os(II) > Ru(II) > Fe(II)) analogues [70]. However, the hydrogenation reaction of the nitrile did not follow the same trend and the Ru(II) pincer catalyst showed the best activity with the calculated activation free energy of 17.15 kcal/mol, followed by the Fe(II) pincer catalyst (17.75 kcal/mol) and the Os(II) pincer catalyst (21.03 kcal/mol) (Fig. 17). These results interestingly showed the diversity of the row effects."
11,Conclusion and outlook,"In summary, this mini-review summarizes the effects of transition metal center on the reaction mechanism of catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation related reactions, including the oxidation state, the electronic configuration, the group effect, the row effect, and other electronic structure factors related to the mechanism and the activity. Although the ligand has attracted numerous interests in catalyst design and mechanism understanding, the intrinsic characteristics of the transition metal center itself are also important factors that should be considered. With the development and expansion of the concept of green chemistry, it is still a big challenge to establish a cheap, efficient, and environmentally friendly homogeneous catalytic system based on non-noble metals. When replacing the precious transition metal catalysts with non-noble ones, the above-mentioned transition metal center factors must be very carefully evaluated for catalyst design, both for the mechanism and the activity. Different oxidation states of the transition metal center not only influence the electron density, the redox property, but also the coordination geometry of the complex, which leads to different electronic structures, thus changing the mechanism and the stability and activity of the intermediates. Although at the same oxidation state, transition metals bearing different electronic configurations will exhibit preferences arise from different ligand field distortion penalties in the rate-determining steps of certain mechanisms. This is important for mechanism-inspired ligand design based on group effect. Similarly, transition metal centers from different groups, which have similar electronic configuration but different oxidation states, could also lead to complexes in different coordination situation and different multiplicities due to ligand field splitting, thus changing the reaction mechanism and activity. With the same oxidation state and similar valance d electrons, transition metals in the same group would also show subtle row effects on the mechanism and activity. This row effect should be carefully considered when tuning the back-donation ability, the electronegativity, the dative interaction, and the metal center radii. The relationship between the transition metal center factors and the functional ligand are also intriguing issues to focus on, especially for the Lewis acid/base ligand and redox-active ligand, which may lead to a dramatic change of the metal center activity and unusual catalytic mechanism. In addition, the utilization of practical and environmentally friendly ligands is also important to increase the robustness and compatibility of the non-noble metal catalysts. To summarise, theoretical calculations can provide in-depth information about the reaction mechanism, electronic structure, and structure-activity relationship, together with experimental studies, they are undoubtedly very helpful to advance the rational catalyst design for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation related reactions."
