0,Introduction,"Anaerobic fermentation is a critical process for degrading and valorizing organic wastes and wastewater into renewable energy and high value-added products [1–2]. Fermentative bacteria are the key microbes during fermentation that metabolize organic polymers and carrying out acidogenesis and H2 production during anaerobic fermentation and/or digestion [3–4]. During multi-stage digestion, some acidogenic fermenters, such as Clostridium and Ethanoligenens, produce H2 at a high rate [5–6], which is a clean energy carrier with H2O as the only combustion product [7]. In addition, interspecies H2 transfer is an essential process in such systems to allow interspecies electron transfer for microbial syntrophy [8]. Highly efficient and continuous fermentative H2 production has been achieved in mixed culture studies [9–11]. Clostridium is a representative H2-producing bacterium that often prevails in butyrate-type fermentation. Subsequently, Ethanoligenens harbinense is identified as a representative species that performs ethanol-type fermentation during acidogenesis and is capable of converting carbohydrates into H2, CO2, ethanol, and acetic acid [9,12]. Along with H2 as a renewable energy carrier, short-chain volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols are precursors of renewable fuels and chemicals [13],thus, the metabolic intermediates produced by Ethanoligenens or Clostridium can be upgraded to high value-added chemicals (such as long-chain fatty acids and polyhydroxyalkanoates) [14–16]. Therefore, it is essential to promote the production of VFAs and ethanol from organic waste. Different operating parameters have been investigated to improve the recovery of bioresources and bioenergy through primary fermentation reactions, including microbial inocula, temperature, pH, hydraulic retention time, and the accumulation of end-products, but it is difficult to control and regulate fermentative pathways that favor specific products [4,17]. Because anaerobic digestion involves a cascade of redox reactions, the redox potential has been used to tune the fermentation pathways. An electro-fermentation system (EFS) is a type of microbial electrochemical technology that enables a redox-controlled fermentation process [18]. As an electron sink (anode) or source (cathode), the electrodes change redox balance during fermentation, thereby regulating fermentation pathways under unbalanced conditions [19–20]. The potential applied to a working electrode in an EFS coordinates the fermentation product spectrum by regulating extracellular electron transfer (EET) of electroactive bacteria and changing the extracellular oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and the ratio of NAD+/NADH (oxidized or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) [21–23]. A recent study demonstrated a shift in Clostridium pasteurianum towards NADH-consuming metabolite production in a cathodic electro-fermentation system (CEFS), leading to three times more butanol yield compared to fermentation [24]. Another study reported that 3‑hydroxypropionic acid production by Klebsiella pneumoniae L17 is enhanced in an anodic electro-fermentation system (AEFS) by decreasing the NADH/NAD+ ratio within cells [25]. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the genes encoding enzymes involved in NADH regeneration in the electroactive bacterium (EAB) Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 are upregulated under a high potential of 0.5 V [26]. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating NADH regeneration and electron transfer of fermentative bacteria during EFS are poorly understood. EFSs offer a flexible approach to tune the fermentation process with targeted products compared to anaerobic fermentation. It has been reported that a more negative working potential enhances the production of CH4 and acetic acid in mixed-culture EFSs, while increasing the potential from −1.0 V to −0.2 V reduces methanogenesis by 68% and acetic acid production by 33% [27]. K. pneumoniae inoculated-CEFS with a poised potential of −0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) improves 1,3-propanediol generation by 1.5-fold with 100 µm of neutral red [28]. In addition, the interspecific interactions between an EAB and a fermenter in an EFS greatly enhance H2 production and ethanol concentration of an E. harbinense and Geobacter sulfurreducens coculture [5]. However, little is known about how to tune metabolites in an EFS via electrode potential optimization, particularly for H2 and ethanol in the fermentation pathway [18]. Electroactive bacteria, such as Geobacter and Shewanella, can perform direct electron transfer (DET) in an EFS [29–30]. Moreover, electron shuttles, such as H2 and neutral red, also play a role in regulating extracellular ORP and electron flow [31–33]. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that the EFS is a powerful approach to enhance target metabolite production by controlling the electrode potential, the details of the molecular mechanism of metabolic regulation during the electro-fermentation process remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of poised electrode potentials on metabolic products of E. harbinense in an EFS and revealed the molecular regulatory mechanism based on RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis."
1,Materials & methods,
2,Bacterial strain and growth conditions,2.1 Bacterial strain and growth conditions The Ethanoligenens harbinense strain YUAN-3 used in this study was isolated from anaerobic sludge in molasses wastewater and stored in our laboratory [12]. It was cultivated at 35℃ in a modified peptone/yeast extract/glucose (PYG) medium with added trace elements and vitamins and purged with ultra-pure N2 (99.999%) for 30 min as reported previously [34].
3,Construction and operation of microbial fuel cells,"2.2 Construction and operation of microbial fuel cells To determine the extracellular electron transfer ability of E. harbinense YUAN-3, three identical two-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were constructed using two glass bottles with a liquid volume of 180 mL in each chamber and a proton exchange membrane separator (Nafion 117, Dupont, Wilmington, DE, USA). Carbon paper was used as the anode and cathode (1.5 cm × 4 cm) and was connected through a fixed resistance of 1000 Ω via a titanium wire. The cathode chamber contained 50 mM potassium ferricyanide as the catholyte (in 50 mM phosphate buffer solution), while the anode chamber was fed with modified PYG purged with N2 (99.999%) for 30 min to achieve an anaerobic condition. Then, three MFCs were autoclave sterilized (121℃ for 15 min) followed by inoculation with 5 mL of pre-cultured E. harbinense YUAN-3 and operation in batch mode at 35℃. The cell voltages across an external resistor of 1000 Ω were recorded every 10 min using a data acquisition system (model 2700 with a 7702 module, Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) based on a computer as reported previously [35]."
4,Construction and operation of the electro-fermentation reactors,"2.3 Construction and operation of the electro-fermentation reactors Each EFS reactor (Fig. 1 ) consisted of a single chamber with a volume of 350 mL and was equipped with a cathode (180 mm × 450 mm, 0.5 mm thick) manufactured from stainless steel mesh and rolling activated carbon bound with PTFE as the catalyst layer [36], with a carbon paper anode (TGP-H090, Toray, Tokyo, Japan) (180 mm × 450 mm, 0.19 mm thick) via a titanium wire connection as reported previously [5]. Each EFS was placed with a KCl saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode (+199 mV vs. the standard hydrogen electrode) (Ida Co., Tianjin, China) near the working electrode. The electrodes were connected to a multichannel potentiostat (WMPG1000, WonATech, Seoul, Korea) for electrochemical measurements. Each reactor was filled with 290 mL of modified PYG medium, and the anaerobic indicator resazurin was added and adjusted to an initial pH of 6.8. Subsequently, the reactors were purged with N2 (99.999%) for 30 min to remove oxygen, and autoclaved before use. The E. harbinense YUAN-3 culture was harvested by centrifugation 10,000 × g for 5 min. The 0.12 g (wet weight) cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of culture medium from the reactor and was reinjected. Either the anode or cathode was used as a working electrode to investigate the effects of different electrode potentials on the anodic electro-fermentation system (AEFS) or cathodic electro-fermentation system (CEFS). The reactors were operated in batch mode until gas production was completed and equipped with a working potential poised at the following conditions: anode poised potential of −0.4 V (AEFS-0.4), −0.2 V (AEFS-0.2), 0 V (AEFS0), +0.2 V (AEFS+0.2), and +0.4 V (AEFS+0.4) (vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode); cathode poised potential of −0.4 V (CEFS-0.4), −0.2 V (CEFS-0.2), and 0 V (CEFS0) (vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode) using a multichannel potentiostat. An open-circuit EFS (OC-EFS) was used as a control. Each group was tested in triplicate and all EFSs were operated at 35℃ with magnetic stir bars. Each reactor was connected to a gas bag to collect the gas, which was changed after it was nearly filled with biogas. Liquid samples were taken to investigate pH, VFAs, and glucose utilization. To determine the variation in the biomass during EF, total cell wet weight of the planktonic bacteria and electrode-attached biofilm were determined at the end of the operation."
5,Analyses and calculations,"2.4 Analyses and calculations Total gas production and production rates were continuously monitored with a multi-channel respirometer (AER-208, Challenge Environmental System Inc., Springdale, AR, USA). H2 and CO2 produced from the EFSs were collected in gas bags (1.5 L) and determined by a gas chromatograph (GC) (GC7890A, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The concentrations of ethanol and acetic acid were analyzed by the GC equipped with the FID. Glucose concentrations were measured with a Glucose Detection Kit (Shanghai Rongsheng Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and pH was determined with a pH meter (PB-10, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). Hydrogen yield was calculated as the molar value of hydrogen production normalized to that of the glucose consumed (mol-H2/mol-glucose). The EF coefficient, which represents the contribution of charges transferred through the external circuit to the whole charge of the end products, was calculated as described previously [37–38]. The detailed formulas for the EF coefficient and the electron value via current are given in the Supporting Information."
6,RNA isolation and sequencing,"2.5 RNA isolation and sequencing Working electrode-attached biofilm and planktonic samples were collected 48 h after inoculation from groups AEFS0, AEFS-0.4, AEFS+0.4, and OC-EFS, around the peak gas production time of groups AEFS0 and OC-EFS, and were immediately stored at −80 °C for later RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated using the HiPure Universal RNA Mini Kit (R4130, Magen, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The degree of RNA degradation and contamination was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, then the NanoDrop One® (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Qubit 2.0 were used for the RNA purity and concentration assessments, after which RNA integrity was verified using the Agilent 4200 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA). After assessment, ribosomal RNA was further removed using the Epicentre Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The cDNA libraries were constructed with the NEBNext® Ultra II™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina based on the manufacturer’s protocol. After the libraries were qualified, the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform was used for paired-end sequencing."
7,Transcriptomic data analysis,"2.6 Transcriptomic data analysis The sequencing reads were filtered to obtain clean reads by eliminating reads with adapter, low-quality (>50% bases of Q10), and excess poly-N (>10% of nucleotides in each read). Bowtie 2.33 software ( https://github.com/BenLangmead/bowtie2 ) was applied to align the clean reads with the ribosomal sequence in the Rfam database and remove the sequence on the alignment. Hisat 2.1.0 software ( https://github.com/infphilo/hisat2 ) was performed to compare the unmapped reads with the reference E. harbinense genome (GenBank: CP025286.1) [39–40]. The Q30 percentage was over 96.4%, while GC content was over 56.3% for each sample. The gene expression values were calculated by the fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads (FPKM) method. EdgeR was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were characterized by log2(fold-change) >1 and P < 0.05 [41–42], while clusterProfiler was employed to enrich the functions and pathways of the DEGs through KEGG pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations [43]."
8,Results,
9,The poised working potentials change H2 production and gas composition,"3.1 The poised working potentials change H2 production and gas composition Total gas and H2 production by E. harbinense was significantly affected by the potentials applied to the electrodes (Fig. 2 A). The EFS obtained the highest H2 production of 1888 ± 2.13 mL/L-medium at the anode potential of 0 V (AEFS0), followed by 1733 ± 86.51 mL/L-medium at the anode potential of 0.2 V (AEFS+0.2), and 1567 ± 203.41 mL/L-medium at the anode potential of −0.2 V (AEFS-0.2). Less H2 production was observed on the OC-EFSs (1533 ± 18.75 mL/L-medium). H2 production of AEFS0 and AEFS+0.2 was significantly enhanced compared with OC-EFS (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 3). EFS produced less H2 of 0.4 ± 0.07 and 1.6 ± 0.35 mL/L-medium, while the anode poised potentials were −0.4 V (AEFS-0.4) and 0.4 V (AEFS+0.4) (Fig. 2A), indicating that the electric current affected the fermentation products and triggered them towards volatile fatty acid production. The highest H2 yield of 1.197 ± 0.001 mol-H2/mol-glucose was obtained by AEFS0 (Fig. 2B). A similar H2 yield (1.190 ± 0.009 mol-H2/mol-glucose) was obtained by anaerobic fermentation (OC-EFS) because less glucose was utilized (Fig. 3 A). The H2 yields of AEFS+0.4 and AEFS-0.4 decreased significantly compared with that of OC-EFS (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 3). Similar to the H2 production trend, the total gas production of AEFS0 and AEFS+0.2 was promoted compared with the OC-EFS (Fig. S1). Additionally, the anode with the more positive potential facilitated microbial growth. The cell wet weight in the AEFS+0.4 was the highest and reached 4.69 ± 0.05 g/L (Fig. 2B), indicating that the polarized anode in the AEFS served as a source of reducing power to drive the increase in cell biomass. In addition, the highest maximum gas production rate was obtained by AEFS+0.2 (209.5 mL/L-medium-h) followed by AEFS0 (195.5 mL/L-medium-h), which were 15–23% higher than that of OC-EFS (170.3 mL/L-medium-h). The AEFS advanced the time of peak gas production, except in AEFS0 compared with OC-EFS, and the occurrence time decreased with the increase in the potential difference between the working and reference electrodes (Fig. 2C). The earliest peak time in AEFS+0.4 was 6 h, followed by AEFS-0.4 (19 h), AEFS+0.2 (20 h), AEFS-0.2 (37 h), AEFS0, and OC-EFS (54 h) (Fig. 2C). The proportion of hydrogen was boosted in the EFS with the supplied current. AEFS-0.4 exhibited a higher proportion of hydrogen of 92 ± 3.18% vs. 68 ± 7.65% for AEFS+0.4 and 44.2–49.5% for the other AEFSs (Fig. 2D). The CEFS obtained similar gas production as the AEFS. The maximum gas production of 4156 ± 170.88 mL/L-medium, cumulative H2 production of 1986 ± 41.73 mL/L-medium, and H2 yield of 1.15 ± 0.02 mol-H2/mol-glucose were obtained by CEFS0, while very low cumulative H2 production of 10 ± 0.52 mL/L-medium was obtained by CEFS- 0.4 (Fig. S2). CEFS0 also showed the highest maximum gas production rate of 127.3 mL/L-medium-h (Fig. S3)."
10,The poised working potentials affect substrate utilization and the redox condition,"3.2 The poised working potentials affect substrate utilization and the redox condition The AEFS consumed 99–100% of the substrate (except 94 ± 8.8% by AEFS0) while glucose utilization only accounted for 76 ± 0.3% in OC-EFS, indicating that the AEFS facilitated reaching the redox balance and enhanced substrate consumption (Fig. 3A) [44]. Redox condition of the EFS plays a vital role in regulating the metabolic flux of strain YUAN-3 and a lower pH inhibits H2 production [45]. A decrease in the pH value was observed during operation due to the accumulation of acetic acid (Fig. 3B). The pH values of the EFSs plummeted during start-up of the operation, probably because of the inoculum of strain, and eventually decreased to about 3.8 within 66 h of operation, which produced an acidogenic microenvironment (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the rates of pH decrease and glucose degradation, which suggested the metabolic process, corresponded well with the hydrogen production rates. Similarly, the CEFS with different poised cathode potentials showed comparable glucose utilization and redox condition to those of the AEFS. Glucose utilization reached nearly 100% and was significantly enhanced from OC-EFS (Fig. S3). The pH value decreased and was maintained at about 3.8 resulting from the accumulation of acetic acid, which was a major factor inhibiting fermentation (Fig. S3). These results indicate that the EFS mitigated the feedback inhibition of acetic acid accumulation and facilitated substrate consumption [33]."
11,The poised working potentials affect the liquid end products,"3.3 The poised working potentials affect the liquid end products We hypothesized that the solid electron acceptor (anode) might induce the production of more reduced products from glucose in the EF system. As glucose was oxidized, ethanol and acetic acid were produced by the strain YUAN-3 [9]. Ethanol and acetic acid were detected in the AEFS, with ethanol as the predominant end-product (Fig. 4 A and B). AEFS-0.4 showed the maximum ethanol concentration of 0.074 ± 0.003 mol/L, which increased by 30.7 ± 13.3% compared with 0.057 ± 0.008 mol/L of OC-EFS, while the minimum ethanol concentration of 0.031 ± 0.003 mol/L was obtained by AEFS-0.2. The poised anode potential led to an increase in ethanol production, and the effect was more pronounced as the potential difference increased. The trend in acetic acid production was not obvious under the different AEFS conditions, but its production was slightly suppressed by the poised anode potential, and a rather higher acetic acid concentration of 0.043 ± 0.002 mol/L was observed at OC-EFS (Fig. 4B). Volatile products in the AEFS showed a good correlation with the system redox conditions, and the increase of the acetic acid production rate accompanied the increased rate of decrease in the pH value. The ratio of ethanol to acetic acid indicated that the poised potential electrically enhanced ethanol fermentation by E. harbinense in the AEFS (Fig. S4A). Positive poised cathode potentials increased ethanol production by 14% in CEFS0 compared with OC-EFS (0.057 ± 0.008 mol/L) (Fig. 4C), while negative potentials inhibited ethanol production in the CEFS (Fig. 4C). However, acetic acid production was inhibited with poised cathode potentials, and the maximum acetic acid production (0.043 ± 0.003 mol/L) was obtained in OC-EFS (Fig. 4D). The acetic acid concentration in the EFS with a poised cathode potential of 0 V was high at the beginning, but lower than that in the OC-EFS at the end of the batch. Ethanol was the predominant liquid-phase product for the cathode with a positive potential, while it changed to acetic acid with negative potentials. Overall, a positive potential was favored to enhance ethanol production, while a negative potential promoted acetic acid production by E. harbinense YUAN-3 in the CEFS (Fig. S4B)."
12,Electro-fermentation coefficient,"3.4 Electro-fermentation coefficient The electro-fermentation coefficient is a useful parameter to differentiate EF and MEC, of which values range between 0 and 1 in EF [19]. The EF coefficient and electron distribution from glucose fermentation in the AEFSs were profiled (Table 1 ). The EF coefficient of AEFS-0.4 accounted for 20.4 ± 0.77%, followed by 17.7 ± 2.50% for AEFS+0.2, 9.3 ± 3.67% for AEFS-0.2, 1.6 ± 0.76% for AEFS0, and 0.3 ± 0.08% for AEFS+0.4 (Table 1), indicating that the main purpose to use electrodes is to regulate the metabolic products of glucose fermentation by E. harbinense rather than maximizing electron recovery efficiency through generating electricity. By calculating the electron value via current, only 0.3267 ± 0.0124 mol electrons were derived from the anode in AEFS-0.4, followed by 0.2826 ± 0.0399 mol (AEFS+0.2), 0.1483 ± 0.0586 mol (AEFS-0.2), 0.0254 ± 0.0122 mol (AEFS0), and 0.047 ± 0.001 mol (AEFS+0.4). Interestingly, although the electrons from the anode accounted for 0.047 ± 0.001 mol in AEFS+0.4, ethanol production from electro-fermentation significantly increased compared with the OC-EFS (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that a small electric current made a distinct effect on promoting ethanol production by E. harbinense in the EFS."
13,The poised working potentials affect gene expression,"3.5 The poised working potentials affect gene expression As the AEFS0 and OC-EFS groups possessed higher H2 yield and the AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4 groups owned better ethanol production ability, the transcriptomic profiles of samples from groups AEFS-0.4, AEFS0, AEFS+0.4, and OC-EFS were analyzed to interpret the molecular-level reasons for changes in the fermentation product spectra under different poised working potentials. Most reads (98.76–99.81%) were mapped to the E. harbinense genome and >2720 E. harbinense genes were identified, indicating that the transcriptome data were reliable for further analysis (Table S1). Among them, 781 (420 upregulated and 371 downregulated), 212 (71 upregulated and 141 downregulated), and 348 (161 upregulated and 187 downregulated) DEGs were identified in AEFS-0.4, AEFS0, and AEFS+0.4, respectively, compared with OC-EFS (Fig. S5), suggesting their pivotal role in the E. harbinense stress response under different poised potentials. DEGs of E. harbinense under different poised potentials were analyzed by hierarchical clustering (FDR q < 0.01) (Fig. S6). The DEGs were further categorized into 19 terms by a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The biological process of DEGs mainly belonged to cellular process, metabolic process, localization, and biological regulation; cellular component attributed to cellular anatomical entity and protein-containing complex; whereas major molecular function was binding and catalytic activity (Fig. 5 ). Additionally, the DEGs encoded key enzymes associated with ethanol-H2 coproduction were identified in the AEFSs. Three genes encoding [FeFe]-hydrogenase (hydA) (Ethha_2614 and Ethha_1720) and [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturase (hydG) (Ethha_0141), which enable to catalyze H2 production metabolism, were significantly upregulated in AEFSs compared with the OC-EFS (Fig. 6 A–C). The HydG (Ethha_0141) expression level was 1.32 log2(fold-change) higher in AEFS0, indicating facilitation of [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation compared to OC-EFS (Fig. 2). Although hydG (Ethha_0141) and hydA (Ethha_2614) in AEFS-0.4 and hydA (Ethha_1720) in AEFS+0.4 were upregulated, expression of the ferredoxin encoding gene (Ethha_0976) was downregulated by −1.14 and −1.12 log2(fold-change), respectively in AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4 (Fig. 6D). In addition, genes encoding ferredoxin (Ethha_1937 and Ethha_1933) and rubredoxin (Ethha_1935) involved in electron transfer were significantly upregulated in the AEFSs compared to OC-EFS (Fig. 6E–G), in which expression increased the most in AEFS0 followed by AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4, suggesting that the capacity for electron transfer was enhanced by E. harbinense electro-fermentation. Additionally, the DEGs also explained the changes of ethanol generation in the AEFSs. A significant increase in the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase (Ethha_1726) by 2.53 log2(fold-change) was observed in the anode biofilms of AEFS+0.4 (Fig. 6H), which explained why ethanol production improved at 48 h compared with that in OC-EFS (Fig. 4A). Two iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Ethha_0580 and Ethha_1164) were downregulated in the anode biofilms of AEFS-0.4 by −1.04 and −1.06 log2(fold-change), respectively (Fig. 6I and J). Interestingly, a significant decrease in the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (Ethha_0578) (log2(fold-change) values < −1.4) was detected, whereas the expression level of the gene encoding pyruvate formate lyase-activating protein (Ethha_1656) increased (log2(fold-change) value >1.2) in AEFSs (Fig. 6K and L). These results suggest that electro-fermentation by E. harbinense facilitated more pyruvate molecules to decompose to acetyl-coenzyme A, while inhibiting the further generation of acetaldehyde. Furthermore, the expression of some genes associated with NADH and NAD+ conversion also showed changes. A gene (Ethha_2616) involved in catalyzing the reduction or oxidation of a substrate coupled to NAD(P)H or NAD(P)+ was upregulated by 1.51 log2(fold-change), while Ethha_2615 encoding the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit NuoF was upregulated by 1.15 log2(fold-change) in AEFS-0.4 (Fig. 7 A and B), which resulted in more NAD+ regenerated from NADH. Two genes (Ethha_1934 and Ethha_1745) encoding hydroxylamine reductase, which catalyze the reduction of hydroxylamine to form NH3 and H2O in the presence of NADH, were upregulated, and were, respectively, 3.65 and 3.31 log2(fold-change) higher in AEFS0, followed by 2.34 and 2.01 log2(fold-change) higher in AEFS-0.4, and 2.23 and 2.05 log2(fold-change) higher in AEFS+0.4 than those in OC-EFS (Fig. 7C and D). Moreover, genes participating in the ABC transport system were downregulated in the AEFSs, including ABC transporter permease, ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein, carbohydrate ABC transporter permease, and sugar ABC transporter permease (Table 2 ). AEFS-0.4 had the greatest number of downregulated genes and the highest downregulation value, followed by the AEFS+0.4 group, while AEFS0 had the least effect on the ABC transport system."
14,Discussion,
15,Electro-fermentation by E. Harbinense increases ethanol-H2 coproduction,"4.1 Electro-fermentation by E. Harbinense increases ethanol-H2 coproduction The glucose utilization and growth of E. harbinense were enhanced by providing a solid electron sink, demonstrating an increased cellular energy supply in the EFS [46–47]. E. harbinense gained more energy for faster cell growth at a higher anode potential; thus, promoting bacterial activity [48]. In addition, the poised potential enhanced ethanol-H2 coproduction by E. harbinense in the EFS. More ethanol production was achieved in AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4 (0.073–0.074 mol/L) than that in OC-EFS (0.057 ± 0.008 mol/L) (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 4), while H2 production by AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4 (0.4–1.6 mL/L-medium) was far less than that in OC-EFS (1533 ± 18.75 mL/L-medium). These results suggest that the poised potential affected the fermentation products and triggered ethanol production at poised anode potentials of −0.4 V and +0.4 V. The accumulation of acetic acid decreased in the EFS compared to OC-EFS (Fig. 4), which often results in feedback inhibition of fermentation [49], suggesting that the EFS mitigated the impaired acetic acid accumulation and facilitated substrate consumption. Also, the impact of the poised potentials on metabolite production was different. A negative cathode potential facilitated acetic acid production but not that of ethanol, while it showed opposite results under positive cathode and anode potentials. In the AEFS, the poised potentials of −0.2 V, 0 V, and 0.2 V promoted cumulative H2 production compared with the OC-EFS, but not −0.4 V or 0.4 V (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the maximum H2 production rates of AEFS0 and AEFS+0.2 were higher than that of OC-EFS (Fig. 2C). The highest H2 yield was obtained by AEFS0, implying that an optimal intracellular ORP conducive to hydrogen production can be created at a poised potential of 0 V. These results support the hypothesis that the target products can be effectively enhanced by using an electrode as an electron source or sink to regulate the redox potential."
16,The electrode potential regulates the metabolic product spectrum,"4.2 The electrode potential regulates the metabolic product spectrum When E. harbinense YUAN-3 was cultivated in the BES, it produced electricity, and a peak voltage of 71 mV (1000 external resistance) was observed (Fig. S7), which proved that it possesses electroactivity to exchange electrons with the electrodes. Therefore, E. harbinense YUAN-3 might accept electrons from an electrode or a soluble electron shuttle through direct or indirect EET, thus redirecting glucose metabolism. Different from a MFC, which aiming at producing electrical current, EF devotes to influent metabolic flux using electrodes, thereby observing weak electricity and an EF coefficient value of 0–1. Therefore, the current generated in an EFS is insufficient to interpret the metabolic product changes [50–51]. In this study, 0.047 ± 0.001 mol electron in forms of current under a poised anode potential of 0.4 V, the ethanol production increased by 25.7% in comparison with the OC-EFS. Even though the current was small, its impact on the fermentation products was high. Likewise, in CEFS only 0.2% of the total electron input was from the cathode, which caused three times higher butanol production than the control group [24]. Additionally, a more negative anode potential was conducive to generating higher current density, while more positive anode potentials provided more free energy to promote the growth of the bacteria [48]. A recent study demonstrated the metabolic pathway of H2-ethanol coproduction by E. harbinense YUAN-3, in which glucose was metabolized into pyruvate via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, whereby NAD+ is reduced to NADH with the pyruvate kinase, then pyruvate is oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) [34]. In addition, electrons captured by PFOR pass through the ferredoxin chain and meet H+ and [FeFe]-hydrogenase to produce H2. Then, part of the acetyl-CoA is converted to acetic acid by acetate kinase; another part becomes acetaldehyde by aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is reduced to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase, while NADH is recycled to NAD+ [34,52]. The intracellular ORP indicating the redox status inside a cell, which is affected by the extracellular ORP, is mainly determined by the reduced oxidized NAD (NADH/NAD+) balance [21]. Additionally, bacteria regulate the expression of metabolic processes by sensing redox states [53]. Therefore, we assumed that NAD+ was regenerated from NADH by regulating extracellular ORP using the electrodes [31], which may lead to more reducing equivalents being transferred via the fermentative pathways [54]. The transcriptome analysis proved that hypothesis as the increased expression of genes participating in NADH regeneration in AEFS-0.4, such as NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase subunit E and NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit NuoF, suggesting activation of NADH-dependent catabolic pathways [26]. Thus, higher ethanol production presented in AEFS-0.4 and the higher ratio of ethanol and acetic acid in the liquid end-products implied that a metabolic shift to rapidly consume reducing equivalents (NADH) occurred as electrons were accepted by E. harbinense YUAN-3 in the EFS. The metabolic pathway of Corynebacterium glutamicum is regulated by the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio, thus promoting biomass yield and L-lysine production in AEFS [54]. It has also been reported that the NADH/NAD+ ratio increases as the electrode potential increases until it reaches a threshold that inhibits essential metabolic pathways for current generation [26,55–56]. Part of the excess electrons are dissipated at the anode through EET mechanisms, while others tend to reduce the NADH/NAD+ ratio, leading to regulation of the NADH regeneration metabolic pathways [19]."
17,Metabolic regulation of E. Harbinense via electro-fermentation,"4.3 Metabolic regulation of E. Harbinense via electro-fermentation The global transcriptome analysis indicated that E. harbinense responded to the electrode potential by regulating electron transfer and affecting the ABC transport system. The highest H2 production rate was obtained by AEFS0 (Fig. 2C), in accordance with the upregulated genes encoding [FeFe]-hydrogenase, ferredoxin, and rubredoxin. Ferredoxin acts as an important electron transporter in conjunction with [FeFe]-hydrogenase that function in H2 production [34,57], and their overexpression suggests that electron transfer and H2 production capability in AEFS0 were increased. Although the overexpression of two hydA genes occurred in AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4, where little H2 was generated, expression of the gene encoding the 4Fe-4S dicluster domain-containing protein (Ethha_0976), as the core active center component in [FeFe]-hydrogenase, was significantly downregulated, indicating impaired H2 production in AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4 (Fig. 2) [45,58]. Additionally, increased expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene was detected in AEFS+0.4, which agreed with the higher ethanol production than in OC-EFS. However, two alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding genes were downregulated in AEFS-0.4. Thus, we hypothesized that the enhanced ethanol production in AEFS-0.4 occurred because of the overexpression of electron transfer-related genes (encoding ferredoxin and rubredoxin) and the induced NADH-dependent catabolic pathways [28,59]. This study also showed that the electrode potential during electro-fermentation affected the ABC transport system. Twenty-two genes involved in the ABC transport process were downregulated, especially in AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4 (Table 2). The ABC transporter utilizes the energy of hydrolyzed ATP to carry out transmembrane transport of various molecules, including sugars, amino acids, metal ions, polypeptides, proteins, and metabolites [60]. The gene expression of ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and ABC transporter ATP-binding protein was downregulated in AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4, while some genes encoding ABC transporter permeases, including carbohydrate ABC transporter permease, sugar ABC transporter permease, and ABC transporter permease, were also downregulated mostly in AEFS-0.4 and AEFS+0.4. The downregulation of these genes leads to decreased substrate affinity and suppresses substrate transport [61]. Taken together, even though some [FeFe]-hydrogenase related genes were upregulated, H2 production was inhibited. Hence, strategies aimed at increasing the efficiency of substrate transport should be followed up. Additionally, regulating metabolic pathways towards more ethanol or acetic acid production by E. harbinense is beneficial for bioresource recovery by chain elongation. It has been reported that iso-caproate (C6) and n-caproic acid (C6) can be produced via ethanol-based chain elongation in long-term anaerobic reactors [62]. Acetate has been used to produce medium-chain fatty acids with ethanol and hydrogen as electron donors in a mixed culture dominated by Clostridium kluyveri [63]. Regulating the EF towards improved recovery of VFAs and alcohols from fermentation would be more conductive to resource recovery and fit the purpose of production of high-value chemicals [28,50,64]. Therefore, further study is required to coculture E. harbinense with other microbes, such as Clostridium kluyveri and Eubacterium limosum [65], to generate medium- or long-chain fatty acids in the EFS and explore the expression of cellular processes under different operating parameters."
18,Conclusion,"This study demonstrated that ethanol-H2 coproducing metabolic flux of E. harbinense could be regulated by changing the potential of the working electrode in an EFS. Maximum hydrogen production was obtained by the AEFS and CEFS with a poised potential of 0 V. The poised anode potential contributed to increase ethanol production, which increased as the potential difference increased, and the maximum ethanol production of 0.074 ± 0.003 mol/L was obtained by AEFS-0.4. Glucose uptake and microbial growth were enhanced in the EFS with increased cellular energy supply. The transcriptome analysis indicated that overexpression of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase, ferredoxin, and rubredoxin genes facilitated H2 production at 0 V. This study demonstrated that NADH consuming pathways were significantly induced with a small amount of electron uptake, leading to enhanced ethanol generation. Moreover, the underexpression of ABC transport system-related genes resulted in lower hydrogen production at lower or higher potentials. These findings suggest that controlling the redox conditions and electron flow is an effective approach to coordinate metabolic flux by fermentative bacteria."
