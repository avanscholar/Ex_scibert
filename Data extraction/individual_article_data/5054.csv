0,Introduction,"Polymer electrolytes used on the electrochemical systems, such as electro-chrome displays, batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, etc. Recently, Solid polymer electrolytes and composites have considerable attention between scientific societies. The dipping of metal, as filler, even with small amounts into the polymeric matrix, introduces a significant enhancement for their properties [1,2]. This helps to advance new materials of wanted properties for specific applications [3]. Several stages of development have been completed in the field of electrolytes, ranging from dry polymers, electrolytes (P.E.s) to plasticized polymers, gels, rubbery, and micro/nanocomposite polymers. The optical properties are noteworthy in developing composite materials to be utilized in the field of advanced technology of electrochromic displays, optoelectronics, fuel cell, rechargeable batteries, etc. Generally, the physical properties of the polymeric composites rely on the type of the chemical nature of the fillers and the mechanism of interaction between the two compounds (filler and polymeric matrix) [4]. The polymer electrolytes (P.E.s) are macromolecules having many ionic or ionizable groups [5]. The electronic conduction in this type of materials takes place via two separate events: (I) The ions migration in coordinate sites for the polymer and (II) The segmental motion of the polymeric chain [6]. The ionic conductivity is powerfully affected by different factors like crystalline structure, the formation of ion-pair, as well as simultaneous anion and cation motions. These influences reduce the conductivity of cationic and, thus, act as a limitation for potential applications [7–10]. Many of applied research of composites that setup on PVA (Poly(vinyl alcohol)) was announced for different uses as insulators or/and solid conducting [11]. PVA is the most appealing polymer as it has a hydrophilic character, a large density of volatile functional groups, cheap and abundantly accessible [12]. The flexibility of PVA chains occurs as a result of either intra-or inter-molecular connections and is temperature-dependent, adds mainly to cooling procedures supported by segmental movement and the collective rotation in polymers [13]. PVA is the prospective polymer used as a dielectric because of the characteristics of its excellent storage ability of charge, additive dependent properties, the high value of dielectric and mechanical strength [14,15]. SnBr2 and SnCl2 crystal structures are related to the orthorhombic form of PbCl2 [16]. The lead halides have significant attention due to their interesting given lattice-electron interaction. The electron self-trapping (STEL) was observed to happen, for the first time, in PbCl2 [17,18]. Moreover, the band of luminescence correlated with the center of STEL was found in PbBr2 and PbCl2 [19,20]. Since SnBr2 and SnCl2 have the lattice type of PbCl2 and isoelectronic arrangement of lead halides, they enhanced the understanding of the mechanism of energy relaxation, which has STEL to investigate their optical properties. Nevertheless, a few studies on the optical properties of SnBr2 and SnCl2 have been stated. It was reported in previous papers that SnBr2 has a sharp exciton peak in the spectra of reflection at 3.4 eV [21]. Moreover, even there is some work on electrical and optical characteristics of Poly(methyl methacrylate) and PVA with SnCl2 [4,22,23], but there is no work about the influence of SnBr2 on the properties of PVA. In the present work, the samples of different ratios of SnBr2 dipped in PVA were fabricated by casting solution techniques to examine the optical properties. The structural characterization, optical, AC electrical conductivity, and dielectric properties of the investigated polymer electrolytes are discussed. The necessary data about the energy gap and the changes of optical in the thick films can be found from the shift and shape of the transmission and absorbance spectra. Moreover, critical optical parameters as the extinction coefficient, optical conductivity, and refractive index and dielectric constant, and dielectric loss as a function of wavelength were calculated."
1,Experimental details,
2,Synthesis of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films,"2.1 Synthesis of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) from Alpha chemical India has molecular weight 1,25,000, and 98 % of hydrolyzed was used. Tin (II) bromide, (SnBr2), also was purchased from Merck Lab, India. A 45 g of PVA powder was dissolved in 1 L of distilled water with continuous magnetic stirring at 700 rpm and 80 °C for 24 h until a clear transparent solution was found. The PVA solution was left for 7 days to make all residuals in PVA solution to be precipitated in the bottom of the beaker and then, it will be ready for further investigations. A 40 mL of PVA solution was poured in a highly cleaned 10.5 cm Peter dish and left in the dryer furnace at 35 °C for 5 days (Note: the furnace fan must work well to circulate the air inside the furnace). The weight percentages of SnBr2 are (0, 0.088, 0.44, 0.88, 4.4, 8.8, 22.2, and 44.44 wt%) were added to the 40 mL PVA solution and mixed at the magnetic stirrer for 60 min to have a homogeneous solution of SnBr2/PVA composites. The SnBr2/PVA mixed solution was poured in the 10.5 cm Petri dish and inserted in the dryer furnace with the same conditions as given above for the pure one. After the dryness of the SnBr2/PVA films, it was removed and cut in suitable dimensions for further studies. The thickness of the films around ∼ 0.12 mm."
3,Devices and characterization,"2.2 Devices and characterization Shimadzu powder diffractometer of model (X-ray diffraction)-6000 with wavelength =1.5418 Å from CuK α radiation monochromatic source and diffraction range 10°- 60° were used for recording the phases coming from the SnBr2 doped PVA polymeric films. Moreover, F.T. (Fourier transform)-IR spectrometer of model Thermo Nicolet 6700 was used, with wavenumber ranging from 400 cm−1 to 4 × 103 cm−1, to specify the active group in SnBr2 and without doped PVA by measuring the transmission FTIR spectra. The optical absorbance (Abs.) and transmittance (T%) were recorded between 190–2500 nm via the JASCO spectrophotometer (V-570) at normal incidence. A programmable automatic LCR meter (Model FLUKE-PM6306) was utilized to measure the properties of dielectric (dielectric capacitance and loss) over the range of 100 Hz - 1 MHz at 30 °C for the wholly as-synthesized SnBr2/PVA films. Homemade designed holder from brass and Teflon was used for the electrical measurements."
4,Results and discussions,
5,The structure studies of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films,"3.1 The structure studies of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films 3.1.1 Analysis of X-ray diffraction Fig. 1 demonstrated XRD data of pure and SnBr2-doped PVA thick films. A broad peak at 19.23° was detected, which corresponding to the semicrystalline nature for un-doping PVA [24]. Moreover, it was observed that a decrease and an increment in the level of intensity and width of the detected peak, respectively, with the argument of SnBr2 percentage. This could be due to the disorder of the PVA crystallinity that shows the amorphous nature of SnBr2-doped PVA polymeric composites. This disorder nature leads to more diffusion of ions with high conductivity [25]. Previous work reported a similar result that the intensity of the XRD pattern reduces with increasing the dopant content in the polymer matrix [26]. This has recognized a connection between the peak height and the crystallinity degree. Besides, no extra and sharp peaks associated with tin bromide were noticed, which indicates the dissolution of the whole salt in the PVA matrix. 3.1.2 Analysis of FTIR spectroscopy The interaction of a metal salt with a polymeric matrix was tracked via the transmittance mode of FTIR, as observed in Fig. 2 . The modifications in the vibration PVA modes, caused by the incorporation of SnBr2, were evaluated. An influential I.R. band has appeared at a broader wavenumber region are contributing to the existence of PVA groups. The most distinguishing characteristic of PVA broad band is 3294 cm−1. This group moved to 3230 cm−1, after adding SnBr2, with a loss of width. It is allocated to OH straining that existing throughout intra-and intermolecular hydrogen connections of the structure. Due to the extension of the CH, in the group of alkyl, the band at 2921 cm−1 was occurred and displaced to 2938 cm−1. Moreover, the group that detected at 1730 cm-1 was referring to the stretching of CO, and its strength diminished with rising the weight of SnBr2 and transferred to 1638 cm−1. The band that appears at 1405 cm−1 and transferred to 1423 cm−1 is referring to the bending contribution of CH 2. The other that located at 1373 cm−1 and 1241 cm−1 are assigning to CH 2 wagging and CH rocking, where their intensity is decreased concerning SnBr2 concentration. Furthermore, the stretching of CO, CH, and OH deformation of PVA is located at 108 cm−1, while the CH wagging and bending of CH are presented by the band that saw at 943 cm−1 [24]. The interval that noted at 832 cm−1 is for CO skeleton straining. The band that monitored and linked at 600 cm−1 is pointing to the wagging of CH wagging. The width of this crest also declined with the increase of SnBr2 volume. The relationship between SnBr2 and the PVA and construction of SnBr2/PVA hybrid structure is confirmed by these differences in FTIR spectra [27–29]."
6,The optical analysis of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films,"3.2 The optical analysis of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films The spectra of the optical transmission (T %) were recorded, for SnBr2-doped PVA samples, between 2500 nm and 190 nm. As displayed in Fig. 3 , the performance of this spectrum is directly related to the microstructure, which relies on the level percentage of SnBr2 fillings. The highest transmitting value was measured for PVA without doping and equal approximately to 90 %, while this value decreased gradually to 54 % with a further increment of SnBr2 like that previously reported for doping polymeric material [29]. This can be explained by the increment of the disorders inside the matrix because of the complex relations between the dopant ions and the matrix via OH groups. The absorbance (Abs.) results for all composite samples in the same previous wavelength range and it is depicted in Fig. 4 . It is noticeable that with the rising of the SnBr2 concentration, the absorption property increased. Therefore, the SnBr2 level plays an essential rule in controlling the transmission and absorbance properties of PVA. The spectrum of optical absorption is an essential means of generating the crystalline and amorphous material's optical band gap energy. The primary absorption corresponding to the electron excitation from the valance band to the conductive band can be utilized to find out the nature and value of the optical bandgap. The bandgap, Eg , of each sample can be estimated with the help of Tauc’s question [30]: (1) α h υ = B ( h υ - E g ) m , where B, hυ, Eg are constant, the photon energy, and the optical energy gap, while α is the absorption coefficient that can be calculated by using the formula [29] : α = 2.303 A b s . t where t is the film thickness, and m = 1/2 for indirect and 2 for directly allowed transitions. The results which were obtained from the extrapolating the linear part of the Figs. 5 and 6 have been documented in Table 1 . The Eg(ind ) (indirect bandgap) was felled from 4.93 eV to 2.39 eV for PVA:44.44 wt% of Sn2+ films, whereas the Eg(d ) (direct bandgap), has been reduced from 5.6 eV for a pure sample of PVA to 3.73 eV for 44.44 wt% of Sn2+-ions. This established the reduction of the forbidden band as well as the creation of energy levels with raising Sn2+-ion contents [22,31,32]. Those defects are responsible for the localized states in the bandgap that match the disorder level in enlarged samples and that can be the main cause of the charge transfer complex (CTC)-generation charging complex due to the interaction/coordination between PVA chains and Sn2+-ion contents. Moreover, the composites require lower energies for Eg(ind ) than for Eg(d ). This behavior has been reported before in SnCl2/PMMA [4], SnCl2/PVA [29], PVA/PVP/LiBr [28], PVA/NaI [33], PVA/PVP/SnO2 [34] and PVA:CdCl2.H2O [35] polymer composite electrolyte films (as shown in Table 1). The value of the indirect energy band gap is smaller than that of direct energy for all SnBr2/PVA composite films, as well. To specify the polarizability inside the films and their applications, some parameters are necessary to specify like refractive index (n) and extinction (k) coefficient, as well as the dielectric constant. The k values of the samples were evaluated using the relations [36]: (2) k = α λ 4 π , (3) n = 1 + R 1 − R + 4 R ( 1 − R ) 2 − k 2 , where λ ( i n n m ) is a well-known parameter and R is the measured reflectance. It is observed that k rises with raising SnBr2 content and decreases with increasing wavelength values, as presented in Fig. 7 . The extinction coefficient (k) behavior can be related to; SnBr2-salt damps the maximum value of the electromagnetic wave within the SnBr2/PVA film. The results show that SnBr2-dopants modulate the host polymer structure. Moreover, for spectral dispersion devices and optical communications, the value of n is considered as a significant parameter that should be determined [37]. Fig. 8 shows the increment of the magnitude of n with a gradual increase of SnBr2 level in PVA as well as these values have small variation at high wavelengths. This increment can be described to increase packing density due to SnBr2-dopants on the internal structure of the PVA matrix [38]. With the rise of the wavelength, the refractive index decreases. The refractive index for pure PVA calculated by Mahshad Ghanipour et al [39] in the range from 1.73 to 1.96 for plasmonic Ag-doped PVA films. Omed Gh. Abdullah et al [40] studied the PVA-doped with CdCl2.H2O and they found the refractive index of pure PVA in the range from 1.2 to 1.9. Such differences between the mentioned values in this work for the pure PVA and the as-reported data can be attributed to the nature of PVA used for the preparation of the PVA films such as molecular weight and the purity of PVA powder. Also, the real and imaginary parts ( ε r and ε i ) of the dielectric of the present polymer electrolytes are influenced by the dopant percentage, as presented in Fig. 9 (a and b). Their values are determined from the following relations [41–43]: (4) ε r = n 2 - k 2 , (5) ε i = 2 n k , The real part of the dielectric constant decreased with increasing the wavelength and enhanced with the addition of SnBr2 to the host matrix (see Fig. 9a). While for the imaginary part of the dielectric constant (see Fig. 9b), the ε i deceased with wavelength until a certain value then followed by its increasing with the further wavelength. It is noticed that ε i increased with increasing the SnBr2 filler in the PVA matrix. Also, the real dielectric constant of the samples is higher than their imaginary values, while both parts decrease with the wavelength. This finding is mainly due to the rise in the studied polymeric nanocomposite films SnBr2/PVA in the energy density states (DOS) compared to the pure PVA one. According to the filler SnBr2, the increase in the DOS increases polarization and therefore increases the real dielectric constant ( ε r ). Although the rise in ε i as the wt percentage of the SnBr2 filler rises from 0 to 10.0 percent is mainly attributable to the variations of the dipole motion [44–47]. The optical conductivity ( σ o p ) for SnBr2 doped PVA polymer electrolytes was determined from the following relation [36]: (6) σ o p = n c α 4 π , From Fig. 10 , an increment in the optical conductivity was noticed with the increment of the doping ratio of SnBr2. This means that on the incorporation of the Sn2+-ions in the PVA matrix, the transitions of electrons between the valence and conduction bands are further facilitating, as mentioned before, owing to the decrease of the energy gap. The increase in optical conductivity, as SnBr2 wt percent increases in the PVA matrix, is caused by an increase in the charging carriers’ concentration and absorption of incident photons [44]."
7,Electrical properties of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films,"3.3 Electrical properties of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films Fig. 11 shows the frequency-dependent AC conductivity for SnBr2/PVA polymer electrolyte achieved at room temperature. The values of AC electrical conductivity (σAC ) were investigated using the following relation [24]: (7) σ A C = 2 π f ε o ε "" , where 2πf is the angular frequency, ε o = 8.854 x 10 - 12 F . m - 1 is the free space permittivity, and ε"" is the dielectric loss. As shown in the figure, with increasing frequency, the conductivity of each sample increases. PVA polymer serves as a medium for ionic movement. The (σAC ) has gradually increased with increasing frequency due to ionic motion caused by the conducting pathways generated by the doping of the SnBr2 salt. The figure displays dispersion in the low frequency due to polarization of the space charging and plateau in higher frequency regions. This produced by mobile ions hopping and implies the production of conductive pathways that enhance ionic movement and thus provide high ionic conductivity in disordered solids [43]. The (σAC ) of the SnBr2/PVA composite films is much higher than the pure PVA, and the conductivity is found to increase with increasing the concentrations of tin bromide in the polymeric system. The higher conductivity of SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films is due to the uniform dispersion, and the spatial arrangement of metal particles within the polymer matrix, and this result is in precise agreement with the XRD studies. In the low-frequency region, the (σAC ) conductivity pattern displays a frequency-independent plateau while at higher frequencies, it shows dispersion behavior. This behavior obeys the universal power law [24]: (8) σ A C ω = A ω s , where A and S are material constants. The exponent (s) can be computed from the plots of lnσAC versus lnω, which is lies between 0 and 1. Fig. 12 represents the values of exponent, as we can see that the values of (s) lie in near unity. It is quite clear the decrease in the values of S with raising SnBr2 concentration. The performance of (s) indicates the relation between the mechanism of conduction and the Correlated Barrier Hopping (CBH) model [23]. Dielectric analysis in polymeric materials is a powerful tool to obtain information about the mechanisms of relaxation and conduction. The values of dielectric constant ε ' and dielectric loss ε ' ' have been calculated from the following relations [48]: (9) ε ' = C t ε o A , (10) ε ' ' = ε ' t a n δ , Fig. 13 displays the dependence of the dielectric constant on the frequency for SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte composites. There is a clear decrease in the values of dielectric constant with raising the frequency. The increase in the frequency leads to a decrease in the space charge polarization at the interface with the electrode that can follow the applied field at low frequency. It is the most contribution to the small frequencies’ region. The self-orientation of space charge polarization decreased with raising the applied frequency from 100 Hz to 1 × 106 Hz due to the rapid variations of the electric field, which in turn cause a decrease in the dielectric constant for SnBr2/PVA polymeric electrolyte films. The other polarization contributions appear in the following frequencies, and the change of ionic polarization is less responsive to the variation in the applied frequency than that of electronic polarization. This is related to the reason that the mass of the ions is more prominent than electrons mass. Therefore, the response of electrons to the oscillation is significant and occurs only at high frequencies, which produce an approximately fixed value of the dielectric constant [49,50]. It is also evident from Fig. 13 that the values of dielectric constant increase for a higher concentration of SnBr2 dopant, while it is the lowest value for pure PVA (see Table 2 ). Concerning the conductivity and dielectric constant spectrums, one can say that the ion motion and polymer chain segmental motions were connected [51]. The change of dielectric loss, for SnBr2/PVA composites, with frequency, is presented in Fig. 14 . The figure displays that the dielectric loss is high at low frequencies but decreased gradually with the frequency, which is ascribed to a small contribution of ionic polarization with the frequency [52]. At the higher frequency, the dielectric loss is approximately fixed due to another polarization mechanism. We observe that the value of dielectric loss increased with the concentration of (SnBr2) because of the increase of ionic carriers. Increased dielectric loss with increasing salt content can be connected to conductivity. Due to the presence of rotating polar bonds of side groups, the PVA displays extreme dielectric transitions. Increasing salt content adjusts chemical composition due to hydrogen bonds with OH groups formed in the complexation process. Therefore, the polymer also becomes flexible, and the conductivity increases. This is like the results reported before by researchers [53–56]. At low frequency, the values of ε ' ' increase with increasing SnBr2 concentrations (see Table 2)."
8,Conclusion,"In this study, polymer electrolytes of SnBr2/PVA have been prepared using the facile casting technique. XRD analysis indicated the amorphous polymer domains that increased with tin bromide concentrations. The peak position changed, and reduced width in the OH band was detected in the FTIR spectroscopy. Stretching CH wagging was decreased as the concentration of SnBr2 increased. The bromide peak intensity increased by increasing SnBr2 salt content, which indicates good interaction between the SnBr2 salt and PVA polymer matrix. The discrepancy in the FTIR band emphasizes the collaboration of SnBr2 with the PVA matrix. The absorbance of (SnBr2/PVA) composites increases with doping concentrations, while Eg (indirect and direct) is reduced. The dielectric constant and loss augmented with the wt% of SnBr2 at smaller values of frequency, and they decreased exponentially with an increase in frequency due to the density of state in the bandgap. σAC spectra show dispersion in a lower frequency region and plateau with a higher frequency region. The value determined for the frequency exponent is decreased as the SnBr2 content increases, consistent with the CBH model. The improvement in electrical conductivity of PVA with increasing the SnBr2 dopant allows its applications in electronic, optoelectronic and electrochemical devices as a solid polymer electrolyte."
