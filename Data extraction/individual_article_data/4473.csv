0,Introduction,"Chalcones are α,β-unsaturated ketones within the family of flavonoids that find wide utilisation in the manufacture of pesticides (e.g. benzylideneacetophenone), pharmaceuticals (e.g. 2ˈ-hydroxychalcone, 2ˈ-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone and 2ˈ-aminochalcone) and food additives (e.g. 4,2ˈ,4ˈ-trihydroxychalcone) [1,2]. Industrial chalcone manufacture is based on batch liquid phase condensation of acetophenone- and benzaldehyde-derivatives (Claisen-Schmidt reaction, Scheme 1 ) using basic (e.g. alkaline hydroxides) or acid (e.g. sulfuric acid and HCl) homogeneous catalysts [3]. This route suffers severe drawbacks in terms of significant formation of undesired products (benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid, path (II) in Scheme 1) through benzaldehyde disproportionation (Cannizzaro reaction) [4]. In addition, product separation and catalyst recovery impact on efficiency, but this issue can be circumvented moving to heterogeneous systems. Heterogeneous catalysis studies have been exclusively focused on batch liquid phase reaction over solid acid (e.g. zeolite [5], montmorillonite [6] and Amberlyst-15 [7]) and basic catalysts (e.g. MgO [8,9], hydrotalcites [10], bentonite clay [11] and activated carbons [12]), where greater chalcone production rates have been recorded over basic systems [5]. Indeed, Tichit and co-workers [13] have demonstrated that condensation rate is governed by the basic character of the catalyst, where any contribution due to catalyst acidity in catalytic activity is minor. The solvent polarity can influence the activity and/or selectivity in chalcone synthesis [14–16], although the effect is still far from understood. Enhanced catalytic activity in the condensation of acetophenones + 5-hydroxymethylfurfural over a hydrated Al/Mg mixed oxide was reported using acetonitrile (dielectric constant (ε) = 37) compared to ethanol (24), attributed to a lower activation energy of the solvated transition state in the most polar solvent [4]. On the other hand, a (3-fold) decrease in activity was recorded in the condensation of acetone with benzaldehyde over hydrotalcites using ethanol + water vs. acetonitrile with similar polarity (ε = 34 ± 4) and attributed to poisoning of basic sites [17]. Wang and Cheng [16] investigating the batch condensation of 2ˈ-hydroxyacetophenone + benzaldehyde over aminopropyl-functionalized silica recorded a (50%) lower selectivity to 2ˈ-hydroxychalcone using 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (vs. dimethyl sulfoxide) with lower ε (2 vs. 49), although the authors did not elaborate further. A switch from batch liquid to gas phase continuous mode serves to decrease the associated energy demands while economies of scale favour continuous processes for large throughput, but a search through the open literature failed to unearth any reports of chalcone production in continuous gas phase operation. Catalyst lifetime is an important consideration in terms of commercial application, but severe catalyst deactivation in chalcone production has been a common feature [4,18]. This can be partly ascribed to the high contact time in batch systems that serves to enhance blockage of active sites [4,19]. An understanding of reaction pathway and mechanism are critical to elucidate the nature/role of the active sites and optimise reactor design for the development of a feasible industrial process. The mechanism of Claisen-Schmidt condensation in heterogeneous systems is still open to discussion and Eley-Rideal [20] and Langmuir-Hinshelwood [17] models have been invoked to account for the observed rate behaviour. Furthermore, the process has been viewed in terms of nucleophilic attack [17], but the structure of the reactive adsorbed species [5,21,22], the nature of the rate-controlling step [17,23,24] and the catalytically active sites [25,26] are still a matter of some debate. We view continuous gas phase catalytic condensation of acetophenones- and benzaldehyde-derivatives at atmospheric pressure as an innovative means of manufacturing chalcones. Taking the production of benzylidenacetophenone (via Claisen-Schmidt condensation of acetophenone + benzaldehyde), as representative of a valuable chalcone [27], we examine the effect of basicity on the catalytic performance for a series of oxide catalysts (SiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, CeO2 and MgO). The condensation reaction is subjected to a kinetic and mechanistic treatment, mass transfer limitations are considered while catalyst long-term stability is assessed."
1,Material and methods,
2,Catalyst characterisation,"2.1 Catalyst characterisation The SiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, CeO2, and MgO oxide catalysts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and sieved (ATM fine tests sieves) into a batch of 75 μm mean particle diameter (d catalyst), prior to catalytic measurements. The morphology (size and shape) of the oxides was evaluated by XRD and scanning (SEM, FEI Scios/XLF30-FEG), transmission (TEM, JEOL HEM 2011) and scanning transmission (STEM, 2200FS field emission gun-equipped unit) electron microscopy, employing Gatan Digital Micrograph 1.82 for data acquisition/manipulation. Powder X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were recorded on a Bruker/Siemens D500 incident X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Oxides were scanned at 0.02° step-1 over the range 5° ≤ 2θ ≤ 85° and the diffractograms identified against the JCPDS-ICDD reference standards, i.e. SiO2 (101–0921), ZnO (070–8070), CeO2 (043–1002), MgO (087–0651), tetragonal (t-ZrO2, 152–5705) and monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2, 101–0912). The fraction of tetragonal zirconia (V t) was obtained based on the method described by Gazzoli et al. [28], using the integrated areas (A i) of the (1 0 1) t-ZrO2 and (1 1 1) and (1 1 −1) m-ZrO2 planes, according to (1) V t = Q t 1.34 · 1 - Q t + Q t where Q t represents the area ratio, defined as: (2) Q t = A t (1 0 1) A t (1 0 1) + A m (1 1 1) + A m (1 1 -1) The crystallite size (d XRD) was estimated using the Scherrer expression assuming negligible contributions of strain/instrumental broadening to reflection widths [29]. Carbon dioxide temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was employed to analyse the concentration and strength of surface basic sites. CO2-TPD and specific surface area (SSA) measurements were recorded using the CHEM-BET 3000 (Quantachrome Instrument) unit (detector = TCD, software = TPR WinTM 1.0, mass flow controller = Brooks). The oxide catalysts (50–300 mg) were first loaded into a cell (U-shaped Pyrex glass, internal diameter = 3.76 mm), outgassed (ramp = 10 K min−1, final temperature = 573 K, final isothermal hold time = 1 h) in helium (flow = 40 cm3 min−1, BOC, ≥99.99%) and cooled to 323 K. A continuous flow of carbon dioxide (flow = 40 cm2 min−1, BOC, 99.5%, time = 30 min) was subsequently introduced, sufficient for surface saturation. The oxides were then thoroughly flushed with helium (flow = 80 cm3 min−1, time = 2 h) to remove physisorbed carbon dioxide before TPD (ramp = 10 K min−1, final temperature = 1073 K). The CO2-TPD profiles were fitted with abstraction of the Shirley background making use of the Gaussian-Lorentzian function in CasaXPS 2.3.17. TPD recorded in parallel directly after the outgassing step in He to 573 K was featureless, a result suggesting that any release during TPD is due to carbon dioxide desorption. This is consistent with publications demonstrating that oxide decomposition contributions to CO2-TPD over 573–1073 K for SiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, CeO2 and MgO are negligible [30–34]. SSA was recorded in a flow of nitrogen/helium (50% v/v, flow = 30 cm3 min−1, BOC, ≥99.99%) using pure nitrogen as internal standard. Three cycles of nitrogen adsorption–desorption were employed to calculate the SSA using the standard single-point approach. SSA and CO2-TPD values were reproducible to within ±10% and we have quoted in this paper the mean values. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Scienta ESCA 300 spectrometer. Full range survey (0–1100 eV) and high-resolution spectra (over the O 1 s region) were collected using a monochromatic Al anode (Kα 1486.6 eV, 20 mA, 10 kV) and analyser pass energy of 150 eV. The C 1 s (binding energy (B.E.) = 284.5 eV) and Ce 3d uꞌꞌꞌ (B.E. = 917 eV) were used as internal standard to compensate for charging effects [8]. CasaXPS software was used for spectral curve fitting and quantification, according to relative sensitivity factors provided by Scienta."
3,Catalytic procedure,"2.2 Catalytic procedure The reactants (acetophenone (Acros Organic, 98%) and benzaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, ≥99%)), solvents (toluene (Fisher Scientific, ≥99%), anisole (Sigma-Aldrich, 99,7%), 2-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) and nitrobenzene (Fluka, ≥99%)) and products (benzylideneacetophenone (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), benzyl alcohol (Acros Organics, 99%) and benzoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%)) were used as provided by the supplier. The gases (O2, H2, N2 and He) were of ultra high purity (BOC, >99.99%). All the gas phase (498 K ≤ T ≤ 573 K) catalytic reactions were carried out under atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow fixed-bed (catalyst bed length (L bed) = 5 mm) vertical (glass) tubular reactor of internal diameter (d reactor) = 15 mm. The oxide catalyst (10–50 mg) was supported on a glass frit. A “preheating zone” based on a layer (ca. 2 cm) of borosilicate glass beads (external diameter = 1 mm) situated above the catalytic bed ensured the vaporisation of the organic reactants and that they contacted the catalyst bed at reaction temperature. The reaction temperature was maintained constant (±1 K) by (physically) mixing the catalyst with ground glass (75 µm); the catalyst bed temperature was monitored continuously using a thermocouple. A microprocessor controlled infusion pump (Model 100 kd Scientific) was employed to deliver the organic feed (pure reactants or as a 0.1–7 M solution) to the reactor at a fixed flow rate (2 × 10-2 cm3 min−1) through a glass/Teflon air-tight syringe and Teflon line. A co-current flow of acetophenone (A) + benzaldehyde (B) and N2 (P A and P B in the range 5 × 10-3 − 3 × 10-1 atm) was maintained at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 7 × 102 – 4 × 103h−1. The catalyst mass (W oxide) to reactant “i” feed ratio (W oxide/F i) spanned the range 2–10 g h mol−1. Contact time (τ = 0.2–2.1 s) was adjusted by changing the flow of nitrogen, maintaining constant the volume of catalyst bed and inlet W oxide/F i. The reactor effluent was condensed in a liquid nitrogen trap for subsequent capillary gas chromatography (GC) analysis. In blank tests, passage of acetophenone + benzaldehyde in a stream of nitrogen through the empty reactor, i.e. without the oxide catalyst, did not result in any measurable conversion. The composition of the reaction/product mixture was determined by gas chromatography with a Perkin-Elmer Auto System XL gas chromatograph unit (injector = programmed split/splitless, detector = FID, capillary column = DB-1 (50 m × 0.33 mm × 0.20 μm, J&W Scientific), software = TurboChrom Workstation 6.3.2). The overall reactant/product molar fractions (x i) were extracted using detailed calibrations (not presented). Reactant (i) conversion (X i) was obtained from: (3) X i (%) = reactant i,in - reactant i,out reactant i,in × 100 while selectivity to product “j” (S j) is calculated from: (4) S j (%) = product j,out reactant i,in - reactant i,out × 100 where the subscripts in/out denote the inlet/outlet streams. Activity is also quantified in terms of initial (r 0, molchalcone moloxide -1h−1) and stationary state production rate (r, molchalcone molMgO -1h−1), extracted from time on-stream data as explained in [35]. Raw data reproducibility and carbon mass balance were better than ±5%. The fmincon non-linear least squares algorithm in the optimisation toolbox of MatLab R2019a was employed to discriminate the various models. Applicability of the models is probed in terms of the χ2 (chi-square): (5) χ 2 = ∑ z r z - r calc , z 2 r calc , z where r z represents the experimentally determined reaction rate, while the function r calc,z denotes the calculated reaction rate obtained from kinetic modelling. The critical χ 2 was taken from the NIST table based on a degree of freedom N – P (number of data points – number of parameters) equal to 33 at a significance level α = 0.05 [36]."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation Catalyst textural properties in terms of crystallographic phase, specific surface area (SSA) and crystal size are critical as they can impact on catalyst acidity/basicity which, in turn, can modify the surface affinity for reactant(s)/product(s) influencing catalytic performance [26]. Key characteristics of the five oxide catalysts (SiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, CeO2 and MgO) considered in this study are given in Table 1 . Oxide size/shape was examined using a combination of microscopy measurements and XRD. Representative TEM/STEM (I) and SEM (II) images are shown in Figure S1 of the Supplementary Information . The TEM/STEM/SEM analyses revealed an array of crystals of varying shape and size. Large and polished “sheet-like” crystals are predominant in ZnO (b), ZrO2 (c), CeO2 (d) and MgO (e), while SiO2 (a) exhibits a “fuzz-like” morphology suggesting an amorphous structure. The crystallinity of the materials was confirmed by XRD analysis; the generated diffractograms are shown in Fig. 1 (I). A broad signal at ca. 2θ = 25 ± 10° for SiO2 (a) is consistent with amorphous cristobalite (JCPDS reference standard 101–0921), in line with microscopy analyses. The XRD pattern of ZnO (b) presents eight main peaks at 2θ = 32.1°, 34.5°, 36.5°, 47.8°, 57.2°, 63.1°, 68.5° and 69.8° due to zinc oxide (070–8070). XRD analysis of ZrO2 (c) revealed the three main peaks for t-ZrO2 ((1 0 1), (1 1 2) and (2 1 1) at 30.4°, 50.5° and 60.5°; 152–5705) and m-ZrO2 ((1 1 1), (1 1–1) and (2 2 0) at 27.8°, 31.2° and 49.6°; 101–0912), where tetragonal content = 50% (Eqs. (1) and (2) ). We could not find any published ZrO2-phase composition for commercial zirconia in the open literature, although reported publications have established a tetragonal content in the 30–70% range for laboratory synthesised ZrO2 [37,38]. The XRD patterns for CeO2 (d) and MgO (e) matched those of the JCPDS-ICDD reference card for cerium (043–1002) and magnesium oxide (087–0651). The total SSA ranged from 8 m2 g−1 (ZnO) to 176 m2 g−1 (SiO2), and the results obtained for each oxide fall within values reported in the literature for comparable systems [39,40]. Standard line broadening measurements using the Scherrer formula yields crystallite sizes in the 18–50 nm range, where the values in Table 1 are in good agreement with SSA, i.e. the oxides that exhibited the greater SSA also bore the smallest crystal sizes. Surface basicity has been shown to play a critical role in the batch liquid phase Claisen-Schmidt condensation, having an impact on adsorption/desorption of acetophenone-, benzaldehyde-derivatives and chalcones [41]. We have employed temperature programmed desorption (with CO2 as probe molecule) as a well-established measure of total surface basic site concentration and strength [42]. The available literature suggests a lower requirement (323–450 K) for CO2 desorption from weak basic sites (such as Brønsted –OH groups) compared to release from medium (e.g. terrace and edge –O2-; 450–750 K) and strong (e.g. corner –O2-; >750 K) Lewis sites [25,43]; surface oxygen basicity is dependent on –O2- electron density where CO2 adsorption in a monodentate configuration [44] is stronger with decreasing oxygen site coordination number. The CO2-TPD profiles generated for all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 (II), which includes the temperature regions proposed for oxide basic strength. The values derived from curve fitting in terms of temperature for maximum release (T max), distribution of basic sites with different strength (mol%) and associated CO2 desorbed are presented in Table 1. With the exception of SiO2 and CeO2, each catalyst presents several desorption peaks, suggesting a range of basic strength. The SiO2 (II(a)) and CeO2 catalysts ((II(d)) exhibited one desorption peak at 381 ± 16 K that can be attributed to Brønsted sites associated with surface hydroxyl (Si-OH [45] and Ce-OH [46]) groups, where T max is in good agreement with literature (T max ≤ 393 K) [47]. In support to this, absence of Lewis basic sites were also recorded by Storozheva et al. [45] and Kamimura and co-workers [47] studying the basic properties of commercial SiO2 and CeO2 by CO2/CHF3 TPD and FTIR analyses. In contrast, over the same temperature range the TPD measurement for ZnO generated the profile in II(b) dominated by CO2 desorption over the Lewis “medium region” (90%, Table 1) with T max = 653 K and 691 K. CO2 desorption peaks from ZnO at T max ≤ 698 K have been reported previously [48,49], and attributed to medium strength –O2- basic sites linked to the presence of surface defects (i.e. oxygen vacancies) generated during thermal treatment at 573 K [50]. In the profile recorded for ZrO2 (II(c)), the main desorption (74%) is observed in the Lewis “strong region” with associated T max at 824 K and 1017 K, which can be linked to CO2 desorption from low-coordinated –O2- sites [51]. The MgO catalyst (II(e)) presents three stages of CO2 desorption with T max values of ca. 400 (33%), 510 (56%) and 830 K (11%) corresponding, respectively, to Brønsted and Lewis (medium and strong) basic sites. The appearance of three CO2 desorption signals from MgO (T max at 350–423 K, 450–550 K and 850 K) has been recorded previously [25,52], and ascribed to adsorption of carbon dioxide on basic sites with increasing strength (from FTIR measurements) by Cortés-Concepción et al. [26] and León and co-workers [44]. The amount of carbon dioxide released from all the oxides (Table 1) spanned the range 9–270 μmol g−1 (from SiO2 → MgO), with values for each oxide in good agreement with those quoted in the open literature [45,47,53–55]. The basicity of the oxide catalysts was also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis over the O 1s region; the results after data fitting are presented in Figure S2 of the Supplementary Information . The XPS spectra present intensity peaks with associated binding energy (B.E.) ≥ 531.5 eV corresponding to hydroxyl group O (i.e. basic Brønsted sites) and signals at B.E. ≤ 530.7 eV characteristic of lattice –O2- (i.e. basic Lewis sites) [55–60]. The concentration of basic Brønsted/Lewis sites generated using CO2-TPD and XPS (Table 1 and Figure S2 ) are in reasonable agreement (±15%) for ZnO, ZrO2 and MgO, while both techniques are consistent with a predominance (64–100%) of hydroxyl Brønsted groups for SiO2 and CeO2. There is no clear correlation between surface basicity and SSA. The catalyst SSA alone does not control the basic character and the electronic properties of the oxide (i.e. Metaln+–O2- charge distribution) must be taken into account. The oxygen partial negative charge (|-q O|) is a crucial parameter describing the electron density of the oxygen in oxides, where a higher |-q O| reflects greater electron density, i.e. enhanced basicity [61]. The reported [62–64] |-q O|, calculated applying Sanderson’s electronegativity equalisation principle [62], increase in the order: SiO2 (0.15) < ZnO (0.20) < ZrO2 (0.34) < CeO2 (0.48) < MgO (0.50). This trend matches the recorded order from CO2-TPD (Table 1), which, in turn, can be correlated with the cation partial charge in the oxide that serves to increase the content of oxygens with low electronic stabilisation (increasing |-q O|) [65]. The characterisation measurements have probed differences in the structural and acid-base properties for the five oxide catalysts in this work, which exhibited SSA ranging from 8 (ZnO) to 176 m2 g−1 (SiO2) and variations in concentration (9–270 μmol g−1) and strength of basic sites."
6,Continuous gas phase production of chalcone via condensation of acetophenone and benzaldehyde,"3.2 Continuous gas phase production of chalcone via condensation of acetophenone and benzaldehyde 3.2.1 Evaluation of heat/mass transfer limitations A meaningful examination of catalytic performance requires process operation under intrinsic chemical control with negligible heat/mass transfer limitations. The application of plug-flow conditions guarantees a well mixed radial flow where transport gradients are minimised while reducing bypass or axial dispersion effects and avoiding reactant back mixing/channelling [66,67]. It is well established [67] that plug-flow reactor operation requirements are met where d reactor/d catalyst > 30 (200 in this work) [68] and L bed/d catalyst > 50 (vs. 67) [67]. Catalytic activity was assessed based on chalcone production rate (r) as a measure of intrinsic catalytic performance using MgO, as a representative catalyst. External heat/mass transfer limitations were examined by means of the well-known approach of changing the contact time (τ) [69]. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 2 (I), were it can be seen a linear increase in r at τ < 1 s, suggesting external heat/mass transport contributions. At τ from 1 to 2.1 s, the quasi-invariant r is diagnostic of minimal external heat/mass transport constraints. Based on this, τ was set at 1.5 s in the following catalytic runs. The linear dependence of benzaldehyde conversion with W oxide/F B (Fig. 2 (II)) excluded internal mass transfer limitations, confirming chemical control. 3.2.2 Effect of catalyst basicity Analysis of possible contributions due to catalyst basicity (from CO2-TPD) must be normalised with respect to SSA. The initial chalcone production rate (r 0) is shown as a function of specific (per m2) total basicity (ρ basicity, open symbols) in Fig. 3 . An elevated r 0 with increasing ρ basicity suggests the involvement of surface basic sites in the rate-determining step. This tendency is in line with previous studies showing enhance production rate over modified hydrotalcites [5] and MgO [25,26] with increased basicity, and attributed to a facilitated abstraction of the phenolic proton from the 2ˈ-hydroxyacetophenone intermediate [70]. We must stress that, while previous studies have shown a dependence between basicity and production of chalcone, we provide here the first report of basicity effects over a broad set of oxides in this reaction. At the same degree of conversion (X B ~ 5%), ZnO, ZrO2 and MgO promote the sole formation of target benzylideneacetophenone. In marked contrast, the generation of benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid (path (II) in Scheme 1) via (base-induced [71]) benzaldehyde disproportionation over CeO2 and SiO2, with the highest concentration of weak basic sites (100%, Table 1 and Figure S2 of the Supplementary Information ), suggests a direct contribution of weak basic sites (surface hydroxyl groups) to the Cannizzaro reaction. The same conclusion was reached by Toledo-Flores et al. [72] for the batch transformation over BaO-ZrO2 oxide. The best combined activity/selectivity response was achieved over MgO. Likewise, magnesium oxide exhibited the best performance in the liquid phase condensation of 2ˈ-hydroxyacetophenone + benzaldehyde over (ZnO-supported) BaO, K2O and Na2O [21] and acetophenone + 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using hydrotalcites [4], linked to a higher concentration of basic (O2–) sites [4]. The contribution of Brønsted/Lewis basicity to chalcone production can be evaluated from a consideration of r 0 vs. specific (per m2) Lewis basicity (solid symbols) and the results over the three catalysts that promote the sole formation of target chalcone (i.e. ZrO2, ZnO and MgO) are given in Fig. 3. The linear correlation observed confirms that chalcone formation is controlled by the Lewis basicity, where Brønsted sites do not contribute to the condensation step. Based on the results in Fig. 3, MgO was selected for subsequent tests. 3.2.3 MgO We must highlight from the outset that, under all reaction conditions, benzylideneacetophenone, an important component of environmentally benign herbicides due to its phytotoxic properties [73], was the only product in the condensation of acetophenone with benzaldehyde. A compilation of the reports in the open literature on chalcone production via Claisen-Schmidt condensation is presented Table S.1 of the Supplementary Information . 3.2.3.1 Solvent effects Having demonstrated chemical regime, the dependence between catalytic activity (r) and solvent dielectric constant, ε (i.e. a key property that quantifies the capacity of the solvent to stabilise ions in solution and it is linked to its polarity) was examined and the results are presented in Fig. 4 . A visual inspection of the graph reveals a decrease in r with increasing ε, in the order: toluene > anisole > 2-butanol > nitrobenzene. Competition between solvent and reactants for adsorption sites can affect chalcone production rate [14,16], where increase solvent surface affinity can lower condensation rate due to inhibited acetophenone/benzaldehyde activation as a result of electronic or steric effects. It has been proved by catalytic [4] and spectroscopic [70] experimental work, that adsorption of acetophenone and benzaldehyde on MgO involves surface O2– sites. The adsorption of toluene (via the aromatic ring) and anisole (through the aromatic ring and/or the methoxy oxygen) on magnesium oxide is known to occur by hydrogen bonding with surface hydroxyl groups [74,75], and does not affect acetophenone and/or benzaldehyde adsorption/activation. In contrast, adsorption of 2-butanol occurs with the –OH group attached to Mg2+–O2– pairs [76], while nitrobenzene adsorption is driven by interactions between the –NO2 functionality and Mg2+ sites [77]. This, in turn, limits the availability of basic –O2– sites for reactant(s) adsorption due to direct solvent occupation or steric hindrance. Nevertheless, reactant/solvent adsorption competition cannot be the main source of inhibited chalcone production for reaction in 2-butanol given the similar ε (17 ± 1 [66]) of the solvent, acetophenone and benzaldehyde. Reactant activation can also be influenced by “solvation” of the -C=O group by 2-butanol [78], which hinders adsorption. Toluene, with the highest production rate, was selected as the solvent for the following catalytic tests. 3.2.3.2 Chalcone production kinetics: Reaction orders, energetics and reactant adsorption The kinetics for the production of chalcone can be represented by the empirical power law equation [79], where X < 10% to ensure differential reaction conditions [80]: (6) r = k · P A m · P B n k is the rate constant, and m an n the orders of reaction with respect to the acetophenone and benzaldehyde partial pressures, respectively. The reaction orders were determined by means of logarithmic representations at constant temperature and partial pressure of benzaldehyde (equation on the left) or acetophenone (right): (7) ln ( r ) = m · ln ( P A ) + ln ( k · P B n ) ; ln ( r ) = ln ( k · P A m ) + n · ln ( P B ) Representative logarithmic plots showing the linear dependence of r with the partial pressure of acetophenone (P A, (A)) and benzaldehyde (P B, (B)) at 498 K, 523 K and 573 K are presented Fig. 5 (I); the quality of the data fit (0.980 ≤ Adj. R 2 ≤ 0.999). The computed reaction orders with respect to acetophenone (1.0 ± 0.1) and benzaldehyde (1.2 ± 0.1) were insensitive to reaction temperature. A first order dependence over a similar partial pressure range (i.e. P i ≤ 0.1 atm) has been recorded in the gas phase (T = 473 K) condensation of acetone + butyraldehyde over MgAlO [81], but we could find no documented temperature dependence of reaction orders for gas phase acetophenone + benzaldehyde condensation. Nonetheless, a first order kinetic behaviour with respect to both reactants has been demonstrated for the liquid phase condensation of acetophenone + benzaldehyde using homogenous (e.g. sodium hydroxide [82] and sulfuric acid [83]) and heterogeneous (such as anion-exchanged resin [84] and hydrotalcites [17]) catalysts. Catalytic data were subjected to Arrhenius analysis according to: (8) ln r P A m · P B n = ln ( A 0 ) - E app R · T where A 0 and E app represent the apparent pre-exponential factor and activation energy, respectively, while R is the gas constant. The associated plot (Fig. 5 (II)) yield an E app for condensation (Adj. R 2 = 0.973) of 54 kJ mol−1. A direct comparison of the E app value generated in this work with the reports in the literature is problematic given the absence of studies. Nevertheless, our E app is within the range of activation barrier values (48–69 kJ mol−1) reported over MgO for the liquid phase (2′-hydroxy)acetophenone + benzaldehyde [15] and similar (63 kJ mol−1) to results quoted for the gas phase aldol condensation of acetaldehyde + formaldehyde [85]. As part of the preliminary kinetic modelling tests, we examined the nature of the acetophenone and benzaldehyde adsorption mode (competitive or non-competitive) on MgO by evaluating the variation of r with P B where P A = 0.03 and 0.07 atm and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 5 (III). It is immediately evident that a change in acetophenone concentration did not affect the dependence of r on P B, i.e. the reaction order “n” was essentially the same and equal to ~ 1.2; quality of the data fit (0.989 ≤ Adj. R 2 ≤ 0.994). This result suggests non-competitive dual-site adsorption of benzaldehyde and acetophenone. The latter finds support in the work of Sazegar et al. [22], who reported non-competitive adsorption of acetophenone and benzaldehyde for the liquid phase transformation over protonated aluminate-silica. 3.2.3.3 Chalcone production kinetics: Kinetic model Briefly, the catalytic data generated in the previous sections suggest the following: (i) Non-competitive (dual-site, denoted S1 and S2) adsorption of acetophenone and benzaldehyde (Fig. 5 (III)). (ii) Surface basic (O2–) Lewis sites participation in the condensation to chalcone (Fig. 1 (II) and 3). (iii) Involvement of acetophenone and benzaldehyde in the rate-determining step (Fig. 5 (I)). We envision a surface mechanism (Scheme 2 and Table 2 ) based on: adsorption of acetophenone (step 1) and benzaldehyde (step 2), inter- (step 3) and intra-molecular nucleophilic attack (step 4) and water desorption (step 5). In step 1, acetophenone (A) is dissociatively adsorbed to generate an enolate (A2S1, “anchored” to a Mg2+ site (S1) via the carbonyl oxygen) and hydrogen ion ((acid) α-hydrogen extracted by surface O2– Lewis sites (S2) as HS2), as has been shown by FTIR measurements [70]. Step 2 involves the adsorption/activation of benzaldehyde (B) on HS2 (as BHS2) via the Oδ- of the carbonyl group and surface Hδ+. In support of the latter, the bands at 1423 and 1564 cm−1 for benzoate species in DRIFT spectra, characteristic of bidentate and bridge benzaldehyde adsorption on MgO [86], were not observed in the presence of acetophenone [70]. In step 3 the nucleophilic enolate (A2S1) attacks the activated H2C-C=O group in BHS2 to form a C–C bond that results in a β-hydroxy ketone (C-1HS2) and vacant S1, as previously suggested by Enchev and Mehandzhiyski [87] and Sazegar et al. [22]. The surface C-1HS2 as reactive intermediate is converted to desorbed chalcone (C) and surface –OH (adsorbed on HS2) via nucleophilic attack at the ketonic α-hydrogen by the hydroxyl oxygen in step 4. The surface hydroxyl desorbs as water [5,22] from the oxide surface (step 5) with regeneration of (S2) active site. The kinetic modelling of acetophenone + benzaldehyde was carried out using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood approach considering the five steps described above (Table 2), where one step is chosen as rate limiting and the other four are in quasi-equilibrium (see Table S.2 in Supplementary Information ) to eliminate the coverage-dependent terms. The rate expressions (Eqs. (9)-(13), Table 2) were fitted to the experimental data using non-linear regressions analysis of MatLab software (see Material and Methods section) and the results obtained are presented as a parity plot in Fig. 6 (I). The best linear fitting (Adj. R 2 = 0.980) was obtained applying Eq. (11) and is consistent with the C–C bond formation (step 3) as rate-determining. This is in line with experimental work for liquid phase operation that has shown an increase in chalcone production ascribed to a facilitated nucleophilic attack with BHS2 as substrate and A2S1 as the nucleophile [88]. Moreover, Shylesh et al. [89] identified the inter-molecular nucleophilic attack as rate-limiting in the gas-phase aldol condensation over MgAl3 hydrotalcite from H/D kinetic isotope effect studies. Eq. (11) was derived by describing the quasi-equilibrated adsorption of acetophenone (K 1), benzaldehyde (K 2) and water (K 5) and cleavage of the chalcone double C=C bond (K 4): (14) K 1 = θ A 2 S 1 θ HS 2 P A θ S 1 θ S 2 (15) K 2 = θ BHS 2 P B θ HS 2 (16) K 4 = θ C - 1 HS 2 P C θ HS 2 (17) K 5 = θ HS 2 P H 2 O θ S 2 With regards to surface site (θ) balance: (18) 1 = θ A 2 S 1 + θ S 1 (19) 1 = θ HS 2 + θ BH S 2 + θ C - 1 HS 2 + θ S 2 The goodness of the model can be assessed from the χ 2 = 0.04, far below the critical (=21) value [90]. Moreover, we show in this section that the rate/equilibrium constants obtained are meaningful and serve to explain underlying phenomena. The thermodynamic parameters can be determined assuming an Arrhenius (Eq. (8)) and Van’t Hoff (Eq. (20)) temperature dependence for kinetic (k = k 3·L) and equilibrium (K 1, K 2, K 4, K 5) constants, respectively. (20) ln K i = Δ S i 0 R - Δ H i 0 R · T The applicability of the approach is confirmed by the linear correlations between ln k/ln K and 1/T in Fig. 6 (II). The extracted kinetic (A 0 , i, E app , i) and adsorption (standard entropy (ΔS i 0) and enthalpy (ΔH i 0) of adsorption for each step i) parameters are presented in Table 3 . An adequate kinetic model must not only satisfy statistical tests (e.g. residual distribution, model suitability) but also physico-chemical constraints. The positive slopes for K 1, K 2 and K 5 are in line with the exothermic nature of the adsorption phenomenon [91], while the negative slopes for k and K 4 are consistent with the endothermic character of condensation [92] and double bond cleavage [93], respectively. The reasonable agreement (within ±13%) in terms of the apparent activation energy associated with step 3 (E app,3) obtained experimentally (Fig. 5 (II) and Eq. (8)) and by kinetic modelling, and the greater E app,3 (62 kJ mol−1) relative that of step 4 (E app,4 = 21 kJ mol−1), confirms the inter-molecular nucleophilic attack as rate-determining and is consistent with the higher energy requirement for the formation of C–C vs. C=C bond [94]. The negative ΔS i 0 is in line with the decrease in entropy post-adsorption for the Langmuir model [95,96]. In order to comply with thermodynamics, the standard entropy of a chemical in vapour phase (S i 0) must be greater than its entropy change absolute value (|ΔS i 0|) [95]. The lower |ΔS i 0| associated with the adsorption of acetophenone (35 J mol−1 K−1 in Table 3, vs. S i 0 = 373 J mol−1 K−1 [97]), benzaldehyde (67 vs. 221 J mol−1 K−1 [97]) and water (15 vs. 188 J mol−1 K−1 [97]) satisfies this requirement. Moreover, the negative ΔG thermodynamic limitation implies that a negative ΔS i 0 must be accompanied by a negative ΔH i 0. The results presented in Table 3 demonstrate that this prerequisite is always met. To the best of our knowledge, the values of adsorption enthalpies provided in this study represent the first reported thermodynamic data for acetophenone and benzaldehyde adsorption on the surface of MgO. 3.2.3.4 Catalyst lifetime High selectivity to target chalcone is crucial, however, catalyst stability is a key consideration in chemical manufacturing where overall process efficiency is controlled by both selectivity and catalyst lifetime [98]. Significant catalyst deactivation (up to 50%) in chalcone production has been a reported feature in several studies and attributed to carbon deposition [8], adsorption of reactant(s)/product(s) [12] and/or the deleterious impact of co-produced water that can induce the conversion of MgO to Mg(OH)2 [4]. Catalyst testing was extended over a prolonged (up to 672 h) time on-stream, where the results shown in Fig. 7 prove maintenance of full selectivity to target benzylideneacetophenone and condensation rate. We must stress the high chalcone generation = 138 mmol month−1 achieved, which represents a marked improvement in productivity (by up to a factor of ten) relative to reaction under similar conditions in batch systems over hydrotalcites and MgO, as the two best heterogeneous catalysts for chalcone production [8,9,15,17]."
7,Conclusions,"The gas phase condensation (P = 1 atm, T = 498–573 K; E app = 58 ± 4 kJ mol−1) of acetophenone and benzaldehyde to bezylideneacetophenone (chalcone) has been carried out in a continuous fixed bed plug flow reactor using a range of metal oxides (SiO2, ZnO, CeO2, ZrO2 and MgO). Product distribution was sensitive to specific total basicity (ρ basicity = 7 × 10−2− 466 × 10−2 μmol m−2) with formation of benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol (via Cannizzaro reaction) over SiO2 and CeO2, whereas exclusive generation of bezylideneacetophenone was observed using ZnO, ZrO2 and MgO. Chalcone production rate exhibits a positive dependence on total surface basicity (from CO2-TPD), with the greatest transformation over magnesium oxide. Under explicit catalytic control (i.e. τ = 1.5 s, W oxide/F i = 2–10 g mol-1h, d reactor/d catalyst = 200, L bed/d catalyst = 67), a first order dependence with respect to both reactants is demonstrated for reaction over MgO. The rate data obey a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type model (χ2 = 0.04 ≪ critical = 21), in which acetophenone and benzaldehyde adsorb non-competitively on the surface of MgO and the rate-limiting step is the formation of the -C–C- bond. Exclusive and time invariant (up to 28 days) benzylideneacetophenone generation via continuous gas phase acetophenone + benzaldehyde condensation over commercial MgO demonstrates the potential of this alternative route for the manufacture of valuable chalcones."
