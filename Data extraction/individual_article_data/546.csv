0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds is an important class of industrial reactions for the production of fine chemicals. In particular, many studies have been devoted to the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, because of extensive uses of the latter in cosmetics, perfumery, dyestuff and pharmaceutical industries, as the second most important aromatic molecule after vanillin [2–4]. Various oxidizing reagents, such as permanganate and dichromate, are currently employed for the benzaldehyde manufacture processes, although high cost and co-generation of toxic wastes raise severe environmental and economical concerns [5]. Accordingly, Green Chemistry guidelines recommend the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with oxygen as the most advantageous option for the benzaldehyde manufacture [6]. In this respect, although supported noble-metal catalysts (e.g. Au, Pt, Pd) exhibit good performance under mild reaction conditions [7–15], high costs and deactivation phenomena, due to over-oxidation and/or fouling of active sites, are severe drawbacks for their industrial exploitation [16,17]. On the other hand, recent literature data on transition metal-oxide catalysts document high activity and selectivity of bare and promoted MnOx systems in the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in a wide range of temperature [18–25]. However, activity loss and the need of regeneration-rejuvenation procedures are generally reported also for such catalysts [6,26–31]. The latter even shows deactivation phenomena related to the over-oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid [32] but the intimate aspects concerning both the formation of benzoic acid and its role in poisoning the catalyst still deserve investigation. Recent synergistic approaches involving experimental investigations and quantum chemistry calculations, mostly based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), showed to be important in highlighting the fundamental aspects of catalytic reactions enabling the development of effective catalysts and processes [33]. In particular, catalysis performed by clusters involving precise numbers of atoms is a new research area in which the experimental-computational strategy has shown very promising perspectives [33–39]. In fact, the multifaceted panorama of the cluster structures and properties was investigated to design new catalysts whose characteristics could be tuned either changing the elemental nature, sizes and shapes of the clusters or dispersing them on supports having peculiarly addressed features [40–46]. This paper presents a systematic computational study, in the frame of the DFT paradigm, aimed at shedding light on the catalytic mechanisms, even including catalyst deactivation phenomena, which occur in the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde on MnOx cluster-sized catalysts [32,47]. In particular, the role of possible over-oxidizing species, which could potentially lead to the formation of benzoic acid, is investigated. Namely, the role of the oxygen species produced on (or displaced from the bulk to) the catalyst surface, of the O 2 (coming from the gas phase) and of the water molecules (formed during the reaction) was taken into consideration and analyzed. This was done in the hypothesis that benzoic acid or other oxidized intermediates could play a role in the deactivation of the catalyst [32,47]. The identification of these surface intermediates and especially of the paths determining their genesis could indeed suggest some corrections to be made into the process in order to improve the selectivity to benzaldehyde."
1,Computational details,"The Gaussian 09 package [48] was employed for all the calculations. These were performed in the DFT framework by using the M06-L exchange-correlation functional [49], which showed to be valid in treating inorganic compounds that involve transition metals also when dispersion interactions were relevant. Its reliability for the calculation of barrier heights is demonstrated in previous works for a large number of chemical reactions [50–52] and its accuracy can be quantified by an averaged mean unsigned error of ca. 10 kJ mol − 1 . The Stuttgart ’97 Relativistic Small Core effective potential along with its valence double zeta basis set [53,54] was used for the Mn atoms whereas the cc-pVDZ basis set was employed for lighter elements. Minima and transition states related to the reaction mechanisms, thoroughly discussed in terms of vibrational zero-point (ZPVE) corrected energies, were characterized by inspection of the harmonic vibrational frequencies. Interaction energies, namely adsorption ( Δ E ads ) and desorption ( Δ E des ) energies, were evaluated as the difference between the energy of the adsorbed system and the energies of its constituents. For the interaction energies, basis set superposition error (BSSE) estimated by means of counterpoise procedure [55] is reported. In case of desorption steps, the associated Gibbs free energy ( Δ G des ) is also given, to get an idea of the expectedly significant role of entropy changes in these events. A kinetic analysis of the catalytic processes was performed following an original approach derived by the classic one of Christiansen [56] and detailed in the Data in Brief (DiB) journal [1]. This method was applied, using ZPVE corrected energies, to compare both the different pathways determining the single reaction mechanisms and the latter ones among themselves [57]. The mutual influence between the various mechanisms studied was conversely not taken into consideration because unimportant with respect of the following discussion and conclusions."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Catalytic fragments and starting benzyl alcohol adsorption modes,"3.1 Catalytic fragments and starting benzyl alcohol adsorption modes Previous mechanistic results reported by Gueci et al. [32] are summarized in the catalytic cycle of Fig. 1. This, in particular, shows the catalytic benzaldehyde oxidation mechanism already proposed after having examined all the possible ways of interaction of the considered molecular substrates with all the plausible adsorption sites present in the different catalytic fragments ( Mn 4 O 7 , Mn 4 O 8 , Mn 4 O 9 ) involved [32]. The catalytic cycle presents a starting Mn 4 O 8 catalytic model cluster — representative of the Mn(IV) sites characterizing the cluster-sized MnOx fragments present on the surface of real catalysts [6] — that, undergoing transient structural modifications, rules benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, following a complex reaction mechanism. Two benzyl alcohol molecules are transformed into two benzaldehyde and two H 2 O molecules, in aerobic conditions. The Gibbs free energy difference for this process was calculated to be − 181.4 kJ mol − 1 . It has to be noticed that, in order to close the catalytic cycle hence to restore the pristine catalyst, gas-phase O 2 is involved and one Mn 4 O 9 fragment is produced along the process. Notably, these fragments may originate either by adsorption of O 2 (from the gas phase) on the pre-reduced cluster (i.e. Mn 4 O 7 ) or by bulk O-atoms diffusion to the surface and/or by surface diffusion of the latter (i.e. spillover). In fact, several studies performed on MnOx catalysts actually revealed a certain degree of mobility of surface oxygen species [25,58–60]. In support of this hypothesis, Oxygen Temperature Programmed Desorption (O2-TPD) analysis performed both on pristine and promoted MnOx catalysts showed patterns characterized by overwhelming exposures of Mn(IV) active sites [6,32]. To probe the effects of this phenomenon into the title reaction, hence to investigate the catalytic behavior of a locally over-oxygenated cluster showing a supposed Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) like mechanism [61], another Mn 4 O 9 fragment, aside the complementary one [62] already considered in the second step of the cycle of Fig. 1, was additionally taken into consideration in this study. Its optimized geometry, with the most stable spin multiplicity characterizing the same fragment ( 2 S + 1 = 11 ), is reported in Fig. 2 , where the atom labels that will be used in the following are also shown in the left panel [63]. In the right, conversely, an alternative view allows one to distinguish two catalyst halves, arbitrarily labeled top ( t ) and down ( d ), with respect to the plane crossing the manganese atoms. Benzyl alcohol adsorption on the Mn 4 O 9 fragment, provided that it actually involves the Mn(D) atom bearing the extra oxygen, may occur either on the side where the O1 and O3 sites are facing upward or on the other side, leading to Mn(D) t and Mn(D) d adducts, respectively (see Fig. 3 ). In both cases the benzyl alcohol molecule interacts with the catalyst by its oxygen atom, moreover, in the Mn(D) d adsorption geometry an interaction between the phenyl fragment and the Mn(A) site is also observed. According to these findings, the Mn(D) d adsorption system looks to be more stable than the Mn(D) t one, being the corresponding interaction energies − 165.4 kJ mol − 1 (BSSE = 19.4 kJ mol − 1 ) and − 135.5 kJ mol − 1 (BSSE = 28.1 kJ mol − 1 ), respectively. The geometrical characteristics and the structural parameters for the two adsorption modes are summarized in Table 1 . The main differences essentially rely in the ability of the organic molecule to approach the manganese site, for the most part concerning the interaction distance of the Mn(D) site with the oxygen atom and the aromatic ring of benzyl alcohol, Mn(D)-O and Mn ( D ) − C 6 H 5 , respectively, and the consequent variation of the dihedral angle Θ (O-C-C-C), involving the interacting oxygen and the unsaturated plus a couple of aromatic carbon atoms of the reacting catalytic substrate. The parameter values in Table 1 indicate that the stabilization of the system originates from a stronger interaction of the cluster with the aromatic ring. It has also to be mentioned that the benzyl alcohol adsorption increased the system spin multiplicity from 11 to 13, irrespective of the considered geometry. The investigated mechanism reported throughout essentially occurs on the 2 S + 1 = 13 spin multiplicity surface. In fact, decreasing/increasing of spin multiplicity, occurring as a result of spin coupling/uncoupling, was found along the reaction path, commonly for species where hydrogen atoms are transferred from the adsorbate to the cluster. The spin multiplicity of the species are always reported along with energetic informations in the corresponding figures. In all cases, an average spin contamination of ca. 2 % was found, with maximum values of 6.3 % , 2.9 % and 3.3 % , among the species with 2 S + 1 = 11 , 13 and 15 in the order. In the next section the selective oxidation mechanisms of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde on the Mn 4 O 9 cluster are detailed. The mechanisms will be labeled as the adsorption geometries from which they start, i.e. Mn(D) d and Mn(D) t . The mechanistic findings, of course, have to be related with the ones already obtained in the oxidation of the second benzyl alcohol molecule ( Δ E ads = − 190.0 kJ mol − 1 , BSSE = 22.5 kJ mol − 1 , 2 S + 1 = 11 ) on a Mn 4 O 9 fragment, involved in the cycle of Fig. 1."
4,Benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde,"3.2 Benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde The first step in the Mn(D) d reaction pathway is the hydroxyl hydrogen transfer to the Od ′ site, overcoming an energy barrier of 69.8 kJ mol − 1 (Fig. 4 ). From this point, the reaction can proceed following three different ways: i) the second hydrogen atom is transferred to the O3 site with an energy barrier of 96.3 kJ mol − 1 and a ( H + H ) / Mn 4 O 9 − C 6 H 5 -CHO system, in a spin multiplicity state of 15, is formed, ii) the adsorbed molecule rotates so that one hydrogen of the CH 2 moiety points towards the Od ′ ′ site, requiring 4.7 kJ mol − 1 of energy, iii) the hydrogen bonded to the Mn 4 O 9 cluster flips downward. In the first case an over-hydrogenated catalyst with an extra oxygen atom would be obtained after benzaldehyde desorption. The hydrogen hopping in the direction of one of the extra oxygen on the Mn 4 O 9 fragment would lead to a water molecule, whose desorption could restore the Mn 4 O 8 fragment; however this resulted energetically almost impossible. On the contrary, the involvement of an adsorbed O 2 from the gas phase (even after the desorption of water) would lead to an unlikely hyper-oxygenated Mn 4 O 10 fragment. Given this and realizing that the energy barriers of the other two reaction paths, having common origin, are much lower, this reaction way was not further investigated. The second reaction path continues with the CH 2 hydrogen being transferred to the Od ′ site, overcoming a high energy barrier of 150.7 kJ mol − 1 . The so formed system exhibit a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of benzaldehyde and the closest H of a kind of hydrogen peroxide species adsorbed on the Mn(D) site. Also in this case the same considerations apply as regards the elimination of water through the adsorption of one O 2 molecule while it is still difficult to restore the Mn 4 O 8 fragment through the formation of H 2 O after the eventual transformation of the H 2 O 2 -like moiety. The third reaction path (following the green arrows in Fig. 4), with an energy barrier of 15.8 kJ mol − 1 , might be the favored one among the three investigated. Following this step, once the hydrogen bonded to the vicinal Od ′ oxygen atom of the the fragment catalysts points downward, one hydrogen of the − CH 2 moiety could be subjected to intramolecular migration to the oxygen atom or, alternatively, could be transferred either to Od ′ or Od ′ ′ . Since the intramolecular shift shows an energy barrier value equal to 181.4 kJ mol − 1 , the evolution of the mechanism through this pathway was considered as improbable. The rotation of the dehydrogenated alcohol so that the hydrogen of the CH 2 moiety points towards Od ′ ′ leads to a species that has a slightly higher energy (4.2 kJ mol − 1 ) but the following step, i.e. the hydrogen transfer to the catalyst, needs the overcoming of a prohibitive energy barrier, that is 182.1 kJ mol − 1 . It is interesting to note that also in this case a species resembling a hydrogen peroxide molecule has formed. The last reaction path considered involves 40.6 kJ mol − 1 for the rotation of the dehydrogenated alcohol, causing the CH 2 hydrogen pointing towards the Od ′ site. This is a pretty high value for a torsional energy, probably originated because the favorable interaction between the phenyl group and the catalyst fragment is missing in the final structure. When the second hydrogen atom of the alcohol is transferred to the already protonated Od ′ site with an energy barrier of 78.2 kJ mol − 1 , the system ( C 6 H 5 − CHO + H 2 O ) / Mn 4 O 8 is formed. The latter then evolves in the three isolated components, needing an energy of 79.7 kJ mol − 1 (BSSE = 44.6 kJ mol − 1 ), being the Δ G des value equal to 12.1 kJ mol − 1 . Fig. 5 details the reaction mechanism occurring on the Mn(D) t site. As found in case of the Mn(D) d adsorption geometry discussed above, it begins with the hydroxyl hydrogen transfer to the Od ′ site, overcoming, this time, an energy barrier of 91.1 kJ mol − 1 . The subsequent hydrogen loss occurs in favor of the closest O2, with an energy barrier of 22.9 kJ mol − 1 . Thus, a system consisting of one benzaldehyde molecule adsorbed on a hydrogenated Mn 4 O 9 catalytic fragment, in a spin state of 15, is obtained. Although this fragment is easily formed, the distance of hydrogen atoms hinders an easy formation of one water molecule (to be desorbed). Given this and considering that the only alternative mechanism would involve an O 2 molecule producing water and the already discarded, because unlikely, hyper-oxygenated Mn 4 O 10 fragment, further investigation neither have been carried out on the product of this parasitic mechanism nor alternative mechanism on the Mn(D) t site have been taken into consideration. As a consequence, the already selected green pathway of the Mn(D) d site has been identified as the one occurring in the benzyl alcohol oxidation on the Mn 4 O 9 cluster considered here."
5,Energetics of the reaction occurring on Mn 4 O 8 and Mn 4 O 9 clusters,"3.3 Energetics of the reaction occurring on Mn 4 O 8 and Mn 4 O 9 clusters It is worth to compare the proposed mechanism with that previously suggested for the same reaction occurring on a model Mn 4 O 8 cluster, which could be assumed as the precursor of the Mn 4 O 9 one. For this purpose, an analysis based on the Christiansen’s method of the intermediate quasi-stationary concentrations, was employed [56]. The matrix approach, which lies at its base, allows one to determine the rate of a reaction from the knowledge of the probability of occurrence (per unit of time) of the single elementary steps that compose the same reaction. These probabilities can be related to the theoretically calculated energy barriers, using the Eyring’s equation [64–67]. Details on the simplified form of the Christiansen’s method here used, hereafter identified as SCM, are given elsewhere [1]. It should be here underlined however that by means of SCM it is possible to compare either the different probability of occurrence characterizing the pathways which contribute to determining a given reaction stoichiometry or also different reactions in order to establish the most probable among these. Referring to the title reaction, it can be said that either TOF evaluated at 343 K or the activation energy of the whole reaction, evaluated by an Arrhenius plot in the temperature range in-between 333 and 363 K, both calculated by the M1 SCM reaction rates (see Table 2 ), are in well agreement with the corresponding descriptors experimentally obtained at the same temperatures for the real MnO 2 catalysts [1,6,47]. In particular, either the experimental or the calculated TOF/ s − 1 values resulted equal to 4 · 10 − 4 . Moreover, using SCM, and setting the temperature at 343 K it is possible to observe that the mechanism marked by green arrows is the most heuristic, among those ending with the formation of benzaldehyde in Fig. 4, due to the intrinsic difficulty to interconvert the H 2 O 2 -like moieties into the H 2 O ones. Conversely, as demonstrated by the SCM pathway rate values, reported in Table 2, the mechanism leading to the formation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol on the Mn 4 O 8 fragment of Fig. 1 is apparently more facile than that which occurs on the Mn 4 O 9 fragment shown in the same figure. The latter should occur also more laboriously than the ones taking place on the Mn 4 O 9 fragment of Fig. 4. SCM however suggests that the Mn 4 O 9 fragment of Fig. 1 is, in fact, more active than the Mn 4 O 8 one up to the aldehyde desorption step [1]. Conversely, the relative desorption energy, Δ E des , calculated for the two processes occurring on Mn 4 O 9 and Mn 4 O 8 , 231.7 and 110.8 kJ mol − 1 in the order, proved that the desorption step is more difficult in the former than in the latter and overall suggests that the aldehyde formed on Mn 4 O 9 could remain stuck on this fragment. Just to make a qualitative comparison, the probability per unit of time of benzaldehyde desorption at 343 K from the Mn 4 O 8 fragment compared to that which occurs from the Mn 4 O 9 fragment is ca. 3 · 10 18 times larger. This SCM result is close in agreement with experimental evidences already suggesting that the reaction kinetics were controlled by adsorption–desorption processes [47]. In any case, the process of Fig. 4 should be irrelevant with respect to those of Fig. 1 with regard to the selective production of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol. While, that of Fig. 5 should occur as a parallel/parasitic pathway more easily (M5 pathway mechanism of Table 2) but leaving a di-hydrogenated Mn 4 O 9 fragment difficult to be reconverted in the starting Mn 4 O 8 one [1]. Considering that the Mn 4 O 9 fragments could originate by intra-structural migration of reticular oxygens (or by surface spillover as in the case of MnO x dispersed in other metal-oxides, e.g. MnCeOx catalysts [68,69]), it can be concluded that strong sticking of benzaldehyde on MnOx fragments could also occur in the presence of MvK mechanisms. Due to the oxygen diffusion, a given MvK mechanism has to be associated with an occurrence probability, function of the temperature, which must be taken into account. Therefore, it is possible to infer that at lower temperatures the Mn 4 O 8 cluster should be the one mainly involved in the beginning reaction mechanism. As the temperature rises, conversely, the catalytic system, reaching the energy at which the oxygen diffusion process is triggered, should evolve (also in the initial phases of the reaction) through the steps occurring on the Mn 4 O 9 fragment of Fig. 1, with a relative change in the benzaldehyde production rate caused by the higher benzaldehyde desorption energy involved on these over-oxygenated fragment."
6,Benzoic acid formation,"3.4 Benzoic acid formation Previous mechanistic studies indicated that the incipient formation of benzoic acid is at the origin of the progressive activity loss of MnOx catalysts during the selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde [47]. This prompted us to focus on the consecutive oxidation of benzaldehyde on the Mn 4 O 8 cluster to get insights into the factors triggering the over-oxidation process leading to the formation of benzoic acid. It is known that the hydrated form of benzaldehyde, namely gem-diol, can undergo further oxidation. Taking into consideration this and the findings of the preceding section, the final arrangement of benzaldehyde and water very strongly co-adsorbed on the Mn(A) site of the Mn 4 O 8 cluster, produced in the second benzyl alcohol oxidation step [32] of Fig. 1, was identified as the probable starting point for the benzoic acid formation, eventually through the intermediate evolution of formed gem-diol. Fig. 6 shows the proposed mechanism in details. The first step involves the shift of one hydrogen atom of the water molecule to the catalytic fragment, with an energy barrier of 63.4 kJ mol − 1 , and then the successive migration of the OH group on the carbonyl carbon of benzaldehyde, overcoming an energy barrier of 74.5 kJ mol − 1 . At this point, a comb of different alternative possibilities could be identified: a) the hydrogen atom bonded to the carbonyl is transferred to the O2 site already involved in the previous step. Although benzoic acid formation occurs, with an energy barrier of 118.9 kJ mol − 1 , the residual hydrogenated cluster would suffer a strong distortion, hardly admissible in a real catalytic fragment; b) after an internal rearrangement for which ca. 22 kJ mol − 1 are required, the hydrogen atom bonded to the carbonyl is transferred either to the second O2 oxygen or to the O3 site of the C 2 h Mn 4 O 8 cluster, overcoming energy barriers of 45.3 kJ mol − 1 and 48.8 kJ mol − 1 , respectively. The formation of a benzoic acid molecule leaves a ( H + H ) / Mn 4 O 8 system that can restore the pristine Mn 4 O 8 fragment by reaction with gas phase O 2 , similarly to what happens in the alcohol to aldehyde oxidation mechanism (see Fig. 1). The acid Δ E des was calculated to be 181.8 kJ mol − 1 (BSSE = 38.5 kJ mol − 1 ), being Δ G des = 130.7 kJ mol − 1 . This high value is in agreement with the experimental results, showing trace amounts of acid adsorbed on the catalyst [47]; c) The hydrogen atom on the catalyst rotates freely, from below to above the plane, then, overcoming an energy barrier of 40.4 kJ mol − 1 , it migrates to the carbonyl oxygen of the oxydrilated benzaldehyde, ϕ C ( OH ) HO , with the formation of a η 2 gem-diol/manganese system, i.e. with both oxygen atoms of the gem-diol bonded to the same manganese atom and the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms on the same side. The latter afterwards evolves spontaneously into a more stable gem-diol, with a single oxygen atom bonded to manganese and the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms placed on opposite sides. This species yields the hydrogen atom bonded to quaternary carbon to the catalyst, with a barrier of 111.7 kJ mol − 1 , and the protonated carboxylic acid thus formed subsequently releases the proton in a non-activated process. Benzoic acid and the ( H + H ) / Mn 4 O 8 system are eventually obtained. Although the transformation of benzaldehyde into benzoic acid could be induced by the gem-diol intermediate, it can be assumed that the gem-diol does not evolve into acid since the process is limited by the above energy barrier (111.7 kJ mol − 1 ). Therefore, benzaldehyde oxidizes directly into acid after path b), in particular, following the branch in which the largest energy barrier, aside the one originating the ϕ C(OH)HO formation (common to all the paths), is ca. 49 kJ mol − 1 . This inference is confirmed applying SCM to the different paths (see Table 2), ending in the same stoichiometric process reported in Fig. 6. In particular, SCM shows that the chosen mechanism is characterized by a whole reaction rate which is, at 343 K , ca. 40 times larger than that of the other one and this mainly depends on the higher desorption energy characterizing the mechanism of the latter. Indeed, SCM also shows that the more numerous surface steps of the gem-diol pathway are sometimes less favored with respect to those of the other two pathways but that the production of benzoic acid via the gem-diol intermediate is on the whole comparable to that of the faster of the two. This because the whole processes should be mainly ruled by the acid desorption energies. Finally, using once again SCM to juxtapose the two reactions involved in the whole oxidation mechanisms, namely alcohol → aldehyde and aldehyde → acid processes, it can be observed, referring to the corresponding fastest pathways, that the former, when the same concentrations of initial reactant surface species are considered, would be favored. In fact, the ratio of the corresponding reaction rate values, mostly determined by the desorption steps of the involved products [1], is equal to ca. 7 · 10 10 , at 343 K (see Table 2). These findings that underline that the rate of the surface steps of the different oxidation processes are not particularly influent on the whole reaction rates, would seem to confirm the benzoic acid poisoning role [47] in the selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to aldehyde on MnOx based catalysts."
7,How to use the computational findings in practice,"3.5 How to use the computational findings in practice According to the above findings, the co-presence of benzaldehyde and water on the catalyst is the potential cause of benzoic acid formation, leading to catalyst deactivation. In fact, the adsorbed water plays a crucial role in the reduction of selectivity to benzaldehyde, due to the transfer of one hydroxyl group from a water to a benzaldehyde molecule. Therefore, it is admissible to hypothesize that dehydrating the system during the reaction or, as a preventive strategy, avoiding the formation of water on the cluster, in the presence of benzaldehyde, could represent a way to limit the acidic by-product formation. Water formation occurs in two stages of the presented benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde oxidation mechanism: i) when the O 2 adsorbs on the di-hydrogenated catalytic fragment, ( H + H ) / Mn 4 O 8 , transforming it into the intermediate Mn 4 O 9 species and ii) when one alcohol molecule is oxidized by the different Mn 4 O 9 fragments (see Figs. 1 and 4). Formation of water hence would seem to be related either to the presence of gas phase oxygen or to the occurrence of MvK mechanisms. Nevertheless, for the benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde oxidation on the Mn 4 O 8 cluster (first step of Fig. 1) not oxygen intervention would seem to be required, being O 2 conversely necessary, as underlined above, just to eliminate the hydrogen atoms on the same Mn 4 O 8 fragment after the first alcohol molecule oxidation. Hence, either to decrease benzoic acid formation or, at least, to test the network of mechanisms suggested here, it could be possible to carry out the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol just on the pristine ( Mn 4 O 8 ) fragments. For this, it could be appropriate to lower the temperature, hence to reduce either intra-structural oxygen or spillover surface migrations, and to co-feed the system, in sequence and cyclically, by benzyl alcohol, O 2 and finally CO (see Table 2). The MnOx based catalysts are indeed also active in the oxidation of carbon monoxide [68,69]. This sequential procedure starting with ϕ CH 2 OH and characterized by the following stoichiometric processes: (1) ϕ CH 2 OH + Mn 4 O 8 → ( H + H ) / Mn 4 O 8 + ϕ CHO (2) ( H + H ) / Mn 4 O 8 + O 2 → Mn 4 O 9 + H 2 O (3) Mn 4 O 9 + CO → Mn 4 O 8 + CO 2 could help, as shown by the SCM analysis on steps 2 and 3, see M2 and M9 in Table 2, (by step 2) to eliminate, forming H 2 O , the hydrogen present on the stoichiometric ( Mn 4 O 8 ) fragments and (by step 3) to reduce, forming CO 2 , the over-oxygenated ( Mn 4 O 9 ) derivatives, shaped in the preceding step, before another alcohol molecule would undergo oxidation again on Mn 4 O 8 . In this way the apparent catalytic cycle summarized below: ϕ CH 2 OH + CO + O 2 → [ Mn 4 O 8 ] ϕ CHO + H 2 O + CO 2 would be closed. It can finally be observed that this reaction design would also limit parasitic poisoning processes on Mn 4 O 9 fragments, potentially able to deactivate the Mn 4 O 8 catalyst. In particular, the oxidation processes of the benzyl alcohol occurring on Mn 4 O 9 , such as the one, represented in Fig. 1, that is characterized by the almost irreversible sticking of benzaldehyde able to initiate, in presence of water, the benzoic acid formation or the other, represented in Fig. 5, which is indeed the fastest oxidation process (see M5 rate value in Table 2) that however leaves the Mn 4 O 9 fragment in a di-hydrogenated form, from which, as already stated, it is difficult to recover the initial catalytic conditions."
8,Conclusions,"A DFT analysis of the benzyl alcohol oxidation on MnOx clusters has been performed. In addition to one stoichiometric ( Mn 4 O 8 ) cluster, over-oxygenated ( Mn 4 O 9 ) derivatives, originated by both O 2 and/or intra-structural and/or surface spillover oxygenation (MvK mechanism) were considered. Having explored a wide panorama of possibilities, all the reactions paths have been compared and it was thus possible to select the most likely mechanism for the benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. The parallel benzaldehyde to benzoic acid oxidation has been also addressed in order to find a way to increase the selectivity of the MnOx based catalysts and to state its, already hypothesized, poisoning role. The atomistic understanding of the mechanism concerning the benzoic acid formation has allowed us to outline some strategies for experimental work, referred to the title reaction. These are addressed: i) to validate the already proposed experimental mechanism; ii) to test the here proposed reaction network; iii) to improve, if the proposed mechanism shows eventually to be valid, the selectivity of the benzyl alcohol oxidation process over MnOx derived catalysts."
