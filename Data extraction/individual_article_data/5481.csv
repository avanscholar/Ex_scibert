0,Introduction,"The unique properties and the modern repertoire of organic transformations in synthetic chemistry have enabled the use of fluorine as a standard strategy to develop new drugs, in particular, pharmaceuticals that target the central nervous system (CNS) [1,2]. A single substitution with fluorine can induce a drastic change in the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) parameters but does not interfere with or may even enhance the intrinsic efficacy [3]. Fluorine has been successfully exploited to alter bioavailability, lipophilicity, metabolic stability, acidity/basicity and toxicity [3]. Since the 1950s, over 150 fluorine-containing drugs have been released to the market, which now makes up approximately 20% of all pharmaceuticals (and approximately 30% of all fluorinated agrochemicals) [4]. Approximately 50% of fluorinated drugs contain fluorine in an aromatic system and 20% in an aliphatic chain, and the rest contain fluorine in various functional groups (e.g., CF3, SCH2F, and OCF3) [3]. The embedded fluorine atom in drug-like molecules allows for convenient radiolabelling with 18F for positron emission tomography [5–7]. In addition to its impact on medicinal chemistry, the effects of fluorine on intermolecular interactions have enabled the development of advanced materials, such as Teflon®, Gore-Tex®, and fluorosurfactants. Hence, a thorough understanding of the effects of fluorine is required for its rational use in drug design and will also lead to an improvement in studies using computational methods [7,8]. The intermolecular interactions in ligand-protein complexes can be finely tuned by fluorine or fluorine-containing substituents [3,9]. Although substantial attention has been paid to the molecular basis of observable macroscopic parameters, such as logP, logD or pKa changes and conformational preference [3], many effects at the atomic resolution level, such as the influence of fluorination on the hydrogen and halogen bonding (HB and XB, respectively), are hardy represented in the literature [10–12]. HBs are one of the most important interactions responsible for ligand-target complex stabilization [13]. The formation of HBs can be studied by various experimental methods, such as thermochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic analyses. In vibrational spectroscopy (FT-IR and Raman), the presence and strength of hydrogen bonds, among others, can be measured by analysing the band shifts related to the vibrations of the groups involved in HB formation: a shift towards lower wavenumbers (down-shift) indicates an increase in the HB strength, while a shift towards higher wavenumbers (up-shift) indicates the weakening/disappearance of HBs [14,15]. Additionally, a change in the intensity of these bands can be observed. Aniline, due to its fairly simple infrared spectrum and occurrence of overtones, was often used in spectroscopic and structural studies of the formation of hydrogen bonds [16–22]. It also should be noted, that numerous studies on the direct effect of fluorine substitution on the strength of HBs and also the ability of fluorine to act as HB acceptor were performed [23]. For instance, Bogdan et al. [24] provided a methodology to either increase or decrease the HB-donating capacity of benzylic alcohols by judicious fluorination. Additionally, it was shown that intramolecular O–H···F interactions and secondary C–H···F and/or C–H···O interactions contributed to the stabilization of the various conformations of the analysed structures [24]. An attempt to understand the role of organic fluorine in hydrogen bond network, by comparing fluoro-ethanol vs. ethanol, has recently been published by Biswas et al. [25]. Based on classical molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations they showed that apart from intermolecular O–H···O HBs, a number of O–H···F and C–H···F interactions form the HB network. However, focusing only on the direct participation of fluorine in HB formation, its indirect influence on the hydroxyl group has not been analysed. The fluorine effect in supramolecular chemistry was investigated by Li et al.[26] and Zhao et al. [27]. They demonstrated that intramolecular N–H···F HBs (iHB) can be easily used to stabilize the binding conformation of monomers for self-assembly. Also, in larger molecular system (various bases and template–primer complexes) the hydrogen bonds with fluorine and its effect on the affinity and forming pairs of DNA polymerase were examined. The fluorine substitution caused deterioration of the affinity of polymerase and decreasing of the calculated HB strength [28]. However, all of the abovementioned studies deal with hydrogen bonds formed directly by fluorine and suggest that fluorine in organic compounds is a very weak acceptor of HBs (despite the highest electronegativity), and often, fluorine can be described as a donor’s last resort [8,13,23,29,30]. Wojciechowski et al. [16,31,32], who had extensively theoretically studied monofluoro derivatives of aniline, attributed all the observed effects and shifts of respective bands to electrostatic changes caused by fluorine substitution, regardless of the rearrangement of intermolecular interactions in the analysed systems. This paper can be considered an extension of the studies by Wojciechowski's group on aniline and its fluoro-derivatives, but unlike previous work based on crystal structure analysis and extended quantum-mechanical calculations, we present broad, theoretical, structural, and spectroscopic studies on the indirect and direct influence of the fluorine substituent position on the geometrical preferences and incidence rate of hydrogen bond formation."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Aniline and its 2-, 3-, and 4-F derivatives, with purities of approximately 98%, were purchased from Combi-Blocks (USA). All compounds were in liquid form where the aniline was colorless and the fluoroanilines had a slight yellow color. The boiling point was: 184 °C, 171–173 °C, 186 °C, 187 °C for aniline, 2F-, 3F-, 4F-aniline, respectively."
3,Spectroscopic measurements,"2.2 Spectroscopic measurements The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were measured using an FT-IR Nicolet™ iS™5 Thermo Scientific system, and a single reflection zinc selenide prism (ZnSe) was used to acquire the spectra of the samples with the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method at room temperature. The FT-IR spectra of the samples were collected in the range of 4000–650 cm−1; 32 scans were taken with a resolution of 2 cm−1. The Raman spectra were measured by employing a Bruker MultiRAM FTRaman spectrometer. The Raman spectra of the samples were collected using a macro TLC xyz stage in the range of 4000–50 cm−1, and data were collected with a resolution of 4 cm−1, an excitation wavelength of 1064 nm, a laser power of 350 mW and an accumulation of 100 scans. The baseline of all the recorded spectra was subtracted by the asymmetric least squares smoothing method from the Origin software [33]."
4,Electrostatic potential surface calculations,"2.3 Electrostatic potential surface calculations The electrostatic surface potential (ESP) was calculated using Gaussian G16 [34] with Minnesota functional M06-2X-D3 [35,36] and Dunning basis set aug-cc-pVTZ. The results were visualized in GaussView 6.0.16 [37]."
5,Vibrational analysis,"2.4 Vibrational analysis Vibration analysis was performed for one frame selected from the AIMD trajectory. Next, the system was optimized using the B3LYP-D3 functional and cc-pVDZ basis set. The IR and Raman (excitation wavelength of 1064 nm) theoretical spectra were calculated using B3LYP-D3/cc-pVDZ. The theoretical spectra were multiplied by a scale factor of 0.97 [38] and were then compared with the experimental IR and Raman spectra to support the assignment of the bands."
6,QTAIM,"2.5 QTAIM For aniline and its crystallized derivatives, the electron density topological analysis was carried out with the AIMAll programme [39],which was based on the electron density calculated with Gaussian G16 at the B3LYP [40] /cc-pVDZ [41,42] level of theory. The energy of the non-covalent bonds detected in the crystal structures was calculated with the Espinosa equation: E int = 1 2 v ( r ) where Eint is the energy of the interatomic interaction (a.u.), and v(r) is the kinetic energy at the bond critical point (BCP). The Espinosa equation is valid for all types of HBs, van der Waals interactions and weak interactions such as H⋯H and C–H⋯O interactions [43]."
7,Ab initio molecular dynamics,"2.6 Ab initio molecular dynamics The 20 ps-long (with a step size of 0.5 fs) ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed for aniline, 2F-aniline, 3F-aniline, and 4F-aniline. Each system contained 16 molecules and was closed in a box with 15 × 15 × 15 Å3 dimensions. The initial geometries were prepared using Packmol [44] software. The production simulations were performed using the CP2K [45] software package with the Quickstep [46,47] method. The dynamics of the systems were calculated using DFTD3 [48], which uses the empirical Grimm dispersion additive [36]. To reliably describe the kinetic and electrostatic properties of the molecules, the Padé function was used [49]. The first relaxation step was followed by performing molecular dynamics calculations at 298 K. Then, based on the calculated Wannier centres, theoretical infrared spectra were obtained using the Travis software [50]."
8,AIMD trajectory analysis and visualization,"2.7 AIMD trajectory analysis and visualization The in-house Python script was used to analyse the obtained trajectories and determine the number and types of HBs (various donors and acceptors of HBs) that formed during the simulations. Based on the obtained data, the density maps showing the distribution of the HB (or contact) geometric parameters (the range of distance was from 2.5 Å to 4 Å, and the range of angles was from 90° to 180°) were generated using the R [51] environment and the following libraries: RColorBrew [52], Hexbin [53], Rbokeh [54], ggplot2 [55]."
9,Results and discussion,"The amine group of aniline can act both as a donor and an acceptor of the HB. Notably, one aniline molecule can be simultaneously bound with three other aniline molecules through HBs, which are subject to continuous geometric reconfiguration in the liquid phase. The introduction of the fluorine substituent into the aniline structure was used in this work as a perturbation of the initial system to determine the possible changes in the profile of intermolecular interactions (of NH2, CH groups and F). Therefore, we have chosen complementary experimental and computational methods to investigate various aspects of this phenomenon."
10,EPS,"3.1 EPS To understand the differences and changes in the non-covalent interactions occurring in the studied systems, electrostatic potential surface maps (EPS) were calculated and analysed (Fig. 1 ). The substitution of fluorine slightly affects the charge on nitrogen, and according to the withdrawing (induction) [56] effect, the charge on nitrogen is the largest in 4F-aniline (qN = −0.82, −0.83, −0.81, −0.84 a.u. for aniline, 2F-, 3F-, and 4F-, respectively). Fluorine substitution influences the acidity of the hydrogen atoms in the aromatic system ( q ¯ = 0.22, 0.24, 0.25, and 0.32 a.u. for aniline, 2F-, 3F-, and 4F-aniline, respectively), increasing the ability of C–H to form weak HBs. In addition, the charge localised on the fluorine atoms is the highest in 4F-aniline compared to the other derivatives. The higher symmetry of this molecule compared to other fluoroanilines leads to the symmetric distribution of the atomic charges of hydrogens (Fig. 1). The distinct distributions of the electron density in the aromatic ring may be responsible for the changes in the intensity of the individual bands observed in the IR and Raman spectra, because the changing intensity of the individual bands is associated with a change in the dipole moment and polarization tensor of individual oscillations (Figs. 2 and 3 ) [32]. The obtained charges calculated for individual atoms show much larger differences depending on the position of fluorine substitution than those published by Wojciechowski et al. [32]. The charge on the nitrogen atom strongly depends on the location of fluorine in the aromatic ring, which is consistent with the inductive effect [56]."
11,Analysis of the experimental vibrational spectra,"3.2 Analysis of the experimental vibrational spectra Based on the vibrational analysis of the IR spectra obtained for the all studied systems (one frame selected from the AIMD trajectory, which contained 16 molecules; Table 1 ) and based on the studies by Wojciechowski et al. [16,32], the two key spectral regions were selected for further analysis, namely, i) the range of 3600–2800 cm−1, which includes the stretching vibrations of the groups involved in the formation of HBs (νNH, νCH), and ii) the range of 1300–1100 cm−1, which includes CF stretching vibrations (νCF) (Fig. 2). In the IR spectrum of aniline, asymmetric and symmetric NH2 stretching vibration bands (3435 cm−1 and 3351 cm−1, respectively), the overtone NH2 bending vibrations (3212 cm−1, which was mistakenly interpreted as a shift in the νsNH band caused by the appearance of strong HBs [19]), bands attributed to different modes of νCH stretching vibrations (3100–3000 cm−1), and NH2 bending vibrations (1618 cm−1) are observed (Fig. 2, Table 1). The vibrational analysis of the IR spectra obtained from one frame of the AIMD simulations agreed well with the spectra calculated by Wojciechowski et al. [32]. The small differences may be caused by using different functionals and basis sets. It should be emphasized that after adding fluorine to the aniline structure, a up-shift of the νNH stretching vibration bands was observed. This effect may be caused by the deterioration of the donor or acceptor properties of the amino group following the band shift increasing according to the order 3F- > 2F- > 4F- > aniline, which means that 3F-aniline has the weakest N–H⋯N HB (Fig. 2A, Table 1). Interestingly, additional intramolecular N–H⋯F HB in 2F-aniline affects νNH band shape but it is difficult to distinguish between inter- and intramolecular HBs contributions. Moreover, the bending vibrations of the NH2 scissors display a spectral shift toward higher wavenumbers (except not in 3F-aniline), which may indicate a decrease in the strength of N–H⋯N HBs (Fig. 2A, Table 1); however, coupling with different C–H bending vibrations of the aromatic ring makes the frequency of the NH2 scissors less specific, less sensitive, and thus less suitable for correlation studies [57]. Aniline substitution by fluorine causes changes in the symmetry of the individual C–H vibrations. The νCH stretching vibration bands are degenerated, and the involvement of C–H donors in the formation of an HB, with fluorine as an acceptor, causes a up-shift (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the shift of νCH towards higher wavenumbers is a characteristic feature of C–H⋯F HBs, which is unlike the behaviour of conventional HBs (e.g., O–H⋯O and N–H⋯N; Fig. 2A) [29]. Fluorine-substituted aromatic (ArF) compounds have a moderately strong IR band in a broad range frequency (1270–1100 cm−1),[58] which is attributed to C–F stretching, and thus, to identify and determine νCF, the obtained spectra of the fluorinated aniline derivatives were compared with fluorobenzene spectra (Fig. 2B). Fluorobenzene has a very intense single band at 1215 cm−1, which is not visible in aniline but is present in its fluorinated derivatives. In the case of 3F-aniline, the νCF band is strongly shifted towards lower wavenumbers (Δν = 73 cm−1). The vibrational analysis indicated that this is not a result of strong HBs formed with fluorine but rather the indirect influence of the substitution position of fluorine in the aniline ring (Fig. 2B). In the case of 2F- and 4F-aniline, the νCF band is slightly shifted towards lower wavenumbers (Δν ~ 20 cm−1) and showed splitting into two bands, which may be due to the presence of both bonded and unbonded CF groups (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Additionally, in 2F-aniline, this shift is larger than in the other derivatives due to the presence of intramolecular HBs. To test how given functional groups are involved in the formation of intermolecular interactions (mainly HB), FTIR spectra were recorded for a series of dilutions of tested samples in an inert solvent (CCl4). For the mentioned dilution series of 2F-aniline, the influence of intra- and intermolecular N–H⋯F HB on the position of the νNH bands was not possible to distinguish, suggesting that the νNH band (coupled with fluorine) is a low intensity band with only little influence on the position bands (Supp. Fig. 5). Additionally, the band shift of νCF towards higher wavenumbers is greatest for 4F-aniline (Δν = 10 cm−1), which leads to conclusion that fluorine most often participates in the formation of intermolecular N–H⋯F HB (Supp. Fig. 5). The smallest shift is observed for 3F-aniline, which means that fluorine has the weakest acceptor properties among all investigated fluoro-derivatives. This observation is consistent and correlates with AIMD simulations (Fig. 6). In the Raman spectrum of aniline (Fig. 3A), the intensity of the νNH stretching vibration is relatively low (the νasNH and νsNH bands are at approx. 3350 cm−1 and 3208 cm−1, respectively). After fluorine substitution, the strength of the N–H⋯N HB decreases, as evidenced by a decrease in the νNH intensity (for 3F-aniline, it is indistinguishable from noise; Fig. 3A), which may be due to the availability of the free electron pair in 3F-aniline being lower than that in the other derivatives [57]. At the same time, the shift towards higher wavenumbers for νsNH correlates with the IR spectrum and is larger for 3F-aniline than for aniline. In the case of 2F-aniline, νasNH showed a down-shift, which may be due to the presence of intramolecular HBs, and for 4F-aniline, the νasNH intensity is smaller than the spectral resolution (4 cm−1). Several modes of CH vibrations in Raman spectra, not coupled with other vibrations, can be indicated and used as specific markers of C–H⋯F HBs (Fig. 3). Compared to those involved in traditional HBs, the νCH bands involved in the C–H⋯F HB showed a high-frequency shift. It is observed that the strongest HB with fluorine occurs for 2F- and 4F-aniline, which is associated with the increased acidity of the protons of the aromatic ring (Fig. 1). For 3F-aniline, the νCH shift towards higher wavenumbers is the smallest among all the fluoro-derivatives. Therefore, the low energy of N–H⋯N HBs and slightly increased energy of C–H⋯F HBs may result in the inability of 3F-aniline to crystallise. Noteworthily, the νCF bands are hardly visible in the Raman spectrum, even though the C–F bond is one of the most stable and most polarized covalent bonds in organic chemistry [59]. Many changes in the FT-IR and Raman spectra, including the position of the individual bands attributed to the CH vibrations of fluorinated derivatives vs. aniline, might be caused by a change in the symmetry of the molecules as well as the extinction of various CH stretching and bending modes of the aromatic ring due to the substitution of the hydrogen atom with fluorine."
12,Calculation of vibrational spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics,"3.3 Calculation of vibrational spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were performed using DFTD3 method in the CP2K package for all the studied systems. Since theoretical spectra were usually computed by ignoring the intrinsic anharmonic character of the oscillations and an empirical scaling factor was usually used to correct for this deficiency [60]. The anharmonic effect can be included in the model but this requires an additional effort involved in computing anharmonic frequencies. However, such approach is unjustified due to usually small improvement in accuracy and a significant increase of the computational cost [61]. In the AIMD, the vibrational spectra which are obtained inherently, contain anharmonic effects because the forces acting on the atoms moving along a trajectory are computed on-the-fly, using an electronic-structure method [62]. The theoretical IR spectra calculated based on the AIMD methodology almost perfectly reconstructed the experimental spectra (Fig. 4 ). In particular, the range of vibrations involved in the formation of HBs (3600–3000 cm−1), which is hard to fully reproduce (e.g., due to coupling between N–H stretching and N⋯N stretching modes), shows the almost perfect reproduction of the experimental line shape and fine structure. The only difference between the spectra is the intensity of the individual bands. However, it should be noted that the number of structures considered in the simulations was limited, and thus, individual bands may have a different intensity due to the reduced number of oscillators (as well as terminal oscillators)."
13,Analysis of the type of hydrogen bonds formed in the AIMD simulations,"3.4 Analysis of the type of hydrogen bonds formed in the AIMD simulations An in-house Python tool was developed to identify and separate individual HBs and determine the type of donor or acceptor from the AIMD trajectories. Well reproduced experimental IR spectra based on the assumed model systems used in the AIMD simulations allow for further qualitative and quantitative analyses (Fig. 2) of the different HBs formed during the AIMD simulations. The results are illustrated as density maps, which show the distribution of individual types of HBs in the representation of their geometrical parameters (Fig. 5 ). Different type of interactions (such as N–H⋯N, C–H⋯N, C–H⋯F, N–H⋯F, N–H⋯π HB and π–π) could be extracted from the AIMD trajectory, but only fluorine- and amino group-engaging interactions (Fig. 5) were considered. To understand and quantify the obtained angular/distance density maps, all the individual HBs were considered, and the average number of HBs per frame was calculated (Fig. 6). The N–H⋯N maps (Fig. 5A) show that the area of the most populated HB geometric parameters is depopulated for 3- and 4F-aniline, which suggests that the number of HBs is reduced. For 2F-aniline, this area is comparable with that of aniline because the proximity of fluorine to NH2 fosters the formation of N–H⋯N HBs through the formation of intermolecular N–H⋯F interactions (Fig. 5). Additionally, the average number of N–H⋯N interactions per frame was decreased for 3F- and 4F-anilines (vs. aniline) due to the appearance of competitive HBs with fluorine and due to the increased acidity of aromatic protons (Fig. 1) and was practically unchanged for 2F-aniline, which could be attributed to the formation of the adjacent intermolecular N–H⋯F interaction, as mentioned above (the red circle in Fig. 5B). Intermolecular N–H⋯F HBs formed slightly less frequently than N–H⋯N HBs for 2F- and 3F-aniline and were formed more frequently for a 4F-derivative, suggesting that fluorine is also an efficacious acceptor of N–H donors. The number of N–H⋯F HBs is mainly dependent on the acidity of the proton of the NH2 group, suggesting that the proton in 3F-aniline is less positively charged than the protons in the other derivatives, and the proton in 4F-aniline is more positively charged than the protons in the other derivatives. In addition, the intramolecular HB in 2F-aniline, which was observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 8C, Tab. S1; geometrical parameters projected on the density map as a white circle in Fig. 5B) and simulation (black area in Fig. 5B, quantified as colourless bars in Fig. 6), also caused a low-frequency shift of the C–F band when compared to the fluorobenzene spectrum (Fig. 2B), and fluorine is permanently engaged in the formation of N–H⋯F iHBs. Fluorine substitution makes the hydrogens of the aromatic system more acidic (Fig. 1), thus increasing the ability of C–H donors to form weak HBs (WHBs) with fluorine or nitrogen (as in the crystal structure of 4F-aniline shown in Fig. 8C). Because C–H donors are 2-times more available than N–H donors, fluorine forms more C–H⋯F interactions; however, when normalized per donor, C–H⋯F interactions were slightly less abundant than N–H⋯F (Fig. 6)."
14,Crystal structure analysis,"3.5 Crystal structure analysis It’s worth stressing that Wojciechowski et al. [31,32] have tried to explain the impact of fluorine substitution on the individual oscillations based on the theoretical calculations performed for a single molecule (gas-phase approach). To further investigate the fluorine engagement/influence on the interaction patterns, we studied additionally the solid, crystalline phase of the investigated compounds. The crystal structure of aniline was determined previously by Funell and co-workers [20], and that of its 2F- and 4F-derivatives was determined by Chopra et al. [63]; nevertheless, we have tried to obtain the crystal of pure 3F-aniline by in situ crystal growing from the liquid under high-pressure, but the obtained crystals were insufficient for the X-ray experiment and further analysis. 3F-Aniline is the most stable monofluoro isomer with the highest N–H bond dissociation enthalpies (N-HBDE = 397.3, 401.3, and 393.4 kJ/mol for 2F-aniline, 3F-aniline, and 4F-aniline, respectively), [64] which confirms that the acidity (ΔHacidity = 1519.3, 1513.8, 1530.3 kJ/mol, for 2F-aniline, 3F-aniline, and 4F-aniline, respectively) of the proton in the 3F-derivative is lower than that in the other derivatives. Moreover, fluorine reduces the availability of the nitrogen atom’s free electron pair [64] through the π electron-withdrawing (inductive) effect, which, in total, may lead to the N–H⋯N energy in 3F-aniline being lower than that in the other fluorinated derivatives (Fig. 1). Based on the available crystal structures, the fluorine substitution affects the tetrahedral geometry of the NH2 group (Fig. 7 ), especially for 2F-aniline, deduced by reduction of the deviations of the nitrogen atom from the mean plane of the aromatic ring (Fig. 7, Fig. S2–S4: measures are expressed as the sum of the valence angles of the amine group: ΣNH2 = 343.6°, 350.0°, and 342.2° for aniline, 2F-aniline, and 4F-aniline, respectively). The nitrogen atom in 2F-aniline is not pyramidal (d = 0.000 Å; pyramidal geometry defined as the distance d of a nitrogen atom to the mean plane defined by three atoms single-bonded to the studied N) comparing to aniline and 4F-aniline (d = 0.240 Å and 0.239 Å, respectively). The observed effect of halogen substitution confirms the strong withdrawing character of fluorine in the proximity of the amine substituent. Interestingly, the C–F covalent bond length depends on the position of fluorine in the aromatic ring (i.e., 1.311(6), 1.368(2), and 1.364(2) Å for 2F-aniline (the more abundant molecule), 4F-aniline, and fluorobenzene [65], respectively; Fig. 7). The shortest C–F covalent bond distance for 2F-aniline indicates the formation of intramolecular HBs (Fig. S1, dH⋯F = 2.383 Å) and is shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii (Σ = 2.67 Å) [66]. The analysis of the crystal packing of aniline showed the dominant role of the self-complementary pair of N–H⋯N HBs (H⋯N distances = 2.358 Å and 2.510 Å) for the structure stabilization. Moreover, the –NH2 group is also involved in the formation of HBs, with the π electrons of the aromatic rings acting as the acceptor (the H⋯Ct distance is 2.612 Å, where Ct is a centroid of the aromatic ring; Fig. 8). The N–H⋯N HBs observed in the crystal structure of 2F-aniline are longer than those in aniline (Fig. 8, Tab. S1: N⋯Ndist = 3.191(1) Å vs. 3.173(1) Å and 3.470(1) Å vs. 3.322(1) Å, respectively), despite the formation of an additional N–H⋯F interaction, which caused the shorter HB to be almost linear (N–H⋯Nangle = 171.4°). It is also observed that in 2F-aniline, a C–H⋯F HB is shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii (2.603 Å). It is worth emphasizing that no N–H⋯N HBs were observed in the crystal structure of 4F-aniline (Fig. 8), but a weak C–H⋯N interaction (the C–H⋯N distance/angle = 2.682 Å/157.15°) was detected instead. However, the weak C–H⋯N contact shows a slightly longer interatomic distance than the sum of the van der Waals radii (2.52 Å) [66] but it is the only contact that stabilizes the crystal structure. The HBs observed in the crystal structure (the red circle in Fig. 5 and geometrically parameterised in Fig. 8) show differences, due to reduced degrees of freedom and kinetic energy comparing to molecular dynamic simulations (liquid state) (Fig. 5). The N–H⋯N HBs found in aniline crystal (Fig. 8) are less linear and shorter than the most populated obtained in AIMD (Fig. 5A), whereas in 2F-aniline almost the same geometrical parameters (Fig. 5A and 8) were observed. In 2F-aniline two N–H⋯F, intra- and intermolecular HBs were also detected (the red and white circle in Fig. 5B and Fig. 8). The intramolecular N–H⋯F HB has a limited ability to change distance and angle (due to oscillations of C–F bond) which causes perfect match of geometrical parameters observed in the crystal structure and dynamic simulation. In turn, intermolecular N–H⋯F HB found in the crystal of 2F-aniline (Fig. 8) is out of range of geometrical parameters observed in AIMD (red circle in Fig. 5B). In 4F-aniline crystal structure (Fig. 8C) only a C–H⋯F HB was observed, with shorter interatomic distance and more linear geometry than it was noticed during analysis of MD simulation results (Fig. 5C). To reveal the impact of intermolecular forces on the packing of the studied crystals, the Bader's quantum theory of atoms (QTAIM) [67] was applied using the AIMAll package [39]. The topological analysis of the electron density ρ(r) of the unit cells revealed bond critical points (BCPs), indicating the weak intermolecular interactions. The calculated energy of the N–H⋯N HB in aniline varies from −2.1 to −2.9 kcal/mol, whereas for 2F-aniline, the energy varies in the range of −1.3 to −3.3 kcal/mol. Thus, the presence of fluorine supports N–H⋯N interactions and, despite much better geometrical parameters (Fig. 7, Tab. S1), the N–H⋯N HB shows a small energy difference (−0.3 kcal/mol; Table 2 ). The calculated energies of the observed interactions involving fluorine seem to be close to those of conventional HBs (N–H⋯N) (−1.3 to −1.7 kcal/mol) but show different angular preferences [29]. Although it is claimed that WHBs are only slightly stronger than van der Waals interactions, WHBs are considered to be extremely important in chemistry and biology because of their potential for rapid rearrangements in different environments [68]."
15,Conclusions,"Aromatic amines are important molecules in the pharmaceutical industry and can play a significant role in the optimization of the ligand-protein binding mode, since the amine group of aniline can act both as a donor and an acceptor of the HB. This study was intended to investigate the direct and indirect influence of the fluorine substituent position on the geometrical preferences and determine the possible changes in the profile of intermolecular interactions using fluorine as a perturbing factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complex, theoretical and experimental analysis of the different types of HB networks in a relatively simple model system, which was performed using advanced and complementary techniques. The developed in-house scripts used for the analysis of the AIMD trajectories enabled the separation of the individual HBs formed during the 20 ps-long simulations. All the obtained results indicated that the fluorine substituent in the aniline ring indirectly decreases the strength of the N–H⋯N HBs, especially those in 3-F-aniline. This effect is observed in the FT-IR spectra, as the νNH bands shift towards higher wavenumbers, and the signals from 3F-aniline were the most affected. Moreover, the N–H⋯N HBs in the crystal structure of 2F-aniline are longer than those in aniline, despite the formation of an additional intermolecular N–H⋯F HB. In addition, fluorine acted as an HB acceptor for several N–H and C–H donors, whose hydrogens were also more acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing properties of fluorine. Fluorine makes the hydrogens of the amine group more acidic in the order 4F- > 2F- > 3F-aniline but, at the same time, reduces the availability of the free electron pair of nitrogen by the induction effect in the opposite order 3F- > 2F- > 4F-aniline. This may be the critical factor leading to difficulties with 3F-aniline crystallisation. Additionally, the substitution of fluorine to the aromatic ring induces the high acidity of selected C–H protons, which may result in the increased attractiveness of the WHBs in the crystal structure stabilization. Moreover, the position of fluorine in the aromatic ring strongly affects the C–F bond length, and it is worth emphasising that the intramolecular N–H⋯F HB observed for 2F-aniline causes an increase in the N–H bond stability. Although it is not possible to assess the net effect of fluorine substitution on the intermolecular interactions in neat fluoroaniline derivatives, it should be pointed out that the boiling point of both 3F-aniline and 4F-aniline is higher (186 and 187 °C, respectively) than that of 2F-aniline, in which fluorine is permanently engaged in the intramolecular N–H⋯F interaction and whose boiling point is slightly lower than that of aniline (182–183 and 184 °C for 2F-aniline and aniline, respectively). It is well known that a fluorine atom increases the acidity of the hydrogens of an amine group, so one would expect that the N–H⋯N HB in the fluorinated aniline should be stronger (a more linear geometry and shorter distance) than that in aniline. The HB acceptor properties of the nitrogen decrease due to the withdrawing effect of the fluorine substituent, and thus, the net effect of fluorination on the N–H⋯N HB in F-substituted aniline vs. aniline is difficult to predict. In homogeneous substances, fluorine affects both donors and acceptors of HBs. Thus, the influence of fluorine-substituted (drug-like) molecules on the interaction pattern should be investigated, starting from small-molecular systems (e.g., solvent molecules) to proteins (e.g., ligand binding pockets). We believe that the abovementioned results and future similar analyses of more complex systems may decipher the complex nature of the direct and indirect influence of fluorine on the properties of biologically active molecules and their interactions with the targets [6,8,13,68,69]."
