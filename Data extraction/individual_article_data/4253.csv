0,Introduction,"Polymer nanocomposites are a new group of materials consisting of two or more phases, one of which is nano-sized. They have attracted great attention lately because they exhibit superior properties that a single polymer does not have [1,2]. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a non-toxic and chemically inert biodegradable synthetic polymer is commercially available and widely used in the industry. PVA has excellent film forming, adhesive, flexibility, high oxygen barrier and emulsifying properties. As PVA undergoes pyrolysis, it decomposes rapidly above 200 °C [3]. Therefore, the thermal properties of PVA need to be improved in some applications. Recently, polymer/carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites have attracted great attention of researchers in various field such as material science and chemistry due to the superior properties of CNTs such as high modulus and high thermal properties [4]. CNT is a tube shape of graphene sheets rolled into a cylindrical shape. The incorporation of CNTs into the polymeric matrix can significantly affect the properties of polymers [5]. This depends on nature of the type of CNTs and preparation methods [2,6]. Methods such as solution casting, melt-mixing, agglomeration, and in-situ polymerization have been developed to synthesize polymer/CNT nanocomposites. These methods have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. The key issues in improving the properties of the polymer in this case are the homogeneous distribution of CNT in the polymer matrix and the interface interaction between CNT and the polymer [7]. There is a great challenge in processing and engineering of CNTs due to their insolubility in most solvents [4,8]. The presence of CNTs as bundles, aggregates, and ropes during nanocomposite fabrication leads to a poor dispersion in the polymer matrix and produces many irregularities in the resulted nanocomposite [4,9]. Recently, there have been numerous studies on the synthesis of nanocomposites with various polymers using CNTs. For example, the effects of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and modified MWCNT samples on thermal properties of poly(vinyl acetate) were previously investigated by our research group. It was found that the thermal stability, degradation temperatures (Tmax1 and Tmax2) and Tx values of PVAc increased [10]. In yet another study, we examined thermal kinetic properties of PMMA/modified-MWCNT nanocomposites. Both MWCNT and MWCNT-OH increased the glass transition temperature of PMMA. Using Kissinger and FWO equations, the activation energies were calculated to be 263 and 261 kJ/mol for PMMA in DMF, and 198 and 198 kJ/mol for PMMA in THF [11]. Piperopoulos et al. (2011) synthesized MWCNT/oxides hybrid materials for polymer composite applications [12]. Due to the difficulties associated with dispersing the CNT in the polymer matrix, improvements in the properties of polymers are not yet at the desired level. The chemical functionalization of CNT surface by oxidation procedure or physical adsorption/grafting protocols has been found to be a convenient and effective tool to improve the dispersion of CNTs in organic and/or aqueous media. Additionally, the attached functional groups may enhance the interfacial interactions between CNTs and the polymer matrix due to the addition of surfactants, resulting in a more homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in the polymer matrix [13]. Islam and Beg (2018) reported that the hydroxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) reinforced polyester-based composites prepared by mixed blending were more effective for homogeneous dispersion and showed better mechanical properties compared to non-functionalized and carboxyl group-functionalized MWCNTs [14]. Similarly, it has been shown that glass fiber (GF) and hydroxyl-functionalized MWCNTs-reinforced polyester-based composites produced by solution casting technique are more effective than others in improving the properties of composites [15]. These results clearly show that surface modification plays an important role in improving the properties of CNT nanocomposites. There are also some studies in the literature on the synthesis and characterization of PVA/MWCNT, PVA/SWCNT, PVA/modified MWCNT and PVA/modified SWCNT nanocomposites. Choi et al. (2009) used acid functionalized MWCNT/PVA nanocomposite membranes to separate 90/10 wt% ethanol/water mixture and achieved better flux and separation factor [16]. Peng et al. (2007) developed β-CD modified CNT–PVA nanocomposite membranes and effectively used them to separate the benzene/cyclohexane mixture [17]. Alghunaim (2016) prepared both single and multi-walled carbon nanotube doped with low content of PVA by casting technique [2]. Mallakpour et al. (2014) examined the effects of MWCNT modified by L-phenylalanine amino acid on dispersion in the PVA matrix. It has been revealed that inclusion of just a few percent of f-MWCNTs can significantly improve the mechanical and thermal properties of PVA [18]. Malikov et al. (2014) synthesized PVA based MWCNT nanocomposites and emphasized that the most prominent aspect of this study was the use of the Fischer esterification reaction to create a permanent link between the nanotubes and the PVA matrix [19]. Sumdani et al. (2019) investigated the effects of linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (LABSA) on the mechanical, thermal, structure and morphological properties of epoxy–MWCNT composites. It has been shown that all these properties are improved significantly by the surface treatment of the MWCNTs using LABSA [20]. In another study presented by Sumdani et al. (2018), the effects of steric repulsion variation between MWCNTs and anionic surfactant in epoxy nanocomposites were examined. It was determined that the thermal properties of the composites increased significantly with the addition of MWCNTs [21]. Luan et al. (2019) investigated the effect of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate surfactant on the mechanical properties of PVA films reinforced with SWCNTs and Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The composite made with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate dispersed SWCNTs at a 4 wt% loading percentage showed good dispersion, with the highest tensile strength (97 MPa) among all tested SWCNT reinforced films and an increase of 21% compared to the pure PVA film (80 MPa) [22]. In the above studies, PVA/MWCNT and partly PVA/SWCNT nanocomposites were synthesized under different conditions with different methods. However, to the best of our knowledge there are no studies showing the effect of modification with organo silane compound containing –NH2 functional group and SDS surfactant on thermal properties of PVA/p-SWCNT and PVA/modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites. Castell et al. (2013) presented an effective strategy involving PVP and SDBS dispersants for preparing advanced composites using PVA and MWCNTs. Although SDBS surfactant alone appeared to be the most efficient dispersing agent in the PVA matrix it did not cause any significant improvement in thermal properties [23]. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to fabricate PVA/p-SWCNT, PVA/modified p-SWCNT, PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT and PVA/SDS/modified SWCNT nanocomposites using solution casting method and experimentally analyze and compare the thermal properties of these nanocomposites. The first new approach of this study is to modify the SWCNT surface with organo silane compound containing amine group and to investigate the effect of modified p-SWCNT on thermal properties of PVA. The second is to examine the effect of SDS on thermal properties of PVA/p-SWCNT and PVA/modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites by considering the effects of functional groups, the amount of filler and SDS surfactant. In this study, firstly, modified p-SWCNT samples and then nanocomposites were synthesized. PVA, p-SWCNT, modified p-SWCNT and their nanocomposites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), BET device, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)."
1,Material and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material SWCNT (purity 92%) was purchased from Nanografi, Turkey. Properties of SWCNT were given in Table 1 . PVA (number average molecular weight of 86,000 g/mol) was purchased from Across Organics; hydrochloric acid and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) from Merck Chemical Co., Germany; hydrogen peroxide, acetone and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany; toluene from Lab-Scan, Thailand; methanol from Carlo Erba, France; and iron II chloride tetrahydrate from VWR Chemicals, USA. All chemicals used in experimental studies were of analytical grade and were used without further purification."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods The purchased SWCNT was mixed with HCl (5 M) for 48 h, filtered and washed with distilled water. It was then functionalized with hydroxyl (-OH) and silane group and used in nanocomposite synthesis. Finally, nanocomposites were synthesized by adding of p-SWCNT and modified p-SWCNT into polymer matrices using the solution casting method [24]. 2.2.1 Hydroxylation of p-SWCNT p-SWCNT (1 g) and FeCl2.4H2O (0.3 M; 90 mL) were added to a reaction flask. It was kept in an ultrasonic bath at 30 °C for 1 h. The mixture was placed on a magnetic stirrer, and H2O2 (30%, 360 mL) was slowly added dropwise via a dropping funnel. It was then stirred on magnetic stirrer at room temperature for 12 h. After mixing, it was filtered with 0.45 μm filter paper using a vacuum filtering device. To remove solid residues, HCl (5%) was passed several times through the filtrate and washed with distilled water until the pH value of 7. After washing, the substance was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h and then in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 48 h. p-SWCNT functionalized with Fe2+ and 30% H2O2 was shown as p-SWCNT-OH. Fig. 1 shows the synthesis reaction of p-SWCNT-OH from p-SWCNT [25]. 2.2.2 p-SWCNT-O-APTS synthesis from p-SWCNT-OH APTS (2 mL), toulene (50 mL) and p-SWCNT-OH (1 g) were added to a reaction flask. It was kept in an ultrasonic bath at 30 °C for 30 min. The mixture was placed on the magnetic stirrer and stirred under reflux at 80 °C for 24 h. After mixing, the reaction product was filtered and washed sequentially three times with toluene, methanol, and acetone to remove the solid residues. After washing, the material was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h and then in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h. p-SWCNT functionalized with APTS was shown as p-SWCNT-O-APTS. Fig. 1 shows the synthesis reaction of p-SWCNT-O-APTS from p-SWCNT-OH [26]. 2.2.3 Synthesis of nanocomposites PVA (1 g) was placed in a flask with 50 mL of hot water and mixed on a magnetic stirrer. Different amounts of carbon nanotube (0.1, 0.5 and 1 wt%) were added to another flask and then 50 mL of hot water was added. This suspension was kept in the homogenizer device at 5-minute intervals for a total of 20 min. PVA solution and suspension were kept in an ultrasonic bath at 70 °C for 2 h. The PVA solution and the suspension were combined and sonicated for 2 h, and then stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 1 h. The mixture was poured into a 100 mL teflon Petri dish and the water was removed in an oven at 60 °C. It was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 1 week. PVA/p-SWCNT nanocomposites were obtained in the form of films [27]. The same method was used in the synthesis of all other nanocomposites. SDS (1 wt%) was also used to disperse the p-SWCNT samples more homogeneously in the polymer matrix [28]."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization BET surface areas of p-SWCNT and modified p-SWCNT samples were measured with a Nova2200e instrument (Quantachrome Instruments). Before the measurements, the samples were degassed at 100 °C for 4 h. FTIR-ATR analyzes of PVA, carbon nanotubes and prepared nanocomposite films were performed with PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR-ATR spectrometer in the transmission mode in the wavelength range of 4000–600 cm−1. The thermal gravimetric analyzes of the samples were made under nitrogen atmosphere with a temperature increases of 10 °C per minute by the PerkinElmer Diamond simultaneous DTA/TG device. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the samples were determined using the PerkinElmer DSC 4000 device with a temperature increase of 10 °C per minute under nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range of 25–400 °C. The AFM topographies of the synthesized samples were analyzed under ambient conditions using Nanosurf Easyscan 2 AFM with 0 mV constant amplitude in the “tapping” probe mode (Tap190AL-G) with 48 N/m pressure at 190 kHz. SEM and TEM images of samples were taken using ZEISS EVO LS 10 scanning electron microscopy and JEOL JEM-1400 Plus transmission electron microscopy, respectively."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Characterization of SWCNT samples,"3.1 Characterization of SWCNT samples FTIR spectra of p-SWCNT, p-SWCNT-OH and p-SWCNT-O-APTS samples are given in Fig. 2 . The observed bands at 1257, 1453 and 1167 cm−1 originate from oxygen-containing functional groups such as C-O-C, C-OH and CO, and bands at 1600–1650 cm−1 are due to CC bonds in the structure of SWCNT. In addition, the carbonyl group (C=O) exits at ~1730 cm−1 indicating the presence of carboxylic or ester group. Characteristic bands such as CO (1734 cm−1), C-OH (1453 cm−1), C-O-C (1257 cm−1) and CO (1167 cm−1) were observed in FTIR spectrum of CNTs [29]. Yang et al. (2014) suggested that the bands observed at the 2920 and 2850 cm−1 are confirmation of the presence of CH bonds associated with the alkyl and alkoxyl groups in aminosilane. The band at 1116 cm−1 and the weak band at 1456 cm−1 were assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of Si–O–R bond accompanied by the bending vibration of SiC and Si–OH bonds, and the bending vibration of the NH bond in aminosilane, respectively [30]. In another study, Su et al. (2009) emphasized that bands observed at 3370, 2950, 2370, 1600 and 1030 cm−1 in the IR spectra of CNT-APTS samples are related to NH, NH2, CH2, NH and Si-O-Si (C) vibrations, respectively [31]. After the purification and modification processes, a wide flat band between 3000 and 3500 cm−1 and a new band between 1600 and 1700 cm−1 were observed. Bands in the range of 3000–3500 cm−1 (3435) in the FTIR spectrum of p-SWCNT-OH indicate the presence of the hydroxyl group (OH stretch vibrations); and the characteristic band at 2928 cm−1 shows CH stress vibrations. The disappearance of the hydroxyl band in the FTIR spectrum indicates successful synthesis of p-SWCNT-O-APTS [32–34]. BET surface areas of SWCNT, p-SWCNT, p-SWCNT-OH and p-SWCNT-O-APTS samples were measured as 509.8, 431.4, 362.2 and 59.6 m2/g, respectively. BET surface areas of p-SWCNTs are reduced by purification and modification processes. The reasons for the reduction in the surface area may be the structural defects in the tubular structure by modification and/or hydroxyl and APTS compounds that close or fill the pores [35,36]. Cai et al. (2017) studied BET surface area and micropore volume of manganese-terephthalic acid (Mn (TPA)), SWCNT and manganese-terephthalic acid/SWCNT (Mn (TPA)-SWCNTs) and found BET surface areas of the samples as 668.61, 5.54 and 10.03 m2/g, respectively [37]. In another study, Yang et al. (2010) investigated the electrochemical hydrogen storage properties of SWCNT electrodes coated with Ni nanoparticles. They determined the BET surface areas of SWCNT samples added with 0, 4, 8 and 12% of Ni nanoparticles by weight as 584,8, 520,8, 478,6 and 436,0 m2/g, respectively. The BET surface areas of SWCNT samples modified with Ni nanoparticles were measured to be lower than that of SWCNT [38]. The changes in the surface areas of p-SWCNT and modified p-SWCNT samples are quite consistent with the results given in the literature. TG thermograms of SWCNT, p-SWCNT and modified SWCNT samples in the temperature range of 25–600 °C are given in Fig. 3 . The mass losses of SWCNT, p-SWCNT, p-SWCNT-OH and p-SWCNT-O-APTS were calculated to be 10, 6, 13 and 24 wt%, respectively. The residual amounts of SWCNT, p-SWCNT, p-SWCNT-OH and p-SWCNT-O-APTS were determined as 90.40, 94.05, 87.44 and 76.32 wt%, respectively. These results show that while the mass loss of SWCNT decreases with purification, it increases with modification. The thermal stabilities of the samples are very high as can be seen in Fig. 3. The reduction of mass loss by purification may result from the removal of impurities with low thermal stability, and the oxidation and removal of adsorbed substances attached to the surface by hydroxyl and silane modification [39]. TEM images of p-SWCNT, p-SWCNT-OH and p-SWCNT-O-APTS samples are given in Fig. 4 . As seen in the figure, p-SWCNT and modified p-SWCNT samples are in tube morphology with radii of the nanometer scale. When the images of p-SWCNT and modified p-SWCNT samples were compared, the diameters and length of the tubes were similar, but with addition of functional groups, point and spherical structures were formed. This might be an indication of the p-SWCNT surface modified with the functional groups, consistent with the FTIR-ATR results."
7,PVA/p-SWCNT and PVA/modified SWCNT nanocomposites,"3.2 PVA/p-SWCNT and PVA/modified SWCNT nanocomposites 3.2.1 FTIR-ATR analysis of PVA nanocomposites Combining SWCNTs with PVA poses difficulties due to dispersion and interactions. Modification of SWCNTs can solve these problems. In this study, SWCNT has been modified with –OH and –NH2 functional groups that will interact with the hydroxyl groups on the PVA and assist the dispersion and interaction. The reason for choosing amino group to treat SWCNTs is that hydrophilic groups must be attached on the SWCNTs rather than hydrophobic groups to aid in dispersion and interactions between SWCNTs and PVA [18]. FTIR-ATR analysis was used to examine the interactions between PVA and its nanocomposites. The characteristic bands of PVA film are summarized in Table 2 [2]. FTIR-ATR spectra of PVA and all its nanocomposites were taken and only spectra of PVA/p-SWCNT-OH and PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT-OH nanocomposites are given in Fig. 5 . Characteristic absorption bands for pure PVA were observed at 3271 cm−1 (OH stretching), at 2938 and 2904 cm−1 (CH2 asymmetric and symmetric stretchings), at 1653 cm−1 (C=C), at 1327 cm−1 (CH bending), at 1236 cm−1 (CH wagging), at 1141 cm−1 (CC and C-O-C stretching), at 916 cm−1 (CH2 rocking), at 836 cm−1 (CC stretching) [2]. Some shifts observed in the PVA bands in the FTIR-ATR spectra of nanocomposites towards lower or higher wave numbers confirm their formation. It is considered that the shifts occurring especially in the 3271, 2938, 1417, 1327, 1086 and 916 cm-1 bands are caused by the interactions between the OH groups of PVA and p-SWCNT-OH. When FTIR-ATR spectra of nanocomposites are examined, it is seen that OH bands shift to higher wavenumbers. They increased with the increase of the percentage of p-SWCNT and p-SWCNT-OH in the polymer matrix. As the percentage of p-SWCNT-O-APTS increases from 0.1 to 0.5% by weight in the polymer matrix, the wavenumber shifts to a higher value in the OH bands. On the other hand, when the filling ratio increases to 1% by weight this shifts goes towards a lower wavenumber. In addition, 1561 cm−1 PVA band disappears in the FTIR-ATR spectra of nanocomposites and new bands are formed at 1020 cm−1, which is not seen in pure polymer. With the addition of SDS into the PVA matrix, the OH bands at 3271 cm−1 of PVA shifts to higher wavenumbers such as 3274 cm−1 in PVA/SDS. In PVA/SDS nanocomposites, OH bands shift to lower wavenumbers. The shift in OH bands gradually shifts towards the lower wavenumber with an increase of the percentage of p-SWCNT, p-SWCNT-OH and p-SWCNT-O-APTS in the polymer matrix. Possible interactions between PVA and modified p-SWCNT samples are shown in Fig. 6 . FTIR-ATR spectra of the nanocomposites synthesized by adding modified p-SWCNT samples at different contents into PVA matrix show that significant interactions occur between PVA and modified p-SWCNTs. Jose et al. (2015) synthesized nanocomposite membranes with modified MWCNT and PVA and presented the possible interaction between them with a result similar to Fig. 6 [40]. 3.2.2 Morphology of PVA nanocomposites The microstructure and morphologies of p-SWCNT and modified SWCNT samples in the PVA matrix were examined by SEM, AFM and TEM devices. SEM images of PVA/p-SWCNT (0.1 wt%), PVA/p-SWCNT (0.5 wt%), PVA/p-SWCNT (1 wt%), PVA/p-SWCNT-OH (1 wt%) and PVA/p-SWCNT-O-APTS (1 wt%) nanocomposites at different magnifications are given in Fig. 7 . SEM images show that p-SWCNT and modified SWCNT are evenly distributed in the PVA matrix. Even in nanocomposites containing 1 wt% CNTs, the modified SWCNT was found to be well dispersed in the PVA matrix without agglomeration. It is also seen that the fillers are well dispersed without clumping in the PVA/p-SWCNT-OH (1 wt%) and PVA/p-SWCNT-O-APTS (1 wt%) nanocomposites. Surface roughness, commonly referred to as roughness, is a component of the surface texture. The shape and size of irregularities on a machined surface have a significant impact on the quality and performance of that surface. Measuring surface roughness and managing fine irregularities on the surface are crucial to maintaining high product performance. Rough surfaces generally wear faster and have higher coefficients of friction than smooth surfaces. Roughness is generally a good indicator of the performance of a mechanical component. On the other hand, roughness can increase adhesion [41]. Roughness plays an important role in determining how the object will interact with its environment. Surface roughness and porosity are critical factors in semiconductor material production, high quality X-ray mirrors in optics, and determining the paint thickness required to coat a part. For these reasons, it is necessary to measure the surface roughness, i.e. the microscopic smoothness of the surfaces. A roughness value can be calculated on profile (line) or surface (area). The profile roughness parameter (Ra, Rq) is more common. Area roughness parameters (Sa, Sq) give more significant values [42]. Profile and area roughness parameter values of PVA nanocomposites are given in Table 3 . Sa and Sq quantitative area roughness parameter values of PVA nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 8 . Two and three-dimensional AFM images of PVA/p-SWCNT (0.1 wt%), PVA/p-SWCNT (0.5 wt%), PVA/p-SWCNT (1 wt%), PVA/p-SWCNT-OH (1 wt%) and PVA/p-SWCNT-O-APTS (1 wt%) nanocomposites synthesized using solution casting method are given in Fig. 9 with surface scanning results of 25 × 25 μm2. In PVA/p-SWCNT nanocomposites, it was observed that the area roughness value increased as the filler ratio increased. When nanocomposites containing 1 wt% CNT were examined, it was observed that the area roughness values of p-SWCNT-OH, p-SWCNT-O-APTS and p-SWCNT increased. It should also be noted that these measured values do not represent a significant surface roughness, as AFM takes measurements at nanoscale [43]. It can also be stated that the p-SWCNT and modified SWCNT samples are homogeneously distributed in the PVA matrix. TEM images of PVA/p-SWCNT-OH (1 wt%) and PVA/p-SWCNT-O-APTS (1 wt%) nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 4. It was observed that the polymer/modified SWCNT samples were evenly distributed on the grids, and the SWCNT samples had a tubular structure [44]. It was determined that p-SWCNT-OH and p-SWCNT-O-APTS samples with a radius of nanometer length were homogeneously distributed in the PVA matrix. 3.2.3 Thermal properties The thermal stability of PVA is affected by the amount of the fillers added to the matrix, the surface modification of the fillers and the concentration and types of surfactants in nanocomposite synthesis media, due to the enhanced interface interactions between different components [45]. TG thermograms of PVA film, PVA/p-SWCNT, PVA/modified p-SWCNT, PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT and PVA/SDS/modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites were performed. Fig. 10 shows TG thermograms of PVA/p-SWCNT-OH and PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT-OH nanocomposites (others not shown for clarity). Pure PVA shows two steps weight loss; the first weight loss occurring in the temperature range of 200–400 °C is attributed to the polymer dehydration and formation of a polyacetylene-like structure, and the second major degradation observed in the temperature range of 400–550 °C is related to the decomposition of the PVA main chain [18]. Similar to PVA film, the degradation of nanocomposites also takes place in two steps. The thermal degradation of PVA/p-SWCNT nanocomposites usually occurs at a lower temperature than pure PVA film. This may be a result of the enormous thermal conductivity due to the presence of MWCNTs or possibly the reduction in the number of intra and inter hydrogen bonds of PVA after the addition of p-SWCNT or modified p-SWCNT [45]. Tx value is the temperature indicating that the analyzed sample has degraded at x wt% amount. These values are given in Table 4 . In general, except T80, T5, Tmax1 and Tmax2 temperatures of PVA/p-SWCNT and PVA/p-SWCNT-OH nanocomposites decreased compared to pure PVA, whereas T5, T80, Tmax1 and Tmax2 temperatures of PVA/p-SWCNT-O-APTS nanocomposites increased. This increase may be due to the possibility of increasing hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of the polymer and the -NH2 and O groups of the modified p-SWCNT. The residual amount increases with increasing the amount of filling. In general, the adding of p-SWCNT and its modified samples into the PVA matrix does not cause an increase in the thermal properties of the pure polymer. Similar results were reported in the literature for PVA nanocomposites. Alkan and Benlikaya synthesized and characterized PVA nanocomposites with sepiolite and heat treated sepiolite. In the related study, it was stated that the thermal decomposition temperature of nanocomposites decreased with the addition of sepiolite/heat treated sepiolites into PVA matrix [46]. In the study conducted by Diouri and Baitoul (2014) the effect of carbon nanotubes dispersion on morphology, internal structure, and thermal stability of electrospun PVA/CNT nanofibers were investigated. It was stated that the thermal stability of the composite fibers depends on the loading fraction and on the type of carbon nanotubes [45]. The temperature values of PVA/SDS film, PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT and PVA/SDS/modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites causing mass losses of 5 and 80 wt% are shown in Table 4. The temperature values of PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT nanocomposites occurred at higher temperatures compared to PVA/SDS. This can be attributed to the ability of CNTs to act as physical barriers to prevent the transport of volatile decomposed products from the PVA nanocomposite during thermal decomposition [47]. Also, although Tmax1 values of PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT or modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites were higher than only PVA/SDS film, Tmax2 values were higher than both PVA and PVA/SDS films. The highest rate of temperature increase was measured as 9.1 °C at Tmax1 in PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT (0.5 wt%) and 9.8 °C at Tmax2 in PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT-O-APTS (0.1%). In addition, the residual amount increases with the increasing amount of filling. When the thermograms were examined, it was observed that the decomposition temperature of nanocomposites increased compared to PVA/SDS film. However, the degradation mechanism of the polymer did not change with the addition of p-SWCNT or modified SWCNT samples into the PVA matrix. The surfactants help the p-SWCNT samples to disperse well in the PVA matrix due to steric repulsion and prevent the nanotubes from re-agglomeration. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 11 . These well-dispersed nanotubes strongly interact with the polymer and therefore the thermal stability of the nanocomposites increases [20]. Also, another reason for the increase in thermal stability of nanocomposites in the presence of surfactants is that the interfacial bonding between PVA and SWCNTs becomes stronger compared to PVA. Thus, the cross-linking density of the polymer increases because of the reduced mobility of the polymeric chain [48]. Therefore, the nanocomposites were thermally more stable in the presence of surfactants compared to pure PVA. As can be seen in Table 4, it appears that 0.5 wt% is the optimal SWCNT concentration to achieve better thermal properties. Similar result was found by Sumdani et al. (2019) for epoxy/MWCNT composites. They studied the effect of different percentages of MWCNTs on the mechanical, thermal, structural, and morphological properties of the epoxy/MWCNT composites and determined that the loading of 0.5 wt% MWCNTs showed the highest thermal stability [48]. In the current study, the higher loading of the SWCNTs into PVA matrix reduced the thermal properties of p-SWCNT-based PVA nanocomposites due to poor dispersion of the MWCNTs. In addition, higher loading of p-SWCNTs can cause re-agglomeration among themselves in the nanocomposites, so p-SWCNTs are poorly dispersed and lead to decreased thermal stability. Ramimoghadam et al. (2012) investigated the effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the properties of ZnO synthesized by hydrothermal method. They observed that the degradation temperature and residual amount of ZnO increased in the presence of SDS [49]. Similar to this work, both thermal properties and residual amounts of nanocomposites synthesized in SDS media were found to be higher than that of PVA/p-SWCNT or modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites in our study. P-SWCNT is thermally very stable and did not degrade in the temperature range studied. Adding SDS to PVA/p-SWCNT or modified p-SWCNT media improves the dispersion of p-SWCNT samples in the polymer matrix, increasing the interaction between them. Therefore, there is a possibility that surfactants will decompose gradually and move to higher temperature [49]. The residual amounts of nanocomposites produced by the addition of SDS also increase as the decomposition temperature shifts to higher temperatures. The glass transition temperature is the temperature at which the polymers begin to soften and can be determined by DSC analysis. The interpretation of Tg temperature of nanocomposites provides us with an indirect and fast method to determine both their dispersion and effective transfer properties from the SWCNTs to the polymeric matrix [23]. The glass transition temperatures of polymers and their nanocomposites have therefore been determined. The addition of increasing amounts of filler to the PVA matrix caused an increase in the glass transition temperature. Tg values of nanocomposites belonging to PVA and p-SWCNT samples are given in Table 4. From the analysis of data, the Tg value of PVA was found to be 72.8 °C. The increase in glass transition temperatures of nanocomposites produced by adding p-SWCNT and modified p-SWCNT to the PVA matrix varied from 0.5 to 3.4 °C compared to pure PVA. On the other hand, the increases in glass transition temperatures of nanocomposites synthesized by the addition of SDS were in the range of 3.8 to 5.8 °C compared to PVA/SDS. The highest increase was observed for PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT-OH (1 wt%) nanocomposite. From these results, it can be concluded that all nanocomposites increase the glass transition temperature of PVA. Another implication that can be drawn from these results is that the SDS added to the polymer matrix, the surface modification of p-SWCNT and the filling ratio affect the glass transition temperature and the thermal properties of PVA. The addition of SDS to the polymer matrix may have reduced the strength of van der Waals attraction forces between carbon nanotubes. SDS may have caused the carbon nanotubes to disperse homogeneously in the polymer matrix without agglomeration and the stronger interaction of the polymer and carbon nanotube. Guirguis et al. (2012) found Tg value of PVA as 88.1 °C [50]. In another study reported by Cadek et al. (2000), the thermal stability of PVA/MWCNT nanocomposites were investigated by DSC analysis. They stated that Tg values increased with increasing amount of MWCNT [51]. In our study, Tg value of PVA was determined as 72.8 °C. These differences between the glass transition temperatures of the same polymers may be due to the different molecular weights of the polymers used or to the different synthesis methods."
8,Conclusions,"PVA/p-SWCNT and PVA/modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites were synthesized according to the solution casting method and characterized by FTIR-ATR, BET, DTA/TG, DSC, SEM, AFM and TEM devices. FTIR-ATR analysis showed that interactions occurred between PVA and modified p-SWCNT samples. Thermal degradation of PVA/modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites generally occurred at lower temperature than PVA film, but they occurred at higher temperatures for PVA/SDS/modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites. The SDS added into polymer matrix, the modification of SWCNT and the filling ratio affected the glass transition temperature of PVA. The addition of modified p-SWCNT into the polymer matrix raised the glass transition temperatures of PVA. SEM, TEM and AFM analyses showed that p-SWCNT and modified p-SWCNT samples were homogeneously distributed in the PVA matrix at the nanoscale with fibrous structures seen on surface morphologies. In PVA/p-SWCNT nanocomposites, as the filler ratio increased, the surface roughness increased and for nanocomposites containing 1 wt% filler, the surface roughness increased during p-SWCNT-OH, p-SWCNT-O-APTS and p-SWCNT. Moreover, it was determined that the surface area of SWCNT decreased with the modification, that mass loss of SWCNT decreased with purification, but increased with modification, and that the modification of SWCNT with hydroxyl and silane groups successfully occurred. It has also been found that SDS is very effective in the homogeneous distribution of carbon nanotubes in the polymer matrix and in increasing the interaction between polymer and carbon nanotubes. In this study, homogeneous PVA/SDS/p-SWCNT or modified p-SWCNT nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized due to the strong interaction of p-SWCNT with the PVA matrix dispersed in sodium dodecyl sulfate. They have been characterized in detail using a variety of techniques. These nanocomposite materials can be explored for potential applications from new type of coatings to adhesives and related fields."
