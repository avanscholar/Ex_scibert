0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols (CnH2n+1OH, n≥2) are widely used as versatile additives and chemicals in modern petroleum and chemical industries [1–3]. For instance, C2-C5 alcohols (CnH2n+1OH, n=2–5) are attractive fuels and clean fuel additives to increase the octane number and reduce the polluted emissions of gasoline for its good solubility with hydrocarbons and high overall heating value [4]. C6+ alcohols (CnH2n+1OH, n≥6) are usually applied in the field of manufacturing of plasticizers, lubricants and detergents [5]. Currently, higher alcohols are generally produced through two processes, (i). ALFOLÒ process based on the work of Dr. Ziegler [6], (ii). Oxo process (hydroformylation process) [7]. However, commercial success of the two routes is limited by their drawbacks. Firstly, the ALFOLÒ process is a five-step reaction and employs dangerous organic aluminum as catalysts, so that it is not attractive for large-scale production. Secondly, Oxo process has three steps in sequence: long-chain olefins are firstly separated from the Sasol’s Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) products, then hydroformylated with a CO/H2 (1:1) mixture into the corresponding aldehydes, and finally hydrogenated into higher alcohols. Since these processes are very complicated, many attempts have been made to develop the one-step method based on CO hydrogenation from syngas (a CO/H2 mixture), which could be made from coal, natural gas, shale gas, coal-bed gas as well as biomass, for higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) [2,8–10]. Mixed alcohols and high quality fuels with low sulfides and aromatics can be produced simultaneously through this process [11–14]. The existing catalysts for HAS are generally divided into four groups, which are Rh-based catalysts [15–17], modified methanol synthesis catalysts [18–20], Mo-based catalysts [21–23] and modified F-T catalysts [24–26]. Among the four groups of catalysts, modified F-T catalysts attract much attention for their low cost, high reaction activity and C2+OH selectivity, etc. For example, modified Co-based F-T catalysts were widely used for HAS, such as CuCo-based catalysts [27–31], PtCo-based catalysts [32–34], alkali/alkaline earth-Co-based catalysts [35,36] and FeCo-based catalysts [37–40]. FeCo-based catalysts for F-T synthesis have been extensively investigated [37–49], some of the studies indicated that the catalysts with Co-Fe alloy could produce mixed alcohols [37–40]. These studies inferred that the alcohols formation was related to the appearance of the Co-Fe alloy. Moreover, the alcohols selectivity depended on the Co/Fe ratio [38,40], support structure [37] and reactor types [39]. Besides, we proposed a series of promising modified F-T catalysts which has the advantages (i.e., high selectivity towards C6+ alcohols, low selectivity to HC2-4 and CO2, high catalytic activity as well as moderate reaction conditions) in producing linear mixed alcohols: Co/Co2C based catalysts with activated carbon (AC) as the support [50–53]. Extensive researches revealed that the synergistic effect provided by the conjunction of Co and Co2C at the interface was responsible for the generation of alcohols [54]. The dual active center of this series of catalysts is Co/Co2C, in which Co nanoparticles are the active sites for the dissociative adsorption of CO and the chain growth; while the Co2C species act as the active sites for associative adsorption of CO. In the present work, Fe-promoted Co/AC catalysts were prepared, characterized and evaluated for mixed higher alcohols together with fuels synthesis via F-T synthesis reaction. The effects of the iron content on the activity, selectivity and products distribution were systematic studied."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation AC was made from coconut shells. The material was washed with diluted hydrochloric acid followed by de-ionized water until pH=7.0, then was crushed into 40–60mesh. The AC supported monometallic cobalt catalyst was synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation according to the following procedure. The AC was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O at room temperature. After drying in air at 333K for 12h, the sample was calcined at 623K for 6h in the argon atmosphere. The catalyst was denoted as 15Co/AC. The 15Fe/AC catalyst was prepared by the same method and used as reference. The iron promoted cobalt catalysts were prepared via one step incipient wetness co-impregnation. The AC was impregnated with an aqueous solution mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O at room temperature. The processes of drying and calcination conducted under the same conditions as stated above. The catalysts were denoted as 15CoxFe/AC, where the loadings of Co and Fe were 15wt% and x wt% (based on the total weight of Co, Fe and AC, x=0.5, 1, 3 and 5)."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The textural structure of AC and corresponding calcined catalysts were evaluated by an Autosorb-1 instrument using nitrogen as adsorbate at 77K. 30mg of each calcined sample was degassed at 573K for 12h under vacuum prior to the measurement. The surface area (S BET) was calculated by the BET method. The total pore volume (Vtot) was obtained from the N2 amount adsorbed at a relative pressure close to unity. The ex-situ X-Ray diffraction (ex-situ XRD) phase analysis was performed with a PANalytical X’Pert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The XRD instrument was operated at 40kV and 40mA. The AC, calcined catalysts and spent catalysts were measured. The identification of the different phases was made using the JCPDS library. The in-situ X-Ray diffraction (in-situ XRD) tests were performed on the same instrument for ex-situ XRD using the Anton Paar XRK 900 reaction chamber. Two sets of experiments were conducted. Firstly, the phase transformation was monitored for the representative samples (15Co/AC, 15Fe/AC and 15Co5Fe/AC) during the temperature programmed reduction (5K/min, from room temperature to 783K) in a flow of H2. The data were collected from 2θ ranging from 20 to 70 . The patterns were collected with a temperature interval of 20K. Secondly, the XRD patterns were collected for the reduced samples. The calcined samples were in-situ reduced at 703K for 10h under a continuous H2 flow. The ramped temperature program (1K/min, hold on 703K for 10h) was the same as that for the reaction evalution. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out on a Zeton Altramira AMI-300 unit. Calcined sample (100mg) was firstly flushed with argon at 393K for 1h and then cooled down to 323K. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 1073K at a heating ramp rate of 10K/min under 10% H2/Ar mixture at 30ml/min. The hydrogen consumption was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Pulsed CO chemisorption experiments were carried out on a Zeton Altramira AMI-300 unit. 100mg of calcined sample was used for test. Prior to analysis, the sample was in-situ reduced by 10% H2/Ar at 703K for 4h, purged with He at the same temperature for 10min to remove adsorbed species from its surface and then cooled down to 323K. CO adsorption was carried out at 323K by means of pulse chemsorption with 10% CO/He until the TCD singal reached a constant value, signals of CO were detected by TCD. The dispersion degree was calculated by the formula below [42]. % Dispersion = 1.175 × ( μ mol/g CO ) ( % m e t a l × reduction percentage ) The morphology and crystalline nature of the used samples were studied by high-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM) using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin electron microscope, operating at 300kV."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test CO hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a stainless fixed-bed micro-reactor with an i.d. of 9mm. The calcined catalysts (1.3g), which were diluted by 3g of quartz to minimize the temperature gradients, were charged into the reactor. Prior to each reaction, the samples were in-situ reduced at 703K and 0.1MPa for 10h in a flow of H2. After the samples were cooled to 353K, the syngas (H2/CO=2, GHSV=4L-syngas/g-cat.·h, P=3.0MPa) was fed into the catalysts bed and the temperature was increased to 493K with 4h. The reaction effluent passed through two traps, one maintained at 373K for the collection of products with higher boiling point and the other at 298K for the collection of the rest of liquid products. The moment when the reactor reached the desired temperature was taken as the starting time. The data were all taken after 44h of reaction, when a stationary activity had been reached. The outlet gases were on-line analyzed by an Agilent 7890A GC with one packed column of Plot Q and TCD as detector. The liquid organic products and the aqueous products were off-line analyzed by an Agilent 7890A GC with HP-5 capillary columns and FID as a detector. The selectivity was calculated on carbon basis. The liquid organic products were also analyzed by GC–MS."
5,Results and discussion,"The structural parameters including surface area (S BET) and total pore volume (Vtot) of the calcined catalysts and original AC carrier are displayed in Table 1 . The S BET and Vtot for the initial AC is 1139m2 g−1 and 0.70cm3 g−1, respectively. The S BET and Vtot of 15CoxFe/AC samples were smaller than those of AC support, which indicated pore blockage due to cobalt and iron loading on AC [55,56]. No obvious changes in the pore structural parameters were observed when the Fe loadings were relatively low (<1wt%), but the S BET and Vtot slightly decreased with the further increasing of Fe loadings. The decreases in S BET and Vtot for 15Co3Fe/AC and 15Co5Fe/AC samples were mainly caused by pore blocking with large particles of Co-Fe alloy. The H2-TPR experiments were performed to investigate the effect of Fe doping on the reduction properties for AC supported cobalt catalysts, as shown in Fig. 1 . It was interesting to find that the TPR profiles of the iron promoted cobalt samples were similar to that of the 15Co/AC catalyst. This implied that the reduction performance of the iron promoted cobalt catalysts might behave similar to 15Co/AC catalyst. Three dominating H2 consumption peaks, located at 505–517, 619–633 and 766–782K, were detected for each catalyst. The former two peaks were ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 to Co through CoO intermediate [57,58]. It was found that the positions of the two peaks shifted to higher temperature with the increasing of the iron content. This observation suggested that the introduction of iron species inhibited the reduction of cobalt oxides, which is in accord with the previous reports [41,59]. The inhibiting effect resulted from the strong interaction between cobalt oxide species and iron oxide species. The last peak (766–782K) was assigned to the methanation of the surface functional groups of the AC support in the presence of metallic cobalt [50,60]. The position of this peak was also slightly shifted to higher temperature with the addition of iron. This effect had also been observed by A. Dalai using CNT support [38]. Besides, a small shoulder peak at about 443K was observed in Fig. 1. This peak belonged to the reductive decomposition of residual cobalt nitrate [61,62]. In addition to these common observations, a new H2 consumption shoulder peak (649–727K) was observed in the TPR profiles of the iron promoted catalysts with the iron content above 1wt%. This peak might be ascribed to the reduction of iron rich phase (i.e. iron oxides or the mixed oxides of cobalt and iron with iron dominated) [38,42]. The position of this new peak shifted to higher temperature with the increasing of iron content, indicating that the presence of cobalt promoted the reduction of iron oxide species. These results are in good agreement with those reports which used TiO2 or CNFs as support [41,42]. Furthermore, the reduction percentage was calculated based on the TPR profiles. The results are summaried in Table 2 . The crystalline structures of the cobalt and iron species in the calcined and reduced catalysts were assessed by ex-situ XRD and in-situ XRD, respectively. The XRD patterns of the calcined 15CoxFe/AC samples are shown in Fig. 2 . Two broad diffraction peaks, which were attributed to the AC support, appeared around 15–30 and 40–50 [63]. However, the two peaks were almost overshadowed by the peaks of cobalt oxide species and iron oxide species in the AC supported catalysts [38]. The peaks at 36.6, 42.5 and 61.5 ascribed to CoO species (PDF No. 01-074-2391) were detected for the calcined 15Co/AC catalyst. The position of diffraction peak for the spinel Co3O4 is about 36.8 (PDF No. 00-043-1003), which is adjacent to the peak at 36.6 for CoO. It means that the peak at 36.6 may partly come from the diffraction signal of Co3O4. The stepwise reduction of cobalt oxide species in the TPR profiles (Fig. 1) confirmed the statement. The appearance of CoO in calcined samples implied that Co3O4 species was partly reduced by AC support during the high temperature decomposition of the catalysts [47]. This phenomenon was also observed by Xie et al., who demonstrated that Mo species were reduced from Mo (VI) to Mo (IV) during the decomposition at high temperature using the activated carbon as the reducing agent [64]. The peaks (2θ=30.1, 35.4 and 62.2, PDF No. 00-001-1111) related to the Fe3O4 phase generated when the iron content increased up to 1wt%, and the intensities of the peaks increased with the increasing of iron content. The reason for the appearance of Fe3O4 rather than Fe2O3 in iron promoted catalysts is that the Fe2O3 species was partly reduced by AC during high temperature calcination [64]. However, cobalt-iron mixed oxides were not appeared in the 15CoxFe/AC samples. Compared with the unpromoted 15Co/AC catalyst, the diffraction peaks of CoO species of the 15CoxFe/AC samples became broader with the addition of iron, which suggested that the cobalt oxide particle size decreased with the Fe doping. XRD patterns of the fresh 15CoxFe/AC samples (in-situ reduced under H2 for 10h at 703K) are shown in Fig. 3 . The diffraction peaks at 44.1 and 51.1 were observed in the XRD pattern of 15Co/AC sample, which were assigned to metallic cobalt (fcc Co, PDF No. 00-001-1259). For the iron promoted cobalt samples, the diffraction peaks originated from fcc Co were also observed. In addition, the diffraction peaks at about 44.8 and 65.0 ascribed to the Co-Fe alloy (PDF No. 03-065-7519) were detected. Moreover, the intensities of the peaks assigned to metallic cobalt decreased and the intensities of the peaks attributed to Co-Fe alloy increased with the increasing of iron loadings. To access the reducibility of the catalysts and confirm the formation of the Co-Fe alloy during the reduction, in-situ XRD measurements were performed over the 15CoxFe/AC samples using an Anton Paar XRK 900 reaction chamber. Fig. 4 shows in-situ XRD patterns of 15Co/AC, 15Co5Fe/AC and 15Fe/AC samples under reduction as a function of temperature. For the 15Co/AC sample, CoO was the dominant phase in a H2 flow until 513K, and the intensities of the peaks for CoO slightly increased at 513K compared to those at room temperature, implying that the transformation of Co3O4 into CoO occurred. The observation is consistent with the H2-TPR measurement. The peak at 2θ=44.1 ascribed to fcc Co was observed at reduction temperature of 533K. This suggested that the reduction of CoO into metallic Co started at about 513–533K. With the further increasing of the reduction temperature, the diffraction peaks for CoO species weakened, whereas the peak for fcc Co strengthened. The peaks for CoO disappeared completely when the temperature was higher than 693K. For the 15Fe/AC sample (as a reference), Fe2O3 (2θ=24.1, 33.1, 35.6, 40.8, 49.4, 54.0, 57.5, 62.4 and 64.0, PDF No. 00-024-0072) was the primary species at low temperature (<513K). The reduction of Fe2O3 into Fe3O4 (2θ=30.0, 35.4, 37.1, 43.0, 53.5, 57.1 and 62.7, PDF No. 01-075-0033) started at around 513–533K. Furthermore, the conversion of Fe3O4 to Fe (2θ=44.4 and 64.5, PDF No. 01-085-1410) occurred at about 573–593K. In other words, the metallic iron phase could be obtained when the reduction temperature was higher than 593K. The in-situ XRD patterns of iron promoted cobalt sample (15Co5Fe/AC) during reduction is also shown in Fig. 4. It is clearly seen that the XRD patterns were different from those for monometallic samples. The Fe3O4 and CoO were predominant species in the sample at low temperature. The peaks at 44.8 and 65.0 attributed to Co-Fe alloy were observed when the temperature was increased to 573K. The intensities of the peaks increased with the continuous increasing of temperature. Besides, the peak positions from Co-Fe alloy slightly shifted to lower diffraction angles. The higher reduction temperature led to the higher content of metallic iron in the Co-Fe alloy. Then, the Co-Fe alloy rich in Fe resulted in the diffraction lines shifted to lower angles [65]. The in-situ XRD measurements illustrated that the cobalt promoted the reduction of iron oxide species whereas the iron inhibited the reduction of cobalt oxide species [59]. The phase analysis of the spent catalysts after reaction was revealed by ex-situ XRD. The XRD patterns are displayed in Fig. 5 . The characteristic diffraction angles for hydrocarbons at about 22 and 24 were detected [66]. It is observed that the crystalline structures of the metal species changed during the reaction. Besides the diffraction peaks assigned to metallic cobalt and Co-Fe alloys, the peak ascribed to Co2C species (42.5, PDF No. 01-072-1369) was observed in the XRD patterns. The intensity of the peak for metallic Co of the spent samples decreased in comparison with the fresh samples. The peaks for Co-Fe alloy slightly shifted to higher diffraction angles (e.g. 44.6 and 65.0 for fresh 15Co5Fe/AC sample, whereas 44.8 and 65.2 for the spent 15Co5Fe/AC sample). These results suggested that more cobalt took part in the lattice of the Co-Fe alloy. Thus, the Co2C formation and the development of the Co-Fe alloy during the reaction led to the decrease of the metallic cobalt active sites. It was also noticed that the addition of optimal amount of iron promoted the formation of Co2C, while excessive iron suppressed Co2C formation. Fig. 6 shows the HRTEM images of the spent catalysts. The lattice fringes of 2.25Å and 2.24Å as well as the angle of 90 between this two lattice fringes are the characteristic interlayer spacing of the Co2C (200) and Co2C (020) planes and their corresponding angle (Fig. 6e). Besides, the fcc Co (111) plane was detected in the image. Furthermore, the metallic cobalt and the cobalt carbide appeared in the HRTEM images of the other spent 15CoxFe/AC catalysts. These observations proved that the Co2C species were formed in iron promoted cobalt catalysts during the reaction in our experiments, which is consistent with the XRD analysis previously. CO uptakes, reduction percentage and metal dispersion degree of the iron promoted cobalt catalysts are presented in Table 2. The quantity of adsorbed CO increased from 81.5 to 87.0μmol CO/g-cat when 0.5wt% Fe was doped on the 15Co/AC catalyst, then it decreased when more iron was continuously introduced. Meanwhile, the reduction percentage decreased with the addition of iron. The metal dispersion of the 15Co0.5Fe/AC catalyst increased to 7.8% from 6.5% of the 15Co/AC catalyst,while the dispersion degree decreased once the iron content was above 1wt%. It was inferred that addition of Fe might promote the formation of Co-Fe alloy phase. The results of CO hydrogenation reactions over the 15CoxFe/AC catalysts are listed in Table 3 . Hydrocarbons, alcohols as well as minor content of CO2 were determined by GC and GC–MS. One of representative GC–MS spectrum for the liquid product is depicted in Fig. 7 . For instance, the GC signal at R.T.=22.0min was 1-decanol, which was confirmed by mass spectrometer. Whereas, the GC signal at R.T.=22.745min was tridecane. The other alcohols and hydrocarbons were certified by the same MS analysis. The conversion of CO and the product selectivity changed with the variety of Fe amount in the catalysts. The C1-C16 alcohols selectivity of the monometallic Co catalyst is approximately 17%. This observation differed from the results of reports [37,38,40], which showed the monometallic cobalt catalyst produced very few alcohols using either CNTs or inorganic oxides as carrier. Compared to the reports, the higher alcohols (C2-C16OH) synthesis mainly originated from the usage of the AC support in our studies. The AC promoted the formation of the Co2C, which is efficient for the alcohols production [14,25,26,54]. It was noticed that significant differences in CO conversion among the 15CoxFe/AC catalysts were observed, as shown in Table 3. The CO conversion increased with the addition of 0.5wt% Fe, but started to decline when Fe loading was higher than 1wt%. According to Table 2, appropriate amounts of Fe (0.5wt%) improved the metal dispersion and CO uptake, while a large amount of Fe loading led to the decrease of these values. Moreover, XRD results implied that the continuous addition of iron promoted the formation of Co-Fe alloy phase, thus leading to the severe iron surface enrichment discovered by other studies [41], which caused the decrease of the amount of metallic cobalt sites on the catalyst surface. It is well known that F-T synthesis is facilitated by high metal dispersion. Thus, the highest metal dispersion degree, CO uptake and moderate reduction percentage on 15Co0.5Fe/AC catalyst lead to the highest activity among all of these catalysts. From Table 3, it is observed that the product selectivity varied by the amount of the Fe loading. It is found that higher iron contents lead to higher selectivity toward HC1-4. This phenomenon was related to the catalytic properties of active species of iron and cobalt. Fe-based catalysts promote the formation of short chain hydrocarbons, such as C2-C5 hydrocarbons, whereas Co-based are selective to middle distillates and waxes [8]. It was worth emphasizing that the selectivity towards alcohols increased with the introduction of Fe. The alcohols selectivity was 17.5% over the 15Co/AC catalyst, while it increased to 20.2% when 0.5wt% Fe was dopped onto the15Co/AC catalyst. The highest yield of alcohols was observed on the 0.5wt% Fe dopped on the 15Co/AC sample. When Fe loading increased to 3wt%, the 15Co3Fe/AC catalyst showed the highest selectivity towards alcohols of 22.3%. The selectivity towards alcohols dropped slightly to 20.6% with the futher increasing of Fe loading of 5wt%. Based on the results of ex-situ XRD and HRTEM, the addition of Fe facilitated the formation of Co2C species. Both the metallic Co and Co2C were observed on the 15CoxFe/AC catalysts. We have recently reported that Co and Co2C dual active sites are responsible for high alcohols synthesis via F-T reaction [49]. Thus, the Fe doping on the 15Co/AC catalyst promoted the formation of Co2C, resulting in the enhancement of alcohols selectivity. On the other hand, the alcohols were produced over Co-Fe catalysts reported by few researchers, they suggested that the alcohols formation was related to the Co-Fe alloy [37,38,40]. As illustrated in the section of analysis for characterization, the Co-Fe alloy was formed in our catalyst system. Thus, the Co-Fe alloy species in the 15CoxFe/AC catalysts also favored synthesis of alcohols via CO hydrogenation. As a consequence, it was suggested that the alcohols synthesis over 15CoxFe/AC catalysts under our test conditions is the combined action of Co/Co2C and Co-Fe alloy species. Fig. 8 shows the alcohols distributions produced by CO hydrogenation over the 15CoxFe/AC catalysts. It can be seen that the fractions of methanol and C2-C5 alcohols increased, while that of C6-C16 alcohols decreased with the addition of Fe. It is well known that CO insertion into CnHm-M species before hydrogenation is required for synthesis of alcohols via CO hydrogenation [67]. In general, Fe-based catalysts give higher selectivity to short chain hydrocarbons than that of Co-based catalysts for F-T synthesis. It was supposed that existence of Fe favored CO hydrogenation to form more intermediate (CnHm-M, n≤4) species, which was then inserted by CO and subsequently hydrogenated to form alcohols (Cn+1H2n+3OH, n≤4). The above results of CO uptakes, TPR, and XRD demonstrated that the quantity of cobalt active sites on the surface dropped with Fe loading higher than 1wt%. The decrease of the cobalt sites led to the decline of formation rate of (CnHm-M, n≥5) species, thus resulting in the decrease of selectivity to alcohols (Cn+1H2n+3OH, n≥5). The distributions of the liquid phase products are also given in Fig. 8. The liquid phase products consisted of fuels (C5+ hydrocarbons) and alcohols. It can be seen that the fraction of alcohols was improved by the Fe doping on the 15Co/AC catalysts. When the Fe loading was 3wt%, the fraction of alcohols in liquid phase products was as high as 75%."
6,Conclusions,"The reaction results showed that mixed linear alcohols together with fuels can be directly synthesized from syngas over the 15CoxFe/AC catalysts. The catalytic performances were found to depend strongly on the composition of the catalysts. The metal dispersion of the 15CoxFe/AC catalysts increased with the appropriate amount of Fe addition, leading to the enhancement of catalytic activity. The Fe doping on the 15Co/AC catalyst promoted the formation of Co2C and Co-Fe alloy species, which were responsible for the improved selectivity of alcohols. The highest activity and yield of alcohols was obtained on the 0.5wt% Fe dopped 15Co/AC catalyst. In particular, the fraction of alcohols in the liquid phase products increased up to 75% when the Fe loading was 3wt%. It was inferred that the alcohols synthesis over 15CoxFe/AC catalysts is the combined action of Co/Co2C and Co-Fe alloy species."
