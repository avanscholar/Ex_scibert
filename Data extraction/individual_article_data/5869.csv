0,Introduction,"Longan fruit is one of the major produces in Thailand and is processed into a variety of products through drying, freezing, and canning to increase its shelf-life. Dried longan has the greatest production volume, but the lowest price per unit (Office of Agricultural Economics, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Thailand, 2019). Several studies have hence shown the development of new products from dried longan, including wine, which consumers prefer to fresh longan wine (Chanrittisen & Chomsri, 2010). However, previous studies on longan wine have focused on the fermentation of longan juice extracted solely from its pulp (Liu et al., 2018; Trinh, Woon, Yu, Curran, & Liu, 2010; Sanoppa, Huang, & Wu, 2019). As a result, the content of alkaloids and phenolics such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins in longan wine were lower than those in red wine (Liu et al., 2018). A study comparing the juice from whole longan, longan pulp, and longan pulp with seed for winemaking revealed that the specific growth rate and biomass of yeast were lower in the juice from pulp with seed. Moreover, the longan wine produced by incorporating its seeds was more acidic. Thus, either whole longan or longan pulp has been recommended as a raw material (Chomsri, Chanrittisen, Srisamatthakarn, Schmitz, & Jaokondee, 2003). Despite being less popularity compared to grape wine, the raw material of longan wine, especially its seed, is rich in phenolic antioxidants such as procyanidins, corilagin, epicatechin, gallic acid, ellagic acid, methyl gallate, and ethyl gallate (Huang, Cai, Corke, & Sun, 2010; Tang et al., 2019). Moreover, the longan seed consists of several phenolic acids including chebulagic acid, isomallotinic acid, geraniin, brevifolin, butanoic acid, caffeic acid, and flavogallonic acid (Chen et al., 2015). As a consequence, the health-promoting benefits of longan seed extract have been extensively elucidated (Park et al., 2010; Panyathep, Chewonarin, Taneyhill, Surh, & Vinitketkumnuen, 2013). The longan seeds showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, and antifungal activity against Candida spp and Cryptococcus neoformans (Rangkadilok et al., 2012; Tseng, Wu, Huang, & Wu, 2014). The seeds have also been reported to exhibit anti-angiogenesis activity in colon cancer and improve memory (Park et al., 2010; Panyathep, Chewonarin, Taneyhill, Surh, & Vinitketkumnuen, 2013). The previous study also reported the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of chlorogenic acid present in wines produced from blueberry, black chokeberry and sour cherry (Cakar et al., 2017). In this study, we focused on the profile of volatile organic compounds in longan wine. The presence of these volatile compounds and the interaction among them could be important factors affecting the antioxidant activities of the wine samples. Therefore, all the detected volatile compounds should be simultaneously taken into account in the investigation of antioxidant activities. Partial least square (PLS) regression was used for developing the calibration model. The variations from both predictive and response parameters are extracted and at the same time used for establishing the predictive model (Brereton, 2009). Partial least square (PLS) offered satisfactory predictive results in many applications (Cantu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Studies have also reported that the importance or significance of the predictive parameters in relation to the predicted responses can be evaluated by examining some PLS indicators such as PLS regression coefficients and PLS partial least squares-variable influence on projection (PLS-VIP) (Wongsaipun, Krongchai, Jakmunee, & Kittiwachana, 2018). Wine production is a process in which raw materials are extracted by ethanol during fermentation. By incorporating longan seed with the juice, we hypothesized that the antioxidant activities of longan wine would be improved. The objective of this study was, therefore, to optimize the fermentation of dried longan wine through choice of yeast strain, longan seed content, fermentation temperature, and initial soluble solids. Longan wine was also evaluated for the antioxidant activities and the composition of volatile compounds, which greatly affect the organoleptic properties of wine, and the relationship between these compounds was predicted. The data obtained can be useful for developing a new recipe and promoting the economic and nutritional values of longan wine."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw materials and chemicals,"2.1 Raw materials and chemicals Dried whole longan was obtained from a local farmer in Lamphun province, Thailand. All analytical grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Ajax FineChem (Taren Point, Australia). Five strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, namely Côte des Blancs, Montrachet, Premier Blanc, Premier Cuvée, and Premier Rouge, were obtained from Fermentis (Gent, Belgium) while other six yeast strains, namely 71B-1122, BM 4 × 4, EC-1118, ICV/D-47, K1-V1116, and QA23, were purchased from Lallemand (Montreal, Canada)."
3,Optimization of longan wine production,"2.2 Optimization of longan wine production 2.2.1 Yeast strain Longan juice was prepared by boiling 1 kg of dried longan pulp supplemented with 100% crushed seed in 5 L of drinking water for 5 min before filtering through a muslin cloth. Initial soluble solids and pH were determined using hand refractometer (N-1E, Atago, Tokyo, Japan) and pH meter (FEP20, Metler-Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) before adjusting to 20% and 5 using sucrose and citric acid, respectively. Diammonium phosphate and potassium metabisulfite were added at 0.05% and 0.02% to promote yeast propagation and inactivate the indigenous microorganisms, respectively. After 24 h of incubation at 15 °C, 1 g of lyophilized yeast was added into the longan juice and the fermentation temperature was maintained at 15 °C. In addition to pH and total soluble solids, the acidity was determined by titration with 0.1 M NaOH to an end point at pH 8.2 while the alcohol content was evaluated using ebulliometer (Dujardin-Salleron, Noizay, France). When the alcohol content reached 8%, the longan wine was separated from sediments and potassium metabisulfite was added at 0.02% to stop the fermentation. Wine was further clarified by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. Experiments were conducted in triplicate for each yeast strain. 2.2.2 Seed content Experiment was performed as mentioned above, except that the longan juice was supplemented with 0%, 25%, 50%, or 100% crushed seed. 2.2.3 Fermentation temperature Experiment was carried out as mentioned above, except that the fermentation temperature was maintained at 15 °C or 30 °C. 2.2.4 Initial soluble solids Experiment was conducted as mentioned above, except that the initial soluble solids were adjusted to 15%, 20%, or 25%."
4,Sensory analysis,"2.3 Sensory analysis Appearance, aroma, taste, and overall impression of the longan wine were evaluated on the five-point hedonic scale by 150 panelists for each experiment."
5,Analysis of antioxidant activities,"2.4 Analysis of antioxidant activities 2.4.1 ABTS radical cation decolorization (ABTS) ABTS of the longan wine was measured as previously described with slight modifications (Re et al., 1999). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Trolox was used as a standard at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mM. Antioxidant activity was obtained by fitting the decolorization activity of a sample on the standard curve of trolox and was presented as mM trolox equivalent (TE). 2.4.2 Ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) FRAP of the longan wine was evaluated as previously described with slight modifications (Benzie & Strain, 1996). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) was used as a standard at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mM. Antioxidant activity was obtained by fitting the absorbance of a sample on the standard curve of FeSO4 and was presented as mM FeSO4 equivalent (FE). 2.4.3 Total polyphenol content (TPC) TPC of the longan wine was quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay with slight modifications (Singleton, Orthofer, & Lamuela-Raventós, 1999). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Gallic acid was used as a standard at concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mM. TPC was obtained by fitting the absorbance of a sample on the standard curve of gallic acid and was presented as mM gallic acid equivalent (GE)."
6,Analysis of volatile compounds by GC-MS,"2.5 Analysis of volatile compounds by GC-MS An acid-base extraction was employed to extract phytochemicals from the longan wine samples. Longan wine samples (100 mL) were acidified to pH 5 by adding 0.1 M HCl before transferring the sample to a separation funnel containing dichloromethane. Then, the two layers were shaken and mixed, and the dichloromethane layer was collected after the solution reached equilibrium. Another 100 mL of the same longan wine sample was mixed with 1.0 M NaOH to reach a pH of 8 and extraction procedure was repeated. The two organic layers were combined and concentrated using vacuum rotary evaporation before analysis by GC-MS. The volatile components in the longan wine extracts were analyzed using a 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a 5973 mass spectrometer (MS) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The capillary column used was an HP-5 MS, (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane with a dimension of 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 μm film thickness. The temperature of the GC injector was set at 230 °C, and the flow rate of the helium carrier gas was 1.0 mL/min. The initial oven temperature was 45 °C, followed by a 3 °C/min temperature ramp up to 280 °C. The MS was operated in electron ionization (EI) mode at 70 eV. The GC transfer line, ion source, and quadrupole analyzer temperatures were set at 300, 230, and 150 °C, respectively. A mass range of m/z 30–550 was recorded in full scan mode. The volatile components were tentatively identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those of the W8N08 and Wiley 7 N mass spectral libraries (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, USA) and checked with standard compounds. Further, published Kováts indices were used to aid in structural confirmation of the identified compounds."
7,Chemometric analysis of volatile compounds,"2.6 Chemometric analysis of volatile compounds To establish the PLS model, intensities of the chromatographic peaks of the detected volatile compounds were used as the predictive parameters whereas the antioxidant activities in longan wine were used as responses. The optimum numbers of PCs of the PLS model were determined using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) (Brereton, 2009). Prior to the analysis, square root scaling was performed in order to reduce the influence of parameters with large values (Funsueb, Krongchai, Mahatheeranont, & Kittiwachana, 2016). After that, the data was mean centered so that the analysis focused upon the variance from the data mean."
8,Statistical analysis,2.7 Statistical analysis Antioxidant activities of the longan wine were reported as mean ± standard error (SE) and tested for statistical difference at 95% confidence by Analysis of Variance in General Linear Model (GLM) followed by Tukey B test (SPSS Statistics 17.0).
9,Results and discussion,
10,Antioxidant activities,"3.1 Antioxidant activities S. cerevisiae strain 71B-1122, BM4 × 4, and Premier Blanc produced longan wine with the highest ABTS, FRAP, and TPC, respectively (Table 1 ). The previous study reported a TPC of 0.781 mg GE/mL in longan wine produced from fresh pulp without seeds, which was lower than a range of 1.207–4.263 mg GE/mL in red wine (Liu et al., 2018). In the current study, TPC of longan wine made from pulp and seeds was equivalent or higher than that in red wine, indicating the beneficial effect of seed inclusion. Increase of TPC after including the fruit pits was also observed in wines produced from peach, apricot, plum, and sweet cherry (Čakar et al., 2019). Noteworthily, FRAP was proportional to TPC, suggesting that the latter might be responsible for this antioxidant activity as previously reported (Liu et al., 2014). In contrast, ABTS was inversely proportional to TPC, implying that other compounds in longan pulp, such as amino acids and polysaccharides, could be involved in this antioxidant activity (Zhang, Guo, Ho, & Bai, 2020). Strain EC-1118 was selected for further studies based on the optimum levels of acid and alcohol in the final wine product (Table 1) with moderate antioxidant activities. Similarly, this strain was preferred over other yeast species/strains for the fermentation of longan wine due to its faster growth (Chomsri, Chanrittisen, Srisamatthakarn, Schmitz, & Jaokondee, 2003; Trinh, Woon, Yu, Curran, & Liu, 2010), although it was reported to produce high levels of acetic acid and pyruvic acid (Chidi, Rossouw, Buica, & Bauer, 2015). Increase in the seed content of longan juice resulted in higher antioxidant activities (Table 1) because longan seeds consist of strong antioxidants with 82.4 mmol trolox/100 g DW and 6.3 g gallic acid/100 g DW (Huang, Cai, Corke, & Sun, 2010). The results were consistent with those of the ABTS assay of longan pulp and seed, which yielded 14.8 and 692 μmol ascorbic acid/g DW, respectively (Soong & Barlow, 2004). Recent research also reported that pulp and seeds of Chinese longan showed a TPC of 0.08 and 3.77 mg gallic acid/g, respectively (Tang et al., 2019). Moreover, FRAP of longan pulp and seed was 41.5 and 1388 μmol FeSO4/g DW, respectively while a TPC was reported to be 1.6 and 62.6 mg gallic acid/g DW, respectively (Soong & Barlow, 2004). Due to the preferable sensory attributes (Table 1) and moderate antioxidant activities, 50% longan seed was selected for preparation of longan juice. However, a previous study recommended against using longan seeds for winemaking since it reduced the growth rate and cell biomass of yeast but promoted the acid production (Chomsri, Chanrittisen, Srisamatthakarn, Schmitz, & Jaokondee, 2003). Fermentation temperature affects yeast metabolism which requires more nitrogen to compensate for the rapid growth at higher temperature (Beltran, Rozes, Mas, & Guillamon, 2007). In general, fermentation of white and red wine is recommended at 15 °C and 30 °C, respectively (Sablayrolles, 2009). Fermentation of longan wine resulted in a higher FRAP at 30 °C than at 15 °C (Table 1). It is likely that the extraction of polyphenols was increased at high temperature, as observed during the production of red wine (Sacchi, Bisson, & Adams, 2005), thus promoting the antioxidant activity in wine. A similar result was obtained when the high temperature increased the antioxidant extraction due to the softening of plant tissues and the weakening of the interaction between polyphenols and proteins/polysaccharides. As a result, more polyphenols could dissolve in the aqueous ethanol solution as found during extraction of polyphenols from grape seed meal (Shi et al., 2003). Additionally, the ethanolic extracts of mango seed kernel showed that ABTS and FRAP were raised to the maximum after heating due to the generation and accumulation of Maillard-related products (Soong & Barlow, 2004). Therefore, fermentation of longan wine was recommended at an optimal temperature of 30 °C. Initial soluble solids used might influence the yeast metabolism since sugar is considered as the main energy source that can be transformed into various metabolites such as alcohols, organic acids, amino acids. Although a higher initial soluble solid content of longan juice resulted in a higher TPC, it did not affect ABTS and FRAP of longan wine (Table 1). Sucrose, presented as initial soluble solids in this study, might interact with polyphenols via a hydrogen bond, decrease oxygen solubility, scavenge reactive oxygen species, and chelate transition metal ions (Shpigelman, Zisapel, Cohen, & Livney, 2013; Loncaric, Dugalic, Mihaljevic, Jakobek, & Pilizota, 2014), thus stabilizing these compounds in the longan wine. Furthermore, the higher TPC when adding sugar could be resulted from the higher content of alcohol that promoted the extraction of phenolic compounds as observed in wines produced from black chokeberry, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, and sour cherry (Čakar et al., 2018). With the acceptable sensory characteristics (Table 1), 20% initial soluble solids was selected for optimal preparation of longan juice."
11,Volatile compounds,"3.2 Volatile compounds The major volatile compounds in longan wine produced under the optimal conditions included phenethyl alcohol, 2,3-butylene glycol, ethyl hydrogen succinate, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde, and 4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol (Table 2–5 ). Phenethyl alcohol presented a favorable red rose odor and was an antimicrobial agent. It is synthesized from phenylalanine via the Ehrlich pathway (Etschmann et al., 2008). 2,3-Butylene glycol was produced through acetoin reduction and presented a butter and cream aroma, although higher levels of butylene glycol might be considered as an off-flavor in alcoholic beverages (Romano & Suzzi, 1993). Both phenethyl alcohol and 2,3-butylene glycol are produced by an alternative pathway to regenerate NAD+, thus reducing the ethanol concentration. Ethyl hydrogen succinate is an ester of ethanol and succinic acid which was one of the major organic acids produced by the strain EC-1118 (Chidi, Rossouw, Buica, & Bauer, 2015). Moreover, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde was formed during the heat treatment of sugar, which might have occurred during the drying or extraction processes of longan pulp for juice production. 4-Hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, an antioxidant, was derived from phenethyl alcohol. The results were inconsistent with a previous study that identified ethanol, ethyl acetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate in longan wine (Trinh, Woon, Yu, Curran, & Liu, 2010). Moreover, ethyl lactate, ethyl octanoate, isoamyl alcohol and ethyl decanoate were present as the major volatile compounds in longan wine (Liu et al., 2018). Another study also reported that ethanol, isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, 2-phenylethanol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl decanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl acetate were the main volatile compounds in longan wine fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii (Sanoppa, Huang, & Wu, 2019). The variations could be caused by the differences in raw materials used since most of the previous studies produced longan wine from fresh pulp without incorporating the seeds. As a result, yeast was not restricted by phenolic compounds in seeds and could ferment sugar using a typical pathway. In the current study, 2,3-butylene glycol, isoamyl acetate, 2-(2-methylidenecyclopropyl)ethanol, and ethyl-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoate were increased in longan wine produced from a higher seed content. However, when the longan juice was supplemented with l-phenylalanine, 2-phenylethyl alcohol and its acetate ester were significantly high but contents of other acetate esters such as isoamyl acetate, hexyl acetate, and ethyl acetate were reduced (Trinh, Woon, Yu, Curran, & Liu, 2010). This evidence also suggests the influence of raw materials on the volatile profiles of longan wine. Other aroma compounds in longan wine that were derived from amino acid metabolism were isoamyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, amyl acetate, benzaldehyde, benzyl acetaldehyde, phenylacetic acid, and phenyl propanoate (Trinh, Woon, Yu, Curran, & Liu, 2010). Volatile compounds in longan wine were classified into four groups according to their odor characteristics, which were sweet, floral, fruity, and chemical aroma (Sanoppa, Huang, & Wu, 2019). Acetate esters of higher alcohols, such as ethyl acetate, hexyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenylethyl acetate, showed floral and fruity aroma while ethyl esters of fatty acids conferred honey odor. However, higher alcohols had a positive effect at a lower concentration but a negative impact at a higher concentration. In addition, ethyl 2-butanoate, ethyl 3-hydroxy butanoate, linalool, benzaldehyde, ethyl decanoate, and squalene were naturally present in longan pulp and juice (Trinh, Woon, Yu, Curran, & Liu, 2010; Zhang, Guo, Ho, & Bai, 2020). In this study, the aroma of longan wine could be considered as a mixture of floral and fruity due to the dominance of phenethyl alcohol. However, there was little variation in the major aroma compounds among different batches of longan wine. Thus, it could be concluded that the volatile profile was mainly influenced by the yeast metabolism as well as the raw materials, namely longan and sugar. Phenethyl alcohol was present as a dominant volatile compound in longan wine fermented by all yeast strains, as shown in Table 2. Thus, it could be deduced that amino acids served as an alternative energy source during the fermentation of longan juice prepared from the pulp and seed. Moreover, strains that released a high level of 2,3-butylene glycol, such as Côte des Blancs, might produce organic acids at a greater extent since this metabolite could neutralize the acidic conditions produced during sugar metabolism (Ji, Huang, & Ouyang, 2011). Some strains including K1-V1116 preferred producing succinate to balance the toxicity of ethanol. As a result, an ester of both metabolites, ethyl hydrogen succinate, was formed and became one of the major volatile compounds in longan wine. Furthermore, the effect of longan seed on yeast metabolism was obvious in this study due to the observed shift from Ehrlich pathway to acetoin reduction with an increased seed content in the longan juice, suggesting the restrictive growth of yeast due to the lack of amino acids. As a result, production of phenethyl alcohol was lower but that of 2,3-butylene glycol was higher in longan wine produced from a higher seed content, as shown in Table 3. As mentioned above, the volatile profile of longan wine was dominated by similar compounds, which were independent of the winemaking conditions. However, previous studies have revealed that lower fermentation temperature can increase the production of ester, acetate, and medium-chain fatty acids (Torija et al., 2003) while higher fermentation temperature can promote the synthesis of thiol compounds (Howell et al., 2004). The different trend observed in this study (Table 4) might be caused by longan polyphenols present in the juice that significantly limited the yeast metabolism at all fermentation temperatures. In addition, the acetoin reduction was promoted after more sugar was added into the longan juice as shown by the high production of 2,3-butylene glycol in Table 5. This result could be derived from the extensive production of organic acids during sugar metabolism, due to which acetoin level was raised to neutralize the acidic condition and later used as an alternative energy source during the stationary phase of yeast (Ji, Huang, & Ouyang, 2011)."
12,Relationship between volatile compounds and antioxidant activities,"3.3 Relationship between volatile compounds and antioxidant activities Fig. 1 shows a score plot of the first two PCs of the chromatographic intensities of the detected aroma compounds, representing 93.81% of the total variation. The samples were labeled according to the conditions that were used to produce the wine. The difference between the wine samples produced using different experimental conditions could be observed. For example, the samples labeled “sugar” in Fig. 1(A) tended to localize on the left part of the PCA space with relatively lower PC2 scores. The samples labeled “yeast” and “seed” appeared to be overlapped on the upper part of the space, implying high similarity. The rationale could be that these two conditions were consecutively studied, so the quality of dried longan raw material was mostly similar. Based on the chromatographic and the antioxidant content data, PLS models were established. The correlation graphs between the observed and predicted antioxidant coefficient values are shown in Fig. 1(B), (D) and (F), respectively, for the ABTS, FRAP and TPC. In all cases, the R2 values were greater than the Q2 values as expected since the predictive errors using the test mode should be slightly higher than the models used to examine the training samples in auto-predictive mode. The R2 values for the prediction of FRAP were relatively lower than the others because this method relied on electron transfer as the antioxidant mechanism but a few volatile compounds in the longan wine were reducing agents. Instead, most volatile compounds consisted of several hydrogen atoms, which are likely donated to the free radicals such as the ABTS radical cation. The PLS-VIP plots for each parameter are shown in Fig. 1(C), (E) and (G). It is necessary to note that the PLS-VIP implies the importance of the parameters with respect to the prediction of the antioxidant data. The size of VIP parameters can be used to determine how much the variables are significant or influential on the prediction model. The greater the size is, the more important it is likely to be associated with the antioxidant content. Based on the PLS-VIP, parameters No. 2, 23, 27, 28 and 34 were identified to have a strong influencer on the model prediction of ABTS, FRAP, and TPC. These compounds were 2,3-butylene glycol, phenethyl alcohol, ethyl hydrogen succinate, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde and 4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, respectively."
13,Conclusions,"In this study, the optimal conditions for production of longan wine with high antioxidant activities were as follows: 50% seed content, 20% initial soluble solids, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EC-1118, and a fermentation temperature of 30 °C. According to PLS modelling, the major volatile compounds found in the longan wine, namely phenethyl alcohol, 2,3-butylene glycol, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde, ethyl hydrogen succinate, and 4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, could greatly enhance the antioxidant activities as determined by ABTS, FRAP, and TPC analyses."
