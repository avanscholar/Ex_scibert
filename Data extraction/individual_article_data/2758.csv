0,Introduction,"Enterobacter aerogenes, a facultative anaerobic bacterium, has high potential for the production of hydrogen, which is an environmentally friendly energy carrier that may find widespread use in the future [1]. The production of hydrogen by E. aerogenes is highly dependent on NADH and NAD+, and thus engineering the metabolic reactions mediated by these cofactors would have to be a key feature in any development of an enhanced hydrogen production process. Since the unique NADH pathway in E. aerogenes is reportedly responsible for hydrogen production, elucidating how NADH affects hydrogen evolution in the complicated metabolic network inside the cells is critical for improving the hydrogen yield [2]. The NADH-dependent hydrogenase responsible for hydrogen production in this bacterium is reportedly a putative membrane-bound protein [3], but little has been discovered about the enzyme itself, the reaction mechanism, or its related genes. Moreover, increasing evidence has indicated that the levels of NADH and NAD+ are not only involved in the regulation of numerous intracellular NADH- and NAD+-dependent enzymes, but can also change the metabolic flux [4]. Since cofactors play an essential role in a large number of biochemical reactions in cells, their manipulation can result in their potential use as tools to achieve the desired metabolic engineering goals. Berrios-Rivera et al. have proposed the concept of “cofactor engineering”, which integrates dynamics and the overall control structure of cofactors on metabolism to achieve the desired goal of metabolic regulation [5–8]. For example, Escherichia coli capable of overexpressing an NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii has been constructed; this FDH can generate higher NADH yields and NADH/NAD+ ratios inside the cells, and consequently reduce the intracellular environment [7]. In addition, Berrios-Rivera et al. have also shown that this NAD+ cofactor manipulation system can be used to improve the production of ethanol and 1,2-propanediol [6]. “Cofactor engineering” is an effective tool for changing the availability of NADH or NAD+ inside cells, but genetic engineering tools are always employed for this purpose. It is therefore difficult to reach the desired goals because of the complexity of the distribution of the cofactors inside the cells, especially with strains for which little genetic information is available. A promising alternative approach is to regulate the internal cofactor status and the metabolic flux by an extracellular control strategy, which may involve altering the redox state of carbon sources, controlling the oxidoreduction potential (ORP), adding additional electron donors or acceptors, and the like. Nakashimada et al. have studied the hydrogen production process of E. aerogenes by changing the degree of reduction of the substrates (C ave) [3]. H2 yields were found to increase linearly with C ave, indicating that the extracellular redox state of the substrates directly affects H2 production by E. aerogenes. Studies on E. coli have also led to the same conclusion that substrates with different oxidation states can yield specific product profiles [9,10]. Fermentation of the wild strain of E. coli K-12 at different ORP levels has shown that at a low ORP level (−100mV), formate, acetate, ethanol, and lactate were produced in molar proportions of approximately 2.5:1:1:0.3, while under highly reducing conditions (−320mV), these four metabolites were produced in molar proportions of 2:0.6:1:2 [4]. Moreover, ORP has been used as a controlling factor to regulate 1,3-propanediol production by the fermentation of Klebsiella pneumoniae under anaerobic conditions [11]. Electrically reduced neutral red added as an electron donor during the growth of Actinobacillus succinogenes in an electrochemical bioreactor has been reported to enhance glucose consumption, bacterial growth, and succinate production by about 20%, while decreasing acetate production by about 50% [12]. The exogenous oxidation of NADH by 2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (ACNQ)/Fe(CN)6 3− has also been reported to result in a remarkable increase in pyruvate production and a decrease in lactate production by bifidobacteria cells [13]. The above examples highlight the possibilities of an extracellular control approach in altering intracellular oxidoreduction reactions inside cells. Compared to altering the NADH (NAD+) status by genetic modification, extracellular control is more convenient and easily affects the metabolic networks. Although many extracellular control methods have been used, to the best of our knowledge there has not hitherto been any study on the use of extracellular NADH or NAD+ to control the intracellular metabolism of bacterial cultivations. Furthermore, from a biotechnological point of view, if NADH or NAD+ outside of bacterial cells can modify the intracellular metabolic fluxes, their use should offer a promising approach for the control of bioprocesses because a series of cofactor regeneration systems has been proposed [14,15], and these systems can be used as inexpensive whole-cell suppliers of NADH or NAD+ outside of the target cells. In the present work, we have examined the effects of external NADH and NAD+ on the regulation of hydrogen production by E. aerogenes in resting cells, batch cultures, and chemostat cultures. The metabolic change in chemostat cultivation upon the addition of external NADH (NAD+) has been studied, and the reason for the change in the hydrogen generation pathway has been explored. Finally, a possible mechanism that rationalizes the influences of external NADH (NAD+) on the metabolism of E. aerogenes is discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bacterial strains and media,"2.1 Bacterial strains and media E. aerogenes IAM 1183 purchased from the Institute of Applied Microbiology of the University of Tokyo, Japan, was used in the present study. Glucose medium (per liter: 15g glucose, 5g tryptone, 14g K2HPO4, 6g KH2PO4, 2g (NH4)2SO4, and 0.2g MgSO4·7H2O) was used for the bacterial cultivation."
3,Effects of external NADH on hydrogen production by E. aerogenes resting cells,"2.2 Effects of external NADH on hydrogen production by E. aerogenes resting cells E. aerogenes cells were collected according to the following procedure: after 12h of anaerobic batch cultivation, 50mL of culture broth was centrifuged (10,200× g for 5min at 4°C) and the cells were collected and resuspended in buffer A (50mM triethanolamine (TEA) buffer, pH 6.80, 5mM dithiothreitol). This procedure was repeated three times to wash the cells, and finally they were resuspended in buffer A and the optical density at 600nm (OD600) was adjusted to 0.8–1.0. Fifty milliliters of this resuspended cell solution was added to a 60mL anaerobic bottle. After 10mg of NADH had been added (no addition of NADH was used as a control), the reaction mixture was degassed to achieve anaerobic conditions (purging with nitrogen for 15min) and then incubated for 8h at 37°C and 170rpm. The H2 produced was measured every 2h."
4,Batch cultivation,"2.3 Batch cultivation A 50mL anaerobic bottle containing 20mL of glucose medium was first degassed to anaerobic conditions (purging with nitrogen gas prior to tubing, head-gas replacement, and then autoclaving), and was subsequently inoculated with a 1-d seeding culture at an inoculum size of 2.4% (v/v). Batch cultivation was carried out on a reciprocal shaker at 150rpm and 37°C for 12h."
5,Chemostat cultivation,"2.4 Chemostat cultivation Anaerobic chemostat cultivation was performed using the equipment shown in Fig. 1 . The volume of the bioreactor was 400mL, with a working volume of 200mL. The medium was previously degassed to anaerobic conditions (purging with nitrogen gas prior to tubing, head-gas replacement, and then autoclaving). After inoculation with seeding E. aerogenes at an inoculum size of 2%, the bioreactor was run in batch mode for 10h to grow the cells, and was then switched to the continuous culture mode until the chemostat state was reached. The gas evolved was collected in a gas collector (cylinder) as shown in Fig. 1, which was filled with saturated NaCl solution. Following preliminary cultivation experiments at different dilution rates, the dilution rate was chosen as 0.32/h for all of the experiments described in this paper. Under the anaerobic conditions, the continuous culture reached a steady state after five or six residence times. The temperature and agitation speed were maintained at 37°C and 150rpm, respectively. Once the continuous culture reached the steady state, NADH (NAD+) was added to the inlet culture broth at a concentration of 0.7mM. The change in metabolic flux was detected in the ensuing 4h following this addition of NADH (NAD+)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods The amount of gas produced was measured with a measuring cylinder as shown in Fig. 1. OD600 was measured with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1206, Japan) to measure the cell concentration on a dry cell weight basis. 2.5.1 Glucose concentration One milliliter of dinitrosalicylic acid solution was added to 1mL of the sample solution. The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 5min, and then 4mL of water was added. The absorbance of the sample was measured at 510nm. 2.5.2 Gas components The components of the gas evolved were analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC8A, Japan), equipped with a Parapak Q column (80–100 meshes) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), with N2 as the carrier gas. The working temperatures of the column and the TCD were 80°C and 120°C, respectively. 2.5.3 Metabolites A 10mL sample drawn from the chemostat cultures was centrifuged (10,200× g for 5min at 4°C), and the supernatant was frozen at −20°C until the analysis. Pyruvate, acetate, ethanol, succinate, formate, lactate, and 2,3-butanediol were determined at 40°C on a high-pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC-10A, Shimadzu) equipped with an SCR-102G organic acid analysis column (Shimadzu) and an RID-10A detector (Shimadzu). The mobile phase was 0.1% aqueous perchloric acid solution."
7,Assay of NADH and NAD+ [4],"2.6 Assay of NADH and NAD+ [4] 2.6.1 Pre-treatment Aliquots of 5mL were withdrawn from the chemostat cultures after a steady state had been attained, and the tubes were immediately immersed in an ice bath. For the assay of NAD+, a variable volume of HCl (6N) was added to yield a final pH of 1.2, and the HCl-treated sample was subsequently incubated at 50°C for 10min prior to neutralization with KOH to a pH of 6.5–7 with vigorous agitation. For the assay of NADH, a variable volume of KOH (10N) was added to yield a final pH of 12.5, and the KOH-treated culture (pH 12.5) was subsequently incubated for 10min at room temperature (25°C). The NADH (NAD+) concentrations of the treated samples were measured within 24h. 2.6.2 Measurements NADH (NAD+) was measured by coupling the appropriate enzyme assays with fluorimetric determination of the coenzyme NADH [4]. Emission was measured at 460nm after excitation at 350nm with a fluorescence spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi F-2500, Japan). NAD+ was assayed in a reaction mixture containing pyrophosphate buffer (50mM, pH 8.8), semicarbazide (2.5g/L), absolute ethanol (80mM), acid extract, and alcohol dehydrogenase (0.5U/mL). Furthermore, NADH was assayed in a reaction mixture containing triethanolamine buffer (200mM, pH 7), pyruvate (5mM), alkaline extract, and LDH (20U/mL). The error in the assays of NADH and NAD+ was less than 6%."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effects of external NADH on hydrogen production by E. aerogenes resting cells,"3.1 Effects of external NADH on hydrogen production by E. aerogenes resting cells E. aerogenes cells were suspended in TEA buffer, and a trace amount of glucose was used as the sole carbon source to produce hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 2 , glucose could be used to produce hydrogen in the resting cell system, and with the addition of NADH, hydrogen production by E. aerogenes was enhanced accordingly. After a period of 8h, 0.6mM more hydrogen was produced with the addition of NADH compared with the control. The increase in the amount of hydrogen (0.6mM) was much higher than that with added NADH (0.014mM). This result indicated that external NADH affected the hydrogen production by the cells."
10,Batch cultivation,"3.2 Batch cultivation NADH in various concentrations in the range 0.5–5mM was initially added to the culture medium to study its effects on the amount of hydrogen produced and the cell concentration during the batch cultivation of E. aerogenes. As shown in Fig. 3 , after 12h of cultivation, external NADH of the appropriate concentration enhanced hydrogen production and cell concentration, giving optimal results at a concentration of 0.7mM. Much higher concentrations, such as 5mM, were found to inhibit hydrogen production and cell growth. With the addition of 0.7mM NADH, the yield of hydrogen from glucose increased from 0.82 to 1.10mol H2/mol glucose. Also, hydrogen production increased from 10.3 to 13.5mL/OD, indicating that the external NADH increased the hydrogen production capability of E. aerogenes. Tanisho et al. were the first to report that the NADH pathway plays an important role in hydrogen production by E. aerogenes [1,2]. If all of the added NADH were used in the NADH pathway, an additional 0.7mM of hydrogen (0.17mL in the present system) would be produced. However, the actual increase in the amount of hydrogen produced was 3mL (Fig. 3), which was much larger than the presumed value. This result was identical to that obtained for the resting cells. Thus, in both the resting cells system and the batch cultivation mode, external NADH is not only used by the NADH pathway to produce hydrogen, but also affects the intracellular metabolism of E. aerogenes. In fact, with the addition of NADH, the concentrations of the final metabolites were changed (data not shown)."
11,Chemostat cultivation,"3.3 Chemostat cultivation To obtain a better understanding of the effect of externally added NADH (NAD+) on the intracellular metabolism with emphasis on H2 production, a further experiment on anaerobic chemostat cultivation was designed. At a dilution rate of 0.32/h, continuous culture was initiated after a 12h batch cultivation, and a steady state was attained after 24h of cultivation, whereupon the OD600, pH, and glucose concentration were 1.752, 5.80, and 11.2g/L, respectively. At the steady state, the hydrogen productivity reached 46mL/h (data not shown). Once the system reached the steady state, NADH or NAD+ was added to the inlet culture broth. Since NADH and NAD+ were unstable in the inlet culture broth, it was difficult to study the performance of the system in the new stable state that was reached after the addition of the target cofactor. Thus, the metabolic shift during the ensuing 4h following the addition of the cofactors was studied continuously. Cultivation without the addition of the cofactors was used as a control. The metabolic flux of E. aerogenes was adapted from that reported in the literature [16] and is shown in Fig. 4 . Considering the hydrogen formation pathway, the anaerobic fermentation products of E. aerogenes were pyruvate, succinate, lactate, 2,3-butanediol, acetate, ethanol, CO2, and H2. The addition of NADH or NAD+ obviously modified the fermentation spectrum (Table 1 ). These data obtained for the continuous culture imply that the presence of extracellular NADH (NAD+) affected the metabolic fluxes. In particular, the hydrogen yield decreased from 1.42 to 1.10mol H2/mol glucose upon the addition of NADH. However, upon the addition of NAD+, the hydrogen yield interestingly increased from 1.41 to 1.52mol H2/mol glucose. In previous studies, it has been found that the hydrogen production pathway in E. aerogenes comprises two routes [1,2]: production from formate and conversion from excess NADH. Based on the concentrations of the metabolic products shown in Table 1, the amount of hydrogen produced via the formate and NADH pathways was calculated. As shown in Table 2 , the sum total of hydrogen produced by both pathways corresponded almost exactly to the detected values. With the addition of NADH, hydrogen produced via the formate pathway was increased, while that produced via the NADH pathway was decreased. The net result of these two effects was that hydrogen production by E. aerogenes was decreased after the addition of external NADH. The effect of external NAD+ was opposite to that of NADH. To further illustrate the intracellular metabolism change in depth, Table 3 lists the parameters reflecting the intracellular metabolic state of the cells. The oxidation state inside the cells was less than zero, indicating the presence of excess reducing power, which corresponded exactly to the hydrogen production in this system. With the addition of NADH, the oxidation state, ATP yield, and Ac/Et ratio gradually increased. However, overall, NAD+ addition gave the opposite results as compared to NADH addition. These three parameters indicated the increase in the oxidation equivalent in the cells, which could explain why the excess NADH (NADH pathway) was reduced after NADH was added. For the change in intracellular NADH (NAD+) (Table 3), external NADH addition had a slight effect on the internal NAD+, but this increased the intracellular NADH and the overall NADH/NAD+ ratio. In contrast, the addition of NAD+ led to the opposite effects. A change in the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio would influence various metabolic reactions. From the viewpoint of reaction engineering, a higher NADH/NAD+ ratio benefits the reactions that use NADH as the cofactor, while a lower NADH/NAD+ ratio benefits the reactions that use NAD+ as the cofactor. Thus, upon the addition of NADH, the route for ethanol production was enhanced. Considering the increase in the Ac/Et ratio, the sum of ethanol and acetate was increased. As the sum of ethanol and acetate was equal to that of formate and hydrogen, ignoring the influence of unused formate (which was very small), hydrogen production via the formate pathway was enhanced. To understand how the external cofactor can affect the intracellular metabolism of E. aerogenes, the change in the extracellular NADH (NAD+) was measured. As shown in Fig. 5 , upon the addition of NADH, the concentration of extracellular NADH and NAD+ in the culture broth gradually increased, and 24% of the added NADH was transformed to NAD+ after 4h. As the cofactor was introduced into the inlet of the bioreactor, with the continuous addition of fresh medium, the NADH concentration increased. Of interest here is the increase in NAD+, which indicated the oxidation of NADH outside of the cell. Meanwhile, with the addition of NAD+, 4% of the input NAD+ was found to be transformed to NADH. Nakashimada et al. have observed NAD(P)H-dependent hydrogen formation in the cell-free extract of E. aerogenes AY-2, and hydrogenase activity was found in the cell membrane and not in the cytoplasmic fraction [3], implying the direct conversion of NADH to NAD+ and H2 by a membrane-bound hydrogenase. Thus, the membrane-bound hydrogenase would seem to play a central role in transforming external NADH (NAD+). The occurrence of such an oxidoreduction reaction on the cell membrane resulted in an electron flow across the membrane, and ultimately changed the oxidation state and metabolic pattern of the cell."
12,Conclusions,"The present study has shown that the addition of external NADH or NAD+ can regulate hydrogen production by E. aerogenes in resting cells, batch cultures, and chemostat cultures. In particular, in chemostat cultivation, the addition of NADH led to a decrease in hydrogen production via the NADH pathway and an increase in that via the formate pathway, with the net overall effect being a decrease in production. On the other hand, NAD+ addition gave the opposite results. The membrane-bound hydrogenase probably played a central role in this regulation. The occurrence of NADH oxidation (NAD+ reduction) on the cell membrane resulted in an electron flow across the membrane, ultimately changing the oxidation state and metabolic pattern of the cell."
