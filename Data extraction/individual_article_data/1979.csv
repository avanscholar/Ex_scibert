0,Introduction,"Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been an attractive route to produce value-added chemicals and fuels [1–3]. Since the initial research by Hori et al. [4], various metal cathodes have been explored as catalysts for the CO2RR [5]. However, bulk metal materials often suffer from the sluggish kinetics, high overpotential and low selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte [6,7]. Recently, numerous metal nanomaterials with improved CO2RR performance have been developed and typical strategies for regulating the activity and selectivity include tuning the particle size [8,9], shape [10,11] or structure [12,13] and alloying with a second metal [14,15]. Alternatively, the surface modification on metal nanoparticles (NPs) in virtue of ligands has become the novel approach to tune the activity and selectivity of CO2RR on metals [16–18]. This strategy could manipulate the electronic and geometric structures of metal surface or render favorable local microenvironment of catalytic sites for promoting the adsorption and activation of CO2 or stabilizing key reaction intermediates (*COOH for CO production). For example, Au NPs, modified with a tetradentate porphyrin ligand, exhibit a strikingly enhanced activity and selectivity for the CO2RR. Theoretical calculation predicts that the formation of intermediate *COOH is more favorable on the porphyrin-ligated Au surface than on the pure Au surface [18]. Apart from ligands modification, commonly used surfactants or polymers could also be introduced as modifiers to promote certain reactions on metal NPs [19,20]. Surfactants and polymers are often used as capping agents for the synthesis of metal NPs with well-defined size and shape [21,22]. Traditionally, the presence of residual capping agents is always considered to have an adverse impact on the catalytic performance, mainly due to the hindered access of reactants to catalyst surface [23]. Consequently, much effort has been paid to remove the residual capping agents on the surface of metal NPs [24,25]. Nevertheless, the real role of capping agent is usually neglected and rarely explored. From an unprejudiced viewpoint, the residual capping agents could be utilized as modifiers if they act on improving the catalytic selectivity or intrinsic activity of metal NPs. For example, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is frequently adopted in the controllable synthesis of Au NPs and it is inevitable to introduce the residual PVA [26,27]. Theoretical calculation reveals that the adsorbed hydroxyl on the surface of Au(111) can promote the CO2RR to CO via stabilizing the intermediate (*COOH) [28]. Thus, the residual PVA with massive hydroxyl might act as an effective modifier for Au-catalyzed CO2RR. Unfortunately, it is hard to determine the role of PVA on the CO2RR according to the experiment results because the surfactant is used during the synthesis of Au NPs [28]. Accordingly, to explore the effect of capping agents, the synthesis of surfactant- and polymer-free catalyst is prerequisite [24]. To our knowledge, no research focuses on elucidating the role of PVA on the CO2RR based on surfactant- and polymer-free Au NPs. Herein, surfactant- and polymer-free Au NPs with the uniform size distribution were firstly prepared and used for PVA modification to explore the role of PVA on the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. It is found that the modification of PVA on Au NPs leads to a strikingly enhanced activity and selectivity in comparison with the naked Au NPs. Additionally, controllable PVA modification on Au NPs reveals that the modified catalyst with the moderate PVA coverage density can obtain the best activity for CO2 reduction but the excessive PVA modification results in the decreased activity. Furthermore, by making full use of the capping agent derived from the synthesis process, Au NPs with residual PVA modification can be prepared conveniently as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the CO2RR."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, average MW: 9000–10000, 80% hydrolyzed) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium citrate were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate (HAuCl4▪3H2O) was purchased from Adamas. Unless others stated, all the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Ultrapure water from a Millipore Autopure system was used in all our experiments."
3,Synthesis of catalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of catalysts 2.2.1 Synthesis of Au/C Prior to synthesis, beakers were cleaned by aqua regia and washed by ultrapure water. 50 mL of HAuCl4 solution (0.25 mM) was added into a clean beaker and then a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (0.1 M, NaBH4/metal (mol/mol) = 5) was added under stirring. After stirring for ca. 30 s, the formed Au NP solution was diluted by 200 mL of ultrapure water to avoid the particle aggregation. Then, 9.85 mg of Vulcan XC-72R carbon black (Carbot Corp.) dispersed in 10 mL of ultrapure water was added into the above solution under stirring. After the suspension was stirred for 4 h at room temperature (ca. 20 ± 2 °C), the black precipitate was filtered, and washed with ultrapure water. Finally, the precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h to obtain the surfactant- and polymer-free catalyst (Au/C). 2.2.2 Synthesis of PVA-modified Au/C The dilute Au NP solution was prepared as the aforementioned procedure and then 10 μL of PVA solution (1.0 wt.%) was added. Afterward, 9.85 mg of XC-72R carbon black dispersed in 10 mL of ultrapure water was added into the above solution under stirring. After the suspension was stirred for 12 h, 65 μL of PVA solution (1.0 wt.%) was added. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred for another 4 h and then the black precipitate was filtered, and washed with ultrapure water. Finally, the precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h to obtain the PVA-modified Au/C. 2.2.3 Controllable modification of PVA on Au/C Au/C prepared by the batch synthesis method (in the Supplementary Information) was used for controllable PVA modification. In a typical procedure, 50 mg of Au/C and a certain amount of PVA solution (1.0 wt.%) were added into 50 mL of ultrapure water under vigorous magnetic stirring. After the suspension was stirred for 12 h, the black precipitate was filtered, and washed with ultrapure water. Finally, the precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h to obtain the PVA-modified catalyst. The PVA coverage density of modified Au/C was determined by the ratio of its decreased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) to the pristine ECSA. Modified catalysts were named as Au/C-PVA-Θ (Θ is defined as the PVA coverage density). Au/C-PVA-12%, Au/C-PVA-20% and Au/C-PVA-30% were prepared when the usage amount of PVA solution (1.0 wt.%) is 100 μL, 200 μL and 300 μL, respectively. 2.2.4 Synthesis of residual PVA-modified Au/C 500 μL of PVA solution and 200 mL of HAuCl4 solution (1 mM) were mixed together and then a freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (0.1 M, NaBH4/metal (mol/mol) = 5) was added into the mixture rapidly under vigorous magnetic stirring. Afterward, 157.6 mg of Vulcan XC-72R carbon black dispersed in 16 mL of ultrapure water and 1.17 g of sodium chloride dispersed in 4 mL of ultrapure water were added into the above colloid under stirring. After the suspension was stirred for 12 h, the precipitate was filtered, and washed with ultrapure water and followed by drying under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h to obtain the catalyst."
4,Preparation of electrode,"2.3 Preparation of electrode The working electrode was prepared according to the previous procedure [29]. In brief, Vulcan XC-72R carbon black, PTFE and isopropanol/water (IPA/H2O) were mixed to form the homogeneous ink with the weight ratio of 4:1:120. Then the prepared ink was sprayed on the carbon paper (Toray TGP-H-060, Toray Industries Inc.) to form the micro-porous layer (MPL) with the carbon loading of 1 mg cm−2. Thereafter, the as-prepared catalysts and Nafion resin (mass ratio, catalyst: Nafion = 9:1) were ultrasonically dispersed in IPA/H2O solution for 1 h and then air-brushed onto the MPL with the catalysts loading of 1.0 mg cm−2 at 60 °C."
5,Physical characterization,"2.4 Physical characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE powder X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα (λ =1.5418 Å) radiation source, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectra of the colloid and solution Au NPs were measured by a UV–vis spectroscopy (UV-8000S). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe instrument with a monochromatic excitation source of Al Kα radiation (hν =1486.6 eV) performed under 12 kV and 4 mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) were carried out on a JEM-2100 F/HR microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The actual content of Au within Au/C was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)."
6,Electrochemical measurements and products analysis of CO2 reduction,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements and products analysis of CO2 reduction All the electrochemical measurements were carried out in a gas-tight two-component cell (separated by Nafion 115) with three-electrode system connected to Solarton 1287 and 1255B systems. The geometric area of the working electrode is 1.0 × 1.0 cm2. Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl electrode (with saturated KCl as the filling solution) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The pH meter (SevenCompact, Mettler Toledo) was used to measure the pH of Ar or CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution and detailed pH values are 8.8 and 7.2, respectively. All the potentials for CO2 reduction were measured against the Ag/AgCl electrode and converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.0591 × pH. Prior to the controlled potential electrolysis, the electrolyte of two compartments was saturated with CO2 by bubbling CO2 gas for 30 min. The electrolyte in the cathodic compartment was stirred at a rate of 500 rpm. During the electrolysis, CO2 gas was delivered at a rate of 20.00 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) and routed directly into an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu) equipped with FID and TCD detectors. The gas phase composition was analyzed by GC-2014 every 10 min. Liquid products were detected by 500 MHz Bruker Avance-III NMR Spectrometer."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Synthesis and surface modification of Au/C,"3.1 Synthesis and surface modification of Au/C The synthesis process of surfactant- and polymer-free Au/C contains the formation of Au NPs and the particle loading on the carbon support. After adding the reductant, the immediate appearance of an orange-brown color indicates the formation of Au NPs. Fig. 1 a shows the TEM image of Au NPs and the corresponding HRTEM image (Fig. 1b) presents a lattice spacing of 0.23 nm which belongs to Au(111). After the Au NPs were supported on XC-72R carbon, no obvious aggregation of Au NPs occurs and the catalyst exhibits a uniform particle distribution with an average size of 3.4 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. 1c and d). The PVA-modified Au NPs were also prepared, named as PVA-Au/C. The modified catalyst exhibits a similar size (Fig. S1 and Table S1) and the same crystal structure as Au/C (Fig. S2). The UV–vis spectrum of dilute Au NP solution (Fig. 2 a) displays a characteristic maximum absorption at 510 nm due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is the collective oscillation of conduction band electrons when resonant with the same frequency of incident photon [30,31]. After adding 5 μL of PVA solution (1 wt.%) into 2.5 mL of Au NP solution, the intensity of LSPR peak is enhanced notably and the peak value shifts to 514 nm, which might result from changes of dielectric properties and local environment of Au NPs induced by the Au-PVA interaction [32]. Moreover, zeta potentials have been measured with ZetaSizer Nano-ZS90 from Malvern Instruments. Result (Table S3) indicates that both zeta potentials of Au NPs and PVA are slightly negative. After the addition of PVA, the zeta potential of Au NPs varies from –3.24 to –16.4 mV. Such a change in zeta potential suggests the modification of PVA on the surface of Au NPs, which has influence on the surface charge density as well as on its distribution in the diffuse part of the electrical double layer [33]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the chemical state and relative content of surface elements. Au 4f peaks of both Au/C and PVA-Au/C (Fig. S3) locate at 84.46 and 88.14 eV, indicating the metallic Au state. Table S2 presents the relative content of surface elements and PVA-Au/C possesses an oxygen content of 5.04%, higher than 2.97% of Au/C. The increased oxygen content in PVA-Au/C relative to Au/C could be attributed to the contribution of adsorbed PVA, which containing massive hydroxyl (OH) and ester (COCO) groups (Fig. S4). Besides, high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s (Fig. 2b) were deconvoluted into five component peaks at 284.8, 285.7, 286.6, 287.5 and 289.2 eV, corresponding to CC, CH, CO, CO and OCO functionalities [34], respectively. Specifically, PVA-Au/C contains 3.7% of OCO functionality much more than 0.8% of that in Au/C. The detected slight content of functionality in Au/C should be derived from contaminated carbon and the strikingly increased content of functionality in PVA-Au/C confirms the successful modification of PVA."
9,The effect of PVA modification on the CO2RR,"3.2 The effect of PVA modification on the CO2RR Firstly, the CO2RR activity on Au/C and PVA-Au/C was evaluated in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Compared to Au/C, PVA-Au/C obtains larger current densities between –0.29 V and –0.8 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. 3 a), indicating an increased activity. Interestingly, a plateau of current densities occurs at ca.–0.6 ˜ –0.74 V (vs. RHE) on PVA-Au/C, displaying a limited mass transfer process due to the fast CO2 conversion. Fig. 3b shows the LSV curves in Ar-saturated electrolyte where HER prevails. Clearly, the current densities on PVA-Au/C are lower than that on Au/C over the potential range of –0.26 ˜ –0.8 V (vs. RHE). Typically, the current density on Au/C is 4.2-fold of that on PVA-Au/C at –0.48 V (vs. RHE). Besides, PVA-Au/C also presents an increased overpotential (180 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 relative to Au/C. These results manifest that the PVA modification helps to inhibit HER activity effectively. The mechanism of inhibited HER activity might arise from the destabilized H* on PVA-modified Au NPs [28]. Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) was carried out in a home-made two-component cell filled with CO2-saturated KHCO3 solution. No liquids products were detected by 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S7). Gas products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatograph (GC) and only H2 and CO were detected. PVA-modified carbon (PVA-C) exhibits a negligible CO2RR activity (Fig. S6 and Fig. 3c) and Au/C achieves CO Faradaic efficiencies less than 60% at all the tested potentials (Fig. 3c). In sharp contrast, PVA-Au/C exhibits superior CO selectivity and the maximal CO Faradaic efficiency of 97.0% is reached at –0.58 V (vs. RHE). Fig. 3d displays the potential-dependent current density for CO production. Surprisingly, PVA-Au/C achieves a record-high current density of 98.6 mA cm−2, much higher than 28.5 mA cm−2 on Au/C at –0.77 V (vs. RHE). These results elucidate that the PVA modification is an effective approach for facilitating CO2 reduction on Au NPs. To further unravel the effect of PVA coverage density on the CO2RR, the same batch of Au/C was used for controllable PVA modification. Detailed synthesis procedure was presented in the Supplementary Information and the batch-synthesized Au/C was named as Au/C-2. Cu underpotential deposition [12] was performed to evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Au/C-2 before and after PVA modification (Fig. S10). The PVA coverage density of modified Au/C was estimated by the ratio of its decreased ECSA relative to the pristine ECSA. A series of Au/C with PVA coverage densities of 12%, 20% and 30% were prepared and named as Au/C-PVA-12%, Au/C-PVA-20% and Au/C-PVA-30%, respectively. The surface oxygen content in these catalysts increases gradually with the PVA coverage density (Fig. S11), suggesting the validity of controllable PVA modification. Subsequently, the CO2RR performance of Au/C with different PVA coverage densities was examined at –0.4 V (vs. RHE). In Fig. 4 a. It is clear that the PVA modification on Au NPs greatly improves the CO selectivity and Au/C-PVA-30% exhibits the best CO Faradaic efficiency of 77.5%, far more than 36.1% on Au/C-2. Moreover, both Au/C-PVA-12% and Au/C-PVA-20% achieve increased total current densities compared to Au/C-2, similar as the above result. By contrast, Au/C-PVA-30% presents a poor total current density, lower than that of the pristine sample. The decreased total activity should be ascribed to the blocking effect that excessive PVA coating hinders the mass transfer of reactants seriously. In addition, Fig. 4b displays the mass activity and ECSA-normalized activity for CO production over Au/C with different PVA coverage densities. Both the best mass activity and ECSA-normalized current density are reached on Au/C-PVA-20%, manifesting the great significance of regulating the PVA coverage density. In aqueous electrolyte, the inhibited activity of HER benefits for the CO2RR owing to their competitive relationship. Nevertheless, the improved performance of CO2RR might also result from the enhanced intrinsic activity of CO2RR. To this end, Tafel analysis was conducted to study the kinetics of CO2 reduction on Au/C and PVA-Au/C. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the Tafel slope on PVA-Au/C is 60 mV dec−1 (close to the theoretical value of 59 mV dec−1), less than 98 mV dec−1 on Au/C, suggesting a fast one-electron transfer step prior to a rate-limited chemical step [35]. Taken together, a possible mechanism (Fig. 5b) is proposed to explain the enhanced intrinsic activity of CO2RR. It is believed that the adsorbed PVA might induce the formation of hydrogen-bond network on the metal-polymer interface, thus probably stabilizing the key intermediate (*COOH) via the hydrogen-bond interaction [36]. The mechanism can also be utilized to explain the polyvinylpyrrolidone- and polyethylene oxide-enhanced CO2RR performance (Fig. S12). Further, to evaluate the stability of the PVA-modified Au/C, the long-term stability test was performed on PVA-Au/C at –0.55 V vs. RHE. In Fig. 6 , a Faradaic efficiency of above 95% and a current density of 27 mA cm−2 for CO production are obtained during the 24 h stability test, which exhibits an outstanding stability."
10,Residual PVA modification on Au NPs,"3.3 Residual PVA modification on Au NPs Since PVA plays a significant role in improving the activity and selectivity of CO2RR on Au NPs, the residual PVA derived from the synthesis process could be further utilized for developing the modified catalyst conveniently. To verify the feasibility, the sol-immobilization method was adopted to prepare the residual PVA-modified Au NPs. The synthesis process (Fig. S13) contains the formation of Au sols and the immobilization of Au NPs on carbon support. To facilitate the immobilization process of Au NPs on carbon support, NaCl was used as an additive [37,38]. Fig. S15b shows the residual PVA-modified Au/C with a uniform particle distribution and an average size of 2.6 nm. The XPS spectrum (Fig. S16) demonstrates no residual Cl−. Similar to the previous PVA-modified catalyst, the high oxygen content (Fig. S16) in the as-prepared catalyst indicates the presence of residual PVA. The CO2RR performance of the residual PVA-modified Au/C were evaluated by combining the CPE test and GC products analysis. The time-dependent current densities at different potentials are plotted in Fig. 7 a and no current degradation occurs during the one-hour test. Fig. 7b shows the excellent CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 88.4% over a wide potential range of –0.4 ˜ –0.8 V (vs. RHE) and the CO Faradaic efficiency (98.2%) close to 100% is achieved at –0.67 V (vs. RHE). The potential-dependent current density and mass activity for CO production are displayed in Fig. 7c. An ultrahigh current density of 110 mA cm–2 together with an extremely high mass activity of 831 A g–1 is achieved at –0.8 V (vs. RHE). To date, achieving such high current density and mass activity simultaneously in a traditional two-component cell is unprecedented in previous studies (Table S4). In practical application, it is inevitable to conduct the intermittent test, which brings about a great challenge to the performance stability. To evaluate the stability under discontinuous condition, four-time intermittent electrolytic experiments on the same electrode with a total time of 4 h are conducted at –0.67 V (vs. RHE). After each test, the electrolyte was refreshed and saturated by CO2 again. From Fig. 7d, the stable current density of about 60 mA cm−2 and the constant CO selectivity of near 100% are achieved during the four-time tests, demonstrating an excellent stability."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, we have described the PVA modification as an intriguing approach to greatly improve the activity and selectivity of CO2RR on Au NPs. The record-high activity together with excellent selectivity for CO production is achieved on the PVA-modified Au NPs compared to the naked Au NPs. Tafel analysis reveals that the PVA modification enables the Au NPs with a favorable reaction pathway for the CO2RR, which could be explained by the proposed mechanism that hydrogen-bond network from the metal-polymer interface helps to stabilize the key intermediate (*COOH). Finally, by taking advantage of the capping polymer during the synthesis process, Au NPs with residual PVA modification were prepared conveniently. The catalyst achieves both exclusive selectivity and unprecedented activity for the CO2RR, which confirms that the utilization of capping polymer from the perspective of surface modification is a promising strategy to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction."
