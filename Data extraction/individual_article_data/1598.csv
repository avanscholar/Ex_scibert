0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of the economy, the amount of industrial wastewater discharged increases annually, leading to an increased need for environmental protection [1]. Organic wastewater accounts for a large proportion of industrial wastewater, and its treatment has always been a concern. The purification and reuse of organic matter in wastewater not only reduces the impact of wastewater on the environment, but also reduces the waste of resources. A large amount of wastewater containing alcohols and esters are produced in chemical and pharmaceutical production processes; alcohols and esters often form azeotropes with water, which debilitates the treatment of wastewater. Recovering alcohols and esters from wastewater not only realizes the effective recovery of resources, but also reduces environmental pollution. N-propyl acetate (PAC) [2] and isopropanol (IPA) [3] are important raw materials for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. A packaging material manufacturer in Shandong produces an organic solvent waste liquid containing a PAC/IPA/water mixture which comprises 27 mol% PAC, 5 mol% IPA, and 68 mol% water. The processing capacity of the plant is approximately 100 kmol/h. The separation and reuse of this waste liquid is of great significance from an economical and environmental protection perspective. PAC and IPA not only form azeotropes in wastewater, but also form azeotropes with water. Investigations into the recovery of these components from wastewater is important for the general process of resource recovery from wastewater. The H2O/PAC/IPA system forms both binary azeotropes [4,5] and ternary azeotropes [6]. The separation methods that are commonly used to separate azeotropes include azeotropic distillation [7,8], pressure swing distillation (PSD) [9–11], extractive distillation [12–14], and membrane separation [15–17]. Extractive distillation involves the addition of a solvent and a change in the relative volatility of the components to be separated [18]; it has been studied by many experts and is widely used in industry. Gutiérrez-Guerra et al. [19] studied the design and optimization of extractive distillation and thermally coupled extractive distillation. The results showed that thermally coupled extractive distillation results in lower energy consumption, reduced CO2 emissions, and an improved operational performance compared to extractive distillation. Li et al. [20] proposed a three-tower extractive distillation method to separate acetonitrile/isopropanol/water mixtures using ethylene glycol (EG) as the entrainment agent. Compared to conventional extractive distillation (CED), the use of heat integration combined with intermediate reboiler processes can save 48.50% energy, reduce the total annual cost (TAC) by 36.24%, reduce gas emissions by 48.55%, and increase the exergy efficiency by 70.73%. Separation is an important part of chemical production procedures. The energy consumed during separation accounts for approximately 50% of that of the chemical process, while distillation accounts for the majority of this. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption of the distillation process is an important issue. Many chemical process intensification technologies, including divided wall distillation [21–23], thermal-integrated distillation [24], heat pump-assisted distillation [25], and thermally coupled distillation [26,27], have been widely used to reduce the energy consumption of distillation processes. Heat pump distillation technology has been extensively studied by Gooding [28] as an effective energy-saving technology. Chen et al. [29] proposed a new type of heat pump assisted azeotropic partition wall tower (HP-ADWC) to separate the binary azeotropic system with the highest boiling point. Compared with the traditional azeotropic distillation process, the new process can reduce the energy consumption by 42.93% and the total cost by 24.36%. Guang et al. [30] proposed a three-column heteroazeotropic and pressure-swing coupling distillation process (TCHPSD) to separate a diisopropyl ether/isopropyl alcohol/water mixture; furthermore, they combined a separation column (DWC) and vapor recompression (VRC) technology. The results showed that, compared with the TCHPSD process, the TAC of the TCHPSD-DWC-VRC process was reduced by 12.0%, while the energy consumption was reduced by 63.8%. Xu et al. [31] separated an isopropanol/tetrahydrofuran/water ternary mixture by indirect and direct extractive distillation. The energy consumption and total cost of the double-heat pump-assisted direct extractive distillation with heat integration were reduced by 64.97% and 34.26%, respectively. Membrane separation technology [32–34] has attracted increasing attention because of its economic advantages and operational stability. Pervaporation (PV), a type of membrane separation, has been extensively studied. Gooding and Bahouth [35] proposed incorporating a PV unit between two distillation columns to break the azeotrope at the top of the first distillation column. Compared with the traditional ethanol dehydration distillation process, this integrated process can reduce the equipment cost by 28% and the operational cost by 40%. Huang et al. [36] proposed a hybrid PV-distillation process for the treatment of an ethanol/water system, as it could reduce the energy consumption of the process by 50% compared to that of conventional distillation. Verhoef et al. [37] used a hybrid pervaporation-distillation process for the purification of ethanol and acetic acid. For the purification of ethanol, owing to the process characteristics, the membrane module replacement cycle shortens, and the equipment cost of the process increases; therefore, the hybrid process is not economically advantageous. Regarding the acetic acid purification process, if an appropriate membrane area is used, the hybrid process is more economical than the conventional distillation process. In this study, solvents were selected according to their standard relative volatility and solvent power. The economical objective was to achieve a minimum TAC, and the process was optimized using a sequential iteration method. To recycle the energy used, the heat at the top of the column can be compressed to heat the bottom. The process was reintegrated through a heat exchange network, based on pinch point technology. Finally, the entire hybrid PV-distillation process was optimized."
1,Selection of solvent,"Quantum chemical calculations on water, PAC, IPA, and seven other solvents were performed using Material Studio software to obtain their σ-profiles, as shown in Fig. 1 . σ < 0.0084e/Ǻ2 is the hydrogen bond donor region, in which molecules can donate electrons, −0.0084e/Ǻ2 < σ < 0.0084e/Ǻ2 is the neutral region in which molecules do not donate or receive electrons, and σ > 0.0084e/Ǻ2 is the hydrogen bond acceptor region, in which molecules can accept electrons. Water and IPA have peaks in all three regions, indicating that water and IPA can both donate and receive electrons, while PAC have peaks in the neutral and hydrogen bond acceptor regions, thus, PAC can only accept electrons. The dielectric constants of water, IPA, and PAC are 81, 18.3, and 6.002, respectively. Therefore, PAC is a light component, whereas water and IPA are heavy components [38]. As water and IPA have peaks in the hydrogen bond acceptor region, the chosen solvents should have peaks in the hydrogen bond donor region. Glycerol, EG, dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylacetamide (DMAC) exhibit high peaks at 0.009 e/Ǻ2, 0.013 e/Ǻ2, 0.013 e/Ǻ2, and 0.014 e/Ǻ2, respectively. The other extractants do not have clear peaks in the hydrogen bond donor region. Therefore, glycerol, EG, DMF, and DMAC were preliminarily selected as extractants. The solvent has a considerable influence on extractive distillation. The relative volatility (αB, A) of the solvent is used as an important index in solvent screening; it is expressed as follows: α B , A = γ B , S ∞ P B S γ A , S ∞ P A S where, γ i , S ∞ is the activity coefficient of component i in the solvent if component B is the distillate and P i S is the saturated vapor pressure of component i. Another important index for evaluating the effectiveness of the solvent is the solvent power (SP), which is expressed as follows: S p = 1 γ A , S ∞ M W A M W S where, MWA and MWS are the molecular weights of component A and solvent S, respectively. In this study, the COSMO-SAC model was used to estimate the activity coefficients of each component in the different solvents, and the relative volatility and solvent power of each solvent in the IPA-H2O, PAC-H2O, and PAC-IPA systems were calculated at different temperatures. The temperature range was determined based on the azeotropic temperatures of the IPA-H2O (353.18 K), PAC-H2O (352.62 K), and PAC-IPA (355.04 K) systems. As shown in Fig. 2 , the relative volatility of EG in the three systems is higher than those of the other three solvents at various temperatures. As indicated in Figure S1, DMAC has the highest solvent power. A high relative volatility and solvent power indicates that the solvent is suitable for extractive distillation. However, there is an inverse trend between relative volatility and solvent power; that is, a high relative volatility corresponds to a low solvent power [39]. Therefore, it is necessary to weigh up the two indices to determine which solvent is more appropriate. According to the results reported by Papadopoulos et al. [40], solvents with high relative volatilities have a greater impact on the cost of the process than solvents with high solvent powers. Therefore, EG was established to be the best solvent. Tables S1, S2, and S3 show the detailed activity coefficient data, and Table S4 shows the saturated vapor pressure data at different temperatures."
2,Evaluation indicators of process performance,
3,Economy,"3.1 Economy The TAC [41] is the main index used to evaluate the economical aspect of the separation process. TAC includes the capital cost (CC) and operating cost (OC), and is expressed as follows: TAC = CC / 3 + OC In this study, the equipment cost recovery period was 3 years. The capital costs include the costs of the condenser, reboiler, and column, while the costs of the pipe, valve, and pump are far smaller and can be ignored. The primary operating costs include those of the condensate and steam used in the separation process. The capital cost for the membrane includes the costs of the membrane material, vacuum pump, and membrane module [42]. The capital evaluation and formulas are presented in Table S5."
4,Environment evaluation,"3.2 Environment evaluation With the deterioration of the environment, increasing attention is being paid to environmental protection through process design [43,44]. When evaluating the separation process, the economic and environmental impact of the process should be considered. Gabi software can be used for the environmental impact evaluation. The acid potential (AP) and global warming potential (GWP) were used to assess the environmental friendliness of each process. The GWP represents the effect of greenhouse gas on global warming, while the AP represents the potential of substances to form acid fog and acid rain. The CML2001 method in the GABI 9.0 database was used to calculate these two influencing factors for each separation stage."
5,Heat pump performance,"3.3 Heat pump performance The coefficient of performance (COP), proposed by Plesu et al. [45], is an effective index for evaluating the feasibility of air compression technology, and is expressed as follows: COPs= 1 Î· Carnot = Q W = T c T R - T c where, Q [kW] is the heat required by the reboiler of the distillation column, W [kW] is the work input used by the compressor, and TR [K] and TC [K] are the temperatures of the condenser and reboiler of the distillation column, respectively. A COP>10 indicates that the air compression technology exhibits energy saving advantages, while a COP between 5 and 10 suggests that further detailed exploration is required to determine whether the air compression technology is suitable and a COP lower than 5 indicates that the air compression technology is not suitable for energy saving and a reduction in the energy consumption of the process [45]."
6,Process design,"The separation of PAC/IPA/water was simulated using Aspen Plus V10. The thermodynamic model chosen is extremely important for accurate simulation results. Based on the vapor–liquid equilibrium data, the deviations between the NRTL, UNIQUAC, and Wilson models were compared; the NRTL model resulted in the smallest deviation (Tables S6, S7, and S8). Therefore, the NRTL model was used in this study; Table S9 shows the binary interaction parameters used. A feed flow of 100 kmol/h and feed flow composition of 68 mol% water, 27 mol% PAC, and 5 mol% IPA (>99.9% purity requirement) was used for the simulation. Figure S2 shows the effect of the pressure in column C1 on the purity of PAC separated from the PAC/IPA/water system and the relative volatility of the PAC/IPA/water system. As shown in Figure S2a, an IPA purity of 0.999 is achieved when using a pressure lower than 0.2 bar in column C1. The relative volatilities of the PAC-IPA and PAC-water systems continue to decrease with an increase in the C1 column pressure, while the relative volatility of the IPA-water system increases as the pressure of column C1 increases. Figure S2b shows the effect of pressure on the relative volatilities of the systems. Because PAC is separated by column C1, the influence of the pressure on the relative volatility of the PAC-IPA and PAC-water systems should primarily be considered. Therefore, the separation efficiency of PAC increases with a decrease in the pressure in column C1. Based on the effect of pressure on the purity of the PAC isolated and the relative volatility of the PAC-containing systems, the chosen pressure for column C1 was 0.2 bar. Douglas et al. [46] proposed a scheme to optimize the TAC of a distillation column. This sequential iterative optimization method [47,48] was used in this study to establish the optimal design parameters, and the corresponding optimization flow chart is shown in Figure S3. The optimal design parameters are obtained by performing iterative calculations from the inner cycle to the outer cycle. The inner cycle includes the operation parameters of the distillation column, such as the position of the fresh feed, the position of the solvent feed, and the number of stages, while the outer circulation determines the optimal sequence of the distillation columns for the separation process. The optimized variables include the feed location, reflux ratio, number of trays, and quantity of solvent. By changing the reflux ratio, the product purity at the top of the column meets the requirements, and the feed position and number of trays in the distillation column can be optimized. Owing to the complexity of the optimization process and that many parameters need to be optimized, extraction distillation optimization software (EDDOS) was chosen to effectively optimize the process [12]. As shown in Figure S4, the process was optimized by using ActiveX technology and object linking and embedding (OLE) automation server technology to connect Aspen Plus V10 and Excel, while Visual Basic (VB) was used to connect the data and control emulators."
7,Basic extractive distillation process for separating PAC/IPA/water,"4.1 Basic extractive distillation process for separating PAC/IPA/water Fig. 3 shows the process used to separate PAC/IPA/water by extractive distillation. This process includes the use of three distillation columns, with columns C1 and C2 being extractive distillation columns. The feed stream and solvent enter the distillation column simultaneously for separation of the mixture. After separation is performed by the distillation column, the high-purity solvent is extracted from the bottom of column C3 and reentered into columns C1 and C2. Because the product contains a small amount of solvent, causing loss of solvent, a solvent makeup stream is required. The products of the three distillation columns were PAC, IPA, and water, respectively. Using VB optimization software, NEF1 = 6, NT1 = 15, NF1 = 12, NT2 = 31, NEF2 = 4, NF2 = 18, NF3 = 5, and NT3 = 14, EF1 = 100 kmol/h, and EF2 = 60 kmol/h, the TAC reaches a minimum."
8,Heat pump-assisted process with feed pretreatment for separating PAC/IPA/water,"4.2 Heat pump-assisted process with feed pretreatment for separating PAC/IPA/water The enhanced distillation processes that include feed pretreatment are shown in Fig. 4 . Air compression technology is suitable for use in distillation column C1 because its COP is 11.41. The thermal load of the auxiliary reboiler is 273.45 kW, while the heat load of the condenser is −74.21 kW. The temperature of the bottom stream in column C3 is higher; thus, this heat can be used to preheat other streams and realize heat recovery. A heat exchange network (HEN) was used to optimize the energy recovery of the separation process. Figure S5 shows the HEN design for the feed preheating process. The process includes 11 heat-exchange units. The internal heat exchange units are H1, H2, H3, and H4, the cooling units that require cooling water in the system are C1, C2, C3, and C4, and the heating units requiring high temperature steam are R1, R2, and R3. The bottom stream of column C3 first preheats the feed stream of column C3. The heat exchange process can achieve a heat recovery of 469.49 kW, and the energy consumption of the reboiler in column C3 can be reduced by 924.69 kW. This stream can further preheat the feed stream of column C2. This heat exchange process can achieve a heat recovery of 336.77 kW, and the energy consumption of the column C2 reboiler can be reduced by 442.33 kW. Finally, this stream preheats the top stream of column C1, resulting in a heat recovery of 166.39 kW. The minimum temperature difference in this study was set to > 10 °C. The temperature-enthalpy (T-H) diagram for the enhanced processes that include feed preheating is shown in Fig. 5 . QC represents the energy consumption when using cooling water in the condensers in the columns and auxiliary condensers, while QH represents the energy consumption when using hot steam in the reboilers in the columns and auxiliary reboiler. The shadowed section in the middle represents the energy recovered during the separation process. The cold composite curve (CCC) and hot composite curve (HCC) correspond to the internal heat transfer link of the system shown in Figure S5."
9,Hybrid pervaporation-distillation process for separating PAC/IPA/water,"4.3 Hybrid pervaporation-distillation process for separating PAC/IPA/water 4.3.1 Mathematic model for pervaporation After the stream enters the PV module, one side of the membrane is under negative pressure due to the action of the vacuum pump, partial pressure differences exist between the components on both sides of the membrane, and the gaseous permeate can pass through the membrane, as shown in Fig. 6 . In this process, the permeate is water, and the retentate is EG. The reported pervaporation flux equation [49] was used to establish the PV model using Aspen Custom Modeler software. The total flux (Ji ) and separation factor (α) were obtained using Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. (1) J i = W i A m · t (2) α = y perm , i / ( 1 - y perm , i ) x feed , i / ( 1 - x feed , i ) Fp,i , the permeate flow of component i, can be obtained from Eqs. (3) and (4). (3) J i = D i l X n , i γ i P i sat - y n , i P P (4) F P , i = A m D i l X n , i γ i P i sat - y n , i P P An Arrhenius-type relationship is adopted to describe the relationship between the permeability and temperature, as shown in Eq. (5). J in Eq. (6) is the pre-exponential factor of the flux. (5) D i = D i , 0 e - E i / R T (6) J = J 0 e x p - E J RT To facilitate this investigation, PV was divided into n equal cells, with each cell exhibiting the same permeability. The mass and energy balance of the cells are as follows: (7) F ret , n - 1 - F ret , n - F perm , n = 0 (8) F ret , n - 1 x ret , n - 1 , i - F ret , n x ret , n , i - F perm , n x perm , n , i = 0 (9) F ret , n - 1 h ret , n - 1 - F ret , n h ret , n - F perm , n h perm , n = 0 According to the experimental data, Wang et al. established the following equation to describe the relationship between the flux and operating temperature by using the Antoine equation: (10) ln J w = - 4.5953 × 1000 T + 18.487 R 2 = 0.9979 (11) ln J w = - 50116 × 1000 T + 13.623 R 2 = 0.9984 4.3.2 Pervaporation-distillation hybrid process The hybrid PV-distillation process was further developed based on the feed preheating process. In this process, two extractive distillation columns were used to separate PAC and IPA. The high temperature of the bottom product in column C2 can be used to preheat the feed stream of column C2 and the compressor. After heat exchange, the stream is cooled by the cooler and then enters the PV module for solvent recovery. Fig. 7 shows the hybrid PV-distillation process. The feed pressure, temperature, and permeate pressure in the membrane unit was 1.196 bar, 70 ℃, and 0.2 kPa, respectively. During the separation of water and EG using a PV membrane, the temperature of the mixture continuously decreased, which resulted in a decrease in the flux of the membrane. Increasing the membrane area does not clearly increase its permeability, but does sharply increase the cost of the equipment. Therefore, to improve the permeability the number of PV modules was increased, while the flux of the PV membrane can be increased by increasing the heater between the two modules. Three membranes with areas of 2205 m2, 1820 m2, and 1500 m2, the minimum membrane areas required to separate the mixture, were used."
10,Results and discussion,"First, the TAC of the processes were calculated and compared, as shown in Table S7. As shown in Table S7, the enhanced distillation processes that include feed pretreatment have TACs 36.03% lower than the basic process. This indicates that after the addition of the heat pump, the separation process has a considerably lower energy consumption owing to the use of high heat at the top of column C1 and the high-temperature stream at the bottom of column C3. The thermal loads of the reboilers in columns C2 and C3 can be effectively reduced. Thus, the energy consumption is reduced for each separation process, and the TAC decreases significantly. The TAC of the hybrid PV-distillation process is less than that of the ordinary process (13.47% lower), indicating that the PV module in the separation process performs better than that of the ordinary process. However, owing to the high equipment cost of the membrane module, the cost of the hybrid PV-distillation process is higher than that of the enhanced distillation processes. The processes were further analyzed from an environmental perspective. The GWP and AP results for these processes are shown in Fig. 8 . A high energy consumption represents a high GWP and high air pollution. For the basic process (scenario 1) and enhanced distillation processes (scenario 2), the GWPs are 1650.11 kg CO2-eq and 891.78 kg CO2-eq, respectively, while the APs are 2.95 kg SO2-eq and 1.60 kg SO2-eq, respectively. For the enhanced distillation processes with feed pretreatment, the consumption of steam and cooling water is greatly reduced owing to effective heat recovery, which results in a lower GWP and AP than those achieved with the basic processes. The GWP and AP for the hybrid PV-distillation process (scenario 3) is 393.45 kg CO2-eq and 0.70 kg SO2-eq, respectively. The membrane module is used to reduce the consumption of steam and electricity, minimizing the GWP and AP for this process; this indicates that the hybrid PV-distillation process has the best environmental performance."
11,Conclusion,"In this study, the separation of PAC/IPA/water were explored. Based on their σ-profiles, glycol, EG, DMF, and DMAC were selected as potential solvents for the separation process; EG was used as solvent based on its relative volatility and solubility. The process parameters were optimized using VB software. To reduce the energy consumption of the process, an enhanced distillation process with feed pretreatment, which was optimized by pinch technology and a heat exchange network, was proposed. In addition, a hybrid PV-distillation process was investigated. The TAC of the hybrid PV-distillation process was reduced by 13.47% compared to the basic process. In addition, the environmental impact performance of the process was analyzed. The hybrid PV-distillation process performed the best when considering its environmental impact performance. A comprehensive economic and environmental comparison suggested that the economic performance of the hybrid PV-distillation process is not clearly better than that of the other processes, but its environmental performance is far better."
