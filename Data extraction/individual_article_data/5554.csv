0,Introduction,"The societal awareness of the limits of the available fossil resources and the environmental impact of their use is driving efforts for the identification and use of alternative renewable resources and sustainable processes. These have boosted the interest in biomass as a source for chemicals production. The sustainability of industrial application of feedstock from biomass requires developing processes for carrying it out in agreement with green chemistry principles [1]. Such new processes could also be useful for minimizing and valorizing wastes from forestry, agriculture and the paper industry, using them as raw materials. For example, fatty alcohols are present in forestry wastes, such as beech or Douglas-fir barks, in tall oil, the third largest sub product of the Kraft pulping process [2], and in pulps from several non woody species (flax, hemp, sisal and abaca) by alkaline pulping. [3]. The term “fatty alcohols” denotes the higher alcohols, i.e., monohydric aliphatic alcohols of six or more carbon atoms, and refers specially to those with long-carbon chain (C8+). Those of natural origin are unbranched. Aliphatic long-carbon chain aldehydes, acids and esters are widely used in pharmaceutical, fragances and cosmetics applications. Aliphatic linear carbon chain C10–C18 aldehydes have desirable olfactory properties and are potent odoriferous components in perfumes [4]. It is of great importance to synthesize them in high-purity because by-products can make their use in perfume formulations totally unacceptable. The fatty acids abundant in nature have even numbers of carbon atoms and are frequently unsaturated [5], and those with C20+ are very rare; thus, new synthesis methods are needed to prepare those acids not available in nature (aliphatic, odd carbon atoms number or very long carbon chain). Wax esters (esters of long-chain fatty acids with long-chain fatty alcohols) are widespread in nature, as common components of the waxy cuticle on aerial surfaces of higher plants [6], but they are usually found in low concentrations (except in jojoba seeds). They are widely used in many industries, as high pressure lubricants, replacing hydraulic oil, and in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, printing and leather industries. For instance, myristyl myristate (tetradecyl tetradecanoate) is an appreciated emollient, used in lotions and creams. All these valuable products (rare aldehydes and fatty acids, wax esters) could be produced by selective oxidation of their corresponding fatty alcohols. Selective alcohol oxidation is one of the key transformations in organic synthesis and in industrial practice, with a world-wide annual production of carbonyl compounds of 10,000 million t/yr by the last turn of century [7]. Conventional oxidation processes in industry are based upon the use of stoichiometric oxidants, and are not environmentally friendly. Interest in green sustainable processes for these reactions has rocketed research, with an almost 10-fold increase of papers on the subject from 1998 to 2012 [8], but reports on selective oxidation of fatty alcohols with more than eight carbon atoms (C8+) are really scarce: only 15 references since 1990; noticeably, none on tetradecanol oxidation and none reporting the use of nano gold catalysts [9]. This is probably due to their specific chemical and physical characteristics. Being primary and aliphatic, reactivity of fatty alcohols is the lowest among those of the different alcohol types (in fact, 1-octanol oxidation is frequently tested as for comparative purposes for this reason), and besides, it usually decreases with the increase of carbon chain length. In addition, their hydrophobicity, viscosity and melting and boiling points also increase with carbon chain length, which imposes restrictions in the reaction conditions for the higher alcohols oxidation. In this paper, we investigate the oxidation of 1-tetradecanol as a model molecule for the higher fatty alcohols. To our knowledge, aerobic oxidation of tetradecanol (myristic alcohol) has been reported only twice. The first one, in the liquid phase, using a PtO2 catalyst pretreated in hydrogen; the main product was the aldehyde or the acid depending on the amount of oxygen and the reaction time [10]. The other, in the gas phase, catalyzed by gold plated copper wire, that yields 59% aldehyde, with 85% selectivity, at 312°C [4]. In this work, we seek adherence to green chemistry principles, by using a heterogeneous catalyst, a clean oxidant at a pressure as low as possible, reaction temperatures as moderate as possible, and no addition of base to the solvent. We report here for the first time the selective oxidation of 1-tetradecanol over a nano sized Au catalyst, using oxygen at atmospheric pressure as oxidant and base-free alkanes as solvents. The catalyst, supported on ceria-alumina, was selected because of its high efficiency for the oxidation of 1-octanol found in a parallel study [11]. The effect of various reaction parameters (reaction temperature, run time, solvent) on catalytic performance has been investigated. Additionally, 1-octanol oxidation has been tested to study the effect of the alcohol carbon chain on the oxidation of fatty alcohols. The results of this preliminary study prove the feasibility of the reaction under these moderate reaction conditions and show the complexity of the dependence of selectivity on the reaction parameters."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetrachloroauric acid, HAuCl4 (Alfa Aesar) and a commercial CeO2–Al2O3 support (Puralox® 20, Sasol) were used for catalyst preparation. Oxygen (99,999%, Air Liquide), 1-tetradecanol (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1-octanol (Chromasolv® for HPLC, ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as reactants as received without any further purification. Heptane (99% grade HPLC, Scharlau) and n-decane (≥97%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as solvents."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation Gold was deposited by the direct anionic exchange method, assisted by NH3. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 containing the desired gold loading (2wt.% nominal amount) was heated at 70°C and put into contact with the support for 20min. Then the ammonia solution was added and kept for another 20min. The obtained solid was filtered, dried in oven at 100°C overnight and calcined in air at 300°C for 4h. A detailed description of the synthesis procedure is reported elsewhere [12]."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The catalyst chemical composition was determined by X-ray microfluorescence spectrometry (XRMF) in an EDAX Eagle III spectrophotometer with a rhodium source of radiation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on an X’Pert Pro PANalytical instrument. Diffractograms were recorded using Cu Kα radiation (40mA, 45kV) over a 2Θ-range of 10 to 80° with a position-sensitive detector using a step size of 0.05° and a step time of 240s."
5,Catalytic oxidation tests,"2.4 Catalytic oxidation tests Tests were conducted under atmospheric pressure at 80–120°C in a four-necked round bottom flask equipped with reflux condenser, oxygen feed, thermometer and a septum cap. In a typical test, catalyst was added (in a substrate/metal ratio (A/M)=100–500mol/mol) to 20mL of 1-tetradecanol solution (0.1M) in n-heptane or n-decane, with no base addition. The suspension was stirred and heated to the selected reaction temperature (T R ). Once reached it, run time started when oxygen was bubbled through it with a flow rate of 30mL/min, under near atmospheric pressure (P =100kPa), and the test was run for 6h. Reaction monitoring was done by analyzing small aliquots of the reaction mixture taken at various intervals. Aliquots were syringe filtered (pore 0.45μm), and were analyzed by GC in a Varian 450 GC, using a capillary DB wax column (15m×0.548mm), He as the carrier gas and a FID detector. In all measurements the carbon balance was within 100±3%. For comparative purposes, some similar tests were conducted under the same conditions using 1-octanol instead of 1-tetradecanol."
6,Results and discussion,"The catalyst chemical composition, determined by XRMF, was: 2.0wt.% Au, 77.7wt.% Al2O3, 20.3wt.% CeO2. Its BET specific surface area was 165m2/g. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1 ) shows only diffraction lines corresponding to the cubic CeO2 fluorite type structure (JCPDS# 00-004-0593) and to the γ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDS# 00-048-0367). No diffraction corresponding to metallic gold was detected. It should be mentioned, that the diffractions of the γ-Al2O3 phase overlaps the main diffraction peak of Au at 2θ =38°; however, there are no traces for gold diffractions at higher 2θ angles where no alumina contribution is found. The absence of Au diffraction normally is indicative of small gold particles size, typically under 5nm, which is commonly considered as the XRD detection limit. This was corroborated by particle size measurements from high resolution transmission electron micrographs, which showed a particle size around 4nm [11]. The initial catalytic tests were conducted under the reaction conditions found optimal for 1-octanol in a parallel study [11], i.e., at 80°C in n-heptane, with oxygen flow at near atmospheric pressure. Comparison of the oxidation of both alcohols is shown in Fig. 2 . Under these reaction conditions, the only products of tetradecanol oxidation were its corresponding aldehyde (tetradecanal) and ester (tetradecyl teradecanoate), but no acid formation was detected. The selectivity to tetradecanal was quite high (76.5–79mol%) and almost independent of conversion. On the contrary, some acid formation was detected in the oxidation of 1-octanol since the first analysis at 30min of run time; acid selectivity increased with run time, but it remained always very low (1.1–6.7mol%). The increase of the carbon chain length of the alcohol decreased the catalytic activity, similarly to what has been reported for Ru(OH)3/Al2O3 [13] and for Pd nanoparticles in mesocellular foam catalysts [14]. The effect on the product distribution is also marked: selectivity to ester at the same conversion level decreases from 42 to 45% for octanol down to 22% for tetradecanol. Taking into account that ester formation involves two alcohol molecules, both effects can be attributed to a bigger steric hindrance for tetradecanol due to its larger molecular size. The effect of the catalyst loading, and hence the alcohol/metal (A/M) ratio, was studied at the same conditions (T R =80°C, solvent n-heptane). As can be seen in Fig. 3 , the conversion at a given runtime increases with the decrease of the A/M. In fact, conversion at a given run time is linearly dependent on the reciprocal of A/M, and hence on metal (catalyst) amount (Fig. 4 ). Assuming that at low conversion levels reaction rate is roughly equal to the quotient conversion/run time, this indicates a linear dependence of rate as a function of catalyst amount. As a general trend, selectivity to ester increased with increasing conversion, and no acid was detected. Recently, Ishida et al. reported the direct formation of octyl octanoate (the ester) with no octanoic acid formation in the oxidation of 1-octanol over Au/CeO2 catalyst [15]. To explain this, they proposed that ester formation proceeds by a reaction pathway where the initially formed octanal is acetalized with 1-octanol to give the hemiacetal, which consecutive oxidation produces directly the ester. One may assume that the ester formation in the oxidation of tetradecanol on our Au/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst proceeds through the same pathway. The maximum reaction temperature in these experiments is limited by the boiling point (T b ) of the solvent used (T b =98°C for heptane). Therefore, to operate at higher temperatures, a solvent with higher boiling point, n-decane (T b =174°C) was selected and the effect the solvent on the selective oxidation of tetradecanol was explored. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the test results obtained with both solvents under the same reaction conditions. The overall trends were similar with both solvents, though the nature of solvent had some minor effects, say, alcohol conversion and ester selectivity were slightly higher in n-decane. It seems that the lesser difference of carbon chain lengths between tetradecanol and the solvent favours the mobility of tetradecanol molecules and reduces the steric hinderance effect. Then, the influence of reaction temperature T R was explored using n-decane as solvent (Fig. 6 ). As expected, oxidation rate and conversion increased with the increase of reaction temperature, and a maximum conversion of 60% was reached after 6h at T R =120°C. The main difference among the tests at various T R concerned product distribution. At a variance of tests at T R =80°C, where aldehyde and ester were the only products, the additional formation of tetradecanoic acid was detected at T R =100°C after 6h of run, and much earlier, after just 2h, at T R =120°C. The appearance of acid among the products brought along a sharp drop of the selectivity to aldehyde, but did not affect that of ester. This clearly indicates that the acid was formed by oxidation of the primary product, aldehyde, and not from hydrolysis of the ester. The interpretation of this apparently different effect of run time at different T R on acid formation becomes clearer if one considers that all products analysis where acid is found were obtained with samples taken above a certain threshold of conversion (roughly indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 6). This points to that the key factor for acid formation is not T R nor run time, but the degree of conversion and, hence, it involves the participation of another primary reaction product in the acid formation. Oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde generates water. It has been proposed that the formation of the carboxylic acid in the oxidation of octanol on supported Pd [16] and Au/NiO catalysts [15] proceeds via rapid hydration of the formed aldehyde, followed by dehydrogenation of the geminal diol to the carboxylic acid. In our tests, acid formation is detected when conversion exceeds ca. 30%, regardless the temperature. So, it seems that, in our tests, a certain critical minimum content of water is needed to start the hydration pathway to acid formation. The sharp change in selectivity observed once this critical value is reached indicates that water is not available for reaction when generated amount is lower. Taking into account the hydrophobicity of the solvent and hydrophylic nature of the surface of the ceria-alumina support, one may hypothesize that initially formed water is retained by irreversible absorption on the support surface and, when it becomes saturated, the additional water formed starts the hydration pathway to acid formation."
7,Conclusions,"Tetradecanol has been efficiently oxidized over a nano sized gold catalyst in accordance with green chemistry principles, using oxygen at atmospheric pressure as clean oxidant and a solvent with no base addition. High selectivity to tetradecanal (ca. 80%) or to tetradecanoic acid (60–70%) can be reached at moderate conversion (up to 38%), depending on the reaction conditions used. These results show that oxidation of long chain fatty alcohols is feasible with oxygen at atmospheric pressure, by using nano Au catalyst and a base-free organic solvent. Alcohol reactivity decreases with the increase of carbon atoms number probably due to a greater steric effect. Hence, higher reaction temperatures, and solvents with higher boiling point, will be needed to conduct higher fatty alcohols oxidation. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of formed water, the mechanism and the reaction network, as a way for directing the reaction selectively to the desired product (aldehyde, ester or acid)."
